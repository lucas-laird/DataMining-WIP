we tried main courses from their wild game and appetizers from their truffles menu.  i've never had these dishes anywhere else, so it is hard for me to judge them.  but i really appreciate them bringing these dishes to the united states.

overall, the food is not as good as robuchon, but probably better than anywhere else.

i'll return to try other unique main courses, like their veal, and their foie gras appetizer.",PLc0_CtEWEQvbztwZ5lZbg,0,0,4,HwDf2TpcSDmKDz_MctRR7Q
53301,2011-05-06,4,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Pssst . . .  This is a top notch restaurant, and you can actually dine here without breaking the bank (relatively speaking) if you do a bit of homework.  I'll even give you the Cliff Notes.

If you go to the restaurant bar (the Bubble Bar), they have a special menu with 10-12 items.  You can order them in ""little bites"" for $10 each, or ""big bites.""  The little bites are tasting menu portions - the big bites are full size portions.  The best part (among many)?  Many of the bar menu items are the same things found on the regular menu, but at a fraction of the price (even the big bites)! 

Put it this way - I had the whole bar to myself (it's not that big - FYI - I went on a Wed., so can't say if it crowds up at other times).  I had three little bites (oysters, lobster avocado salad, truffle-artichoke soup), one big bite (Turbotin), and a half order dessert and a glass of wine -- the whole thing cost $100 (not cheap, mind you, but a heck of a lot more manageable than the hundreds of dollars other folks drop there).  They also threw in 2 amuses, plus their awesome assortment of fresh bread.

Oh, right - the food and service -- both outstanding.  I'm hard pressed to think of a better place in Vegas, and certainly not for the price I paid.

If I ever have a chance to go back, I'll probably design my own tasting menu in the bar - how does a 9-course tasting menu for $90 sound?  Just don't tell 'em it was me who let the secret out . . .",_gjKuFxdQSLPrf6fYSiUwg,14,8,5,t4DU1MF5g9ey704hAE2nbQ

What an experience.  The food was out of this world.  My wife had a truffle soup and I ate a bunny.  We really enjoyed the bread pairings with each course.

The service was on top of everything.  Any time we needed something, someone was there - like mindreaders.

79298,2009-10-13,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"My wife and I ate at a table in the bubble bar area at Guy Savoy and could not have been happier.  The bites and bubbles menu offered up over a dozen fantastic treats ranging from gazpacho, to lobster to ravioli to foie gras, to a mini burger.  There were no dessert ""bites"" that night, so instead we ordered a half-portion of a delicious assorted grapefruit presentations and mignardises from the exquisite dessert cart.  We were the only ones in the entire bubble bar (no reservations taken), though we did arrive just before 10pm.   

All told, we ordered about 8 small bites at $10 a piece and were stuffed after dessert.  So while the small bites can be a scant couple of bites, on average they are the size of a normal tasting menu plate.  Next, time we'll be sure to reserve at table in the dining room (and drop by again for the bubble bar menu).   The quality of the food and service was actually above and beyond any other restaurant in Vegas, including Robuchon.  The atmosphere of the bubble bar was a notch below, but that was to be expected.  For those looking for an exceptional michelin-starred meal at a moderately expensive fare, I cannot recommend the bubble bar at Guy Savoy high enough.

81543,2014-01-06,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"I really enjoyed the Signature Tasting Menu, but not all of the courses resonate with me.  I gave Guy Savoy 4 stars, but it's more like 4.5 for the food  4.5 for the service and a 3 for the decor.  If you sit in the back row, you're just staring at wooden slats.  Some dished need to be refined to have more impact.  

I don't have 1 bad thing to say about the food at Guy Savoy.  The meal was filled with wonder and amazement!  

The Artichoke Soup was so intense and flavorful it is my new favorite soup.  The coconut dessert has an amazing combination of temperatures and textures.  It's amazing that all of those combinations can be put into one cup and all of it is made from coconut!

Definitely a solid 2 Michelin Star restaurant and if the inspectors come back to Vegas, I wouldn't be surprised if Guy Savoy got 3 stars.",S5W_Lfh4FQzF12CAOHRkQg,2,0,4,OhebepziNd4JWq0fNxDUcQ

First, the foie gras that they prepared on the tasting menu was not seared so it was not my favorite.  I expressed this and was given this amazing seared foie gras.  I would seriously make a trip to guy savoy just for that foie gras.  The entire meal was eloquent and delicious.  We ate every drop on our plates from the appetizers, to the main meal, to the cheese course and to the dessert.  It was so much food that we could not finish our dessert so the waiter gave us some to go. 

I honestly could rave about each dish that we had so instead I will just simply say that this is the best restaurant I have ever tasted in my life.

266362,2013-01-10,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"I'd give this more of a 3.75 stars (this should totally be an option on yelp) than a true 4 stars, particularly taking into consideration the price. Did the 6 course tasting menu, and while everything was prepared well, I think the nature of French cuisine tends to be on the heavy / rich side, which is a little hard for asian palates to handle dish after dish. For the price and the michelin ratings, I would have preferred if they were more conservative with the overall flavors of the tasting menu - scaling back the savory and salty, and mixing it up a with some sour and bitter flavors to balance the palate better.  I could understand how this might be a classic case of how different people have different palates, but through the 6 courses I really couldn't remember any part of a dish (let alone a whole dish) that satisfied the sour or bitter tastes, maybe save for certain breads they offered.  

The dessert cart they bring over at the end is pretty cool in its presentation and concept. The quality is not bad as well, but to be brutally honest, it really is just an extension of a dessert section you would find at one of Vegas' better buffets.

I do like their bread selection though - must try the bacon one!",nuc7NIsBM1UkI6AVpOM8nQ,0,0,4,QkZmNa_9PjrYCuYJa0oPyA

477372,2011-06-16,2,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Wow! What a phenomenal experience... the food, the staff, the atmosphere - absolutely amazing... the only downer is that the Las Vegas restaurant is the only Guy Savoy in the US, I believe other restaurants are located in London and the newest one in Singapore. 

First, the décor is modern with dark wood and high ceiling, but the restaurant still allows for a comfortable atmosphere without being too stuffy or scared to talk vibe.

The staff, amazing!  They are very helpful and friendly especially when you need to substitute an ingredient due to dietary constraints.  They are more than willing to be flexible with their menu even if you're doing the Tasting Menu.  The staff has a perfect combination of friendly and attentiveness when you need them and disappear when you don't.  If Frank Savoy (the son) is in the front, talk to him for a bit - what a great personality!

The food... where do I start.  First, they don't just have bread... they have a bread cart!  The bread cart is an amazing sight!   All different types of bread can be found on this cart, olive loaf, baguette, bacon bread, etc.  The amuse bouche (foie gras - who serves foie gras as an amuse bouche? Guy Savoy does!) served while waiting for the first course was a great start, left me feeling excited and curious to our menu.  The food was great!  Every piece of meat, vegetable, sauce was seasoned perfectly - you can eat each ingredient alone and it would be perfect, the plate combination was a winner!  Every course had the perfect execution of seasoning, flavor, portion size, and combination.  

The grand finale - THE DESSERT CART!  If the bread cart was not impressive enough, the end of dinner (after the course dessert) dessert cart can make this sweet tooth-holic cry.  While most good restaurants serve bon-bon of small chocolate and candy, Guy Savoy has a small candy/ dessert shop on a cart.  You can get anything from cookies, to chocolate, to fresh sorbet.  If they are serving pear sorbet, make sure to sample it.... Maybe one of the best sorbets EVER!!!",8zKNaYqy0I8pOoYu3ZDOQw,4,3,5,nYUmy9l6OftOfCZ0RyU_9A

506758,2010-11-17,24,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"I dislike this place and will never recommend it to anyone. Fine dining to me involves 1) Unique wonderful food 2) Immaculate service - this is why you pay so much more, which is why it's called fine dining.

If you look, I usually like to only review places I LIKE. So people will go there. Why waste time to help advertise places I do not like. This is an exception.

Here is the gist, my friend had left because she was hung over. She had ordered bread from the cart, prior to leaving. I did not. So she got her food in a box and left, while myself and 4 other friends stayed for the rest of the dinner. While we were enjoying our entrees I was eating HER bread. The bread was wheat bread, and I admit, was delicious. So the waiter (whom french accent sounded super unauthentic) seeing that she left, comes over to clean up and remove her place setting - which is normal. He reaches over and grabs the plate with the bread on it, which was next to me. I tell him ""No no leave the bread, I am eating it"". Now, what is the common sense  thing to do, if you were the waiter?

Think about it... Common sense?!?!

Answer: You put the plate down!!! walk away and let the customer enjoy the bread! 

Right????

You do not even need to say anything, but of course, instead of doing this, he spoke back in condescending tone ""But monsieur, that is the ladies bread"" as if I broke some sort of natural law- Is it really unacceptable for me to eat someone else bread?If the same situation occurs at any other restaurant, I can *almost* guarantee you they will put the plate down and would probably even be glad to do so. 

So he grabs the plate (with my hand on the plate as well!) and said ""I will bring you another bread"". I totally recall thinking... Why is he arguing with me? So he takes off with the plate and this was when I was not too happy. He did come back with bread, but it was NOT the same type!! Obviously, I am not going to make call him out because it is not the same kind of bread but this added to my fury!!!!

Alright, because this happen with bread, you may say ""it's only bread"" Well, lets substitute this situation with say.. soup. Your friend leaves so you are enjoying their clam chowder which was ordered. The waiter comes over to deny you of it, even though you ask to leave it there. He brings you a new bowl of soup, however when it arrives, its some cream of broccoli. 

I know most of you would say something about the soup!

Anyways the food.. I ordered the Kobe Beef. I had six ounces of it, its sold by the ounce. It was not good. The above incident occurred during the main course, so I stopped eating. Left a couple ounces on the plate and did not allow anyone to touch it. 

Another one of my friend saw I was upset and so she said something to the manager (or owner, not sure) and he provided complementary glass of wine to everyone. I made sure nobody drank the wine they gave me. 
I do not need this crap and you do not either, hundred of places in Vegas to have a great dining experience. I walked out upset. 

it maybe a funny story with my friends and I now but at the moment, I was Pissssssed.


Never again!

557760,2012-03-21,2,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Visited Guy Savoy this weekend for what was to be a nice meal.  Was a let down.  

The service was good and it they were having communication issue among themselves as they kept discussing with each other the status of other tables.  Wasn't that busy as when we were there only 5 other tables active.  

We had the Prestage Tasting Menu.  The potion sizes were extremely small and the protein portions were way too small to be filling.  The duck portion was my favorite but only three small thin slices were all that was served.  There were several courses that would have been better if they had explained the sauces before they spread it over the dishes.  I am not overly fond of beets and it was layered too thick on the scallop dish.  None of the dishes were really poor but about 1/2 weren't that good.  

From a presentation stage, they should update the china to be more colorful like you get at Joel R.  Have to omit, the experience I've had there far exceed the experience at GS for not that significant of more money.

574274,2011-05-09,2,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"My wife and I have been to nearly every 3 Michelin star restaurant in the US, so we were excited about going to Guy but our expectations were a bit tempered because it was only a 2 star restaurant with a much lower profile than the other heavy hitters on the Strip. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised and completely blown away by the experience. It was one of the finest dining experiences of our lives and there were so many moments where we took a bite and started moaning audibly. Embarrassing but if you've eaten here you'll know why. The food is simply delicious, beautiful and sensuous. 

First let's start with the bread service. For some this is a throw away but here at Guy they roll out this enormous cart with bread arranged in a giant wall of carbs. It was beatiful, ridiculous and made my wife who is a bread fiend almost weep. The bread was served with two kinds of butter (salted and unsalted) and each of the choices was incredible. My favorite as a lemon bread with rinds of lemon in the bread that my waiter ""paired"" with the lobster dish to bring out its flavor. Who ever heard of a bread pairing with a dish? 

We opted for the Menu Elegance for $180 and our first dish was the lobster and avocado. It was a perfect balance of acidic with the lemon along with the fat of the avocado balls and the sweetness of the lobster meat perfectly cut with amazing knife skills. 

We then got a monkfish with greens and a black pepper saboyan that was pure goodness. The meat was firm but not overdone, meaty but tender and the saboyan was buttery and lick-your-plate-clean good.

The next course was the asaparagus soup with flecks of parmesan and truffles on top. It was served with a warm mushroom brioche bun slathered with truffle butter table side which you would dip in the soup. This is the part where our eyes closed and we started making x-rated noises. It was delicious, earthy, savory, overwhelming and sensuous all in one bowl? Dipping the bread into the soup was an overload of flavors and one of the most memorable dishes I've ever eaten. I really don't like soup so for me to say that is truly overcoming my natural biases. 

The next course was the duck breast perfectly sliced and presented with a series of vegetables. My wife said that it is the best duck she's ever had which truly high praise because she's had duck at Per Se, French Laundry, and just about every other high end french restaurant. Truly sublime with a smokey flavor that wasn't overwhelming. 

Last but not least was the Jasmine Chocolate dessert presented tableside with a spritz of Jasmine at the very last moment. Incredibly fragrant and a dessert that perfectly combined two seemingly disparate flavors with flawless execution. 

I would rank this restaurant right up there with Le Bernardin, Per Se and French Laundry. I know some would argue that Robuchon is better but I disagree. I've eaten there and if I were a Michelin grader I would give Guy 3 starts and Robuchon 2. An amazing restaurant and one worth the splurge.",pKu3dXJ8fRK_4i8NWp8etA,5,3,5,Sx8FPmQAaqiDbZSA4APZEA

Hey, it's a super-expensive, great French restaurant. You already know that. My take is that if you are willing to pay the $$$$, you won't be disappointed.",s1mzzdILg_YuhiH8P8U01Q,3,3,5,u1H2zI_9_5Ewmtar-_-3CA

A MUST experience. The service impeccable but never stiff, very engaging and knowledgable. Atmosphere/decor is minimalist and maybe some may say a little cold except for the fact that the service and chef light the place up! One of the best meals we had this year, even though the table next to us had the rudest family.  The adults were disinterested and on their cellphones.  The patriarch wore a t-shirt!  They ordered the salmon dish cooked on dry ice, which is served by the chef de cuisine. He patiently waited for several minutes to prepare the dish because two girls from the family had left the table.  While he waited, everyone at the table was on a cellphone.  The chef kept his composure. My fiancée and I were mortified with the family's behavior and impressed with the chef.  We love this place.

811831,2010-08-18,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"This review is a 6 months overdue, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was able to go to Restaurant Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace with family from out of town. It is the only other Guy Savoy restaurant in the world, the first being in Paris, France. It is hands down one of THE best french restaurants in Las Vegas. The service and attention to detail are beyond what you can believe. The ratio is 3:1, meaning 3 servers to 1 guest. What!!
    Once you enter and are greeted by the host, you are escorted to a private table where you are greeted by the manager of the restaurant, Franck, who also is the son of the chef. He asked if there will be any time constraints (just in case you have a show or something else to do in town) and then explains the menu to you. 
     We started the dining experience with the wine sommelier explaining to us about all the different bottles of champagnes and wines they have to offer that month. After making a selection, they cart the wines and champagnes to your table in a large silver bowl overflowing with ice to keep all the bottles chilled and ready to serve (our choice was a 1999 Bollinger Brut Special Cuvee), at the same time the waiters bring you a selection of artisan bread rolls, made fresh daily, ranging from black olives, white and black truffles, pepperoni, and the original delicate french bread with a pink sea salt crust. They are all served with artisan butter, all made in house, ranging from sea salt to black truffle and one I can't remember, and constantly replaced as to not let the butter melt to a oily mess, (remember the 3:1 ratio in servers).
    We started the meal with a little teacup of Celery and Turnip with Potato and Leek Soup plus hidden salmon and daikon roll with basil gelee to open up your palate. The appetizers we started with were Kumamoto oysters served with a seaweed jelly and oyster puree. Next was the soup, a silky smooth Artichoke Soup that had Parmesan and French black truffle shaved tableside. Next, the Duck Foie Gras and Radish, the foie gras arranged like a fan, pan seared then steam baked with pink radishes.
    For the main dish, sweetbreads from a baby calf, browned so that they are crispy on the outside and still juicy in the inside served over summer vegetables braised in veal stock. After that, lamb chops, oven roasted, served with pearl onions, mushrooms, and carrots and sliced Italian Alba white truffles
   For dessert, a brown butter ice cream, a grapefruit terrine, and a soft chocolate cake served with a crisp praline and a chicory cream. I wasn't a huge fan of such a sweet dessert, but all in all the meal which lasted 2 hours was the best french meal I've had the pleasure to enjoy in years.
    When the meal was complete, the man whose name is the restaurant Chef Guy Savoy personally came out to greet us and asked if we enjoyed the meal. Also needed to be mentioned is that the manager of the restaurant, Franck, a very likeable fellow, with witty humor and a class that isn't snobby but humble who came to check up on us throughout the dinner. Also after the meal, we had  the chance to thank all the chefs because Franck took us for a personal tour of the kitchen, a well orchestrated parade of chefs at different stations working tediously to ensure every guest receives a 5 star meal.
    We are spoiled in Las Vegas because we are the only city in all the U.S. that has 5 star chefs cooking for us every day of the week and we can pick and choose where and at what fine establishment we want to eat. You really can not get that any where else in the U.S.",6HjTQy4nx5xeJ3_oP6Poug,8,5,5,q4397jYz6eLxInTIf2J8ew
829212,2014-05-05,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"This type of restaurant is hard for me to review like a regular restaurant so I am going to review Robouchon, Guy Savoy and  e' by jose andres as special places to go for the experience not necessarily the food. My palate is just not that sophisticated for these places to be a place where I have some food where I just want to pick up the plate and lick it clean. The presentation of the food is gorgeous and the bread carts and candy carts are amazing by themselves.
This review is from April 2013. I came here with my daughter and son in law. 
I did not like the décor of this restaurant, I felt like I was in a warehouse.
We did the Innovation Menu and it was beautifully presented but as I stated above I think my palate is not good enough for these places because while I like most of the food I didn't love anything enough to rave about it and want to come back. I had this experience and wouldn't come back unless I were craving bread or cheese because those were both amazing.
 I didn't get a copy of the menu we were served but I do remember there was a pea puree that others had raved about and my daughter and son in law loved but I hate peas and I was hoping this dish would change my mind but it didn't! The servers were right on top of everything though and when they noticed I only had few bites they asked why and when I explained my dislike of peas they immediately brought me another dish which was very nice.
The service here was awesome. Everyone here was so nice.",TDenGI2F_W89MDT3mxU81g,2,1,4,z6qfaEoArGZdUjBjo1swxQ
886315,2012-03-26,2,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"From a $500/plate restaurant, you expect certain things. The level of service was there. The food, however, was uninspired, dull and, at times, just plain bad. 

My date and I have been to several Michelin star restaurants. We are by no means ""foodies"" (I hate that term), but we have a fair amount of experience with fine dining.

We had the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings. 

When we went to Ria, the wine pairings opened my eyes to a whole other level of enjoyment. The wines themselves were tasty and when paired with the food - divine. I had no idea wine could do the things they did.

Here, the wines on their own were mediocre, at best. I didn't see any connection to the food.

I like caviar. The caviar dish tasted like emulsified puke with a slight hint of caviar flavor.

I can't remember what the next fish dish was. It tasted wonderful. It smelled like a decaying corpse. I'm not sure what level of refinement I need to appreciate that.

It's hard to screw up seared foie gras. Somehow, they did it. If you ignored the overpowering kumquat addition, the foie gras dish was good.

Truffle and artichoke soup - their specialty. Excellent! This is the minimum of what all of the courses should be at this price point.

Beef and carrots - their best dish. The flavors surprised me and worked beautifully together.

The cheeses - incredible. It did what the wine pairings at Ria did. It made me want to go out and buy every cheese I can to taste and experience it. The flavors were SO intense.

The coconut 6 ways dessert was boring and bland. It tasted like unsweetened, unflavored shaved ice.

The last chocolate dessert was something you could buy at Starbucks. Plain and mediocre.

There were some all-star courses, but as I said, at this caliber of restaurant and price point, every single course should be incredible. I've spent this much at a restaurant before and felt like it was well worth it. I walked away extremely angry and upset here. There are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas for $100/plate or less.

tips: maybe just stick to the smaller tasting menu and avoid the bread. 
there's even a champagne guy for recs to start off your meal!

1088895,2009-01-22,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"The BF and I shared the meal of our lives at Restaurant Guy Savoy in Paris on Valentine's Day 2006. It was also the most expensive meal of our lives with the MIDDLE priced tasting menu, two cocktails and a bottle and a half of moderately priced wine coming in at $1,800 (thanks in part to an unfavorable exchange rate). The meal was absolutely worth every dime and it was perfect in every way. Chef Savoy came by our table that night no less than four times to ensure we delighted. 

Based on our exemplary experience in Paris, I was reticent to try Restaurant Guy Savoy in Las Vegas. I was afraid it would be a shadow of the flagship in the City of Lights. I was delighted to discover that Franck Savoy, Guy's absolutely adorable son, has done his father proud. Franck runs the Vegas restaurant with the same level of quality as in Paris. 

If you've been to the restaurant in Paris, be prepared for a few differences in Las Vegas. The service is a bit Americanized. In Paris they just automatically pair the housemade bread with each course of your meal. In Las Vegas they pull up an admittedly impressive cart with 14 housemade breads and offer them to you or they give you the option for them to pair them with your dishes. I preferred the more subtle approach in Paris. However, I fear some of the subtleties of French service are lost on Vegas. 

The other advantage is that you're paying in US dollars at the Las Vegas satellite. We took the BF's brother along with us on this trip to Vegas to celebrate his birthday. After enjoying the fabulous Better Midler show, we were just going to have drinks and appetizers in the bar. However, we glanced at the dinner menu and mentioned that we had been to the original in Paris and then Franck said, ""Welcome home"" and we were on our way to a table. 

The Menu Prestige was priced at $290 per person and it was absolutely worth every penny given the quality of the food. The meal was comprised of: 
* An initial bite from the kitchen of foie-gras and toast 
* A dual amuse bouche of seasonal squash soup and a bite of pate -- note that the novel plate for this dish is made exclusively for Guy Savoy in Limoges; many of the Guy Savoy exclusives are designed specifically for the dishes being served 
* Oysters in Ice Gelée -- this was good, but the decorative carrot slices (meant to resemble flower blossoms) under the gelee kept sticking to the roof of my mouth 
* ""Colors of Caviar"" -- the decadent layers of this dish are a delight for the eyes and the tongue 
* Crispy Sea Bass with Delicate Spices -- the preparation of this dish is elaborate as they cook the scales on a hot rock to make them edible while the flesh is separately cooked to perfection; the mushrooms on the side were wonderful as was the vanilla sauce 
* Foie-Gras ""en Papillotte"" and Radish Bouillon -- the tableside presentation of this dish is something else; they bring it out in a pillow of clear plastic on a bed of hot rocks so that you can savor the aroma before they take it back to the kitchen and plate it for you 
* Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup with Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter -- there's nothing in the soup but artichokes and water, really. 
* Since we had been to the flagship in Paris, they brought us a fantastic ""bonus"" course of white fish in a veal reduction (!) over perfectly crispy potato slivers; it was one of my favorite savory dishes of the meal 
* Muscovy Duck ""Poached-Roasted"" with Autumn Root Vegetables -- and they've tucked some foie-gras under the duck skin, of course 
* Sélection de Fromages Affinés -- the cheese cart is fabulous and the charming French lad who served the cheese to us was nearly seven feet tall; we asked him to put together a selection of the most interesting cheeses on the cart and they were all great 
* We then enjoyed a palate cleanser of mango and avocado sorbets; they were perfectly sweet and provided another great transition point 
* Textures of Blood Orange -- this was really blood oranges four ways; I love blood oranges, but it tasted sour to me. It needed a bit of sugar, especially after the sweet sorbets served right before it. 
* Chocolate Sphere -- I thought this would be a heavy truffle and I was delighted to see what Chef Savoy had in mind. You need to experience Restaurant Guy Savoy for yourself to see what they do with this dessert 
* Finally, they brought over the ""treat cart."" It contained delights I have been dreaming about since Paris. The highlights included: 
* Cotton candy rice pudding (they call it ""pink praline"" -- it was very good, but it's ethereal in Paris) 
* Housemade blood orange marshmallows; the marshmallows at Guy Savoy prove what a triumph this simple confection can be 
* Macarons just like you'd savor in Paris 
* Fruit gelees -- so simple and so perfect 
* Lollipops that are a testament to the art of sugar

No, again, it's my personal cell phone number, to which no one else has the code for. She curtly apologizes and offers us a $75 credit at another restaurant. Laughable, if I wasn't so close to tears.

I have to say the presentations said it all from the ""surprise"" sashimi under the amuse bouche to the cold steam with the lobster course to the bread display (I recommend the bacon-stuffed roll).

The wine list literally required a table to support it - not only was it thick, but the contents were all first class with several rare first growth french wines.  Although I was tempted by several bottles, the wine pairing with the tasting menu is a good way to go.  The pours are full enough to get you through the whole course and the time between courses which is refreshing from some places where you only get a couple sips.  

The decor was a perfect pairing to the food - elegant chic.  They have a great fireplace in the lounge area, perfect for a pre or post-dinner cocktail.  I am on a mission to find the chargers and bread plates that set the table, and I loved all the ""rooms"" they created with carved wood panel walls.

We opted for the white truffle tasting menu and I have no regrets - yes it's insanely expensive but for special occasions worth every penny.

The highlight of the evening as others have mentioned is that dessert cart - everything you should ever want is included. Hand-made gelato (check), freshly baked cookies and madeleines (check), housemade chocolate truffles (check) and the list goes on...

Immediately, head to the elevator on the right and at the top left you'll arrive at these large doors with a 5 Diamond plaque on the wall, 'Guy Savoy.'  I expected so much after dining at the other best of the very best Le Cirque, Picasso, Joel Robuchon, Blossom and if I'm going to spend hundreds on meal, I expect a lot!  

First off, I was surprised they had a bar and would've sat there if I had known the servers would have a horrible attitude.  Are they suppose to walk around without a smile?  The warehouse type atmosphere with gray walls was not inviting.  Dark and dull, but I was thankful to have a view of the Eiffel Tower.

The wine list was fantastic, as it should be.  In my pictures I will show you the best part of the meal, a garnish around the plate of caviar and dried asparagus. I would've rather ordered the caviar than what I did. 

After the wine was wonderfully presented, a huge tacky 'Cracker Barrel' type of bread mobile appeared.  Totally different than the whole scene of the restaurant.  I really hate to be so straightforward here.  And maybe I was so excited to dine here that I am just truly disappointed.  I will not be back again being that Vegas has so much more to offer.

Service was impeccable and we really did have a blast. Too much in fact!  I was completely and utterly bombed by the end of the evening.

First, in order to find the massive wooden doors that marks the entrance to this gastronomical wonderland, you have to navigate through the labyrinth that is Ceaser's Palace. Ceaser himself, armed with today's latest GPS technology, wouldn't be able to find this place (or the bathroom, for that matter).

One thing that stood out for me (besides the small chair that they have for purses) was the CARTS filled with goodness. The bread cart towered far above the tables and contained a huge variety of endless bread (that I can't remember) that was freshly baked. The champagne cart was excellent and I enjoyed the recommendation that the sommelier has made. The dessert cart was similarly filled to the brim with all types of unique desserts, and at that time I was already stuffed from the huge meal we just had.

Some stand out dishes include:
1) Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Bricohe, and Black Truffle Butter - A solid foundation for the our meal. Contained huge chunks of black truffles which really made the soup memorable.
2) Crispy Veal Sweetbreads w/ Petite Potato and Black Truffle Sandwiches - Delicious and delicate, and paired well with the glass of Cab that we had
3) Roasted Baby Chicken w/ Black Truffle Potato Puree and Winter Vegetables - at this point I was too full to eat too much of this, but it was a nice touch for them to bring out the pot for you to smell before it is fully cooked.

The Chocolate Fondant and the Textures of Blood Orange were both very good. If only I was born with a larger stomach, I could have fully sampled and finished all the dishes that were presented to me. This was, so far, the best dining experience I've ever had.",3b9QMXzCnTEv93s4y3gm7w,4,4,5,BxhzW3TVnEpJcpAk-jchCA

You may have heard of this place, but it's the only location in the US outside of France. It's run by Guy Savoy's son Franck at the Vegas location. 
The decor is simple, warm and inviting. But all the effort goes into the food. 
Sat in the bubble bar area near the fireplace. It's very casual here. 
The chairs are so small and delicate, I kept slipping off. Maybe it was the wine. In any case, tasted a few of the appetizers and it's divine. 

The restaurant does feature a really cool dining area inside the kitchen. It's glass encased, so you can see the chef and the cooks at work. 
There's also a Krug Champagne room. 

Back to the menu: It's all about tastings, small plates enough for one bite. 
From the signature artichoke and black truffle soup to spiced crispy sea bass the flavors are well balanced and textured. I felt like a judge on Iron Chef. 

There is a 10 course Menu Prestige which is probably going to cost you what some people pay in rent. You can take a different route though and choose items from the a la carte menu. 
There is also a dessert cart that comes after you're done eating. It's all in little portions including the much talked about pudding in a jar. 
Bon Appetit listed this place one the country's hottest restaurants.",xU4silHWZGOWz92hPIdFpQ,8,7,5,Qmkb_9QIcVEkDINQ_OB4Jw

They spend more time telling you about the food and how it's prepared than it takes you to eat the small bite of it.  The waitstaff make you feel like it's a big deal in how you actually eat the food--as in, you have to wait for their permission basically.

Speaking of waitstaff, I've been to plenty of restaurants like this--Charlie Trotters, French Laundry--and the service at Guy Savoy was completely lacking.  Actually unprofessional if you factor in that you're spending over $500 per person.  They were not synchronized at all.  Some of them could barely master the English language.  They roll around the impressive bread cart, but then they don't offer you any bread.  WTF?

So, while Guy Savoy may like to make out that it's one of the premier restaurants in the world, I beg to differ.  Plenty of other places in Vegas where the food and the service is MUCH better.",_gS--SujA3LD3UK1F5ODLw,1,0,3,sEfLg_bw-DdJW2TllNi2jA

The food was definitely good but not necessarily great, and the service was horrible. When asked what wine would pair best with my main course, a specific Bordeaux was recommended. Knowing that I did not like that wine, I was told that my only other choice was a specific Cabernet. Really? Only 2 choices for wine by the glass? No offer was made to have the sommelier stop by to discuss options. The initial presentation of our courses was nicely done but one ever came to see if they were prepared to our liking--for any course! When the majority of one course was left on our plates, no one inquired why--the plates were simply removed. Lastly, even though the reservation noted that we were elevating a special occasion, nothing was done to recognize this--not even a verbal acknowledgement of the event. I suspect we may have had a bad service night as others seem to have better experiences...I wish ours could have been better.",kv7IRPEY880rq84wmq2E9g,0,0,2,hQpCF15KAoCrQOR8NLHtXQ

What a rip off, dinner for 2 was close to $800 and barely worth half of that. 

The decor although cold is beautiful, the service is impeccable and friendly but the food is just average. The kitchen tries too hard and the outcome is bland and gimmicky; don't expect to be wowed by genuine flavors and awesome ingredients. 

This restaurant would not survive 6 months in New York, let alone Paris. This is not even a distant shadow of its Parisian mother ship. This is as genuine and true to great French cuisine as the Paris casino is to the real city. 

In a nutshell avoid unless someone is paying or you just broke the house at the tables. This is my biggest restaurant disappointment ever and it confirms that in Vegas you should stick to the casual and basic eateries and avoid the pretentious haute cuisine at all cost.",NZwt8uzaf1iOc5FTWgZVdQ,5,1,3,WGRUnI_uRv47djqN3RujpA

We probably would have eventually made it here anyway since we love experiencing French cuisine. The spontaneity of the moment made for a really lovely evening though.

The restaurant was quite empty...and quiet. Maybe it just seems like that since the tables are set far apart for ambiance.  I even got a little chair for my clutch.

We ordered the signature menu and each dish was an experience. Never will I forget the blue soup. NATURALLY colored. It really takes imagination and skill to create that.

It was nice to have some foie gras, since it's been banned in California. All of the delicacies showed up in unexpected ways that made for a truly unique meal. 

My advice... if you come, order the signature menu and keep your tastebuds open to new experiences. Also, get wine pairings!",nWreYDQ1yBMuraJMeCWUbg,3,3,5,4Zs7wO2UOqciCi_1YHmWjQ

There are various dining options, from small tasting menus, to large tasting menus, to a la carte. Either way, you cannot escape this place for less than $200 for two people, which is not terrible for a culinary institution such as Guy Savoy. You are also showered with treats from the kitchen throughout the night.

Make sure to ask to see the wine list, even if you are broke from gambling. It is worth flipping through the large Encyclopedia like book of wines just to see what a rich person might drink...and what you and I can only dream of one day tasting!!!

The decor is surprisingly minimal...which is great because the highlight of Guy savoy is not the restaurant itself but what comes out of the kitchen.

Make sure to make a reservation and live it up!!! It is well worth the money and time to experience a place such as Guy Savoy!!!",2Fu4xzc4Z4SvRGDcfC0qfA,0,0,4,v48-nMSx1MLMFo8A5G-egg
1531999,2012-05-12,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"I started off not really liking this place.  It was awkward as you got off the elevator at the Caesar's and saw this big iron door.  The door was closed.  We took a few steps forward and the French hostess opened the door.  The decor is very serene and mundane.  No frills and frou frou like Joel Robochon.  You sort of felt like you were dining in a friends living room, but nothing fancy.  Walls were painted in a brown/beige/grey hue and there was a weird white bear head in a plexi glass case that stared at me.  

As compared to the ambiance of Joel Robochon - there is no glitz and glamour here.
We were greeted by a French server - very tall.  Reminded me of a character from the Adams Family.  Very friendly and pleasant.  

We selected the Signature Menu - $258 per person.  The evening started with 3 morrocan-looking glass jars on your table - one is a candle, one holds salt and the other held pepper.  Then they brought over 2 more glass jars - unsalted butter and salted butter.  

They offer you 7 types of champagne to start with  - the Asian guy - I am guessing he was the sommelier was quite pretentious.  Not very friendly and did not make you feel comfortable.  Funny, Asians will do this to other Asians.  You would think that being from the same country, they would be happy to see you in their work environment, but the French server was much more pleasant and friends than the Asian sommelier.  We choose the $29 a glass Guy Savoy special champagne.  

The fougasse bread was brought to the table - it was hard and not very good.  The the bread cart followed.  I was confused as to why they would serve the fougasse when they had much better breads on the bread cart.  The guy serving the bread went over all they had to offer - like 12 breads or so....  He told us he could course it out for us and serve us a bread with each course - don't do this, as he never served us bread with every course and we never go to try the ones we really wanted  - the bacon milk bread and the olive bread..... 

There was 2 amuse bouches served - first was a foie gras toast on a pick, then a waffle that you picked up with your fingers.  Both good, but not outstanding.  

Low and behold, Chef Guy Savoy walks out into the dining room..... wow....  we asked if we could take a photo and he did.  That was the hi-light of the evening.  He asked how our food was.  What a pleasant man.  

The next course was the lobster tartar - amazingly good.  They place dry ice in the bottom of the dish and pour a broth over it, so all the dish becomes an amazing spectacle.  The following courses were the caviar course, foie gras, truffle soup, filet, halibut, cheese course, pre-dessert course, dessert course - the most amazing earl grey sorbet to cleanse my pallet and the most beautiful orange granite....  

The weakest dish was a coconut concotion of some ice, tapioca and some coconut.  Not very tasty and it was really bland.  I would leave this course out, Chef....  not very good.  

At times the food did not come out in a timely manner and we sat a couple of times with dirty plates in front of us for more than 5 minutes, but you were okay with it, because there was a lot to watch around you.  

The minardes cart was not as impressive as Robochon's, but there was ice cream and sorbets to select from.  I was so full by this time, I could barely eat another bite.  

Overall, the service is friendly and they do make you feel comfortable.  There was a large party of 10 in the private dining area and Chef made a few appearances throughout the night.  I must say, a very nice touch.....  

Would l go back again?  For $850 for 2 persons, I would have to say, I would  need to save this for a very special occassion.   Or if I did hit a jackpot, I would go back.....  This was $200 more than Joel Robochon and $400 more than Twist.....
Would go back to these places first.   Although, I did get a picture with the legend himself...",8G7wFBuYnV4fZph6iprW5A,3,0,4,lcf8d2SstKcT05Vr7CQZiw

We were going to catch a show, so the only time we would be able to make it was after 9pm. We were promptly seated (yay reservations made through opentable!) and given an amouse-bouche. They even gave us a little low stool for my purse. As we were getting ready to order, we saw that there was an open table near the window and asked if we could be moved. Our server went to ask the manager to see if that could be arranged. We were able to change seats (double yay!) and dined with a view. Unfortunately, we could not partake in the tasting menu because it is not offered after 9 or 930. While we still wanted to try the tasting menu, the selection and quality of the a la carte menu was well beyond our needs.

We ordered the Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde Foie Gras and Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup appetizers which they offered to split for us. I ordered the half-portion of Wagyu Beef and Lobster entree which was perfectly filling. My fiancee ordered the Crispy French Sea Bass which is a classic dish from Guy Savoy. After ordering, they offered/recommended to us an unbelievable unlimited complimentary selection of breads to sample during our meal. The server was very attentive and gave us suggestions. Then they provided another amouse-bouche of pea soup with a little surprise under the other half of the small cup. It seemed like the staff was very excited for us to discover the surprise since inquired if we had found it yet (very cute). The surprise under the cup was a delicious and soft heart of palm stuffed with cheese. The appetizers we ordered were perfectly matched with their bread pairings. The entrees were equally if not more amazing. The wagyu was so tender, and the sea bass tasted light and the crispy scales gave it an amazing texture. The earl grey sorbet they give at the end was a great way to finish such a flavor rich dinner.

1628090,2014-12-26,2,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Where do I start?

On our way to Vegas, my hubby and I reached an epiphany: We did not have to follow in our parents' footsteps of gorging ourselves at buffet after buffet while in Vegas. We preferred quality over quantity during our week stay in LV, so there began our search.

Sadly Picasso and Le Cirque were all booked. Luckily,  we were able to book a reservation via phone at Guy Savoy even on such short notice. I was told by the hostess it was a $260 per person prix fixe and a CC was needed to secure a table. She also noted there was a $150 pp cancellation fee -- but there was no mention of a set holiday menu. That was fine with me as my husband had Guy Savoy on his fine dining bucket list so we solidify the reservation with a CC.

Game day: While were waiting to be seated, I see the Innovation prix fixe menu and an a la carte menu displayed in front of their establishment. Oh, I thought, the hostess was wrong about the prix fixe menu, so I planned out my course excitedly. 

When the time came for us to be seated, we we're handed a set $345 holiday prix fixe menu..OK, it was not $260 the hostess said, but that was fine. However I was still a bit disappointed since I prerused their menu online before hand also, and the items offered on the holiday menu had nothing I really wanted.

The first three courses were good but nothing mind blowing. Having dined at Joel Robuchon two days before, I definitely had a bar set for Guy Savoy. It was all down hill after the scallop course, and I could see my neighboring tablemates shaking their heads course after course, seeming to share my sentiments upon finishing the same course as us. 

The cheese formage was bland and a waste of calories. Just bc you shave some truffles and throw it on foam cheese, is not a good course one makes. 

The main entrees were what disappointed me the most. I choose the squab and my hubby had the veal. My squab was super stringy, gamey, and not tender. I gagged while  trying to eat it. After literally sawing at another piece, I gave up and gave the squab to my hubby. Even my hubby who would eat all things meat left it behind after a few bites, which speaks volume in my book. The veal was nothing like Joel Robuchon's. It was the opposite in fact. The veal  was super chewy and flavorless at GS. As for the holiday logs that was provided during the last course of the meal, it  lacked something..I strongly believe the pastry chef forgot the sugar as it seems like I was sucking on lemons with every bite of the kiwi passion fruit log. I also left behind a dry tasteless Madeleine. This was committed by me, someone who has a second stomach just for desserts!

Lastly, the sommelier came by at the beginning of the dinner with a cart of chilled champagne bottles pushing it on us, when we politely declined, his face morphed into a sour face. Not cool. Same when he tried to push the wine list. My husband has a bad liver and his doc told him to lay off the booze so no alcohol for him. It's no fun drinking alone so none for me either.

My regret was not going back to L'Atelier, a place we tried a couple years back, instead, as the experience there was a mind blowing. Something that I hoped GS to be but it was not even close. It is our fault  bc our motto is that  there are so many restaurants to try so we should always try something new. 

I have to say maybe GS had an off day, or I had too high a hope, but when people are coming to your restaurant expecting a two Michelin star experience and you're asking them to match the experience in dollars, you better bring it everyday. You may be making a first impression that will be transferred via word of mouth, or in this case, Yelp. Although I may be a nobody to GS, but hopefully this nobody was able to provide another nobody, like me, who's looking for an honest opinion, with an informed decision.

I came to Vegas making mostly losing bets at the crap/Black 
Jack tables knowingly, however I didn't know that going to Guy Savoy was such a gamble: A bet in which I lost $$$$$ big time.",oijLh2Cul5I2whDzZd8-Dg,1,0,3,tOWHOG3xsSc2tqfwyImgiA
1656757,2016-05-30,4,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Guy Savoy is a 2 Michelin star restaurant that is located inside Caesars Palace on the 2nd floor.  Making reservations was fairly easy.  I just logged into my Open Table account.  This restaurant does require that you make a deposit so for those flakers out there, there are consequences if you decide to not show up.

On the night of the reservation, I had high expectations, but I did not expect to be treated like a queen for the night.  I think they definitely deserve their third star.  My bf and I had reservations for 1915.  We were immediately seated inside a room that was fairly private without having to request for it.  Outside our window, we could see the Eiffel tower of the Paris hotel right across the street which made it feel like we were really dining in Europe.

Next, a woman offered to check my coat in and she even brought out a little stool for me to place my purse on so that my purse would not be touching the ground.  What?!?  That's cray cray!

Our waiters were amazing.  Our glasses were never empty.  They kept coming by and filling up our glasses.  You could also tell that everyone was on the same page and worked well as a team because it didn't matter which table you were responsible for.  Everyone took care of everyone's customers.

I went with the prix fixe Innovation-Inspiration Menu which was $375 per person is a 14 course meal that lasts anywhere from 3-4 hours.  If you plan on dining here, make sure you empty out your bowels and don't plan on attending any shows afterwards otherwise I can guarantee that you will miss them.

After the 1st course, the waiter rolled this humongous bread cart!  This bread cart had the most unusual breads on it.  It had bread that had bacon on the inside, bread that had lemon flavors to it, and etc.  Our knowledgeable waiter, Adrien, was able to recommend which breads went best with which courses.  I've heard of pairing wines with your meals, but never pairing bread with your meals!  Don't get too greedy, save room for the rest of the courses.  Trust me, you will be super stuffed!

Having a meal with this many courses can get exhausting.  I needed a bathroom break and I asked Adrien for directions to the bathroom.  He didn't verbally tell me where it was.  Instead, he said, ""Right this way"" and escorted me there personally!  WTH?!?  Am I being punk'd?  He took me to a room that had a glass door and opened it for me.  I stepped inside this room that had two sinks in there.  I'm thinking, um... seriously, I have to pee and there is no toilet in sight.  Where is it?  Two sinks is not going to solve the problem.  This was when I noticed a ""secret"" door that pretty much blended in with the wall.  I walked in there and that was when I saw the toilet.  Phew!  Thank God I didn't have to take drastic measures.  The bathroom was super clean and there were no paper towels in sight.  There was a basket to the side of the sink with real towels to dry off my hands.  After I was done, I started heading back to my seat.  I am a speed walker, but before I could make it all the way, I swear, a random waiter saw me coming out of the bathroom and dashed out of nowhere to escort me back to my seat.  He pulled out my chair for me and placed the napkin on my lap.  Damn!  I like how you guys roll, Guy Savoy!  A girl could totally get used to this! :)

Savoy's Innovation-Inspiration Menu was basically like eating art.  Each dish was beautifully presented using unique/exotic ingredients, and tasted amazing!  By the time we were done with our 14 courses, we were stuffed, but the chef kept bringing out more samples for us.  Then as we were leaving the restaurant, we were given to-go boxes that contained a small size baked good on the inside.  Damn.  I'm hella stuffed, I don't need that.  Thanks though.

Yes, Michelin star restaurants are expensive so save up!  However, it is a once in a lifetime experience so if you get the chance to go to one, I highly recommend it!  You'll be so spoiled and feel so special that you'll never see eating out the same way again.  Guy Savoy is a great place to make reservations to for special occasions!",2Hs4XM3ENjn5WTNfjM86-A,5,3,5,SAOZn1NJjPQ7fZd9s8ijSA
1661437,2011-02-20,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Let me set some disclaimers before I get lampooned for my comments.  I enjoy hole in the walls over fine dining any day, but at the same time, I can be won over by fantastic flavors and textures nonetheless.  So, if you're not of the same mindset as me, prolly skip this review all together.

Guy Savoy has been on my radar for the last years for it's glowing reviews, so being that it was our first time here, we went for the motherlode, the 10-course Menu Prestige.  From our experience with previous tasting menus, we knew that we were in for a marathon of eating, so readied our stomachs.  (I apologize in advance for my sub par illustrations of each elegant dish, but that's all my food vocabulary can do.  No fancy culinary terms here.)

Pre-meal bonus!
- Foie gras with a teeny tiny piece of toast - teeny tiny toast but with a big burst of fattyliciousness.  
- Waffle with melty Parmesan Reggiano Cheese - savory but light and fluffy
- Cream of..... - There were so many cream of somethings, I forgot what this was, but the surprise mini crabcake hiding underneath was fantastic!  Crabby seafood essence with just the right seasoning.

10-course Menu Prestige
1.  ""Eggs All Truffle"" - Creamy decadence. First of the theme of Black Truffle.  Thin slices of toast buttered with black truffle butter were paired so that we could dunk the tastiness into the yolky tastiness of the quail egg.
2.  Langoustines in ""Cold Steam""  (Tuna Carpaccio) - This was more visually appealing than delicious.  The cold steam was very amazing, but I'm not sure I appreciated the full flavors of the dish.
3.  Crispy Sea Bass with Delicate Spices - call me a biased but this one did not impress me probably because it was more dry than delicate.
4.  ""Colors of Caviar"" - oh so rich!  It was only the 4th course in and I was already full!      
5.  Foie-Gras ""en Papillotte"" and Radish Bouillon - The 4"" mound of fat they call Foie-gras picked my appetite back up.  Can never have too much of foie gras.  It was juicy and oozed with fat.  Beware, not for the weak of heart and those who fear fat.
6.  Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup - a puree of artichoke with thin shavings of black truffle and parmesan reggiano, paired with....
7.  Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter - This was fantastic!  The brioche was flaky and buttery and when you add some black truffle butter on it, you can beat the texturegasmic experience.
8.  Roasted Poussin (Chicken), Black Truffle Potato Puree, Seasonal Vegetables Braised in Poussin Jus - The black truffle potoato puree was super creamy and of course, black truffle made it exponentially delicious.  Is it blasphemous of me to say that costco whole roasted chicken was juicier and more succulent?  gasp!
9.  Seasonal Vegetables Braised in Veal Jus - Of all the dishes, this was probably the most disappointing.  The vegetables were too salty and limp.
10. Fine Cheeses - Almost done!  The cheeses are very full of flavor and quite enjoyable.  It's too bad we were filled to the brim!
11.  Apple - Our pre-dessert palate cleanser of apple sorbet and another with apple ""caviar"" and foam.  Again, I'm not usually a fan of fruity desserts, so could not enjoy to the fullest.
12.  Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline and Chicory Cream - There's always room for dessert, and for a dessert as fine as this, I was in chocolate heaven.  I love how the creamy chocolate fondant paired so well with the crunchy praline layer.

Conclusion:  I think our stomachs lost the battle of gluttony in the end, but in a good way.  Filled to the brim with quality ingredients and exceptional service.  (We definitely had a laugh at our own etiquette mistakes and one waiter's inability to disguise his disgust at us commoners for those mistakes)  Excellent fine dining.  Sure beat my Joel Robuchon experience!  Is it worth one visit?  Yes.  Is it worth going back?  Meh, I rather have my hole in the wall or go to the more ""casual"" French dining with Le Atelier de Joel Robuchon.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,5,1,4,7qmPH39fjnPkDxrTB_Sscg

majestic dining room,  restaurant guy savoy is an experience to be awed by, not just a meal.  i just wanted to sample a la carte, so i had the foie gras en papillote, scallops, and cheese sampler.
i was started with the artichoke black truffle soup in a tiny sterling silver saucer.  the delicate yet creamy, savory and earthy taste is almost indescribable.   the foie gras en papillote had a super rich, unctuous texture, and the radishes provided great contrasting texture
and was very refreshing as it cut through the fattiness of the liver.
i must say that i prefer the seared, carmelized flavor profile better then this type of subtle, delicate preparation, but it was nevertheless very good.  scallops were cooked perfectly, but nothing special.
it may sound like blasphemy, but IMHO the seared scallops with lemon butter sauce on top of angelhair pasta at RM seafood was better.  it was a treat to sample the different unpasteurized french cheeses, and my favorites were the creamier camambert -type cheese presented in the beginning.
technically flawless preparation and immaculate, articulate plating
left me in awe of the chef's creativity and artistry.  i can not wait to go back and try the full 10 course prestige tasting menu.",-FjLaUdIRV3I0Pv8i-ICfQ,0,0,4,ioYWWsGsjcvddvXV7r7PRQ

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

It was just very different than any other fish we've tasted. Everything else about the dish was phenomenal including the broth. Unfortunately, despite noticing our dissastifcation with the fish, it was not taken off our bill nor were we offered a replacement.

That being said, the décor inside the restaurant is all nice and everything but they have no control of what's outside the windows.

Been on the fence about GS for seven years now.  THIRD time's a charm.  Maybe my palate is more grown up and I stopped comparing it to all the bells and whistles at other fine dining on the Strip.  

I really enjoy delicately small, less salt-laden and dense courses now.  GS satisfied all these parameters.  

Starting freebies: foie sandos, bread is still a bit dry for my taste, liver very good.  This was pretty much the theme throughout the meal for the breads.  DRY.  I don't care, I'm not here for the bread cart or the dessert cart.  However, the parmesan 'waffle' was quite good.  

All of the courses were well balanced, full of textural/temperature aspects, all keeping my interest, but not to the point where it's cliché:

-fried scales as a topping on the fish
-freeze dried olives
-used the minute microwave cake method for savory textures
-cooked salmon on ice
-foie managed to be light with a pickled turnip and washed in a ham cantaloupe soup
-dried watermelon
-smoked sabayon poured out of an eggshell
-waygu crusted with sesame and tarragon, but amazingly, did not overwhelm
-beautifully whipped light ricotta, kissed the lips
-green tomatoes as a dessert paired expertly with mascarpone
-a reimagined haute peach melba, featured a mango chip, screaming summer
-earl gray, lime and crème anglaise sorbet finished the evening off perfectly

Ending freebies: each person goes home with a bourbon cake in a box and has a selection of housemade candies.  I enjoyed all.  Better than the cart.  

Skip: bread and dessert carts.  Really forgettable.  Save room for the amazing mushroom brioche that comes with the famous artichoke truffle soup, it was perfect this time around.  

Service was on pointe throughout the evening.  A special touch was the chef coming out to personally check on us and prepare one of the courses tableside.  One improvement would be the demeanor of the sommelier, please just listen to your diners, instead of over explaining and making us feel slighted.  The pairings are top notch and a steal at $200/pp, almost every course came with a glass.  

The courses are not the prettiest in terms of color contrasts or edible flowers strewn throughout, but what they are lacking in presentation, is made up with taste and textures.  Subtle, demure, classic with a twist, gorgeous food.  

Go with the Innovation Menu.  My new favorite on the Strip.  I already booked our next visit.  Happily moving GS to my Vegas Go's list.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,6,3,5,uKBqUpsZSuYEuWP_2zqNsA

-top notch wine service (in a completely different league)
-overall service: Professional, attentive, accomodating, formal, friendly, and welcoming, all at the same time. NEVER pushy and cocky
-Guy Savoy's signature dishes

However, Guy Savoy is not your type of place, if you look for something pretty, well-decorated or trendy. In fact, initially, I was dissapointed with overall atmosphere of the restaurant. I know many diners may have felt that way. Too simple for Micheline two~three stars. There is no music and no flower display, and no vibrant color. It is not as romantic as other michelin star or 5 diamond restaurants. The plate presentation is not the prettiest. But it is Guy's way.He lets the food, wine and service speak for themselve. And they delivered. 

Bottom line: If I had $400~500 to spend for fine food and wine in Vegas, would I spend it for one dinner at Guy Savoy or two dinners at Twist, Picasso, Le Cirque, Alize, MIna, Andre, or L'Atelier??? It is a tough call. 

P.S. $260 for the 9-course signature menu may be expensive, but not over-priced. Considering ingredients, labour, and 3.5hours of service time, I highly doubt they make any significant profit from just selling food.

Guy Savoy in Paris is an experience!  Unfortunately Guy Savoy in Las Vegas is just a meal, and an expensive one to boot.

The ungracious experience begins as you walk through the doors and are barked at by the host and hostess who do not have the courtesy to allow guests to fully enter the doors before immediately questioning you about reservations.  The gate guards may not let you through without them. 

The entry is inviting as is the bar and lounge where a lovely fireplace glows.  Unfortunately, the dining room is severe and leaves much to be desired. The environment is not only cold, but is also quite stark with the feel of a dingy New York loft apartment on a gloomy day.  The high ceilings give the room a cavernous, mine shaft effect and the restaurant has no music whatsoever.  

The lack of ambiance and music leave nothing but the waiters and food as your stage for enjoyment.  Unfortunately, the stress of the service afflicts and burdens the staff which, in turn, creates a stressful meal for the patrons.  

I have enjoyed two splendid meals at Guy Savoy in Paris and was truly excited to experience this restaurant, without having to take an international flight.  

While the recipe's remain authentic, the experience is not one I never ever wish to repeat.  Our dinner for 2, all in including tip was over $800. This was without an expensive bottle of wine but with wine pairings, by the glass, poorly executed and selected by our ""deer in headlights"" sommelier.

Dear Mr. Guy Savoy, I am heartily disappointed.  Perhaps it is time to take a greater hand in your US representation.  The meal, the experience, the dining room and ESPECIALLY the service were a complete miss - I should have NEVER gone here and should have gone right to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel to dine in Twist by Pierre Gagnaire.

Unfortunately, it was perhaps the WORST dining experience of our lives. The foods were okay...but it was the worst service we've had at a Michelin restaurant. I was truly unimpressed with the snooty attitude shown us.


1. My husband BIT on something hard and round piece while having Foie gras. We showed it to the waiter, who did not think it was a big deal. When we asked one of the server, he said ""we dont know what it is. We are sorry"".  So I said ""how could you guys not know what is inside of food?"" and then I called manager and he went to the kitchen and finally got back to me after 20minutes and said ""well it could be almond or crystallized sugar"". My husband is 28 years old young man, who has very healthy teeth. If it was an almond or sugar, he probably was able to chew it without spit out. It is a big shame that they didn't know what it was...especially... when you have 2 stars. 

2. When we got a chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert, we found clear 4 fingerprints on top of chocolate cake. I'm going to post pictures of this. Of course, we sent it back and got the new dessert and.. the ice cream was not soft at all and it was hardly frozen. It was actually very soft for the first one.. They prob just made it so quick to sent it out to us. No apologies from any staff.  We were very taken aback by this as we have previously dined at multiple michelin star restaurants in many different cities and not been treated in this manner.

3. I do not eat Foie gras. When we were looking over the menu, I've asked our waiter to bring something else for me. When I got my dish, I was a little surprised... They brought me a CABBAGE WRAP(just potato inside). I was more expecting a seafood or some kinds of meat dish. Not a cabbage wrap. 


I expected far better for a $780 dinner for two. They need to train their staff better especially the kitchen staffs and the servers. And, if anyone from this establishment reads or cares about this poor performance and lack of interest...shame on you!

The service was absolutely outstanding and was really the highlight of the experience.  The exception was the sommelier who informed me that he would have difficulty providing an adequate wine pairing for the signature menu based on my preference of only red wines.  The result would be serving the same wine for more than one course, which I said was fine.  He then proceeded to ""pour me a little extra"" at one course and not pour me any wine for the next!  When I pay for a wine pairing I expect a glass of wine with each course, even if it is the same wine as the last  course.

We had the signature tasting and the food was nothing spectacular.  The chestnut dish was my favorite, it was creative and delicious as was the truffle and artichoke soup.   The beef course and cheese course was nothing more than you would find at any top rate restaurant.

2140405,2017-05-17,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"One of the most memorable meals of my life.  We chose to do the signature menu, which was more expensive than a la carte, but less expensive than the innovation inspiration menu. We had 9 courses, but it felt like a lot more than that with extra dishes in between. You can park at the Augustus tower valet and take the elevator/stairs directly up to the restaurant. 

I was a little shocked by the sommelier in the beginning, because he came by in the beginning with a cart full of champagne offerings. We hadn't even received the menu yet, and we weren't sure if any of it was included in the tasting menus. We were glad we didn't get any, because we ordered the wine pairing with our tasting menu, which I highly recommend. 

We started with the chefs first starter, which wasn't even part of the menu. It was a trio of 3 bites, and had so much flavor in each bite. There was a bread cart that had so many different types of bread, it was a little overwhelming but in a good way. We asked our waiter to make recommendations, and he ended up pairing different breads with our tasting menu which was an amazing experience in itself.

Next came the Colors of Caviar, Peas all around, and red mullet, which I think the red mullet was the stand out dish out of these starters. They went above and beyond, and actually fried the scales to add extra texture to the dish. It was absolutely amazing.

We got the lobster and wagyu supplements, so we were able to try both options of the tasting menu. Honestly, I dont think they were necessary, but they were definitely delicious. We've never had A5 Wagyu before which was perfectly prepared, but we preferred the tenderloin. The sauce on the lobster was really flavorful and the lobster was cooked to perfection. The fois gras alternative was also really good too.

We also had their signature artichoke and black truffle soup, which was super rich and had truffle shavings and a truffle/mushroom brioche to accompany it.   We were definitely full at this point, but then the cheese cart rolls in.  There were so many different types of cheese, and some of them were really ripe. It was one of the strongest cheeses I've ever had, and I couldn't even finish some of the slices that we got.

Lastly, dessert. Their dessert cart was fully decked out. Cookies, rice pudding, chocolate mousse, madeleines, a variety of sorbets, etc. I really don't know what was included, because we were so full. Everything we tried was delicious. Then there was a coconut dessert and a plated chocolate dessert. I thought the coconut dish was interesting with the tapioca, but it tasted like a classic Vietnamese coconut chilled soup dessert.  The chocolate bar was really good. It had so many different textures, layers of praline with chocolate ganache topped with a candied hazelnut.

I really want to recognize our waiter, David, who made our first visit to Guy Savoy unforgettable. All the courses were timed perfectly, and the service was impeccable. He knew what we needed before we even had to ask, and recommended his favorites on the carts when we were overwhelmed.  He even put a candle on one of the desserts for my birthday!

This is of course white tablecloth fine dining, but the host was warm and welcoming and did a nice job of keeping the stuffiness out of our experience. He was happy to share information on the courses, pronunciation help and fun tidbits about his native France. The sommelier modestly agreed with my suggestion that he has one of the best jobs in existence, and offered perfect pairings for each of our courses. 

I won't go into detail on the food, but suffice it to say that my expectations were shattered over and over again with each course. I couldn't pick a favorite course if I tried. They flowed seamlessly from one to the next and my only complaint was that we didn't always have time to mentally digest and discuss what we'd just eaten before the next course was upon us. Perfect timing in the kitchen...bummer.

I was disappointed at the cold small bites given us as welcome gifts. Bread was over baked with thick black shell at bottom. Food on bread trolley and desert trolley were just OK, not worth a try when you are expecting good food. Together they lower the food quality in general. Chestnut all around is not for someone who just got a little cold by the downstairs AC and not hungary.  But the entree- duck with foie gras wrapped inside Swiss chart was fantastic! I wish I just had this only one dish for the dinner. Desert- Coconut cooked in 6 ways, not a good idea for this autumn season. The discovery tasting menu design is a failure- it should not start with a thick hot chestnut and end with cold icy coconut. It made my stomach not feeling well. I asked hot water to drink all along the dinner and an espresso in the end, got a little comfort.

This meal cost more than double the comparable meal at the best restaurant in the US, 11 Madison Park. Quality: variable. The first three courses (of 13) were solid 9s, but after that they all, categorically, devolved into less than 5 on a scale of 10. It's not really worth reporting them here, because they change frequently. But why would you ruin a piece of nice salmon by freezing it on dry ice? The wine paring was top notch, though.

One of the things this place advertises is their discrete service.  The conversation at our table of three was interrupted every single time when staff came to the table. I'm talking mid-sentence. Not even the courtesy of waiting for the person speaking to finish their sentence. The space itself has cathedral ceilings and even with only 3 tables occupied the conversation from nearby tables echoed throughout. The atmosphere does not lend itself to privacy or intimacy. The server's station was right behind the lattice wall from our table and the clanking of silverware and staff conversation added to the noise and made for a very clamorous evening. Of the food, I did enjoy the scallops done two ways but the caviar appetizer and the Turbot entree were utterly forgettable. Not a winner. Not worth it.

PS the bread server has the same schtick he gives every table. It was moderately amusing when he gave it to us but then to hear it again and again at each table, yikes. That's a small example of how unspecial the whole experience is.",Yj8VlwcQoALc9oH9PtMcHQ,1,0,3,-dj8dRRQUypzUJ5k2wZDug

Pumpkin Soup Winter Flavor was delightful 

Steam Cod & Licorice Flavor- I must add that I am typically not fond of licorice, but found this dish quite nice. 

My love ordered a beautifully presented veal shank w. seasonal vegetables & potato puree that the server brought out to showcase to us prior to serving it.

 Posh Dessert/ Pastry Trolleys for us to choose from at the end of our meal served w. Coffee or Tea was very nice & tasteful!

And after your course meal is completed, they brought over a dessert CART! I was like, are you guys kidding! Why didn't you bring that earlier before I was full D: LOL.

After our meal, the waiter took us to the kitchen for a tour. I was actually surprised on how small it was back there. I imagined this great big kitchen was required to make such amazing dishes.  

Overall: This place was amazing! Words can describe how great our dinner experience was. One thing I really liked about this restaurant was, even though it was extremely fancy and upscale.

For us, the valet is free since we stayed there for the night. Easy to find. There is a special elevator from the Flamingo side which will take you directly there. 

Once you are in there, the host will welcome you. They will give you some drinks while waiting for your table. The service is definitely 5 stars. Top notch as expected from this top restaurant. 

Menu: we tried seven course with caviar. Super delicious bread selections. Huge. I have to keep remind myself to stop since we do not want to get too full before our main course. They also have plenty of wine, champagne selections. Cannot go wrong with the selections! 

The steak is OK in my opinion. For some reason it was too salty, at least for me. My husband think it's perfect, he loves salty food. Portion is small but at the end of seven courses, we were so full. 

The desert, however are DELICIOUS. The chef greet us and gave us a complimentary home made macaroon, ice cream and chocolate in a gift bag to bring home. Love the extra attention.

Like many other yelpers have already said, Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon because of the fine dining French cuisine featuring renowned chefs. They both offer tasting menus as well as a la carte items. I really liked the decor in Guy Savoy. Very modern, sleek, with minimalist designs. We were seated in a private dining room, so it was nice and private. I didn't try the tasting the tasting menu, as some of the entrees looked more appealing to me than the items listed on the tasting menu. The meal started out with our server bringing out an over-the-top bread cart. I love bread, and anything that has carbs, so that was a plus for me. 

We had potato leek soup, lobster salad, sea bass, duck, and veal.

Potato Leek Soup: This wasn't on the menu, but was compliments of the chef. The potato leek soup didn't sound all that appetizing to me, but it was surprisingly good. It came in a tiny little cup, with another cup next to it, placed upside down. There with a little surprise underneath the upside down cup.
 
Lobster Salad: This wasn't worth it in my opinion. It was a couple pieces of lobster, paired with a couple chunks of ice berg lettuce. It was just okay, and really overpriced.

Sea Bass: This was one of the better entrees. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly, and the skin was crispy and flaky. The marinade was also pretty good.

Duck / Veal : I don't eat duck, so I can't review it, but the veal was pretty good. I normally don't eat veal but it was very flavorful and tender. 

After our meal, we were given little boxes of mini desserts. I didn't get to take any pictures, since I just opened them and ate them on the way out. I couldn't help it. They were just okay.. nothing to really rave about. 

Overall, service was great. Servers were very attentive, personable, and professional. But the prices were too high in my opinion. I've had better.

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

The layers of cuisine commingle beautifully with the service standards at Guy Savoy providing a world class experience. I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite moment however Adrian's spiels for the bread carts, mignardees cart, cheese cart certainly are highlights. From a cuisine standpoint the langostine and caviar with dashi as well as the rougie were favorites. The hare royal & artichoke soup while classic still ring true to not just the romance of classic French cuisine but are alive and delicious. Chef Julien has not just embraced the classic Savoy but the modern culinary components and hospitality as well, wonderful to see him out in the dining room interacting with the guests.

Upon looking upon and entering the large doors to the restaurant, it almost seemed that you are taken into an elite locate.  My friend and I were seated next to the window and magic began. 

Starting with the champagne cart service to the food. Everything was wonderful. I decided to forgo my non-dairy diet for this meal, to enjoy the true experience.   We both ordered the menu prestige and I had the special wine pairing. The waiter explained  each dish on arrival, as well as the wine pairing.   The bread cart server paired the bread with each dish for us so that it would complement each other.  Not paired with the dish was the bacon bread.  Not that I eat bacon a lot, but this bread was good. Nice, chunky pieces of bacon on the top of the little muffin. 

My favorite of the 10 course meal, though all were delicious, would be the Foie-Gras with radish leaves and the Artichoke and Black Truffle soup.  Both were rich and tasty. I died and went to heaven after eating the Foie-Gras dish and then died once again after finishing the soup.

The service here is excellent throughout the evening. When I asked for a take home menu, the waiter gave me the restaurant menu.   What a nice surprise touch.  

But the best surprise of this evening was Tyra Banks sitting right in back of my table.  She looked awesome.  When she and her guest sat down for dinner my friend and I were texting away to everyone.   

The only thing that I question is there dress code, as they require a jacket for men.  But as we left the restaurant, I saw a guy wearing a T-shirt with no jacket anywhere.

The staff was attentive and professional. There were at least 4 different people that serviced our table.  The restaurant was not only adequately staffed but the staff were knowlegeable when asked to recommend a wine from the wine list or when the bread and dessert cart came by your table.  I felt well taken care of by the staff.

As for the food, our table went with the Black Truffle Prestige menu ($420/pp).  Truffle can be found in every dish (except the dessert course) in this 8 course meal.  I was in TRUFFLE HEAVEN!  You have to really enjoy truffles to go with this menu selection.  My favorite dishes from this 8 cours meal were: Trubot roasted on the bone and black truffle mousseline, Foie-Gras ""en papillote"" and black truffle bouillon, Artichoke and black truffle soup with toasted mushroom broiche and black truffle butter (was told that this was the dish Guy Savoy was known for) and the Comte mousse black truffle and the tropical dessert (fresh mangos).

Adding to this memorable dining experience was having the gorgeous and very talented Chef Matthew come to our table to shave fresh truffle on our plates.  Towards the end of our meal, I had the opportunity to take a picture with Chef Matthew where he makes all the magic happen - the kitchen!  Although the moment was brief, it was exciting and fun.

2578237,2010-08-06,13,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Joel Robuchon or Guy Savoy?

For us, Guy Savoy :)

How did we decide? It really came down to the menus. Yes, we analyzed each menu down to the T and ultimately decided Guy Savoy had everything we loved. Here was our chance to finally try it since my bf has wanted to dine at Guy Savoy in Paris. Instead, we opted for Guy Savoy's Le Chiberta. We LOVED it so we knew Guy Savoy in Las Vegas was the right choice.

DECOR: Located away from all the clamor, Guy Savoy was the opposite of what I expected. When you think of Las Vegas, you think of fancy, colorful, exquisite (practically gaudy) decor. However, when we walked in, everything was very minimal. It felt like we were inside a villian's lair - dark, gray space, tall, never-ending ceilings and a long sexy fire place in the Bubble Bar. However, simple colorful artworks hung on the walls and beautiful bright colorful crystal ware sat on top of the tables. It also felt depressing but I absolutely loved it. Like a mini getaway from the craziness of Vegas.

Menu Prestige, 7/31/10 (MY BIRTHDAY, BABY)

Tomatoes in Iced Gelee - I have never, NEVER in my life had a favorite dish that was not some sort of meat. This was my absolute favorite dish. Though the menu online says oysters, I didn't mind at all. I can't believe how well this dish was made. Every slice of tomato was delicate and full of flavor. It's like each slice had the flavors of 10 fully ripped tomatoes. Delicious.

Langoustines in ""Cold Steam"" - This dish was not only very tasty but visually stunning. After the dishes were explained, they added liquid to steam the lobster meat right in front of us!

Crispy Sea Bass - I don't even like fish but this dish was so good. Light, perfectly cooked, moist with a flavorful crispy skin.

Colors of Caviar - Absolutely beautiful, both presentation and taste.

Foie Gras - They brought out these bloated pouches, poked them right in front of us and inside was our steamed foie gras! It came with these bitter greens which I didn't care for. But foie gras? YES.

Artichoke & Black Truffle Soup - I was sooo excited for this dish but it ended up falling a little lat for me. My bf soaked up each drop with the croissant-like bread that came with it. Woody flavor with a rich artichoke taste. Salty from the pieces of parmesan cheese. Good, not mindblowing.

Sweetbreads - We actually ended up switching out the veal chop dish for the sweetbreads. LOVE sweetbreads! Lightly crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. So tender. Wonderful light sauce. Think high end chicken nuggets.

The Vegetable - A few carrots and such. Nothing great but excellent plating...and a breather from what's to come.

Fine Cheeses - WOOOOOOW. Cheese cart was awesome! I had 3 blue cheeses and 3 mild cheeses. Absolutely love the blue cheeses. YUMMY!!

Strawberries - Who doesn't like strawberries? Little cubes of strawberry ""jello"" and basil...so pretty and delicious.

Sorbet - Peach something. Heaven in my mouth. Soooooo goood.

Chocolate - They surprised me with a birthday dessert - dark chocolate and hazelnut. YES, soooo good. Their dessert cart was CRAZY good. I had 3 pieces and the server insisted I have more!! Rice puddings, sorbets and truffles of all sizes.

Wine - Their wine list was as thick as 2.5 Harry Potter books. Kid you not, that thing had its own stool. We chose a pouilly fume and the server was so kind, he kept the wine label for us in the form of a card!!

Breads - Yes, Guy Savoy has its own bread cart and bread pairing if you're interested!

Service was perfect. Very accommodating, helpful, kind, warm and friendly. Our main server (a very tall man) was so sweet! I wish I could remember his name but honestly, it was so unbelievably good. I just might return. Besides, their Bubble Bar serves the same food at a fraction of the price!

The staff was welcoming -- especially the 2 chefs who came to our table (one to prepare the salmon, the other just to see how we were doing). They were warm and funny -- not at all stuffy and pretentious, as I expected.

Also, I know things on the menu are expensive, but Evian for the table was $10 (we went through a few bottles), and there are wines on the wine-list for $15 - $20.  Champagne by the glass at $30 !  So yeah -- the truffle soup is $75, but at least they have wines available for a surprisingly reasonable price!  (note: of course, there are way, way more expensive wines offered, ha ha -- we just went for the cheaper ones, and they were great).

The bread cart was just as great as others have said -- the server even recommended bread ""pairings"" to go with specific dishes we had ordered!",AeqRXsmY1iKMTh8fAFi6nw,2,2,5,5JqIJHzGWMpdH7E5gdDMRw

Our meal started with a fantastic amuse and then went right into our first course. We ordered the Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde, Foie Gras and Artichoke w/ Black Truffle Jus, This soup was one of the best soups i've ever had. Picture attached. Oysters three ways was excellent presentation but lacked the punch we expected. The Foie Gras with bitter infusion was amazing. Fantastic flavors and perfect technique.

For our entrees, we had the Veal, the Duck and one of the best meat parties in existence. This dish is no longer offered and i can't remember the name, but it was a trio of game birds and while it was being prepared in a ""stone dish"" it was cemented shut with bread. When you see this, you know the flavors are being infused into each succulent piece of meat. This was one of the best dishes i've had in a while. 

Our desserts consisted of the trio of coconut which was in a delicate glass with three preparations of coconut, the decadent dessert cart (one of the best i've ever seen) and the ""raspberry"" which is served in a type of shot glass with raspberry creme, coulis and raspberry pearls.

Overall, service was spot on. The food was worth the price. The wine list comes out in a library like novel that would be considered a Tome of Libations. If there is one meal on a bucket list, make this restaurant a must if you don't mind the dent into the wallet.

They're still terrific; it just felt like they were spread a little thin (especially at these prices). As their wine list is intimidating to me, we chose their latest menu option - 5 courses with wine pairings. As most of the wines had vintages and the price was very high we trusted them to pick the wines. Turns out these weren't the best wines (not bad, but again, at these prices, you expect more). The langoustine tartare with golden ostera caviar and poached-fried quail egg was exquisite. The version with salmon tartare, not so much. The Japanese Wagyu was amazing. Unfortunately, they switched our orders. Mine was served too rare, my partners the opposite. The bread cart and the dessert cart both contain delicious options and are both over the top excessive, more than you need, but less than they were.

I came here for one reason, Krug.  I had called to see if a reservation was required to have some bubbly at the Bubble Bar (where they poured Krug by the glass) and was told that it was not necessary and that they look forward to having us.  When we arrived, we were told that the Bubble Bar was sold out for the evening.  The hostess was quite gracious and apologetic when I told her about the phone conversation I had regarding reservations.  She suggested we talk to the manager and then guided us to the restaurant.  

I approached the manager who was at the front desk, informed him of the situation and without hesitation, he led us to their private patio. It was beautiful and romantic. The manager served us personally. He brought us two glasses of Krug and surprised us with three canapes.  They were delicious.

2891347,2017-11-14,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Probably one of the best dining experiences for me in USA. Definitely one of my top Michelin experiences! My bf and I have dined Michelin in our hometown SF, NY, Japan, France, Italy and Spain. I think this was our first exposure to Las Vegas Michelin, though.

I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are willing to spend. Everything about it was a terrific dining experience - the food, the selection, the quality, the presentation, the execution overall, and the service. I can't think of anything to make this place better.

Food:
We ended up getting the Prestige Tasting Menu. You could order entrees too, but we wanted a little bite of everything from Guy Savoy. So we invested $349/person...but to be honest, every bite was worth it. Also, since we came in Nov, this was also truffle season. They had a special extra course of White Truffle Risotto, and they let us order a half portion, and split between 2 people (to make sure we wouldn't get too full). Here are my favorite life-changing courses:

-Langoustine with Dashi, hibiscus and caviar - WOW! This was probably one of my favorites for the entire meal. The langoustine was cooked so perfectly - so soft, and I believe it was souveed, but tasted almost like a sashimi. I also loved the sauce it came with - the dashi had a citrus accent to it. It paired so well.
-Red Salmon - another unique dish. The salmon was prepared on a salt block, which ""seared"" the fish, but it was still sashimi. We were able to try a ""before"" and ""after"" salt sear. Both were wonderful. Salmon came from Ireland. 
-Red Mullet - I loved this fish course too. They fried the skin of the red mullet, which was nice and salty, but balanced well with the buttery sauce. It also came with a noodle called Fregula Sarda, which were little al dente, tiny, cooked balls of pasta. Amazing!
-White Truffle Risotto - hopefully you will be able to enjoy this during truffle season like we did. I think it was $125/full portion, but we just wanted to taste it, so they let us order a half portion. OMG. The truffle was so amazing...very strong, so orgasmic. Straight from Alba, Italy. It went INCREDIBLY well with the risotto. This was another highlight for me. We also didn't feel too crazy full after the meal too, so it's definitely doable to order the half portion and share!
-Presentation of the champagne cart, bread and butter cart, cheese cart, dessert cart - just so much fun to look at!

Those were all my life-changing favorites. Every other dish we had was good, but not life-changing. These would include seared foie gras with uni (good, but somehow the uni taste got lost), artichoke and black truffle soup (their specialty, but I can't really remember how this dish tasted), octopus (beautifully presented with dry ice fog, but I Octopus tasted plain and slightly overcooked IMO. My bf liked it though), and desserts (wasn't really a huge fan of the desserts - just nothing special). 

Ambiance:
It was a very quiet evening (Friday night, Veteran's Day weekend), and throughout our meal, there were probably only 7 other tables present total. It's this large dining room, that kind of feels like a hall. We did have a slight view of the Bellagio fountains, but only a tiny bit. We were thinking, too bad the restaurant wasn't on the top floor, so we could enjoy it. 

Service: 
So excellent! Everyone was so friendly, and very personable. For instance, for the Octopus dish, they said ""we know you're visiting from the fog, but here's our dish...."" and poured out the foggy dry ice. In general, the service is what you'd expect from every Michelin restaurant. Attentive, professional, and quick to notice small details (such as, if you get up to go to the restroom, they'll show you where it is as soon as you get up, and also the napkin is folded by the time you get back). 

Verdict:
Overall, some of those dishes were once again LIFE CHANGING. I know not everyone can spend $350/meal, but if you are celebrating something special in Vegas (our 9.5 anniversary), this is a great choice.",i5Cm53q0pmklQsX8soi3tw,3,1,5,TruDhs9Toy_8j6lk64A6PA
2930795,2014-09-13,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"In reviewing Guy Savoy one has to compare them to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant. The restaurant I compare it to is Le Bernardin in New York City.

It is very very close. We had a private dining room with the classic tasting menu along with the wine paring.  One would expect perfection and they were in the perfection circle of restaurants. The dinner was over whelming in amount of food but everything was fantastic. The 3 dessert courses put us over the top. I liked most of the wine parings but did not love them. But my taste might not be typical. The beef course was indescribable as well as the foie gras. The wine parings for those were perfect.  The different breads really enhanced the meal so let the bread sommelier bring the appropriate bread for each coast. And let the Captain choose your cheeses for you. You will be rewarded. It was a classic French Restaurant without the arrogance and affectation. 

Now you are asking, why Michelin 2 stars?

Probably because it is not in NYC and in Las Vegas.

In comparing it to Le Berardin, the atmosphere and service were great but not as smooth and relaxed as LB. We were treated as regulars at LB on our first time, not so much as Guy Savoy. It deserves 5 stars. I will go there again in a heartbeat, it deserves it's 3rd star. You all should try to experience Guy Savoy",k8cSnmzcdFFbbiE0HK89-A,4,4,5,aQXB4c1oo5Cipy8Na9xfow

That's not exactly a bad thing. On the contrary, the experience was exactly as I expected. However, the food lacked a something, je ne sais quoi, as the french would put it. 

I was there as a party of six, and we went with the menu prestige. There was plenty of truffles, caviar, and fois but nothing is standing out as I'm writing this. I'm having a hard time singling out a memorable bite while having no trouble recalling the same from similar restaurants of the same caliber. 

Actually, I do remember the dessert cart as crazy stupid. It was filled with an assortment of goodies from macarrons to rice pudding in shot glasses. But by that point of the meal, none of us was able to stomach much more. 

There's also something about dropping $400 per person in these times that just feels a little wrong. I can justify it if I was at Guy Savoy in Paris, but Vegas? I don't know, left an artificial taste in my mouth.",9WP8IDc4yuuj94qZk_2eBg,4,4,4,VvSu_T8_80nkFX6ABe48bg

We were greeted by a very friendly staff. They took care of our personal belongings and explained the menu to us in great detail. The service was friendly but professional at the same time. We were seated next to a huge glass window so the view was nice as well.

The food was nothing but amazing. My friend went for the sea bass. The skin was crispy and delicious. The fish still had its scales on but they were very crispy and light. (They almost had the texture of rice Krispies) The fish was flaky and soft and the sauce was sweet and savory. I opted for the special of the day which was a combination of lobster and waygu beef. The lobster was cooked perfectly. The beef was cooked perfectly as well. It was a perfect medium rare, and it melted like butter. Everything was perfectly seasoned and made to perfection.

http://eatsporkjew.com/restaurants/guy-savoy-the-lost-art-of-storytelling/

1.) don't plan on ordering dessert, and make sure you save room for it. As a ""thank you"" for dining at Guy Savoy, they roll out an entire dessert cart which has everything from cakes, to puddings, to mousses, to cookies, to ice cream, to candies, etc. And it's all complimentary and you can have as much as you'd like. 

2.) Try to make a reservation on the earlier side of the evening. The reason for this is that you want to have access to all of their delicious fresh baked breads. They have a bread cart with a lot of different bread types, and apparently, their bacon bread is the most amazing carb-tastic bite you'll ever have. But they only make about 36 rolls a day, and they're not used to say ""no"" to their guests. By the time we got the bread cart for a 7:45pm reservation, all the bacon bread was gone. I wasn't too upset about this, but it's just something to think about. Believe me, you'll get plenty of delicious food to eat. 

3.) If you're lucky, and I think you just need to ask, you can visit the kitchen and see the private dining table in the back. It was cool to do this. 

4.) if you're a dinner party of two, order a la cart, and ask them to split each dish for serving. And this is a testament to how amazing the service is at a restaurant like this, but when they split the dishes, they actually serve you a little more of each one. A lesser restaurant would literally just split a single dish, and both people would miss out on the effect of a full plate with the fantastic presentation.

this restaurant named after their star chef and owner, guy savoy. it was the first runner-up of the best restaurant by paris zagat survey. we had to book 6 weeks in advance before we arrived in paris. 
shortly after we were seated, mr. savoy himeself came over and shook hands with my wife and me. he is famous but friendly. after greeting, the amazing taste journey started.
the mananger recommended the awards-winning heaven-sent artichoke truffle soup. the aroma of artichoke and truffle made me want to savour it in my mouth forever. swollowing felt like a sin. breese chicken and pigeon from eastern franace were roasted withour seasoning of any cream or broth. only the best of the best is bold enough to do this.
before every dish, the bread boy pushed his silver trolley with over 30 types of bread in front of us. he explained how each bread complements the different dishes. as he talks, he cut and served the olive bread and salmon bread into bite-size portions. matching fine wine with great food is common, but this is the first time i have bread-matching. it's such an  experience.
before the dessert, they let us taste more than 10 ice creams, cotton candies and after the dessert, there were 7-8 chocolate snacks with sweet wine. it's more than wonderful.
the 4 hour dining was an unforgettable experience. parisian loves food as they love life. that's why in casablance, humphrey bogart said to ingrid bergman, ""we'll always have paris"" as she left him for good.

We were excited to try Guy Savoy because we are both Gordon Ramsay fans. Come on, this guy was Gordon Ramsay's teacher! As a true foodie, you gotta pay the price to visit the museum of food!

Ever since I had my last haute French dining experience at Joel Robuchon at MGM 4 or 5 years ago, I have been comparing all the fancy meals to what I had there. Robuchon has been my reference for fine dining. Guy Savoy is definitely up there, but it did not deserve a 5 stars... Don't get me wrong. I had the best dish in my life. It was found here... which I will explain later of course, but overall experience deserves only 4 stars.

We went up the grand staircase at Caesar's to the 2nd floor, make a right turn and saw 2 giant wooden French doors in front of us (see picture). As you can tell from the photo, there isn't any big sign for the restaurant. Turns out it's written in small words at the very top of the doors. So okay, we found the place. We pushed the door through and the hostess came out from the reception desk to our left to greet us and we were walked to our table. 

We sat down and started looking around. Wow, never seen such a crappy decor ever in a fancy restaurant. First, bad feng shui. Seriously, they should hire my mom's guy to redecorate the whole restaurant. Why would you place a table, actually the table we were sitting at, at the end of the hallway from the main entrance? We could feel the wind draft when the door was being opened and closed, and it's freaking cold in Vegas in the winter. Overall decor is subpar. We felt like it's an empty space in an industrial building with super tall ceiling filled with round tables covered by white table cloths paired with simple chairs. Walls were empty, except for a pretty colorful abstract painting with geometric shapes. Who knows and who cares if that's a million dollar painting. The whole dining room just looks bare and sad. Maybe I just personally prefer cozy atmosphere. I don't get this decor.

The service was great but not excellent. A few of the staff were friendly but there's this lady who hardly smiled. She sounded very professional with an accent (I suppose everyone there speaks French.) She understood the dishes and could give good recommendation. However, her attitude wasn't too friendly and welcoming. The bread guy and the wine guy were friendly and joked around with us too. For a 5 star restaurant, I wouldn't say the service was very attentive. Come on, in such a small restaurant, customers should not have to flag you down for anything. Your eyes should be on us. If we look up, you know we need you!

Food-wise... We had the parsley soup and crab cake as the amuse bouche. Amazingly refreshing and creamy. Wow, really? You can make parsley soup delicious? It's truly a bold attempt to make parsley soup given that this herb can be really pungent. Impressed! Not so much impressed with the bread though. No cold bread should be served. Period. I do like their olive bread, but I really wanna just microwave it in their kitchen. They offered salted and unsalted butter, both directly from France. Honestly, I don't think it's any better than our American or Irish butter. I had some really good local butter before that is comparable or even better than theirs. We ordered an appetizer (called ""entree"" in a French menu) to share. It's the artichoke and truffle soup. OH MY GOD. SO GOOD. We ordered one but they were kind enough to split it into two bowls for us. I don't think it's a good idea to order 2 soups of the same for $95 each... But I have to say, for the amount of truffle and the portion size, $95 is not a bad price. Man, the soup is just the God of Mushroom Soup. 

Moving onto the main courses. The best thing of the entire night. We ordered two different dishes - 1) Crispy sea bass with scales and skin in truffle foam 2) Pan-seared quail with truffle potato puree, carrot and turnip cannons served with truffle sauce. Yes, everything truffle! This is a true haute French cuisine! Wow, that sea bass was amazing. The scales and skin were so crispy that they were edible yet would not choke you. The fish was cooked perfectly and I don't know what magic they made with the sauce, it just completes the whole dish. 

Guy Savoy's pan-seared quail is the best dish of my life. 

Yes it deserves a whole line to itself. The quail was cooked medium, perfectly. Juicy, flavorful, cannot ask for more. The truffle potato puree made me feel like I was in heaven. So creamy, great earthy aftertaste, so decadent. The carrot and turnip cannons were cooked in a delightful sauce and stuffed with finely chopped vegetables. Together with the meat, potato puree and the herbs, you have the perfect bite. ($125) Skip the dessert. Not worth $30.

Guy Savoy and Marthieu Chartron are both genius chefs.",dKKvpFh7QrplB3e0EEh8Rg,4,3,4,Yq_wy6xEl6KvAz4zkEMCng

We ordered the truffle artichoke soup, surf & turf and the lobster. The soup had a smooth consistency which was paired nicely w/ shaves of parmesan and black truffle. The surf & turf consisted of Wagyu flown in from Japan that was accompanied w/ lobster and rigatone stuffed w/ bone marrow, mushroom and bean. Lastly, the lobster was the same dish as the surf & turf sans the turf part.

We skipped dessert because we were quite full. However, they did bring out a grapefruit tartine as it was my birthday. Thank you! We also met the chef towards the end of the meal. Very nice gentleman.",4OgPAPL0zCXmdmV5_oe3vQ,6,4,5,Kesjfow9vdTGSwPpDK-prw

The place:
There's something about high end restaurants that makes the entire dining experience all the more pleasant. The waiter was evidently from France, and the service was exquisite. I especially loved the classy decor and ambiance; heck, even their bathroom was nice!

The eats:
The food here was *mwah* si délicieux! Despite not being able to try their tasting menu this time (because $$$$$$$ so expensive), I thoroughly enjoyed every single dish here, and the meal was surprisingly filling. 
Upon sitting down and before we even ordered, the wine cart came and asked my friends and I if we would like any wine. We thought since it was thanksgiving, there's a reason to celebrate, and a glass of champagne would also be a nice accompaniment to our fancy meal, so we went for it. Now, beginner's mistake... That teeny tiny glass of wine costed us $50 each. :''''''( ....yeah, you can imagine the shock on my face when i saw the bill. 
ANYWHO, after we ordered, the bread cart (!!!) strolled by and each of us chose some bread: I loved every single type of bread I tried. Soon after, our waiter brought us some small bites and appetizers. The small bites were simply amazing, but not all that memorable in all honesty. Our appetizers, on the other hand, were heavenly.
- Artichoke and black truffle soup with toasted mushroom brioche and black truffle butter: the truffle shavings used in the soup was fragrant and the brioche was to die for! My friend and I shared one order of the soup, and we were glad we did that because the creamy soup did become too rich after a while. 
- Caviar: very creamy, very rich, SO YUMMY.
As for the entree, I ordered the salmon iceberg, and that was really good as well. The coolest part about the dish, however, was the fact that the chef cooked the salmon on dry ice right in front of us. The fish was so fresh and it melted in my mouth. :9
For dessert, Guy Savoy actually offered us earl grey sorbet to wash our palates. A bit sour for my taste, but then again, I'm not a huge fan of sorbets so there's quite a bit of subjectivity there (lol)...

The service:
Talk about good service, Guy Savoy has got it all. Well-trained waiters who knew everything there is to know about fine dining. (:",9ASQv7VhUZE6zJgyTXx75Q,6,3,5,i9CkwyZcPAYruy0RfJAMrw

This was my wife and I's first foray into the world of fine dining and we were thoroughly impressed.  We were pampered from the very beginning and had some of the best dishes we've ever tasted.  I had a white asparagus soup w/ black truffles and she had the vegetable ragout for starters.  Our main course consisted of a beautifully cooked squab and my wife had a 3 week old chicken w/ black truffles.  Our dumbest move was to split dessert, which was a chocolate hazelnut tort.  Our wine that evening (I forget the name of it) was the best wine we've ever had which was like a riesling.  They even gave us a tour of their kitchen.  We met executive chef, Damian Dulas, who graciously greeted us and took us for a tour around every nook and cranny.  We met the pastry chef and even got a look at my wife's meal being cooked.

Life?... Winnings?...

One of two eponymously named upscale French restaurants, we took the opportunity to dine here during our stay at the hotel.  Attire is less than formal, business casual is fine -- I noticed gentlemen were not even wearing jackets although their dining partners, the ladies were generally more elegant.  Speaking French only helps to shoot the breeze, but otherwise unnecessary;  it's Franc as opposed to Frank.  The ambiance was far simpler than I had first imagined in simple eggshells and warm brown trellises, towering yet understated.  Just look at the peekaboo salt and pepper holders on the table, playful...

Like a magic show, or perhap Cirque du Soleil, the amuse bouche just kept coming.  The first was handed to us on steel toothpicks.  The second had Parmagiano-Reggiano -- oops, this is supposed to be French.  The third was more hide and seek, a sweet corn bisque with a hidden surprise underneath the cup:  some sort of black truffle salmon mousse...

The cheese course as well as the dessert cart are not to be missed.  I'm pretty sure we had a Morbier, a comte, an epoisses, a Roquefort, a Camembert brie, and perhaps a Chaource, and yes Google to the rescue.  This is where the bread cart really shines when paired with the French cheeses...

I ordered a la carte and did not regret. The bread cart was amazing. If anything, I OB'd (over breaded), but the breads were so good!  Started with a foie gras bite then had a waffle. The amuse bouchée was a chilled corn soup with toasted quinoa and a tuna tartar. 

Started with the Mosaic of Organic Chicken, Foie Gras and Artichoke, Black Truffle Jus. It was delicious and had a perfect mix of the different ingredients. The second course was the truffle risotto. It was cooked al dente with lots of truffles shaved on top. Th waitstaff asked if I needed more risotto and truffles. What??? Who doesn't need more risotto and truffles. It was great.

Next had the Crispy Line Caught French Sea Bass with Delicate Spices and the Lobster, Ratatouille and Bone Marrow Raviolis, Carrot Purée and Natural Jus. Both we're wonderful but I preferred the lobster. I never had a waitstaff come to ask if I wanted more lobster but the waiter at Guy Savoy did. Of course I accepted. Lobster was fresh and succulent. Fish was crispy and flaky.

The final dish was Veal 3 Ways, Salsify and Chanterelles Jus. It was very good, especially the cheek, which was tender and melted in my mouth. The mushroom sauce was perfect for the meal.

This dinner rivaled the 3 Michelin star meals I have had in NYC and was better than some places that I have eaten at recently. I can't promise that you will get extra helpings of the things that you order but if you do, enjoy! From the service, ambiance and food, everything was perfect. I will

-Egg Black Truffle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#EXLSPvKcOOQyp-FjSuDNLw): This was very good, but also very rich, thick, and creamy.

Our server said he would package some items for us, but they ended up forgetting, which was disappointing.

The best part about dining at Guy Savoy is the service, which was impeccable. Everyone that we spoke to was warm and accommodating, and I wish the menu was more to our tastes (less rich foods, more vegetables). I actually got a stomachache the next day from this meal, since the dishes were so rich, which never happens. However, my friends and I were still happy that we got a mini tour of the kitchen, and that we got to meet Chef Mathieu Chartron. I don't think I would come back for the price unless the menu was drastically different, but would recommend you come at least once if you're a lover of French food. The meal takes about 2.5-3 hours, but if you let them know ahead of time that you need to be out by a certain time, they definitely try their best to accommodate.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,4,0,4,onTAhUCFDJt6BQt_1Bw8fw

Also known as the ""Home of the $68 Bowl of Soup"", Guy Savoy has excellent service and a very subtle, albeit somewhat Devli's Advocate-esque decor (remember Pacino's office?) 

Amuse bouche (a thimble of onion soup with diced root vegetables and scallop ceviche)  was not impressive.  Next up with the asparagus risotto -- it had an asparagus foam that tasted like nothing. I've had much better risotto (if you're ever in Cabo, get the truffle risotto at  the Esperanza, holy crap.)  My dining partner ordered the hamachi carpaccio which was sent back because it was too fishy.  Guy Savoy replaced it (gratis) with a very delicious foi gras.  After that was a complimentary tasting of the $68 soup -- a nice truffle soup with some kind of foam.  My second foam of the meal. Next up was the veal chop with more root vegetables and truffle mashed potatoes.  The potatoes might have been the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. The veal was tough, tasteless and boring.  Ho hum, very disappointing.   Dessert was quite good... I got the item creatively-entitled ""Chocolat"" -- it was a series of different types of chocolate with chocolate ice cream and, guess what, a chocolate foam!  More frickin foam.  But the best foam of all the foams of the night.  Complimentary sauterne was a nice touch and after dessert, they rolled over a cart full of macaroons and various chocolates which was another nice treat.  I tried the peanut butter and jelly macaroon (not worth it) and a small piece of white chocolate with raspberry (ok).  All in all, a very nice meal but I've had far better at Jean Georges, Aureole and elsewhere.  Three stars are in comparison to those places... 5 stars compared to most places.

The service was impeccable. No alcohol for me so I don't know about the sommelier, but the silver service waiter we had was absolutely professional, and not snooty like other french restaurant waiters.  

At the end, we gave the executive chef (Matieu Chartron) compliments, and we got an impromtu tour of the kitchen! He's a very nice and down to earth man.It was an amazing experience I was very fortunate to have. I found out that there was indeed a chef's table for those who want an up-close experience in the kitchen. I'm definitely doing this next time I go. 

Oh, dress up to come to this place because if you hit it big downstairs and come here to celebrate, jeans and a t-shirt aren't going to cut it. I'm talking business casual AT LEAST. 

For two people, expect to spend at least $1000 and of course more unless you're a jerk tipper or order a bunch of alcohol..",OfdX0DGrAET9jqn_7gkXww,8,7,5,BVRNWQ3s2yEVWfewkoEfpw
3594471,2010-08-26,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,It's been quite sometime since I've ate here (probably about 2 years).  But it is one of the most epic meals I've had.  My parents brought me to this place for a birthday.  We had the pre-coursed meal... Everything was amazing.  Probably the best french restaurant in Vegas.

My wife and I had eaten at Guy Savoy's original restaurant in Paris and thoroughly enjoyed it, so we had high hopes for the Las Vegas location. This location is in Caesar's Palace and is supervised by Guy's charming son. It is located in a quiet part of the place with an understated dining room from which a perfect view of the ""Eiffel Tower"" at Paris, Paris may be seen. It is oddly transporting in that bizarre Vegas sort of way. The seating density is VERY low, which is great. When loud talkers wearing gold chains and other bling chat, you really cannot hear them. The clientele is a mixture of gauche high rollers, foodies, and special occasion sorts.

Quality and service here are impeccable. The meal starts with the champagne cart which has a dozen offerings by the glass. Where we live, you are lucky to find a basic champagne by the glass, much less an assortment of top tier houses. The bread cart has a dozen and half kinds of bread from walnut bread to a seaweed bread. There are two kinds of butter from Normandy: a salted and unsalted version.

The menu is organized as a tasting menu or one may order ala carte. We chose ala cart and ordered three course, which included Guy's famous black truffle and artichoke soup. Everything was without flaw AND filled with passion.

All well and good, but the service was the best part. Guy Savoy has the most gracious staff ever. If I had asked ""what is chicken?"", they would have immediately described it with no hint of talking down to the guest. Everyone was immensely kind and helpful, while staying professional. They also were invisible when they should be invisible and somehow present when they should be present. Half empty butter holders disappeared and were replenished without any disturbance in our conversation. All together impressively seamless. Guy's son watches over the well trained staff and visits each table with warm and genuine care.

We were quite full after our three courses and decided to just have an espresso, passing on dessert. Our espresso was accompanied by three more gratis courses of sweets, including a cart of candies, pastries, ice creams, etc., then petit fours. This was the continuation of a pattern of several gratis mini-courses during the meal.

As we departed, we were presented a beautifully packaged box of house-made chocolates. The bill was huge, BUT it was worth every penny. The value was there. If a person is planning on seeing a show in Vegas and getting great seats, you would pay about as much. Why not try a world-class restaurant for a few hours.

I loved that they loved my love for foie gras.

The wine guy (sorry, I can barely pronounce sommelier much less spell it) was impressive and our table captain was brilliant. 

They have adorable mini tables to put your purse upon and a great huge table for the greater huger wine list.

We had the GTV prie fix and 5:30pm reservations and barely made our 9pm show, so that's the pace and leave time because you want to savor every moment. I love how they bring out the food as it is prepared to show you the wonder the chefs are creating. Wish I could have given the chefs a standing ovation. Brilliant food, beautiful plating, stunning wine pairing. 

They also have a short menu for those going to earlier shows.

My favorite restaurant is still probably Gary Danko, but this is in the top 10, maybe top 5 and probably ahead of the French Laundry because the Guy Savoy staff are less pretentious.

The food: Everything was delicious. There were some signature dishes that was so hearty and at the same time extravagant, such as the truffle artichoke soup and foie gras in daikon broth. There were also very innovative dishes that were still tasty and satisfying. For instance, there was a salmon sashimi seared on a block of dry ice, which completely changed the texture and consistency of the salmon. Amazing! I know some restaurants try to make ""innovative"" courses but end up being too ""interesting"" but not actually enjoyable. Guy Savoy is not that. There's a perfect balance between traditional and innovative - both delicious and memorable! The cheese cart was perfect! The bread and dessert carts were only OK.

Service: Fabrice and Adrian are probably the best waiters I've ever had. They are attentive and kind. Both also have a great sense of humor, which lightened up the whole atmosphere of the restaurant!

Wine: According to my boyfriend, they did a fabulous job with the wine pairings of both set menus. Fabrice kindly described many wines and the reasonings behind each pairing - we really appreciated that. I wish the asian male who poured most of the wine (I assume he's the sommelier?) showed more enthusiasm though... He just recited the name and year of the wine for each course.

All in all, I think Guy Savoy tops Joel Robuchon in all aspects (food, service, wine) EXCEPT for the dessert and bread carts.",3e4SbwYHhNy7tzzYlusIcg,6,3,5,YmeDJt-UaPWXnOc8Td2q2Q

I didn't know I was going to have dinner at some fancy restaurant when I flew out there last minute to meet my husband so I had to go buy a dress. I splurge and bought a DVF dress. We got to there early so we sat at the bar. They offered us some cute little burgers on a stick. The bartender asked me what I wanted to drink and I said ""surprise me."" He made me some delicious berry martini. I could drink 8 of those. 

During our four hour dinner, all the food, the service, and the wine was amazing. My favorite was the bread cart. It was like a work of art. The cheese cart and dessert cart were fabulous too. I was drinking my special martinis and all the paired wines. I loved how they served everything with such flair. My favorite was the artichoke soup.  I was so wasted but since it was over a long period of time I managed some decorum (I think).

The bill was crazy but my husband said since my dress cost about my portion for dinner, its like I got a free dress. I am not sure if that makes any sense, since I still had to pay for the dress.

We had the mini set menu pre-theater dinner and it was plenty of food, and delicious. I had the oysters in ice gelée followed by veal shank with season vegetables and potato purée. My wife had tuna tartar and lobster, and the farm raised chicken ""laquée"" with mushroom and cabbage. The dessert was coconut six ways.

Everything was wonderful, but the chicken was at a higher level of wonderfulness than everything else. I would go back just to have that again. The sauce had an amazing flavor and just enough viscosity to linger on the palate without being cloying. Yum.

The bread cart, which has been written about at length, is everything it is cracked up to be. While, like all of the restaurants, they use the Caesar's commissary bakery, they have their own private section and have a dedicated team of three bakers who start turning out the goods at 4 AM each day,

The restaurant has a deal with Krug and offers a spectacular NV made from a couple great years for -only- $39, It is a bargain.

Executive Chef Julien Asseo and Executive Pastry Chef Sebastien Polycarpe are doing some incredibly delicious and whimsical, at times, food that turns a three and a half hour meal into a journey replete with rich flavors, intricate platings, and very creative ideas.

Two of us came here and ate pretty much the Prestige menu with a few additions and some deletions.  We got:

Amuse-blouche of salt cured foie gras and brioche sandwich.
Canapés.
Beef tartare burgers.
Bread from a large selection bread trolley.
Kushi oyster concassée.
Osetra caviar, white asparagus, Dungeness crab, and Kaffir lime.
Octopus in cold steam, romesco, black garlic, and croquetas.
Turbot roasted on the bone. 
Seared foie gras and unagi Napoleon. 
Artichoke and black truffle soup with mushroom brioche and black truffle butter.
Spring veal cheek surrounded by spaghetti.
Dry aged Muscovy duck roasted on the bone, Napoleon of daikon and foie gras, duck farce stuffed blond morel, and sauce salmis.
Dry aged duck confit with house made bao.
36 month aged comté, buckwheat crouton, comté mousse, onion broth.
Harry's berries strawberry.

Earl Grey sorbet.
  
The dishes I'd pick out as being the most memorable ones: 1) Osetra caviar and Dungeness crab, 2) the artichoke and black truffle soup is flavor taken to the extreme with simple ingredients, 3) Dry aged Muscovy duck and the sauce salmis, 4) veal cheek, and finally 5) Le comté and onion.  The sauces with the dishes go so far beyond the basic sauces new chefs learn.  They are very creative, inventive, and quite flavorful!  Of course, the desserts of Chef Polycarpe were outstanding as well!

The elegance of the restaurant adds to the enjoyment of the wonderful food.  Service is top notch!  After the meal, we had the chance to stop into the kitchen and talk with Chef Asseo.  It was the culmination--almost--of a grand dinner.

From the minute you sit, you are the center of their attention. There is not a single employee that does not treat you like royalty. 

Contrary to restaurants like Prime, Guy Savoy wants you to enjoy your experience as well as their food. This is why they've earned their Michelin rating. 

Even if you are overwhelmed by the wine ""menu"". A six inch thick book that needs its own stand, the sommelier will help. Make sure you include your price range with your palate. Wines range from $100 to $100,000.  Can't be poor to dine here; but, you don't want to mortgage the car on a bottle. 

Every minute brings another morsel of delightful tastes. From butter salted specifically to your taste, to the bread cart of dreams, I guarantee that no matter what your tastes it will be amazing.

- You arrive to the table and immediately a man with an entire cart of champagne visits you. (We skipped this) (Actually the first thing was that the dear wife's purse got its own stool)
- One of the servers then instantly arrives to ask what type of water you would like.  (We selected Evian flat)
- If you select Wine they bring out a huge book and the book comes with its own very table.  I had 3 glasses of the same and very much enjoyed it.
- You are then presented with the menu and asked for questions.
- We selected the prestige menu (indicating 10 courses, but really about 13)
- Immediately after ordering we were presented with a gift from the Chef which was a small foie gras tasting (It resembled a very very tiny sandwich) Excellent!
- It is hard to remember everything and the order, but I believe now is when we first got one of our bread selections.   Take a look at that flickr bread cart.  That is exactly what it looked like and it is hard to believe they are all real and perfect.

One of the culinary highlights of our life in Vegas was dinner here -- sadly, it wasn't with my husband but with my Mother (who adored every sip, every taste) -- but I look forward to returning with my husband just the two of us.  We went one night after a show, in hopes of simply enjoying a perfect glass of champagne in the bar since it was so late -- but instead, we were treated to -- yep - a fully comped tasting menu with seemingly bottomless glasses of champagne.  Such a surprise -- and such a delight -- every bite.  

The evening's only ? was having to deal with Paris Hilton and Cris Angel who wouldn't stop smoking in the bar -- they were attending Elton's birthday party in the PDR but for some reason thought leaving the party was appropriate...oh well. 

The original Maitre d' at Spago Hollywood, Bernard Erpicum originally officiated over the champagne bar -- the tales he can tell -- and he's known my husband for years, so we were well cared for.  Since then, however, Bernard has moved on and is now at Aureole, if memory serves.  

I've been a fan of Monsieur Savoy's since my first trip to Paris twenty years ago.  So having him come to Vegas now so regularly, and having the opportunity to visit (damn, I wish my French was better) with him, instead of simply being another mouth to feed, is a dream come true.  He should be so proud of Franck, who's such a talent, such a lovely host.  But mostly I love how good he is to my husband and that he regularly dines at my husband's restaurant so that the two of them can visit.

PS: Joel Robuchon was totally booked up a month in advance on that night)

On to the food. The amuse was probably one of the most memorable parts of the meal - a fois gras club sandwich (a triangle of bread, a shmear of fois gras, another piece of bread and so on) on a pick. The fois gras was so creamy, buttery and delightful.

I was super excited when they rolled the bread cart our way. A variety of fresh breads including olive oil, bacon, sunflower seed, rosemary and more served with salted and unsalted butter.

For my entree I ordered the cold-steamed lobster - very cool presentation (see pic). The sweetness of the lobster with the bitterness of the grapefruit worked well.

My husband ordered the black truffle soup - I understand the base of the soup is made with water, not cream, which was very interesting. It was still relatively creamy with a very subtle truffle taste. 

For my main course I got the beef tenderloin with bone marrow. Very visually appealing (see pic) and the beef was super tender and juicy. I ordered it medium, even though I know they like you to order it medium rare. I thought it was perfect medium - still a little red in the center. 

And then there was the dessert cart *sigh*. Truffles, an assortment of gelatos (including popcorn flavored), macarons, napoleons... I could go on and on, but I'll just attach a pic instead :) There was a budino-like dessert that was served in a jar and it was ridiculously delicious. That may have been one of the highlights of the evening.

So all in all, the food was very well executed and the service was good, however the ambiance was not to my liking. It's once of those placed that I don't really have a desire to return to. For that reason I'll give it a 4 out of 5 stars.",EYtQN_g8JQGdWU0FPjjpqQ,4,2,4,hXR0YxJtZvwL2E4cdRhxNw
4154545,2017-05-21,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Having been fortunate to visit many Michelin starred restaurants I tend to judge restaurants based on quality of food, service, and value, and and most importantly at this level of restaurant how they elevate dishes. 

First of all, and the restaurant itself is nice, and the service is as you would expect from a prestigious restaurant. We ordered the Forbes tasting menu which at the time was about $300 per person if you didn't opt for the wine pairing. 

This included a king crab and golden osetra caviar dish, their signature soup, an a5 wagyu, lobster, and ravioli with roasted veggie main, and a chocolate decadence dessert. 

To begin with the dishes themselves tased good, with the exception of the main: the wagyu itself was average, and the lobster meat was sweet but tough and likely overcooked. This miss in itself is enough to demerit the restaurant a star, and then when you get to dessert some simple chocolate mousse and sorbet with a sprinkling of crumbles doesn't seem worthy enough to call it an exquisite meal. 

Overall the taste of the meal was fine, and there were some errors in the cooking of the food and and the dessert wasn't elevated at all. For the price of 300pp probably not worth the money.",t8d6cQ2VR7192Iuu6JAw0A,3,0,4,TyphNc5DQfK6uGQf2kp-xQ

The host advised us to eat the bar (which is isolated enough so we were able to have a very enjoyable eating experience) since we came late (10:00pm) and did not have reservations.  We ordered a very delightful cheese plate (absolutely no smoked cheeses, thank God!) that had a mix of mostly French and Spanish.  Beef tartar w/ quail eggs and pomme dauphin was so delightful (a twinge of guilt for eating Kobe since as you should know they are basically treated like veal).  The best was actually the bread and butter they brought.  I have never had pink Himalayan salt and fresh peppercorns served with bread.  We had fun mixing things together.  So, with two ""snacks"" we could no t believe that it was 2:00am when we finally walked out the doors.  Great selections of champagne and scotch!

4211562,2011-01-05,20,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"We were under a time constraint the night we ate here and I had no time to go back to our hotel to change into something that would be more fitting for a fancy dinner.  This means I showed up dressed in a cable knit sweater, distressed jeans and my Hunter wellingtons.  Yes indeed, I looked as if I was ready to shovel ankle-level piles of horse manure; I did not look like I was ready to eat at a fancy schmancy restaurant.

This is not a new thing for me, as I have been caught dining at Michael Mina wearing a baseball cap and puma sneakers. It's my ironic way of saying ""f*ck the establishment"" while inhaling mini spoons of caviar, basking in the hypocrisy of my so-called ""principles"". I kid. I kid.

The wonderful thing is that despite my shoddy appearance that night, the service we were provided with at Guy Savoy was no less than perfect.  There is much to be said about a group of servers who treat you like you are the Queen of England herself despite it all. 

We were scheduled to watch a show following dinner, and the server who greeted us at the table made sure to be mindful of the time.  He disappeared and appeared again with a silver plate carrying what looked like two bite-sized waffle pieces.  

""The second amuse for tonight, Mademoiselle,""  he said, quite pleased with himself.  The first amuse-bouche had been some toast that was spread over with foie-gras au torchon which had more of the consistency of liver pate.  

I picked up one of the bite-sized items and looked at it. I was right, it was literally a piece of waffle with parmesan cheese on top, being served on a silver plate no less.  I almost busted out laughing.  

My boyfriend and I had the veal chop with the truffle-infused mashed potatoes.  I do realize that this is a French restaurant and that portions are small; I accept and understand this fact.  There was however a point during our meal when the server came back to our table with a small skillet and asked if we wanted some more veal.  Of course we took him up on the offer since we both spent a good amount of time trying to find the veal on our plate beneath a small lump of baby carrots and a lone scallion.  So the server picks up his miniature tongs  and reveals a piece of meat that looked like a flesh colored piece of trident gum.  I am not making this up.  Not that I was not grateful to get more food, but I was more thinking to myself, ""What was the point?""

The entire dinner bordered on comical, though it is not in the least terrible.  However, I would probably recommend eating at Picasso, which is comparable to most things at Guy Savoy (in my opinion) at a fraction of the price.  Or save your money and splurge on Robuchon.  But if you want a good honest laugh, I would recommend Guy Savoy.",TXIAACLEBGecBvfj5gZP1Q,9,10,4,07u26nyWbN8RL2AqFnlyxg

4309151,2014-08-30,3,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"I am giving it 3 stars because I have to include both ambiance and style.  The menu was small, offering little variety.   The truffle and artichoke soup was delicious (not worth $85).  The Beef tenderloin again was also delicious but the bone marrow on top did nothing to the meat except give it a mucus flavor and texture.  The braised beef in the plate again was flavorful but the Dijon they placed on top of it was overpowering and killed the flavor.  For the portion size I don't think the dish was worth $80.   Wine selection was great.  My friend at the table got the veal tasting for $100.  He said the only part worth it was the cheek meat.  The veal chop was dry, unseasoned and had a ham consistency and the sweet bread was just fair.   Lastly the ambiance of the place couldn't have been more dull.  While it was clean and modern it was also boring.  Not something I would expect from such a big and ""classic"" French restaurant.   Also the fact that there was no music as background noise made the restaurant uncomfortable as all conversations could be heard.  Was i looking to hear DJ Tiesto in the background? No.  But some classical music would have been nice to soften the harshness and ackward was that the restaurant made you feel.   I have been to restaurants all over the world and I live in NYC.  This was an average French restaurant trying to be Daniel Boulud or La Gran Fefour in Paris.  Save your $850 (4 main courses two appetizers and two $65 bottles of wine). And go someplace else.

4309951,2015-12-19,7,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Much ado about??

My husband and I had the innovation menu.
The menu's philosophy is all about showmanship more than substance.

The Osetra caviar lacked taste and was overwhelmed by the cauliflower.

The octopus dish is presented under a dome which is then filled with smoke in a liquid nitrogen type of effect which adds strictly nothing to the taste, so what's the purpose?

The chef then comes out with a cart on which there is a block of ice and some Salmon pieces. He introduced himself saying: ""This is my last day, I'm leaving tomorrow""! We neither asked nor cared the least bit about it, but what an introduction ... and it really makes you feel ""good"" about the place all together!! He then tells you that he will cook the salmon on the ice and that he would like you to taste the salmon before, so that you can enjoy the ""change in texture resulting from the cooking"". For this purpose he hands you one minuscule piece of salmon for you to taste. The piece is a cube, the side of which is about the size of your small finger nail. Way too small to chew on and get a sense of the ""pre-cooking"" texture might be. The chef then puts the salmon on ice for about 5 seconds and turns it around 3 times, he then serves the salmon. Given that the ""pre-cooked"" bite was too small, there is no way to sense whether the texture has changed or not. What I did notice however, was that the inside of the salmon was cold. Which means that the salmon piece had just been taken out of the fridge and was still very cold! We don't eat food straight out of the fridge at home: the cold anesthetizes taste and spoils the whole experience.

I can understand how some people are impressed by the fact that the ""executive"" chef comes to the table. I like to be impressed by what's in the plate and how it tastes ...

The line caught sea bass was the only outstanding course of the meal. The fish is cooked right, moist, firm and tasty and well complemented by the spaghetti squash.

The seared foie-gras is a square less than an inch wide served with an infusion of red cabbage which completely dominates the subtle taste of the verbena it is paired with. When my husband cut his foie-gras piece in half, the whole piece disintegrated because there was a piece of the nerve smack in the middle of it. Not exactly what you're looking for.

The artichoke and black truffle soup was minuscule with one so thin slice of truffle, you again had nothing to chew on (which is one of the purposes of eating black truffle). The parmesan slice was the size and thinness of a small postage stamp. The truffle brioche was very good.

The peanut butter crusted quail breast simply doesn't work because it makes no sense. The whole point of a pink quail (or pigeon for that purpose) breast is to have the soft, juicy and (not too) but still flavorful meat melt and explode in your mouth. In this course everything is utterly dominated by the taste of the peanuts. You don't even know what else you're eating. If I want to taste peanuts I make myself a whole wheat toast and spread it with chunky peanut butter. The quail is completely waste here.

The piece of Wagyu is so small it is impossible to get it ""blue"" as I requested.

After we paid the bill no one asked whether we needed a cab or not. So we go down to the entrance level where our cab dropped us off when we came in. Hence we naïvely thought that was the place to catch a cab. We got very rudely told by the person at that location that ""no ! no ! this is for limos , not for taxis"". When we expressed our surprise he told us, just as rudely, ""taxis are over there"", pointing his finger without being more specific about what ""over there"" might mean. So we walk in the indicated direction , realize that we need to walk through the casino , wade our ways there for about five minutes, find the exit that says ""taxis"" and are very ""happy"" to see that about 20 other people are waiting for a cab in front of us. 10 minutes later it's our turn!!

4359202,2010-06-27,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Whenever I go to Vegas, dinner here is a given.  I have never witnessed such a high level of service and an overall complete dining experience.  The key word is experience.  This is not only a mere meal, and a very good one at that, but rather a period of time that your every want and need is catered to.  I only wish I could have visited when Maestro Savoy was in town.  This is not to say the chef is incompetent.  Heck his son, Franck,  runs the place and he makes you feel like best friends.  

OK first off, carts kicks ass!  They have a bread trolley with bacon bread.  Bread with real bacon bits!!!  It blew my mind, I always take some to go now.  They have all sort of bread for different foods.  The seaweed bread is another winner.  It seems as though you can taste the ocean through oven magic.  There is a dessert cart as well.  Pretty much a candy shop on wheels.  Willy Wonka eat your heart out.  Macaroons are my new best friends.  I can hardly write because of all the thought on my brain.  Plus everything is made in house.  

The menu is not expansive and I highly suggest one of the tasting menus.  The beauty is you can work with the staff to get something to your liking or if you want to try different items from your mates.  The staples of the menu are done to perfection.  The truffle soup for example gets better every time; it's addicting.  The same can be said of the sea bass, scallops and poussin.  

Do yourself a favor and go for the wine pairing.  The sommelier is excellent and won't steer you wrong.  

I've never been to a place where the combination of service and food made me feel so satisfied.  Of course some will comment on the price, but at the end of the night it is well worth it.

My crazy foodie friend and I ordered the 14 course Prestige tasting menu, and shared the 12 glass Prestige wine pairing.  With the all the freebies, and multi-course dessert cart, it was around 20 items that we tasted.  That's a lot of food!

Hits:
*Raw oyster with lemon and seaweed granite - simply sublime.
*Octopus in cold steam with octopus croquetas and black garlic - dramatic presentation, tastes as good as it looks.
*Red mullet - Rich fish and tasty preparation.
*Napoleon of foie gras and unagi = unctuous umami-bomb.
*Pluma de Bellota Iberico (roast pork tenderloin) - oink oink!
*Bread service - There are several delicious house-made breads that are offered, impressively presented on a cart, with a huge chunk of butter imported from France, and shaved tableside.  Bravo!

Misses:
*Artichoke and black truffle soup - did not live up to the hype.
*Veal cheek timballe - Beautiful presentation, not very flavorful.
*Salmon iceberg - This one is a head scratcher.  Chef comes to table, presents to us some beautiful cuts New Zealand salmon.  We try some, sashimi style, unadorned, as a baseline.  Then, he ""cooks"" a couple pieces on an anti-griddle, freezing the salmon to produce a frozen crust, then places it it a bowl and pours hot broth over the top.  We are to eat the cold salmon and hot broth to create a temperature juxtaposition in our mouths.  Well, the concept sounds cool, but in the end it's a lot of tepid stuff.  Honestly, the unadorned salmon was perfectly delicious, and superior to the frozen salmon.

The wine tasting was generous and fun.  It's a lot of wine!  Part-way through the meal, I lost my internet connection and Vivino stopped working so I couldn't obtain independent wine information :(

For dessert, a cart is pulled up to the table with several desserts and we are allowed to choose as many as we want.  The desserts were ok, but I'm not a dessert-guy.

We got a tour of the kitchen and were impressed by the order, cleanliness and esprit-de-corps of the operation.

This is an expensive meal, one of the most expensive that I have ever had.  The Prestige tasting menu is $385 per person and the wine tasting was $375.  You do the math!  So we receive the itemized bill - 2 Prestige tasting menus, 1 Prestige wine pairing, 2 coffees, 1 martini, 1 gin and tonic, 1 Evian water.  $1300.  Hold on, wait a minute!  There's a $2 charge for blue cheese olives.  WTF!  You're charging me $2 for blue cheese olives?!?!  That's highway robbery!",jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,2,1,4,e3n30MfQwHhl5Ghh4GVP2g

I admit, the reason we decided to dine at Guy Savoy was because Hung (my boy!) won Top Chef and this was where he once worked/trained.  We were curious.  That curiosity cost us over $600, but hey, sometimes I'm lucky in Vegas. :)

If it weren't for the neon lights outside, I'd think we were dining somewhere in NYC. It was class, clean lines, lots of white linen and mahogany.  It was as stunning as it was austere.

The menu offers everything you would typically see in fine French dinning.  No surprises there.  However, a wine list which is so big and heavy that commands it's own little pedestal... too funny, but we found the German wine we wanted and was happy enough.

OK, the food.  Yup, the bread cart rocks.  Although.. I hate to say it here.  After the cart rolled away to another table, I saw the bread server drop the knife.. then continued cutting with it.  I wanted to say something, but just decided to just let it go because... well... we weren't gonna have anymore bread. ;)

They have a wonderful fix prix menu comprised of a scallop appetizer, a truffled mushroom soup and a filet.

By now, you probably have read how extraordinary the food is.  The visual food art these master chefs create is crazy and how these plethora of different flavors mesh and match into a edible masterpiece.

The culture instilled in these food service professionals is not the same as you high end  Morton's or lowrys.  From the exec chef to floor manager to waiters to wait help all work in unison.  It's not my table, section or your guest or section.... It OUR guests!  You can ask anyone for a request and they will honor it immediately with a ""certainly madame"" and they will fulfill it, not ask the person tending your section to do it.

Another thing I like is they don't nickel and dime you for insignificant items, such as bottle water. Many will charge $10 per bottle you drink. At Guy Savoy, one $8 charge gets you as many glass bottle Evians you need.

Finally at a Michelin star restaurant is you want surprises and to be wow to the point you say, you win, I can't eat another bite.  With Guy Savoy, you get your amuse dessert, two main desserts.  Then they casually roll in the dessert cart with bite sized tart, pies, mousse, ice cream, bread etc.  So after you have loosened your belt two notches, they bring out a single scoop of sorbet, earl grey tea and black pepper to be exact.  This leaves your palate cleansed.

On your way out the hostess hands you a small box fresh baked coffee cake to savor later.  These wow moments and special touches is why this is the best of the best in Las Vegas.",mX84lBw8jwS2uQqdgKu_aA,22,15,5,3yvdoBnL4F0C_i2lqX4LlA

Fine dining has not been my thing as most of the times I'd walk out of the restaurant at the end of the night thinking after spending all that money, the overall experience was just ""meh, the food is decent, service isn't bad, but not something I'd crave for or think it's worth every dime I spent for"".  Guy Savoy definitely broke that routine and impressed me far beyond.

Given it's a 2 Michelin Star restaurant, I'm not going to praise about the excellence of food, I'd like to share my actual dining experience with the group of people whom served us that night.

Must say, the overall dining experience started not so great.  When we arrived at the restaurant around 6:20 for our 6:30 reservation, we were politely welcomed by the lady up front. While she's smiling and nice, impression we got from her was ""cold"" - it was a very robotic smile and welcome. After we were seated (we were one of the first few tables to arrive), we quickly got water and another nice/polite yet cold/robotic welcome from the person who recommends champagne for tasting.  After glancing at the menu, instead of getting the pre fixe menu, we decided to (pretty  much) order one of everything from the regular menu figuring the cost will almost be the same and yet we will be able to try a variety of things. Appetizers and small tasting items were quickly served after we ordered.  The service was still perfect yet ""cold"", the group of us were also getting a little uncomfortable at how uptight the atmosphere is so we decided to change our own attitude a little. We chatted a tiny bit louder (we were literally whispering to each other since it was so quiet in the restaurant), cracked jokes among ourselves and got overly excited when the huge bread selections showed up.  This was when something unexpected happened - it appeared the group of servers decided to ""get the hint"" / ""adjusted to accommodate our style"" by changing their approach with us a little - they became more personable, warmer and happier (i.e. cracking jokes, making fun of our random comments...etc). After dinner, we were also invited to meet the amazing group of chefs in the back, along with the executive chief himself. Everyone we met in the kitchen were very easygoing and personable.  

My point is that the team who worked there that night didn't have to do what they did for us - there was nothing wrong with how they initially served us and maybe that's how things should be at a super fine dining restaurant that everyone should be on their best behaviors and act ""elegantly"" - by adjusting their approach to how their diners find it comfortable is what I call nailing the dining service down to the T.  They really made our dining experience from another ""meh"" to ""it was amazing!""  

We will definitely look to go back again in the near future.",5RtRPh0I3m6Zm5h6XmjC7Q,3,4,5,b0JnCNgeUDJHF0uHQ3-mzA
4689124,2015-02-23,6,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Really? 
This wasn't a 2 Michelin star restaurant in my opinion but I'll give 2 stars on Yelp.

Service: 

I'm not sure if it's because we were not sitting in the main dining room or what...my seat was kind of in the hidden spot behind the doors. Anyway, I felt like I wasn't getting enough attention and service. I needed a new set of utensils but I had to wait 5+ minutes to ask someone to bring me a set. When I asked for more bread, I had to consistently ask throughout my meal because they weren't bringing the bread cart. 
Just wasn't sure if I was sitting at Noodle house or a two Michelin star restaurant.

Food:

It was esthetically pleasing for the most part. 

However, I can't say I liked every single dishes in Innovation Menu. Especially the salmon iceburg. If I had not seen the fancy process, it would just be a piece of sashimi in $9.99 bento box. I can say this with confidence because I am kind of a sushi snob... Part of the reason why was because the chef overcooked my salmon and also the quality of the salmon was pretty low. It had a bit of a fishy, oily taste too.
Langoustine was okay. I'm not a big fan of foie gras and for Wagyu, the quality of meat was excellent but I wasn't sure what the purpose of the sponge cake was. It didn't complement the taste or the texture of the beef? 
The soup with black truffle was excellent. The bread that came with it was also excellent.
If the menu has just a little touch of tanginess, I feel like it would have had a more balanced taste. Dessert was great though. I enjoyed the little cakes, chocolate and the sorbet.

Overall, I wasn't satisfied with the meal. Of course I was full but I couldn't name one main that I really liked. I mean...after a $500 per person meal (with drinks), I think I should have been at least sort of happy...",TATUgYWFGeA1B3NKV3Xz1Q,8,3,2,ytxtnIWHLwU6HvWvXtNEIQ
4703091,2014-11-28,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Restaurant Guy Savoy: I saved my dinner at Restaurant Guy Savoy for my last dinner in LV since I knew I would be so full I wouldn't need food the next day on my flight back to NYC (I did have the wonderful lobster omelette at Cafe Bellagio for breakfast).

Dinner at Guy Savoy is serious business. Do not dine here if you have a show to catch. Do dine here if you want dinner to be the main event. Do plan to spend a good 3 hours at one of the most exquisite dinners anywhere.

Service is friendly, attentive and very polished. Tables are well spaced. Service was paced well. Wine list is physically huge so a special stand is brought to the table. I had a lovely table overlooking the strip with a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel. Almost made me believe I was in Paris. I've dined at Guy Savoy in Paris, and prefer Guy Savoy LV.

I selected the Innovation Menu.

The dinner began with a few delicious little bites: Foie gras and toast on a skewer; Parmesan tart; and burger canapé on a skewer.

The humongous bread cart was wheeled over, and I chose 5 breads: Parmesan, mustard seed and milk rolls; and slices of lemon, and carmelized onion bread.

The menu was:

Caviar, frozen cauliflower mousse
Langoustine tartare, heirloom carrot petals, poached-fried quail egg
Salmon iceberg (Chef prepares this tableside)
Line caught sea bass, crispy scales, sauerkraut and kusshi oyster 
Foie gras, pickled turnip, Bellota ham-quince infusion 
Pumpkin soup, poached egg and Alba white truffles (a requested substitution from the white truffle menu since I've had the artichoke soup with black truffles twice before)
Pan seared quail, stuffed baby turnip and smoked sabayon (the sabayon is cooked in the egg shell and cracked tableside)
Japanese wagyu, sesame seed and tarragon crust, artichoke salad and barigoule, sponge cake
White truffle cromesqui (one bite)
Brie white truffle 
Pear textures
Mont Blanc 
Frozen lava cake

I've had the Innovation menu twice, and highly recommend it to serious diners. Definitely will return to Restaurant Guy Savoy!",y6UplUH72gl3eBtG6ACa1w,6,5,5,ESwTA5pCs_-7wcDWDEty4g
4703510,2016-08-23,7,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"The result proved disappointing. Unfortunately, I have traveled a lot in the world, so this restaurant level is just OK, nothing amazing or outstanding sadly. 
Food is lower than average. I mean, one dish is good, but other dish isn't delicious at all... All dish is uneven. I thought their famous ""Artichoke Soup with Parmesan and Truffles"" no doubt that's delicious, but it wasn't delicious. It is flabby. That's too bad.
And Service is too formal, customers cannot be relaxed in this situation at all, Because nobody smiling when we questioned them. They did just answer with very serious face and eagerly. It was stifling. Formal service may not be careful that cannot be said as a rule. I think They have to make something that the customer can be enjoy with meals, but they give us overpowering feeling from incapable of flexibility. Surely they can not see the joke. 
Actually, It is strange to get a star of Michelin. Their performance was nothing special. Interior is very simple,I mean it depends on personal preferences, their interior like a in office or in a slightly witty station.It is just too simple. 
We can eat more delicious meals in France with more lower budget.

4719599,2014-11-17,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Let's face it. This is a Michelin starred restaurant. That tells it all. That also sets expectation very, very, very high! 

So, how does it live up the heightened expectations? It absolutely matches them!

If you're contemplating exquisite French food, something that is absolutely out of this world, Guy Savoy is the perfect place to go. I will admit that my intent was to dine at Joel Robuchon first. Alas, black card concierge or not, the only reservation I was able to get in a two hour window was at Guy. Fortunately, that was not a let down.

The food. Well, the food...oh man...thhhheeee foooooddd! Caviar, foie gras, truffles....wait, are you listening? Is that all I need to say? Perhaps so for most of us. Just have a look at my adjoined photos for a hint of what an incredible feast awaits you! 

My brother and I had Guy Savoy's Signature menu dégustation (tasting menu). If you're there, you already know you will spend quite a bit of money. It's easy to focus on cheaper options, but you would do yourself a disservice. At least the first time you go there, try a tasting menu. The variety of food, the endless flavors and textures, and the many techniques utilized make it all worthwhile!

Of course, for a restaurant of this caliber, service is key, and it exceeds all expectations. The staff was attentive, many of whom were ""imported"" from France and are trusted employees of Monsieur Savoy, and the overall experience was memorable to say the least.

As for drinks, we forwent any wine. I know, blasphemy! But I did have a flute of Guy Savoy blanc de blanc Champagne, that rates amongst the top three I have ever had. 

Guy Savoy may ""only"" have two Michelin stars at this time, but don't let that fool you. It's most certainly a three star establishment.",65KV7C8DS-5_wInKjee7ew,5,5,5,so5_19nzGj1iAmrRrVUDJw

The restaurant was modern, but a bit ""sterile"".  The staff were VERY attentive, but a bit intimidating.

While I can't remember anything specific about the meal (other than the fact that we could smell the cheese cart from the other end of the dining room!!!), we were left with a positive impression.  However, we swore that we would never do anything like that again (because of the expense).  But in retrospect, we realized that up-scale dining is all about the culinary adventure... not the value of the purchase.  As such, we are now working our way through all the fine-dining restaurants in Vegas.  I'd much rather give them my money than the casino!!!

First of all, the food is truly incredible and refined and deserving of its reputation.  I have this internal balance between the price of the food and exceptionalness of the taste and preparation.  Guy Savoy does not meet that balance.  The prices are extremely high for the quality delivered.  The heirloom tomatoes prepared 3 ways, was my favorite dish of all, utter perfection for tomato lovers.  The soup that made him famous was very good, but again the balance of price lowered my enjoyment of it.  The sea bass with foam, and incredible treatment of the skin, was great but I have honestly had better for my personal taste elsewhere.

4806661,2016-05-03,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Ok, it's Guy Savoy at Caesar's Palace.  2 Michelin star restaurant, and a whole bunch of other accolades.  It's one of those restaurants that you might think is out of your league, or you're going to have to spend an arm and a leg.   But it's not.   Here's why.

Food:  it's southern France, so therefore the taste will be light and subtle, not like the ""new American"" or fusion tasting cuisines.
Before coming here, I suggest you go to their website, look at the menu and decide beforehand what you're going to get when you arrive, this way you know how much you're going to spend.  You have the option of a la carte, basically selecting your own dish, or the preset option.  If this is your first venture into fine dining, then do the preset menu.   Otherwise, I suggest a la carte.  The portions are small, as with all fine dining.   We're here to enjoy quality and creativity, not quantity.  By picking your own dishes, it becomes affordable for everyone, and leaves room for a nice glass of wine or cocktail.   

Insider scoop:   They will push the bread trolley around, pick as much of what you like, you can request more if you like.  Don't feel embarrass.
They also will push the dessert cart around,  likewise pick what you like, as much as you like.   There's no need to order dessert when the waiter asks you.  The desserts are really small also.

Service:  excellent at this level.  They have to be!  There's that French thing, but it's all about confident, comfort.  Don't be intimidated!

So why not 5 stars?
Well, I felt that it was misleading that they didn't wheel the dessert cart out first before asking for you to order dessert.  So basically they should have said, we have a dessert cart here, we also have these other desserts on the menu to choose from.   So I give it 4 1/2 stars.

Dress code:  dress nicely, doesn't have to be fancy, but don't be a slob.  It's respect for the fine dining institution, not necessarily the restaurant itself.",LdBvIxZnsnOwq2TA5urGfA,0,1,4,9lFLzXy47hW4rfG3r4W5Og

I'm reading all these wonderful reviews and am wondering....were these people on drugs while they were there?  I'm a huge Foodie and this place was over hyped and WAAAAAYYY overpriced.  I don't mind paying alot for a great meal and great service but this place is way under par.

I've been to many outstanding fine dining restaurants around the world and have a good understanding and appreciation for the small portions and high prices.....but Guy Savoy takes this to a whole other level.  While I really enjoyed my Truffe Artichoke soup as my appetizer.....I definitely DID NOT like it $68 worth.  I mean seriously...$68 for a small bowl of soup???? It's insulting.  Also, I love anything with Truffles, but they really overdid it.  My boyfriend had the White Truffle tour menu and it was so overpowering you couldn't taste anything else. Not to mention he was sweating out truffle smell all night.

Our serving staff was stuffy and rude to put it mildly.  They made us feel like we were priviledged to be sitting in ""their"" restaurant.  I'm sorry but if someone is spending close to $1000 for a meal you better waiting on my every whim and be nice to me while your at it.

The ambiance in the restaurant is completely lacking!  While the restaurant itself looks beautiful and elegant...you can hear a pin drop in the dining room.  We felt like we were being punished in detention.  I don't want to whisper all night.  When I asked the waiter why they don't play any background music he said ""we like to let our customers enjoy the food with no distractions""...what BS! I've been to dozens of fine dining restaurants and none were as dull as this one.  

We are dessert fanatics but we couldn't wait to get out of Guy Savoy prison...we got our check even before we finished our meals.  And the waiter didn't even ask why we didn't finish or why we wanted to leave so soon.

I give Guy Savoy two thumbs down!  There are so many other restaurants in Vegas with much better food, service, and overall experience.

Service: 3.5
Very attentive in the beginning. Asked us if we had a show to go to. We got there around 6pm and left there about 8pm with the Signature Tasting menu. However, as it goes more busy into the night, we were ignored and had to wait so long for the desserts and for the check.

Overall: 3.5

This is particularly annoying because we showed up excited and ready for a great experience having made our reservations way in advance and were very disappointed with our dining experience. This was not a 1000 dollar meal and definitely NOT a 1600 meal. The sommelier was cold and brisk and did not explain the wines adequately really seeming to just phone it in. One of the dishes was inedible and I sent it back and we were so disgruntled and over it we asked for our service to be cut short pack in the remainder of our non eaten courses. We were given a discount on remaining wine pairings, which I guess was a plus but left with an overall huge disappointment. We love to splurge on a great dining experience and fortunately our distaste from Friday night was somewhat lessened by the wonderful experience at Joel Roubechon
ADDITIONALLY, I contacted the restaurant and was responded to via email so it looks like the bill situation will (hopefully) be cleared up, but I was also told that the manager Alain Alpe would contact me that evening, which... Never happened... shocker.
So all in all still annoyed and grumpy and not worth my original excitement over this place.",kePKikeiqyf9uGHejonmAA,8,1,1,qvhtZFwKG70Qa_lJkW78qw

They are both incredibly amazing restaurants, but Guy Savoy is just slightly better.  First, the service is exquisite.  Everyone that works there is French, so you honestly feel like you're in France even though you're still in Las Vegas.  Now let us get to the important stuff...THE FOOD.  I chose to go with the ""Signature Menu"" and it was spectacular.  The 9 courses were perfectly spaced out.  The Foie Gras and Truffle Soup were my favorite.  The Foie was perfectly cooked, and the bitter influsion was something different.

I definitely plan on coming again.

P.S.

Be cautious of the bread cart, don't want to fill up on that because later in the meal there will be a dessert cart, cheese course, chocolates, and they give you a nice little treat to take home with you.",Dgu5yYvqEDjzX-gFS6d77g,1,1,5,bXo-PRPcEUC-8Sv5Lh56YQ

Located inside Caesars Palace, it is a little tricky finding the restaurant, near the spa, upper floor.  The seclusion does eliminate all the casino ruckus and transcend into a classy atmosphere.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the host and instantly feel the need to be on our best behavior.  We were the largest party there for the evening, party of 7.  Drink orders were taken and were offered the wine menu. Since we were curious, we had asked to take a look, it was a bigger surprise when one of the staff brought out a mini table with a book that was as big as Harry Potter Spellbook.  It was quite a wonderful selection however, it did intimidated us and we ended up ordering cocktails instead.

We did not order the set menu considering everyone has different ideas on what they like to eat, we each ordered an appetizer and entree of our choice, a la carte.  Basically, we ordered 1 of everything from the menu.

They are very considerate about what you like/dislike/ allergies -- best to let them know when ordering.  The amuse bouche was done very delicate and delicious.  Since I don't like onions and one of the dish had them, I got a different dish from my friends (thank you). 

Bread is served to the table but don't stuff your face with it just yet, a big bread cart rolls out for choice of other bread selection (this was my carb heaven).

I had the artichoke with truffle soup which I thought was good, not superb.  I had the Beef Tenderloin for my main course and I thought it was very good.  The mash potato that comes with my main course was so delicious that I can eat a big bowl of it as a meal.

My favorite was the dessert.  Unknowingly about what was after our main course, we ordered 2 desserts to share... then a dessert cart rolls in front of us (enters my second heaven).  It was so hard to decide without sounding like a sugar hog and asking one of everything, I am crazy about ice cream and the server had made me nice scoops of them.  They had this Earl Grey Ice Cream... Oh my gosh, it is so good.

Our dining experience was what made this restaurant so distinguished.  At the beginning, the feeling of being the kid at the adult table made us uncomfortable and constantly watching our formal etiquette.  All wait staff were very professional and serious about their work.  However after the amuse bouche were served, our party kind of loosen up after a few drinks and really enjoyed ourselves in the company of great friends.  The staff still maintained their professionalism but spoke to us with less edge and made the night more friendly and memorable.

We got to visit the kitchen and it was wonderful seeing all the awesome people that put in the effort to serve us such wonderful food and experience.

Would definitely recommend at least once for the experience and another time again for the food because you will miss and crave for it.",Oz_ZFRrYVbUKmqVy1MRauA,5,4,5,5mB_PXi34p20EdIAt4mvGA
5012990,2011-03-29,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Truly an experience you'll never forget.  YES, it costs about $400/person for the full tasting menu WITHOUT wine.  YES - it takes hours to finish.  YES - it will be one of the best meals of your life.  
Some highlights:
1) Artichoke soup served with truffled butter brioche.  Ok, the soup was great.  It's Monsieur Savoy's signature dish.  But, that piece of brioche was the best thing I've ever eaten.  Take a nice piece of brioche, then your waiter spreads a truffled butter on top.  Grab it while it's nice and warm and eat.  Rich, truffly, and delicious.  
2) Lobster with carrot puree.  I'm actually NOT a lobster fan.  Yup.  I said it.  But this was unbelievable.  Normally lobster is tough - not this.  And paired with the sweetness of the carrot I found the lobster to actually be tasty rather than the blandness I associate with lobster.  Yup - bland.  But this was great.
3) Colors of Caviar - pure goodness.  Come in a little serving cup and you can see layers of different goodness in there.  I don't remember what exactly was in there beyond caviar and some kind of creamy sauce.  But it was wonderful.
4) Their Cheeses - great selection.  One of the ones we chose was a blue cheese so strong I could only take a small bite alongside the fruit and bread that came with it.  We were already stuffed so didn't appreciate this as much as we should have.
5) Their breads with salted and unsalted butter.  Seriously, this could have been the meal by itself.  I remember a walnut bread as well as a cranberry bread that was just amazing.  And served with the best butter I've ever had.  
Service is impeccable.  It's over 10 courses but you get new silverware each time.  Make sure you know what the Prestige Menu costs before ordering - with tax and tip you need to spend over $400.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,2,2,5,A9PTaMBdBJoRTF6oeVaEJw

We went early and were the first two people in the door for the day, and had two waiters dedicated to our table.  We got the tasting menu (figure 2 hours) and a drink.  We did not leave hungry that is a solid fact.  If you go here don't let the first plate scare you - it's only a mouthful - but you get a ton of plates.

5022907,2011-12-08,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"It was Friday and our last night in Vegas.  We decided on Restaurant Guy Savoy to be our pièce de résistance vacation meal.  RGS is tucked away from the bustling casino in a quiet section of Caesar's on the second floor of the Augustus Tower.  Upon entering the restaurant, you're struck by the restaurant's understated, if not a bit plain, décor.  However, this simplicity is certainly appropriate allowing them to focus diners on the complexity and splendor of the food.

We were seated and not long after ordering the Prestige Tasting Menu, our server delivered two amuses, a grilled foie gras sandwich and a Parmesan waffle with black pepper.  Both were simple in concept and presentation, but were wonderful starts to our multi-course feast.  Soon, another member of the service team rolled a cart filled with breads, a veritable rolling boulangerie.  It took amazing willpower to resist gorging on the vast variety of tasty French-style breads.  Throughout our meal, we had to keep telling the bread guy to move along for fear of eating too much bread.  After the first pass by the ""mobile boulangerie"", our meal began in earnest...       

Chestnut All Around...Who knew chestnuts could be prepared in so many ways and be so delicious?  Langoustine and Fennel...The crudo of langoustine was tender and possessed a sweetness that worked great with the fennel.  ""Colors of Caviar""...A parfait of caviar...call it sinful!  Crispy Sea Bass with Delicate Spices...Perfectly prepared, moist, and delicious.  Foie-Gras ""en Papillotte"" and Radish Bouillon...I love food cooked en papillotte. This dish was beautifully presented and perfect.  Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter...Guy Savoy's signature soup!  Generously topped with aromatic and flavorful black truffles.  I could drink this amazing soup every day!  Roasted Duck with Guy Savoy Spices...Seasoned to perfection, the duck was tender, moist, and exceedingly flavorful.  Brie à la Truffe Blanche...Since it's white truffle season, we subbed the brie topped with a generous amount of white truffle in place of the selection cheeses (which looked very impressive).  This was my first experience with white truffle...and it was a deliciously memorable one!  The Dessert Cart...Pastries and other chocolates and sweets were foisted on us.  Despite our best efforts, we could not resist!  We had several glasses of wine throughout our meal, but the 2001 Château Léoville-Poyferré Saint Julien was our favorite.  

Service was exemplary!  The cuisine was outstanding!  That said, if you order the Prestige Tasting Menu, give yourself at least two and half hours to enjoy the experience.  Second, be prepared to pay for that experience.  From beginning to end, Restaurant Guy Savoy provided a note perfect dining experience.  Cross this one off of my bucket list!",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,4,5,5,J0_YwNXtnQmf-JVmJxtBlQ
5031676,2015-02-11,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"My first michelin-starred restaurant!!! My girlfriend took me here as a surprise, and what a surprise it was. I had honestly not heard of Guy Savoy before but just a brief google search found these accolades:

The Las Vegas restaurant has garnered 2 Michelin stars, the AAA Five Diamond Award, the Forbes Five Star Award, and the Wine Spectator Grand Award.

WOW! What a resume. As soon as I learned where I was going, suddenly my expectations shot up sky high. Never have been at a michelin-starred restaurant before, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but the French magicians here did not disappoint.

We checked in and were seated immediately. The waiters provided us every courtesy imaginable, some I had never seen extended before: firstly, ladies are given a stool for their purses. What? Even your purse gets a seat here. On the table are absolutely gorgeous salt and pepper containers, and the glassware you get for your drinks are just stunning. Between dishes, they will clear your table of any crumbs. Wow! I must be really showing my plebeian side right now. At the start of the meal, they will ask about any dietary concerns and time constraints. The service they provide just blew my mind. They are clearly on top of their shit. Even the restrooms are beautiful.

Now let's talk about the FOOD

1. Amuse bouche - Lobster candy, seaweed granite: Basically a single bite of lobster wrapped in seaweed. Slightly sweet with all the flavors of the lobster there. Great way to kick start your appetite.

2. Caviar, frozen cauliflower mousse - Imagine eating shaved ice, but it's actually cauliflower. Paired with caviar and skim milk skin, this reminds me more of a dessert than an entree, but extremely delicious nonetheless. 

3. Langoustine Tartare, Black Truffle Heirloom Carrot Petals,
Poached-Fried Quail Egg - Wow! The presentation of this dish just exceeded all my expectations. They pour some water underneath the dish where it hits some dried ice and creates a very beautiful steam effect. Pictures don't do this any justice TBH. The dish itself is very good. Can't go wrong with quail eggs.

4. Salmon Iceberg - This was almost more of a show than a meal, and boy I was loving it. The executive chef came out with a cart of goodies, then prepared one piece of salmon for each of us by seasoning it on a BLOCK of Himalayan pink salt. He explained that he wanted us to see how the salmon tasted just by itself (it was amazing). After that he prepared one more piece each. He took the salmon and SEARED it right in front of us on a block of dried ice. Wow. I didn't even know you could do that. After it's seared, they place it on your plate and pour a hot broth on top so you can taste the contrast of the cold and the heat. I regret not getting a video of the whole process because it was such an amazing experience.  

5. Sea bass, crispy scales, sauerkraut, and kusshi oyster - Both the sea bass and oyster are extremely flavorful. Just by itself, it's extremely moist and soft. With the scales and sauerkraut, you get the crunchy texture. 

6. Foie gras, pickled turnip, bellota ham-quince infusion - To be honest, I don't think I've ever had foie gras before. My god, it's like a crazy cross between butter and steak. I heard it was illegal in California (where I'm from) till recently, so I will definitely be seeking more out! Wow, so good.

7. Artichoke and black truffle soup, toasted mushroom brioche and black truffle butter - Uh, thinkin' out loud.. black truffle butter is so crazy good. Paired with the brioche, wow. Then pair THAT with the black truffle soup, wow.

8. Pan-seared quail, stuffed baby turnip, and smoked sabayon - My vote for the cutest dish here. The meat is extremely flavorful and succulent. The baby turnip is cut so you can pop halves of that sucker into your mouth. The quail was deboned, then REboned for presentation lol. I think that's pretty cool. The sabayon just adds so much flavor on top of that. 

9. Japanese Wagyu, sesame seed, and terragon crust, artichoke salad and barigoule, sponge cake - The dish's presentation is very clean but actually there is so much going on here. The artichoke salad and sponge cake combo is not something i've ever experienced before so that was very interesting. The wagyu was pure bliss. I'm not an expert meat connoisseur but even a guy like me and tell the difference between a high quality cut like this and everything else.

10. Black Truffle Cromesqui: You just pop that sucker in. It's suppose to be eaten in a single bite!

11-14. Desserts + dessert cart. Sorry as much as I'd love to describe these to you all, I hit yelp's character limit. Let's just say they don't suck. 

Closing thoughts - This was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life. It's no surprise that this restaurant is so highly decorated in awards. If you are fortunate enough to be able to afford an evening, I highly recommend it. Seriously a memory for a lifetime.",oAvWyhbfIVNokdjlGZpVWw,7,3,5,If7xeTM3L__v9ezLT5IaLQ

When I walked in, I was immediately impressed with a beautiful wine rack leading into an impressively tall dining space.  As I sat down though, the place didn't feel like a comfortable space to eat. It could have been a great art gallery as the walls and center divider impose a very understated but imposing feel. The bread and dessert carts looked almost too industrial. I know they went for minimalist but wow... 
OK; set that stuff aside and think about the food... Amuse Bouche... the first spear of toast with foie gras torchon was tasty... it lead on to a potato soup with a dollop of minced maguro; a light choice. Everything pleasant, nothing controversial. 
For starters we went for a lobster salad... it came beautifully presented in layers of lobster and delicately julienned greens and a crisp lobster cracker, and more lobster... topped with a sauce of lobster reduction. MMMMMM...
Great bread filled in the spaces.
Then came our main which we went with roasted veal chop for two. First bite of the meat was just a touch disappointing. The meat was tender, the chop perfectly pink... it just didn't have anything remarkable to it. The veal reduction sauce was very classic but again, not remarkable. At that point we were running the numbers on our bill and asking if the 4 $ signs were worth it? Well then the potato puree that accompanied the dish brought the impression roaring back to a strong rating. Black truffle infused potato pure garnished with a thin slice of truffle on top and rich truffle foam... I had 2 plates and they just kept offering us more... What a delight! 
For dessert I chose the apple... a confluence of apple flavors and textures... very... apple-y. and interesting from a taste standpoint. But, the coconut dessert amuse bouche stole the show for me. WOW. 
Then the finale... dessert cart. the industrial minimalist cart... bearing bite after bite of dessert wonderfulness... Chocolate mousse was rich and satisfying. brown butter tart - memorable, many of the other mini-desserts.. just were all deserving of praise. 
Last comment is on service. Our waitress was very personable and thoughtful.",AxaAqZ6NbUa2TQoy24o-Mw,0,0,4,Yd8MOqCAebbvVcZSrSDsHQ

Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  

Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.

Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. 

The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.

Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the ""prestige"" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consommé, sublime.

Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.

Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.

A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between 360 - 490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,33,30,5,xtsovR0PPi69raG29wlkPQ

Everything was excellent; from speed of of service, perfect timing between courses, excellently well executed and presented food.  It was definitely an experience worth repeating.

Another note worth mentioning: we had a fish course that was really fishy.  I ate mine because I can deal with it, but my boyfriend only could stomach half of his.  The waiter inquired, so he told him the fish was fishy, but there's no need to replace it.  Our next course was another fish course, and this time it was pure excellence.  In the middle of the course I realized that our menu only has one fish course, and they comp us another without us asking!

Although the food is wonderful (the sea bass was so delicate and perfect that it would be in the top 3 of any fish I've eaten) it was more just the whole impressive sequence and service that won me over. You start with a champagne barrel that the sommelier reviews for you one by one, including the chef's own label which was delicious, all were available by the glass.  It put me in a good mood right off the bat. There was a procession of these encounters, including the bread cart and the cheese cart and the dessert cart.  You are invited to have as many selections of everything as you like.  The breads and pastries really stole the show for me, and the Chardonnay from Burgundy was wonderful. All the amuse bouche were lovely.  Crazy expensive (top tasting menu is $555 per person, though wine pairings are included with that) but I do feel I got my money's worth.

Service, wine list, breads and dessert are beyond the ordinary. The food is plenty and the staff deliver the utmost atmosphere of warmth and elegance. The service was unparalleled to many fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas 

The oysters were phenomenal as was the truffle soup. The service made the dinner a memorable one. I would agree with a few reviewers that no one time stands out. The entire experience blends into a rather unique meal that brings out the finer side of ordinary foods.

We chose the Innovation Tasting menu with premium wine pairing. 

We had an engaging view of the Vegas strip from our table. Once we were settled in, we were offered a selection of champagne to start the meal along with an amuse bouche of mini foie gras and black truffle bread.  

A large bread cart appeared along side our table with a voluminous selection of fresh French bread along with a presentation of various butters, salts and peppers. I choose to go with the bacon bread. Always go with bacon bread #Steventology. 
But I hold off on consuming my bread choosing only to butter it while it's hot because I'm not falling for the oldest trick in the book - filling up on bread! 

Then like waves relentlessly crashing against the shore unable to resist the moon's pull, the onslaught of awesomeness began. Course after course of the most delicious food I've had the pleasure to taste.  My photos don't do this meal justice. This was by far one of the best meals if not the best meal of my life. The combination of great food, great atmosphere, excellent service, engaging talented chef and good friends .. oh and a lots and lots of wine made this a night I will never forget. 

Amuse bouche - lobster candy, seaweed granitè

Langoustine tartare, heirloom carrot petals, poach-fried quail egg

Dry ice was on the bottom of the dish to create the smoky effect in the presentation.

Salmon Iceberg - the Chef prepares it tableside by hand searing it on dried ice and seasoning it with Himalayan pink salt. The dry ice doesn't really cook the salmon but rather changes the texture of it. Rich creamy texture that melts in your mouth.

Believe it or not ... this was the highlight of the meal. The artichoke soup with black truffles and shaved parmesan is his signature dish. The warm brioche layered with black truffle and topped with truffle butter that is meant to be dipped in the soup. The soup is made without cream or milk, simply thickened with truffle juice. The layers of earthy flavor cannot adequately be described with words.

We had a show to catch by 10 and our dinner was at 6.  What's great is that they ask you immediately if there are any time constraints you are under and let you know which course meals you should avoid.

5279025,2018-04-24,5,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Promising Chef Julien Asseo that a return to Restaurant Guy Savoy would take place as soon as Duck was back on the menu it was immediately when Spring began that plans were made, a table for two in the Augustus Tower at Caesars' Palace once again delivering the sort of experience meant to take diners away from the world outside for a few hours of style and sophistication

Last visited six months prior, the bill of fare overhauled in the interim with Savoy's signatures now presented a la carte and Asseo's interpretation of Modern French Cuisine offered by way of a $385 Prestige Tasting Menu, it was with warm greetings from General Manager Alain Alpe that guests were led to tables looking out onto Las Vegas Boulevard and Paris' Eiffel Tower, the same team of servers in place and as professional yet personable as ever

Always a model in making elegance seem effortless, the clean lines and pops of color paired to light notes of music and hushed tones, it was shortly after declining a Champagne toast that Menus were presented, the obvious choice a carte-blanche experience including several Prestige dishes plus the Duck and a few additional surprises

Not a meal to be rushed, though several tables for the 5:30 seating opted for just two courses en route to the Coliseum for Seinfeld, it was at a leisurely pace that others were treated to timeless bites of Foie Gras and Beef Tartare on Brioche before the meal officially began with Canapés, the earthy Celery Root cool and crisp while Tempura Bean Curd and a Mushroom stuffed with its own Duxelles doubled down on palate warming umami.

Unfolding over the course of 3 hours, several tableside presentations and Sauces allowing guests an opportunity to witness the amount of work that goes into making a world-class Restaurant tick, it was with a curl of Butter from Brittany and fragrant Olive Oil that a Bread Cart of ten choices made its first visit, the Loaves partially changed from prior and highlighted by Pain de Campagne, Olive-riddled Sourdough and Sweet Bread that eats like a Parker House Roll

Working with the season and a list of Meats and Produce that escape the book-keepers overseeing most Vegas Restaurants, the presence of a Krug Room and $555 Forbes 5-Star Menu telling of Savoy's legacy and typical clientele, it was in progression from light to heavy that the Prestige Menu began with a briny little Oyster chopped and topped with Seaweed Ice, the follow-up of Dungeness Crab and Cucumber beneath a sizable quenelle of Caviar quickly setting a high bar for everything else to follow as flavors both mild and intense were married by the mixture of Sherry Vinaigrette and Chive Oil

Next using Cold Steam to perfume tender Tentacles, a dish seen prior slightly updated and just as attention grabbing as ever, the night's Fish course soon arrived in the form of Turbot served atop roast Baby Vegetables and finished with classic Barigoule Sauce, everything about the plate singing of Spring with the Turbot cooked tender yet flaky enough to be separated by only a fork

Moving on to a pairing made famous by Martín Berasategui, the stack of Duck Liver and Eel given levity by 2 styles of Apple before being anchored by Duck Consommé, it just would not be proper to sit down at Guy Savoy without enjoying the famous Artichoke Soup, the fifth time still as worthwhile as the first while taste number one of Chef Asseo's tender Veal Cheek carefully wrapped in Spaghetti dazzled not only in terms of presentation but the manner in which various Pea textures reminisced of Savoy's own ""Peas All Around""
 
Onward then to ""le pièce de résistance,"" Julien's Duck finally returned, it is in 2 services 'for 2' that a rosy slice of aged Breast is served flanked by an enormous stuffed Morel plus another Napoleon featuring Foie Gras, the flavors intensely earthy and rich before guests are presented with an unlisted surprise of Confit and Offal tucked into housemade Bao and intended to be eaten by hand just like the tradition Peking version

Opting for a composed Cheese course in place of the Cart, any excuse to eat mature Comte welcomed, it was after slowly savoring spoonfuls of ""French Onion Soup"" in its highest form that the night was turned over to Pastry Chef Sébastien Polycarpe, the first service of a new creation intended to recreate the experience of eating a Strawberry fresh from the vine achieving its goal admirably before the menu culminated in 3 layers of unsweetened Dark Chocolate enlivened by Bergamot

Wrapping up with Mignardises and a visit to the Kitchen, an affable Asseo proudly giving credit to his entire team for everything that had just taken place, it was upon return to the table that palate cleansing Sorbet was offered along with the bill, a box of Pistachios coated in White Chocolate and Raspberry one last parting gift though those who've tasted it will likely still be thinking about Savoy's classic Rice Pudding or Polycarpe's Salted Chocolate-Caramel Tart.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,11,5,zN183sl2jM7jjavtjPphWA
5280896,2016-08-25,11,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"We had a magical dining experience at Guy Savoy for my husband's birthday.

I'd been wanting to dine here for quite some time, but could not justify spending $300+ per person. My financial advisor says that everything goes on sale at some point - including Guy Savoy. In honor of Caesars Palace's 50th anniversary, they are running a promotion for only $150 per person through the end of August. 

This place is not hard to find, but the secret is knowing where to park. The valet parking that faces Flamingo Rd. off the I-15 is the closest place to park. It's the same parking area for the Qua Spa and the 7-star entrance. From there you just take the elevator up and hang a left.

As soon as we walked in, we were quickly whisked away into a semi-private room with an amazing view. We shared the small room with another couple briefly. It was SO quiet in there that you could hear people chewing their food. My husband and I whispered the whole time as if we were in a library. Having soft music piped in would be nice touch.

For religious reasons, I refrain from eating pork, shellfish, and duck. The chefs at Guy Savoy sprang into action and prepared special dishes to accomodate our dietary restrtictions. We felt so loved!

Here's what we tried:

Amuse: Chilled carrot and ginger soup with a delightful eggplant surprise under the cup. A-

Bread cart: Carrot and fennel bread, seaweed bread, and parmesan bread. A+

First course: Heirloom tomato salad + tomato pate surprise was hidden underneath. A

Second course:Breaded lamb chops with stuffed rigatoni gratin. A++

Third course: Coconut 6 ways. B (what can I say...I'm a chocolate girl)

The service was impeccable and unpretentious. I could taste the love in the food. They even gave us a tour of the kitchen. Guy Savoy is definitely worth the splurge and if possible I'd give them 6 stars.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,34,29,5,kmwovNLJuBQHh8u_wU6P_w

Both had great service, wonderful presentation, they both had a nice selection of fresh baked breads and dessert trays. The servers were warm and inviting and catered to every need. This place had a cheese cart whereas Joel Robuchon didn't have one.

For sure this place was worth every penny, they kept on bringing items out to try that weren't on the menu and when we were so full we couldn't take anymore, 3 more items came out. :-)

5301105,2014-05-15,6,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"This is one of the world's great restaurants. Yes it's expensive. If you have to choose between Guy Savoy and your rent, please pay your rent.  Also, don't let this be your first fine dining experience.  You'll never be able to calibrate dinner out again.  It would be much like flying premier or first class on your inaugural international flight. It becomes the standard you expect from all restaurants. 

We enjoyed the Innovation Tasting Menu and wine parings. Course after course of exquisite food. There were some things not to my liking such as the smoked quail. Using mesquite it's quite easy to over smoke the food even for the most skilled chef.  My palate was dented even though the course was paired with a stand out Cote Rotie.  However, the pan roasted quail was wonderful.

You can view the Innovation Menu online.  Each course was meticulously prepared.  The food was outstanding.  I experienced flavor combinations that I could have never imagined.  Artichoke and black truffle.  Foie Gras and Quinoa with Bellota Ham infusion.  Sea Urchin and poached potato with lime and chili. Caviar with frozen pea mousse.  A5 Wagyu with some sort of savory sponge cake. Lobster with smoked butter sabayon.  The bread cart. Seaweed loaf. The simple baguette. Two butters were on the table along with flur de sel and cracked pepper. 

The cheese course was a treat. We were provided an accommodation of a little touch of Epoisses along with our ricotta herb menu item. I simply mentioned it and poof it happened. 

Desserts were fabulous. You can read about them elsewhere.  There is no other grade to give this restaurant other than a five.  It is fine dining. 

Service was attentive and professional. Not the typical French brigade. It was both formal and appropriately causal, pointedly professional but elegant and human. Staff was there to help and assist you enjoy the meal. Sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful.  Service was genuine not faux. 

If you are a foodie, prepare to become giddy.  Be sure your rent is paid in advance.",fNdqMFQB7WLsSgY2M4cZhw,10,6,5,3yNif1sNbSR6BiaR9OPgFw
5308559,2012-04-18,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Guy Savoy represents fine dining perfection in every sense of the word.  To even attempt to describe the elegance of this meal would far exceed the Yelp word limit.  My wife and I had the ""Prestige"" tasting menu which interestingly, is no longer available.  Check out their website to see their updated tasting menu options.  Here's a few random thoughts about Guy Savoy:

1.  The service is the best we've ever experienced in a restaurant.  Absolutely impeccable.  Serious but warm at the same time.  We especially loved how one of the waiters kept lapsing into French while talking with us.

2.  The carts (champagne, bread, cheese, dessert) are ridiculous.  They pair a difference delicious bread with every course!  The cheese and dessert carts have about 25 choices on each and you can have as much as you want.  Of course I had to try the Epoisses which is one of the most pungent cheeses in the world.  Just by taking the lid off the box you get blasted with a huge acetone smell that knocks you back and burns your sinuses!

3.  This place is very, very, very expensive (more than Alinea).  I'm glad we did it once, but I'm not sure I'd ever do it again.  You can roll comparable dinners in NYC for significantly less money.  Vegas is great, but it does break the bank.

Overall, we had a lovely dinner at Guy Savoy.  Easily one of the best dining experiences in Vegas if you're in town. It's too expensive to specifically come to Vegas to eat here because you'll find better value in other cities.  However, if you hit it big in the casinos, this would be a great place to drop a little extra change.",9VDrCkfj0I_MDSDPgsPKFA,6,3,5,qM-m3f8PdLORSK2fknN0IA

Oh Vegas, such a perfect town for indulgence and gluttony. Guy Savoy (not pronounced how you'd think) was chosen as a nice special dinner for my wife and myself, for no reason other than to live it up. 

Being an old married couple and knowing dinner could be 3+ hours, we took the earliest reservation at 6pm. The space was grand and empty upon arrival and we were seated with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains to the south. The mostly white decor was only interrupted but the occasional ultra-bright piece of ""art,"" all of which I loved. After a quick glance at the menu, the only option worth considering was the full Innovation menu with a shared wine pairing. And now on to the show!

1. Foie and Toast Amuse: 
What's not to love about foie anything, truffles, and some crisp bread to add some texture. A perfect way to say hello while having your ear licked with taste.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#q-5nZctMRztBoHuzI-9IiA

2. Waffle and Parmesan Amuse: 
Kind of a weird one but god damn if that wasn't one of the best bites of waffle I've ever had. Another wow bite. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#k-HfOiDwUHjQDk2yS_A-Ug

3. The Bread Cart: 
Dude, they make this every single morning. I guess it's less impressive when you consider the small army of people in the bowels of these hotels that are there 24/7 doing everything. But somewhere down there is someone making over a dozen different types of artisanal bread just for Guy Savoy. We tried over half the selection over the course of dinner and they were all amazing and better.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#CeIpoN0mqYabwMCCuRhM2A

4. Tomato Amuse:
And the ""ooos"" and ""aaahhs"" just kept coming from us with this one. They must have made five or six different types of intricate tomato preparations just to combine into something that took two bites. Every area of tomato flavor was highlighted, from the sweet to the vinegar, and it was masterfully finished with a nibble of a tomato chip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#kgqj-Czz4DtXuRe4HMI7wg

5. ""Concassé"" of Oysters:
Concasse is the French culinary word for crushed or ground up. Here it was a dish of oyster pieces topped with seaweed and an amazing lemon granite. Bite after bite was amazing, we couldn't get over how perfectly well the chopped oysters worked with the crunchy lemon ice. It was everything you could ever want from an oyster dish. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#gVFhIUDM1qU2dkxH3XxtsA

6. Langoustine in Cold Steam:
At this point we were sure they couldn't keep up with this level of amazing food, but they did and did so with one of the more over the top presentations I've seen;

Click play - http://instagram.com/p/dsw_tpTRCa/

Basically what you have here are two preparations of langoustine on a perforated plate, over a bowl of dry ice, that then has a nori broth poured into it creating the ""steam"" effect. What it really did do was to add a lovely and visible aroma to the place of amazingly delicate langoustine sashimi. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#HVKWHN7wRaciqzmZzUiHFw

7.  Asparagus, Caviar and ""Fresh"" Cheese:
The title of the dish pretty much gives it away. Though again, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors all wowed, and the cheese foam was closer to a meringue in texture. But hot damn, that was some damn fine caviar. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#5ubR8rXxh6w0WRwNHKzo2Q

8. Salmon Iceberg:
This is the first time I've ever had a chef ""cook"" something tableside on a block of dry ice;

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#71j9M9W4E8w5KRyMX73O9w

Served by head chef Mathieu Chartron, he graciously rattled off the thinking behind this unique preparation as he plated our ice cold salmon and proceeded to top it off with a very hot broth. The resulting hot/cold mixture was divine. Hard to say for certain if the dry ice treatment really did much, but it was very fun and ended in more oooos and aaahhs from us. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wGN_mNDWyRB53ISlRUzaqg

9. Lobster:
I really need the before pic to show how this one played out. Basically a nice piece of lobster was presented with a few cylinder shaped veggies on the parameter. Then the servers went on to unwarp each of the veggie rolls and layer them atop the lobster, then topped it all with a wonderful smoked butter sabayon sauce. The result wasn't as pretty as the start, but the flavor combination worked its magic once again on us.

The dishes were small, but cumulatively, you come out with a pot belly. All of the dishes were masterfully crafted, as how it should be.  Another wow moment was the wine bible.  It literally looked like one.  

Our server was excellent.  She gave us a tour of the place.  We got to see the Krug Room. I learned that it is an honor to have the Krug Room in your establishment because you have to be selected for this. We also got a tour of the kitchen where tables are set up for private parties who want a first hand look of at the food is prepared. I liked how the staff had good anticipation of your needs.  I had them write the different kinds of bread or meal paired with and without even asking, they also gave us a list of the cheese and desserts we sampled.  

I am only giving it four stars however because I remember feeling ""truffled up"" at the end of the meal.  I like anything truffle but after being served dish after dish after dish with truffles and caviar, I wish I had had some palette cleanser in between.  Thus, the missing star in the rating is for the lack of foresight in coming up with the sequence of dishes on the menu.  Otherwise, I recommend this place for anyone who wants to feel like a millionaire! 

Winners on the menu for me were the Peas All Around, the Colors of Caviar, the Foie-Gras and Radish Bouillon, Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup.

5384278,2009-05-24,2,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"The evening of May 7th, 2009 will be one I will remember forever! It was the night of the Master's Series Dinner at Restaurant Guy Savoy. One of the kick off events of Vegas Uncorked. The evening started with Champagne and some of those little Foie Burgers I loved so much my first visit. 

I was soon escorted to my table and introduced to my tablemates; Angelo and fellow yelper, Mary Ellen. I am so used to dining solo that I had almost forgotten how enjoyable intelligent and humorous conversation can be. Thanks guys! 

Now on to the food. 
1st Course 
Asparagus Soup with Fried Asparagus. 
Just a nice small treat to begin the evening. 

2nd Course 
Lobster Raw ""Cooked"" in Cold Steam. 
Sweet Carpaccio of Lobster was served on a vented plate that hid some dry ice. When a Soy based sauce was poured over the Lobster, ""steam"" rose through the vents. Quite a show! Served with Veuve Ciiquot Rose Champagne. 

3rd Course 
Turbot with Black Pepper Sabayon and Young Leeks. 
Mild, delicate fish, with a nicely spiced, peppery sauce and sweet grilled leeks. Paired with a 2007 Chateau La Nerthe Blanc. 

4th Course 
Cannons of Vegetables Stuffed with Escargots, Mushrooms, Herbs, Mushroom Emulsion. 
This dish looked beautiful. The Vegetables were wonderfully cooked and sweet. The Mushroom emulsion was deep earthy and full of Mushroom flavor, but the stuffing didn't really excite me. The Escargots should have been the star, but really got lost in the other components of the stuffing. Served with a 2006 Newton Unfiltered Chardonnay. 

5th Course 
Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup. 
This is a classic Savoy dish and was just as good as I remembered! Served with a 2006 Domaine Chandon Pinot Noir. This was my favorite pairing of the evening. 

6th Course 
Truffle Loin of Veal, Black Truffle Potato Puree, Spring Vegetables. 
Perfectly cooked, decadently studded with Truffles. The potatoes were so good they reminded me of Robuchons. Served with a 2005 Ceretto, Bricco Asili, Barbaresco. 

7th Course 
White Sphere 
A white chocolate sphere that, when a sauce was poured over revealed a hidden raspberry mousse. Quite an impressive show. Paired with a 2004 Domaine de Coyeux, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise. 

8th Course 
The Famous Dessert Cart!

5494683,2010-08-06,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Guy Savoy is not quite 5 stars (perfection), but close enough.  It probably makes my Top 5 fine dining experiences.  Top 10 for sure.  For those who know me, it falls somewhere below French Laundry and Momofuku Ko, but above Ritz-Carlton Dining Room and Gary Danko.

I should have noted the Sommelier's name, because he was terrific.  He was approachable and didn't dismiss us even though we were lightweights. He poured me quite possibly the best glass of wine I've ever tasted: a Chateau La Tour Figeac 2000 Bordeaux from the St. Emillion region.  

Other +'s:  
The food courses were delicious.  Well-seasoned, well-balanced, and well-planned.  For instance, there were lots of light, cool or cold dishes, perfect for the hot summertime Vegas weather.  
And I know everyone else has mentioned it, but the bread cart is a treat.  I usually refrain from eating more than a bite or two of bread, just to taste, when I'm expecting a full tasting menu, but I could not resist finishing the bacon bun and my slice of the caramelized onion loaf.  
The dessert cart is just as lovely.  I was eyeing it in anticipation the entire evening as it traveled from this table to that table.  
Finally, they won't pass judgment if you wish to take pictures of every course, as well as the bread and dessert carts.  In fact, they'll gladly help you by bringing the carts over to you.  And almost every course was worth a picture (I kept putting away my camera and then bringing it back out again upon seeing the next course).

The -'s:  
Decor is sparse and odd.  The space is nice enough, but one of the two art pieces was strange enough to be distracting.  
And they're not as indulgently-staffed as other fine dining establishments, so the service is not quite so impeccably timed as, say, at French Laundry, although service is excellent otherwise, from the purse stool to the fresh lint-free napkins you receive every time you get up from the table (yes, like the Ritz-Carlton Dining Room, they toss your napkin and give you a fresh one ... using spoons to carry it, rather than their hands).
The price is a bit steep, even for fine dining establishments.  But then again, it's Vegas and he's French (it seems the French establishments run by French chefs, i.e. Joel Robuchon or Alain Ducasse, always charge more than the really great American chefs), so the markup is not so surprising.  

All-in-all, a wonderful evening, and certainly the best I've had in Vegas, even if I've had the same or better in Napa or New York for less.",rMPs2d3Wqzt_72DNrDcQdA,3,1,5,Hdmc-WdZE8CpdZJo-cw4uA

5508836,2007-11-17,0,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"I ate at this establishment on November 10th, 2007.  I know about Chef Guy Savoy (Pronounced Gee- Sa-Vuah).  I know about his restaurants in Paris, France and all the accolades he has received.  Including having received three Michelin Stars.  This restaurant in Las Vegas is his first restaurant here in the U.S.A. It is located on the second floor of the Augustus Tower at the Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino.

With all this in mind, I decided what the heck, let's see if this guy, Guy Savoy, is all he is cracked up to be.  When I arrived, all I saw was two gigantic doors leading into the restaurant.  As I neared the door, a beautiful young woman opened the door and greeted my friend and I.  They ushered us into the cocktail lounge and asked if we wanted to have a cocktail while we waited.  Since I had planned on having the Chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings, I opted to wait for my table.  The decor was very simple yet elegant.

After a few minutes of waiting, our table was ready.  They asked if we wanted to have some wine or a cocktail.  I informed them that we were going to enjoy the Chef's Tasting Menu-which is called, ""Menu Prestige"" with the wine pairings.  It almost seemed like the waiter, some guy with a french accent, got a smirk on his face.  He then asked if we had any time constraints.  Time constraints?--are you kidding me.  ""Uh, no.  We don't have any time constraints.  We are here to enjoy this dining experience to the fullest.""  He said, ""Excellent, then we shall begin.""

It was at this point when our three (3) hour dining experience began.   Okay, let's move on to the good stuff---the food.  They started the meal with a tiny little skewer with bread and Foie Gras, their AmuseBouche. First of all, if you go here.  When they walk the little bread cart to your table you will be overwhelmed with the different varieties of bread you can get.  Ignore all of it and just ask for the Bacon Bread.  It is to die for.  The only other place I have ever had bacon bread was at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino here in Las Vegas as well--that's another review.

Here is what we ate:
Oysters in Ice Gele-- (A good way to start the meal.  It was very flavorful a nice little bite)   

Hamachi Carpaccio, Golden Oscetra Caviar, Cauliflower, Caviar Sabayon-- (The Hamachi was awesome and the flavors interacted with each other nicely, it wasn't over the top)

Maine Lobster, Carrots, Orange and Star Anis-- (they served this and added some sauce on our plate as they were explaining what it was-It truly was something else.  I can't say I have ever had anything like this.  The flavors melded perfectly) 
 
John Dory with a Crust of Walnut and Chive, Watercress and Salsify, Roasted Jus-- (This is a fish that is not commonly found on menus. Not very easy to get.  Nonetheless, we had it here and it was beautifully prepared.  I am not a big fan of Watercress but it worked well with this dish--truly impressed)

Roasted Foie Gras ""en Cocotte"", Cardamom Infused Duck Bouillon, Glazed Chestnuts and Galette Grand Caraque--(Foie Gras--I am getting hungry just writing about it--In one word, Awesome)

Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter ( I did not expect the soup to taste as good as it did.  The presentation was good with Black Truffle and Parmessan Cheese Shavings on the top)

Poussin   la Broche , Black Truffle, Fingerling Potatoes and Chanterelles--(This was a roasted chicken. They brought out the entire chicken for us to see, presentation was nice. The taste was simple, as simple as you can get with Black Truffle, but so good)
 
Slection de Fromages Affins-- (We got to choose from a variety of different cheeses.  In the end, we had a little bit of every single cheese. You could truly taste the quality of the cheeses)

Pear--( This was a dessert of items made out of Pear. Pear Sorbet and Roasted Pear. It wasn't too sweet. It was just right and the pear wasn't overly cooked it was still crisp)

Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream--(Speaks for itself) 

After this, they brought out a cart with some Petit Fours and different kinds of sweets. I enjoyed a rasberry lollipop made in house. I had to ask for another one it was that good.

The food was truly exceptional. The service was just as good. I noticed that Franck Savoy, the Chef's son, who happens to run the place was actively participating in serving and making us feel at home. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to see, ""the Boss"", working and not just pointing his finger and bossing his people around. This told me a lot about the philosophy of this particular restaurant. Did I mention, they were just awarded two (2) Michelin Stars for this restaurant this month. A very huge accomplishment--they are one of only three restaurants with two stars in Las Vegas. I have pictures of the plates and a copy of the menu. Email me if interested.

Excellent wine menu. Wonderful thought out dishes. A very enjoyable evening. 

Our table had the signature menu. It was $290 price fix per person for the signature menu plus all other . We were stuffed! We also added the truffle risotto as a extra course. The total of the bill was around 4k for the 5 of us. 

I will say that in paris, they customize the menu more then in vegas. It's a very different approach.

I would definitely go to Twist at the Mandarin or Joel Robuchon at the MGM before going here. The food was okay but too many dishes were pedestrian. I would try the chefs chocolate dessert and the duck main entree.  Those were solid. However, the lobster salad was chewy, they ran out of some bread, sea bass was tough, and our main entree actually had  a hair in it! The server and manager both didn't even offer to remove the entree from the bill even though it was a quarter eaten. I had to have the bill corrected twice. Not the level of service or food quality one would expect to receive from a restaurant of this alleged caliber. The more I type the more I lean towards a 1 star.

It's definitely pronounced Ghee Sav-wah and not Guy Sav-voy. My bad. This place is super upscale so you have to dress up. No hookers off Broadway here. No siree-Bob. You gotta work the Pretty Woman style in this place. You can't even tell whose niece is whose (joke peeps). It's dinner and reservation only. Call at least 2 weeks ahead depending on the season.

It may have been the pre-dinner dranks we had before shooting off to dinner, but I did get lost trying to find the place. You take a random elevator in Ceasars Palace to get there. There are literally MAYBE 12 tables in the entire place. When you are seated they place a little stool next to your seat for your feet? Because I'm really short...maybe? But no, it's for your purse.

We had the 9 course meal, but with the bread cart at the beginning and the dessert cart at the end it felt like a 12 course meal. That night they were serving:

Oysters in Ice Gelee,
Marinated Lobster, Salad and Gelee of Carrots and Autumn Herbs,
Crispy Sea Bass with Delicate Spices,
Colors of Caviar,
Foie-Gras ""en Papillotte"" and Radish Bouillon,
Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter,
Roasted Veal chop, Black Truffle Potato Puree, Young Vegetables Braised in Veal Jus,
Coconut (in Six Ways)
Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline and Chicory Cream

ALL OF IT WAS DELISH! Except for the radish bouillon, but that's because I think radishes taste like dirt. However, I will say that the radish balanced the richness of the foie-gras. Each course looked very small when it's first served, but each bite is rich and bold and the texture juxtaposes themselves so that it feels like you ate way more than what was served. Also, after wine, a 9 course meal, and of course the dessert cart in which you can choose one of each...you ARE full.

It's the first place I've ever seen with a guy who pairs your bread with each course. There is also another guy who vaccuums your table top between each course. The atmosphere is very French and very upper class. I was surprised when they sang Happy Birthday to me. All in all, I loved the experience and the food.

       Finally I got to write about Guy Savoy, a fan of chef Savoy for years as well as chef  Mathieu Chartron, Guy Savoy protégé  from Guy Savoy Paris, now leading the 2 Michelin Star Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace. Chef Chartron is the youngest head chef on Las Vegas strip leading the prestige kitchen. 

    He has been with chef Savoy since he was only 19 in Paris. I met chef Savoy and his wife many times, but this was the second time I met chef Chartron, and the first time walked to his kitchen. It's simply stunning in everything he does. 

    Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace has no flowers and his staff doesn't allow to wear colognes because he doesn't want his guests to be distract and disrupt the aroma of his rich food that he serves. How amazing is that?

     The Cognac room was stunning with extravaganza selection to small pour like no other place on the strip; and so the Krug Champagne room, I didn't want to leave this room :-)


      They also offer gluten free and vegan items, can you imagine that?

      Instead of the Signature Menu for $260 or Innovation Menu for $350, we decided to go with A La Carte this time, which ended up more than both menu, but it was worth it!
   
      The food is amazing, Innovation and signature menus display his top dishes that we got to try again and a few new dishes seasonal.

- 4 amuse bouche before our main courses.

- Bread cart presentation is always fun here, not that I need to eat any more breads

- Foie-Gras ""Bitter Infusion""  

- Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter  is TO DIE FOR 

- Roasted Turbot in Summer Crust, Smoked Eggplant Purée and Tomato Concassé was exquisite

- Crispy Line Caught French Sea Bass with Delicate Spices - the skin was super crispy flaky and the fish was moist, impressive

- The Wagyu steak and French Rivera lobster dish, special for $260 ouch, but worth every single penny! 

- Desserts and to go snack

WINES: I love the wine menu with its own table. I love how traditional the wine list here, unlike to modern places with iPad, let keep it classy in a leather cover where I can go page to page and drooling all over this Wine Spectator Grand Award wine list. Stunning Bordeaux and Champagne selection as well as Cognac, of course! 

- 1991 Chateau Troplong Mondot, Saint-Emilion Grand Cru, was a bargain find here for me.

- Ice Wine at $50 per glass, delicious

- 1950 Favilla Vieira Malvasia Madeira $75 be the glass, my kind of dessert was smooth, mocha, creme caramel, coffee, dried orange, nose; complex, very tart citrus, coffee grounds, orange honey on the palate; very long finish. 

      The service was impeccable from start to finish. Guy Savoy is truly a fine dining for special occasion, or just because you love finer food and great wines, just a perfect spot for ANY occasion!",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,12,6,5,lkVktFY7oBHrVSimNu0yrQ

We had both the executive chef and pastry chef come table side to prepare some extremely unique dishes (salmon ""cooked"" on dry ice....and the. dry aged pineapple cooked in a clay mold).

September 2012

This was my fourth meal at Guy Savoy - and my favorite. It might not be quite as good as Joel Robuchon, but it's close. This is Guy Savoy's top of the line offering. Expect to spend three to four hours, and perhaps more.

Even before the amuse bouche listed on the menu, some amuse bouches appear. First was truffle and foie gras vinaigrette on toast: a tasty morsel indeed. Next came a tiny Parmesan waffle. Lastly, a welcome back treat: a tiny wagyu beef tartare burger.

Guy Savoy is justifiably proud of its bread cart. You may choose any of more than a dozen varieties, or allow the bread steward to provide pairings appropriate to the menu. I opted for the latter. Even before the meal, slices of rosemary and juniper fougasse appeared. Unfortunately, the bread was delicious (lemon bread was a favorite). By the fourth course, I requested that my bread plate be removed; I was filling up far too fast. Beware!

**At last, the menu's amuse bouche arrived: a small cup of the restaurant's famous Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche with Black Truffle Butter. The soup had a stronger truffle flavor than I remembered, and was the better for it. A good start.
**Concassé of Oysters. A small saucer of chopped oysters, seaweed and lemon granité. I really enjoyed this dish, comprising strong tastes: briny oysters, seaweed, acid. I was still eating bread at this point; the pairing was seaweed bread.
**Sea Urchin. Sea urchin is a favorite of mine. It was of good quality, firm with good flavor.  In addition to black rice, the plate had small drops of egg yolk, lime puree and olive oil. My only criticism is that the mild, delicate sea urchin was a little overwhelmed by the strong flavors, as well as the very firm rice.
**Caviar. One of the restaurant's trademarks is the little surprises that come with the food. For example, a plate may have a hidden compartment which contains yet another little goodie. In the case of the caviar, tiny potatoes made up the ""rocks"" mentioned on the menu. Smoked sabayon came inside a whole egg shell; the server cracked open the shell, and voila! How can a caviar dish like this fail? Very good.
**Salmon Iceberg. This was my next to favorite dish. The server placed wild Alaskan salmon on a block of dry ice, searing it with cold. Accompanying the salmon were diced citrus, tiny blocks of chervil gelée, a finger lime (made up of tiny caviar-like spheres of pulp), bok choy and a delicious broth. The contrasts were remarkable: hold/cold; sour/rich; soft/crunchy. Excellent lemon bread accompanied the dish.
**Lobster and Peaches. This was a fairly simple dish, but the addition of peaches was interesting: pieces of peach, as well as peach gelée. Hidden in a depression in the center of the plate was a few spoons of chopped lobster and chanterelles. Overall, very good.
**Foie Gras. I hate to be predictable, but this was my favorite dish of the evening. Two one-inch cubes of foie gras were seared until crispy on the outside, but buttery rich on the inside. Instead of a sweet foil, mild horseradish was provided, along with potato chip broth. I wouldn't have thought these were good accompaniments, but they were. I may have had better foie gras in the past, but none comes to mind right now.
**Duck. Two pieces of smoked roast duck, with natural gravy, some kind of tuile, carrot puree, and a small cylinder of carrot stuffed with duck. This was a fairly plain dish, but prepared very well; I liked it a lot.
**Wagyu Beef. Two squares of Australian wagyu, very nicely marbled, with saffron sauce. Simply done, excellent quality.
**Mousse de Comté. A very light foam of cheese, served with walnuts and mustard greens. This was an odd cheese course, but pretty good.
**""Sunny Side Up."" This was another of Guy Savoy's playful dishes. Consisting of Greek yogurt, mango puree, cracked pepper, and a strip of French toast, it really did look like an sunny side up egg -- even the way a partially cooked egg yolk runs. My taste buds told me one thing, my eyes another. Refreshing and fun.
**Raspberry. This dessert consisted of layers of raspberry sabayon, something crunchy, ice cream, raspberry drupelets, and raspberry gelée. based on its description, this is a dessert that should have been very good, but I didn't find it exciting.
**Chocolate. A small dollop of intensely chocolaty ice cream; served on a cube of ice so it wouldn't melt too quickly. I'm a sucker for chocolate, so of course I liked this dessert.
**Mignardises. The after-dessert dessert cart was as bounteous as ever. I was too full to select more than a gluttonous number. Worthy of  mention was home made grape soda. Jokingly described by the server as ""Pepto Bismal,"" it was claimed to be a (non-alcoholic) digestif.

The meal was $350, plus drinks, tax and tip.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,6,2,5,YjSUE3ZFP08cflG0fM4J6g

My expectations were high, this is definitely not my first Michelin Star rodeo (I've been to French Laundry, Gary Danko, and Acadia Chicago before), I was beyond excited and my taste buds were ready for another journey. 
My party of 3 had a reservation (it was one of my friend's bday), we were greeted at the door and seated promptly near the patio area. We decided on the Signature Menu, which is ~$300/person. 
~ Let's get started ~
First of all ~ water costs $10/bottle. Ask for 'tap water' if you free water, otherwise if you just ask for water, you'll be charged on the bottle price.

** Amuse-Gueule **

Foie Gras with Black Truffle
Yummy foie gras with a delicious black truffle on top of a toast. 

Zuchini Soup with Celery Seed Powder
A refreshing yet fragrant soup. Finish that for a surprise underneath :)

They push a bread cart in with soooooo many choices of bread. They'll explain what each type of bread is and then you can get as much bread as you want. But eat in moderation, because the good parts are still ahead!

** Courses **

Colors of Caviar
Pretty amazing. It's a treat for the eyes and for your taste buds. A lot of fine dining restaurants nowadays have caviar, but they execute it in a way that doesn't do it justice. It's a very delicate ingredient with a lot of flavors, and omg Guy Savoy certainly brings out the best of it. And the different colors and the presentation is just the extra ""oomph"" that makes a good dish great.

Crispy Sea Bass with Delicate Spices
Probably one of my favorite dishes of the night, the skin is super crispy, the meat is flaky, fish is moist and very flavorful. Cooked to perfection.

Foie Gras with Bitter Infusion
They bring a tea pot to your table where they mix the green tea and consomme to make the infusion. Then they bring the foie gras and pour the infusion around it. The foie gras is not really seared as I would preferred, but still nevertheless pretty good. The combination of the foie gras and the infusion taste kinda rich but pleasantly flavorful.

Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup
Served with a warm buttery brioche. You should dip it into the soup to give it more of a taste. A lot of earthy ingredients in this.

Filet Mignon with Bone Marrow
Tender, flavorful, quite tasty actually. Bone marrow tasted a little weird (I don't like grainy meats), but the filet tasted divine. 

Cheese Cheese Cheese!
Pick your cheese! They bring a cheese cart to you with a variety selection of cheeses. They briefly go over each cheese and you can select 3-4 different cheeses to try.

** Desserts **

Coconut 6 Ways
Amazing combination of textures fit into one tiny cup. Very refreshing!

Strawberry
Who doesn't like strawberries? Strawberry sorbet with fresh strawberries. Taste refreshing!

Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream 
If you love chocolate, then you're going to love this. It'll take your taste buds on a magical ride to chocolate heaven. Not too sweet, surprisingly light, and tastes delicious.

You think you're done? Noope!! You get more desserts (because who doesn't like desserts?) They push out a cart filled with a variety of desserts. If at this point you're still not full yet, go ahead and get all the desserts on the cart!

It's an adventure of a lifetime, and your taste buds will be pleasantly surprised! Your wallet on the other hand is gonna hate you, but it's totally worth it. While it doesn't deserve a perfect 5-star rating in my opinion, it comes pretty close to it (I would give it a 4.5 stars if I could). :)",UziJPRoSOgZwDZ2qXxrU3Q,10,7,4,SWlmnsrN5Kp8BqkRk9xhWA

Each course was like a mini ritual, from watching them curl little individual trays of echire butter from a large tower to picking out our selections of bread, watching the tableside cold seared salmon to the the opening of our clay cured pineapple with a mini mallet.  Aside from beautiful presentation, the flavours very well balanced.  Funny enough, the my least favourite dish is what was supposed to be their best known dish - the truffle soup.  

Many places with fixed menus do not allow substitutions, yet I was very pleasantly surprised to hear that they did.  We had one in our group that did not like seafood, and they graciously accommodated his needs.  

Well worth a visit.",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,2,1,5,6mpzJ_YKlNJu8j1KwEYR1g
5863537,2010-01-09,4,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Terrible, I mean, really terrible if you're vegetarian.  While reserving a table over the phone, I was told that they can do vegetarian meals, no problem! Well, there was no vegetarian menu and what the chef put together was so incredibly bland (and small), I've had better 'custom vegetarian' meals from places charging 1/3 of the price. If you want a top French restaurant that does amazing vegetarian meals, try 'alex' at the wynn casino.
The arrogance of the French waiter at guy savoy just added insult to injury. A friend found a bullet in his meat meal - the waiter's comment? - 'oh, that's the 3rd time this week' he says with a smile.. - no apology, nothing!! He just acted as if it was normal. 
Prices are astronomical and not worth the poor quality. 
The bread is good. Desert average. ($25 each - haha), the best thing was the appetizer.",pSSWwegzWDld-GJF2gsEkw,4,1,1,Ph1lrxd_4RG3aIF49sUXbA

We had a large group and everyone was promptly served, wine was quickly refilled and as expected a 5 star experience was had by all. I had turbot to start which was white, flakey and delicious. Followed up with Beef Wellington , amazingly tender, light pastry with a spinach buffer. Topped with Foie Gras, I'm still dreaming about it. Too much? Sorry. Boy oh boy I like this place, if money was easy to print, and calories could just be deleted, I'd come here everyday.

There are many fab restaurants in Vegas and we are lucky to live here, this has to be top 5?",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,2,2,5,eMQxqlAAp98iB4n2_cr-Xg
5908550,2015-04-18,1,P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ,"Special occasion for a milestone anniversary. Guy Savoy didn't disappoint in the wow factor and decadence. Beautiful modern decor. Service was outstanding and attentive, over the 3 hour ""event"".  We ordered the innovation 14 course menu, $375 pp. 

While it's hard to complain about the quality, care and uniqueness that goes into each dish, I can't say I was completely satisfied as each consisted of about 2 bites. I was expecting the main courses of wagyu or seabass at least to be entree sized. Instead, the entire menu was appetizer sized.  I left full, but can't say completely satisfied. I would rather have less courses with more than just a taste of each.  

This is more of an event than a mere dinner. It provided us with great memories of a grand french meal fit for royalty. We will always remember ""the time we spent $1000 at that great place in Caesars"".",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,4,ZqDSF-gk46ydPJWxS_tdWw
