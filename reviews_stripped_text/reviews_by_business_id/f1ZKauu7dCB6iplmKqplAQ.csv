We ordered a fresh fish closer to 2 pounds  $32.00 per pound from fish tank and a waiter showed to us, then took to kitchen. All of the dishes come out and almost finished, then the steam fresh fish come out.  A fish comer with lot of ginger and green onion, we put ginger and green onion on side.  We noticed the fish is freeze fish, not fresh fish.   Fresh fish is taste completed difference of freeze fish. I think every one knows how is fresh fish and how is freeze fish taste. We told waiter about.  He was sorry about and  willing to take $10 off from our bill.  I said the fish cost $57.00 dollars, only took $10 off is better not take off.  We paid full price for freeze fish $57.00.  After that, I never go back to this terrible restaurant again.  I am local.  There are many Chinese restaurant in China town Las Vegas.

We are from the Eastcoast USA, so we were eager to experience great West Coast Chinese food.  We were very disappointed, both in the food and the service.   We had a large variety of dumplings-all seemed like the same things you can get in the frozen section of an Asian food store.  The Xiaolong Bao was undercooked and without flavor-straight from the frozen packet.

We were there the day after Christmas.  Maybe that was a mistake, as the place was mobbed and in spite of calling ahead and being told we had a table, had to wait over half an hour to sit down.

I took a bite and literally spat it out. The inside of the shumai was still pink and the typical hot juicy clear liquids bursting with flavor was no where to be found. Not only did these 3 items sit at the table for our entire meal without anyone acknowledging it (even as we pointed out how there was no steam and they were cold to the touch to multiple cart ladies), they had the audacity to send out the manager to argue with us and say the only reason it was cold was because we let it sit there the whole meal! I was so appalled that I wanted it thrown away and she insists she wants to make us another batch. Uhm suck it. They refused to take it off our check even then!

They seemed to be inconvenienced when we asked for water.  And when half of our food was cold we sent it back and asked to cancel it but they brought it back out. When we declined it they walked away chatting in Chinese.   

The food itself was nothing to be excited about. The house soup that they served, which is complimentary, looked and tasted like old soup that they didn't want to waste.  The pork spare ribs looked unappetizing. 

Not to mention the tanks full of ""live"" seafood looked fine until you see the 2 dead fish floating. And the oral excrement left sitting in the bathroom sink didn't help with my already unsettled stomach.",TNiHgUW9V1bAnxaDp2WkQw,1,1,1,Dp-GDCCGeCIVhTs8AaP3QQ

1306889,2016-05-22,1,f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ,"So I haven't had dim sum in a while and the only place I had tried in Vegas prior to HK was Ping Pang Pong, which was as far as I can remember, decent but nothing extremely WOW. I'm no super expert on dim sum but being from the Bay Area and eating at many of the places there like Yank Sing, I'd like to think I know at least a bit.

First of all, I'm used to there being a wait. I don't know why but no matter what place you went to in the Bay Area, there was ALWAYS a line. Especially on Sunday. The place was fairly full but thankfully there was a table open for myself and 2 others ready to go! Just be aware that the girl behind the front counter is more there to ring you out at the end of the meal than to greet/seat you. We waited for a few beats before someone came and got us.

Service was good, the carts stopped often, gracefully passed us when it looked like our table was pretty full already, stopped when we asked and we had people clearing plates/filling drinks/asking if things were okay. Our drink orders were taken as soon as we sat down and came out promptly. Just beware, they serve their tea HOT. You may want to wait for it to cool down a bit and pouring from the side instead of straight ahead helps. Our tablecloth still got a bit wet in the process though.

Everything tasted pretty on point, though I was sad they didn't seem to have any xiaolongbao, and to me, had just enough oil to help my cousin with his hangover, lol! We had:

1 kai lan/Chinese broccoli
1 har cheung/shrimp noodle rolls
2 har gow/shrimp dumplings
2 siu mai/pork & shrimp dumplings
1 lohr bahk go/pan fried turnip cake
1 daan taat/egg tart
1 bo luo bao/pineapple custard bun

And one dish stood out to me because I don't ever remember seeing it at any other places. and if I have and just didn't order it before, well shame on me because I've been missing out! It's basically like a sesame ball but it's filled with char siu instead of red bean paste, only the bottom has sesame seeds and it's mostly steamed with only the bottom being pan fried a bit. It's then covered with green onions and just tasted DIVINE! It's a bit funny getting through the mochi exterior but as it's fairly plain flavored, it compliments the sweetie and meaty taste of the char siu well. Both my cousin and I were really happy with it!

All together, was $55 before tip. Not bad, if you ask me! Overall, a very solid dim sum place! Took home what we couldn't finish and am happy to have leftovers for later! Will happily come back again and share this place with others!",ZsaaG2KF5PrCRNXH0JyjUg,3,0,4,pFNONXf2GTK6bqjyrlJwSg

My family and I absolutely love dim sum, so when I saw this new place we had to give it a shot. When walking in, we could already tell the ambiance change compared to when it was Cathay house. Much cleaner, however very compact when it came to the seating.

Whenever we go eat dim sum, we usually order the Yang Chow fried rice from the actual menu to accompany the dim sum. There was nothing too special for the fried rice, and it was very very greasy.

The menu breaks down their prices based on the size of the dish, and it was very confusing considering some of the items weren't even provided on the break down. Because dim sum is pay per order, we usually calculate how much we are getting so we know what to expect when the bill comes. Due to the confusion in pricing, we spent over budget.

The actual dim sum itself wasn't as satisfying as we hoped it would be. We ordered the shumai, steamed pork bun, shrimp ball, and chicken feet. The best item was in fact the shrimp ball! It definitely took me back to when I use to get authentic dim sum in downtown California. 

The water was obviously from the tap, and the taste was so bad we had to order other refreshments to accompany our meal...

Overall, I would never go out of my way to come back here because there are other establishments  I enjoy like Orchid Garden.

We did run into a problem with not being asked what tea we wanted (one of the first things they ask you when you are seated), and we notified them after sitting around. They were sincerely apologetic, and I was surprised because most dim sum places wouldn't think twice about it. The ladies pushing the cart were also friendly. Didn't give us that ""whatever"" attitude. At one point, we finished all our food and no more carts were pushed out. Again, sat around then flagged someone down. Service was great as they were also apologetic, and the guy offered to bring over the dishes we wanted. 

ENVIRONMENT; 2/5
I definitely think they could work on how the place looks. Maybe they are still in the process of decorating since they are new? I felt like I was eating in a prison room as there were nothing on the walls at all. Oh well...I am here for the food.

FOOD; 3.5/5
Unfortunately, I realized that I did not get to try more of what they had to offer which is why I'm docking off stars. Maybe because we came after peak lunch hours, but still disappointing. They should've been prepared.  I heard good things about their flowing custard bun (lau sa bao), but they said they were out. Wanted to try as it is one of my favorites, and good ones are nonexistent in Vegas. They apparently have soup dumplings too (xiao long bao) but none were available.

Shrimp dumplings (ha gow), rice noodle roll (cheung fan), and egg tarts (dan tat) were very good. Shrimp dumplings were juicy and loved the soy sauce they use for their rice noodle roll though I'll admit that noodle was not as silky as I would have wanted it. I would say that their egg tarts are more true to Hong Kong style aka flaky crust!",uuscKYelhweXn_fLVtcf5A,7,2,3,8eJLEZ0JeJ2WW5Cq7qG4DQ

I visited this place on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and the place was packed with locals.  Seeing many local Chinese at a Chinese restaurant is a good sign that the food is good to great.  I was not disappointed as the variety of dim sum was plentiful and everything tasted freshly made and delicious.  The atmosphere was bustling, and noisy as can be expected in a popular dim sum restaurant.  Carts circled around tables frequently so there were no dead spots where you sat waiting to see what was next in offerings.  You won't be disappointed at this place.  This will be my ""go to"" place when I'm in Vegas for sure.  Oh yes, and don't forget the Jin Dui (fried seseme balls with red beans inside), and the egg tarts.

The Peking Duck is presented nicely on steamed buns and the rest of the duck is served on a platter.  Spare ribs, pan fried noodles, and broccoli oh yes!  The broccoli has a nice crunch to it and the black bean sauce on the ribs is outstanding, not too salty.

My Pops always orders the sweet and sour pork, and I have to give him props for actually trying the other dishes this time.  Way to go Pops!

The dim sum, is so so.  I ideally would prefer to just come for dinner. 

-----------------

Dim Sum:

Almost all of the dim sum choices were par for the course.  The individual reviews are going to be super picky but for a dim sum place with that many small portions of food it was good. 

1) The shrimp dumplings were correctly sized, although one problem was the skin broke away on the bottom.  

2) The turnip cake was ok, but I generally like them with a bit of texture from the solid turnip cuts. the one here was either just all flour or very very well processed turnip. 

3) Shiu Mai was par for the course and just down right good.

4) Lotus Sticky Rice was good, but could have used a bit more meat inside.

5) The yellow bean custard buns were solid, could have used a bit lighter coloring but overall good.

6) The egg tarts, were the star of dim sum.  I have never eaten an egg tart that tasted like that one did, butter.  It's clear that the chef loves butter and egg tarts because the aromatics were there, which enhanced the overall experience. 

All in all, there might be better dim sum but this is a good choice in Las Vegas right now

Dinner:

For dinner get the pork belly and pickled vegetables and here's one for adventurous souls who want to try a traditional home cooked dish, try the steamed minced pork cake and salted fish.  For those who know how to speak canto the direct literal translation is (salted fish + steamed + pork meat + cake)

After one bite of the minced pork cake and salted fish I felt like I was the reviewer in movie Ratatouille.  The flavor was on point and the pork cake was tender and juicy just like when my aunt had cooked for me when I was 5. There truly is no comparison but be prepared the chef does have a very good salted fish and well..it's salty and flavorful, which is rare these days.

I ordered several dim sum items, including fried shrimp & pork wontons, har gao, steamed pork buns & lotus rice and about 5 other dumpling type items. The service despite there being only 2 other customers when I arrived was quite slow & unfriendly. My server seemed annoyed at the presence of customers. Overall, the food was just ok. Nothing to write home about for most items I ordered. However, the fried shrimp wontons were fried a bit too long so they were dark brown & crunchy as opposed to golden & crispy as you'd want them, the har gao was a little on the cold side, and the steamed pork buns had been steamed so long they exploded. Also, despite not asking me if I was done & before everything I'd ordered came out, the server brought me a check for the items she'd brought out. While I appreciate them not attempting to charge me for food I hadn't gotten, she again seemed annoyed when I pointed out I hadn't gotten all my food yet. Ultimately they came out, buns blown out as mentioned. Overall the place was mediocre & unfriendly and I couldn't help but wonder why food cooked in steamer baskets came out so slowly.

2876411,2018-05-17,0,f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ,"Took my grandparents here for some dim sum since it's their absolute favorite thing in the world! We've been to all the dim sum spots around town, and this is the place we frequent most. It gets extremely busy here, even on weekdays, so plan for a bit of a wait on weekends and especially during holidays.

The dim sum is served traditionally, rolled out on carts categorized by steamed, stewed, or baked and fried. I prefer this style way more over the menu cards with check mark selections. You can usually pick out what's hot and fresh, but the ladies pushing the carts are always awesome and will tell you what's good. I can tell you right now that buns straight out the oven, esp the custard pineapple buns, are sinfully delicious.

The food here seems to be hit or miss depending on the day, and on the really busy days when you've got continuous fresh dim sum being rolled out, it's the best dim sum you'll find in Vegas. Today we picked out a couple of our favorites and most were just average but some were really good. A breakdown of what we got based on today's quality:
-Shrimp dumplings (har gow)- 5/10 dim sum classic, they usually do it right but today the crystal wrapper was a tad undercooked
-Pork siu mai- 6/10 again a classic and highly recommend here, but skimping on shrimp today
-BBQ pork pastry (char siu su)- 8/10 bangin'! Perfectly flakey crust with tons of BBQ pork filling
-Fried dough wrapped in rice noodle (zha liang)- 10/10 always good and our absolute favorite here!!! You gotta put in a special order request for it and they make it to order, which is awesome bc that means the you tiao is crunchy! Secret it menu tip: add cilantro to the cheung fun! Comes with hot sauce, peanut sauce, hoisin, and soy sauce
-Chicken feet- 7/10 huge chicken feet today, I love their sauce and the flavor penetrated to the bone
-Baked BBQ pork bun (char siu bao)- 8/10 you gotta catch these fresh out the oven and we got 'em fresh. Maybe they changed their dough recipe but it's airier than usual
-Radish cake (lo bak go)- 7/10 perfect texture and taste, full of shredded radish goodness, missing the crisp exterior as it was the last one sitting on the cart for a while
-Sesame balls- 9/10 can't go wrong with these. Soft, chewy dough, heavy on the sesame flavor. Lovely red bean filling
-Water chestnut cake- 10/10 some of the best water chestnut cake I've ever had! Slightly sweet and lightly pan fried for a hint of crisp

Overall a wonderful dim sum experience today as always. This is really one of the best spots for dim sum here in Vegas, and if you want authentic food look no further than here. Prices are great and portions are on par with other dim sum places. I really don't understand the reviews on the bad service. It is typical of Chinese restaurants to leave you to enjoy your food in peace and get you in and out ASAP, so if you walk into any traditional spot, don't expect 5 star service. The service here is fast if you can flag someone down, and the people are always friendly and love to chat with my grandparents",4ywoghefRTsbi1SzkR-fcA,2,1,4,2bRSiELVtwzXWhWQ3DEcgA

Then again there was only 2 of us but they sat us at a table that was enough for 6.

The dim sum was great. My son's fav was the shrimp dumpling with cilantro. he could not get enough of those. Mine had to have been the beef tendon with rice noodle, (Ngow Lam). Doubt that I spelt that correctly. In any case, it had been years since I had had this dish and it was awesome. I had the steamed tripe, salt and pepper shrimp, BBQ Pork buns, (little bit too sticky and needed more filling - East West on Eastern Ave. rivals this one for sure), shrimp dumplings and steamed pork ribs.

Needed another napkin which I never got.

I really enjoyed this beef tendon and rice noodle dish that I've never seen at other dim sum places. It's more of a normal lunch dish, but was good to share among a large group. Beef tendon was really soft and savory.

shumai - Really savory and juicy, somehow significantly better than other versions I've had. Really standout. 

egg tarts - They are amazing. Seriously get them, really nice flaky crust and soft egg custard center. 

seaweed salad - Surprised to see this at dim sum, looks like seaweed salad from Japanese restaurants, but it was really good. Nice of have some ""veggies"" in the otherwise meat/seafood and fried foods heavy dim sum meal. 

tofu skin wrap - This was also very juicy and delicious.

So quickly looking up another dim sum place since we were only a few streets over from Spring Mountain, we found this place.

We pulled into the parking lot and it was packed. My husband dropped me off so he could find parking. This place was crazy, but of course because it was Chinese New Year. We ended up getting seated in the ""party"" room which was almost full. 

I'm just going to list what was wrong...
1. We were seated next to a door that I thought was locked, but the smokers kept going in and out of. Eventually an employee locked the door for me as I made a motion that I was cold. As one of the smokers tried to re-enter, he was startled that the door was locked. My husband gave him the look and hand motion, Go Around!
2. The table linen was soiled from the previous diners. Ugh!
3. The tea pot! Was it someone elses tea pot and they just refilled it with more tea leaves and hot water! Their was tea leaves stuck to the top of the lid. As I looked around the other tables, they had nice clean tea pots!.
4. Wait time. I know, it was Chinese New Years.

And because the list of things above made me feel icky, so did the utensils and dishes. Even though they appeared and felt clean, unless I knew it was fresh and hot out of the wash, it was still icky for me.

Our server did apologize for the wait and thanked us for our patience.

We ordered house pan fried noodles, honey walnut shrimp, sweet sour pork, and opted for house fried rice instead of white rice. At least the food was good.  Unfortunately, we didn't get the dim sum we was hoping for.

Today is Christmas and the service today really blew my mind. Servers were extremely rude in Chinese, giving us looks and telling us ""if it's not hot don't eat it !!!"". What in her right mind she have the right to say that to guests dining in this establishment. 

I tried ordering food, before I can order a second plate they pushed the dim sum carts and ran. So I had to shout for them to return so I can properly order my dim sum. Secondly I ordered my pork bun to be reheated, 20 minutes. That lady went MIA with it. For god sake she stamped my card for it too !!! 

The food is always good, but the service is a joke. Probably one of the worst service I've seen in Las Vegas. Poor management needs to get their stuff straighten out.

How many here can speak chinese?  Well, for those that raised their hands, you'll probably think this place is OK.  For those like me that aren't able to speak chinese, there may be a chance that you'll have a tough time here and basically be ignored.

We got here right around lunch time on a Saturday and were seated quickly even though it was pretty packed.  First question from the young hostess was what kind of tea we'd like.  I asked her if they had black tea and she said she had no idea what black tea was...really?  She said they have oolong tea so that's what we ended up with.

First few minutes, the ladies rolling carts noticed we just arrived and had an empty table so the carts quickly came by and stopped to see if we were interested.  After about 4-5 cart visits, we had some pork shu mai, a char siu pork in sort of a pastry, some rice noodles with bbq beef, and some fishcake balls with chives in them.  These all were so-so, not good, not bad, but pretty much just OK.

I was really hoping for some xiao long bao and some char siu bao but no carts had any.  I asked one of the cart ladies if we could just order them but she said those would be coming around soon so we waited.   After about 10 minutes with the same carts with the same food going by we got the attention of one of the servers in black and tried to order them from her.  An attempt at a discussion went back and forth between us for a bit and it was finally revealed that she can't speak english so she gave up and walked away.

A few more minutes go by and all the same cart ladies with all the same food go back and forth by us and they know we're not interested in the food they have so they don't look our way.   Busboys scurry to and fro clearing plates and turning over tables.  Servers in black shuffle around the dining room bantering with diners lucky enough to speak the language. And we kind of just sat there feeling invisible for what was a good 20 minutes.  I see a guy who I think was the manager and ask for the check.  He notices we don't have too much to total up  and asks ""is this all you guys are having?""  I answer back, ""yep, we're definitely done here"" and that was definitely the truth.

One thing to add, the table of four behind us was having the same problem as we were...difficulty communicating and no one coming by.  After a long time, one of them actually got up and chased down one of the speedy busboys that didn't already have his hands full so I know I'm not just being an overly picky diner.  I've had A LOT of dim sum in my time, some good and some not so good and sadly this place is at the bottom of the rung.

Shu Mai! I could eat this all day. It was juicy and the flavor was on point.

We tried other dishes, but really their shu mai was my favorite. I also liked the sticky rice and their egg tarts. Yum!

They push the carts around for dim sum - one with fried foods, steamed dim sum, noodles/veggies, and rice porridge. They don't all come out at the same time. We found out they had a noodle cart just about when we were too full to eat anymore.

Then, to top it off, they had no paper towels. 

The food was alright. It's your typical dishes and nothing special. The lady pushing around the cart with the fried shrimp came back to give me a fresh batch, which was nice. Service wasn't spectacular. I asked one lady for a fork and a couple of sodas, and she didn't quite understand me and went to grab another lady.

The member of our group who is going to Taiwan stopped in the week before and reserved the private room for us.  The place has been renovated a bit with the main part of the restaurant now all on one floor.  Opposite the entrance and down a few steps is the private room with its large, round table with lazy Susan for easy sharing.  One problem with the room though is the carts have no way of coming down the steps to the room so you order what you want but you can't see it like we used to as the carts are wheeled around.  A few times one of the women brought a dish to the room to see if we wanted but for the most part, our Asian friend ordered for us.

We got the standard pork shumai, steamed pork buns, sesame balls, and rice noodle rolls.  In addition, there was an order for Singapore noodles and chow fun.  The Singapore noodles were quite good with a good amount of curry.  The food was OK for our lunch.

Once walking through the doors I smelled the wreaking of a wet mop slapping me in the face. Very sour and pungent smell and lurks around. Everything else around wasn't opened till later so I still decided to sit down and eat. The tea we ordered wasn't even hot, Luke warm at its best.

Once ordering a few dishes I was just making sure this dish I ordered was warm, the waitress comments back saying ""then don't eat it if it isn't warm"" this got me furious. Just a simple question making sure the dish I wanted was warm but she decided to be very rude. Probably won't be coming back here or suggesting a place like this to people I call friends or family.

-String Beans with XO Sauce
-Dried Bean Curd with Shredded Pork

They have complimentary soup during dinner time which is nice especially in a cold winter night. I ordered foie gras with truffles with an Asian twist and that was excellent. Creamy foie gras melts in your mouth and amazingly good. Will probably order this again. 
Hubby wanted the tried and true seafood tofu hotpot and salt pepper pork chop, and they did not disappoint. 
Service was excellent which is unusual in a real Chinese place. Our server checked on us several times and refilled our teapot without us asking. They also offered complimentary sweet red bean dessert after our meal.
 
I'm docking one star as the place itself is old and dated although they tried hard to renovate it. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I want with trash can almost full to the brim. Maybe because we came late night almost closing time for our meal?

The food cart doesnt come around as often since its makes its turn in the main dining room first and then heads into the new area on the side. The wine and liquor selection have significantly expanded its inventory by added a dozen California reds, Moutai and some premium selection of liquor.

I came here with a party of 7 on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:15 pm. I had called earlier to make sure they still served dim sum and they also took my reservation! 

We came at 12:15 pm and they were in a scurry to clean our table and seat is. Okay, that's fine. But the whole point of ""??"" is to drink tea along with your food! We didn't get any service for tea 20 minutes into dining even though the cart ladies were already bombarding us with options. 

We ordered quite a bit! 
-Fung Zhao (chicken feet) // classic dish. Pretty sweet, not spicy enough. But not bad for what they had! 

-Har gau (steamed shrimp dumpling) // Okay, this was butchered. Not so crystal skin and it was cold and falling apart. 

-Siu Mai (open topped steamed pork or shrimp dumplings) // a bit too oily for the pork! But still yummy. *Be warned, we found a piece of hair in this. Luckily we could exchange it...*

-Jiu Cai Bau (fried wheat starch skin dumpling with chives) // yum! I would get again. It was a bit on the oily side but stuffed with good amount of meat and thin skin. 

-Cha Siu Bao (steamed BBQ pork stuffed buns) // Mehhh. I'm not a huge fan of this item regardless of where I get it. 

-Cheong Fan (rolled rice noodles) // errrr. Probably one of the worst I've had. Not big and soft like other places! This was tiny and stale....too much soy sauce added and really cold! The beef one was gross, shrimp was doable. Luckily we didn't order too many! 

-Pei Guen (steamed tofu skin roll) // Classic dish that I love! They did okay with this- you seriously can screw up steaming this. But the only complaint I have is that the stuffing inside was way too little and did not have the classic bamboo shoots. 

-Lo Mai Gai (steamed glutinous rice) // Not flavorful at all, and barely half a teaspoon of stuffing in the center. Regret! 

-Daan taat (egg custard tart) // This was a disappointment (like everything else). But I guess it's good for the kiddos! 

-bowl of intestine soup // too sweet, but I love intestines regardless. 

-bowl of pig blood soup // not a super clean taste- can still taste some of the ""freshness"". Good portion though! 

-plate of stir fried beef and rice noodles // Good! Pretty decent potion, not too oily and enough beef for everyone. 

Pros: 
-Helpful service. They were patient and helpful with out questions and needs. 
-cheap? I would say for 8 people, we only paid $85 before tax. 

Cons: 
-Not a lot of options rolling around. And I mean, literally, rolling around. The classic Cheong fan wasn't being served unless you requested it! 
-No menus. It's nearing lunch time and I would think that you'd give us a lung menu too since the cart ladies were taking off! You'd have to be a frequent here to be able to understand what they are doing...

Tips/Observations: 
-parking lot is small! Be prepared to circle around.

The best egg custard you can find ANYWHERE. Read review that said it is flaky, well, that is what it is supposed to be. Takes a lot of work to make it like that (the crust). 
Price, clearly the best you can find in Vegas. About half the price of Ping pang Pong whose food quality is sporadic anyway (stuffed pepper barely warm and nowhere near hot by the time you get it off the cart).
Service? definitely depends on how busy it is (like any other restaurants). I don't find the service to be anywhere as bad as what other reviewers described. If there is a plumbing problem (which can happen anywhere), clearly the workers would be a lot busier and service won't be up to par. I think it is unfair to hold that against any restaurant unless the plumbing problem is frequent.

I LOVE Chinese food but for some reason I have a hard time finding a place thats actually authentic & not Panda Express. This is definitely one of the better Dim Sum restaurants you'll find in Vegas. The whole experience is right on point as it should be. Such a great variety of food and its all delicious from the Noodles to the Tea! You'll want to come back after eating here because like me I was way too full to try everything. We had fried noodles, fried fish, shrimp balls, shumai, coconut bread, custard pie, sesame balls & more. The best thing, this place is so reasonable! Only $50 for all that food & a few more plates after. I've noticed a lot of the bad reviews are about the lack of service. Honestly it's a Dim sum restaurant not fine dining. So if you're looking for a place where one server checks on you every 5 minutes this ain't the place for you. Although, I had no issues getting help when needed from different staff members. It's a fast pace environment where they will help you all you have to do is ask. I will be coming here again & again.",C85t8w88IT7oeRMjRZkyxw,0,0,5,jOk8f8qyUjJVmIFgjaw5nQ

It's a busy spot right off Spring Moutain Rd.  The parking here first off is BASURA! So if you want to get some good parking you got to have patience.  So once you get a spot you are good.  First, YELP and CHECK IN because you get 5% off for lunch and 10% for dinner.  We came in for Dim Sum at 11:30 am and the food was fresh and ""GUCCI!"" The food carts were on clock work.  The ladies were loud and pushy.  You get a good workout standing up and down looking at their selection.  The food here has low msg.  I only felt half sleepy but maybe because I ate too much beef balls and turnip cake.  This place is good and clean.  I highly recommend this for lunch and big parties.

The Hong Kong Garden Seafood & Dim Sum Café was very welcoming. There were not many people in there at all, but that just means they have more time to give you attention . They have an extensive Dim Sum menu to choose from and a regular menu you may order from. It was kind of like when you get sushi, you choose from a list indicating the quantities you would like to receive. Next to the orders it tells you if it's a Small, Medium, Large, Specialty or Chef special. Each category is associated with a price point along the bottom of the Dim Sum selections page. 

We got Snails, Singapore Noodles, Beef Roll, Shrimp Dumplings, Baked Pork Buns, and more. Way to much food! It came out quick and they bring things as you finish them up so your table doesn't get full. The waitresses was really nice and helpful with selecting new things to try. 

From an aesthetics point of view, the restaurant did look a bit run down. The table was wobbly and the tea kept spilling on the table cloth. The waitresses did fix it by placing something underneath one of the legs but the table clothes was half wet after the fix.

Breakfast:  Hong Kong Garden Seafood

Summary - Good and perhaps the second best in Vegas.

Har Gao Benchmark - Relatively thin, translucent, highly glutinous crystal skin with good moisture content.  Shrimp within a good blend of previously frozen paste and pieces, well seasoned, MSG evident.

Service - Carts.
 
Price - In line.  Inexpensive.

Authenticity - 90% Asian / majority of that, Cantonese speaking clientele with a few misspellings in the menu.

Selection - All the standards.

Shu mai - Good blend of coarse and finely ground pork and shrimp paste.  MSG heavy (a good thing).  Wrapper, tough.  Very little crab eggs on top.
Beef ball - Spongy texture, somewhat airy, slightly sweet.
Steamed BBQ pork bun - Reheated?  Outside dry.  Filling very sweet. 
Chicken feet - Tender, pull apart.  Lots of flavor.
Beef tripe - Very tender.  Good ginger, sesame flavor punched up by MSG.
Beef tendon - Clean, tender, but not packing much flavor.
Egg tart - Flaky, lardy crust.  Custard sweetness well controlled.
Baked sweet cream bun - Warm. Crisp on the outside.  Cream filling overly sweet.
*Fried items not sampled.  All looked oily and as if they were sitting for a while.

Note - Cantonese not English is the language of choice.  Off menu special items and larger portions of favorites (ie tendon and tripe) offered only to ummm, ""preferred customers"".

The dim sum is $2.29 (S), $3.19 (M) and $3.39 (L).  They roll out the dim sum in carts, they come by and show you what is available.  Don't worry if you can't speak Cantonese, you just need to point to what you what.  For folks who are not familiar with dim sum, I suggest trying the steamed shrimp balls (har gau ?????) and beef balls (?????).  Avoid the chicken feet, could be too exotic for most folks.

The dry beef chow fun (????) for $7.95 has a great wok flavor, not too greasy, and a generous portion.  This like many of their other dishes are great values, it's hard to beat the quality and price.

The actual place isn't really sanitary but that's fine because i'm just here for the food! There's some of my recommendation below, but there's a couple of more dishes i don't remember the name of that's also my faves! This is located off the strip down spring mountain, and this location and orchid garden (i think that's what it's called) are pretty tasty but i recommend this place more! 

My recommendations: 
Har gow- Chewy with a lot of shrimps! 
Shu Mai- Moist and flavorful (chili & soy sauce) 
Pai Gwut- Yummy moist steamed pork ribs 
Gohk Char Siu Bao- Soft sweet gooey red Pork buns
Hom Sui Gok- So soft and glutinous savory pork buns 
Ngau Paak Yip- (soupy) with potatoes and hot tripes!!
Djeen Dui- Hot Sesame balls with red beans  
Crab Balls- W/ Mayo, w Sugar cane stick to munch!
Egg Tarts- So BUTTERY AND FLAKEY it's my fave here!!",sI8d5Usaa_2OzUj6cpvPUQ,5,3,5,uHHUkrMIvnJbrCH9eaSTuA

They treat you to a house soup to start, which is a ""soup of the day"" bone broth. Food came out hot and fresh and flavored well.  We had seafood dishes which included clams, scallops, shrimp all were fresh (the have live tanks displaying some fish and lobster as well).  After the meal, there was a dessert soup offered.

Food: Overall the food came out freah and hot. The common dim sum dishes was acceptable. Shiu Mai (Pork dumpling), Sticky rice in lotus leaf, Beef ball, and Steamed Rice Rolls was good. Egg Custard Tarts had a very good filling, the tart crust however needs improvement, it's a bit too flaky and falls apart. Turnip cake was too soft and fell apart, if they added a little more flour or starch to make it solid, then fry it, the outcome will be much better. Their Coconut Pudding was great, smooth coconut flavor and chewy.

Service: Grand opening, so the service is still smoothing out, which is underatandable. They servers did tey their beat to stay on top of things and went around frequently to check on refills, clear empty dishes, etc.

Atmosphere: The new owners remodeled the inside, closed out the old unused bar and moved it over to the fish tanks, which ia easier for servers to deliver drinks to us. The old bar location has been converted into a private VIP room. Leveled out the entire main dining room intl a single level, which made it better for access and looked nicer. New lighter shade of paint definitely brightened up the place. Flooring has been redone, tiles throughout the hallways and waiting area, carpet has been cleaned. Overall, no old food smell anymore.

As a Chinese/American who frequently eats at Dim Sum places in both China & America, I feel like I've been developing the ability to locate solid Dim Sum places. 

The atmosphere feels very authentic. Everyone, when we went, were Chinese people and the workers were Chinese as well. And the food tasted super authentic as well.

My standard for comparing Dim Sum places is usually comparing their chicken feet dish, since it's my favorite. Now, I don't say this lightly, but this was the best chicken feet I've ever had, in both America and China. Yes, I know, a crazy statement that defies the logic of ""its so much better in China"" which is usually totally true.

The chicken feet is meaty, a bit spicy, and served hot.

Food was ok at reasonable price ($25 before the tip), but there was not much dim sum to choose from (probably because it was a holiday?)

Spare ribs in black bean sauce (4/5): tasty, slightly spicy. Not much fat meat in spare ribs, which was good.

Chicken feet (4/5): well-cooked, great flavor with the sauce.

Fried taro dumpling (3.5/5): taste was good and was fried into nice shape, except that the dumpling was too large.

Tofu dessert (3.5/5): the syrup was too sweet, but overall it was good. Would be better if they offered brown sugar on it. 

BBQ pork pastry (2.5/5): the pastry was too thick, so that I could barely taste the pork.

Shrimp paste stuffed peppers (2/5): again the whole thing was huge and not much flavor added. 

Fried leek dumplings: I didn't try it, but my family did not seem to like it.

The décor, simple, fresh and clean without any clutter on the walls.  The cleanliness of the place including the tea pots (though mismatched) offers a sense of hope that my food will be wonderful.

The price point is just right, not too cheap and for pretty decent quality.  We didn't get charged for water or tea, so that was really cool.  I'm used to paying per person for tea in California.

If I had to nit-pick, the food is not covered. They walk around with the food completely exposed and the chances of the top ones getting cold by the time it reaches my table was pretty high. The likelihood of germs getting on them was pretty high too. It's a little cumbersome to lift all the covers, but it's all part of the cart process.  Am I the only one who got cold food even during peak lunch hour on a Monday?  That was a big factor for my 3 stars. 

Har gow- the dough was ripping off exposing the shrimp, had a really doughy taste so we'll have to pass next time.  Not my favorite dish to order and that fact it wasn't good made it worse.

Siu mai- Just like what it should taste like, meaty and never salty. 

Cheong fun- My husband enjoyed it, by the time I got to the last one, it was a folded too thick and the meat (never in abundance) was not quite the right ratio.

Char siu bao- The dough again for me wasn't on par.  It wasn't terrible, but the mixture of the red char siu is a mixture of sweet and salty and just ends my meal on a good note.

Chicken feet- oh yeah!! Not only it's considered a small dish price, it was delicious with the right amount of spice and the ooey gooey sauce that is lathered all over 4-5 pieces of this tender dish.

Bean curd vegetarian- Usually an awesome dish. A mixture of vegetables, water chestnuts and beautifully folded in bean curd. My lady gave me the top one and that is what left me with a sour note to my review.  I hate luke warm dim sum.

I'm spoiled by NYC dim sum but still enjoyed the food here.",h_wTwnV-9LiaJ4egXHtUAg,1,1,3,QkKBvbGld5PoiX3TVjYEfA

Don't know why they open without  prepared?I strongly consider the chief are Mexicans, cause the food get taste worse everytime. I will never be here no more",qg0PxHedWrPa5dWXvq_8uA,0,0,1,dWwaNKuq6Mq4vNb7uoqAyw

A little background - my dad grew up in Hong Kong-- I grew up eating dim sum in So Cal.  This place blew us away!  The first dumpling we ate was the chive dumpling and it was so flavorful and juicy  I couldn't believe it was so delicious.  The shu mai was one of the best I had and the baked char Sui bar was light and flavorful.  The Hong Kong style noodle was also amazing-- I would highly recommend it.  It wasn't greasy and there was no MSG residual after effects.  My dad declared this as better than any dim sum place in Northern CA (where he now lives) and even better than any in San Francisco and Hong Kong.  Also, I need to add that the service was attentive and impeccable (both times) which is a rarity in a Chinese restaurant.  My only feedback is the Xiao Lin Bao is not a specialty here, although the meatball is tasty and juicy, the dumpling is served on a little metal cup and has the tendency to stick.  I think if they served it in a bamboo steamer it might work well, but they way it is now it's not worth it to order.  Nonetheless, this place has amazing dim sum!",N1B-P3MVLmZT5yArrK2dYw,1,0,5,zpUyQ-ICKTUeK45ssTCghw

I would not spend my money there again! Go to ORCHID GARDEN",Y5gPkvSNH1SnU11ydMch6Q,0,0,1,9IdgPtceFexvPLToe65ndA
