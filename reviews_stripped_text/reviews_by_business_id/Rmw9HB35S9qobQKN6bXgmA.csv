Feb 25th 2017 I did an online order for their pizza dinner box which comes with a square pizza, after waiting almost 2 hrs for my food to be delivered I received a pizza that was so cold that the cheese was hard and to top it off they gave me a round pizza rather than the square pizza that I ordered. I also ordered a 2 liter of mt.dew that was warm like it had been sitting out. I called to complain about my order which was $25 and I received a credit of $18!?! How do I get penalized for your mess up?? Then I call today to  order my kids pizza once again and after ordering I'm told my wait will be 2 hours 30 mins really pizza hut!!!!!!",OpevAnvx6iYjU_D8NZlyPA,1,0,1,rYvFwnUefSCzZ7V_wZxKyA

I recall ordering a large pizza years ago and being able to satisfy a family of four with a bit more to spare. But now, it not only lacks in size, but in flavor, thickness, and toppings. The actual pizza was as thick as cardboard. The toppings were skimped out on and looked as if they were rationing. Please save your 15 to 20-or so dollars because the quality has dipped over the years and it is just atrocious.

TL;DR cardboard pizza, skimped toppings, small portions, very pricy. Eat elsewhere.",urtuSBu7xzQd_Nkhk3ySig,0,0,1,O0CS_tFQub6zAi4fp5RQ_w

Ordered  wings and a personal pan pizza. I get traditional bone ouy becaise i don't like nor can I eat yhe Breading.  My food came in about 45 mins, I open the door, he goes to pull out the food,  and the wings go crashing all over the ground. Sauce EVERYWHERE. So now im hungry and had to wait for them to be remade and delivered. I don't know if it was the fact that they were about to close or what, but when the driver returned the wings were half done, the skin was soggy and breading falling apart which was weird since  i ordered traditional wings.  Waited two hours basically and still went to bed hungry.  The only reason I'm giving the two stars is because my driver (although  clumsy) was the nicest  guy ever and was really apologetic about the situation,  I felt bad.",7btsXeA7PGFpuBs9-xxhyw,0,0,2,QpviKxAfgw8DSLiSMRj2zw
1862715,2017-03-19,0,Rmw9HB35S9qobQKN6bXgmA,My sister sent me to pick up a pizza on a Friday they told her 20 minutes I went and waited my pick up time was 715 my pizza was not ready until almost 8.  This was absolutely ridiculous. If you're going to run behind that is quite alright just let us know our food won't be ready for 45 minutes. The reason for the 2 stars is because the cust. Svc.  Lady at the front was super kind to everyone and she is probably the reason they have customers. One lady they lost her orde4 and she was on a time crunch couldn't get refunded unless she sent in a form requesting a refund.  Wow.  Will never return.,thxWw-_kf3dmeidPCIPcag,0,0,2,SfMIc02IJlkAwcwn7JegHQ

I called and complained and they literally told me that they can't do anything about it since it was already taken out of the store. It's a disgusting place.

I think Pizza Hut needs to reevaluate there workers because when your order is for well done at 8:23 it shouldn't be at the door at 8:45....

People that walked in after me got their pizzas. And I had ordered mine online. Not only was it late but it was wrong. One was the wrong size wrong crust. The other one that was right looks like they dumped an entire bottle of siracha on the crust. And to top it all off, they were both room temperature. I have never gone on Yelp to review something but this was such a horrible experience that I felt I had to warn everybody else. At all costs avoid this location!

5636169,2018-02-13,0,Rmw9HB35S9qobQKN6bXgmA,"Ordered delivery last night and the driver showed up without my breadsticks, the wrong soda and marinara ""sauce"" that was the consistency of water. He handed me a 2 liter of Pepsi when I ordered Diet and the ticket even said Diet. I asked if he had Diet in the car and he said ""no"". I then noticed my order of breadsticks was missing, which I paid for and asked if he was going to bring me my correct order back. He again said no and that he had noticed they were missing, but the people at the restaurant told him to just take the order. What?! He then proceeded to tell me ""if you have a problem call the store"" in a very rude tone.

Well I called, was on hold for 10 minutes and then someone picked up and when I said hello they hung up. I know someone was there because I could hear them breathing and background noise. I called back and same 10 minute hold with being hung up on again!!! I called a third time and this time after 11 minute hold I was able to speak with the assistant manager who was even more rude than the delivery driver. He had all sorts of excuses that they were busy and that's why it took me a half hour of holding on the phone. He didn't apologize for my hold time OR for my missing and incorrect food. I told him I just want a refund for my missing items because I don't want to wait another 45 minutes to eat breadsticks with marinara that is water. He told me he couldn't process any refund because I used a card. WHAT? He had all sorts of excuses about the system they use and how he doesn't know how to do it. I explained to him that he should ask someone else in the corporation to help him and as the consumer who did not get what they were charged for I am entitled to a refund. He offered me store credit, but there's no way I'm ordering from them again so this is not acceptable. He finally said he would leave a note for the store manager to call me tomorrow.

Well it's almost 8pm and the manager did not call me. I called many times throughout the day during business hours and no one answered the phone once. This location with horrible customer service has made it so I will never order from another Pizza Hut again.",rbD9V-J3l2IH8wyhskbhPA,0,0,1,O_3IH8gDp2iD-qfYm4S3pw
