93110,2014-09-18,0,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,I'm surprised to see that other diners enjoyed their shwarma as mine wasn't worth eating.  Chicken shwarma is a favorite of mine.  This was the first  time I've had it as dried out crumbs with very little flavor.  The salad on the plate lunch looked nice but tasting revealed that the dressing was very bland. Not the kind of meal I'd expect for $9.99. Baba Ganouj as a side cost an extra 50 cents and was well worth it....the best thing I tasted.,JUvNlveCBgTUTIMtYZCG8w,0,0,2,2aBNwFrCOjl3mQ82HBopjA

The tahini dressing was also really gross which is weird because tahini is delicious!? 
Also feta cheese was not included and was an additional $1 -_- which is pretty sheisty in my opinion. I think a $10 salad should include cheese. So they taxed extra for cheese and veggies that are normally included and gave me old ass chicken. Merp. For these reasons they get a bad review and hopefully they see this and stop serving people old crusty chicken. Someone could get sick

Not only is everything incredibly fresh, but the people are super kind and helpful, and the fact you can get your meal to go in a chipotle style system makes Parsley a great choice for any occasion.  

I come for lunch and there is always a great deal that I try to take advantage of, but can never stray away from the parsley fries... if you come you have to check them out.  The meals are priced great (usually under $10) and they have huge portions, so I am able to fill myself at lunch then have a snack for later.

Overall, I try to stick to the mediterranean diet (healthiest diet there is) so having Parsley around makes that goal so much more obtainable.  Whether its a salad, or kabob wrap, everything is so dang good you'll have to come back to try them all.

However, I didn't want to cause any issues so I just let them charge me for the wraps, fries and one drink at their regular price.

We ordered the chicken shwarma plates($9.49) after tasting a sample of both the chicken and the beef. The beef was most definitely dry dry dry. The chicken was only slightly better so my husband and I both ordered the chicken. It came with rice which was neither fluffy nor flavorful. The largest portion on the plate was the salad which was okay. I found it to be the most edible thing on the plate. The pita bread was your basic packaged pita. 

The chicken and the rice were so dry and bland that my husband and I left all but a couple of forkfuls and gave the rest to our dogs who were also indifferent. They ate it anyway but not with the same enthusiasm as for other leftovers. 

My son had the BBQ Beef Sandwich combo ($10) - the beef was flavorless but was ""saved by the BBQ sauce"" according to my son. And the bread was soggy. The fries were kind of mushy.  He said he wished we would have went to McDonald's. Me too I guess. It's cheaper anyway.

Both varieties of shwarma are good, the wheat wrap is way too dry, I don't recommend it. Get the regular. Other fillings are fresh and tasty. The falafel tasted way overcooked; based on my experience I can't recommend that either.

I was greeted by a friendly, smiling man; the one in the video.  It's a small, casual place but seemed very clean.   It's set up sort of like a Subway.  I wasn't familiar with some of the choices so they gave me a taste of a few different options and reassured me several times that what they served me had no animal products in it.  (I did notice that there were meat options available)
I opted for a Falafel bowl, which was 6 falafel patties on a bed of rice over fresh greens.  I chose sides of babaganoush, cucumber, tomato and a small bit of tabouli, all topped with a creamy tahini dressing.  It was a huge lunch, but it was a wonderful blend of fresh flavors.

1096190,2012-07-16,3,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"So after watching The Avengers I was a bit curious as to what Shawarma was, I did not understand Iron Man's craving for this magical ""Shawarma"" but I was intrigued and determined to find out. 

On a day out with my mom we could not decide what we wanted to eat, but I was starving for something different. She said we could eat Greek, something something chicken, at first I was hesitant, ""chicken"", it's not my favorite meat, but I was up for the challenge. As soon as we got to Parsley during this monsoon-like Las Vegas weather a huge raindrop landed in my eye, I guess it must have been good luck that I was visually impaired, it was indeed a sign from Zeus himself saying ""Feast on the nectar of the Gods my dear child."".

Luckily this place not only has Chicken Shawarma but also Beef Shawarma so I opted for the latter in wrap form with all the works and an added treat of those beautiful olives. The serving size was more than enough for me, I could only eat half my wrap, and beware these wraps can get messy.

This place is on an popping on those rainy days I might add with all sorts of people, it's kinda cool. The customer service is really great! Lots of friendly people. 

The layout if this place is pretty small. I'd say 30 people max? There is outdoor seating though.

For those who say ""Ehh, it's not the best Shawarma."" I wonder what really good quality Shawarma taste like because this is just fabulous.

First thing, as many might know, a Mediterranean place will 99% of the time serve Basmati Rice to go with the food. This place, no where close. Second, too much salad... Infact a lot of salad. Don't get me wrong, I love salad but if I am getting a shwarma plate, I want more of rice and chicken. This, the Mediterranean chicken is supposed to be marinated overnight in spices and the chicken I had here, well it was really blend.

1126420,2014-05-14,0,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"This is the closest thing to the Halal guys that I can find, even though it is actually VERY different. I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time but for some reason never bothered to try it.. but once I did, I was hooked!.. I've been back several (understatement) times. 

My all time favorite selection here is the steak shwarma bowl (which they also offer in wrap form or plate) with extra parsley and their green hot sauce: its basically a circular tin plate they fill with rice over a salad, and beef on top... and your choice of tzatziki or tahini (mmm tahini...). They cut the beef fresh in front of you & give you a decent amount of it. Normally, I'm not a fan of salads or rice, but the steak shwarma bowl is packed with flavor and far from bland. The portion size is also very decent considering the price.. it can be split between two people, but since I have two stomachs I tend to eat the entire thing myself :) 

I've also tried the curry chicken special they had. It came out piping hot and was also fullllll of flavor. Like the steak shwarma, it was delicious, but I didn't like that the rice was at the bottom of the bowl which was filled to the top with curry. I eat my curry with rice like most people, but I like eating the two together with mixing at my own discretion! I might try this again in the future if I happen to be craving it, but I think anyone one that comes to Parsley should try the steak or chicken shwarma before anything else!

The seasoned fries: they're really crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you like fries, you'll like these. I wouldn't order them again though, because I didn't think they were anything tooooo special. Nothing too different compared to normal fries.

One downside about this place is they charge you fifty cents for extremely small portions of ""sides"" .. sometimes I get the eggplant, but the little cup they give you is ridiculously tiny. . . 

Also: they are extremely busy during lunch time! This place is tiny so there isn't too much seating. It's very convenient though, if you're just ordering to go.",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,0,1,5,wrI-BbeK8iEQt7KPCr4lpQ

It is a small place with reasonable seating but the food taste amazing. You have a choice to make your meal as a bowl, plate, a wrap, or sandwich. 

I chose Chicken Shawarma Plate ($9.49) with Yellow Rice and Fresh Crisp Salad. The carved chicken has a slight hint of crispiness which taste yummy when you eat it with tzatziki. The yellow rice is fluffy and good. I selected every topping for the fresh crisp salad, it has romaine lettuce, dice cucumber, dice tomato, red onion, chickpeas, red cabbage slaw, parsley, crunchy slice carrots, and a mild green spicy sauce. Also I ordered the Chicken Curry ($3.99) which comes with soft tender chicken, green bell pepper, tomato, and the gravy taste creamy and flavorful. The eggplant ($1.00) is serve as a cold savory side and it has red bell pepper. I wish I had more of the delicious eggplant. And they offer Baklava ($1.99) for dessert. I had two different kind of Baklava: one with whole almonds and chocolate drizzle, and one with almond filling topped with almond slice. Both baklava have honey but the one with whole almonds and chocolate drizzle is a better choice, I like that it has a nice sweet and tasty crunch.

On the wall they have a canvas of rich, vivid imagery of spices and herbs. There are at least 5 to 6 tables and a side window seating. And when the weather is nice and sunny, you can enjoy your meal outdoor dining on one of their colorful rustic metal table. While dining in, they were playing upbeat music like Janet Jackson ""Escapade"" and it brings back fond memories of the 90's. The service is nice and the people are friendly. For a plate they give you a generous portion at a good price.

I really liked the food , bread ,fresh made from scratch hummus and bread .

Since I moved over here in the state I was locking for authentic food like that.

I am from Middle East and I can recommend that with close eyes .
They gave a small tiny modern. Kick to the traditional food without any compromise In taste 
Consider it as  chipotle for middle eastern food but very  authentic 

 I do recommend humus sharwerma bowl with some fried eggplant . I tried it wit tahini , I would say try it better with Greek zasiki. 

My wife had chicken shawarma and was great also

Para empezar soy Árabe y me gusta comer todo. Este lugar fantástico y muy original . El pan es fresco hecho adentro y tiene blanco y integral. A mi me gusta el segundo mas. Es mi fijo parece hasta una tortilla mexicana grande. Pero sabe diferente .

El humus es fresco hecho en casa y también la shawarma    ( el pincho redondo de pollo y carne ) 
La gente son amable y muy servicial . Hasta John el americano blanco habla español ( mi respeto John ) ere súper amable .

Usted puede compartir tal vez el plato mezclado con su pareja porque son generosos y servían  bastante .

The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there.",E3pXvQwKsPBQGQ7RkLrN3g,2,2,1,ArANouUhFayW_3v7OjBShQ

1673270,2014-04-30,3,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"Found this place through Groupon, stopped by to grab dinner. Had a few customer service issues redeeming my deal, mostly pertaining to the receipt- face value of my deal was for $18, yet I only received credit for $15.36 and somehow owed about $2. Employees were unable or unwilling to explain why the transaction happened this way.

In any case, the food was fairly tasty.
Beef tagine seems to be a frequent special, and it smells amazing. Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal.
The chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.

I wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another. I can say though, if you are craving beef tagine specifically, this place will probably hit the spot- flavors are correct, but hope it was just an off day for the meat.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,2,2,y63GNaXFuJJ-L7lz04wAzw

The piece we tried, they were good.  However, when he cut it for our plate, he cut from the bottom, which has a lot of fat, tough, and the chewy part in it.  Price wise, for a plate (come with a small scope of rice, meat, salad, sauce, spicy carrot and a pita bread is $9.49+ tax.  According to the menu, I ordered the beef shawarma bowl, it should be $8.xx, but he charges me the same price as the plate.

Food is great. They upped the prices a while ago and with the price increase there was a food decrease.. so now you pay more, get less. That's a bit annoying but the food still tastes great.

The service is slightly below average. They are inconsistent and they seem to like to cut corners to save money (even though you are paying for the food). For example, the salad is supposed to come with pita bread, but you always have to ask because they always ""forget"" to give it to you.... or are they just trying to save money even though your meal is supposed to include the pita bread? Also, they aren't completely friendly or helpful if you have questions when ordering.

They also have some delicious looking falafel and hummus plates. I've been really craving some Mediterranean food since Friday this is probably why I'm finally writing this review. Hmm tomorrow I want to stuff my face in some Parsley food. Yeap that sounds like an awesome plan. BTW Parsley is kind of small establishment, so you kind of have to leave when I arrive jk.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,8,8,4,lryj8mpbG6LwwLsV58uCtg

They have a lot of excellent healthy options like the hummus or chicken skewer plate, although the chicken is a tiny bit dry. And if you're really feeling riskaay you can treat yourself to a nice little check in baklava freebie huhuhu.

Their Groupon deal is also a huge steal, I always make sure I have it handy when I go in. Their portions are decently sized, but make sure you watch what extras you put on your plate because if you don't pick correctly you can get charged extra. Staff is always very nice whenever I stop by as well, I don't honk I've ever gone in once and had a rude person serve me.

Also if youre not on a diet and have to choose between the chicken or steak make sure to get the steak, it's a little extra but flavor is more seasoned and worth it if you aren't in the mood to watch weight.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,2,2,3,KCKsj1UJE23vmFYqy704ZQ

Appetizer size falafel - 6 pieces on top of hummus. Good serving size for the price. Both falafel and hummus a tad too salty. Ate with pita and it was more than satisfactory. 

Parsley Nachos with chicken - Big chunks of shredded chicken, feta cheese, tzatziki, and a sprinkle of tomato, cucumber, & cilantro. Seasoned fried pita chips were slightly too salty. Portion can be a meal or appetizer for 2-3 people. Overall pretty good; would order again.

Steak shawarma bowl - thinly sliced steak; good seasoning, but was dry and there were some chewy/grisly pieces. Steak was piled on yellow (saffron? couldn't tell) rice and salad. Also came with a side of tzatziki. This would be great if the meat was better. 

""Beef Kabob"" plate - was expecting cubes of beef, but when I opened the container I was like, ""oh, I guess it's more like kofta (formed ground meat)"". But then it wasn't like any kofta I've had :( the meat had a dry, more congealed texture like a sausage, as a matter of fact, my husband said, ""this kinda tastes like a hot dog"". Plate came with yellow rice, salad, and a side of tzatziki. Would not order again.

2 orders of baklava - this looked and tasted like the baklava a former boss of mine ordered from Sinbad Sweets to give as holiday gifts. Point is, did not look and taste like it was made in-house. 

Our order also came with 2 foil packets of pita (4 half pieces each). Not sure which items these were supposed to accompany. They came warm, which is a plus.",vBmh71e1szXipEBrS1R3RA,0,0,3,Eqmab342_Hew787BRXrGog

The reason for the low star rating is for the poor customer service. This was my first time eating here and honestly I don't know much about Mediterranean food. I told the guy behind the counter this and I asked for his recommendation. Instead of telling me some of their popular items, he began to read off the menu (which I don't understand why since I can read it myself). When it was time to pay, another older gentleman was working the register. I showed him my check in (since they had a Yelp check in offer for free baklava) and he asked me for my name to confirm my check in. After I told him, he said he didn't see it on his register. I even showed him my Yelp check in and he kept on saying he couldn't see it even though it was right there on my phone. After awhile he just seem annoyed at the entire situation, which left me feeling confused. He ended the conversation with an attitude like as if he was doing me a favor by giving me a baklava. As I was dining in, the same worker went around and chatted with all the customers (asking how their food was, removing trash/taking their tray). He went to all the table except mine. What's that all about?

Decent food. However, the customer service left something to be desired.",qlaVQkSxKcqfHJhoZU3rKg,3,0,2,WmFnryHnQxeEs6R31jy3bw

2640849,2014-04-14,2,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"I was led here by Emily R. who posted the most DELICIOUS looking photo of a wrap from Parsley, so I purchased the Groupon and off we went to Parsley. For our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 small children), we ordered a ton of food, but were able to finish it all, and without the Groupon, the total would have come out to about $40.

My husband ordered a large steak shwarma wrap combo on wheat (I love that it is an option), I got the chicken shwarma salad, the kids shared our food plus falafel, and two baklavas (squares, not cigars). When I went to pay, I was told that the combo is not valid with the Groupon. She told me she could charge for the side of fries separately, until I told her to charge the combo separately because the side of fries was $4.00 + change whereas the combo upgrade was $2 + change. She also charged me $.50 for olives on my salad, and $.50 for chickpeas even though the guy said it was free. Also $.50 for tzatziki sauce. They seriously nickel and dime you here. We got a soda cup which came with the combo, but their soda machine doesn't offer water... They do however, have a fridge full of bottled drinks that DOES include water... They also do not freely give out napkins, so you have to wait until someone is available if you want more than the 1 they gave you... It seems like very very cheap management happening in this establishment. 

The food was alright. The salad mix came pre-mixed and was very very wet. I like being able to control the amount of dressing on my salad, but overall, the flavors were very fresh and the chicken was alright. My husband's wrap was better than mine which was layered with hummus, their salad mix, and steak. He did not love it however. I enjoyed the couple of bites I took but didn't want the carb bomb that came with the 16"" tortilla. The falafel and hummus were tasty and a generous serving for the price. Lastly, when I ordered the baklava, the girl told me that the cigars have no nuts and only cinnamon. I was confused as to how that could be a baklava, but took her word on it because my son is allergic to peanuts and they were unable to answer ""Do these have peanuts?"" We were later told that they do have nuts in them, although uncertain as to what kind, plus the cinnamon. Whatever. We just got some. There was no honey on them which made the filo dry, but the nut mix inside was yummy. There is just SUCH better baklava other places in town (Manan Bakery!).

I bought a $16 voucher on groupon (paid $7.50 because of a coupon code) and ended up paying $2 out of pocket for a beef and chicken bowl. 

What's the difference between a bowl and a plate? The girl working told us that the plate separates everything while a bowl has salad first then rice, whatever veggies you put on and then the meat. 

The salad had a light vinegrette dressing on it, not sure what it was but it definitely wasn't heavy. The salad we got looked fresh and not all wilted. I asked the girl working what people can put in their bowls and she said pickled carrots, cabbage, and garbanzo beans. I love their picked carrots!! Ask for them on the side because you'll get more that way. We didn't, and they were so stingy with the carrots!! I was afraid they weren't going to give us a lot of meat because of the way she was cutting the meat but it turned out to be a good amount. They have two different sauces, one is a cucumber sauce and the other is a sesame sauce... Not sure what the names were but I got both sauces. My friend and I both liked the cucumber one more, the sesame one was kind of plain for us. But you can try both and see which one you like better. If you want hot sauce, just ask for it and they'll give it to you. 

Without the groupon the beef/ chicken plates or bowls would be $8.99. They have some vegetarian and vegan options too and good deals on Tuesdays.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,0,4,6KwuFGbHkTseZrpssyhK-Q

This place is located on Pecos Road not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park.

We had chicken wraps and falafel plates and they all tasted good. The price is also reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for most items and also expect to be filled after that.

It looks and feels like any fast food Mediterranean style place, which is to say that it was rather unimpressive. This is the sort of place you go for a quick pick up, or carry out while you sit at home and watch Netflix or a sports game.

Service was fair, no complaints there.
One big complaint I do have is that the restaurant offers NO LAMB. How can you call yourself a Mediterranean grill and have no lamb as an option? I was really craving a gyro or at least a lamb kabob and was unable to have one. They basically offer 4 options for adult eaters: Beef shawerma, Chicken Shawerma, Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob-- each available in wrap, sandwich, salad, or plate form. The plate is for a larger appetite, the wrap will suffice a medium appetite.
We tried the chicken shawerma salad and beef shawerma plate. They add a Tahini dressing that they keep in a plastic squeeze bottle, much like you would find at a Subway. It was tasty stuff but honestly it was yet another reminder of how authentic this place ISN'T. Real tahini is slathered onto things or served in a bowl because it should not have such a creamy, dressing like consistency. 

 I don't mean to sound so harsh because the food IS actually pretty tasty and I LIKED it a lot more than I like eating at most of the big corporate fastfood joints that I no longer support. The salad they serve has garbanzo beans and a tasty tangy dressing. 
Big compliments to the spicy paste. The green and red stuff ( the name of which escapes me) are both quite good options. The red really packs a punch so don't get it unless you're an adventurous spicy eater like myself. That alone makes this place worth coming to if you've got a craving for spicy and meaty.

They serve pickled carrots with the salad and the helping of shawerma is pretty generous. As I write this review, I admit to feeling quite stuffed. It's a fair value for what you pay but unless I was already out here in the area, (cough--Sunrise Coffee--cough) I can't honestly say I'd be craving them badly enough to drive out here.

With that said, Parsley isn't exclusively Greek, which I wrongfully assumed. They had items on their menu I didn't typically associate with Mediterranean food -- nachos, curries, and baguette sandwiches. So there you go: your culturally infused bits of Mexico, Thailand, and France just in case you were experiencing a food conflict and didn't know where to go.

You will find that bowls and plates cost the same. What's the difference? Bowls have everything mixed in, while plates keep everything separate. You will also discover that no lamb or goat is served here, their main meats are either beef or chicken, which roast vertically on a turning spit. I believe they have tuna options for all the pescatarians in the house, and of course, falafel is indeed served here for all the veggie-heads.

I originally wanted to get the chicken shiskabob plate, but she said it would take about 10 minutes to cook and offered the chicken shawarma instead. I took it, but it was the wrong decision -- the sliced pieces of meat were cold and on the dry side. It was nearing the end of the day, so that may be why... but still, no excuse. I'd say wait and get the kabob! Tzatziki sauce, too. 

My bf ordered the chicken curry served with rice. It reminded me of Thai yellow curry, but with an overpowering coconut flavor. Not really my style. I noticed that gyros aren't served here, but again, it's not a Greek place. Instead you'll find they have wraps and baguette options. Oh, try their cucumber chiller drink. It's light and refreshing.

Parsley has never skimped on their ingredients.

Portions are gigantic! Even with a large appetite (and I eat A LOT), I can only eat half of my wrap; the wraps will surely keep your appetite satiated for hours. It might be best to order your food to go even if you plan on dining at the restaurant, just so you have a container ready in case you can't finish all of your food in one sitting.

I couldn't finish the wrap after that. And it had been so delicious up to then! But how disgusting. I hope no one else has had this issue.

3814729,2012-08-11,0,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"My Recomendation: Steak Shwarma.

I've always been a fan of Mediterranean food, but I haven't been too impressed by a lot of the places I've been to out here. Fortunately, Parsley is a trend breaker!

The selection on the menu was pretty small, which is fine. It's not overwelming. And they make up for their small menu size with their heaping portion sizes. If you're able to finish one of their shwarmas in one sitting, you should try out for one of those professional eating contests because you definitely have some talent. 

The food itself was delicious! It kind of reminded me of a gyro, but better.The steak was nice and juicy, the vegetables seemed pretty fresh and they used just enough sauce and hummus. I've been to other mediterranean places where they drench it in so much sauce that my bread gets soggy before I get to finish my meal.

One complaint I have is how small the store is. There was no room to even stand in line without feeling like you're intruding someone's eating area. Maybe I just went on a busy day, but the place was packed. A bigger, more open store would fit them better. 

Customer service was great. Everyone was so polite and had a big, friendly smile the whole time. Even though I was asking some pretty dumb questions (like, what's a shwarma? What goes on it?) the guy I talked to was happy to answer with sincerity. He didn't make it seem like they were dumb questions at all.

I would definitely recommend this place to anybody!",sjYH9lpV6O7kjq515V0XQQ,4,1,4,ytb0EbGX5bMYzCoBCMuvxg

It was savory and hearty. There were so many flavors that just screamed Mediterranean, but not in an obnoxious, overpowering way.

Just ate here for the first time so the hubby and I opted for a variety of things so we could taste as much as possible. There aren't enough adjectives to describe how AMAZING this place is! 

They are beyond 5 stars and A+ for us! I may be back this weekend even though they are not close to anything for us. We just happened to need the extended hours post office up the street and decided to try it out. 

Oh, and btw I am a connoisseur of Mediterranean food, lol. The point being that I definitely know the difference between EXCELLENT and mediocre. 

We had a chicken shawarma plate with babaganoush and a steak plate with hummus. Both plates came piled as full as absolutely possible with food which included rice and salad.  I included two pics one showing the two plates about 5 minutes into eating (Duh, sorry) and one of the hubby's plate after he finished. I thought he might lick it clean before all was said and done. I, on the other hand, had enough left over to FILL a full sized to-go box. Seriously folks, BIG portions!

The service was quick and both of the people working were kind and helpful. I asked a lot of questions considering it was our first time there and the young lady who helped us was patient and descriptive with a great smile as an additional treat. She did not rush us or so much as hint to being annoyed by the many questions.

I couldn't help myself and had to order some baklava when I went up for the to-go box. Haven't tried it yet because we are too full. They have several varieties so of course I got an assortment. 

We were DELIGHTED to see that they have a loyalty program, especially since this just became my favorite restaurant and new hangout.

They cook the kababs and falafels after you place your order. Once they are about to get ready you get to choose a bowl,wrap, or plate option. I got the bowl and they piled it up with rice and salad and other accoutrements at my request. Try the pickled carrots for a kick (spicy! And so good!!). $1 extra for hummus. The bowl comes with either tahini or 
Tzatziki sauce but I got both. I love the tzatziki. 

The appetiser falafel option comes with hummus and 6 falafels. 

Check in on yelp for a baklava! 

I was visiting from LA for work and I was in the area for two days and we went to this place two days in a row, it is that good.

This place does NOT serve alcohol. But the drink they have on the counter (usually a cucumber mint lemonade but not overly sweetened) is really refreshing!

2 stars= for their even more flavorful steak.  I've had their steak shwarma salad and I was even more content with the outcome than I was with chicken.  But chicken is probably the best for your body!

3 stars = parsley.  Lots of parsley.  I never thought to add this stuff to my salad, but what a great combination they have made with their salad.  Lots of cucumber cubes too!  Their salads here are really fresh, and they hav 2 types of dressings to choose from.  Both are really tasty.

4 stars = check your Groupon NOW deals.  They are always on there offering great deals!

This place is great for a quick and healthy lunch.  Their helpings are fairly large so you will definitely be fulfilled!  If you're into Baklava, they have Chocolate Baklava.

I had their curry last time which was tasty but almost bland. It may have been because I got the last serving but hey it was served to me so that's what I'm judging. I'm a sucker for curries too.

I also had a chicken kabob plate. This was okay. It was kind if bland. Served with a pita, rice, and a salad. This was $8 I believe.

Most recently I got their chicken scwharma over hummus. This was advertised as a special which was lame because I assumed it would be a meal. It was a tin filled with hummus with chicken sliced into it with chickpeas. It had sauce over it and served with a thin very large pita type bread. This was good but more of a shared appetizer. Couldn't eat a large serving of this. The chicken was good with a nice smokey grilled taste to it. This was $8 I believe.

Overall I think the place is affordable for something unique and fresh. Their food is consistent. The place is clean.

I've found over the many times that I've been here since last review that, while they do offer pretty good food with some vaguely healthy ingredients, they don't have that something special to warrant my previous five star rating.

- The beef tagine hasn't lived up to the first time that I had it.
- While the falafel balls are still good, especially if you have it in a wrap and get a salad that (ironically) doesn't include chickpeas, I have definitely had better places.
- The meat options that I've tried are pretty decent but not great. Steak shawarma was a letdown. Beef kebab was pretty good but isn't really worth a ten minute additional wait (cook time).

I would call them somewhat of an Americanized take on the cuisine since they don't really have all the spices (or sweet/spicy sauces) that you find at great falafel / shawarma places. My friend actually had a beef BBQ baguette today, and I'm pretty sure the BBQ-esque flavor that I sampled doesn't belong in any sort of authentic restaurant of this sort. Still, with the prevalence of their salad mix and spicy carrots, they're a decent casual place for food that doesn't feel wholly unhealthy.

One more thing: you should know that they've been raising their prices and that they seem to do some strange things with entering Groupons at the register. Regarding prices, I'm pretty sure salads and large wraps were $8.49, baguettes were $7.49, and regular wraps were $6.49 today. Regarding Groupon, I'm guessing that the value is applied after tax or something, but others and I have found ourselves to be paying unusual (albeit small) amounts of cash when we didn't expect to owe anything.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,1,4,3XjO6m_Cm1VJI1-8BYxAlQ

I asked what else the woman suggested we try and she had a Beef Tagine on special.  Did not expect to her tagine from a small place like this, so I decided to order their special, which included an appetizer of my choosing, YES I chose the falafel.

Hubby and I were have a short break and needed a bite to eat, but not an entire meal.  This was perfect for us to share.  The beef was served over perfectly cooked rice.  There was a lot of flavor in the beef tagine and it was tender.  My one objection to this dish was that it was overly salted.  I have been avoiding adding salt to my food, so maybe I like things less salty, but even Hubby said he found it too salty, so I will go with it was overly salted.

The falafel on the other hand is some of THE best I have ever had.  It did not taste like the pre-made mix that so many other places use.  It really tasted freshly made, and if they are using a mix they are definitely adding fresh ingredients to it.  It was actually moist on the inside.  Crunchy on the outside and fresh and moist inside, they were delicious.  Their tahini dip was excellent too, not overly sesame flavored and a perfect balance to the falafel.

I'll be honest, the falafel was so good we are going back there today for lunch.  I'm thinking a falafel wrap is in order.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,0,0,4,QYAoaHcDm61e549_TN9IdQ

Such a healthy option to the burger and fries.  I absolutely love the Shwarma the way it slow roasts on the spit.  Mmmmm so good.  I don't eat a whole lot of red meat but the Steak and the Chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.  I usually get a Steak and Chicken Shwarma.  The tzatziki and hummus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off I like to get mine with a bit of the spicy green sauce.  BTW the Shwarmas are so big I usually get two meals out of it.  So the Shwarma is a treat for me I usually opt for Salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meat it fills me up, the dressing here is REALY good.  I've also had the Tagine a slow cooked stew, basically the meat falls apart in your mouth it's so tender.  The Falafel here ranks in the top 3 that I have ever had.  You can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.

The seasoning here on everything is perfect, the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.  This is a local guy living his dream, which I will continue to support the little guy in a big buiness world.  By the way they also have a punch card where you get a certain amount you get the next one free be sure to ask for it at the register.

The menu at Parsley is simple- bowl, plate or salad then choose your meat. They also have an appetizer and specialty menu- the curry and nachos are good! Always choose steak, always choose Tzatziki. 
My only complaint is that when we ordered chicken curry they offered us half chicken and half  steak so that we could ""try both curries."" We expected the two curries to be put on opposite sides, but instead they put the curries on top of eachother....... like, directly on top of eachother. So if you do get ask for half and half, make sure you specify that you want them separated haha. I'm still confused. 
The curries are spicy, ask for a sample before you commit!

Today I was trying to think of a good spot to grab food since I was on my own for dinner. Parsley came to mind since it was on the way home and would be healthier than many other options.

The shop features large boards above the ordering area outlining the various food options. I did have to ask what was included in a beef kabob bowl versus a beef kabob plate (they are the same). I decided on a Beef Kabob bowl, Hummus, and Baklava. At this time I was also warned that the kabob would be a 10 minute wait. It wasn't a big deal since I was told ahead of time. Next visit I'll probably call in my order now that I know the lead time. 

The Beef Kabob plate was really good. The beef kabob was tender and full of delicious seasoning. There was also a lot of meat included. The salad was fresh and had a really refreshing, light dressing on it. The rice was simple, but delicious. It worked really well mixed in with the salad. The tzatziki dressing on top was tasty and didn't drown the other flavors. The bowl came together like a Mediterranean version of a Chipotle bowl. The hummus was creamy and delicious with soft pita on the side. The baklava was pretty good too. All of the food I enjoyed tasted fresh.

The food was inexpensive. My bowl was around $9 and had plenty of food for a satisfying meal. The side and dessert were inexpensive as well.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,3,2,4,FNHK24IiTCrkMgBI5hzNMA

Upon arrival, we mentioned we were newbies, and were immediately provided with lots of samples: chicken and steak schwarma, chicken curry, and beef tagine.  Eric, who planned on schwarma before we even got there, changed his tune and ordered a small chicken curry plus a side of pita (50 cents).  It was tasty, but I am not sure exactly what kind of curry it was.  It was creamy and enhanced with turmeric.

On a side note, my mother-in-law and I have a joke about naming children after spices.  Eric has a cousin with the middle name Sage, which his mom doesn't like.  I told her to honor my husband I can name my child Turmeric.

Anyway, back to the food.  I love bowls.  No, that does not mean I went to Taco Bell to try a cantina bowl or KFC for a potato fried chicken corn and cheese biscuit bowl...no no no.  I like rice bowls though - Chipotle burrito bowls, sushi rice with fish on top bowls/chirashi, rice topped with anything in general is just very appealing to me.  Parsley has bowls!  I got the steak schwarma bowl - Israeli salad on the bottom, yellow rice, steak schwarma, tahini sauce.  I asked for the 3 hot sauces on the side (green is mild but yummy and chimichurri -like) and the 2 red sauces are hot.  I am not sure which was supposed to be hotter - one was too weird tasting for me, but the deep red oily one was really good and I spread it on the top of my bowl.  It was huge.  Though the curry comes in 2 sizes, the bowl is only one and I had to have Eric R. finish it.

There are many good things on the menu to try, including baguette sandwiches!  They also have kabobs.  Fresh, relatively healthy food, and fast!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,7,5,4,_HjG-CHz0zfUMWNpglvEFA

Environment: it seems like a lot of people from local businesses come here to grab a quick lunch. It's a pretty small store and is exactly what it is, a small clean and fair priced restaurant. It is similar to a cafeteria in the way that you wait in line and select your options, so not really a spot to eat and have long conversations. 

Service: the staff were friendly and had the line moving pretty quick. They are a little bit rushed since the line is usually consistent, but I didn't mind it since I was rushed on time as well.

Food: the food is good, I say you have the option of eating healthy or having a heavier meal here which is nice. I have had the chicken and steak plate before with the rice, it is really good and doesn't feel super heavy but you do get full. I enjoy salads more for lunch, and I think their chicken and beef go well with it. Their beef and chicken are cooked on a doner, those large revolving heated flame stick, so it has a little bit of a burnt taste to it which I kind of liked. They also have many other Mediterranean options like pita bread, hummus and tzatziki sauce.

All in all, great location for Mediterranean food. It's quick and you don't feel too heavy or tired when you head back to work.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,0,0,4,jD-rxQDh0zMYLeKAXjBV4w

I think I have a new favorite lunch spot. We'll see how long it takes for me to get tired of it. As it stands, I went for lunch yesterday and I returned today. It's that delicious.

Yesterday, I was looking for something somewhat healthy and found Parsley through Yelp. I got a beef shawarma salad to go and I ate it at the parking lot along Sunset where people watch planes take off and land (or do other activities not related to aviation). I don't think I even saw a single plane because I was too busy enjoying my salad.

Today, I went back to try chicken instead, but once I saw what the guy ahead of me ordered, I basically told the lady, ""I want that."" That being a gigantic half chicken, half beef shawarma wrap. For a slightly lower price, it seems like you get more food. What I like about the wrap is how it reminds me of the Doner Kebab--something we don't really have in Las Vegas.

For messy hands sake, I'll probably stick with the salad. In any case, I feel like you just can't go wrong with Parsley Mediterranean Grill.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,6,5,JO92OC1uW4XZnIcSqDdubQ

While that probably says a lot right there, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anywhere near where I like my Mediterranean fare to be. There was nothing special or memorable to it, and it was sort of overall quite bland. Possibly because it's not Persian or Greek or Moroccan, but some sort of Americanized, averaged version of all the widely varied cuisines that get lumped into ""Mediterranean"". It's a sort of ""health-food-ified"" Frankenstein that has all the right parts of delicious Mediterranean food, but they just aren't working quiiiiite right.

Food alone would give it 3 stars, though. I never feel oogy after eating it, and it is what it advertises.

What knocks it down to two, is the fact that every time I come in, I'm treated very rudely. One of my co-workers with a stamp loyalty card who was buying another co-worker who forgot his wallet in his desk lunch tried to get two stamps, and was actually yelled at.

I came here after hearing so much about it from a couple of friends and I was in the mood for Mediterranean, so I decided to come check them out.

It was such a hassle trying to find the place. I even walked in to a different restaurant, thanks Google maps fail! Haha. But after finding the restaurant I decided to go right in.

I ordered the Chicken Curry and a side of hummus and pita chips.

Chicken Curry  - 4/5

The flavor was ok. I wasn't a big fan of it, but I wasn't unimpressed either. The flavor, although ok, felt like it was lacking something... that extra oomph that would make me want to come back and try something else on their menu. On the bright side, the Asian in Mr enjoyed the saffron rice more than the main entree itself, so I'll give them that. Rice was fluffy and not soggy. The rice was the saving grace of this dish.

Hummus and Pita Chips - 4/5

No matter where I go and try different forms of hummus, I will always be critical because I have been spoiled by a fellow coworker and friend's hummus. Yes I understand that Tahini is part of the ingredient but I am very partial to garbanzo beans. I want to taste the garbanzo and tahini working together, not just straight out tahini. And yes I am an avid salt user but the pita chips had to give me pause as it was a little bit too much salt for me.

If the craving for Mediterranean hits me again, this will not be the first thing that pops in to my mind. But if I'm in the area doing errands, I will definitely give them a try again.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,0,4,1xjsT1eNEdmybcJOlLc7eQ

1. Parsley nachos $6
2. Chicken shwarma plate $9
3. Hummus $4

- The cashier was a bit fussy with the groupon. ""I don't think you can use the groupon on the same day."" She asked one of the other employees, and she said that you can bc it says that it's valid. Boo-ya! 
- Groupon SCAM! Check the receipt. Although, I'm not going to fight for 64cents. (-$7.36 wtf) Whatever...
- She forced me to order more than $16 worth saying that its still under $16 before tax. I used Groupon many times, staying under the coupon value. This is a first. 
- 2nd class citizen service. Groupon haters. haha. Oh well...
- On to what really matters, the food was amazingly good for the price!
- Very fresh vegetables! Although next time, no fresh onions with the nachos! 
- Reminds me of a Mediterranean style Chipotle!
- Hummus was great. I loved the olives and it comes with extra pita bread.
- Some of the pita breads were hard to open and when I did, it ripped. xD
- Although the pita chips appeared burnt, they were really tasty and good. 
- The steak was very flavorful. The chicken, however, was somewhat dry. The hummus sauce did the trick!

-The steak swarma is packed with flavor and is cut to a very generous portion.

-The salad is a mix of dark greens, chickpeas, tomatoes, purple cabbage, cucumbers and pickled carrot sticks.

The bad:
-The falafels and salad are heavy on the oil. The fried chickpea patties tend to absorb too much of the frying oil. The taste was magnificent though. I like that they serve it with hummus for dipping. The salad needed more acid instead of base.
-Peanuts are used in the baklava and overpowers the walnuts. Instead of pistachios, Parsley uses peanuts and that is all you can taste. Honey is not a big component of the dessert and it comes out kind of dry. It just reminds me of the peanut toffees you get at the Asian markets.

5390440,2016-04-14,3,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"Parsley has found itself as one of my regular visits for lunch lately.  I hate how everyone, including myself refers to a restaurant as ""Chipotle style"" but yes, essentially it's like Chipotle with Greek food.   You pick a wrap, salad, bowl, etc, a protein (chicken, beef, falafel) then a bunch of fixins.

I generally am the type who tries new things every other visit, even if I find something I like.  At Parsley I've pretty much stuck to the exact same order each time I've frequented:   Red Quinoa salad with added chicken (costs extra), and then I add the spicy carrots, some of the green sauce (everyone's got a green sauce nowadays), and some tahini.   The salad mix that you start with is fairly standard with lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, tomato with some garbanzo beans mixed in.   The vinaigrette as I've seen others state is mild, but tasty.   If you know nothing about red quinoa then we're in the same boat, and there's a list of health benefits that Parsley advertises that I can neither confirm nor deny, but I mean it's quinoa, so I can't imagine there's any sort of deception there right?  To be honest it doesn't add much more flavor than one would expect some scoops of quinoa would add to a salad, which is why the carnivore in me always has to add chicken as well.   I would prefer to do the chicken Kabob style vs Shawarma  style but it does take quite a bit longer for them to cook the kabobs vs just cutting it right off the giant spinning hunk of meat, so time wins that battle.   Side note:  the amount of different spellings of shawarma within the photos and reviews of this place are hysterical.   It's 2016 people, no excuse.  Anyhow, all of these components combine to form an extremely delicious salad, and there are enough options to satisfy anyone I would think [tzatziki instead of tahini, feta/olives/hummus options, fiery red sauce (BEWARE) over milder green sauce (which also packs a kick), etc] 

The only downsides for me are sometimes the service seems a bit rushed.   It's always friendly, but I feel that sometimes my salad ends up with the person at the end of the assembly line before I can finish with the additions I wanted from the first person.   They get busy and want to stress the quickness factor which I understand.   Also I have a few times ordered a double order of chicken, and what I've received has been inconsistent.   Sometimes it's a giant heap of chicken, and other times it doesn't seem much different from the single.   Lastly some of the extras that you can add include an upcharge that I wish didn't.  Feta and olives to be exact.  It's especially frustrating for me because I really only want a tiny bit of each but don't want to pay the extra charge for the large amount they give you.  I realize it's a slippery slope for them though.   Minor grievances to what has always ended up being a fantastic meal.

One pro tip before I go:  if you want to indulge in either of the sauces, ask for them to give it in a separate container instead of having them put it directly in the bowl.   Much easier to distribute according to your own tastes that way.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,2,4,aHeRKLn7UMxsfwLYJVFeoA

When they ask you if you want olives, feta, etc. in your wrap or bowl they never mention that it costs extra! This should be stated and not used as a surprise up sell tactic to ambush your patrons with.

They should rename this place ""The Mediterranean Chipotle."" You pick your meat, then whether you want it in a bowl, salad, plate, and then there's Kabob versions of each of those too. 6 options. That's more options than at most brothels! .. So I've heard..

The good: The fries are pretty damn good. Better than most Greek places, but I'm still used to krinkle cut fries at Greek places in the Midwest. The chicken kabob was a normal kabob. Nothing amazing, but nothing boring. Just on par with most other places. The cauliflower thingy(see pic) was good, but not as good as the photo looks.

The bad: Honestly, this place is super unorganized, hence missing a star, and getting 4 in this review. My first time here, and everyone is shouting over everyone else. I couldn't hear the lady or understand her over her thick accent. After asking, ""Huh?""

5819748,2014-04-20,0,eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw,"So I've been here two other times before and loved it. This time, however, was a different story all together. Maybe it was because my husband and I finally decided to buy the groupon that has been on there for weeks, but either way, our experience was less than desirable.
The staff said hello pleasantly enough when we came in, but then the guy taking our order started to have a bad attitude and not listen. My husband knew exactly what he wanted, what type of meat on his wrap, etc., and ordered it that way. The guy then (nearly screaming, mind you) asked him at least three more times while making the wrap if he wanted chicken or steak. We had our kids and their friend with us also (maybe the larger group caused the bad attitude?  Not sure) and the guy did the same thing to my son a few times, as well. We got combos on the meals (majority of them) and when we got to check out, my husband presented the groupon. The girl then told us with the groupon we couldn't get the combos. We were a little confused as to why we couldn't get fries and a drink and had to ask her several times before she managed to properly explain that the combo was a 'special deal' and we could only do one deal per transaction. We told her that's fine then and to ring the fries and drinks up separately. We still wanted those regardless of price. It took quite a while to get the fries, which was fine as we ate our actual food until then, but the steak shawarma itself was actually not that great this time. It was dry and kind of crusty, and I myself had a terrible stomach ache the rest of the night like I was going to be sick.
The worst part was they kept belittling another employee in there in front of us and ignoring him by speaking Spanish to each other and kept telling him to get in the back. In Spanish they'd say they didn't want him up front with them and to send him in the back.
Honestly this visit really upset me because the other times I absolutely loved this place but I don't feel like I'd go back now due to this experience.

The place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time.
I'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous.",1lK5wLkqXwui7GhhDAC6QA,0,0,2,v4PIg6NwvgWSYdiAirJYCA

This tiny restaurant on Pecos, in a massive parking lot has a variety to satisfy the taste buds.  I guess you either like it or you don't.  The kebobs are not sitting out, but in it's own refrigerated section.  The skewer is a decent size and I would consider it a generous portion for the price point.  

I'm totally into their chicken curry here.  It's a bowl of coconut milk, spiciness with thin strips of chicken and all the fresh parsley my bowl can hold.  The basmati rice is so fluffy, I'm glad it's all soaked in my curry sauce to make it that much more satisfying.  My husband really enjoys their chicken shawarma bowl, with some free added ingredients and some for an up charge. 

Their nachos are made with fried pita bread and their seasoning for their chicken is totally on point with me.  I really enjoy their tzatziki sauce, so I don't mind throwing that into the mix of it all.  They have their own version of hot sauce, a bit too spicy for me, but a little would go a long way.  

Prices are fair, but the running Groupon deal makes it that much more sweeter to try a new place.  The workers were nice, super patient and it made our visit quite pleasant on both occasions. It's a little of a trek for us, but definitely a must return restaurant for us to keep in our rotation.  They are part of the Perka app, so check-in for free appetizer and future rewards as stated on the receipt.  Enjoy!",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,2,2,4,uqChnq8Ws4zTUf_224ZrDQ

I have went to Parsley for two years now and the shwarma wrap is great, either beef or chicken.  The curry is not bad bad.",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,0,4,cIMyGIPsiH8YKkcQORNSJQ

I ate everything so I can tell you it wasn't gross and I'm sure if I went in there again it might be different because everything appears to be fresh. The sauce and humus were bland and the chicken was cold and dry, and everything was covered in way too much oil... I would definitely buy the spicy carrots by the gallon though!  Best of luck to the owners and please take this as constructive criticism but I will not be a returning customer",FaefpQPKE6dsyx2dt802SA,2,0,3,d3s9xp8orrYToc0UTPezFQ

I've tried quite a few of their items and everything has been delicious, but one of the main reasons I decided to update and upgrade my review of Parsley is their version of nachos. 

My mom was the genius who ordered them and they are beyond amazing. Pita chips instead of chips, with tzaziki sauce, feta, tomatoes, cucumbers and parsley. I'm so glad my mom was generous enough to share! For less than $6 this dish is an absolute steal and there was plenty for two people to share as a meal. I think I was addicted after the first bite, it's that good. The rest of their menu is yummy and healthy as well and I've never had a bad meal here. I only wish they were closer for me to go more often.

Not to mention customer service is always outstanding. They are so friendly and accommodating here!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,7,5,BpP0oTcQ2zZ84SBmvYEFUw
