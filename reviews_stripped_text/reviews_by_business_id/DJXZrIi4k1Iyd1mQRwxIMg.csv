25578,2015-07-10,0,DJXZrIi4k1Iyd1mQRwxIMg,"Nasty!!!  The lamb/beef ""gyro"" from Gyro Time belonged in the garbage not on my plate.  The first time we received our gyros, the meat was cold.  We sent them back.  The replacements were warm, but the meat tasted rancid.  The ""tzaziki"" sauce did not resemble sauce so much as congealed glop.  The tomatoes and onion on the gyro looked tired.  The pita bread was thick and soggy.  Overall, a very disappointing and costly experience.  On the upside, the fries were tasty.",Jb6CODCkn58oBBLTghISuA,1,0,1,oP9T9JknJoZUgRZcYGCxkA
41057,2011-08-07,3,DJXZrIi4k1Iyd1mQRwxIMg,"If only it were possible to give zero stars..... Ugh......A zero is too generous. This place is really deserving of a negative number! So easily the worst gyro I have ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever had! It was actually some of the worst food that I have tasted period!!! That says a lot because I have had some REALLY BAD GRUB from all corners of the earth!

The place was clean and the service was very friendly...... but the food? NASTAY!!!!!!! I had the gyro combo with a side of grilled zucchini and my friend had the felafel combo with fries. My meat was extremely dry and it didn't even come how the menu described it. The zucchini was obviously frozen and placed on the grill before defrosting. It was unseasoned and had the consistency of an uncooked piece of eel. Super tasteless and slimy! My friend's felafel was more like ""feel awful""! It was extremely dry and tasteless as well. We also had what I guess was supposed to be hummus and tzatziki? EEEKKK! I have tasted soiled paper towels with more flavor and better mouth feel! Needless to say neither of us finished our food despite the fact that we were both extremely hungry prior to recieving our orders.

It is really sad when the best thing at a ""Greek"" joint is the ketchup packet. The fact that they offered a ""Barbecued Gyro"" dressed with barbecue sauce and American cheese should have been our que to exit. 

If you are in the area, and you are dying of hunger......just go ahead and die! This place is the best endorsement for anorexia and bulimia that I have run across in a looooonnnnngggggg time! 

If Zeus were real, he'd send a lightening bolt to this joint tout suite!",wzxU0tbrO9KoWetsFkZeGw,0,0,1,tG-xvLyPZ73F-2QKuyEekA
62420,2010-10-29,0,DJXZrIi4k1Iyd1mQRwxIMg,"I used to go to this location often.  I would order the Junior gyro and a side of gyro meat that I would take home and have with a salad and my doggies!  The staff was always young but friendly and nice.

Today I went and ordered my regular.  I immediatly noticed that it was about $3 more than in the past.  I balked and the black girl behind the counter said that they had raised all their prices apologetically.  I commented that the side of meat must be a huge portion for that price.
The food came and it was LESS meat than I have ever received before.  The side of meat was pretty much the same as the Gyro.  The girl apologised and offered to make me some more.  I said that would be fine.  A minute later this young white girl came over to ask what the problem was.  She said that was the amount of meat that was served and I could get a refund if I wanted.  I told her I used to come here a lot and the portion had gone down but the price went up.  Her response was that she had worked there for 7 years and it was always the same amount.  I again commented that I am a regular ( never seen her before) and that this is not what I usually got.  She told me she is the general manager of several locations and quoted what she probably learned in fast food supervisor training in a tone of voice that you get out of an exasperated teenager that thinks they know best.
At this point out of principle I said I would take the refund.  I hope they did not reuse the meat!

Even though their food is decent it is now priced on par with a restaurant.  If I wanted snotty teenaged managers I would just go to McDonalds.  You will have a better experience with Paymons or Stephanos where they have a great atmosphere and booze.
Just read the other reviews and I will add that it is usually fairly clean and with the exception of the ""manager"" the staff has usually been pretty cool.",9imSnJsjKTSTMlyMZ3EYYg,1,0,2,eD3V5X4scHOVAGsE1FKxpg

The staff / service is fine, but we come for the meat & the sauce which tastes so yummy! The fries are good too! We will keep coming back ! Sure wish they were open on Sundays for after church lunch, and wish they had a location closer to Henderson / Green Valley! Also they close at 8pm so that eliminates any late night gyro run !

Now that we will NEVER be returning, I'll go ahead and share. So about two months we went to get a gyro and a falafel, we said, on the gyro, no tomatoes or onions. We get home, and there's onions on the gyro. We called, they gave us credit. Two weeks later we decide to use our credit and get again, the same thing, a falafel and a gyro. We get home, no hummus. Which the falafel comes with. We go back, ""hey do you guys messed up again only on a different item."" The blonde girl with the side ponytail said ""okay we'll write your name down for next time"". So today we go to get two chicken salads, come home after a long day, excited to eat. MY SALAD HAS A HAIR AT THE BOTTOM OF IT. We then called and the blonde girl answers and says ""well if you're not going to show me the hair in the salad I can't do anything about it"" we said well ""you've done it before cause you guys have messed up TWICE BEFORE"" and she says ""well there's new rules so..."" So my boyfriend says ""can I speak to the manager?"" And she says with the smartest tone ""I am the manager!"" We were appalled that a ""manager was talking to us with that kind of attitude."" My boyfriend said ""well how come the guy who was there had ""manager"" on his name tag?"" And she goes ""he's another manager."" 
We were so fed up and just told her to have a good day. Instead of her saying ""I'm really sorry about what happened today. I hope you guys do come back to our establishment."" She says ""thanks! You too!!""

$9.67 for a gyro and a drink. I guess its a reasonable price being that the gyro was stuffed with lots of meat. The gyro was flavorful but it was missing something for me which was the lettuce.

They're those fries that aren't shoestring but aren't steak fries - the perfect thickness on fries without a doubt.  
The gyros are the star of the show here - lamb, tomatoes, onions all in a soft, warm pita and that freaking marvelous tzatziki sauce.  The hubs spices his up with some hot sauce but I like mine as is.

We usually get a piece of baklava to go and that satisfies our sweet tooth and then some.  Layer after layer of sweet, sticky, flaky goodness that's just too delicious to pass up.  Suggestion: take it home and nuke it for about 15 seconds.  You're welcome.  
The place is always clean, never super crowded and the employees there are so wonderful.  Very personable, cool, easy to talk to and always treat us like friends coming over for dinner, not just random customers.
My only complaint is that they close kind of on the early side (I think 8pm) and they're not open on Sundays.  But at the same time, I can appreciate that they're closed on Sundays to allow employees a day of rest.  Right on.  
If you're looking for low key, honest to goodness delicious food - gyros, fries, pita sandwiches, baklava (I could go on and on but you get the point), this place is for you!",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,5,ClQQKcybX2Wepfq0K3eFyg

I came lunchtime and it got pretty busy around 1:30. This review is more of a 3.5 out of 5 but not quite a 4.
We ordered the gyro time gyro (beef and lamb), the grilled chicken gyro, fries plus feta and one drink. They don't have combos, everything is ordered individually and it cost around $20. A little pricey but that's okay.
Everything was fresh and had good sized portions. The fries were pretty large, you could definitely share them. Now onto the flavor. I don't want to say bland because it Did have good flavor but it needed a little ""umpf "". Maybe they did that to appeal to a larger group of tastebuds.I feel like it would have been better if they put feta inside the gyros, maybe I'll try that next time. Each of the gyros came with a pretty big side of tzaziki sauce however, there was No tang to it at all. Very creamy and good texture but again I wish it had more ""umpf "". Meat was tender but not softest I've had and the onions they put with the beef/lamb gyro were very sharp tasting, had to take a few out.
Overall, if I was in the area and craving a gyro or craving something healthier than a burger I would definitely come here. It was good, and hit the spot, just not the best.",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,0,0,3,skaDCqJHpcA6u-d8VY6W7w

5500339,2010-08-17,0,DJXZrIi4k1Iyd1mQRwxIMg,"Wow the other reviews are pretty harsh.  We saw it when we drove by and decided to go in.

Pros:
 Super clean, really friendly young man at the counter.  Really big portions.  So big, the three of us couldn't finish one order of fries after eating our sandwiches.

Which brings me to the next PRO.  They have a Junior Gyro.  That was perfect for my 8 year old! And he is a gyro maniac.   $10 for lunch for good quality food is ok in my book.  The junior gyro is $4, and they got an extra star just for that. I hate having to pay adult price for an adult size meal.  My son loves to eat good healthy food, and after a 90 minute session at Sky Zone (look it up), he KILLED that gyro. 

Cons.  The tzaziki was a little on the thick side, and more sour creamy than yogurty.  It could have DEFINITELY used some garlic, dill, and yogurt.   The gyro didn't have any cucumbers in it, but it was full of tomatoes and onions.  I suppose if I had known, I would have simply asked for some.

The location is clean but had a funky smell that dissipated the longer we were in the restaurant. The service was fast and friendly. The gyro had a lot of meat in it (always a plus in my book!) but it lacked any real flavor. The tzatziki was bland and, I believe, did not contain cucumbers. I had a small sliver of a tomato or two in my gyro - overall, the friendly service couldn't make up for the flavor lacking in this gyro.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,0,0,2,Oi-kXbAKF19GPbv281oQVg

a little pricy sometimes I'm  surprised at my total after I order a gyro and salad. 
I tried the falafel in my salad instead of the gyro meat. The falafel they make is wonderful but not worth the price added to the salad. 3.00 to add three falafel nuggets to the salad.? damn.

Its not made of gold.
