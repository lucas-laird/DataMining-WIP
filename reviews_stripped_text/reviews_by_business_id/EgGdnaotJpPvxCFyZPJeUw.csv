Unlike many places in Las Vegas the General manager, Mike is very friendly and will do whatever it takes to please his customers. I have never had a serious issue and my pizza has reliably arrived on average about 45 minutes after placing an order.",dnp-e7SBVygsGo0TQXGTWQ,0,0,5,Fceacova_OZ8bst7-y6hrw

I gave that driver a five dollar tip on top of my $37.00 order. I'll find a new spot. My 7 year old nephew says Thanks",xo5Qxcq-8Xi9m9NmehXBlw,0,0,1,MRphddu_VNqinWd9bmhH0w

I complained about my pizza having almost nothing on it to the manager - Lisa. I cannot believe someone this rude and disrespectful works in customer service, let alone IS THE MANAGER!!",RFPdmk3HH4H1klNSPMTERA,2,1,1,yI_vdybEQpT1whgR_BoAfw

Today I called because it never arrived, they lack in customer service, but expected from kids running the place, definitely a reflection of the lack of leadership, disappointed, it's just pizza, and they can't get it right. Now I wait for my refund..",4TwU4F_o58PzsoXScUZFNw,3,0,1,A4PRVOqzYYB-AYCsvlY_lw
1573233,2017-10-17,0,EgGdnaotJpPvxCFyZPJeUw,"Ordered a pizza $13 from this location , to be delivered to me.  For some reason they siezed all the funds I had left in my account, pending and holding $120 instead of $13! Although they didn't charge me the extra $107 . It was left pending for 24hrs. I couldn't use any $ they were holding from my account and had to wait 24hrs for the transaction to process and $ to return.  They were no help at explaining why this happened and refused to help me.  This hassle was not worth a pizza! How does $13 go to $120!!!!  Will not be ordering from this branch again!",kXazJS1YYOEv5sF_Zl9qZg,0,0,1,FUXgC6FmAg_T0AX3QV6dgw
1909225,2014-01-03,0,EgGdnaotJpPvxCFyZPJeUw,"I have ordered from this pizza hut four separate times in the past year, and they have always given me good quality food and I have never had a problem, until now. I did an  online order for two large three topping pizzas, than added breadsticks and soda for an additional 5 bucks. 
While there delivery was fast, the size of the pizza's I received was shocking. They gave me two mediums instead of larges, and when I called them to replace the mediums they said that they definitely gave me two larges. 
I used to work at a pizza place and this is not a large. Well, I went and measured the pizzas while I was waiting for the larges and my measuring tape said 12"". I went to pizza hut's website where it says that there mediums are in fact 12"".
Well, when they brought the new ones they were the exact same size. The delivery guy (who was very nice) told me that the manager said that this was their large, I told them this in fact was 12"" when I measured it and he said that a 12"" is a large....ugh...well, on the bright side they told me to keep the first two pizza's so we now have four mediums, so that's cool! lol. 

Just be careful what you order from here, usually they are good, but this whole experienced kinda does not make me want to come back. Also, I am never that person who complains, I am actually an easy laid back person, but when I spend 30 bucks I expect more then just  mediums.",v281gE-nk3jozr_5hWFAug,1,0,2,APqBPI0j2H-SHRxSka0t5g
1978917,2014-07-18,1,EgGdnaotJpPvxCFyZPJeUw,Absolutely terrible! Worse service ever! Kept me on hold forever! Finally gave up and ordered on line. Food showed up cold and burnt! Don't recommend! Don't waste your money! Go someplace else...,rdnKq2tDYQ5iVG3DPW7y2Q,2,0,1,1lkoVJTO1q6ebf_G9_6Bcw
2525103,2017-07-19,0,EgGdnaotJpPvxCFyZPJeUw,"On July 8th we ordered a large pan pizza with bar-b-q wings, we frequently order from this location and we normally get great service and fast delivery. 

But this time, the pizza crust was RAW! It tasted like it needed a few more minutes and it would have been decent.  

I called back and spoke to the manager on duty whose name is Kyle, explained the pizza dough was still raw and he asked if I would like a replacement pizza or a refund, the replacement would take between 30 - 40 minutes, I'm said we will take a refund and thanked him. 

Well it's been 10 days and still no refund, I called back and got the manager on duty who copped an attitude and said they don't refund money but will put a credit on my account, I said that was not explained to me when I spoke to Kyle. She was extremely rude and said well if you don't like that you could speak to the owner or the district manager, I said ok what's his name? She says Eddie, I say what's his last name? She slams the phone down and yells to the other employees, what's Eddies last name? And then comes back to the phone and gives it to me. I say can you spell that for me? Then she goes on to say why am I upset over pizza?? I said cause that's not what I was told!  I wrote an email and also called the corporate office, hopefully they will speak to this rude woman, your salary depends on it!!!!",ajMkoFVOcJFdnFbBrUcZBA,0,0,1,e3Ti0Yry_aQUTjJjPhOisQ

Yesterday the pizza arrived not fully cooked with cold chicken as a topping.... soggy dough, cheese not melted. Wings (if you can call them that) barely had any sauce on them. It's better than delivery, it's Digiorno. Do yourself a favor. Order anything else from anywhere else and you will be happier.",NBlrcAIJo_zXt6x9cgWIjA,0,0,1,8790rwf9BC1lGiCWzS4QBA

Unfortunately my wing were not the way I requested, so I called the store on Craig Road and Decatur here in Las Vegas and spoke to Kyle.
