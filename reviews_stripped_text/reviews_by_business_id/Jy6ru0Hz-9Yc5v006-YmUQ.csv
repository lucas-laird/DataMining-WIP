My main problem was the service here. I waited 10-15 mins for my food. My order was wrong....and I drove off with no spoons to eat my acai bowl. I asked for no onions in my wrap but they put them in there anyways. Asked for no banana on top of acai bowl but still got them as well. This should have been a quick place to get food considering they have a drive thru...but all of this took 30 mins trying to get my order correct. This place is also pricey...which I understand because it's an organic wellness spot but being charged $50 for my order feels like a rip off when the service sucks.",Bpj4JTIMoz4YsNTm3aBxig,5,1,2,cuURlTb9s0U8-ye0tgDe4w

One was dated back to 17th 3 were dated 19th only 2 juices were made fresh today dated 20th. I thought they make their jucies fresh every day yeah right there goes the freshness.
Considering you should only keep the juices 24 hrs in the fridge before you lose the nutrition. According to my math all the nutritions are already lost in all of the 6 juices I have bought today. Since it has been 72 hrs for the oldest juice I have received from there today, it has lost all the nutritions. 
Since I am gonna start my cleanse tomorrow its gonna be 72-96 hrs for the supposedly freshly juiced juice cleanse. 
Not happy that I have just spend $50 on some old juice.

829275,2016-03-25,1,Jy6ru0Hz-9Yc5v006-YmUQ,"Update: the owner had me come back and re-try the island bowl. I am so glad I came back and tried because it was PERFECTION in a bowl. The granola came in large chunks and had such wonderful flavor! The fruits were so fresh and sweet! The staff was very welcoming and wonderful, and apologetic about my first experience. One of the best bowls I've had! This place has certainly gained a new regular.


I had a craving for a Pitaya bowl. Since Nekter in downtown SUMMERLIN is a farther drive and this place had pretty amazing reviews, I decided to try it out. I ordered an island bowl specifically because I am not a fan of blueberries. One of the toppings on my bowl was blueberries. I read a lot reviews raving about the homemade granola here but it was hard for me to fully appreciate that because I mostly got crumbs in my bowl, as if the my granola was taken from the very bottom of the container and no one had bother to refill it with fresh whole batch of granola. Again, I was disappointed. Thirdly, the Pitaya itself was quite bland as if it was watered down too much, and I didn't taste much of the mangoes as promised in the description. Sad to say, I will not be returning to try anything else since I was quite disappointed with my first experience. These types of bowls are not cheap so I would rather take the drive up to downtown SUMMERLIN Nekter where the food is consistently good and I don't have to worry about feeling like I wasted money on something I did not enjoy.",2rPuvCDJEjXlK7wR4tG17Q,4,1,5,IhT5TLEbpL-lG2JDHV2drQ

1095360,2016-05-08,0,Jy6ru0Hz-9Yc5v006-YmUQ,"I finally ventured off to try Fruits & Roots and I'm glad I did- I've been there 3 times just this week. The quality of the ingredients is definitely high, organic and healthy (which is what they market). They offer acai bowls, fresh pressed juices, superfood smoothies, and bowls and wraps for food. 

So far I have only tried the Chicken Gyro Wrap, but it is so good I haven't wanted to try anything else! Grilled chicken, chickpeas, feta, red onion, romaine lettuce and a Greek yogurt dressing. The acai bowls are incredibly refreshing and I love the smoothies. I get the detox smoothie- it has a 'different' flavor, I think due to the ginger and green tea mixed with the fruit to be honest, but I like weird flavors so I still enjoy it. The gummy bear is one of their most popular, with banana kale coconut and pineapple and it all ties together really well for a healthy yet flavorful boost.

The only downfall about this place in my opinion is the price. I completely understand you get what you pay for, but for 2 smoothies and 2 wraps it was about $50. I'm all about fresh ingredients but that's a little absurd!

I ordered the Sweet Greens juice and the Earth açaí bowl (comes with fruit toppings). Both were pretty much as expected for a typical juice bar, but with higher prices than most places I've been. The açaí bowl was about average size (10 oz or so) but was $10.50, and it seemed like all of their bowls were around $9-11. Their juices were around $8.50.

When I visited, Fruits and Roots was in a relatively empty complex with only two other customers inside. Despite this, it still took more than 15 minutes to prepare the açaí bowl. The juices are already in glass bottles and don't require any prep time. One of the main reasons that I go to juice bars is frequently for convenience. If it takes this long to wait for an açaí bowl, I could make one of these at home. It seemed to have fairly standard fruit and granola toppings as well. 

Overall the quality didn't justify the price here for my opinion. Also if I'm stopping by somewhere to grab something to go, I don't particularly anticipate or want to wait for 20 minutes (especially given that the store was essentially empty. I can't imagine how long this might take if there was more of a crowd.) 

I'll probably continue going to Pressed Juicery instead - higher quality, more unique ingredient combinations, and faster service at a similar price point.",DV8r9FhLv6Ay5pSkvgainQ,3,2,3,j-D9mcwPkHCcNOyWMhABwg

Took 20 or 30 minutes just to get smoothies and food. Everything else was great, including the employees. They handled it really well, very pleasant.

The wrap is not bad, it has a very clean taste..chicken can be a little more tender, maybe more variety on the selection to build your own wrap. 

People working there are super young, they are nice and friendly, but NOT trained.  Kind of slow and no knowledge of the menu that well.  Organic eaters are very picky, so my suggestion will be train them 100% knowing the food and menu.",IfcoJjX578uW2eTawMELrg,2,1,4,l1SNVOvvN45LnrB0Weh-Jw

It took over ten minutes to place my order, and I was the only person in line.  The girl behind the counter was busy preparing other patron's meals.  She was very pleasant as was the entire staff, as they were trying to complete orders.  I didn't mind terribly, but felt bad for others waiting.  I ordered the Chicken Quinoa salad.  Considering it is all organic, you can expect to pay a premium, but the portion for 11 dollars was reasonable.  Unfortunately, there was no Quinoa on the salad, and I didn't realize it until I got back to my office; bummer.  I was hoping to have the Vitality Beat juice, but it was sold - for the season.  I suggest taking it off the menu.  Instead I ordered the Beat It - It is good, not exactly the flavor I was interested in and that is because of the Cilantro and Celery,  It tastes like it should be hot.  Cool jar though.  All in all if your looking for a good juice bar this place has potential...It's new and I am sure will get better as they work out the kinks.  I followed it up with a banana laffy taffy - so much for eating healthy today.

(new)I changed my rating from three stars to four because I believe that good customer service makes up for a lot.  The owner reached out to me on Yelp; come to find she was also the one who helped me. As I mentioned previously, very pleasant.  She offered a complimentary bowl, and as tempting as that sounds, I would be happy to pay for it and give them another try simply because they care about their customers.

When I finally looked down to see an almost finished bowl I noticed a blueberry that was completely moldy and was covered in green fuzz.  I decided to give it another try a few weeks later, thinking that it was a one time fluke.  As I was eating my second bowl I noticed something inedible.

I do love that they add pumpkin seeds on top since it adds more texture. My only complaint is the fact that I noticed a few chunks of frozen fruit in my bowl that I didn't expect and were too hard to chew. They are a bit pricy for the amount they give you so it just disappointed me that I couldn't eat my whole bowl since there were a few hard chunks of fruit.

I slept early and woke up before my alarm clock on day 2. I've never felt better. I'm more alert, I'm not starving, and I can focus better. I smashed through my to do list- no problem!

Wrong orders, long waits for simple items, being overcharged, etc. The food is great but very expensive and with bad service too there's no way I can continue to fork over that amount of money regardless of the food. I ordered a cashew cafe in the drive thru and was made to wait probably 6-8 mins, not exaggerating which is long for a drink that is pre bottled every morning. I was finally given the drink and drove away when I looked at the emailed receipt and I was charged $14!!! I then looked at the drink and I was given the cashew cream which is a less expensive drink as well! The line was extremely long in the drive thru and I had to get back to work so I had to park and go in. The place was empty. Why such a long wait??? I showed the cashier the mistake and they said they had run out of the cashew cafe that day and I could drink some of my drink and they could add the espresso shot after. How unprofessional. 
This is after many times ordering there with bad service I will give a place a chance because everyone has off days but it has gotten so ridiculous at this point I would be an idiot to eat there again.

Fruit and Roots had no idea nice diversity of food that on the menu. It was my first time. I always thought more healthy juice spot. They have nice not huge but great selection of salad and and sandwiches. All of them catered towards healthy side. I was only craving acai bowl but plan on going back for regular food.

The acai bowls they have few choose from so asked for recommendation. I got the Island Bowl. Which is one of the more popular choices and after killing the whole bowl understand why. Really good. All the fruit on top was super fresh, no bruises, and looked so refreshing. It was fruit artwork the way they had everything laid out on top. The portion size is great! I definitely would order this acai bowl again and again.

I would have not even known it was there unless I drove by. I was going down sunset from Durango which is off the beaten path a bit. That being said the place itself is clean and nicely decorated.. has a contemporary beachy feel to it. The staff were very friendly. I ordered the hummus wrap with the vinaigrette dressing, ginger tea and a energy shot of some sort. The shot was pretty good but a bit acidic. The ginger tea was good and mellow. The wrap at first was just okay.. it took a couple bites for me to get to the collage of food that made this wrap really good. I would tell people that there is a specific way to eat this wrap. Because all the flavors together are great. Eating one side or the other of it loses its luster. But when you have all the veggies and vinaigrette and hummus on one bite makes it pretty marvelous.. I'm finding out more and more that it's quite pricey to eat vegan at a restaurant. All of them are about the same in price.. I ordered the wrap, ginger tea and shot and it came out to $24. That seems to be the going rate actually. at first I was like holy heck they're expensive. Now it just seems to be the norm. Overall they were a good place.

The immunity shot is awesome!  I like their selection of shots.  The facility is clean and well-done; they have a drive through.  My only issue has been when I have ordered the mint smoothie, the first time, it blew me away.  It was so minty and perfect.  I came back a few days later to buy it again and it tasted totally different (barely any mint and mostly banana).  Because I had saved it to drink last - after the nutmilks I had purchased, I was far away from the store to mention it.  The next time I came in, I had mentioned my experience and the staff was ridiculously super nice and wanted to make my drink right.  I appreciated it!  It still did not come out like the first time so unfortunately, I just don't order the mint smoothie anymore.  Also, I have gone here the last few times and they don't have a large selection in the early morning - I asked when a good time was to come and the staff said later around 11 or 12 in the afternoon.  It kind of defeats the purpose of coming for juice prior to work and for my morning nutrition.  I'm usually not near the area by noon so it's a bit disappointing.

Island Bowl (tried twice)
Gummy Bear Smoothie (tried once)
Mint Chip Smoothie (tried once)

During finals week (Dec. 2017) I needed a healthy pick me up and tried their Island Bowl for the first time. It was adequate but quite small for around $10. Additionally, I have tried an organic pitaya bowl from locally owned Juice N Go (on S. Rainbow and Oakey) that was much more flavorful, larger (various fruits topped the bowl), and less expensive. Thus, Fruits and Roots disappointed me when compared to Juice N Go. 

On February 10, 2018 I tried Fruits and Roots for the second time. I had the Mint Chip smoothie which was deliciously creamy and tasted just like a mint chocolate shake. I was impressed. I should note I waited 16 minutes in the drive through, with only one other individual in front of me.

Since my smoothie was so good on February 10 I decided to try to give the Island Bowl another try along with the Gummy Bear smoothie on February 11, 2018. One word: BLAND. So terribly bland and my smoothie was lukewarm.

I really enjoy the concept of Fruits and Roots; the fact that they use organic products is very refreshing.

It is fresh juice but I could not see it made and worried with so much business how the cleanliness is. Assume it's good but it would be hard to keep up with all that fresh preparation. 

I've only been once but it does get a 4 star from me. 

I got several juices and a lemonade I liked them all.

On the adjacent wall is a giant mural of how various foods and spices (like ginger and turmeric) are good for you. 

My husband had a Kickstarter wellness shot, which was a mix of ACV, turmeric, lemon juice, ginger and cherry, and the Protein Bowl. I had the Island Bowl. Because we were headed out to Irvine, we also got two smoothies for the road so we wouldn't have to worry about lunch. I got the large Detox and he got the Super Fruit. 

First off, when we initially got there, there was only one other person inside eating a breakfast bowl. The parking lot was empty. This cafe is next to a brand spanking new development that is currently under construction. It looks like there is nothing but construction around the store but it's right off Sunset.

Second, it was a rough start. There was a lot of talking amongst the workers and it seemed like we were interrupting a gossip session. Because I was ordering what amounted to 2 meals I got a funny look. ""You want this AND that?"" was the question. ""Yes,"" I said, wondering if I needed to break into a full-blown defense of my healthy eating choices. It wasn't a slab of ribs AND a pan of lasagna, for goodness sakes. 

We sat down and they brought each item out to us when it was ready. I'm not sure if this is standard operating procedure or if it was because we were the only ones in the joint. But know that only your food comes to you- you need to get up and get forks, spoons and napkins yourself. Our bowls were very good. 

The young lady who originally verified my two meal decision brought out our smoothies. ""How is everything?"" she asked. From that point forward everything was peachy. Because I track my food, I asked if they had nutrition information and they said no (they are working on it), but another very kind lady behind the counter helped me with measurements of the ingredients in my bowl. 

We must have come after the morning rush because one of the workers was leaving. On her way out she said good-bye to us and asked us how everything was.

All in all, a great experience with healthy, non-GMO food. I'm taking one star off for cost. For our breakfasts, one wellness shot, and lunch smoothies it was 47.00. I would rather pay the money for food I know is good for me, but (almond) Cheese N (GF) Crackers, I'm not Daddy-stinkin'-Warbucks!",j-S8HA2HMZD2yuTMpax-Lw,2,2,4,xBIB61VoRwA3VLA2zvgehQ

If you're on the go like I am, they have a drive-thru where you can get your healthy grub and hit the road with a fresh juice, wellness shot or latte in hand.

The drive-thru option is great and I really enjoyed my iced vanilla latte with cashew milk and espresso. Yes, they have cashew milk as an option and I love it!  I will always order almond, coconut or cashew if they have dairy alternatives. The latte was super refreshing.  It wasn't full of junk and it was lightly sweetened with agave. It's bit pricier than your typical Starbucks (rightly so).  You're going to pay a small premium for quality and I'm totally fine with that.

Just so happens, this place had both! Score! I ordered the super fruit smoothy and the fruit snack. 

First the good.

     Drive through place with healthy food..about time we got one of those in Spring Valley. The fruit snack had really fresh apples, pineapple, and bananas it was delicious, it even came with a little bit of greek yogurt to dip your fruit in!

Second the meh,
 
    I guess I am out of the smoothy loop these days or didn't read the menu carefully enough cause I figured a super fruit smoothie would taste fruity.....It tasted like ground tree bark, ""super root smoothy"" would have been a more accurate name for it. It was a slightly disturbing brown/green/mud color (check out the picture). I even had some co-workers taste it to make sure I was not just having an off day and they agreed that it was not very pleasant. I guess that may be on me for not really knowing what I was ordering, or it is entirely possible that I may have accidentally got someone else's order by mistake and got some off the wall smoothy with different ingredients than i expected. Definitely will not be ordering that one again, that taste really took me by surprise. But I still finished the entire thing because I am stubborn and did not want to waste any bit of a $15 dollar breakfast, which brings me to the cost. Around $15 for both items, that is $15 for a 14 oz. fruit smoothy and maybe a half an apple, a quarter pineapple, 1/2 a banana and maybe 2 oz of greek yogurt in the ""Fruit snack"". I felt at that price it better be top notch, which the ""fruit snack"" was, but the super fruit smoothy missed the mark by a long shot. If I ever decide to go back and try Fruits and Roots again I think I am going to stick with the Juices.

So if it's close to your house...and you have want juice plus a salad...then I would go.
But if you just want a smoothie, I would probably go to Jamba juice (you can get protein ones there, too).
If you want some healthy pastries, you seriously have to go to Great Grubbin on St. Rose. There the stuff is packed with protein, low carb, and actually tastes like a real pastry.

I've tried: (off the top of my head) 24 carrot, gummy bear, mint chip, banana bread, acai bowl with whey, chicken quinoa bowl and all are excellent choices! There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Everything is always neat, clean and orderly.  

There's only one suggestion I have, encase, glue down or replace the back of the seating glass bottles. I have two kids, they love it but I hate it. Children and broken glass is just a nightmare waiting to happen.

Stopped by the other day on my way to Ikea, was so pleased with the interior, black chalkboard wall with chalk drawings of veggies and fruits. White subway tile lines back walls with large commercial refrigerators and an attractive greens bar (similar to a salad bar, but the workers make the dishes). 
They offer coffee and acai bowls, pressed juices and smoothies, nut milks, and at this location, scrumptious salad combos. 
What I find so admirable in comparison to other juiceries is this place is all organic! The price for a 13 oz juice is $8, whereas the price for a 16 oz juice at other local juice places is $12 or more! But this one is all organic everything, which I can appreciate paying the $8 for a clean, organic juice. Let's be honest that drinking any juice, organic or not, will be healthier than going without the vitamin packed beverage, but if given the option, I prefer organic. 
This place is clean and well-maintained and even has a drive thru. 
The worker behind the counter was very helpful and considerate when I asked if she could add some extra ginger to my green juice.

The first time we did an online order, I went to pick up and they let me know there were no online orders and asked if I ordered at blue diamond. I hadn't but stepped aside to make sure when she goes, ""oh here it is"".  I work retail and know how online orders work, I also know what I would say if I had forgot to check for online orders. The food is good so we tried again the next day. We ordered a couple bowls, a smoothie and a vegan cheesecake. One bowl had cacao nibs added to it which were paid for but not present in the bowl. Most disappointing is the cheesecake was frozen! Why? Why would you even tell people you have them available if you had literally just taken them out of the freezer. They also pre-make all the bowls so you can't change or sub anything. That makes it seem not so fresh. We'll try the other location next time.",kiFx0RnyMY2HkkEegedMOg,0,0,3,38XOQL7DmUg7v0RwFs0QYw

She explained they had sampled a different brand of açaí the day I first gave them a try. So I retried the Pure Bowl & yes, there was a definite difference from my first experience. I could taste the açaí & it was perfect, not too sweet or bland. I also loved that the bananas were so ripe. Too often, restaurants use bananas that aren't ready yet & there is an obvious difference in taste. There is also a complete difference between bowls that use produce with GMOs versus those that use all organic produce. I love that I'm reassured that this place is organic with every bite. My açaí bowl today also reminded me of how delicious their granola is! Thank you Patricia for contacting me & convincing me to give the bowl another shot. You've just gained a new regular :)

This place is located right off the 215 and it's very easy to miss because nobody really gets off Buffalo, and I'm kicking myself for not coming in until now!  I ordered the pure bowl because I wanted a classic Acai bowl and it was great.  I'm glad the granola was at the bottom because usually everything is at the top and it gets hard to mix.  The blueberries and strawberries were fresh as well.  The banana was ripe too!  Only thing is since Acai bowls are limited in Vegas, you don't get too much bang for your buck like you would in Cali or Hawaii.

Cons: Drive through, inconsistency, lil pricey

I've been going to fruits and roots over the past year or so because it's literally across the street from my house and I LOVE it. That being said like any other place it has its faults which are totally understandable. I would not recommend going through the drive through if you need to get a bowl or if someone else is in front of you. It just takes such a long time. This isn't their fault at all it just sucks when the person in front of you orders 3 bowls and you're waiting for let's say a juice. That'll be a 15 minute wait easily. Other fault, sometimes I feel like maybe they don't have enough people? There's been times I've ordered to go and when I get there 10-15 minutes later to pay they're barely starting it. Lastly, inconsistency. There are days my bowls feel heaven sent and there are days I think about giving this place one star because I just paid $11 for a bowl that wasn't even filled up and sloppily done. However this place is fresh and clean and for the majority do a good job so I keep coming back.

Loved the drive through and idea of this place unfortunately I no longer feel this way.
My work relocated nearby in August so I've been coming here 2-3 times a week for the last 4 months spending on average $60-$90 per week. Their service is always pretty slow (which can be understandable being that everything is freshly made) but sometimes it was ridiculous. I started getting annoyed when the Vegan Caesar wrap changed with every order. It started tasting different or missing ingredients every single time. If I'm paying $14-16 for a wrap, it better be consistent and the same as my last visit. Needless to say the constant disappointment here has made me visit less in the last few weeks. 

Anyway, today I was officially over this place.
I pull up, order a Banana Walnut Loaf, Green Juice and Gift Card for my friend. I wait in line for 13 minutes. YES- 13 I counted them.  So I get to the window where my total is 40 something dollars. I hand her a $100 bill. She says she can't take it. WTF- it's not like I'm ordering a $3 item. Anyway, she refuses. I pull out my card... so now she hands me my juice. It's not filled all the way. Ugh. OVER IT.

Next, gift card. The person working the window has zero clue on how to activate a ""gift card"". After waiting 13 minutes, being told I couldn't pay with the only cash I had and then getting not full juice that was the last thing I wanted to deal with.  P.s. they don't have actual gift cards/ certificates. They have some kind of Name/ Phone number system which is a NO for me. The whole set up was not very giftable. I prefer an actual gift card I can give someone not ""oh hey I got you a gift, give them my name and phone number and you can pick it up""

Anyway, I aborted the gift card mission and left with my juice and loaf. 
I've been really disappointed in a place I used to love it but lately has been fail after fail- today was my final straw and this was my final visit. My love affair with this place is over. :(",tt388DQMt1hhvnmyLbwvNA,3,1,2,ADmhWXYOuARRIKqc5hrj8g

5424465,2016-01-24,0,Jy6ru0Hz-9Yc5v006-YmUQ,"Let me just begin by saying I am not a healthy eater. I have never liked organic juices or anything super organic because it tastes like dirt to me, so I wouldn't be caught dead in Fruits & Roots because it falls into that category. However, being that my best friend works there and the owner is my former employer and i love them both, I had to support them and check it out. To start, they have a drive through; I love the concept because especially in the winter, I don't like getting out of my car unless I absolutely have to. My best friend recommended I try the island bowl to start. My favorite thing about it is the color, a vibrant pink color from the pitaya. It contains a mixture of granola, pitaya, banana, blackberries, coconut shavings & coconut water; Possibly more ingredients but that is just what is visible. It has somewhat of a yogurt texture but with a little more crunch because of the granola(home-made too btw)...Seriously AMAZING! I could literally eat it every day and never get sick of it. You would think there is sugar in it because it is perfectly sweet, most of the time if you blend fruit by itself it is really bitter without sugar. Next, i popped inside on my lunch break and had their Greek salad which was delicious! The dressing was wonderful, not too thick, not to thin and the greens were so fresh and crunchy! The chicken had just the right amount of seasoning and wasn't dry or bland. After that, I hadn't been back for a while because of work and such but allergy season is upon us and I am one of the lucky ones who breaks out in hives. I then decided that I should clean up my diet a little and attempt to lead a healthier lifestyle because certain foods can make my hives worse like excessive salt & sugar. My friend then had me try the island greens juice which literally looks like grass in a bottle. However, it tastes nothing like grass and is actually much better than other green juices that i have tried in the past...I am slowly adjusting to the tastes of organic health foods but with the help of Fruits & Roots I am now more open to the change:) Plus, if you have any health issues and you need a customized juice, Patricia(the owner) is an open book and eager to help, she recommended turmeric for my hives and now I make sure its in every juice I order and it helps:) Thanks pretty ladies!

I tend to get the pure bowl because it's classic and their granola tastes amazing, but I've tried protein bowl and earth bowl previous times. Protein bowl, I asked for vegan powder and it did alter the taste and consistent of the bowl, but overall it was ok. Earth bowl was my least favorite, it just wasn't as sweet as I liked and it definitely tasted more green, just not what I was looking for in a açaí bowl. 

As for food, Hummus wraps are my go to and they are huge and filling. They have so much ingredients of amazingness and previously I had the Chicken Gyro which was well seasoned, wonderful with the toasted chickpeas and yogurt dressing which was on the side so I can control how much so it doesn't get too saucy in the wrap and leak everywhere. 

Also, wellness shots are my always go to when there's that time of feeling down. I always get the Immunity shot since it covers majority of the ingredients that are in the other shots.

The 3 employees working at the time looked either tired, hated their job or unhappy. Another girl took my order and telling her it was my first time here, I wanted to try their fruit bowls. She told me that they have either acai bowl or pitaya bowl so I said ""I'll take the pitaya bowl."" Then she was like, ""That's an island bowl."" Okay my bad? Maybe I'm being sensitive but if they had a better attitude I wouldn't feel that way. She made my 'Island Bowl' as well and when it was finished she just handed it to me and turned around, walked away. 

The bowl was pretty but the taste was whatever. I do feel healthy eating it though. The pitaya tasted bland and the fruits didn't look that fresh. The bananas had some brown and the strawberries were dull. Thinking the toppings were just on top, I tried to finish it so I can get to the rest of the pitaya on the bottom. However, the entire bowl was filled with granola bites making it so dry. I might come back and try their juices out.. but they were all bottled up pre made before so it's not freshly blended juice that I prefer.

UPDATE: I did come back to give this place a second try. The experience and quality was better than the last.",gF1XjTQ2yiSJe28o60gozQ,4,2,2,9ymq6ie9s48_naEzgtWolQ

This most delicious granola adorned our perfect Acai Earth Bowl. It was fresh and excellent! The Island bowl is fantastic too. Very bright and refreshing. Even though menu says it comes with blueberries, it doesn't. (Heads up) The Beat It cold pressed juice was also perfectly balanced, refreshing and made the cells dance. 

They also offer beautiful made to order salads with or without meat. Dressings are also made in house too. They also offer an excellent variety of nutrient dense smoothies.  

On one occasion the atmosphere was pleasant and inviting with 70-80's music at a good volume, (not blasting) so you can still have a good conversation. Sadly, on another occasion music was blasting EDM music and rap music. Doesn't seem appropriate for the ""healing"" environment. On certain days some staff was friendly and generous with smiles and other days no greeting and no thank you. (Little better training needed) Thus 4 stars instead of 5.

The patio was quiet, and I loved the plant towers of fruits and vegetables that grew behind me.

5608322,2016-05-06,1,Jy6ru0Hz-9Yc5v006-YmUQ,"The food is fantastic, but the experience leaves something to be desired.

The build-your-own wrap or bowl option is where the issue lies - the board lists how many of each type of option you can choose (1 protein, 1 grain, etc), but not what the choices are.  Some of the items are laid out, but some (like the beans) have covers and there are no labels.  On top of this, rather than walking down the line and making your selections, the cashier insists that I have to choose what I want FIRST, even though I have no way of knowing what is available.

What has ended up happening during both of my visits is a line build-up, and it necessitates going through the order several times before the staff successfully communicates to each other what the order is.  If the purpose of laying out the available ingredients is to allow the customer to choose the items as they go down the line, then the flow of traffic should reflect that. Additionally, each employee should be adequately trained for their position (the staff member on the register clearly had no idea how to use the register, for example).  There is no capacity to handle any kind of volume.  

I work nearby, and would come here for lunch multiple times a week if it wasn't a frustrating, 20 minute process to get a wrap containing all of the ingredients I paid for.",eZ0WO0H_1CaD4kUeR0Y2TQ,2,0,3,it6O1k7H64wmVHYZGTogTA

You'd be wise to order ahead and pick up. Next tried the Maca-choco, which at first tastes just like any ordinary banana smoothie so you might be disappointed. But as I kept drinking it, something magical happened and all of these hidden flavors started to reveal themselves and it ended up tasting more complex than is initially apparent to the taste buds.

But I seriously don't understand why establishments (especially one like this that is solely thriving off the hard work of the employees) doesn't allow you to tip on a credit card. I never go anywhere with cash on me and I never spend less than $50 every time I come here. It's unfair to the employees who are ensuring that I keep coming back. 

Today I ordered 2 bowls, a wrap, a smoothie and a juice and the girls working had it all bagged up and ready to go in less than 10 minutes. And of course, I open my wallet and don't have a single cash dollar to give them. 

Other than that, this business has not one thing to improve. From now on I'll make sure I don't come unless I have 20% in cash to tip because the girls today DEFINITELY deserved it.",lhEc9SJB4QD5UCpTLzaeKg,0,0,5,nrfCW7PA5z1Ur1h_wkEpHQ

I was born and raised in Las Vegas and my mom was from Israel..she used to juice when we were younger juice before it became a thing you could actually go and buy at a restaurant! I had yet to find anything that matched my mom's skills until I came to Fruits and Roots! 

ALL GREEN EVERYTHING is my go to especially when I am needing that pick me up and lacking on my veggies! Training, working full time I know I can get what I need from that juice!  You can order it by the bottle or ask for ice in a cup lately that is what I have been doing you can even order a small size!

My favorite item to order on the menu is the Gyro Wrap....I am Moroccan so I can be picky about this also...I took one bite and tasted a roasted garbanzo bean and almost lost my mind haha ok maybe not lost my mind but fell in love! The tortilla is so light and the seasoning on the chicken is so good! If you are looking for a more low carb option get this same gyro flavor in a salad bowl version! The tahini dressing is everything and everything is so fresh...It's a flavor explosion in your mouth and so delicious!

The last two times have been a complete miss. The black rice has been severely undercooked, it hurt my teeth to chew. Also, the chickapeas have been chewy, not the nice crunchy texture that I was introduced to. Sometimes they skimp on the avocado too. It is not a cheap salad, so my expectations are a bit high. The juice is great, I have no complaints. As for the hummus cups, if you go towards the latter part of the day, they are likely to be sold out. Although, one day I tried  to order a hummus cup and the lady said they were out, then she told me that they were out of black beans for my vegan Caesar and asked if I'd like to add hummus for protein. . .. strange.

Was craving an açai bowl so I asked my husband to go out and grab one. Since we moved a little bit further from our favorite spot we both decided that we'd try a this place. 

We ordered one acai bowl, an island bowl, and an apple spice drink. The acai bowl was good but small. There were pumpkin seeds in it which was different than any of the other bowls I've had. 

The island bowl is made with pitaya which was pretty and pink. When my husband opened this bowl there was a yellow flower in the middle of the bowl. Under the flower was a little rolly Polly bug!!! He wasn't upset about it being there, but I was. I hate bugs in my food! It was too late to go back there plus he never got a receipt. So he decided he would just eat the bowl.
