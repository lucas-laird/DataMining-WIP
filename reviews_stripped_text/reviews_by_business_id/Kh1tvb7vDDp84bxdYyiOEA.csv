I ordered the tacos before and this time a burrito, even the chips they give you with salsa and cheese is good. I go out my way to eat at this place. I once went to a party they catered it was truly amazing I alway order the chicken.",2H8SnEl-eRDfQbY5SmfyCg,0,0,5,cP9mCFFq1sqZfLxcBFqinQ

2647080,2017-05-01,0,Kh1tvb7vDDp84bxdYyiOEA,I'm not gonna lie. I was so hungry after the bar. And I was looking for some food. And there was a taco truck. It was Pablo's truck. Not gonna lie probably the best food I've ever eaten in my whole life it was so fresh the service was amazing and everybody was incredible. I don't come to Vegas often but every time I do I will be sure to find out where they are hanging out with their tent and that rail making some fresh food. Best part of my trip. Find them,FWwCPLhmjMzBikO88mfYrw,0,0,5,9RYNjL8AKwF-T0I1PpMCHg

They had a distinct flavor, and the other mexican food in Vegas can't be compared to it. Highly recommend to locals or tourists in Vegas!",ILaYU_vHTgyNhRScCg-pGA,0,0,5,VuZzrFxEu4FiVRVI1tTAQA
3520284,2017-09-30,37,Kh1tvb7vDDp84bxdYyiOEA,"I found Pablo's Kitchen food truck at the Food Truck Party in Centennial Center. The people working the truck were friendly and they have foil to cover your food if you are looking to pick up some grub to take home. Check their social media pages for where the truck will be next. Be prepared even if there isn't a line to wait for your order as it's prepared fresh.

Nachos ($10) - A huge pile a chips with beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole and your choice of meat, I picked steak. You can also choose red or green sauce, I went with green. I'm glad that my hubby was there to share the nachos with me because it's a lot! For $10 I was worried it was overpriced nachos, but seriously you get your monies worth. The chips tasted fresh and there was a fair amount of steak on the nachos. The beans were in need of some salt and while I saw green sauce, I couldn't taste it. These nachos were still tasty and the perfect size for sharing. 

They also serve street tacos, tortas, burritos, sopes and quesadillas.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,56,57,4,nfb9yjwKGrmKH43Er-Ym_A

So many different flavors and the delievery service is a great bonus. Reccommend him too everyone in the greater Las Vegas area.",2w1bL03nEFRxxiF2IvPEjA,0,0,5,uXV2cKEelOgdejIGw14R1g

I believe they also had burritos and other things but don't miss the tacos. They fry the tortilla in a little bit of oil and you get that taquero smell. You know what I'm talking about. 
Find them and eat there!",sOap-anYdRYHtqZl8qaetw,0,0,5,kG1Wnw72FVncb-xZ85NOrg
