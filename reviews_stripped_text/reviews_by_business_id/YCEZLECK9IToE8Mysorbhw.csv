56682,2012-09-15,0,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"Stopped in on a recommendation and found that this is a nice little new spot in the neighborhood. Tight little menu of healthy choices. I had the Mediterranean salad, which was excellent. Good portion size, (not too much) lettuce, cucumber, tomato, capers, and lots of quinoa, all dressed at just the right amount in a citrus vinaigrette. 

Small seating area inside and some outdoor seating too, overlooking the parking lot and a busy street. 

Looking forward to trying this place again.",z3QfjD55F6YjDNIjcii5Ew,0,0,4,n5fjImh2H28U7cu4TM9oIQ

The service at Daily Kitchen isn't the fastest but that is expected for good fresh food. However today, we decided to call our order in for pickup. They specified our order would be ready in 15 minutes. When I arrived 15 minutes later our order was not ready and they said it was almost ready and the girl said she would bring it to me. 
After waiting for almost 40 minutes and watching people come and go with their orders after mine I decided to check on it again. Now all of a sudden my order was ready and had been sitting there. I no longer wanted the food and asked for a refund, which they did honor with no problem and offered  to give us the food anyway. Which was a nice gesture... however the food was cold. So it had obviously been sitting on their counter for quite some time. The potstickers we had ordered had parts of the to go cardboard container stuck to them from sitting so long. Sweet potato fries were cold and stale tasting. The tuna wrap my husband ordered barely had a scoop of tuna in it and my mashed sweet potatoes & salmon were cold. It was very disappointing to receive this type of  service & quality of food from a place we really enjoy.",3aZ8QjvZCyOT8UX3X2v-bA,4,0,1,LTyglnlwwCIEF8FCFmxfiw
97745,2017-02-17,0,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,Wow!  This is a really chill small spot in Summerlin with high quality food and fantastic service.  They serve Mary's Free Range All Natural Chicken off the rotisserie which is really cool cause there are not too many rotisserie restaurants out there.  I got their combo option so I was able to add 2 sides and man did they have a great selection.  I opted for Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Curried Cauliflower since the Jackson said these were the 2 most popular.  I got a 1/4 white with those 2 sides for ONLY $12.  You can't get better food than this for that cheap and it was super fast.  I also had Sweet Valencia Water which was a delicious drink option that they make in house.  They also have tri tip beef so that's what I'm having on my next trip.  You have to check this place out...,pP0bXtwCI7gIPMeRwFXtSA,0,0,5,TvaOYtNld2DyzxuJlxl4SA

Last time I had it and it was a thick blended version of the sauce; wasn't a big fan of that. But they changed it back again to a chunkier, chopped version of the chimichurri and it is fantastic! Hopefully they won't change it again because they really got the sauce right this time. Dark meat rotisserie is very flavorful as well as their curry cauliflower. A perfect, quiet ambiance to sit outside in the shade. Next time, I will bring my laptop and get some work done during the calmer weekday afternoons.

336053,2013-02-04,0,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"We went in on Saturday and ordered three juices and a hamburger. The hamburger came out in about ten or twelve minutes with no sign of our juices. Three other people then came in after us and ordered juices. I only know this because these three people got their juices and still,  know sign of our juices. At this point we had been waiting about 25 minutes. I went up to speak to someone. There were two managers on duty and the person that actually helped me was not a manager, but an ""assistant supervisor"". I stayed calm and asked her what is going on. She seemed nice enough, but all she could muster was that it is usually not like this. After cajoling her to get our juices going she offered to give me some coupons. So ten minutes pass and we get the juices one at a time. When we get the last juice it was brought out by a young girl with absolutely no sign of the assistant supervisor, no apology, no coupons...no nothing. So, the food is good, but really expensive and the service, well, my review covers that.  The only power consumers have is their choice and I will never go again.

I was horrified at what took place that day, that I just got up and left and did not touch my food.  I have Celiacs.  They post that they serve gluten free products, and they are a wellness bar.  I have been there before and explained it.  I loved the ahi tuna tacos and the chef before had made them for me using lettuce as a wrap and no sauce (soy sauce does have gluten in it).  I ordered them as usual (no sauces & lettuce wrap) & explained to the little counter girl that I cannot have gluten.  I got my order and there was carrots on it that have been soaked in something and had soy sauce on it.  I took it back to the counter & asked what had the carrots been in.  She talked to the chef & he said they were pickled. I asked the chef if it contained soy sauce.  It turns out it had been.  I explained that I am Celiacs and cannot have gluten at all and it was in there.  They were more than happy to make me a new one.  When I got it back,1 minute later.  All the chef had done was take the carrots off and serve it back to me.  There was still soy sauce all over the ahi.  If I ingested this, I would have been so sick.  I was appalled at this.  I just left.  If you say you carry gluten free products and are a wellness place, I would hope that you know ingesting something you are allergic too would make your costumers sick.

We've been going to Rise N Shine, but I find that they're too pricey (like over $40 for the two of us) and the place is way too overcrowded and noisy.  
This past Saturday, we decided to give Daily Kitchen a try.  I highly recommend sitting outside on the patio - very relaxed, quiet and dog friendly.  The service was great.  The food choices are on the healthier side and prices are good. I like being able to get breakfast for under $10.  Best of all - Coffee Bean is next door.  So if you're a coffee snob, you can get the good stuff at Coffee Bean.  Daily Kitchen also serves coffee, but I did not try it.  My breakfast sandwich was made to order and was a generous portion.

Although initially a bit annoyed I was of course pleasantly surprised by this offer and my husband and I ended up eating the sweet potsto fries while waiting. The fries were good, could have been crunchier but probably because they had been in the take out container.

I saw someone eating the kale salad and it looked really good so I was going to order it too but didn't have the time. Overall this was a great little lunch spot and s clearly very popular.

857288,2012-01-05,2,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"Yep, found my new go-to healthy spot.  Rachel's Kitchen who?

I am so excited Daily Kitchen took over the space recently vacated by Rachel's Kitchen.  It has a similar, health focused menu and will delight those looking for fresh, organic dining.  Menu selections include healthy pastas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, breakfast, juices and burgers.  

I'd highly recommend their bean burger ($7.50).  The burger comes with a black bean patty and caramelized onions on a whole-wheat bun.  This wasn't your typical freezer section black bean patty--it tasted homemade. It was phenomenal.  The bun was also warm and homemade--another win!

Each of the burgers come with a salad, fruit or sweet potato fries.  I enjoyed my side salad but the dressing (I think it was some type of vinaigrette) was pretty bland.  I'd prefer more seasoning in the dressing.

The Ahi Ahi tacos were also pretty good but, at $9.50, I wish they came with some type of side.  Three small tacos sitting in the middle of a large plate was less than visually appealing. I felt bad for the tacos, they looked so pathetic and small.  However, the tacos were nicely prepared (although slightly underseasoned) and the tuna was good quality.  I'm not sure I'd order this again.

I can't wait to go back to try their organic breakfasts and juices (and eat 500 more black bean burgers).  They better not move!

I say that because I order the DK Protein salad for my 30minute lunch, it was made with spring mix lettuce, everything was good until I finish half of the salad and then the rest of the lettuce was very bad and wilted, with black moldy parts of the leaf like its been sitting in the bowl for days. I didn't have time to take it back, because my lunch break was almost over. It was disappointing but I gave it another chance the next week and order the same DK Protein Salad but this time the lettuce is different, it's not the spring mix lettuce but a different type of green lettuce chopped up. i feel that if you used a certain type of lettuce and is written on the menu that thats what you should use all the time and not switch it every week and half way through my salad there was a piece of hair and a gnat in it. Running short on time again I had to throw it out. 
I'm very upset because the salad is not cheap and its not made with fresh lettuce and/or making sure its cleaned, especially for a healthier restaurant. Also the fruits are hit and miss, probably won't be supporting the place anymore.",KmQhcAX_ndXitWaffAnqSg,1,0,2,DQ-CsU5VT2twrpOh3QMLBw

When I find something I love, I continue to order it over and over again. I loved the chicken avocado & egg breakfast wrap, but on my last few visits there was hardly any avocado and the chicken was extremely dry. It used to be so juicy and fresh!

There is a great variety of healthy foods and beverages here, and an incredibly nice owner.  Yes, Daily Kitchen is in the old Rachel's spot, but it is not Rachels.  The decor has been updated and the seating in the room has been efficiently designed.  

A huge draw here, is the seating outside between The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  If you have a really nice car, chances are you probably come here (Judging by the parking lot)  If you don't have a nice car, come here anyways, the food tastes good, even in your rusty El Camino.

I enjoyed the spicy Thai Chicken Wrap on my visit.  The dressing was so wonderful.  It had great flavor and heat, and was light.  My only complaint about the wrap, was that the dressing was all at the bottom, and the way the ingredients were mixed in, there were some bites which didn't feature all the fillings.  I love Cilantro, but a few bites were pure Cilantro which was overwhelming.  Still, I felt healthy while eating it, and it filled me up.

I came back this evening  specifically because it was so awesome. I ordered nearly the exactly the same thing...but it feels like I was at an entirely different restaurant- and not in a good way.

Ordered the ahi tuna tacos for myself, again, and my guy opted for the spicy thai chicken wrap this time, with the same side of Brussels sprouts. 
Tacos were not as big as last time, and other than the fish, they only contained carrots (no cilantro?), one lonely avocado slice, and a squirt of sauce. What was fresh and popping with flavor last time was underwhelming and bland this time, and the bottoms of the tacos were drenched to the point that they were nearly soggy with lime juice (or maybe it was water from the carrots?) and dripping everywhere.
The wrap had a lot of very spicy sauce- possibly meant to drown out the small amount of dry chicken. Wrap, like the tacos, had noticeably less filling this time, and the flavor was off balance: proportions wrong, overwhelming sauce, not much else to speak of.
Even the sprouts, so delicious and flavorful last time, were the last item out and somehow undercooked- left half the bowl behind, flavorless and rock-hard.

I have no idea what happened.
The food wasn't anywhere near as good as our first visit. I'll give them one more try, maybe today was an off day, but the differences were like night and day... I want the tacos I had in March back! :(",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,2,2QjM8vSX38CWguGaTSEAwA

The kids meals are a steal at $6. Chicken fingers and sweet potato fries are great, they also offer a teriyaki bowl and grilled cheese (which I haven't tried). Another plus - breakfast is served all day.

Being pregnant and constantly trying to provide my baby with nutritious goodness, during a recent trip to Vegas I went on a hunt for a good health food spot. Just as a heads up, this place is quite a drive away from downtown and the strip, so even if you have a car at your disposal, this place isn't quite worth the trek if you're staying in that area. 

I thought the juice was good - fresh and nutritious. I had a wheat grass shot which was also good (or as good as a wheat grass shot could be) and was served up with a slice of orange, which I appreciated. 

The quinoa salad was unfortunately disappointing. To be fair, the girl taking my order told me that the salad is mostly quinoa, but the amount of quinoa compared to the tofu and snap peas was a bit ridiculous and far beyond what I was expecting, even with the warning. This was literally a gigantic bowl of bland quinoa with a sprinkling of everything else on top. I made the mistake of mixing everything together, which just caused me to lose the other salad elements within the quinoa. It's unfortunate, because what I could take from the toppings were actually good, and the salad could have been tasty if the amount of quinoa was cut in half.

The gal behind the counter recommended the sandwich if I liked ""spicy"" food. And I do!

Bacon was perfect but the zinger for me were the rubberized ""roasted"" potatoes. They had clearly met there fate in an oven, at some point, but were reheated in a microwave right before being served to us-BAD MOVE. They lacked any flavor or bite to them.

I ordered two things, first I got the caesar salad because I used to always enjoy the Caesar wrap on the lavash, being that they no longer had that I guess a salad was the next best thing. I got my salad with rotisserie instead, I don't like cold chicken with any salad doesn't seem quiet fresh. It was a TOTALLY over priced salad, hardly had any dressing and no croutons!!! Just lettuce cheese and mediocre tasting chicken with fat on it. Wouldn't eat that again ever. I also ordered the chicken gouda wrap, with the Chimichurri sauce, that tasted fresh but I the sauce tasted nothing like chimichurri! The wrap had such  a  weird flavor and it was sweet with no delicious flavors , along with it being super wet . Just didn't do anything for me. I hope the food gets better because the menu seems all over the place and over priced for what I received. I was so disappointed! :(

I had the Organic Breakfast, which comes with scrambled eggs, heirloom tomatoes, and turkey bacon. It was simply delicious. I am not a huge fan or turkey bacon but this was wide cut and really good. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and not over or under cooked. Tomatoes were tricolored for a nice variety. My wife had the free steelcut oatmeal from our coupon but added strawberries and bananas.

We ordered these sides, which were of decent portion:

Creamy mac n cheese: bland. Looked SO appealing as she placed it on the table... creamy and topped with crispy bread crumbs but even my 7 year old turned it down! Serious lack of flavor here...

Crispy Brussel sprouts: crispy, yes. but just okay. 

Quinoa Broccoli crunch: not much quinoa, and the dressing was so sweet and over powering. It reminded me of the pre mix broccoli salads my grandmother buys at Costco lol we barely touched it.

Watermelon salad: how on earth do you mess this up? There was maybe half of a tangerine and 3 cuts of cucumber along with very little sliced apple. These things I can look past. But what I couldn't understand what what it was they must've either soaked the fruit in or topped it with that tasted like juice... artificially flavored or extra sweetened juice. Just leave watermelon alone.

Sweet potato fries: these were good. But they're fries. 

We also ordered a ""chicken, egg & avocado wrap"" that we all agreed was bland. Even though it says there is salsa verde there was very little and I couldn't even taste it. The tortilla was good....

& their signature green juice, which isn't shown on the menu and something I had to ask for specifically. They should promote their juices! Anyways, it was just okay.

Overall, I'm disappointed and will most likely opt for lunch worth my $50 spent today. Maybe their rotisserie chicken keeps the doors open but we didn't order that.",TfofCo_xEwY4am19d8lGYw,1,1,2,xVExXPivw9BP6Q0iSwCuVA
3073313,2013-08-17,2,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"Congratulations! You've successfully served me the worst sandwich I've ever had in my life. You also coupled it with really bad service. Thumbs down, way down.

I'm all about health and fitness, but this was hands down the worst meal I've ever had out, taste-wise. We were so repulsed by the food that we contemplated asking for a refund. Let me add that we're the least difficult people ever--we've both been servers before and appreciate people in the customer service industry. This was just one of those things that we wish we could un-eat.

We got some sort of wrap and salmon burger (I posted it in the gallery--don't be fooled, we made it look way better in the picture than it actually is). The wrap was okay, if I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10 it would be around a 4. The tortilla was kind of hard and dry, but the inside was edible. The salmon burger, however, I would give a negative rating to if I could. The bread was stale, dry, and overtook the burger with just a tiny little pathetic piece of salmon (which was also dry and flavorless) in between. The sweet potato fries were cold and soggy. If you look at the picture and read my description, you will see that there is barely any salmon in the burger. And again, we took a good ""foodie"" picture that made it look way better than it was.

Let me also just add that it took FOREVER for us to get our food. It wasn't even busy, the girls working there seemed really poorly trained because my boyfriend mentioned they were yelling back and forth between the kitchen for messed up orders. Fine, if they were nice about it. They were not. This place will not be our choice to stop by, ever again (shame, cause I'm local).",IfgOJxjRPDTIJnXDfRUZKw,3,0,1,sGfMVFQgqpk96RNc1qLdAg

3195296,2014-07-22,2,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"Came here for a late lunch with my husband and was impressed with the decor of the place- it looks so welcoming. I particularly like how they designed the store, clean menu on the board and clean environment, with loads of green and healthy colors. Love it! And that's pretty much the only thing I like about this place. That and the friendly customer service here.

That being said, it is a food place after all, so my review is based solely on the food that I've received. My husband ordered the Mediterranean wrap with sweet potato fries and I got the Soba Noodle salad with grilled chicken.

Let's start with my soba noodle salad. First of all, the grilled chicken (which I paid an extra $3 for) is dry and there's hardly any taste to it. The soba noodle salad has hardly any dressing on it - it's basically warm egg noodles on top of a bed of spinach and asparagus, with sliced avocados. The noodles weren't even mixed in properly with the rest of the bowl- it's just a lump of dry noodles on top of vegetables. Oh, and there's some soba dressing at the bottom of my bowl, which is just mediocre light soy sauce. There is hardly any taste to my meal, and I had to mix in some condiments I found on the drinks counter to give it a little more taste. And this costs me $10.95 (not including the grilled chicken for $3)! Are you kidding me? I totally felt ripped off. 

I know this place is supposed to serve food that is good for your health and overall wellness, but I don't think that meant serving half-hearted meals that are dry and tasteless. Coming from LA, I've been to enough places that focuses on serving food that is healthy and good for you (and they are really good by the way!), and this is by far, the worst that I've had.

My husband's mediterranean wrap is soggy and tastes mediocre. The sweet potato fries is probably the best thing we have, and I hardly think that's a compliment.

Unless the food improves, we won't be back. Sorry.",LMJKMZOEiQpWNMBT2G2t_A,4,2,1,9J2oxiJcwOWRH6hh18OcLQ

They were packaged. I replied with oh, they're not made here? All I got was a shrug. I started reading the package and I noticed on each of the three kind of kale chips they had each one had cashews in them. I must have told the girls of my nut allergy at least 3 times in this brief conversation. When I informed her of the cashews she said oh I didn't know that was a nut. Smh... I said ok what else can I have in place of these. She said the glutino gluten free pretzles. The kind you can get at whole foods for about $3-$4. They were charging $7.

I ordered the Vegas Bowl acai. It was amazing, and close enough to the acai bowl the Cove girls in Hawaii make. It was made with honey, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, banana, greek yogurt, and granola. It was super refreshing and had that nice thick, smoothie-like consistency to it. (As much as I love Juice 'N' Go's acai drink..I just love my acai bowls thick and smoothie-like, not in a liquid, juice-like consistency.) The greek yogurt is definitely a good twist to it to even out the sweetness of the bowl. It had just enough honey in there too (although you can never have too much honey in your acai bowl.)

I can't wait to go back to try their other menu items. The pan seared ahi tuna taco looks so fresh and maze-balls! Also the spicy thai chicken wrap.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,0,5,hipv2MRWjBLxADrk0_n27w

We ordered two DK Açaí bowls at the counter with two coffees to start our day. Our DK Açaí (ah-sigh-EE) Bowls were served with a generous amount of granola, sliced bananas, sliced strawberries, sliced kiwi, blueberries, coconut flakes, bee pollen, and a drizzle of honey. They're served all day (per the menu) so you can get your fix all hours of the day. 

Açaí Bowls are one of my favorite things to eat in the morning. It's basically a smoothie in bowl that can be topped with anything you'd like. It's a delicious way to start your day with antioxidants, fiber, heart healthy fats, and minerals (think of it as a ""Beast Mode"" breakfast). We enjoyed our bowls and the lady who helped us at the counter was super sweet. 

DKME&R has undergone an update since my last visit. It gave me total Palm Springs juice bar vibes through their newly updated and modern decor. We soaked in the sun and sipped on our coffees while we enjoyed the chill atmosphere as our bowls were being prepared. We glanced over the menu and noticed they offer Frozen Greek Yogurt and Rotisserie Chicken specials. We will be stopping back to try those options out in the near future.

3844404,2014-11-18,0,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"Came here for a post workout brunch and got what I expected: somewhat blan health food. 

Don't get me wrong, the presentation on the plate was nice and the food was decent, but it is definitely nothing to write home about.

I got the Spicy Thai Chicken wrap, of which was decent. The tortilla was somewhat dry and the wrap didn't have enough dressing. I had to go back up and get some more dressing which made the wrap taste a lot better.

We had 5 people in our party who ordered food and each tray came out individually. Of course mine came out last, so by the time I started on my food the first person had already finished their meal. 

The one thing that they do have here that is REALLY GOOD is their acai bowl. 

Would I recommend this place? Probably not. Would I recommend against it? Probably not. It's perfect if you're nearby and looking for a healthy alternative, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",wt57fkTOcSCYNb2fNAOlyg,2,1,3,0gr9z6FnQoa1AEAZ3c5aAQ

Staff... when I mentioned the juice not being fresh the girl was super rude and ignored me... said a few words and gave me bad attitude. The young man that took the rest of my order was very nice and understanding.  The men behind the counter are always usually great with customer service...some of the women not so much.

Sandwiches, wraps, and burgers come with a choice of sweet potato fries, fruit, or mixed green salad.  I took the healthy choice by getting the sweet potato fries.

4072565,2017-03-02,0,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"MORNING FARMER WRAP: 5 stars!
INCONSISTENT SERVICE & SPEED: 2 stars!

I am a healthy eater.  Krayvings, Bowlology, Lifetime Cafe, Rache's Kitchen, Greens and Proteins are my restaurants of choice.  When I am in the US for months at a stretch, I eat out at any of these establishments on the westside of town at least once a day, if not twice.  I do not cook.  So happy to have any of the aformentioned spots do it for me. 

From Rachel's Kitchen, to whatever other restaurants this location has been over the years, I was happy to see another healthy, good cooking option to add to my list when I spotted the Daily Kitchen Modern Eatery & Rotisserie. 

I have been in here a half dozen times and always ""to go"".  The space is small, yet classy, farm to kitchen feel and welcoming.  I am a pescaterian (to include eggs), so this narrows down a menu real quick.  I find myself to be an expert of breakfast wraps and it is kind of my bar to determine a restaurants worth.  As such, note that the Morning Farmer Wrap (available at any time, not just breakfast) is excellent.  Maybe one of the best I have ever had.  It has the freshness.  It has a colorful array of ingredients to make it look great.  It is not greasy, or held together with a sauce that does not fit or have watery eggs that then kind of make the wrap itself soggy.  It really is an excellent egg wrap...again, I am kind of an expert. 

But Daily Kitchen Modern Eatery gets only a 3 from me (and really barely a 3) because of service and speed.  There is a nice girl working behind the counter on most days during the odd hours that I might pop in who is nothing but exceptionally sweet, kind, welcoming.  But is seems with about a 50% consistency, if I walk in there during any remote peak time, it is going to take 30 minutes to get out the door...with my one meal item.  

With so many options in Summerlin, I kind of think despite the great Morning Farmer Wrap, I will not be back.  Life is short and I do not have time for inconsistency or wait times that are excessive.  When I went in this past Tuesday night, I walked in a 7:12pm (my receipt says so), I ordered right away the kale salad with albacore tuna instead and I walked out at 7:41pm with my salad.  Shockingly, despite it being fresh, the salad was exceptionally small, cold and the tuna was room temperature...so why the 30 minutes to get it to me is a conundrum?  This is not some food item that has a long prep time. 

They seem to do a large on-line ordering business, which tends to be in my opinion where the delays begin to start.  I don't think the delays are coming out the kitchen, but rather in the chaos of all that is going on directly behind the ordering counter.  Because when I am looking at the guys in the kitchen who seem to be all caught up, but I am still standing and waiting, looking at like a dozen to-go bags on the counter (where mine is lost in the mix, I think), this is kind of a restaurant killer for me.  And then no staff acknowledging the delay and simply saying ""Hey, our apologies for the delay.  Thanks for coming in, we promise to do better the next time.""  No acknowledgement of the delay makes it worse.  

I have said it countless times on Yelp...I hate it when as great spot becomes dead to me because of customer service or tiny screw ups like this.  Being and showing appreciation to a customer goes a long way.  Life is short...I have other options in Summerlin where I can spend my dollars on a healthy meal in half the time.  I will dream of the Morning Farmer Wrap though.  It was nice to have made its acquaitance for a limited time.",QGtuYyH2w_R1r-X5BGmgzw,3,1,3,8u6duWj7c5vZ1h0zcicLNg

The walls are lined with diagrams of plants and little facts about food. The lighting fixtures are unique and add a nice touch of comfort without being overly bright. A+ for ambiance!

For food, I ordered the DK Pasta which is wheat rigatoni with grilled chicken, Japanese eggplant, cherry tomatoes, micro arugula all in a light tomato sauce topped with pecorino romano cheese. This Plate of food was fantastic! Fresh, not heavy on the sauce, and the touch of pecorino on top was perfect! The dish was perfectly portioned, and after eating it you have the ""i feel full, but in a good way"" feeling. Love that feeling!!!

My wife ordered the DK Chicken Sandwich which was made with roasted chicken, grapes, celery, pecans, Greek yogurt and arugula all on whole grain bread. She wasn't as much of a fan as she originally thought she would be. It was an odd choice for her, but figuring we were eating at a new, exciting spot, she figured, why not? Lets just say she finished my pasta and we took the sandwich to go. 

We also had their soup special of the day which was the Southwestern Veggie Soup which was made with black beans, roasted corn, onion, and carrots topped with tortilla strips and jack cheese. We were fooled into thinking the tortilla strips were going to add that perfect textural contrast, but... they did not. They were more like whole wheat tortilla pieces, laying on top of the soup, bathing. Not soggy, just flimsy and blah. The soup had good flavors, but didn't knock our socks off.

For this to be so close to our house and us not visit would be a disservice to ourselves. This place will definitely be seeing much more of the Hurley family in the near future. Thanks Sarah for making us feel so welcome!",2iu0ciezoxRVlwI7llgicQ,0,0,4,Muv7tJArTGwbKpTScRIAcQ

Today I wanted a lighter lunch so I went with the Mediterranean salad - holy salt. So much salt. I love lemons, capers and olives all individually but together in a salad made it taste like I was eating a bag of lemon Warheads...not so great.

In the past I've ordered burgers and Acai bowls and they're not bad at all. It's always nice to find a healthy place that's reasonably priced too.

Daily Kitchen and Wellness Bar is one of them. The first thing I noticed is, wow - this place is tiny! Probably the same size as my living room. It is probably one of the smallest places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. At least there is room to eat outside if the place ever gets full (note: there are no misters). 

I ordered the Spicy Thai Chicken Wrap. It was just OK. The ingredients seemed fresh. Lacked a little in the seasoning department. I didn't really taste much the Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce - perhaps if they used a little more of it, it wouldn't taste so plain. Was it worth the almost $10 they charge for this wrap? I didn't think so. My partner's wrap, on the other hand, was tasty. She had the Mediterranean Wrap. It had me thinking about falafels the whole day! I didn't order any of the fresh juices, but did notice that the price is a bit higher than the ""other"" place.

5100365,2013-05-06,1,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"If the name sounds familiar but doesn't ring a bell, Daily Kitchen & Wellness occupies the former Rachel's Kitchen space. They're part of the LEV Restaurant Group who is responsible for the opening of I  Burgers, Lobster Me, and many of the CBTLs and Jamba Juices in the Vegas valley. They've also announced their plans to expand DK and CBTL into the under-construction Downtown Grand. 

It's always a pleasant surprise to find healthy food that doesn't resemble a pile of raw vegetables. Post workout, my BFF Tida C. introduced me to this healthy (and totally post-workout appropriate) spot to eat and drink clean after a sesh at LVAC guilt-free. While I can only vouch for the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the juices, I wouldn't be surprised if I made this a regular stop. Little else really stood out to me on the menu. Most of it sounded like something I make at home: egg scrambles, kale salads, chicken wraps--you catch my drift.

Being relatively healthful with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options and also located in a most likely very expensive Summerlin stripmall, prices are a little up there. Not to say DK will break the bank, but you can expect to spend $10-15 on food alone. They have a menu of fresh made-to-order juices like the Harmony (cucumber, kale, spinach, apple & lemon juice) and the Restore (apple, beet, carrot, lemon) that are $7. They're pretty delicious so I wouldn't skip them! If you order like I do you'll ring up a tab around $20. My combo of choice is the Ahi Tuna Tacos ($12.95 for 3): 2 fairly large slices of seared ahi, a slaw of pickled daikon and carrots, micro cilantro, avocado,and creamy ponzu sauce wrapped in wonderfully soft whole wheat tortillas.

Heck, I once answered the question, ""If you could only eat one thing for the rest of the life, what would it be?"" with ""Broccoli."" I admire Daily Kitchen for bringing a little spot of healthiness to the Westside, a spot where you don't have to wonder if they have whole wheat bread. In fact, everything comes on whole wheat! 

However, our dishes were simply underwhelming. I was filled with anticipation for their black bean burger, but I was let down. The patty has promise, but it is very thin and overpowered by a whopping, thick whole wheat bun (ironic). The bun isn't toasty and delicious; it is simply big and prevented me from really tasting whatever else was happening in between. The side salad was meager and underdressed. The burger came recommended, and I think with a thicker patty and a different bun, it could live up to its potential. However, when I had it, I felt as if I was eating a bun.

I sampled my husband's turkey meatball sub, and it too suffered from more bread than fillings as well. They have a fresh juice selection, but I didn't sample any on our visit.

I really liked it but, I can agree with Misti Y re: the bread being a bit overwhelming. I have not had it in two+ months, but, I don't remember the patty being thin. I thought it was a good thickness and enjoyed the aioli-red pepper, the vegetable (not spicey red pepper flakes). The next time, maybe about a month ago, I wanted to venture out so, I tried the grilled veggie wrap w/ sweet potato fries. It was good, could really taste the freshness of the grilled veggies and the wrap as a whole was not slippy and slimy with veggies falling out like at Rachel's Kitchen. However, for the record, Baguette Cafe makes the best vegetarian sandwiches and wraps, IMO, but Daily Kitchen is closer to my house and better for drive-bys. 

Now, I really ventured out and was super impressed with the kale salad that I had just a few days ago. It had a lot of my favorite things so gave it a whirl - avocado, pine nuts, dried cranberries, a really light citrus vinegarette with a mound of massaged kale. Yummy! So, yummy, I stopped at Whole Foods and bought all the ingredients so, I could make it at home...and I do not consider myself a salad person but kale is a super food and I am trying to step out of my comfort zone.

The menu is pretty basic but large. They have breakfast options that they serve all day, along with healthy salads, acai bowls, whole wheat lavash wraps, etc. Everything on the menu is designed with health in mind. Now healthy doesn't always equate to low calorie, but at least you know you're getting something nutritious made from whole non-processed foods.

We came for breakfast so breakfast it was. I ordered the Farmer's Omelet: 3 organic brown eggs, spinach, turkey sausage and goat cheese $9.95. The bf ordered the  Healthy Oatmeal Pancakes with chocolate chips $6.95 and a shot of wheat grass. The food took a little bit to prepare but was worth the wait, it was delicious!! There were so many other things that caught my eye. I really want to come back and try an Acai bowl for sure!

The staff is really pleasant and friendly, they seemed sincere in helping us vs. just going through the motions. The atmosphere is not fabulous it reminds me of a Jamba Juice sort of feel - but the place is clean and really that's all that matters.

5620849,2013-05-26,2,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"It's been almost a year since I've been to DK, mainly because I frequent Juice n Go now for my acai bowl fixes.  I used to think that DK's acai bowl was the best in town, but that was last year.  Since then, the price has gone up and it's not as good as i remember.  I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by the old stomping grounds, but, sad to say, I was disappointed. I can tell things have changed because the picture I took in 2012 of the acai bowl is totally different than the 2013 version. $8.95 for a bowl that didn't even come with granola, a staple ingredient in acai bowls.  Is this the way it always was? I know it wasn't.  Customers can choose three items from an ingredient list to create their acai bowls and granola is one of the items--huh?  I guess I'm just used to a traditional bowl having strawberries, bananas, granola, and coconut, as served at Juice N Go and Rachel's Kitchen.  The price is too steep for me to be back, but now I know.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,4,3,3,W5IRdG4eneTe4IRgt9FG0g

I just got home with my small salad (see photo with La Croix for scale, this salad is tiny for the price) and side of sweet potato fries only to find a giant bone and a piece of plastic in my food. I chomped down on the bone and almost swallowed the plastic. I mean, that's just unacceptable, agreed? I'm over Daily Kitchen. $20 for a tiny salad and sweet potato fries and then I get to almost choke on a bone and some random plastic? No thanks.",ozPXLw6rdip1jgS9Co5c4A,1,0,2,lVaAPDSGwkFvdUiuaqfRNg

I get some people liked the old menu and are not embracing the change but I think it's fabulous! My third time here since reopening. This time I tried the rotisserie chicken with the Brussels sprouts and omg the chicken is so tender and full of flavor. I put their chimichuri sauce on it and I melted.

This cute eatery is clean and fresh, it makes me want to eat clean and healthy!

I have a couple of favorites that I always order, the grilled chicken sandwich, turkey avocado wrap, turkey burger, and for my morning start I get the dragon bowl (pitaya).

The staff is sweet and caring here, this is a family vibe that makes for a nice visit. I avoid ""Corporate"" settings for eateries as the quality lacks. 

I am a fan of the multiple options there are for gluten free, although I am not 100% a gluten free eater, I do have some picky friends when it comes to that lifestyle. So if they are satisfied than I know this place is cool.

My last visit I tried the ""rise and shine"" quesadilla and it was REALLY good.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,6,7,5,QFKDxEVX__m0WLWqP0a9Sw

This is probably a better place to sit (inside or out) than to grab a to-go order. The selection of sandwiches is not great and I decided on a chicken salad. It is really a chicken salad, plate style, stuffed into bread. It was a good sandwich but not really suitable for eating in the car. Yes, I know I should not be eating in the car but sometimes needs must. I ordered a berry shake and the sandwich came with a side of fruit. It was definitely good but as I paid $18 it should be outstanding. My opinion, too mush $$ for a sandwich.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,0,0,3,jV4-u29zsyFweEt_1gE1qg

5924329,2017-09-06,1,YCEZLECK9IToE8Mysorbhw,"I really enjoy Daily Kitchen, above all for their keto/paleo-friendly options that actually have flavor and substance. My favorite thing to get is the 1/4 lb dark meat chicken with roasted Brussels sprouts & curried cauliflower as my two sides. I'm not the biggest fan of sweet potatoes, but their sweet potato fry side is pretty good, too. There are several other options for sides, depending on your likes or limits. Instead of the 1/4 dark meat, you can get light meat or tri-tip instead. The real winner is their lemon chimichurri sauce, which I put copious amounts of on everything (no, seriously).

Times when I was not eating keto or paleo, I did try a couple of their breakfast items. They were decent, but didn't blow me away. I'd still eat them again, though. A couple come with pesto sauce, and the pesto is very tasty and worth getting extra of (can you tell I like sauce?).

At some point I'll go back & try their other stuff, but for now their rotisserie plates are enough to keep me happy & coming back!",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,1,4,AvOf4cjSDhrRF5EaSov4yw

The servers were rude. Not a single smile and we felt rushed even tho it was TOTALLY empty. We sent back a dish that was meant to be hot and it was like it came right out of the fridge and the cooks took it personally. Not worth coming here.

If you want good natural organic food in a hurry this is the place. Just like Echo & Rig their Brussel sprouts are so yummy!   My husband and I so far have tried the veggie wrap, kale salad, Mary's roasted chicken(oh so juicy and tender), Brussel sprouts and the spicy steak sandwich. Can't wait to try the frozen yogurt with the olive oil and sea salt. Sounds so different.  Was too full after the chicken today. Staff very friendly and accommodating.

I hate to do this but for the past several months my beloved Cobb salad has really gone down hill. I kept ordering thinking it would be back to normal. 
1.  Menu says butter lettuce and romaine. Now only ice berg.  So much less ingredients. And it's says heirloom tomatoes.  Guess what you get cherry tomatoes.  And when we ordered it with chicken it was very moist and tasty before. Ordered it a couple of times recently and it has been dry left over chicken. 
2. We ordered the chicken pesto sandwich. Got it home and the chicken was barely 1 oz dried out and looked like left overs.  For 10 bucks what a waste for a roll pretty much. 
3. Portion on the sides are way down which we noticed before but didn't know why. 

Previously the chicken was so good and moist. 
We called and the Mgr was very apologetic and said next time was on them.

We will keep trying

I think it is under management or ownership? Therefore affecting the quality",Ftaf9O_MtDwf7CY1eY1myQ,0,0,2,9LfMoarp4e1f2K2LRzjTaw
