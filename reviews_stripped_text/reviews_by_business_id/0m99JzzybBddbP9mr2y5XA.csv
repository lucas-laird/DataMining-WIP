I love chicken shack, I love everything about it, the food, the service, the location.  Food is awesome as usual, there were some new tech equipment they were using, which I thought was an amazing feature.  The food was more delayed than I would like it, but in all honesty they've been open for a week, it takes time to get to that awesome status, which is why a star is missing.  I know I'll be rewriting this eventually with five stars and hearts everywhere, but for now the kinks need to be sorted out with that.  Actually all my stars really go to the service.  There were hiccups and delays, but Jamie was so sweet and apologetic, she was able to help me carry my order because I had my infant, and let me know why it was delayed with great explanation.  That alone, is what makes this place have a minimum of three stars.  Customer service is such a big part of this industry, it can make someone smile to having the most infuriating person ever.  Jamie was so amazing and if all the employees are as sincere as she is, then there's no doubt this location will be the best!",bOHx6q63sD0jhtV3CLolhA,1,0,4,nsjRDzP8C3wLSPpDdYl3iw

1993581,2018-05-29,5,0m99JzzybBddbP9mr2y5XA,"So many sauces, so little time! There's a truly huge selection of sauces for tossing or dipping your wings, strips, and fries, so you can change up your order every time. Some of my favorites are the Jamaican Jerk, Hot Honey Garlic, and Creamy Garlic Parm. They also offer spicy versions of their house-made ranch and blue cheese dressings, to kick things up a level.

This location recently opened and is clear across town from me, but has been consistently clean with friendly staff across a couple of visits. I prefer the huge, meaty fingers over the crispy, juicy wings, but they also offer salads, sandwiches, burgers, and a surprisingly good bowl of chili. My go-to is the #4 combo (wings and fingers) with their skinny, salty fries to complement the spicy sauces I get. 

TIP: Order online through the Yelp app so you can grab on the go!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,11,4,burCLuP9fzFgj7JFnoFy8A

Honestly, I've only ever had the wings and fries at their locations, so my review can only be based on those items. 

The chicken is ALWAYS fresh and hot. It's always cooked properly and you always have enough dipping sauce. The fries are OK, but the place isn't called Fry Shack....

The staff is friendly and helpful. They always seem to have smiles on their faces!!

2581247,2018-05-10,0,0m99JzzybBddbP9mr2y5XA,This review is for the Chicken Shack off of St. Rose Parkway and Spencer. I've eaten here twice and to be honest the next time I'll only order the chicken. The chicken is definitely better than Canes. The fries are way too salty. If you have hypertension this is not the place for you. I normally like a little extra salt on my food but this was too much salt for a salt lover like me. My family and I ordered combos with fries and none of us ate the fries. We tried wiping the salt off but that didn't help. The chicken is similar to Canes but with more chicken. :-),D14Cva_AOyyBab1hPXkALw,0,0,3,JY0ZD_f5N_lOlgHFDY0S9w

Great place to stop in if you are getting your oil changed or a car washed nearby.
Go with the chicken. Garlic flavors are great-garlic parm and honey garlic are perfect. Shoestring fries get high praise from me too. Just all around exactly what you want from a wing joint.

Thinking that it was just another ordinary wings place, I tried and stepped in the bright yellow and metal interior decor.
I order the #3 with 3 fingers and fries and my sister had the chicken wings. The fries were crisp and abundant. Not oily and was actual cut potatoes not the frozen stuff. The fingers were not dry underneath the batter which made me not even need to dip in in the honey habanero sauce. Which was amazing by the way.
My sisters wings was a bit too much batter because it overwhelmed the actual meat. But overall it was a good amount as well for the price. 
I would definitely be going back to try the other menu items on a non hungover day. Thanks Chicken shack for being so close to the house!",yEgCccqud_wxcWK-8H72GA,3,2,4,HXz1Z9yS5l5LG9MpjPyXig

I have eaten at all the Chicken Shacks all over Vegas. FINALLY one opened next to my home. The first time I ate there, I thought the chicken was off. It was exactly the same issue the second time. 

The chicken taste like someone is adding TONS of SALT to their chicken.  I have asked other friends who have tried it and they all say the same thing. Chicken and Fries are just overloaded with salt and they all refuse to go back to this location.

Some bites of the chicken are crispy and tasting. Other bites taste like a salt pellet has been inserted into the chicken.

This location DOES NOT follow the Chicken Shack standards. I am telling everyone I know to post here in hopes that the Owner sees what is going on.

Change your ways, or I will not ever go back to this location and will tell everyone I know to avoid this place.

I would rather go across the street to Canes and get a better value and not be overloaded with salt.
