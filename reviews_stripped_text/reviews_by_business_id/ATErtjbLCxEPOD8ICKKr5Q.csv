It seems like they have cut back on the quality of everything.  The fish wasn't as good, they are using a lot less rice, and they even got cheap on the plates.  Seriously, they were round off-white buffet style plates about 10"" in diameter with the two inch raised borders.  To make it work, they had to cram all of the sushi into  the center of the plates.  I guess they are saving on dishwashing costs too, they don't need to handwash any of these plates.",mfnxbESnhpMzZdcsRQMyfg,0,0,2,YGPjJRUwBAGwDqBGUE0zPQ

But they don't follow that rule. As long as u eat everything that u order u can stay as long as u want. So take it easy. Relax and order a few things at a time. I suggest take advantage of the appetizers n nigiri sushi. 

If ur not too hungry, order the ocean paradise!! It's close to heaven!!!! If u love mango n a bit of spicyness go for the super salmon!! Those 2 r my favorite!! Check it out!!!


Ooh n ecstasy for appetizers!!! Yummy


I posted pics of the menu!!

The fish was fresh but the presentation was very poor.  Most of the excellent sushi chefs take alot of pride in their food.  This is not the case here.  Sushi rolls were very poorly made and the presentation was very poor.  We arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm. The sushi bar was empty.  We were not welcomed immediately by the sushi chefs.  We actually had to ask them twice if they were open.  Rolls were okay tasting but again, the rolls were falling apart.  The quality is not consistent with prices that they charge.  could also be another reason, why it was empty on a Saturday night.  We did speak with the manager and she apologized and took off one of the rolls but it seems that they do not seem to care.  Not worth it.  Grocery stores have better sushi. (we did tip the server, the presentation and lack of caring about their food was not his fault)",Ql0LPk8wwgP3Hc7hJR4q4w,0,0,1,Yw5MTPM3lDIK1u28MhrMGA

I was introduced this week by a friend and ended up opting not for the AYCE sushi and was delighted both by the atmosphere, food and service.  I enjoyed the free meal so much, I decided to go back the next night to celebrate my girlfriends birthday, this time, deciding on the AYCE option.

We started off with ehe appetizer Ecstasy which is Japanese Radish and Tuna in a blossom design, resting in sauce with mayo.  It is an expensive app and I was surprised to see it on the AYCE menu, but you have to try this.  The artistry alone is awesome, but the taste is even better.

Over the next hour we killed a variety of rolls and sashimi (yellowtail, salmon and albacore - it was melt in your mouth).  The service was great, Cesar taking the lead but the others pitching in and team serving was fantastic.  There is a limit of one hour for the AYE menu, but with the team service, we never waited more than a few moments.  

The food itslelf was fantastic, fresh, no off tastes or odors.  The rice was superb and the sauces were amazing.  This was my first AYCE and I plan on making this MY sushi joint.

Make sure to take care of the staff, and bring all of your friends.  You will not be disappointed.",8jUwFWVyd5qse8Id6WP3lA,1,1,5,Cc_ZK5Gcx4Iqu369c8ukVA

The atmosphere is very modern and chic, relaxing but also fun. The service is always fast and friendly. Folks need to avoid the rush times however, if you're not willing to wait. I find the best times to go are in the afternoons (weekdays and even on weekends). If you do plan to go in the evening, make sure to be at the restaurant when they open for dinner so you don't have to wait.

2252055,2013-09-22,0,ATErtjbLCxEPOD8ICKKr5Q,"I have to say I am really disappointed and unimpressed.  

This sushi place is located inside of the Green Valley Resort.  You would think that being touted as a high end sushi place things would be better run. 

My hubs and I went on a Friday night, we debated between Sushi and Chinese food and choose sushi as the Chinese restaurant was dead. Usually a tell tale sign. 

We asked to sit at the sushi bar as we normally get to interact with  our sushi chef.  Not true here let me tell ya.  
Moving on, we waited 10 mins before we were even acknowledged by a waitress and not until after that by a sushi chef.  To start of us, i ordered a Blueberry martini and a hot tea, my hubs just a simple coke no ice.  We were brought out our drinks, umm, i got a water with no martini is site. After another 10 minutes a sushi chef finally asks us if we would like something.  My hubs orders a roll and the guy just walks away, not even asking if i want anything or acknowledging me sitting there.  The hubs had to go ""excuse"" quite a few times before the sushi chef would even look up again.  This place is not noisy, only about 4 other couples in the place.  But I did get to put my order in.  Yeah!  During this whole space of time, we had not seen our waitress once.  Now there are two working the place and we are seeing the other lovely girl who is working her half of the restaurant, taking drinks, conversing etc.  Our waitress, Brandi, i was looking around at the other table besides us and they are looking at me just raising there shoulders going ""i don't know"".   She finally reappears after my hubs gets his two rolls and I get my tuna and salmon sashimi.  We had been there a good 25-30 mins and she brings out my martini.  My water glass is empty and so is my husbands soda, does she offer to fill anything or ask if we need anything else?  Nopers.  We actually had to ask the other waitress for dishes to poor our soy sauce into. 

Now the food itself, it was good.  My sashimi was really thick cuts of salmon and tuna.  My husbands spicy crab roll and his ginza roll were pretty good.  That ginza roll was actually the best thing ever.  It was so heavy and so tasty.  Warm crab with a kick. :) Really big rolls too.  My hubs was happy and like is said my sashimi was thick GOOD cuts of fish.  It was nummy. 

We get through our meal and she is standing at the other end of the sushi bar chatting about her child with the hostess.  She has no other tables but us.  We try several times to get her attention so we can get our bill.  This takes another 5 minutes until I just stand up and ask for it.  I am not someone who makes a scene or even really gets outwardly cranky so please don't think i was rushing up on her.  I politely asked for our check. It was the most attentive she was all night.  

I have to say, the pricey price tag and the lack of service have caused to really give this place a big old thumbs down.  Go to your neighborhood sushi spot instead of this one.",TaCOXUciTuTDbyMGZfWZ0Q,1,0,2,lsHrVGWlSfTwHVg8ivbCug
2274875,2014-04-26,0,ATErtjbLCxEPOD8ICKKr5Q,"I don't know if it was because I hadn't had Japanese food in awhile or if it was because I was tired of eating the same food every day, but Sushi + Sake was great!

During my stay in Las Vegas, I usually stay at the Tropicana, which sadly only has three restaurants to choose from (steakhouse, Italian and a cafe with various cuisines), so eating there can get quite boring. One night my grandma wanted to get Asian food, preferably Japanese. They used to stay at Green Valley Ranch years ago and knew that Sushi + Sake had a great Japanese restaurant, so we decided to visit hoping they still had the amazing dishes they enjoyed many years ago. Luckily, they did!

My grandparents both LOVE their deep fried soft-shell crab (watari kani)! I was hesitant to try it, but my grandma talked me into it and I'm so glad she did because it was amazing! So crispy and perfect with the ponzu sauce, I understand why they wanted to come back here. There is little to no breading around the crab, just a light fry with amazing crisp-ness.

I love my spicy tuna, but sadly no where on the Mainland makes it the same as in Hawaii, but here at Sushi + Sake, it gets pretty close. I was debating between three rolls but ended up choosing the Wet and Wild roll (spicy tuna topped with tuna in a garlic ponzu sauce). The garlic ponzu sauce was delish and the sushi roll itself was good enough for me, amazing even! The closest to home I have found so far! 

My grandma got the unagi don, which had HUGE fillets of unagi, which she had a hard time finishing. My grandpa got the chirashi, which according to my grandma had less fish than she remembered. But both were happy with their dishes.

I also ordered chicken dumplings thinking they were going to be gyoza, but sadly they were like Chinese shumai. Kind of regret getting them because they were nothing special at all, very disappointed. 

The service here was great as well. We had a server who, I don't know how she knew but, could tell we were from Hawaii and explained she was from Hawaii too. She was very attentive and gave me extra otoshi, which was yummy!

I really wish my grandparents still stayed at Green Valley Ranch so I could enjoy this restaurant more often, but I'm sure during our next visit we'll come back to Sushi + Sake!",CZK0546ReLX0dhA-Aw6cdA,2,3,4,LfDY1atStrzb0JeWfvywqA

Remembered there was a sushi joint right inside of the casino. Dragged boyfriend downstairs and into Sushi & Sake. Place rocked! First off: Cute atmosphere. Fish tank for the backdrop, small clusters of tables and intimate seating areas. We sat right up front by the sushi bar and were able to see the chefs preparing our meal, which was fun. Service starts out with a delicious cucumber salad, and arrives almost as soon as you take your seat. Upon chatting with the owner we discovered he too was a fellow Bay Arean and moved out to Las Vegas to open up his own restaurant. Really neat guy. Friendly, but not overly friendly, just the right sense of humor that left you wanting to talk to him more as soon as he disappeared. We felt very welcome here and the staff took many pictures of me and the boyfriend without us even asking. The sushi was great and the veggie and shrimp tempura was actually some of the best I've ever had. Boyfriend stuck with fried rice which was out of this world. Super fresh, unlike fried rice at other restaurants and it tasted healthier but without losing the essence of what fried rice should be! No complaints! Two thumbs way up!

We are here to review that Sushi+Sake is on our top 90% of all Sushi restaurants.  Our basis is for this assessment is from dining at a lot of sushi places throughout the world.

The various fish on the day we sat down were fresh and tasted like the fishes that they were supposed to be.  How many of us have eaten Hamachi that just did not have that texture and flavor? Or that snapper that did not have any flavor?  There is not much to sushi or sashimi. Freshness, temperature, textures, the rice, vinegarrete, seaweed...

We spent a few days at GVR attending my wife's California Cake Club convention.  Sushi Sake was not on our original radar in as far as a sushi place.  I eaten at some of the most exclusive sushi establishments in Los Angeles (Yakuza run), Beverly Hills and  movie industry parties. Japan has some of the very best establishments. While Sushi Sake does not rate in the top 95 percentile due to temperature or extreme freshness or using less than the top grade of rice, we rate it overall as one of the best values and flavors in Henderson or Las Vegas for that matter.

Eat here and you will not be disappointed. I was pleased that my son convinced me to stay at the hotel and try rather than me calling the cab to drive over to the Aria.  At less than 3 times the cost of going elsewhere for a grade below, you can't lose taking a shot at Sushi Sake inside the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Casino.",bPeW5F6nEMvx7sNPJ3-3sQ,0,0,4,BkQH_6ld1JLzcDzWK3cQGQ
3293483,2010-04-29,1,ATErtjbLCxEPOD8ICKKr5Q,"Sushi + Sake + Spendy Prices

Do yourself a favor and go for the All You Can Eat sushi.  No, not because you're a glutton like me, but because it's simply not worth ordering a-la carte from here.  Everything from the sushi to the sake is pricey, I made the mistake of ordering off the menu with some colleagues and threw down $250 for the 3 of us.  AYCE Sushi night on from Sunday to Thursday at $32.99 per person.  It might be spendier than other AYCE places, but trust me it'll save you more in the long haul.  Experimenting with the menu suddenly becomes easier when the prices are capped.

The restaurant is not the least bit extravagant, which makes it all the more hard to understand why it's so expensive here.  There is not much seating and the space is very open.  From the outside the place looks a very unassuming Japanese joint, lessened by the fact its connected to the casino floor.

Service has been slow at times and our hostess was overly ditsy.  Finding a place for us to sit became a chore and the wait staff didn't seem that accommoodating.  Unless you have a large group, sit at the bar instead.

Opting to sit at the bar allowed me to ignore most of the wait staff while interacting with the sushi chefs, all of which I'm happy to report are Japanese.  Watching them go to work on making the sushi beautiful is truly a work of art.  Our seared toro and wasabi mayo was fantastic, as was the Creamy Mango Salmon / Creamy Scallop.  The salmon was so smooth and the crunchy unagi rolls were delicious.  Aside from the constant foodgasms, each bit of sashimi / sushi was brilliantly presented and made for a fantastic photo op.

I wouldn't think of the Green Valley Ranch to have a little gem like this.  But kudos to management for allowing S+S to satisfy our sushi hunger pangs in Henderson.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,3,2,4,YEI4B6Zo3HuiFefTX4EpCg

(Might I add I have been sick for the past two days and havent eaten anything so needless to say i was STARVING!) Back to the being rushed part, we ordered hot sake for the 3 of us and one of my friends ordered a sopporo (which he couldnt get out that he wanted a large because she was already walking away) we couldnt even ask for water. We didnt get water until the end when i asked for it.

When it came to ordering she told me to check off everything i wanted on the all you can eat menu (which usually i order as i go as not to order too much...) so i did exactly as she told me to do. When she picked up my paper she make the comment, ""thats A LOT of food. Remember no sharing and no left overs."" Im sorry, you are rushing me and you dont know how much food i can put down number one, number two...you dont know how much money i have so if i end up sharing then charge me for it! No need to explain the rules to me or make a rude comment! I was really put off. I understand being busy and feeling rushed, i work at a restaurant where i have 6 tables at a time and believe me even in extreme circumstances i would never make a comment like that to my guests who are leaving me tips. Might i add the two friends i had with me also work at the same restaurant aforementioned. 

ANYWAYS. The food took a look time to hit the table but once it did it was pretty good. I've had better but i've had worse. I think if the server hadnt have rushed us and seemed annoyed for no reason the whole experience would have been better. I was the only person who left her a decent tip since the other two people didnt feel she deserved it.

Instead of seating me while they made up their mind, the hostess stood there as they hmm'd and haaa'd over the menu, clearing not knowing what most of it meant. I didn't write the book on Restauranteur Etiquette but I really feel like she could have sat me as a ""party of 1"" at the bar a lot quicker. 

The chef was polite and the fish was decent. I liked the sake the waitress brought me with my brief description of ""cold, unfiltered, whatever's popular"". I liked the pickled cucumber and crab salad starter. I'm just not sure I'd pay $50 for 5 pieces of sushi again while I had to sit there and listen to overplayed loungey synth'd techno and a shitty cover band in the background. 

Walking back to my room, nowhere near full *oink oink*, I was disappointed that I could've eaten a meal at the steakhouse for the same price.",0vCffWO7AQKdZtoP_9ZTIA,4,4,3,5QkuaE2fZvnGZrzW8PK0jw

I ordered off the menu, it was an avacado and cucumber roll. They charged me for a virgin roll which was 2.00 more than the friggin california roll (which has faux crab in it). Doesn't seem right. Then when I ate my roll, the sushi rice was mushy. It wasn't very pleasant. Oh, well. Can't win em all.",U2OB6OngndDXcYML0dlq-Q,1,1,3,lU2H7mwFgzDJ5VfLvP4Qcg

We went with the American Dream, Alaskan Roll, and probably a  CA roll or spicy salmon or spicy tuna b/c those are our staples.. IT was very good but it was also very pricy. It was prob. 20 min. b4 they closed and I saw a couple try to come in and walk around the closed sign (this place is inside Green Valley Ranch) and the chefs told the wait staff no.. so the very brave couple walked over to the chefs and said we cant even get a few rolls of sushi? (No means no.. she's a girl she should know better!..) but alas these fine gentleman compromised and agreed and made their food to go b/c after all they were closed) this whole situation kind of made us feel uncomfortable b/c we were just getting our food when all this happened.. IT made me wonder if they were angry we walked in so late in the game.. but oh well. The food was good but a smidge overpriced. I'd go to Sumo Sushi on GV/sunset by the Albertson's & 24 hr fitness plaza.. for just as great of food but a lil better price. plus there's woody who makes the extra price worth it!",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,2,1,3,gpcJfYlPZWcT9i2APnx6pA
5097892,2012-12-05,0,ATErtjbLCxEPOD8ICKKr5Q,"This place is now No.1 as my favorite AYCE sushi places.  This is only good from 5PM to 7PM and it costs for $28.95.  It's a small restaurant tucked away within GVR.  Their best dish is the seared ahi (called Ecstasy) with their special sauce, normally, this is $14, so ordering this twice makes it a great deal.

Their fish quality is pretty darn good for AYCE, not too much rice on the sushi.  It takes them a little longer to get your dishes, so patience is in order.  If you order the udon, it's highly recommended to share, as the bowl is BIG!  The broth is perfect, not too salty but full of flavor, they use very good fish stock.

Highly recommended!",tw1YfWwGJffPlUNTl_w1fw,3,1,5,Ci3zo0_CEgum1GyjG9Mw6A

However, the customer service experience I had here was very, VERY poor. It had taken half an hour just to bring out the wine, and even then, they had brought out the wrong type of wine for my parents. Out of all the plates we ordered, only two of them had been delivered to us over the course of the 45 minutes that I had been there. The table next to us had ordered a second plate of shrimp tempura and received it very quickly - meanwhile, we had ordered our only plate of shrimp tempura long ago and hadn't even received it at the time. Because I had to leave early, I was unfortunately unable to receive even the one plate that I had ordered. By far the worst experience I've had at a sushi restaurant!",n5RLc0MXfRkg8cI9diz8fQ,0,0,1,LKlcepMce_UD1X4sn0_vOQ

You have one hour to eat, which is plenty of time.  This special is only from 5-7 though.  Other than that the menu was ok.  I am not a sushi person so I had the tempura shrimp and veggies. It was ok.  The dipping sauce was good.  The variety for non-sushi eaters is fairly small, however, they do offer a Chinese menu as well which I will do next time.  My wife love the AYCE and would definitely do it again.   Make sure you go on weluvlocals.com and check if they are doing any groupon type certificates, it we had 25 of 50 so that was awesome!",rlI_yWGmUeJBHN2Bn5LRyg,0,0,4,CJlcBlhM9qWeAnk0K_UNfA

The fish didn't taste fresh ( which makes sense why they give you such large portions, they are probably trying to use it up instead of discarding it) the waiter mixed up our appetizer and when we said it was the wrong one he told us to eat it because it's usually $24.95 by itself and we were lucky to be 
getting it for the all you can eat price. Then my boyfriends rice on his sushi tasted sour. We should have just left then and there but we felt bad since we had already put our roll orders in. Needless to say on the five minute drive we had to take home, both of us got sick extremely fast ... From every end you could imagine.",nnSNAPC7gT_Oqg_6IkZJag,1,0,1,oIrnS2hH6vfnLMm9szFU2Q
