Friendly staff.  

I ordered a meal which includes one meat, two sides, a roll, and a drink for $11.  I ended up adding another meat for $3 more.  I ordered the Pork Ribs and the Chicken and for sides, sweet potato ""fries"" and their baked mac n' cheese.  I quoted ""fries"" because it was more like chips.  Let's start with the meats, both the Pork Ribs and the Chicken had GREAT flavor, but as for temperature wise, it would have been nice to bite into something ""hot"".  My meats were barely at a warm temperature but it's all good, the flavor did make up for that.  The ribs were very tender to my liking.  I also requested for DARK meat, and I couldn't hear the server's reason behind not giving me DARK meat over sound of the machines and the customers in the restaurant so I just went along nodding my head and accepting that I was getting WHITE meat instead of the dark meat in the pan.  Can I say whether or not he knew the difference?  I'll never know.  I can't say I was too impressed with their Mac n' Cheese.  It did look like it had been either sitting for too long or a tad on the dry side and I'd say that for their corn muffin too.

Will I be back, of course!

With that being said, Happy Eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,2,4,E7gWobOGjfLqdXy6c5KZAA
