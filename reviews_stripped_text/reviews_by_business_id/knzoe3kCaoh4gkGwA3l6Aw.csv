The second time I ordered was okay except for the small error in forgetting to add a flavor to the crust, easy to deal with, the pizza was good otherwise. Just got home with my pizzas tonight and they were pretty much all wrong. Flavored crusts on the completely wrong pizzas, one of the pizzas wasn't even the right crust type, no extra sauce on one of them. I just don't understand how hard It is to read. Being a server myself, and also having worked at a pizza place before I know personally this is not a hard job. I don't know what the interview process is here, but clearly the expectations aren't very high at all. I will not be giving them anymore business.",p1RzdwO4QM8icHmonJP7lA,1,0,1,H883p7OdptmikadP5jGntw
504456,2017-05-20,0,knzoe3kCaoh4gkGwA3l6Aw,"The last two times I've ordered from this location, I've ordered cheese sticks and pizza. Instead of cheese sticks, they've given me breadsticks each time. The first time, didn't really pay attention as I was in a rush and only noticed when I got home. However, the second time, when the guy opened the box to show me what I had ordered, as I was paying, I noticed the difference right away and actually asked him if those were indeed cheese sticks in the box because there was no cheese anywhere and the whole thing looked extremely dry. He lied and said 'they are cheese sticks, like you asked for'. But I was far from convinced. So, I decided to try another Pizza Hut location a few days later and at that location, the cheese sticks were definitely cheese sticks. These cheese sticks also looked identical to the ones in the pics on the Pizza Hut website. So, the guys at the Cheyenne Ave location are basically lying to some of their paying customers and not giving us what we ordered and paid for. Their pizzas are also often dry and have hardly any sauce on them. I was going to this location because it's very close to where I live, however, I'd rather drive a few extra miles and get better pizza and honest employees.",iQW1ReBBVgYDP15-q014yA,0,0,1,7fnOGgiqm36RUiGzEbLznA

So I called her reason was they where out of stock You took my order as a manager you weren't awear of this and my bf paid for the food because we had three boxes thought it was all correct NO we got 2 med cheese n chicken pizzas with cinnamon sticks as I was speaking with Monica the manager (says Kimberly on my receipt) she's yelling at me as I'm asking for the corporate number and asking for my money back because I paid cash I will have to drive up to the store I told her when i did I didn't want to deal with her she said she wouldnt help me anyway....worst service ever given by a manager I've ever experienced in 28 years of ordering pizza hut. She puts be on hold to get the number and says my GM just walked in with chicken wings we can make them for you now I asked her why is she playing games a work that made her super mad she began yelling again I asked to speak with someone else she then said No one will speak with you and hung up in my face.,ystguq2jg9mOU9fhxbtQKg,1,0,1,4S2HZkDyQ9ZECYg7z10cqw

I waited an hour and a half for my pizza to arrive, but I figured, it's Saturday, maybe they're really busy. When the pizza finally arrived around 3 pm I opened the door to a not so friendly delivery driver. Once I open my pizza I immediately know it's old. The cheese was literally brown and the pizza was not warm at all. I called to let the manager know I would be bringing it back and expecting a full refund. He was actually really nice and understanding. Unfortunately, I had to start getting ready for work and ended up not having time to take it back. Total waste of money, the full pizza went to waste which is rare in my house.

4014574,2015-10-16,3,knzoe3kCaoh4gkGwA3l6Aw,"You guys seriously moved to this place from the old one that was less than 5 minutes away from my house?  Seriously?  What happened, did you replace the good pizza pie makers as well?  It's on the same street!  The pizza should stay the same!  Horrible.  Horrible!

On a Friday night, at least once a month the family & I stay home and order a pizza and watch movies.  Save some money, watch some flicks you know?  But being that the Pizza Hut that was nearest our home now moved to way WAY up the street near the 215 freeway, I now have to drive nearly 20 minutes each way to get my fix.  I wouldn't mind it if Pizza Hut kept the same consistency to their pies!  You're a chain, they should stay the SAME!

So I ordered online, and I will admit that I'm a P.I.T.A when I order because when Pizza Hut runs their special of a medium pizza for $6.99 each with unlimited toppings I go nuts.  There are three of us in the house, and each of us has different tastes.  So what do I do?  Improvise with toppings on each 1/2 of the pizza!  You figure if it's offered online then it really shouldn't be a big deal.  So for each 1/2 we all get what we want.  I've done this multiple times and our old Pizza Hut didn't skip a beat.  Nor was my pizza ever made that bad.

With the order online in, we all take that long drive up the hill of Cheyenne Ave. to find this new fandangled Pizza Hut.  Turns out it's in the same shopping center as the Neighborhood Walmart.  We get there and park, and whaddaya you know it's busy!  Friday night!  Just got paid!  And here we all are, probably near broke, eating Pizza Hut.  I'm OK with this, as long as the pizza is tasty!

Unfortunately our first round of pizzas was not.  There were some missing toppings from one of our pizzas, and the other one had the incorrect crust!  Not to mention, the crusts were looking way flat, like they didn't have enough time to proof.  I was not taking those home, so the manager came by and told me he could make me two new pies but it would take at least 20 minutes since they are backed up.  I agreed and waited.  And waited.  Finally after nearly 30 minutes I stood up and asked the gal behind the counter if my reorder was done yet.  It had been sitting in the warmer!  Couldn't someone have called me back up right when they were done?  Geez.

Took a look at this round of pizzas and the crusts still looked flat.  I did not order thin crust folks!  Then on one of my pizzas they forgot the crust seasonings as well as my balsamic sauce 'drizzle'.  They managed to fix this but rather sloppily.  Then on my other pizza, the crust did not look like a pretzel at all!  It should be darker brown along the crust with the sea salt sprinkled on top!  This was some weak @$$ pretzel crust I'm telling you.  But I didn't want to wait AGAIN for another set of pies so we left to trek back home.

At least this time with the pizzas the toppings weren't as scarce, they shouldn't have been because I ordered like 5 toppings for each 1/2!  But man these guys need a lesson in placing spinach on a pizza.  Can you guys please, please make it look a bit more presentable?  Looks like it was thrown on there from a Bryce Harper lob at midfield.  Too much power!  Not enough finesse.

Pizzas were OK, not what we usually enjoy with our movie night at home.  And it all ended with the CRUST.  Toppings were good, fairly fresh, and the cheese wasn't lacking.  It was the horrendous crust holding it all together.  It was too thin, and in some parts underbaked!  Ugh!  It had less crisp crunch and too much chew.  You could say it was because of the toppings, but I've ordered lots of toppings on our pizzas from our old Pizza Hut before and they never came back with uncooked crusts.  It's the DOUGH.  Wasn't pulled from the freezer long enough and set to proof so it could rise like it's supposed to before baking.  I know because I used to work for a Pizza Hut express back in college and had to proof crusts daily.  I'm going to venture and guess they didn't make enough crusts for the day because they weren't expecting that big of a crowd.  So some of the crusts they pulled out at the last minute didn't thaw enough (yes Pizza Hut uses frozen dough).  But come on, it's a Friday night!  Stoners & poor people alike will want to be ordering pizza!

Sorry guys, your new location is killin' me.  Won't be back there for a while until you settle in.  I'm gonna go with my other pizza place that's less than 5 minutes away...DOMINO'S.
