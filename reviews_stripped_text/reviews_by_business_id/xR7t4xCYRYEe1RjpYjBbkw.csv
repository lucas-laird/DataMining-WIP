The subtle treatments to the fish enhance the flavors and the progression of flavor from lighter to stronger throughout the chefs selections ensures your palette will not be overwhelmed by the previous dish. 

I also recommend a pairing of Japanese shachu. The shachu is great for cleansing the palette and leaving a clean mouth feel so you can appreciate every aspect of the chef's next selection.

The reason Tomo is on my top 5 list of great SH in LV is their service, fresh ingredients n wide selections of great appetizers. I highly recommend getting their skewers, sweet shrimps, n oysters. They r just exceptionally dynamite. But everything here I've tried so far is wonderfully delicious. Only gripe I have with Tomo is their location. It is locate on the corner of a strip mall u can easily past by n miss it. It is also a bit further away from the strip. But like an old sayin: Good things r hard to come by.

Upon walking in, we were greeted and seated almost instantly, although we had to take a few to adjust our eyes to the light: coming from the beautifully sunny outdoors, it was not very well-lit inside.

The waiter was very nice and asked if we had been there before. He explained all the aspects of AYCE, like what menu items were included and which items were limited quantity per person. He brought our waters right away and brought us extra ginger.

Some of their food seemed a bit salty or wouldn't have any flavor without sauce. Their Tomo Special soup and Kalbi appetizer were really good. We also had the blue fin tuna sashimi as it was a Wednesday special, which was also delicious.

Their oven broke in the middle of our meal. After we had ordered some oven-necessary food items (unagi and baked green mussels), they informed us it would take longer than usual for those to come out. We asked how long and they said maybe 10 minutes. We said we were fine with that. Much later, they came back to us and said the oven needed much longer and, after checking with the sushi chef, they could make some of the stuff with a torch. I was a bit hesitant but my boyfriend decided to go ahead with it. The sushi came out ok with a slightly charred flavour, not necessary in a bad way as this was unagi! But it was obvious the mussels were not cooked all the way, however, I was in the restroom when they arrived so did not have a chance to say anything until after my bf had already tried two of them. According to him, they were extremely chewy and inedible (he spat them out). We brought this up with the waiter and he said it was fine that we didn't finish them and we wouldn't be charged.

The sushi chef also changed shifts partway through our meal and we noticed the nigiri had more rice in the later part of our meal. Or maybe it was their passive-aggressive way to get us fuller faster and to leave sooner (just kidding!)

I was too full for dessert (how often does that happen!?) but my bf had the tempura green tea ice cream and mango mochi, both of which he said were really good. The tempura green tea was a little more runny/melted than he would have liked but it was still good.

Kudos for the customer service as both waiters we had were very friendly. It wasn't too crowded, which was fine considering it was mid-Wednesday afternoon. But soon after the meal, we were both not feeling all that well and very dehydrated (we kept chugging water like crazy), so not sure if it's worth returning if that is the post-meal experience.",ihtr8PzUNeNMAihO02vyBw,0,0,3,UkzC2koOqJt4w99i-7pGFw

But it doesn't matter now, because all that matters is that it's Tomo Sushi. Yes... Tomo Sushi. Not to be confused with Momo sushi even though it sounds the same. Tomo is the word. And the word is the bird.

Speaking of birds, lets get to the appetizers. I ordered a bunch, but I forgot to take pictures of a lot of them. So sue me. It's ok. Actually, don't sue me. I got a Who's your daddy, and Who's the mamma. I think that's what its called. The one with the crab stuff inside the jalepeno. I liked it. I thought the jalepeno could have been cooked a little longer, but it had a nice snap. Crackle and pop. Another thing that I enjoyed were the calamari. They had a light tempura batter. It was all good in the hood. Ordered a bunch of other stuff, I thought all of it was pretty good.

Onto the nigiri. First, all of the fish and shellfish that they used was pretty fresh. And, I thought that the rice was good as well. A special shoutout goes out to the octopus. They do a really good job with their octopussy ;-) James Bond would approve. Sean Connery, not Pierce. Gotta go with the legend on this one. Not the backup. Not the Garrafolo to the Brady. I thought they should have given him a shot. But you know Brady is going to work his magic on Paul Tagliabue. Like always. But, I'm not bitter. There is no reason why I should be. Yeah, it was good.

Ordered a miso ramen then. The noods were well cooked, but couldn't really care for the broth or egg.

This place is doing some pretty good stuff here. Not everything is a homerun, but overall, its good, no major concerns or anything.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,24,22,4,L6AECkbVaGXrpOqU23NfuA

Only highlight @ Tomo that was better than Sushi Way were the Shrimp heads as they were not over cooked & oil they were cooked in was fresh. Many pieces of the fish @ Tomo were mushy & not chilled. Thank goodness we didn't get ill. Waitresses did not know what any of the fish was when we were trying to order as they were asking us how to spell it & trying to look @ our menus. When dropping food off at the table we would ask what the fish was & they just looked at us like ""doe in the headlights"" & laughed. They would drop other diners orders with us of items we didn't order. Actually said many of times that they didn't know what the plate was that they were bringing us. If you're going to be in business get waitstaff that knows what the food is.

The bulgogi entree was good and very filling. It would have been nice if it came with some rice though. We were pleasantly surprised that they honored our custom selection of sashimi, which was priced-fixed by the number of pieces.

The waiters were very welcoming and all smiles. They went above and beyond on several accounts. In addition to accommodating our custom selection of sashimi, they also gave us a free miso soup refill and offered to give us kimchi from their employee stock (they don't officially serve kimchi on their menu).

Tomo Sushi is off the beaten path of the Strip so that probably explains the lack of crowds on a Friday evening.

Avoid the sashimi salad. 

The rolls, as others have said, are not especially strong here. I do like that most are available to order by the half. There is only one riceless option (Johnny #1). The namesake Tomo handroll was the surprise hit of the evening, and something I'd come back and order two of for a meal (not AYCE). 

Location is clean and nicely decorated. Staff were professional but not particularly friendly, even sitting at the bar. Most fish was nicely cut, nigiri had a good rice ratio. I'm on this side of town pretty regularly and there aren't too many sushi spots, but this one is just okay.

I don't ever leave this place with the feeling of wanting to throw up because of being forced to finish my food like other sushi restaurants. In addition to that they actually give you (2) pieces of Amaebi nigiri instead of one like Sakana. I have been coming to this place once if not twice a week for almost two months straight after my sister and I tried this place out.

The second two times, I dined in. 

They have tonnnnns of apps that are so delicious. The gyzoa are hot and fresh. The nigri cuts are thick and the rice small and you could tell it was real sushi rice, not just plain sticky rice. The soups are magical. If you know me, I'm a HUGE fan of soup. We had a few rolls, but mostly stuck with the nigiri. The oysters are super fresh and large. Snow white, something wrong 69, and the vampire were all delicious. The Japanese mustard on the snow white was just right.

My boyfriend and I decided we should eat something different, since we haven't eaten all you can eat sushi in over a year and a half!

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and the chef's in the back who ended up making our sushi. We ordered about 10 different rolls, and they were all....so so so good!!! My favorite of them all is the baby lobster roll, which consists of a California roll and on top are baby lobsters topped with a special sauce that's just mouthwatering! My boyfriends favorite ended up being the lemon meet salmon roll. That was also super delish, if I must say so myself! It's a salmon roll topped with lemon slices and a sauce that was lemony yummy!

At the end of our rolls, we ordered desert too! I got the green tea Mochi and my bf got the honey toast.

Staff is very friendly and was quick to make sure we always had good ordered. It wasn't very busy though so I don't know what a busy weekend night would be like. 

The options were pretty great, more appetizer and dessert options than any other AYCE place I've been to.  Sadly the major exception to this is of course the rolls. More than 75% of the rolls had imitation crab (many had crab in and on them). A large number of rolls had the same garlic ponzu sauce. The overall diversity was pretty lacking. 

The quality of the rolls and fish were good however, even if they were pretty similar. I was really excited to see that they had honey toast for dessert but was really disappointed when the bread was actually nothing more than a cheap dinner roll that had been toasted.

This is a Korean owned sushi place so you'll find food items that are also Korean such as Bulgogi Tacos. 

They also go overboard on the sauce. The sashimi salad had too much sauce, the same for the Screaming Orgasm.

3087718,2017-05-30,0,xR7t4xCYRYEe1RjpYjBbkw,"I come here because it's the closest AYCE sushi spot to my house. It's also very comparable to Sakana or Yama in the area so there's no reason not to come here. They include appetizers and even ramen and udon in All You Can Eat so there's a good deal of variety. I usually just stick to the appetizers and rolls. Some of my favorites are the Johnny Roll, Hulk, What Da Heck, and Gangster. I also LOVE the Tomo Hand Roll. I could probably just eat Johnny Rolls and Tomo Hand Rolls and be perfectly happy. For appetizers I always order the bulgogi. They give you a pretty large portion on a sizzling plate. I usually order the shumai too, I think it comes with three. They're nothing super special but I like dumplings. 

They offer half rolls for almost everything and I usually end up ordering a ton of half rolls so I don't get stuck if I don't like something. The only drawback of Tomo is that their service is sometimes spotty. Recently I've noticed it's gotten busier which is awesome but they only have 1-2 waiters at a time and you can end up waiting for awhile to place an order. We also had an incident where we showed up right before the lunch/dinner cutoff at 3pm and got charged dinner price. We had no real way of verifying we got there before 3 so we didn't argue but be aware of this if you want to get lunch pricing around this time. 

The last cool thing about Tomo is that they have a punch card. Buy 10 AYCE sushi and get 1 free I believe. However, we've never been able to redeem our punch cards because they had a separate special going for a few months and then another time they didn't let us combine two cards (even though both were mine). So the concept is cool, but they seem to always have an excuse as to why we can't redeem it. Other than that it's a perfectly good alternative to any of the more popular AYCE sushi places and unless the service gets unbearable I'll continue to come here.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,2UyAaV7rF4jlbouSaO_7yQ

3541779,2016-04-24,3,xR7t4xCYRYEe1RjpYjBbkw,"This sushi restaurant has been open for 6 mos now and after our mediocre dinner at Sushi Goyemon, we decided to give Tomo a try.

We arrived on a Friday evening, 6pm, and nobody was at the restaurant..  They have an extensive menu to chose from for the AYCE.  We ordered our favorites, the super white, salmon, uni, amaebe, Hamachi, saba...unfortunately, our fave, the super white has fried onions and some sauce on it, which we were not a fan of.  We like our fish to be plain and simple, so we can add a bit of fresh wasabi and truly taste the flavor and freshness of the fish.  They have the scallop nigiri, but it is the small bay scallops, so we didn't order it.  I also tried the bulgogi tacos, and though the flavor was good, the meat was a bit too chewy for me so I spit it out.

The salmon and Hamachi nigiris were delicious though.  

For dessert, we ordered the honey toast and green tea tempura ice cream.  They were both disappointing.  The honey toast was a Hawaiian roll, drenched in honey, with a tiny scoop of ice cream.  Not what I expected.  The green tea tempura ice cream was meh...I ate the ice cream and left the soggy tempura batter on the dish.

They also offer the stamp card...though we won't be needing it.  This is our first visit and will likely be our last.

I will give Goyemon another chance.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,2,0,3,qa7xz8pXpaHJdyDNxAqgFg
3600205,2016-05-06,5,xR7t4xCYRYEe1RjpYjBbkw,"Here's the thing about Tomo...it's hit and miss. Our First visit, we were blown away by the service, presentation, and food. Our first visit was on a Saturday night and there were 4 different chefs, with the owner(I think...older Asian chef in the Tomo Video) taking care of most of our orders. Everything we ordered from appetizers to nigiri to ramen and dessert were good! (*All my photos posted are from our first visit)

This second visit was on a weeknight with two chefs, the owner wasn't there,a hispanic and  younger Asian chef(also in the video with glasses) was in charge that night. It was pretty busy for a weeknight and being in charge, he was overwhelmed by the tickets, being snappy with the waitstaff, and worse of all, presentations were sloppy, different, and not impressive like our first visit.

I don't know whether to continue our sushi search, give Tomo another chance, or to go back to Goyemon since they still have the overall better selections as far as AYCE sushi goes. If you plan to check out Tomo though, be sure that the Chef in charge is there so he can keep an eye on quality. I didn't take any pictures on our second visit because the presentations weren't as impressive as our first visit. ALOHA!!!

The other rolls were decent at best and the nigiri was ok.  I enjoyed the fish to rice ratio but the sushi rice tasted either slightly undercooked or slightly old.

Service at Tomo was spot on. Staff was very attentive, cleared plates on a regular basis and checked up on me frequently without being overly intrusive, although I did go for lunch and the place was fairly empty.

I find getting Nigiri is the best test to the quality of an AYCE eat place. If it's made properly with good large cuts of fresh fish and small amount of rice...WINNER! If its not, well...don't return!

- All the Nigiri I got here was very good to excellent. I especially loved the Garlic Tuna and the Garlic Yellowtail...with small flakes of Garlic and a slight hint of sauce...great flavor...Brilliant!
- The only roll I ended up getting was the Candy Cane. It was OK, I felt like it needed more Soft Shell Crab in it. 
- The Spicy Salmon hand roll was OK. Good Flavor, but could use some more Spicy Salmon in it. 
- Yellowtail Carpaccio was OK...Very good presentation...but lacked the flavor. The taste did not match the visual presentation.

4914739,2015-11-04,5,xR7t4xCYRYEe1RjpYjBbkw,"Tomo Sushi replaced the old sushi place that used to be here since I could remember from a young age. While I was excited that a better establishment might have taken over, I was sorely disappointed with my experience.

I came here on a Saturday (10/17/15) for an early dinner at 4 p.m. with two friends. It was slow as it was occupied by two other tables when we arrived.

SERVICE:
2/5. While the female server was friendly, our main male server was forgetful and couldn't perform basic tasks. I would be more lenient if it was busy, but three tables divided between 2 servers and 3 chefs is quite the opposite. We had to ask for plates along with the small sides of ginger and wasabi you'd usually get immediately. A good number of our orders were missing because they weren't put in. When they were asked about, our server would respond, ""it's being made right now."" While I appreciate the effort, it does not take 10 minutes to make a spicy tuna hand roll. It also took us 15 minutes to get our check? When we wanted to pay it as soon as we were ready, there was no one at the counter for us to walk up to and pay.

FOOD:
2/5. The general consensus was that we definitely have had better. Nothing stood out and was mostly forgettable. This place specializes in rolls and appetizers. I've had better dynamites at Goyemon, but their chicken and beef skewers are good along with their bulgogi side dish.. Like the pictures have shown, the oysters were large and were fresh. Unfortunately we only got 2 out of 4 rolls we ordered. We got Found Nemo and 1 out of the 2 Tomo handrolls we ordered. The only thing that stood out for the Found Nemo was the Japanese mustard sauce since it was different. The Tomo roll was amazingly flavorless despite having flavorful ingredients.The carpaccios we ordered tasted like plain sashimi, and the chefs forgot to peel off the film lining on the super white (making it chewy and unpleasant to eat). Some of the nigiri had awkward cuts that seemed to be flopped onto the rice and didn't taste like anything special. The one saving grace I had was the salmon skin handroll. Nicely fried salted crunchy skin with little bits of meat wrapped in a warm bundle of rice and sprouts.

tl;dr:
My friends and I have experienced better. Comparing it to other nearby places like Sakana, I'd skip out on this place and would rather go there or make the drive out to Sushi Koma.",z79zqSpRSCfrPRhfLaeeWg,1,0,2,RgK7zzXZVaR8FRrptMwZsg

I came to this restaurant for the same reason you are planning to visit, and probably why you are reading this review. This 'hot and new' restaurant has great ratings, good reviews and good prices for an ayce sushi spot. All said reasons for a visit can be deceiving. Let me share my experience in the simplest of ways.

We show up at 8pm and the place is completely empty and has a funky vibe. Not good. We decide to stay and we are immediately seated by a friendly waiter. Our drinks are ordered and we decide to get a few appetizers... And that is where everything takes a weird turn:

* We ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer and, to my unpleasant surprise, these are breaded (panko) shrimp with a thick and sometimes chewy crust. This has got to be the first Japanese restaurant I've visited where thy do not do tempura right. From the shrimp to the tempura popcorn lobster on the rolls, everything tasted of old frying oil while being incredibly bland. 

* We ordered several rolls (they do half rolls on most of their menu), but quickly found out most of their rolls lacked flavor. Maybe it's a lack of use of salt, or perhaps the sauces on the rolls having similar flavored, but everything tasted like an unremarkable mush of rice and fish. 

* Both the waiter who sat us down, and the lady who took care of our table, were very nice and friendly. However, our food took unusually long to arrive at the table given an empty restaurant. 

Would I visit this restaurant again? Probably not. Might this have been an ""off night"" for them? Perhaps, but I want you to know there are better sushi spots out there.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,2,0,2,KSL1Vjb07GwFEEwsZIdiqw

5517464,2016-04-20,3,xR7t4xCYRYEe1RjpYjBbkw,"Tomo-tose (comatose). Has anyone even said that, yet? Because I literally walked out feeling Tomo-tosed. I felt like I had an abnormal consumption amount of msg. We came in for my son's birthday. He requested sushi, and sushi is what he got. What we got.

I had the following (whether I ordered it myself or ate off of one of my kids plate): salmon skin hand roll, garlic edamame (now you KNOW that was MY order), spicy tuna roll, garlic tuna, togarashi fries, cali tempura, Japanese lasagna, and philly tempura. 

Doesn't sound like much...but I literally ate 3 bowls of the edamame and 2 of the salmon skin rolls, and I had to finish up my kids tempura rolls because they were tapping out on me. I had no crave for deep fried rolls...but I ordered wisely on my end because I knew there was no way my children would be finishing.up their orders and there was no way I was going to be paying for any leftovers.

I absolutely LOVED their garlic edamame. That wok fried flavor was in full effect. Their salmon skin roll was thee best I've had! They were not stingy with the salmon skin and the salmon skin were in big pieces. My garlic tuna tasted nice and fresh. Spicy tuna was just alright to me. The togarashi fries, though. So good. I honestly don't even know what the hell was squirted on there. I'm thinking it was cheese and that japanese.mayo, for those who know. The fries were good. But you have to eat it quick because once it settles, fries sog and the cheese part hardens.

Not gonna get into what the husband ordered because I think he ordered everything. Hahahhaah. Typical. He thought they were pretty good. However, there were some times that he complained his seaweed from his hand rolls were pretty chewy and hard to rip through. 

I didn't notice when I ate my hand rolls. Perhaps it's cause I dunked the crap out of it into the wasabi mix. Which by the way...their wasabi was pretty weak that day. Don't know if it's like that all the time? 

It was pretty empty when we arrived around 5. Overall, I thought this place was good. 4 stars because these were seriously theeeee most friendliest and most welcoming waitresses at an AYCE I have ever encountered. I don't know if it had to do with it being slow, but the service is the only reason why I'd return. Lies, and the garlic edamame!

The miso soup here was a liiil' salty. They forgot the shrimp tempura I ordered, but it's one of those things that by the time we were towards the end of the meal, I was hoping they wouldn't remember because I was so full.

I was not a fan of the What da Heck roll at all. It was very, very meh. The Orange Blossom was a little better, but both rolls had too much sauce. I did like they do half orders here though.

The nigiri had good fish to rice ratio, and comes in small portions which I always appreciate it AYCE. The tuna, salmon egg, sweet shrimp, uni, and tamago were all standard. The garlic tuna and garlic yellowtail were flavorful. They were out of the carpaccio, so they gave us toro (fatty tuna) without extra charge instead. I'm not a fan, but my boyfriend loved it, and it was super nice of them to do that for us. The oysters we got were also super vinegary which I enjoyed.  

As for cooked items, my boyfriend ordered the dynamite, monkey ball, and salmon Kama since they were out of hamachi. I thought all of them were okay, but he liked them so I guess it's just up to preference.

Overall, I would recommend this place. I thought the rolls were too heavy and drowned with sauce, the cooked items were meh, but the nigiri was good and that's the most important thing when I go for sushi.
