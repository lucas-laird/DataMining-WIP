I must first note that the pictures of the interior of this place are outdated as they must have gone through a remodel. The place is nice and clean with a great display of sake that they offer neatly on the self behind the sushi bar. 

After such a horrible wait staff at Kaya Sushi, my friend and I were still having hunger pangs for some sushi so we kept on driving. We ended up on the corner or Twain and Decatur where we were stopped at a red light for a few minutes, I turned my head to the right only to see Shobu's sign with a yellow sign up that said ""grand opening,"" I thought to myself, well hell, if they just opened then they'll probably put their best foot forward and really impress. We pulled a u-turn and headed into this little strip mall. Already being battened and battered on this venture (we had tried to go to Sapporo [closed], Sushi Tower [weird parking lot], Kaya Sushi [left before we were served]) we did not have super high hopes for this place but figured if it was average then it would do for our time frame and dollars. I was completely wrong about it being average...did you read the first line? It was OUTSTANDING!!

We were happily greeted and seated at the sushi bar in which the sushi chefs were eager to serve us. Our server, JJ, was a most gracious host - our drink orders were taken and brought to us in a jiffy followed by a pot of complimentary fish broth soup. We didn't have very much time so we basically ordered the first roll that caught our eye along with a 5-piece yellowtail sashimi. The fish was fresh and cut up in a bit of a hearty slice (thicker than most sushi places). I ordered the Steve Roll which consisted of Tuna, tempura scallop on the inside and yellowtail and my friend got what was the eel roll with avocado and eel sauce on the outside. Now, I must note that these were ""normal"" size bites of sushi and I think it's because it wasn't cluttered with so much rice...it was just enough of everything. So, all in all, the food was fantastic.

Onward to the service staff...if you sit at the bar then be super prepared to laugh your ass off throughout your dinner. They were eager to have a conversation with us and were very very entertaining...this could be off-putting for some and if you opt out of the entertainment then maybe it's best to be seated at the table. This was our first visit but it will not be our last!",Gv8jNp1moFSmCVQHArU9Rw,0,0,5,CLRq8BWuiMWpgPezeTXX7w

The decor takes it's cues from a dead tree in the middle of the place an rustic wood paneling.  And while sake is the emphasis the sushi and sashimi are the best I have had in the US.  Melt in your mouth yellowtail and halibut and the house invented vampire rolls puts some southwestern spice in a crab and shrimp roll.

But you won't miss it while driving down Decatur between Flamingo and Spring Mtn. The ambience of the place was quiet at first, but music got a little louder as the night went on. The decor of the place was awesome with trees and lighting through out the entire restaurant. Upon entering I was greeted by a hostess and the server we had was on top of it. He was super perfessional and very attentive. 

As the night went on, this place was packed. I am aware that they also have a karaoke room as well,  but did not attend that section of the room. The room sat around 75-80 people, and has a small bar area. 

The menu appeared to small at first glance, but that was only the happy hour menu. The selection of sushi and bento boxes available was impressive. 

I ordered a few items on the menu to try including my favorite the Touch Down Roll as well as the leek salad. The food was delicious and the server, upon ordering sake bombs, are absolutely delightful. This place is fun and full of energy catered to all ages. Don't forget to try all the carparccios, if yu like it raw. I had all three - the Filet Carpaccio, the tuna carpaccio and the albacore cappaccio. All three had distinct tastes and textures. The food was really fresh and I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is near Chinatown. A place worth checking out, especially during happy hour. They had salads ranging from only $3.00 and delicious rolls ranging from $8.00. 

Sake bombs are a must try. The entire restaurant cheers you on while you're downing your bombs. Definitely a must try experience! 

Oh and don't forget sweet honey butter toast with ice cream for dessert. This dessert is to die for!!!!! 

Also.. one more thing. Service here was absolutely awesome ! There's a red button at the corner of every table for you to ring your server if you needed something, and we never had to ring our button even once. Jay was amazing and we really enjoyed our experience here. Thank you Shobu staff for making this an awesome experience for me and all of my friends.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,1,1,5,qffh0iYQRERrPILbnrXE1w

As far as the food, their sushi menu is not that great (I mean, come on, they don't even have volcano rolls).  I've never had anything else, either, but I don't really see a point in going here for the restaurant.

A legitimate korean bar, or sooljib, is defined for its traditional worn and wooden exterior/interior. Sure the tables don't look like it came straight from the more recent and local furniture stores but the worn wooden furniture defines the atmosphere that we Koreans enjoy during our endless nights of drinking. 

Coming from Los Angeles, where Korean bars are quite copious, Shobu definitely does the best job in resembling what I have known as a ""sooljib"" for a very long time. The service is quite consistent. They don't tend to lag or ignore and since all the tables are a bit condensed to one area, the servers keep in touch with all our needs. But I wish they gave us more service(free drinks). Not saying that I want free drinks all night, but for the amount of liquor my friends and I have already spent on since our discovery of the spot, I think it's time that we get a little something something for our business contribution. But nothing comes free in this world so I understand the business perspective in not giving us service soju. 

Their menu offers the usual side dishes and what not. They also have different combinations that you can order whether it be two sojus + two beers + two sodas + a plate of snack. It all varies based on what your appetitte desires. 

The prices are pretty standard. Soju is normally anywhere from $11-13 a bottle and all other more valuable liquor is far above that ceiling so I suggest you stick with soju. 

Smoking is normally not allowed inside the restaurant but I've seen countless amount of people just smoking away regardless of the regulations.

Oh, and for all you underage kids, yes they do accept you. Just make sure you don't look like you're in middle school =)",jCUqHcg4xvFtsG6ah6RcRA,2,0,4,GfDlMT6Xjzwe8VSAcDIh-w

2169755,2011-01-19,0,yUqJReOv26454QkjGz37Yw,"I'm reviewing their karaoke services only, as I haven't eaten here quite yet. 

My friends are big fans of karaoke, so we go to establishments with private karaoke rooms often [which is great for everybody, because with the exception of one person, we all have horrible voices =p]. 

As far as the rooms go, it was pretty standard. Their small room can hold about 10-12 people comfortably, up to 15 if you all want to smash together. Had two microphones, two song books, & two tambourines. All pretty much what you would find at other establishments. 

There is a button on the table, to call a server into the room so that you can order drinks/food if you like. Which, I found convenient, as most other establishments have that button located on the wall next to the door, therefore making someone get up. Not a big deal, I know [but I'm lazy, haha]. And, every little extra convenience helps. Another neat little thing they do is provide water - without having to ask. Again, not a big deal to ask for water in other places - but it was nice. 

So - if you're in the mood to sing your heart out, only to embarrass yourself in front of friends versus complete strangers, this is definitely a good option if you're not in the Chinatown area where most other karaoke establishments are.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,3,1,3,3ZyjgURl19qJi1EMEuNRAA

Went here for my birthday after a bit of research of other karaoke bars / restaurants.  I am SO glad I picked this place.  I had a party of about 12 people, so we reserved the larger karaoke room.  It was the PERFECT size and while there was less karaoke and more mingling/booze/sushi (totally OK with that), it was a great size for that too.

I made reservations, like, the day before online and called the day of just to confirm (I'm always paranoid about things like that) and everything was groovy.

We had 2 servers and they were both extraordinarily awesome that night - they'd check in on us for waters, dirty dishes, etc. and whenever we'd ring the bell they were instantly at the room.

Food - wow.  Food was delicious and decently priced.  Not my #1 go-to spot for sushi but if I want a great time with friends, drinks, karaoke and Japanese I'd go here before anywhere else.

They were also really great about letting us bring in our own food!  I had a cupcake cake and a vegan cake - we just had to let the server cut the cake with a knife.  =)

We went on a Saturday night around 7 or 8 and stayed for a few hours.  Most everyone picked up their own stuff but my fiancé was really adamant about picking up most of the alcohol, any food he could and our room rental.  Surprisingly we didn't break the bank - their alcohol is average priced.

I was a little sad that such a fun place didn't have more going on in the restaurant portion on a Saturday night but the other karaoke room next to us was having a blast!  We almost went over but didn't want to be weird lol.

Great for a chill party!  I definitely want to come back here!!",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,3,0,5,dSaAtaGyBzoNBc9ggu5DxQ

Service is good and attentive, although the Host Jin or James?  was not in....

Decor is unique although appropriate for the venue, have not tried any singing yet....but there's always next time.....

The good thing about this place is that you can order sushi and it will be delivered to your karaoke room! And I must say the sushi was pretty standard, we didn't order anything too extreme. But I don't think this place is worth coming to just to eat sushi. One reason why my coworker comes here is because she thinks the songs are more recent compared to other karaoke places. However, I would like to think other wise because the selection of English songs was kind of limited. I think Zizzy's has more of a selection that is updated. And the room had weird decor because it consisted of stuffed animals above the TV and wall paper that looked like it came from your grandma's house because it had this tainted beige color.

I have not tried out their karaoke yet, but that is another story to be told. This is a place you should not judge by its cover! Despite its shabby exterior, Shobu offers a beautifully decorated interior, with a low-light romance ring to it. I have gone here many times before and have ALWAYS enjoyed my time.

Walking in, it is a restaurant ran majorly by young Korean servers. They are always pleasing the customers and always have an upbeat attitude. The food they serve is a fusion between Japanese dishes and Korean dishes as well. Dishes such as sushi, tempura, teriyaki, and kalbi can be found here!

It is a little bit on the pricier side but I would say it's well worth it. The food is excellent and I think I'm in love with their Kalbi! If you're here for drinks, I would recommend ANY of their flavored soju! Yum! Lastly, I would say their sushi is either a hit or a miss here. Some days, I've had them fat and yummy.

Menu listed Sapporo on draft for $12.95 a pitcher, but they said their draft was ""broken"", so we drank large Sapporo's at $6.95/ea. 2 hours of singing and a few beers came to $60.

We ended up at Shobu on a Saturday night after waiting too long for a karaoke room at a bigger place down the road. The rooms at Shobu were cheaper and without a wait, so it was a no brainer. The room held 10-12 comfortably, or you could squeeze in 15. Cost was $15/hour, which is totally reasonable! They bring in plenty of water, tambourines, special little mic condoms, and the service button is within easy tapping distance. 

The song selection is nice. They had super current songs and plenty of Korean songs too. Every song we selected was available, unlike some other spots where some songs are in the book but missing from the system. The control is in Korean, so it helps if you come with your closest Korean pals. Otherwise, you may be at a loss at which remote buttons to hit.  

The karaoke room was a hot one. We had to crank the portable A/C down to like 60 degrees, but at least they had a separate unit in the room.

Another bonus is that they have a full menu and a full kitchen, but again, I didn't sample a good deal of the food, so I can't say if it is delicious or not.

It was a flavor explosion in your mouth! We also had the Korean, spicy fried chicken- perfectly marinated and the chicken pieces were so moist ::drooling::. We also had a specialty dish which consisted of braised pork belly, daikon kimchi, oysters, and napa cabbage. Basically you take the cabbage and layer it with the other ingredients, wrap it and eat it. The fattiness of the pork belly is a perfect combination with the spiciness of the kimchi, refreshing taste from the oysters, and the baby shrimp sauce gave it the slight saltiness. We also ordered a bowl of udon noodles- broth was nice and hearty, different alternative to pho and ordered fried squid. Yum...

Second, our waitress was such a doll! So much fun and just so sweet! One of the actress's still had fake blood on her and the waitress was super concerned for her. She gave us a ton of attention, even running when we buzzed to have our order taken. She joked around with us and was just great

Third the food! Freaking amazing plates and for an awesome price. We were there after midnight so we got happy hour prices, plus we all got Sakatini's which really were amazing. The food was super plentiful and for once I didn't feel like I had to spend a ton of money to get full.
