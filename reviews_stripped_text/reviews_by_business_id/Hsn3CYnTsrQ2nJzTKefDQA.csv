I first noticed that the business was full, even as people were leaving, it seemed as though all the tables were occupied. The lady who greeted and seated my friend and me was very friendly and welcoming. She had us seated immediately. 

The second thing I noticed was the cleanliness. The tables were quickly wiped clean as people left.  

The menu was extensive and had a good explanation of the various menu items. I chose the beef strip Pho and my friend had the chicken breast Pho. We also had an order of shrimp veggie rolls. All was very tasty and the Pho was plentiful. The beef and the chicken were very tasty, fresh, and juicy. They definitely did not skimp on the amount placed in the bowls. 

I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to my friends and it is definitely going to be my go to when craving Pho!",p7YdXcQC8Jinl0OWsNxafA,0,0,5,nJiECRpmbz9JVGR5ySuvBg

928258,2018-02-13,0,Hsn3CYnTsrQ2nJzTKefDQA,"This place is on Rainbow just south of 215. If that brings up visions of terrible traffic, you're not alone. If you're coming from the 215 exit, you can sit there several minutes waiting to make the left into the parking lot.

The defining feature of this place, really, is that it's open till 11pm some nights, midnight other nights. So, if it's after about 9:30, this is a great option for some really decent pho. And you don't have to worry about traffic at that hour.

Most of what they make here, while very good, isn't quite as good as some of the other nearby places--but not enough to matter when you're craving some lovely pho. One standout is the chicken pho, which is excellent, and they even let you choose white or dark meat (dark, of course). If you're one of those weird people for whom the normal bowl of pho is too much, they offer a small size.

Service can be spotty. Order by number, as some of the servers don't speak English very well. Don't bother waiting for your check when you're done, just go up to the register and if it's crowded, take note of your table number.

Great option for 11pm takeout.",JV0asALxmnJGmnfrHul0tg,0,0,4,bZzEzrEzG-ZZ6YLmH1UPTw

1049941,2017-05-10,3,Hsn3CYnTsrQ2nJzTKefDQA,"Disappointed! Pho Saigon 8 has two other locations that have been open for many years. This location is their newest one and does not meet the quality of the others. The Eastern and 215 location is the best.

FOOD: We tried serval different dishes and sadly is was not good at all. Everything was bland and overcooked, from the meat to the noodles to the soup. The most decent dish was the spring rolls.

DRINK: They sell Vietnamese dessert drinks, sodas, beers, and wine. I didn't want to get any drinks considering how bad the food was.

SERVICE: They are extremely unstaffed. They have one cashier, one waiter, one server, and one bus boy. It took forever for someone to seat us and even longer for someone to come take our order. They came and took our order three times and yet our food still did not come out. As I looked around the restaurant, I could tell that the other customers were annoyed as well. The server and the cooks kept arguing with each other and it quickly became awkward (especially since I speak Vietnamese and can understand what they are saying). They did not bring us drinks, utensils, or anything unless we asked. When it was time to pay, the cashier was no where to be found as many tables were waiting to pay, it turned out he was doing something outside the restaurant and the server had to go get him.

NOTE: I rarely give this low of a rating and review, but I am so disappointed with their food and service.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,14,2,2,wgN5juLMktUWIddt0K5Mlw

Main reasons is their fast and friendly customer service. The prices are reasonable. We've been here multiple times and they are prompt with serving water(s) while you take a look at what you want to order. Never have we felt rushed or impatiently waiting for service. The restaurant is large enough to cater to large groups. They have a couple big screen TV's around with the sports channel on. Go Knights Go! 

My usual order is No. 11 (noodle with rare eye round) in a small. Broth is good. Can't forget to add Hoisin sauce and  Siracha chili to give it some kick. The egg rolls are always a must. 

No cash? Don't fret! They accept cards here. Not like another pho place I know, that was cash only (no bueno).",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,2,2,4,f5PP6y-aLqthjE5vsFN1vw

My main concern is that there were no animal products in the veggie broth. I am happy to report having tried it I did not detect any animal products in it. Additionally has now become my favorite place for pho as the place I had previously been going to the Brass was overly salty. They have a very mild broth with good flavor, and are extremely generous with the fresh veggies and condiments.

1409442,2018-01-22,1,Hsn3CYnTsrQ2nJzTKefDQA,"Came here for dinner a few days ago as it was really cold and we all wanted something warm/hot after a day of helping a friend move. This was something nearby and we all agreed. 

We were immediately sat at a table when we arrived and had gotten waters. 

2 of us gotten #21 large (Noodle w/ rare eye of round, flank, brisket, tendon, and skirt flank). 1 had gotten the #11 small (Noodle with rare eye of round). Another had gotten #15 small (Noodle with rare eye of round and beef ball). One of my friends had gotten the sausage/pork roll (i believe was #5) as he had other dinner plans (which got we later found out next day that they were canceled.... Lol) 

As with all pho noodle soups, it comes with a plate with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, and wedges of lime. 

Reason why i got #21 is that it is most similar to what is called ""Combination Pho or Pho Dac Biet"" in a lot of other restaurants, which is essentially the one with everything. The only thing that this didn't have that some others may have is either tripe or beef balls. Average sized large bowl. Good amount of meat and noodles. Add herbs and bean sprouts to the bottom under the noodles, squeeze some limes and you gots a good bowl of pho. Oh a side dish of hoisin and sriracha too for dipping meat. I don't know if it was because i was super hungry and barely had food, or was cold cuz of weather, but this hit the spot, even if it didnt last that long (got hungry later at night.. haha)

The restaurant is mildly small and could get busy due to limited seats but its a fairly decent size. Prices seem mildly higher than those in Chinatown but for convenience if you are in the area, the price difference is very negligible. 

They are willing to split the bill without restrictions which was good. Not really much complaints besides some unreasonable ones (like not enough meat, not enough noodles.. should have ordered some egg rolls (cha gio) too ! but wait werent they considerably more pricey than other places...?) lol... .right? unreasonable.. hahaha !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,3,4,jaOTUGGv7EowjZ4yXpJ83Q

Lucky for him she didnt tell me this until we got home.  In my 48 yrs of life, not once have I encountered such attitude from the wait staff.  These Viet places dont provide service, just food and they expect 5 star tipping.  You work on tip so work for it.  My wife tipped 8usd but we shall never go to any Saigon 8 again.  Yes they talk about you behind your back when you leave crappy tip, I know cuz I can understand them.  Its the typical Viet attitude wanting things for free or more of it.

I only order three things at Vietnamese restaurants: Pho Tai, Com Bo Luc Lac, and egg rolls.  Saigon 8 absolutely knocks it out of the park with all three of these dishes.  

I do slightly prefer Pho So 1's tomato rice with their bo luc lac, but the onions are more prominent in Saigon 8's version.  The fresh coconut juice here is always fresh and delicious too!

I never order anything else on the menu so I can't speak for any other dishes, but the food is always consistently great here and the waiters are friendly as well.

The #21 has pretty much all of the meats including tendon.  Only thing missing are the beefballs and tripe.  The broth tastes the same as their location on Spring Mountain.

Then, when I asked for extra veggies of WHAT COMES  WITH IT, I am charged another $2?!? 

Come on. The location on JONES and Spring Mountain HAS NEVER EVER EVER charged for extra veggies. 

ON TOP of the AWFUL customer service I experienced from the elderly woman at the register. She's rude and interrupts you when you are asking questions. 

If I could give negative starts for the experience I had tonight, I would. -- $4 for veggies. Absolutely unbelievable. More than HALF the cost of my actual food I ordered. There is something WRONG with that picture, especially when I get home and see THE VEGGIES ARE SKIMPED ON ANYWAY!!! (Hahah!) Geeeez man.

I ordered egg rolls and asked for extra veggies - 1 bag of what usually comes with it and another of what comes with the soup. Instead of offering to have me pay a little extra, the woman just straight up tells me ""no"" / ""no what?"" / ""you cant have that. We can't do that."" 

Now, I didn't say this to her, but I'm just thinking TJ myself, what on earth do you mean you ""CANT"" do that? I am a paying (AND RETURNING) customer for crying out loud. 

It's the LITTLEST things that can either bring your consumers BACK or ensure they bad mouth you to whoever they know that will listen; ultimately resulting in loss of business for your establishment.

3657684,2017-06-06,1,Hsn3CYnTsrQ2nJzTKefDQA,"Update: I usually order the white meat chicken pho, but the texture of the chicken isn't my favorite so I decided to try the dark meat chicken during my last visit. No surprise, I disliked it even more than the white chicken. Thinking they had good customer service, I asked the server if I could just have the white chicken instead brought to me on a side plate since I really didn't eat any of the dark chicken. The server's response was, ""are you kidding me?"" which threw me off a little. I've been going to Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain for years and have never had this problem. If a customer doesn't like their food, you would think they would at least apologize or accommodate to their needs to make the rest of your visit better. I guess not here. Maybe I'll just get a different item from the menu. Sigh.

This new location is so clean and the service is quick. They're always filling your water and always grabbing dirty plates out of the way. Not only is the service quick, but the staff is also very friendly! They make sure everyone at the table is satisfied with their service. For their grand opening, they're giving their guests complimentary spring rolls which is very generous of them. I recommend bringing your family here as it is also very family friend!

3964340,2018-06-19,0,Hsn3CYnTsrQ2nJzTKefDQA,"Pho Saigon 8 has always been one of my favorite Vietnamese Restaurants. I am quite happy when they recently opened a branch closer to home at Rainbow and 215. I used to go to the Henderson branch at least once a week for lunch and when I do, I usually bring friends and/or co-workers since it's only a few minutes away from the office. We recently moved our office near the Spring Mountain Branch so I now take my friends and co-workers there. As a Fathers Day gift, my family wanted to take me out to dinner so I suggested that we go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Since Fathers Day was quite busy at home due to relatives visiting, we decided to go a day after. We decided to go to the one close to home, Rainbow and 215. I decided to order something different from the usual Pho Dac Biet this time. That's when the problem started. I decided I wanted to try some beef balls so I ordered #20 from the menu. The server brought me the wrong order, #22 which had no beef balls. When I told the manager (I think he was the manager because he was tending the register and was kind of rude), he stated that what I ordered didn't have beef balls. However, he'll just bring me some beef balls separately in a bowl instead of correcting the error. Since he was going to bring me a bowl of beef balls which is what I wanted, I said that would work, no problem. When we got the bill, this guy charged us for the extra beef balls. When I asked why, he stated that the beef balls were separate and I would have gotten a lesser amount if it came with my original order. It was very disappointing. I was trying to be nice and this guy had taken advantage. Our bill was $51.20 including the extra beef balls. My daughter works as a barista in one of the nice coffee shops in town and is a very generous tipper. She could have given them at least twice the amount of the beef balls in tips if not more had they taken them out of the bill. My son recommended to just pay the bill and not argue about the $4 or so beef balls. We paid and left without leaving gratuities. Not only that they lost a few dollars in tips, they also lost regular customers. Goodbye Pho Saigon 8. This was our last. There are plenty of Vietnamese Restaurants in town who are just as good if not better. Your beef balls were good though. LOL!",uweNvxdfbOvHuYpV9_xTUQ,0,0,2,SF-GKxaE7MkiKHml5Os-bg

My old review 7 months ago: highly recommend this place. Everything came out excellent. We ordered fresh spring rolls, pho with round eye and tendon and lastly pho with flank steak.

Welcome to the technology world! 

The pho tai itself was decent. I like my pho broth to be savory and not sweet so this broth met its criteria. The egg rolls on the other hand were too peppery. Overall I think the pho is decent and service was ok (it wasn't during any meal rushes). I like pho because generally it's fast enough so that with two kids in tow it's not a long wait.

4380346,2018-05-09,1,Hsn3CYnTsrQ2nJzTKefDQA,"Been here several times now and out of all the times I've never had a bad experience. 

I usually order two things. Com Thit Nuong and Bum Bo Hue. The Com Thit Nuong's beef has a bit of charr to it which makes for the perfect crunch.This dish also comes with the pho soup. So if you're deciding if you want soup or rice you should just get this cause it comes with soup. So you get the best of both worlds. To make the perfect pho soup it cannot be salty. It's literally a large bowl of bone broth. It should be very clear and tasteful. If it makes you thirsty, then there's probably extra salt.

I am a big fan of spicy soup. Especially with pork blood. I know it sounds gross, but don't knock it till you try it. This restaurant by far has the best Bum Bo Hue. What makes them different is they don't have all the oil in it. Most pho places that make this soup adds too much chili oil. So when I drink it alone, I can taste a spoon full of oil. The broth here is spicy and tasteful. They don't add too much meat where it over powers your bowl. The noodles is the perfect amount. Note: they do not make this in a small. If you get the large, you won't regret it. 

Pricing: it is cheap!!

- Beansprouts are clean, fresh, and trimmed (some pho places they're just brown, stringy, and gross) 
- Broth is flavorful and delish just like the Eastern location 
- You can order LEAN brisket! It's not fatty and the meat is just as soft! 
- Pho is filled with generous portions of meat and vermicelli noodles

I tried to come here at least once a week. The food is outstanding and so is the service.

Quality: 5/5
I usually have the #22 large bowl Pho. I seemed to never finish it, but it's so good that the small is not enough.

Customer Service: 5/5
Definitely awesome, the waiter and Waitresses are cordial and on point.  Usually, you don't get these type of services at a Pho restaurant.

Quantity: 5/5
My gosh, they are super generous with their meat portions. No matter what you order, it's guaranteed that you will have enough food to fulfill your belly.

Cleanliness: 5/5
Squeaky clean.  Again, another unusual experience you will have at a Pho restaurant. In a good way of course.

Atmosphere: 5/5

I remember my first time they would give s free egg roll, I guess they don't do that anymore, nonetheless still delicious. I haven't tried the spring rolls at THIS location but I have at the other location so I know I won't be disappointed. 

The pho, the broth, the noodles are all just a perfect blend when you need to fill yourself with something delicious with that homemade feel. I usually get the meat on the side, so I can watch the steamy broth cook the thin slices of beef. I LOVE this soup! Seriously, I absolutely love the feeling of warm, spoonfuls of noodles, meat and broth. 

Another one to try, the beef stew. It is served with a warm baguette. That is definitely a nice filler upper! 

If you're not a soup or noodle guy, they also serve rice plates. The thit muons is by far one of the best Vietnamese plates  in the city. 

The only downside is the wait can get hectic. I docked some stars because on the 3 occasions I have been, I've had a weird welcome (no greeting, no one to guide me to a table, so I sat myself only to be reseated?!) and a few inattentive servers.

I was debating on their egg rolls for our appetizer, but didn't end up ordering it.  Since they're still launching their grand opening month, they offered us complimentary egg rolls.  I wasn't impress with them.  It wasn't so crispy and tasty.  It was more soft and overcooked.  We all ordered pho.  The pho broth here was more on the bland side or I would call it Americanize.  We definitely not craving it or anything.   

I prefer their location off Lindell and Spring Mountain better, even though the service isn't as good as this one.  I haven't been to the one off Eastern yet, from the reviews, it might be the one to try if I'm over in that area.

This restaurant is located right off of the freeway on 215 and Rainbow across from the Walmart shopping center in the 7-Eleven plaza. Inside is spacious and clean with plenty of parking out front. Service was good. Everyone was very attentive and our waters were never less than half full. Unlike the other pho restaurants the soup spoons and chopsticks are not left at the table. So if you accidentally drop one be ready to wave down a server for another one lol

Banh Canh Saigon - BEST in Vegas!! This is what I come here for always. I love the flavor and thickness of the broth with the long tapioca noodles. Bowl is loaded with straw mushrooms, shrimp, pork, and pork blood. My favorite! Will not disappoint. 

Pho Dac Biet - Good! Their broth is nice and flavorful. Definitely one of the better pho broths in Vegas.

Cha Gio - Perfectly seasoned inside. Served hot and crispy with fresh veggies and pickled carrots/radishes for you to lettuce wrap it with. Comes with nuoc mam for you to dip it in. TIP: If you want your eggrolls / appetizers to come out first make sure you tell your server that. If not the entrees will come out first.

Goi Cuon - Good

If you're looking for good pho in the southwest this is the place to be. Spacious, clean, and quick service. They have comfortable booths with like 6 big screen TVs hanging up all over the restaurant for you to watch while you eat.

The environment is beautiful and spacious. Within literally 4 minutes our server took our order, to me that's pretty quick and efficient. I ordered a large beef pho with brisket only. They don't have the brisket only option on the menu but my server was more than willing to accommodate me in what I wanted. My fiancè ordered the Sliced Grilled Pork with Egg Roll & steamed rice. 

We waited less than 10 minutes for our food and at the food window it looked like there was a manager overseeing the food being taken out so when my pho came out he asked the cook why is there so little meat and my server intervened to explain to him that I only wanted brisket. I really appreciated that a lot, the manager ensured my order was going out accurately. Then when it came to my fiancè's bowl it was semi-correct, instead of the steamed rice like he wanted they gave him rice noodles. We didn't say anything just because I'm that type of customer to accept what is given if it's a tedious mistake such as rice noodles instead of steamed rice. No biggie, the vermicelli was good anyway! Our total check was $22 with tax but without tip so it isn't bad for two people.

The place is super clean when we were there. Utensils aren't at the tables like they normally are for a pho place. The server brings you the utensils after you order.

I either like to order pho tai, which is pho with rare steak, or a pho tai bo vien, which is pho with rare steak and meatballs. You are able to either get a large bowl or small bowl and they're usually $1 difference. When I went with my husband one night, I was so hungry that I ordered a large bowl of pho while he ordered a small bowl. When they came with our food, they gave me his small bowl thinking it was mine. Hahahaha. 

I love pho because most places have piping hot soup and if they don't, they're horrible. And the best thing about Pho Saigon 8 is that their broth is actually very decent! It's always consistent whenever I go to the Eastern location and I imagine the Rainbow location would be the same. The broth isn't watered down or overly salty. It's not sweet either! Yes, there are pho places where their broth is sweet.  

Also, if the broth sucks, I typically pour a gallon of sriracha into it but here I don't! 

The prices are a bit higher than most other pho places but not by a lot. If you're hungry, always get the large one!

I repeated my orders several times which you confirm by repeating back to me so I don't know how I can miss read the menu when it was a special order. To argue like that and not care about customer service just turns you off to a location. I should have been concern during my initial order when he cared more about being on his phone then dealing with the customer. I would not recommend coming to this place. 

 Funny how the person responding to my review wasn't even there. This has nothing to do with getting anything for free.
