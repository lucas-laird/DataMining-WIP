2625306,2017-04-29,0,jLmjlSILEpZHr0axiQd3Yg,"I ordered pizza today and - as always - order it well done. I don't like the raw mushy dough under my cheese and like the cheese nice and brown. My online order quoted 31 minutes at 2:10pm. My order arrived, I had time to taste it, and call the store to complain by 2:27pm. 

The cheese was white and barely melted, the crust was white, and the dough in the middle raw. I called the store to complain and was of course offered a remade pizza.  Unfortunately - I didn't have time to wait and was really frustrated anyway. 

I was told that the ""oven isn't working,"" and that when they put the oven on ""well done"" it comes out burnt so they can't do it. Well, serving raw pizza isn't really exciting either.  Why does a pizza shop - that clearly requires a working oven - not have ovens that work?  And why would they just assume that I would be ok with eating something that's not what I ordered?  If they were put of pepperoni would they just send me a pizza with chicken? 

Also - I can't help but wonder if this is true or they're just not paying attention?  How did my online order transmit, they prepared it, cooked it, boxed it, drove it to me, got it upstairs to my third floor apartment, I signed the bill, got inside, grabbed a drink, sat down, opened the pizza, saw the pizza, still tasted it, and called to complain in less than 20 minutes?!?

The clerk who answered told me that he'd put my name in a log for a free pizza next time. Great - I know I'm already looking forward to my next pizza - NOT!  They should have just refunded my money to my credit card. Why would I want to order again from a store where I doubt their truthfulness?  And if they were telling the truth - why are they operating with a broken oven anyway?  

Papa Johns is suffering here y'all. Looks like they're following the same path as the once tasty Pizza Hut and Dominos. I guess it happens - they get too big and can't manage the quality anymore. Might be time to look for the next great pizza chain...  or maybe just stick to a local place.",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,1,0,1,xYWCf76tSDavBiUFvHM-RA
