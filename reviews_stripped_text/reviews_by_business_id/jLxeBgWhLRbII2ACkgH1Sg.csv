The atmosphere, right when you walk in, you can tell everything is made in house. Upon entering you can see their pastry display and their bakery. There's about 10 tables in the restaurant, but they have a few tables outside as well. 

We ordered several items to try a little bit of everything. I had the croque madam, the amman, my husband had the quiche and the cheese Danish, my sister had the crepe and the apple turnover. Not one bad thing. The crepe wasn't anything spectacular, but it wasn't bad. 

I definitely recommend checking this out. I will be returning for sure.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,0,0,4,k0Fsl19kVQ3Z543mzV9yhw

This used to be an awesome restaurant that had wonderful food. My last experience here was way below par. I ordered a croque Monsieur--A dish I've had several times from them in the past. It was completely dried out and gross. Limp even. 

We waited in line for a long time and then were immediately ignored when it was our turn to order. The people behind the counter were running around in a frantic hurry and it was very chaotic. They are not very friendly either. 

I understand that they hired a new pastry chef. This bakery used to have the best pecan and chocolate chip cookies in the valley. Whoever changed the recipe has completely ruined them. The cookies are covered in grease, can't stick together, and fall apart. Obviously they need a lesson in how to cream proper amounts of butter and sugar. 

I am disappointed about the changes. This place has gone way downhill. It has gone from being our favorite Saturday morning place, to a restaurant that we will no longer visit. We have  no reason to spend money on bad food and service. Sadly, the cookies are now really just a tragedy.",kJvAd90RooT2uMPIB-2bdw,8,2,1,Vk4Zq3hA9K8sFrQYxYNT7A

Prices are reasonable, but it's easy to over order. Everything looks, sounds, & smells so delightful.

Also, my daughter clearly enjoyed her Nutella crepe judging by her empty plate and messy face.

I have spread the word about this cafe to my friends in and outside of Las Vegas and voila, they do visited the place because of my recommendation.  My friend and I frequent the place because of their Peet's coffee and our favorite Palmier (Elephant Ear to some).  However, the more we have our coffee there, we noticed that the taste is getting sour and bitter.  This happened three times.  We made complaints about the taste and unfortunately, it seemed like they were not happy about it.  Being consistent customers, we were thinking that they will be accommodating with our complaints but we were given cold shoulders.  We stopped going until we decided to give them another try.

I requested no cheese specifically, so of course they put cheese in with it...so apparently they have no attention to detail. 

Food isn't worth the price $(8.50 for a tiny salad). 

I give it 2 stars because the cookie was good and I haven't tried their pastries. Maybe that's what they should stick with - and get smarter staff.

172448,2014-09-17,0,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"I really wanted to love this place (I prefer to patronize local restaurants), the coffee and apple turnover started things off right. The coffee is good and strong and the turnover had a fresh buttery flakey crust with a not too sweet not to tart apple filling (texture of apple sauce with the thickness of apple pie filling...very nice). La Petite Bakery in Colorado Springs, French Bakery in Fort Walton Beach, and the quiche at Adam's Mountain cafe in Manitou Springs were my benchmarks. 

Unfortunately, La Belle wasn't on par with my past experiences in similar restaurants. The chicken and goat cheese quiche dough was raw and the chicken gave it that re-heated chicken taste. I asked for something else, which they were really nice about. I got the breakfast sandwich (egg, ham, and swiss on a ciabata roll) and it was ok. The ham looks like your average luncheon meat, but the bread was nice. Honestly, though, I think I have had better breakfast sandwiches and even quiche at Panera.

The side salad that came with these items had a good vinaigrette, but could use more field greens and less iceberg (personal preference).

I will say the price point is good and I would think about grabbing a baguette for dinner another time because they look great. Also, the owner was very helpful and nice as I was ordering. Overall...ok, I might give them another try because maybe it was an off day and all the other reviews are so strong, but with so many places to try in Vegas; I imagine it won't be soon.",J5Vd0prbo2LmM0MB5bqdoQ,0,0,3,HQjM8-V4v33dEwXfe41HIg

That's not a big deal as I assumed they were just busy.  What turned me off was the response when I called the restaurant for a status update.  At first the guy who answered said he only had one order this morning and it wasn't mine.  When he checked again, it was indeed mine.  Then I asked had the order gone out and he said he didn't know, he just knows there isn't any order there waiting to go out.  So to clarify I asked again, did that mean it was en route, and he said again, all he knows is there isn't any order there in a more insistent tone.  The tone and the way he responded was not a pleasant interaction.  I asked if he had a delivery driver and are they in the restaurant right now?  Same response...your order isn't here.  Very dismissive and unhelpful.  With as many options as there are here in Las Vegas, I won't waste my time with them again.

975770,2014-01-10,0,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"My husband and I went here on a Sunday afternoon on a recommendation from a friend, as well as a recommendation from a fellow Yelper and we weren't disappointed. 
For our starters, my husband had an almond croissant and I had a pain au chocolat, both of which were amazing. They had the right amount of flakiness, firmness and layers that we could taste the pastry, butter, almond and chocolate in each delicious bite. My husband enjoyed a double shot latte with his pastry, while I had a refreshing Perrier.

For our mains, my husband selected the Quiche Lorraine and I chose the Croque Madame, which is a Croque Monsieur with a fried egg on top. I have been in search of the perfect Croque Madame in Vegas since we moved here last October.  We have been to several bistros and patisseries in Vegas, from on the Strip (Bouchon - double digit doughy version) to off strip (Patisserie Manon - non-existent, ran out of bread version). LBTB's version was delicious, however, I agree with a previous reviewer that it could have used more bechamel. Also, while the egg was hot and fresh, the ham and cheese was not very warm. Having said that, the bread was perfect, just the right amount of crunch on the outside and moistness on the inside, the cheese was just sharp enough and perfectly complemented the ham. We asked for a side of dijon mustard, which was a nice accompaniment. My husband had the quiche lorraine, which had a very nice, flaky and tasty crust and the inside was firm and flavorful. Both mains were served with a nice side salad and dressing and arrived together.

The service was friendly and quick, they had ample seating, some seating even had a charging station for laptops and phones. The restrooms were clean and we liked that they quickly cleared the tables after guests left, which we appreciated even though it was fairly quiet since it was early afternoon. There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy a meal surrounded by dirty tables/dishes.

We definitely want to try the Vol au Vent and the Kouign Amann based on the other reviews we read. We even left with a baguette for later.  I wanted to rate 4.5 stars, and would've rated 5 if the Croque Madame had more bechamel and had been warmer. We'll try to come earlier next time and hopefully it will be spot on.

Cons: Poor customer service, slow, ran out of soup du jour and pesto sauce by 1pm.

My story: 
My first time to Le Belle Terre, I decided on some baked goods to go and the soup du jour and quiche to eat there. When it was my turn to order I picked out my baked goods and I was about to order my meal, when a man walked up and started talking directly to the cashier that was taking my order. The man told the cashier he'd like to order the soup du jour. The cashier diverted his attention from me to the man (with out an ""excuse me"" or the like), took the man's order, and charged the man. When the cashier reverted his attention back to me, (without even acknowledging what had just happened) I said I would like to order the soup. He said that he was sorry but the last of the soup had just been ordered. I asked him if it had been ordered by the man that had rudely interrupted my order and he answered ""I guess so"".

Appalled, I decided to go with the rustic sandwich and no quiche. As I awaited my order, the same cashier approached me and said they were all out of the pesto sauce that came on the rustic sandwich. The sauces available for substitute were mayo and dijon. Seeing as I dislike both, I took him up on his offer to substitute the sauce with spinach. My order was served sans spinach. 

Small gripes: 
They serve water in dainty little plastic cups, which is fine, but there is no place to self-serve water. With no wait service and potential busyness, the prospect of more water becomes more of a problem than anything.

Lastly, their entrance is a set of double doors. The left door is locked yet there is no mention of it anywhere. A ""Please use other door"" would better serve customers trying to enter.",pSEsNgsyvR8tUjQ4ImFMAg,4,2,2,e57Kb370ZhCyU99UJwRURg

I'm not exaggerating when I say everything was delicious. I got a couple of cannele and, having never had one before, wasn't sure what to expect. Holy cow, they were SO GOOD.

The kids ate croissants. They large, flakey and buttery on the inside. The Florentine quiche was so good last time I got it again and the salmon quiche. 

Everything is made on site, daily. You can taste the difference too. I'm a sucker for quiche. If it's on the menu I'm typically ordering it. Panera has good quiche. La Belle has elite quiche. All of the ingredients are present and forward. That's the best I can describe it. They warm them up if you want. I recommend it. It takes 6 minutes. And then, the cheese oozes. So good. 

I should mention they serve Peet's Coffee. Next time I come, I'm trying the crepes.",i7ei6g4AR-PYlR743xw01Q,0,0,5,MFCTdRCrSEX8YCsQL6o6Qg

The canales are my favorite pastry and the civilized coffee is wonderful break from the usual coffee-in-a-disposable cup orders our country has gotten accustomed to. The paninis and crepes are fantastic. 
The staff is very friendly and prompt. 

They have a lovely patio and the indoor ambiance is very quiant.

It's also a great place to take your mom for lunch or a pastry.

My only criticism (although not worth a lower rating) is that the cold sandwiches are a bit bland so I would suggest the hot options.",YnPcEeg_oz6cB4vI_D8OKg,0,0,5,npZBHLsT0s_nZ1dB1aqL5A

So many option - please, please, please don't screw it up !  Post gym visit, not too far from La Belle and I've been craving the Croque Madame.

Ordered:

Croque Madame ( $9.50) - still a winner !  The amazing sour dough bread, ham, cheese, mustard, egg, etc  - extremely rich and full of flavor - good choice.

Chocolate chip cookie w/pecans($1.05) - a little iffy - decent flavor especially the chocolate, but the texture was off for me.  If someone said it was a day old cookie, I'd believe it.

Carrot Cake ( $4.50) - looked very rich and flavorful and given I could have had a piece of cake at Manon for the same price yet double the size, I had high expectations. It had a spice cake taste to it and I like the cream cheese frosting was lightly sugared but dang it, the cake was dry ... how is that possible ?!

No doubt the Croque will bring me back but the other options are narrowing",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,6,4,4,NvaOxka6plsB_qd0tUmBuA

1296296,2017-04-18,8,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"This was my first time here and asked several friends for brunch on April 9. The food was average for American French food. I have been to France many times, so maybe my expectations are a bit high but yes, average. I have been to other French bakeries in Vegas that are indeed better.

As for my experience and service here, it was way below average! You can read my fellow Yelp Elite brunchers reviews, Christie L. and Kevin L, to back up my claim.

 I ordered a Croque Madame ($10.95) Medium Caramel Cafe Late ($4.05) and a fruit tart ($4.90)- I called for confirmed pricing. I asked the? man behind the counter to choose a dessert, he said the ""Fruit tart"". This is important to my story. 

I got my food in a timely manner with the exception of the fruit tart. Kevin L. got in line to order and asked about my tart, response of they were making it. That made no sense, since it was in the display case. 1.5 hours later, still no tart. I asked, who I assumed was the manager about it when he came to our table. That's when things got interesting or as my other table mates said ""INTENSE?!"".

The man who I assumed was the manager went to the counter, came back and asked for my receipt. I searched in my purse while he started to go a bit agro along with my friends teasing me to clean out my bag. I saw him making hand gestures pointing to himself than to me. I was a bit shocked when he said ""You need the proof of receipt because? it's your fault!"" I am not joking! My other friends can confirm what was said. He walked to the other table and I could see him in the corner of my eye, my friends were saying how horrible service was, bad reviews, he shouldn't talk to me like that, etc. He came back and started acting as if he was doing me a favor by saying ""You didn't pay for this but I am doing you a favor and giving it to you"" ""Your welcome!"" I explain to him what was said during my order and I requested no receipt since I payed with a card. I remembered that after that Initial bombing of words. I got the tart and he was trying to be super nice telling me a story and asked why I looked sad. Whatever!

We all left, went to another French Bakery and discussed what happened. I looked at my credit card records and found the total of $21.51!! I have proof that I was charged for the fruit tart!!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,27,13,1,_LH23PXfjYJUpLU-Fqmr-A

This Cafe is certainly not French anymore, with Mexicans singing and banging very loudly in the kitchen (which is open and on full view) with many things on their menu not available, they don't even have cookies, quiche or French macaroons anymore, and the quality of their cakes has gone drastically downhill. Anything I order takes soo long to get, and the cafe clearly doesn't have air conditioning anymore, so I have to sit outside where it's cooler, the young filipino waitress is great, but she must get embarrassed serving this food, I just can't eat here anymore.
The size of coffee changes depending on who serves you.

First thing i notice when i enter? A variety of various fresh baked breads and goods all laid out behind the glass for your eyes to drool over... and stomach to rumble to... ;_; Second thing noticed??? PEET'S COFFEE ! O.O ! Hello. Those from the bay would recognize it easily. I'm not from the bay but a pretty frequent visitor and i love their coffee ! I tend to opt for Peet's over Starbucks if i'm in the bay =X that's pretty good right? XD 

1st time, i had the Croque Madame, Peet's Coffee. For those who do not know, a Croque Madame is a classic ham and cheese sandwich with a bechamele (spell check) sauce and a fried egg on top. sounds amazing no? their variation is pretty good. If anything, i think i prefer it over the one from Payard's Patisserie and Bistro inside the Caesar's Palace !  

2nd time, i got the Rustic Sandwich, Peet's Coffee, and Strawberry & Nutella Crepe. Rustic sandwich is a simple sandwich in a baguette with thinly sliced prosciutto, thick slices of mozzarella, topped with a nice light pesto sauce. Really nice combination, in my opinion. The saltiness from the prosciutto together with the subtle flavor of the mozzarella and pesto is well done. And ! its fairly healthy too ! or id like to think so anyway. 

Really nice place to go for a nice coffee and a snack or even a nice meal. Prices are fairly decent and reasonable. Decent amount of sitting space.

1636809,2014-12-30,2,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"Cute café offering a nice warm feel to start your day!  

They serve Peet's Coffee which is one of my favorite brands.  On this occasion I tried their Vanilla Latte and was given the choice of a paper cup or mug which I thought was nice because it definitely makes a difference with taste for me.

The coffee was delicious! And to go with my coffee I ordered a Pain au Chocolat which was also delicious puff pastry filled with chocolate.  

We also waited for their famous Cannelles to come out of the oven which had approximately 35 minutes to go, but when they did come out they were burnt.  No other way to look at these or taste them.  I like burnt but these were just uneatable.  They were bitter and a shame to sell as is.   

We also tried their Kougin Amann, both chocolate and original.  Both were good but a little on the hard side.  Then I tried my sisters Quiche which none of us could finish.  It had a foul cheese taste and was not even warmed up thoroughly. 

The place like I said is cute, with nice seating and a good view into the kitchen, but was a little disappointed on this occasion.   The service from the cashier was also a little on the short side and not welcoming at all (older man with glasses).   I left craving a good Cannelle so hopefully on my next visit, all these oversights are taken care of and I can enjoy my experience and update this review with a  more positive one.

1694638,2017-04-10,3,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"Abysmal. 

Let me preface: I'm French-American, so I know my scene, and this was was an absolute disgrace to my people. It's shit like this that give ugly Americans and uppity Frenchies their undeserved reputations. We're good people, but these select few are ruining things for the rest of us. Also, this is why Yelpers need to stop inflating reviews. Dining should be simple: order, receive, STFU, enjoy. 3stars for that perfectly average experience. When it's *not* that simple, this is an example of how bad it can be. It's absurd. Read on. 

I've been here three times and was looking for one more visit to round out my review. It was going to be a 3-star, an a-ok-nothing-wrong but nothing memorable location as the service is always frantic no matter how few people are in shop, with staff visibly unsure of who is supposed to be doing what. 
Food is often mild, borderline tasteless, and overpriced for the old-school cheat of fattening you up on bread and serving bottom-bin iceberg lettuce for your side salad. My standard black coffee and croissant was a solid 3--just too bitter like it had been sitting on the pot for some time or cheap grounds used, and the croissant while moist in the middle was crunchy on the outside, not flaky, i.e., baked with too much moisture or too high a temperature. 
The seating area is cramped, not cozy. That point will be of special importance here in a minute. 

SO LET'S GET TO THE MEAT OF THE MATTER. I came here with Trixie N. and several other YelpElites for a Sunday brunch. See her review for the full monty, but I'll add my confirmation and perspective. While ordering my breakfast, I inquired for Trixie about her missing fruit tart dessert which she had ordered (see credit card evidence to the fact).  When I asked the man at the register, he asked what her order number was. 
""Twenty,"" I said. I watched him turn around, look at the receipt that was still on the board with a big fat 20 written on it, he looked back to me in agreement, and said, ""they're working on that in the back and it'll be out soon."" Ok, great!

An hour later as we eat slow, it's time for dessert. No fruit tart. So I ask the dude who looks like the manager. Per Trixie's review, instead of apologizing or investigating or assuming the customer is right, he begins to berate her in front of the entire restaurant, gesticulating and repeating, ""this is YOUR fault,"" while laughing.  
Who the fk does that? That guy. NO exaggeration, he begins to point at her, JABBING his finger, REACHING across our cramped table to do so, causing a scene unlike any I've witnessed in a restaurant ever. Everyone can hear; everyone is watching. Over a GD fruit tart. 

At that point, I put my hand on his shoulder and said, ""hey listen, friend, I told that guy over there at the register--and he confirmed--that it was ordered and on its way."" He looked up, went over to talk to the guy at the register, and 'lo, a fruit tart then appeared. But, not without some additional snide remarks about how generous he was being, and some meandering bullshit story about how it's important to smile on Sundays (is the man an ass or just utterly socially inept?), and then he apologized for some 5-minutes straight while we sat waiting for this unwelcome dude to just leave us the hell alone. GO AWAY. Eventually he did. But sorry dude: too little, too late. 

That was beyond repulsive. I'll never be back and while I know this place has its fanbase, I'll do my part to end the party. 

Mediocre food. 
Expensive for what you get.
Cramped interior. 
Service sucks, from top to bottom.

The cannele's were burnt & this seems to be an ongoing issue here. I would think this should be a really easy fix. So far things aren't great and on top of that the order taker shouldn't be taking anyone's order. Zero personality & definitely didn't want to be there. 

Luckily the crepe was really great. Cooked perfectly with crispy edges & soft in the middle with a perfect balance of ham & Gruyere. Loved the crepe! 

The displays are very nice & I will say that everything looked amazing. I am very into Parisian anything & I felt like this place lacked in charm , decor & overall atmosphere.

I came here with a couple of hours to kill in between job interviews. I told the gentleman behind the counter that it was my first time ever being there and if he could recommend anything. He laughed and said, ""Just about anything."" 

I had seen the reviews on the danishes so I opted for a Cheese Danish and an Almond Croissant along with a Hot Chocolate. My first bite of the Cheese Danish was heaven. It was flaky and warm but had that delicious cheese center that I had been craving for YEARS. No joke - I wolfed that bad boy down. The Hot Chocolate was delicious. It was a bit on the thick and rich side - just how I like it. I saved the Almond Croissant for later (to eat wth my family with afternoon coffee). It was generously packed with the delicious almond filling and the almond slivers on top were far from sparse. The fact that I had to split it with my family made me bitter (lol) and made me wished I had bought more. 

The bakery had plenty of room for seating - both inside and out. It was clean and I encountered only friendly, smiling faces while there.

http://southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php

Guess what??? They received a grade of B.  Not A.  They have 14 demerits (i.e. offenses, faults, censures).  3 of those are in ""contamination""; 3 more are in ""handwashing"".  This was what I wrote in April 2015.

Here is one new complaint I have after visiting them this week.

The pastry shop uses a touchpad as a sales register.  When the customer pays by credit card, as I did, one has to sign with one's own fingers on the touchpad.  Imagine the last customer(s) with a nasty flu virus, an infectious disease like MERS, ebola, or e. coli bacteria.  Many viruses have a life span of at least two weeks.  Let's say La Belle Terre has 50 card-paying customers a day.  That's 700 customers in the last two weeks.  Suppose only 1 out of 100 carried in their fingers one of those viruses/bacteria I mentioned.  Hmmm... that's 7 customers who could be giving you what they have.  Good luck!  Hope your immune system is strong enough to fight that off. 

Last time I posted here that the baker (bald, wears dark glasses, 5'5"" height approx) touched his smartphone screen with his fingers and proceeded to touch every raisin roll in the basket, without washing his hands or wearing gloves or using pastry papers  to do so.

But the food was again less than stellar. Opted for a couple baked treats and a specialty dish. Kouign aman and cannele did not seem all that fresh, and the puff pastry-chicken dish was pretty but completely unseasoned. A sprinkle of salt made a huge improvement, and I'm not one who typically salts my food in the first place. Food was average, wouldn't be my first pick in the area.

Service was okay. They were quite busy, but the staff behind the counter helping with pastries didn't seem familiar with what was out, and were corrected several times to grab the right items by people around me in line.

We've learned to visit this shop early - La Belle Terre frequently sells out of many items earlier in the day, and they close at 6pm, so we make a point to visit either in the morning or during our lunch break.

Their baguettes and other breads are consistently delicious.  Most of the pastries are also very good, though I did recently have a pain au chocolat that was very dry and seemed a bit stale.  The management has recently changed hands and none of the original workers seem to still be around, probably explaining the dip in both quality of the food and in service.  Hopefully, the new management will learn their way around the menu and cash register sooner than later.

The lady that helped us when we first showed up was nervous because the staff member that does the front line wasn't there yet.

She and the male owner had a heated conversation and we took our stuff outside to wait for our food.  
My daughter got the raspberry cinnamon roll and it was delicious.  It wasn't doughy like American cinnamon rolls.  It had an almost croissant like texture and the bottom appeared to have been dipped in a raspberry liquid.  It wasn't overwhelmingly raspberry which was nice.

I got:

- White chocolate crème brûlée - It was premade, so no crunchy top layer. Despite that fact, the flavor was just spot on! It was rich in flavor, yet light on taste. It is hard to describe, really.

- Raspberry chocolate mousse - I was trying to choose between the cheesecake and this...and the manager was very definitive about his recommendation. I thought the raspberry flavor was a bit much (thick, raspberry jam-like), but the chocolate mousse was wonderful. Again, a premade item which tastes like it has been sitting in the case for a while.

- Iced coconut macadamia latte - It was very good. Refreshing. Might be more so in the dead of summer (we were here close to New Year's).

Score! - the earth is truly beautiful! (4).

The very first time we came to check out La Belle Terre we got there at opening. They'd barely pulled out the pastries and buns from the oven and we were eager to satisfy our carbaholic cravings. 

We ordered a small sugared brioche, an almond galette, a pain au chocolat and a quiche. As soon as we got those items in our hand, we dug right on it while the pastries were slightly warm and oh so delish!

The pain au chocolat was nicely flaky with the chocolate slightly molten on the inside. Just the way it should be. If you notice in the pics, there's no sagging in the middle of the pastry because of the even layering of butter and pastry dough.  The almond galette had tons of almond filling inside which is a major plus - I love almond filling. Again, the puff pastry held up with despite the filling inside. The blueberry strudel was really good and not overly sweet. The small sugared brioche was amazing - that lovely eggy buttery goodness fresh out of the oven was really wonderful.

The only thing that wasn't up to par was the quiche lorraine. Although the flavors were okay, the crust didn't hold up to the moist filling and was soggy. I would not recommend getting the quiche here.

Round two - we tried the Napoleon and a loaf of fig/walnut bread. 

The fig/walnut bread was okay but I felt the texture was a little too dense for me and could use a little more figs and walnuts.

The Napoleon was pretty good - nice pastry cream with the layers of flaky pastry but not too sweet - although I feel like the previous pastries we'd tried the first time we came was better.

Added to the things to try are the soups and sandwiches here.

In addition to serving up some pretty good pastries, they also serve Peet's Coffee & Teas here which is a major plus. They also have free WiFi with a nice long power bar to plug in your electronic devices while you surf, sip and nibble your morning/afternoon away. What a neighborhood gem!

2250599,2013-01-20,2,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"I popped by La Belle Terre (""The Beautiful Land,"" en francais, but you knew that) with no expectations other than I wanted some bread.

""Wow, it's big,"" I thought as I parked the car, checked in on my phone, noted the Yelp check-in deal, and cast a dour look across the parking lot at a certain popular bakery that hadn't impressed me in the past. ""Good omen or bad omen?"", I wondered.

The interior of LBT is just gorgeous. A display case that runs almost the length of the store, surrounded by gleaming wood everywhere, and an open kitchen behind it all where you can watch the baked goods being prepared. Ooo.

I was immediately dismayed to see that they were out of the dark chocolate bread with walnut, but missing out on popular items is always the risk that comes with visiting a bakery in the afternoon. Foolish me!

I settled for a regular baguette, a loaf of garlic and sundried tomato, two tarts (lemon and chocolate/raspberry mousse), and - oh my - a mini quiche ratatouille. (Do you know how difficult it can be to find a vegetarian quiche that isn't ""cheese 'n broccoli""?)

One of the men working there offered to heat the quiche up, but alas I wasn't staying. I spoke to both guys for awhile and was really impressed with their passion for their products. Everything certainly looked good, and portions were generous.

At home later, the two tarts didn't last long. Light and flavourful, both of them. The quiche went on standby for a couple of days but was still very nice after a trip to the microwave. (A little soggy, but I'm sure that was my fault for waiting.)  Not too eggy, not too heavy, and not so overladen with vegetables that the cheese didn't get noticed.

Both loaves of bread went into the fridge right away, wrapped. The next morning I reached for the baguette and was shocked to find a long rock instead. Grumbling, I put it back and didn't touch it again until the next day, when I sprinkled it with a little water and put it in the microwave. That resuscitated it (for small amounts, eaten a bit quickly), and I could tell it would've been quite delicious if I'd had it the same day.

The garlic/sundried tomato loaf was a six-dollar mishap for me, though. I took it out of the fridge a few hours after coming home and pulled off a little piece to taste it. ""Jeez, that's dense!"" The garlic and tomato certainly smelled nice, but I really didn't care for the bread itself; it seemed so tasteless. That might be just my prejudice against bread with a tight crumb and soft crust, but to me this tasted like a black hole and a slice of Wonder Bread had a baby then sprayed it with garlic perfume. 

But again, judging by everything else, it's clear that La Belle Terre knows what it's doing, so don't let my one thumbs-down moment scare you away. With such a spacious, lovely interior, airy sweets, and a staff genuinely excited about what they're doing, overall I give LBT a very solid thumbs up.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,0,0,4,B7Vl6IHmdJStQyIxiERBkQ
2263314,2013-02-05,1,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"This is a necessary review update to eat my words, since I keep eating LBT's amazing sourdough, kouign amann, and...coffee macarons! Earlier, I stated that this wasn't a macaron place, so as not to leave macaron-seekers disappointed (some people leave crappy reviews because they can't get their macaron fix or if they painfully realize that ""soup du jour"" doesn't meant ""soup everyday"", and that's just wrong.) 

It started with pink heart-shaped macarons with fresh raspberries for Valentine's Day, and now it seems that assorted flavors of macarons are taking a place in the display case! I selected a coffee flavor (pistachio and raspberry were also available) for $1.20. It was medium-sized with perfectly chewy cookies, delectable coffee buttercream, and an invisible sign stating ""made fresh this morning."" On a more disappointing note, my beloved cannele had the taste and appearance of yesterday's leftovers. I truly missed the crisp, caramelized exterior.

They've also recently introduce kouign amann, and I would pick this version over Bouchon's, every time. When available, the French Onion soup is vegetarian (no meat stock) and a great choice on a cold day. The shredded Gruyere mixes nicely into the buttery soup base. I never leave without some bread, and I haven't encountered a disappointing loaf so far. If the sourdough baguettes are sold out, I've opted for the 2 lb. sourdough or a Parisien; both are larger and last at least an extra day in my house. LBT's sourdough is the best I've ever tried. It has a remarkable, bubbly crust and an addictive sour flavor.

I also enjoyed the Baby Rasta, an original chocolate meringue cookie sandwich topped with (vanilla) meringue ""dreadlocks"".  Magnifique!

It's so small and closes early, so if you work hours like I do I suggest going in the morning or on a weekend. It's worth the time! I feel like the employee looked at me a little sideways when I tried to pronounce the food - which is not only okay with me but PROOF of the delicious authenticity of their food! 

I could not figure out what to order from the menu because it wasn't super clear. That could be an area of improvement, but for now I suggest checking out Yelp pics to see what looks good. I was with two of my friends, we all ordered something different, and everything was stellar. I really don't think you could go wrong with anything they sell here! My sandwich was so big I could hardly finish. The only thing I would change is I got my sandwich with a egg on top and if I did it again I think I would skip the egg. However, my partner wanted my egg anyway so I gave it to him and it all turned out great. The side salad is basically lettuce with a honey mustard type dressing and I was a fan! After we ordered we sat at a  small table by the window. The real light in this place from the giant windows is so nice! 

I also got a vanilla latte which was to die for! They delivered it to the table as well as the rest of our food. When we were done they instructed us to leave the mess on the table and they would get it. I like that service at a cafe! All in all, service and food are both amazing.

Must have had my invisible clothes on this morning when I arrived here for Sunday breakfast with my Dad.
We make it a habit every weekend to try 1 new place to eat (steered by our trusty Yelp app).
Stepped up to the counter and cheerfully greeted the stoic cashier gentleman with glasses with a ""Good Morning! It's our first time here"" as I showed him my Yelp check in from my phone.
He seemed unaffected and zombie like looking at me like-just order and move-on. I gave my order (Paris crepes, breakfast sandwich and 2 medium Peet's coffees $15)-I mentioned that we'd like both coffees with creme and one with sugar. He peered over the rim of his glasses and glared, outstretched his arm and gave the point to a   station across w/milk, sugar etc.  I said oh thanks ! We were given a number card and left to seat ourselves.
We waited and waited watching the people who were in front of us be served, a gentleman who came in after us and still no coffee.
I thought to myself, shouldn't we have coffee? And why would we have it delivered only to have to get up and leave our food to go cold while we prepped our coffee? I saw people getting their coffee immediately after ordering and thought to go ask if our coffees were on the way.
The same annoyed man (no one was inline) looked up and essentially turned his back as I was asking about the coffee-thankfully a nice young man acknowledged me, apologized and gave me 2 coffees. Back I went to the seat...where I waited and waited and again went to the counter to inquire about our order as we watched 3 more tables get served. Well, it seems Mr. Personality didn't even put our ticket up to be made-and it's not like he had to go far our stretch too much-he had to simply turn around.
Again the individuals who made an attempt to resolve and apologize for the situation had nothing to do with the situation and more than likely in guessing the one who did-are the owners. His wife in the kitchen who tells me-it only takes a couple of minutes to make the crepe and sandwich-ok great, then why has mine taken 30 minutes?
The two busboys were kind enough to bring a basket of assorted goods to apologize (again, not their fault).  Great effort on their part-major fail on the owners.
Will I go back?...tbd...I go to Manon and chocolate & spice-and there are more out there yet to try.
Sad because the crepes were good, bread delicious and the cookies we were given delishhhh-unfortunately I tend to frequent places that greet me with the same smile I give them.",huXqrSaGyNO1aZKiM55EUg,8,0,3,Ci4IsfJrwg4MfXPQKG6VHw

Ordered to go some chocolate croissants and fruit tart, lemon tart, chocolate raspberry mousse. 

The crepe skin was so good, smooth not too thick. It was just perfect. The filling were delicious. The cream of mushroom crepe was so freaking good, so does with the Paris crepe, the poached egg on top was cooked perfect too. Paris crepe was basically ham & Swiss cheese with poached egg, it was super cheesey. 

The chocolate croissant was so good, flaky but not too flaky that made fell apart all over, and the chocolate inside was much too, not skimpy at all like the famous pricey pastry that I had from one French patisserie. 

The fruit tart was freaking good! The fruit on top were so fresh, the colors were beautiful. The tart itself was very good. 

The lemon tart was very good too, lemony and creamy. The chocolate raspberry mousse was very tasty, rich and creamy  chocolate mixed with raspberry flavor and top with raspberry fruit & a chocolate bar. And the taste wasn't over crazy sweet.

We ordered the croque madame and croque monsieur. They came out hot, fresh and looked great. The bread was toasted to perfection and so fresh! Super crisp but fluffy at the same time. You can really taste the fresh baked bread difference and it's incredible. Also, both dishes came with a small side of mix salad with a creamy balsamic dressing. 

The flavor profile for both dishes were for the most part, the same, with tiny differences. The croque madame came with a beautiful fried egg on top of a melty ham and cheese sandwich with béchamel sauce. On the other hand, the croque monsieur was like a grilled bubbling ham and cheese sandwich. Both tasted great, but my favorite was the croque Madame as it was juicier and more moist from the creamy béchamel and the runny egg.

One day when we happened to be up super early (like 5:00am), we thought hey it would be a good time to try this place out for breakfast and pastries.  We got there a little after 7am and ordered a Montmontre Chicken Crepe and Bacon Quiche.  I enjoyed my crepe, it was a large portion and very cheesy.  My husband liked his quiche and said he would want to go back and try something else on the savory menu.

We then ordered a Bunch of pastries to go, and the selection looked really amazing.  We got canneles, pistachio bun, chocolate croissant, almond chocolate croissant, chocolate twist, and 2 chocolate pudding/mousse desserts.  I mean, we spent like over $40 on just the pastries not including our breakfast order.  

Unfortunately, they did not seem fresh at All.  I think we are used to flaky, buttery french croissants from bakeries.... In fact, my husband has a family member that's a baker and he always said that the test of a good croissant is in the layers and the flakiness.  All of these pastries had the texture of squishy bakery items that are sold from Hostess or something in plastic packages.  Even the chocolate twist!  So every single baked item we bought was squishy and not flaky and did not taste fresh, and maybe overly sweet.  The chocolate mousse desserts unfortunately were also a little too sweet for me, and didn't really taste like a silky smooth real-ish chocolate.  My husband and I are dessert lovers but we couldn't even finish these and ending throwing them away.  And the canneles were completely burned and Black on the bottom like we've seen from other reviewers. Maybe it's supposed to be like that?

So the two stars are for the savory food, we thought it was solid. I couldn't give more stars because of the disappointment  in the baked goods. It's too bad because they looked really appetizing and they did a good job in presenting the dessert case.  

For a flaky flaky croissant, so far the best I've had here is Jean Phillippe at Aria Hotel.... amazing croissants especially the almond croissant!",vh8v72MaEqUCsNwWsslibg,8,3,2,RMsFQmZA6kX6HuYbngOyww

I was informed before-hand that the quiche items on the menu were really good, so most of my attention was directed towards those items as I browsed the menu. Upon asking the man working the register about some of the items he didn't seem to be too knowledgeable, particularly when I asked about the quiche items. He was nice however, and offered a coffee while I waited for my comrade to show up.

I ended up ordering the bacon quiche with a salad on the side. Absolutely loved it! Altogether this is a nice quaint little place with plenty of seating for their business volume. The true score for this business earns somewhere between a 4 and 5, however Yelp doesn't do non-integers for their reviews, only whole numbers or non-negative integers; and I'm a round-down kinda guy.

3409072,2015-12-27,1,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"*this was a draft review started a month ago** 

Yesterday I was greeted by a red hair woman with a super friendly demeanor seemed knowledgable in their menu items. I ordered the Quiche Florentine with a half mocha & white chocolate mocha ice espresso and a coffee flavored eclair for dessert. I obviously got overexcited and my total turned out to be $17. I would say their menu is just a teeny bit on the pricey side but I definitely think it's worth it. They don't use microwaves here which I think is totally cool. They have tons of desserts ranging from colorfully assorted macaroons to tiramisu, different kinds of tart, and cheesecake! This is a bakery in addition to a cafe, so they also sell various types of baguettes, pastries, and coffee beverages. 

I saw someone else's review, and they had a hair in their food so, fingers crossed that it wouldn't happen to me! As I finished my order, seating was readily available but it's good that I ordered when I did because suddenly there was a long line! And that red haired woman is the one taking orders, making the beverages and also prepping the baguette orders! My table beside the bottled drinks fridge was a little dirtied from a previous customer but I wiped it away.

Their Quiches are delicious! They don't use microwaves here, did I mention that already? My food was fresh & so, so tastey! Their iced espresso drinks could be a little bit better though. It would be a perfect combo to sit out on their patio with my quiche and a really good mocha espresso, but it seems their espresso machine/coffee lacks in taste.

The chocolate almond croissant is even better if you've got a craving for sweets like I do. It's got enough chocolate to satisfy that morning craving, but subtle enough so you won't regret it. The pain au chocolat ($2.70) and apple turnover ($2.70) are great too -- light, buttery and flakey.

I'm not as crazy about the sandwiches. The rustic sandwich was too much bread and not enough filling. It was pretty good on that rare bite when you get the perfect ratio of ingredients in one bite, but more often than not each bite was nothing but bread.

3520230,2017-04-11,33,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"I've been here a few times over the years and the food has always been hit or miss and the service has always been lacking in many areas. My visit the day before yesterday was not by my choice, it was a friend who suggested we meet up here for brunch. As I walked inside it was the same chaotic mess with customers all over and the tables and chairs cramped together. I had to move my chair several times just so the people sitting behind me could get by and the other side of the table was too close to the ordering line. You place your order at the register and then they give you a number to place on your table and they bring the order out. The guy who took my order seemed clueless as to the menu and prices listed. I ordered a strawberry Crepe with chocolate and toasted almonds and he added on each topping as an extra and when I told him that the menu clearly says it's $7, he actually went to get another employee to show them my order and then they were complaining in front of me about who was right. He then was told to correct the amount because the menu price was right and he suggested I get my order to-go. WTF?! I told him that I was eating here with a group of friends and he said ok. He then gives me my receipt and the other guy says he needs it back to complete my order. Very weird. 

It's worth noting that the original owners of La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café now own Delices Gourmands French Bakery on Sahara. Not sure if Gourmands has any ties with La Belle, but a lot of the pictures on yelp for both places show some of the food plated the same. Both use Peet's Coffee yet Gourmands was by far fresher tasting. 

White Chocolate Mocha ($4.35 for large) - I'm not sure why, but my drink was put in a to-go cup and they were not out of regular cups because other people at my table who ordered before and after me were given normal cups. It's not like it makes the drink taste different, but it seems like the guy who took my order did it on purpose since he suggested I get my order to-go. They use Peet's Coffee, which I have no problem with if it tastes drinkable. This mocha tasted burnt and not fresh at all. It also wasn't very hot. Not worth the price tag.

Don't let the size of the croissants fool you, it was hollow inside. Not flaky and not worth it.

Croque Madame ($10.95) - Sourdough bread, dijon, bechamel, swiss, ham and melted swiss on top is what the menu describes, but not exactly what I got. This was a poor excuse for what they call a Croque Madame. The bread was so hard and crunchy and while a cheese crust is legit for this type of dish, it's not meant to be rock hard. I was given a fork and butter knife for my meal and that dull butter knife wasn't ""cutting"" it. There was some melted cheese in between the bread, but there was absolutely no melted cheese on the top and the bechamel sauce was really lacking. On my plate was also a basic salad and some potatoes that others at my table liked, but I personally found to be too overpowering with dill and mustard flavor. 

My hubby had a strawberry crepe and he was disappointed with the 2 measly strawberry pieces they put on top. Crepe was cooked nice, but needed more berries for sure. As if all of this wasn't disappointing enough, there was more to come. My friend (she's written her review and posted a picture of proof of what she paid for) ordered before any of us and she asked the employee to suggest a dessert for her. He said the Fruit Tart, so she went with that. After some time went by another friend went up to the register to ask about the fruit tart and the guy says after looking at the receipt that they are prepping it in the back. This was odd to us because the fruit tarts were right there in the case, but we still chatted and waited. After a longggggg time my friend still had no fruit tart! When asking about it again one of the guys started waving his arm across our table pointing at my friend saying that it's her fault if she doesn't have a receipt. He wouldn't shut up and just kept very loudly repeating that she needed to find the receipt because if she didn't have it for proof that it was all her fault and not his. I as well the rest of the people around me were all stunned at this guys behavior. After he heard us discussing our frustration and another friend telling him that they were aware she paid for it and was getting it ready for her, he brings out a fruit tart and tells her very loudly that he wants her to know that she did not pay for it, but he was being generous and giving it to her free and then says ""you're welcome"" as he's handing it to her. My heart broke for my friend as she clearly didn't deserve to be treated like that. Nobody does! There are far better options not only around town, but nearby. I will never be back and if someone suggests this place, I'll explain why I must pass.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,63,49,1,orvCvZ_kUEGnwcvnhI11mw

La Belle Terre was one of the places we ate that I keep thinking about weeks later.  This was my first time here and we went here for brunch, late morning on a weekend so some of the pastry choices were already out.  What we did get to have was a Chocolate twist, Hazelnut roll, Pain au chocolat, and an Almond chocolate croissant, they were all delicious.  The roll had a soft, not overly sweet, dough and the croissants had a buttery, lightly crisp and flaky pastry filled with tasty goodness.  I especially liked the Almond Chocolate croissant with its sliced almond and chocolate drizzle on top and almond paste and the melted bittersweet dark chocolate chunks in the filling...heavenly, decadent and satisfying.

I also had the Montmartre crepe which has chicken, swiss cheese, goat cheese, spinach, onions, and béchamel (I ordered without onions.)  This was also very delicious, nice and creamy from the cheeses and béchamel, and the not-so-heavy taste of the chicken and spinach.  One thing La Belle Terre does with their crepes is before they flip the crepe, they sprinkle on some cheese (I think cheddar) so the cheese crisps up in the batter when they flip it...it adds a bit of sharpness to the crepe and is very tasty.

There are many more things I want to try here and I'll be over in Vegas in a couple of weeks so I'll surely be here to try some and adding inches to my waist.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,4,4,4,sjh4W1Dp4Ro08m9RV_wc8A

To name a few favorites: everything and the bread. 

Croissants are rich and delicious; always fresh. The quiche are very tasty but I only like the vegetarian kind. 

Their coffee is actually quite good and much better than the chain brand... Ahem *bucks. The teas are always great although I only buy iced tea because I have the biggest and baddest stash of teas at home but never have the patience to make iced tea. 

Sandwiches are HUGE and made with quality ingredients -- like a boss sandwich should be. The selection is limited, however. 

The breads are fresh and absolutely amazing. I know some people who will drive 20 minutes to this bakery just to pick up their bread stash.

If you're in the Summerlin area, you gotta stop by and get a hot vanilla latte and a chocolate croissant. That's the stuff dreams are made of.

I've been coming here for several years, as does my brother, and friends. We often bring friends or grab items to go for self and others. I've had most of the breads and pastries, Sooo tasty...the best fruit tarts, almond croissants in town. The crepes are light and flavorful. The sandwiches and salads tasty and fresh. I've valued the staff being very friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, organized; dining area tidy and clean even in rush, especially with Pierre present. The past several times I've visited I've noticed a change....some of the staff appears new, not as friendly or knowledgeable and things don't appear as organized (eg, had problems with orders, placing it paying and later finding item was not available; staff not knowing menu, the pleasant engaging personalities not present; sandwich placed on baguette instead of brioche bread), someone I know reported the same, having problems with the standard orders they're used to making and staff not as pleasant (eg quiche usu comes with salad, senior staff relaying just not to include it until the person pushed the issue, staff not as friendly; I see now there is a change in offerings and pricing). I've also noticed Pierre is no longer there; Pierre  created a very positive upbeat and professional atmosphere and appeared to foster it in staff; very engaging with customers and knowledgeable about the menu and food. I'm hoping that the recent changes get ironed out and things return to the atmosphere I've grown to love over time; transitions sometimes take time, new staff often need time to grow and learn.

I found Pierre ( how appropriate his name) the manager to be a grumpy and unpleasant person. When I asked him if his quiches were prepared fresh daily, he appeared to be insulted and became slightly hostile. Wow. It was just a question Pierre. Relax. I ask this of every bakery I visit all around the world. Then I asked him to make me something off the menu and honestly, I've had better breakfasts at McDonalds. The restaurant was full of flies and my friend got a sun burn as their shades in the windows are horrible. I definitely will not be back not would I recommend this establishment.

Things to order...
-Pain au chocolat
-Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie
-Blueberry cream twist 

Last but definitely not least 
Mmmmm...Kouign-amann!!
These pastries are probably the closest thing to heaven you can come into contact with on earth. I think the chef may be an angel sent from god to bless us who live in Las Vegas with delicious Kouign-amanns.

They also have fresh breads, soups, and sandwiches. 
Service is always on point. All of the drinks and pastries were reasonably priced and the selection is great! Something for everyone!

I have been here before for lunch once and it was fine, it obviously didn't wow me enough to come back regularly. This place is around the corner from where I live and I remembered it's French. I got a croissant which was huge.  It was $3.19 with tax which I felt was reasonable. Croissants are very time consuming and complicated to make, so I definitely appreciate the process of making a good one. There's a lot of butter in these suckers, there is nothing healthy about them. For me to consume one it had better be divine. In my opinion these were over done. The outside was so crispy it fell apart. It had a slightly burnt taste to it.  I knew upon seeing them that they were a bit dark for my taste. The middle was very airy, not a lot of substance.  This was a total miss in the croissant and that's what I am basing my review in, a French bakery messing up the quintessential French pastry doesn't bode will for the rest of the pastries which all looked a bit dry and overdone, in my opinion.

Me and my wife went there for brunch on a saturday for the first time and had the french onion soup which was really good also had a couple of quiche's which were awesome. 

The following weekend we went there again brunch on Saturday ordered the onion soup which I was told it was not made,understandable that happens once in a while.Then my wife odered the fig bread again they didnt make it that day ended up having the chili which was really good and bought the garlic/onion bread which was great. Also had the quiche which was awesome.

So Monday rolls around and I'm in the mood for the chili I had the other day so for luch I head there.I get to the counter and order the chili then the cashier tells me they didnt make chili today I get so pissed I leave without getting anything.

On to Wednesday I was in the mood for their chili once more. This time I call to see if they have it and long and behold no chili today! Good thing I didnt waste my time again going there!

Why not make these great things on a daily basis!  Their menu is limited as it is.

But was super impressed with the selection offered and legit bread production going on just behind the counter. Cute and cozy atmosphere and plenty of hearty breads to eye.We ordered a few different sandwiches and an almond croissant. Food was prepared quickly and in one word delicious. Croissants were flaky and just the right of buttery. Bechamel was creamy and seasoned perfectly as well as the egg execution. The reason for a 4 star vs 5 review was all in the details. I ordered a cafe au lait to accompany my food selection. The Peets coffee served in a paper cup did not fit the overall style of the bakery. The plastic plates were not much bigger than the food they held which made for a difficult task of cutting a cheesy saucy crunchy goodness of a sandwich with a butter knife.

French Press Coffee here, with a FP carafe brought out to your table!

Then I remember coming back later that night and being probably the last customer of the night and silly ol' me, by myself, letting him talk again and getting the same spill about their bakery and how everything is made fresh daily yadda yadda.  

But this is what Vegas needs more of, pure and authentic bakeries.  

Fast forward to present day La Belle Terre Bread, now with an actual sign on the building indicating French Bakery Cafe rather than a tarp-like sign hanging against the rail.  Had I written this review the first week they opened I would have needed to note this bakery was in the same complex as Paymon's and Sushi-Mon on W. Sahara.

The quiches come in mushroom with ham, mozzarella with basil and tomato, chicken with goat cheese and spinach, salmon with asparagus, and one with all kinds of veggies in it.  I've had them all and they're alright.

The soups I've had was the buffalo bean soup, love it, and the french onion soup, love it.  You get a french baguette with it.  But for $7 I hope it goes down as the weather gets cooler.  I do love the buffalo bean chili soup though.

Another favorite item of mine, when made fresh or that day is the Croque Monsieur (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-belle-terre-bread-las-vegas?select=1PG53Ltrg6dbg_U7OJjgHg#W5VJQeyWQscRG2MoKsWNdQ) .  If you do get this, get it with a fried egg on top!!  Additional $1 but well worth it.

There are also pastries to choose from inside the cold display cases to choose from but the bread is where it's at.  I've bought a couple loaves and the only other place I like to get loaves is the German Bakery on Lake Mead and the giant on Charleston, Manon.  The croissant I've had better else where but it's still good and even better with my Nutella packets heheheh but the kougin amann is oh so buttery good.  

When on the road, but not necessarily to eat in there, is the chocolate almond croissant!  Have it in a white bag and so while you're eating it on the road some of the almonds and chocolate will fall to the bottom of the bag.  After you're done with the croissant, you can eat the dropped chocolate almonds.  But do come in and try this place out!

This one has no shortage of yummy looking treats and savory dishes. I was impressed by the number of options. 

We tried the croque Madame, Paris crepe, and chocolate croissant. The croque Madame was outstanding. The portion is large! The fluffy crusty bread had the perfect amount of Dijon, cheese and runny yolk. Yum. It can with a nice salad that was drizzled with balsamic. I would much prefer they toss it before plating as it is near impossible to coat it on your plate without knocking everything off. The crepes were light and delicious but cold. The chocolate croissant was excellent and the chocolatiest I've ever had. Hubby was pleased with his cappuccino but I was meh about my caramel latte. It was ok. I would have preferred a real cup for the dine in experience. I only noticed the posters of the seasonal specialty lattes after we had ordered. They were not listed on the menu in the ordering area.

I had the cream of mushroom crepe, an iced white chocolate mocha, a Nutella brioche, and some macarons.

There was literally two workers but everything was served so quickly. There was a cashier and a chef. As soon as I placed my order the cashier made my latte and gave it to me before I sat down! What gives, Starbucks?! It was pretty good too.

I shared my brioche with my cousin and it was really good. It had a generous amount of Nutella in it and was sprinkled with some thick sugar.

Then my crepe came! It was so good. I've only had sweet crepes but I don't think I ever want a sweet crepe again. I believe cheese is sprinkled on the crepe maker before the crepe batter is put on. Then they put sautéed mushrooms with goat cheese on the crepe before folding it over to serve. It was so decadent and rich. I advise sharing. 

I like the the indoor seating and out door seating, I like how they have complimentary lemon water, and I like how their savory foods are really affordable. Their pastries are a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I can have a delicious breakfast, brunch, or lunch here for less than $10.

I was looking for a cake, but they only had single serving pastries/cake slices, so I decided to go with what I felt was the most festive looking treat - the orange pinwheels.  Not only were they pretty, but they were very tasty - flaky, crispy, sweet (but not overly sweet), and tangy.  These treats were well liked and were quite delicious with a cup of hot coffee.  I also got a plain mini croissant and a pistachio roll on the side.  The mini croissant was very flaky and tasty.  The pistachio roll was pretty but didn't have enough pistachio flavor for my taste.

The pastries here run for about $2-$4 each.  They are pretty large, so one pastry with a cup of coffee would be just the right size for breakfast/small snack.  The bakery was pretty crowded when I came by - maybe that's why the cashiers weren't warm and friendly?  They weren't unpleasant, but the service here is nothing to write home about.

This important detail is customer service from the cashier who happens to be the manager. I'm not sure if it's too much to ask for the person working behind the register to greet customers when they put their order in. 

To me this very small but important detail can either make or break your business. And I'm not mentioning it because of one incident. I'm mentioning it, because it's been going on now for a few months.

I personally enjoy taking my money to a place where the staff is happy to serve their customers, especially their regulars. Even though I'm not very pleased with the service from management, I will point out that the 1 barista that I see regularly is a sweetheart.

He is always smiling and seems to take pride in his work and enjoys serving people.

Overall I'm not sure how many more times I'll be coming back here. I guess it all depends if things improve concerning the customer service. Other than that I would recommend this place for a great cup of coffee and unique tasty treats. I've tried several items on their menu and don't have any complaints about their food.

After months of trying to plan a time to come I finally made it. Did I love if? Yep! I love that its a big space with plenty of seating although I did get mine to go. 

What'd I walk out with? Tiramisu cup, cannelles and the pain au chocolat.  

The pain au chocolate was crispy/flaky on the outside and soft inside with the right ratio of chocolate to carbs. Definitely a winner. The tiramisu cup was my favorite. It was sooooo light fluffy, creamy and delicious that I wanted to lick the inside of the cup but I didn't. Now I'm not a big fan of the cannelles but I'm not one for burnt flavor and I just thought it was gonna be soft like custard.

I was visiting some family this weekend, and I promised I would bring some breakfast. I had been surfing Yelp for good breakfast places earlier in the week, and I had already bookmarked this place in anticipation...

First, the ambiance is adorable. It's very french, and many employees in the bakery were speaking to each other in French (and many customers were as well). Made you feel like you were in France picking up some fresh pastries!

Second, the prices are very reasonable! It isn't the cheapest place in the world, but the pastries are very affordable, as are the breads. For 3 bucks you can get most of the pastries (some are a little over $4 though), and you can even get a big baguette for that price. Everything looks perfectly fresh and delicious, and we will definitely be stopping by there for some bread this week!

Lastly, everything was DELICIOUS. Seriously, the cheese danish may have been the best danish I have ever had...and I have had a lot. It was perfectly flakey, the filling was unbelievable, and it was just the right size. The chocolate croissant was equally as amazing. The almond galette was very good, but I am not a huge almond fan. The chocolate twist was also really good, and a good value for the size. However I enjoyed the chocolate croissant more because it had more chocolate inside.

After my hair appointment my hunger led me to La Belle. What a great choice I made. La Belle is French, and down to the core French indeed. It is a bakery/cafe, serving up loaves of bread, sandwiches, soups, salads, and patisseries. I got the turkey, brie, apple, and walnut sandwich on their cibatta bread. The brie was very tangy, not the same 'ol brie you are used to everywhere else. I was actually taken aback by the tanginess of the cheese. Yes, my friends this is *true* French food.

La Belle also serves Peet's coffee and they brew it with their own water. Yes. They have a specialized filtration system that all of their water runs through. I learned this from a ""factoid"" sheet in the bathroom. Well. I'm impressed.

I also left the cafe with two tarts - a blueberry and an apricot which I will be sharing later with my husband. From the looks/smells coming from them I imagine they will be delicious.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,8,4,5,hjfZ_J2QvffZY9bychAtRw

LBT Bread serves a variety of quiche, crepes, salad, sandwich and coffee but what drew my eye was the pastry case. I was so enraptured by all the yummy desserts that I went from being the only one in there to being sixth in line. I didn't mind though, it just gave me more time to take in the beauty of the pastries. I did have an axiety attack as each person ordered and the server headed to the pastry case.

4491425,2014-12-24,3,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"La Belle Terre Bread French Cafe is located in a strip mall on the west side of Las Vegas. It looks unassuming on the outside but when you walk through the door you are welcomed by the beautiful sight of  an array of pastries, cookies and breads. I've been to La Belle a handful of times and have always been delighted with my choices that ranged from sweets to soup. 

This morning I chose the chocolate almond croissant because I haven't had one since my honeymoon years ago. I loved the combined textures of the almonds,  the delicate flakiness of the bread and the creaminess of the chocolate.  I paired it with a caramel latte which was my mistake . The latte was delicious but it was too sweet with the croissant . Luckily in the seating area they have complimentary citrus infused water . I sipped on that until I finished my dessert. The latte was savored while I was reading over articles on how to care for a Hedge Hog. ( I'm deciding whether they would make good pets) . 

The other occasions  I've been here was to buy pastries for Valentine's Day. I appreciated the creativity especially with the Rose jello mold because it is something different that you don't see at the local grocery store. It was too pretty I didn't want to eat it...but we did. 

It is also a great place to hang out with your friends on a chilly day. If you are not a coffee drinker the French Onion Soup was tasty. I appreciated the nice amount of bread and gooey cheese that topped it. 

The atmosphere inside is very relaxed and inviting. You can also grab last minute gifts for the holidays while  getting a cup of coffee. They had peppermint bark, toffee , and specialty coffee for the foodie in your life.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,4,5,_dJKGdjUC0Mnn0aKFLdtTw

As I sat outside enjoying the mild breeze and warm sunshine with another plump blueberry  between my teeth I couldn't help but smile.  Yes, there are still people who care about serving good food.

They're located in the Great American Plaza near Paymon's and Nothing Bundt Cakes. They are currently undergoing an ownership change, but no changes in business or management (which should mean no changes in product either).

It's very quaint and I love the abundance of pastries and breads. There's certainly no shortage in variety. I was absolutely drawn to the five types of quiche! I wanted to try the chicken version, but the gentleman behind the counter forgot to put one in my box (sad face). So, I'll review them on my next visit! Anyway, I took my selections home to share with my fiancé.

Pain Viennois ($5.50) with white chocolate chips and pistachio paste. Very yummy! The bread is soft and chewy. I love the sweetness from the chocolate chips and the pretty green interior!

Kouign Amann ($3.50), pronounced kween-ah-mon, is a traditional cake from the Brittany region of France (originating back to the late 1800's). It's difficult to find and has only recently become popular and available in the states. It's similar to puff pastry since it's made with layers of dough and butter. The texture is chewy, dense, and has a nice crust on it. This was my first time trying one, so there's nothing to compare. It has a nice flavor and it was definitely enjoyable, but we both agreed that it wasn't our favorite pastry.

French Epi-Baguette ($3): It had a nice crust and chewy center, definitely what you want in a baguette. Not my favorite baguette in the flavor department. My measurement is eating it fresh (or lightly toasted) with just a touch of butter. It didn't have me reaching for more.

Almond Croissant: I love open-faced croissants. They're packed with flavor and I love the streusel on top. When I bit into this croissant, it immediately reminded me of marzipan (almond meal, sugar/honey), which set it apart from other almond croissants. Very tasty.

The pastries and bread were surprisingly hit or miss for me, however, everything was still good. It's a little bit of a drive for me, so I'm not sure how frequently I would return. Although, I would like to try their quiche and sandwiches.

4835460,2014-11-27,1,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"While I have come here multiple times for their pastries and bread, I made a recent visit for some brunch.

During a previous visit I saw a couple eating a delicious looking egg/brunch type dish. I asked what they were eating and they said the eggs benedict with a assuring nod of satisfaction.

Fast forward to my recent visit and since I was in the area and hungry, I decided to try the eggs benedict.

When I was about to order it, I saw it was eggs benedict topped with a horseradish sauce instead of a normal hollandaise. Even though I like horseradish I was hesitant of eating it as a sauce for eggs bendict, but I ordered it anyway.

I should have followed my hesitation. Even though there was ham, a croissant, and poached eggs, they only thing I could taste was the horseradish sauce. The sauce was good for what it was, but I was expecting something more traditional for a eggs benedict. I would want the sauce in a roast beef sandwich or something. The side salad that came with my meal was nice, and the house salad that covered it was excellent. It was kinda small though, even though it was the most enjoyable thing I ate I still would have liked more of it even if I had enjoyed the eggs benedict.

I'll still be back to get their bread and delicious pastries, and to try more of their meal options. I will just have to make a note to not eat the eggs benedict as long as it has the horseradish sauce.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,2,0,3,34e4IY_mATdjI3ntvSQuEA

My boyfriend and I took my 5-year-old goddaughter here last weekend on Saturday morning. The inside is super cute and there is a little patio outside. When you walk in, you see the counters just lined with pastries and baked goods, and that image just brings me such joy!  I was like a kid in a candy store. 

The cashier wasn't the most friendly or helpful, and I was a little taken aback since I was so giddy to be there. We ordered a cheese and ham quiche, a fruit tart, cheese Danish, croque Madame, and 2 of each macaron they had, and a latte for me. It came to about $40. Eeks! But I was excited and didn't care.

Our food didn't all come out at once so when the fruit tart didn't come after everything else was served, we thought maybe it was on its way. The cashier must not have heard me order it though because it never came. Also, my receipt wasn't itemized so I really don't know if I ordered it or not, but we just let it go. 

The croque Madame was amazing and our favorite. Everything else was really good, but I must say I was quite disappointed with the macarons. The shells were crumbly and some had air bubbles. I also wasn't a fan of the filling. I was expecting my latte to come out in a big round coffee cup, but it came in a to-go paper cup, which was also a little disappointing.

Overall, it was a good experience. I really want to go back and hope that our experience is better. There were a lot of things on the menu that I can't wait to try, like the crepes and various other pastries, and I can't WAIT to have another croque madame!",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,4,2,3,w8BP3sCG9Y9VXXbcviiEQw

Their food is ammmmazing and same with their prices.

It was busy, seeing as it was right before Christmas, but we decided to eat in. 

Croque Madame - it was quality, but it's not our favorite one in town. It all boils down to minute details and preference of liking less dense bread and the bechamel is a little sweet for me. Still, it's one of the better ones in town. 

Vol au Vent - puff pastry was crisp and the filling was thick and rich. It was a bit small of a portion though, so it was a good thing I suppose we were sharing this and the larger entree of the croque madame. 

Both came with a side salad with a creamy balsamic. Standard, but good and components were fresh. 

Kouign Amann I'm glad we got one each. It wasn't hot, which is the best time to get them, but still every bit good with that rich, buttery, flaky sugary comfort I love about it. There really isn't many places that make kouign amann in town unfortunately. 

Almond croissant. This was a solid croissant and I enjoyed the almond paste being pure and natural instead of mixed down to a custardy paste or without a strong fake almond flavoring. The MIL loves almond croissants, but can't find one locally she likes so I may have to bring this to her next time for the judging. 

The only disappointment was the white mocha latte the BF ordered. The coffee in it was rather harsh, a burnt flavor cutting through it. I don't know if it's a bean variety and it's that jet fuel type flavor profile as this was the first time I've ever had Peets or the machine is not performing up to snuff. 

Counter service was alright. They were just trying to get through the line so we didn't get too much personal time in. After that, you take your number and sit yourself with DIY water. 

Good overall visit and we most definitely will be back for more pastries. There will probably be much more selection to choose from when it's non holiday season as well.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,4,4,Q8MkMZVla3JJFljYsnAnMg

5189108,2014-08-23,0,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"Coming from Switzerland and having been to France for nearly all my childhood vacations I was craving for some actual actual bread. When I moved to this neighborhood, La Belle Terre was one of the first stops I made. And boy was I impressed!
Their food is fresh and always tastes good. I've not had anything bad and I am going there about once every week. But let me write a bit more about what you get

The Food
=======

This is a french bakery, although it does serve a bit more than just bread. One can get several different sandwiches, salads and, during the winter time, a soup. Although I would appreciate if they were to offer the soup through the summer too, as I don't see a point in making a difference in Vegas ... They have delicious coffee, which I find increasingly hard to find in the US and great drinks. Nearly always there's a little water dispenser where one can get a small cup of water. If it's not around they'll offer water on request (although I've only had that once).

The Staff
=======

The all are very friendly. Sometimes they are a bit slow when there are a lot of costumers, but it's no big deal. I've yet to wait more than 15 minutes on any item I've ordered.
They are attentive and have yet to be rude to a customer while I was there. You can ask them for advice and they tell you about their desserts and their menu with a friendly and open attitude. I've come to miss that in Vegas as more than not people here are a tad bit cold.

Conclusion
=========

I love this place and would bring anyone here. I'd recommend it to anyone that has a few minutes time to sit down and enjoy one of their sandwiches or pastries. They also do special orders on request which is great for parties and events.
One thing that might improve this place would be a few options for sugar free desserts and gluten free bread. But alas, it IS a french bakery, so that request might not be heard :)

Again: Definitely go here if you're around the area and have a few minutes to spare! This place is THE BEST bakery in Vegas!",0y-8L9hXemQew1K1j68KEw,1,0,5,HJ5a6LkoaPEDgxaCna4XTQ

5199489,2012-12-18,17,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"Quiche alert! My how I love a good egg pie, so whenever I spy a contender, I have to give it a try. At La Belle, they had about five options, all baked in individual crusts and served with a side salad. I opted for the ratatouille, which features mixed vegetables, and the flavor was super savory. I could have eaten another one right then. 

They are serving up Peet's Coffee and Tea, and although I have experienced Peet's previously, today I was reminded that it is pretty much crack liquefied. I had one small glass and felt altered (in a kinda good way?) all day long. If you are a Peet's fan, you can get a cup fresh brewed here. 

However, the real star here is in the baked goods. If you want to die and go to carb heaven, this will be a good starting point. Brian, the owner, has a lifelong passion for baked beauties, and he has partnered with a French couple to create small batch breads from quality cultures. Their sourdough looked and smelled superb, as did their entire selection of baked temptations.

And, for all of you WiFi junkies, they have it for free as well as a thoughtful bar with endless plugs for your electronic devices. The only danger is that you might gorge yourself on pain au raisin before you can complete your task.

5213801,2015-04-17,5,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"Ok I am tempted to give them one star after my most recent experience.  Let me talk about the bad then I will roll with the good about this French bakery.

I stopped in this morning to grab my normal small baguette with brie and a small latte.  To my dismay they have raised their prices on my little bit of paradise.  Now I don't want to be overly critical and I am willing to pay for good food and or service but this isn't right.  

Normally I pay $1.30 for my ""roll"" and .50 to add brie.  The ""chalk board"" menu states "".50 to add to any item"".  Today the lovely gentleman charged me $5.50 for my bit of brie.  When I confronted him he said the prices on the board are not accurate so he handed me a paper menu with the update prices.  Ok, I'll accept that but this new paper menu says ""$1.00 to add things like butter, jam...""  I ask why he didn't charge me the $1.00.  He said I created a sandwich. I reminded him I come in once a week for my snackwich and what I pay.  He said if I didn't like it I don't have to take it.  Not very customer service oriented.  I just think that the ""chalk board"" menu and the paper menu should reflect proper prices.  I added cheese to a roll.  

Ok enough with the negative.  This place has awesome food.  From the Croque Madame to the Croque Monsieur.  These sandwiches are insanely tasty and are served with a small side salad and a great balsamic dressing.  The coffee/espresso is way better than any Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf you may enjoy.  They offer great sweet treats and quiche too.

Parking is pretty easy at this place.  They do have bike parking and an outdoor sitting area.  You could bring your pup to hang out while you eat your great meal.  

Todays snafu won't stop me from coming here.  Yes I'm annoyed but I'm not chopping my nose off to spite my face...or tastebuds....",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,16,4,3,8FbAGkz9u7tyMZR5a9wVHg

The desserts looked good but when we took them home to eat them they tasted like they had been sitting in the refrigerator too long and had a funny chemical taste to it. My three year old (who eats ANYTHING sweet) took one bite and almost threw up from the taste of it. 
The older guy working behind the counter was extremely rude and completely ignored us while he was busy doing other things.

5250922,2013-10-18,0,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"Have been here twice in last month. There are about 8 tables inside and 4 tables with umbrellas outside. First visit I ordered to stay-sat inside. There was a couple of ladies working, using the free wifi, talking pretty loudly-collaborating on work. In order to drown them out, I started talking on my phone till my food came. I think between them and I, it may have distracted one lady who went to eat outside.

My first visit ($14), I tried the 3 bean chili, crepe with chicken, spinach and a white cheese (can't remember if it was brie or swiss or something else) - the cheese was more of a sauce then melted in the crepe. Not sure that was preferred-it was a bit too much of the sauce. On my way out, I thought the chocolate chip pecan cookie looked good -- and it was delicious. Besides the cookie, the chili was yummy. The crepe was big (took half home) but, Crepe Expectations on Eastern is better for crepes.

My second visit ($15), I ordered the 3 bean chili, the turkey sandwich with brie (extra .30 for brie vs, any other cheese offered), and 2 chocolate cookies to go. The chili and sandwich were yummy. The cookies looked different than my first visit -- I should have clued in that they would taste different. Oh, they did. I ate the first one, and threw the second one out. They just tasted so different than my first visit. I think that is so weird, why not consistent??

This place is pricey for counter service - the cup of chili is like $3.50+, the sandwich and crepe were in the $7-7.50 range and the cookies ($1.10) were less expensive than the pastries (2.75+) but are small.

The location is great -- pretty central and is good for a quick lunch when out and about.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,3,1,3,vD7WV9c1H0GRsr9vVtWvOA

After taking a sip of the caramel latte, I came to the conclusion that perhaps I'm not keen on bitter coffee as much as I was in the past. If you like your coffee drinks dark and bitter, then you'll love the coffee here!



LOVE LOVE LOVE this charming place! I would totally come here every day if they serve cafe latte or espresso drinks but that doesn't matter because I will come back here a lot more often from now on. The Italian quiche with a side salad is so delicious and it is half the price as a quiche you may find in a coffee shop nearby whose name I will not name. La Belle Terre Bread also has various scrumptious looking pastries and bread products that I may try later (when I'm no longer fat). If you ask for a salad, make sure to try to LBT vinaigrette, the horseradish that's mixed in this dressing is just absolutely fabulous with the leafy greens! 

Oh, they also have savory and sweet crepes. And nice seating areas, both inside and outside. And free wifi!",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,5,1,5,k9Y9AGmcp6mhkOvTRQ3j9Q

Butter Croissant
Almond Tart
Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie
Palmier
Blueberry Cream Twist

When I heard rumor that an independent French Cafe was turning out superlative Kouign Amann  just down the street from my new house I knew a visit was imminent - IE the day we started unpacking - and not only are the stories of stellar French pastry true...they even come from a condescending French baker with uncompromising style and skill.  Admittedly a bit turned off by the ""premade"" croque alongside the fact that almond croissants would not be ready until the ambiguous ""later"" it was a relatively large sampling of the restaurant's wares that we selected on Saturday morning and aside from a slightly doughy blueberry cream twist the results were textbook, inclusive of two of my very favorite items.  Beginning first with a quartet including a warm butter croissant, flaky and natural almond tart entirely devoid of frangipane, and a Kouign Amann still warm liquid at the core it was actually the dense Baba Au Rhum that proved the shocker of the morning with ample booze but gentle sweetness beneath the light cream.  Impressed enough to purchase some items to go it was perhaps the delay in consuming the twist until later that rendered it flaccid and unable to suffer the same fate both the chocolate chip cookie and more so the buttery palmier would prove the best I've found in the Southwest; all the more impetus to call in advance before my next visit to make sure the Almond Croissant is warm and ready.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,4,JJL4xd3onwQIKXOSEJPJOw

The coffee wasn't anything great. As a French bakery/cafe I was really hoping they had some good houseblend coffee or something. Which is why I gave a 4/5 star rating. They used normal Peet's coffee, so don't expect anything gourmet. But the food! THE FOOD! It was excellent. The crepe was delicious but the Vol Au Vent stole the show. The puff pastry, the chicken, the mushrooms, and the sauce they covered it with had the most savory flavor. It was amazing.

FANTASTIC that the new owner Sandra has recently taken over this bakery/cafe.  She is doing a great job to make this cafe higher on our eating list.  Sometime about a year ago the ownership changed.  So it did enough to make us come less often.  That changed today.  We noticed right away some things were different.  And the rude/disinterested person taking ones order was gone.  Sandra took our order.  She seemed interested and appeared to take care to serve us properly.  When she came by the second time to make sure we had everything we needed, I asked her did she recently start working here.  She said YES.  However she was the owner.  We had been there just before going to Europe for a month.  France being one of the stops.  This was early April.  So she came since then.  My answer to her was that everything was perfect finally.  We used to come and have great pastries and breads.  Today we had a  usual lunch:  a croque-madame and an onion soup.  The croque-madame was rich and tasty.  A fabulous grilled sandwich of ham and cheeses with a fried egg on top.  We have had this sandwich in France.  We've said that we did not have to go to France to have this sandwich.  We could not say this for the last year.  Now we can say this again.  It's REALLY GOOD.  If you like onion soup like me, ORDER THIS!  It's vegetarian, does not taste like a veggie onion soup.  It is BEAUTIFUL.  The Gruyere cheese on top was what I like.  If you want beef stock, you may not care.  I'm a meat eater.  I just want it good.  And it is.  This is a simple dish that is usually without flavor.  This delivers.  The pastries looked good as they always do.  I'll come back soon to see if they taste as good as they look.  Also, Sandra said the breads do not have the adulterants in them like most in the US does.   These I'm told put on the pounds.  I hope that's true as I love bread.  It shows.  So I'll be trying them soon.  Sandra also speaks about 6 languages.  One of them French, of course.",I_wk4AL2SV1-hshrIAcyhQ,0,0,5,5SQt-1C__aypla0imUk9Cg

It's such a luxury to have food this delicious delivered to your door! This bakery/cafe does the French stuff so well that when I bite into one of their Danish or croissants, I am transported to a sidewalk cafe in Mont Mart (please forgive the spelling), watching the artists and sipping my espresso. If you've ever been to Paris, you know what I mean!

I didn't like their croissant press too much. It was bland; no saltiness or acidity to punch it up, and was unpleasantly unctuous. It needed a saltier protein, or a saltier cheese, or perhaps a slice of tomato. The croissant was lovely though, crusty, flaky and cloud-like!

The quiche was good (tomato and bacon). Very small and deeper than what I'm used to, the flavors were very well balanced and not too eggy. I do think both of these items suffered because of the delivery time. Neither are well suited for delivery.

Now to the pastries. Ahhhhhhhhhh....... The fruit Danish (apricot, cheese, and cherry) are superb. Glistening with a light egg wash, beautifully browned. The fruit toppings, especially the cherry, are a perfect foil for the sweet pastry. The cherries were more tart than sweet; a marriage made in heaven! But the best? The chocolate and almond croissant! If you like almonds, this is a must! A flaky, buttery croissant stuffed with the perfect proportion of marzipan and chocolate. Almond is the dominant flavor, with the chocolate adding a wicked good accent. (No, I'm not from Boston, I just love that phrase ""wicked good!) Order up a bunch of these pastries and you can have breakfast on the Champs Elysees every morning! My only caveat is to be careful ordering items that are not well-suited to delivery. I'm looking forward to visiting this establishment sometime very soon. In the meantime, I'll keep on enjoying the luxurious experience of having a sumptuous French breakfast on my little patio in the middle of the desert. Before the worst of the heat descends.

This place is adorable, from the mismatched furniture (you can eat at a cute desk) to the tin ceiling, it really exudes a French vibe. Everyone behind the counter couldn't be friendlier and they clearly adore what they do. My husband and I first tried a few pastries. The macaroons are perfection! They are gooey in the middle with the perfect amount of crunch when you bite into them. The pear tart is not to be missed, it is delicate with the perfect amount of sweetness. We also tried a Losange, which was one of my favorites. The flaky croissant dough envelops a delicious cream cheese like filling that leaves you completely satisfied. 

We soon discovered our favorite time to come was breakfast time! The breakfast sandwiches are a steal at $3.99. You get egg, cheese, and ham on a delicious ciabatta bread. It is the perfect size to fill you up, but leave you with room for one delicious pastry. My personal favorite is the cheese danish. I am admittedly addicted to cheese danishes, but they are hard to find. The danish here is absolutely perfect. It has a flaky crust and 2 giant dollops of cheese in the middle. It is the perfect ratio of cheese to pastry and so indulgent.

Harvest french bread- I wasn't too fond of the flavor at all. It's got a major multigrain thing going on, and I like that on my regular toast, but not for a french baguette. 

Quinee Aman?- It was good, a solid 4 star. I have had better however.

5973619,2013-04-29,7,jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg,"I admit it. I am a carb-aholic.  I am a bread snob.  Once you have tried freshly baked bread, it is hard to go back to boring old Wonderbread and the other preservative filled commercially produced brands.  The smell of freshly baked bread is intoxicating. They sell freshly baked baguettes, batards, rolls, french and sourdough loaves.  My household goes through a lot of bread every week, and I am afraid my kids are turning into bread snobs too. I haven't tried everything yet, but I'm pretty sure it won't be long until we do.  So far the french and sourdough loaves have been our favorites.  

But, the bread is not what brought me into this lovely french bakery the first time.  It was the pastries.  Holy moly, are these addictive. On my first visit, I came home with a variety of perfect, buttery, flaky, melt in your mouth, pastries.  I had even bought 4 Cannelles for my family of 4 to share since we had never had it before.  Well, I ate my Cannelle in the car and it was so delicious I could not resist eating another.  I pondered splitting the remaining 2 that survived the drive home. for the family, but thought it would be better if I just ate all of the evidence instead.  I have since learned my lesson, and buy at least a dozen so the rest of the family can partake as well.

I have yet to try any of the soups or sandwiches because the breads and pastries grab my attention every time.  But, a quiche is definitely calling my name.  They serve deep-roasted Peet's coffee, the only bold coffee that can successfully give me the caffeine rush I need - which is why it is the only coffee I drink at home too.  The bakery itself is adorable and once you step through the doors, all of your senses are awakened- the scents of the fresh baked goodies, the shiny equipment behind the counter where all of the magic happens, and the warm and fuzzy feeling you get from a a great cup of bold coffee.  Service is very friendly, prices are reasonable, ambience is great, and there is free wifi- what else can you ask for?

I'm a fan of a decent Caprese, and for what I paid, I could have made it myself. The buffalo mozzarella and basic tomatoes were served on shredded ice burg lettuce. There were only small shreds of basil, that was starting to wilt. I had no problem with the service and my macarons were perfect. I will go back again to try a quiche and perhaps the Croque Madame before I form my final opinion.",AfE9gOJCFceyHLbWE2UAPA,2,0,3,y3wDF2s9zzfewjyQXStkMw

My sister was wearing a birthday headband because it is her birthday & he gave her a cake. We told him it was our first time there & he was very patient. So the set up is quite simple: you order at the register & take a seat, they'll take the food to you. Everything was delicious!",eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,0,0,5,Vve1AZE7iVSHvZYL8LUugA

The croque madame was the bomb and is a must order here! The sourdough bread is delicious and flavored well, and the medley of ingredients soaked in egg yolk after you break the egg on top is just heavenly in your mouth. The crust was a tad hard though and made it challenging to cut and eat with a knife and fork, but it's definitely too messy to be a hands-on sandwich.

The nutella crepe was good but not the best I've had. The nutella is squirted into the crepe instead of smeared, so there are areas of the crepe missing nutella if the nutella trail didn't venture there.

I also had the watermelon & kiwi juice. The kiwi portion was separated and settled on the bottom when the drink arrived and it was the first thing I got on my first sip. It was incredibly tart and overpowering. After mixing up the drink and diluting it with water (it was really strong in flavor), it tasted much better.

The bf had the rustic sandwich and described it as just OK.

4 stars because the croque madame is excellent, but I can't say the same for some of the other menu items. I will still have to go back and try the bread and pastries though.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,0,4,5bN8_C5YjnYmM2C-AlMMoA
