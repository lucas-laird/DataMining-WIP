1942126,2015-08-10,3,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,"For $3/slice, it's not bad. Given the price and the location (in Boulder Station casino), you might want to scale back your expectations, but it's pretty solid for grabbing something unhealthy if you're already here. Cheese tastes real, choice of toppings available. 

Prepare yourself, though- the pizza is kept heated by lamps, and they don't toss it in an oven to heat up before serving as at other places. They simply plate it from the display. At least prices are good though- if a slice isn't enough carbs for you, add on garlic knots, 3/$1.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,4,3,7gGmLHfGm1kiZGvPBp0sGQ
3514707,2016-02-04,0,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,"I eat here regularly as I work nearby.  The pizza is great, as good as I've found in Las Vegas.  They actually use real sausage, not the pre-cooked flavorless stuff a lot of places use.  Price is decent, about $4 to $5 a slice depending on toppings and the slices are huge.  They also have meal deals that include cheese sticks or garlic knots and a drink.  And the staff is always friendly.  If you want a slice or a whole pie, I highly recommend it.",Y3cV3x5xD-tAoWEtaDK1HQ,0,0,5,Cy0QKD7KWqhcQwS9vwpN-g

The pizza on the other hand imo is great, like someone said in a previous post, this is the site of a former metro pizza, and it seems they tried to create their own version, which  is NYC pizza, and I think they did a very god job, the pizza was better the metro's.. which is saying a bit.  I did however go there when they first opened, so things may have changed.  I will go again very soon and make an update. 4.2 stars",17jifhHyMbYCo8_HSCe95Q,0,0,4,IR5oWEvuaG6fMrXT0i_Nng

He was baking up the pizzas, heating the wings, cleaning the area, answering phone calls, ringing up the cashier, and giving the best attitude to customers as much as he can. That guy was literally a one man show and I applaud him for giving me a good outlook on this business. The casino in which this restaurant is in, surprisingly also had very friendly workers like the movie theater employees were really friendly and welcoming. MYK was incredibly awesome and had such a positive attitude even when he was ridiculously busy. Food was eh to me. The medium hot wings were kinda too salty. I appreciated the fresh out the oven pizzas they had though.",yNQU9f5QdqS-AEY2Gj7KxA,4,2,4,c5wPLuH0UWgpdeDuGzDc0w

4718003,2014-09-08,0,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,When to this place today it's a regular pizza place. The only thing is that there was only a pepperoni pizza made maybe we were there a bit early but that seemed weird... Inside the boulder station so great place to go after a movie or before! Nice price and a pretty big slice I'm a pizza lover so I recommend,kS7NvX5dw49xJvujQpL7Kw,1,0,4,l7oQrwU_aw3vxzpF1rVYzw
4911394,2012-11-15,2,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,"Grabbed a slice because there was a huge line for the buffet and we were trying to make a movie. This was quick - though it take her nearly 10 minutes to serve us the rewarmed pizza. Which, by the way, was so molten that it literally MELTED the plate she served it on. When I told her that it couldn't be healthy to eat something that just melted its way through styrofoam, she just gave me a blank stare.

That's OK, because - healthily laden with styrofoam shell or not - this pizza was dry, bland, and altogether nasty. Wash there even cheese on it? Not sure. Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore). How is it possible to make sausage flavorless? Dunno, but they managed.

On the way out, there was a line of 4-6 people deciding which tasty slice they'd order. As flashed my mutilated plate on my way to the garbage can, I whispered to the one in front, ""Save yourself - it's absolutely terrible,"" and she got the rest of the line to leave with her. Victory.

Yech. Should have gone hungry. Just terrible.",OueXAik2P-eUcXbd1qGXKw,3,0,1,OEG2Cb-GU5VYwAhdauGw_g
5029943,2012-11-04,0,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally gave it a try and wished we'd continued to avoid it. We ordered what I consider to be a 2-topping pizza consisting of mushrooms (all over), half pepperoni and half sausage. We were immediately informed that this is a 3-topping pizza and would be charged accordingly. I have never heard of this - is this the new norm? It's always been my experience that two ""half"" toppings count as one for pricing. 

How was the finished product? The crust is extremely thin, soggy and lacking flavor; I am usually one to eat the crust edges, but this was so bland, there was no point. The cheese is exceptionally greasy and it didn't go to the edge of the pie. The mushrooms were sparse and carelessly strewn about; however, there was a fair amount of both the pepperoni and sausage. And oregano? It was treated more like a topping than a spice! Why is it many pizza joints think that good pizza should consist of large amounts of oregano? Oregano should enhance the flavor, not BE the flavor! 

Now, I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible, in my opinion, and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off. What can I say that was good? The pizza wasn't outrageously priced (compared to other pizza places), it was ready fairly quickly, and they have good quality napkins.",ET5D9kcwrY2LxsrG06stUw,1,0,2,CuRUJhfuY_gAhHcCEIYGhA

5268205,2015-08-31,1,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,Not a bad spot in the casino for a pizza place.   The pizza I ordered was grrrrreat!   And the garlic knots add on for a buck was good too.  Better than some of the pizza chains.,2-V9dclHMYG0U8TEIWD5jw,2,0,3,0ThiOxvT2hBn8Opp6dThEg
5415946,2015-09-02,0,9hNuOUywLPHdSbAXtQ9DhQ,"I ordered a large pizza, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 ricotta and basil and took it home. It was 13 something with the toppings. The pizza is huge but we found the crust a bit chewy and a bit oily. I was disappointed with the 1/2 ricotta and basil...although there was a lot of Ricotta, there was only a tiny sprinkling of basil. Overall it was good, just not great.",n0WGfNDEVZt_qQ9YoT4uTQ,0,0,3,LO9AUGVjtcuUJAv5B0TRQQ
