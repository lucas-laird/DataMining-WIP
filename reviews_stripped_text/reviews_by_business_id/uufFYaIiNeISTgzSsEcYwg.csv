We started off with the chicken wings which were also pretty good. The service was the best feature here. The only complaint I have is that the staff was hanging around the bar getting drunk.

3203663,2010-08-04,15,uufFYaIiNeISTgzSsEcYwg,"Rex Marvin has a weakness.  Okay, don't look at me that way.  I will start again.  Rex Marvin has many weaknesses. One that might shock you...okay...they would all shock you. This one would surprise you...okay...most of them would surprise you. Fine, I will just say it.  I have a thing for ski lodges.  Before you snicker. Before you judge. Before you call me horrible names and question my street cred and make me cut you...let Rex explain.

Imagine a young Rex. Imagine a young taut schoolboy with golden locks. Imagine a fat kid next to that good looking kid.  Guess which one was Rex.  They are standing on a hill. The hill is covered with snow. The snow is white. Show White is white.  Sorry, I got carried away...I digress.  A girl walked by. She was a vision. It wasn't a great vision but a vision nonetheless.  She smiled. I smiled. She smiled again. I smiled again. She smiled a third time. I thought she was retarded. She might have been. We skied. We talked. She talked more. Then...it happened. I disrobed. She disrobed. She saw the knife scar.  I saw the stretch marks.  We consummated our disgust.  It was sweet. It was sad. It was short. It was physically painless. It was emotionally numb. It was psychologically scarring. Still, I look back on those innocent times with longing and fondness.

Lodge at Hualapai looks like that ski lodge. It looks like the place where that morbid little troll stole my innocence. It is where after she left I huffed my first can of paint. The first time I cried the tears of shame...and liked it.

 Lodge is great...if you like wood. Nay, if you LOVE wood.  It is a little intense for those people who don't see wood as the greatest substance in the world.  It is a good place.  There are plenty of tv's to watch games, a great separate pool table area away from the customers and plenty of seating.  It also has a great fireplace in the winter.

The food and drinks are above the average bar food.  Their wings are meaty and the sauce is great.  Their sandwiches are very good and their dinners are solid but not spectacular.  Where the Lodge really excels is breakfast.  When you are on your third straight night with no sleep, sitting on the same bar stool, and fading in and out of consciousness while screaming about tiny fat chicks some food is a necessity. It is cheaper than bail.  The food is great, the prices are good. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day...especially when your face is covered with paint and your eyes can't focus.  
The bartenders make a good drink, not great, but good. The locals aren't exactly treated like they are needed...and they are, and there is very rarely a decent special...but it is a good place to go when there is nowhere else...or somewhere else very close throws you out for threatening to punch Betty White...and Betty White isn't even there. The concept of no harm no foul means nothing to those bastards.

Rex drinks here. Rex dulls the memories here. Rex eats here. Rex isn't really proud of it.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,14,14,3,KJXEupJs21SivKJ7oRpA-Q

Went for dinner and we were the only 2 people in the restaurant section.  Remember that fact, cuz it will come into play later.

I ordered a steak wrap with French fries and my hubby ordered a Cajun chicken pasta. After the waitress left, my hubby realized she didn't take his salad order, which the menu said came with his entree. He went over and told her and she said, ""Oh they stopped serving salads with that...but it DOES say it on the menu, so I'll go tell them to make one."" Weird occurrence #1.

When the food came, my wrap was served with onion rings, not the fries I ordered. Weird occurrence #2. I told the waitress it was fine and I would eat them. The wrap was pretty damn tasty and the onion rings were nice and crispy, not soggy.

My husband's Cajun CHICKEN pasta...had no chicken in it! Weird occurrence #3. However, the pasta was pretty damn tasty anyway.

So, the food was really good and the waitress was really nice and personable, BUT they messed up on our order three times when were literally the ONLY people in the restaurant.

Three of us went in for lunch.  We were the only table in the dining room.  The bartender/server was standing at the bar eating a sandwich.

I'm very familiar with the chain and visit often as I am a Vegas local and in the same industry. 11:35am Dec 15th I order a steak and eggs meal with a special request for cheese mixed inside the eggs and not just layed on top. I've made this request at several locations that I've been to other then this one and every restaurant I go to in general for that matter not just The Lodge. The bartender places the order but once it comes out explains that the cook said he can only lay it on top because he doesn't want to burn his pans with cheese. LOL (I couldn't make this up) 

I then asked the bartender to have the cook come and explain that to me because That statement just doesnt make sense to me. Not to mention they should've stated that before bringing the food out and offering me another option. She then goes in the back, comes out and says ""he probably wont come out but he said he only has 1 pan left and doesn't want to take the risk of ruining it."" (Once again I couldn't make this up if I tried!) I then stated mixing cheese in with the eggs would never ruin a pan! (Common sense) 

Although she (the bartender) comped my meal I was looking for sum delicious cheese eggs, not a free meal! At the end of the day I wouldn't return to this location but will still go to others: Absurd and disrespectful would be a few ways to describe my experience.

Our order came out relativity quickly, although I was told that the Grilled Cheese was luke warm, almost cold, the Patty Melt was good but with a lot of onion, the Reuben was good as well but also slightly cold, and the burger was good too no issues there.

Our waitress informed us she was getting off her shift so our new bartender would take the tab when we were finished. We then proceeded to go up to their pool tables.

The place was quiet, with a table of 3 the only other diners, and about 10 people at the bar.  They still use the tiny little glasses for wine, though I guess since it was almost full it was probably close to what every other bar pours into a humongous glass.

The waitress had a really tough time answering the most elementary questions about the food, so we just ordered and let the dice roll.  Hubby ordered the rigatoni/chicken entree with a side salad, and I had the chicken, mushroom, jalapeño and cheese sandwich on French roll.  I was able to get a cup of soup as my side instead of fries, and the chicken tortilla soup was singing to me.

My husband's salad was delivered, and I waited and waited for the soup, but couldn't find the waitress.  That's because she was very busy - sitting at the bar chatting up one of the customers way off in the distance. She was a total space cadet.

 As I suspected, my soup came in a cup on the same plate as the sandwich.  So I sat having nothing while my husband ate, and then was expected to eat hot soup and a hot sandwich at the same time.  As it turned out, the soup was sooooo hot - both definitions - that I ended up having it for dessert.  I like spicy, but the spice was overwhelming, and it had way too much cream.  Traditional tortilla soup has NO cream.  On the plus side, it was chock full of stuff, so much that I was too full to have more than half.

I like the looks of this place - rustic and cozy.  I like the hours.  And the food's pretty good.  Service, though, needs a lot of improvement.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,3,pXbO8ar4XulV7MragBHkpQ
