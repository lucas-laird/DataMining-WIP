overall, i was satisfied with what we ordered(except the sea bass was a little dry). but their wine by the glass can use more selections.

service was great! they were very accomodating.

A restaurant should start to re-examine their quality if they can sit at the last minute on friday or saturday night.  The prices are ridiculous for the quality of the food.  If I pay $50 for a filet minion, I expect for it to knock my socks off.  It was underseasoned and the outer portions were actually dry on a medium cooked steak.  We paid $18 for the mac and cheese, recommended by other yelp reviews, and the mushrooms.  I don't understand how mushrooms could be so bland, and if it was. $25 steak dinner including the mac and cheese that would have been worth it.  The mac and cheese was the most interesting thing we got and it was slightly amusing at best.  Overpriced.... stay far far far far far away from this Stuffy restaurant.

For starters, we had escargot and the seafood platter.  The escargot is kind of a vague memory because the seafood platter had some of the meatiest and freshest shellfish I ever had.  The lobster and crab legs were the standouts.  On to the the entree, the filet mignon and whole roasted garlic were such a delicious pair.  I squeezed  out every bit of roasted garlic I could! I got my filet mignon medium rare and it was juicy and flavorful. I sampled  most of the sides that people at our table ordered.  The asparagus, creamed spinach, and the mushrooms were tasty.  The potato gratin is just ok though.  Everyone in our party was so stuffed that we didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu.

I called from my room to make a reservation and they told me there was no wait. I was seated immediately. Service was friendly and prompt.

Started with the Lobster Bisque - it was good, a bit too salty for my liking. I've definitely had better. Then had the Maryland Crab Cakes which were excellent, although they would have been even better with a bit more of the red pepper sauce. The walnut raisin bread was also pretty good!

I think the shortribs could have been a bit more aggresively seasoned and it could have been served warmer than it was.  The veg and the mashed potatoes that accompany the shortribs were satisfactory.  In my dinner party, the others had good things to say about the prime rib, the lamb shank, and the ribeye.

1822553,2008-10-23,0,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"This steakhouse is located within Caesar's Palace and is not contained in the Forum Shops. We have eaten many times in the Forum Shops and wanted to try something ""local"" to the casino. 

I had obtained a reservation for 7:30pm through the toll-free number provided by Caesar's to reach any restaurant in the casino. After wasting time sitting at the bar we were finally taken to our table shortly after 8:15pm! We were basically ignored and had to constantly ask when our table would be ready. I can be as cool and care-free as the next guy, but this was a business dinner, so I thought the wait was excessive. (To be fair, they eventually did get the manager who came to us and offered to buy the round of drinks we had in front of us. This was a kind gesture, but we wished we had ordered cocktails instead of the round of Cokes. And to that, we would have just preferred our table.)

I would like to say that once we were seated our experience improved, but I cannot. I have been to nice restaurants when there is an understanding that it will be a long meal and you may as well get comfortable. Neros is not that type of a place, but our meal took forever. They may have been understaffed, but it was impossible to get ahold of our server. 

I started my meal with a bowl of the Lobster Bisque, which was the only highlight of the night. To credit Neros, it might be the best Bisque I have had in Las Vegas and was certainly one of the best I have ever had. 

I had my ""go-to"" bone-in ribeye for dinner. I was very glad that it was served with the house steak sauce because the steak was dry. That is the restaurant's fault. What is not necessarily its fault was the fact that my steak was just a bad cut. I happened to get a piece that was replete with ""bad spots"" that were too tough to cut through and certainly not edible. That happens and I may have said something if the service had been better or if that hadn't been futile once before in Las Vegas. 

I spoke with a few other people who had eaten there and their feelings were better than mine but lukewarm overall. I cannot see any reason why this would not be my ONLY dinner at Neros.

1851450,2011-07-03,1,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"I had such an incredible dinner last night! The husband and I were craving steak and have heard such wonderful things about Nero's, we decided to try for ourselves. We ended up ordering five courses, splitting each one (Yea, this is what we do. What can I say, we like to try as much as possible)! 

We started with the seafood platter. You can tell a lot about a steakhouse with this dish. The lobster was huge, the crab legs sweet and juicy. The oysters were amazing. Everything was fresh and ice cold. I think they make the cocktail sauce there. I am not normally a cocktail sauce lover but could have eaten gallons of this stuff! We were off to a great start!

Next, the foie gras. Seared, which is my favorite way to consume it (Brein says pate is his favorite...I think we had a 15 minute argument over the subject)!! Nero's serves their foie with buttery. flaky bread sauteed apples and a thick maple syrup. And a very nice size cut as well. I hate going to an upscale restaurant where the foie is smaller than my thumb! This was the size of my palm!

A break from the heavy, we opted for the baby gem lettuce salad. It had a great mixture of tomatoes, boiled eggs and bacon. Plus the dressing was creamy and light. I liked the salad and would order it again (although I was thinking of the foie the entire time I ate the salad)!!!

Our seafood course? Seared Barramundi with little baby squash, mushrooms and an apple curry sauce. This is a lighter fish, flaky and moist. The sauce was the highlight of the plate. I loved the combination of apple and curry.

HIGHLIGHT OF THE MEAL!!!!! The Rib eye. First off it was HUGE!!! Like bigger than my head huge! Second, I have never put another thing in my mouth that could compare. The server said they dry age the meat (I normally prefer wet aged, but have changed my mind now). We ordered ours rare and it was cooked to perfection. Served still on the bone we fought over each bite. The meat was so flavorful and juicy. 

We ordered two sides with the steak, which were both very good. Brein got the creamed spinach and I the glazed carrots. They were cooked perfectly, not mushy like baby food. The creamed spinach had great flavor Brein pointed out later that he thought there was nutmeg in the dish. Whatever it was it popped on my tongue! 

All in all I really enjoyed my experience at Nero's. I will dream of that rib eye until I go back again (Which will be very, very soon)!!",kEi9IImtSsz2Kg2x5bfucQ,1,1,5,JOaNcvQ7eDb-Jv9IxFAPqQ

The salad was fair, filet was tend but on the salty side, and the cheesecake decent (had to request for the sauce to be on the side because I figure it would be overly sweet).

The prices are in the $$$ range... but you are at Caesar's Palace. Want a cheap steak? Go across the street to Bill's casino. $9. There is a difference, people.

Also had a tira misu for dessert. It was very good, but was not made far enough in advance. The lady fingers were still dry. When properly made, the lady fingers continue to absorb moisture from the other ingredients until it is a moist cake-like consistency.

This may not be a fair review seeing as how I did not order steak here, but let's just go with it anyway.  Their service was impeccable - very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  

Their walnut raisin bread was fresh, and so delicious!  I had to push the bread basket to the other end of the table so I'd still have room for my actual meal.  

I decided on the Roasted Foie Gras with apple bread pudding and spiced apple (a starter, $22).  The waiter said it would only be a small tasting, but it turned out to be more than enough.  The first bite of the foie gras was amazing - perfectly roasted with the right amount of crispiness on the outside while the rest of it melts in your mouth.  The taste of the apple bread pudding and sweet syrup blends quite well with the foie gras, definitely pleases the palate.  After just a couple of bites though, I had enough - it's a small amount of food, but quite heavy.  

I also had the Maine Lobster Bisque with Fresh Tarragon Cream ($14).  This was a bit of a disappointment - the soup could have been thicker and heartier.  Rather, it was thin, and definitely lacking in lobster.  There were only a few small bits sitting at the bottom of the bowl.  The taste was OK, but this soup lacked substance.  Thumbs down.

I've been to many, many Vegas steakhouses, and nearest and dearest to my heart is Neros.

My father first took me to Neros for my 16th birthday.  Neil Sedaka had just sung ""Happy Birthday Sweet 16"" to me earlier that night in the Caesar's Palace theatre (pre-coliseum / Celine days) and we all went to Neros after the show.

I don't eat steak often, but I do love a good steak.  At Neros, it has always been perfectly cooked, aged wonderfully, minimally seasoned (because excellent steak doesn't need it!) and served in generous portions.  I've never been able to finish a steak at Neros, and I've never tried.

When my father was alive, this was his favorite.  He stayed exclusively at Caesar's Palace, and though he ventured around town for different foods, steak was always at Neros.

I remember arriving there one night for a dinner party with my father's associates and a bunch of my friends.  They surprised us by having a gigantic shellfish platter on ice in the center of our table.  Shrimp, oysters, crablegs, all beautifully served.  Incidentally, I don't like seafood, but all who partook sung its praises.

Neros is a piece of old Vegas.  While remodeled and modern now, you can still look around the dining room and envision men with their cigars and three piece suits and women dressed to kill (um, no miniskirts and ugg boots).

If you want an excellent steak in a less trendy setting, and want to be surrounded by some class, try Neros next time you're in Vegas.",ZXJ80SFdNBIIoKyTYHZ-Xg,2,2,5,Nt195VpjGLVjwGsaJrOwOw

Reservations recommended. Like anything else in Vegas, get comps or coupons of you can - but I'd say the prices were tolerable even without it. 

I am a cruel, horrible carnivore who loves some tasty foie gras. I had foie gras something as an appetizer AND again on my filet mignon. Mmm, tasty suffering. (Actually I'm pretty sure it was California-style low-cruelty foie gras, not the real French stuff. But both are tasty.) The steak was very good as well, good quality meat and cooked the way I ordered it instead of somewhere else. 

The service was tolerable if not perfect, and the sommelier was knowledgeable enough to find me a red wine I could actually drink (I'm sensitive to sulfites and reds, so I only drink organic US reds or European ones, which add fewer sulfites). Real wine drinkers will find a decent selection available. 

I took two guests, and both enjoyed everything they ate. Since this was my ""big fancy dinner"" during which I was spoiling one of them, it worked out very well. The menu was nothing screamingly original, but did everything they did quite well, and there was enough variety of tasty classics to keep my party happy. Vegetarians should check the Web site or menu first, as it's pretty steakhouse and may not have much to offer non-carnivores. My carnivore party was quite happy with its food.

I set up a company dinner at Nero's expecting it to be at least 4 stars... BUT I was greatly disappointed. 

First... the service was slow... forgot about a couple of people whenever they brought out a course (esp mee!) 

Second... the food. For appetizers, there were crab cakes and Caesar Salad. The crab cakes were ok. Only the top and bottom were breaded and not enough seasonings to subdue the fishiness of the crab. The Cesar Salad wasn't a big deal... literally a few romaine lettuce leaves w/ dressing topped w/ parmesean cheese and an anchovy. The main entree I got was the baked chicken w/ carmelized carrots and mashed potatoes... Loved the veggies, carrots were perfect! Not too smooshy. :) ... but chicken needed more flavor. 

The dessert was good.. have to give it 3 stars. I had the creme brulee and it was tasty. I personally would have preferred a tad more vanilla beans and a crunchier topping of sugar.

The oysters came with a large amount of three different sauces. All three were good but I thought a little bit overkill on the quantity. The brocolini and mac and cheese were so good. I could have ate all the mac and cheese myself but my husband took several spoon fulls when I was stuffing the steak down. The bread basket had a roll in it that was especially good.

we started off with a Caesar salad which was drenched in the dressing, which wasn't appetizing at all. the soup was the best thing we ordered that night. 

the steak was huge, i believe i got the wet aged new york strip, which was dry and not very tasty!! from what i heard from everyone else at the table their main course was just ok as well. my mom ordered a fish entree because shes allergic to beef, but she said it was fish soaked in soy sauce and shes tasted many other things that were better. 

the sides we had were ok, we had the mac and cheese, the creamed spinach, asparagus...which were all mediocre. 

oo so what was awesome was the bread!!! i dont know if it was because of this that the food was unappetizing, but my entire family couldn't stop munching on the bread nonstop. they had a basket of three different kinds and i believe the one cheese bread was to die for.

4297148,2009-10-21,0,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"I was hoping for the best but ended up with the worst. After planning a trip to see Cher in Las Vegas for my birthday I found myself in Las Vegas 2 weeks before the show. The year before I had gone to see Bette Middler and as we were leaving the show saw Neros but it looked like it was closed so we just past it up. This year I thought I would see if I could make reservations. I could so I did.

After seeing the Cher show which was great and I'd do again in a heartbeat we made are way to Neros. We and 9:30 Reservations and got there really close to that time. We were asked to wait which ended up being about 15mins.

To our surprise we were seated out side of the  restaurant (Maybe they thought it was now a sidewalk café). We were not asked if this was okay just shown to our table (which was also only 8 feet from the hostess stand). You could hear 2 different bands from this sidewalk table and could hardly hear what the other person had to say at the table.

The waiter took our order. My sister had prime rib (she said how can they mess that up) I had some double cut pork. We both hand some broccoli side dish. She had a mixed drink I had a soft drink. We got the side dish about a minute before the main course (I thought they should had come at the same time) then about 3 minutes after that we were given our drinks.

My sister kept asking just how does this knife work I can't seem to cut this prime rib. I said I know my pork is kind of hard to cut to but if you hold it this way it seems to work. We kept trying to work in these poor cuts of meat and each hand one bite of the side dish and said YIKES. My sister could only eat one piece of her prime rib. I only and three bites of my double cut pork and we looked at each other and said ""this is the worst meal we had ever had"". 

Since it was my Birthday and she was going to pay the bill I felt really bad and said ""I know you were going to pay but we are not enjoying this at all so lets just get the check and I'll pay the bill and you can take me to dinner tomorrow okay?"" she said ""are you sure, well okay"". We placed our napkins on the table looked directly at the waiter as he walked by us 2 times without even a second thought. Then the third time I stopped him and asked for the bill. When he came back with the bill he asked if everything was okay we said now that it was not and we were not happy. He asked if we wanted him to speak to the manager we said yes.

He came back and said ""I spoke to the manager and she would like to give you a dessert  on the house"". I was like you have got to be kidding me. We didn't even eat dinner and now you want to give us a dessert. I asked him to get the manager for me. 

By this time they have removed our none eaten dinner when she came over and asked what the problem was. I told her the story and she said ""If you didn't like where we seated you , you should had said something at the time"". as far as the dinner she just looked puzzled.

Would I ever go there again NO! I did read one review and somebody had a 3 course meal for $39.00? We had to inedible dinners and the bill was $119.22 without tip.

5033851,2010-10-02,0,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"I've been to Nero's three times. The four-star rating reflects an combined average of each visit.

The first time I went to Nero's was in 2006, while vacationing in Vegas when I still lived in New York. We stumbled upon the place after thoroughly examing the Forum Shops at Caesars. I do not recall the time of day, but there wasn't a wait and we did not need a reservation. 

The service was friendly and prompt and our meals were excellent. I remember at the time saying it was the best Filet Mignon I had ever had, hands down. My husband ordered a giant T-bone and also gave it glowing reviews. We ordered a side dish to share (I think it was au gratin potatoes) and each had a French onion soup as an appetizer. Everything was fantastic. We both ordered our steaks with garlic topping, which was this odd kind of mashed, seasoned garlic that formed a crust as it was cooked onto the steaks. It was utterly fantastic, though our breath probably reeked for days.

Once we went home to New York, all we could talk about was Nero's. I still suspect Nero's played an important role in convincing my reluctant husband to make the move to Vegas with me the following year.

We returned to Nero's in 2007 (again, didn't need a reservation, though they seated us in the outside ""patio"" area). Our meals were once again excellent, but we couldn't help but notice a few changes. The au gratin potatoes were no longer on the menu, so we ordered a fancy-schmancy ""mac and cheese"" side, very yummy. The steaks were still good, but the service seemed to have declined slightly. It was still a superb meal, but it wasn't the mind-blowing, life-altering experience we recalled from the previous visit.

Most recently, we were there a few months ago. My husband asked me to meet him at Caesars after work. We had originally planned to try Mesa Grill, but they had something like a three hour wait, so we decided to head over to Nero's instead, where we assumed there wouldn't be a wait. 

We, of course, got right in. Honestly, business always seemed fine, but I've never really seen the restaurant packed with people. I am a person who enjoys fine dining but is also terrible at advance planning. Nero's will always earn an extra star for not making me wait, or remember to make a reservation, ever!

I talked my husband into ordering the Châteaubriand to share. It was accompanied by potato croquettes and vegetables. We agreed on medium (I lean toward medium-rare, but my husband prefers medium-well, so we just met in the middle). The Châteaubriand was gorgeous and carved tableside. Unfortunately, while I thought it was just fine, my husband found his portion to be closer to medium-rare. It was a bit too bloody for his tastes. We really just should have swapped plates, because my portion was definitely a solid medium. Oh well. The meal was, as usual, excellent. I didn't like the croquettes as much as my husband did, but I thought there was plenty of food for the price. My husband was still hungry afterwards, but he's used to ordering huge T-bones. 

My issue, this time around, was more related to the service. The service has steadily declined over the years from what I see. Our waiter wasn't exactly unpleasant, but not at all attentive. He was never around when we needed something. At Neros' price point, the service really can make or break the dining experience for me. On my birthday last year, we ventured out to another, very famous steakhouse. While I thought my Filet was garbage compared to what I was used to at Nero's, I couldn't find fault with the level of service received. It was far more on par for what you would expect at a restaurant where a dinner for two runs upward of $200.

Will I return to Nero's? Of course, on special occasions when I feel like braving the Strip (now that I'm a ""local"", I avoid it like the plague). However, after such mixed experiences, I don't consider it my ""go-to"" steakhouse anymore. I'm far more interested in discovering off-Strip establishments with similar cuisine.",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,0,0,4,ZZXbRDTtW9QL-XljxKV90Q

As someone who samples the Lobster Bisque anywhere he goes, I must say that the version at Neros is amongst my alltime favorites with a delicate touch of terragon creme that balances everything perfectly.  Additionally, the Alaskan King Salmon Tournedos were flawless, fresh, perfectly seared, and delicious.....and about 1/2 the price as the same amount of meat as Bartolotta at the Wynn.  The creamed spinach was also tasty, but it is unfortunate that the gnocchi was quite subpar (so-much-so that they've apparently removed it from the menu.)

Back to the bread bowl for a second......seriously.....the walnut raisin bread alone would nearly be enough for me to return.  The Chocolate Fondue with fresh figs and poundcake was also quite delicious, but there was not nearly enough fruit/cake to utilize all the chocolate.

I didn't get to do the fine dining aspect of this place - I can only speak to late night causal dining - and for that, Nero's nailed it.  We were seated promptly and looked over a pretty decent late night menu - ordered the steak and eggs.

5571234,2010-06-02,2,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"Okay, so i went here this past weekend with my cousin.  First of all, we were expecting some fancy steakhouse... Like a fine dining 5 start establishment where everyone dressed to the nine.  This is not that place.  I knew right away when we walked in there were tables of people wearing sports gear....NBA Jerseys should NOT be allowed to be worn at a dining establishment where Dover Sole is priced at $55.00 per plate!!

Anywhoo, we were pleasantly seated and were served some nice bread items.  Breadsticks, sourdough, it was all yummy.  So was the butter that accompanied it.  

Our server.....she was a piece of work.  She never stood properly facing us.  She always seemled like she was ready to walk away when asking if we needed a drink (ie:  cousin ordered a diet coke that NEVER came) or wanted our veggies cooked a certain way (my fish and veggies which i asked to be steamed and grilled with no oil or butter...came out drenched in butter, herbs and oil).  When processing our bill, we had a credit card and some cash....she proceeded to say:  How much would you like on the card??  it caught us off guard.  What she wanted to do...was charge the card and take her tip in cash so that she DIDN'T HAVE TO CLAIM THE ENTIRE AMOUNT TO THE IRS AS INCOME WAGES.... FRICKING GHETTO!!  She ran the credit card on the machine, with the cash in one hand and went over to a table to chit chat.  DO YOU REALIZE THAT'S HOW FRAUD TAKES PLACE??  Who runs a credit card transaction and walks away from the register??  I mean........I don't know of any one in sales that will ring you up...then walk away to talk to someone else 12 feet away.  The register was in an open area walkway.  ANYONE could  have accessed it while she was chit chatting.  And then the card came back as ""Call Vendor"".  She came back loudly and told us the card was DECLINED.  Which was impossible.  She came back and said maybe we made too many purchases or ran it too many times.  So basically YOUR LAZY ASS DIDN'T WANT TO CALL THE MERCHANT???  And it was NOT DECLINED.  You really need to be careful what you say to people about declined cards, people get embarressed and feel humiliated (nice that on the same card, the next day over $300 worth of clothes were purchased at the Forum Shops)  I was not having this and had to totally tell her all of the above and also shared this with her manager.  The manager politely comped 1/3 of our bill (whopping $35...pleeeese....i shit $35 bucks) and was left with a sour taste in our mouths from this place.  

Will i go here again.  HELL NO.  Would i tell people to go here?  HELL NO.  Thanks but no thanks...  

And side note:  because of the open lay out of the restaurant to the hotel/casino (Caesers Palace), it smelled like VOMIT towards the end of our meal....

I am a lover of appetizers and seafood (yes, even at a steakhouse), so it would only make sense that i order the seafood appetizer. Oh my goodness, it was an incredible sampler of crab legs and shrimp and all that good stuff. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted as fresh as seafood can taste. I barely had any room left for my filet mignon! But I did...i always do. Haha. 

As for my steak, it was as good as i had hoped. It was prepared medium-rare EXACTLY. This is great because I have been to places where medium rare = rare or well. Oh no, not here. The center was the perfect shade of dark pink. LOVELY. The sides are pretty awesome, too. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes are a must.",eBFp6Go4ru--9o9MKPvNqg,1,1,4,JK5L5k1kYDBpAeecborXfg
5950620,2009-10-29,0,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"great steaks. 

-prime rib was well cooked on the outside, nice and pink in the center.
-bone-in ny strip was excellent and the meat was the star, not the seasoning. 
-short ribs are a great option as well. not as large a serving as the other two, but very tender and tasty.

great sides:

-potatoes were amazing.
-baby carrots were good, not great.
-wild mushrooms are definitely a must order
-their cream-style corn is seasonal so order if its on the menu

they started out with an amuse bouche  of smoked salmon and creme fraiche on this crispy potato slice. also amazing and a great way to start dinner.",RG0k1XTjy2FDeuQCif0mwQ,1,1,4,scdUtZjyKIjswXm5OPlkNQ
5994246,2007-11-26,0,3aKRYHFXMjKiaSAsVH4qiw,"Before I get into the review about the food, let me just say this....
FYI, MUST have a reservation to eat here, and if you decide not to go, (not sure if it's a last minute thing) but you need to cancel your reservation, or just decided not to go, they WILL charge you I believe it's like $50 bucks per person. Meaning, if you have reservation for 5 and at the last minute you cancel them, you will be charged $250 for cancellation. And how do they charge you? Well you have to give a credit card during the time of reservations. 
If that happens, my suggestion is:
1) first double check to see if you DO get charged for canceling or not.
2) If they do charge, check how much..
3) And if you still don't want to pay that stupid cancellation fee, just go and get a stupid appetizer. (FYI: get the Maryland Crab Cake which is less than $20 - and also make sure to tell the waiter you want just ""1 (in the middle)"" not around) because then you'll end up getting charged $20 times how ever many people you have.

Now on with the food....
As you can see I order the Maryland Crab Cake.. just 1 and it was absolutely to die for. I mean the way it was made, omg, it just melt in my mouth. The way it was presented to me, and taste, the .. everything.. It was absolutely delicious.
I wasn't really in the mood for something heavy, since I was going to a concert that night and I new I would be moving around a lot, so I ended up eating healthier. I ended up ordering the Wild Salmon. The salmon was just perfect. It wasn't to dry, it definitely wasn't to small. I mean gee'z towards the end, I couldn't finish it. When you get your plate, it looked small, but once you start to bit into it, there isn't just a salmon, but there's other stuff below it. Like vegetable and a sauce that's oh so yummy. 
And like all great fancy restaurants, you must order wine to go with your food. I don't remember what I order because this lady that works there, basically just helps customers select the wine to go perfectly with what you would want and what would mix well with your food, but it was something Italian. Very smooth, not to sweet, and definitely not dry. All in all, the end of the night for 2 people. It was less than $200 bucks. With no dessert of course. OK yeah that seems expensive, but once you try that food, it's worth every penny.",ZkvNrG9KpTjVqzsjoLhnbg,1,1,4,auWezdE39ERJsaxpEkCv4Q
