32189,2012-02-28,1,ljUba4BS4SgzlVYznuMrQQ,"So I decided to eat late night on 2-23-12 and thought the Pasta Pirate in the california hotel would be good. Sadly I was wrong.

I had a friend with me and I ordered the oysters and a standard pasta dish, while my friend ordered the siorloin special that was written in chalk at the entrance. Dont get me wrong; both the waitress and the busboy were very curtious and helpful. However when my friend ordered the stake it was said to the waitress to prepare the steak medium-well with even a slight pink to be left in the center would be acceptable.

That was NOT the case. The steak was very well done and almost a borderline beaf jerky. However when the busboy went to take the steak back and perhaps have the cook [I call him a cook and not a chef] prepare another meal, I could literally hear the cook complain out loud. I knew it was about my party, cause the conversation was that loud between the cook and the busboy. 

I almost expected the cook to leap over the counter to my table with a butcher knife it was like that. I know sometimes that they may get upset; however it is what the customer wants; NOT what the cook/ chef say this is the way its going to be.

Overall the Hotel/ casino were not all that bad, only the Pasta Pirate needs a extensive lesson in manners.

Yes; the steak special was taken off my bill at the end, but deliberately speaking out loud where everyone can hear you is very unprofessional. I most likely will visit the casino again, but the restaurant is on my never to visit places again.",u0MJq6N7PsRGE_T8HjZfrQ,2,0,1,PNSDoV7ceuAYq0is49vuUA
334125,2010-05-01,0,ljUba4BS4SgzlVYznuMrQQ,"Okay, not the best meal you'll ever have, but so much better than you'd expect from a place with $16 surf and turf special ($19 with filet mignon).  We went for a 30th birthday party and had a great time for very little money.  Each order came with a free glass of wine (red, rose or white), bread and a salad.  The bread comes on a board with a knife (for you to cut yourself) with a tasty herbed butter that's got good flavor but not too much garlic.  The house dressing is a honey French dressing and delicious.  I'd go back just for the salad with that dressing.  The filet was fine, but order a little rarer than you usually like it -- Medium-rare came back closer to medium, but still tender.  The lobster and shrimp we had were both over-cooked too -- a little too rubbery -- however they serve each with a nice dish of melted butter so that added enough delicious moisture it didn't matter!  We all shared a huge piece of chocolate cake and it was delicious -- just what the birthday boy wanted!",WGwjcdAGsMCBNnnrc-Fzfg,4,1,3,cv7--NpTVVf4A1RSTpZA4A

I tried the orange roughly with pasta and it was very meh, I think they add butter to the pasta which made it very ""heavy"" tasting.  The complementary bread they serve was very good.",sIDgOgDyl4pgLjC6BknWkg,1,0,4,A8uobx0BiC677plHmu6wGQ

The meatballs were spiced just right and cooked perfect. The sauce was light and very tasty. One down side that I experienced was the same as others was with the over dressed salad. It was swimming in dressing. The atmosphere was fun and lively.  I would recommend this restaurant.,6wEAY37mZxHhCKHBtS3Wfw,0,0,4,JXdCyc1Lwmv0btSnlcrWBA

1671195,2012-11-25,0,ljUba4BS4SgzlVYznuMrQQ,"We had dinner at Pasta Pirate in the California Hotel in downtown Las Vegas. We ate with family members (6 adults + 1 child). We had reservations at 6pm on a Friday night and we were seated right away. Nichole was our server and she was very friendly. The Italian bread came in a square shape and we cut them into slices, and there was garlic butter served with the bread.

We ordered two orders of the steamed clams, and it was delicious, cooked with tomatoes, garlic and butter.  My husband and I each ordered the Chef special of filet mignon and lobster ($19), which came with a choice of salad or soup, house wine (choice of white, burgundy, or rose), and the entree came with broccoli, choice of rice, red-skinned potatoes, or pasta with marinara sauce. We usually order our steak medium well; the steak was flatter than we expected, so it was dry, Next time, we'll order it medium instead of medium well. I shared my special with my 11 year old daughter and Nichole was kind enough to split our salad, as well as our entre for us. The salad was great and we really liked the honey french dressing. My husband liked the seafood soup.

Other family members got the Blackened Orange Roughy, Chilean Sea Bass with Shitake Mushrooms, and the Blackened Salmon. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Unfortunately, our entrees took a long time for us to receive - about an hour! The good thing is that we weren't starving because we had our salads and our appetizers.",RIB4J2PDgOJnyEK-gXJrsg,2,1,4,8ZHftNfi944zrDPWy90yXA

Boy was I disappointed... the crab legs were super dry! I'd hate to say it.... but next time I'll go upstairs to Aloha and save my money for gambling. 

The only plus was the free glass of wine and the fresh bread with garlic butter.

A pal and I wanted a break from the tables on Fremont so ambled on over to the California casino. We sat down and the server asked us what we'd like to drink. Seeing on the menu that a glass of house wine came with dinner I asked what kind of wine was the house? ""Uhhh....we have red, white and pink"" I almost melted to the floor laughing...I ended up with the white which wasn't bad for a house :-)
We split the baked Oysters, which for anyone else is called Oysters Rockefeller...and they were done well...perhaps a tad overdone..but a tasty dish for 10 bucks. I had the cajun Orange Roughie over pasta. Now...let me say this...I have never uttered the words ""too much garlic"" in the same sentence...but this one was close. ...and I LOVE garlic. The cajun spices were either too light or just blasted out of my mouth by the garlic. For me, I liked it...but to those with a normal palate...it would have been too much. One nice touch was the sous chef came around to the tables to see how things were. Service was full of aloha...so..when i'm back in Vegas downtown...I'll stop in again.",-tnodf38uCXjogMhZtcWxw,0,0,4,wGqJHWd9I9fCtXZS7mFuyw

We were seated no problem,maybe because it was a Tuesday night. The lighting is dim and romantic. We were given piping hot fresh baked bread with a scoop of butter with roasted garlic. It was delicious. Then we ordered an appetizer:the seafood medly. It was small but very good . Little oven roasted casserole scoops of buttery cheesy shrimps,lobster,& crab. Then for our entree we split the Coippino. It was huge,and came with a salad,and a glass of the house wine.The Cioppino had Lobster,King Crab Legs,Huge pieces of seafood. I was so impressed.

3547850,2012-11-04,0,ljUba4BS4SgzlVYznuMrQQ,"The casino/hotel recommends that you  make a reservation for the place, so we did. Yes, that was a smart move. We went at our appointment time and was seated immediately, while there were parties waiting for  tables. This was a plus..

Well, things went down hills from there. The waitress really did not want to recommend anything, we asked her about the specials they had for the nights, she wanted us to order the regular menu, so we did. 

I ordered the Blackened Orange Roughy,  the fish was totally burned, I did not understand how the chef could burn it so bad and still have the heart to serve it.. However, the pasta that came with it was tasty, I will be fair about that.

My mom ordered Fillet Mignon with baby lobster tail, again the lobster was overdone, the fillet was too, considering we ordered it done medium.

Do not order their crab cakes, I had it for appetizer, this thing was so little and tasted worse than the frozen ones a person can get at a supermarket..

The waitress saw that I finished my plate, so she came over, and took both my mom's and my plates, when Mom was still working on hers. I was so disgusted with the place by then, I did not protest, I told Mom , let's just get something else from the cafeteria..

By the way, for the dinners, you have a choice of seafood soup or salad. I recommend sticking to the salad,  we ordered both, the soup was nothing special, however, the salad and the dressing was good. 

Horrible service, horrible food, the cooks needed to be replaced or needed more trainings, or needed to put their hearts in cooking. I hope the California Casino managers are reading this...",aC9MwzP7nkzM2kO6Ngws8g,2,0,2,vGSZHuBYTm7DRj4kytp9hA

I was greeted by a friendly hostess with a beautiful smile. My primary server was, like the hostess, friendly. In addition, she was informative, attentive and professional. The secondary servers were also attentive and friendly.

I ordered the filet mignon/lobster tail for my dinner entree. A house salad and house bread accompanied the entree. The honey french salad dressing was delicious, all ingredients were well blended and balanced. The garlic butter served with the house bread was excellent! The filet was grilled a perfect medium and the lobster tail was not overcooked and succulent.

3566408,2013-02-09,1,ljUba4BS4SgzlVYznuMrQQ,"Don't let the name fool you - Pasta Pirate is DELISH! 

I've taken several people here, and it took some convincing. With a name like Pasta Pirate, people expect some kind of Italian Chucky Cheese. I get a lot of weird looks, but once they get inside and try the food they're hooked! 

The restaurant is VERY small and intimate. You have to make reservations otherwise you'll easily have at least an hour and a half wait. While it's inconvenient for walk up dining, it adds a bit of ""exclusivity"" and insider/regular knowledge, which makes it kind of part of the fun. 

The food is delicious and a great value for the money. Each dinner is served with amazing bread, salad and a glass of house wine. I highly recommend the clam Linguine with White Sauce. 

If I could change one thing about this place, it would be the name. Then maybe I'd have an easier time convincing people to go! That coupled with the pretty much reservation only system and the small size (can't handle large groups) make it a 4 Star review for me.

Walked in promptly for our 8pm reservations and stood behind a couple that had 8:30pm reservations. They were asked to be seated and the hostess checked us in and asked us to take a seat. She walked around the restaurant (I'm assuming to look for open tables), came back to the front and asked the couple who had later reservations if the booth close to another table would be okay. They said yes, she seated them and then we waited another half an hour before we were seated. Seriously?! I guess reservation times don't matter, as long as you check in prior to the people that do. I asked for the manager because I was curious as to why this happened. He said he'd ask the hostess, then came back and explained to us that she said she was frazzled because there was a crowd of people checking in at the same time. Nope, after she checked us in, there wasn't anyone behind us for a few minutes. Told the manager that and he said she would come over to apologize but she looked teary eyed and said she needed a smoke to all down. Really? Oh, I'm so sorry if I hurt your feelings because you don't know how to do your job and then have a crappy boss that doesn't know not to share that information with the customer. The manager offered to buy us each a drink (we said no thank you) or a dessert (we didn't want anything). On top of that, at the very end, it took a while for our credit cards to be processed. With that said, I don't blame the server and my one star rating was upped to two because of her. Beatrice did a great job with trying to make sure we were taken care of and checked in on us often. It's more for the overall experience and with that said, I won't be back. 

As for the food, we each just ordered the Alaskan King Crab and it was salty. For $40, I'd rather stand in line for a buffet than come back here.",4OC4NuteeJkPSQeSiJLvRQ,1,0,2,ySMXWD73jtY0l3xu_FcMVw

Apparently all of her friends back home had told her about how delicious it was. Unfortunately, we didn't know that they only served it during certain hours (I believe it was 11:00 pm - 9:00 am) and she was leaving that night. So we decided to try out Pasta Pirate next door. We walked in about 5 minutes before they opened and already there were many people waiting inside. We didn't have a reservation, but because we got there early, we were able to get a table. This is a pretty small restaurant that gets crowded very quickly.

The menu is small, but the pasta was surprisingly very good! I ordered the Penne Diana, which comes with sautéed chicken and broccoli. The garlic butter sauce was very tasty and not overpowering. It was also a little spicy, but not to the point where my mouth was on fire. My mom ordered the pasta of the day, which I believe was the mushroom ravioli. She enjoyed it and offered me some, but I don't eat mushrooms. The portions were just right. I got full, but still had room for some dessert! Speaking of desserts, I would not order them from here. We tried the creme brûlée, which was very bland, and the ice cream tasted like something cheap that you could buy at the market. Every dinner includes bread, soup or salad, and a glass of wine. We both don't drink wine, so I can't comment on that. But if you order the salad, make sure you tell them to go light on the dressing or ask for it on the side because they put way too much! I chose Italian so my salad was very sour!

Service was friendly and attentive. Our server checked on us often, our drinks were always refilled and we didn't have to wait very long for our food even though it was a full house in the restaurant.

Very good pasta, but skip the dessert! Oh, and they give you a bunch of Andes mints when you pay your bill. :) I wouldn't mind coming back here again.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,3,4,Z76K4cMHKbSDOGGytW6hdg
