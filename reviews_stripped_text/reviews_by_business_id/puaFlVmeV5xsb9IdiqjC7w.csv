Asked for a double bacon whopper with cheese no onions or pickles and I got a single with no cheese with onions and pickles.

I seen several kids meals going out the drive through window also.  So I stand all the way by the pickup counter waiting for someone to come by so I can ask, and I get ignored for several minutes.  Finally a supervisor person tells me my order is coming up next, so of course I wait a few minutes when they place a tray of food out and call out the #.  Guess what, not my order either.  So the supervisor asks what my order was and I hand him my reciept.  He does not apologize for the wait or anything but turns and yells my order to some cooks.  He then asks me what sauce we want for the kids nuggets, I ask for Ranch and he hands me like 6 ranches, like that will make up for now having to wait like 20 minutes.

LOL there's nothing wrong with the burger itself it's the typical Whooper and I love me some whooper sometimes very yummy blah blah blah everyone knows how a Whooper taste like but it's got a little bit of a kick with the hint of A1 sauce which is a nicely welcome taste I think not too overwhelming but the bun yet yummy and fun it was just the weirdest thing to bit into a super Black bun and have it play a mind trick in your brain. 

All in all you gotta try it once it's good and you have to experience it for yourself to know what I'm talking about and how triply it is.

Clean and that's including the staff. While I was waiting on my breakfast for my wife and i I noticed they had a little game kiosk which I must say was fun while i was waiting. I like how they had different variations of booths, some high and some average height. The food was fresh and hot and the assistant manager Fernando was on point in getting the order right the first time with a smile. I must say the big screen TV was an added on plus if i decided to eat there.",3yd4z70E9Sf91MoKSJw73g,0,0,3,5He-X9Gxjrc4YzCu9tlY3A

This Burger King has given me by far the worst customer service I have ever received.  They forgot to give us sauce so I kindly said hey can I can have some sauce you forgot the sauce... he rudely said ""so?what you want""


I said wow... 

If you work at a place that is about to great customer service and dont want to provide it then do not work there.

If you happen to check in here and notice the reviews while waiting for your food, please double check to see if your order is right. There has been multiple times when a different burger from what I intentionally ordered ended up in my bag. And taste your soda! It might be flat.

Also, if you're mad about the situation and is the type of person to be proactive about it instead of complaining about it to the next person you encounter, call to speak with the manager since he/she will reimburse you for the same meal. The other reviews stand corrected on this specific location. I guess I was one of the unfortunates also. *face palm*

I'd still go back for their soft serve though.",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,2,1,2,awu6ZIVziBc69cHKR7Tslw

Get machines that work and people who know how to use them.  Frankly any idiot can. And than they blame my card because it has scratches when it's brand new --what a joke and this has happened at multiple locations and nowhere else so it's their crappy machines for sure: zero compassion either like really were you not going to give me my $4 order for the kids in my car if my card didn't work?

Today I come and I try the drive thru.  They ya e a double drive thru.  One had a vehicle and the person was placing a order I went to the open spot.  I sat there easily 5 minutes and then I backed up and tried again. I finally decided to go to the other spot and I then sat there for another couple minutes.  Finally a guy comes and I can't here him and he can't here me so I finally just backed up and left.  

I guess these service issues explain why this location had no customer except the 1 ahead of me (who some how got service).

But today, i decided to go to Burger King on the way home to grab something to eat for my husband and I. As I get home my husbands asks if I'm eating, and than I realize they forgot to put my food in the bag. No problem, I work in retail so I figured I'll send my husband to pick up my food and at least get a refund on my meal for the inconvenience. Not the whole meal, just mine. So I call a first time to let them know hay they had forgotten to put my food in the bag to which they reply ""yes, I actually have it right here. Can you come by and pick it back up?"" To which I reply ""uh, yes that's fine"". Later on as my husband is on his way I decide to call to ask for the refund and notice that they hadn't even given me a receipt.. so of course when I call they say "" there isn't much I can do if you don't have your receipt or bring back the food."" I thought I had explained myself wrong since the second phone call was not with the same lady so I repeat "" no you see I called back and they said that indeed they had forgotten to put my food in the bag and so I don't need a whole refund just on my meal"". To which she still replies "" im sorry I can't unless you don't want your sandwich back....."". Ummmmm if I had accidentally led two thing out of your bag than out of good customer service I'm gonna do at least something for your inconvenience.. I didn't think asking for 8 dollars and something change back was that big of a deal. None the less, food is fine but I can't go to a place where the customer service sucks.. it would be going against everything I believe in when it comes to pleasing customers/ guests. Probably doesn't matter at all to them but I will NEVER be going there again and I advise you to visit any other of the fast food spots around the area!!",joOD24tapUFGru0sRL_o0w,0,0,1,JeqAMY_KHDWlUNV3mlWglA

As we were walking to the car, the drive thru lights turned off. We followed another car through the drive thru but nobody attempted to take our orders so we decided to just drive through to leave. There was another car at the window and the driver said they're not closed. After 2 minutes of waiting, a worker came to the window and said their mic was down. (If their mic was down, wouldn't you want to keep the lobby open? Or put a sign at the drive thru? Let alone, keep your lights on?) So we waited for the lady in front to place her order. We were able to order but they clearly didn't care about how they served our food, literally just dumped in the bag. Anyways, as we drove off, we noticed their ""Drive Thru Open Late Sign""... yeah okay.. they just wanted to close early and get away with it by saying their mic was broken. no excuses burger king!

There's a play space inside for the rug rats to run amuck in while you dream of better days ahead. They have some new crazy menu items like fruit loop shakes and the Cheetos mac and cheese bites. Not my thing but look ok. Close to home I'll return in sure. Nothing bad to say nothing to rave about.,grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,3,3C1WVHoHDlTsPhei5BLxOg
