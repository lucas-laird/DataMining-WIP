67995,2016-03-20,2,V_TxEdzeEs8P5nGPANOY7A,If I could give less stars I woud. Should have read yelp reviews first. Man this was by far the worse pizza I have ever tasted. The stoned people at the party even  turned it down. There was so much sauce they could have made 4 pizzas those tiny Pepperoni's didn't stand a chance . So sad because I would have been a returning customer but all jokes aside there were so many red flags not to order from here from the phone call to order pizza being placed on hold for 20 mins but couldn't hang up because of a  conversation I could hear because I really wasn't placed onhold. Then the fact it took 1 hour to get  the pizza.  So sad that there is two whole pizzas left. Wasted Money......,iWVUMXpr8ApX9sdrQzwP1Q,1,0,1,-p0BG1fAIAxYFOFSGtTCbg

However, we also ordered a buffalo chicken pizza for my husband.  I have to say, it was the most ridiculously hot sauce we have ever eaten.  I tried some, and it was tear-inducing, even with only two bites.  My husband loves spicy food, and puts Tabasco on everything.  While he way able to finish the pizza (I never could have), it became more of a ""Man vs. Food"" challenge, and wasn't enjoyable at all.  And the pain lasted two days :)  Please exercise caution if ordering the buffalo wings or buffalo pizza, as the sauce goes way beyond pleasantly hot to painfully hot.",f5VhM7K8M0kuepoe6Sv13A,1,0,3,aviTtZAlRukv4SAUYagU2w

We immediately contacted the restaurant back and was told by Hunter that he was going to contact the driver. We waited 20 minutes and called back to find that our pizza was being remade because of the error. That was at 10:30. We knew that you closed at 11:00, but, thought that in good faith we could get our pizza.  When it wasn't delivered by 11:00 we called back and of course the shop was closed. We paid $45 cash for a large 4 topping pizza and received a 1 topping pizza. We waited to get a pizza, never received it and had to eat a cold pizza. 

This is an unfortunate event and it's even more unfortunate that you have employees working for the company that aren't true to their word and don't care about customer service.

Once we got the pizza it smelt AMAZING!!! We took the first bite it was a little bit hot in temperature so we let it cool down for couple minutes. Once it cool down we tried it again and it was delicious. You could taste every flavor from the barbecue sauce to the cheeses into the chicken. You can taste the freshness of each item. However after having a couple slices my mouth started to burn a little and that was from their barbecue sauce. I told Chef Anthony and he told me that they are working on fixing that spice level. That made me happy. 

Overall this is one of the greater pizza places in Las Vegas. Yes it may be on the more expensive side however you pay for what you get!!!",3g0SGzfgzev_g_KwValD9Q,2,3,5,6XbqYtc9MKOYqscA2g93SA

3 choices of sauce and lots of toppings. It was nice to be able to watch the pizza get made and decide what we wanted on the pizza as it is being made.
Our first pizza we ordered was a 16"" Hawaiian pizza with the original sauce. The family loved the pizza and it was great to see the kids eat the crust (most pizza places they throw away the crust).
The second pizza was a 16"" with organic sauce and pepperoni, italian sausage and spicy capicola. The sauce was GREAT! The entire pizza was great.

3962036,2015-03-24,0,V_TxEdzeEs8P5nGPANOY7A,"by itself, i give 4 stars, but compared to other options nearby, in regards to portion and pricing, id drop it down to 3 stars.

ordered a large pizza that was half greek roulette / half wild card.  the greek half was full of flavors that blended well together, and the wild card half was definitely above and beyond your average pepperoni pie in terms of taste.  I'm not usually a fan of thin crust, or pizza cut into squares for that matter, but this was baked just right and overall a good pizza.

again, my issue is with portion and price.  i have no problem dropping $30 on a pie from Joes, but i walk out with a 19 inch pizza that won't even fit in my fridge.  the 16 inch large pizza from HighRoller was a bit underwhelming (for the price).  that 3 inches may not seem like much, but its actually a huge difference.

*Using the surface area equation: A=Pi x R2
16 inch pizza   3.14x 8 x 8 =200.96 
19 inch pizza   3.14 x 9.5 x 9.5 =283.38 

i also ordered a philly sub.  hands down delicious.  grass fed beef has a gamey flavor that was complimented by the mushrooms and peppers.  also mozzarella was a surprisingly good choice to round it out (although there could have been more of it).  again, delicious.  but we come back to portion and pricing.  if a Capriottis sub had a premature baby... the subs here would be it.

i purchased the yelp deal that was worth $40, and in return i got a 16 inch pizza, a sub, and a 20oz soda.  not sure the value is there.  i realize the cost of organic/free range/non processed ingredients drive up the price, but it seems a bit too much (or maybe I'm just cheap).

company should consider providing a bit more info on the ingredients that demand these prices.  people who seek out healthy food alternatives want more than just an organic or free range stamp (like what state the veggies are grown in, or what farm the animals are from).  ""High Roller Pizza carefully handpicks and scrutinizes every single one of their ingredients"" yet offers very little detailed information to the customer.

all that being said, ill certainly be back.  its right down the street from me, and a great alternative to the chain pizza joints.",zon0P8_zH_lvt1XvAQUxBQ,1,0,4,Au6k4IFZtFNOJTpLN3GfIw

My husband tried conversations with him in a friendly manner and the guy gave short responses and never looked up at him. Less than good customer service. Not very friendly people working this day.

Roller.
Pizza.
Wait, no. That was the old restaurant. Once again, High Roller Pizza has new management (as of 6/13/16)  and this time it seems they're dedicated to getting it right. The new official name is ""High Roller Pizzeria"" (see what they did there?), the menu consists of many of the original specialty pizzas customers have come to love, and the staff is very friendly.

But you're here for the verdict on the pizza.

Well, I'm no Judge Judy but the jalapeño/pineapple (my fave) that the chef whipped up was very satisfying. The ingredients were fresh and most importantly, the cheese was nice and gooey but not over the top. The pizza didn't have that nasty grease you get with $1 cheese slices in New York (that you have to dab with a napkin) but it did have a similarly thin crust. Not super thin; but not California-style crust. In between. It works. Had a slight buttery taste which I liked.

This is the kind of pizza that is deceptively delicious. It seems like a lightweight Amir Khan pizza but a few slices in and you are officially a heavyweight/fat ass.

There was a steady stream of customers coming in while I waited for my pizza. Surprising since this place was officially closed the past few weeks as the new management took over. Good location or branding, I guess? Or maybe people love the way the pizza tastes. I did oooooobviouslyyy. 

I also met the owners and they are hella cool. Yep.

There's a few high tables and chairs. Now that's ok if it's mainly a take out spot. My best friend and I a huge pizza and wing guys. So naturally we ordered a large pepperoni and order of wings. It was $40! For a 14inch pizza, 12 wings, and to smaller bottle drinks (no fountains) and very limited beverage selection. Now so far I'm still on the fence. While sitting waiting for the food we both noticed something called wing Wednesday. This was 6 free wings when spending over $30. Although this was not offered to us we mentioned it. The younger kid behind the counter actually said they don't offer it because it's not cost effective for the company and it must be requested at time of order!!??!!! Are you kidding me! So now the food comes. It's a very thin crust pizza which is ok. It's no where near an authentic quality pizza. It's ok, not the worse not the best just ok. The wings were absolutely horrid. Rubbery, baked, and no real sauce. Overall we were very disappointed with the customer service, the quality, atmosphere, and mainly the price! Very very over priced. So the reason for the one star is everything adding up and weighing out to that. We will not be back and wish this place all the luck.",GvOOuw79pEMXQ0nI5DHQjA,2,0,1,CAi84lAEpEaksmPgk0zerg
