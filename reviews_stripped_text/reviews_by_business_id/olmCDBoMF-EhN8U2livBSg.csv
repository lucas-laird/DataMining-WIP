I drove 13 mile one way to get this cake because I know Freeds is the best, or was the best. The new location is terribly disappointing, no breads or muffins like before, just pastry and cookies. But the biggest disappointment was the Boston Cream Pie cake, which was dry and the cream is susposed to be like a pudding/custard, and it was instead cream!  And the frosting was layered on so thick we scraped it off! Save your time and money, because it's not cheap.

And I found it, I ordered over the phone and told Ellia exactly what my daughter had want and when I picked it up ohh my goodness I couldn't believe my eyes just the bakery alone was awesome  it was filled with colorful cookies, cupcakes, cakes, and other yummy deserts, then when they brought out my cake it was absolutely fabulous I was in love with the art work and colors was the best I've seen it was really unique with handmade decorations as well. We were on a birthday trip so I just wanted to order everything it looked so scrumptious, and yummy, it was eye catching with beautiful colors... So my order was a 8""round little mermaid chocolate cake with Bavarian cream filling and it was totally worth it the cake was moist, soft, dense, tasty, and not real sweet...the filling was great also it was like a light whipped/buttercream kind of filling was also awesome very tasty and not too sweets well. I couldn't leave without some snacks I got 1/2lb. Of a mix assortment of cookies I chose m&ms, sprinkles, green mint, lemon, and cinnamon...the m&ms and sprinkle cookies was basically sugar cookies but it was a light sugar cookie not too dense very yummy, the cinnamon was also like a sugar cookie and with chocolate swirl it was very light as well and also yummy, then oh my the green mint cookie was 2 mint chocolate chip cookies with green mint filling it was like a dream so yummy very tasty like sanfrancisco mint ice cream very delicious and also light, then I was drawn to the lemon cookie and it was also a great idea it was soon wonderful I love, love, love it I should have gotten more but it was a lemon filling covered in white chocolate and very soft it was so tasty my mouth is watering as I speak or type but it was all very very delicious cookies! I also got a per pack of chocolate coconut macaroons and it was totally worth every penny I love,love, love it too. Overall this place is wonderful it's worth every penny you spend and the service is soon excellent they make you feel so comfortable very friendly! Thank you Freeds bakery for making my daughter have a wonderful 5th birthday celebration here in Las Vegas and for making such scrumptious deserts!

But I ordered some cookies, a cupcake, a chocolate covered strawberry, and gelato. I felt a little rushed due to the fact that every time I ordered something I got the ""anything else...""

The chocolate ganache is to die for.  I've also had the strawberry shortcake before on my birthday, and the people at my bday dinner killed it--as in there was literally only crumbs left.

My one complaint is that the ladies who take the orders are not always particularly friendly.  I get that it's a famous bakery and they're really busy, especially with more expensive cake orders.

Tip: make sure u order online for delivery AFTER you know the room number you're staying in and the reservation name the room is under and they will call you as a heads up ahead of time real quick just to ask if they need a key to access the elevator which at cosmo he didn't since we were on the 59th floor. 

But they call about 10-15 mins, before (I'm assuming when they arrive by the lobby) delivering it to your door. 

The guy delivering the cake was super cool and nice and made it a quick exchange which was awesome since I was hurrying to keep it a surprise till my gf woke up. His name I think was Ramon (sorry if I misspell) 

I thanked him, gave him a tip (tip your delivery ppl!)
It was such a hot day out and I wanted to even hug the guy for being out there delivering cakes in such high temps an keeping the cake in perf condition I mean man! That takes good heart and talent! Lol

He mentioned the bakery's history a bit and I knew I just had to review this place and let people know this place is definitely worth it. I have yet to find a bakery that makes unicorn cakes this pretty and delivers easy quick service.

Also the fondant paw prints that I had ordered on the cake did not look like the paw prints that me and the cake designer had agreed upon... There was a copy of cake design that I had and I'm pretty sure they had as well that showed how it was suppose to look. When I received my cake there was also multiple finger prints on the cake and it looked like the back of the cake got a little destroyed when they were putting it in the box . The only plus side was the custom piggy bank topper they created for my cake (very cute and detailed!). I appreciate the effort that put into the cake and understand it must've taken a lot of hard work and patience from the bakers and designers but this cake was a let down :(,uL0PHOnZ5pYTJOM1yUswLw,0,0,1,kOJF3ZIYFgWCAltGPysdBw

I will echo the sentiments of many of the other reviewers: the cake was excellent, but the communication left a LOT to be desired.

I first got in touch with Jayme, the contact person assigned to my venue. I contacted her by phone and received some good information.  Things only started going downhill when I tired to communicate with her by email, which was necessary as I lived in a time zone with a three hour time difference from Las Vegas.  After several emails with no response, and a phone call with no response, I finally had to ask my venue to intervene. I received a phone call promptly with excuses for why my emails were not received, but it was all very ""dog ate my homework."" However, Jayme did make up for it by upgrading my wedding cake at no charge, which went a long way to alleviating my annoyance.

I continued to have communication issues leading all the way up to the day of the wedding, when the delivery person called me to get the number for the venue.  Since my venue uses Freed's almost exclusively, I was mystified as to why they would call the bride on her wedding day to get a phone number. I worked with several vendors through my venue and this was the only vendor through my venue that I had any issues with.

Given these issues, I was quite skeptical about how this cake was going to turn out.  Luckily, it was AMAZING!  We got chocolate/chocolate mousse, vanilla/strawberry filling, and carrot cake/cream cheese filling. Everyone talked about how delicious and moist the cake was. It also looked beautiful. 

So, to sum up: if you like excellent cake and have a lot of patience, Freed's Bakery is the place to go.",WEVpzYPuctXvprEt0uRzfA,1,0,3,ub0Vivt1_AgnDs7Y4L53jw

We have never been to Freeds before so I just showed up to pick up my cake, guessing it wouldn't take long because it was a pick up. I ended up waiting 1 hr 15 min on a Sunday... I was so frustrated with my hungry 4 year old in tow. The cake was pretty but over priced. When the woman put my cake in the box the top was too high and she smooshed the icing flowers on top. She said sorry... That's it. That rubbed me the wrong way. Does she not box cakes all day? Shouldn't she know how to not ruin it? We were excited to taste the cake but when we did we were very disappointed. It's as if they completely forgot the sugar in the icing. My 4 year old didn't even eat it, that's how bad it was. The marble cake and chocolate filling was good but we all scooped out the insides and left all the beautiful flowers and frosting. After feeling like I wasted 40$ on unsweetened icing I called in and you know what that woman to me? ""If you already are it, there's nothing we can do. Plus everyone's taste buds are different"" 3/4 of the cake is left... We didn't eat it all and icing that tastes like whipped and salted butter is NOT a taste bud issue. I've had buttercream...

Right when you come in, don't forget to get a number because if not, you'll just be standing around wondering when you are going to get your turn to order something (common in Jewish bakeries to have to get a number in order to be served). 

So anyways, this is what my husband and I got:

Chocolate forest cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freeds-bakery-las-vegas?select=K-JsYU_Gu4OI8vYvsQzpYA#K-JsYU_Gu4OI8vYvsQzpYA)- deliciously chocolately. A wonderful combination of cherries, chocolate and cream. But is a bit pricey for $4.94 per small slice.

Mint cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freeds-bakery-las-vegas?select=K-JsYU_Gu4OI8vYvsQzpYA#58vwDEht1mdhfR0VdW0yxQ)- these cookies are really nice and melt in your mouth like texture. So happy to have purchased these.

Rainbow cookies (sorry but forgot to take a photo)- I love rainbow cookies, always order then whenever I am at a Jewish bakery. Each rainbow color of the cookie is a nice soft cake like layer and has a light sweet jelly spread in between. The cookie overall is lightly trimmed with hardened chocolate. Overall, the combination of this cookie works beautifully and rather a tasty delight. 

Prices for the cookies are based on a per pound price. You are welcomed to purchase cookies either by the half pound or pound or you could also purchase them in any amount that you wish (you could just buy 1 cookie if that's all you want... but why on earth would you waste your time coming just for 1 cookie?). 

I just wished that each cookie had a name in the display case like the cakes but unfortunately, you'll just have to guess what each cookie is. However, right when you enter in this bakery, to your right is a large free sample area (and these samples are actually the full size cookies you see in the case and not broken pieces for you to try... totally generous!). 

Service is friendly here. Oh and by the way, don't forget to yelp check in so that you can get 6 free cookies with a $6 purchase. There is also plenty of parking in this lot, as it shares the plaza with Michael's, Pier 1 Imports and Petsmart.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,1,0,5,P1m0hiQooEAo5Z6oHzoDQQ

I never bought at bakeries because I thought they were so expensive and I could get the same thing at Walmart for less than half the price. I finally ordered from here for my moms birthday because I wanted something special and OMG. 
I bought her a tiramisu slice, strawberry cake slice, chocolate covered strawberries and I got a bunch of free cookies. 
Before I keep going I have to mention that I don't like sweets. I am not at all a fan of cookies or cakes. Honestly I always say I hate cake because I think is so gross. I especially can't stand frosting. But the only cake I have ever tasted has been cheap birthday cakes from kids parties. 
I tasted the things I got for my mom and I am definitely going to keep buying from bakeries from now on. 
The titramisu was absolutely delicious but I am also a huge fan of coffee. The strawberry cake was ok. I see people say it's to die for on here but like I said I hate cake and the cake was actually decent. I would happily buy the tiramisu again. 
The chocolate covered strawberries were amazing. I thought they were ridiculously expensive but there were huge and the strawberries were definitely the best quality. So good. I buy them for my mom on her bday and on Mother's Day and I am planning on buying my aunt some too. 
But what surprised me the most were the cookies. Like I said I have never been a fan of cookies but the cookies here are nothing like I've ever seen. They gave me 6 free cookies and I LOVED them. They are very unique and have never seen cookies like this so I guess these are what cookies from an actually bakery are like! 
I will definitely be coming again and keep buying. 

I still think it's pretty pricey. The price for one cake slice can get you an entire cake at Walmart. Actually you could maybe get a cake and a half. But of course you're paying for quality. I'm not used to paying $5-$6 for one slice. Wish it was cheaper I would be here all the time but again the quality is definitely the best.",HLxTwrrNrEfLNNsw2liSuA,0,0,4,PfTQavvMMQgVWAvvwQTsbw

I had no idea what to expect so upon walking in, I just grabbed a number and waited my turn. I wasn't surprised about how busy the place was because I had heard great things about Freed's before. While waiting, I helped myself with some sample cookies up front. The M&Ms and fudge thumbprint cookies were so good.

When it was my turn, the worker let me know that cake testing is done inside the sales room which is through the glass doors. I had a feeling it would be in there but there was no signage anywhere that I could just go inside and wait for the next available consultant. I didn't want to just barge in. I think there should be a clear sign about this but oh well.

Upon walking in, Sheri acknowledged my fiance and I and helped us pick our flavors and cake design. She was very personable and really sweet. The cake flavors were all delicious! My fiance and I eventually chose red velvet with cream cheese and white cake with bavarian cream and strawberry puree. What I liked is that their 50/50 icing (50% buttercream and 50% rosette icing) is not too sweet, which is often the reason why I scrape off the icing on cakes. The icing color becomes ivory as well and rather than super white or super yellow so it's perfect for our wedding theme. I was able to choose the color for the flower on the cake as well based on ribbon swatches that Sheri showed us.

All in all, the experience was fast, not intimidating and pleasant. I'm excited to see how they design my wedding cake!",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,0,0,4,pc4fswAQ73FiCtf4BrBv-w

Everything looked god, so I filled out the online form to get them in touch with me. They called me shortly afterward and helped me choose two flavors I knew the mom-to-be would love and priced my order. It was a little more expensive than I expected, but I went with it because I wanted to make sure we got quality desserts instead of grocery store crap.

Fast forward to the day of the shower, and I send some friends to go pick them up while I take care of a few other things. They get back and cannot say enough nice things about the place, how good it smelled, how delicious everything looked, and how hungry they had suddenly become. Even though they weren't specially designed or anything, the cupcakes looked stunning. 

The mom-to-be was the first to try a cupcake and oh my, she was floored at how good they were! I first had one that was white cake frosted with strawberry buttercream. What I didn't know was that they had used REAL strawberries for the cream! It was completely amazing. The chocolate cupcakes with chocolate buttercream and coconut were every bit as good, too. 

The next day, my husband decided that we had to check this place out for ourselves. Expecting a crowd, we were quite surprised to be the only guests there on a Sunday morning. But it was exactly as had been described. Very clean, friendly, and the smells were killer. We picked up some desserts to take home with us and now I am just clamoring for the opportunity to get back up to Las Vegas and find an excuse to go back to Freed's Bakery!",GTFvw6JUi4wuIGfsoSNPbg,0,0,5,choceFcmK-sagZAxOPI2pQ

We got a fourth-tier to bring home and freeze for our 1 yr anniversary.
I kid you not we came home with more than half the cake to our hotel room. And 1 1/2 days, the cake was demolished. My personal favorite flavor was the Amaretto, we also had chocolate Bavarian and strawberry Bavarian.  Combo of butter and sugar cream frosting.

Depending on your flavor/ taste/ palette, this might be the best bakery for you. I personally think that the cakes I have tasted from them (Black forest in particular) was too rich.. and more frosting/ icing that I would have wanted. I am more about the substance (i.e. the cake itself). The ratio of cake to icing is off to me.

I began doing business with them when doing special events for a Vegas based nightclub so there were lots of things like corporate logos, specialty cakes, novelties and dessert trays ordered, mostly with blind trust, over the phone or via fax.  Not once did Freed's fall short.

Fast forward to a few destination weddings, milestone birthdays and bawdy bachelorette parties over the years and Freed's has nailed it everytime.  When a certain hotel broke a brides heart by telling her the price of its cakes for her reception, I went to Freed's website and ordered the cake online for a fraction of the cost and with the help of a fabulous bellman, delivered the cake to the reception at the hotel, no questions asked.

During my recent visit, I popped in to buy some baked goods as a hostess gift and to spoil my niece with some of their delicious baked goodies.   In a town where they worship the shiny and new, it was nice to see a busy old school bakery packing them in.  You can keep your cupcakeries and your pastisseries with their pretention and priciness, Freed's is the only sugar rush in town for me.",otSHpPYQXHdU56giRmMBGQ,2,1,4,h28xMp8AJaHJVe1FXW2suQ

Because we were having a destination wedding in Las Vegas, we weren't there ahead of time to do a tasting. I feel like a tasting would have solved the one problem we had with our cake. It was 3 layers and we did different flavors on each. The top was chocolate cake with cherry filling, which was wrapped up and put in the freezer, so I can't really review that. The middle layer was their almond cake with amaretto mousse filling and it was absolutely to die for. Far and away the crowd pleaser. I'm normally not a big fan of white cakes however this one was so moist and flavorful. Definitely not your average white/vanilla. The bottom layer was chocolate with what they call Bavarian cream. Now my husband and I would definitely have to disagree with that. When we think Bavarian cream we think of soft creamy gooey filling, almost like what you fill a donut with. What they gave us was buttercream frosting. We were pretty unenthused about that and what was left after the guests ate their fill got tossed because we were not impressed. The chocolate cake was moist and delicious but it was just very plane and boring with such a thick layer of plain buttercream in the middle. The cake was decorated beautifully and was delivered on the early side of their timeslot that they specified. All and all it was a great experience and I would order a cake from them again. I would just make sure to avoid the Bavarian cream and get extra of the almond cake as everyone was raving about it!",hONHEFusolD1gvoRGQRLMQ,1,0,4,5W4a8cn_j3cnawlO8Dmnhw

Ending up picking the 7 layer cake which gives you a generous amount and isn't too sweet either. Recommend eating the cake with a drink since it can get a little dry between all the layers.

Julie called me prior to delivery and when I explained what I was dealing with she generously stated it would be no problem to change. Well, we still had issues and Julie offered to leave the cake with concierge. She did and I was thankful. However, the hotel calls me and says they have it but cannot refrigerate it and I was ""Lucky"" they allowed the outside delivery at all. Not knowing what to do, I called Julie back to see if I could bring it back or if she could pick up and I would pick up the next day. Julie was fantastic! She went back picked up the cake, texted me she had done so and offered 3 additional time frames to deliver the next day. Well, I was not able to pick a time and went and picked up the next day.

He quickly came across Freed's because of their great reputation and reached out to see if they were the right ""partner"" for this project. The staff at Freed's was incredibly patient and excited to help execute a first for them- a Ninja Turtles themed wedding cake. 

The cake was absolutely amazing to look at and to eat! My husband worked with Max who executed his vision perfectly. We ended up with a three tiered NInja Turtles cake that had a pizza base, skyline layer, then the turtles at the top. The cake was elaborate with multiple flavors of cake and icing. It was a huge hit with everyone. My only wish is that I could've taken the leftovers back to Philly with us. 

A year later we decided to celebrate our anniversary in Vegas. My husband surprised me with another smaller cake from Freed's with an image of a stag beetle (don't ask) on it.

Tucked away in Henderson, Freed's is a traditional bakery offering simply decorated, layered cakes with a wide variety of flavors.  The main reason is that the bakers at Freed's produce soft and moist cakes with delicious frosting.  And don't undersell the value of a moist cake in the desert.  Most bakeries in the Vegas valley churn out dry cake that just doesn't taste right.  The reason?  It's a desert.  It's dry.  Moisture bakes away in the oven as well.  Add those two moisture-evaporating forces and most of the bakeries in town turn out unappealing, fairly tasteless cake (especially some of the cupcake shops . . . [ahem, looking at you Cupcakery]).  But Freed's has solved this problem and every cake out of their oven is tasty, soft and . . . well, pretty much perfectly baked.

They also have a wide-selection of cookies and cakes.  For folks hoping to find some traditional Jewish baked treats, Freed's is a Jewish bakery and carries a wide variety of the treats your grandmother used to make.

I've heard a few people complain that the prices at Freed's are a little high, but I generally disagree.  The bakery is more expensive than picking up a sheet cake from the local grocery store, but the extra coin is worth it since the cake from Freed's is soooooo much better than generic grocery cake.

So four stars for a classic bakery putting out consistently quality cakes.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,1,0,4,olZQkcNi-qcpv8fJY9sUxA

This new location was so nice- a real upgrade from the first (although I prefer the Eastside location because it feels smaller and more ""local""). This location feels more down to business and professional, which isn't a bad thing at all. 

The spinning cake display visible at both locations seems to lull you into a ""get everything you see because it's allllll good"" hype, but I'm loyal to my brown derby- whipped topping, perfectly fluffly chocolate cake, strawberries, and bavarian cream. 

This most recent brown derby was as heavenly as the first. Just for some reference, my boyfriend is a pie man. He's so much a pie man that he suggested the world switch to birthday pie and that we have a wedding pie. He had a slice of brown derby a few years ago... and asked for a second slice. He even shares my enthusiasm to go back to Freed's whenever we can. THAT'S how good it is. 

I was fortunate this time to have purchased a groupon, which discounted the usually $26 cake to $18, which allowed me to buy a slice of wedding cake (brown derby with bavarian cream filling and white cake) and expand my horizons a bit. 

I would strongly suggest following Freed's on Facebook as they often have amazing deals and specials (i.e. $1 cupcakes for an hour, free cookies for the first 100 people, etc).

2178455,2016-08-06,3,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"The Skinny: although not a fan of their cookies, I come back for their cake and challah (4) service is great and friendly(5)value is fair for the quality and quantity(4.5).

It's been a while since I've been back at Freed's but there are definitely reasons to love it.

The main reason to go is their Chocolate Parisian hands down. The cake crumb is light, moist and not overly bitter. The chocolate whipped cream (not frosting) matches perfectly with the cake and just the right amount to leave you satisfied. I like the fact that it is not too sweet or fudge-like which is common at most bakeries.

Their black forest cake is great too. I like that their cherry filling isn't too gummy and sports chunks of cherries. Yummy!

At $32 for a 9 inch cake for this quality, it is very reasonably priced. When we get one for other people to try, they are usually impressed.

You could get a singular slice of cake if you prefer but somehow when you purchase a whole cake it seems to hold up better than just a slice (The slices tend to dry out quickly... It is Vegas after all.). So don't be a wuss and pony up for the whole thing. Oh and FYI - make sure your car is cool when you transport the cake to your destination. Hot car and real whipped cream = no es bueno.

Their wedding cakes are delicious too. On my suggestion, my friend got her wedding cake here. They made her a beautiful cake that looked and tasted incredible.

I also discover first Friday of the month Challah. OMG... So good. It had just the right texture - soft with a slight chew. The mildly sweet egg makes this a perfect snack plain or buttered toast or French toast. At $7 for a sizable loaf, it is well worth it.

Although as a bakery they offer cookies and other baked goodies, those tend to be outshone by their cakes and Challah for me. Honestly, their Italian cookies are just okay in my book. But then again, I am not a huge fan of Italian cookies so it may just be a taste preference.

Service is friendly and the lady behind the counter was nice enough to help me with my cake to the car as I was carrying my little one into the store. 

For the delicious cakes and Challah and reasonable prices, this place gets a 4 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,3,4,NBsWIMav7mqhZNRGws_jCQ

It something that all business owners should try too do if possible. You won Sugi heart right off the top with such thoughtful gesture. Not only too support great cause but family because know great kid autistic. Still has biggest smile and buying over dozen cupcakes was a honor in life. 

Since it was cupcakes for Autism they had three different selection too choose from and min of six too order. I was all for because planning on getting dozen or more. I got the equal amounts of each one. My favorite was the red velvet cupcake. I am pushover comes too most if not all things red velvet. I really liked the flavor, moist, and just right. The frosting fell little short on all the cupcakes. I thought that could have had more flavor. maybe more sweet, or something cause just tasted ok. Not sure since it was special but still for dollar really nothing much too complain about peeps. It all went too great cause!!! 

I liked the fact that when you check in you get six free cookies. I agree with previous reviews that the cookies are relatively small no matter what cookie you choose. Still looking at the selection too choose from nothing too complain about. I had the m&m cookie and lemon butter cookie or something like it. 

The whole experience brought back found memories of growing up going too bakery back home.. You would pull number wait till number call. During that time looking at the displays of all delicious pastries, cakes, cookies, and thinking dessert heaven. Or when kid thinking that the birthday cake you want. They even have section of gelato too choose from too. The smell is amazing when you walk in all the desserts made daily. Unfortunately only had chance too try the cupcakes but no doubt plan on coming back too try more tasty treats again.

It was 2:00 on Tuesday afternoon and the lot had one car in it save for the Freed's delivery cars. But they were open.
The shelves were full of colorful and beautiful baked goods and a rotating showcase of cakes. Yelp had a check in special where you get 4 free cookies if you spend $6. With this assortment, that was easy.
We settled on a slice of red velvet cake, a slice of Snickers cheesecake, and Oreo cupcake, and a chocolate chip log. The cookies we chose were the M&M butter cookie, the chocolate cake cookie, the sea salt caramel chocolate cake cookie, and the chocolate caramel pecan cake cookie. *we actually got 6 free cookies as they had some samples available as well.
The red velvet was rich and soft. I wasn't a fan of the cake crumb coat on the outside as it made kind of a sandpaper texture blended in. The Snickers cheesecake was very rich but tasty. The chocolate ganache on top was perfectly smooth and lingered on my tongue. My son loved his Oreo cupcake; the chocolate cake was perfectly moist. My husband enjoyed the chocolate chip log; kind of a fancier and larger version of a chocolate croissant. The cake cookies reminded me of a Hostess cupcake with caramel oozing out of it.

2297572,2018-04-16,1,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"The 1 Star is for the taste of the cake. Here's my experience in detail:

After a change of plans last minute my mother decided to stay in Las Vegas for her birthday. We called early Saturday (4/14) to see if we could have a simple small cake made to be picked up on Sunday. Vanilla cake with strawberry purée. They informed me they were having a company party on Sunday so they were only going to be open from 9-11am. Interesting. But it's your company so okay.. so they wouldn't be able to do the cake order. I then asked if they had anything somewhat close to that in the bakery currently so I knew if I should invest the time in driving there or not. 

I was told ""I dunno. But you can drive down here and check for yourself if you'd like"".... really? That's your response? If it was for myself my search would have ended with them there. But it was for my mother so I decided to drive there to check it out  because she really wanted a cake from them. 

So I made the drive. 

They have a show case with about 12 cakes. Which only one of them in the case was labeled with what it was. I took a number and browsed while I waited. When my number was called an older woman with short grayish brown hair addressed me. I asked if anything in the case was close to strawberry purée with white cake. You would have thought I asked her to solve a quantum physics problem with the amount of attitude she threw at me. It's a very simple question so I was perplexed and extremely thrown off by her response. 

Her irritation was very evident. Her exact response was ""well they are labeled and if nothing says that then no"". Wow y'all are 2/2 for your rude responses. I noted that actually only one of the cakes was labeled. She rushed to the case as if she intended to ""prove me wrong"". But like I stated only one cake was labeled. She then offered a almond cake with raspberry purée as a substitute. Smh. No that's ok. 

I then asked if they were making anymore strawberry short cakes today (it's labeled in the cake by the slice display as a customer favorite and is very popular) and she deep sighs and says ""yes but it will be ready in an hour, so you would have to come back and get it, but when you have your mind made up let us know so we can help you"". She then dismissed me and proceeded to helped someone else.

I could feel my blood pressure rising. And I kept reassuring myself that this was for my mother so I needed to stay calm and respectful. I FaceTimed my aunt and asked her if that would work. She said yeah if that's the closest that have we can order it.

I got another number and waited again.

LUCKILY a different woman helped me and was a lot more courteous. And despite what the previous woman said, the strawberry short cakes were already made and in the back ready. I added happy birthday mom. Paid. And left. Completely irritated and upset.

Just because your cakes taste good. DOES NOT mean your customer service can suffer. Word of mouth is the most powerful advertisement on the planet. If this wasn't for my mother I would have probably had some choice words for the first woman. I had a very simple request and questions. 

I'll pass on future cakes (at least for anyone other than my mother). Shoot Walmart has better service. And that says a lot.",XjvWWa5qA7-mk-fB22g7SQ,7,0,1,qV_j9udqmz-ZP_OTNZ6b7A

I called at 7pm and spoke to a lovely lady named Kendra who was so nice and helpful, and helped me choose a terrific cake for my big day. We chose Vegas In Style, as we thought it was a nice touch to our Vegas nuptials. 

I originally had it set to be delivered to our hotel on our big day between 10am and 12pm, but when I had to change it to 3pm and 5pm the day before our wedding it was hassle free and the employees were so nice. Our ceremony was set for 1pm, and when the ceremony ran longer than expected, I called at 2:30pm to see if they could deliver it at a later time and was informed that it was already in the delivery vehicle (along with 70 other cakes! WOW!) but they would try to deliver it close to 5pm. True to their word, they delivered it once we were done wit our meal and it was beautiful and delicious!

Imagine this: it's 8am friday morning, I call them before our 532 mile drive to vegas to work out a surprise cake for my parents' 50th. A few traffic jams later, we're sweating beads that we won't make it by 8pm closing. Nevermind they say, we'll let you in as late as 8:20 cos someone should be around. A few more traffic jams later and a lot of bullet sweating, we barely made it, but they called us to make sure we found our way, and that they would wait for us no matter what, and when we got there, two of the employees came out to hand us the cake and wish us well!

Needless to say, we got the cake over to my parents later that evening and surprised the heck outta them,  ending the evening with hugs and big slices of cake. My parents dont' like cakes that are too sweet so they were very impressed by this cake, which was light and airy and the sliced strawberries inside were excellent!",ImVfDOri1NG5UE5MEmqHJg,1,0,5,mD1HuNboFYemza1oLMaG-Q

They explained every flavor and didn't make us feel rushed. They explained the details and seemed very confident in their product. The cakes tasted very good. My favorite was the lemon. Their buttercream icing was a little too butter-based (as opposed to lard-based) and was presented cold, so it was almost like straight butter. Ultimately, we went with another cake company, but Freeds came in a close second.

I've been going to Freed's for over a year now. They have vast assortment of cookies, pastries, cakes, cupcakes etc. I think they are probably known for their cookies and cakes, so if you're looking for a cupcake head up a block to The Cupcakery.

The cookies are fabulous. They have all sorts of cookies, and they are truly wonderful - Minus the standard chocolate chip. They are a bit over-baked in my opinion. They are a quite expensive! It's around $18 for a dozen of cookies. 

I haven't had a cake slice or cupcake from them since my first trip, and honestly I can't remember how it was. That to me usually means it not worth trying again. I don't remember them being bad, just forgettable so probably something similar to the bakery at Smith's.

I realize it's an interpretation, but even as a total sugar fiend I won't eat one again. And another item, I got a raspberry crisp thing, which had no discernable raspberry flavor Just a hard, kinda chewy pastry that didn't draw me in texturally or flavor wise.

She acted as though I was inconveniencing her and that she would literally rather be anywhere else than where she was at that moment.

I had heard about this bakery through family members, but have never checked it out until recently. The stickers on the door entail that they've been rated ""Best of Las Vegas"" for many consecutive years. We just happened to be in the same shopping plaza, getting gifts for children's birthday. Nothing Bundt Cakes (which I've enjoyed prior) was closed on Sundays, so we stopped here. I sure am glad we did!!! I had an excellent and incredible customer service experience here! Bob is awesome! He is the biggest reason why I would come back here. We stood in line to inquire about ready-to-serve cakes, because I noticed from the displays and TV screen that they specialize in custom cakes for special occasions. This was a last minute thing unfortunately, and We didn't need anything too fancy, just something that would satisfy a family of 2 birthday girls with slightly different tastes and 5 adults! When we got to the window, Bob confidently took us aside to look at his inventory of cakes that were ready to go. The smallest cake is $31, which is a good deal considering the separate slices go for $6 each. We told him what we wanted on the cake and asked what flavors he would recommend... as one girl really liked chocolate and the other wanted something fruity. We ended up getting a chocolate cake with fudge filling and a layer of strawberries in the middle and on top of the cake! These were actual strawberries, not the canned gunk. We were inquiring about the numeric candles, but Bob showed us a box of mixed singular candles that were free. That was very thoughtful of him. I purchased a Frankenstein shaped cookie for myself that was $2... it was yummy! On their TV screen, it said if you hashtag #freedsbakery and post a photo on either Facebook or instagram, you get free cookies! 4 or 6 cookies -- I can't remember because my boyfriend actually ate them all! Poor me! He told me they tasted fresh and were delicious! We were getting ready to pay when my boyfriend said he wanted gelato. Bob let us sample any flavor we wanted. I mean, he insisted we try everything, so he kept them coming! Lol! These were big samples too :) I enjoyed them all, but we settled on the sea salt and caramel, coffee, and double fudge! He was a really friendly, personable, kind, and knowledgeable guy who was up for pleasant conversations during the transactions, which was great.

Big, private booths, behind glass that I assume are for custom cake ordering. Then of course a beautiful display of cookies, cupcakes, and random slices of heaven. The service, amazing. I love the free cookie while I wait, and the greeting/goodbye as I come and go. 
But as nice as these people are, and as pretty as it may be, these are freakin pastries, and $16 per pound of cookies- that just ain't right. 
If you've been around so long why not show some local love? 
Good product, but the best in Vegas? I don't think so. 
I appreciate the $1 cupcake weekends, and Facebook giveaways aren't going unnoticed. But this is a competitive industry and nowadays tons of coupons/groupons/specials for things of this nature. 
Also, post the yelp check in special at the door, not the register when you can't add 6 more free cookies cuz there's a line out the building.

My sister in law orders a cake for her kids' birthday parties every year. Everyone cannot WAIT to cut the cake, because the cake is sooo good.

I held a Holiday party for the Shade Tree a few years back, and Freed's was more than happy to donate a cake for our party. Of course, it was a hit!

2589269,2017-09-26,4,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"After hearing many great things about the infamous Freed's Bakery, my family and I finally made it a point to stop by after four years of living in the valley. It took us long enough, right?

We walked in and oh my gosh, it smells amazing in here! My eyes went straight to the case filled with cookies. There has to be over 20 different cookies offered, the variety seemed endless! But before I could go any further, I had to take a few steps back and pull a number. They do go by a number system here, so make sure you pull one right when you walk in because they tend to get busy! A clerk finally called our number and even though I really wanted one of everything, we opted for the 1/2 lb. of cookies for $8.23 which yields about 10-20 cookies depending on the weight (obviously). Freed's Bakery also offers a 1lb. box of cookies for $16.45 which yields about 20-40 cookies. The prices are extremely fair, considering that the cookies aren't your usual chocolate chip or Snickerdoodle. We're talking gourmet cookies, people!

I had to include the descriptions of the cookies because why not?

Almond Cake Cookie- A soft almond cake cookie topped with marzipan, dipped in chocolate, and topped with sugared almonds. I'm not a huge fan of marzipan, so I could've gone without this one. It was good, but not the best.

Almond Florentine- A thin almond sugar crisp dipped in chocolate. Very sweet and crunchy, not necessarily a cookie, still delicious!

Chocolate Fudge Thumbprint- A buttery chocolate walnut cookie filled with Freed's homemade fudge icing. The Chocolate Fudge Thumbprint had to be my least favorite of our selection. It wasn't chocolatey like I had imagined, but rather bitter, dry, and a bit bland. If you want something chocolatey, go for the Fudge Cake Cookie.

Crystal Butter Cookie- A delicate cookie with a rich buttery flavor, topped with crystal sugar. This cookie reminds me of the Danish cookies in the blue tin can that appear around Christmastime. You know, the blue tin can that your nana turns into a sewing kit when the cookies are all gone. A classic and easily a favorite amongst the crowd.

Fudge Cake Cookie- A soft chocolate cake cookie topped with Freed's homemade fudge icing and dipped in chocolate. Calling all chocolate lovers! You must get this cookie. It was definitely my favorite, hands down! Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate, where could you possibly go wrong?

Mint Chocolate Wafer- Mint buttercream sandwiched between two chocolate chip wafers drizzled with chocolate. I love anything that is mint and chocolate flavored, so this is a no brainer. The crunchy wafers paired nicely with the mint buttercream.

Nonpareil Butter Cookie- A delicate cookie with a rich buttery flavor, topped with nonpareils. Or in layman's terms, a cookie covered in rainbow sprinkles. What's not to love, people?

Russian Tea Cookie- A buttery vanilla walnut drop cookie hand coated in confectioner's sugar. Oh. My. God. These are melt-in-your-mouth good! Absolutely heavenly!

Sprinkle Butter Cookie- A delicate cookie with a rich buttery flavor, topped with colorful sprinkles. Exactly like the rainbow sprinkle cookie, but coated with sugar crystal sprinkles instead.

It's safe to say that Freed's Bakery satisfied my sweet tooth. Perhaps I'll be placing an online order for a special event in the future. Freed's Bakery is very well known for their cakes and I'm sure they're nothing short of amazing. The cakes on display are beautiful and you can tell that they are crafted with pride. Amazing work! I'll have to come back for a slice soon!

The staff is very friendly and the employee helping us was more than willing to let us use the Yelp check in offer. Thank you, Freed's!",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,5,5,4,dBddAKfxruv-w0UJOhlxRA

2593127,2013-02-03,1,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"I was a huge fan of the old Tropicana location. They did my birthday cakes back in the day when I would come to Vegas to party it up.  I moved to Vegas almost 10 years ago and continued to be a fan.  I love the cake slices, the cookies are not my style but that is just a matter of preference.  They are mostly butter cookies and I am more of a chewy cookie girl.  They have done some great cakes for me, a peanut butter frog cake that was to die for, a huge Sesame Street cake for my sons first birthday.  We used them for pretty much every occasion.  I was lucky enough to win a few of their Facebook contests for gift cards.  That is a cool thing they do so be sure to like them on Facebook.  You might just be the next winner.  

Now they only have the new combined Silverado Ranch location.  The new bakery is big and beautiful, sadly the customer service is lacking.  The last few times I have been in I have had not good experiences.  The worst being when I ordered a Chicago Bulls cake for my husbands birthday.  I wanted a smooth, clean cake with just the logo in fondant.  The woman taking my order suggested printing the logo out on a special paper and putting that on the cake.  She said it would look just how I wanted.  That wasn't what I wanted and I should have been more firm but I went with her suggestion.  The inside of the cake was Brown Derby which is an awesome chocolate cake with whipped cream and fresh strawberries, Hubby's fave.  When I went to pick up they cake they couldn't find the cake.  No biggie things happen.  They she ""found it"" and brought me out a regular brown derby.  I was like um, this isn't my cake and described my cake to her.  She clearly had the order form there and it was written up correctly.  Off she goes, she comes back with the logo on a piece of cardboard, not even cut straight, propped up on the cake, with frosting smeared.  She saw my face and was like you're not happy huh?  I'm like no this isn't my cake.  I was told this was all they could do.  I got a half ass sorry and then they lady just stood their staring at me waiting for me to leave with my ugly cake.  It crossed my mind that maybe I was on some new candid camera type show, I mean there is no way Freed's would actually give me a cake like this?  It was the afternoon of my husbands birthday so I was kinda stuck.  I ended up taking the cake and it quickly became the laughing stock of the night.  It is funny now because the cake was so horrible but at the time I was really upset.  Needless to say I won't be ordering anymore special occasions cake from Freed's.  I feel like they are coasting along on their reputation.  I am happy for their success and growth but wish it didn't come at the cost of everything I love about them.


Update:  I am adding a star because I appreciate the owners response.  Max was kind enough to offer to make me another cake (which I declined).  That was very nice.  I will come in to the shop in the future for some cake slices and see how the customer service has improved since I have last been in.

So why not find the best tasting cake?!?!? I searched on Yelp for a few days in finding that particular cake... I was debating on two bakery places... was going to check out both before choosing but chose this one after walking in and observing everything they had.

I ordered their famous Strawberry Shortcake on the spot. The lady that worked there told me this particular cake is ran out first everyday and is the most popular among guests. I asked if there's any fillings and she told me only strawberries and whipped cream. Simple and sweet.. I like it. I also liked the fact that the written happy bday part is on a thin see-through plastic film, so you can easily take it off and not taste the icky artificial color gel. 

The cake itself was tall for an average cake size. The cake texture was soft and moist... almost like an angel's cake or pound cake feel. The filling was strawberries and whipped cream... even though it was only that.. it was such a delicious, addicting Strawberry Shortcake. The frosting itself tasted like pure milk and could easily be mistaken for vanilla ice cream. Never before did I like any frosting or finish all of it, but this one I was looking for every bit of frosting to devour. Yes it was that extreme....

So extreme... My Father doesnt like sweets, but after the first bite he was hooked. Comment that this cake is really.... Really delicious... so much so... the very next day... he literally woke up in the middle of the night.. opened the fridge to attempt in finishing almost half the cake left. To such disappointment that my Father had to leave the last piece for the bday boy. He still looked in the fridge, in hopes that ... that very last piece was still there.. Nope.. all gone! And the look on my Father's face at that moment said it all.... 

A very well-made delicious cake, but dangerous since all of us had cravings for more, after it was all gone. Worth the drive and the cost for a very memorable Birthday Cake.

We were going to be in town to celebrate a milestone birthday, and I called them in advance to order a cake over the phone.  They were incredibly helpful in designing the cake, and very patient as i had many questions and changes.

They obviously have a great local reputation because when we told the concierge we needed them to store the cake prior to the event, and they found out it was from Freed's, they said could not guarantee it would still be there(chuckles).

The cake design came out even better than I expected, the taste (vanilla with strawberry and cream center) was fantastic, and the cupcakes (red velvet was amazing) were the best we had tried.

When we went to pick up the cake, the staff was incredibly helpful, and boxed the cake securely, no easy feat since there were alot of decorations on the top.

Sadly we also had to try some of their baked which can all be described as awesome, brownies, black out cake, cookies.

The brownie was ok....but not like they used to be either.  It tasted like it came out of a freezer and was freezer burnt tasting.

This place has completely spoiled me and is my measuring stick when I eat cake at other dessert shops (which rarely measure up). This place is a landmark for Las Vegas and an absolute must go even though the location has changed. I've been  coming here since I was a kid and whenever i can, I'll pop in here for a quick slice. The best one for me is the strawberry shortcake. It's simple but it's made so well; the vanilla cake is fluffy, moist and light and the cream is freshly whipped. The strawberries add the nice sweet acidic component wih a bit of crunch. The fruit tart is my second favorite, with fresh fruit on top of a Bavarian cream overlying a buttery crust. All the other cakes are delicious as well and you can't go wrong.

I was, very recently, on this side of town and desperately wanted a Black and White Cookie.  I had a feeling that there wouldn't be anymore in stock, but decided to check anyways, since I was already nearby.

There were three left and I purchased all of them.  I'll be honest, it wasn't as good as they usually are, it tasted like they didn't have as much lemon in the base cookie as normal.  However, my sister purchased two mousse cups while we were there.  WOW!  Their mousse cups are, officially, my favorite thing they sell now.  All of the things in their display cases are so beautifully made, but as I've said before, I'm weary to try their cake as it hasn't been good the few times that I have.

After I made my selections, my favorite part (sarcasm) came up where I would have to pay and engage the normally bitter and sarcastic person behind the register.  Not that case this time.  Both women that helped me were pleasant and engaging.

I walked in this morning to place an order for a specialty birthday cake. Let me start by saying they were EMPTY, not a customer in sight. 
I was told to go and order my cake at the left side of the store where desks were set up and everything looked professional.
Two office ladies were at one desk talking away to each other. I stood politely , waiting for them to finish. (Mind you, not a customer anywhere)
They finally acknowledged me and decided to take my order. I had a photo design to show what I wanted the cake to resemble. It was simple, a quarter sheet cake, normal rectangular size, but included two small fondant shapes on top.
The lady told me it was too complicated and I should choose a photo cake instead. She said they don't have anyone in the bakery that can do any shapes or fondant pieces.
I was just on the website that boasts TONS of artistic , fondant shaped cakes! It's not like I needed the cake that day. I was willing to wait.
I certainly hope these women aren't paid well because they are chasing away customers!!!

I live fairly close to Freed's, and I love to visit that strip mall center.  All my other favorites are there: Grimaldi's, Nielsen's, Cafe Rio.  So I'm already in a pretty good mood whenever I visit Freed's.  It's a nice diverse bakery.  I like that they always have a variety of choices available in the window, from bread pudding to tiramisu, even rugalash.  I especially appreciate variety in desserts, when I'm often confronted with the inability to decide, and a jane-of-all-trades bakery like Freed's gives you this...

But this comes at a price, one of mediocrity.  All of Freed's concoctions are pretty good, not great, frequently too sweet, and almost all too forgettable.  

So if you're in the area, and wanting something sweet, not sure what, and feeling not too picky; then stop by Freed's.  Most likely they'll have something for you, a little sugar one-night-stand, worthwhile enough before you move onto the next dessert relationship.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,2,2,3,6ZQxv7xPrUBw_HCPEEEl8Q

3225876,2013-01-29,0,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"My life was not complete until I walked into Freed's and left with treasure in my hands.

I've heard rave reviews about this place and was quite excited to try it, except that it is clear across town for me. Freed's is really active on Facebook, always having giveaways and contests. They had an event this past weekend that caught my eye - 4 cupcakes for $4 with no limit to how many you buy! I went on Sunday afternoon to find a crowd patiently waiting for their goodies. 

If you find a crowd, take a number! They move fairly quickly so you're not going to be waiting too long. They have a wide selection of cookies and cakes, and across the cookie display is a room where they have cakes for weddings and other lavish events. Their cakes have beautiful designs and colors. While waiting, something that caught my eye was the pre-packaged cookies in the middle table. Gluten-free! 

My number was finally called and I got my 12 pre-ordered cupcakes. Their cupcakes are super moist. Not too big, not too small. They don't overpower their cupcakes with a lot of unnecessary frosting. The decoration isn't anything fancy. My favorites were the Mint Chocolate and the Strawberries and Cream. Mint Chocolate is a chocolate cake with green mint frosting with some chocolate chips on top. The Strawberries and Cream is your straightforward pink strawberry cupcake. I love how these didn't taste artificial or overly sweet.

I checked into Yelp while waiting and got a nice deal for doing so - 6 free cookies with a purchase of $6 or more! I had a hard time choosing from their wide selection and asked the girl to help me choose. There's one cookie that blew my mind. It's a cherry cookie with a cherry in the middle covering in chocolate with pink frosting drizzle. Oh my goodness. My mouth has never been so happy. My taste buds were doing flips. Anyways, all of the cookies were so soft and moist. You won't find a hard or stale cookie here. They're almost like little cake bites. Absolutely delish!

If I could, I'd set up a tent right in front of Freed's and live there. I can live off their cookies and cupcakes. For those of you that agree, you're more than welcome to join me.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,1,0,5,np6x_w0L2a1CJpbZ8kvrrg
3227464,2018-02-09,3,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"My family has been coming to Freed's for years! Almost every year my parents would order my birthday cake from Freed's. Now I have my own kids and I have ordered my daughter's first 3 cakes from Freed's but this time around my experience has been less than satisfactory. My cake order was placed 12 days before I needed it on February 4. When I went in I wanted a Snow White themed cake, I had pictures of the cake I wanted, it was a dark blue fondant cake with yellow crowns and a red ribbon. On top I wanted a red fondant apple. From the very beginning the bad customer service began. The lady taking the order told me they could not make the red apple I wanted because they were much too busy with their tv show and did not have anyone who could do it. Afterwards I was told that my fondant crowns alone would be $65, that was more than the cost of the cake. I decided to opt out of the crowns and just get the cake covered in blue fondant with the red bow and top it with Snow White and the seven dwarfs toys that I had. Cake was paid for when the order was placed $97. 

On the day before I had to pick up the cake I received a call reminding me that I had to drop off the toys, I told the lady I spoke to that I would be in before 6pm to drop them off. I arrived at 5:20 pm and proceeded to the counter where I was greeted and told to step into the office that I would be help there. Before going in, I saw my cake on the display case. It looked very plain without the crowns that I originally wanted. When I went into the office the lady in the center of the room in the back right in front of their cake samples asked me if I needed something. I told her I was there to drop off toys for my cake. She asked me my name and looked up my information, I told her I had seen my cake and that it looked very plain that I would like to add yellow fondant crowns that I didn't care if I had to pay extra since it was a last minute job. Her response to me was ""we have no one here for the rest of the weekend that can do that job but don't worry we will make your cake look nice with your toys."" I wasn't very happy with her reply but I said ok thank you. I told her I would be in to pick up my cake at 9am to which she replied that my pick up time was 9:30am and that I could not pick up earlier. That made me upset because my cake was already ready but once again I said thank you and that was that. The next day I was running late so my parents were going to pick up the cake. It was 10:30am Sunday February 4 when they went to pick up the cake and to make matters worse the toys were not on the cake and the lady that had ""helped"" me the day before never turned in the toys or made any notes about me dropping off the toys. My parents called me and informed me of what was going on, I spoke to the manager and she asked me for the description of the lady who helped me. Once I gave it to her she said she would make sure everything was taken care of but by this time my parents were already late to their grand daughters birthday. My parents called me back and told me that Freed's would add the fondant crowns I wanted no charge but the cake wouldn't be ready for another 25 minutes. Freed's had the cake delivered to the site of our celebration to make up for the lack of customer service. 

At the end of the day the cake turned out beautiful but Freed's customer service has gone down the drain. They really tried to make up for the mistake of their staff member but without criticism nothing will really change. There is no appreciation for loyal customers. The lack of customer service is appalling, and their excuse for lack of services because of their new show is not acceptable. I probably will be back because I am a loyal customer but these problems need to be addressed.",QhsT5jGZzhQJSz73XFJSdg,6,0,2,ZrwuIAP16vGgUMZTY9Q_ww

When you first walk in don't forget to take a number and wait in line to pick out your bakery treats. When it gets really busy inside sometimes you might not see that you need to get a number, but make sure that you do so you get your proper place in line. I don't live on the side of town Freed's is on, so I really love that they have online ordering and that it's as user friendly as it is. When I place my order online they send a confirmation e-mail with the time and pick-up date of my order and when I walk inside, I simply go towards the left at the register where they handle pick-up orders. It's so easy and convenient. If you already know what you want to order this is a great way to bypass having to get a number and waiting in line. The employees have always been courteous and helpful. 

I recently tried some of their newest cupcake creations and the Orange Creamsicle Cupcake was really good! The texture of the cake was good and the flavor lived up to the name. When I saw that Freed's was offering a King Cake (only available for a short time each year) and that they gave the option to have the baby put under/in the cake, I knew I had to order one. Most places will not put a baby in or under the cake anymore for obvious reasons, choking. I personally like the fun and tradition of seeing who gets the slice with the baby in it. I will say that the King Cake (cinnamon) I had this year from Freed's wasn't traditional to the ones I've had from New Orleans, it was more like a coffee cake. I still liked the taste of it and would order it again, but next time I'd try the cream cheese or fruit fillings. I'm sort of surprised that with the beautiful and tasty challah bread that Freed's makes that they couldn't come up with a more traditional texture/flavor recipe. The medium King Cake I ordered was fairly priced at $14.95 and was garnished with decorative beads. 

You can also find a variety of cookies, custom cakes, cupcakes, pastries and if you just want a slice of cake they have that also. 

First Friday Challah - The challah bread ($6.95) here is amazing! It's the only bread I use for french toast and it's only available the first Friday of each month. You cannot order it the same day, so make sure and call ahead or order online to make sure you get some. You can order it braided or as rolls.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,63,62,4,OsavDt0Cep_G8XkdVf8r7g

All the silly sculptural leaning-tower cakes, covered in fondant, from brand-after-brand appealing to out of towners didn't interest me.

The reviews for Freed's buttercream icing, however, did. We ordered a half-sheet cake, and I delightedly told everyone I was ordering from the best bakery in Las Vegas, with killer reviews for buttercream.

On my way to pick up the cake, I had a moment of panic, thinking that it could be terrible, or at least mediocre, and here I built it up and invited EVERYONE.

I had nothing to fear. We had ordered German Chocolate filling in a chocolate cake with buttercream frosting. It was a beautiful cake, and frankly - well, it was the best professional cake I have EVER tasted. The German Chocolate filling was creamy and smooth - no strange, overly sweet jelly texture here! The cake was rich and moist.

THE BUTTERCREAM WAS HEAVEN.

Really. Give me a bowl and a spoon and forgiveness for the fifteen pounds I'll gain eating until I'm sick of it. Whatever you order here, BUY THE BUTTERCREAM.

Incidentally, there were cookies to sample when we picked up the cake, every one of them better than the last. I only wish it was here in Portland, OR!",9HOQinNSSRRm-dule76Xqg,0,0,5,1nDUkuss9uQMs2zqOTT4xg

We told her the number of people attending and she worked within our budget to give us a beautiful wedding cake and supplemental cupcakes. They were able to deliver the cake and cupcakes to our venue at Lawry""s Prime Rib. Even though we chose a simple style it was still very classy and delicious.

I'm glad their fair with offering their 12 free cookies as most of the cookie pieces are small. They are well aware and are more than generous when giving them to you! Their service was great, and imagine my surprise when the lady that helped me was nice enough to inform that I could sample the cookies before I pick them. SAMPLE COOKIES?! WWWWOOOOWWWW!!!! My heart literally ran laps around the bakery, and boy was I sampling cookies for sure! I'd suggest their white chocolate almond and peanut bar, florentines, chocolate cookie covered in chocolate and pecans, and there's more but I forgot the name halfway through eating them. 

I also purchased a raspberry cupcake (which I do apologize is a hard 2 stars in cupcake quality), and a strawberry shortcake (which is a good 3.5 stars in quality). Compared to all the other gourmet cupcakes that are out there, and those being the first of most cupcakes I've tasted from a bakery, it's hard not to compare the too. Freed's cupcakes are REALLY sweet. You taste more sugar in the frosting than a good flavor of anything. So I ended up scraping the cupcake frosting. The quality of the cupcake LOOKED good, but quality is very store bought in flavor. Their shortcake however, is very soft in sponge for cake with the cream being light and not heavy in frosting or too sweet. It had a good amount of strawberries to even out the cake to strawberry ratio. I spent a good $4.95 on the short cake and $2 on the cupcake, but with the free box of cookies it was a steal.

I'd definitely go back for their cookies again when I crave it, but I'd really suggest to steer away from the cupcakes. I must admit, with all these new and hipster bakeries opening, it's still nice to know that there is always a good, classic bakery to go to for some classic sweets.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,0,4,BoFc84z8Jr9ZnWoAcl2pBQ

Vanilla cupcake. First of all it seemed a little small. The frosting was whipped cream I think.  It was bland, not very sweet. The Cupcake wasn't dry but it wasn't moist. It was just a basic kinda boring cupcake. Frosting is everything and I didn't know what this frosting was even supposed to be. There's a bakery in the middle of nowhere Illinois that has 1000% better cupcakes.  I can bake a better cupcake. 

Cookies.  I got 4 little ones. They were okay. I ate them but they were unspecial as well.  Maybe I am used to real Italian made in New York cookies that are similar but much better.  I got a linzer and that too just okay.  I didn't even want to finish it because I know what they should taste like and this wasn't worth the calories.

Cake. I got a slice of ""wedding cake"".  Boring.  Frosting is everything!! The frosting was bland.  The cake was moist filled with strawberries that weren't quite ripe.  Very disappointing.  

I have a gift card that's the only reason I'll go back.  I'll try the carrot cake and maybe something more racy than vanilla stuff but if even the most basic things are nothing more than basic  I don't have much faith they will wow me.  I think people think because there is show this place is great.  It's not. There are way better things other places. This is VEGAS!!  The display case is gorgeous.

Meanwhile all the smaller cakes were in the mid-$3/inch range.

3905041,2014-08-19,3,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"I'm done with playing with this bakery. Back story: I need a cake for 40 people for an event this October, a custom peacock cake that I figured they would easily be able to do based on the fancy sample cakes I viewed on their website. What ensues is a game of email-tag with the reps Nancy and Janie.

On 08/04 I enthusiastically email Nancy, photos attached, of what I envision for this cake. I wait a week and a half through silence before calling the bakery. The woman who answered told me to email another rep directly, giving me her email address (janie@freedsbakery.com). I forward the same email to Janie, whom calls me the next day, 08/14.

Unapologetic about anything, Janie tells me that she hasn't even read my email beyond the part about no one getting back to me. How professional. So I have to explain to her what I wrote. This is the third time I'm getting into it since no one has read the email I've sent TWICE now. I tell her what I want and describe to her what the photos are about as she's looking at them, which wouldn't be necessary had she bothered to read the email before calling me. Again: I need a white peacock themed cake, jewels tones of blues and green accents and two peacocks on the top- one white, one blue- to symbolize a male and female peacock. That's it.

She repeatedly tells me that she doesn't know if they can even make a peacock and suggests that I GO TO ETSY.COM and search around for some bird cake topper or have one custom made. Why on God's green earth do I need Freed's Bakery for if I'm doing all the work myself? If I wanted a custom cake topper from Etsy, I would've ordered one already, placed my order at any other bakery for a fraction of what Freed's wants to charge and put the bird on myself. BTW, she's already quoting over $500 for a cake she doesn't even know if the bakery can make.

After I conversing with an unfriendly Janie some more, I was left feeling stressed and frustrated, so I go online and try to locate the source of the peacock cake photo that I used as my example. The cake gods must've smiled upon me because I managed to find that baker as a guest on someone's cake blog, in which she shows how to create the entire cake with beautiful photos and instructions. I email Janie that link immediately and ask her to show their cake designer. No response from Janie since 08/14.

The next day, 08/15, Nancy emails me to discuss the cake, apologizing that she never got the email that Janie passed onto her. I'm understanding but I'm also politely blunt. This is my email response:

""Hi, Nancy.

I have to be honest- I really dislike dealing with multiple people because it becomes a 'he said/she said' thing with misunderstandings and miscommunications and the constant repeating of 'Well, here's what this person told me...' It gets really frustrating. So I guess I'm going to have to now reiterate what Janie said.

She told me that my serving of 40 was 'in between' sizes and that I would either have to choose a two-tiered for 35 people or a three-tiered for 50. Second, she seemed to suggest that the peacocks I wanted were most likely not an option. She repeatedly kept saying, 'If we can even do them.  I'll have to talk to the decorator.' That made me feel really disheartened and not so confident about the skills of this bakery.

Janie did suggest Etsy to me, which really turned me off. I really did not want to go Etsy hunting for these birds. I was under the impression that your bakery could do something like a bird from fondant, based on what I saw from your sample cakes on the website. I was misled because I saw photos of things like 'A Corpse Bride,' 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and the Harley-Davidson cake that I thought were sculpted from fondant. Were those just plastic items that were bought and put on the cake and not something your bakery created on your own?

Her quote on the cake, without me even deciding whether it was going to be two- or three-tiered, was, 'It's going to cost a lot more than $500.00.' 

I also emailed her after our conversation yesterday and said that I managed to find the person who created that white/silver single peacock cake on the Internet. She was featured as a guest on a cake blog, in which she details in a series of photos how she created the entire cake: [inserted blog link here]  Will this be of help at all to your decorator or am I sadly going to have to find another bakery for my event? I really had my heart set on your establishment to do this.

Kind regards, Kera""

That email was sent on 08/16.  It has been about half a week since then and unsurprisingy SILENCE from Janie, Nancy and Freed's Bakery. What a complete waste of my time. All I wanted to know was whether you could do the cake or not. If not, let me know right away and I'll find someone else. Why is it so difficult to get that simple response from this shop?

Guessing they have learned a few things along the way such as making some of the softest and fluffiest cheese cake around. The customer service that they offer is amazing and even personalized. 

The bakery associate that took my order offered me many samples of some of the products they had in the case. They were all amazing! I ended up using my yelp check in here which is 4 free cookies if you spend over $6. Thanks to Freed's for the free cookies; they were amazing! Spending over $6 is not hard here, the total was closer to $25.

I took home a slice of cheesecake with strawberries. There cheesecake as I mentioned earlier is amazing it is so soft with no after taste. The strawberries were fresh and delicious. The strawberry cake slice that I ordered was great too! It had so many strawberries inside the cake and the frosting was soft and whipped. The cream puffs tasted so good that I did not want to eat them. They went well with morning coffee!

I had NO idea they had pastries and small, individual sized treats along with their fancy cakes. Well, we came in the following weekend. It was chaos inside the door. Don't forget to grab a number as soon as you walk in. We saw so many people just standing around, and almost walked right past the large number machine. 

We were helped quickly, and chose a Chocolate Kahlua Banana Cake slice. That was easy enough. Then it got confusing. Apparently, one person helps you with your selection and boxes it for you. Then you move over to another line to the side of the display case and another person rings you up. That's not bad, but people were coming in at three different angles trying to pay for their items. One man had picked up something on a display case and wanted to pay for that. So it got a bit chaotic trying to pay. 

I actually stepped out of the way to let my husband pay. There were just too many people crammed into that area, and there was no real definitive line. 

The cake was pretty good. Nice flavor in the cake and the Kahlua cream. There was maybe one or two pieces of banana. Could have done with more. The frosting did not really have any flavor at all.

My first experience was better than my most recent experience with Freed's.  I first tried their cupcakes at my friend's 30th birthday in Las Vegas, where they had the cupcake tier with a mini cake on top.  I had the all chocolate cupcake with chocolate mousse, dipped in chocolate.  SO GOOD!  

This time around, I went to the store since its down the street from my parents' house and wanted to get a dozen cupcakes for my grandma's 92nd birthday.  I had browsed the website and saw what types of flavors they had, and called the bakery to request some be put on hold until I drove in from LA.  The lady who had answered the phone told me that I did not need to call in and reserve any cupcakes because they would have them there all day and since I was ordering a variety, there should definitely be some in stock.  BAD NEWS, I had my heart set on the all chocolate cupcake, the peanut butter and chocolate, and the mint and chocolate, and NONE were available.   Maybe it was the day of the week, but there were no chocolate cake cupcakes available other than the cookies and cream cupcake.  Ended up settling with a few red velvet, peach, strawberry, cookies and cream and carrot cupcakes.  Read from the past yelp reviews about the cookie offer, so I snagged a couple of those to help ease the disappointment.  At least the cookies were good and a couple of the ones we had chosen were dipped in chocolate.  And to add insult to injury, my mom tried the cookies and cream cupcake, and said the chocolate cake part was dry.

As you enter the establishment everything on display looks grocery store generic. I can see that they probably haven't evolved their recipes much after 30 years and stuck to the good old standards. 

At first taste, I compared my cake to a Costco equivalent. As I let the cake thaw a bit, because it was obviously too refrigerated, the nuances of the better recipes started to show themselves. The cake was just moist enough, the Bavarian cream and buttercream frosting were just sweet enough, and in terms of overall flavor it was a definite step up from Costco. 

If price was an issue, I'd stick to good 'ol Costco cakes but if you want a prettier presentation with more filling options, I'd purchase from here.",9v83UksZrkThOiE584GRBQ,3,2,3,UG-gNNJYPLznC6CWXw446w

Napoleon is nothing comparable with real French Napoleon, its too sweet and heavy, too much cream. 
elephant ears are heavily soaked in sugar when they supposed to be lightweight and crunchy, all you taste is sugar, 
cannoli - there is no feel of cheese in the filling. It seems like they took a lot of sugar powder and added just a little bit of cheese just to glue the sugar together. I had to throw it away, it was uneatable.

Cookies: there should be a yelp check in that gets you 6 free if you spend 5 dollars.  They have a wide variety, but my favorite are their chocolate caramel sea salt cake cookie, and the this other that a raspberry jam and chocolate sandwiched between two buttery cookies. 

Streudal: they have a whole section of sweet breakfast Streudal.  They are flaky yet moist,  and full of flavor. 

Cupcakes: the cake itself is on point, but the  cream cheese and mouse based frostings are way to thick, almost a gummy consistency.   Stick with the buttercream frosting. 

Cakes: my favorite are the Parisian,  German chocolate, black forest, and this amazing banana one that only appears on the weekend apparently. 

Pastries: this is their downfall, specifically the eclairs are way to heavy and dense, and their canolies are not filled to order which makes the shell no longer crisp,  and the filling is to heavy. Basically there is an over all heavy handed feeling about the pastries in general. 

Ice cream: one of their newer offerings,  which when we had it seemed the temp control must be off.  Tasted like it had melted at some point and refroze.

Client recovery: I once had gotten a German chocolate cake slice I had many times before, got home and it was so dry.  I called to inform them,  and they made sure next time I came in I got a free slice of cake.  My new slice was heaven. 

Overall there are some top notch offerings that pop the rating up despite some areas that could use improvement.   This place is a staple of the las Vegas valley,  and I'm so glad it's close to my home.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,1,0,4,Ps3Cr-tJ_5Vjp7p-uMEPQA

So my Freed's Bakery experience started a few years back at a friend's birthday party and it was a beautiful Louis Vuitton purse cake. The chocolate cake with chocolate mousse was delicious and luxurious both to the eyes and the taste buds.

Then last month I went to Freed's Bakery for a $1 cupcake promotion (red velvet, chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate), which I saw on Facebook and took the 30 minutes drive with fond memories of that moist & fresh chocolate-y cake I had. I ordered 8 cupcakes (2 of each flavor) and shared it with my family... 

RED VELVET - Um... YES. YUM! Their cream cheese frosting is amazing.
CHOCOLATE - WTF YES I REMEMBER YOU! I missed you.
VANILLA - Delightful and light! 
MINT CHOCOLATE - My family devoured it before I could. But they looked happy. So I'm happy they're happy LOL. (I need to go back for more)

Two weeks after that, I bought 24 cupcakes. Couldn't get enough, guys. And the six FREE cookies that you get by posting to Facebook or Instagram?

I went here today with my mother for two reasons:

1. I wanted a delicious treat
2. I am getting married and was interested in looking into their wedding cakes

First off the shop IS nice. It is clean, everything smelt so yummy when we walked in. The place where (I assume) they do consultations for wedding/event cakes, etc was behind a glass panel. My mother and I walked in and all the women were busy so we started taking a look at their books with pictures of cakes.

Eventually someone came up to us and asked us if we had been helped. I said no and proceeded to ask this person about whether or not they make traditional French wedding cakes. These wedding cakes are called croquembouches. Considering Freed's makes many other things besides cakes I assumed they would at least KNOW what a croquembouche WAS. Well, this lady had no idea what I was talking about. I don't mean to be a snot, and I'm certainly not a snob, but seriously... how can you work in a wedding cake consultation place at a bakery that makes many confectioneries and at least not know what a croquembouche is?

After my mother and I left the dazed and confused wedding cake woman we went back into the bakery and proceeded to wait a heinously long amount of time to get our 1 piece of red velvet cake and our 1 cannoli. They were good... but not THAT good.

Obviously I'm taking my Frenchy wedding cake dreams elsewhere to the many other bakeries/cake makers in Las Vegas who know what a croquembouche is.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,2,Nb4IWwNH9GKry0j589tnQA

First time today, the service was so bad.  The lady with the butterfly tattoo on her right forearm needs to be trained on people skill/customer service.

I came into Freed's on a mission for cupcakes, but I walked out with a whole heck of a lot more.  I was lured in by their generous Yelp check in offer for free cookies with minimum purchase, so clearly, I had to buy enough to get the free cookies, right?!  Right. 

I settled on the lemon berry cake slice, chocolate cherry cupcake, and my freebies: lemon cake cookies and cherry chocolate cookies.  I had the cookie bag open before the car was even started to drive away - heavenly!  The cherry chocolate cookies were a cake-like version of a cordial cherry.  The lemon cake cookies were mini lemon bar goodness.

I remember the cake looked like THE BOMB! This was a few years ago so when I started on Yelp I ran into Freeds again! I even liked them on facebook, so I've been drooling over pics for a while now. I usually never venture to the east side of the strip. So us girls made a special trip all the way to hendertucky to try it out. 

It was very easy to find! As soon as we pulled up I saw the banner for chocolate dipped ice cream sandwiches, note to self buy one! We enter and grab a number. Mistake one,  we only grabbed one number for 3 of us...OOPS. Anywho we browse before they call our number and I KNEW I wanted the strawberry shortcake I had served a few years ago! I also decided on some cookies to add to the 6 cookies I got for checking in! After I was done the lady started to call another number even after we told her all 3 of us were together! Then seemed perplexed when I said that my mom and sister hadn't ordered! 

We all ordered and payed. I got a slice of strawberry shortcake cake, cookies, and an ice cream sandwich. I didn't really like any of it! I was especially depressed that the cake had little to no flavor!!! The ice cream cookie sandwich was ok but the '""ice cream"" seemed like frozen buttercream. I don't like buttercream! And I got the cookies for my daughter mostly and the 2 I tried were not tasty. I don't know if it's that I ordered wrong or that I set myself up for failure since I was uber excited but I probably won't return to freeds :/ 

oh and one other thing! There was a brunette lady standing behind the counter near the entrance to the kitchen who made eye contact with me but said nothing. Something about her vibe was very unwelcoming. I HOPE she is just a baker or maybe a family member because she made eye contact with me again before we left and said nothing AGAIN. I can see Freeds is VERY busy so people like the product, I don't think that gives you the right to not greet guests!

But I went by to pick up a gift for a coworker. A half pound box of cookies is only about $8. Then you add the Yelp check in of four free cookies AND the samples sitting out and you have a very full box of almost twenty cookies. I simply asked the girl behind the counter to fill it up with an assortment of their most popular. 

While there, I mentioned that I wasn't a huge Cake fan, but I wouldn't mind getting some treats for myself and could she make a recommendation. I had seen a couple non-cake items I thought I might like. But she absolutely insisted that the strawberry shortcake and the Paradise Cake were amazing and different from anywhere else. So I decided to go out on a limb a trust her. Unfortunately, neither did it for me. The icings weren't quite rich and sweet enough for my tastes. 

I probably won't be rushing back here, but I would be willing to give it another chance. But next time I would make my own selection.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,9,5,3,WQZiDT7hUzIiZyibtjT5Eg

The design of the cake was good and the customer service was really good, if not for those 2 things I probably would have only given 2 stars. I had called in for a cake for a surprise going away party.  The original cake I was interested in was quoted at about $1,500 which is insane IMO. I asked if they had anything in the $75 price range and the person on the phone gladly walked me through their website showing me more affordable options.  We also had to reschedule the party last minute due to a family emergency with the guest of honor and they were very accommodating.  

As for the flavor of the cake,  I wouldn't go out of my way to order another cake from them. I thought it was overpriced. The cream cheese frosting was tasty but the cake itself was lacking in flavor.  It was a nice texture though which is also important. 

Overall the cake was just ok which is what las me to a 3 star rating.  If I were basing this on customer service alone I would have given 5 stars but for such a high priced cake I expected better quality.",94YwuBX_cJyH6tzzgEDmyg,10,3,3,-erlIr2h7SurQXpRdr2-Ew

I was really excited when Freeds opened up near my house as I have heard nothing but good things about it. I walked in today looking for something special for dessert and I have to say that I wasn't really that impressed. I ended up picking up two pieces of cake. One was Black Forrest (my favorite) and the other was Red Velvet (my GF's favorite) and I have to say that I have had better. The Black Forrest tasted too much of the Fake Cherry they used and the Red Velvet was really dry and kind of blah. 

I will say they make better cakes then Albertsons, Vons or Smiths... but I am sure that if I keep looking there is someone else out there who makes better cakes then what I sampled at Freeds. 

As for the customer service, they seemed fine to me. Everyone seemed to be fascinated with the photographing of a couple of wedding cakes that to me looked a little plain, but its not my wedding so who cares. 

I would give it a try, maybe you like it better then me but growing up in a little Danish town with tons of great Danish bakeries to choose from I totally expected more from Freeds.",eXVdbhzZGvIVbqVJzP2bxQ,1,0,2,NSc2tKColkJpoRiKiGT2-w

We went there and to our surprise, it was CLOSED..They aren't opened on Sunday which I found shocking because the ones in San Diego are...Oh Well..I did quickly suggest Freed's which was in the same strip mall area so we drove over there.

I have had Freed's bookmarked for a long time. I actually stepped foot in there once before but it was busy and I think (it's been a while) they didn't have quite what I was looking for so I left. I finally went back yesterday. 

They has some pretty tempting items. They have a large assortment of cake slices, cupcakes, fruit tarts and more.  I opted for a fruit tart because I had never eaten one and always wanted to try it...my daughter opted for their lemon raspberry cake.

The fruit tart was soooo delicious! I love the crystalized sugar that was drizzle around the inner edges of the crust. The fruit on top was fresh and delicious! The cream filling was heavenly! Mmmmm! Now..for the crust...it was like a dense shortbread and had good flavor..I wish it was a bit more buttery though.  Overall it was tasty BUT it was so dense that it was difficult to cut through it with a fork so it could be eaten with the rest of the dessert. In all fairness, I did eat the dessert with a plastic fork but I'm certain that I would have had the same difficulty with a regular fork. If the crust was a bit lighter and more flexible, this could have possibly made my top 10 list of desserts which is saying something because I am a dessert connoisseur! I love my sweets! I tried a bit of my daughter's cake and it was delicious! The cake had a European butter cream on top and was sprinkled with coconut. It was the bomb! There was also raspberry filling on top of the cake and inbetween the cake layers. It was delicious. The quality of the cake was very good. I can clearly see why they needed a separate office for special orders and I can also see why they're opened on Sunday unlike many other bakeries.

The quality & service here are both good...but I must confess that I tried a cookie sample on the way out and I wasn't impressed. It's funny because bakeries that have great cakes don't have great cookies for some reason. C'est la vie...the tart did still my heart though.",FQHdS67O9x0pXZBtAk39tQ,1,0,4,jfuG12MWlZNw6VNqzg_uVg

I went with Chocolate w/ Strawberry, Red Velvet, Chocolate w/ Chocolate Mousse, and a Napoleon. It seemed like the consensus favorite was the Red Velvet. Personally, I liked them all. I am usually unimpressed by cake, so it says something if you can get me to enjoy your creation.

I never did visit Freed's at their previous two locations, but their new consolidated store is pretty nice. It has an open feel and allows them to showcase their cakes well. Contrary to other reviews, the service I received was very friendly and attentive.

In some cases they offer true eye candy and the visual appeal will stir any cupcake and pastry fan into thinking they're in for a treat. But spectacle does not always equal substance. A couple of bites into a Freeds experience left me thinking some items were almost too sweet. And the cupcakes were DRY. Now I've made cupcakes and it's not a cakewalk to make them perfect every time. But a professional bakery I hold to a slightly higher standard than what I can crank out, and a dry cupcake is a sin in my book, one that will cost them 2 stars. A-ok? Yes, they'll do in a pinch. But I won't go out of my way to buy from them, especially not with the Cupcakery so close by.

Edit: Freed's took the time to respond back and I greatly appreciate that. And to be fair sometimes food can vary from day to day.

Not too sweet and very fluffy. They have an assortment of cookies which are good, but I think the cake is where their strong point is. Be sure to order at least a week in advance for cakes as they can get really busy. Price is moderate depending on what you get. You can talk to a cake designer if you really need a specialty cake done like for weddings, themed birthdays, etc. Cakes by the slice is available too if you just want to treat yourself or you can just get the whole cake and eat it too.lol.

4701494,2013-08-23,3,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"I am not a stranger of Freed's Bakery cakes - I was surprised with a gorgeous half-sheet white cake, Bavarian cream filing, buttercream frosting, with fresh orchids and glitter for decoration on my 24th birthday - however, I have yet to be a customer until this past May. At work, almost everyone's birthday was celebrated with a 7"" round cake, we would receive other types of cakes for holidays, and it was always so delicious. One cake that stood out to me was their Strawberry Shortcake. The white cake was always so fluffy, the strawberries and whipped cream filling/frosting so light and fresh; just an all-around crowd pleaser.

So, I thought that I would surprise my dad with that very cake for his birthday. My parents had yet to try a Freed's cake and after tasting the Strawberry Shortcake, they were HOOKED! My mom, who is picky as hell, had only one favorite cake, the Guava Cake by Saint Germain/Dee-Lite Bakery in Hawaii, for the last many years. Yeah, Guava who? She said that Freed's Strawberry Shortcake is now her favorite cake ever! Oh boy. So, I ordered one for her birthday this month. Of course, she was thrilled and didn't really want to share it lol! 

My experience with ordering over the phone has been really great. Extremely helpful staff, even when I had multiple questions about their speciality cakes and different options. Pick up has been easy and they even send you e-mail invoices! I LOVE their Yelp check-in offer of six FREE cookies! My last trip, I bought a small box (cookies are sold by weight) and most of my selections were really delicious. I don't like that almost all of them are dipped in chocolate, but I know that's probably just me. I think the prices are fair too. The 7"" round is approximately $28 and a quarter-sheet is approximately $44. There is a 10"" round that feeds as many people as the quarter-sheet, but I'm not sure on the price.

Only complaint is that they have several decorators and apparently, you can't request the type of writing for personalized messages since each decorator has their own handwriting style and you don't know who will be decorating your cake. I don't want my beautiful cake ruined by messy handwriting. Most bakeries that I'm used to have a standard of how messages are (beautifully) written and I think that's great for quality-control and customer satisfaction. If someone isn't artistic in that way, they shouldn't be doing it. You don't see a Starbucks location with ugly boards, they always seem to have someone extremely talented writing/drawing that stuff!

Edit (09/01/13): I ordered a 1/4-sheet chocolate cake with fresh strawberries and Bavarian cream filling, covered in chocolate buttercream for my fiancé's surprise birthday party a month in advance. As I indicated before, I was specific on the writing, even sending a photo of one of their cakes with the writing I admired. I am very happy to say that the result was exactly what I wanted! I didn't know what the ""masculine scroll"" would be, but said ""yes"" when asked if that's what I wanted on the cake and I really like it! The only thing that surprised me was the color of the writing and decoration - I didn't even think to specify on those colors nor was I asked during my consultation. Had either of those things happened, I would have requested his favorite color. Nevertheless, three shades of blue were chosen and it was nice. In the end, the cake was amazingly delicious and everyone was raving about it at the party! Also, I was able to get 18 nice-sized pieces of cake from the 1/4-sheet.

I learned a few lessons through my experiences, allowing me to share tips with the rest of you. Firstly, I think I'd prefer to have my next cake consultation in person. It was a lot more complicated over the phone to explain what I wanted and to see the options available even with the website and their Facebook page at my disposal. Secondly, specify every detail! I'm peeved that I wasn't asked for all choices of the cake details, but I'm taking blame for not thinking thoroughly. I will never forget decoration colors again! Thirdly, do not go there when you're in a hurry. For some odd reason, organization is almost non-existent during pick-up and every time I've been there, either someone doesn't know how to use the register or isn't paying attention. There weren't any customers waiting when I went in and almost immediately, one of the staff members became available (after assisting another customer) and it took 10 minutes just to find the cake and for me to pay.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,4,4,i60Wza3Je9lUa5KkEO2ziw

The ordering process was very easy & I did it all through email.

I ordered a 1/4 sheet meant to serve 20-25 people including a custom image for $59.95. I designed my own image & went off the size of what a 1/4 sheet was for the height & width, but they just require it to be at least 500 pixels or more.

They have many flavors & fillings to choose from. My sister wanted a red velvet cake flavor & bavarian cream filling. It was so yummy!

The cake turned out EXACTLY how I wanted it. Everyone loved it & it was enough for a party of 45 people!

Sampled the wedding cake which is moist white cake with buttercream and sliced strawberries, and it was fluffy deliciousness. Must order.

Macaroons were $1.20 each, most cake slices $5-6 each, and you can buy cookies in bulk for $16/lb. 
Prices are within reason for most bakeries.

I got a fruit tart ($5-something) and half a pound of mixed cookies for $8.  You can pick and choose from multiple varieties from lemon cookies, wafers, Florentines, etc!! Everything is delicious.

The fruit tart was very big and covered in fruit. The filling was buttercream which was very delicious but I usually prefer my fruit tarts with custard. However if you like buttercream then you will love this. 

I got the mini chocolate chips, fudge thumbprints, and M&M cookies. Delicious all of it. The fudge thumbprint had a light lemony flavor which was very refreshing.

We arrived in Las Vegas, and after checking in, we headed to Freed's.  Here is where the bad things started happening.

We decided to get cupcakes that were chocolate, and frosted with a half butter-cream/half something awesome, and stuffed with a mousse type filling.  We also got a small cake built with the same materials just for the happy couple, as we like good cake.

From my last review, I mentioned the stuff was good and the service was blah hence the 3 star.  Now, things are getting much better....

1.  Cakes - The prices are very reasonable, and the quality outstanding. Choices are great. For this, they get 5 Stars!!!

- Type of cake: we always go for the chocolate or marble. However, they do have white, almond, lemon and carrot cake that I can choose from.

- The fillings - How does Bavarian Cream sound? A pudding in a cake?  How does Buttercream sound.  Chocolate Buttercream?  they have a ton of other flavors in fillings, and our next cake we just ordered will have Chocolate fudge.  

- The frosting - We generally have the Buttercream frosting, or a fondant for the specialty designs, where we need a special look. Can't go wrong herre.

Confused, you can always take samples for tasting to be sure.

2.  Service - This was to me an issue in the past which dropped them to a three star in my last review, however, consistently in the past few months that I have been coming in, I have to say - 5 Stars!!!

- Front Bakery Reception - They still have the numbering system, and I recommend you pull a number ticket as this is always best, no matter what.   I went in here at 7:55 pm on a Saturday night, right before their closing and needed a last minute birthday cake ordered.  Kelly was so helpful, helped me sort out what I needed, and the wording and all, and I never felt like they were waiting to close. I felt very relieved to be able to do this last minute and know that this special cake was going to be taken care of... Thanks Kelly - 5 Stars!

- Special order - Came in just yesterday to order another special cake so I went to the special order section which is in a glass office area.  Elia helped my wife and I to order the best graduation cake. Not only did she show us the normal designs, she also went into a lot of detail, suggested alternatives to our original requests which were based on what we ""knew"" and hadn't tried yet. In the end, we ended up with a cake that she confirmed with the bakers first would work and we felt complete special attention, and we are going to have a cake that is going to be special for sure.  Thanks Elia - 5 Stars!

3.  So, when you need a special cake for those special moments, yeah, you can order Costco, Sams Club, Albertsons, Smiths, other bakeries.  However, when you want that special cake for those special moments that you want to show others is truly special, then come here to Freeds. You will be amazed for sure.

I called a little less then a week in advance to place my cake order. The lady taking my request was super friendly and helpful. She even recommended I get a smaller cake when she heard it was mainly just for myself and my kids . Since I was getting a Disney Frozen themed cake I wanted the larger size for photos but the fact that they aren't trying to upsell made me happy.

I can't even tel you how BEAUTIFUL my cake turned out. Just check out the photos. I couldn't of asked for anything better. It has so much detail and beauty and the price point was VERY affordable for what I got. I have ordered cakes from all the Big Box grocers and spent anywhere from 25-40.

Awesome deal, and the lady on the phone was SO helpful. She really made it easy. I had to pick them up Thursday as I won't be able to drive for a few days, and she got the order placed and ready for me to pick up in under 24 hours!
 These Strawberries are gorgeous! As she suggested I got half Milk Chocolate and half White Chocolate. They had sprinkles on the white ones and stripes on the milk chocolate. They were visually stunning, and the size of my fist.
 However, when I went it to pick them up the counter person wasn't friendly, and didn't answer a couple questions. I saw they had Macarones, my obsession, and wanted to know how much they were. She ignored it, and I asked again, she looked at another employee and started talking to them.  :(
 I picked up treats for my kids and I while I was there. I swear the Canollis I saw in the case were triple the size of the one I got out when I got home. It's wasn't spectacular, just ok. My daughter LOVED her Tiramisu, and my son said the Black and White cookie was wonderful.
 Did you know Freeds sells pieces of wedding cake? Any day you can walk in and get wedding cake! Why is this not trumpeted from the rooftops? I know we'll be going back for some.
 The two lovely ladies that got strawberries said they were delectable, and the presentation was mentioned by both as well.

It used to be a pleasure to walk in, smell the great baked treats and spend time picking out cakes & sweets. The atmosphere was always friendly and warm like you were in grandmas kitchen.
Now Freed's Bakery has become a Walmart sweat shop for sweets at best! Their bad service and stale desserts are disgusting to say the least. 
Most locals noticed a few years ago and complained but Freed's Bakery refused to do anything about it.
In the past, each year I ordered custom made birthday cakes ,at least 60 large ginger bread houses, gifts and treats for all my client until the taste and quality went down. I thought with time the 3rd generation owners would notice and try to improve, take care of the loyal locals that kept them in business all these years but that's not the case! 
One last try....Today I stopped by with a friend from LA for a treat after a late lunch, I was embarrassed to say the least. We walked in, not to many people in line, the staff was busy chatting amongst themselves as I waited for them to take my order, the cold unfriendly servers asked me what I wanted as if I were bothering her. I ordered a red velvet cupcake and bought cinnamon walnut small treats. We left, tried the treats at my home. The red velvet cupcake cream tasted like it was mixed with almond, gross, the cinnamon walnut treats must be at least 2 weeks old! Disgusting, can't believe you sell this kind of garbage ! I wish I had tried them there because your business is unacceptable. Disappointed and disgusted to ever come back. I did not post the last 3 years of disappointment hoping the business would change their quality and service! 
There are plenty of great bakeries in summerlin and the southwest to ever return to Freed's.

5048584,2012-09-19,0,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"Hyped up which I think can set some people to be disappointed, but I thought it was good. 

I wanted cake. I had such a crappy cake slice the day prior and I remember having a really good cake slice from Freed's years ago. It definitely hit the spot. 

I grabbed a red velvet cake which was tasty. I have a problem with a lot not having balance but this achieved that. Not too sweet, the cream cheese frosting had a really nice rich consistency but not too thick and still taste like cream cheese, the cake was moist and had great flavor. 

The black forest was the better of the two though. I'm not a chocolate cake fan, but I really enjoy theirs since it's not a sugary mess but cacao flavor. It was so moist, the cherry filling was nice and the frosting was just the right amount of sweet. 

While I think their custom cakes are pricey, I can understand why it is in demand as they really understand how to make cake. I think a lot of places are too heavy handed on sugar and I cannot eat a whole slice of it or put too much frosting that I'm scraping off to get the right balance in a bite. I did not feel gross and in a saccharine coma after their treats. The BF was holding back from eating more in one sitting when we were just planning on a tiny nosh and saving the rest for later. 

There was a Yelp check-in deal with $6 you get 12 cookies. This to me is CRAZY of a check in deal as their cookies are normally by the pound and you can pick any. There wasn't a bad one in our picks, but the standout for me was the cookie with marzipan covered in chocolate and nuts, and the 7 layer squares. We went to a friends house close by and while I wanted to try more than that, I went back to the bag and everything was gone.

I hate chocolate so my favorite cake is the white cake with buttercream frosting and fresh strawberries inside. They don't skimp on the strawberries either. The sheet came which is the longer square cake is only a few bucks more and feeds a crowd. The smaller round cake still feeds enough but the bigger cake for a crowd is the way to go.

You can order your cake ahead and have it completely customized for birthdays , weddings or any special event , or if you're in a hurry just go pick a freshly baked caked from the store. They will be happy to personalize it for you.

I had it at Wedgewood banquet center. They partner with freeds so I was excited about it. Wedgewood has their own problems they need to work out because my wedding was good but not great. Anyways. I met with freeds and gave them a printout of the cake I wanted mine based off of. We changed some minor things around but I was looking forward to seeing my cake. I didn't see it until it was time to cut the cake. My husband and I just looked at eachother. It looked like it belonged to someone else. There was nothing on that cake that I liked. From the color of the fondant  (which was supposed to be a rose pink basically ) was some lavender color. And the flowers I asked to be painted on the cake were purple. And not even the correct type of flowers. I didn't like them at all. They were purple as well. I never asked for that. Didn't even mention it. I asked for a gold ribbon around the bottom of each tier to replace all the fondant gold work. I wanted the whole cake to be edible. We cut it and it was some fabric ribbon. I feel like I could have made that cake. Or went somewhere else and gotten it cheaper and correct. I will say that I liked the taste of the cake and the tiers were correct. Also with it being a wedding my husband and I barely had time to even taste the cake let alone have a slice. When the end came I have no idea what happened to the rest of the cake that we paid so well for. There was plenty left. But I guess it is what it is. I don't really plan on ever ordering my cakes through freeds again. And with me going to school for pastry arts I don't see how my cake could have been completely wrong with a visual aid there. I even gave them a swatch from the color scheme of my wedding. My husband who's the typical man when it comes to things like this, was even disappointed.

I had to wait in the line for 10 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge me, then when I finally interrupted someone because they keep working on other things the cashier just said, oh I thought that someone had already helped you?  Er, should I be waiting 10 minutes when no one is around?  If you have a separate line for cakes then please be a little more attentive to new customers and if they are waiting?  There were three staff members just walking around, I mean it was quite a slow time and had I only had this experience and not tasted the cake then I probably would have been more upset.

They have lots of different cookies, pastries and cakes. Almond horns, chocolate chip cookies, rainbow cookies, raspberry walnut wafers, butter cookies, chocolate fudge thumbprints, chocolate chip log, linzer tarts, turnovers, cinnamon crisps, cupcakes, etc.

Their cookies are pretty good but not the rainbow cookies. I've had better at Bagel Cafe. The rainbow cookies here are flavorless and the chocolate is overpowering - they're not the traditional Italian flag colors either.

The cakes and cupcakes are delicious and aren't dry. So, definitely come here for cakes and not the rainbow cookies. Another good thing about Freed's is their involvement with the community.

I went to their cake consultation office to the left when you walk in and I was immediately greeted and helped. We talked about my ideas, and I showed them some inspiration photos. They did a great job following through on my ""vision"" for the cakes. They tasted delicious and looked BEAUTIFUL. 

My (huge) complaint is regarding the day of pick up. When I got there, I waited in line on the pre-paid/pick up line for at least 10 minutes before someone was even able to help me. When they finally did acknowledge me, they took FOREVER to find both cakes. I saw them in the back running around like chickens without heads looking for my cake and I actually started to get worried. Both women came to the counter a couple of times and never updated me. I was left thinking... ""are they still even looking for my cake? Is it lost? What's going on here?"" That's a scary feeling to have on the day of the event. 

When they finally came out for the last time and walked right by me, I said... ""is everything OK? Did you find my cake?"" The girl replied, ""Yes, we found it"" as she walked in the other direction! I asked if I could see it and she said, ""Oh, do you want to?"" When another woman FINALLY brought it over she said, ""We have over 200 cakes today so it's been really busy."" I replied that I was just glad they found my cake, but wasn't there a better way of organizing them? She responded simply, ""we have 8 fridges."" I suggested some sort of coding system where they could look at the receipt and know automatically which fridge to look in. She said, ""When it's this busy of a Saturday, it's not that easy."" I wish they would have been more communicative throughout the process of looking for my cake, and provided an apology for the long wait when it was finally found. I left my mother in law and the baby in the running car to pick up the cakes, which wound up being a 20 minute ordeal. 

With another baby on the way, and plenty of birthdays to come in the future, I will definitely try them again for cakes since these were so good, but I just hope they find a better system for storing and retrieving the orders.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,4,3,4,CRCd66e9rNK9b0ex-GxSlA

Service: Was okay, they were very helpful and sweet.

Cake:  The decoration of my cake was spectacular and what I wanted. It was a three tier cake and the taste of the cake was mediocre, it is not something where I would crave for ever again.

He asked which restaurant and said he would be able to bring it there and leave it with the kitchen staff.  I was so relieved.  I didn't want to walk around with this cake.  I should have had it delivered there in the first place, but I had no idea it would be so large.

The cake was perfect.  Everyone enjoyed it, including the Robert De Niro impersonator at Oscar's Steakhouse.  There were 6 of us in the party, and we only ate half of the cake.  We gave the other half to the kitchen staff.  

Thank you so much, Freed's Bakery for going above and beyond to make our celebration go without a hitch.",XfdqbVcj_vwjJJJrKMGwNg,0,0,5,d-ol-JuHJQm2DjEKroTtVQ

My excitement faded a little after ordering my first cake. I paid around $100 for it and even though it was beautiful it was just not exactly tasting how I expected. It tasted a little cheap (like a little too much margarine instead of butter) and compared to the cookies the cake did not impress me. We tried another few times their regular cakes (basically, same size than the one ordered but about 2.5 times cheaper) - again they were good, for the price it was definitely a better value, but not delicious or to die for.

The cupcakes were on sale so it was my lucky day as I ordered 8 different types to which my overall total was about $35 dollars with the delivery.

I didn't think because usually there is a gift wrap option or something like that but I didn't think when I hit the 'pay now'.

Even though I ordered late at night, I still get to choose a morning delivery for no additional charge and they delivered in the morning between 9-12pm time I opt for.  The packaging wasn't cute or fancy to my disappointment but it's okay, the thought the counts right?

I ended up making a quick visit with my mom a few weeks after my sister went just to make sure everything was in order. Elia was everything my sister had said. I trusted all of her recommendations. 

I had a custom cake based off of what I found on Pinterest. Gotta love Pinterest! We went with a three tiered round cake, with the top tier as chocolate with chocolate Bavarian, the middle tier red velvet with cream cheese filling and the bottom tier a traditional white cake with Bavarian filling and strawberry purée.

This bakery is about 15-20 minutes away from the strip. It located right off the 215 Fwy I believe. It was perfect to come here cause there also a target in the same plaza. Just in case you needed any extra stuff. When we got to the store, it was a couple of people in front of us. You get a number and wait your turn. 

They have tons of choices. I decided to order some cake cookies. They sell it by the pound here. I got the salted sea salt caramel cake cookies. It was so good. The cake was nice and moist. Cookies should always be this good. I should have gotten more of these. They do get pricey quickly. I think I got 7 cookies and they came out to 6 bucks.  

We ended up getting the Parisian cake. It was good. I do like it at Porto's bakery better but close enough. I love the extra chocolate shavings on top of the cake.  All their cakes are really pretty. 

Service was really nice and they were super patient with me. 

Overall, I would come back again and again cause I'm already cravings for some more cake cookies. They do ship anywhere in the united states which I'm not sure if it would be a good or a bad thing.",sWDGavGeP9kMU5rOaNfeUA,1,1,4,2HhuCVoaVd4jWzHruPfNxg

So glad we did.  The Russian tea cookies are amazing, best I have ever had and they are a favorite along with the chantilly lace cookies.  Only draw back on those were how small they were (about half dollar size).  The chocolate cake cookie with salted caramel were delightful.  The touch of salt with the caramel and chocolate are perfectly blended.  
Looking forward to trying the German chocolate cake and chocolate cake. Reviews said they were not friendly and had poor customer service.  We found our server to be nice, but not over the top friendly.  Still would not day the experience was bad or unfriendly.
Price wasn't bad either for all we got.  It was much less expensive then what we would have paid at cake boss and much better variety.
The only draw back was a couple of their bags smelled like they had been stored in a damp musty place and worried it would make the treats taste bad.",lex0WaQ3yVhhRmvL2Ln2mQ,0,0,4,7fYyMXZ0Z3ZSduwNlEtb7Q

I highly recommend this place if you're an elitist, love stale cake, and strawberry shortcake! Upon entering the infamous bakery, my eyes lit up like a little kid in a candy store. The beautifully displayed desserts made me salivate and eager to have everything I desire. Though this dream quickly died, it was for the best. 

It was obvious I looked a little different compared to the people getting served before me with my blue hair and oversized denim jacket. I pay no mind, but when it was my turn she (the worker) treated me quite differently from the well-dressed, pale-faced people before me. Keen to try this beautifully adorned bakery, I ignore it. I acquire about their ready made cakes, but the worker was less than eager to sell me a cake or anything for that matter. It seemed as if she just wanted me to leave. Of course it would be an injustice to dessert lovers everywhere if I didn't walk away with any goodies from a well-known bakery. I say to myself, ""hey you look good, you feel good, you should get some food(something sweet duhh)."" I wasn't about to give up my hopes and dreams of tasting what this glorious bakery has to offer just because of an ill-behaved employee. 

I proceeded to order a slice of strawberry shortcake, Parisian cake, cannoli, and a whole cannoli cake. 

Strawberry shortcake (10/10 super moist, perfect sweetness, and the strawberries were fresh yum!)

Parisian cake (9/10 moist and chocolaty goodness)

Cannoli (0/10 stale and tasted as if it had been sitting on display for quite a while)

Cannoli cake (-100000/10 *ok maybe that's an exaggeration* but from the overly sweet frosting to the crumbly-cardboard-tasting cake, it is sufficed to say that it's the worst cake I've ever tasted and highly overpriced for the quality. It was obvious that this cake was not fresh at all. It was almost as bad as the customer service!)


**P.S. This was just my experience, so don't knock it till you try it!

Until then, I'll stick to my go-to bakery that offers top-notch customer service as well as freshly baked cakes and desserts, but lets save that for another review.",ONH3vCsRZ8xQeBpK_BYQxQ,18,5,1,XxuWBxZ-tj-HNevjRO0GlQ

My first experience with Freed's bakery was 14 years ago when we made a visit to Las Vegas from San Diego for my Sister's birthday. I recall my Mom contacting them at the last minute once we had arrived in town for a b-day cake for my little Sister. They of course came through and prepared an awesome 8 inch round marble cake with vanilla butter cream frosting (real butter cream not the shortening filled sweet artificial frosting). It was decorated so pretty and ready when they said it would be even on short notice.

My second experience with them happened to be during a visit to Las Vegas from Los Angeles with my ex-hubby to celebrate our 5 year Anniversary. I thought a nice treat would be to order a cake for our celebration. I ordered an 8 inch round marble cake with vanilla butter cream frosting decorated and personalized for our Anniversary. Once again they came through on time as promised. During our stay we kept it in the refrigerator in our hotel room and drove it back home with us to LA and it was fine.

Their staff is so helpful and truly know their stuff! They have great ideas and really take that extra step to make what you want or need happen.

Thank you for all of the great cakes and memories Freed's bakery!

Tip: When ordering white butter cream frosting always make sure you specify ""real butter cream"" as in ""butter"". They have two types, a traditional real butter cream (Ivory color tint) and a shortening butter cream (stark white) usually for birthday cakes. I like the taste of butter more than shortening it makes a world of difference!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,3,5,5flS4Qsy_VrXFjpgsWM8CA

5904724,2014-02-27,0,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"I'm kind of on the fence about how many stars to give.  Freed's did the wedding cake for my wedding, which tasted awesome but the service end of it was just terrible!

The wife and I were planning a destination wedding so we really didn't have the luxury of coming back to re-do anything.  If there was something we needed to taste or do it had to be done in one trip.  Freed's Bakery is the one that was provided to us by our venue and my family has picked many cakes from Freed's before for birthdays when we visit Las Vegas.  So when I heard Freed's would be doing our wedding cake I was all excited!!!!!

So my wife worked it out and informed them that we would be showing up for our cake tasting, she had also informed them that she was allergic to chocolate.  So we show up and it seemed to me that neither of the two ladies in the wedding section wanted to help us.  We ended up sitting down with Jayme, the beginning of the downward spiral.  She brought out cake samples which had chocolate on it, problem #1.  We were given a binder of cake pictures in which we could look at and choose a style that we liked but we had also brought in pictures of cakes that we liked.  They weren't complicated cakes, but we were told that it would be an upcharge of $300-400 for any of our cake pictures that we had brought in.  She also seemed more interested in chatting with the other workers there than actually dealing with us.  Another thing that irked me was while we were talking about things she received a personal call on her cell phone.  She picked it up and proceeded to talk about what was going to be for dinner and hung up.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much professionalism but I feel in a business setting, meeting with clients, personal calls shouldn't be taken while you are actually talking to them.  So we left not feeling too good about this bakery we had loved so much.

So we ended up telling our venue coordinator about what happened and she gets on the horn and  then informs us that Freed's will do our cake that we wanted with no upcharge.  YAY!

About a month before the wedding we got our own cake stand and cake topper.  So my wife calls Freed's and gets Jayme....again.  First she starts off saying they don't have her order on file, which they did.  Then she starts giving her attitude about using our own cake stand instead of renting theirs and then other crap about other stuff.  So my wife ends up talking to Max and he gets it done.  Thank god we only have to deal with this lady a few times because this was getting a little out of hand.  I'm not one to tell people how to do their job but you work in a wedding department and you have the worst customer service ever maybe it's time to re-evaluate things.  

So the wedding day comes and we get our cake, which tasted good and is the only thing that saved this review from a 1 star.  If we didn't have to go through someone else every single time to get things done this would have easily been a 5 star review.",VxvFf0NeKk5lT-4Wdp9qkw,4,0,2,AntICCVuOse5b0uzVAePNA

They have a ticket system so if you get there when it's busy, there is no need to stress. Just take a ticket and wait for your number. I highly recommend this bakery. I wouldn't go anywhere else when in Las Vegas. Thank you thank you!!",Fv223okYViK0bIW6Mj8xpQ,0,0,5,8jFDAy1f3b9gIQYx_ge23A

We took our time looking over all of the selections. So many of my favorites! Red velvet cake, tiramisu, huge cream puffs, wedding cake, fruit and custard tarts...and then I see CHOCOLATE KAHLUA BANANA cake. 

How could I possibly pass that up? I can't. It was delicious! Moist chocolate cake, slices of fresh bananas, whipped cream and a hint of Kahlua. Service was quick and friendly. I will definitely be coming back to try more of these sweet treats.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,3,4,5,-PcAwCrJflUbQt-MDhfCyA

5930905,2015-12-17,0,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"Although their cakes and cookies are delicious, it is their customer service and ordering department that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I used to love this bakery and they have made my children's birthday cakes for years. The ordering department is not friendly, does not smile and acts rather annoyed with customers when they place orders. When I came to pick up a cookie tray that was supposed to have 60 for a cookie exchange party, they made a mistake and gave me thirty. I was told that they would correct this mistake ""just this once"". I have never ordered cookies before and was unsure why having too few was an annoyance when their bakery is full of cookies (and I did not care what kind). In the past year, I cringe when I need to go behind the glass doors (a special ordering room) to place an order. The staff acts annoyed, gloomy, and there is an overall feeling that they would prefer if  customers would not bother them. The only bright spot is the man and woman that work the counter (outside the glass doors). I am afraid that Freeds has lost my business and from what I have heard from other mothers in Henderson, mine is not a unique experience.",3-CZ7iMSA19FH5j8EbLijw,0,0,1,s4HBRziL-SaziZBPu4OLIg

The cakes taste great and ordering them has been super easy. Today I went in to pick up a cake and talk to them about ordering a pastry platter for an upcoming party. This is where Freed's has failed me, and hence lost stars. Their sales department didn't try to help us set up our order. The lady basically said just go online and order it there. Also, everything they sell isn't online but going in the store doesn't help either, so good luck finding what you want. I also asked for a punch card since we've been buying so much from them lately. The sales girl had to be asked for it twice and then didn't say anything about it. Apparently buying cakes doesn't count for anything with them. It doesn't encourage loyalty to say the least. I got my cake from them but my party platters will be ordered elsewhere. I'm looking for a business that wants to have a relationship with us, and Freed's didn't step up. Good baked goods though.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,3,nxh55v9RZ9EqjvHWb_TFrg
5948127,2014-05-26,0,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"Really sublime cakes.  Not too sweet and made with the freshest ingredients.  I got a slice of german choc and strawberry shortcake.  So good.  The cookies are all fantastic too and when you check in you get 5 free cookies.  Great deal.  I ONLY WISH they had bread.  I drove to Vegas from LA and went straight here.  I had visions of a Jewish Rye, but alas, it wasn't to be.  Oh well, still great cakes.

I am a baker and so I have high standards.  Case in point, I can't stand Porto's cakes  ( I live in SoCal).  There fillings are very artificial tasting and gloppy.  I thought the two cakes slices I tasted blew PORTO's out of the water.  The cookie's were sublime too, especially the rainbow cakey cookie.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,3,0,5,UE7s5cP50T3c1KKpk8M8Tg

5972294,2016-05-24,3,olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,"Although my cake was absolutely phenomenal, decorations phenomenal flavor phenomenal  I am giving a one star because of attitude.
When I came in to order a cake 10 days before I needed it, it seemed as though the woman was so rude ""oh we can't do a cut out, we can't do this, we can't do that!"" The woman was rude and smug as if I wasn't going to order something big enough or expensive enough for it to be worth her time. Finally I said ""I'm here to order a cake . I have money what can you make me? "" 
An older woman stepped in and took over and was very nice made the order happen. Instead of yelping then I figure maybe that was a fluke thing and I'll let it go.
When I cut came to pick the cake up everyone was talking amongst themselves, nobody wanted to help me, even though I had a number and a prepaid cake. Super frustrating. Finally a younger woman looks at me and says oh did you need something? No I just like to sand and a cake shop for no reason. 
At the end of the day the quality of cake and decoration and their ability is wonderful but their attitude will drive me to another bakery.",sW5ubhE3aJFcz1r-ecTLUA,7,4,1,B7pus2deJ4GLvbacUHh_5Q

I sent out an inquiry to multiple bakeries, and Freed's Bakery became my number one choice. They are very quick to communicate through email. Janie, the person I communicated with, was a GREAT help. She was very professional, very helpful, and very quick to respond. I was very impressed with their service, being that I was all the way in Hawaii. When my trip to LV grew closer, Janie was kind enough to confirm my order. When I got there, everything was all set for pick-up. 
The location was easy to find. Although the employees AT Freed's Bakery were ""somewhat"" helpful and ""somewhat"" kind, I was relieved to pick up my cake. It was exactly how I ordered it. The sturdiness didn't last long, it did fall apart AT the event, however, I give this place a 4 star BECAUSE of Janie and her customer service.
