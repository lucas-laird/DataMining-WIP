I ordered a pho ga and it was the most disappointing Vietnamese food I have ever had. First off, they tried to use egg noodles in the pho, which is completely wrong. So we requested rice noodles (the correct noodles) instead. It was completely undercooked and had the consistency of rubber. The broth wasn't even chicken broth. Instead, it was broth used in wonton soup. The chicken was very bland with too much cartilage and tendon. This bowl of pho was so egregious and the portion size was incredibly small, considering it cost over $16. While I understand this is Las Vegas and everything will be overpriced, $16 bowl of pho at such low quality is ridiculous. It was also so poorly made that I was left with a stomach ache for hours, and I didn't even eat half of it.

She's the type that wouldn't eat anything and so when she said she wanted noodle soup - this was the closest place we could take her to because her parents was at the Celine Dion concert and we didn't have a car to take her anywhere else so we were stuck in RIo - which was where they were staying at. So therefore wouldn't have tried this place at all if it wasn't for her - but in the end she didn't even eat that much. 

Well anyways onto the food - we ordered a bowl of rare and well-done beef pho, a grilled chicken rice plate, a grilled pork rice plate and an order of spring roll, two hot tea and one coffee - all this for the outrageous price of $65!! This isn't a restaurant either - it's more like an express Vietnamese place located inside Rio and shares it's seating and tables with a pizza place and a taco place. The portions were okay - they weren't exceptionally huge for the price but they didn't skimp either - I guess it was just enough. Man I have never paid so much for Vietnamese food before - each plate was about 15 dollars - two spring rolls was 5 dollars and the two tea and one hot coffee was 15 dollars. The food like I said was pretty good tasting though but still pretty expensive right?

Well there wasn't really much service to speak of either - since we ordered and we picked it up ourselves.

2189225,2015-06-09,0,9ae7asMUB-Fty3tw6m18qQ,"Sadly, Pho Da Nang in the Rio Las Vegas has really taken a nosedive downhill in quality over the past year.  I ate there twice this past weekend (and ate there several times a year ago as well).  The Pho Ga (chicken pho) was borderline awful.  The quality of the meat, the chicken, was really bad.  I don't remember this being the case a year ago.  The chicken was rubbery, seemed not very fresh, and tasted terrible.  So I decided to give Pho Da Nang one more try another night and ordered the ""Terriyaki Chicken Bowl"", which, as it turns out isn't even a ""bowl"" at all.  It is a ""plate"" with a dumping of rice, a side of broccoli and the same terrible chicken chopped into strips.  The chicken was NOT fresh grilled.  It was frozen, sodium-infused, reheated breast meat complete with the fake grill marks you see at cheap fast food joints.  Very disappointing they would stoop to this poor quality level of chicken.  I couldn't even eat it all it as the chicken was such a sodium bomb, rubbery texture, and ridiculous fake ""grill"" marks.  I guess they tried to hide this by smothering it with way too much teriyaki sauce.  At least the rice and broccoli was decent.

Ordering is reminiscent of McDonald's where you tell them what you want and pay at the counter - then listen for your name and go pick up your food on a tray. I had combo pho with shrimp and rare steak. It wasn't bad but I also wouldn't return for it. I don't know if I can adequately describe the small difference between the taste of the pho here versus the taste at any pho place along Spring Mountain. The noodles, for one thing, are flat. I don't mind flat noodles but I'm hoping that detail can summarize the small noticeable differences between my go to soup spots and this.

I wanted to try something new and I do not remember this being here since my last visit. I guess vietnamese food in Vegas and me do not mix well. 

Food Order with Price (rounded to the whole dollar)
#19: Charbroiled pork chop with rice plate $12 (Place two orders)
#15: Beef with Vermicelli $12 (Place two orders)
#22: Ice French Milk $5
#24: The Thai Ice Tea $4 
#9: Egg Rolls $7 
Grand Total: $64

Customer service here was horrible and results in the reason that this place only get two stars. A male working who was wearing a uniform that was for a referee at a soccer game took our order. While another female worker with glasses was busy taken another order on the phone who seem to be in Pho Da Nang uniform. The person in the referee uniform throwing all sorts of attitudes at us today. It seem he might have not had any luck at the tables. The waitress who was busy on the phone when we arrived to take our order gave us a apology earning one star back. 

The food it really standard for Vietnamese. The prices are a little hiked compared to the price in NYC but it a casino and Vegas (Hint: You if are a local you get a discount! ). I stayed away from the pho noodles because of the mix reviews from fellow yelpers. Probably the best thing is the egg rolls number 9. They are massive compared to the New York City version.

If you are looking for just plan old average vietnamese food with served with a side of FRESH ATTITUDE this is the place to be! Probably visit again but next time I will tell them to hold the attitude.",9quoE4bUcVKbnqTLCaZNzg,37,35,2,1sXj97HHp4Rjhxqhp4q7sw

The response was snarky and condescending to both.  It was as though I should know what exactly was in each one.

The cashier indicated that both had mushrooms without even looking at me, and gave me the impression that I was wasting her time.  Our interaction made me feel like they didn't care about the customer, and that was reflected in the food as well.

So I ended up getting the spring rolls even though she said they had mushrooms in them.  I did not notice them at all, if there were even any in them.  They were the most unusually textured and wrapped spring rolls I had ever had.  It looked to have some type of extra crispy coating on the outside.

So I went closer and was surprised to find out a new Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas that no one has talked about yet . The name is called ""Pho Da Nang"". Their menu consists of many popular Vietnamese items, such as Pho, Bun Thit Nuong, rice dishes, etc... 

Two things that came to my mind when I was browsing through the menu. The first thing is I gotta try their Pho and hopefully (very hopefully) that Vegas finally has a good Pho joint. The second thing that came to my mind was ""what the pho with the price"".Holy macaroni, their Pho has to better be damn good if they want to charge $15 a bowl + tax. Almost eveything in their menu ranges from $13 to $15, Normally you would find this prices in the strip, but Rio is like 5 blocks away from Chinatown. 

Anyway, I ordered their Pho combo and it came out pretty quick. The bowl consists of noodle, rare steak, sliced beef shank (what the heck??? beef shank doesn't go with Pho, beef shank normally go with Bun Bo Hue), and soup. For those that are not familiar with Pho, the combination normally goes with thinly sliced rare round steak, cooked brisket, tripe, tendon. 

Did this bowl of Pho pass my taste test? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. The soup was bland and un-flavorful (is this a word?). I had to put a bunch of fish sauce and hoisin sauce to make it edible. The thinly sliced steak was tender, but the beef shank tasted fatty and not right for Pho. Overall, Pho is two stars.

Overall, they better cut down the price or improve the quality if they want to attract local customers. Since it's so close to Chinatown, I highly doubt they can rely on tourists as their main customers if they don't improve on their food.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,4,1,2,fDshdmlZDrP1sNKsFJxVBA

It was $14 a dish, but they serve huge portions. We wished we'd known that, so we could've split just one entree. Nonetheless, bigger portion doesn't mean better taste. Both dishes were simply okay, like I attempted making these dishes in my own home, not like I was at a legit eating establishment. The dishes tasted like some key ingredient was missing, but I couldn't identify what. Felt very gross after eating here, and again when reheating the leftovers the next day.",jOxqMuRREc6i-X0T6vltUw,0,0,2,OTGaAOeZylY-iSIm6vkMZg

The broth, noodles, and overall flavor is a 3+.  I later tried the Pho Special.  It was very good with lots of meat and correct flavor.  I didn't experience the poor food that others mentioned.  I'd give it a 4-.  The minus because pieces of meat were very fatty and the pho was almost $17 - the most expense pho I've ever eaten!  I can get this dish for $7 in SoCal.

But coming from 3 authentic Vietnamese people, none of the food we ordered was good...even for just general food. My husband ordered a pho which was ridiculously bland and tasted nothing like the normal aromatic pho that any regular pho restaurant would give you. It honestly tasted like it was just made of chicken broth. The rice plates (grilled pork) that both my mom and I ordered came out cold and chewy. Not to mention this place is 3 times as expensive as a normal pho restaurant. I know its located inside of a casino, but spending nearly $20 for just a bowl of pho and a drink is pretty damn outrageous.
