Appetizer: crispy broccoli
This was delicious. Perfectly crispy, sauce was sweet and sour (like a sweet lemon sauce). It was really good! There was too much sauce though and it was sometimes overwhelming.

Main course: pepperoni pizza
Really good. The Arrabbiata sauce was amazing and the garlic slices were delicious. Had to ask for more garlic.

Main course: pappardelle with mushrooms
Terrible. Pasta was overcooked, not al dente at all. Not enough sauce so all the pasta stuck together in a huge clump and it was dry. The dish has big chunks of mushroom but it tasted bland. Not much of a mushroom flavor at all. Needs some salt. In the end we added some of the garlic from the pizza into the pasta and it was much better. Still not great though.

Sean was our waiter. He was very knowledgeable about the menu items which helped us make the right choices. He gets five stars for that and service. The reason I gave only 4 stars has to do with the hostess. The restaurant wasn't very busy at the time we arrived. There were so many empty seats that some employees seemed to have nothing to do.

155259,2015-12-17,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Just ate here with a Groupon and won't be back. The temp here in Vegas is in the 40's yet the front door was propped open to attract customers walking by. At first I felt sorry for the hostess who was wearing a winter coat. Then I felt bad for me as I was freezing my entire meal and I'm from Chicago! Apparently it's more important to entice new customers than take care of your current ones. Obviously the food, once served got cold really fast. 

I ordered the soup which was excellent and the smothered fries which is supposed to have pulled pork in it. I tore the fries apart and found one small bite size piece of meat. When I questioned our server about this, he could have cared less. But that didn't surprise me as he could have cared less about anything. I requested salt and pepper when our food was delivered. I ended up having to get up and get it from a table by us because he just disappeared. Meanwhile don't forget, the dining room is freezing and my soup is getting colder by the minute.  People next to us ordered coffee, got it, but didn't have spoons. They requested spoons several times and again the waiter just disappears. I'm sure their coffee got cold while waiting for something to stir it with. The garlic bread I ordered was burned. We had to laugh and said it was just like home. But seriously what kind of chef burns bread and then sends it out of the kitchen? What wait staff professional would serve it??

So, in a nutshell, service was bad, restaurant was freezing, my food was ill prepared and no one cared. The manager came to our table to swipe my Groupon and couldn't be bothered to ask about our dining experience. The high prices here will deter most people. Having been to Vegas dozens and dozens of times I still get shocked when a glass of pop at your table is $4.95. It's truly highway robbery. 

I HIGHLY recommend any other of the many dining options close by. Mon Ami Gabi right next door is 1000x better for about the same price.",RtVkKdCNcUyVbKIapFF4ew,0,0,1,dpB0xSHiXTKiWgNP6Tboqg

She was incredible!! From excellent food suggestions to making my sister laugh to chasing down my grandfather when he forgot his jacket at the table, she really went above and beyond to make it a great meal.

Great staff from Parish, the host, who was so accommodating and polite  (and adorable with his bow tie) to our server Maria (knowledgeable, engaging, attentive) to the chefs who have outdone themselves with the menu....we tried a little bit of a LOT OF stuff and while everything was tasty and beautifully presented, a few things stood out: the broccolini. Really. It's an appetizer and we all thought, ""huh?"" because who wants to eat a plate of that stuff before a nice meal?! But it's delicious! I can't even describe it---some kind of marinade happened and then I think it's fried. ....what you get is the lightest, most delicious thing you never expected! Other standouts: the meatballs, the artichoke dip, the BACON! For entrees, the New York strip was melt in your mouth even better than the Filet. Chicken and waffles? An unlikely dinner option that turned out to be a great choice. The jumbalaya was generous with the shrimp and chicken and not too spicy, the burgers were excellent. We also had a sampling of desserts and my favorite was the French silk tart. Hexx seems to pride themselves on high quality local foods and it shows. 
Because of the size of our party (9), we were seated at a long table with upholstered booth on one side and chairs on the other. I was so pleasantly surprised by the throw pillows which were decorative and great back support!  Get the right spot and you can see the Bellagio fountains while you dine. Though the restaurant was busy, we never felt rushed AND we were lucky enough to get a tour of the chocolate making facility (bean to bar) after we finished our meal. Fascinating and I highly recommend if you get the chance. We have eaten our way through a lot of Vegas and Hexx is the place that stood out as best quality and most memorable.

Once the food came my sis asked for some extra dipping sauce and got it with no problem. He even brought me extra syrup that forgot to ask him for. It was like he was reading my mind. He had about 4 tables to serve at once and never missed a beat.I wouldnt have known he was new if he hadn't mentioned it. CHEERS TO SEAN!

I ordered ""Grilled King Salmon.  manhattan clam chowder, arugula salad.""  The 'clam chowder' consisted of several clams in open shells, and a little bit of liquid in the bottom of the plate, with small pieces of vegetable.  At first I thought it was just liquid from the salmon, which was in the middle of the plate.  The 'arugula salad' was really more of a garnish on top of the salmon.  The most disappointing part was that the salmon wasn't cooked through. The half that was cooked was good, the rest was orange/pink jello.  I declined the offer of another piece of salmon, since I was ready to leave by that point.  

My dinner companion ordered the New York steak, 10oz, which looked small for 10oz.  The blue cheese butter was specifically asked to be left off the steak, but it arrived with it anyway.  The second steak that came out, this time without the butter and about whenI finished the cooked part of my meal, apparently was good.

Cost, without tip, for both meals, one soda, and two glasses of water, was just over $80.

First impressions of the restaurant was great, the interior decor was modern and clean. We sat at the high tops located right when you enter the dining area. 

Not 100% on the name of the pitcher we order for drinks but i believe it was on a special drinks menu and it involved dragonfruit (Kinky something) recommend by our waitress. It was delicious, only down side is it cannot be poured into separate glasses (says the waitress) because the presentation involves dry ice. 

For appetizers we ordered, Over cooked bacon, which is exactly what it sounds like haha, Crispy Broccolini, which were great (must try), and the spicy pork rinds which also what it sounds like. Figured there would be something more than just the obvious. 

We also ordered Chinese Chicken Salad (yum), Sausage flat bread (meh), and the spicy jambalaya (super spicy but the best entree we ordered out of everything).

The restaurant appeared higher class, but looks can be deceiving. Our server did not get to us for 10 minutes, even though they weren't busy.

I asked our server, upon which she replied that she was new, so the manager would come over to explain. I had tried to flag him down before, but he seemed to avoid walking by our table. He finally came over, upon which I inquired about the fee (which was in small fine print in the menu, and on the receipt was labeled ""cnf""). I wonder if only a few people had noticed this before, but when I asked, he responded that it was a fee associated as their position as a tenant in the casino as opposed to a free standing business.  I replied, ""So, rent?"" He curtly said ""oh, um, yes,"" as he walked away. I wasn't allowed any follow up questions or comments before he fled, nor did he ask how our experience was at any point.

We had a party of 16 and 6 people's food came out over a half hour before the rest. Jambalaya, 27 bucks. The two ladies who ordered it could not eat more than a third due to the spice. Burger looked great but at 20 bucks you had to pay extra for fries. Marguerita Pizza ok. Wish it was fresh basil instead of pesto drizzle but I understand the twist.  I didn't care for it all in all. Service a bit funny - never had my water glass so well attended in my life to the point of annoyance.  Waiter brought out dessert forks for all so we thought there was comp dessert as it was a wedding reception and then he brought out one scoop of icecream and a brownie  then told the bride and groom they could pass it around the table... to 16 people... oy vey awkward.

When we got there the restaurantp had changed since she last went there. I was expecting a candy type theme since it was right next door to a candy store. My sister had stated this also in the first place since this was the main reason we went. I have never been looked at so coldly from a hostess before we even exchanged words. She unwillingly greeted us and asked how many in our party. I had my two young kids with me, one in a stroller. They said they don't allow strollers in the restaurant. I could see if it was a big traveling bulky stroller that I had it would be a problem, but I didn't. It was a simple folding one. So I said it was fine and that I could hold my baby and fold up the stroller so that it would not be in the way. It could easily lie underneath the table. They said ok. Once we got seated to the table, I heard the hostess tell the server passing by that she had a table up but in a way that sounded like ""ugh you got a table of 5, so sorry you have to serve these people with kids."" Once we sat down, I thanked the hostess and she just looked at me with this half ass smile like ""yeah your welcome, your lucky to be seated in here."" Then just walked away. I was like ok that's it. I tried to look pass the rude glares from the hostesses and server. So I said let's leave. And we did.

If you are looking for good food and nice view better go to Mon A mi Gabi. We came there (hexx) for an anniversary and won't came back again. My husband got burger - dry and salty. He had to ask for extra sauce (only one good thing about burger) to keep it a little moist . White fish (I think it was haddock) - dry. Thanks to the moist risotto i could eat it. 36$ fish meal should taste better. Punch - the only cool thing about the drink was the presentation -  fog over it. We would love to complain about the food at the dinner but saw server briefly 4 times 
- took drinks order,  we were not ready to make food order so he had to come back to take our food order
- stopped him to get extra sauce 
- dropped at out table sauce - fast
- asked us about desert holding already check for us. Pretty much when server gives you check and ask about desrt it's like ""hey are you hungry yes or no well  I already have check for you so I'm done here"".  
Spend more than 100$ for dinner but nothing special about this place. Not for celebrating anniversary or any other occasion  maybe just for a quick bite while u walking down the strip because service was fast . We were in and out of the restaurant. 

I went to the chocolate tasting next door - it was amazing! Chocolates are very Good! Cookies were great as well. That place deserves 5 star",Up7eJzTXxUAb5_L7ZY7Rtw,2,0,2,KqJpRWtYQFBAukRn_on9BA

Located off the strip across from the Bellagio fountains, HEXX focuses on fresh, quality, approachable American cuisine with extensive drink options OH, and it's attached to a candy store as well! What's not to like about that?

I loved the atmosphere; modern, cozy, home-y vibe that made you feel like you were in someone's house casually sitting down for a good meal. As we settled in we pursued the brunch menu and I actually had trouble picking what I wanted because everything looked so good to me. After some rounds of coffee I opted for the ham and cheese croissant which our server recommended and I was not displeased in my decision. It was a huge sandwich with aged gooey cheddar, a nice helping of black forest ham, and a nice soft and warm croissant bun served with a side of their home fries. Seemed like the perfect way to start my morning as  I was completely satisfied with what I ate and now was ready to get my day started. And although the candy kitchen seemed very tempting, I had to restrain myself since I was still basking in my brunch pleasure and it seemed too early for that, until next time!

Tom was our server who was phenomenal. He was positive, quick, and knowledgeable of the menu.

We enjoyed a bottle of cab reasonably priced at $60, the meatballs ($15), the margarita pizza ($16), and the flourless brownie ($10).  Everything tasted great.  The pizza was a little cold but did have a lot of flavor and the brownie was very VERY rich, you'll only want a couple of bites.

Asked for some suggestions which included the steak and eggs and the ham and cheese croissant. However, I had my eye on the chicken and waffle meal. She said it was great and a big portion. 

When it arrived it was the waffle with two strips and two wings fried to a golden brown. Crispy on the outside and nice and hot on the inside. The wings were ok, but not enough meat. 

The waffle was good, but wasn't blown away. It could have been a bit crispier.

Came with spicy pickles which were pretty tasty.

He made a snide comment about my parents not listening to him when he was talking about the specials. I asked for a different waiter and he scoffed and left.

743132,2016-10-10,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"It's hard to find a decent place to eat on the strip - I struggle to find a place that's proportionately priced to the quality. You mostly pay exorbitant prices for average food in a fancy setting or exorbitant prices for average food in an average setting. Either way, tastebuds and wallet are not in sync. Except for Hexx!!

I saw Hexx from across the strip and suggested we check it out for lunch instead of one of the mainstream (and not very good) chain restaurants we were passing. Checked out the menu and were able to grab seats at the bar in time for happy hour pricing on food and drinks - it was great! We split the spinach artichoke dip (very tasty) and I got the tomato and burrata bruschetta. I don't see the bruschetta listed on their menu online, so I hope it's still available - it was delicious! And both appetizers were especially generous in portion, for pretty reasonable prices (and not just Vegas-reasonable, I mean actual reasonable). It was a really perfect lunch (kind of lunch turned linner) stop for us, and I highly recommend it. I was so impressed with the quality, quantity, and price point of the food I actually sought out the manager and complimented/thanked him for running such a great find - and right on the strip!

Some would say it was by chance we landed here, others might say fate...my friend was obsessed with going to the ""candy restaurant, where they serve candy for dinner!"" (which we all immediately shut down) but, as it turns out, that very same restaurant is Hexx. They have an attached candy shop and apparently went through a revamp a year or so ago - so the rumor of a candy restaurant had been true (or at least as true as rumors tend to be) but we all also enjoyed a great meal.",6HAPBZtfmQWxQpRLvRxn3w,1,1,4,po4QB0lneoYE0WAOmU2bNA

Hubby had french toast and I had the chicken and waffles. Both were very delicious. My chicken and waffle was a huge portion. We could have split it. In fact, I gave hubby a big piece of my chicken since I had more than enough and he needed some protein. The fried chicken was excellent!

The mimosas were also good. The pre mix the oj and the bubbly into pitchers so they can refill glasses quickly. I would have preferred not having them pre-mixed just because too much acidity in the oj can bother me. However it wasn't a deal breaker.

This is the equivalent of making up a rule that you can only drive 5 mph on a road and then pulling someone over for going 4 mph. If you are going to have your own insane rules at least follow them.

From the ambiance, to the service, to the food/drinks to the incredibly talented Chef Piekarski... everything was beyond amazing!  I could not ask for a better experience!  I was celebrating my birthday and decided on this restaurant since I knew we could sit on the patio & have a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show as we ate.  I'm so happy we went here.  From the moment my party & I walked into Hexx - we were treated like we were the only ones in the restaurant - who wouldn't luv that kind of service?!?!
Our table ordered the Overcooked Bacon & Hummus Bruscetta for aps - both were perfect on the palette!  Not so heavy of an ap that it ruins your appetite for dinner either.  They were spot on for taste & portions!
For dinner, we ordered the Rib Eye, Chicken & Waffles, Sea Bass & Chicken Schnitzel entrees.  All 4 dinners were mouthwatering!  The Ribby (my fav cut of steak) - so juicy, perfect char, and cooked to my exact liking - medium.  It came with this dollop of garlic butter on the rib eye - that took the already delicious steak to a whole new level of deliciousness!  The Chicken & Waffles - Even better than we anticipated.  The chicken wasn't at all dry & had a perfect crunch to it.  The waffles - not your ordinary waffles.  What a wonderful suprise of flavor!  I could eat those all day!  The Roasted Sea Bass was absolute perfection!  Respectively seasoned, juicy & had a little crunch to it cause of the perfectly cooked skin.  That too, had a flavorful char on it (I do luv me some char - lol).  But the best dish of the night was the Chicken Schnitzel.  OMG!!!   As my sis would say ""Their Schnitzel is the Shitzel"".  We really didn't know what to expect from this dish but from the moment I tasted it... there was a very savory party going on in my mouth!  My taste buds were definitely doing the happy dance!
We were so impressed by the food that we just had to thank the Chef in person.  I asked our fabulous server, Vanessa, if we could speak to the Chef & without missing a beat, she told us she'd go get him.  A few mins later, the accomplished Chef Piekarski came out and chatted with us for appx 10mins.  He gave us a little Hexx history & a little backstory about himself.  Super friendly & super gracious!!  He never once made us feel rushed to speak to him & he happily posed for pictures with us.  Meeting him and being able to show our gratitude was the cherry on top of everything.... Or so I thought.  Next thing we know, we're getting served a heavenly array of desserts sent from the Chef himself!  The Creme Brulee... absolutely divine!
I was in Vegas for 5 days, did all sorts of fun things, ate all kinds of different foods & saw a concert.  Hands down, the highlight of my entire trip was my experience at Hexx.  I can't thank Vanessa & Chef Piekarski enough for making my bday dinner such a memorable evening!

I had seen an interesting advertisement outside by their doors showcasing what looked like sangria pitchers with what looked like dry ice making fog rise from the pitchers. I thought it would be interesting to try so I came back with my wife to experience that. Since we were not going to eat the hostess sent us to the bar. We sat there for literally no joke about ten minutes and no one acknowledged us at all. We weren't complaining because we aren't jerks or assholes we understand that the staff might be busy with other guests but it was about 3pm and there was five people scattered throughout the bar and there was three bartenders. It wasn't until one of them needed to use the register that was next to where we were sitting that I had the opportunity to ask for service asm he replied that he needed to take care of the two ladies sitting three stools away. Horrible service. Horrible service. Maybe he was being racist? Maybe he was being discriminate? Maybe he doesn't belong in the service industry? The reason I bring up the race card? My wife and I are Hispanic. The rest of the patrons were anglos. That was my observation. Why bring up the discrimination? Maybe because he saw that we were Hispanic, he assumed we were going to be rude or maybe even be bad tippers? I work in services as well, my bonuses are directly from client feedback through what my company calls net promotor score. If I meet my metrics I get a bonus. If a server or bartender gives good service or even great service they should assume a great tip. I tip 20% regardless because I understand the service industry. This person, with grayish short hair wearing a blue striped long sleeve shirt didn't even give us the opportunity to pay for a good from this establishment much Lee's tip him. He seemed like he had more authority than the bartenders so he might be a manager or whatever maybe he felt like he can choose his patrons.

He then asked if they could butterfly it (when I'm at restaurants and they ask me this it gives me the inclination that they do not have an experienced chef in the kitchen so I usually skip it). But ok, butterfly it. He then tried to convince me to get it with some pink, no! The food took over 30 mins to come out and it was just ok. The roasted asparagus tasted like they picked it fresh out of the ground and slapped in on the plate. The steak was butterflied, but still CHARRED on the edges, yuck. I ate in the center of the steak where it was cooked thoroughly but not burnt. My husband had the chicken and waffles, which he said was good. This is the only reason they got two stars.

Carrot cake was moist cream cheese frosting fresh pineapple topping and a scoop of vanilla to add that creamy goodness to this decadent dish.

Brownie - texture was crumbly and not the melt-in-your mouth texture we were hoping for. Coffee ice cream texture was fine but it needed more coffee flavor.

Chocolate silk pie - it was a tarte with a thin layer of chocolate mousse in a thick graham cracker crust and a large mound of whipped cream on top. The chocolate mousse lacked strong chocolate flavor and once diluted with the whipped cream, was not strong enough to stand up against the strong graham cracker taste from the thick crust.

We got our ticket and there was a CNF charge next to our bill and we asked the waiter what it was and she said it was a charge for being on the strip and immediately called over the manager to explain. We found this behavior really odd. Once the manager came to our table he said he would discount one of our food items. Our question Was what was CNF charge? We didn't expect a discount BUT we realized they charged us a fee for something that was not disclosed anywhere on the menu or advertised as such. Everything was great except the sketchiness of this charge. Weird business going on here.,t51QSwdfOS9aUhbspLNJ3A,0,0,3,Nzl6eMxcjyxBI7Egu8v5vQ

Over cooked, tasteless, and dry steaks, both the NY Strip and the Filet Mignon. If pressed, go with the Filet, but these are not quality cuts, properly aged, properly seasoned, or properly cooked. Why ask for a temperature if it's not coming out that way. Sure, they offered to replace it, but that sets the timing off for the meal. Maybe it's my fault as their are more expensive steakhouses in this property and all the adjacent ones, but $40 should still buy a decent steak, even in Vegas.

My date and I were at Hexx for an event, and were able to sample a beautiful assortment of small tastes and cocktails.

Honestly, there wasn't a thing that I didn't love.
Real standouts were 

Wagyu Beef ""Burger""
Shrimp Ceviche
& Braised Short Rib.

I don't know if the Tempura Shrimp that we were served is on the regular menu; but dear God, I could live on that. I don't know how they did it, but it has spoiled me for all other tempura. I will return to eat a trough full of it soon. 

The staff knocked it out of the park!
Serving a very large group of picky people can be a nightmare, I'm sure. But each server that I 
encountered was fun, friendly, and seemed honestly happy to be there (and trust me, this is not always the case on The Strip). 

I'm sure you'll be made welcome in whatever you happen to be wearing (mostly) - but the atmosphere is nice-casual - leaning more toward the 'nice' at night. Street clothes are fine during the day, but you'll fit in wearing sharp goin-out duds at dinner time. Make Las Vegas Classy Again.

Spinning lollipops vs Chocolate 

Locals and avid Vegas tourists understand what I'm saying. No lies, I loved the Sugar Factory. Everything from the ambiance, the food and the service. The concept of having a candy shop attached was cool. The spinning lollipops were fun but now very 3 years ago.

Now for Hexx, I really love their concept and the changes they made by opening up one side. Enjoying some sun, people watching and enjoying the Bellagio fountains is just part of The Strip. We were seated on the patio, so we could enjoy all three sports on the Strip.

We ordered the bacon and it was super crispyn. thought it good, but I'm not a fan of overcooked anything, so I guess it's a matter of taste. For my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was great but I found the chicken to be bland and dry. Chicken breast can dry pretty fast and that's what happened. I don't think I will order it again.

After brunch, my daughter and I shared the hot chocolate and wow it was good. I'm big on hot chocolate... Angelina's in Paris... Max Brenner... I like it a lot. HEXX has amazing hot chocolate, very rich and a good consistently. 

The service was amazing. We weren't rushed and they were all very friendly.

When done, head next door to pick up some chocolates. Don't expect it to be the packaged cheap stuff you pick up at a grocery store. They serve chocolate here, it's the real deal.

The wait staff were cordial but very busy and therefore we had to wait a long time for everything (like coffee refills :-\ ).

We had the corned beef hash (a very small portion), the Farm Fresh Eggs with a side of bacon, and coffee.  Although the portion was small the corned beef was good, and so were the farm fresh eggs and bacon.  I think the coffee was the best part of the meal, but like I said we had to wait for it.

HEXX is one of those places that run 24/7 and isn't your usual drab, out-dated caf√©.  

The staff are young, good-looking and smile even when you don't know what you're talking about.  My friend decided to order two shots, but since he's diabetic and rarely drinks he didn't know much about them.  The bartender was left to guess and what we got wasn't what he expected and wasn't drinkable.  They didn't charge for them, but I still felt bad.  The Hypnotizing Strawberry was awesome if kind of weak in the booze department and it cost $15.  That's high for any bar!  The cool looking Hexx potions (I actually think they must be pitchers to share) that they decorate with dry ice effects were over $30 each!

We ordered a Margherita Pizza and Spaghetti with Meatballs.  I thought the pizza was okay but I've had better.  The pasta, on the other hand, was great!  Three juicy, flavorful meatballs and a big pile of al dente spaghetti soaked in a wonderful tomato sauce coated with Parmesan and dried garlic.  Was it worth over $22?  Jury is still out on that one, but chances are we wouldn't return here even for that dish unless we were close by and thin on choices like this last time.

However, that's pretty much the extent of it for me. The prices, as expected, were high, and it blew my mind that the burgers and steaks didn't come with sides. I ordered the New York steak, but was handed a prime rib instead. I didn't feel like complaining, so I just accepted it with a smile. However, the first bite was RIDICULOUSLY salty. Like, 5-days-worth-of-sodium-in-that-single-bite salty. My manager and I (who also ordered a steak) both sent our steaks back because this girl had size zero slacks to fit into the next day, and I couldn't afford any unnecessary bloating.

Our steaks came back *much* better in terms of seasoning. Definitely more edible, which is good! Unfortunately, the steak was very fatty (don't necessarily blame the restaurant for this, as I know most prime ribs are), and extremely greasy. I wish I could have dabbed it with a napkin but I didn't want my coworkers to judge me! The small side of balsamic glazed onions were extremely greasy as well; I'm sure they drench their food in oil while cooking. Some people love that, but I, however, am not a fan.

We also ordered a dessert platter, and while good, it wasn't super memorable. Service was good, as our waiter was very personable and our food came our within a reasonable amount of time.

White bean hummus ($10) was great but they give you so little pita bread youre stuck with half the jar remaining and no pita bread.  

One sticking point that will not see me returning or sending any of my friends is the fact you cant use the 20% off business card they give out and Opentable giftcard at the same time.

To top it all off, Chef Shay came to my table to see how everything was, which all I could do was look in her eyes with a lustful desire as I chowed down on my amazingly elaborate seafood platter.

The steaks are TO DIE FOR. No teeth? No problem. They fall apart in your mouth. I don't know what they did but I ate a piece of heaven that night.

Their desserts rival the artwork of Michelangelo and taste like a flavor bomb exploded in your mouth.

1408626,2017-07-31,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Took a trip down to Las Vegas about 2 weeks ago and came across this place as we were looking for a breakfast/brunch spot. 

The atmosphere of this restaurant was extremely cleanly and nice. We were seated as soon as we walked in because the restaurant space is pretty large. 

The menu was very straight forward and there was quite a few delicious looking items. 

There were 4 of us and we tried the following items:

1. Corned Beef Hash 
- Portion was pretty small, however the dish itself was very flavorful. 

2. Gravlax Benedict 
- Wasn't the biggest fan of the English muffin because when it was brought out it was pretty soggy so it didn't have the right taste to it, however when removing the muffin, the rest of the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. 

3 . Chilaquiles
- Expected to get some crispy nachos, however there was a slight problem to food coming out soggy. So it seemed as if the nachos stood out for awhile and by the time they got to the table, they were no longer crispy. 

4. Candied Bacon 
- This was probably my favorite thing that I tried. Although the candied bacon wasn't extra crispy, the flavor was superb. Each bite was mouthwatering. 

5. Venezuelan Milk Chocolate Cheesecake 
- Definitely a very delicious cheesecake and the portion was HUGE! The caramel popcorn on the sides was the perfect touch! 

Overall a decent place to dine and another plus side to it is that it's open 24/7!!",4HLCSV6wlKfjigyvLFREjQ,0,0,4,4YAGe8tW7b_kAcPI5rB-ug

   I stopped in HEXX, to wait for my husband who was @ the UNLV vs Duke basketball game ~ had some time to kill, was hungry had seen picks in Paris of their burger, to cold to wait outside @ Beer Park, saw an open table in the bar and the rest is history!!!

   I kinda consider myself a burger addict or affecianado!!! Don't eat fast food burgers and consider Bachi Burger the burger to me measured against!!!! And the Hexx Burger stands up very solidly to Bachi. (In my opinion) 

    Not only does the burger look good ~ it's DEEEELISSSH. I don't know if it's the fully melted American cheese, the well done bacon or the chocolate bun.... YEAH!

First, let's talk about the service.  Our servers both times were super friendly, attentive but not intrusive.  They both made the dining experience pleasurable.  For dinner we had the shrimp cocktail, filet, Mac and Cheese, and sangria.  The shrimp cocktail was not served like the classic dish.  It was presented on slate with carefully placed complimentary cocktail sauce.  The filet was cooked perfectly.  It had a nicely season crust on the outside which was a wonderful surprise.  The sangria was refreshing.  The Mac and Cheese was good but not great.  For brunch I had the yogurt and granola parfait.  Holy Cow!  It was huge and you did not need the honey that comes with it.  Eating it was pure heaven. They have bottomless mimosas and huge pitchers of Bloody Mary's too! The hash browns were awesome!  They were not shredded but small potatoes that were first seasoned and cooked in the oven, smashed to split them open, and then finished off in the deep fryer!  I've never had hash browns that were so good. Hexx was fabulous!  I highly recommend it.  Double bonus!!!  You have a perfect view of the fountain show at the Bellagio as well.

Went in for brunch and was not impressed by the food. I got the HEXX Benedict, without bacon, and I would not recommend it for those looking for a traditional Benedict fan. Instead of poached eggs on top of an English muffin, they are served over scalloped potatoes; making the overall texture of the dish soft. I ordered an extra side of toast to add some crunch to the texture and was happy I did. The rest of my party was content with their food, but not impressed with their dishes. 

Aside from the average food, the attentiveness if the servers is great. Also, it was my friend's birthday and they brought out complimentary cake pops which was very thoughtful of them.

It came in like a cracker pie crust looking thing (but was not sweet). It tied everything together really well. We both got the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. With this we shared a side (which was plenty) and the broccoli was crispy and tasty. The service was also great.,I_HWuQR6EkqXbkHtoQEVmA,0,0,5,9_MhqLNhwC4LWcw0KFdPcw
1503491,2017-10-01,11,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"After visiting for happy hour, dessert, and brunch, I can confidently say that the food at Hexx is better than it needs to be for a Strip location with patio seating and an attached dessert/gift shop. Apparently the chef from Due Forni (a local gem) recently took over the kitchen and is responsible for many of the improvements.

For HH (20% off apps plus drink discounts), the Surf & Turf sliders and Flatbread Carpaccio were both solid flavor-wise but neither was quite what we expected. Menu makes no mention of the barbecue component of the short rib-lobster pairing but it somehow worked. Shout out to the amazing housemade kettle chips on the side. The flatbread flavors needed the mustard sauce to harmonize and seemed to be closer to a tartare than a carpaccio, but it got devoured, too.

 Brunch featured a swath of dishes from all over the menu, with the Prime Rib French Dip falling flat while others like the Hexx Benedict (featuring a base made of scalloped potatoes!), Chicken & Waffles (elevated by housemade pickles and bourbon-maple syrup),  and Carrot Cake Pancakes (a well-balanced sweet and savory combo) stood out as reasons to come back. The Twisted Sticky Bun was a little too sweet and a little too doughy for my personal preference but makes a great share dish, particularly if you don't opt for other sweets. 

Dessert is really where they shine, though! The S'Mores Semifreddo is a creative presentation  that combines all the classic flavors with an emphasis on the toasted marshmallow. The safe-sounding Peanut Butter Cheesecake also gets you a photogenic treat with spun sugar and candied peanuts, and tasted both super creamy and nicely nutty. 

Service varied on my visits, from our super-friendly brunch host to an absent-when-needed bartender. Reservation and seating policies seem inconsistent, with one hostess militantly insisting she couldn't seat my party til all were present while another graciously rushed us to our table five minutes after appointment time regardless that one guy was still stuck in the parking garage. Luckily the great food made up for the lackluster introduction for others in our group who had no previous experience here... but it should still be addressed.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,26,18,4,p3vHOiGLF4EWDh44Uh4HBQ

Breakfast is easy, but that doesn't mean it's always good.
For some reason, finding good breakfast places on the strip (aside from buffets) is pretty difficult. Perhaps it's because people aren't typically awake in time?...
This was one of five places we found we wanted to try, and ended up being one of three places we actually enjoyed.
The service was great; our server was personable and easy-going, not too loud or pushy. He checked in frequently to ensure we were enjoying our meals.
I ordered the banana bread French toast, and let me just say that it is THE most delicious French toast I have ever had. The toast had the consistency of banana bread, but wasn't as dry. The flavors were SPECTACULAR. Caramel drizzle...and fresh berries! Wow, seriously the best.
My one issue with it was my own fault...I added the syrup they provided in a small bowl, and it definitely became inedible towards the end because of how sweet it was.
Whatever you do, don't use the syrup on this dish! It's perfect and sweet enough without it.",m3VudXLzVbgMw1BWy7q4Ug,2,1,5,MCjoS4zn1imBFH_O-Z4K0Q

We ordered the filet mignon (w/ peppercorn sauce), halibut, and two sides (the cauliflower and mashed potatoes). Everything was PERFECT!! It was all SO fresh and light and I would have put away two more servings if I could have (happily stuffed with the more than sufficient portion sizes). I'm still even dreaming about that cauliflower and the SAUCE... mmMM! So of course, after reading my rant over the divine food, you might be wondering to yourself ""then why four stars?"" WELL! Unfortunately, the front of the restaurant needs to get their shit together. With a reservation for two, we waited 25 minutes for indoor seating after being told 5 minutes by the hostess. One small party of three had been waiting 45 minutes (YES. 4. 5.) for indoor seating after ALSO being told the wait time was 5 minutes. When we were finally seated, we looked around the restaurant and it was half empty. It didn't make sense that they could not seat the small groups that were waiting. It was kind of frustrating actually, and the four hostesses appeared apathetic and fresh out of fucks. Just pushing everyone to the side and saying ""it will be 5 minutes"" and collecting us all for like 20-40 instead. WHO KNOWS! But seriously, despite the shit customer service at the hostess stand, the overall experience was worth it because of the food and serving staff (shout-out to Teddy who was an absolute hero of the night and HILARIOUS). Serving staff and the food made it AT LEAST four star worthy. So if you can get over the four 18 year old girls at the front who forget how to count or whatever was the issue, you won't be disappointed!! Make this a must stop, but don't take any shit from those girls at the front. SAY SOMETHING IF YOU'VE BEEN WAITIN They will forget you.

The setting is nice and open. Perfect for summer. They keep it cool or if you want to sit outside they have a good amount of misters.
Service is excellent. They're very attentive. Every time you use a utensil they immediately bring a new one. I thought this was interesting because I haven't seen that anywhere else! I always have to ask lol
For an appetizer we had spinach dip, a meat and cheese deli type plate, and shrimp cocktail. The only one worth mentioning is the spinach dip. Very delicious and I loved that it was served with bread AND chips.
For the main dish I had short rib which is one of their signature items. It is served with mash potatoes and brussel sprouts. The short rib itself was delicious, however the dish was ruined by the horse radish mashed potatoes. The other member of my family who ordered the same dish had a similar hate for those. The horseradish completely ruined the taste of perfectly good mashed potatoes and it was inedible for everyone at the table. If only they put garlic or something else, because the taste was so overbearing . Other members of the group ordered different steaks which were all cooked to their liking . The only complaint was that you had to pay for a side dish. Otherwise you just get a steak with a tiny topping of peppers or some other small assortment. But definitely two bites at most. Not enough for a side dish and not enough to fill anybody up.
For dessert we had a brownie sundae, cookie sundae, and some sort of flan. The flan was overly soft and couldn't be picked up by a fork. It was pretty liquidy. The brownie was very rich but not very good. The only good part was the ice cream with toffee in it. The cookie sundae was hug but I was disappointed to find that the taste and texture were more like a muffin than a cookie. I kept retasting it to see what was so weird about it,you but I didn't enjoy it. None of the desserts we tried were worth it.

The service was the best part of this place. The food, at $20 for a sandwich/salad/burger, was below average. By a large margin. I should have known to pass Hexx up by the fact that from the street I could see that most of the tables were empty. 

My fianc√©e had the panzenella salad. Lots of ""white"" lettuce, head lettuce, barely any avocado, barely any other good stuff at all. Her comment of ""my salad in the airport was so much better!"" Summed it up perfectly. 

I had the turkey club. A big sandwich, but the ingredients were not great, the fries we worse than McDonalds, and it just wasn't a $20 sandwich. I'm not opposed to the prices, but I'm from Chicago. I know good food. I'll pay $20 for a turkey club in Chi and it will be a memorable experience. The only thing memorable about Hexx is how sub par it was.

As for the food, i honestly thought it would've been great if it wasn't for the kilo of salt they dumped into every dish.

This was literally the saltiest meal of my life i'm not joking and i live off of sugar and salt ok
For dessert we got the tiramisu, which comes ""deconstructed"" meaning that the cake is plain by itself in the center, the cream / cocoa shit comes on the sides surrounding the cake, and the waiter pours the tiramisu alcohol mixture on top of the cake. I think the concept was interesting but the ingredients ratio was off, like there was too little cake to soak up the alcohol mixture + other ingredients.

Friends that share - care! This is why I like to dine with this group.  We decided to share several menu items, Carrot Cake Pancakes, Hexx Benedict and Chilaquiles.  The Hexx Benedict was definitely the star of the show.  Instead of being on an english muffin, a layer of scalloped potatoes are nestled beneath the canadian bacon, poached eggs and hollandaise.  Several spears of asparagus top off the lovely dish.  

The Carrot Cake was no slouch either.  The spicy batter comes out in full flavor with the dollop of cream cheese frosting. It's generously fill with walnuts to complete the ingredients.  With all of that sweetness you really don't need to add the syrup.  

The Chilaquiles lacked comparing to the other two previously mentioned items.  It was good but not great.  This is dish is good for sharing since you can just grab a few chips with toppings.

My son had the 14oz Rib-Eye which was just as enjoyable as mine! They were served with grilled asparagus, the only way to eat it in my opinion! 
    Dessert was so fun! We were treated to an ice-cream cone tasting Extravaganza!  We had 8 different flavors, my favorite was the pistachio!  Not to be let down by the Chef, we were toured in the Chocolate Factory, and learned quite a bit about Chocolate, where it is grown, and how they prepare it! We also had the opportunity to try each of the chocolates they offer as well.  How Amazing this night was! They should be a must on any trip to Vegas!",CNEPJXHEpXHwMt4T4uoDFg,0,0,5,y1N7NA-wffYhX_FWfVcuAw

The restaurant is modern, trendy, and decorated in light colors with green and brown accents. Very ""California"" beach vibe. There are both patio and indoor seating so you can overlook the Bellagio Fountains. There are misters all around the patio to keep you cool as well. 

The menu has a nice selection of American food. For our appetizer we had the calamari in buffalo sauce and ranch, a twist on the typical calamari dish. We also had a large crab cake with chili aioli. For our entrees I had the filet with mashed potatoes and my grandma had the veal with mushroom risotto. Both were fantastic. The portions are very large here as well. 

The absolute best part of my night was the dessert!! I cannot rave enough about the hazelnut chocolate pudding. OMG SO GOOD. Our server, Denise was very kind, friendly, and checked on us multiple times throughout the meal.

The service was good but there was very little flexibility on making some minor changes to the menu items such as the type of cheese and side item with the Hexx Burger.  The hamburger was mediocre even with the overrated and overpriced white chocolate bun.  Other dishes such as the spinach artichoke dip and chicken & waffles were average - nothing out of the ordinary.  

The main complaint I have with Hexx (other than being over-priced and offering mediocre food) is the surprise CNF (Concession & Franchise Fee) that is tacked onto your bill and leaves you no choice but to pay at the conclusion of your meal.  I have since learned that a few other Strip restaurants charge this concession fee and it's far worse than a resort fee because you get nothing whatsoever for it.  It's just a money grab fee tacked onto your bill that is kept by the restaurant owners and ranges from 3-5%.

My recommendation is to find out if the establishment imposes this fee before you are seated and if so, exit the premises.  Hexx does in fact charge this fee and as a result, I will not return.",vGPgEs2y7rgKM-plXjAahQ,0,0,2,X4FT9uJyXeQ6glWNCYLLPg

Right away it is split between the candy/ice cram shoppe and the restaurant. I just ate a good sized lunch so I thought of treating myself to a sweet something. The candy area resembles any other candy place here in Vegas, with a mixture of Mickey Mouse, Hello Kitty and Star Wars items like purses, glasses, cups, wallets, etc. i steer my way to the ice cream bar where they also service roof beer floats, teas and coffees drinks. This is where my disappointment begins...
I ordered a scoop of Horchata ice cream in a waffle cone and an ice hibiscus iced tea cooler. First my order was wrong and the gentleman gave me black ice tea from Peet's.  First the ice cream was ok...good but not like ""WOW"" and pricey over $6/scoop with tax. Now to the ice tea...the cashier noticed it was the wrong tea and I was given a simple ice black tea. He asked the other gentleman to re-do the kind of iced tea I wanted and how to do it. So, not only the taste was very bitter unsweetened, but not enough ice for an typical ice tea in 106 degree weather. I had to add 4 packets for Splenda to get thru finishing my drink and trying not to feel I wasted my money...which I eventually felt anyways. 
Honestly, the iced passion tea at Starbucks would've been more satisfying than here. I paid for the name really, and probably won't go back. Sorry!",e4A5Pp94-y8W5MqdSoydxA,1,2,2,UWl0m0zO9XHtHuEOkfRpsw

Well I read reviews on Yelp, and I originally only saw two stars. I was worried but I gave it a shot. Unfortunately, to my dismay , the Yelp reviews were rather accurate. I ordered the margarita pizza, and it was just horrible! I had to return it to get a plain Cesar salad, only because I was scared to try anything else. 

My boyfriend ordered the short rib dish. You would think that this would be amazing. We have tried this dish on various occasions at different restaurants, being that it's on of my boyfriends favorites! Unfortunately this location did not nail the dish.  it was possibly the horse radish that was included in the Brussels sprouts that turned him away from giving this dish any good review. 

My son probably ordered the most normal and decent dish. The hamburger. Plain and simple and you cannot mess it up right ? Yet , my 6 year old didn't really pick on the fries .

Last disappointment ? CNF fee added at the end of your receipt. Other yelpers have discussed this in their review. And it's true folks ! It exists and it's annoying !  never again will I come back here.",mvblRRqWuObPPL-WYlRUCA,1,1,1,4NQvcbcMaO8kFx8cZwiCWw

We saw the Lionel Richie show and needed some dessert and drinks after.  We were immediately seated and given dessert menus.  Our server, a young man with light hair (can't remember his name) was phenomenal with recommendations and putting up with all the questions from a group of 8.  Wow do they have a variety of desserts and drinks.  After much contemplation I settled on the chocolate cake and couldn't have been happier.  It was unlike any cake I've ever had.  So light and airy and not in a tall slice form.  This cake looked like spun cotton spread out with cinnamon cream cheese frosting and chocolate ganache on the side.  Sprinkled over the top was toasted almonds.  The carrot cake and banana cream pie also got 2 thumbs up from the group.

1747054,2016-06-07,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"We wanted to celebrate a special occasion with my daughter and her family. And we wanted to try a place that none of us had eaten previously. Hexx Kitchen for brunch on a pleasant June morning seemed to fit the bill.
Ambiance: We got a table on the patio with a good view of the Bellagio fountains and for people watching. A good start for the meal. They did have misters going to help with the heat but they were spraying out so it did little to cool down those of us sitting on the patio.
Service: Our server came by a few minutes after we sat down. She was very warm and welcoming. She then disappeared for about 10 minutes. No problem - we needed time to work out menu options. When she returned, she took our order and disappeared again. No problem - family time and we liked the chance to talk. The food runners eventually did bring our food, but getting water or coffee refills required tripping a busboy for another table to get attention. Yes, the servers are spread thin. And working hard. But that shouldn't be my problem. And not an excuse for poor service. They should have more servers working Sunday brunch. 
Food: My wife and I shared the brioche French toast and the meat omelet. Each was brought out room temperature. The French toast was about the same quality you can get at IHOP or Denny's. That's not a serious criticism about the flavor - eat on the Strip and you pay Strip prices for a meal. The omelet was tasty, not great but good. It came with potatoes that probably were good when they were hot. Being generous, I could see giving the food a 3 star rating.
Value: Eating on a patio on the Strip should be worth something, even if the food and service are disappointing. But the final ""straw"" for me was on the bill. They added a 4% surcharge item labeled ""cnf."" When I asked about it, I was told it is an added fee because the restaurant has to pay the hotel for the location attached to the Paris. GIVE ME A BREAK! Charge more for the food on the menu if you need to cover your overhead. But don't slip it in on the bill and hope that no one notices.

We started the meal off with a fruit plate which was not your ordinary fruit plate, it had all kinds of interesting flavors like Dragon Fruit and Japanese Apple. We also ordered sides of the aged bacon, also a delicious choice. The protein omelette with avocado mousse was delicious and the breakfast potato's were some of the best I have ever had in my life! The ham and cheese croissant with an egg was a popular choice, we saw it on a guests table and two members of our group decided that that was what they had to have. They said it did not disappoint.

Literally didn't speak to us until taking our plates away when she asked, ""was everything okay?"". Don't get me wrong, she was really sweet when she did talk to us, but really poor service on her part.

We said inside was fine.  They pointed us to the bar area.  We could sit anywhere and hang out.  They had nifty little private alcoves.  The restaurant is beautiful.  

The menus are not grammatically correct.  Normally neither am I!  I went up to the bar to get a drink.  I asked for the Desert Smash without rosemary agave and asked if I could get it with regular agave.  Pretty sure I asked nicely, but the bartender bit my head off and told me it wasn't rosemary agave.  It was rosemary AND agave in the drink.  Oh okay - the menu was missing a comma.  Maybe they were really understaffed.  Maybe she was having a bad day.  Maybe she has to answer queries about rosemary agave all day everyday... She never warmed up to me.  Maybe my Vegas hair was too big for her liking.

We did eventually get a table after a long wait.  Outside.  The interior remained empty.  It is very nice on the patio and we were fine to be outside.  The food was very tasty, though it too took a long time to arrive.

The oddest thing, other than the grumpy bartender, was we were close to a POS station with glassware.  A few waiter/waitress were taking care of business and a glass fell and shattered by an occupied table.  The wait staff just finished up their business before checking on the affected patrons.

We waited 45 minutes for our food, and judging by the ice cold steak placed in front of me, our food waited for quite a while too. My eggs, ordered over medium, were basically raw. My tablemate's diablo Bloody Mary was just horrible, although the other bloody Mary's we ordered were decent. To top off the already mediocre experience, we were seated in the rain and had to move to a new table ourselves after asking the waitstaff to move us several times.

*Hostess stand is located at the entrance facing the strip..if you enter in through Paris, you'll have to walk through the dining area to reach the stand.

Wait: ~25 minutes without a reservation around noon.. they ask for your phone number & will text when your table is ready

Ordered: Pork Rinds with lime Vinaigrette,Corned beef hash, Steak & Eggs, Meat Omelete

Wait for food: Pork rinds came out shortly after ordering (served cold) & just as we were finishing up..our waiter stated that our entrees would be ready shortly after

The food: Pork Rinds with lime Vinaigrette- portioned for sharing with the table, vinaigrette paired perfectly with the pork rinds
Corned beef hash- smaller portion than expected, I helped my table finish the rest of their food. Poached Egg was overcooked.
Steak & Eggs-Prime rib eye steak was chewier than preferred. Presentation was poor
Meat Omelete--filled with plenty of small meat bits, egg itself was overcooked. Presentation was sloppy

Service: Good. Servers were friendly,attentive, and checked in regularly throughout our meal. Small snafu--server removed our appetizer plates and utensils before our mains arrived and did not replace the utensils. We sat for a couple minutes (eager to eat) but without utensils.

Ambiance: The main dining room gets pretty loud. Considering the number of bachelor/bachelorette groups & unlimited mimosas..I believe it's to be expected.

Overall: Decent casual brunch experience--could be improved by greater attention to food portion and presentation.",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,0,0,3,0zt_5sg3kKtx-nr8v-vhxA

The fries held up very well even though they were topped off with gravy, pulled pork, cheese curds and cheddar cheese! 
For my entree I ordered the corned beef hash. It really was not what I expected. Its made with grated sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. It was good but what disappointed me was that it was missing the crispiness that I expect with corned beef hash. I did however enjoy  the poached egg, great touch!  
I tried a bite of my friends entrees also. I really liked the Johnny cakes great texture. I would not recommend the chilaquiles, they are pretty much nachos. The tortilla chips do not hold up well at all. The majority of them were very soggy.

For less than their $19 price, my hubby has had way better. The spinach dip tasted so bad he didn't want another bite. Once you're seated and get bumped by other patrons and your server trips over your chair 2-3 times, you realize the layout is way too crowded- like management didn't account for being at full capacity when they placed the chairs.  In fact, my work blazer ended up on the floor twice after the woman seated back-to-back with me stood up and bumped it off my chair as she kept squeezing in & out of her seat (she was a very slim woman btw).

Perhaps we're being a bit unfair since we had dinner yesterday at one of Ramsay's restaurants, but we're not likely going to be back. Too many other better choices. 
The broccolini starter was so pungent and the florets so overly dried out that after one bite we asked that it be removed.  The waiter removed it from our table but not the bill. Disappointing. 
My wife had the scampi. The sauce was thin and lacked flavor. She's had scampi at many fine restaurants and knows her stuff. I tried it and thought exactly the same. 
I decided to go safe after the broccolini incident and went with the classic burger. I asked for it prepared medium. It was medium well but still juicy. The cheddar they chose has good flavor but is extra dry so is not a good melting cheese. This dry texture on a juicy burger may not be for all. 
My burger came with simple French fries. They looked good but we're quite soft. 
Overall the atmosphere is quite good, it's modern but touches remind you this is at the Paris hotel. The service was fine. It's located directly across from the Bellagio so the view is good. 
Is this restaurant the Paris Hotel's answer to the Bellagio Cafe since both are open 24 hours?  It only wins if you care less about food and more about a patio with a view.",nNdHp-6LMrbznaRKqNC8hw,0,0,2,uVw1G6bYpFFrN8COY9uFXg

There was a terrace with heaters but it was too cold to sit outside in Dec.

Food: my friend and I ordered a bunch of appetizers to share instead of a main meal- tapas style. 
White bean hummus (3/5) was served a little chilled with pieces of naan like bread-it complimented well with the roasted cauliflower (3/5) that had curry styled spices; the baked spinach dip (3/5) was really nice that came with bagel chips; macaroni and cheese (2/5) a white cheddar based Mac -it lacked salt, but was perfectly cooked; lobster creamed corn (5/5) was by far my most favourite dish- the spice level was perfect with a generous amount of lobster. 

For dessert : cake and shake (5/5) this dessert was so pretty! cream cheese mouse with a chocolate milkshake that comes in a cute souvenir mixer. I couldn't finish it- because I was so stuffed. My friend had a vegan based chocolate pudding that she enjoyed.

The fries came out quickly and my brother said they were really good. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The gravy was hot and toasty and the curd were stringy. The ranch is defiantly made in house and vey creamy but it's a little more sour than your average ranch, sour cream based. 

The scampi was very good, the sauce wasn't too thick and very buttery. The chili was a nice note. And bread was my favorite part soft and buttery nicely toasted. 

The chicken and waffles my brother said it was juicy, the breeding could have been a little crispier, the pickles/onion slaw were really good and the waffle was crisp and pretty standard Belgium waffle, real maple syrup. The bite all together was quite delicious.

Definitely a place to try on the strip.",0e5VpxLQfWOFLzQtHvMkGg,5,2,4,LQjMxrsYe6eNM8LHCqNzzQ

I love the high tables and tall windows with all the natural light shining in and the overall modern/upscale feel. Wouldn't expect it to be as reasonably priced as it is compared to other Vegas restaurants. 

Food: When I came for dinner there was a little hiccup where the server never put in my order and then when my steak finally came out it was overcooked, so I had to send it back and wait some more. The key manager on duty was a little off putting when I was explaining the situation, but the server was very apologetic and everything was fixed right away and the steak was delicious I would definitely order it again. Mac and cheese wasn't that great so I'd probably get a different side. For brunch I got the Carbonara Pizza, with the crispy bacon and cheesy fontina, I almost ate the whole thing it was so yummy!

Drinks: HEXX's bubbling potions are fun to share and get you where you need to be, if ya know what I mean. They are pretty pricey but hey you're in Vegas enjoy yourself!

2048398,2017-01-06,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Came here with a group of 12 people and despite some minor errors, I had an enjoyable dinner experience here. The interior of the restaurant was very pretty spacious, with patio seating available outside if you want a view of the strip. It would've been nice for brunch but since it was too cold, my group opted to sit inside. 

We wanted to try some drinks so we ordered 2 HEXX potions, the Jungle Juice and the Kinky Fruit. Obviously 2 wasn't enough for 12 people but all we wanted was to try a little bit so we didn't mind. I personally didn't like the Jungle Juice because it had Malibu in it (yuck) but my friends seemed to enjoy it. They are overpriced but I think it's cute and fun to watch the dry ice do its work. 

For food, my friend and I ordered the smothered fries and jambalaya. The smothered fries was basically a plate of fries covered in BBQ gravy, cheese curds, and pulled pork. I didn't taste any BBQ in the gravy but I actually didn't mind it. They gave a generous amount of pulled pork, so much that we didn't have enough fries to go with it. The dish was super heavy and filling but I would still recommend since who doesn't like fries, right??

The jambalaya was definitely ON FIRE. I'm usually disappointed at many restaurants' versions of ""spicy"" jambalaya because they're never actually spicy but HEXX got it right. The dish was pretty spicy and they gave SO MUCH SHRIMP! Ugh it was so good...I would definitely get this dish again if I were to come back. 

I got to try some of my friends' bucatini carbonara and tomato & burrata. The tomato & burrata was very light and refreshing, a nice contrast to our heavy dishes. I really liked how the sourdough toast was perfectly crunchy! The bucatini carbonara was very creamy and again, the restaurant gave a very generous amount of bacon! Unfortunately, my friend found a piece of plastic wrapper (?) in the dish so the restaurant had to make us another one. What I thought was unfair was that the restaurant took the original dish (which my friend ordered with chicken and garlic bread) and when they brought back a new one, there was no chicken or garlic bread. Like um, excuse me? My friend didn't mind but if that had happened to me, I definitely would've said something. 

Overall, my experience at HEXX was enjoyable. However, because of the carbonara incident, I would have to give a solid 3.5 stars. Service was good though and at the end, our waitress even split our bill for us 6 ways for our convenience.

2052915,2016-08-14,2,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"We decided to do a nice dinner on our last night in Vegas at Hexx. I was browsing the groupon deals earlier in the day and I had seen a deal for Hexx. The menu looked pretty good so when it was closer to dinner time, I bought the groupon and we decided to check it out.

It was about 9pm and we were able to sit outside on the patio overlooking the fountains which was nice. Soon after seating the waiter took our drink order and I asked about how I go about applying the groupon. He then told me just to show him my phone when we get our bill. Okay. No problem. But then he goes on to tell me it has to be more than 4 hours since buying the groupon. Well I had maybe bought it about 1-2 hours prior to dinner.  It wasn't a new groupon that had rolled out that same day or anything. I read all the fine print prior to purchasing any groupon out of habit and nowhere does it read that it must be 4 hours before I can use it. I conveyed this information to the waiter who then proceeds to tell me ""Oh, I'm SURE it's on there."" So at this point I'm a little frustrated/annoyed. I reread the fine print. I was then told it wasn't their policy but groupon's policy. So I was thinking ""hmm that's weird"" because earlier in the day we purchased the groupon for the Eiffel Tower experience literally 5 min before walking up without issues. And when I read groupon faq's, all it reads is ""most Groupons can be used right after purchase, up until the expiration date, but may not be combined with other specials or promos"". Again, I was told this 4 hour clause had to be on the site. We'd been walking around all day. We were hungry. So not wanting to wait the 3 hours more, we decided to leave.

I figure since the waiter wasn't very empathetic and guaranteed I had somehow misread the fine print, that I would ask the lady at the door. She told me they had apparently just had a meeting on groupons and this is the information that they had been told but that she would ask a manager for us. To make this part short, the manager came out (who was definitely more understanding) and scanned our groupon and it amazingly worked within maybe an hour and a half of being purchased... Lol. All that trouble? 

We were seated back at the same table. It was shift change and we had a super nice waitress (wish I could remember her name). We ordered and everything went pretty smoothly from there on out. We had the spinach and artichoke dip which was about average. I had the shrimp scampi which was pretty good. They were more generous with their shrimp than I was expecting. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and ate everything on his plate so I'm assuming he enjoyed his food. His plate was also a decent portion size. He originally ordered the jambalaya and although it was good it was way too spicy for him to eat comfortably. I did feel the food was a little overpriced for the quality but it IS Vegas. 

I am glad we had a groupon though. But, I guess I wouldn't have been so put off by the initial service if I didn't have a groupon.

We choose the outside patio, as it quieter and quite lovely. The waiter greeted us and they offered three types of water: Pellegrino, Fiji, and tap. One of the reasons we choose the patio is because you can see the fountains of Bellagio show beautiful entertainment while you wait for your meal. 

We ordered the shrimp scampi, spaghetti with meatballs and the chicken parmesan! Everyone enjoyed the food with some white wine as well. They also have a very large selection of wines which was really nice!

I must say that you do have to wait for your food, so don't be in a rush (the fountain show makes the time go by a lot quicker).

My scampi was very good, the sauce wasn't too thick and very buttery. They are also really generous with the shrimp! And the bread was my favorite part soft and buttery nicely toasted. 

Definitely, a place to try on the strip!",c-vVymgze-8GxvX739tclg,3,2,5,LPmVI3YpWzjFb-5ipChzfA

We ordered the Colossal Bloody Mary to split between 4 girls. It was huge and came with a king crab leg, shrimp, bacon, and pepper skewer. 

The food was average and good enough to combat a hangover. The one shining star to the meal was the pecan sticky bun! OMG order this if nothing else because it was so so good. Everyone in the group order an omelette, which came with an english muffin and side of potatoes. The potatoes were tasty; potatoes roasted and topped with parm. I didn't care much for the meat omelette since there was just too many random meats in it, like the pork wasn't very good and especially not mixed in with chicken and bacon.

Atmosphere was cute with an open dining room and doors that open into the patio area so the space feels very large. Decor was light, neutral palette and reminds me of a Santa Monica vibe.",cwNhokfrvEItsjYl-d57vQ,0,1,3,zGzp4mA3EnpHfCTtQNc_ow

Bottomless mimosas were $23 and there was a good selection of brunch items from sweet and savory items such as French toast to benedicts and omelettes. I opted for the veggie omelet. It has spinach, mushrooms, and peppers. There was a good amount of veggies cooked with the egg; however, I wish my omelette was more hot and not room temperature. The side dish of home potatoes was tasty and the seasoning was light. I also tried the Gravlax benedict, and the salmon was fresh. The muffin was not too heavy and they offered strawberry jam on the side which was also fresh.

We were very impressed with how quickly our order came out and the service was good. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. If you request bottled water, a Fiji water bottle comes out with no cap.

We ordered mimosas, two basic salads and and the artichoke dip. It took over an hour just for us to get those items. The salad was a joke. It was costly and not worth it. If you want a salad, just go buy some from the grocery store and prepare it at home because it will probably have more flavor. 
The spinach and artichoke dip was okay. I'm saying that it was okay because we were starving...so anything at that point was going to suffice.

When I called the manager and show her the bacon inside the omelette, she said she's sorry about the misunderstanding , it's not an answer to me. So me and my husband just left the restaurant upset and disappointed!!! We never come back to this place or recommend to our friends!!!",mZMgSg9bTMGvjpU4l4jocw,0,0,1,YrMkffBUuB1jDLc6-XVP3w

He listened to what I wanted and described a delicious drink which tastes just as great.

I know this is Vegas, but we can't blame this one on alcohol as neither of us drank last night, nor did we eat anything else after we left the restaurant.  She's got all the signs of food poisoning.  Which really sucks because we're in town to attend a conference that we paid for out of our pockets, and now she's missed a full day of sessions.  We're praying that she'll feel better tomorrow.  So far the best she can do is small sips of Gatorade.  She ordered a pasta dish, I think it was one of the house specials.  I'm pretty sure one of the listed ingredients might have been egg yolk.  Looking back now, that seems odd - why list egg yolk unless it is raw - in which case - what the heck?  She thinks she remembers seeing that too but, at the time, not giving it much thought. 

The location is amazing (right across from the Bellagio fountain).  As far as my dinner - it was okay.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip - which is one of the best I've ever had.  For my main course I had the fillet which was cooked exactly as I ordered (medium), but a bit dry and lacking any flavor other than when the pepper it was dusted with before cooking happened to touch my tongue.  There was a very small dollop of 'steak sauce' on the plate, I suppose it's there incase the pepper didn't work.  I tasted the sauce - nothing to rave about and I'd prefer something better than homemade A-1.

This space used to be occupied by the Sugar Factory... and I was really hoping to eat there.  It wasn't until we made the trek up from the Mandalay that I realized Sugar Factory was gone.

Another small positive note - Hexx just opened, literally.  I think last Friday (Feb 27th) was it's first night.  So the place was still fairly empty at 7:30 pm on a Monday night.  

Might be empty because it's so new, or might be empty because my friend isn't the only one to have spent the next day puking up her dinner.

I visit Vegas a lot - and I'll keep an eye on their Yelp reviews to see if this was a one-time fluke.

Bottom line - should you go here?  If you want a great view of the fountain and fabulous spinach dip - give it a shot.  Just stay far away from anything else on the menu that might get you sick if it's not cooked/prepared properly.  Good luck!",54hwndQM3aW-oH5k0J2gGA,8,0,1,aRxlEIXni_iMxCjbFD-6ow

It also lists 14 oz ribeye, but menu price is now higher than promotion value.  After discussion, we got the ribeye, but it was the smallest 14 oz steak I've ever had - more like 10 ounce.  Way over cooked - ordered med rare and it was grey all the way through.  Venetian cheesecake was mediocre.  We get better cheesecake at Outback.  Not worth the money, even with the promotion.",TLy3uQiDmsD0wONwngsleQ,1,0,2,zUR3-ph1Jj2UtFmfx3xdtQ

The drinks which were previously made of candy are now made of fruit, which is always a great thing. They still smoke and make both kids and adults smile and snap. 

Im in b/w a 3-3.5 for this place and kind of wish yelp had a half point system so i can increase my rating by half a point. 
We came here for dinner and lunch. Dinner was definetly a better experience than lunch. The dinner and lunch menu are similar except some slight differences. 

For dinner, we got the spinach and artichoke dip as appetizer and shared the shrimp scampi for entree. The dip was quite tasty and came with chips and pita chips. The dip tasted much better with chips to we stuck to them but if you are extra hungry, the appetizer is quite filling. 
The shrimp scampi was delish and we cleaned the plate away.

For lunch, me and a friend ordered the chicken and waffles (hugee dish btw) and another friend ordered the cheeseburger. Both entrees were ok. The chicken was definetly the star of our dish and was a huge portion. Easily shareable between two people and a third could also take some bites. Only thing i didnt like was that i dont tend to like a huge portion of fried chicken just being dumped on my waffle - thus making it soggy. I also like plain maple syrup and theirs had a strong cinnamony kick to it so if you are like me, order the plain one.",e5buRsXHw-xzVCh6j6D_yg,1,1,3,nZPmY7yQkL2hmfNfwnbmhA

We came here very early shortly after opening for a breakfast. We were still on East Coast time and decided to get some food and avoid the crowds.

Service was attentive and friendly. 

We were sat on the balcony in a still cool breezy morning. 

I ordered the eggs benedict and my husband had the cinnamon bun waffles. The food was perfect, I was completely in love with my benedict, perfectly cooked eggs with ham and asparagus ontop of gorgeous scalloped potato. Probably the best benedict I've had in a very long time. My husband was over the moon with his breakfast as well since it came with an actual mountain of cream cheese icing.

The problem we get into is the other visits. On my recommendation family went later on in the day and had a much less enjoyable experience.

A day or so later we stopped by in the evening on a whim to grab a few drinks and same deal.

It seems that the second they get busy, all bets are off. They recieved cold food, and the night with drinks we had an incredibly long wait for ordered drinks, so long we couldn't justify getting more than one. 

So all in all, it's a good enough place but they really struggle when it comes to dealing with a full house. Unfortunately, where they're situated on the strip, they will ALWAYS have a full house during peak times.

If you can go crazy early like I did, you'll have a great time, otherwise maybe choose somewhere else!",RxtaZlcS4vLgDAw1C3ZRAA,0,0,3,Gd4I8sCtoQxTJEhV1-rg-w

At first impression, Hexx is a beautiful place to have brunch-- you walk in, and you just feel the classy-boozy-brunch ambience. That feeling of, ""Hey, let's get a morning cocktail to nurse this slight Vegas hangover.""

The staff is incredibly attentive, accommodating (had to move to another table to accommodate my ankle injury), and personable. Our waitress was super funny, and our host was very sweet. But the food-- meh. I'd say that if you're getting something sweet, go for it. But their actual meals were just dry and tasteless. 

We ordered a mocha to start. Delicious. It was smooth, foamy, and not too rich. And then I got a bit too excited and ordered one of their dry-ice smoking cocktails -- the Elixir (most definitely did not give me life). It tasted and looked like an AMF. The worst is that I low-key was annoyed that this particular cocktail was recommended to me by the staff and now no one at the table wanted to drink it lol. There goes $36.

I'd have to say that the highlight of the meal was the Cinnaroll Waffle. The decadent cream cheese and cinnamon flavoring was amazing. I expected the chicken and waffles to be as great too, but it came out to be kinda dry and tasteless. So was my protein omelet-- the chicken was cardboard. And the corned beef hash? Not enough potatoes. And the salad? As DJ Esco would say, ""Too Much SAUCEEEE.""

We were lured in with the promise of a build-your-own ice cream sandwich, but before we could partake in that very serious business we were sidetracked by a chocolate tasting. That's right, we sat down at a bar and sampled several bits of chocolate and real hot coccoa for free! Each bit was better than the last, and when I announced my favorite, they hit me with a sample of that kind of chocolate made into hot chocolate. It was awesome. Moreover, we watched the staff hand pick coccoa beans for quality control while we ate all that chocolate.

We made an ice cream sandwich made out of (1) peanut butter and Reese Pieces cookie, (1) snicker doodle cookie and stracciatella ice cream. It seemed to make sense at the time and it certainly satisfied.

Excellent food, Friendly & Smiling hostess and wait staff, coupled with their Perfect location... HEXX is my new and must go to dinner spot in Vegas!

I've always walked along the strip and found HEXX to be perfectly located... their patio seating (with fan or heater) is the picture perfect spot for your Vegas visits.  

We had a reservation at 5:30 (wanted to arrive earlier to grab their patio seating).  Upon arrival, the smiling and friendly hostess greeted us right away.  We hoped for and got the perfect patio seating -- overlooking the strip and right across from the Bellagio fountain, where we enjoyed the fountain show every 30-mins while we dined.  Thumbs up!!!

HEXX has the best wait staff!  They don't miss a beat.  They are fast, friendly, knowledgeable and flexible.  We were offered water right away.  Then the waitress came over to greet and check on us -- and made some dinner recommendations.

We opted for the following:
* Purple Haze -- one of their signature drinks.  Very good with the fog ... unique drink 
* Prime Rib (my fav!) -- cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was flavorful and tasty.  Prime rib was fresh and a true 16oz!
* Rib Eye -- also cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned.  
* Brussel Sprouts -- sides.  So good!  For those of you who don't like your veges.. you will be hooked!  ;)
* Pumpkin creme br√ªl√©e -- recommendation by waitress and she is spot on.  Excellent creme br√ªl√©e and not too sweet.  I often don't like dessert where they use sugar to mask all taste..  but this creme br√ªl√©e is not like that.  You can really taste the pumpkin and it's really good.  Highly recommended.

Then they brought us a free pitcher of a different flavored steaming cocktail because it was my birthday!!! Loved that!! The manager also came to our table twice to ensure that our meal was good and wished me a happy birthday which I thought was very nice. 

All of the food we had was delicious but j must say the dessert and the cocktails were the best part. We got the mocha espresso flourless chocolate cake and a chocolate ice cream sundae and both were phenomenal! 

From the outdoor seating area you can see the bellagio fountain show across the street which is a must see when in Vegas! I thought the prices were very reasonable for the location.

After being seated, it took us 20 minutes to be asked for our drink order and then another 30 minutes to receive our drinks. It was not even a complicated order, simply 4 beers, two glasses of wine and a couple of vodka tonics. The place was far from packed and the bar just had two people sat at it, so to have to wait nearly an hour for drinks was completely horrendous. In addition to that, one of our party ordered a steak cooked rare and it turned up medium well done. When he spoke to the waiter, he then removed just the steak, leaving the rest of the meal and returned 15 minutes later with it cooked properly. Meaning the rest of the meal was cold by the time his steak turned up! To top things off, they did not comp the steak until we complained to the manager. The rest of the food was actually pretty decent when it turned up, but at that point our night was ruined. My tip is for you not to go here, unless you don't intend on doing anything else that night.",_JjBRV8pTAMV-tp6hebfEw,1,0,1,SWTA7QrCHQ6OYq0qxWz14A

The food was amazing. I had a veggie burger with fries. The burger was excellent. The veggie patty and avocado which came with it was too good (absolutely no words to describe). 

My husband however didn't like what he ordered. He ordered for a veggie omelette and looks like they had made the omelette using a cheap version of some oil or they probably used the non-veg oil to make it. It was horrible that he threw away most of it. However the mashed potatoes he got along with it was tasty!

2458455,2016-11-03,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Review is for dinner 10/30/16

I had promised to take my wife to a 'nice dinner' before a show at PH next door, we slipped in here after browsing the menu posted outside.

We were quickly seated inside, since it was starting to cool off and windy.  The indoor dining room is lovely, the chairs super comfy.  The server was right there, took our drink orders (just soft drinks).  Nothing on the menu indicated how much they were, was a taken aback to see they charge $4.99 for a coke.

Anyway, before you quit reading,  I want to point out something I didnt see in any review:

""CNF""

What is that?  After I questioned it, the waitress told me its a Concession/Franchise fee.  An additional 4.7% of your bill tacked on at the end.  Surveying the menu again, I spotted it, sure enough in very small print at the bottom they state this.  I hope this isnt another monstrous Vegas trend, like 6/5 blackjack, resort fees, or parking fees.  Anyway, just make sure you dont TIP on the TAX nor the CNF.

We were a little short on time, so we both ordered entrees, no appetizers or sides.  Wife ordered Tagliatelle Scampi (shrimp, butter, garlic, wine, parsley, chili in fettuccine noodles) and i ordered 8oz Filet Mignon with roasted asparagus) - medium rare.

Soooooo, out comes the food - now, I ask you, how many pieces of asparagus would you expect? 6 (standard serving)? 8?  How about 3.  Yes, 3.  I know this is an a la carte restaurant,  but if you say it comes with asparagus, I expect a whole serving.  And sadly, for $37, they cant get a piece of Filet Mignon cooked right, its on the done side of medium.  I dont have time to wait for a refire, so I ate anyway, and didnt complain.  I was given every opportunity, but didnt.

The Scampi were fairly small shrimp, i'd guess in the 51-60 range, cooked about right.  But the sauce seemed bland, neither of us detected a hint of garlic.  The 'chile' were shaved pieces used as garnish on top, we both thought pretty inedible.  I wouldve salted this up a bit, but like any haughty restaurant, you wont find salt/pepper at your table.

High prices, a somewhat hidden tack on fee, bland scampi, didnt get the steak right, i'm left at 2 stars.  If we had ordered a full meal and 'real drinks'  we wouldve easily been over $61 each, so its $$$$.",BRGnIsVAClYJ8nNZWSZPMg,2,0,2,r7T6TP_D6PJ3NpBdWSrB6A

It was a large bib/butter lettuce drizzled with oil and white balsamic which in and of itself was mmmm, but then sprinkled with blue cheese, chocolate nibs and onions.  Just a super interesting and great tasting item.  We also had the jambalaya, which was great. 

I had the gin slush drink which was unique and also great.

They also do bottomless mimosas for $20 a person. It felt pricey with four of us but they were poured well and we definitely got our money's worth. We also shared one of their really cool potion drinks that have dry ice to give a smoking effect. I could of skipped the drink. It's cool, but it's a whopping $38 per drink. 

The foods was hands down amazing. We enjoyed each bite and the table unanimously agreed the Hexx Benedict was the best dish. It's served over potatoes for a unique twist, and the layers of flavor shines through. I kept taking bites as my fianc√© ate his waffle. Ha! I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles. Perfectly cooked chicken that wasn't heavily breaded and a light, fluffy waffle. The protein combo looked good and was a nice balance to the heavy appetizers.

While at the bar we ordered a ""Farmers market"" bloody Mary and a morango cairpirinha (each$16). The farmers market bloody Mary was extremely tasty and comes highly recommended. However, the caipirinha should only be ordered if you enjoy cachaca and a very strong drink; we did not find it particularly enjoyable as it was not very well muddled.

When we finally did get a table, we ordered one order of bottomless mimosas  ($23)as well as the ""Hexx Benedict"" ($16) ""and the ""Hexx Burger"" ($18). The bottomless mimosas go until 2 pm Monday to Sunday.

The Hexx Benedict were rather bland and under seasoned, although well cooked. The hollandaise was also perfectly done, although also bland. The portion size was small for the price, especially compared to the Hexx burger. We requested the Hexx burger medium rare, and found it to be cooked exactly to order as well as perfectly seasoned. Overall, we would reorder to the Hexx burger over the Hexx benedict, both for taste and portion size.

As far as the atmosphere, this is a great place to have brunch. You have a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit outside. The music selection was electric; a  mix of 90's and 00's pop hits and throwbacks from the 80's. The music sound volume wasn't overly distracting and provided a nice background and atmosphere.

He said it was a concession fee, a charge for the privilege of sitting outside on the patio. WTF?? I immediately told him to take it off. I wasn't going to pay it. Now, it wasn't the $8.00. I had just spent $197.00 on steak, fish and many drinks. It was principle. He immediately removed it.

2563715,2017-09-17,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Oh em gee. The food here is ridiculously delicious.

I was skeptical because I'm always super skeptical about those fancy, shmancy restaurants that serve small portions but charge ridiculous amounts. I had a slight impression that this was going to be one of those restaurants but BOY WAS I WRONG. 

I came here on a Friday dinner date night and was seated immediately for two. Right away we were greeted by super friendly servers who were nice, offered recommendations and treated us like royalty! We were already soo impressed! 

Located at the front of ""Paris"" right under the Eiffel Tower, its beautifully decorated with a clean, classy, upscale vibe. The menu was just as beautifully crafted as the ambience of the restaurant. They have different options from seafood, gourmet meats, pizzas, etc! 

We ended up ordering the ""Big-Eye Poke"" Appetizer and omg, it was easily one of the TOP poke's I've had in my entire life. The fish was SO fresh and seasoning was on point. There were crispy onions/leeks and macadamia nut pieces on top which added and amazing texture to the soft poke fish. Not too salty, not too fishy, just freaking delicious. Me & my bf were literally eating it super slowly to savor every delicious bite. 

For entrees, I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon which was SO unbelievably good; crispy on the outside & fluffy & moist on the inside. (BRB salivating while writing this review) They really do cook the salmon PERFECTLY. The salmon is served on top of a ""quinoa"" mixture with black quinoa (YES, BLACK quinoa.. don't worry its freaking wayyy better than it sounds), wild mushrooms, peas, and a lemon-ey gremolatta sauce. This thing was just as crazy delicious as the salmon, so together it was just an explosion of flavors in your mouth. I don't think my body was ready for such deliciousness. 

We also ordered the Pan Seared Scallops which was another explosssion of deliciousness. Words cannot express how delicious this food was, friends. My explanations really don't do it any justice. Scallops were light, buttery, fluffy, perfectly crispy yet soft. Came on top of a deliciously creamy puree & various cooked veggies. SO GOOOOOD. 

Surprisingly, we were pretty full from all the food even though we expected not to be. Maybe because our mouths were trying to recover from such outrageously delicious flavors. This place is now a new DEFINITE must to go-to in Vegas!! This place is open 24/7 so there are no excuses not to try it out!

By the way, sorry for saying delicious like a billion times. :D",qnecQjnwloIDVMmg6dmE8w,5,2,5,MPyp-hJlElSvjQyEIAnITw

2600204,2017-10-14,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"This place was EXCELLENT! While I was craving comfort food and went straight for their pepperoni pizza, my dinner mates each ordered steaks. For appetizers, we had the meat and cheese platter and the spinach and artichoke dip (one of my favorite appetizers, so I get it almost everywhere... This place gets first prize. It was incredible). Three of us split two sides, the creamed corn and the mac n cheese, and it was enough for all of us to go with our well-portioned meals.

Their motto is something like ""simple food done right"", and I truly can't agree with that statement more. Everything I tried from here was top notch and hands down one of the best things I'd ever tried, but nothing was over complicated.

For dessert, none of us could decide which one we wanted the most... so we each got two. Overall at our table we had the orange bar, the peanut butter cheesecake, the panna cotta, the s'mores, the champagne shaved ice, and the passion fruit mousse. Each one was delicious in its own way (and the dessert portions were small enough to merit two desserts each). My favorite ended up being the passion fruit mousse. 

My only gripe was the server. I'm not sure if this is a restaurant-wide policy or if it was just our server who did this, but any time we would ask about an item on the menu (""Are the sides large enough to share? How is the Waygu beef aged?"") She would answer our question and then list off her favorites from that section of the menu (even though we never asked for suggestions)... And because we had questions about each major section, I could walk in there right now and order an entire meal for her from start to finish. She was very nice, but that kind of information wasn't asked for, nor was it relevant to anything we did ask.",CDPGu6t4l-6ScsbTMDg_-A,0,0,5,dqTIw-jfW2vOhCPp-cjgRw

2608663,2018-03-14,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"HEXX was the first Vegas foodie destination that my friend and I experienced on this trip. I made a reservation a couple of days in advance for a table for 2 at 10:30 a.m. After reading about how busy this place gets on Sunday, I was glad we did. We entered through the casino and received assistance in locating the hostess who was located near the front main entrance off the strip. The casino entrance looks legit but the official entrance is actually from the exterior. 

This restaurant is HUGE! There are several rooms, each with its own unique feel - some airy and sunlit - others more dim, ensuring a more intimate mood. With a plethora of seating options inside, and a highly sought patio-arrangement, HEXX is Modernly decorated, ultra trendy, and THE hotspot for Sunday brunch. 'Nuff said about the venue itself...on to the rest: The reason you are spending money! 

SERVICE: 4/5 Stars
Our server was friendly and helpful enough, but she managed to disappear for upwards of 15 minutes toward the end of our meal experience. I was desperate for one last mimosa and my friend just wanted to obtain our check - so we had to ask a nearby busser to come to our rescue.

BRUNCH FOOD: 5/5 Stars
YES TO ALL THINGS FOOD. 
We were sold on the Carrot Cake pancakes after seeing the pictures on Yelp. Our Carrot Cake pancakes didn't quite resemble the modelesque photos, as they seemed to be missing some of the topping ingredients...either way, the pancakes were LEGIT. You could literally see the shredded carrots on the bottom of each pancake. Basically if you want dessert for breakfast, this dish is for you. We shared them and could barely finish the plate. 

Steak and Eggs - I ordered my New York Strip medium rare, eggs scrambled. Just do it and don't look back. This dish is also accompanied by yummy skillet potatoes and a fluffy English muffin.

My friend had the Farm Fresh Eggs and she reports that this dish was just what the doctor ordered. She ordered her eggs cooked over-medium and that they were cooked perfectly - a hard task to achieve apparently. And the bacon was perfectly crispy...YES!

BRUNCH BEVERAGES: 3/5
I had better mimosas when I gambled at Planet Hollywood. For $23 per person, you can add bottomless mimosas to your meal, or you can just skip the meal and pay the $23 for unlimited mimosas. They come pre-mixed with O.J.  Meaning, each glass consists mostly of OJ, which you have to guzzle through in order to the next one. 

They do not have any other flavors, but when I inquired about changing up the flavor, our server said she could add Peach Puree for an extra $6.00 and basically give me the bottle to make my own mimosas. I upgraded to the $29 but I never got to make my own mimosas. She brought me a glass of potent peach puree already pre-mixed with champagne. I poured most of it out and ask for a top-off of just champagne. We never had the bottle on our table and we barely got them to approach the table with it.  

If you are looking for awesome food at a trendy Vegas-central location, choose HEXX (but be sure to make a reservation). If you are looking for delicious mimosas and decent food, hit up the Bellagio Buffet. You'll spend a bit more money, but you'll enjoy unlimited food and potentially have 100% access to the champagne (so long as nothing has changed since I was last there in 2013).",5R3m-2idPFpYq0oRwCK0TQ,3,1,4,wB7oTN3kDXD66vShWDTqbA

He ordered his medium (their default) and I ordered mine well done. Both burgers were cooked exact and even my well done version was moist and flavorful.  The white chocolate bun was a nice sweet touch to the salty (but not overly so) burger. The fries were good but nothing to write home about. I didn't care for the sweet and spicy pickles on the side, but my husband enjoyed them. Our daughter ordered the Mac and cheese with bacon bread crumbs, but got Mac and cheese with bread crumbs. It's too bad the bacon was missing because Mac and cheese wasn't good, and at least bacon would somewhat cover up the very bland and gritty (like the roux wasn't cooked properly) dish. Now, our daughter *is* four, but she is the least picky child ever, and regularly tries and eats things most kids won't.  If she doesn't like the Mac and cheese, there's something wrong with it.  I tried it just to make sure and while I wouldn't call it inedible I *would* call it a complete rip-off, considering it's $8. Skip the Mac and cheese. Dessert was fantastic. We ordered the chocolate cheesecake with popcorn on top and it didn't stand a chance.  The chocolate samples with spell cards were cute, but you REALLY have to be a chocolate purist to enjoy the samples. This is the real deal, so don't go here expecting Hershey, or even Godiva. It's a very pure chocolate. Even the milk chocolate tastes like dark chocolate. Service was satisfactory but not exemplary.  We didn't get offered the dessert menu (which is strange considering that's kind of its thing) and had to ask when the check was brought instead. I don't think we were being rushed out, though.

2641390,2017-10-22,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"This has got to be my favorite place on the strip to go and have dinner at. Today was my 4th time visiting this restaurant, and they never disappoint. Every time I've gone, the service has been excellent. We are usually greeted quickly & with smiles. The staff is great & their food/drink recommendations are always on point. The food amazing! The flavors are so well combined, and so flavorful. 

Tonight my friend and I had the Working Husband & the El Ni√±o drinks. Both were highly recommended, and they did not disappoint. The Working Husband was a perfect balance of sweet & spicy, which was just right for me. The El Ni√±o was delicious. If you like Moscow mules then you would enjoy this drink. I was a little skeptical about the ginger beer they use for the mix, but when I actually gave it a taste, it was amazing. 

As far as the inside space, they have plenty of seating. The indoor seating is beautiful. Big open space, with lots of lighting, and looks quite fancy. The outdoor seating also has enough seating. You have the front view of the bellagio fountains. It could get a bit loud when you're seating outdoors, because of all the pedestrian activity and traffic on the strip. I don't mi d it at all though. It's actually quite entertaining, watching all the people passing by. 

As far as food, my friend had the Halibut which was sooooooo delicious. It comes served on top of this amazing risotto. Such a beautiful fusion of flavors. In this risotto you can taste hints of curry, and coconut, and different spices. So well paired, balanced & made to perfection. I had the butter lettuce and I loved it. The Cocoa Nibs took that salad to a whole other level. It was delicious. We also had the spinach dip which was also amazing. The spinach dip comes with these toasted flattened bagel chips for the dip which were so good. And the dip itself full of flavor. We also had the spicy roasted cauliflower, which was super tasty. It was cooked just right, and extra crunch from the toasted almonds kicked it up a knoch. I also had a mushroom risotto which was also very delicious. I'm obsessed with garlic, so the fact that I could actually taste the garlic in this dish, made my night. Now for dessert we had the passion fruit mouse cake which was to die for. This is a must have item on the dessert menu. It's so light and airy yet full of flavor. 

Overall, all I can say is that this place is truly amazing. The chef really knows his stuff. And the staff is excellent. I will continue coming here and referring all my friends to this place!",4kBDBcr6sPe2sPkK7ibgtw,0,1,5,5cIaENX7bgD4ebx2iRoqVA

Had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated. Only 2 small groups were before us! After being seated we counted and only about 12 tables were taken and most of them were party of 2! It took 45 minutes for the food to come and the Mac n cheese was cold. The veggie pizza was hot but bland. The calamari was also hot but fatty and cheap bar snack type. The waiter knew exactly what was going on. He apologized and offered discount from the manager which was appreciated. That is the reason for my 3 stars. Otherwise the food and service was one star. It seemed that the kitchen was low on skilled staff. My party's previous experience was much better.

We didn't even have to ask our waiter about moving, because a manager named Matt approached us and asked us if we would prefer to be moved to a spot that was shaded!

When we were finally called, we were told by a grouchy hostess that only a patio table was available, even though we sat across from multiple empty indoor tables for the duration of our entire meal. Luckily as we were seated on the patio the chilly morning burned off into a gorgeous afternoon. 

We dined under an amazing view of the Bellagio and Caesar's, and the pop of orange from the umbrellas made everything that much cheerier. For our table of four every dish was incredible. Eggs Benedict, Cinnamon Roll waffle (with a mound of cream on top), Margherita Pizza, and Ham and Cheese Croissant Sandwich. We all loved our food and marveled at my husband's cinnamon waffle until his last bite. 

A large rowdy bachelorette party kept our nerves on edge as they would burst out in loud sing alongs to the music- but for a place with bottomless mimosas I guess that's going to happen once in a while! 

Would be 5 stars for the food, interior design, location and beautiful view, just wishing the service was a bit better. Still an awesome experience overall.",tdsQIJTztWWRPbyrsMNI7w,0,0,4,XMx7QCLrGrpfff0XLRcPYg

You can get french dip anywhere else just as good for a lot cheaper price (Arby's or Lion's Choice).  I honestly don't even remember how it tasted.  That's how boring it was. 

Maybe we went at a bad time too. Couple girls were very drunk and loud.

I ordered the Carnitas Hash which has braised pork, salsa, home fries, eggs, and pico de gallo. The dish tasted great - savory, pork cooked right, home fries flavorful - and the portion size was good - definitely big but not overwhelming. 

Drink-wise I got the Yellow Ghost which was a Bloody Mary made with a yellow tomato gazpacho. It looked striking but wasn't very flavorful - they could have spiced it up more with some seasoning. 

Overall, this restaurant has very good brunch food but my cocktail left something to be desired hence the 4 stars.

Protein Omelet was really, really good. It was nice and moist and fluffy. Far from all the omelets we've had in the past. The guacamole was a very nice addition to the dish. Adds a very nice flavor to the whole dish. 
This is one brunch we're not going to forget anytime soon and will reminisce for weeks to come!

2798873,2015-05-05,3,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Great spot for brunch or any meal, for that matter, because of the street level view of the Bellagio fountains. If you want a sweet dish to start your day, the chocolate pancakes are the way to go. It's made up of four thick chocolatey pancakes that are plenty sweet with a cake-like texture. It's essentially like eating chocolate cake for breakfast, but you'll feel a little less guilty because pancakes are a breakfast food, after all. The carrot cake pancakes were slightly better, in my opinion. Fluffy, well spiced and full of bits of carrots, and much lighter than the chocolate pancakes, they can be very sweet as well if you consume the entire mound of cream cheese frosting on top. The brioche French toast is rather pedestrian compared to the other stuff we got, but well executed. The ""overcooked bacon"" was just that, overcooked to make the 1/2 pound of bacon strips exceptionally crispy, with a maple glaze covering them for a touch of sweetness. I can see this place being popular just for the view, but the food is a good enough reason to pay them a visit.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,9,8,4,eyfOyaMxsmzaYFIIMsgFcA

2807779,2017-12-14,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"This is a good restaurant, but why would I go back when only a few steps away I could go to Mon Ami Gabi, which has the same great patio views, similar comfortable ambiance, and even better food, for about the same price?  Well, I suppose it would be because Mon Ami is often full to the gills, while Hexx was half empty.  Other than that, though...

The menu had a little bit of something for everyone (including a pizza or two, which seemed out of place) but only a little bit.  There were items among the eight listed entrees that sounded good, but Hexx seems to be mostly a steak house.

My wife and I started by sharing the Surf & Turf Sliders - a creative idea which was pretty good, but far from astounding.  We then each had a wedge salad, which tasted like a wedge salad - pretty good.  For the entree I decided to try a steak other than my usual favorites (filet or rib eye), so I went with the hanger steak.  Once again, good but not great.  Perhaps that's just because hanger steak is a cheaper cut.  Or perhaps not.  Anyway, most of the flavor came from the B√®arnaise sauce.  A side of creamy mashed potatoes was very good.  My wife thought her Spaghetti Carbonara was excellent but, seriously, isn't that dish sort of excellent by definition (assuming you can afford the calories)?

Our server was pleasant and attentive, but made a significant error in adding up our check.

One last gripe, which is not specific to Hexx.  Both of the big casino chains on the Strip (MGM and Caesar's) seem to insist that their online menus do not include prices.  It's annoying.  So, for reference of Yelpers, the meal described above with two rounds of drinks came in at about $170.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,4,R8ZPa2OkOv4NSpRUhaC4gw

2867207,2015-12-29,2,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"I'm going to give my honest review as a resident of Las Vegas. 

I came here with a few coworker's to have our annual Christmas dinner on a Wednesday afternoon. We all live in Las Vegas, so it took us awhile to find parking to the hotel & casino, and then walk to the establishment. 

We had reservations and we were quickly seated. We decided to sit inside, although they had heaters on the patios outside. We wanted to be warm. 

Service 3/5:
I'm honestly not sure what our server said her name was because she spoke so quickly I really couldn't understand her. I did hear her ask what type of water we would prefer to drink, and there were several options; which was a nice touch! Service could have been better. She was friendly, but spoke way too fast.

Food 2/5
I was so disappointed. I ordered the King Salmon, and I'm not sure why I was expecting it to be king sized. I ate it in 4-5 bites. It was a super small portion but the presentation of the salmon was beautiful. I was going to order the chicken and waffles that my coworker ended up changing her order to, but I didn't. It looked way more filling than my salmon, and it also taste so much better than my food. I should have ordered the chicken and waffles. 

We also ordered two alcoholic potion beverages. The first one was the Jungle Juice potion. It was very delicious, but of course it had low alcohol percentage. When we neared the bottom of our potion drink, we noticed a hair in our dry ice. We were all disgusted, but we work in the food and beverage industry so we know what it's like to have unruly customers. We told our waitress, and a manager came and quickly resolved the issue. Thank you! We also ordered the berry potion (I forgot the name). 

Ambience 5/5
Hexx Kitchen was beautifully decorated and very spacious. The patio was also very beautiful, and every 15 minutes, we were able to watch the Bellagio's water show. 

Overall 2/5
Unfortunately, I felt we could have spent less money on the same portion-sized food. It also took forever to find parking, walk through the hotel and casino, and find this place. It was an alright first time experience, but I more than likely won't be returning.",rW33zAX5Ot3tSAx4uM5KxQ,1,0,2,kZBP2V9twytPwTyx_dWBUA

2915355,2015-04-12,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"I have to begin with the fact that I was never impressed with Sugar Factory (3 stars).  Hearing that Hexx has the same owners I would think it was as good as SF.  Unfortunately I was really disappointed with my visit.  I ordered the soft pretzels, club salad, and a diet soda running me $34 plus tip.  The pretzels were tough on the end, like leather.  Aunt Annie's has better.  The salad which said had turkey must have been turkey broth.  At least the croutons tasted better than the pretzels except there were tons of them.

Price: About $15-20 per dish. Small portions

Corned beef hash $18: I would not order this again. Too much hollandaise sauce and a pip squeak amount of beef. This dish was TINY... probably the size of my palm.

Carrot Cake Pancakes $13: This was pretty good as I am a HUGE carrot cake fan. The pancakes were not as fluffy as I had hoped and came out to be a little dry.

When we asked to eat inside, it seemed an inconvenience but we were accommodated. Customers like choices. Pancakes were really good, came out hot. Our egg plates looked as if they were sitting around, waiting while the pancakes were cooking. We had to ask for extra syrup; one shot glass size syrup is not nearly enough for 4 fluffy pancakes. Even the extra shot glass of syrup wasn't enough but I didn't have the heart to ask for more. I ordered coffee..pretty good but my complaint for the coffee refill is this; the coffee canister hangs off the tub that holds multiple canisters of ice water. The coffee refill was lukewarm at best. Because it was lukewarm, it tasted bitter and wasn't worth finishing the cup. This doesn't make sense to me. The server was pleasant and eager to please. The complimentary chocolates at the end were a nice touch. They promote the connecting dessert store next door and it was a nice tasty treat to finish the meal.

2936079,2016-04-06,18,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Stopped in for some two for one drinks (courtesy of MyVegas Slots) and snacks to check out the place that was once The Sugar Factory Bar. All was good in my opinion and besides decor, an outside patio and a different cocktail menu...there were no other noticeable changes from the last time I stepped into this building.

Ordered some spinach artichoke dip, a Barrel-Aged Chocolate Manhattan and a Mandarin Mule. The dip brought nothing new to the table in terms of flavor from other spinach artichoke dips I've had but was good nonetheless. 

The Barrel-Aged Chocolate Manhattan is where the party was. This cocktail was awesome! The chocolate infused Bourbon was strong and gave a nice aroma of chocolate and a hint of chocolate flavor. I'm not sure what role the sweet Vermouth might have played in this cocktail besides its inclusion of more alcohol. The more the better. This wasn't a drink you'd take back fast and move on. This was to be enjoyed slowly and I most definitely enjoyed it with every sip. The Manderin Mule was the opposite as it was good but a drink I consumed faster. This was on the more tangier and sweet side with a ginger flavor. 

There was hungry friends back at the hotel so we ordered a custom topping pizza to go. A pepperoni, jalapeno and mushroom pizza that was delicious. There was also the Classic burger ordered by a friend who said it was delicious as well. I didn't get to try it for myself but this friend hasn't steered me wrong with good food so I'll take his word for it. 

A pizza and that Manhattan is most definitely on my list to be ordered again at Hexx. I'll be making my way through the cocktail menu for others to try but you better believe the Barrel-Aged Chocolate Manhattan is being ordered right by its side or free if Myvegas Slots Loyalty Points are used again.

Once I placed my order it took a while for the food to get out so I changed my order for takeout. Service was somewhat efficient however not very warm or inviting. The lady ringing me up said she was unable to charge my room as there were too many people with my name and that I did not come up under my room number. Although it was not a terrible inconvenience I found it a bit open to doubt as I made 2 charges to my room within the same hour prior to placing my order with no issue.  The portion size of the Gnocchi Pomodoro was fairly small and the creamed corn seemed more like a liquid with bits of lobster.

As most of these reviews are for brunch I felt compelled to share our experience for dinner here. Hexx could possibly be the best on Las Vegas Blvd restaurants. The views/service/food was simply fantastic. 
We got a great table on the patio where we were met by Kevin. A funny but great server! He was great with suggestions and really made our experience great. We started off with the crab cakes and spinach artichoke dip. The crab cakes were delicious. Very clean and fresh tasting and I love how the sauce that came with it was very light and did not drown out the crab cake.  The spinach artichoke was great too, one of the best I had. 
For dinner, I had the short rib and my lady had the seabass. The short rib came with a delicious mash and Brussel sprouts on the plate. It was fantastic. One of the best things I've ever eaten. The short rib was so soft it was easy to simply flake with a fork. 
My lady's Seabass was phenomenal. It was so unbelievably fresh and clean. The dish itself was so refreshing and delicious. It wasn't fishy at all and was super mild. Seared to perfection and perfectly cooked. 
One of my favorite things parts about Hexx is the chocolate bar. After we had our meal, Kevin walked us over to the chocolate bar where we got to see chocolatiers make chocolate from scratch and got the chance to taste all the chocolates they offer. 
Overall, with the great food, service, and views, this restaurant is the best bang for your buck on the strip. I love the experience of the chocolate factory next door. Finally a restaurant on the strip that offers more than just great food, but a great experience as well. Well done Hexx!

Sides : get the broccolini and the cauliflower. so good.
and deserts -- the peanut buttter cheese cake was rich and delicious. and if you like after dinner cocktails -- the tiramusu deconstructed is really good. but it's very boozy.
I have followed the new executive chef -- from Fiamma at the MGM (when it was good ) to his wine bar Due Forni and now at Hexx. He's really classed up this class.",BdoTZ9o4l3xTUo_iDClElA,0,0,5,YzKM5Hgh0RDy_DxS43ryPQ

She was cursing & using foul language towards the employees ON the floor while guests were within earshot. One of the comments in question went something like this ""If you guys don't seat this side I am going to have a FUCKING panic attack."" as well as this same woman addressing another employee & telling them ""You look like shit,"" again right on the floor as guests were walking by, one of which shot [Allison] a look of disgust before continuing on, passing the restaurant.

I had the Budino which was a massive oval shaped dessert. The chocolate was light and the sweetness was just right. There was also a banana flavored undertone to the chocolate boudino, which was interesting. I appreciated that their chocolate is made from real cacao beans. I also enjoyed the crunchy walnuts topped with caramel. 

The single scoop of banana ice cream was a reprieve from all the chocolate. Without the ice cream cutting through the richness, I would not have been able to finish most of the dessert. If you are not a serious chocolate lover, do not get this. I do not really like chocolate all that much. So after the first few spoonfuls, it stopped tasting wonderful. As I continued to eat, it started to become very heavy in my stomach.

I sampled my friends' French Silk pie and Brown Cow. The pie was topped with massive amounts of whipped cream and was indeed silky. The chocolate was fluffy and sweet. The Brown Cow, which sounds complex, in the end was just a simple chocolate milkshake with root beer.

We started with the Spinach Artichoke dip which I thought was the best I've ever tasted. She thought it was too salty but still good. We both had the wild mushroom Pappardelle for our entree. The server suggested an added protein (chicken or shrimp) and we both added the shrimp. Let me say that it wasn't necessary. The shrimp just added calories and I'd suggest not adding any addition protein to the Pappardelle which was fantastic. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms and sauce were awesome.

Positives:  They have very good drinks and the food is awesome.  I have not tried anything I have not liked on the menu.  But, overpriced at that.  

I have had the short ribs, scallops, veal, fish for entrees all were excellent.
   My favorite was the Veal Milanese!

I have had the Brussel sprouts and loved them the first time, didn't love them the second time, so there were some inconsistencies.

The app of garlic bread was excellent.  Spinach Dip, excellent.

We had the ceviche and that is the only item I likely would not get again

They have a good selection of house-made drinks 

  Negatives:  It is more cumbersome finding the check-in desk, even after eating here 3 times, I always forget, you have to walk thru the restaurant to get to the check-in desk.  The other thing is, last time I was there they seated us relatively close to an open door and it was FREEZING.  Even our waitress had to put in her jacket, which takes away from the enjoyment and the vibe.   They should have at minimum offered to move us, or something.  It was not just obvious to us, even though we did comment on it and asked if the doors could be shut.

Even after getting 45% off from the Travel zoo deal, I ended up still having a bill of $300 for 4 of us.(after tip)  Which means, this meal was a $550 meal for 4 people.   We will only be back IF we get a deal.  It just was not worth $135+ per person. I think it would have maybe been worth $75/pp.",pBhaCEcdbdDv76kMwm8Nng,4,2,4,pKy7_f6Vu4A5LqDmcUJYGQ

That did give us the opportunity to walk around the candy store and they offered us a free sample of chocolate which was divine.
The bottomless mimosas is definitely a deal that you can't pass up - it's not extraordinarily cheap, but it's not unreasonable either.
The service was great - our server was very friendly, helpful and attentive. My mimosa flute was almost never empty! The atmosphere had an open and almost European kind of vibe, but the music was playing very loud and it was hard for us to hear each other when we spoke.
I ordered the chilaquiles on the behest of the server and I'm so glad I listened to her. It was so much food I could barely eat half of it, but it was so tasty. The balance of the different components was perfect. The potato chips were a little soggier than I would have wanted, but I'm sure plenty of people prefer them that way.
At the end of our brunch they brought a birthday cake to the table for our friend who was wearing a birthday crown and boa - we didn't even have to request it, they just provided it and it was not only beautiful but incredibly delicious.
All in, I was originally skeptical about Hexx because it seemed a little too touristy, but I'm so glad that we came here. I was incredibly pleased with my experience!",4HMork_3U4FADO6QokNoDA,3,3,4,4nBijQHHhkt-3lNs2-Ov7Q

It's located inside the Paris, the interior is so cute. You can see them making chocolate next door from the bar/lounge area which I thought was neat. Every time I've been I've sat out on the patio which gives you an amazing view of the bellagio fountains for when they go off. 

My first experience was the best, got some brunch with a close friend and my fianc√©. We got the bottomless mimosas. Blade, our server, was out for blood. I could NOT reach the bottom of my mimosa he kept filling it up even after a sip. I was in heaven, I get very cranky if I reach the bottom of my bottomless mimosa. They also had a yellow ghost bloody on the menu that was made with gazpacho and ghost peppers. BEST BLOODY MARY EVER! The yellow gazpacho  made the best base ever. Toe curling delicious. 

I ordered the carnitas hash and it was amazing. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the egg yolk mixing beautifully with the carnitas and the potatoes. It was absolutely divine. 
We finished eating and just sat around enjoying the beautiful weather out and people watching while still enjoying our endless mimosas. He served us them past 3 pm even though that's when brunch ended. 
It was an absolute blast though, I'm surprised I was able to walk out of the restaurant, we probably had 15 mimosas. 

At the end of the meal the server delivers a plate of dark chocolates with their logo on it, and every chocolate has a spell card. Some are for wealth, some are for fun, some are for wisdom. Either way it's a very cute touch and the chocolate is probably some of the best chocolate I've ever had. 

The second time I went the server wasn't as enthusiastic with the mimosas. Obviously still got my 20 dollars worth but I did reach the bottom of my mimosa. 

I ordered the chive waffle which was really need. They brought me hard boiled eggs, lox, chives, cream cheese, onions and capers I think. It was REALLY really good. My friends ordered the chicken and waffles which were the best chicken and waffles I had ever had.

3270918,2016-01-17,4,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"We had a pretty horrible experience here. If you find yourself here, do NOT order the chocolate manhattan. 

Trying to find a quick bite to eat and escape from the crowds, we approached HEXX from inside of Paris. Looking into the restaurant behind the hostess counter, it appeared dim, quiet, intimate, and a little upscale. 

But then we were escorted to our table. A walk down a hallway and around the corner...and arrived at our table which appeared to be in a completely different restaurant. It was bright. LOUD. Packed. We considered leaving immediately but we had been searching for a spot to eat for a while, so we decided to tough it out. Wrong decision. 

Here are some silly things that happened: 

-- The staff allowed one large table of 20+ people to be disruptive to the entire restaurant, as they did the high-pitched whistle over and over again to get the groups attention, sang Happy Birthday 5+ times, and basically screaming at each other. 
-- It took over 20 minutes for anyone to visit us originally. Basically 10-20 minutes between any server visit. The entire meal took 2 hours when it should have taken 45 minutes, if not less.
-- For some reason, people from the strip kept (accidentally?) entering through a side door that entered into the restaurant. The signage on the door wasn't really clear and no one from the staff was regularly in that area, so people would open the door and stand there with the door open, or open and close it, etc. It was 40 degrees and windy while we were there. The tables right next to that door were literally completely bundled up with hats, gloves, EVERYTHING. We kept our coats on. 
-- One of our food items that was delivered was bad. Really bad. (It was the mac & cheese - how do you screw that up?) It was so bad we each had one tiny bite and didn't touch it again. Server never asked how our food was, and picked up the completely full, nearly untouched dish at the end of the meal without even questioning it. 

Nothing on the menu made sense. There is no theme in the cuisine - it's all over the place. One thing we ordered was the sausage pizza. It was the highlight of our meal but consider that every thing else was terrible. Basically, it was slightly above average in ingredients and flavor. 

The only -and I mean ONLY - saving grace of the meal. I ordered the chocolate manhattan. Now I will drink pretty much any adult beverage no matter how bad it is. But I couldn't choke this down. The server did notice I had barely touched it after about 30 minutes and offered to swap it to their moscow mule for no charge. For this gesture they earn back a star. 

There are so many excellent restaurants nearby -- do not stop here.",MHmKe1NQ1pCpIrbK4XREDw,5,1,2,r6oen-Cu7v8Gbv9ypXnx5g
3273907,2018-06-17,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"There are so many good things and bad things going for Hexx. Let's start with the good. You have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and strip with the outdoor seating. Check-in with yelp and get yourself a free dessert. They limit this 1 per table do that is the bad thing. My friend and I are both yelpers but they wouldn't accommodate both of us checking in on yelp. They have brunch 7 days a week. Nuff said. Bottomless mimosas (til 2 pm) and a colossal Bloody Mary served in a pitcher. 

The service started out pretty good. Besides the fact that  the hostess at the hostess stand stood there instead of helping the other hostess seat people. We waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated even though there were tables clearly open. I'm guessing it's because that don't have enough servers. I ended up ordering the Hexx Benny. Absolutely no regrets on this. My friend ordered the same and also ordered a Bloody Mary. The food came out before the Bloody Mary did. I brought it up to our server because I'm guessing he forgot. The base of the Benny was made with scalloped potatoes. Layered with Canadian bacon, poached eggs, asparagus and hollandaise. Those potatoes stole the show in my opinion. Such a great switch up on your typical eggs benny. As we finish up our meals, I brought up the yelp check in offer and our waiter had to go ask if we could both use it. He comes back and said that they only allow the 1 per table. So I let my friend use hers because I was going to take it to go anyway. When our server came back I said can we have separate checks. He agreed he would bring it out. He brought the dessert, but no checks in site so I brought it up again. He brings out the check and it was 1 check instead of 2. For whatever reason, restaurants in Vegas love bringing 1 check out. So I asked him again and it wasn't until the 3rd time we got separate checks.

Very popular brunch place, especially on the weekends so try to make a reservation beforehand.

Lots of seating available, try to snatch one in the outdoor patio because it has a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.

Hexx Benedict:  Instead of an English muffin, they use scallop potatoes as their base which I thought was a great idea.  Only 1 serving instead of 2 but it was surprisingly filling nonetheless.  I enjoyed their hollandaise sauce.
Farm Fresh Eggs:  Very filling entree with eggs, bacon, home fries, & English muffin.  All good!

The inside was nicely decorated as well but it was beautiful day outside the day we came. 

Although the patio is first come, first served - we made a request for it in our reservation and they were able to easily accommodate us. We ordered the smothered fries for the table to share. They tasted just how you would expect -  fries smothered with gravy and cheese. This dish came out extremely fast which was a good thing for us because we needed something to munch on after a night of drinking. They could have let the cheese melt for longer though because in some sections, the cheese was a coagulated mess. Our table of 4 ordered all three of the omelet options (protein, veggie, and meat). Omelets were all okay - kinda wish we ordered something else but everyone was feeling eggs. The smashed potatoes that were served with the omelets were pretty good and seasoned well.

The ambiance inside was clean and upscale. The staff was very friendly and accommodating when we requested a specific table outside along the strip. Our waiter was chummy and interesting.

The bill for both of those entrees as well as a shrimp appetizer came to about $120 including 20% tip. A fair price for the food and a prime spot sitting outside across from the Bellagio, taking in the view of Vegas while the hustle and bustle moves about below us.

We really wanted to try the smothered fries shared appetizer too but didn't want to get to carb crazy so we ordered the Prime rib sandwich and asked if the fries could be changed to ""smothered fries"". I was expecting some long winded explanation as to why they can't do that.. but the server said it could be done, no problem. She was friendly and on point from the start. We ordered a few drinks while we were waiting for our meal. The place is pretty big but it wasn't too busy.. the food did take a while to come out, but when we were finally served the wait was worth it.

To start, we didn't tell them we were sharing but they separated our meal anyways which was awesome (they even gave us 2 bowls of au jus).. Like I said, on point! The food was delicious. The sandwich was well made. The smothered fries were so so good. Definitely worth a try! And can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu.

-MARYLAND CRAB CAKE: Okay, these were a miss. MEH. Although fried to perfection, the inside was off tasting and the texture a little too mushy for my like. an app that tasted extremely heavy even though it doesn't look it. 

-SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP: Cheesy, creamy, excellently fatty for the chips and the pita was so fresh and warm you wouldn't believe that was possible at this time of night and with the cool weather. It was good, heavy. 

-CHICKEN AND WAFFLES: Great! I love this dish and wanted to check it out and it delivered. Juicy perfectly fried chicken, seasoning on point, saltiness just right, the apple-cheddar waffle was soft inside, slightly crunchy outside, sweet, excellent batter i have to say. The bourbon maple syrup was delicious and just rightly sweet. Must get!

We were seated outside within great view of all the strange folks walking up and down the Vegas Strip.  We ordered chilequiles and a side of broccoli.  Great tasting food and very filling for 2 people.

The bonus was the bottomless mimosas.  These were very good and our waitress kept them coming.

Our server Jessica was super cool and was very nice to us. We wanted to try one of the Hexx Potions since it looked very interesting and asked her to suggest something from that list. She suggested us the Purple Haze and that was absolutely amazing!! The whole experience from the way she poured the drink into the pitcher to the point we tasted it was memorable(See video). We couldn't finish the drink but in Las Vegas, it is okay to carry alcohol in a to-go glass and that is exactly what we did. The Desert Smash from the Speciality Cocktails was nice too.

In the food, we had the Baked Spinach dip with bagel chips. The dip was very creamy and yummy. Bagel chips were something different and were nice and crisp and were a perfect accompaniment to the dip. Gnocchi Pomodoro was for my husband and he enjoyed it with additions of more veggies which cost 2 bucks/serving. I had a Halibut which came alongside tomato risotto, lime coconut broth & herb salad. The risotto and the broth were so yummy that I kept wanting more. The fish was poached beautifully to perfection! Absolutely delicious. To end our dinner which rather turned into a feast at this point, we had a Red Velvet Cake which was such a beautiful sight and super classy. It was just the perfect quantity for two.

As for everything else. We were able to walk in and be seated right away. The meals are reasonably priced when compared to many other places on The Strip. 

As for me, I had the prime rib. It was probably close to an inch thick, tender and juicy. Be sure to make use of the au jus and creamy horse radish dips. It also comes with a side of mashed potatoes.

My girlfriend opted for the flat iron steak (the best butcher cut).  It was delicious and perfectly cooked. Her side of roasted cauliflower really hit the spot. The spicy aoli provided the flair and the spiced almond provided the crunch.",lBNexphtgM7BZUFzvNFXRQ,0,0,5,I_UUJ9Oh1iZ7DDBPwIquRA

Came here on Saturday at 11am for brunch. Portions are small, prices are high, wait is long (30-40 minutes, even with a pointless reservation), service is mediocre, food is absolutely nothing special. 

I had the chilaquiles, which was a mistake. Egg was fried hard (like, what?), no chicken, and the red sauce tasted more like pasta sauce. 

My husband had the eggs Benedict. It was ONE egg on ONE half of an English muffin, basically a half portion. For almost $30. It tasted ok. 

However, it was nice sitting on the patio in the beautiful weather watching people walk the strip and the Bellagio fountains do their thing...None of which is by this restaurant's own doing.

After getting off the monorail and going through Paris, we came out to the Hexx Bar. With our 32 ounce mugs in hand, all we had to do was decide on a flavor of slush.

She filled up the jigger, then kept pouring over that. That means nothing of course, until you take a sip and taste perfection.

I hate it when all you taste is the slushie.

This was not the case. We took a sip and it wasn't too strong and it wasn't too plain. It was nice to get a real drink made. That's pretty much what you get in Las Vegas.

The ceviche was flavorless.

The Brussels sprouts were good but tart.

The mushroom risotto was over down with mushrooms and also flavorless.

Burger was a tiny little patty.

The benedict was a very small portion, and my friend who had it finished his food well before the rest of us, leaving him dissatisfied. What stuck out at HEXX, though, was the service. Our waiter, Sean, who asked us to mention him specifically if we left a review, constantly tried to upsell everything we ordered, persistently trying to persuade us to order more when we'd already declined. He failed to tell us that upgrading the potatoes with ""onions, mushrooms, or peppers"" would cost an additional $2 PER topping. So the $6 upcharge on our bill came as a surprise. Sean also kept referring to Patrick, the person refilling our waters, as his ""assistant,"" which seemed pretty demeaning and self-important, even if it was true. Amidst his constant upselling, Sean also made strange comments that came across as faux-charisma: for instance, we asked for salt and pepper, to which Sean replied ""upon request""... The atmosphere and decor of the place is cute and ""aesthetic-y,"" which I'm normally a big sucker for, but in this case it felt like a pretty face with a bland personality.

First off my friend was previously here for his girlfriends birthday and it happened to be when the Paris hotel had a complete loss of power. So due to that situation the manager informed him that the next time he made a reservation at the restaurant it would be taken care of. So for his birthday he made a reservation and informed the person on the phone that he would be bringing a small group for a dinner and that the manager should be informed since it was going to be taken care of due to the previous incident. The person on the phone confirmed it with the manager and the reservation was set. We came for the reservation and ate our dinner but when the bill came we were all shocked that suddenly the dinner would not be taken care of. They claimed that they never said they would be taking care of the dinner and even went as far as calling security to watch all of us to ensure the bill would be paid. Horrible customer service and very hostile manager. Lied to us about a wonderful dinner to make up for their wrongs. Very disrespectful calling security on us when we were not hostile towards the staff. I would highly recommended you not eat at this establishment. Not worth your time or money.

Definitely more of a brunch dish as opposed to a breakfast. The salsa and chips combo had a kick, and the toppings balanced the dish. Only downside, gotta eat it quickly so the chips don't soggy!
 
Appetizer: Tomato Burrata and Crispy Broccolini
The burrata was very similar to a bruschetta, with a honey reduction. The honey complimented the cheese. The broccolini sounds very odd, and I'm not sure what they do to it, but it's definitely worth a try! It's a very unique flavor and a great new spin on broccoli.

3680314,2018-03-05,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"I went to Hexx with a very large group for brunch one Sunday as our last big hurrah in town. Hexx did a wonderful job seating our party of about 12 as well as keeping us entertained before being seated. Once seated, our waiter introduced himself promptly and we all loved him, he was fun and dynamic. Several of my friends ordered the bottomless mimosas to get the party started. After ordering our food, we had a strange encounter with the kitchen staff... as they were bringing out our food (which was brought individually, not on one of those big platters), the girl carrying the food approached my friend and set his food down very quickly in front of him, knocking over his mimosa and spilling it all over the table and him. At this point, she turned to all of us and scolded us, saying ""You guys are going to have to move your drinks, that whole situation could have been avoided."" She didn't apologize, offer to refill his drink... she was blatantly rude. Mind you this is a busy restaurant, we did not know our food was coming, and he was the first to receive his food, which was our only tip anything was coming. I was LIVID. I was literally shaking and my voice started cracking I was so angry. We all kind of jumped on her and she just got angry and walked away, she was very unprofessional. We told the waiter and he was very understanding and assured us that the restaurant did not stand for that kind of behavior and that she was scheduled for a sit-down meeting with the manager at the end of her shift to discuss her behavior because it was unacceptable (the waiter's term, not mine). After a few minutes, she came back and gave an obviously forced apology and quickly walked away. I did think it was a little strange they did not comp my friend's mimosas or give him a free coffee or anything, especially since he was so nice about the whole ordeal (he kept his cool while we all got mad on his behalf), but it was nice to know that the restaurant did not endorse this behavior.

As for the food... I had ordered a meat omelet and was impressed by the taste. The omelet contained bacon, sausage, pork, chicken, and cheddar cheese... mmm. It also came with a sort of breakfast potatoes and an English muffin. I rather enjoyed my food and everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy theirs as well.

All in all, I appreciated the waiter sticking up for us and telling the manager about the way were treated, but the whole ordeal sticks out in my mind as one of my more frustrating dining experiences. I don't necessarily believe that is indicative of the restaurant as a whole and therefore would not say I will never come back here, but if I do, it will be at someone else's recommendation, not because I truly want to come back.",T88y73qdOSutuvzLlhWtqQ,3,1,2,6aHKJO6EEQQKodNxJmaehw

Here are the highlights:
1. Bottomless Mimosas = because who doesn't love these!?!?! $24 for the bottomless option, and they come by to fill you up often, which was nice. 
2. The Sticky Bun = do yourself a favor and order this. The bun itself is sweet and fluffy, and the cream cheese frosting is decadent and pairs perfectly on top. It's a heavy dish, so plan on sharing.
3. The Chilaquiles = GET THIS! I love me a good chilaquiles, especially after a night out. The chips were the right level of crispiness, and the dish has a nice amount of extras (guac/salsa/sour cream) without being too messy. Also they slice up the jalapenos nice and thin, but they still gave off some heat. I definitely recommend this dish!

The only real issue I had was with the wait. I'm not crazy, I know you're going to wait for a restaurant in Vegas on the weekend, but we were initially told 15 minutes and it took well over half an hour to get us seated... so I just wish they would be more conservative with their estimates, since nobody loves to wait.

Let me start off by saying that we took advantage of the groupon deal to try this restaurant out. 

The food was wonderful and I had no issues with any of the dishes we ordered. They are a bit pricey for what you get but its Vegas so it's expected. 

Our server with the red hair was a gem, super sweet. The only thing that got irritating was how long we waited for everything. It took forever to get the menus, to order, to get the manager to approve our groupon, and to get our check. We got there around 8 and didn't leave until 9:30. 30 minutes was wasted due to waiting around for the check AFTER the manager came to apply our groupon.

The cocktails are pretty pricey, so we skipped those and just got food.

My friend and I split a cinnamon roll waffle and a basic egg breakfast, reasoning that the protein in eggs would offset the sugar bomb that is the waffle. Totally works! ;) my other friend got the Benedict, which is served on a bed of has browns rather than an English muffin.

The wait for food wasn't great, and not was the service (friendly but slow), but when we eventually got the food - OMG! Get something that has the breakfast potatos!

I ate at Hexx Kitchen on a Saturday night (7pm). We had a reservation for a group of 10. Upon showing up right at 7pm, the hostess asked us to wait just a little until our table was ready, even though the restaurant was not full (at least 1/3 of tables were open, including at least 3 which would have accommodated our group size).

After a 15 minute wait, we were seated. Unfortunately no servers came by for yet another 15 minutes - we finally had to flag someone down. By then we were all ready to order both drinks and food. Our drinks took another 20 minutes to come out.
So, here we were with a 7pm reservation were just being served our drinks almost an hour later. We were very frustrated and thankful that we had such good company and a decent view of the Bellagio fountains to distract us from the poor service.
Luckily our food came out shortly after - I was a little underwhelmed by my entree of the Bucatini, and the added chicken was quite dry. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal (many girls ordered the antipasto salad). 
So, the food was ok/good but not amazing, and service pretty terrible. Although, I will note that the server offered to separate the checks for each of us without us even asking, which was very appreciated.",Y2wELbJiGft5MRbRQubVSw,1,0,3,QC93zdAsqm91GZKr9mlFnQ

We had to ask for lemon for our waters 3 times. We finally placed our orders and I was so excited to try to carrot cake pancake which was the ONLY reason why I came here. And I had to order it without walnut since I'm highly allergic. After we placed our order our waitress let us sit for about 10 mins before coming to tell us that they can not omit walnuts. She didn't seem to care. She was more like so yea we can't do that so sucks to be you. What you want to order then? 

Ok first off. It's 2018 A LOT of people are allergic to peanuts and walnuts what restaurant makes their batter PRE MIXED with nuts? Now I am sitting here with nothing because the ONLY reason I came here was for the ""so call amazing service"" and these amazing carrot cake pancakes. Sucks for a majority of American who suffer from a nut allergy cause this restaurant ain't for you. Don't bother coming by cause the servers don't care and won't even try to see if they can make a batch with no nuts. Or head chef you need to think about peoples allergic needs........

UPDATE. So apparently the servers here like to peep at your phone. And she saw me leaving the review and got the manager. Which he saved the day. And he was more then happy to get the pancakes made without walnuts. And I must say the pancakes were AMAZING. I am SO GLAD. They are so delicious and the cream cheese frosting was so light and fluffy. DEFINITELY A MUST TRY

And I'm sorry but I feel bad for all those people who don't use yelp. I hate that in order for a restaurant to understand that people have allergies that you have to do a review on Yelp. That's not the purpose of Yelp. It should never be a means of ""blackmailing"" the restaurant in order for them to provide great customer service. It should be given. Overall after a very rocky start. And the beginning of a 1 star review it sky rocketed to a full 5 star review. I hope this comes as a lesson to the restaurant that customer service should be given. And I hope you can give any other customer even without the power of Yelp to be accommodating.",fp-G2tD50h5F0NngWbxVYA,2,0,5,T5Bb_CJo35Mcv_jGmWxjsA

Weather was blazing hot but they have misters to help. Our waiter was really nice and full of personality. 

We had one of their signature cocktails which comes in a cute jug and presented to you in a spectacular way, as our waiter said ""it's a big production"". I had the Prime Rib medium rare. It was on point with plenty of fatty parts per our liking. We ordered mushrooms to compliment the steak which were delicious and tender. The side dish orders a la carte are big and can totally be shared. 

My man had the salmon on quinoa beans. His dish was also amazing. The salmon was nicely cooked. Both our meals were large in quantity not allowing for dessert space. Pricing wasn't bad. We will definitely be back and highly recommend the place.",vGzhhSPoLDUsxl-51tbJgA,2,1,5,ZsbH7_F8GpEh-dA_8buCBw

3962214,2015-08-14,13,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"NOT COOL - I had a huge allergic reaction from the Roasted Branzino, that did not state it had any PEANUTS in it, the manager (whom I will leave nameless) defended his staff and only gave me a meaningless, pathetic ""sorry"".

Hexx is a very modern restaurant in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, where there's a field of vision outward to the Dancing Fountains at the Bellagio.


THE STAFF -

The menus are quite small and very disposable, so I could see why they would not label their dishes' ingredients.  But who's fault is that to go the cheap route? I insisted the Manager (whom I will leave nameless) to start labeling all ingredients on his menu; but, for him it was not the case, he promised that there were no peanuts, then minutes later he consulted me saying there are only pistachios.  What a liar.

Vanessa, our waitress, was very attentive, sweet, and looked like she actually cared when she saw me choking up and breathing heavily after eating my branzino THAT HAD PEANUTS IN IT - she took off the price to my fish and tomato bisque which was so generous her, but she deserved a bigger tip, so we decided to give her an 80% tip.

THE FOOD - 

Roasted tomato bisque was utter perfection!!! Seriously the best, it gave me a hedonistic sensation of nostalgic feelings.  I loved the consistency of the tomato bisque, and the creativity of the dish.

The Crab Cake was another appetizer we ordered, which had a subtle citrus savor to it but did not overpower the dish itself which takes a lot of work. The garnish on the other hand was a bit over seasoned which is an honest mistake for a 3.5 star restaurant.

The Roasted Branzino, oh lord, what can I say that I haven't already? Well the fish was glistening, cooked to perfection, but once I took a bite of the diced peanuts that were sprinkled on top, it was game over.  I had to take my dish back after choking and heaving, and watch my date enjoy his lovely looking ribeye the rest of the meal.  Total public humiliation and a shame. 

The Ribeye was ordered by my date, whom I was envious the entire time; watching each delectable piece evaporate from his plate to his mouth and the aromas of perfectly seasoned meat infiltrate my nostrils.  It's a bit rude to ask for a taste, but I did - and I was not embarrassed at all! A girl's Gotta eat, i finished 2/3rd's of his rib eye in moments.

I really wanted to love this place, my tomato bisque was astounding, but I can't accept pitiful behavior from a manager who denies accusations when it comes to him, then apologize for his so called ""miscommunication"". My review might not matter in this vast internet world, but I do hope I might save a life or two.",1orfwtwIaqCbLgfs3W1i6Q,15,11,2,rjVjBGmkk_qdOAYKl-XbMA
3967285,2017-05-08,9,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"I was to Hexx once for brunch with friends.  I had a show at Bally's and decided I'd walk over to Paris and have dinner at Hexx before going home.  Although in the 90s, the patio was great and the sun was soon behind the Bellagio.  Eating good food and people watching on the Strip--it doesn't get much better than that.

I opted out of an appetizer to save room for dessert (one must have their priorities in order).  For my dinner, I ordered the Spicy Jambalaya described on the menu like this: Gulf shrimp, chicken confit, andouille sausage, and rice.  The dish was excellent.  It was spicy which is exactly what I like.  There was a large number of shrimp and plenty of andouille sausage.

Then it was time to decide on my dessert.  I ordered the single origin chocolate bread pudding described on the menu as: shaved coconut, Ecuadorian chocolate chunks, brioche, coconut milk, and mango sauce.  It takes a little while for this to be made so just have your coffee or iced tea or whatever and people watch.  The time goes by oh so fast.  The bread pudding is huge.  I was so glad my priorities in the beginning proved correct.  I was expecting it to be more chocolaty than it was.  There were pieces of chocolate in the brioche bread but I expected it to really be chocolate bread pudding.  The mango sauce was perfect and the topping of coconut was very good, too!

Also, the music selection attracted me. The Top 40 mixed with throwbacks soundtrack made it very upbeat and live. 

We went for brunch around 10:30 on a Monday and we were seated immediately on the patio. This place is so damn cute! It's very big so there is plenty of seating and one whole side is pretty much outside. The servers were very nice and attentive. The main reason I wanted to come here was to try the famous HEXX potions. They are similar to the goblets you get at Sugar Factory..very fruity with dry ice in them to add smoke...like a potion! Lol. They are expensive. ($36 for one) It is big enough for two but one person can definitely finish it. The elixir potion is a must try! 

I ordered the french toast and scrambled cheese eggs and my boyfriend had a grilled chicken BLT. Both were DELICIOUS! I want to try every single thing on their menu!

Hexx is located in Paris Hotel and Casino just a few feet to the entrance of the Eiffel Tower. We were led inside by the host then back outside to a table out on the patio where the view was the dancing fountains across at The Bellagio. The weather was a comfortable low 70¬∞'s. 

The menu was small - appetizers, salad, steak choices, pasta and pizza, side items (sold a la carte), chilled seafoods and some entree's. For starters we had complimentary pita bread with dipping oil. Dinner followed and I had the Flat Iron Steak with an a la carte order of mashed potatoes. The steak was tender and juicy... so delicious! We also ordered Pepperoni Pizza and Artichoke Dip appetizer taking our time eating while pleasantly enjoying the fountains across the street at the same time. Although the music was a little faint we could perfectly hear the thunder of the fountains as they danced to a variety of music which came on every 15 minutes. Juan was our server and he did a great job taking care of our table along with another server who made sure our water glasses were never empty . Oh, and I love your accent, Juan... we were well taken care of by this team of servers. There is an attached candy store that we didn't get a chance to visit but we were each given a piece of chocolate after our meals. Teaser. 

Perfect place to people watch too! For a while a couple of gals dressed as Las Vegas showgirls complete with huge feathers stood a few feet away from us. Sadly no one wanted to take a photo with them. They tried.  

Overall, nice and pleasant experience here at Hexx.

Another group sat next to us and within a few mins the waiter came and said ""I will be with you in one minute"". Now that we sat there and didn't even get a drink of water we decided it was time to go.

We weren't in the mood for a full meal as we already had dinner reservations, but really in search of a snack. We walked in and were seated promptly.

Service: Service was rather inattentive for it being so slow - in between lunch and dinner.  It took a while to take our orders and our waters went empty for at least 5 minutes without being refilled.

Food: The Cheese and Charcuterie board was good.  Both the cheese selection and meats were standard with nothing to write home about.  The large pretzel as the bread component was an odd choice but it worked well with the whole grain mustard on the board.

Decor:  The modern farmhouse style was nice and comfortable.  The acoustics made it nice so that we could hold a conversation without having to yell.  Our seats also had a good view of the Bellagio fountains.

4107119,2017-10-01,4,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"I tasted lots of great foods at our table, so I have little doubt that my dining companions will swarm this listing with 4- or even 5-star reviews. Unfortunately, my own entree was lacking.

HEXX Kitchen + Bar is a newer American restaurant that took over the Sugar Factory space. This is a great location, with entrances to the Strip and the floor of Paris Las Vegas.  I accepted an invitation to Saturday brunch, which took place in a busy and loud dining room (which drowned out the 80s-heavy music mix) with lighter colors all over that wouldn't seem out of place in a tropical getaway. Maybe that's some sort of implied appeal toward women (you know, the ""XX""), but our table as well as the rest of the main dining room seemed to have an even mix of genders.

Without further ado, allow me to dissect the problem child, the Prime Rib French Dip ($19). The portion was ample, so no problem there. As expected, I experienced rich flavor between the beef and the au jus. The hoagie roll was capable of soaking up that au jus without being too thick or distracting, so another win.

The first notable concern is that I had at least two gristly bites which most would spit out and call inedible. This suggests that cheap meat may have been used or at least that the meat wasn't trimmed/cleaned completely. I also found the thin-cut fries to be pedestrian and not very fluffy or crispy. They were only barely useful as a vehicle for the ""horseradish cream"" that wasn't very strong, perhaps diluted with ranch or something similar. And seriously, what's up with how runny that sauce is? I already have the loose liquid dip that is supposed to saturate every crevice in my bites, so this second sauce is just going to wash off. Execution and design flaws all around detract from what could've been a great entree.

I ended up sampling various other treats from around the table, some of which I loved. However, I have to give most of the weight of the rating to the food that mostly filled my belly, so even the standouts below weren't enough for me to feel comfortable with giving 4 stars.

Magick Dragon cocktail: pay attention when the server pours the liquid into the pitcher. It instantly activates the bed of dry ice at the bottom, so a clear smoky vapor starts pouring out. This really is a great show, but the cocktail itself doesn't have any sort of tart or gingery notes aside from the sweet, vaguely tropical fruit profile. For that alone, I'd recommend against ordering this drink even if you're trying to find something to share between multiple people. Also, a minor quibble, but I'm pretty sure that the dry ice froze the last fraction of the drink. We had neither time or temperature to deal with that, but it was annoying that we still saw color despite not being able to consume any of it.

Twisted Sticky Bun ($8): huge, chewy yet soft, and non-saccharine version of this breakfast pastry. I loved the cream cheese topping and the crispy pecans. This is best for sharing unless you have a huge sweet tooth.

Chicken and Waffles ($24): Clint B's dish, which I tried a bite of after he offered to share it. Both items were crispy and the chicken was delicious and fork-tender. I didn't really get much of the apple-cheddar character of the waffle in my limited sampling, but it sounds delightful. Price concerns aside, I'd definitely consider ordering it for myself, and it's likely one of the best takes locally on this classic (and considering that Clint prefers another Strip restaurant's rendition, I'm also putting that one on my list).

We were all too full to contemplate dessert, but our server did present to us one small piece of two different, house-made chocolate blends. I can't recall the details, but one had some fruity flavors in it, and both seemed to provide complex bitter notes despite initially tasting like milk chocolates. They mentioned that we could get 15% off chocolates at their store (a separate business listing), and I may have to consider making that visit next time I'm going to Paris Las Vegas, one of the dwindling number of Strip casinos still offering free parking to Nevada residents.

Ultimately, I would consider returning to HEXX Kitchen + Bar, although I'm not in any hurry. I'll welcome invitations, but I'll just have to skip the French Dip and avoid anything else with fries like the plague.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,3,qHdal4RS7cVwR8JUuo0yEw

We made reservations for 1130am and when we arrived we were given a table outside looking over the Bellagio fountains.  The view alone was awesome, sunny day and great for people watching.  We started out by ordering 2 Farmers Markets Bloody Mary's which included bacon infused gin, and garnished with bacon, white cheddar cheese, pepper stuffed olive and beef stick.  The Bloody Mary's alone were like an appetizer themselves!  On top of our Bloody Mary's we also ordered the overcooked bacon which was like ordering extra crispy bacon.  Since there was already bacon in the Bloody Mary's we probably should've went with a different appetizer, but I guess you can never have too much bacon right?  Our entrees arrived shortly after and I went with the lobster roll, while my boyfriend had the frittata.  The plating was cute but to be honest I was surprised how small the portions were, I would say there were a little on the smaller side but I was still full when we were done.  Our server was very attentive along with other employees in the dining rooms making sure our waters were filled, plates were cleared away etc.  The only reason why I took away some stars were for the pricing.  The service was great, ambiance and view was great, but after using an Open Table Dining credit of $50 and after paying CNF fees, balance due was still $51.40 so a total of $101.40 for 2 people before dining credit for brunch.  I guess this is what you expect from dining on the strip, either way, I would still recommend if you are looking for a good Bloody Mary on the strip with a great view.   *CNF fees, not listed anywhere else but apparently is a Concessions and Franchise fee that is included with this restaurant.

They are a short walk from Planet Hollywood and located on the strip just outside of Paris. We didn't get the chance to make reservations, but we had good fortune and they had a table available for our party (which was 11 people!) when we arrived. 

I forgot the exact name of it, but we ordered a jug of berry mimosa (~36) for the table and was able to split a cup for everyone. It was a perfect refreshment to go with our brunch meal! After glancing at the menu for a few minutes, I decided to try the Chilaquiles ($17), which includes: chicken, roasted salsa tortilla chips, two eggs, avocado sour cream, asadero. This was a perfect just yum, it was a perfect brunch item that hit the spots with breakfast essentials such as eggs, protein, and some delicious sauce for flavor. The portion size was filling, my appetite left the restaurant quite content with the meal. I also tried some of my friend's Carrot Cake Pancakes, which was surprisingly pretty damn delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have eaten more! The pancakes were super filling, so you should probably share it with someone or expect to take home leftovers.

HEXX was one of our food highlights this trip. Minus the minor mishap with the bill, everything was excellent. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was friendly. The restaurant's ambience was also high-class, very open, and nicely decorated with light colors. The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountain as well, so the restaurant is located in a neat spot.

4183136,2018-05-01,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Never in my life did I think that I could go out someplace in Vegas and be so disappointed! We showed up to Hexx around 9AM. It was busy on one side, but totally empty on the other. We assumed the other side was a different restaurant. We said we were okay with any table, inside or outside and the hostess said it would take 15 minutes. 30 minutes later we are still waiting for our table with absolutely no update. We finally go up to the hostess to ask if our table was ready and she asks us if we ever got a text message, which we didn't. The hostess apologized and took us to our table. We sat there for about 15 minutes when a server finally came and took our orders. 

We ordered 2 coffees, an egg white omelette, a croissant sandwich, and a yogurt parfait. Our coffees showed up in tiny little cups while everyone else had regular coffee mugs. The server said they were out of big cups and would bring them as soon as they were available. We continued to wait another 30 minutes to get our food! At this point we are hungry and still waiting for bigger coffee cups. I asked the server for bigger cups and he said, ""We don't use those mugs on this side."" We were the only table with small coffee cups. I decided to give up on that. 

I took about two bites of my omelette when I noticed a long brown hair in my food. I wanted to THROW UP!!! At this point I'm hungry, don't have enough coffee, and just pissed off! I called over the waitress and as she was taking the food from me she said, and I quote, ""Eww that f***ing disgusting!"" UMM EXCUSE ME?!?!? This is supposed to be a nice restaurant, not a trash club! Whatever, I order the yogurt parfait because I was disgusted by my food. 

I waited over 45 minutes for them to bring me my food. My friends were DONE with their breakfast at this point. During this time our server dropped a glass of champagne on a guest sitting across from us. She dropped two glasses and broke them and acted like it was the customers fault. I got pissed and went to the manager and asked for the checking letting her know I was clearly done with this trash of a restaurant. 

When we got the check, to my disappointment, she only took off the charge for the omelet! She didn't comp us our meal after everything we had been through, she charged us for the tiny coffees we ordered after we asked for mugs many times. It was disgusting. We paid and left without leaving a tip. 

Honestly, this place is TRASH!! TRASH TRASH TRASH!! With so many nice places in Vegas it is NOT worth even going here. The general restaurant at TI has better service than this junk of a place. I honestly wish I could leave a few bad reviews because people need to know this place is NOT VEGAS QUALITY and they shouldn't waste their time.",jSylXQbStX85D8l1_3WLXg,0,0,1,-_as5U2XxGLmpf4xnGGB_A
4186238,2015-06-23,3,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"HEXX is a newer dining establishment on the strip that's open 24-7 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My first experience was decent, but a few things kept me from making this a four-star review. Here's the dealio...

HEXX is located in the front portion of Paris Hotel and Casino with a wraparound front and side patio that's great for people watching or taking in a view of the breathtaking Bellagio fountains. Since my husband and I were staying at Paris, we entered through the casino where there was a hostess stand, but no hostess. I hate that awkward feeling of wondering if you're meant to wait there or seat yourself. We decided to carry on and planned to ask the first restaurant employee we came across. We walked, and walked, and finally we were standing at the outside entrance on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another hostess stand and three hostesses. Just a suggestion, but you girls might want to spread out a bit to avoid this confusion.

Once we were seated on the patio, we were finally ready to enjoy our lunch. The patio does have table umbrellas and light misting to keep you cool. It felt perfect even though it topped 100 degrees. Then again, I'm a desert lovin' girl. 

The menu had plenty of variety, all at your typical Vegas prices. My turkey sandwich served with fries was $16, but I suppose it was a ""gourmet"" price being that it was served with avocado on cranberry challah bread, right? It was still very tasty though and was a decent portion as well. It's rare that I have food envy over what my husband chooses. It's more often the other way around, but I guess I was off my game because I wanted to switch plates with him during our entire meal. What did he have that looked so appealing, you ask? Chicken and waffles. Not just any chicken and waffles, but chicken breast tenders and an apple cheddar waffle served with bourbon maple syrup. He gave me a bite of his $24 lunch entree after he caught me drooling over it more than once, and it confirmed my suspicion... I should've gotten THAT! 

Our server, though a sweet girl, seemed a bit off. She over-poured my ice tea nearly missing my precious phone, and didn't seem too confident in her answers to the few questions we had.

I'd be willing to give HEXX another shot due to the fact that there are plenty of things on the menu that begged me to try them. Helloooo chocolate pancakes with caramel syrup... I'm talking to you! Give me a better experience next time, and I'll bump it up a star. Until then...",Y_t5q-UsgTwUEnzAQ73u1g,5,6,3,znykXfv2yUXdAp-zrd5Idg

Day 2, we (2 of us) arrived early and asked for a table for 6. ""No problem"" the girl says. ""We'll seat you right away"" she says. Then, instead of seating us so we can order some Bloody Mary's while we wait for the other 4 that are on their way, she says we have to wait till everyone is present. I say they went to Starbucks real quick and she says ""no outside drinks"". WTF? I'm thinking, should we even come here? The rest of my party shows up about 10min later and the girl says ""I can seat you once they finish their coffees"". How ridiculous. She wasn't even polite or courteous about it. She was really quite bitchy! So you've been holding a table for 6 for 15min meanwhile you've inconvenienced me by having me stand in a god damn lobby waiting like punishment for not having all 6 with me right away. Then when they show you make us wait longer because somehow Starbucks is shunned by your establishment. You're kidding me... you could have made a 4 drink profit by sitting us and letting us wait comfortably. Instead we stood and waited and then my friends had to throw away their Starbucks just to be seated to eat.

Stopped here for our first breakfast of our trip in Vegas. I ordered the bottomless mimosas ($24), and split a turkey club with my mom. My stepdad and husband split the Johnny Cakes.

--Turkey Club- this has turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and was on a cranberry challah bread. Overall a great sandwich but not the best I have ever had. I think the bread was the best part. The turkey was low quality you could tell but I still liked it. It also came with fries that were pretty good.

--Johnny Cakes - I tried these and they were pretty good, a little doughy for my liking, but my stepdad said that is how they are supposed to be so maybe I am just not a Johnny Cake fan lol. They reminded me of pancakes made out of cornbread.

I dined in for the Brunch and it was great. Had the bottomless mimosas, which the price wasn't too bad. Our server kept filling us up when we got half way so our drink was never low. I ordered the Cinnamon Apple Pancakes and they were absolutely delicious. No need for syrup. Every bite was heaven. 

However, my wife ordered the Steak and Eggs and she had to return the steak because it was way too salty/over seasoned. But the eggs, biscuit and potatoes were good. 

I would definitely try this place again and I would recommend. The staff was great and the view from the patio seating was nice. They even had heaters outside to ensure their guests were warm to enjoy people watching. Loved it.",F47atsRPw-KHmRVk5exBFw,1,1,5,TI04v6ckxBedXmRepJ4CcA

-:::- VENUE/AMBIANCE  -:::- 

Hexx is 30,000-square-foot restaurant situated conveniently in the heart of the Las Vegas strip at the Paris hotel with a magnificent view of the Bellagio fountains. Lots of spacious indoor, outdoor & bar seating. The bar does feature a row of high-top communal tables. Hexx has a very open, lively, relaxing & comfortable atmosphere that makes one dining experience that much more pleasurable. It is a spot for all occasions and any type of dining too (breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night dining & desserts) for they are open 24 hours!

-:::- SERVICE  -:::- 

Both my lunch visits here has been very enjoyable for the servers were very courteous & personable. They were attentive to our needs. But I wish the hostess could be a bit more inviting & friendlier. The encounter I had with the gal working there, was a little stand-offish (she wasn't rude or anything, but just wasn't so approachable) -- on both separate occasion when I visited. 

-:::-  FOOD / MENU  -:::-

We purchased a Groupon deal and it was great catch! The menu does  lean toward an upscale-ish feel but yet it's approachable. For what we have tried the food served is fresh and came out in a timely manner. I would definitely return for it is a very walk-able destination on the strip & food here is satisfying.

Our experienced started with being ""greeted"" by an unfriendly front desk host.  She wasnt rude but definitely did not put off a welcoming or friendly vibe....  as the host its your job to atleast crack a smile.
I ordered the chicken and waffles... The chicken was a big disappointment.  It had an odd texture and taste and dry in the inside.  It tasted like it was either some pre-breaded cafeteria style chicken or maybe even some generic shake and bake chicken.
I didnt mind the cheddar waffle, i think that worked except some of the bites with the apple gave off an odd apple taste.  I think it was from the apple skin that they may have left on.
I think the chicken and waffles from Grand Lux destroys this and they cost nearly half as much.

FOOD
I ordered the chicken & waffles and omg you really do get what you pay for. Two HUGE pieces of fried chicken placed on top of a fluffy waffles, what more could you ask for???? The breading of the chicken was flavored just right and the chicken itself was juicy and tender. The waffle was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

DRINKS
We ordered 1 Purple Haze drink, which comes in a huge pourable & shareable jar. If we weren't so hungover, each of us would've gotten one. Great drink if you love berries. 

SERVICE
Service was on the fence. Our server was amazing, gracious, and engaging (totally regret not getting her name), but the food & drinks took way too long to come out.

4378251,2018-05-15,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,So it was 2:30am and we wanted something to eat my 19 year old and I. My son wanted to try this place so I said why not. Wow so happy we did. I would definitely go back. This late they have small plates he got the Prime Rib Pierogi and I got the prosciutto flatbread. The pierogi is 4 pierogi's served with a horseradish sauce. The flatbread Had smoked provolone and arugula. I also go the Modern Sangria. Everything was so good my son took the first bit and he just grind and you can tell he was in another place. I let him taste my flatbread and he took a whole slice. It's great size to share. Both were full of flavor. The flatbread was crunchy and that prosciutto and the smoke cheese was perfect together to balance the fat in the prosciutto. Sangria was citrusy and wonderful. I would go again for breakfast.,gbQa6CCtqivfPTuR4qM4hg,0,0,4,PYGMxdYR_V5acTjoW34UeQ

4405449,2015-07-02,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Amazeballs. 5 stars all around. Incredible service, great food, very attentive staff. Went for a birthday dinner and we decided to go balls to the walls an order tons of drinks and a ton of food to split. We started with the Mystic Berries Potion which comes in a pitcher and gets all bubbly (see video). It came highly recommended and it was incredible. We asked for recommendations on an appetizer since we were still deciding on food, and our server Jessica recommended the crab cakes. They were beyond amazing, so we decided to try a couple more apps. We ordered the overcooked bacon and baked cheese. Both were incredible, great flavor fusion and overall very impressive. I think the baked cheese was my favorite of the three.

We finally made some moves towards actually picking dinner items an wanted to get another pitcher of drinks. We ended up with another drink (cant remember the name) and it wasn't as  good as the first drink, but still good none the less. We decided to split the roasted tomato bisque, tagliatelle bolognese and the chicken an waffles. The soup was delicious, lots of great flavor, the pasta was amazing and the chicken and waffles were to die for. They were served with apple butter and burbon maple syrup, which together made for a melt in your mouth combo that made me sad  that i was so full and couldn't finish it. I will definitely be back because we were so full we couldn't even order dessert! 

Portion sizes were perfect, huge and great for sharing. They're open 24/7 so thats a huge plus. I can't say enough about how amazing our service was. Our server made great recommendations and  the staff was always coming by to clear the table and give us new settings an were extremely on top of their game the whole night. 

We had a table on the patio so we had views of the fountains at Bellagio, and the restaurant itself was absolutely beautiful. Well done and a great night!",wEkjn9ssDFKnWeoYHPvygg,4,4,5,Ur9HOxmvYN-reQjo3JSojQ

Service was excellent. The prime rib took the jewel crown here. It cut through like butter, melts in your mouth, perfectly seasoned and salted. Just amazing. Probably the best prime rib I've ever had. We also tried their truffle fries which was fantastic as well. This restaurant is priced very well considering the food!

4469620,2018-06-28,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Honestly I really really wanted to love this place and it did start out great but it slowly went downhill. I probably should have read some of the signs when we first arrived. We went to brunch probably around 9 so we were definitely ahead of the usual brunch crowd yet there was a line out front to see the hostess table. I truly didn't understand why because I saw maybe 8 tables with people. Once I got closer I saw that there were 2 woman at the hostess table and one of them wasn't doing a thing. The one would walk others to their table and this woman would just stand there staring off into space without even acknowledging the next person. It was also strange that everyone before me got seated which was at most 3 tables and I was told it would be a 15 minute wait. Wait for what exactly? I see tons of tables open. 

Of course I went with the eggs benedict for brunch. It's pretty much a no brainer that I order that if it's offered. It was by far one of the best eggs benny's I've ever had. It wasn't served on your traditional English muffin, it was served over scalloped potatoes. They were so cheesy and delicious I was sad when I cleared my plate. Full transparency that dish is the only reason I'm even giving this place a 2 star rating. I had also ordered a Bloody Mary with my meal which didn't come till after my food arrived and after I asked about it. Usually not a huge deal for me but given all the other service issues it was just annoying in this case. 

So why the 1 star rating without the eggs benedict factored into the equation you ask? Because the service continued to go down hill and just disappoint me. Both my friend and I are huge yelpers and we take a lot of time to write reviews, check in, post photos, etc. We both checked in and asked about the free dessert offer. Even though we had already clearly communicated at the start of the meal that we wanted separate checks we were told it was 1 per table. Had I been someone who rarely even goes on yelp I probably wouldn't have cared but I put a lot of hours into yelp. We are the girls that write not just bad but awesome reviews as well. So I think it was pretty stupid to tell us we had to pick who gets a dessert or share. We are the people getting the word out for you. Sure it may not be great in this case but if you ran a better establishment it could have been a free advertisement for you essentially. And to clarify this review is by no means my way of getting back at them for it either. 

By the time I got my dessert we had already asked our waiter for our separate checks 2 times at this point. After the 2nd ask he finally brought a check. One combined check. So we had to ask yet again for a separate check. It was honestly irritating that I even had to ask in the first place. No one should ever assume people are paying together. You should always ask if it's together or separate. I don't care what is more convenient for you. I've worked with food before and I always asked the customer before ringing it up. When the ""separate"" checks arrived it was really just 1 slip with it separated out. So we had to then tell him which card was who's so he could charge our cards correctly.

Honestly no one should have had to deal with the crap we dealt with at this restaurant. While the dish was amazing I don't think I could deal with the service simply to eat it again.",-Y6tXYPYqeVy37-L5p0rMw,1,0,2,6JJsUXJhg8oJANLQRP_KLQ

The service was so-so -- it was very busy when we were there, and I expect it is always busy because of the proximity to the Bellagio fountain.  We had a decent table inside, and the servers were whizzing by us, hurrying to tables with meals as if their marching orders were to turn tables over as quickly as possible. We started with martinis, $16 each and not even close to a full martini glass. Remove the pick and 3 giant olives, and the alcohol level drops significantly. We asked whether they serve bread basket or similar, and server said she could bring garlic bread for a price. I can't remember if it was $3 or $5, but whatever, it was too much. You know how old bread can be really fine crumbly, almost powdery when bitten?  It was that. Two small pieces of room temperature garlic bread served on a small plate that really should have been free. My husband then ordered the Jambalaya for $28, which was very good and a surprisingly large portion (much more than we expected). Beware, it is extremely spicy!  There is no accompaniment, no crackers or bread to tame the spice, unless you order the terrible garlic bread as a side. 

I ordered the Sea Bass with Couscous for $38. It was prepared well, but was a very tiny portion of fish on a very tiny spoonful of couscous. I'm not one to want large dinner portions, but this looked slightly larger than what I would expect as an appetizer dish. 

Our impression of the Hexx is that it is all about making as much money as possible as quickly as possible. People want to watch the Bellagio fountains while dining, and that's the draw. Once inside, patrons are rushed through a very expensive meal so the table can be cleared for the next diners and the next, and so on.",215Kvszp3nklgygWsY8HjA,0,0,3,JhIplKWo1qbFP8YiDfL45A

As we waited for a server to help us out we were being missed due to the area not being in sight. We asked the host/bar a few times for help, but no-one seemed to come and take our order. The server Sean noticed us and how we had not been attended to, he took on our table and turned our experience completely upside down! The food was amazing and our mimosas were always filled, but what made the overall expierence even better, was the service provided by Sean and the help of Patrick. Sean was very welcoming, honest, friendly, and likable. We were in such awe of how great his customer service was, we believed he was too over qualified for the job but he was that good!

Loaded Fries - Start with great Fries (nice crunch on the outside, flavorful and soft on the inside) and topped with cheese curds, gravy and ""BBQ pork"". While the pork was tender and had been pulled, there was nothing BBQ about it - no sauce, seasoning or smoke that I could taste. But that's ok, because the gravy was nicely done. Also, the cheese curds had completely melted and turned into gooey goodness! All in all, we loved this dish!

Blondie Sundae - This was the major fail for me. To start with, as far as I know, a Blondie is meant to have the same thick and chewy texture that a brownie has. This did not. This tasted spongy and fake as if it came from one of those awful just add water box mixes. Second, the menu said that it would be topped with Oreo ice cream. But what arrived was boring vanilla. When I asked about it, the waiter seemed to not know and guessed they must have run out. Fail! 

At this point I am willing to give this place another shot. But I would probably stick to the appetizers and avoid the desserts.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,7,3,yRKFk6ybt2y3byM1_zaEIw

You can really only hear the loudest blasts of water.

In any case, the food here is pretty good! In my group, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip (comes with pita and chips), salads, jambalaya (very spicy), a burger, and I ordered the pappardelle. Good service as well.

The lady behind the reservation computer and the bartender. Everything else was chaos. More than half of the tables were empty yet they claimed a 45 min wait for brunch on a Saturday. We said find and ordered a cocktail to enjoy during our wait. We were actually seated very quickly but in a table in the connecting space between the two outside seating areas that was very windy and cold. We took the table and placed our order but after freezing for a few minutes asked to be moved to one of the empty tables either further in or out but not in the wind tunnel in between. Again we were told nothing was available,. Seriously at this time there was no line and more than half the tables were empty. We let them know to cancel our order and walked out. Clueless would be a complement here. Aside from the nice view of the fountains at Bellagio across the street I can think of no reason to go here.

She said Hexx. 

Now because it was so early in the morning, there weren't many people in there. Sat at the bar so I could watch sports highlights. Bartender was friendly and let me look over the menu at my leisure. I ordered the Hot Mess. A mess of fries, pork, eggs, and gravy. It took a long while before my food appeared. Like a really long time. Or it seemed really long. Because I was famished and tired, I ate some but not even half. It was salty. Told the bartender and he offered to get it remade. But I was too tired to care. Paid my bill and went on my way.

This, hands down, beats any buffet in town.  You'll spend less and will still leave completely stuffed.

I came for Saturday brunch and surprisingly the wait wasn't as bad as I had thought. There's a candy store connected to the restaurant that's fun to check out while you wait. Once they texted us that our table was ready, we sat down inside and had a lovely view of the Paris Paris hotel next store. The interior of this place is super cosy! It's super bright and fresh inside and not over the top ""fancy"". 

Service was a bit slow, but the food was so good that it made up for that! I ended up getting the club sandwich and it hit the spot ! The sandwich itself was huge and it had this almost sweet bread that ended up being the perfect complement to the salty flavours of the sandwich. The fries were also super crispy and good. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and they were to die for!! The eggs were cooked to perfection and tasted heavenly with that smoked salmon. The side of potatoes were also heavenly. Would've loved to have tried the dinner food here as well! The pizza looked amazing! 

Additionally for brunch time, they have bottomless mimosas here for around 20$ if I remember correctly. They were super good, although after 4, the taste was too much. 

All in all, if you're looking for a good brunch/ dinner place with a big variety of different foods and you wanna try something new, give this place a shot!

Ordered the mushroom pizza, which was honestly huge-could have easily been shared, but I was by myself, so what is one to do? Desert was, of course, phenomenal, being that Hexx chocolate shop is right there-I usually say you can't go wrong with chocolate, but that is really true here.

You're basically paying to sit mid-strip at an okay restaurant. The quality of the dishes does not measure up to the prices charged. $36 for a basic cocktail with Malibu and pineapple, LOL. 

I tried some of their $25 burger on a white chocolate bun, it was pretty good but not $25 good. Would have rather had In & Out. Their fries are decent. My son had the margherita pizza, it was pretty good. I also tried their pappardelle  pasta, this is where they failed completely. The noodles were so overcooked that they all stuck together in a gelatinous  blob. Too bad because the sauce and mushrooms were pretty good.

The worst part was the hostess at the Paris entrance was immature and rude. Also, they told us we would have a 15-minute wait and it ended up being 45 minutes. Our waitress was okay but it took a while to get a menu and our drinks.

Customer service: amazing!! From the host to our server they were just perfect! I'm very indecisive so I ask a lot of questions and my server was so kind and patient with me. Love it! 

Food: everything was so delicious! 
Rib eye: melts in your mouth. Reasonably priced. Loved the caramelized onions and little peppers that come with it. Perfectly seasoned! 
Caesar salad: I don't know what they put in the dressing but it's unlike any Caesar salad ive ever had. I'm gonna come back just for this salad!! Thin crispy bacon and crunchy croutons. Awesome! 
Prime burger: made with wagyu beef. Best burger I've ever had! So good!

If it were just the food it self sadly a 3.5 star would be accurate. We got the Cinabon Waffles the Chicken and waffles and hex Egg Benedict. 1out of two satisfied dishes hex Egg Benedict far surpassing the waffles. The Benedict was a delicious surprise where in place of a English muffin as a base there was layers of delicious potato. The chicken and waffles I expected a more moist tasty chicken, not something out of a public school cafeteria kitchen. Honestly it would have been better with mc Donalds chicken nuggets instead of the dried chicken strips that came with it. It was so dry with no taste and a rough texture. The waffle it self was nothing impressive just a normal waffle with cheddar coloring to it. The cinabon waffle was okay, if it weren't for the presentation and light cream cheese frosting, the waffle it self would fell epicly. It certainly did taste like a cinabon but it was rough to chew and swallow as well as had a chewy texture that taste like they microwaved the waffle before serving. The Wait staff and atmosphere are very delightful. I hope you are taking care of the staff because there the only reason why I wouldn't by pass the restaurant for a second chance.",hNA9rr9piR6f53V-i5Z_xg,0,0,4,0W_s5D_ELR-ZmvP8gK96fw

The wife chose this place for breakfast (I wanted to go to Hash House A Go Go) because it has decent reviews. I guess we must have just come at the wrong time. After being seated and very promptly being met by our waitress for our drink order (apple and orange juice), she returned with them, but didn't have enough OJ in the carafe to fill my glass, and said she would return with more after taking our order. After that, we didn't see her again for a while. Our meals were brought by a different person, minus the English muffin we ordered. I ordered a waffle, but was never given any syrup of any sort. The waffle itself was very plain looking, and softer than a waffle of this style should be. We watched countless people (including our waitress who reappeared) walk by helping our surrounding tables, but never once stopping to check on us. We finally had to go get her and request the English muffin, syrup, and orange juice. The wife said her home fries were good, so there was one positive out of this.

One thing to note, the table next to us must have been getting the same service, because they had to stop someone to ask not only where the waitress was, but items they were missing as well. 

I recommend finding another breakfast place if you're in the area. You could probably do much better.",daiJv92aHCklW_laiEE70A,0,0,2,rpshAFdgvDr_1I4oe9vjLg

We asked for a shot after bottomless mimosas were over they told us no. All we did was ask ""why?"" What did we do? We asked why are we being cut off we're not doing anything crazy and they wouldn't give us reasoning. So we got upset and we're like ???? What did we do to upset everyone?

The inside dining area is pretty spacious and can accommodate large parties. Very urban chic - the decor is really sleek and modern. Reservations were easy on opentable and service was friendly and prompt.

Our waiter was personable and made suggestions on appetizers/ main course. We ended up trying the yellow watermelon app - which was interesting - not bad not great - I'd recommend it if you're looking to try new things. It was a refreshing dish, slightly sweet from the watermelon, slightly tangy from the lime juice and the feta cheese. The chili string garnish gave it an interesting herbal kick. Again not my favorite dish of the night but not bad either if you're looking for something new to try.

The tomato soup was delicious - pricey for a small bowl but super good. Creamy consistency but not too heavy. The garlic and basil oil complimented the soup well. Slightly too much basil oil but I spooned some out and it was fine.

For main dishes I tried the tagliatelle bolognese - short rib pasta - portion was good. Flavor was on the lighter side but I guess less salt is healthier lol? The truffle ricotta was delicious and complemented the short rib nicely. The short rib however was under seasoned and could have been more flavorful. Ok dish in my opinion.

The bf got the roasted sea bass - delicious! Just the right amount of seasoning, light but flavorful and grilled perfectly. Slightly crispy on the outside and edges and light/flaky in the center. I didn't care for the couscous drizzled around the fish as the texture was odd but everything else on this dish was great.

I had the brioche french toast with bananas on top, fiance and 2 others had the corned beef hash, a sandwich, an omelet, and one had the gravlax benedict. The corned beef hash is a little on the small side so I suggest you also get the pulled pork fries. Ohhhh yes.

The brioche french toast was a little dry so I drowned my toast with syrup. The corned beef hash was actually really good but I wish there was more of it.

We weren't going to go in until one of the hostesses outside explained that they just opened and that they also had a fishbowl type drink that uses fresh fruit instead of candy. We decided to give it a try and if you don't want to eat you can go directly to the bar. There were some long tables in that area too so we didn't have anywhere to stand or sit when we first went in. There were some tables alongside the glass wall when you first turn in but we didn't know if we could sit there. No one asked or assisted us so we just sat there. Those two tables were not really in the bar's line of sight so no one came to give us a menu or anything. I ended up walking up to the bar to order drinks. I stood there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be helped while the bartenders just passed me by. I finally flagged one of them down (Apparently they won't come to you unless you actually wave at them). I ordered two big fruit martinis (peach raspberry and mango orange). When they were brought to the table we asked for 2 more straws ( we had 4 people). They never brought them so one of my friends had to go back to the bar to get some. 
The mango orange one was really sweet but I enjoyed the peach raspberry. It had a peach sake/soju cocktail flavor. They had a good amount of alcohol in them too. 
Our bartender came to tell us how much it was and didn't give us a check...just an amount. 
This place just opened so hopefully they'll make some changes.",eIQn7RWhvYRji-XNxRbBug,4,0,3,Qo548Hy_RWuW2tdHmfmi3Q

It is a not just a good, but a great value.  You can usually find a discount to Hexx, and so it is always a good value for Las Vegas.  The view also can't be beat!  You can sit outside if you want, but even from the inside you have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains!!  This time we tried the Cheesy Garlic Bread and it was good, but next time I would try something else.  I had the Filet with Creamed Corn, and I seriously think the Creamed Corn at Hexx is the best I have ever had anywhere!!!  I love it!!  I have also had the Ribeye before, and it was also very good.  The Veal Milanese was huge!!  It was also really, really great.  The Smore's dessert was ok.  I have had the Tiramisu there in the past and that is amazing!  They make it right in front of you with a funky contraption!  So go for the Tiramisu and not the Smore's dessert, you will thank me later.

We first made sure that my friend's food allergy (peanuts) could be accommodated (it could) and then we were given coffee and water.  Sadly the coffee was very bitter, it couldn't even be mellowed by with creamer, so when asked if I wanted a refill, I said no. They had no problem replacing the drink with something else at no cost. I adore good service like that. 

With our orders placed, we waited a bit, chatted with our neighbors and finally got to the food. I'd ordered a ham and cheese croissant which came with breakfast potatoes - which were amazing. The croissant was HUGE and stuffed with white cheddar and ham. It was TOO much and luckily they were able to wrap half in foil and I was able to take that for a snack/meal on the plane. 

The Scotsman chose the chocolate banana pancakes and they were smothered in a banana caramel sauce which was to DIE for. Absolutely luscious! He left nothing behind and was a member of the clean plate club.

We stopped here for a late night meal after catching a show. 

The atmosphere is like that of a club with loud club music, but not loud enough you can't have a conversation. The decoration, white and beige, is very modern and appealing.

Service was slow, and the server, while nice enough, want really friendly or welcoming.

The items seemed pricy for their descriptions and I opted to just have a snack, ordering the pretzels. They were good, with a mustard-cheese sauce that went great with them. You get three of them for $6, and they were basic pretzels. My wife had the bolognese, and it was a bit odd-tasting. Not really bad, but unlike any bolognese I've had in the past, in a disappointing way. Uppon requesting parmesan for the bolognese, the server referred us to a small cup of white powder that had been dropped off on our table sometime before without any comment.

My wife was in the mood for an Apple pie and she was pleasantly surprised. My dessert, the mille crepe cake, was just ok. The chocolate and berry sauce were good, but there wasn't enough for the portion.",1sjEMU8RsuMvRSvC2FkU-g,2,0,2,GsiiNiKX61_rS-JkbK62fQ

My friends loved the salad! I had the burger and fries and the burger was good, but the fries were just okay. Atmosphere itself is great. They also have outdoor dining area and on those hot summer days a mist that gently spays you (not good for the hair though) :) I would return here the next time I come to town.",_vbEQU_xD95RZ-7j93z9hA,3,3,4,t6VE4hZ1i7DxB7KNmG0yRg

The Pan Seared Salmon was very nice. It was cooked expertly and the nice lemon vinaigrette complimented it nicely. The mushrooms and peas in it were good, I wasn't wild about black quinoa though.

5012816,2016-02-11,1,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Hexx was next door to our hotel and we decided to try breakfast here one morning we were up early.  As soon as we walked up to the restaurant, I could smell a strong paint/varnish smell.  I noticed they were getting ready to open Beer Park on the roof and it looked like someone was working on the area.  We got a seat inside and I hoped the varnish smell would subside.  I ordered orange juice because I saw it was served in a carafe and assumed it was fresh squeezed.  I should have asked because it tasted like it came from a carton at the grocery store.  Unfortunately, the varnish smell started making me queasy and we left before eating.

We tried Hexx again another evening for dinner, and this time the varnish smell was gone.  We were seated at a table farthest from the windows.  It still had a great view of the Bellagio fountains just across the street.  I ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.  It's served in a mini skillet with tortilla chips and pita bread.  It was creamy and did not disappoint.  It was HOT though, and I burned my tongue - so maybe let it cool a minute before you dig in.  We also ordered one of their signature Hexx potions on the special drink menu that appeared to have smoke or mist coming from it.  We had to ask about it though, because $36 seemed pretty steep.  We learned it was actually a pitcher and not a single serving (you cannot tell from the photo) and we ordered the purple haze pitcher, which was a berry flavored drink.  The server brought out the pitcher and another cup and then proceeded to pour the contents of the cup into the pitcher and it immediately began smoking.  We figured there must be dry ice in the bottom.  We were given two straws and told to go to town!  The drink fizzed for a long time, at least 10 minutes!  It was tasty but not super strong, alcohol-wise.

My bf wasn't very hungry, so I was the only one who ended up ordering an entree.  I chose the Pappardelle, which was described as a pasta with wild mushroom, baby spinach, portabella cream and parmesan.  It was an average pasta dish and not very flavorful.  As a lover of all things pasta, I ate only about half and did not take the rest home.  I wouldn't order it again, either.  We skipped dessert and left once we'd finished our drink.  Service was satisfactory and nothing to complain about.  We did not get any chocolate with our check as another reviewer mentioned!

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and the carbonara pizza. The spinach artichoke dip came with bagel chips which I've never seen before. The dip was delicious but I'm not sure how I felt about the bagel chips. I think I would've preferred just regular tortilla chips instead, but the best thing was by far the dip. Just be careful as it's really hot when it comes out! The carbonara pizza was good as well. I liked the bacon on top and the crust was nice and light. It was a good happy hour shareable.

5112655,2015-04-22,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"HEXX is located in the front of Paris Hotel and Casino. It's open 24 hours, and that includes the bar and alcohol! They have entrances both on the Strip, and from inside the Paris casino. We were staying at the Paris, so stumbled onto this place when we saw the entrance from inside the casino, and glad that we did. We sat inside at the bar, and our bartender (Scott) was great!! We picked a couple things off of the menu, and they were both great. We really liked the selections to choose from. We got the smothered fries (awesome!), shrimp cocktail, soft pretzels with an amazing cheese dip, beef tartare. Everything was excellent. Prices seemed reasonable (as Vegas goes anyway). We planned on going back a couple days later, but that never happened. But we would return here anytime. Oh, and they are making their own chocolate in their candy store (attached to the restaurant via the street entrance). Great exotic chocolates to try at their ""chocolate bar"" with samples so you know which one you like. Plus a ton of other candies. So whether you stay at Paris or Planet Hollywood, which is close next door, stop in for a drink and food.",0Vj3S0EXIkvCr8yEMQc0Gg,1,0,4,iGhCoaO--6J1Q3nDfvDU6A

Popped in to HEXX for brunch, and it was enjoyable though nothing overwhelmingly special. We were fortunate to get a table pretty quickly on a Sunday afternoon, and we admittedly were in a bit of a rush because my sister-in-law had to catch a flight within a few hours. But they were willing to take us and we were staying in that very hotel, so it made for an easy and convenient option. 

The service was fine but could have been better; the staff clearly had a lot on their plates, and while they were friendly, they were probably a bit stretched. There was a bit of a miscommunication regarding my sister-in-law's meal that resulted in her missing out on an ingredient that was supposed to be included in her dish (chilaquiles) and that she had really wanted, but ended up not getting due to the mix-up. 

Otherwise, the food was definitely solid. I ordered the veggie omelette and it was quite enjoyable, with good depth of flavor. Sides included potatoes, which were fine, and an english muffin, which actually had an unusual but interesting texture. The meal certainly filled me up for a good chunk of the day, so that was appreciated. My husband ordered the veggie burger, and I was impressed to see that they made their own. While it did not hold up well in terms of composition (as in it fell apart easily and ended up being eaten with a fork), it was delicious in terms of flavor. 

Enjoyable and well worth the visit, particularly for a filling and simple brunch after a lot of perhaps other excessive Vegas meals. Solid option for folks looking for an easy place to dine along the Strip.",9sAAD4WNzKcPZ02bkKv39w,0,0,3,FLauIq_A-bBJijhOouA4WA
5118245,2018-02-20,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"My boyfriend and I visited Hexx for my birthday brunch on a very busy Sunday afternoon. We hadn't researched this place at all but decided to go in anyways since it looked like a cool place. We were offered the option of immediate bar seating or to check in and wait for a table. Normally, we would've opted to go to another place since we don't like waiting or sitting at the bar, but since we were hungry and tired, we chose to be seated in the bar. The only negative of our whole experience here was that we waited for about 10 mins before we were brought menus by the bartender, who ended up being our waiter. The wait was understandable though as the bartender had 4 or 5 other tables in his areas plus a few people sitting at the actual bar. 

The menu had quite a few different things to choose from including sweet and savory brunch items, pizza, and salads, so I knew this would be a difficult decision for my boyfriend and I. In the end, I decided to go for the Veggie Burger and my boyfriend chose the Corned Beef Hash. Once we placed our order, the food came out fairly quickly considering how busy it was. My veggie burger was delicious! It had a great chipotle mayo with just the right amount of spice. Only thing I disliked about the sandwich was the huge slices of avocado, but that's just a personal preference. I am sure that someone who enjoys avocado would consider the avocado the be just the right amount. My boyfriend loved the corned beef hash too.

As for their drink menu, their brunch feature is $23 bottomless mimosas, which I feel like is a very fair price for unlimited mimosas in Vegas! There were a variety of other signature cocktails, bloody Mary's, beers, and wines to choose from as well. I opted for a simple Malibu and pineapple juice, while my boyfriend tried an IPA beer (Prairie Artisan, Phantasmagoria), which he enjoyed throughly.  

Overall, we had a great experience here and will definitely be back to enjoy more of their delicious food next time we're in Vegas! Next time we will be sure to book a table ahead of time!",qVTg30bOMywB8YeiQhk-og,2,0,5,bqsYRuxnLplDG7epthZZvg

My friend from home always talked about this place called Hexx... just happened be right outside of our hotel. We went for drinks the first day and tried one of the potion drinks. It was super sweet. Great for the insta, not worth the money though. 

Two days later we needed food AND drinks. We sat down and waited for about 20 minutes. Our waiter kept walking past saying I'll be right back. Not gonna lie, we were thinking about leaving. THANK GOODNESS we didn't. Sean was triple sat right as we walked in, hence the long wait. Once he could get to us, he was the best! Him and his helper Josh never let our bottomless mimosas get even half empty. Very attentive and helpful with the menu. He was willing to take a picture of the group, followed by a selfie with him! One of the best waiters I've had in a while. Very personable.

The food was great too! The turkey club was amazing. 3 of the 4 of us had it. The 4th had the chicken and waffles with the bourbon syrup. As a KY girl, I enjoyed it! It was a perfect mixture of sweet and savory.",ZwzQ4ebnyQKEEifUL66vwg,1,0,5,ujx83W0hpKanMjfuFdlH0g

It's such a nice restaurant and I wanted a seat outside overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio, but there was a long wait and I had things that I wanted to do before I left Vegas. The bar had immediate seating so I sat there.  I ordered the Chilaquiles with coffee on the side. The coffee was nice and strong (the way I like it) but the meal itself was just ok. Chilaquiles were made with chicken and the chicken tasted like it was leftover and reheated. It wasn't horrible and it was certainly edible but it was  hardly what I expected from a $15 brunch dish.

My man and I went here for dinner on the Fourth of July and were not disappointed. The prices are a bit steep but it is Vegas and you're at a fancy restaurant on the strip so it is expected. Our waitress was Sheri. If you can request her, do it! She is the best waitress we've had in Vegas so far and this is our 4th trip here together. She is very polite, knowledgable, and intelligent about the menu, the ingredients used, and the Vegas strip in general. We asked her a good place to get sushi and she was knowledgable about locations on the strip as well! We shared the chips and dip to start. It was delicious! I love onion dip. You could tell the chips and the dip were homemade and not from a package! We then shared the pepperoni pizza. Also delicious! It's not your boring old pizza, it is thin crust with a sauce that has a slight kick. Onion, garlic and cheese. Mmmm. The pepperoni on it were huge. We at first were just looking for something small to split since we wanted sushi later but the food and service was so good we decided to get dessert too. Sheri recommended to Aztec cake so we tried that! We had it with some coffees. It was very good. The boyfriend liked it even though he isn't big on chocolate stuff. It's a light and soft cake that has an excellent chocolate flavor. We devoured the whole thing. The other desserts looked great too. Next time I'd probably go for the espresso torte, just because it sounds so good! I'd definitely order the Aztec cake again too though! The coffee was very strong so I had to doctor it up a little with sugar and cream. It's definitely a dark roast but the flavor is still good. If you like a strong, dark cup of coffee, I definitely recommend to get one here for breakfast or dessert! 
Hexx is a must try if you are someone who loves to try different restaurants in Vegas! If you can get Sheri for a waitress, it'll make your experience even better! I love sparkling water, I ordered that and every time I even thought about pouring more into my glass from the bottle at the table, she was already there pouring it for me! With dessert she brought us 2 complimentary pieces of chocolate that paired nicely with our cake and coffee.

I wanna say the whole croissant sandwich itself was about the size of my face (but I guess that's not saying much since my face isn't really big but still...). The croissant also came with a side of potatoes which was mouth watering. The potatoes had the perfect amount of garlic and crispiness to them. I lowkey wish they gave me more.The whole meal itself was really filling, and I was already full before I even made it halfway through.  I guess the only sad part about the meal was I couldn't finish it.. wayyy too filling for this tiny body. But I couldn't take it to-go with me either cause we didn't have time to go back to our hotel room, and you can't really bring food in with you to dayclub ya know? Actually, I'm pretty sure that's not even allowed.

Inside there was a nice row of couches available and we hung out for a few minutes until our table was ready.

To start, we shared an order of the twisted sticky bun. We had been debating between starting with that or an order of the carrot cake pancakes and the server helped us decide. I think we made the right decision. It's a large bun similar to ""monkey bread"" where small pieces can be easily pulled apart and it's perfect to share.

For our main dishes, we got an order of the chicken & waffles, and also the Hexx Benedict. Both dishes are staples for us when we go out to brunch, and Hexx delivers these classics in true Vegas ""indulgence"" style. We were not disappointed.

The atmosphere at Hexx is low-key and open. It's perfect for a nice sunny day and is great people watching out on the strip.",pLvCTZVKAxIDzG4_NdjG5A,0,0,4,Lov5tFTt_qnViH1tdz39Kw

5278848,2017-12-29,6,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Taking advantage of two visitors and a pair of holiday weekends to revisit several of 2017's best meals it was as a party of five that Brunch was enjoyed at HEXX Kitchen + Bar inside Paris Las Vegas, the city's best 24/7 Restaurant now a three-year tradition at Christmas and this year doubling as a 21st Birthday celebration for one guest at the table. 

Always a Restaurant testing the limitations of its space and clientele, the appointment of Due Forni's Carlos Buscaglia to top Toque earlier this year ushering in the complete overhaul of a Dinner menu that now holds its own against any Restaurant of its ilk while surpassing many 'fine dining' spaces in terms of creativity, it was just past 11:00am on Sunday morning that hostesses led patrons to a lengthy indoor banquet reserved earlier that week, a pleasant young woman stopping by within moments to take drink orders of Coffee for most, plus one Potion for the guest of honor. 

Once again featuring shockingly efficient service for a place that does so much volume, Mr. Stotland keeping a watchful eye over the expansive space and coordination of servers with bussers seamlessly filling drinks and clearing plates without ever feeling late or intrusive, it was in three courses that Brunch was consumed beginning with HEXX's famous Fruit Plate, the collection this time highlighted by Papaya and Pineapple best dipped in Coconut Whip while the Dragon Fruit was far sweeter than usual, both on the plate and as incorporated into the ""Magick Dragon"" that billowed smoke upon service with a flavor not dissimilar to the Red Icee's served at the movie theater.

Investing in both old and new favorites throughout a two-hour meal, the portions seemingly larger than past visits as relates to both sweets and savories, it was with many focused on the fluffy Brioche Sticky Bun that regulars reveled in the return of Chef Matt Piekarski's Carrot Cake Pancakes, the item now back on the Brunch Menu every bit as good as memory serves with lightly spiced Batter fluffy and moist beneath a mound of Cream Cheese Frosting.

Sharing all plates family-style, the carbohydrate-heavy first course taking its toll on lighter appetites despite several plates to follow, it was to wide eyes that servers next delivered HEXX's Benny replacing English Muffins with cheesy Potatoes alongside a stacked Breakfast Croissant and Chilaquiles with a lot of spice and several still-crisp Tortilla Chips, plus an oversized order of the typically Dinner-only fried Broccolini.

Admittedly a lot of Food, the Parmesan Potatoes particularly dangerous when accounting for portion and likelihood of going back for seconds, it was after a brief respite with one guest already waving the white flag that four all-new Desserts were delivered, Pastry Chef Mirada proving a worthy successor to Carol Garcia with thick Pumpkin Brulee that eats like Pot de Cr√®me with a caramelized top plus a boozy Shake served next creamy confetti Cheesecake and equally rich Marshmallow Semifreddo beneath crumbled Graham Crackers and Fudge made from HEXX's bean-to-bar Chocolate.

Not quite finished yet, a tableside Tiramisu still in-process as the last drops of Amaretto trickled through Coffee Beans to Almond Cake below, it was by way of advanced order that Brunch finished with a custom White Cake filled with Strawberries and Cream, @cakegirl702 living up to her name in terms of both design and taste even though most were too full to enjoy it until later.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,7,5,_NqvIa3ZfzRBqypgWEBbaA

The bottomless mimosas were a good deal. They bring around a pitcher to fill up your glass, and we had about 4 by the time we left. The prosecco was a bit flat and the OJ was cheap, but I expected that. The food was pretty awesome too. I had the chicken and waffles, served with house made pickles and syrup. So yum.

However, I do not agree as I did not have the 5 star experience that it is getting. It was mostly due to lack of service, our waitress did not seem to be too attentive to our table. In fact, multiple times I had to track her down to either order something, get a refill and ask for additional condiments. I'm addition, after we ordered a dessert, the waitress came out 10 min later to tell us the dessert was not available. This happened twice... It would be better if the waitress was able to inform us earlier that certain desserts were not available at that time instead of waiting after we ordered. We were definitely at the restaurant for much longer than what we intended. I mean, I didn't want to spend most of time in Vegas at a restaurant...

Regarding the food, I was not too fond of the corn beef hash. I was expecting it to be more fried but it had a very soft texture. However, I also tried the carrot pancakes and I actually really like the flavor of the pancake. It is topped with a nice cream cheese frosting which is delicious as I did not need additional syrup. The frosting was sweet enough with the pancakes and I would definitely recommend that if you are in the mood for a sweeter side. The dessert we got was the smores which had ice cream in between Graham crackers topped with heated marshmallows and chocolate. Definitely try if you like the mix of warm and cold desserts!",IduRVcZB3uBSdpjQ3wFYfg,4,0,3,19H3KgO6UHhPI1dhYuTLMA

Menu was great and he decided on the 14 oz. ribeye while I had something smaller- meatballs, cause I wanted to save some room for their desserts.

14 oz ribeye was SALTY- too much peppercorn.
Meatballs came out COLD and DRY- returned it and rejected a second order, because we had already waited more than 20 minutes for our food to come out.

Disappointed but was also looking forward to desserts because BANANA ICE CREAM caught my eyes and I had to have it ;)

Easy to get seated at 1030am mid-week. We scored a table on the patio overlooking Las Vegas Boulevard. 

Quickly was met by our server assistant to get introductions and waters. Server arrived a few minutes later to gather drink orders.

Ordered a twisted sticky bun for the table and meat omelet as my dish.

Bun arrived soon after and was piping hot! A twited cinnamon bun rolled into a circle and baked. Then, topped with brown sugar, cream cheese frosting and toasted pecans. The warm frosting oozed over crevices and intothe bun as we cut into the dish. Highly recommended for those with a sweet tooth. 

Dishes arrived soon after. Meat omelet was bountiful. Musthave included 3 eggs, stuffed with bacon, chicken, pork and sausage, with cheddar cheese. Dish is served with an English muffin and home fries. Home fries are smashed and seasoned new potatoes flash fried. A hearty addition to the dish.

Woke up hungry after midnight and this or pizza were the only choices.  I had wanted to try this place anyway, so why not -- but no, never again.

Pulled pork French fries sounded great.  Well, if you like a big nasty lump of goo all glued together with cheese curds and swamped in some kind of nasty almost barbecue almost mayo/gravy.  Repulsive.  Literally tasted like something a small child would make by mixing every leftover in the refrigerator. 

Clam chowder that came with the dry nasty salmon tasted like a dirty fish tank.  The salmon tasted old and way too fishy.  Gross.  

The burger turned out to be almost decent, hence the 2 stars instead of negative 5 stars I would have given it for EVERYTHING else.  If you're starving to death in the middle of the night and have ABSOLUTELY no other choice than this place, at least don't waste your time on the other swill --have the $20 burger that is almost as good as Wendy's or Burger King. Almost.  

Way overpriced for this crap. -- There actually is not a price low enough for this place. I would pass it up if they were giving away food actually -- Even though one expects overpriced on the strip.

It tastes similar to Malibu/Pineapple. It was really good. About 10 or so shots inside. We had the spinach artichoke dip, Loaded fries, Pepperoni pizza and calamari. The food was great. I personally loved the dip and fries. I would have given 5 stars but was disappointed to hear that they don't do anything for birthdays. I was offered a dessert menu and told they'd provide me with candles but I'd still have to pay full menu price. Considering how much $ we spent here I would have assumed they would at the very least speak to management and try to make some sort of gesture even at 1/2 price. Most places do something small for celebratory events. I really hope they consider this in the near future.

Well, that's the upside. The chicken and waffles are perfect. Get them. Now for the downside: like most strip restaurants, Hexx is definitely too expensive for what it is. It is a pretty nicely decorated and kept restaurant right off the Paris and with Las Vegas Blvd frontage, but for the price I'd expect good service, but the service at Hexx always seems a little scattered and disorganized.

5401108,2017-01-23,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"I love dinner at this restaurant but brunch is a whole other story. We went for brunch today and were sorely disappointed. The menu is limited and the food wasn't all that impressive. I ordered the veggie omelette which came with an English muffin and potatoes. The veggie omelette was grossly under seasoned and the English muffin was soft and not toasted properly. My friend ordered the meat omelette and she was just as unimpressed as I was with mine. The coffee was not very good which surprised both of us. The total for both was $50 which we felt was way too expensive as the food just was not that good. We will definitely not be coming back for brunch. I gave it two stars for brunch and this is why the average comes out to three stars because dinner is about 4 to 5 stars and so the average comes out to three stars for both experiences.
Evening/ dinner: Some of the dinner items were really good and others were average, yet overall, I would come back here and that gives it four to five stars for. Let me start by saying that it is a beautiful restaurant. Cool decor and relaxed atmosphere. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, from the inside of the Paris Hotel, we saw an area where you could sit four people with pillows all around you and two small but still good sized tables. It was comfortable and I totally wanted to chill there. The waiter told us that if we are having dinner, we really should pick a dinner table as there is not enough room in this area. I wish I had listened to my gut feeling because he sat us at a table with chairs that were higher than your average chairs, which most of the tables have, and it was very uncomfortable for me at 5 foot 4"" and I could actually feel my legs falling asleep! I did not want to be rude so I did not say anything but as soon as we were done with the entr√©es, I asked to move back to the lounge area which was so relaxing and everyone agreed we should've stayed there from the beginning. That is just a clue for anyone that is not as tall and there are tables with normal chairs, and by that I mean they are closer to the ground.
THE FOOD: we started out by ordering two appetizers which were the hummus with pita chips and the meatballs. The hummus was just okay. I would not order it again. The meatballs were really good: there are two medium-sized meatballs that come out and the sauce made of tomatoes and cheese around them is delicious.
The entr√©es were as follows: one of my friends got the classic burger and liked it. He said it was not the best burger he's ever had, but it was really good. My friend got the salmon which was amongst clams and a rich broth. She said it was delicious. I got the Seabass, which I was told was one of the chef's favorite dishes. I have to say it was good but not amazing. The roasted Seabass was good, but I have had way way better Seabass. It was on top of a couscous and that was delicious.
One of my friends and I got a drink called the desert smash which consisted of gin with several fresh fruits in it and I loved it. This drink that we got was crisp and clean and it was delicious. 
The asparagus, which was a side, was absolutely delicious. One of my friends got the crushed Yukon potatoes as a side. It was good. I'm not the biggest potato fan so I would not be the best person to judge it but it was good.
We had some very nice people providing the service. We were offered free dessert and two items came out: one was a warm apple pie in the shape of a small round pie with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over it and the other was a brownie with a large scoop of ice cream over it that was really good. We are not big dessert people, yet I will say for people that like sugar, either item was delicious. I am not a big brownie fan, but the ice cream on top of the brownie was outstanding.
We will definitely be coming back here for dinner. It was a lovely experience with a very nice staff.
There are a lot of items on the menu and it's all about what you like. 
Make sure to ask for a table that you know you'll be comfortable at and if all you're going for is either appetizers and drinks or just dessert, the small areas where you can sit amongst pillows with two tables side-by-side, where four people can fit in comfortably, is really cool.
Great service, great ambience, great location, good food.
We came here because we won a gift certificate at a charity event. I am glad I won it because this was a really nice experience and it exposed us to a very cool restaurant that we are definitely coming back to.
Therefore, in summary, brunch is not worth it and we would never go back and there are way better places in Las Vegas, even in that same hotel, for way better brunch. Dinner is very good and I do recommend it.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,0,3,pCADKV49sIJ0iN6uRd4mHw

This year we got the carrot cake pancakes and the chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were a little dry and definitely needed the syrup but pretty good once you added the syrup. The carrot cake pancakes were amazing. They were like eating a dessert. I would definitely get them again. I tried a bit of what my sister got - the chilaquiles which was very good. 

It can be a little pricey depending on what you get at brunch but not too bad. 

All in all this is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. There's always a line if you aren't a diamond rewards member though so get there early or be ready to wait.",QGOtNZfasBwWCuawKjypYA,0,0,5,VNU90Ou00UCnCLPkR6nnZA

Ambiance: Hexx / Alexxas has a great modern contemporary vibe. There are tables to choose from and also comfy couches to lounge on. In the bar area you can sit in quaint nooks for privacy. The natural lighting from the strip is perfect on a sunny day.

Food: Alexxas has a small bites and tapas menu and the Hexx menu has delicious entree and brunch options depending on the time of day and day of the week. We tried the ceviche, chicken sausage flatbread, and calamari. The calamari was my favorite! It had a light drizzle of buffalo and ranch and was like having buffalo wings but in the form of light and fresh calamari. We decided to try desert with the churro bites - oh man! The caramel dipping sauce has an alcoholic surprise we weren't ready for! The Hexx chocolate dip was Rich and dark and a perfect
Compliment. 

Drinks: We tried cocktails including the key lime martini and the pinky swear sangria. Everything was fresh and light and crafted perfectly. 

Service: our server was prompt and friendly. The churro bites took a very long time but were worth the wait.

Breakfast Croissant: amazing croissant filled to the brim with Black Forest ham and aged cheddar. Croissant was crispy and melted in your mouth. Came with a side of grilled fingerling potatoes drizzled with sea salt and some ketchup. Easily one of the better breakfast croissant I've had in a long time!

Veggie Omelet: was very tasteful and filling. Came with peppers, onion, spinach and mushrooms. In addition to the English muffin included they added some baked fingerling potatoes. The croissant is still a better lunch item depending on your preference.

My veggie burger with fries was ok the other hand amazing! The patty was thick and not dry at all! The fries were some of the best I've had. Perfectly crispy and flavored with some sort of spice.

Originally, we were supposed to go to Mon Ami Gabi but they had some kind of emergency going on and they weren't serving anyone, so the bf and I decided to go to Hexx instead. Started off with the shrimp cocktail and crab cakes. OMG... best shrimp cocktail I've ever had. 4 Huge, prawn-sized shrimp that required the use of a with a knife and fork. Accompanying cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it. Crab cakes were delish. I'm always hesitant to try crab cakes on the west coast because I'm partial to the ones I've had on the East Coast. These crab cakes did not disappoint. Slight crunch on the exterior and nice ratio of lump crab and filling on he inside. We decided to share the prime-rib sandwich that came with fries. Big portion, tender meat, perfect for sharing. Comes with an au jus to dip and the horseradish to slather on your sandwich. We left stuffed and happy. Best lunch I've had in Vegas by far. We sat outside so we were also able to people watch their outside patio. Next time, we'll come in the evening so we can watch the water show at the Bellagio while dining.

The chowder is not thick but merely a broth that the salmon is placed in with some arugula sprigs floating in it.  You will not be getting a salad or a chowder.  They need to rename this dish.  Thankfully, our waiter explained it to me at the time I ordered it.  The dish was very, very good.  I wanted more of it.  My husband opted for the crab cake and a salad and he was also very satisfied.  Upon receiving our bill, the waiter gave us each a piece of their dark chocolate.  I LOVE dark chocolate but this was inedible.  I had to spit it out.  Bitter beyond words.  I did try some chocolate at their candy shop and it was very good so don't let this discourage you.

Too bad because I do like the ambiance here, it is trendy and touristy but also casual. Nice place to go on a date or bring your friends after a night out on the strip.

My favorite things to eat here are the smothered fries, which are normal fries but with cheese, pulled pork and BBQ sauce on top. They were amazing both times I had them. There are more then large enough for one person, or good for multiple people to share. I have also had the hummus here which is different. The chickpeas are not smashed, they are whole and so the hummus us not smooth as one might expect. Still good thought I thought.

Their drinks and chocolates are for sure their top items around here. Their chocolate tastes very different from the normal ones we know in the food store but if you love chocolate or are adventurous then why not try it out? The chocolate reminds me of strong dark chocolate, supposedly with no chemicals or preservatives and man can you taste the difference! I personally didn't like it, but my friends did. Worth a try for sure since they bring some samples around at the end of your meal. Their alcoholic drinks are also worth a try- if you come during the day make sure to look out for their happy hour or drink specials and save yourself a few bucks.",BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA,2,2,4,0ak_Z8l5uiICYn-YNtR6pg

5551589,2018-04-01,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"My boyfriend and I made reservations on open table to dine here one of the nights on our recent Vegas trip. We called ahead and asked to be seated outside so we could watch the Bellagio fountains. At first the host said that the outdoor seating was first come, first serve, but we told him that our entire goal was to be seated outside, so if they wouldn't be able to accommodate that, then we would just find another spot - he quickly changed his tune and confirmed that we'd be able to sit outside at the time of our reservation. 

The view outside was definitely what we were looking for. The patio also had heat lamps there which would be great for colder evenings. Our server was very energetic, made a few wine suggestions, and brought out some water and our wine. He was mostly scarce through the remainder of our dining experience (but not absent...just gave us space).

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip to start. While the dip itself was delicious, the chips seemed like they were just store bought. Would have been nice to have had something more fresh and/or authentic. Also the chips are too thin for this hearty dip - they kept breaking when we tried to scoop up some of the dip. We then shared the mushroom risotto and the bone-in ribeye. The risotto, while it was tasty, was mostly just OK, nothing incredible. The steak was ordered medium rare, and was served slightly more cooked than I typically prefer, but it was still yummy. Our total bill (which included a bottle of wine, an appetizer, one side, and one steak) for about 160$ after tip. We also had a 5% off coupon from Tix4Tonight. A bit overpriced, as neither of us were blown away by any of the food, but all in all it was an enjoyable experience.",ybO9yJuh2Ek2vI4moiLlxA,3,1,4,AuhEdySwI_Zg_aX784jKCA

Our waiter greeted us with a friendly, warm smile, and got to filling our water glasses and drink orders on the spot.

We enjoyed the Traditional Caesar and Simple Salads to start. The Caesar was large enough for two of us to share, while the Simple Salad was just about the prettiest salad that I'd ever seen! Time and care from the kitchen was obviously present. 

One of us ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie appetizer as a meal, and was not disappointed! Again, the presentation was inspired! Two of us shared the Pappardelle, and were still unable to finish everything! If you love mushrooms, these wild mushrooms will not disappoint! However, the person who ordered the Hexx burger went back and forth between bites of the burger and oohs and aahs! After having a burger the other day at Gordon Ramsay's Burger, he stated that the two were incomparable!

We were able to snag outdoor seating too! The waitress brought water out to us immediately and took our drink orders. I ordered a hot green tea, it comes out with its own little pot which was very convenient so I could refill my own teacup. 

For my entree, I ordered the Gravlax Benedict, which comes with house made gravlax (raw salmon in salt, sugar and dill seasoning), english muffin, hollandaise, red onion and potatoes. The salmon was well seasoned, the egg was perfectly poached and the side of potatoes were amazing. The potatoes had a nice crispy burn to the skin, but not overdone where the potatoes were dried out. I was very happy with my order and I left very full. It was just the right amount of food, I didn't feel disgustingly stuffed. At $17, it was a little pricey, but it was a nice brunch with great service so I would say worth the price.

Eventually, when we got hungry, we debated on where we should go to eat. Somewhere close by and somewhere with great reviews. Then I realized, I have had HEXX kitchen bookmarked for a while now and it is located inside of the hotel, so we decided why not! 

We arrived around 11:30am and it was brunch time. There was a 25 minute wait, so we spent our waiting time drooling over all the desserts they had in the HEXX chocolate bar next door. Everything looked so good, especially the ice cream sandwiches!! (I ended up getting one and omg, amazing!)

Once we got seated, we were overwhelmed by the amount of items they had on their brunch menu. We STRUGGLED to decide. Ultimately, we ordered an array of delicious brunch specialties and it was awesome!

Chilaquiles (3.5/5)
I must say, these weren't bad. But they were not amazing. Plus, you will always get a dish of chilaquiles anywhere that will eventually become soggy. Not my thing really.

Corned beef hash (5/5)
Now, this dish was so freaking good! Probably the best corned beef hash I have ever had! Highly recommend!

Breakfast croissant (5/5)
The croissant was perfectly flaky and so buttery. Let me say that ALL croissant breakfast sandwiches should taste like this one! Nailed it for sure!

Meat omelet (5/5)
This is what I call an omelet. No complaints. BOMB.

Carrot cake pancakes (5/5)
Okay, okay. Now this right here had me craving pancakes for the rest of the week and I am not the pancake type. Waffles are my go-to, but oh my goodness, these were heaven!!

The four stars is because our service was not that great. We had to ask for water re-fills and it seemed like our food took a little longer than it should have. I don't know if it's because we didn't order alcohol, but the service was just alright. Part of the time I really wondered if we were forgotten about. But from my experience working in a restaurant, it seemed like they were transitioning and new servers were coming onto the floor because we really couldn't tell who our server was. 

Anyway, I would still come back! The food was great and it would have been a great pair with their bottomless mimosas! Until next time!",GrJ11lm2cFjlxqBl49ez7w,3,2,4,p9vvPAhJ8XJfjspfWzBk9Q

I ordered the ""spicy jambalaya."" I tried jambalaya in Louisiana and really liked it so I thought it would be a safe choice. The spicy jambalaya at Hexx kitchen was easily 4x saltier than what I had at other authentic restaurants. I thought there was some kind of mistake and the chef accidentally poured a lot of pepper and salt onto the dish. The waiter was nice and tried to bring us extra rice, but the rice unfortunately was also almost just as salty. 

This is the first time I have ever complained about a dish because I just could not stomach it down. I drank 4 cups of water and still was not able to finish the meal.

When I made my reservation that same morning, Hexx said it offered complimentary valet parking for its guests.  When I arrived, the valet said Hexx hadn't updated its website and I would owe $13. After placing my order, I showed the manager on my phone his restaurant's offer and he incorrectly told me that was between me and the hotel.  

As a courtesy to him, I called the hotel.  The hotel's response was, appropriately, that the offer was between the restaurant and me. Again, I asked to speak to the manager and told him that the hotel was correct when it said the restaurant was responsible for honoring its contract, and I would deduct the $13 from payment.

He said he would review the listing to see if had any outs such as ""subject to change without notice."" Seriously!? I couldn't make this up.   Is that really intended for a situation where the restaurant changes its parking policy 45-minutes after someone makes a reservation because of its parking policy? 

Sure, if the website had adequate disclaimers, it may have the right to respond ""screw you,"" or similar, to its guests if it would like to.  However, disclaimers are not intended for when less than hour passes between a quoted price and someone accepting it (the stock market excluded).  The waiter returned with a $13 credit on my check since the manager wasn't able to find ""subject to change without notice."" 

***Note to all restaurateurs: if 45 minutes earlier your website stated a cheaper price for anything (corkage, parking, menu items), and someone makes a decision to dine at your restaurant based on that and comes directly to your restaurant, honor the information on your website.***

An appropriate response would be, ""Thank for letting us know.  We'll update our website and, of course, honor that price this time."" Any other response serves as litmus test for anyone ""serving"" at your restaurant.

The food was good but the music was too loud for casual conversation.  Fortunately, I was dining solo.  If I had a guest, I would have found it challenging to converse.  For that reason, and my not needing to assume the risk for any restaurant's mistakes, I would not return.

I have to give 1-star for value because paying for valet parking almost doubles the cost of breakfast for a regular, solo diner.  I suspect using the free parking may make going there take too much time for the everyday diner on his lunch break.

My server, Julio, was great.  The service score reflects my overall experience which, even a truly service-oriented server like Julio, can't overcome significant mishaps from management.",m_s5elWb2Y6REsFpyAyHlw,0,0,2,BHar3e7ShaYovgHNfXm42w

The eggs Benedict was amazing, as well as this cheese bread we ordered to start as an appetizer. Our waiter was really nice, but took around 30-45 minutes to charge our cards for the bill. This was extremely disappointing. We had thought our waiter maybe forgot about us and went on break with the bill in his apron, maybe he was in the bathroom taking care of business, or maybe he was stealing all of our credit card info! The amount of time to charge 3 cards (split bill) was outrageous. Nonetheless, our cards were eventually charged and we were on our way. I would have loved to give this restaurant a 5 star rating, but due to this major issue it must fall under a 4, which is the utmost generous.",0yDbZBujNHx9D5s5wsPACA,2,2,4,KIwcAnsh2bZ-BOR9QcUMrg

Hexx Kitchen + Bar has taken over the previous business Sugar Factory which I believe moved to the Towne Center location in Las Vegas. They offer a variety of sweet confections as well as savory dishes. However, all that I sampled was some of their vanilla gelato which satisfied my sweet tooth for the moment. We sat along the patio bar which offered a great view of the strip, people watching and the Bellagio fountains.

After finishing my scoop of gelato, we wandered inside to browse their novelty items and came across their Chocolate Bar which was the highlight of my visit here. The offerings were pure chopped chocolate from Peru, Tanzania, Venezuela, Ecuador and Madagascar that had hints of fruit, caramel, almond and marzipan.  It was interesting how the Madagascar's fruity acidity didn't hit the tongue until after it melted. My favorite was chocolate from Ecuador which had notes of sweet marzipan, almond and floral flavors. For those that are chocolate fans, be sure to stop by Hexx for a sample of chocolate from around the world.

We were seated promptly and offered water.  We then had to remind someone to get our waiter so we could order after we had been waiting 15 minutes.  Another 10 minutes we get our drinks - glass of wine and a beer.  Another 25 minutes still no food.  We had ordered the Wagyu steaks ($60 steaks) - one fillet and one ribeye - both cooked medium rare with some side veggies.  We got the waiter's attention asked him about the food and told him we had a theatre show to make.  He said he would check.  Still no food.

Finally the steaks arrive at 9pm - 75 minutes after we arrived at the restaurant - all that for medium rare steaks.  

The food was good - steaks were decent and veggies were tasty.  We didn't have enough time to finish the food and had to leave some of the meal - also no hope of dessert, we never even finished our meal.  We had to track down the waiter to get the check.  We finally got out of the restaurant but missed the first 10 minutes of our theatre show.  We complained to the manager while we waited on the check but he didn't do anything.

This was really poor performance and I will probably never go back to this restaurant again.

From the name of the restaurant you dont expect such a fine dining experience but we were pleasantly impressed. We came for a late dinner and there weren't many diners inside. The wait for a table was short, but at the table the wait for service was a bit slow but we weren't in any hurry so it was fine. Also being a 24/7 steakhouse I understand how there can be a lull in service at late night. Also there were great views of the Bellagio fountains.
We decided to order the wet aged steaks. No joke, it was one of the best steaks I've had in my life. And I think even more amazing than the steak was mushroom risotto side dish. It was the best risotto I've ever had, tasted like melted butter fused into the rice. If you ever come here, get the risotto. We talked with the waiter how they were able to get that texture and richness in the risotto. The waiter said he used to be a chef (at another kitchen, not at Hexx), and that they made sure to coat each grain of rice in oil while sauteing to achieve that effect. That risotto is how I judge all other risottos. Its that good.
Anyways the service was a bit slow but great, food was excellent, price was decent using the Groupon. We had a great experience eating here.",lK7W43c3LqN8MRHHiXliqw,0,0,4,ot9tcbIMW6pnkAzIxQcQbA

Food: great portion sizes, food looks better than they taste (or ...at least the cinnamon waffle). My hubs enjoyed the lobster roll. I enjoyed the french fries. Chicken & waffles were decent.

Pricing:  3 plates & an iced tea cake out to $90ish with tip. Not surprising bc its right off the strip & looks bougie.

The drinks were also amazing, we got the flamingo and the Elixir. I much much prefer the taste of the flamingo it is so fruity, I can really taste the guava I love guava!!! The Elixir was very fun to look at and great for pictures and videos, but after that flamingo drink nothing else can taste better! I would say the only item that I was not a super huge fan of was the pizza carbonara, I thought it was slightly dry but not the crispy kind of dry. Other than that everything else was fantastic!

I would recommend this place to anyone and not just for dinner but for hosting weddings, funerals and even bat mitzvah's.",DFUzT3nb3aqAi9MPNO6C7Q,0,0,5,RXFYBp8LLC54nrbRbbQVbA

So grateful for the amazing service. Not to mention the incredible food. But they are what made it over the top exceptional service.

When you work in the restaurant industry you are unable to enjoy yourself sitting down for a brunch because you pay attention to everything behind the scenes. But Elaina and Alex made me forget I ever worked in a restaurant before. And that is the highest compliment I could ever give.

I refused and wanted my check since I still hadn't even received my drink yet.  The manager didn't even apologize for being late or anything just asked if we wanted our food or not.

Since the waitress was we went back. Our second time the waitress could not be anymore less engaged. She did not get our drink order. We had to call her over to place the order. My pepperoni pizza arrived and crab cakes and she never showed up again. After we finished our meal we were ready to order dessert but after 30 minutes of waiting and had to ask someone else to find our waitress we decided not to spend another dime there.

We decided to try bar section to avoid waiting and found two spots at the bar end. We were greeted with friendly and fast service that lasted throughout our dining experience. No service complaints whatsoever. 

Onto the menu, they had a wide variety of options available. Something for even the pickiest of eaters. While scanning the options, we came across a unique eggs benedict offering. Instead of the usual bread or biscuit offering as a base, HEXX Benedict used scalloped potatoes. I never considered this as a possibility, but don't think I can go back to normal benedict now. It was the best version of eggs benedict I have ever had. Egg cooked perfectly, potatoes were just crispy enough, and the sauce had so much flavor. Must have for fans of eggs benedict We couldn't pass up the offering of bottomless mimosas for $23. Signage out front claims this offering is available daily until 2 pm. As we got close to empty an employee will fill back up. Make sure to ask for an extra in a to-go cup for your trip around the casino or down the strip. The prices are what you'd expect from the location. Hexx has a chocolate store located next door for a variety of sweets available after a meal. Overall I would recommend this place for those visiting the strip. Can't go wrong with great food and bottemless mimosas for brunch.",QfiLPx3kAj-iYe8jTmzQsg,0,0,5,9H5WXPAhlLyDgSpj_myF9g

I reserved a table for 8 for a friend's birthday party and the experience was disappointing. The drinks were probably the second best part of the visit next to the sights, the drinks were shareable and had 8-10 shots and a pretty presentation. I wasn't able to try one so I opted for a virgin strawberry mojito which was pretty good. We ordered a variety of food from the guacamole to pizza and everything was pretty bland. The burgers had stale buns, the pizza was way too greasy, the pasta was bland. I ordered the mushroom pappardelle and I shouldn't have let our server talk me into adding shrimp because I couldn't stomach any of it and even though I literally didn't take one bite of the shrimp, she didn't ask what the problem was or even apologize for talking me into something I knew I didn't want. Adding garlic bread to your pasta costs extra and wasn't worth it. At the end of our dinner they came out with a tiny piece of cake for our friend and had the candle sitting on the plate all by itself so naturally the candle blew out and fell over before reaching my friend and the server just said I'm sorry, worst presentation ever and ran off. It was lame to say the least. Then two tables over we see a beautiful birthday treat come out with three well lit candles so that was even more upsetting. We ordered another dessert, the warm cookie Sunday and it was awfully dry and too thick to be considered a cookie. More like a dry chocolate chip cake. Just awful. For a place known for sweets, the desserts couldn't have let me down more. I won't return to Hexx and I will not recommend it. Also, the cherry on top, I came home and food positioning commenced.

5860331,2017-10-24,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"So I've eaten here before, after 12 AM. This time it's a bit earlier. We waited maybe 5-8 minutes to be seated inside. Our waiter was just okay. He was semi attentive in the beginning and then once our dinner came out, he disappeared. Never came back except maybe once to ask how things were.  I did notice that he was always at the table next to ours, but never at ours. That was irritating. He came back at the end to delicer our check, and that was it. Expecting a tip for what? That I don't even remember his name isn't surprising. 

It also was a nagging comment in my head that maybe he didn't want to wait on a group that looked like they wouldn't tip as much as the table next to ours. I get that all the time when I go out, I'm 30 and I tip based on service. If my service is terrible, do I think you deserve 15% or more. No. If you did amazing maybe you'll get tipped 20%. I guess it was the attitude that out waiter put off was not very pleasant. I want to say his name started with an M? Older gentleman, I think he wears glasses.  

On the other hand, the gentleman replenishing our waters and getting us boxes for our leftovers was great. Spencer, good friggin job. We joked throughout the meal about leaving a pitcher of water at our table, because he was frequently back refilling all of our waters. As soon as our cups were either half full or empty, he was there.  I'm hoping he got some of the tip we left and it didn't just go to our lazy waiter. He took away our dishes right away. 

Okay now onto the food.  So the menu is alright. We ordered the Caesar salad, seafood on ice, braised short rib, wagyu burger, brussel sprouts, broccolini, and the mushroom risotto.

The Caesar salad was not bad. The seafood on ice was okay. The crab legs were super cold and tough to eat without a small fork. The prawns were slightly overcooked. The tuna poke, shrimp ceviche, and lobster salad missed their mark. The garnishes on the plate were mostly inedible. Not a good choice.  

We ended up asking for clarified butter for the crab. The lobster was not bad, it wasn't over cooked and was tender.  

Hands down, the braised short rib was the best thing I've ever had there. It was the size of my forearm and the meat was just fall off the bone. There could have been more sauce that they braised it in on the plate.  The mashed potatoes were tasty, but a bit gummy. The acidity of the Brussel sprouts on as garnish was a bit much. 

I ended up eating the nicely charred brocoolini. That with short ribs and mash was delicious. I would definitely order this again. 

The wagyu burger was like an burger. The taste was alright, and the texture good. But it came out rare when we asked for medium. The pepper bacon was thick cut, good flavor. The fries were forgotten among all the food we had. Not sure if it was $23 amazing. 

The mushroom risotto needed to be cooked a little longer. When the rice still has a bite to it, and it wasn't creamy like risotto should be. The starches did not release. Risotto is a timely dish. You rush it, it doesn't come out right. Mom said flavor was good, but texture and execution were not.

1) Location: right in front of the Bellagio fountain if you sit in the patio, at night the atmosphere is alive because of the club atop the restaurant.

2) Food: although my ribeye was overcooked, i still enjoyed it, had enough flavor to compensate for the slight toughness. My girlfriends' Filet was on point. Pricing is reseaonable. 1 thing i didnt like was our server didnt let my girlfriend substitute her asparagus for something else. Im a server & i know it isnt really a problem at all to do that..

3) Drinks: they upgraded from the Sugar Factory's goblets to these even bigger POTIONS! pretty exotic looking drinks with the dry ice. Tried the Jungle Juice & Purple Haze, JJ was excellent!

4) Service: other than the asparagus i cant really complain! The bald busser there is really kept an eye on us & took every plate away asap without us having to ask. Shoutout to him!

5) Time: its pretty packed during the day, but they still open a little later than most restaurants. Went in around 12:30 & they were open a whl
Ile longer after that

Overall, this place is definately worth coming!",nsW76qutEE1irc5frjvJCA,0,0,4,Pi7Y62bc9LDThDxRc4Dirg

Harder to find then we expected but Hexx turned out to be perfect. He got a standard breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and bacon and I was able to get a veggie burger with some breakfast potatoes and coffee to make a burger qualify as breakfast. The food was awesome and the portions were big. Our server was Sean. Sean was friendly, professional, funny, and very attentive. We made quite a few modifications to our order and he brought out exactly what we wanted. They also had a bottomless mimosas deal that we didn't take advantage of because we were heading home after breakfast but I will definitely be going back for the mimosas, the yummy food, the pretty atmosphere, and the great service.",HW4j9RCZCyziqqrjA1MLEg,0,1,5,b8Q0dXPglBjlzWN8SAehHw

It honestly went quick because we wandered close by until we received a text that our table was ready.

5932035,2016-12-27,0,IWN2heYitkg-D4UdqfxcMA,"Stopped in for a light lunch yesterday. Menu is fairly simple but has plenty of choices to please a group with a variety of tastes/dietary requirements. 

We started with bloody mary's - one was ""bacon infused"" and the other was spicy. Both of them were tasty but seemingly light on the alcohol (which was fine...we weren't looking to get loaded). They have several special bloody mary choices - one of which looks like a meal (and it's $38...)!

We ordered one of the appetizers: candied bacon - which was just OK. Tasted like bacon; was expecting maybe a bit more sweet based on the description (maple glazed and cacao nibs). Also, a piece of wax paper got cooked up and delivered with the bacon...so that was a little weird. Kitchen dropped the ball on that one.

I had shrimp cocktail for my lunch and it was 6 pieces of very nice, jumbo shrimp. My companion had a burger and enjoyed it. 

Service was very good - efficient and friendly.

After reading some of the reviews, it seems that this might be a better choice for a decadent breakfast/brunch.",Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,1,1,3,xZ8rUiGLUh2F2lni7L1DiQ

I decided to still try this place out despite them, due to the simple fact that I LOVE the sugar factory. Well, I was disappointed because this place does not compare to the sugar factory in any aspects.  After being seated my waitress set menus on the table and walked away before greeting us. She then grabbed our wine glasses (before asking if we wanted any wine) and replaced them with small water glasses. At this point she still did not say anything to us. Serval minutes later she finally approached us and asked if we were ready to order and never offered us drinks. Throughout the entire meal she wanted very little to do with us. She would set down our food while turning her head and leaving before we could talk. 
The menu is much smaller, less variety, and their dessert menu is very poor. The food is overpriced, I could barely get anyone to give me service, talk to me, or even look at me for that matter. The view of the water show is gorgeous, but not worth it. The interior is also a failed attempt to look classy; mismatched furniture and decor. I also sat in a wicker chair, more proof that this place is a failed 5-star attempt. I do not plan on returning.",4V9LYcS_zxsU6LHFlr6LAw,3,0,1,QVlufbeSj_G6gTLYjIv5nA

I asked the server if we can still have the breakfast menu, since I heard HEXX is known for their breakfast. The server unfortunately couldn't give us the breakfast menu and we were forced to order from the lunch menu. 

The lunch menu is definitely pricier than the breakfast menu, but we felt optimistic about this place. 
I ordered the chicken BLT burger and it came with fries. I had one bite of the burger was it was BLAND all the way! Nothing too special about this $18 burger! The fries were average. I asked our server for a side of ranch dressing. The service was SLOW. It took a good 20 min just for ranch. And by the way, the restaurant wasn't that busy around that time. The ranch tasted like Hidden Valley ranch from the bottle. Ehhhh..

To summarize my review: slow service, overpriced & bland food (at least for lunch) & I wish we had the option to order breakfast instead! Definitely disappointed.

2 stars rating though because we had a view of the Strip.

We were advised it would be about a 35 minute wait for the first available table, the place was busy, so we waited. 35 minutes turned to 45 which turned to an hour... the hostess explained they were ""cleaning tables"" but there were lots and lots of open tables. After inquiring about our wait time twice, we were finally called in. We were brought out to the patio but our table was in direct sun without cover, I asked if we could sit in one of the other five tables for two outside that were in the shade. We were told that those tables were already ""called for"" - you can't swap my table with another open table that is five feet away? Hostess gave no effort to accommodate. Why would they? There is a long wait list so who cares about two unhappy people. So, we walked out - no effort from anyone to have us stay. 

If you are the type of person who likes hospitality and quality over quantity, this isn't the place for you. They've got a lot to work on in terms of managing the seating of guests and giving accurate wait times.

They were truffle or garlic and came with this incredible mayo. Delicious. My friends dad, who has a degree in culinary, was raving about the veal he ordered. The buffalo calamari was delicious as well. I wish I could've tried more! 

The only downside I had was that menu was limited. The sandwiches and burgers were only offered at lunch and I was hoping to order the veggie burger.

Luckily, it didn't stop us from experiencing this great dining experience at HEXX kitchen + bar. The modern atmosphere made the whole experience cool. All the furnishings, lighting and decor tied into the theme. The food presentation was very neat and fun. The drinks were smoking, from the dry ice, and the food was hot and fresh.

From the extensive menu, I decided on the pancakes and bacon. The order came with 3 large and fluffy pancakes. Topped with powdered sugar and parted with whipped butter and a nutty maple syrup. They were great and syrup was an awesome pairing with the pancakes. My wife enjoyed the pepperoni pizza that was large enough for two people to enjoy. The pepperoni on the pizza were larger than normal and they covered the pizza, we couldn't see any of the cheese because there were so many pepperoni. The pizza was topped off with toasted shaved garlic. The garlic looked like large Rice Krispies, but the flavor make the pizza even more savory.
