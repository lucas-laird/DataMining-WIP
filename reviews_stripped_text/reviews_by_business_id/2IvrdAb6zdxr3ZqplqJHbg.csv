They are really good. Just a little spice- not so hot that my nose runs.  Soft flour tortillas and a portion that's fitting.  3 enchilada, rice, beans.  I probably could have split this and maybe 1 more taco with someone but I'm alone. So I ate it all!!   I think this airport has such limited food.  I was happy to find this.

They actually serve restaurant styled food minus the usual utensils made out of metal and ceramic plates.  Food was served on plastic plates, plastic cups, and plastic utensils.  This created a less than memorable experience, subtracts from it.   The food is decent but detracted by the plastic experience.  Most of the cocktails came in plastic cups.  The sodas came with free refills.  I ordered a margarita but was surprised by the bill which said there was a double shot of tequila.  I did not believe it at first because I did not taste any double alcohol in the margarita but as I got up to walk and then I realized there was a double shot.  The reason I came to this place was to look for an alternative to the airport fast food eateries like Burger King or Subway.  Got almost the full dine in experience.

Blue corn Chicken Quesadilla - chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor... the guacamole was kinda bland as well...

Seat yourself, and that's fine. Sat down and waited 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting and flagged a waitress. The waitress had no idea what was on the menu and told us that it was her first day. I have nothing against someone on the first day, but you might think there would be some training or something.

I ordered the enchilada plate, and my coworker just ordered a drink (she had eaten earlier). We told the staff this, but when my food came out they wouldn't give it to me. The server literally came out and said ""oh, there's two of you, I must have forgotten one"" then turned around and carried my food into the kitchen. 2-3 minutes later she came back out and said ""that's really weird, there is no record of another order"". I answered that just I had ordered food. She then set the plate in the middle of the table and said ""oh, well i guess you two are sharing"", then she brought back small plates.

Regarding the food, the first couple bites were okay, the beans were good. The rice was dried out (think heat lamp). Then I started tasting the ""taco mix"" seasoning that was certainly used in excess. 

After I had finished, we sat and talked for 25 minutes. I kept looking at the server, expecting some eye contact and a head nod to provide the standard ""we are done"". She never got that message. That's fine, not everyone does, no sweat there. I finally looked right at her and said (she was within 3 feet) ""can we get the check?"". She literally stared at me for 10 seconds without acknowledging she heard me. She then turned around, poked at the computer for a couple seconds then walked away to the other side of the restaurant. A few minutes go by and she comes back to the wait station (this was right next to my table). About 6 of the staff were chatting there not doing anything (I get this happens from time to time, but most of them had been there for several minutes). I looked at my server again and asked for the check. She again stared at me for about 10 seconds (no acknowledgement again). She then went into the kitchen and came out a minute later with someone else who ended up running the check.

The true icing on the cake however, was that I felt sick before I got on the plane and ended up feeling sick for the entire flight.

A few weeks ago I was stuck in the Southwest terminal @ McCarran Airport on a 5-hour layover & needed something to eat and drink (of course). Even though I'm not big on Jose Cuervo, tequila sounded good so I decided to give it a try.

I sat @ the bar & Raymond (AKA Raymundo on his nametag - LMAO) was my bartender/server. I had a really long time to kill (5 hours) so I figured I'd take my time deciding what I wanted to eat and drink. Everything on the food menu looked delicious & even though I was completely undecided, Raymundo was very patient with me. I finally ordered the taco salad w/ shrimp & it was absolutely delicious!

As for the alcohol, I explained that I don't lie Jose Cuervo & Raymundo thought that was funny since I was in a Jose Cuervo Tequileria so that's all they serve. LOL Hey said the margaritas are good, affordable, & come w/2 shots of tequila. However, since I had so much time to kill, I decided to indulge in a couple of double shots of 1800 Silver over ice & it wasn't bad @ all. I actually just bought a bottle of Coconut flavored 1800 earlier today & it's delicious over ice! So I guess I do like Jose Cuervo @ times. LOL

There seems to be mixed reviews about the service. I had excellent service & since I was sitting at the bar, I found out that most of the people who work there are pretty hilarious! They were cracking jokes, making funny comments under their breaths, & acting up like I do with my co-workers. Seems like quite a few of them have been working there for a long time.

Overall, I had delicious food, tasty tequila, & great service! I look forward to going back next time I'm hanging out in the Southwest terminal in LV.",nvTztDIiDJJ8JS3HTlu2PA,0,0,4,Bg9F6BWC6sUomeLIbCyZHQ

We were super early for a flight from Vegas and had plenty of time to spare for a meal.  Our daughter is pretty picky but she will eat guacamole so we stopped in here.  It was busy, I'll give them that, but it was difficult to find a table because all of the tables were just two seaters.  Having our daughter with us, we needed three seats.  One of the other customers saw us looking around and gave up part of their table for us to use.  

We waited FOREVER for a server to come over to our table, after having watched her greet other folks that came in well after us.  When she finally did come to take our drink order, she took one look at our daughter and went off on a rampage.  She said ""Our drink menu is strictly adult! If you want a beer, I can help you out, but if you want anything like a chocolate milk for a kid, you're welcome to go to Burger King and bring it back.""  Rudeness.  So, we all had water.  We should've just left right then.

It took her a lifetime to bring our waters (they must be difficult to prepare).  When she took our order, we ordered chips with salsa for our girl (the guacamole looked funky!). My husband ordered the burrito.  I ordered the chicken nachos.  

Once again, our server took it upon herself to give us advice.  She basically said that we looked like we could use some financial advice and recommended that we only order my nachos, instead of ordering chips and salsa for our girl, too, because the nachos were enough to feed up to three people and it'd be cheaper.  We were furious!   We explained that the girl wasn't going to eat nachos covered in a bunch of crap, so just chips and salsa for her, please.  

We waited at least 45 minutes after that for the food to arrive, after watching other people who came in after us get their food before us.  When it arrived, it looked horrific.  Everything was sloppy and mushy and nasty.  

The burrito was soggy and unseasoned.  

The nachos were so gross; they were 50% chips, 25% melted cheddar cheese (slices?), 20% sour cream and 5% chicken.  It was funky, nasty stuff.

1672967,2014-07-14,0,2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg,"Quick Summary: Granted it's an airport bar and flavors are going to be mediocre and things are going to be overpriced... but I think I would have preferred waiting in the 20 min Starbucks line over this... yeah I did just advertise for another place in this review... take that as a sign.

I'm all about expectations... you look at my reviews and for the most part, I like places. It's because I know why they exist and appreciate why they are there, whether it is for ambiance, for flavor, or for a quick bite.

For an airport bar, I expect quick service, food for the masses, and an up charge cause well they can. I put emphasis on the quick service though, cause let's face it I'm in an airport and I've got places to go.

That being said I came into here on a weekday morning, part of an hour an a half layover on my trip. Though it was a weekday morning, it is Vegas and much like the city, the airport never sleeps... as proven by the masses of people all over the gates and the dozen or so already in this joint.

It's a seat yourself sort of place, which is kind of nice... they should put all hands into attending to the customers. I grabbed a spot next to few other groups who seemed to be pretty well settled in (with drinks, etc.) And that was where I sat for 15 min with no other interaction.... and the waitress must have buzzed right by me 3x without so much as an acknowledgement that I was even there.

I finally got my drink order in for a bloody mary, which the waitress convinced me to go with their house version which included a chipotle spiced vodka and came with a double shot... or so she told me... after the 20 min it took to get my drink, it wasn't anything particular to rave about... and it surely wasn't a double shot either... I know what a double shot of vodka in the AM does to me... and if I left there upset... it didn't do it.

I placed an order of the chorizo nachos, which were ok... somewhat warm... cheese not as melty as I would expect... but then at this point... what did I really expect?

So as I started this review... it's all about expectations... and for an airport bar they couldn't even live up to that... I spent a good 65 minutes for a drink and chorizo nachos (which didn't come until 55 min had passed)... I shouldn't have to wait anywhere for that sort of slow service...",h25vnXfrFPckqCGqFLe3oQ,0,0,2,UEQZu22sdF_o0HwOjIvYkQ

The breakfast burrito, with a few customizations, is fabulous and I would likely come back for it regularly... If the prices were dropped a few bucks and this weren't in the airport.

Standard breakfast burrito with choice of bacon or chorizo is just over $10, which is absurd to begin with. Subbing carne asada adds on $2. But the best (and most expensive) thing you can add to your burrito is queso sauce... Except it's an insane $3 fee. So your deluxe delicious breakfast burrito, with a side of potatoes (because a duvet-sized tortilla simply isn't enough carbs for one meal) will set you back nearly $20 with tax and tip. Frankly, I can't justify or afford that, but if you can, by all means contact me to be your personal assistant.

Seriously though, the proportion of egg to bean to bacon in the regular burrito is perfect, the pico adds an awesome bit of freshness and acidity, and the queso makes it a next-level contender for one of the best I've had.

1754648,2007-09-23,4,2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg,"People bitch way too much in general, and specifically about air-travel.   Flights are late, TSA carry-on rules are a pain and some overworked and underpaid airline employees make no secret of their unhappiness. But none of that makes it less amazing that for a historically small amount of money you can be whisked to any location in the country (the world, for that matter), reliably, in complete safety (as of 9-29-07 US commercial aviation is batting one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures) and at least relative comfort. 

There are a number of problems with bitching, but the biggest is that it leads to blindness. We overlook or dismiss lots of good things, big and small. Jose Cuervo Taquileria at McCarran Airport (Concourse C) in Las Vegas probably gets overlooked and dismissed a lot. And I think that's a shame. I've been there twice, and was impressed both times, though in very different ways

First time I was making a connection (something in common between an airport and Yelp?), the place was full but my friend and I scored a table. The first thing the waitress said to us: 'kitchen is backed up. It could be 45 minutes to get your orders out. Is that OK?' It wasn't (couldn't wait), so we left. But I was impressed. That was someone who had her thinking cap on, was willing to be honest and by so doing saved everyone a lot of grief and aggravation.

My second experience was more conventional, but equally customer-centric. For around $13 plus tip I got a generous sized and good (on a par with what I'd expect walking into a random San Francisco Tequileria) chicken  fajita burrito plate and large bottle of ice tea served by the the very friendly and efficient  Rachel. Chips and rice were fresh, beans were good, the fajita itself was well prepared. When I asked for Nutrasweet Rachel ran to Starbucks to acquire some. 

But more than the food, the tea, the Nutrasweet, the service,  I  got a small island of comfort and private space. The experience didn't change my life, but it made the trip more pleasant, and was well worth the price. I'll be back.

I asked the waitress for the virgin marg in a plastic cup with a lid, since it was going to be for a child. She stated that they don't have children's cups and that they didn't have to go cups with lids. She brought the children's drink in a glass container. Very soon after, the virgin marg was spilled. The waitress then replied, ""oh, do you want me to get you a plastic to go cup with that?"" I asked why we didn't get one in the first place, and she replied that she forgot. She then brought out our really subpar food, which none of us got to eat because we were busy cleaning up from her mess. She then brought the bill, which was $114! We asked her about it, and she replied that she comped our virgin marg. We replied that none of got to touch our meals because of this ""mistake"", and she shrugged her shoulders. 

I don't feel like I am usually very critical of waitstaff- I have waited tables before, and I know how hectic it can be. But this was far and away some of the worst service I've received.",OYQAWe0ztU-toqARil-khA,1,0,1,GEjMrBlZFoXZX6qvEwn3Eg

The manager was standing at the back of the restaurant telling people the section was closed only after they were seated.  She could have just as easily tied the area off with the available section ties. 

After sitting down the waiter was constantly rude and impolite.  After bringing waters he asked what we wanted to order and before we could begin he started walking away from the table.  It took 2x to get him our drink and food orders.  Subsequent requests for more water were blatantly ignored.  The margarita which arrived about 15 minutes in was somewhat decent but over priced (there were no drink prices on any of the menus and most food lacked prices as well).

When our food came our stomachs turned at a stale, cardboard, food gone bad smell.  We choked down two of the blue corn chicken quesadillas to much dismay.  The guacamole was bland and flavorless. The chips were stale. The only decent item on our plate was the pico de gallo.

We tried to stop the waiter 3 times to tell him the food was horrible. Twice he replied ok and did nothing but walk by our table.  The third time we finally had his attention we told him the meal was horrible and he asked if we wanted anything else quite belligerently to which we said no.  He offered no resolution then disappeared for 15 more minutes. He did not once offer to discount our meal or offer a solution.   

Upon returning to our table I clearly stated that I would not be paying for the food which he begrudgingly accepted, scoffed. ran our receipt and returned it to our table as if we had inconvenienced him.

As we left we received angry glares from the rest of the staff and heard him complain to another customer about our table.  My stomach hurt and my wife became physically ill about half hour after eating.  When we returned to get a copy of the receipt we asked them to check their chicken and they didn't seem to care. 

My recommendation as a consumer is to avoid this place at all costs. A week old, refrigerated, wrapped sandwich from 7Eleven would provide more satisfaction than anything this restaurant has to offer.  To the Jose Cuervo corporate folk I would recommend retraining your employees, closing the store completely, or rehiring friendly people who know the meaning of service.

This place definitely leaves a bad taste in the back of your throat and tarnishes the Jose Cuervo brand.",C388Aur4jGkZc_d9FvWSaQ,1,1,1,s6DU6_avJDTnQWe1dgCraQ
1957117,2012-03-16,0,2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg,"I'm going to be nice to this place because it is a regular haunt for me when I fly SWA through LAS since it is central to most of the gates in their terminal. I have always grabbed a seat at the bar and I have always found the bartenders there to be very nice. I see a lot of complaints about the waiters and that may be true... just one more reason to put your butt in that bar stool by the taps.

Let's get one thing straight first, this is *airport* food so your expectations for quality should be lowered and prices should be raised... no matter what. I grabbed a Subway sandwich in an airport once. $8.99 for a turkey sub that is $5 down the road from my house. So, yes, you will spend $10 on a beer or wine and it will be as large as a $4 pour at home. I don't like it either, but it is what it is when you're traveling. Don't want to pay high prices for standard grub? Pack a bag lunch.

Food here is OK for standard mexican stuff. The guac comes as a side for some dishes and I think that's more worth it than ordering that straight up as an appetizer. I usually stay away from the fried dishes, so I have had quesadillas and tacos there without being disappointed once.

You can get your drinks to go and they sometimes open up the very end of the bar for to-go drinks only... nice to be able to just walk around people watching with a brew between flights to kill time if you ask me.",FiLE54ia0H8qK8M8uNRTUQ,0,0,3,NUqqtkFnwT09hPikalyWXw

So I order it. Mine comes up out much smaller than the lady's. But it wasn't bad. The sauce had a lime cilantro taste, and the pork was soft.

2350732,2008-07-25,5,2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg,"I go to Las Vegas now and then for actual work meetings. On those trips, you can find me quick in a crowd - I'm the only female in the vicinity wearing clothes that offer modest coverage, looking very, very sober and very, very pale. 

As I result, I've become familiar with the Southwest terminal at McCarran, which is a pretty painful experience: crowded and loud, with poor people-traffic flow. And speaking of the other people, these thoughts often alternate in my head: 

1) ""Why are all these parents bringing small children to Las Vegas?"" 
2) ""Who invited all these tacky people to this airport?""

Back to the children, I'm often attempting to look as unfriendly as possible on the Southwest flight so no one with kids sits next to me. It's a useless effort, but a fight worth fighting to the bitter end. I choose a seat far in the back and unleash a campaign of intimidation - irritated snobby expression, weird flipping through high-end fashion magazine, gum chewing ... and often pretend-sniffling and nose-blowing. In my head, I think ""this activity makes me look very unfriendly. I'm a materialistic rude person with a cold. You don't want your kids to sit next to me."" The truth is, I'm a pushover who loves babies, just not loud babies in close proximity at 30,000 feet. 

Unfortunately, this attack plan never works. People see a nicely dressed petite business woman and think ""she probably smells okay. I'll sit next to her and take her arm rest.""

So these days, with the help of Tequileria, I bring in my last line of defense: booze. Ideally, after a quick trip to said Tequileria, you carry that telltale I've-had-a-cocktail scent as you squeeze into the boarding line. Parents would hopefully take note and not seat their kids next to the Drinking Lady. But then, if they still do, you're infused with 20 ounces of sixteen-dollar strawberry margarita and can't feel your soul. Surefire solution. 

Can't say I've had the food. Don't really like the crowded tables or airport-style service that has you wondering if someone will come take your order. But this is my ardent message to business travelers at McCarran - hit this place up pre-flight, because LAS to OAK via Southwest appears to carry a five-screaming-toddler minimum.

2447724,2010-08-01,0,2IvrdAb6zdxr3ZqplqJHbg,"HOLA! Greeted as if you were in ""Mexico"" Jose Cuervo's Tequileria tries to make you feel 'at home'here at the end of the C Terminal of the Las Vegas, McCarran Airport near Gate C16.

Ironically (and with good reason since its Jose Cuervo's Restaurant), the tequila choices are limited to Jose Cuervo Tequilas...

They play some good Spanish language music to put you in the mood to drink excessively and the food is extra tasty (meaning salty) to help induce thirst. What more can you expect to get in an airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. I ordered an ""Asada"" burrito with ""steak"" and got shredded beef, lettuce, cheese and salsa wrapped up in a warm tortilla. It is clear that their interpretation of Spanish words is questionable, but in the end, I was hungry and it was tasty (meaning salty) and had I been on a weekend long drinking binge in Sin City, I would have needed a burrito of this caliber to get me back to reality. Truly the one thing that doesn't stay in Vagas are the ailments (or diseases) which you acquire there.  

I ordered something simple, a beer, and was coerced into buying a 4 dollar Cuervo Silver Tequila Shot. I got the shot pretty quick, and began to sip on it... but the beer took about 20 minutes due to ""keg"" issues. Understandable, but I didn't get any ""we're sorry"" discount - Whatever, how often will I ever be here?

Overall, it's good if you have a two hour layover, in the Las Vegas McCarran Airport at Gate C16, but then, it's an airport and expecting an excellent restaurant with excellent service and selection is like asking for world peace: many will try, but it sure as hell will never happen. There is Wi-Fi available also if you want to catch up with your life while living your imaginary one in Vegas. And there is nothing more awesome than busting out your laptop and chatting with the world while enjoying a beer at the Las Vegas airport - I hear people really respect that. 

Beer + a shot + Tax and Tip = $15, I guess they never stop robbing you in this town. Burrito was $7 and about the size of a glorified spring roll.",zp1SqeOpb7OY54x-V6F1eQ,0,0,2,BDPPuRdnWNwZGMk2GG7dBA

Banana Margarita - There's no price on the drink menu, so my server said it was $14-$15, glad it only ended being $13.49.  The drink was good but came in a very small cup for the price.  

Chips and Guacamole - At almost $11 I figured, what the hey, it's going on the company expense report and it'll be my dinner.  It's the only thing I ordered and she brought out the wrong dish.  There was a delay in getting my receipt because she put in the right order but had to make a correction.  Instead she brought me Chips and Salsa, which was $6.49.  I said, ""I actually ordered Chips and Guacamole.""  She says she either take that back or she can add on a small side of guacamole for $1.89.  I don't have time for all this mess so I say, ""Just bring me a small side of guacamole.""  Well, the guacamole on the bill showed up as $2.89.  It was tiny!  Not to mention, it wasn't fresh made, nor was it packed a few days before at some local distributor, it was the canned stuff that was like a thick soup with no chunks of avocado.  The tortilla chips were like Mission Tortilla Chips, except triangular.  I hate Mission Tortilla Chips.

Enough of that, besides the basketball games, this place was nothing but uncomfortable.

WTF really? for a cup of premix and a shot of tequila. this place is pathetic. If someone is willing to pay $25 for a drink the least you could do is make it a good one. I hate this place...

During our layover, the closest place to our gate was this restaurant.  It really didn't even matter what the restaurant was, we would've eaten here anyway due to its proximity.  Luckily, it was Mexican food which I generally enjoy.

Started off with guacamole and chips.  Did not expect to receive the biggest dollop of guacamole I have ever been given by any restaurant ever in my life selling guacamole.  Holy cow.  It was creamy not chunky, which is fine.  Slightly over salted (according to my husband), but edible and filling.

We split the taquitos and the chicken tacos.  First of all the taquitos were very good.  Pretty decent portion too.  Very savory, nice flavor.  Satisfying in the way fried Mexican food can be satisfying.  As for the tacos, we got them on corn toritillas.  The plate came with three, and again, decent portion and very satisfying.  I liked my meal.  Did not leave feeling disappointed as far as the food goes.  It tasted pretty fresh, and looked pretty on the plate.

The service could use a tweak.  It took forever to be waited on, and then forever to receive the check.  But it was extremely packed in there, so perhaps that's the risk of dining in an airport restaurant.

I'm not sure what others were expecting when eating here.  I suppose we were just starving and ready to go home, so were easily pleased.  I dunno.  But our experience certainly wasn't awful or 1-2 star worthy.",5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ,0,0,3,Fts8HaO9Pw4R9ICGx2Dt7w

We wanted something to snack on so we opted for the nachos with chicken. They were pretty gross and also a big ripoff.

I'm jealous of the patrons behind me that got a better waitress,
I'm jealous of all the people that got breakfast before they made it to the airport,
I'm even jealous of the peeps eating Burger King for breakfast.

Bottom line, take your money elsewhere is you are deciding what to eat when you're in Gate C. First of all, the service was not good at all. No smiles, no hello's, and I even witnessed the more timid customers wait forever for their checks.  When you finally get service, make sure to order everything at once. I'm talking about your refills, extra sides, extra napkins, etc. This is a must since it's almost impossible to get your server's attention here. Eye contact, the finger wave, and ""excuse me"" just doesn't fly here.  I also think the servers have their invisible ear plugs and blinders on.  Or, i just have my invisible cloak on.  Whatever the reason, the service is just not what they preach here. However, service does improve when your check arrives.  My thoughts, it must be tip time. 

As for the food, it's just okay. The food looks better than it tasted. I got their Chicken Chipotle Torta with Chips.  This chicken sandwich was fine, but I decided to eat it bland with nothing on it. No taste, just your average chicken breast for about $10. I also finished all 5 pieces of their tortilla chips that they gave me as a side.

During a long flight delay, a few buddies & I went for some (rather tasty) Margaritas at the Tequileria. As we were ordering, our server, who for the purposes of this review will be known simply as ""Mr. Chips"", informed us that the margaritas we were ordering had ""1800 premium tequila and Grand Mariner, because that's all we have"". Slightly confused, we ordered said $13 margaritas and then asked if we could have a side of chips & salsa. Mr. Chips' response: ""No, sorry, all we have on the menu are nachos, do you want nachos?"" When we told him that nachos were too much food and that we just wanted a little thing of chips he said ""sorry, can't do that, so you want the nachos?"" and we were forced to call after him (he immediately started walking away) and tell him specifically NOT to get us nachos. When pressed later about the chips (after we saw another customer get a little thing of chips & salsa with his meal), Mr. Chips said ""nope, this is a union job, can't break the rules"" and still refused to sell us some lousy chips & salsa.

We sat there incredulously drinking our margaritas until the ladies sitting next to us tried to do the exact same thing. We overheard them discussing how the nachos were too much and how they just wanted a small order of chips to go with their beer, and couldn't help but start laughing. They looked over at us shocked, and we explained how the same thing had happened to us! Turns out the chip stunt wasn't so funny to them, because it seems Mr. Chips had been berating them earlier for no apparent reason, calling their eye color ugly (brown like #&@#) and generally being antagonistic.

If you're at the far end of Concourse C, you have few choices including Burger King, Nathans Famous and a few other fast food places. If you're actually looking for table service, Jose Cuervo's ""Tequileria"" is it. 

What is a ""Tequileria"", exactly? Is it a place inside of an airport that serves very overpriced margaritas that are mostly mix and Taco Bell quality food? Must be so, because that's what you're getting here.

Seating is ""seat yourself"". In a ""Tequileria"" setting that means grab an open table, which will probably be dirty and watch the staff desperately try not to make eye contact with you for a good 10 minutes. Eventually (maybe), one of them will make a mistake, accidentally acknowledge you and as a punishment, have to take your order. You might be worried about missing your flight but no fear, your food will come out INSTANTLY. No, it's not tequila infused ninjas in the back preparing your dish at lightning speed, everything is premade and thrown on a plate. 

My chicken tacos ($12) were literally indistinguishable from Taco Bell's Chicken Soft Tacos. Same cheap iceberg lettuce and ""shredded cheese"" toppings. Some Fire Sauce would have been appreciated because these mofos are bland. I'd say skip the food but honestly, there's really not much better in this concourse.

Two stars - one for being the only sit down place in C, the seconds because my dinner did not result in The Troubles on my 3.5 hour flight home. 

Also, note to self - rent a space in the airport, buy a bunch of Taco Bell meal kits and call myself a ""tequileria"" = PROFIT.",PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,4,4,2,RJdqWHgBsJxyp2YVC6zGVQ

The drink = TERRIBLE. I've had $3 happy hour margaritas that were better than this $13.49 slushy machine drink. Seriously a waste of money and time. Minimal flavor, minimal alcohol at a very UN-minimal price.

The food = GOOD. I ordered my chimichanga with shredded pork, rice, refried beans, roasted corn, crema, queso fresco and green chili salsa. It was a large portion and surprising very good. In fact I liked it so much that I had it boxed up and carried it back to San Diego with me to finish off when I got home.

Since this was on my way OUT of Sin City instead of on my way IN, I was no naive sap:

Me: ""How much is the Mangorita?"" (drink prices are ODDLY not listed on the menu)

Waiter: ""One Mangorita.""

Me: ""No.  How MUCH DOES IT COST?""

Waiter: ""$12""

Me:  ""That's what I thought.  I'll have a Mangorita, please.""

Hey, you expected me NOT to get it? 

Actually, for Vegas prices, this was quite reasonable (who would have imagined that food and drinks would be CHEAPER at the airport than in the city you're visiting?).  The Mangorita surprisingly tasted like REAL and FRESH mango instead of some artificial ""mango"" syrup.  It was blended and slightly sweet but not syrupy and served in a pint glass. Also, the waiter claimed it had a double shot of tequila and while I couldn't taste it, I sure as hell felt it.  

Woo!  Drunk plane ride!  Yay!

I also ordered the chicken chimichanga.  As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.  It was filled with plenty of shredded chicken but also with shredded lettuce.  Um, WILTED shredded lettuce.  Bleh again.

The chips tasted like they came from a bag opened yesterday instead of being made on site. The salsa tasted like it may have been made last week by my mother who considers black pepper to be ""too spicy"" to add to her food. Triple bleh!

One last bit of super USEFUL info: this is ONLY a good option if you've got PLENTY of time before your flight.  

Our meal took over an HOUR.  The waiter came over, took our drink order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back, took our food order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our drinks, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our water, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our food, said ""right away"" when I asked him to bring the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, brought the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back for the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with the receipt to sign.  I have no idea if he came back to pick up the signed receipt because we didn't wait around another 10 minutes.

I had to google it!!  (I need a shirt with this business name on it!!)  I digress...

You walk in, and it's definitely a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but I feel like coming to the defense of this place for some reason.  

It's loud and full of travelers and suitcases and people are LEAVING Las Vegas and hung over and cranky and none of this is necessarily the places fault.  I sat down and did notice how dirty everything felt and looked.  There were scraps of paper and receipts on the floor, the table surfaces were greasy and the menus were yucky.  I think that all can and should be fixed by spending a little on labor after hours for some deep cleaning.  Shame on you guys for not doing a better job there.  Because of all this I sat down expecting to be disappointed but with realistic expectations.  

I seated myself and waited a short time before someone came to take an order.  I ordered.  The food came.  The staff was not especially friendly but not unfriendly either.  I'm not sure it could be much better with people dragging their suitcases around walking around confused.  

My plate of food landed on the table and I wanted to hate it - well - because this is the El Sleazo Cafe right?  

My fish tacos were good!  They were fresh, NOT fishy at all and well seasoned.  The beans and rice were good too.  I couldn't find a problem with any of it.  

The bill came and I had a mixed reaction.  I only ordered two items, a beer in draft and TWO fish tacos and my total was $26.80 before tip.  That's pricey, but it's a Las Vegas airport diner.  Can I be mad?  I guess.  Kinda.  

The other thing I noticed about the bill is that server Alba had written Thank You with a happy face in it.  It's al lay like a secret message that said, ""Send help!  I'm a hostage!""  You know?  Like I think she's doing the best she can and she was perfectly kind to me and did a great job, it just looks like a busy, busy, tough crowd.  

So, is it overpriced?  Yeah.  Is it a fantastic dining experience?  No.  was my food good?  Ya.  My beer was cold and yummy.  

Maybe I'm getting soft, but I couldn't help but feel like the staff at the El Sleazo Cafe is doing the best hey can, and it's hard, and the food is pretty good, and it's a little expensive, but it's in an airport and it's really busy and considering all that I was pleased and the experience was good.  Thanks Alba and team.  Keep up the good work, I know it's hard in there!

Anyway, me being the world traveler myself (if you consider U.S. the world which many Americans do), stopped by the Tequileria for lunch before my flight back to L.A.  By the way, Southwest boarding system is awful!!  The Tequileria is, like many airport spots, overpriced and underwhelming.  It's not uncommon these days to find pretty good food at airports these days.  I've gone to a couple spots in Dulles that were quite good.  This is not one of them.

I ordered just a plate of carne asada tacos, which comes with 3 typical food truck-size tacos.  Beef was tender but sauce was not great, and the tortilla was too dry.  Not enough cilantro and chili that would really make the flavor.  I've gotten used to a particular style that makes this dish very predictable and quite satisfying, but theirs is different and not for the better.  A good size Dos Equis is always good, so that helped to wash it down.

The service is again typical airport; not rude but not necessarily pleasant, not slow but not in a hurry.  Decor is sufficiently festive, with lots of TVs.

Compared to the world at large, well, you're better off eating just about anywhere else. 

I was recently faced with a six hour layover in Vegas, courtesy of my friends at Spirit Airlines, who are unable to get their $hit together. I figured I'd make the best of it and get drunk at the airport, and have a last go at Mexican food before heading back to Boston.

This is the kind of airport gouging that I sometimes find infuriating... no chips and salsa at the table, $10 cocktails, no side salads, etc. Other times I grit my teeth and say nothing, but with such a long layover and such terrible options overall, well, I really just wanted to get out of Vegas.

I ordered a double vodka soda ($15), a full-sized Caesar salad ($9, no side salads as an option here) and a carne asada burrito ($12 I think, maybe $15).  The drink was strong but nothing was especially good about the meal. 

Side note here: Logan Airport, in Boston, has a law against price gouging at the airport. Just because you're a captive behind TSA security lines doesn't mean you should have to spend $60 on lunch.

As I was eating the burrito, I kept thinking that something in the seasoning was really familiar. It took a long time for me to recognize it, but that flavor was Taco Bell, which I haven't eaten in about twenty years. So yeah, this isn't great Mexican fare. 

Another double vodka soda later, and a few bucks lighter, I was ready to take a nap in the long walkway between terminals. If there are any entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity to open a restaurant in Vegas that serves something other than Taco Bell beef or deep fried everything, I recommend scouting locations in this busy airport! It might be expensive to rent here, but if what you serve is even halfway decent, you'll make a killing.",2y4EC2UKWwzj33OpK17Edw,2,0,3,8tVuwWX9bgZx3zd35xMRTg
