102399,2012-06-20,1,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"This review is strictly for this LOCATION ONLY! I love Applebees and go there several times a month. I've given this location a chance 3 times. They have awful service and its not like I have gotten the same server each time. No, different one each time. The last time I went there I wait 5 minutes for a refill on my soda while my waiter knew I needed another soda but he decided to hang out in the bar. Maybe he was waiting on another customers drink to be made and he had to watch over the bartender to make sure he was making it right. Who knows. Everytime I go there I have an issue with the service. Im honestly NOT a demanding person or really anal. I just like a server who remembers Im there. Again just this location. I will now just go to the one on sunset and stephanie MUCH better service.
The resturaunt itself has decent pricing. Typical for a resturaunt. Expect to spend thirty bucks or so for 2 people. Even with the 2 for $20. The food... I cant say much as I had only tried 3 things on the menu and then got addicted to the firepit burger... If you get it ask for extra chipotle-mayo, its amazing! Everytime I go there I tell myself today is the day I will try something new but when the server comes, firepit burger just rolls off my tongue. Never been disappointed with it.",Bv90ylpk5xZhNqD4pEtXDA,3,2,1,ZK_t3xdmQnD7INsS3YiHTQ

354446,2015-02-14,1,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"first of all, sorry for my english...i'm italian...
we were at AB this evening with my wife. tiffany was our server. while we were sitting, she passed 3 times saying that she needed ""only a minute"" to take our order, while she was talkjing with other customers.
i ordered a 9oz sirloin with baked potatoes with NO BUTTER. 
after 15 minutes i found on my dish a 4.5oz sirloin with a stone of butter with some potato on it. 
i call tiffany explaining the problem. instaed to change my dish immediately, she discussed that i didn't want only sour sauce...wtf but i said NO BUTTER....
she said that she would have changed only the potato, leaving a gross quantity of melted butter on my dish. while i was waiting for my brand new potato, my 4.5oz sirloin was getting cold. not good appearance, my medium sirloin actually was a well done sirloin.
the dessert time was approaching quickly, in my mind there was the idea that my triple chocolate cake would have been stunning. 
i ordered that with a different pronounciation of the ""i"" letter of the word ""triple"".
tiffany, very pleasantly, put her ear close to the table like ""i ain't get ya, bro"", for 3 times.
while we were tasting our desserts, we heard her saying to another table that other customers didn't leave her the tip, saying that very loud.
anyway we left a 15% tip, so she won't say the same about us to other future customers.
thank you guys, we didn't appreciate your service tonight...aND we'll never come again!!!",iFHNdLoxcDWyiVU5nL_Fag,1,0,1,5X4CbnpZg5vA2196hhmgNA
364504,2013-05-21,0,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"Other than a taco bell, this is the closest eatery near my house and truly is my neighborhood grill and bar.  We made a very last minute decision to eat here on Mother's Day night - arriving around 8pm to a very busy and bustling restaurant.  The business seemed a bit odd - I have never seen it this busy before and I think the staff hadn't either.  The service was a bit disorganized and slow.  The food was just A-OK.  

Our food was simply okay - nothing spectacular here.  I tried a new chicken and shrimp dish served over spicy mexican rice.  It was good - but the shrimp are not the same shrimp seen on the menu cover!  Much smaller!  I had two very overpriced margaritas as well.  

While we will visit this location in the future because it's near our house, we try to visit during happy hour times to save a few dollars on what can be very overpriced drinks.  

We prefer to dine during their lunch times and take advantage of their lunch specials.",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,0,0,3,zhRrH3CXqDM5OTfaCfakHw

1) There was a party of loud drunk older women screaming every 2 seconds!!!  Please it is only Applebee's. Not a club. 

2) Happy hour has different drink specials.  Not impressed. We would have drank more  but drinks tasted weak and watered down    Changed cup size on hubby's beer and is even more expensive. 

3)  They must have a new cook. Food is not like it used to be.  We all ordered stuff with fries and there were like 5 pieces of fries on each plate. Really!  Fries are cheap!!!  Salad was over dressed and too much croutons.  My son had a piece of lettuce core in his salad. Come on. Quality control!!!  Why would you serve me trash?

We do really appreciate the girls who served us were really nice especially since we had to deal with the drunks interrupting our meal. Jason was awesome and gave us a discount for having to deal with that crap the whole meal. Good looking out for your other paying customers!!!  That's the only reason they got the 2 stars. 

Some advice?  Fix your food ASAP!  We used to come on a weekly basis but this may have been the last time. :-(",X5A_vtJh_PTQgQ5pmluCqg,1,1,2,onlhhbZ4sYJLiLl4B62wTA

I live literally walking distance away from this location and let's just say that's the only reason it is getting 2 stars. 

They constantly mess up my pick up order. Whether it be forgetting sides, making my food incorrectly, giving me the ingredients for my French onion soup I ordered in separate containers (so I can make it myself ?) there is always something. 

I literally drive to the location on fort Apache and 215 ( a good 15-20 min drive) just to avoid dealing with this location.

659034,2014-12-21,0,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"This was bad experience from the start. We had a party of 3 (my wife, my father and myself). There were at least 4 open booths in plain view from the waiting area. It wasn't terribly busy. The hostess wouldn't sit me and my wife until the third person in my party arrived. She said she was sorry but they are busy. I insisted on being sat and she looked as though I peed in her morning coffee. 

Once sat, we met our waitress. Which was one of the three times we talked to her all night. She took our drink order, didn't see her until she took our dinner order, then another time to get a refill on our drinks (which we had to ask for from one of the managers since we hardly saw our waitress. 

I think part of the trouble is this new system from Applebee's with the touch screens at each table. From this screen, you can order your dinner, ask for refills, pay your bill and a few other functions. I really wish when we sat down or first met the server they gave a quick rundown on all I could do. It's great you can do all these things, but I had to ""request"" a refill via the touch screen. Our waitress passed our table several times and never once actually talked to us to see if we would like a refill. 

The food was ok. It wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't terrible. The best part of the entire experience was being able to pay the bill at the table. The worst of it is that I've been to this same Applebee's a few years back, and the service was terrible then as well. Bad service is weighing this location down.",1azEJGjbcC6E0YHin51t1w,0,0,1,pfsUta4NFMmqBoT3jrSqZw

They brought out a small plate knowing there were six of us. How were we going to eat the chips and dip? Pour the dip in our hands and dip the chip into our palm? My cousins wife's drink was done sort of Sangria with cranberry in it. She took one sip and realized how disgusting it was. The floor manager nor two orlther waitresses noticed we were missing more plates, bread for the pasta and that the big sangria drink was still full. This was a slow Sunday night by the way. It was barely even busy. I would not recommend this place.

When we first walked in the hostess barely said hello. Not how many, not I'll be right with you. Once she did speak to us it took her another 10 minutes to bus our table. 
Our server was nice. We put our orders in and it took about 15 minutes for 2 appetizers. The steak soup was disgusting. It had a weird smell and strange color. Out chips and salsa was definitely skimping. I ordered a side Cesar salad because they were out of Italian dressing. The salad literally had like 10 pieces of lettuce. I asked about the size and the response was ""it looks small because it's on a big plate, we're out of small ones"" mmmmk. 
Once our food came they forgot 1 of our party of fives. It never even made it to the kitchen. They were gracious enough to remove it from the bill but his food took another 15 minutes or so. 
The food was all cold. The mushrooms were clearly canned and not even warm and had a gray color to them. 
Worst food ever and worst money ever spent. We asked if the cook was new since we saw a minimum of 5 other people send back food and our server said he had been there about 4 weeks and even hindering her from doing her job. 
I didn't complain about the food since they already comped the burger and I already asked for Warner items and so many other people were sending back food, seemed pointless. Now that I think about it I should have just sent it all back and went somewhere else. What a waste of $60 for garbage food.

I ordered the Southwest Jalepano Burger. The burger I got didnt look anything like the burger they have on their menu. Looks like they put some jalepanos in a jar of gelatin or something then when someone orders this burger they just pour it on the patty. Im sorry but for a ten dollar burger I couldve went to Burger King and got there Angry Whopper meal for a few dollars less and it probably would've tasted better. Also the fries were at least a day old. They were so stale and hard. They also skimped on the fries. My philosophy is if you can see the plate behind the fries then they didnt give you enough. After I ate I was still hungry. My wife wasnt happy with her meal either. She got some kind've wrap but it looked like some day old thing that you can get at Vons or some place like that.

Did not take long to get the appetizer. It was good but, it did look as if the bowl was put in microwave to reheat it because of the burned edges on the bowl. We still eat it anyway and it was ok.
When the salads came they were HUGE!! We asked for extra dressing on the side because it was kinda dry and the chicken was little over cooked. However we still enjoyed our outing with great service.

I ordered the whiskey bbq bacon burger and a Pepsi.  The burger was was topped off with onion string which I liked.  The burger overall was ok.  A little dry but yet oily.  The bbq sauce was a bit tangy.  It didn't have enough sauce so I asked for a side of sauce.  The fries was decent.

2746734,2016-02-28,1,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"Going to Applebee's after work for happy hour seemed like a good decision. I remember loving the Orlando location by my former university. I came here with the intentions of a 1 to 2 hour meal with a few co-workers. However, this turned into closer to a 3 hour experience due to slow service. I got the boneless hot wings and the wanton chicken tacos. I am pretty sure the hot wings were straight from a freezer because of the texture of the breading. The quality of the food I had from the happy hour menu was not too great, and thankfully I only paid happy hour prices. My happy hour margarita was just okay. The worst part was the service. The waiter stopped by our table only occasionally and walked off a few different times before taking the entire party's order. 

     At the end, when it came time for me to cash out, the waiter brought our checks out with the orders not separated right. This wouldn't be a problem, if the following did not occur. The waiter went to go make the needed corrections, but then she comes back 15 minutes later and tells us to use the touch pad to pay on the table. There is a touchpad available, but no-one explains how to use it. At this point, other than to bring the food, the wait staff would be better replaced by the touch pad anyways. 

    Will I come back? Only if it's my co-workers birthday and they choose to go to this place. However, I would never choose to come here when the decision is solely in my hand.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,3,2,1,3BHNuxBgiB10M31Rg2MOSw
2784313,2015-10-28,0,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"I'm so torn!!! Does excellent customer service out weigh not liking some of the food?

So I used to love Applebee's in the 90's and early 2000's. Good food and drinks. I think back then it was all about Applebee's Chillies and Fridays. Wow what a down grade. The menu is limited to mostly processed and pre-made foods. 

I walked in on my lunch hour saw a blonde girl she greeted me and said the host will be right with you. Hostess came another blonde but she had glasses. Walker towards the bar area asked if I wanted to sit at the bar I said no. I was sat on the bright side of Applebee's. It was so bright from the sun that I was blinded if I sat normal and the shades were pulled down. It also made my booth hot. I took a picture everyone who was seated here was complaining about it. 

My server Christopher came up right away. Btw the hostess said Michael would be my server. I hope there is a Michael working there or that's just plain rude not learning the servers names. Anyway he is sooo attentive and so nice. I would say he was a great server. I ordered an iced tea with lemon. When he returned he told me that on Mondays the cheese burgers are half off. So I looked at them again. I really wanted a regular burger. Didn't see one so I ordered the bacon burger and added pickles. I chose regular fries and I ordered the pot stickers which came with peanut sauce and an oil with chili flakes that they called pot sticker sauce. Christopher asked if I wanted the pot stickers first. I told him I was on my lunch and just to bring out what is ready first. 

He came back with my check and said no rush but I know how it is when you are on your lunch and also I can get you an iced tea to go. BEST SERVER EVER!!!! Finally someone who gets it! I only have an hour and I hate waiting for my check. Generally I ask for my check when ordering. This time I forgot and usually they don't do it anyways, so I have to wait 15 minutes for my check and pay. Not this time!!! I whipped out my card and paid before I even got my food. 

First the pot stickers came out. They are obviously processed and come frozen in a bag. They are tiny but there are a bunch of them. The peanut sauce is good. Just get a double dose of that. Right after was burger I ordered medium well. I think if I ordered it well it would have come out medium well. It was a bit pinker than I like. I don't send food back unless necessary. So I ate most of it the fries were over seasoned. I should have went with the sweet potato fries like he suggested. I finished my meal it was paid for Christopher asked if I wanted a tea to go and I said yes and a to go menu if they have one. He said they are by the hostess stand. He came back with my tea and made the hostess bring me a menu (they weren't stocked) she practically ran with a menu.

My daughter wanted to go to Applebee's tonight so we went to the one on Warm Springs and Pollock. I ordered the Cedar Salmon and my three year old had the Mac and Cheese off of the kids menu. 

   When our drinks came, the diet Pepsi was completely flat and gross. I asked the server to take it off the bill and I just drank my water. He took it off and had no followup with me about what he did to correct the problem. I guess the next gut was getting a flat soda too.

    The reason I ordered the Cedar Salmon was that the picture looked so appealing. When the 
dish arrived it was 1/4 of the size of the picture in the menu (Pictures Attached). I asked the waiter where the rest of my dinner was and he said, ""That's the way it comes"". My daughters Mac and cheese was obviously the box version of Craft Mac and Cheese, because they didn't mix the cheese powder thoroughly and you could see the dry powder on the pasta (Gross).

First off, a couple of years ago my wife and I went here we had an issue with undercooked food & bad service.  We were later given a survey and the manager ended up contacting us and giving us a gift card for the next time we were in.  

A year later we ended up using the gift card in part to get some burgers to go. We ordered online, specified exactly what we wanted on the burgers, and my wife picked it up.  Apparently ""plain with meat, cheese, and bun"" means slather some thousand island on the burgers, because that's what they did.  Unfortunately my wife didn't notice this until she got back home and had to go back to get the corrected order.

Just the other night we went again and ordered an appetizer and a couple of entrees.  The entrees were different and the sides were different.  They put the wrong sides with the wrong entrees.  My wife eats broccoli and I do not.  To me the smell of it makes me want to vomit.  The manager is the one who brought out our food and I pointed out to him that the wrong sides were on the wrong plate and that broccoli weirds me out.  He said he could take the plate back and get the right side on there and ""it would only take a minute.""  Basically he indicated that to correct the problem he was going to scrape the broccoli off and put the right side on.  

No, I do not want the rest of my food covered in broccoli juice.  My wife and I just ended up swapping entrees.

We arrived at about 7 pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty full. The layout was weird so we weren't sure at first if it was ""seat yourself"" or whether we should wait for a hostess to appear. We chose to wait and it took an uncomfortable amount of time before a hostess finally deigned to seat us. 

When we sat down, our table had no silverware and was sticky. We'd watched the hostess wipe it down but the weird residue that the rag left made me uncomfortable all night. 

Our server swung by our table to tell us she'd be right back to take our order, but then she didn't come back for a really long time. When she did, she seemed rushed and asked us what food we wanted without even offering us drinks. We corrected her, ordered drinks, and then soups for an appetizer. 

The french onion soup was meh at best. The flavor was off, it wasn't particularly hot, and the cheese was obviously low quality. When our food came out, we had to ask for silverware and napkins before we finally got them. 

The entrees were definitely the best part of the meal. My boyfriend absolutely loved his burger and my pasta was okay. The chicken on top was definitely the best part. 

When our bill came, it was around $50 for 2 sodas, two soups, and two entrees, which surprised me. There wasn't a mistake but for the quality we received, I kind of expected it to be less. When we go to Chili's or TGI Fridays and order similar meals, we get bigger portions and higher quality food for usually about $40.

4052558,2013-05-15,6,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.  

Met some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something. 

As for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry. 

Overall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.

4246624,2018-01-14,0,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"Worst experience ever!! My fiancée and two children went to have dinner last night at this Applebees, it was our first and last time there!! There server didn't introduce herself I still don't know her name!! Not to mention we waited a good 6 to 8 minutes before even being talked to!! She approached our table and asked us what we wanted to drink while taking my kids orders she became very impatient and rolled her eyes when my son was undecided about what he wanted!! Mind you my children are 11 and 8 it wasn't as if I was allowing a toddler to order his own drink!! Right after getting out drink orders she immediately asked what we were eating!! Again rolling her eyes and being very visibly annoyed with my children as they ordered!! We ordered everything at once (drinks appetizers and entrees) to make it easy and because we sat so long we knew what we wanted!! When our server brought us out drinks she brought me the wrong drink I didn't say anything and just dealt with it!! We didn't see the server again until our appetizers came out!! She brought us steak wonton tacos with no side plates!! Not once did she check on us after dropping the tacos!! Mind you we need refills side plates and extra napkins!! We asked another server and got our refills and plates!! Our food arrived shortly after and the host who brought us out food handed my 8 year a heavy plate causing him to almost drop a hot bowl of Mac and cheese all down the front of him and again we sat and waited for things we needed!! The sauce that was forgotten and eventually a refill on our plates!! (We ordered the all you can eat special)After looking right at us and my fiancée trying to get her attention and her turning her head I asked to speak to a manager!! The manager Michelle came over I explained to her what was wrong and requested a new server!! Michelle apologized and got us what we needed including a new server!! Ok all could have been forgiven had my next plate of food not have come out cold and the wrong flavor!!  The new server was really nice but almost seemed to be annoyed that she had to pick up another table that wasn't hers!! And not to mention we only saw her twice once to introduce herself and again to drop off our check which of course was wrong as well!! The appetizer we ordered was suppose to be half off but wasn't discounted on our check!! We didn't even bother talking to the manager again as she was all over the place and the restaurant was a mess!! We could hear other guests complaining about the same server and the horrible service!! Although Michelle was very kind and said sorry she also kept saying it's busy!! Like duh it's Friday night of course it's busy!! Being a server myself I was disappointed that Michelle the manager didn't do the little extra to help make us happy!! Maybe follow up with us or sense she was sooo busy maybe offered us dessert!! We would have even paid for the dessert we were never offered?! After switching servers I feel like we became a problem and the focus was to get us out other then making us happy!! I felt very uncomfortable and will NEVER be returning to this restaurant again!!!",oL5cGIx8mkRMfmBxaZrRPA,0,0,1,D1288NNHpkTc55LK5nTRFQ

The people are so nice and my food is always on point! I usually get a 8oz top sirloin with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I never fails. Our second fave is the Bourbon chicken and shrimp.

4540202,2018-04-07,4,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,"Two stars may be too generous for this place.  I met 3 friends here and when the waiter brought their drinks he asked if I wanted a drink and I asked for a water with lemon....I got the water but no lemon.  About 5 minutes or more later he came back and asked if we were ready and some were still deciding so he said he would come back.  I asked him for lemon a second time....

About 10 minutes went by and he finally came back to take our order.  The ladies ordered first, then my friend and then the waiter started to walk away without taking my order???  My friend looked at him and asked why he was not taking my order?  His response was oh I'm sorry I didn't realize I didn't get it, REALLY???  4 people, you only took 3 orders, is it rocket science???  So I placed my order and again asked for lemon a third time.  This time he finally brought the lemon.

When the food came one of the ladies ordered a Grilled Chicken Caesars, my friend he ordered a burger and fries and asked for mustard and mayo on the side.  Needless to say, the salad was NOT a Grilled Chicken Caesars but a regular Cobb style salad wth chicken.  No mustard or mayo came to the table either.  We let the person delivering know and he said he would tell our server.  Needless to say the server never came by to check and see if everything was ok and we had to ask another person for the mayo and mustard.  I also had to ask for more water because it was never refilled.  

Overall the food was just ok, nothing I would go back for and the service was lousy.  The waiter did not pay attention to anything and I would NOT recommend this place at all.  We were all dissatisfied, but this was not my choice to go here, my friends wanted to....I will not go back unless I have to meet someone there but I will do my best to talk them into going somewhere else with better food and much better service.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,13,4,2,MUdY3p4tZnsdCYveqXTOAQ

5094534,2014-07-26,0,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,This place is close to my house so we go there sometimes when we don't want to cook. This time it was Friday at lunchtime. They were pretty busy. We ordered the pick two lunch combos. I got a Caesar salad with 1/2 of a clubhouse grill. My husband got the same but with tomato soup. The good was delicious. The only problem was that my husband had a piece of waxed paper in his sandwich. You know... The kind that go in between cheese slices when you buy it. The Server apologized and we laughed. She brought him another. It bothered us a bit that  the manager didn't come over and it would have been kind of nice to have a bit deducted off of his meal but that did not happen. We are not high maintenance picky people by any means. It just would have been nice to show a little bit better customer service there.,1M7qbeQoL8O5r_cUVEuKEw,1,0,3,Ta3EnoDOTcAo3UNh7Ci6zQ

5197748,2016-12-17,0,qRhxldX3lnOMJUNlytYvfQ,I usually don't write a review but my experience here with my family more than once has been horrible! We live externally close to this location yet every time we come for dinner the service we receive is terrible. Megan was our server and John to my understanding is the manager and during our entire dinner we were checked on one time and IT WAS NOT EVEN BUSY. They were too busy having personal conversations behind the bar. I ordered a drink and NEVER received it! If we wanted something to go along with our food we had to make the attempt to track down a server. This was not how we wanted to spend our dinner and I highly advise you and your family to go else where and spend your money at a restaurant that appreciates your business. Next time we will travel the distance to a different location and refuse to ever come back here!!,lnITAhSPLI6IPD1UkjN0pA,0,0,1,BjMQalNdYTjrBdxs8UJ4Fg

The steak was almost flavorless, the broccoli was waaay overcooked and yet somehow served cold, and the french onion soup tasted like beef bullion with extra salt.

I had a 25$ giftcard so I paid $1.62 and I still feel ripped off.
