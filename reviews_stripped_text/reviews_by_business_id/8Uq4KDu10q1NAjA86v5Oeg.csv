You're in and out in less than five minutes. Beautiful. As long as it's never busy I will always go to this one,ghIZ0m3DFDABY-oNof6fvA,0,0,5,0rpNGoGJXweav8BCf-g1uw

There was two young employees making sandwiches. One of the employee was on the taller side. Our problem was with the shorter employee. I have no other way to describe them because they were not wearing name tags. It was all fine and they were both very nice and polite but the problem was when we were checking out and the employee took our money and give us our change with the gloves on and then as I was walking out I notice that he never changed the gloves then he started stocking all the veggies sticking his hand with the dirty glove in the food containers. I was so surprised by what was happening I didn't think about going back and telling him just to give me my money back because who knows if he did the same thing and made change with the same gloves right before he made my sandwich. 
Of course the more I thought about it the more I could not eat that sandwich and there went some money to waste.",tV-q3aoHwTt6UgqKwDArjQ,0,0,1,i_fnNcjKAbpTH2F46uUKOQ

The staff member making the sandwiches also was the assistant manager and he said that he only knew part of the order because the receipt tape ran out of the printer and he didn't get the details of the rest of the sandwich order. Had I not known what my coworker had ordered I would have had to drive back to work ask her what was on her sandwich and then drive back to Subway because I had already paid for these two sandwiches which subway had taken my money out of my account but didn't make the sandwiches because of a printing issue at the franchise restaurant. Luckily I have an excellent memory and I remembered exactly how she wanted her tuna wrap. I asked the asst manager if I couldn't remember would he have funded my money for the one sandwich and he said corporate would have to refund me because I ordered online. It's ridiculous that a problem created at the franchise level is rectified Days Later by corporate. We finally got our wraps thanks to me not Subway and I will not be ordering via online or maybe ever from this location because my time is important but Subway doesn't think so.,IdowgjiMa62IHT4x2Pn63g,1,0,1,121UHe3zMNHUGbR3RAVyLg

They were out of peppercinis, provolone cheese, vinegar and they no longer offer spicy mustard (only in packets) ... and on top of that the female had a real shitty attitude..",3ujMC8uPnk4OPrt6RYG2kg,0,0,1,O4-c2meoSiwwsGP210f3-g

Lately in the busy days of December when I put in a substantial amount of hours at work, by the time I clock out I am totally exhausted and not in the mood to eat out or cook dinner. It appears that I am just in the mood for Subway.

One of the things that I appreciate about Subway is that I can pick up my sub at 2 pm then when I get home place it in the fridge and a couple of hours later before I go to bed ahead of another long day at work that sub tastes as good as when the sub artist prepared it.

During the most recent workathons I can write that I am on a Subway diet. The diet consists of a foot long black forest ham and a Miller Genuine Draft before falling asleep listening to a podcast. My Subway diet is inexpensive and filling. The foot long black forest ham is a good deal. At $6.22 after tax it is approximately the same price as a rostere chicken at Smith's or a couple dollars more than a frozen dinner. This is far more than black forest ham between two pieces of multi grain bread. In a sense, my Subway diet isn't truly a diet because I load up the sub with pepper jack cheese, olives, jalape√±os, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, peppers, light mayonnaise, oil, mustard, black pepper and other delectable ingredients.

 This very Subway sits in a small strip mall at the northwest corner of Pecos Road and Patrick Street by a Home Depot. This is one of a few Subways with a drive-thru. If I am not mistaken it was formerly Java Detour. I never used the drive-thru, however, my friend told me that when she used it it took 15 minutes to make the sandwich and they messed up the sandwich. On the contrary, as I will state later, I had positive experiences ordering my sub to go inside. 

  In my opinion, the one flaw is entering and leaving the parking lot from eastbound Patrick Street. The flaw is that if you want to turn left into the parking lot, there is a concrete median divider before the entrance. If somebody is a reckless driver, unfortunately they will drive on the wrong side of Patrick Street to enter the parking lot. The correct way to enter the parking lot from eastbound Patrick Street is to turn left onto Sagebrush Street then turn right and continue across a parking lot. Once near Subway there is sufficient parking.

  When I visited this Subway the kids working here have been fast and friendly. They made my black forest ham sub the way I like it. And they made it fast without skipping on the ingredients.

During my most recent workathons that can leave me exhausted, the Subway diet works for me. This is a convenient Subway to sustain that diet.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,15,4,LnokXlntpnSqDr-Dq5i4PA
