Not like I had to eat the napkins to get filled up but my friend shared her salad with me which was definitely big enough for two!
Margo served up the drinks at the bar which  my favorite pineapple and Malibu rum with splash of Bacardi.

But, the one thing they had going for them was their menu. Full of wonderful comfort food. That has completely changed. Gone are the various delicious roast beef sandwiches and other items that they always had. Now it's just a single sided menu with standard burgers, etc... Last I was in there I thought I'd be safe with the standard breakfast. It was gross. No choice of meat, just pork belly (not a fan of eating pure fat). The potatoes were deep fried balls of what seemed to be mashed potatoes but way salty. No toast, just these store bought sweet rolls. It may be ok for a place to grab a beer or something but don't bring your appetite. Goodbye Blue Ox.",yP43JK9rhIOdHCjW5g7eSA,0,0,1,77-_NCb3MMzGDXTLkgonkw

I am not much of a bar person and don't drink often but sometimes it's social. When a friend wants to chat over a drink I choose this place because it is walking distance to my house. Since I don't drink often I walk home after having just one. I got started on breakfast here when I had to walk back to get my car the next morning anyway and I was surprised the breakfast hit the spot. Everyone is friendly and I've never had a problem or felt uncomfortable drinking here and then walking home alone. It feels relaxed unlike a lot of local bars where I feel I need to watch my back a little. Been stopping in lately for breakfast even without leaving my car the night before and haven't been disappointed.

Go where the locals go.
An amazing spot hidden in a strip mall on Sahara. 
Maybe not the curb appeal  you're looking for but it's what's inside that counts.
Great staff. Have to say nate and Brittany make everyone that walk through the doors feel like family. 
That's how it feels ,like you're at the family house for eats and drinks.
The cheese curds (personal fav). And green beans started out the quenching of the appetite. 
On to the specials. Orange chicken on rice Was delicious. Changing nightly.
Burgers ,I believe they won or should win The Best of Vegas. 
Speaking of quenching . you'll never be bored with Nates ability to serve you an upd and coming cocktail. A true genius .
Of course beer and wine.
Oh did I mention that the games and slot tourneys are winner winner.

Chicken wings: order them tossed in the sauce, and you won't be disappointed. Buffalo is a tasty Franks mix and comes with a generous portion of fries. 

Chili: When it's available, pretty good and very meaty. Needs a little Tabasco for my tastes, but excellent with extra onion on top. 

Surf and turf: recently changed to a ribeye and always with walleye. Cooked perfectly. 

Grilled cheese with ham: if you want to die happy of a cheese overdose, buy this. Oh my goodness good.",_5tVs8qUE-HgcpDmWO3Vtw,1,1,5,Lmw7nU9eRdaQAiXR-WTIkw

I should have known better! This is a Minnesota-themed tavern which means everyone is Minnesota nice. The wait staff is kind and courteous, the patrons are fun and sociable and of course the food was excellent!

We watched a preseason game between the Vikings and the Seahawks, Vikes won of course, it wasn't too loud or rowdy and no one had anything negative to say towards the other team or any patron who happened to not be rooting for the Vikings.

Based on my visits, Blue Ox must not be a dive bar because none of those things can be found here! Space is a bit dated but clean, and staff is downright peppy. Food is low-priced and fresh. 

COBB SALAD: Generous portions of all ingredients, wish the dressing were served in a cup and made in-house rather than takeout packets.* But having the calorie count handy does make me use less.
ALL BEEF JALAPENO CHILI: Ask to add sour cream, onions, and cheese to make this meaty dish into a meal. Good flavor without being spicy. This would be even better if they had some sort of cornbread.
FISH & CHIPS: Two smallish pieces of fresh-fried fish, crispy and flavorful. Fries are crinkle-cut but also surprisingly good. House-made tartar sauce is just right, malt vinegar available too (in a packet again).

They have a few specials, like walleye on Fridays and ribs on Saturdays. Ask about their Mules Around the World drinks. Back of dining area has a separate meeting space available to reserve. Staff is always cheerful, music is a good mix of 90s alternative and radio hits.

I think the boy used yelp to find something in the area that would be a good place to eat and to chat without having to fight over the typical bar/club noise. 

We were one of two tables for the night. We sat in the back corner and were attended to right away. I think we spent something like 6 hours there having dinner, drinks and good conversation. It is definitely a good place to just hang out. 

The server was very nice and attentive. Not sure if it was because (after a little while) we were the only table in the place or if she would always be that attentive. Something about her personality leads me to believe it was not because there was only one table - but, that's just my general feeling. 

We had 2 full meals and a number of drinks (at least 6, we bought our own first round and then a round for our friends and us, can't remember if there was more on our tab) and we spent somewhere in the area of $60-$65 (pre-tip). I was actually somewhat surprized the bill was not more.

This place is really clean.  I mean super clean.  I mean I couldn't stop looking at how clean the carpet was.  And my friend even commented on the carpet too when she saw me looking at it.  Its really that clean.

The surprising part is that there is no divider between the bar and dining area and you don't smell smoke at all unless someone is actively smoking at that moment.  The downside is the fact that there is no divider - and I reeked by the time I got home.  

This is a Minnesota Vikings bar for anyone who cares about that.

The waitress couldn't have been nicer and took really good care of us.  The food was good too.  We just had sandwiches but both meals were good.  The waitress also gave us a discount thingy to return at a later date.

-Two Eggs any way w/ hash browns, toast add meat for extra $.
-Chicken Fried Steak
- Three Eggs with peppers, onion, potatoes, and cheese had the appearance of a skillet with no skillet.

I went for two eggs over, wheat, and bacon.  Hard to mess this dish up.  My food came out of the kitchen pretty fast since I was the only cover at the time, so that should be expected.  Nothing to fancy just a simple and quick meal.  If you check in on Yelp you get a $1 off food and drink.  Membership has it's PERKS!

I don't quite understand at all how this bar is MN themed. They have one posted that says something about Minneapolis and artwork from a MN artist but we would have had no idea who the artist was if the bartender didn't inform us.

The bartender also didn't know much about MN. He admitted this to us but it was a little disappointing. Obviously they can't have only people that are from
MN work here but it's just weird that they call it MN themed but don't care enough to teach their employees some things about the state so they can converse with the native Minnesotans. 

Their food wasn't very Minnesotan either. They had a French dip sandwich called Timberwolves French dip and a Twins Something Basic. So really they just named normal plates after our sports teams. How silly.

Also we had to sit at the bar to eat but they did give us a cool wood board that stuck onto the bar top to eat on. The bartender was nice and tried his best to talk to us about MN but I couldn't help but laugh because he didn't even know the name of the Mall of America and after telling us he was from Cali I would have been happier enjoying my food without the pointless convo.

There was also a loud woman shouting at the end of the bar, cursing, & screaming. She was a server there who had just gotten off work. One of the bartenders was also just getting off work and sat down right next to us to have drinks at the bar as well. It was just me and my boyfriend, an old man, and I'm pretty sure the rest of the people there were employees there getting off work and drinking... 

My boyfriend and I both ordered the mushroom and Swiss burger and the patty was soooo dry I had to dip my burger in A1 sauce and ketchup which I NEVER do. 

We won't be back. I'm still confused on how this is a MN themed bar. There is nothing MN about it at ALL.",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,0,0,1,eUfJ6o66yvFHFxoJJnOeXA

I wouldn't recommend the burgers because they tend to run dry.
But the Quesadilla is GREAT... and really big.  Easily can be shared by 2-3 people for an appetizer.  
The club sandwich is big with lots of turkey.
The taco salad is average .... but it's big and filling.

3026311,2010-10-03,2,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,"Let me start this review off by saying I was born and raised in MN.

The Blue Ox Tavern on Sahara is part of a 3 bar group in Vegas. I believe each is separately owned and operated. And while I have never been to the other 2 locations, if they're half as good as this place, they are worth checking out.

The place is nothing fancy, it's a local's bar/VP house. They have a small meeting room in the back that can be used for private parties or club meetings.

The decor is very understated, it has a older vibe with paneling and tons of wildlife and lake photos on the walls.

The Staff is always friendly, the owner will come around and personally thank you for coming in and see if there is anything they can do to make your visit better.

One thing that is a little different about the Ox is the customers. I'm not sure if you have ever heard of the saying ""Minnesota Nice"", but trust me they are. I have been to locals bars where all the customers are Slot Zombies and you can't get a word out of them. However, at the Ox, everyone is pretty approachable, and are always willing to talk about pretty much anything.

The Ox is a MN bar so the default ""home team"" is the vikings. Hell the bear head behind the bar is wearing a Helga hat complete with braids. Don't come in on a Sunday and expect to get another team on the TV's as far as they know in the ox, there is only one game on Sundays and it's the Vikings game.

They have some great game day specials that include Brats and Beer (does it get any better?). Most of the time they do special half time buffet during the Vikings Monday Night games. 

Their menu us full of Midwestern delights. You won't find Tofu or many vegetarian or vegan options on the menu, however you will find plenty of cow, chicken, and pig. Their Roast Beef is amazing, they have 3 sandwich options, and I strongly recommend the Timberwolves French Dip. I have yet to have anything on their menu that I wouldn't order again (and I've ate over 2/3rds of it!).

If you are a fan on MN sports, attentive staff, friendly patrons, cheap drinks, and some really good Midwestern Bar food, it's pretty hard to beat The Ox. 

I have said for a while now that if you were to remove the VP machines and put in a box of pull tabs you would have any bar back in MN. Anytime I am feeling homesick or want a good meal with some friendly people I set my autopilot to The Ox, and I'm never disappointed!",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,6,4,5,xEGOmUedVyW7pyYAp9YsHA

3113586,2012-06-30,0,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,"I give this place 5 stars, for ambience, decor, food, service, parking; you name it.

I had occasion to eat here for the first time on Friday, June 29, 2012 (5:13 PM), perfectly waited on by Melanie.

My center-cut NY Strip Sirloin steak was exquisitely prepared (""well done"") and literally SMOTHERED in so many sautéed mushrooms and grilled onions, that I could not see the steak beneath them!  Bravo, Carlos Flores!  It was juicy and easy to chew, as I expected.  The baked potato (only with butter) was also excellent, and NO ""crispy & crunchy"" skin (which I don't like to find).

The Chef's Salad was a complete meal in itself and again, excellently prepared, with HOMEMADE Ranch dressing.

The decor is pleasing to the eye (""intimate,"" I would say) and the only thing it would need to be ""elegant,"" would be linen tablecloths, which aren't necessary.

Unfortunately, the only ""negative"" thing anyone can truthfully say about this wonderful place, is NOT the ""fault"" of the owner.  But, due to the way the place is laid out, no one under 21 can be admitted/seated, unless they don't mind being seated in the separate dining area.  This is due ONLY to the configuration of the place and the laws of Clark County, NOT due to the owner.

Do stop in when you have the time (on the SW corner of West Sahara & Duneville).  To be more helpful, they're in the Burlington Coat Factory Plaza at Sahara & Jones, but on the extreme eastern side of that shopping center, as I described.

I can't say the same for anyone else working on this day.  About ten of us met for the football game on 1/21/18.  The place is generally not real busy, but they were for the game.  As a restaurant owner, it reminded me of a staff that was on the edge of a break down.  That happens when the manager hasn't done their job.  Well, it seemed everyone had a seat except for about 6 of us.  We were quick to get out of any servers way, but they insisted everywhere we turned, it didn't work.  We had purchased beers and then told, there wasn't any place to stand and watch the game.  The manager harassed us 3 times before I told him, I was calling the fire department because he was over capacity.  He finally went away and took out the garbage from the bar.

First I want to comment on the super friendly folks who work here - just the nice group of ladies you could ever hope to meet!  Made us feel super welcome from the moment we stepped inside. 

Now, onto the food. We started with a batch of the fried cheese curds, which were amazing. Lightly breaded melty cheese curds... just perfect. And the breading was just right - so often at other places you get breading that's too thick, but not here. These had just the right amount of light breading. The horseradish dipping sauce accompanying these tender bites of cheese goodness was amazing as well. 

For mains, my wife had the grilled onion and mushroom burger with fries and I had the Minnesota Golden Gopher roast beef sandwich with fries.  Both dishes were phenomenal.  My wife's burger was lean and perfectly prepared with lots of mushrooms and onion on it and laid atop a toasted bun. It was fantastic. The Golden Gopher had lots of thinly sliced roast beef on a toasted roll with oodles of melted cheese sauce. It was amazing. I love a good roast beef sandwich and this was one of the best I've ever had. Both of our orders of fries were piping hot with just the right amount of crispiness. Really great fries here. Pro tip: if you get the cheese curds and have some of the horseradish sauce left, save it for your fries. They go perfectly together. 

Service was fast, friendly and efficient and the decor of the place is really quite nice.  We just happened upon this place thanks to yelp (which rightly gives it a very high rating) while we were in the area. It was quite a find and we will definitely be back again soon.",76xS0Vin4uT25XKaxbsvmQ,5,1,5,MFMahaOAtjWkSXYEV6PYJg

I ordered their monster nachos, which was a mistake only in that the size of the order was HUGE.  I mean... given the name, you'd think I would have given it some consideration.  You have no idea how big this plate of nachos was.  Grown men would weep to see it.

Also, I've seen oxymorons present in food before, jumbo shrimp being the most obvious example, but their chips were, no joke, soft and crispy.  ""How can this be?"" you might ask.  ""I do not know,"" I would reply.  Actually, my reply would be more like ""ffnaauugghhfff,"" because my mouth would be full of those delicious chips.

My friend ordered the bleu cheese and chipotle burger, which he declared was also delicious and worthy of mention, but without tasting it, I'm afraid I can't offer my own opinion.  Nevertheless, by word of mouth, give it a try!

It also bears mentioning that our waitress was the only one on the floor, not only serving, but also bussing each table by herself.  She was not only very apologetic, but very attentive, which is always appreciated on a busy night!

Every other Blue Ox I've been to have the best chicken fingers I've ever had, except this one. I ordered chicken fingers with a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was inedible and the chicken fingers were warmed over pieces of...well.

They were akin to what you'd find in an elementary school lunch or prison. Despite being hungry I had one bite of slaw and one finger that needed to be doused in ranch and I couldn't stomach finishing the rest.

The server must've known that the food is terrible because he didn't even flinch when he took the full plate away from me.

It's unfortunate that they don't have the same quality as every other location.

It made me sad to think I had to share this burger with my hubby ...well he had to share with me. I ordered the Golden Gopher which was like a Philly Cheese Steak but with yellow cheese. It was a little too salty for me. We ended our delicious meal with Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Cake. I will definitely be back!,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,5,5xJNWeWBSvfB5mTHC_wuSQ

We are both Minnesotans who have just relocated to the area. We were excited to try this place out. A little homesick we were happy to see cheese curds and on the menu, but as for Minnesota fare, that was about it. We had the pork belly bites and the pretzel and the curds. We understand there is walleye on the menu at the other two locations. But there was no grainbelt on tap or bottled (may be difficult to source but we would love to see it), limited craft beer offerings, no jucy Lucy on the menu, we were a little disappointed in that. But we did enjoy our meal, it's excellent food, definitely a click or two up from standard pub grub.

My husband had a Caesar salad and I had the mushroom and onion burger. The burger was huge and a bit overcooked from my medium rare request. If you like onions, order this! They spare no expense in the toppings. The burger comes with chips, I was hoping for homemade, but it was one of those 25 cent bags that has maybe 8 chips inside...it wasn't a big deal because I was stuffed from the burger. If you want, you can upgrade to fries or coleslaw for a small charge. My husband's salad was average...there wasn't really enough chicken, but the dressing was good. Oh! He also ordered a side of chili and really liked that.. Because it was a late lunch, no cocktails this time around..water only. We never saw our waitress again after our order was taken. The bartender brought us our food, and another gal walking around tidying things brought us our bill. Low key, friendly people..

5498539,2010-05-03,6,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,"North Vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the strip and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places. So ending up near the airport down by Sahara on this week night in Veags was just another level of confussion. 

The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime can often slip by unrecognized.  The Blue Ox Tavern is no stranger to this sort of life style. Though I have to say that I was really surprised that upon coming here one night after an already long evening of drinking at a German beer house, we had to get buzzed into the place. 

Yes, that's right. Buzzed into a bar. And while the Blue Ox seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms with copious amounts of German schnitzel and alcohol, What with no hassles (besides the door), no talk, It was just a place to rest and regroup. I wasn't even hungry, which was sort of a shame because the happy hour/late bird menu really looked tasty. 

There's a rule in Vegas - Don't burn the locals. The main reason why you should follow it, is so that the same locals you didn't burn can take you to places like this. We were the only people in this bar on this weeknight. While I'm not sure if it was because of that, but the bartender would constantly come to the table and ask if we wanted another round. 

Yeah, there's nothing like sobering up with more alcohol. And while their selection wasn't that great, they at least had New Castle. A classic favorite of mine. 

Found out that this place is a gathering spot for Minnesotans in the weekly sacrament of watching their Vikings play. For a second there I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing that Las Vegas would have a lot of Minnesota transplants.

Oh well, I guess the only real draw back to this place is that at the late hours you have to get buzzed in. I mean, that alone makes you feel like you're in a scummy area. Over all, a good little tavern to get your drink on when you want to escape the strip and all its madness.",nj3syiLs3lABLtPVyL0ivA,7,4,4,TLmY4Jvn-Dt-IbpOxqgd8Q

5893979,2018-02-19,0,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,"Recently went here for my dad's birthday. They have just remodeled the interior and revamped their menu. That's my guess why some reviews say it's not very Minnisota-y.  We had a nice chat with the owner after dinner. Here's a very friendly and pleasant guy. He told us that the restaurant had just participated in a TV show that came in and really shook things up. 

I had the cob salad. It didn't knock my socks off. I LOVED their homemade ranch though. It Was Sooo Good! My boyfriend had ordered a garden salad an added chicken to it. I was jealously eyeing his tasty looking, freshly grilled chicken breast over my plain chicken cubes that came with the Cobb, but c'est la vie. My Dad's burger looked amazing. He enjoyed it, but didn't say much about it. That's pretty normal for him. My mom's ribs were good. A little too much sauce for me. Service was friendly, but slow and my mom's ribs came out a few minutes later than the rest of our food. 

We had fun after dinner playing on their FREE retro pinball machine housed in their new game room (what used to be the banquet room)! This room also had a pool table, shooting arcade game, and darts. Seems like fun. I'm looking forward to it the next time.",LF8irDgdWsNuxvLFh8cmzw,1,1,4,NjA3P-S1kU1zSnJmaDel5Q
5918767,2014-02-05,2,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,"It has been over three years since I last dropped in to Blue Ox Tavern.  And up until just a few seconds ago, I was still completely uninformed about the significance of ""Blue Ox"", except it has some connection to Minnesota.  So if you are curious about the name, here is a brief Cliff Notes notation about this trivia:

Blue Ox is actually named Babe, and is Paul Bunyan's animal companion.

Blue Ox was also a professional roller hockey team based in Minneapolis, MN, that used to played in the Roller Hockey International League.

But if you are expecting the interior of the tavern/sports bar to be all blue, you will be disappointed.  Hues of light pink is what you will most likely be covered with regardless of where you decided to park your hiney for the duration of your visit. But don't worry, your eyes are very good at filter that out, but it could get problematic when you try to take pictures of your food, menu or other picture worthy subject matters.  

Anyway, I was here recently to catch the slightly more than half of the most boring Super Bowl event in recent memory. The place was fairly busy, but there were still a few tables and booth that were unoccupied when I walked in.  The average age of the patron was easily over 35 (and I am lowballing my guestimate), so if you are looking for young wild and crazy sports bar scene, this is probably not your best bet.  Best surprise of the afternoon was the complimentary half time buffet that was sponsored by a local law firm (the hot links and other sausages and sides were a definite hit).

Their regular menu is your typical, non-gourmet bar food.  You have your appetizers (mostly fried items and nachos), salads, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items.  I had a bowl of soup (changes daily), and one of their burgers on both visits.  Food is decent and portion is relatively large (but nothing to rave about in our local weekly magazines), and most items are under $10.  

Service is decent. The waitresses checks up on you regularly, so your refills or next order of beer is practically effortless.  If you stop in to this sports bar when there are no games on, you could save $1 with your Yelp Check-in off.

Overall, I like this vintage sports bar that has persevered through the years with the occasional event promotions to draw in regulars and snag a few newbies.  Good experience if you are looking for something different from your regular routine.

5970824,2018-02-04,0,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,This used to be a place i would meet friends and eat Walleye and appreciate the Minnesota-like atmosphere. It has been transformed into a very sterile feeling fast food diner. No reference to the Minnesota history or anything that was there before. The extreme slap in the face was the waitress saying to be satisfied with something else on the menu as the Walleye has been removed. I found the new menu to be over priced and the choices are like any other fast food casino. $14 for a sandwich in a just-average cafe seems to be a little spendy too. It used to be my favorite place in town. Now i will not bother to go there anymore.,Z2bGfr9-H4HJRNeD_tUO-A,2,0,1,IjHiNLZCqD-uqdzotR-rRg
5979856,2012-06-20,0,5PP6BwtNYlPARHApB9lzcQ,"It was really hot, I was tired, I was in a part of town I wasn't very familiar with, and I really, really, wanted a good, big, all around typical American burger. Looking around at the places nearby I just wasn't sure if I could find anything tasty in this area at all.
However, Yelp led me here, and with the strangely high reviews I decided to just go for it and I was very pleasantly surprised.
It was a big burger, it was good with lots of toppings, I can't really say much. A burger is a burger and it was standard and good! It wasn't a little greasy guilty pleasure like that of In-n-Out or I Love Burger. And it wasn't a flavor-adventure like one would find at Bachi Burger. It was just a standard, big, filling burger, and it was actually good.
Also, the service is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed! Like I said, I was tired, hot and hungry, and in a foreign part of town, and I was thoroughly comforted and rejuvenated by this experience. And even though this happened maybe over a month or two ago, lately I find myself thinking about it and even craving another burger from Blue Ox.

For me, this place was a surprisingly cool haven in the middle of a hot and exhausting day. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did. Hope to see them again soon, yum!",-Cm0UFJ2ks2_XgvVtTqMVA,1,0,5,UOPkUwcTjAENp07Jr6S7VA
