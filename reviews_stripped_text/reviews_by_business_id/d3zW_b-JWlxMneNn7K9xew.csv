Having eaten pizza from the time I was a kid back east, good pizza, then suffering once in a while from that cardboard crap from the major take out joints which advertise on TV, I was pleasantly surprised and then thrilled with our experience here. The store is located in a neat strip mall on Fort Apache near Russell Road. The inside was spotless and it was clear that someone takes a great deal of pride in the appearance. Our server came promptly, answered questions, and took our order. She brought some rolls and marinara sauce as we waited, which was great. Our pizza arrived and it not only looked great but tasted great as well, hot and delicious. We took two slices home and even after resting for a day, the taste and texture of the crust and toppings was superb. We opted for the New York Combo and it's one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten and we will certainly return. Thanks very much for proving that a traditional pizza restaurant can still exist and more than successfully compete with the best.",dPFPFLsC4SoT6poNIU0USQ,0,0,5,X_XU0msTiq-IE3IfyVT8DA

REALLY like we want garlic bread that everyone has touched. When the food comes out, i ordered chicken parm, what a joke it was a bunch of old spaghetti with a piece of chicken on top it looked so bad that i did not even eat it. Although my husband's pizza was good . While we were eating they started cleaning the floors around us putting chairs up on table's while we were eating,  right next to us .The sever never checked on us gave us our check while we were still eating , we asked if we could have coffee and dersert she had attuide was SO RUDE!! So I called and talked to the owner the next day and told her what had happened and she was so nice and gave us credit and wanted us to come back so we did , should have never went back food was good the service was good Sterling was our server. With that said, it was my step daughters birthday and we had told him ,  wanted him to bring a cake with a candle which he never did .Had to ask in front of her for a dessert brought but  NO CANDLE charge us for the dersert which that's fine but no candle and did not ofter coffee , think he forgot took so long went and found him and said can we have check we were going to the movies .

It took forever for someone to answer the phone, and when they did, I was placed on hold 3-4 times and waited nearly 5 minutes for someone to take what I considered a simple order, a large cheese pizza. The girl told me it would be 45 min to 1 hr. Over an hour had gone by and our pizza still had not been delivered, so I called to see what was going on. Initially they couldn't even figure out what my order was because hey didn't take my name when I initially placed the order. I again was placed on hold at least 3 times and a guy finally told me it would be there soon. After complaining that it had been well over an hour, I expected at least an apology and maybe a discount in a future order...something. But was left even more disappointed. He pizza was finally delivered at 5:45, it took an hour and a half to get 1 pizza. To top it all off, the pizza taste was mediocre.

I spoke to a female manager and she, at first, said she would deliver the item missing and fix my order and provide 20% of for next delivery. I was ok with this. About 10 minutes later the manager calls back and says that they have never in their history of business existence have they had an online error. I told the Manager that I paid a hefty amount for my food and just wanted it to be fixed. She said it was my error and they have never made an online mistake.

I ordered a large pepperoni, garden salad and a side of garlic cheese bread. The delivery man was super nice and polite. The pizza was good, piping hot and the perfect amount of toppings. The cheese was stringy and melty which I love. The crust was the perfect combination of chewy with just enough crispness so that it was not doughy. The garden salad was super fresh and delicious. The veggies were crunchy and tasted like the had just been picked. The only downfall was that they forgot the salad dressing ;( Luckily, I was able to find some at home. The garlic cheese bread was kind of bland, I didn't taste any garlic at all so I don't think we will be ordering that again.

We got a chopped antipasta salad & the New Yorker combo pizza. The pizza was pretty dang good. 
The salad however was disappointing. Especially when it costs $10.75! It was like they took two bags of different salads threw in some meat & chopped up bell peppers & dressing. If you want a good antipasta salad go to Grimaldi's in Summerline....their salad is WAY better. 
For the pizza (we got a large, salad & 2 drinks it was $40.12). I was surprised it was $5.00 for just two damn diet cokes!

I ask to see the owner who I know is in the building( our kids played baseball together) and was told that she doesn't care and that she does not have it time to come over and speak with us because she is off.

I went to the Streets of New York website to check out the menu and saw that they have Happy Hour, clicked on the link for the Happy Hour Menu. The website states, ""Enjoy food and drink specials from 2:30 pm to 6 pm, Monday through Friday at all Streets of New York locations!"" Cool!!! I had even preselected my order in my mind.

I arrived at the restaurant around 3:40 pm on Friday. I walked in and the waitress was on the phone and saw the sign to seat yourself. After awhile the waitress greets me and I ask about the Happy Hour menu (there are no signs mentioning a happy hour anywhere). She said, ""There is no Happy Hour on Friday."" Since, this was my first time here and thought to myself maybe I misread the website. I was still able to order from the lunch specials (10:30 am to 4:00 pm). Ordered the 6 wings and a slice, soda, and a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake.

I loved the wings! They were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the right amount of sauce, and great buffalo flavor. I liked the crust of the pizza but it didn't seem like there was any sauce and it tasted dry. The pumpkin cheesecake was dreamy! It was light, creamy and the pumpkin flavor was subtle.

I will be back for more wings and cheesecake for sure! I would also like to try more items during Happy Hour, apparently not on a Friday though. Like previous reviewers the wait staff seemed to be going through the motions and not especially welcoming.

This is what I experienced my first time at Streets of New York; a scintillating meal, a very tall glass of beer, and a price range that begged me to come back for more. 

The pizza is thin, crispy, and that perfect amount of salt to let you know they're not slacking on the pepperoni. The wings were boneless and while the sauce wasn't as hot as I would like it was tasty---this is a place where I'd ask for sauce on the side instead of tossed, the sauce man is a bit too generous. 

While I was initially disappointed that their happy hour beer was only Bud Light--even though the menu says domestic, insinuating that you have options---their large size is gargantuan and they have sam Adams so things worked out. 

I'm someone who doesn't get caught up on service unless the restaurant is built around such things, but the waitresses seemed a tad apathetic. I never felt ignored seeing as I was the only person dining at the time, but the place held all the enthusiasm of a nursing home on xanax day.

We went back the other night, mainly again because it was close and we had a coupon for two for one. Even with a coupon I don't think I would go back. I had baked ziti. It was rather bland and there wasn't anything special about it, not bad, but not good either. I switched with my dining partner who had the eggplant rollitini, this was horrible, the underlying bed of spaghetti was fine. It tasted like the make their own sauce, but the eggplant was mushy and again bland. Definitely not recently cooked, more like microwaved, and possibly bought from Sysco instead of being made in house. It was a $2.50 or so up charge for a dinner salad and bread sticks. The bread was hard and cold. The dinner salads were okay. One biggie though - no fresh brewed iced tea. Service started out slow but once the waitress came over everything was fast. I was teetering before a one star, as I said I will never go back there, but gave them a two as the sauce on the spaghetti was decent and the service was good when we finally got service. If there were halfsies in yelp I would probably do one and a half.

800510,2011-05-13,0,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"I love this little pizza place and I've never had a bad meal.  I usually get take-out and the pizza is at my place usually within 30-40 minutes even though they say 45.  

I'm very, very picky about tomato sauce and marinara sauce in that I don't like them at most pizza places (especially the marinara).  But here, however, the tomato sauce is excellent.  The crust isn't doughy and the cheese and toppings taste fresh.  I've had their caesar salad, also, and have never been disappointed.  I usually order the formaggio pizza, and it's my absolute favorite.  It's not on the menu anymore, but they will still make it.  

I know people like to compare pizzas (to New York ones, for instance), but really people should judge the pizza on its own merit, regardless of the name of the place.  I don't know whether this pizza is like a NY pizza or not...some say it isn't, and it's always New Yorkers who complain about out-of-state pizza (sorry New Yorkers, it's true!)    

I don't understand some of these reviews.  When I've gone in to pick up a pizza, have one delivered, or dined in, the staff has been nothing but friendly and I've had nothing but good service.  I took a friend from out of town there and she loved it, too.

You don't ever see me giving 5 stars. If I have to deduct a star, it would only be because it is over 25 miles from my cave.
I've seen the other reviews, and I do concur with a few of the statements:
Yes, the pizza doesn't remind me of any pie back east, especially New York. But I tell you this: They should call it the Streets of Phoenix. Being the official pizza of the Phoenix Suns, it only makes sense. It's the best pizza on the west coast, especially better than that California Kitchen place.
Some people don't like the service, some do. At this point of the game, this is the most consistent. Of course, I could be distracted by the important games, but that's just another service they offer me and i DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK. 
I come to eat, hang out, and watch sports, and no one has ever bothered me and there wasn't an occasion where I had to depart from my R/R status.
Where does the 5 stars come in? I'm getting to it.
After work, I come for a light meal. Turkey has always been my favorite sandwich. Even though they have my favorite turkey sandwich, I, now, can't make up my mind about the chicken pesto sandwich or their tuna. They are that good.
The wedding soup and the tortilla are necessities with my sammies, unless I am in a mood for a salad. In that case, I encounter another fork in the road between the pear-gorgonzola, chicken caesar or  antipasto. 
The chicken wings they serve, is their own. I don't know what they do to them but it's close to genius in my books. I can replicate anything at Metro. But this place has the goods, they put love back in the kitchen.
So, easy 4 stars right there. The fifth star is for getting me to eat soup or salad, and liking it. For me, losing 30+ lbs after eating their 3 nights a week is the money maker.It has never been so easy and I didn't even have to try. With their menu, I could rule this planet.

Total $46.00 - ""excuse me?"" I said.  *that was WITH a $5 off coupon. LOL  He explained that it was for 18 inch pizzas and asked if I wanted to do the 16 inch ones.  So yes 16 inches sounded much better where the total was $40.  Still a bit pricey for pizza I think but hey it fed 5 people so I guess you can't argue if you look at it that way.  They tacked on a hefty $3.00 delivery charge to that price by the way.  Pizza took a little over an hour to be delivered.  I guess there were a lot of Mothers not cooking on Mother's Day. hehe

The pizza was good... a little on the greasy side.  The crust was fresh and the toppings were good.  We ordered pepperoni with ricotta extra sauce and it was great.  I'm not a real fan of the taste of their ricotta-I have had better.  Their ricotta doesn't really melt so it seems a little dry. The other pizza was Hawaiian.  Nothing to complain about. My BF and I both agreed that their pizza has been better...not sure what it was.  Maybe we just weren't in the mood.

We have visited this place on several occasions.  The service is top notch.  They are on top of it and very organized.  The restaurant is located in this amazing little San Francisco style plaza.  The plaza itself is worth the visit.  We have also been to catered parties here with salad, pasta and pizza buffet style.  Great place to do a little get-together - say for 10 to 15 people.  The place isn't that big.  BTW the place is always packed on the weekends.  I believe they have outdoor seating but I have never seen anyone using it.  Probably because of the weather.

The thing is I always order spaghetti and the other stuff. And they're just as good as the first time I sat down here in 2012. 
The spaghetti inside a calzone- holy edible clam shells, batman! The only thing wrong with this is now I can't make up my mind between this and their bolognese.
The pear salad always fresh, but they must've forgotten I don't care for the blue cheese crumbles. But now I do. They say your taste buds mutate every 7 years and it must be that time, because I love it.

Seat yourself on a busy early night on a Saturday.  Possibly formidable but not a problem on this particular evening.  Some crumbs on the table selected but easily whipped away, we sat.

Our server was happy. happy, joy, joy despite (appearing) being up to her ears in customers.  She was all smiles and so was the other younger dudes who came in to assist.

My Coke was never empty and neither was the GF's Iced Tea.  We started with carbs..Passion Bread.  Bits of dough slavered with buttery garlic and parmesan.  Carbolishes!

The GF ordered up the ""make you own pasta.""  The sauce was tasty and she added pepperoni to the mix.  I believe the call it ""Angles with dirty faces.""  There were no issues with her requests.

I settled on Ultimate New York Cheese Steak. The roast bead was thin and awesome.  The onions and mushroom made it pop!  The Alfredo/Provolone sauce was awesome.

1679937,2013-03-24,2,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"I am always befuddled and perplexed when my review of a certain establishment is so much better or so much worse than the other reviews that my fellow Yelpers have posted, but in regards to Streets of New York I am compelled to tell all of my fellow Yelpers who posted reviews with anything less than four or five stars that with all due respect, you need to lay off of whatever type of intoxicant you are drinking and / or smoking because your judgement has been seriously impaired!!!!! 

Now having said that, I will say that there have been times during one of my many visits when the service has been, how shall I say it, less than stellar. No worries, anybody who has read one of my reviews before knows that I could care less about the service at a food establishment if the food is good, and at the Streets of New York, the food is EXQUISITE!!!

Streets of New York is the real deal, everything is fresh with such a unique taste. 

This is not one of those, ""insert generic pizza / pasta place name here"" type of places, no this is the real deal, if you are looking for a pizza place where everybody will be really, really nice to you, and fill your drink thirty six times, and draw a smiley face on your check go to pizza hut, if you want damn good food this is the place for you.

When you arrive you will notice the line, I guess that everybody who goes out to eat does not post reviews on Yelp, who knew, or should I say, how weird!?!?!? Some people, and based on the line or wait time at Streets of New York, I would have to say many people, just vote with their wallets.

When you get seated greet your server, I have always found not being a jerk helps improve the service, than order either the Baked Chicken Wings or the Chopped Antipasto Salad, NO WAIT, order both, you will regret it later if you don't.

I love chicken wings and these are great chicken wings, they will dress them in a sauce if you so request but in my ever so humble opinion the sauce just takes away from the taste of what may be one of the top ten best chicken wings in the United States.

Now the antipasto salad, I am a meat guy, I am all about the meat, so when I fell head over heals in love with this salad I thought we would have to rush my wife and best friend of twenty seven years to the hospital, thank God, false alarm. I do not have an adequate vocabulary to properly describe this salad so let me just say that it may be one of the tastiest, most mouth watering things I have ever ordered at a restaurant ............................. the antipasto salad is to die for!!!!!

So after you have completed savoring the delectable wings and the tantalizing antipasto salad as your appetizers, what can I say, I am a big eater, time to move on to the main course.

My wife is a fan of the Old World Meatball sub on the wheat bread, just a warning, this is a popular item and they often run out of the wheat bread.

Me, I am all about the pizza and the pizza here is very good, it is not my favorite pizza in the world, but as pizza goes, it is pretty damn good.

I could go on and on as I really enjoy this place if you have not already picked up on that but I have typed all that I care to type and it is time to close.

Go to Streets of New York and enjoy the food, if the service is less than awesome, shake it off like a big boy (or big girl) and remind yourself that you came for the food, not for counseling!!!!!!

Tonight's experience can be summed up as lousy and horrible value for the money. The 14 inch pizza we had was a disgrace.
There was BARELY any cheese on it and the sauce and crust were generic quality. I've had many better frozen pizzas out of a box. The cost was ridiculous for the quality of the product . A 14 inch pizza original with cheese only is 15 dollars. Literally, a rip off given the three thimble fulls of cheese on it.That pizza in no way resembled the pizza you see on their website laden with cheese and appealing. 
The dinner salad wasn't bad except had to pick out large pieces of lettuce core out of it which should've gone into the garbage can. 
A friend had the gluten free pizza and it too was meh at best in terms of flavor. Add
Two sodas. Bill 49 dollars. What a rip for that quality, or lack of quality which is more appropriate.
Disappointing. This place has really gone down. Take the time to drive to Grimaldi's instead or Giordanos. Much better quality at both places for the money you spend.

The wings were passable, although I'm not going to be overly critical as it's a pizza place and I try not to use non-Italian American food to review a place like this. The pizza was fresh and they obviously good quality ingredients but the taste was not in the style of an authentic Pizzeria. The dough just wasn't right for an advertised authentic NY style, (or Neopolitan), pizza.    I was born in Queens and lived on Long Island for 32 years so I think I'm qualified to know what New York style pizza is at this point, and this place is not the real deal. The pizza was okay, but I wasn't bowled over either.  
I will say the service was excellent for a busy Friday night and everyone employee I saw there was in good spirits.  The food came out in a timely fashion as well.

It was busy, and I get that, but they didn't seem to have a good system in place to begin with - there seemed to be 1 waitress for the whole place and a guy who would just refill drinks. The servers were nice despite the stress, but it just didn't seem to be working out well. When you're hosting an event, put more servers on the schedule! 

The menu is pretty big and my whole group had a tough time deciding what to get. As I have Celiac's, I was excited to see that you could make your own gluten free pizza. I ordered one. I was a little hesitant - I figured that in the rush, more mistakes would get made and the risk for cross contamination would be higher - but I was craving pizza and got it against my better judgment. I should have avoided this place altogether. I had a horrible reaction before we even left the restaurant. 

That being said, my friends really enjoyed their meals. If you have a food allergy, I would steer clear of this place, but otherwise, it seems like an alright place to grab a bite (though I might avoid trivia night until the crowds die down).",pcv-MEpcI6t4_ytr49LFpw,2,0,2,fKFQ30jslUr3j9EjqRl61Q
2004893,2013-07-07,0,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"I had recalled this place during my brief time in Scottsdale and was excited to see there were locations here in town.  

Location:  This spot is located in the far Northwest in an area that has continued to grow over the past few years.  It is situated in a cute little mall similar to the district in Henderson, but considerably smaller.   I get the sense the mall was to be larger but construction stopped midway.  Still it is a very cute area.

Ambiance:  The inside is nice  It is a bit small but had a nice little bar and plenty of tables with MLB and ESPN on the tvs.  I also noticed a patio for when it isnnt in the 100s lol.  I think it would be a cool place to stop at on the way home to catch a game.  I have read they have happy hour specials, but not positive about that or what they might be.

Food:  We order just a couple slices of pepperoni.  As we waited we were served complimentary Passion bread.  The bread was pretty good.  I definitely would want to have it again.  The pizza overall was solid.  The crust was quite soft when bitten into.  I could not recall if this was what I had, had experienced previously, but I might ask for it to be cooked a bit longer next time.  It was still quite tasty.  The cheese and pepperoni both tasted great.

Service: We were the only folks in the place.  I imagine the extreme heat and time of day contributed to that.  The waitress was attentive and we had no complaints.

Price:  We went during their lunch time (10:30-4pm) and slices, beverages. and bread all came in at about $15.  Definitely a great price.

All in all had a great experience and look forward to hitting up this area again.  I was shocked to hear they had been in business for over five years in that location.  I hope for the area to continue to build to further the foot traffic.",jSD05fFrAFa5gX3ZQae1tw,0,0,4,AWg41cmiashE23oHFmHnMw

We ordered an antipasto salad which did not have enough dressing. The portion was small. Four of us maybe got 1/2 cup each of salad. For $12 you would expect to get a larger portion. The sausage and peppa pizza sounded good. Sausage, green peppers, ricotta, onion and garlic. Honestly it was probably the worst pizza I've ever had. Ranch is from a bottle - yuck. I was beginning to regret having chose this place for dinner. 

But my friends there is a saving grace, and it's name is broasted chicken. Broasted is broiled and roasted. It's crunchy like fried chicken but not greasy. It's seriously sooo good. The 8 piece meal is $20 and it comes with two sides and some potato wedges. We got the coleslaw which was really good, and fries which were just whatever.

I walked in and there were only 5 or 6 tables occupied and it was open seating.  There appeared to be 3 servers.  Two of them looked at me when I walked in but never greeted me.  I sat down towards the Northern wall.  The servers walked by me several time as I waited to be helped for about 15 minutes and still never offered a greeting.

Finally I approached one of the servers that was clearing a booth and asked for a menu and took the empty booth.

I proceeded to order their cheesy bread which was to be brought out first.  It was but only by about 3 minutes.  It was supposed to come with marinara, it did, but I had to ask for it.  It was such a tiny little cup I also asked for another and some napkins as well since no one brought those.

He returned with my pizza, the extra marinara, and napkins.  As he took the napkins off the plate you could see big as day that it was filthy with a big ole dried tomato smack dab in the center.  I will try to upload a picture.

I went to take a bite of the sorry excuse of the cheesy bread that the brought out.  Nothing like the ones I received 2 weekends ago and countless times before and they were still frozen in the middle.

At this point I asked for a to go box for my untouched pizza and my check.

Very, very disappointing to drive across town to receive this kinda of service!

The canoli was not good either. It was just covered in nasty hershey syrup. My 8 year old who eats anything wold not eat more than a bite. I would NOT recommend ordering from this place.

One thing that was NOT amazing...that would be our waiter. I believe his name was Stirling.

 Everything started off okay as he took our order.... but apparently right after that his parents came in to dine as well.(as we heard him mention it to someone). That being said, he spent most of the time sitting in the booth with them. Our appetizer came out and we watched it sit on the counter as I could see his leg and shoe from around the corner at the booth with his mom and dad. 15 mins later, another employee checked the food and the ticket and graciously brought us out our food. Not once did he come over and check on us, although i would have loved some ranch and also a glass of wine. The same other employee came back and retrieved our empty appetizer plate....still no attention from our waiter. I saw him go over and speak to another table, which was conveniently in front of his parents booth, as he did so he had his phone out and was texting as his spoke to the table. (really?!) If he would have done that while speaking to our table I would have send something...but oh wait....he never really came back to our table AT ALL..There was another waitress walking by who graciously asked if we needed a refill of our drinks..since clearly we did and it wasn't going to get done by ''our'' waiter. Shortly after our food was brought out by yet another employee. Still.....not once did our ''waiter'' check in on us. Although he did make sure his parents were getting his full attention. And i get it, it's family and you want them to feel welcomed and enjoy the place you work at but not at the expense of your actual customers.  He did ask if my boyfriend needed to ''top off'' on his beverage, but that was also right before he brought us our check. We were there for over an hour and he only stopped by our table twice. 

I'm a Client Impact Manager for a 5 star company and I train customer service to my employees daily. I have never experienced such bad service from a waiter and I was appalled at the lack of engagement and attentiveness  he showed.

The pizza was cool enough that the cheese was almost solidified and I live a mile away.  The pepperoni they use is a really good brand.  The sauce was OK.  A little heavy on the spices and too acidic and the crust didn't even taste like it belonged with the pizza, it just didn't bring anything to the party.  We also got the artichoke dip which was spot on, served with tasty, toasted Italian bread. The dip was a creamy, cheesy sauce filled with artichoke that was firm and had a lot of flavor.   The only real problem I have with it was that the pizza was not cooked on a stone, it was cooked in a convection-conveyor oven.  I could tell because of not only the flavor, but when I flipped a piece over, I could see the screen imprinted on it.  If you're going to be as bold to have the words ""New York"" in the title of your brand, at least cook pizza in a stone oven to achieve that lovely dark brown char on the bottom that is a staple of New York pizza which not only makes for a better crust, but overall flavor.

With the amount of choice we have here in Las Vegas, I cannot stress enough that FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT waste your time at this place.  Like many others have said, they cannot get an order right (or a check, for that matter).  

We came here every Monday for 10 weeks to play trivia.  We returned each week because we wanted to play trivia, despite the fact that the service was atrocious (orders incorrect, forgotten beverages, cold food, charging regular price instead of happy hour prices, etc.).  

This has all come to an end because of the final experience we had last night.  We came to play Vegas Pub Quiz Trivia in a group of ten.  We all ordered dinner and alcohol, purposely spending a little extra to give business to the establishment hosting trivia.  The house music was playing.  As you can imagine, it is next to impossible to concentrate on a DJ-led trivia game with extraneous background noise.  When we asked to have the music turned down (not off) the owner not only didn't make an effort to placate the ten tables of trivia players, but she deliberately turned the music louder. Then she approached the Trivia DJ and let him now that she didn't care what the people wanted. 

I will never subject myself, my family, or my friends (and I wouldn't subject my enemies either) to this blatant disregard for customers.  If she is willing to treat loyal customers this way, I shudder to think about how she would treat you.  

This would be a great location for a good family-friendly Italian restaurant.  I'm anxiously awaiting a change of ownership!",bIoV70lqi0YV1p8m7cWUpg,1,0,1,ZQo17lppg3qJ59wCtttmlg

The chicken wings are phenomenal while the pizza is actually better at Hungry Howie's. The service for the most part has been quite good except for my encounter on Friday.  We decided to do a take-out order.  When we arrived, there was a guy at the register who was nice and friendly. However, he was chewing gum like there will be no tomorrow.

At this point, the manager was at the front counter and I asked her if she can take a look at the my order so I can possibly get the discount.  The manager swiftly asked if I had already paid for the order which I said that I did. She said, ""well there is nothing I can do because you already paid for the order!""  What do you mean there is nothing you can do?! Cancel the order, refund my money, and place a new order. Just tell the cook in the back not to make the duplicate.  The manager should have expressed more empathy and said, ""Oh I'm sorry about that, let me see what I can do. What pizza did you order? Oh, I am sorry but you ordered the 16"" pizza but the coupon is good for the 14"".

Locations around the Phoenix area are in abundance, but we have a couple locations here in Vegas so I decided to finally give them a try. I stopped in to grab some lunch to-go. I noticed the sign saying ""wait to be seated"" so I stood there and waited, looking around for an employee and didn't see one. I noticed only 1 table with customers inside, so they weren't busy and it was odd that no employees were visibly present at first. After about 5 minutes a girl came out from the back and asked if I was picking up or ordering. I asked if they had any lunch specials or a menu to look at and she gave me a menu and said she'd be back in a few to take my order. After I placed my order it took 25 minutes for the food to finally be ready. It was just 2 cheese slices and that's it, so I can't figure out why it took so long and it would have been nice if the girl who took my order could have communicated with me by letting me know that it was coming out soon, later, something! I felt like she forgot I was there honestly. I must say that when she did take my order and bring it to me she was nice, but there just could have been better acknowledgment so I knew I wasn't forgotten and wondering what was going on. 

Lunch specials are daily from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm. 

Drinks didn't come with any of the lunch specials and cost $2.90 each.

2 slices with one topping ($6.50) - I didn't want any toppings, just cheese and it still cost me the same price. Most places have a special for cheese slices with drink at a certain price and then they offer slices with one topping and a drink for just a little more. No price difference here they charged me the same regardless. If you want additional toppings it's $.60 each. No drinks come with any of the lunch specials which makes the $6.50 price tag a bit high for this area. It's not a combo or special if it doesn't come with a drink in my opinion and by the time the cost of a drink is tacked on, I might as well go down the street to Metro Pizza instead. The pizza was below average. It's absolutely beyond me why this place is called Streets of New York when the pizza is far from any traditional slice you will find in NY. The slices were not thin, but thick and they weren't shy with the cheese and it was tasty with the seasonings they added on top. The crust was a whole other story and it actually reminded me of frozen Freschetta pizza. I love a nice crispy crust however mine here was hard and dry. Not even the piled and delicious cheese on the top could save the rock hard crust. Maybe it was an off day, but I can't see hurrying back. 

Inside they have booths and tables. Aside from pizza they also have subs and pasta. If you are a fan of Broaster chicken they have that also and you can get just chicken, baskets or family meals.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,64,66,2,osmmhfUuqAFzULJXycs3qQ

Not to mention the bread itself was only edible in the middle (the dogs wouldn't even eat it).

I was so excited to try this pizza because I'd read good reviews, but the reviewers obviously never had good pizza before. For almost $30 for a medium sausage & pepperoni pizza and two slices of garlic bread, I could have had a better pizza from Dominos.

4655199,2015-06-29,7,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"The post-hike dinner has been a personal tradition. After my hiking trail adventure ends, my dining adventure begins. Today, after hiking up in the Sawmill trails of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I set out for the Streets of New York. It was a logical choice. I am a New York transplant that loves his pizza and subs. 

   It took work to find the Streets of New York on account of the fact that the streets of northwest Las Vegas are so confusing in the vicinity of the US 95 and the 215 exits. Streets of New York is located in a pedestrianised street that looks like Town Square. In similar style to Town Square, customers can park on the Main Street or in a parking lot at the back of the building. 

   Streets of New York is a casual sit down restaurant with extended booths and tables where televisions showing professional sports provide entertainment. When I walked into the restaurant, the host and waitress invited me to sit anywhere. I'd chose a long booth. After hiking, I appreciated the comfort of the plush booth. 

   Now for the menu. I was hoping that they offered my favorite sandwich, which is an eggplant parmesan on toasted bread that the pizzerias on my streets of New York offer without fail. But not these Streets of New York. The menu features New York pizza where their customers have a variety of choices and sizes in pies and slices, sandwiches including pastrami, and the meatball parmesan sub. What truly reached from the Streets of New York to the heart of my soul was their broaster chicken. This is where I was aware I was on the streets to a rewarding dining adventure. 

  It was only recently that Chilly Jilly'z at the other end of the continent Boulder City turned me into a fan of broaster chicken. When I set eyes on Streets of New Yorks special menu of broaster chicken, my mind was set on the two piece white meat broaster chicken meal. It included a chicken breast and wing, a 4 ounce side that I picked coleslaw and two potato wedges. It was also supposed to include bread that they never gave me. Oh well! The food was so filling and tasty that I had forgot all about the bread. The chicken breast was a large portion where the chicken wing was sufficient. The two potato wedges were large. Regardless that the potato wedges tasted fine they fell short of Chilly Jilly'z, that up to the time of this review is the best that I ever had. The cole slaw was a nice size portion and tasted average. All this food wasn't bad for $6.25 before tax. But, I have to have a fountain drink with my dinner. Especially a post-hike dinner. The Cokes, that didn't have a dint of flatness and that the waitress refilled in a timely manner brought the dinner up to nearly $10 before the tip. 

  After my leading dining adventure at Streets of New York, there is still more adventure that awaits. I truly want to try their New York pizza. Maybe this is first-rate New York pizza. My dilemma is that there are miles of streets of Las Vegas to reach Streets of New York. However, sometime in the future I am leaning toward a dining adventure in their Spring Valley location to explore their New York pizza.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,9,8,4,1qD7_Ssulzo-EE_gfgg5vA

Salad was also good and came with an orange bell pepper slice. Overall the food was great and for only $15 + tip thx to groupon. We WILL be back.,eL6JvK9q9LJD6ge_Q-yoYQ,1,0,5,Hqhmojf1SwyP-Pjsr2s3cw

There are TVs tuned into sports for watching the game. It is set in a cute but struggling shopping street made to look like a neighborhood.

The pizza is the some of the best I've had in vegas. The crust is just right. Not too thick and not too thin. The toppings are fresh and the cheese is flavorful. The only time I have had a complaint was when I ordered a piece of pizza by the slice. It was obviously a piece that had been sitting around and was reheated, not so good. SO I would not reccomend ordering pizza by the slice. 

The salads here are fantastic. I love the greek salad. Lots of fresh romaine with green, red and yellow peppers, cucumbers,tomatoes and kalamata olives with feta cheese with a tasty greek dressing.

The one drawback to this place is the service. The waitresses are not very friendly and the service is slow. Even with that drawback, this is still our go to place for good pizza.",90wlZyvIK48a-74fDThhMA,0,0,4,QSlUBNjrG0PjeRuWc3V9Mw

When ordering for delivery my normal is their bacon cheese burger and fries. I normally love it but as of late the burger is dry and over cooked. No seasoning seems to be used. The bun is better seems they are using a sturdier bun as it holds up to the condiments. They only put the condiments on one side. I personally like it on both buns as it keep the bun from feeling dry. The fries as well are not seasoned.

1: Artichoke Dip. (It's not perfect. There could be a few more crusty bread things to go with it, but I usually get delivery, and there are pretzel chips in my cupboard.)
2: Pizza. (Thin crust, pepperoni and other things, depending on mood.)
3: Passion Cookie. (They will bring the cookie hot, with a little tub of ice cream and toppings ice cold to your door. Because they are objectively wonderful people)

Eat until you begin to regret.

5026025,2014-10-19,0,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"I was really disappointed in my overall experience at this restaurant.  We got there around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was full but we managed to get a table.  Nice inside but very noisy.  There was no greeter and the sign said to seat yourself.  It took about 10 minutes before I finally flagged down our server to get our order put in.  She seemed entirely flustered and disorganized.  Another server had previously taken our drink order.  They advertise complimentary garlic knots.  I had to ask our server for these, and she said ""If they are made.""  This is after I saw two other tables get complimentary garlic knots ahead of us.  She never went back to the kitchen to check.  I watched her as we were seated near the kitchen area.  Finally I flagged down a different server and he brought us a small order.  They were good but the marinara dipping sauce they serve it with was cold.  My wife ordered pasta with bolognese sauce and mushrooms with a garden salad.  I order a sandwich and we split a pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  My wife's salad came out first.  Once again brought by another server, not our server.  Then they brought out the pizza.  It was cooked well but there was no sauce whatsoever and they put way to much roasted garlic on it.  It was overpowering to the point that all you tasted was garlic.  After I ate one piece my stomach was upset.  Then about 5-10 minutes after the pizza came, they  brought my wife's pasta.  She ordered it with no cheese, and of course there was cheese.  She sent it back.  They brought the same pasta dish out with the cheese scrapped off and a different type of sauce poured over the top then the bolognese.  The pasta sauce tasted watery like it came from a jar.  It really had no flavor and was unappealing to look at and it tasted even worse.  During this time my sandwich had not come.  I watched as my sandwich was put up in the window where the server's take the food from the kitchen.  It sat there for over 10 minutes as our server or any other server failed to bring it to our table.  it was moved several times around the window it was sitting on.  out of the heat lamp so it was getting cold.  At one point it was taken off the window and put on the server's table and then moved back up to the window Finally I had enough and I asked a different server to take the sandwich off my bill because it was sitting up there for over 10 minutes.  We just wanted to pay for the pizza and pasta and it get out of this restaurant.  Just as we did that our server showed up with the sandwich in hand saying that it just came up.  We informed her that it did not just come up and that it had been sitting there for over 10 minutes and that she had failed to bring it to our table.  I asked for the check and she brought it.  She asked if we wanted to go boxes and we turned her down because we said we were disappointed by the food and the service.  After she ran my card she said that we didn't have to pay if we didn't enjoy the food.  That was about all she did correct the entire evening.

It safe to say that I will never return to this restaurant.  I am not a difficult customer.  I rarely ever send food back to the kitchen, but this server and restaurant failed on so many accounts that I had no choice but to voice my opinion about how poor the food and service was.  I would highly recommend you try another pizzeria before going to this one.  Flat out disappointing in all categories.",6A7VpHmaUcUWOZLHz3Oipg,1,0,1,S58CtWVDh7pXn9z1HPPZwA

Meatball sandwich was delicious and came wit a choice of sides. I got the pasta salad and it was surprisingly good. Homemade and not heavily dressed. All pasta dishes were very good with the exception of the lasagna. I thought there was too much meat and not enough to ricotta but that's me. If you like meaty lasagna you'll probably love it. I need to mention their baked ziti (née penne). It was exceptional in that it included hunks of link sausage. Possibly the best takeout ziti al forno I've ever eaten outside of NJ.

We ended up on this side of town, and we were about to go for Mexican, when we ran into a yelper who convinced us this pizza was better than the burritos. We decided to give it a go. 

The restaurant is casual with plenty of tables. The menu has pizza, wings, sandwiches, salads and Italian offerings. There are two crust options, and we went with the thin and crispy. It was indeed very thin and very crispy. 

We asked the waitress if there was plenty of sauce, and she assured us, yes. Pizza came and it had exactly zero sauce. She admitted she didn't realize the pizza that we had ordered did not come with sauce. It wasn't a big deal, just a little disappointing. We ended up getting sauce on the side and spreading it on the top. The sauce was tasty, but we probably looked a little odd smearing sauce onto the top of our pizza.

The toppings were fresh. The flavor was good, and it wasn't the least bit greasy. However, I could have used a bit more gooey goodness from the cheese. It just seemed a little stale, not melty and delicious.

Our waitress was as useless as a fish out of water. She was an older gal with dark hair and a chip on her shoulder. We overheard a shorter waitress tell what I assumed was a ""regular"" customer that the area we had sat in was the ""shitty waitress section"". Go figure. We got our beverages quick enough but had a hell of a time trying to get our hands on the advertised complimentary garlic bread on the menu. After taking our food order, this so-called waitress sat next to a ""regular"" customer and chatted him up, then baby sat 2 kids at another table across the room. These kids definitely belonged to one of the restaurant employees. When she finally brought the garlic bread, it was basically the snickle-fritz (crappy leftovers). She said ""This is what's left"". How about you just wait until fresh new bread comes out the oven and then serve me the good stuff, woman??

There was a young man who worked as the busser there, and he was busting his ass. He was basically picking up the slack of our waitress. Since our waitress was MIA, my husband had to go up to the bar and order a beer himself. On top of that, the menu advertises $2 bud light drafts during NFL games. Welp, there was a game on. The shorter waitress and the busser had no idea what he was talking about. But whatever, they figured it out and my husband got his $2 beer after much confusion.    

I ordered the Special Ziti Pasta ($11.25) sans the sausage and my better half ordered a calzone with pepperoni, sausage, and onions. Calzones start at $10.25 and each topping, besides the cheese and stuff, is an additional $0.70. Ouch. I was ready to dig in, but oh look honey, there's no silverware. The busser brought us our silverware and the garlic bread that our waitress failed to deliver. The food was pretty good, but bad service always outweighs the food in my opinion. 

Our waitress swung by and we ordered dessert, the passion cookie ($5.75). After putting in the order, she unceremoniously placed the tab on the table without a word. The Passion cookie was amazing, way better than BJ's signature poozookie dessert. Too bad I'll never taste that dessert again since I'm never coming back. 

The check put an even bigger damper on our mood. The bill came to $37, which is way too expensive for this type of establishment. It's just a local laid back pizzeria, nothing special. Seriously, where do you get off charging $2.90 for fountain drinks? If you want overpriced food and shitty service, eat at Streets.

The street that they created gives somewhat of an outdoor bar hop vibe.. but its design is just a facade. This creates a less than friendly park experience as there is no real parking area unless you get lucky and get a curb spot. 
Now on to the actual restaurant. The overall interior design is fairly nice. Its clean and give off a upscale pizza vibe. The pizza on the other hand while being fair at best is priced way too high for the size and quality you are receiving. I tried the ""Pigged Out Pie"" which is basically a basic pizza with pork related toppings. Overall I would give it a 4/10.. it was good, but not worth the price. The pizza was 14.99 and that was only a 10 inch pie and was labeled as large, the traditional large at a good pizza place is 16'. We ordered the chicken fingers which were actually pretty good even though the chicken fingers were small.. the order was 8.95 and only came with chicken fingers.. No celery, carrots, blue cheese, ranch, fries, bread or anything else that would make the order a more complete package. The flavor of the fingers were good though. We also ordered the Beer Cheese Bread which is just bread knots and a bowl of beer cheese.. this was delicious and only costs 5.95. More surprising is the bread is all you can eat so for value and flavor, I see this as the only reason to come here and order something.

As time went on, the staff became more and more lax. Everytime I walk into this restaurant, it seems as though they don't want me there. The owner is always sitting around doing paperwork at one of the tables. She throws the menus on the table and says your waiter will be with you. Although the restaurant was completely empty tonight, we still had trouble getting refills on our drinks. At the end of the meal I got a whopping $60 bill. I feel slighted because I had poor service and mediocre food. The only reason I go to this restaurant every once in awhile is because Metro pizza is too full. I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody and hope they go out of business so we can get somebody else with better food and service in there.",alhJ0sQ8_pslnKlyMHyKFg,0,1,1,ss_ZGzgZ1HPPv_gLd3dDpA

The restaurant had a only a few tables so I'm not sure if take out orders were delaying them but she quickly brushed our table to the side. My family's pizza arrived just before I left, when we ask if it was the pepperoni pizza she looks at it and says"" i think so"" then quickly hurried away.

5517469,2016-10-16,3,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"I've been here a few times as the husband works in the vicinity. The first couple times I ordered to-go. The 3rd time a family member was in town with pizza on her mind for lunch...and since we were planning to meet the hubs for lunch might as well dine-in. The first couple times in, I stood there waiting to be helped as this one waitress at he time stood talking with a bunch of guys who were seated at a table. She almost looked dang near disturbed that I was standing there. Then I realized, you seat yourself. However, I'm not going to sit down and expect to be helped especially for a to-go order. What's bad...this literally happened both times. Her smiling face chatting up certainly didn't follow with her when she walked over to help me.

Choosing to dine-in was a little hard for me to do. Fam in town, pizza on zee mind, walking distance, lunch...okay let's go. Service was the SAME! I tried giving excuses the first couple times...but the very same lady (could be part owner idk) seemed like we were an inconvenience. She wasn't chipper nor welcoming, really. 

We have ordered wings, street fries, the new york combo pizza, a bruschetta, and the meatball sub...collectively. I thought the wings were pretty good, but everything else...pretty average. The food wasn't exciting, kind of like the service. Dining in there was 1 older gent, a family of 3, and us. Getting checked on, refills, was like a deep sigh and a mission. Why do we have to wave a flag to be seen? I honestly wanted to love this place, but for the value and the service...it isn't even worthed. It's hard to support a business that feels like they don't value each customer.

It's just disappointing businesses whether it'd be the owners or workers itself...fail to take the time in properly greeting and treating their customers to a certain level. I'm not talking about butt kissing or overly attentive...I'm just saying basic customer, GENUINE service. A lot of times the food could taste greater if the experience was great. Each time in...the place felt like a dead spirit. Something tells me if you are a regular you'll certainly have a bipolar experience and perspective.

3 times is enough even though I'm in the area often enough. Never again.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly. I'm not saying don't give it a try as my experience is mine...but hopefully you'll have a better one. 2 stars for having a lot of tables available and the food being ahhh-ite. I suppose that warrants 2 stars, aye.

5615036,2017-07-24,0,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"Who doesn't love pizza? Whether it's NY or Chicago Style, we as a whole, love it.

We have lived in Centennial Hills for 8 years and we have seen our fair share of pizza places come and go. Streets of NY has been there for a while and it was time we actually gotten a pie from them.

I called for a carry out order.
We always order a lot of food to get a gauge of how good it'll be.

We got a 16"" pizza, 12 piece boneless wings, a slice of chocolate cake, and their famous Broaster chicken. I used the yelp check in offer for a $5, 4 piece broaster meal which is normally $9. We were told it would take about 15-20 minutes for our order to be ready.

I got there about 15 minutes after I ordered and after I had paid was told they were out of chocolate cake. We opted for the cheesecake.

After about 10 more minutes of waiting I was finally on my way home.
 
The pizza we had ordered was a 16"" NY style pie. Ricotta cheese on the whole thing, half with pepperoni and jalapeños. The pizza came with ricotta, but the pepperoni and jalapeños were on the WHOLE pie. I called to let them know about the mistake and they offered to make a new one or give me a credit, I opted for the latter. 

The pizza looked good upon first look. We each grabbed a piece and started. Another issue. Mistakes get made, I understand, we probably eat hundreds of hairs or more in our food in our life, but I don't want to see them. A hair was found in the ricotta. The discovery made it hard to eat the rest of the pizza. 

Other than the mistakes on the pizza, overall the flavors were good. The crust was crispy and chewy, the way a pizza should be. The mozzarella was tasty and it wasn't a greasy pie. The ricotta was creamy and the pepperoni and jalapeños added a nice salt and spice. Overall 3.5/5

We had originally ordered the Honey Gold flavor, but were told they didn't have it. So we settled for the medium Buffalo sauce. The boneless wings were surprisingly well made. The medium Buffalo sauce had no trace of heat at all though, but the flavor was good. I assume if you want heat, order the Hot Buffalo.  Overall 3/5

The Broaster chicken looked dead on arrival. Probably one of the least appetizing, driest looking pieces of chicken I have ever seen. With that being said, upon tasting, it was better than it looked. Better than it looks doesn't mean it was good. The chicken wasn't dry, but it was bland. Very little, to no seasoning at all. Overall 2/5

The cheesecake was good, but it wasn't chocolate cake. It was a good old fashioned cheesecake. Creamy, tangy, sweet. Overall 3/5

Streets of NY is a decent pizza shop. The prices are a bit high, but it's a higher end chain. It's not anything I would go out of my way to get, but it wasn't too bad.",ISQTwI_ri5lKHQsArnUMXQ,2,0,3,OVJUjm6kxcoa13m1cvCgKg

I normally wouldn't care but he didn't even offer me a class of water while I was waiting. When I was leaving he even forgot to offer me any cheese or pepper to go with the pizza.

5775834,2016-11-04,0,d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew,"My wife and I first went here a few days ago, the service was great and the food was even better. Robin was our waitress and she couldn't have been better. While we were there she told us about their rewards program. We signed up and got a free drink. If I would have written my review then I would have given this place 5 stars!

Today, my wife and I returned and brought with us a couple friends. Our server was Carol, she was very sweet. We had gotten an offer, my wife, myself, and her friend. The offer was for two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5. On the deal it says that it is limited PER CUSTOMER. So we assumed that each of us could get it. When we went to order Carol said she only do the deal for one person at the table. We showed her that it said per customer. She then went to the back to speak to someone and came back saying that she was told no, but would do it for us this time. By the end of it all, we didn't get the deal on our check. It also took an hour from the time we sat down to get our food. It took another thirty minutes (not at all exaggerating) for us to pay. 

Another party sat next to us, and at one point were serving themselves because the food was not being delivered. It was not a good experience at all. 

I love the food, so I may give it another try, but they need to work with their staff more on serving their guest in a timely manner and also work on their rewards program and either honor what the coupon says, or change it.",tgdyKNboZeuZ1PnvamddUA,2,0,2,bo-Mkq3EqRlbLtvVg7utTw

We asked for more bread on four separate occasions before they finally remembered it, we had to remind them to bring drink refills and finally our pizza order was incorrect.

This is the only thing that happened fast during our visit.  The ONLY reason this is getting even one star is because a zero-star review isn't possible.

We ordered a large Mediterranean pizza and specifically ordered chicken on half of it because one of us is vegetarian and the other isn't.  We also ordered a basket of fries as an appetizer, which came out hot, their only redeeming quality.

The pizza took a VERY long time to arrive and when it did, it was wrong.  Not only was it missing an ingredient that was listed on the menu but it had chicken on the whole pizza. We brought it to the server's attention right away and she claimed to have not heard the request and continued to argue until I made it clear I couldn't eat the chicken on the pizza.  She told me she'd be bringing me a new small one with the correct toppings in a hurry.  This pizza took longer than the first one and when it came, it too was wrong.  When we brought this to her attention, she began to argue with us and even called over another server from the table she was waiting on to argue with us further.  By this point we didn't want anything further to do with the continued disappointments Streets of New York was providing.  They had a THIRD person bring a box over for the leftover incorrect pizza and told us that we weren't being charged for anything and could just leave.  

We did just that and WON'T be back. Steer clear of this establishment if you want quality food and good guest service!!",c5oYE9tK0Rb0lSUREw1lxQ,6,0,1,MG8d405X_BEbx6EUWsQY7w
