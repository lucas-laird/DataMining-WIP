French and had vegan options I was sold there. 
Never had French with vegan options.  
The place is really upscale looking and the waiter Alexander was great.  He explained all the options and made sure our glasses were not empty.  

We ordered beet salad and ratatouille for main course and tapioca pearls pudding for dessert.  
Beet salad was fresh and it had that crispy taste. 
Ratatouille was eggplants, capsicum, vegan cheese layered dish which was cooked to perfection 

The icing on the cake was the tapioca pearls pudding with some edible orchid petals. 

All the food was beautifully decorated and yet it was tasty!!!

Throughout our dinner experience, Jose and Nicolas are so friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and accommodating, along with their chefs' genuine creativity, detailed thoughtfulness in the dishes they made, our degree of liking for this place grew from 'mild (skeptical)' to 'intense (loving it!!!!!!)' by the end of the night. 

The presentation of every dish is exquisite, taste is light yet explosive in flavors.

I was sad to see it's gone but Eatt moved into the same strip mall so I thought I'd give it a try.  It's fabulous and the owners and staff are all very enthusiastic.  I've been twice by myself and then brought my husband, who loved it as well.  It's Euro portioning, which is just perfect for me since I can't shake that very unhealthy ""clean your plate"" mentality.  So if you're a big eater, like my husband, you might want to try a few things.  It's not expensive, so not a big deal that the portions aren't huge.

Then we all ordered the octopus, which came from Spain - very tender. It was the best octopus I had in several years; done properly with a mixture of vegetables that accompanied it exquisitely. Then of course, coffee and dessert. We ordered the chocolate cake and chestnut creme puff. It was heaven without it being overwhelmingly sweet. We were so happy with the food that we ordered sandwiches to go: the cured ham panini, a vegetable one and a tuna sandwich. The panini had a pesto sauce and mozzarella. Delicious! And the prices were very affordable for the quality of food. The chef even came out to check-in with everyone to see if the food was to their liking. Very professional, including the staff.

The restaurant is airy and refreshing in the warm months but often feels cold and lonely in the cooler months. We usually order the steak, salmon and duck. All excellent to keep us coming back. However, the last time we were there in July, the salmon and the duck were both changed and the new recipes left us very disappointed. The service is generally fine (could use a bit more relaxed warmth) but inconsistent sometimes, especially when you get 2-3 different people serving you throughout an evening, something will be missing. I understand it's a small staff. Sometimes it still feels like an experimental pop-up. This can be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for. I personally feels like since the set up is casual and healthy food, the atmosphere should be more lively. I kept wishing someday I will walk in there and it will be loud and fun.

""What about the dessert ?"" Amazing too but my favorite one is the Tapioca !

The dinner menu was crazy too, and I finally choosed the Gaspacho very fresh and sweet. And after the piece of Black Angus (and because I am a meat amator) there is no word to describe how tasty and perfect was the beef.  
The red wine selection is perfect too.

Don't be fooled: It looks vaguely like a juice bar/acai bowl-type place, but the refined flavors and presentation are on par with a very high-end restaurant. What a lovely surprise, then, to embark on a gustatory adventure when the setting (and prices) are so comfortably low-key. The food is not only good, it surprises and delights--the hallmark of an exceptional restaurant. Everything we tried was wonderful, from the classic ham & cheese baguette to an ambitious butternut squash soup that was topped with coffee foam, truffle oil, and sauteed mushrooms. Don't miss the superb tiramisu, enhanced from the standard offering by a crunchy chocolate topping. I think it's worth noting that our children, 9 and 11, had a wonderful time here and cleaned their plates.

Flavors were spot on - we tried the broccoli guacamole, salmon club sandwich, chicken entree, and the beet salad. Each dish was creative and delicious. A bit too many sprouts in the beet salad, but still very good. We were not impressed that some items came out on china and others in to go containers - this took away from the overall seated dining experience. To go containers should only be used to go. My husband's meal in to go containers came out so far in advance of my meal (on plates), that he was finished before my food even arrived. 

For desert, we tried the cheese cake and another desert (I'm not sure of the name) with coconut and a matcha biscuit on the bottom. So good! We loved the smaller bites - not really desert people, but these looked too good not to try and they did not disappoint. Delicious!! Can't say that word enough times!

I read a few reviews, grabbed my husband and we were off.  The food was awesome!  I had scallops and my husband had angus beef. The  scallops were served with a tender & flavorful ravioli and the the steak came with their signature ratatouille rolls. The presentation was colorful and interesting.

The amuse bouche was a lovely chilled Asparagus soup,  it had a parmesan chip and Asparagus spear as garnish,  just lovely. 

The main course  was slow cooked Chicken breast that was Oh so tender and juicy. The vegetarian main was Ratatouille, if your not familiar with this French dish it's all vegetarian, it's egg plant and zucchini, tomato, red bell pepper,  herb dish simply delicious. Many of our friend are vegetarian so this was a big hit.  

Other of the dishes where a broccomoly, with corn chips.  This was just delicious and a great appetizer.  It was a smooth guacamole inspired broccomoly, it was made with broccoli. Someone actually asked ""it's not guacamole?"" 

Then there was a reminder of a classic nicoise salad but with anchovies and surrounded by perfectly cut English Cucumber. The balance of savory and sweet was perfect. Quiet delicious. 

Another lovely salad was a heirloom tomato and Mozzarella platter.  Made to be feasted on.  I could of ran away with it and enjoyed all by my self.  Sharing is overrated.

The vegan chocolate dessert was also delicious.  I'm not a huge chocolate person and the melding of the chocolate with the mango/pineapple center and the crunchy base worked so well together.  My dad got the vegan burger and he loved it.  The only thing we questioned was the side of red cabbage.  I love cabbage and put it in everything. I even eat it plain raw sometimes.

What was unique about Eatts was that the food was delicious without relying on butter, oil, and salt. Very subtle spices and perfect marriages of ingredients. Wow!

Great taste and good for you. What a concept.

Once seated though my waiter gave me such attentive service that I no longer felt odd. And another single diner came in as I was paying my bill. Honestly, the service here is impeccable. Towards the end of my meal another waiter came by to clear my plate and ask if I wanted dessert. When my waiter reappeared a couple of minutes later, he apologized profusely for making me wait. 
I ordered the Impossible Burger which came upon recommendation from the waiter and was very yummy (although a bit too meat-like for this girl who really doesn't like red meat). The hashbrowns acting as buns was a nice to choice but made i the burger very hard to pick up. I ended up eating the entire meal with a fork and knife.

It was delicious, high quality food minimally processed, yet presented in a fashion reminiscent of a Michelin Star restaurant.   This is not surprising, considering the impressive background of the French chefs.  The cost of the meal was a third of what you'd pay for a similar experience in one of the gourmet rooms on the Strip, yet the food was just as good.   The concept of Eatt may be off-putting to some serious gourmands, as the ""healthy"" banner often means bland, uninteresting food.  These chefs clearly demonstrate you can have your cake and eat it too.  Speaking of pastry, the desserts reminded me of some I've had in high end patisseries in Paris.  Both of the chefs are on their way up and will be big names someday.  Get here sooner than later, and order the Chef's Tasting Menu for a great demonstration of what they can do.

1808578,2016-09-06,9,gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g,"There are plenty of places in Vegas that make food that is pretty enough to be art. But those places are usually on the Strip, ridiculously priced, and likely just as bad for your waistline as your wallet. Enter Eatt: a French-run bistro-style lunch joint with a focus on healthy, fresh foods. I don't think I could have dreamed it up.

Over the past month, I've been by a handful of times and tried the majority of the menu. Favorites include the quiche (perfect for a late breakfast!), the salmon club (it even travels well!), and the ratatouille rolls (I grab them as a side for my protein at home). The broccoli-guacamole was an interesting app (and I'd love to see what they could do with a pea version!) but the desserts are where they shine.

The menu lists which desserts are healthier and which are more indulgent, which is helpful as they all look amazing. The strawberry-rhubarb macaron (healthy side) was a delight, but the Exotic Fruits (combining coconut, passion fruit, and matcha) recommended by the staff was even better, reminding me of Yonaka's desserts with the beautiful plating and Japanese flavor influence. 

Staff provides excellent service, Nicolas in particular always looks genuinely happy to help each patron. The interior is a fun mix of modern furniture and garden decor accents, complete with miniature terrariums on the tables. So glad this spot opened in such a convenient location- now I can grab a great meal before or after the gym, without compromising on flavor or my goals!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,18,4,Ao8QlDUtnHtA1HK9DYrHjA

Our whole experience here from start to finish was unbelievable. First, I had to call and find out if they had TVs because my husband *had* to watch some football game (don't get me started). Jessica who answered the phone said they usually leave them off at night but that she would turn one on to the game for my high maintenance husband. 

When we arrived, the game was indeed on and we got a table where the hubs could watch the Kansas City Chiefs crush the Chargers while sipping his Pinot Noir. Cool. Next up, our server Alex.

Alex is hilarious and a totally nice dude. He made great recommendations for us on the meal. I went with the vegan options and they were bomb dot com (nobody says that anymore but IDC). I regret not doing the five course tasting menu because the food was THAT good. I ordered the vegan dessert even though I was kind of ""meh"" about the idea of dark chocolate with mango and pineapple but it was SO delicious.

I started with the broccomole which is their take on guacamole but made with broccoli. It was really clean and delicious served with some semi stale tortilla chips. I got the tuna Niçoise salad which came with a very subtle tasting dijon dressing that was a bit too thick but it did pair well with the salad. All in all it was very good and I would order it again. For my entree I got the chicken with pea purée. The chicken was kinda bland but it's saving grace was the purée because it was delicious and gave it flavor. The sauce or reduction got hardened before it got to my table so it was disappointing that I couldn't really try it. There were also some pieces of pancetta on the plate and I don't remember seeing it in the description which sucks since I don't eat pork :/ I just set it aside. I love their concept on healthy, clean eating. The presentation looked great on everything I got and I can appreciate all the fresh ingredients but I had better expectations.

It is the rare restaurant where the entire experience leaves me saying at the end of the meal, ""Ya know if you put that proverbial gun to my head, I really couldn't tell you which dish I liked best.  They were all superb.""  

From my meal tonight:  Melon rolled around prosciutto with balsamic watermelon.  The melon not too sweet, the prosciutto not too salty, presented as a beautiful flower on my plate, easy to eat, and simply balanced.  Baguettes with goat cheese and caramelized onions.  The right heaviness of the bread, the right balance of sweetness of onions to the not too salty goat cheese.  A perfectly poached piece of king salmon surrounded with ravioli stuffed with spinach and cheese.  Ravioli cooked al dente in the right amount of salt water; cheese that accented but did not take away from the natural flavors of the spinach or pasta; and a delicate foam that added but didn't overpower the beautiful piece of fish.  Dessert:  As tasty as it was pretty -- Light as air pistachio mousse with raspberry fillings, fresh raspberries and a cookie with just the right amount of salt to contrast the simple sweeter flavors.

It is healthy gourmet cuisine with beautiful presentations in a casual, comfortable setting. The vegan and gluten free options are abundant and unique. Many of the dishes are available as grab and go items for convenience, but I had the opportunity to dine in and enjoy a few items served on nice plates. Service was excellent and the chef visited the dining area to greet the guests.

The ratatouille rolls resembled a tapas portion. This suited me just fine because I don't like being served large portions and I wanted to try a dessert, but I know many people think differently. The beautiful hibiscus poached pear decorated with toasted almonds was the first item to catch my eye in the display so I ordered that for dessert. It was glazed perfectly with the hibiscus reduction. I'd love this dessert even more if it was filled with almond cream or served with ice cream, so I took it home to add a scoop since they didn't have any at the restaurant.

Spend over $20 for a chance to spin the prize wheel. I was very lucky to win a free dessert on my next visit, so I will be back very soon. I'm looking forward to the burrata salad and trying more sweets designed by eatt's talented pastry chef.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,13,8,4,7h0FOZQDvYVcYR6kRIDRFg

So we came here and we're NOT disappointed. I honestly, have nothing negative to say. Together we had 6 dishes and then 2 desserts, sharing it all. The decor was clean and bright and I loved the feel inside. We decided on two of their baguette with toppings, the summer salad, and the octopus carpaccio. First of all, the octopus was amazing! Pickled veggies and citrus on top!!!! Something different and such a great combo. Then the summer salad with fruit and freeze dried balsamic. Beautiful and delicious. My favorite was the goat cheese baguette. Oh my word. Carmelo was dominos and warm goat cheese, candied pecans and freeze dried honey chips.... so much yes...
Our other baguette was tipped with prosciutto and tomatoes and pesto... delicious as well. 
We finished with the ""exotic"" dessert and the cream puffs. Both were great. Coconut, matcha, and passion fruit flavors really were a great way to end. And the hazelnut cream puffs... yup.

Everything tasted so good and made with such love and care! We were wowed by all the exquisite presentations and different methods of cooking. Our butternut veloute had delicious coffee foam on top, the salmon was cooked medium rare to perfection with a variety of vegetables to complement, the duck breast was so tender and juicy and went really well with the sweet potato purée, and my goodness the desserts were bomb - cream puffs that tasted like Ferrero rocher and exotic coconut mousse green tea pastry with passion fruit coulis. The only lackluster dish was the cabbage stuffed chicken. We all tried it and agreed it was just alright. Their salmon and duck breast were amazing though so order the right stuff! Oh oh forgot to mention, their raw oysters were one of the best we've had! The manager said they're from Japan but we forgot to ask which kind. They made an excellent mignonette, just like how the French do it of course. (I wish they actually spell out this word on the menu so people learn this word instead of tabasco! I have respect for oysters.) on top of that they even made a mini pancake with whipped cream and dill on top to complement the oysters! That was amazing!!!

Service was very friendly. The manager and chef came to greet and talk to us, and our server gave food recommendations and knew exactly was in the food and where they came from. It's definitely a Michelin star experience without the Michelin price tag!

The bread was perfectly toasted and the sandwich was a great combination of flavors. The Tiramisu is served is a cup with layers of flavors and topped with crispy chocolate and coffee streusel. The Spin the Wheel is a great option. It was a full meal and a  good value. 
Kudos to the kitchen for using quality products and providing a variety of choices.

3253198,2017-02-16,7,gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g,"I've been to this place about 10 times and all I have to say is I LOVE EATT !
I really enjoyed the Summer menu and I now like the Winter menu as well.

Former Michelin star chef Yuri and pastry chef Vincent from L'Oustau de Baumanière in Les Baux de Provence, France opened this restaurant with Nicolas the funny manager who has been on TV ;)))) and now Aymeric, another French chef.

Every dish from the appetizers, entrees to the deserts is first of all a huge pleasure for the eyes and nose. The presentation is outstanding and the smell with the mixture of flavors and spices extremely invited to try and eat everything.

The lunch time offers quiches and salads too and all kind of light options that will fill you until dinner time. Grab and go available. They have homemade drinks like unsweetened raspberry lemonade and iced-teas.

For dinner my favorites are the butternut velouté soup with mushroom ravioli and coffee foam that had a rich nutty flavor.  They had for the summer a tartine with cherry tomatoes, burrata (creamy mozzarella cheese) and basil pesto that was so fresh and we could taste the best quality olive oil they use. Now the winter option is a roasted goat cheese with candied pecan nuts, onions and honey tartine. Delicious as well, honey and goat cheese are such a good combination !

They serve also chicken pot-au-feu, grilled salmon cooked to your taste, duck, all high standard ingredients that are just prepared to perfection.
They also offer vegetarian and vegan options.

Deserts : you have to have'em all !!! The puff pastry that is called Paris-Brest in France, soft crunchy crust and creamy praline feeling, the exotic which combines coconut mousse with passion fruit caramel on a green tea biscuit, just to live for, and the traditional cheesecake. Be sure that you never had a real cheesecake before you tried this one. I prefer the one in the Summer with raspberry than the Winter one with tangerine but stil is very good.

Nice wine list to pair any of those dishes.

The portions are smaller than American standards but fits perfectly what you expect from that kind of high quality food and it's so filling that you couldn't eat more anyway. Just appreciate every bite.

Thank you Eatt for giving us the opportunity to get fine, exquisite, healthy and affordable French food off the Strip, just around the corner.",kG2muG7eit_AzZMcBCMArQ,11,10,5,LkzX5btuKf-ZCJ9WhrOLDA

It was SO hot inside the restaurant , I asked them if the air was on and they said it was as low as they could get it . At the end of the meal I was dripping sweat because it was that hot . They need to fix their air or get a new unit because when it's 110 outside I don't want to sit in a restaurant that's 85 degrees . 
Also the ceviche was served with tortilla chips from a bag  you could get from the grocery store, it wouldn't be tough to make them their own or make a plantain chip .

I came here on a Saturday morning with two friends, and the menu was explained in its entirety to us, and everything sounded so tasty. We definitely over-ordered, but everything we sampled was outstanding. We ordered two of the savory French toast topped with smoked salmon and a poached egg, followed by the chicken pot au feu, my duck with vegetables, the seafood pasta, and a steak. To finish the meal, we had the tapioca pudding, and the praline puffs. Everything was beyond what I would have thought from a place located in a small plaza.

I can for a quick lunch during the week and was immediately seated as the restaurant was virtually empty before noon. I ordered the salmon sandwich and the butternut soup. The sandwich came with a few slices of thin salmon and built in veggies; very good but not immediately better than anywhere else in town. The butternut soup was excellent. A true yellow color with mushrooms and fantastic croutons on the inside.

The food is a dream.  My ""Scottish salmon"" was perfect, tender, cooked to a perfect medium, with a creamy cauliflower salad that was instagrammable.  They have interesting and healthful offerings, such as the hibiscus lemonade.

The 6 oz of meat was drowned (yes, completely smothered) in a mushroom puree sauce. Why so much sauce? There was more sauce than meat and the sauce was tasteless. The meat was accompanied by a small ramekin of potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were undercooked and again the dish was tasteless. I expected some flavor but nothing. And my dish overall looked horrible. A ton of bland brown sauce covering two lumps of meat and a side of bland potatoes. No garnish. Seriously, no vegetables or something to make the dish look appetizing? No way a Michelin star chef made this dish. It was an embarrassment. The portions were very small, too. The worst part is the dish cost $34, insanely expensive for a small steak and a small portion of potatoes. Since I didn't eat the potatoes I basically paid a ton for a piece of meat. I left feeling ripped off.  And, note to the owner, if your AC is not working could you at least put ice in the water? I cannot believe how hot it was and not one effort was made to make the guests more comfortable. Maybe offer a cool drink on the house? The heat made me so uncomfortable eating.

The savory dishes for the most part were lacking in seasoning.  The presentation is exceptionally good looking and make the food something you want to dig into.  When we got to the chicken, we both mentioned about it needing something even just plain salt.  It wasn't until later that I saw on a table where the artificial sweeteners were, there were also salt and pepper grinders.  Too late.  The chicken and later the angus beef were lacking in seasoning.

Moving past the savory dishes and moving to dessert showed where Eatt shines at the present time.  A favorite of mine was the tiramisu prepared and presented in quite a different manner.  The poached peach with a nougat center and sprinkled with some pistachio pieces and the praline puffs were very well executed and were quite good.

There were four of us for dinner, and we ordered 5 entrees, and a few appetizers, all to share. There wasn't a single thing that we wouldn't order again. The soups were outstanding the goat cheese appetizer was mouth watering, and the salmon was out of this world! There was a vegetarian entree that was also quite delicious, and the pasta dish was filling without being heavy. Dessert was a whole new level of mind blowing. The passion fruit squares LITERALLY brought tears to my eyes. The coconut chia parfait was good, but couldn't compete with the passion fruit dessert that I tried first. The cream puffs were also quite tasty but again, the passion fruit dessert won my heart and nothing could compare. 

I WILL fly to Las Vegas just to eat dinner at Eatt. It is a hidden gem, off the strip, and not pretentious at all. What an incredible restaurant, with staff and owners that truly care about the food they are serving their customers. You will not be disappointed by choosing to dine here over any of the fancy fine dining spots on the strip.

The place is so unassuming and generic outside that we almost passed... what a mistake that would have been!  My daughter had the salmon blinis, and I had gazpacho to start; both beautifully presented and very nice flavours; both decent portion sizes.  She went on to have the filet special; I chose a tartine of goat cheese, pecans and caramelised onion with some magically puffed honey. Oh and the bread is flown in par baked from Paris and is the bomb! We ended with the macaron with apple, and chocolate cake.  I can honestly say that this was in the top five meals I've eaten in my fifty four years, and I have travelled to fifty states and been blessed to have eaten in many very chic and upscale restaurants.  Our server was lovely and prompt. The owner introduced himself and I wished him great success.

+Let's talk food first! Thought the food was all-around very good. I got the pork tenderloin which was a fascinating mix of flavors and items mixed with one another from the mixture of a pea puree with the sweet onion-filled filo. I also got their take on a mini-cheesecake. Although I still prefer a regular cheesecake, it reminded me more of a very light and hollow cake filled with jelly once you open it up. Super creative and interesting. 
+Also got the cocktail which was a homemade raspberry syrup mixed into champagne which was solid. 
+One other food point about the food, the presentation is on point and thoughtful. Loved their take on the jelly-filled cheesecake where it oozed out upon breaking it open.
+Personally think the pricing is not too pricey at around $15+ for the entree. With a drink and dessert, it came out to around $40.  Menu items seem to vary from appetizers to sandwiches/salads/entrees/desserts. There's also an interesting spin-the-wheel option that is like a combo deal of random items which was interesting.
+Decor is super clean/modern. 
+Not too busy at all on a Friday around noon. Was able to easily get a seat. 
+Staff is super friendly and informative. The server (sorry, forgot your name!) was very helpful in choosing the right dishes.  
+Parking seemed pretty plentiful if you drive. (I came by Lyft from the Vegas Strip which is about a 20-minute drive.)

And when I do eat out, it's always tempting to eat the wrong thing (because it's there) or drive everyone nuts with questions about how food is prepared. Eatt (7865 W. Sahara, Las Vegas) appears to know me and others like me. 

My first visit exceeded what I thought was possible of a healthy quickserv restaurant. From the crisp interior design and knowledgable staff, to the presentation and taste of the food, Eatt is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas food scene. And one doesn't have to battle traffic or out-of-towners to get there. Located on the west side of Las Vegas, it's convenient for anyone living in Summerlin or a 5-10-mile radius thereof. 

As for the food, I started with the Broccoli Guacamole and gluten-free chips. In an inappropriately hyphenated word, out-of-this-world! Thinly sliced cherry tomatoes kept surfacing into my chips, and the taste of broccoli in every bite was pleasantly unexpected. 

My sandwich -- on toasted gluten-free bread that did not flake or fall apart -- was marinated salmon, lettuce, mint, and a very thin layer of Greek yogurt infused with dill. Again, amazing! 

For desert, I tried (okay, who are we kidding -- there was no ""tried"" -- only slowly devoured) the Macron... a gluten-free almond powdered biscuit topped with light vanilla cream, strawberry and rhubarb. Again, absolutely delightful looking and tasty. 

Fronted by two chefs who last year were named Las Vegas' Best Personal Chefs (the two of them were), and a front-of-the-house manager with multiple business degrees and experience working with chefs across Europe, Eatt is a can't miss for anyone requiring or desiring clean food with flare at affordable prices.",k3bJCAl5qFPKokefMvl4jw,4,3,5,5-6qn-rWDWoUMe1xt41F6Q

I'm in a lamb phase, this is true. The cut was spectacular, just the right amount of pink. There's a Chinese 5-spice in the purée and au jus and now I want to try everything on the menu. It's those subtle hints that let a gastro gal know the chef likes to play.

This place is both lovely and relaxing an I have enjoyed coming in here after my workouts. I have not been disappointed or underwhelmed with the flavors. They know very well how to make something healthy but not make it taste like it, and I love that. 

The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I feel like I'm underdressed every time I walk in. I understand it is a bistro. But they depict themselves as being casual.

Dislikes:  their lunch time sandwiches.  I wouldn't recommend any of these.  I had the hot dog one and the lamb one, both of which were underwhelming in quantity and taste.

We had a delicious dinner here from start to finish! Highly recommend everything we ordered and we'll certainly be back to try other dishes.

We started with the artichoke & burrata and the beef carpaccio. Both were fantastic. The artichoke dish had a good sized portion of burrata which was a nice surprise. I order beef carpaccio or steak tartare every time it's on a menu so I'm equipped to tell you that this one was wonderful. The chef added little bits of smoked eel which I hadn't seen done before. If you didn't know it was eel, you wouldn't have noticed so don't let that detract you from ordering this delicious appetizer.

For entrees we had the Lamb Wellington which was cooked perfectly and was very yummy and the Salmon. The salmon was also cooked perfectly and was a high quality piece of fish. The nicest surprise on the plate was the spinach ravioli which I expected to be stuffed w/minced up spinach and cheese. Instead, it was stuffed with only fresh spinach! A delightful bite of fresh spinach and house made ravioli as an accompaniment to a beautiful piece of fish.

Sadly, we were too full for dessert. The service was good, quick and efficient.

We can't wait to return. They are also open for lunch which we'll certainly come back for as well.

Opened by three friends from France just over a month ago, Eatt Healthy Food has been promoted by several in the local industry as a place on the rise, and invited in by General Manager Nicolas Kalpokdjian for a lunch crafted by Chefs Yuri Szarzewski and Vincent Pellerin the restaurant shows signs of inspiration, though the end product still has a ways to come.

Promoting what the restaurant describes as ""healthy gourmet recipes adapted to your diet offered with seasonal ingredients,"" and doing a great diligence in detailing the menu with food allergies, sensitivities and exclusions for dairy, gluten, nuts plus meat, the first impression of Eatt is generated by the brilliant white and clean lines, a modern feel that seems sterile despite plants on walls as well tables while a television hangs awkwardly near the door as though every restaurant in town cannot afford to be without.

Greeted by all three members of the team throughout the stay, one female server assisting with plates, the meal began with a flaky housemade Croissant that rivals many in the city, though the butter-soaked bottom somewhat compromises the shell's integrity while the Chocolate version and Seasonal Danish advertised on the menu were both apparently sold-out.

Told by Nicolas that the restaurant typically offers a few off-menu specials, on this day a delicate Ravioli stuffed with finely diced Vegetables topped with poached Lobster in a Shellfish Bisque, dishes like this show the high degree of technical skill offered by Chef Szarzewski, though unfortunately several to follow would fall short by yielding to ""healthy"" constraints.

Told that the Salmon has quickly become the restaurant's best seller, the thin filet marinated before being placed atop a coil of Sprouts, Apples and Beets, plating at Eatt is unsurpassed at its pricepoint and although a sweeter apple plus some acid may have helped this dish better show the complexity of its flavors it was easily the best entrée offered, the Chicken virtually flavorless even with the Bacon imbued Broth while the radiant Ratatouille helped to prop up tender strips of Angus that again had the table looking for a shaker of salt.

A bit disappointed at this point, but finding the vegetables to be highlights of each plate, it was with good fortune that the Mushroom Quiche and a side of ""Broccoli Guacamole"" was requested, the former making good use of the lightest amount of Truffle Oil to accent Shitakes and Leeks in a fluffy Egg Custard while the later was creamy, cool and vibrant on gently salted Crisps.

Appreciating the concept both as a physician and diner, the need for well-priced alternatives to ""quick-casual"" staples like Panera, Chipotle and others something the nation surely needs, it was here that Pastry Chef Pellerin took over the tasting, a poached Peach showcasing the season with a Nougat core and crushed Pistachios in light Syrup while the linear Brest, liquid-centered Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Pure Chocolate Cake were all individually portioned and full-flavored rivals to what several restaurants have to offer at an inflated price-point on the Strip.

*** Acknowledging that healthy means different things to different people, one person's Veganism or anti-GMO Politics irrelevant to a patient with Diabetes following a low-carb diet or the Hypertensive adhering to DASH Guidelines, there is a point where ""taste"" must be incorporated into every recipe, something that the EATT team will hopefully find a way to exemplify while still sticking to the concept they hope to promote.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,3,bgT6ZxIbLOnUB_hP-FTPdQ

5432370,2017-07-16,0,gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g,"Sometimes you go to a place and you feel so good about the experience that you want to go back ASAP and bring friends. Then, you go the second time and it is an unmitigated disaster. That was my experience with Eatt. My first stop was with my wife on July 6. We arrived at the opening, were seated by friendly staff with whom we were immediately able to establish a great rapport. We had a magnificent meal - I particularly loved the octopus carpaccio, my wife the gazpacho and the Tuna and salmon carpaccio. We both had a wonderful fish dinner - no dessert, the portions were sufficient, not too much not too little. The list of beers available is limited - none of which I'd rate superior, but in a pinch, I can drink a Stella. They have a few good, wines but the focus of the place is not the wine list - but the food and it was simply marvelous. I could say nothing but good things about it and started recommending it to everyone I spoke to. So ... we went back with friends on July 15. BIG difference in the quality of the food and atmosphere. We arrived at 6:30 instead of 5.00 PM. There was already a sizeable party seated and partaking in their dinner and drinks.  Let's say the table had 14 to 18 people. There were other tables already occupied. The wait staff was overwhelmed. Friendly, sure. But it seemed to me that there was the same number of waitstaff for about 30 people as there had been for half that number. And the service suffered for it. Additionally, the air-conditioning either was off completely, broken or so mal-functional that sweat was literally rolling off the top of my bald head. Yes, it is Las Vegas, and yes when you are seated in a place that has a large window facing West (even though covered) you expect it to be warmer than someplace else, but I don't enjoy going out for dinner and sweating. (Vegas restaurants are usually cold so I wear an undershirt as well as a shirt to make sure I am warm enough.) I ordered the octopus carpaccio, my wife again the gazpacho and the octopus carpaccio as a main. One of our friends ordered the octopus carpaccio as an appetizer. For the main, I ordered the filet of sea bass. I had two forkfulls of the octopus carpaccio and noticed - not the same. It wasn't the moist, fresh tasting appetizer of a few days before. My friend noticed as well that the fish was dry. I figured I'd be able to remedy the situation by getting some olive oil.  It took so long to get noticed (we were seated pretty much in the middle of the restaurant with four people trying to flag waitstaff) that everyone else had practically finished their appetizer by the time I managed to speak to a waiter. I was so agitated that the waiter suggested he bring it back to the kitchen. It finally arrived with the requested olive oil - and by the time everyone else was done with their first course. By now my wife wasn't looking forward to the carpaccio as the main. (My friend had finished his because he was not going to wait too long.) Restauranteurs - if you are going to have a table with a large number of guests, don't have the same number of waitstaff that you have for a normal evening. If you have three people working the tables, you cannot have two maintaining things for the larger party leaving one to rush for the others. My main arrived - and while not ""cold"" it certainly wasn't hot. The underlying mousse substance probably could have been tastier had it been warmer. My fish (surely not the 8 ounces I was expecting) seemed like it just came out from under a heat lamp. In short, my main was more or less tasteless. TASTELESS. Fortunately, they had brought some olive oil out for my wife's carpaccio - also dry, and I was able to put some on top of my fish - so my main did get some flavor, from the olive oil. (Which - was very good!) I wanted to leave, but my friends had their hearts set on macarons. We stayed. The description of the cheese cake sounded good, so I took that - and it was somewhat redeeming. But all and all - a tremendous disappointment. Since the place is three minutes by car from my home, I was looking forward to a place to just go to when we don't want to cook for ourselves. I am reevaluating my thinking. I still will gush over the first visit - which I would rate four stars - and will recant this episode as well to all who will listen. One thing is for sure - IF I ever walk through their doors again and there is a party table, I will turn right around and walk out.

My husband and I went there tonight for my birthday dinner.

The food along with its presentation was wonderful!!!!! Loved every single bite from appetizer to desert 
Our waitress and here's where I embarrass myself because I'm usually a stickler for remembering names (I think it was Jess) she was Fantastic.. so thank you to her!
Chef Yuri personally came out to greet us and asked how our meal was; which we made sure to let him it was fantastic!!

Update since my review: 
Spoke with the owner, shared my experience, he advised thy my concerns had been addressed, and welcomed me to come back and try their delicious dishes. I appreciate Nicolas reaching out to me and taking time to listen and take action.

Starting with the raspberry lemonade...did not have much flavor of lemonade, let alone hardly any flavor or essence of raspberry.  The Chicken wrap was flavorless although a bit better than the Ham and Cheese on a french baguette.   This was totally flavorless, and the bread was not very good. I've tasted a lot of french baguettes over the years, but this was not good at all.  It tasted kind of like frozen bread from a grocery store.  No garnish on either plated sandwich.  The price came to $30 which was not worth it for a flavorless meal.   Definitely add a bit of salt.   It was nicely decorated and very clean.",QdPY0W7WIgBZrzRuL1lZMA,1,0,2,eBe6tz0LBxiN-j9uuZm2Gg

The decor is cute and they have alcohol, not that it is most important but it is a plus! The menu was very limited, so if you're looking for options I wouldn't recommend it.  

I ordered the salmon wrap and regretted it.  It is cured and the mayo used doesn't compliment the texture.  I did send it back and ordered the ham and cheese sandwich.  Warning: The ham and cheese sandwich is literally ham, cheese, and bread.  It is not warmed up, it is cold, and tastes like a 3rd grader made it.  The best part of this lunch experience was the tiramisu.

5902799,2017-04-30,2,gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g,"Easily, hands down one of my favorites restaurants in Vegas.

THE HIGHLIGHTS
They were super flexible in adapting the 5 course tasting menu to my pescatarian diet and made sure we didn't have any other dietary restrictions.

The wine pairing went perfectly with the meal; we ended up getting three glasses of white wine, about 8 oz each.

The service was seriously impeccable. Our server was super friendly and warm, knowledgable about the menu, and incredibly attentive. They made sure we enjoyed every dish and slowed down the pace of our meal so we could enjoy our wine (which there was a lot of). I can't overstate how good the service is.

The quality of ingredients, the attention to detail, the presentation, and the flavors are all reasons that make the food amazing.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Out of everything, my favorite appetizer was the octopus carpaccio. My favorite entree was the red snapper with zucchini and red pepper purée, and my favorite dessert was the raspberry macaron with lemon cream.

OVERALL
The food was deliciously amazing. The wine pairings went perfectly with our meal, and the service only elevated the experience. I definitely, definitely, recommend this place, and I can't want to come back!

TIP: definitely don't skip out on dessert here. The dessert was seriously so good, after trying two, we ordered another to go!",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,8,4,5,m55DzgY27gy9wwCsyGH6aQ

Well, the last couple of years, we've been eating healthier more often.  So when my niece chose Eatt Gourmet Bistro to meet, my wife and I were quite excited.

You won't find this charming restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip so don't expect to walk here.  They are worth finding if you like healthy eating.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  Staff was attentive and helpful.

Food was on the pricey side.  Not a surprise because eating ""clean"" is not cheap.  So how did the food taste?  I liked the Salmon and Tuna Ceviche appetizer which came with gluten free tortilla chips.  For the price, I thought the portion was too small.  Both the Ham & Cheese sandwich and the Salmon sandwich tasted good.  Honestly, though, we make them better at home using healthy organic ingredients as well.  

The desserts that we tried had the ""WOW"" factor which I was hoping for.  Make sure to save room for dessert!!  The Exotic was yummy.  The Macaron was divine!  The Cheesecake with Raspberry coulis was exceptional!!
