We got fed up waiting as at least 3 servers who past us back and forth multiple times and we've yet to be greeted. It wasn't even busy or full and we were sitting there waiting for our server to come by. By the end of 10 minutes of waiting since we sat down we knew what drink and what food to order but another 10 minutes went by with no one acknowledging us and we got fed up with it. But the servers apparently had enough time to visit other guests and chat with them. This is not the first time we've had awful service and long wait times but at least we were greeted briefly but apparently even with new management and people it is still slow and terrible service. Go to the Lake Mead/rainbow in Summerlin or the one in Henderson location. You'll get better service than the Fort Apache/Tropicana!,wvqaLdbaK8h-lutRpXm2mQ,0,0,1,JjA8NKhKaEWc8Sd6Iprnow

Food- It was great, the veggies were a bit on the over cooked side because it was supper soggy.

Martini- I was in the service business for some time, but the use of a jigger is pretty routine for a commercialized business. My martini was just fruit juice in a fancy cup, come on people use the tools of the trade or at least the flash cards to build a drink. 

Service- Ooooh my! When ever you have a hostess seating and taking orders and waiting tables and might I add covering other tables ""it's a no win situation"" for the guest. The service in short, sucked! Two people covering the floor and no manager to be found in eye sight!

892194,2012-08-12,0,8J4oT58-Nc-q1bpF9CRTpw,"As Las Vegas residents we have seen and done just about everything and then some! This is one place we keep going back to time and time again. 

Each time we visit we find the place to be clean, comfortable and teeming with friendly, capable staff. From the moment we walk in to the moment we walk out of the door, the staff seem to go above and beyond. 

We have two small children, so patience is definitely appreciated! The food always comes out delicious and within a reasonable amount of time. 

I realize that people (on here especially, sheesh!) tend to knock on the food, calling it precooked and reheated etc. What you have to keep in mind is that people need to consider Applebees fast food with a bigger selection and nicer seating area. Its a bit more expensive than most chain fast food stores, but that's because you DO get better food, more/better service and we have yet to leave dissatisfied!

If you want fine, fresh dining then you probably don't want to go to a place like Chilis or Applebees. These exist for the purposes of a laid-back family friendly version of ""sit-down dining"". Instead, if you feel like you're not getting Michelin star quality cuisine, go to one of the casino restaurants, or a place on the strip and blow all your money there...

So for her full price dinner my daughter are potato chips. What?

My rubles were overlooked and fries over seasoned. My mother in law had the fiesta chicken. The only fiesta was the greasy cheese that was completely costing the tiny piece of chicken. It was so disgusting looking. 

And don't think you're going to get refills. Even while looking at empty glasses our server walked away. I stopped her to ask for refills after she started walking away.

The Mac n cheese with the honey pepper chicken. Usually when I get it, the chicken is already covered in the honey pepper sauce and it's delicious. The three times I have come here, there is either no sauce on the chicken... Or it's BARELY speckled on. The third time I came here I specifically asked my server to make sure that the chicken was already tossed in the sauce. And I was excited because it's delicious.. however when I got my food (as you will see in the picture) there still was no sauce on my chicken. That really annoyed me that I had to specifically ask for my meal to be prepared as it appears on the menu, and it still didn't. It was like having an overly fried chicken finger on top of my pasta. Secondly when we got our blondie, which we also get every time, it was stale and old. You could tell it was not fresh or even made that day. The texture felt like expired bread and it wasn't even warm. I always assumed they reheated the brownies anyway but this one was just disgusting and did not taste like dessert at all.

I'd give him five stars for an amazing effort. :) However, I don't think they had enough people working or maybe people called in for the President's Day weekend?? Idk.....

Pros - The place was clean and the food was a good value. We ordered mozzarella sticks which were crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. My daughters Mac n Cheese was eaten quickly and with no complaints. My younger daughter ordered the chicken strips and they did a solid job there. Next, I had a side salad and the Tortilla soup. The tortilla soup really hit the spot! The salad was fresh, and nicely prepared. 

Cons- Super busy with customers and although they tried -- it appeared like the staff couldn't keep up. For example, another server brought us our food and she gave us the wrong items -- but quickly got us the right plates. Our ""real server"" was running around constantly with drinks and other orders. I found this location to be loud and crowded - which we didn't mind at all - but some folks might. 

Personally, I like the Applebee's in Henderson on Stephanie better. That location (in my experience) pays more attention to the customer and it isn't a ""rat race"" feeling.

I watched someone coming out of the kitchen through one door with 2 plates of burgers and disappear through another door,as I saw our waitress shaking her head, no. She then brought out our appetizer, and my husband told her we don't want it now, we'll have just the burgers if they are done. We don't want cold burgers.

The problem was the service.  I walked in and the host was talking to the manager about something not work related.  The host said hi, and then went back to talking.  After a few more seconds and after the manager looked at me and looked away, the host decided to ask if I'd like a table.  I said yes and that there would be one more joining me, so he took me to a table.  The server took about 6-7 minutes to come and greet me and I ordered my drink.  My friend came a few minutes later and I still hadn't gotten my root beer I ordered.  After a few more minutes, the server came back and asked for her drink order and she ordered a pepsi.  I still didn't have my root beer.  After about 10 minutes he comes back with both drinks and we order.  Food comes out fine and it tastes like what we expected but the server is no where in sight.  So in the hour we were there, we interacted with the server 4 times.  We both drank our drinks and needed refills and each time another server who happened to be walking by refilled them.

The reason I gave them two stars is because the food is the only thing that saved them from getting a one star review for their service.",pmWrP89IllBRkGf7ZUeCcw,0,0,2,QEunHpT66OtXa0bVRovHcg

And another 35 to get appetizers, ridiculous, my daughter was with us and she was not having it. Those with kids know what I'm talking about. 35 mins seems like an hour to them and when they're hungry, they are hungry. Someone has released the cracken. 

What probably ticked me off the most was when I asked for the bone in wings. She said they didn't have them. I said okay well then instead I will have the spinach dip. She then tried five times to convince me to get boneless wings. First time I said no I don't like them, then second I said it's okay thanks I'd rather go with the dip. After the third and continuously pushy way she tried to get me I ignored her and just stood forward looking at my husband to stop myself from being rude. I want bone in not boneless... Period.

Right. Now they are re-pushing their 2/$20 promo and $7 specialty seasonal drinks pretty heavily. All of the marketing thru the resteraunt and on their menu cards talk about one or the other. (A little too much advertising for my taste but that's just me.)

In terms of their food, obviously I think it's generally understood Applebees is a chain and do not have 5 star quality dishes. However, most night for a cheaper sit down service resteraunt they do alright.

Tonight I ordered the Boo Lagoon, spinach and artichoke dip appetizer and Burbon street chicken and shrimp 2/$20 dish. For me personally it became very obvious that some parts of my food were made earlier that day and then heated up to a boiling point when ordered.

Instead, she went right in front of us, turned around and looked at her list. Then she looked at people nearby, grabbed menus and proceeded going away. No hello, no nothing.

After waiting another 6 minutes she showed up again and AGAIN turned her back to us and was about to leave.

1 X Spicy Texas BBQ Unlimited RIBLETS, french fries, and coleslaw
1 X Mac N Cheese

The Honey BBQ tasted so good and very delicious. It did however had small bones in the ribs which you have to be careful of. The fries were very good no complaints of. Since I haven't had coleslaw for a while, I decided to try it and man, it taste delicious.

As for the Spicy Texas, my brother's portion, I tasted a little bit of his. His portion tasted ok, it didn't have any spicy taste to it and kind of tasted plain. I even gave my brother my portion of the Honey BBQ, and he loved it so much that he was jealous.

Me and my friend walk in and there's a few people in the waiting area..the hostess and the manager walk past us without a word..not sure of their names but the girl was a larger girl with faded red hair and the manager was a short man and African american..
I was and little surprised not one of them acknowledged us ..
Then the host grabs her silver ware and without even looking up at the two groups of people waiting to be seated she says okay who was here last..like excuse me..I'm fine thanks for asking..
The family ahead of us stated they were waiting on a both and she takes them to it..
The manager looks at us and says it will be a few minutes not even a greeting..my friend states we would like a booth and he says okay it'll be a few minutes and just stares at us..
Then he begins to clean a booth next to the waiting are and asks if it's okay. We say yes and he cleans it..
The hostess comes back and says he cleaned the booth for you guys right, again no greeting or smile..so rude..
So we sit down annndnd guess what now my annndnd is wet because the moron manager couldn't even clean the booth properly.
At this point I wanna go but then our server comes I think her name was adriana or something similar and thank got she waited on us. She was terrific, fast friendly I wish I could say her amazing service made up for the trip but then the food came..
We got the quesadilla burgers. .so gross and soggy and salty... we asked for napkins the manager gave us 3..then when he brought us our condiments he didn't even bother to walk.around to our table he was reached over the side and handed it to us..like what the heck I've never seen anything so unprofessional and rude and from the manager..
And the man has no people skills my friend took the meat outta her quesadilla burger halfway thru he asked her if she wanted something else..not even coming to the table just leaning over the side yet again..she said no thank you it was just to much meat for her taste and he asks if she's sure she states yes and he like stated her down then walked away..

I don't like how you have to respond to the touch screen to get a refill.  I like it when your waitress asks a quick question, ""how's the food?""  That touch screen eliminates human interaction.

3397247,2018-02-23,0,8J4oT58-Nc-q1bpF9CRTpw,"A run-of-the-mill neighborhood franchise. Service has been generally very friendly on our handful of visits over the years. As for food & drinks, I'll start with drinks - their Perfect Margarita is better than expected; they offer happy hour $4 apps, $3 draft & margaritas from 3-6pm & 9pm-Midnight. Monday nights they offer $6.99 burgers and fries all evening. These, their signature combos (soup+sandwich, salad+ their double dinners, with a shared appetizer are the best deal-wise.

Foodwise- have tried steaks & salads, for the most part. Hubby & I have had a few steaks and they are good in the flavor department, well seasoned. Although the sirloin isn't the most tender of cuts- they have done a good job preparing them to our preferred doneness (rare & medium rare.) I'm surprised when I get a true rare steak even in the highest-starred restaurants. Ceasar salad, French onion soup and the basic burger are also fine, though the soup is overly salty- I would guess it arrives frozen, not made in-house.

The restaurant feels and looks clean but the ladies restroom needs work- stray towels scattered, unkempt and off-putting.

I get a factory-feeling here. Similar to a place like O.G., I get the sense that their food is packaged in a warehouse somewhere and popped on the stove to warm in-house before serving- not necessarily bad, but I prefer local & fresh.

In sum, I'd say it is a 2.5 star experience, right in the middle- nothing great, nothing terrible.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,1,0,3,FKj_N-6QlU2cdQTp50XewQ

Food: 2 stars // Service: 3 stars // Price: 4 stars.

I came here on a Sunday Brunch this past weekend.  I met up with a couple friends who lived in the area and rather than stick with what I knew I left it up to our server.  Wrong choice.

The restaurant as a whole was clean and decorated like all the other Applebees.  It was steady and not overly busy which was nice.  When  the server came I asked him which of the margaritas he recommended for that Sunday and he told me the perfect margarita.  I could barely taste the alcohol in it, it was more sweet and sour than tequila.  

Next I asked which of the entree he recommends, the new Shrimp Jambalaya.  Ordered.  While waiting and conversing with good friends I drank my lemonade and didn't want to order another tequila but I stuck with Blue Moon.  

Jambalaya came!  Maybe I'm basing the taste to some really good jambalaya and so my standards were already high.  To put it plainly:  Tasted like it was lesser than a microwave jambalaya dinner.  It was bad, the pasta stuck together.  No kick in the taste.  Tasted bland.  The peppers being in it were out of touch and didn't blend well.  And where was the main topping of the jambalaya?  The shrimp?!

So come to find out our server who recommended the dish has never tasted it before.  =(  

So if I had not mixed my dish and the ingredients around, it wouldn't have looked like I touched it.  And the other person who ordered the same thing agreed about the taste.  I asked for a simple burger.  I won't let one bad dish lower the rating but I feel 3 stars is more than adequate at this time.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,1,0,3,t7EDq0FQjRpAvQNH-nBiOw

Not too thin/thick, good mix of non-cream cheese and spinach, comes with run of the mill tortilla chips.  

I have to say I am unable to recommend the cross cut ribs.  ""Cross cut"" is another word for ""bone chips"" which made it very difficult to find bites of meat without the risk of choking or chipping a tooth.  There are three sauces to try....I had smoky bbq and honey bbq.  Neither was finger lickin good.  There was also an unpleasant outer skin on the ribs.  On the plus side, the seasoned fries were very good!  The coleslaw had an odd, recently washed container taste to it.  

Our server, I believe named Crystal?, was great, she kept my iced tea glass full and was helpful with anything we needed.  Two managers were also kind enough to stop by and ask how things were going.

I sat there for a good 5 minutes before someone came to my window.  They read me my order and I paid.  I waited for another 10 minutes before I got my food.  I find this to be uncalled for as I ordered with plenty of time to make the food and I had a set time for pick up and this is now at least 15 minutes passed.  I finally got handed my food and headed home.  Once home we began to pull the food out and realized that there were things missing or incorrect.  The sauce for the mozzarella sticks was missing and the sides to one of the meals were incorrect.  Having gone over the order in the parking lot with the waitress I guess I expected what was discussed to be in the bag.  This made what was going to be a nice relaxing meal very upsetting.  I hope that your employees (ALL employees involved in the meal and transactions) begin to pay closer attention to the orders instead of making them up themselves.,1PvDk9-siiBuDSt73Jgi-Q,1,0,2,nANwXh_UaL7Bo33CcAREXQ

had the 2 for 20 deal which is totally a steal. we had the spinach dip which was extremely fresh and hot and delicious. the chips were thin and crispy and went well with the salsa that also comes with this appetizer. 

i ordered the provolone stuffed meatballs with fettuccine while my DC had the citrus lime chicken. i think that's the name of it. anyway.. my meatballs were really good but the fettuccine that came with was not so yummy. it was overcooked and sad. the white sauce was bland but was better after mixing it with the red sauce from the meatballs. the breadstick it came with was sad and undercooked. it was like those frozen ones you microwave.. 

the chicken entree was definitely much better. the chicken was super juicy and the rice it came with was good too. i was immediately jealous when i took a bite of this dish. 

got the maple butter blondie for dessert because my DC had been craving it for MONTHS. i prefer chocolate desserts.. especially ones with melty insides lol. so this was not a winner in my book. but it's just preference. 

anyway.. Quinton was extremely funny and friendly. like the kind of funny and friendly that makes your day. he was knowledgeable and professional as well. we definitely felt taken care of and i could tell he enjoys what he does.",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,1,1,4,YVYFe-C1-__VwiygPhgOGA

We've been to this location a few times before, but it was way different this time around. Our hostess was unfriendly, straight faced, unwelcoming, unpleasant, and rude. No smile, no welcome, she just asked how many and led us to a table. We prefer a booth, so we kindly asked if it were possible to get a booth. She said it would be a few minutes wait, we told her it was fine and we sat in the front waiting. She came to get us to seat is at our wet booth. She cleaned the table off but it was soaking wet when we sat down. We shrugged it off, just trying to enjoy our evening. We used the napkins that our utensils were wrapped in to dry the table ourselves. My fiancé ordered the 7oz steak, well done, but wanted to replace the seasonal vegetable with French fries and was told she couldn't. Instead of trying to please the customer and saying that it could be done but would be charged as an extra side, she just told us no. We ordered pretzels with cheese as our appetizer. Not good. The pretzels tasted like garlic breadsticks as opposed to actual pretzels and super doughy. And the white queso dip that came with it tasted weird, no flavor. I wish it would've came with beer cheese or something along those lines. It would have made more sense, taste wise. I ordered a club sandwich but wasn't asked what kind of bread, so when I received my sandwich, it was on white bread, I only eat wheat. What was even worse was when my fiancé cut into her steak, it was really pink all throughout the middle. We had to wait as our waitress passed us 3 times to explain to her that is wasn't cooked well enough. She sent it back to the chef to cook it a little longer, but when she brought it back out, it was still really pink throughout the middle. At this point, we're both cranky and hungry, so I ask for a to go box for my food and for them to just remove the steak order from our check so we can leave. She went to ask her manager to have the steak removed from our check and you would think the manager would come out to apologize on behalf of their staff or see if there was anything that could be done to satisfy us in any way, but no such thing. We received our check and to go box and we left hungry, dissatisfied, and in agreement to never return to Applebee's.

Like high prices for garbage? 

Then you will love Applebees!!! 

Pure disappointment was in store for me on my first and last visit. 

Not only was my dish a bland, cold, overly greasy fried mess, but my entire party had issues with all as well. 

Salads are OK, the only thing that may be their saving grace. 

Everything else is frozen precooked and heated food that taste as if had been sitting around awhile. 

The service was OK, however that is hit and miss as it really depends on the server you may end up with. It can go right or way wrong! That is the 50/50 chance you take dining out at the more commercial restaurants. 

There are just too many great places to eat in Las Vegas that are out of this world at a fraction of the cost! I would never again waste my money on below mediocre quality! 

The meals not creative, no flair or real flavor! Whoever is responsible for the menu planning needs to be dropped! Applebees come see me and I can give you a few great suggestion's on how to turn your bad menu into something wowing! 

Disappointed beyond all comprehension! 

Side note: 

*** The dish I had ordered was the buttermilk breaded fried shrimp, it is no longer on their menu and has now been replaced with a double crunch shrimp dinner. Wow what a shocker!!! 
Yes maybe the double crunch shrimp will fare better as the original menu item of the buttermilk fried shrimp was soggy and flavorless. 
I am sure many complaints were issued such as mine about such a horrid dish!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,13,10,1,Enmo-8bg2WS4IJXIKa_aIg

Everytime we come here it's crowded and the hostess just can't keep up with all the customers coming in. The last time I overheard someone saying ""I see many tables open here, why are you not seating people?"" Can't remember her name, but there is also one server who is very slow and I believe we had her twice within the past year. She took like 15 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders. After the food got to our table, we never saw her again. Thankfully, they have those pay at the table devices so we didn't have to wait for the check!

The food is usually good and there is a lot to choose from on the menu. Their Spinach Artichoke Dip is my favorite appetizer and is #2 on my list for chain restaurants - CPK has the best one! I wouldn't recommend getting a steak from here unless you want fork and knife struggles or your frustration level to rise, LOL. While I'm at it, thumbs down for serving Pepsi products.

2 stars because I like the food and the pay devices! Won't be returning to this location because they are slow AF!!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,2,2,q_rb9vOCUILEh6DbG6d4IQ

The food we had delicious  but the Cedar Grill Chicken  was fantastic - enjoyed every bite. - what a fantastic piece of chicken and served with Rice and an apple topping!!  Have had chicken at 5 star restaurants before but this was even better - definitely will go back again and have this dinner and sincerely recommend!!!",dkfsjupvMusboT6ddX1fpw,0,0,5,rf00IopL_gt9YGAluv2TGw
