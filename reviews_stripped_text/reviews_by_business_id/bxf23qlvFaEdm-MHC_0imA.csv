2797491,2013-05-24,4,bxf23qlvFaEdm-MHC_0imA,"Located inside the Mermaid Casino at the Fremont Street Experience, this place can easily be one of Downtown Las Vegas's best kept secrets. This place has been here forever yet this is only the second review to date.

For those that already know about this, when you make the trek to the Fremont Street Experience, as soon as you are anywhere near the Mermaid Casino, you will see big signs and banners of 99 cent Frozen Bananas, Deep Fried Twinkies and Oreos, and Hot Dogs. They have other options as well at reasonable prices but they purposely put out these specific pictures to draw people in and why not? 99 cents for the above mentioned items cant get any better than that. You folks that has been to Disneyland know that a frozen banana is now what, like 5 bucks? 

Just remember, this is located inside the casino so don't make the mistake of bringing your kids in there with you even though just getting food is your only reason, security will definitely kick you out. So have them wait outside with another parent or legal guardian while you get the goodies. Also they take CASH ONLY, so make sure you are ready. I think any ATM fees are worth the goodness you are about to scarf down.

As for their hours, on Fridays and Saturdays I think they close at either 11 or 12. Weekdays they close earlier. You would think they would be 24 hours since it is Vegas and all. 

Service is quite decent. You usually have at least 3 people working at all times. One to take your order, one to cook, and one to take your cash. On really busy nights expect the line to be pretty long. 

When you get your food, you can either stand at some of the chest high tables strewn about that's in front of the stand or just go outside and enjoy the sights as you eat. All the condiments you need are right there where you line up so no need to ask them.

On a side note, Hostess is no longer making twinkies but last time I was here, they still had some left so there's no guarantee they will still have some when you go there. That's ok though. You still have the other stuff. 

So any time you are in the area, make this as one of your stops for good but cheap food and don't forget to bring cash!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,7,8,4,FiB0sA0zy-Kgy-7-v3oJWg
3305114,2015-02-26,0,bxf23qlvFaEdm-MHC_0imA,"A great, unassuming place for a late snack. Not a fancy place but that's what I expected, especially after I saw there were no seats. I can't penalize them for what they are. Some reviews called it a hole, well yes, it is, you go here after you've already had your fill of prime rib or a massive steak at the fancy restaurants at the strip. Hot dogs were s great as you would expect. Fries are piping hot and so good. The White Castle sliders are so-so, no different as what you will taste when you buy those multi-packs at Costco. Still, it was an experience, I am glad I did not stand in line too long here, and I avoided that White Castle line-hype at the strip.",9LX0aIyVbmhfEjqJEbt4ZA,0,0,4,qEE4v5Pb35x4vI7w68o0mw

This Nathan's Hot Dogs is located within the Mermaid Casino on Fremont Street. This small casino sure can draw a crowd! The line in the back for food was crazy! Must be some good stuff .  Perhaps because a lot of fried options are also offered here. Nathan's was the long line and we decided not to wait in it on the first visit.

A couple of days later we were back for more gambling at the Mermaid and husband and I waited in a much shorter, but still good-sized line. 3 Hot Dogs for $3.21!  They were ready quickly and a small stand had mustard and katsup. The bread was pretty dry but the few bites of the h'dogs I had were pretty good. Hard to make a bad hot dog I guess. They weren't huge but were bigger than I expected for $1.

3829877,2016-06-02,0,bxf23qlvFaEdm-MHC_0imA,"Nightmare. Still puking. First the employees were rude. Actually first they got they got my order wrong LOL. The guy who screwed up my order ( brat, no bun, kraut, pickles) groaned and told someone else to do it. The female employee who took over the monumental task placed three pickle chips on my brat. I asked for more. She said it's would be an additional 81 cents. She then told me that I was going to charged for three toppings. Then she said, oh I forgot you have a brat. The kraut comes with. That truly upset her. She tried to shame me into the 81 cents. I said I just wanted the brat with as much kraut as I was allowed. She then snarled ""It's only 81 cents. What's wrong with you!"" ""I won't pay that for 3 pickle chips."" She snarls back ""where are you from?"" I reply ""heaven, the opposite of you."" 

My friend was embarrassed, kept telling me to just pay the 81 cents. I guess he did not realize that I was not expecting him to pay.  He got two hotdogs. I got another one for my husband. I had the brat with a *garnish of kraut. 

The hotdogs and the brat were close to raw.

It's all you need. If you are insomuch as tempted by anything else, you are probably a freedom-hating commie! (And the staff will recognise it.)

This summer (2014), they went through a much needed renovation of the dining area; however, it is still located inside Mermaid's Casino, which is a smoky, dilapidated place of public accommodation. No, there is still no seating. (Eating while standing is not going to kill you [but those fried twinkies and oreos might.])

Yes, new and improved: they now even accept credit, debit, and charge cards! (They reluctantly stumbled their way into the twenty-first century.)

Have yourself a Nathan's FamousÂ® All-American for merely 1.25$ along with either a deep-fried TwinkieÂ® or OreosÂ® (an order is just three cookies) for 99Â¢.  There is no better deal under the canopy. (Spoilers: The cocktail shrimp for 99Â¢ es no mÃ¡s.) 

They also offer frozen White CastleÂ® burgers (I don't recommend) for 3.95$; other hot dogs (I don't recommend) for 3.25$-3.95$; chicken fingers (I don't recommend) for 3.95$; deep fried SmuckersÂ® (definitely do not recommend) for 2.25$ ; chocolate banana (don't recommend) for 99Â¢; and, a bunch of other shit like Red BaronÂ® pizza for 4.99$ that they will undoubtedly take their sweet, sweet time on getting prepared because they don't particularly enjoy serving freedom-hating commies.",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,1,1,3,mvvmPreBZsJ1XL5UGmeeSg

Online searching let us know that Nathan's was one such place that carried deep fried twinkies as well as deep fried bananas! We headed over and got in a rather busy line but it moved pretty quickly. We ordered and a somewhat friendly set cooks and servers behind the counters took care of us. At one point, when I requested the deep fried banana, I was asked if I wanted a ""male or female banana"". This led to some confusion and I stood there unsure what to say. The guy asked pointd to my partner and said ""what does he have that you don't?"" I literally had no clue what to say that wouldn't come off really vulgar at the time, until the guy behind the counter laughed and said ""do you want nuts on the banana?"" and I burst out laughing! They were definitely a bunch that had fun with their jobs.

Our deep fried snack came to about $2.50 for both items. The twinkie came out hot and covered in icing sugar, while the banana was frozen with a layer of deep fried batter topped with nuts (we went with the ""male"" banana option). Both were extremely eye-crossingly sweet, but delicious. We couldn't finish what we had, since they were pretty hefty portions but since they were cheap, we didn't feel too bad with what was left over.",kk2oFTBSU9C2XshIVU7tXQ,0,1,3,q7Xm7NIRRXTTxctPIah4Bg
