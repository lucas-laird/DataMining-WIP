I normally don't bother the server but for 25$ I felt I should. The next sirloin was medium and an awful cut of meat.  The bartender also had quite and attitude.

If it wasn't for this restaurant we would of had to walk just to get food. We ate here a lot and it was well worth it, specially because the food in the strip is pretty pricey. It's small but the hostess and waiters do a great job during rush hour. I was very pleased with the food and customer service! If you stay in the holiday inn, this place is a must! (We just ate here so I'm judging it based on the food and not the drinks). I am attaching a picture of the breakfast pizza and the pepperoni pizza which actually weren't that good.

It is the local on site restaurant for the Holiday Inn. This place is pretty expensive for what you are getting.

The only thing I liked was the short happy hour they offered with half off well drinks. Otherwise you are spending $8 a drink here AT the hotel!",2zM4VbsZvW9cCGYHppNmvA,0,0,2,jyk9m_H_gJzkToE7W3vAHw

I had the bacon avocado burger and it was decent - appropriate quality for a Holiday Inn restaurant in Las Vegas. I would come back again (mainly for convenience).,ZqZsDux60n5FozoX0a5Kyw,1,0,3,yyHjy8zUwkCPlvR6QJnyrg

The crew is so nice, my baby got VIP treatment every day :-)
The French toast was my personal favorite, but all other choices by family members were quite good too. family had some diner and were very positive about it. 

The coffees are great! Especially the Caramel Frappuccino.. made fresh and my goodness, it was better than in some of the usual places you would go to for coffee.
take whipped creme, it's just divine!

For a resort restaurant it's definitely one of the best so far!
For a good and value for money meal this is a good place to go to.",VXvh2mXlHNL4Srw2tO-jMA,0,0,4,9ZCcqUJThX75x67aIB2pqg

The reason for one star is the server forgot to put in my order so I waited 45 minutes and then I said something.  The server apologized and brought the completely wrong food fifteen minutes later.  She took it back and brought me my something similar to what I ordered fifteen minutes later.  I just didn't say anything this time and ate it.  I didn't have time to screw around anymore.

The food was average, nothing to write home about.  I am not sure how this place functions; there seemed to be no order of who was serving which table.  The table next to me had three different servers try to take their order.

Get up 15 minutes earlier and take a cab somewhere else.  It will be worth your money.",6GQOSwqwqsjsX15tmEz3wA,0,0,1,I0gLgQ5-Cx90WjXpTGpAkg
