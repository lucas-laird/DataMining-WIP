30968,2012-01-08,0,nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA,"Chow King, like Jollibee, is another Filipino fast food chain that has made it's way to Maryland Pkwy all the way from the Philippines itself!

They have a mango shake, ube shake, calamansi tea & other asian inspired drinks.
They have other filipino dishes like palabok, bangus and garlic rice, longaniza and garlic rice, and more.

Sounds like a great idea, but the food just isn't that great. If you're hungry, you'll eat it, but you won't enjoy it as much than if you went somewhere else like D.J. Bibikahan or Pinoy Pinay.

The seating area is clean. There is a TV set to the TFC channel.

The food:
Garlic chicken and pancit (noodles) side seemed like they were made yesterday - dry and nasty.  The halo-halo (sweet ice dessert with gelatin and other various mix-ins)  was awful too.  The only thing I got that was any good were the Buchi (sesame balls) but they were way overpriced, and a mango shake that was pretty good.

The service:
I think the woman that rang me up was a manager and she was so rude right off the bat I should have left but I was hoping to bring back some good memories with tasty grub. DEFINITELY should have believed the previous two posts.

1096718,2015-12-06,0,nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA,"I'm writing this review for the sole purpose of calling out bad customer service my family experienced this morning. We were visiting LV from Texas and was excited to finally try Chowking after years of missing it. We were there between the hours of 8-9 am. Two of our orders came with coffee but I had to come back to ask for the cup myself (no big deal) after we gave our orders. Not thinking that my sister also has coffee, I only asked for one. My sister drank water with her meal and opted to ask for the coffee (which she bought) after she finished her meal. She proceeded to fill her styro cup she used with water with coffee and the same girl who took her order called her out upon seeing her and said that she had to pay for it. My sister stopped, embarrassed nonetheless and returned to the table, thinking I didn't pay for her coffee. My other sister had to come to her defense, and tried to clarify with the staff that we had indeed, paid for coffee. In return, this girl pointed at me instead, and told my sister that I only asked for one cup when she asked me, not two. She ended up giving us coffee cups but my sister was too embarrassed to even bother at that point.  Here's our issues:
1. The cups should be handed out immediately after our order is taken to avoid any confusion, just like McDonalds. At McD, the cashier looks down at the receipt as soon as its printed to see how many and what cups she needs to hand out. At Chowking, the girl asked us, not even appearing to bother to check herself what we ordered so she can give us the correct cups from the get go.
2. Second, she could have just simply smiled and handed out another cup, without trying to blame the customer. My goodness. It's coffee from a common pot. Not some custom gourmet coffee or like a big ticket item like a combo meal my sister was trying to get. Was it really worth it to embarrass a customer (who actually paid for her coffee) for a measly cup of coffee?
3. Know what the customer orders as well. In our case, we are a big group, with 2 small kids, so sometimes, things can only be repeated once and a lot can be missed with all the confusion. 

I had already noticed that this certain cashier had some kind of attitude, when, after the guy who ordered before me told her that the coffee pot is empty, she told him ""saglit lang"", seemingly agitated that she was interrupted. There's a dozen different better ways to say that. 

I really hope the management takes action and corrects this so as to prevent any similar circumstances from happening. Like I said, i'm writing a review only to call out bad behavior in the hopes of having it corrected and discussed with the person involved.

They are part of Jollibee since 2011. Some of the Filipino dishes that were sold at both places have been dropped or packaged differently.  So no more pancit palabok. The one they served here wasn't much better anyway.  It used to be the  focus was on chicken, sold by pieces or family size, and  bucket like their new parent company's do. .It has been dropped. The whole new menu offers only meal combos, hardly any ala carte items.
 
Chicken batter formula change.  Bye bye old school batter and deep fried garlicky chicken.  It's still a crispy skin but it's a different texture. I thought I ordered Garlic Chicken but I ended up with Honey Soy Garlic chicken. Cashier got my order right, the back end totally fubar'd it! So instead of waiting another 20 minutes Mr. B gave me his ""Crunchy Chicken"" order which turned out to be Soy Garlic and I gave him my Garlic Chicken combo.  While I like the flavors of the soy ginger sauce that came with it, the chicken itself was dry and bland tasting. I didn't care for the rice paper texture of the skin either.

I did not enjoy my meal at all. It didn't help I was already peeved that they got my order wrong in the first place. They always seem to do that.  So after two bites my meal went straight to the garbage can.  No loss though, not a fan of much fast food places in the first place and why it had been over a year since I was here last.

FILIPINO MUNCHIES
Although it doesn't taste like you've slipped into a Filipino family's kitchen and dined in secret on their creations, our desserts were still satisfying especially with the hot sun melting us outside. There was a slight chemical aftertaste in our selections--a small reminder this restaurant was in the business of making mass-produced, similar goodies in other locations. My Taho and our hot items didn't look very appealing in its disposable container--it looked like a rushed job of grabbing to-go containers from a birthday party.

These guys specialize in big portion combo meals that consists of noodles, meat, rice, dumplings and chips. It's a full meal for fast food price. Then a few decades back, they hit a home run on their Halo-halo special.   

Growing up, the desert was a summer time favorite. Finishing off a meal with that baby is a definite winner in my book. This restaurant serves the halo-halo version in the Philippines is laid out nice and fancy in a big glass bowl. Here in the states it's served in a big tall plastic cup. But I'm not complaining. It's still good as heck.   

They even sell the Taho, which is another childhood favorite in the Philippines. Ask any filipino who grew up there, they'll tell you without a hint of hesitation that those two are the king of sweet yummy snacks. The thing about taho is that it's usually served hot, so it's perfect for the colder season. Hot simple syrup, soft tofu and tapioca beads,,, yes its that simple for this comfort food to be as destructive as it is.   

The place is clean, there's tables everywhere for you to place your food to eat. There's chairs for you to sit in and there's a soda fountain machine in the corner. No its not a fancy joint for you to eat in, but it's clean and there's plenty of space.

I had one of the Lariat combo meals, which came with steamed rice, fried chicken w/ a cup of brown gravy sauce, a couple tiny lumpia, and some pancit.  I also ordered a side of Shumai, which were pretty good.

Chow King has some of the basic Filipino food with an American twist to it (from my perception anyway). Definitely not authentic because when you do go to a turo turo (point point) restaurant, you choose what you see that is already cooked in pans right in front of you. Here, you have to refer to pictures.

Don't get me wrong. All the choices they have here are decent. Just don't expect what a home cooked meal would be like if you actually were in the Philippines. Not close at all. With that said, what you can get here is at a pretty good price for the portions you can order. From their chicken and fish dishes, to their breakfast items (which is served all day), to their snacks (steamed pork buns, etc), are all satisfactory to my taste buds.

What I look forward to after eating an ok meal here are the desserts, which I think are a step up from other items. Their Halo-Halo (mix mix) is served in a what is large plastic container designed for drinks. You have to pretty much mix all the ingredients together to get the full flavor hence the name. I also get their Taho, which is silken tofu that sits on top of large tapioca or boba pearls encompassed with a dark sweet syrupy type liquid.

For those not familiar with Filipino cuisine, this place is not a bad place to start experiencing what your palette might like or not like. You can also jump across to Jollibee and try some of the items they don't have at Chow King. 

Some random info. They are open 7 am to midnight everyday. Bathrooms are located more towards the supermarket on the left side. They take cards.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,4,5,3,cMz-lmfsalbMwXoL7f8aaQ

Anyway, I do enjoy their fried chicken thighs. I hate drumsticks all the time, doesn't matter who makes. Pancit was very disappointing. They always have too much of something - sometimes it has way too much garlic, or way too much of what I'd like to think is oyster sauce or fish sauce. It's unpleasantly overpowering of a single ingredient everytime I eat it. Their lumpia shanghai is $2.50 for 8 bite sized pieces, equivalent to two or three (already small) normal lumpia shanghai. It is tasty but it is oversalted. I think it might be the premade frozen chicken lumpias.  It just has to be.

I'm glad that Filipino foods are on the ""main stream"" now. Las Vegas definitely is not the place for it, despite many small Filipino restaurants popping out around the Chinatown here. This Seafood City mall was crowded with Filipino and Asian customers, and it was far away from Chinatown.

This was my first ever. And I was not impressed. Well, I was not impressed by looking at the menu. It looked too cheap of a Chinese foods, with Filipino names attached. I didn't bother to pay $$ to find out. Was that my lost? So I was not gonna say much about that.

I did order the noodle trays, Bihon Guisado and Palabok, to go. A gamble. After all, this is Las Vegas. I thought I could get a good bargain.

Before I said more, I'd like to make a remark about the party trays. There were only 5 items available for $9.99 in this store. Other chains have more selections, with higher prices. And there were plenty heart attack choices... cheers to ""invincible"" obese Americans with no health insurance.

OK. Back to the store. It posted that the party trays could feed up to 6. That's a bargain for $9.99, right!? When I placed the orders, the clerk warned me that it might only feed up to 5. OK! $9.99 for 5. Still not bad.

But I had my doubt when I saw the containers.

What's next? Oh, I had to eat it first. The noodles and sauces were laid out nicely. The bihon guisado (with clear noodles, unless I've got something mixed up here) was very salty. Flavor was plain and boring. It's definitely an American dish. It tasted better when I added some boiled vegetables to dilute the salt and gave it a firm and crunchy texture.

The palabok was consisted of soft white rice noodles as the base. The sauce soaked and melted them so easily that I was kind of drinking and slurping the noodles down. I could not really taste the foods after everything blended so awfully together.

Before I finish, I'd like to point out that each food tray could easily fit into a take out Asian Styrofoam soup container. I could chow it down easily, especially the Palabok, in one meal.  And I don't eat a lot. Hehehehe...  (For reference, I could not finish a regular Lo Mein or Singaporean Fried Rice in one meal, and they are $7.99 or less usually, and they taste like foods)

So diners, it's American foods to me for these 2 Filipino dishes. Consider this is fast food in America, you may enjoy a heart attack. Is this a bargain? NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

The whole place is fairly small, and located inside the Seafood City supermarket. Nonetheless, there are a fair number of tables for dining in, or get the food to-go.

The common denominator?  Lots and lots of white rice on the menu!  Unfornately for me it's Jasmine rice, and I much prefer what many Hawaii people love, Calrose.  Can't make no solid musubi with Jasmine!

Chow King does breakfast, and also have their lunch & dinner menu daily.  Breakfast is eerily similar to that of Jollibee's.  They have the staple garlic fried rice, with an egg, and your choice of longanisa (gots to love that longanisa burp), beef tapa, or the King's special which is a combination of the two.  There's also congee for breakfast on the menu.  Classic, thick rice porridge.  Try the King's congee...it adds beef, meatballs, tripe, and a century egg (a very aged egg) on top!  Breakfast of champions!  Put some hair on that damn chest of yours!  Unless you're a lady.  Not sure if you need that.

For lunch and dinner, Chow King offers these lauriat meals.  They consist of rice, and noodles, with your choice of sweet sour pork, orange chicken, breaded fish, Shanghai egg rolls, or chicken.  They also have rice meals which basically have rice with a choice of main dishes like, fish, Oriental beef, orange chicken, honey garlic chicken, Chinese-style fried chicken, or a boneless bangus fish.  There's also fried rice on the menu, some have chorizo, one has beef, one has pork.  For side and snacks, Chow King has pancit, siopao, siomai, lumpia, and something called chicharap which is not unlike a fried shrimp chip.  See the mix here?  Some Chinese, some Filipino...all Chow King.  Eclectic, eh?

Food's not bad.  It is a bit sauce heavy, and can be a bit salty for a lot of folks.  So drink your water, people!  Sorry, nightmare of Tony Horton screaming at me from P90X just flashed by.  It's definitely fast food, so don't go thinking you're getting an authentic Asian-inspired meal here.  It suits the American palette quite nicely.  For me, this will do in a pinch.

Before I forget, Chow King does serve dessert as well.  They got ube shakes, bubble teas, but their big seller is of course....Halo-Halo.  It's like the Filipino national dessert!  Their's is almost exactly like the one at Jollibee, topped with vanilla and ube ice cream.  And again, I wish there was more fruit, more shaved ice, and less sugar.  And I wish the price was cheaper too!  $5 is a lot to spend on one of these puppies.

So whether you call if Chow King or Cho King, this place is a welcome haven for well-traveled Filipinos.  Do like me if you go to Seafood City here, get a spaghetti & Chickenjoy plate from Jollibee, walk 10 steps, and get some siomai and siopao from Chow King.  Anyone try to dip a Chow King siopao in Jollibee gravy?  So heavenly sinful!  Try it, you might like it.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,3,y7vb-sj8w7AM0mamvV-heg

4260466,2010-06-27,1,nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA,"I've only had one thing here- the halo-halo (Filipino dessert featuring a myriad of mixed ingredients- describe soon), but it is the mother of all halo-halo's! While working at Weststar, a co-worker made a run to Chow King in he Seafood City store for lunch and told me that the halo-halo was really good. She got me the large one, for a little over $5- looks like a big gulp cup at 7-11. I didn't know it would be that big. Yup, I skipped dinner that night. It's big enough to share. It comes with a boba straw (wider than drink straws) and a long spoon. There is a small size available too.  

I am picky about my Filipino food, but I do love many of the desserts. This is one of my favorites. Imagine many layers of toppings like corn, makapuno (young coconut strings), several kinds of beans, coconut gel squares (sweet), langka (sticky jackfruit- no other english translation), lime jello, interspersed with shaved ice and topped with a scoop of ube (purple yam) ice cream. I know that this combination might sound weird to a non-Filipino, but trust me, it really works. The beans and corn really balance out all the sweet stuff. You use the straw initially to drink the sweet purple-pink juice and once you get the cover off, you can mix it up as you eat it, using the spoon. I hope that this review helps and will foster your curiosity to have one. 

After shopping today at Pier 1 Imports, my husband (who was at Best Buy) surprised me with the large one. Isn't he sweet? He knew that I'd been jonesing for one, since summer started. Hence, inspired me to write this review.  

This place is always so busy. The parking lot is always full. Yes, this whole store is so popular with my peeps, so much that my mother-in-law always mentions how the parking (shared with) Jason's Deli's customers is near-impossible to find. Very convenient to shopping- Best Buy, Pier 1, Hallmark, Barnes & Noble, among others in this strip mall. Across the street is Target & Walgreen's. Next strip mall over is TJ Maxx, in the other direction is Marshall's and  the Boulevard Mall.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,5,0BSPiV5fj2465Fro1dkZhw

Placing the order was a little difficult as I placed it over the phone. I asked for 50 pieces and the worker had to repeat it back to me 3 times. I confirmed yes I would like fifty pieces of chicken.

Lunch time at Seafood City on Maryland Pkwy and the place is packed with Pinoys.  Seafood City has the grocery section in the back, but when you first enter, there is a Filipino food court to greet you, with Jollibee and Red Ribbon Bakery on the right and Chow King on the left; all three offer halo-halo, but we were here for Chow King's version.  CK offers two sizes, the Classic for $4.25 and 710 calories vs. the King size at $7.25 and a whopping 1,360 calories--I hope that's for two people to share.  Not that you should really be too concerned about calories when you have halo-halo, but when you're eating as much as we have, the numbers pop out ;)

Mel and I each had a classic size:

Present:  azuki (red) beans, white beans, kaong, nata de coco, two scoops of ube ice cream, and macapuno.  For the first time in 7 tries, this halo-halo also had saba, AKA, banana.  There was one little piece of leche flan, too- more, please.

Missing:  ube, langka, and pinipig.  Also, the shave ice was not very shaved.  In fact, it was quite chunky and we each had a huge piece of ice in our cups.  

Overall, this was the least expensive version so far.  7 down, 3 to go!
*Tip:  halo-halo is pronounced like the ha sound in ""ha ha--funny funny, "" not ""hay is for horses.""  Just in case you want to go try it and impress the Pilipinos behind the counter.

The people are nice & respectful. And I always get the tocino with bangus, egg, and rice. Their prices increased and their portions are a lot smaller than before. Seriously, Chow King? You're going to raise prices AND decrease the portions? Yeah, I'm done with you. We are definitely breaking up. You only get two stars because the staff is friendly, but your food portions and trying to rip people off? Yeah, you lost six customers.",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,1,1,2,UmTuAJucVftg9VecRPZnyw

My sister and I made the quick drive from UNLV over here and I wasn't sure what to expect. Maybe I'm not used to fast food Filipino food, but I thought it was curious to serve spaghetti and marinara with a fried drum stick, along with lumpia and wontons. Anyway, I orderd the palabok and a classic sized halo-halo. It came out to a little over $8.

The palabok had... tofu in it. I wasn't aware that was in that dish, if I was, I wouldn't have ordered it. It had two mini shrimp. It was tasteless and was unsatisfying. I had to wait until my meal was finished to get my halo-halo because their machine was down. The ice was really hard and crunchy. The texture was like rough crushed ice, rather than the texture of a snow cone or shaved ice. It didn't hold the milky mixture well and was a boon to eat. Fiesta Filipina definitely makes a better halo-halo. 

I was left feeling, ""eh, bleh"" about my meal. I wish I would have ordered something with more substantial protein.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,0,2,DYWy15_nVrxecYB08wjtPg

5851056,2007-06-25,1,nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA,"Located in the Seafood City building right across the hall from Jollibee,  Chow King is an alternative take on Filipino fast food.  It's more Filipino/Chinese where Jollibee is Filipino/American
I have yet to try their Fried Chicken, so a direct comparison against Jollibee is not possible, but that is something that I'll be saving for a future update.

What I've tried so far though has not been impressive.  Their Siopao was dry and chewy and the Shumai were rubbery.  The Beef chow mein plate was not something to write home about either with how soggy and bland it was.

A lot of friends who have tried other Chow King locations have said that the food should be pretty good.  Maybe they were having an off day?  For now they get two stars based on my first visit, but I am reserving my final judgement pending a second try.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,2,0,2,AyqysFF33LOmxYgDBDuJFw
5878944,2012-02-09,2,nTc-Qj_-ABZrpM9YSpJ6jA,"Sorry Chow King but you deserve the worst rating of all. 

Since it had been many years since I had last eaten out Chow King, I figured I might as well give them a try since the last time was in the Philippines. I ordered the sesame balls with red bean, some taho, and salt and pepper pork which looked awesome in the photo. After a brief wait, I could not wait to dig into my meal expecting some solid fried salt and pepper pork, tasty taho and warm sesame balls. Needless to say I was wrong on all levels. 

The salt and pepper pork was an utter disappointment. It tasted like it was fried and then reheated to luke warm temp. Kind of like when you have fried chicken that has been sitting in your fridge over night and its just soggy when you take it out the next day sort of way. Strike one. Next up was the taho (please excuse my spelling) which was very watery at best and just was not right. Strike two. And finally, the sesame balls. Something that is usually a standby even at dodgy chinese buffets. They were very small, just bite size and the red bean did not taste right either. Strike three. 

Maybe I came on an off night or maybe they recently changed up the receipts for making everything  I ordered. Regardless, I highly doubt I am coming back anytime soon if all the rest of the food starts to taste like this.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,1,0,1,lVp9nnZIbTBMBRC06icV8Q

I recently bought some mini lumpia's from here and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be full of mostly veggies (since they were so cheap) but I could taste the porkiness. I also ordered some shumai and thought they were A-OK.

I remember having this conversation with a Vietnamese girl studying in the US, & a Mexican guy (yes, Mexican, not American) - we all agreed that no matter what, food back home tastes much better, even when the exact same ingredients are used in the recipe. The Mexican guy added that in the US, the Mexican food he eats always tastes like they used beef from a cow they killed like 3 yrs. ago. He said that the difference in taste doesn't do their food any justice.

For homesick Filipino kabayans, this is as good as it gets. I thought the food here was a bit pricey, but this is why my friends keep telling me to stop mentally converting Philippine Pesos to US dollars & vice versa - because I will never get around to buying anything that way. 3 stars is fair - expect good food, but don't get too excited or expect your taste buds to bring you right back home with their food.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,0,0,3,bc47XHyMPsrlwY1315EQNA
