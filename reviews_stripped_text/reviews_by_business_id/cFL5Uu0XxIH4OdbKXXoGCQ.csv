They  have a kitchen where you can order from breakfast, to lunch and even dinner, but you can't eat there, they sell beer, regular groceries and the best part, they have a meat department, good prices and vast quality!
I've been going there for like 2 months now, very convenient,  I really like the people there, they are helpful and friendly.",GD4ks8U2IrNyE9N8888R5A,3,4,4,l1sjV5OX5tUD7bZ3B0rZHQ

They marinate their meats onsite in case you only have time when you get home to toss the meat in a skillet to quickly prepare lunch or dinner.  They offer deli cheeses and their produce is so fresh - all the food I observed was absolutely appetizing - I probably shouldn't have visited on an empty stomach; but, I am glad I did because I was able to taste their delicious bean and cheese pupusas as well as their tasty beef tacos.  Impressive!  To drink, I had Hubert's Watermelon Lemonade.

The owners, Raul and his wife, are looking to expand with seating for the restaurant; however, today we improvised and simply sat at the slot machines and enjoyed the delicious food prepared by Betty.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they offer specials on the freshly prepared food, so be sure to partake.

I had a wonderful experience.  Check this place out so you can have a wonderful experience too!",amvZ9tmLWraWoML6K4Xiuw,2,0,5,er39MNlmLHioyU70We9zyA

3519617,2011-08-23,0,cFL5Uu0XxIH4OdbKXXoGCQ,"I've driven by this little Mexican market a million times and finally decided to give it a try. It looks small from the outside and feels even smaller inside. They packed everything in pretty tight. I came here to buy some pre-seasoned carne asada for some homemade tacos. The quality of the stuff I got looked better than similar meat at Los Compadres, although the flavor/seasoning/marinade of the meat from Los Compadres was probably bolder. The meat at El Gordito was also pricier at about $6.20 a pound, I think, compared to $5.99 at LC. 

Also got some pinto beans, which were tasty. Other items purchased (cilantro, jalape√±os, and avocados) were fairly priced and in good condition. I'd come here again.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,4,4,mUmo2m6ioaSjLe5XpOSq0A

The hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open. The food gets dried, they still serve it that way! Dried food + flys = NASTY! I Bought a Torta and when I tried it, the meat was ROTTEN. Tasted Disgusting! Also, You can see Flys in the glass display, where the Bread is in!

They also have these small homemade flour tortillas they sell which are absolutely delicious and I am not a fan of tortillas to begin with.

There's just about every Mexican grocery item that you can think of, plus when we arrived the restaurant part was closed. They quickly told us that they could make us something that we wanted, and made us a really good carne asada burrito and two tacos. We chose to take it back to our hotel, as there is no real place to eat inside. There is a table but no ambiance to stay. They made us feel like family and went way above to feed us, when it was almost 9:30 pm and the restaurant choices at 8.",latw3T1oG02OidF3tXSzAA,1,1,5,eACmJPFTL3y-l4kSkcKrcg
