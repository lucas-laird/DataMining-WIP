Not two minutes later, this elderly lady comes out and asks if I needed something with her car. I simply said that I was standing there for the shade. She then accused me of tampering with the hood of her car. I once again politely say that I was simply standing there for the shade, by this point I've already moved from that area. She goes back inside the McDonald's. 

A minute later, the manager comes out saying that the lady is a friend of the owner and thinks we're messing with her car. Once again I say that I was simply standing there for the shade. He then takes on a haughty taughty tone and says, ""Well she's a regular and friends with the owner, sorry. I hope you guys have a nice day.""

At this point we leave feeling like we were singled out by this stupid woman and just because she's friends with the owner that they could single us out for something we did not and we're not doing.

2215.  About quarter-after-ten of the p.m.  Running a bit late on my way to work, so stop by the McDingle's closest to the Nest to put a snack in my mouth to accompany the pharmaceuticals that say ""take with food.""  I pull into the drive-thru line, and about fifteen seconds later, I hear a burst of static.  About five seconds after that, I hear, ""Hello?""  Now, I'm thinking, *I did NOT just hear that.*  I know they hire youngsters here, and they have to train even the slightest shred of professionalism into them, but this reaches an all-time low.

That mental conversation took about five seconds, after which I heard ""Hello, are you ready to order?""  Again, no ""thank you for choosing McDonalds"" or anything like that.  I said, ""No thank you, not today,"" and drove off, rolling my window up.

As I said,  this is the outlet closest to my home, and I've been in there many times in the year-and-a-half I've been in my home.  Never anything to write home about in either direction ... nothing outstandingly good, or outstandingly bad.  This, however, is the proverbial last straw.  I guess I will start packing a brown-bag every day before I go to sleep to make sure I have that small amount of food that my pills require.  It will probably be cheaper and healthier in the long run anyway.  As my grandson might say, ""Good-bye, McFail.""

1939065,2014-11-05,3,kaFItSnFuTSpmohv2jDbrQ,"This is not a great McDonalds. Thats saying something.

To be honest, when I go to McDonald's I am really going for one reason: sweet and sour sauce. Its tangy, its sweet, it clearly has heroin in it because when I don't eat it for a few days I start feeling like bugs are crawling under my skin. Everything I get there is just a delivery vehicle to get the SSS (sweet and sour sauce) into my mouth since apparently you high society types frown upon me using a spoon or straw. This means generally I am getting a lot of of chicken nuggets or fries, though I'm not above putting some SSS on a mcflurry...

The major problem I have with this place is that despite me saying I will pay extra for SSS and them charging me for extra sauce packets they basically never give me the desired number of sauces. I get you don't want to give away huge numbers of sauces anymore cause neoliberalism but... come on give up that sweet golden brown goodness. 

Chicken nuggets at this place have been pretty consistently bad- not super hot, not super crispy, all around meh. 

Lastly, this McDs is slooooooooooooow. The drive through line is frequently quite long and slow moving which is terrible for a fast food restaurant.
