The burritos are awesome and huge, tacos come fried or soft shell, and then the Super Nachos.... I think these  break the maximum calorie barrier, but they are good.

Staff here is nice. They are quick, good cooks, and the cashiers will joke around with you on occasion.

When we entered I was really indecisive of what I wanted since I am a foodie, I wanted everything. The worker informed us whenever we are ready to order.

While we were waiting a lot of drunk men came in and sitting on things they were not to sit on like AC vent, table and being really obnoxious. The worker was really chill about it and informed them to please stop doing that and they obliged. I get distracted easily so we let them go first since I was still having a hard time deciding what I wanted.

I narrowed it down to something cheesy and with a lot of sauce and my boyfriend suggested I get the wet burrito and add chicken. We were ready to order and the worker was being so rude to my boyfriend, literally screaming at him through the microphone which hurt my ears. The worker informed us that they cannot add chicken to my burrito because they have a ""no substitution"" policy...which was bogus because we are not substituting anything just adding. 

So I wanted more time to rethink what I wanted but the worker was just staring at me impatiently so I ordered the Chile Rellano plate. The worker was still being rude. We decided to get a Pi√±a drink and it tasted like stale cardboard...not real pineapples at all. We are waiting for our food and other people come in and the worker is talking to them normally over the microphone -_-

Always crispy and hot; I make sure to order with no beans inside, that's just my preference and I have noticed that the innards of the chimi seem to be less watery, which is perfecto!

I prefer to get it to go... the location is a little icky... booths aren't cleaned as often as they should be. Thats why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5. 
But the food is really good.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,0,0,4,zKzvFSRalPpeDJViJYHUnw

I would say with 99 cent chicken tacos, you can't go wrong, but with this place, it can be hit and miss. The shells can be super oily and can quite literally soak through the wrapping and even the bag before I get home, which is 3 minutes down the road. Two tacos does just fine for me. The other dish I like is the #8, the machaca (shredded beef with egg.) nom nom!",S-z0epok_cwBx5AQx9ouQQ,0,0,3,yCUpcA6M2L0PYbZqvfXUTw
