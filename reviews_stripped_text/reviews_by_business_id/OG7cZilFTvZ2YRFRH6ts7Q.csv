Thanks to Alternative Junkie, I can finally answer that with: ""Who f@*&ing cares?!""  These guys have perfected the all-natural, healthy, and delicious vegan dishes that even a carnivore such as myself can salivate over.  If you haven't given them a try yet, I suggest you do your mouth, your body, your health* and the world a favor and indulge yourself in any (or all!) of their delicious creations!  


*Alternative Junkie is recommended by 4 out of 5 doctors as a healthier alternative to your current crappy diet.  The 5th doctor could not recommend it because he lost his writing hand to diabetes before he had the chance to switch to an Alt J meal plan.**

My personal favorites are the quesadilla or the black bean burger! Not to mention how simple it is to order and pick up, including two locations in the valley! I 100% recommend Alternative Junkie for anyone that would like great tasting food at a reasonable price!",2XTAiJpjMqOoVm_kc2TTjw,0,0,5,Pr-IIUhW8onY3c2bTg6eIw
5096315,2016-06-09,1,OG7cZilFTvZ2YRFRH6ts7Q,Love the food from Alternative Junkie! I have been a customer there for a few months now and love the options of the weekly meals... not to mention these vegan meals are NOT bland! It's nice to kick it up a notch with some spice and flavor :) Heidi is also very personable and I have been super happy with every meal I've ordered. It's great to find some great meals to take to work for lunch... not to mention these meals have generous portion sizes particularly for the price ($11). My favorite hands down are the Buffalo Cauliflower Tacos!!,hXOHumtKuh0180dT6VV_oQ,1,2,5,f8-Zlr0H4etz5KWue3OYsA
