The meat balls are so tender and covered in a delicious sauce, and the bread is very firm, and the perfect size to fit right in your hand.

I have also tried the Chef's coq au vin, which is some of the best I have ever had.

My only issue with this place was the drink selection. There was only Kirkland Signature water. I would have preferred something a bit more up market, like a Vos.",KGPk1o65rZouLYSw3xTrCQ,2,1,4,8Ga0vjSXljvBXvfFvvP8aQ

Bizarre location 
Invite only exclusivity 
Craft beer 
Eccentric chef 
Surprise menu 

It's a little unnerving that Chef Jared insists on spoon feeding you, but the quality of the food makes it worthwhile. The other kitchen staff can best be described as salty. Remember to clean up your dishes or you'll find out just how salty they can be. 

If you can get an invite, do not pass up the opportunity to dine here.",KV8YcH0JBaynbC1M-RM4PQ,0,0,4,-a9jo5EmJilkibR9VNYRDg

Typically there is only one option to choose from so you are at the mercy of the chef, but the food is superb.  Highly recommend!",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,2,1,5,YrLUvbdqKMmKHHuWij4lqg
