The egg flower soup was the main reason why I ate here, which was good, but the other food items were mysterious. The fried rice was cold, the shrimp tempura was soggy, and the sweet and sour pork made Mr. Chau's look good. The prices and service was mediocre at best. I made a big mistake by eating at this place at the Fashion Show Food Court. Please don't do the same...",-hDRLqC8VqceLEXQbvrAIA,0,0,2,59YBczrmJSUREx_xvUg5Xw

I tried two different meats told her my choice but she only filled my place with rice and a side. When I tried to call, the phone wasn't working so I had to drive all the way back to the mall to tell her. When I got there she was very defensive and acted like I told her no meat. Very rude. Never again.",p39m8LjVb32qVoJMBvfxAA,0,0,1,tCPts9aaJIKvPb1Jt8paww

When I was walking through the mall in the food court, I wasn't planning on a Chinese feast, but the dude working there tempted me with free samples. I sampled the orange chicken and it blew me away. It was so fresh and soft and delicious. I changed my plans immediately and ordered a big plate of it. It was good. Also, the chow mein was mighty fine too. 

They also served Coke, which is a plus, none of this Pepsi nonsense.",y3OmMymE57BiHa03yjaxCQ,1,0,4,l1NvPVfnCDoQuWdwqONrdA
