I tipped her well. I received my bubble waffle with the chocolate chips scattered on top instead of inside. I thought she misunderstood what I meant, but while I was eating it, she came over and told me that she forgot to add the chocolate chips inside the bubbles when she was making it so she just put it on top. ""Hope that's okay."" No.... that's not okay. If you misunderstood, that's one thing. I can forgive that. But, if you made a mistake, you should've corrected it. Throwing chocolate chips on top is NOT the equivalent of melting them inside. It's like putting chocolate chips on top of a plain cookie when someone asked for a chocolate chip cookie. NOT THE SAME! I would not have asked for chocolate chips if I had known she was just gonna throw them on top. She's the one who said she could do it.",YYXHhd16RZR4HqLmfz_ANA,0,0,3,6mGRHVby5rzsb725CMGFnw

And my iced matcha latte was very tasty. All natural ingredients... very earthy tasting. I don't like it very sweet and the way they made it was spot on.

The customer service was great. The lady informed us it was a soft opening and not everything was up and running yet... they were both very knowledgeable and enjoyed what they were doing.

Much like the rolled ice cream spots popping up all over town, your dessert prep includes a bit of a show so have your camera ready.

The menu offers ice cream in limited flavors (several of Asian influence, per the Chinatown-adjacent location) along with waffle cup options and milk teas. Location is large with plenty of seating and custom wood work, along with local art on display for sale in the back. Service was polite with good attention to detail and interested in feedback, always a plus. I tried the black sesame flavor and found it a bit creamier than the other nitro creams I've tried, which tend to be more icy with a different mouthfeel that some may dislike when comparing to traditional ice creams or gelatos. 

I visited during their soft opening and the available flavors were limited- it's unclear whether they'll offer more options or rotate the choices, but I'd prefer some more unique flavor options like those at Smitten. I didn't see options for additional mix-ins or toppings, which some people might want to add. The waffle cup and milk tea options were either unavailable or not offered when I visited, but I'll be back to try them both.

EDIT: As of April 2018, they no longer have nitrogen ice cream nor typically Asian flavors, skewing more American (vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream, etc) and serving up regular (though house-made) ice cream instead, with low prices.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,21,3,zRPwQpkv8ce5z86EysBpYQ

I was really happy that this place honored holiday hours as some of the places that were on our list that were way outside the Strip  closed the week before Christmas.  There are a lot of Bubble Tea places in Richmond, BC, however, as a bubble tea person I was curious to see how a place that isn't traditionally known for the bubble tea actually does bubble tea. Firstly this place is really clean and sleek in terms of design. I had the mango orange bubble tea which tasted decent and the pearls were soft, however, not too soft. It earned a pass from me considering that I have lots of bubble tea experience. They do serve nitrogen ice cream which is a huge trend right now (or at least a trend in 2017) in Vancouver, BC.

It does take a little bit for you to get your drinks since they make it right after you order, I just wish they were a little colder and if they could use the plastic seal to it instead of the lid.

Nitrogen ice cream is on the rise and this one offer different flavor. Ingredients are all natural and fresh. They use US made chocolate THCO which is based in Berkeley, CA. They also have black sesame flavor. They also have Nitrogen Teas beverages. 

We did not try the drinks this time but we ordered the chocolate with Matcha bubble waffle. I thought the waffle taste great. The batter was not too heavy and was crispy. The chocolate ice cream was not overly sweet so you can taste the real chocolate. 

RECYCLEABLE cup to help our planet, very thoughtful! Variety of drink cups, so cute. They also have split cups if you choose two different drinks. 

They currently have no lactose free or gluten free items on their menu. The owner mentioned they are developing new flavors and gluten/lactose free are next. I also wish they will have exciting exotic fruit taste like in CA such as Jackfruit, Durian, Lychee, etc. 

Ice cream start at $5 and up. Drinks are $4.50-$8. Waffle cup is $6.50.

Let me start off by saying that the girl making the ice cream, did not wear a hair net or had her hair tied.

Ice cream: The best thing about the ice cream was the consistency. It was very smooth and melted nicely; however, please be aware, the sugar content is very low.

Drink: I got the Nitro Zomba Pearl, which taste like a normal white tea, nothing special. They also have you sweeten it yourself with different sweeteners on the side (honey, brown sugar, stevia, and cane sugar). I was just disappointed it was filled 3/4 of the way with just ice.

Environment: They use white color a lot in store, and I like the way they present their work station in front of the guest. We can have something to watch while we waiting.
This place is also peace and quiet, I like to spend time here chitchat with friends.

Staffs: The employee were friendly, they gave me suggestions for drinks and desserts, super patient.

Dessert: I ordered the bubble waffle with strawberries. I love the sweetness of the strawberries combine with the sugar powder on the waffle. Crunchy and soft taste at the same time. 

Bubble tea: I ordered both Dirty Horchata and Mocha Latte. They both were nice options. Mocha latte is a must for me over here.

My friend ordered the Matcha waffle which was pretty tasty! It was crispy, light, and you could taste hints of matcha with each bite. I would recommend ordering that if you are not a heavy dessert person, but still want something yummy to munch on.

Bubble mixology offers more than just Boba and teas. Dig into their waffle treats with the variety of ice cream and toppings. 

 I ordered the Strawberry Farm (Chocolate powder, drizzle and fresh strawberries) and Sticky Cloud (housemade whipped cream, caramel drizzle and chips) both on top of a chocolate and black charcoal bubble waffle. In addition, I got a Thai tea frappe with 2 scoops of Oreo ice cream inside.

4006718,2017-09-19,2,HnsGCps7TY3vnC7u4xVEew,"I came here for both their soft opening and grand opening. I personally like Sweet Spot better because they have more flavor options and topping choices. 

Texture is one of a kind. It's extremely smooth and rich. I did notice that there are some inconsistency where one of the nitro ice cream was sticky, like a caramel and stuck to my teeth. 

Like I mentioned the flavors are limited. On grand opening day however, they had new flavors which were lavender earl grey and cinnamon ginger. I heard their flavors will be rotated weekly so I may need to be on the look out for their next rotation. 

So far I've tried most of the flavor in ice cream (chocolate, matcha, black sesame, vanilla) and matcha latte and all had bold flavors.

I'm not sure with their price point and tiny portion, it would be worth coming here as opposed to other nitro places that offers more customizable options and toppings (and much bigger portion for the same price). Looking forward for them to step up their game.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,4,3,4,2ZDOcscTl2OFa3IiYl3LZw
4108180,2018-04-07,3,HnsGCps7TY3vnC7u4xVEew,"This is no longer a liquid nitrogen ice cream vendor. Instead, it's an inexpensive yet surprisingly solid dessert shop.

Bubble Mixology is in a small plaza on Spring Mountain near Jones with such notable neighbors as KJ Kitchen and TangTangTang. I'd bookmarked them a while back for liquid nitrogen ice cream, and although I was disappointed to learn that they had stopped making that product, I was more than happy to give them a try.

I didn't get any of the drinks, although those seemed to be pretty popular. I guess that the various teas, coffees, and shakes are the inspiration behind their name, rather than the desserts which I focused on. (I might've grabbed something had I been hungrier or less fearful of caffeine at the relatively late evening hour.)

First off, check out the ice cream prices. They charge $1, $1.75, or $2.50 respectively for 1, 2, or 3 scoops. The scoop size is pretty generous and the texture was smooth and free of ice crystals. I was more than happy to be able to try three flavors, with is half of their very limited and very American assortment. Lack of choices (and Asian flavors) aside, I was happy with each of my vanilla, cookies & cream, and cookie dough.

Next, get ready to be shocked by the waffles. They're the variety which are variously known in other dessert shops as egg waffles, egglets, Hong Kong waffles, etc. The menu lists plain waffles as $2.50 and flavored waffles as $3.00, although I only paid the smaller price for some reason for my matcha waffle. It was surprisingly and pleasantly quite enjoyable. The texture stayed crispy outside and soft inside until the last bite, which took a while because I was eating the ice cream on top of the waffle. The matcha flavor was light, but that's par for the course.

Did I mention that these prices are tax-free? Offering solid entry-level ice cream and some of the better egg waffles at these prices is mind-boggling in 2018. The lowest price I can find elsewhere in town (researching via Yelp photos) for egg waffles is $4, and I'm pretty sure ice cream isn't that cheap except at a certain popular chain with 25 more flavors than you'll find here.

I can criticize them for a lot of things (awkward placement of water/utensil/napkin station, weird setup of menus, out-of-place metal table, relatively short hours), but service was okay considering that there were two people trying to cope with a huge family group of about 15 and cleanliness was on-point. I had a fairly comfortable visit.

Bubble Mixology isn't a true foodie spot or destination to get excited over, but it's a very affordable and competent dessert option should you find yourself in this neighborhood and not feeling as spendy as you'd need to be for trendy sweets.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,5,4,SE1O8-hKQ2DKMKrfQDkOdQ

This place is really hip! Everything from the minimalist decor to the nitrogen ice cream. The flavors are cool too and range from normal vanilla all the way to lavender earl gray. Which I do not recommend by the way, it was way too soapy tasting. But everything else was really delicious, especially the Nutella flavor and the bubble waffles! It's an additional $2 for a waffle and 50 cents each for toppings.
The staff was very nice, and gave my cousin a waffle for free when he went to order it after already receiving his ice cream. 
Lastly, although the nitrogen ice cream is a novel concept, it really was just ice cream. Good ice cream though!",T5rVcw2xCkYcbuWW1b8ENw,1,0,4,U3ZfBuggrrrW0-iLiBWaHQ

My friend ordered the Matcha with Almond Milk while I ordered Matcha with Whole Milk. We both enjoyed our drinks. Both Matcha goes really well with each milk. You can taste the tea flavor of the Matcha with the sweetness of the milk. You can change the sweetness percentage of your drink.  

When we ordered our drinks, they didn't have boba; but, when our other friend met up with us, they were to add boba to her drink. My friend and I ordered around 1pmish, but my other friend arrived around 1:45~2pmish. The boba availability might depend on what time you order.

What makes Bubble Mixology unique is the fact that they offer flash-chilled nitrogen ice cream that is the smoothest, creamiest, thickest, richest, and most delicious ice cream I have ever had. 

The ice creams are made-to-order and the cool thing is that they make it right in front of you. Since they use nitrogen, when the ice cream is being made is looks like a neat science experiment. They also brew nitrogen tea that tastes so fresh.

I ordered their chocolate ice cream along with the Zomba Pearl white tea both were very delicious. 

The place itself is very spacious with a variety of places to sit or stand and on the wall hangs an eye catching ""Bubble Mixology"" sign that you can't help but take a photo of. At the counter were they take and make orders it looks like a sort of science lab with beakers, flasks, and test tubes, which is a fitting concept when you see the ice cream being made. 

I'm looking forward to my next visit because I am interested in trying their Matcha affogato. Overall I definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for a different spin on ice cream and/or tea.",-0AvEZuSWLtUpasFb4fmfg,4,0,5,BSWxaaLCyp_1ZMOVK8dMxQ

The ice cream was not too overpowering with the matcha flavor, the bubble waffle was warm and inviting, and the mochi was the perfect texture and fresh. It all come together deliciously and I was extremely satisfied! It is a little bit pricey but I think it is worth it. I would definitely recommend visiting Bubble Mixology to satisfy after-dinner-sweet-cravings! The Bubble Waffles are freshly made to order and so is the ice cream!

I was again surprised to see that their ice cream came from a regular tub. I couldn't read the brands name but if I wanted that type of ice cream I would have gone to the super market to get it and paid less. I took my ice cream and left.

The place itself is aesthetically pleasing. The actual ice cream, bubble waffle, and teas are alright. It's fun to watch the ice cream being made, but I didn't like the texture that much. It's too... creamy? Like it'll melt once you walk out and are bombarded with the Vegas heat. They have limited flavors of ice cream, bubble waffles, and tea. 

The bubble waffle itself is pretty to look but not fun to eat. It was crunchy... not soft and waffle-y. I wasn't able to easily distinguish between vanilla, chocolate, or matcha bubble waffles.

I also ordered a matcha tea. It was a bit bland. I like that they make it unsweetened then you can add your own amount and type of sweetener. But they were very stingy on the ice. My drink was a. It colder than room temp and was not enjoyable. I had to drink a couple sips and then go ask for a whole bunch of ice to cool it down more.

Let's answer the most important question first: it is better than Sweetspot, the other liquid nitrogen ice cream shop in Vegas. Creamy texture, as you would expect from liquid nitrogen ice cream, but oddly enough, also quite gummy and chewy. Decently strong flavors, but nothing memorable.

Vegas is not an ice cream town, as of now. It's a steakhouse town or a celebrity chef town, but definitely not an ice cream town.
