This place still offers good food at great prices. Also they are pretty cool about take out. I ate here a lot when we stayed at Gold Spike and I've since come back for the specials. The prime rib is special is OK. It is just good enough that you won't complain given the price. They also have other specials that, even though they cost a bit more than the prime rib, I felt were much better. I've had the steak and eggs many times.

The dining room is small, but clean. The servers are pretty cool and they work their butts off. I tipped them a little extra since they were working so hard all around me I saw people tipping lousy (lady next to me tipped 50 cents for her comped meal).",DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw,3,0,4,KGm2wdqbmzZU1WLhTK7TvA

She has the personality of brick, was unresponsive to my questions and then gave me the ice bitch stare when i changed my mind about ordering takeout due to the $1 takeout charge (oh im sorry im getting it to go, but please charge me an extra buck for putting your crap into a cheap ass plastic container). As the two meth addicts chomped on their food a few stools down, i had enough of the blonde dimwit and gave her a few choice words before probably saving myself from more food poisoning.

They've converted the old casino into a bar/gameroom/lounge where you can come hang with your buds, grab some drinks and play various games. Inside, they have comfy couches, beds and bean bag chairs you can sit/lay on, as well as tables and stools in the bar area. Drinks here are pretty cheap (most shots and beers were 5 bucks) and the bartenders are quick. There's also a restaurant in the back, although we didn't try it. Although we didn't play any games, they have darts, foosball, bags/cornhole, and pool inside that you can play. The DJ played mostly hip hop and top 40 type music.

There is also an outdoor patio area that includes a stage where a live band was playing, a small bar area, and some comfy armchairs. The band was pretty good and the sound was excellent for a small set up. They also had a basketball version of beer pong (at least that's what I would compare it to) and giant jenga for you to play outside. Again, we didn't try playing, mostly because we were too busy jamming out to the music.

This may become a new place for me to hang. I love that there's so much to do and everyone around me seemed to be having a great time.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,1,5,FyDw1d8FeHlcQFok_f4kpQ
2481210,2012-02-20,1,mbjF4qlWNfmLlhQ6-VowHg,"Golden Grill will do the job.  Fill your stomach on the cheap any time of night.  Pay no attention to the psycho at the next table.

  Located inside the Gold Spike casino, one block from Fremont, you can come here after your done partying at the local bars.  I live across the street so I've been here many times, its one of the only 24 hrs food spots around downtown.

GOOD FOOD:  I guess it can be compared to a Denny's.  Everything I've tried, from the steak and eggs to the potato soup, has been pretty decent.  Nothing is great or exciting, but everything is pretty good or at worst acceptable.  My fav is probably the sirloin with 2 eggs over easy, some well done hash browns, and toast for $5.99.

BAD FOOD:  The only items I think are not good are 1) The pies.  I've tried a few and they're either old, still frozen, or just plain bland.  And 2) The drinks.  The water tastes funny.  And it shows through in the ice tea as well.  I'd stick with soda or milk.

SERVICE:  It really depends on who's working.  Also there is a sign that says ""Please wait to be seated"".  I've finally started ignoring this sign because they always seem to ignore me.  So now i just walk in and sit, and I don't stand there for ten minutes while there's only one table seated.  You will actually get service quicker that way.  Food usually comes out pretty quick though.

THE X-FACTOR:  There is a 90% chance that you will be provided with an original experience due to a character dining nearby.  Literally the first three times in a row I ate here there was a different crazy person who made a huge scene.  From nut-jobs who talk to themselves to freaks who curse loudly at the staff, the Spike attracts only the classiest patrons!  Don't worry, there is security on property.

***  I had to downgrade Golden Grill from 3 to 2 stars because while the location and hours are great, I'm realizing that most of the food is just terrible.  The only palatable thing to eat is the steak and eggs, everything else i've been trying is bretty bland - like cafeteria bland.  Even the burger and fries was pretty tough to get down.  You know it's bad when I'm not finishing burgers or fries.  I just can't stomach the idea of going here ever again if I want to enjoy the taste of my food in the slightest bit.",n-U4c31vGjJ4SE91Qa93Vw,4,1,2,Qmv9dhVKlU8VHK7hu0jAYg
2668713,2013-12-21,1,mbjF4qlWNfmLlhQ6-VowHg,"I sort of developed a little crush when I checked out the Goldspike... actually, I came twice.  I didn't get to spend a lot of time here on either visit.  

The first was in the morning to figure out ""what is this place?""  We discovered this is a cool bar and grill that looks like a really fun place to hang out with friends.  there is a Bar and there is a Grill and then there is a whole large Lounge area full of comfy couches, bed style loungers, bean bag chairs, and games games games.  it's totally what I want to find when I go to a bar to hang with friends.  Outside they also have little conversation areas, some game areas, a section where bands can play and currently, an ice skating rink (sorry, folks, synthetic ice).  it's just FUN.

We returned that night because we wanted to check it out while it was hopping and it was!  people were skating and snow was blowing through the air, a band was playing and people were drinking and having a grand time.  Inside, almost every seating area was being used and everyone looked happy.  I wanted to stay and drink and play, but I was actually quite sick and needed to hit the sheets, but I am so going back here and bringing my friends with me.

The security guard told me that they are also refurbishing the old hotel above the lounge and it's going to be some kind of hip boutique hotel.  I'm loving the new downtown and might be spending a lot more time down there if everything is going to be THIS COOL!",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,1,1,4,bnOy2JYos1pPj1UTIoONpA
3025124,2012-06-10,0,mbjF4qlWNfmLlhQ6-VowHg,"I ate there twice during a recent vacation. I'm not going back.

First time I went I had the $5.99 steak and eggs. Not bad for the price, but the steak wasn't one I really wanted to eat again. 

A couple of nights later I had the prime rib dinner, and added a simplistic salad for $1.29. The prime rib was OK, but you can get better downtown. The horseradish they gave me had too much kick. I think I was offered mild and spicy, or something like that. I didn't know there were different degrees of horseradish. I don't know if I got the ""mild,"" but that's what I asked for. Too much kick! As for the meat... OK, but you're better off dining at the California if you want a good, cheap prime rib dinner. Much better for about the same money when you add in the cost of a salad to your dinner at Golden Grill.

Late night service for steak/eggs was good. Young dude was on his game, and got a nice tip. 

The prime rib dinner service was weak. The woman was too busy bitching to her co-workers about some other co-worker. Fill my water glass when it sits there empty at the edge of the counter. Don't make me ask you to do your job. Your tip reflected the weak service. 

Better options for cheap meals elsewhere, although I'm not  under the impression you  ever have to wait to get a table at the Golden Grill. That's the only positive thing I can say about it. 

I had never been inside the Gold Spike before my last Vegas trip. I was quite surprised to see blackjack tables, as I didn't sense many people ever gamble there. I'm sure it gets action on weekends, but you have to wonder how that casino makes any money. I can't imagine the sexy dealers working weeknights are making much in tips.",9oqyAZXAXPzX4seAcldWgA,0,0,2,TAEMQAT6GrX8NzbleCZSnw

Prime Rib Special. Fucking WHACK! ummmm, I've had the mess that they call ""Prime Rib"" at Dan Marino's for $9.99, SO, basically, I know shitty meat, and what to expect. This was the WORST thing i've ever, EVER eaten in my life. 
I could not  #1)  cut my prime rib with the steak knife, #2) CHEW my prime rib , or #3) understand my prime rib! What the fuck IS this!?!

Doesn't the word ""prime' indicate a level of standard...like being consumable?
I honestly laughed at first, then wondered WTF these yelpers are giving these morons 4 stars for?

I would not feed this meat to my dog! I
And my dog loves jizz!
I did not even know that meat this horrible was available for human consumption!!!!

This was the perfect stop in between all the shenanigans of downtown. After visiting 3 bars, my buddy and I decided we were famished. This place came recommended from a bartender at the Griffin for a cheap, greasy food option.

Located in the Gold Spike Casino which is walkable from Fremont on Ogden. 

The decor was kind of odd. White floors, white tables, white plastic chairs. 

The meal itself was pretty decent but it is hard to screw up eggs, bacon toast and hash browns. The hash browns were crispy, the toast not burnt, the bacon not soggy and the eggs a perfect over medium. 

The waitress was nice but was a little slow due to her being the only one with multiple large groups of people.

4409633,2013-04-24,1,mbjF4qlWNfmLlhQ6-VowHg,"So, I realized I wrote a review of the grill before. What I didn't realize was the last time I ate there would be (the last)!

First of all the name. It's the GRILL! They didn't try to call themselves a café. And although they sometimes had a diner feel, the light green and stone décor wouldn't really capture that kind of ambience. At least they didn't go Excalibur and try Ye Olde Golden Grille. Plus the concept of those old cozy little diners have taken a turn for the worst since 'murica's biggest truckstop chain tried to make themselves ""homier"" by calling their locations that. They should have gone the ""greasy spoon"" route and taken the ironic pride in that the way hooters and heart attack grill- MAN, I have to write up that place soon. 

I was used to winding up there at the end of the night (early morning), trying to sober up for the long, long, 20 minute drive home. Considering you pass by a dozen cops in that 20, yeah it's a big deal. 

And years ago, I used to drive a motorcycle. And those aren't really a target for police, since people seem to get away with 80mph wheelies on the 215, you know you've seen it. I would have to sober up, you have to have a lot more skill driving a motorcycle home than holding a 6 position and dropping your foot on the gas. Cars don't even have stick anymore!

The last time I ate there was a big surprise for me in itself. I strolled in late morning, of my own accord! Not on the way home after a night of bar skirmishes! Hours AFTER the sunrise. It was to start a day of walking around downtown! 

Let me say, when you are drunk and starved, everything is the BEST meal you've ever tasted. You are basically crawling in from the desert at those Golden times. So the big surprise was, at my morning sober, the food was great and the employees were as friendly as I remember them being on grave, not all hagged out and bitter about life the way some non-morning people on the breakie shift can be.

I'm going to be gender specific, so let's be adult about this. I have worked with men and women in restaurants and both sides unanimously agree that when the floor are all guys/ men, the whole crew is more easy going. I have gone into a restaurant to check out the employees, saw the server floor full of women (that weren't a breastaurant). I would listen to the gossip and cattiness and the maternal ""this is the way it's going to be speak"" not only to cowokers, but also other employees, including management if ""I've been here 8 years before you."" In fact there's only one restaurant where the staff are women I felt really relaxed in. For another review, clue: bh fl. So the staff were mostly guys, the grill always had a kick back feel to it. 

I have dined in the chairs, but nothing beats bar counter service. I always find myself in the middle of someone's conversation. Everyone has gambling strategies (so why are they doing there with you at 3:00AM days before xmas instead of their villa?) People always has a big news story they butcher any facts of when you see a newspaper or story on tv later. If there's an argument it's always funny between a couple of old guys. Couples and families always sit at tables. Old guy debates are just fun for some reason, you get into it.

Sadly, my last meal there wasn't the prime rib special. I've had it several times. I used to work in a restaurant that served prime rib and I wondered what the big deal was of a request of people. It was in the golden grill I finally appreciated how good the end cut really was. There's a secret to the end cut when you can get it and for that gem, you'll have to pour a pitcher down my throat.

Great times at the grill, they didn't have advertising that manufactured it's ambiance. Bitch, please they just HAD it.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,2,1,5,CAmQhpKTzl452jTuPNRSpg

Walking into this brightly lit but small cafe, you really don't need to even look at the menu since this special isn't even on there.  Most of the waiters know what you're there for anyway, so they are used to the majority of their dinner guests coming for prime rib only.

I ordered the steak and eggs with hash browns and toast with my boyfriend and it was pretty delicious! We were the only ones in the restaurant and the chef came out to ask us how exactly we wanted our steak cooked so it felt like we had one on one personal service. The best part of the meal was the price. It was $6.48 total. Can't beat that. I kind of wish I could try their prime rib dinner that's advertised everywhere in the restaurant and casino, but it's only available at certain times. 

After we woke up from staying in the hotel we went back for the free breakfast deal that came with the room. I got the biscuits and gravy and bacon. Once again. Fantastic price!! $3.99 for the biscuits and $1.99 to add bacon.

 The only downside was after we were seated the server who apparently was supposed to serve us brought us our waters and menus, but did not bother to come back and take our order. It took another waiter's attention after what seemed like an eternity (I was really hungry) to come and ask us if we had been helped yet.

They did have this tabasco A1 sauce that was interesting though.",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,0,0,2,-CTF-A_H_xLcygOUiNpnoA

The cafe is pretty clean and modern. Much nicer than I would expect from this place. We sat down and were immediately greeted by our server for our drink order. Service was fast and friendly and I was very impressed by the place at first glance. We were about to order the Prime Rib dinner but then the Steak and eggs caught all of our eyes and we decided to go with that instead. It was about 10:40pm, this matters because the Steak and Eggs aren't available until 11. Our server told us he'd take care of us and not make us wait until 11, awesome.

The food was pretty good and it was cooked exactly to order. Our server was attentive with refills and getting us everything we needed to enjoy our meals. 

A meal for four for under $25, can't beat that. Definitely a better than expected experience here! I'll be back for sure!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,4,J75KpK5qDMYP_FhefJfRKw
