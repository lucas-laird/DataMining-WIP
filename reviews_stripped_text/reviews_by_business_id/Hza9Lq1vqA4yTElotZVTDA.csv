It's a hidden joint; but none the less serves quality food (No MSG). Has vintage appeal and makes a perfect quick lunch spot or last minute dinner meal. An absolute must try for locals and passerbyers!",DiPRm3FaydnIidnzpvdmeA,0,0,5,1X3nUQD1QyrQvVimsHta3Q
946008,2013-11-13,0,Hza9Lq1vqA4yTElotZVTDA,Oh so good. I had the Chx Satay w/ peanut sauce and every bite was delicious! My dad shared his Chx Chow Mein and we were very satisfied when we left. The waiter was very nice and polite. The bathroom was spotless. Going back there very soon.,arbtE_lSNCJIEQm1JVB2SQ,0,0,5,N3m0bQnSrorInqF-AcKu3w

3616186,2013-12-03,0,Hza9Lq1vqA4yTElotZVTDA,No sweet n sour on the chicken. Also no veg in the fried rice. Curry was water and no flavor and few carrot and lots potato lil chicken. Plus the salad taste like needs a wash. Spring rolls were the highlight and that isn't saying a thing at all. Overall just a bad experience and when we tried to pay. No cards only cash and no ATM almost just left and wish we had. Never again,QLFV8LL3KDUr5KisugXb-g,0,0,1,CsNHVzgF8qD9yWMFbnjkRQ
3657492,2013-11-15,0,Hza9Lq1vqA4yTElotZVTDA,"So, just so everyone knows, this place recently underwent significant changes.  No more $6.50 all day menu.  Most of the reviews here are referring to the old setup and menu of this restaurant.

The former owners of King & I on Maryland are helping out the owner of this place, and the new menu is identical to King & I (including dishes, prices, and even font!).  So, you're looking to pay around $10 for an entree at dinner time.  They do have a lunch menu with entree, fried rice, and spring roll for $6.50-7.50, depending on meat. Like King & I, the food is delicious.  Good portions, lots of flavor.

The inside of this place is teeny tiny, with just a few tables, but it's a great option for takeout or delivery (delivery fee is $2).

Overall, if you like King & I, you'll like this place.  It's good food for a pretty decent price, and it's the best option in this area.",BgF9Iy2wKPLYAcU-1Kfq_w,1,0,4,0YHhotHHUu0qbcZ52glRxA

I was blown away. Delicious food. legitimate spicy food with tons of flavor. If you're in the area, hit it up.",cZe5Nr_LoVxwjCqtPUb0NQ,0,0,5,-GtM4XOvAqDe-CC2o9sw8g
