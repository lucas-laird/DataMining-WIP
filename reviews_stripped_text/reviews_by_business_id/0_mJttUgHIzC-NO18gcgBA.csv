We waited almost an hour for our food to be served  and when our food arrived it was cold and soggy.

Anyhow, we decided to have dinner today and give them a try since they denied all allegations, and unfortunately did not go well. We order 4 dishes and one of them in particular was the ceviche in a bowl (can't remember the name but somewhere in the lines of ""limoncito""). Half way through the ceviche I noticed a long piece of blonde hair. You can imagine my reaction or anyone's reaction on this. We flagged down what seemed to be someone in charge, not the waitress since she didn't return for a while. He was surprised and apologized about the situation and immediately took the plate. 
I did not want to continue eating at this point since now crazy thoughts were passing through my head. 
The waiter/manager returned with what he said to be a newly prepared ceviche and again apologized about what had occurred. I started looking at the ceviche and guess what I find again....... yes a second, long, blonde hair. By the way I am brunette. 
He was already walking away when he get his attention again. At this point I'm like forget it! He seemed confused and was surprised that again a blonde hair was in the plate. I showed him how it was all wrapped around the food. Yes, he apologized but then walked away with more waiters nearby. The waitress then came back and advised that the meal was removed from our bill and that they don't understand how a hair was in the food since all their chefs are males. I told her that obviously it wasn't mine if that's were she was going since I am a straight brunette with no highlights whatsoever. ---- lesson learned everyone, don't go to places who have been closed or on the news due to health and food related problems!!!",L-Ki_qzVZ6Urz044mgMtxQ,0,0,1,Zkp8uGAO52lZLKn29NxcDA

The chips and salsa are good but they don't warm up the chips at all and they needed a little extra salt. 
If your looking for good mexican seafood though I would say its worth a shot. The meals I saw others getting, especially the shrimp dishes, looked amazing.

1271477,2017-03-11,2,0_mJttUgHIzC-NO18gcgBA,"Yelp alerted me that there was a hot Mexican restaurant  nearby us, we were at Sunrise Hospital.  Totally read mom's mind lol Mexican food is her fav & we were impressed by the reviews & pictures.

What a perfectly festive Mexican atmosphere!  The bright coral colored building was so easy to find.  A large dining area toward the left & an opened seating area & bar to the right.  I love the decor w/ a couple of horse & mariachi statues & authentic Mexican blankets hanging from the wall.  We sat at the huge bar, in front of window by the 'Ceviche Station.'   

Bartender Danny, Chef Jose & the whole crew were awesome.  I ordered a large Margarita on ice w/ salt as the chips & dip arrived.  I told them that I felt like something healthy & spicy w/ Pulpo (octopus).  Chef Jose had me try three sauces, all of which were tasty.  One had a Hawaiian bbq flare, one had a nice spice, but the lime & Tajin sauce was ultimately my fav.  He made this fresh & amazing dish called the Botanas Mixta Fria, except w/ octopus only.  He also made a small side dish of the Botanas Tropical.  Perfect name for it too w/ the shrimp ceviche, mango & the Hawaiian spicy sauce.  The ceviche comes w/ two tostadas wow!  Ceviche is a cold seafood dish just in case you're looking for something hot, like mom was.  

Mom had the Enchilada Verdes de Pollo w/ white rice, beans & three very filling shredded chicken enchiladas, covered in a tasty green tomatillo sauce.  I ate half of an enchilada w/ hot sauce & it had enough sour cream so I didn't need to ask for a side of it.  Perfect amount of everything in this enchilada.  I am not a fan of shredded chicken, but this was the best.  

The other bar guests order some yummy items too such as the Tamarindo Water, Mango Margarita & an oyster topped w/ shrimp ceviche.  Both the cocktail list & food menu were spectacular.  More than burritos, tacos, enchiladas & margaritas, there are so many unique seafood dishes w/ half-shelled oysters, mussels, crab & lobster, a beautiful pineapple & shrimp dish called a Piña Loca, along w/ oyster shooters & Michalada's.  The Molcajetes are calling our name in the very near future lol steak, shrimp, chicken, chorizo or the Volcan w/ shrimp, crab, octopus & prawns!  The presentation is one-of-a-kind & huge!  One to four people sized dish w/ all of this wonderfulness in a large mortar.  

I really hate to say it, but both the pulpo & enchiladas were better than my top two favorite Mexican spots, one located on the strip, Javier's at the Aria & our local fav Lindo's!  Certain things like the chips w/ salsa & beans w/ Strip View are better at Lindo's, but that's nothing compared to the menu at La Mojarra Loca... whoa!  I can't wait to come back for so much more.

I am not a fan of the location, far from my house, but for lunch I will be back.  Also it's got that authentic feel & on the weekends they have the live mariachi.  ¡Salud!",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,9,4,5,OnwXub91OQqbW6EbvDFQpw

We got some alcoholic beverages and they were OKAY not great i got a puerto vallarta drink which is kind of like a piña colada but hardly any taste of any alcohol and it had whole pieces of ice wasn't to great to try and drink it (guessing they need a better blender?) .Reason I gave a low rating was the poor customer service. Yes at first when we arrived all smiles but then waited roughly 15-20 minutes to actually get an order in. Once we were done eating we waited at least 20 minutes we kept looking around our waiter was no where to be seen so finally i caught another waiters attention and asked if he could call our waiter so we can get the check . Our waiter finally showed up and gave us our ticket said thank you and walked away as we were placing our cards to pay we realized he charged us for some drinks we had ordered but we were told ""oh sorry we dont have any more "" so we switched to regular drinks but he still wanted to charge us the other drinks we asked him to correct it and the ticket came back TWENTY dollars more then before .

This place can be hit and miss though.  I've noticed that when they are busy the food sometimes is lacking. Luke warm shrimp is not the most pleasant thing to eat. Also, I will not be returning to this restaurant on Sundays. The band is wayyyyyy to loud. It's cool for the first song or so, but after a half an hour of trumpets blaring in your ears you start to get annoyed. You can't even hold a conversation with the person next to you. Stupid reason to loose business IMHO. 

Update 

Another star gone for these guys from me. Service is absolutely awful. Twice now in a row the staff has been rude and always rushed. I don't know what the management is thinking by having such a small waitstaff. They are always miserable and seem to be overwhelmed and off kilt. Food is still amazing, and this is the only reason this place is not one star. Going to eat at the bar next time, and see if it's any better.

I called La Mojarra Loca that same day and they were great about accommodating my request. When we arrived we were quickly seated. This was all of our first time dining here. Right as you walk in you feel the lively energy and aromas of what will hopefully be some amazing food. Once we were seated we were promptly greeted by Sergio and Esteban who took care of our drink orders and the chips for the table. The live music and energetic environment makes it a bit difficult to communicate with the servers but it's not anything you can't overcome. 
At this point Sergio was swapped with Omar and we had the addition of Lucero helping Esteban out with our table. All of them were very diligent and attentive. 
So let's get to the food!!!
We ordered a dozen ostiones preparados and empanadas de camaron for the table. Some of the other items where the Volcan (which is portioned enough to share between at least two), fish ceviche, camarones al mojo de ajo and seafood cocktail. With the exception of one of the individuals being unhappy with his ceviche order, the food was amazing!  Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. Unfortunately there are no photos because there was not enough time between when the food hit the table to when everyone dove in.

One Saturday morning we woke up and decided to go out bar hopping, after a brunch at La Mojarra Loca, and we would Uber it all day.  We got an Uber directly from home to La Mojarra Loca.  After we were seated, we got  a different waitress, who wasn't all that friendly.  We asked for 2 Patron Margaritas, and a dozen oysters to start.  While waiting for our drinks, a manager from another Mexican restaurant stopped to talk to us, and told us that this restaurant had the best Micholadas.  So I asked the waitress If i could have a Michelada also.  She told me 'NO!""  Excuse me?  She said ""you don't need 2 drinks!""  So, after about 10 minutes we received 2 glasses of crushed ice with about a shot of Patron in it with a shot of sweet and sour.  Just awful.  So, My partner complained to the manager, they spoke in Spanish for about 3 minutes, and eventually the manager brought what was supposed to be a margarita. It was AWFUL, so I asked the manager ""Is this Patron?""  He Said ""NO, THAT'S EXTRA!'  I replied ""Well, that's what i ordered when i sat down.""  He dismissed me and went away.  
We were given a plate of oysters, which were quite good, as expected.  Then the waitress never came back.  So after about 15 minutes. I told my partner ""lets go to another restaurant!""  Waitress never came back to ask if we wanted anything to eat.  So, we went to counter, to the manager, and asked for my check.  $75.  We had fully intended to pay for the oysters that we consumed, but expected some kind of break since we weren't actually served any real cocktails.  So I said to the manager ""Youre really going to charge me for those so called drinks?""  He replied ""Well, Next time I'll......""  I said ""Oh, no, there won't be a next time!' The waitress was so lousy she didn't deserve a nickel tip, but i cant do that to anyone, she still got a $5, which was way more than she deserved.  
Used to love the place, food was good. Drinks are Awful, and don't like the management.  When my customers ask where is a good Mexican restaurant (and I was even asked on the street one time, and referred them) I refer them to La Mojarra Loca, but advise them to save their money on the drinks.  Get a beer.

In regards to food taste it's exceptional, better spots out there but the amount of food to the price is what makes up for it.

Kid had cheese quesadilla. One liked. Other didn't. Tortilla is homemade so I think that was more the issue. 

I had three tacos - shrimp and carne asada. Tacos were huge! Was thinking they were street tacos but they were full ones. Carne asada taco only had meat and nothing else - though it was good. Shrimp taco was gross. There's a weird breading they put on. I'm not familiar with it but it was gross. Couldn't eat it. Which is too bad. 

So food overall was 3. 

Problem was that it took quite awhile for food to come and there weren't even that many people at the time. Server showed up rarely.

I ordered the pasta brava??? I can't totally remember

The menu is big, tons of options including some for kids. If you can handle spicy, the ""aguachile verde"" is definitely one of the best I've ever had, but also and by far the spiciest. Everything else was really good, we had shrimp empanadas and shrimp soup. As usual for Mexican places they have agua de Jamaica, agua de tamarindo and horchata, but the real winner is the lemonade, made with limes and not lemons, it's as authentic as it gets.

I hate to be this critical but the waiter really really sucked. 

I'll give a quick run down. 

We arrived. Place wasn't packed or full, seated pretty quickly. We definitely didn't even get acknowledged for roughly around 10min since we sat. The thing that really bothered me was that the soon to be waiter and helper, spent does 10 min not helping anyone around us. Lorenzo was what the receipt stated his name to be. He approached us and handed us menus. Lol. Didn't apologize, didn't even offer a water. Wow. Ok. Chips and salsa slowly followed after. Lorenzo blond hair waiter didn't take our order post 20 min and just told us if we had figured out what we wanted to drink. I should have stood up and left but my wife encouraged me to stay. Ordered drinks. And this is where I broke. 

We finished our drinks and only after we finished our drinks did Lorenzo decide to take our order and then ask me if I wanted a refill. Ha. Good one man. I kept it cool. Ate my food. He brought the wrong tortillas. Figured that would happen also. Left him a dollar tip for him to remember me. 

It seemed as if everything was done on purpose. Shady stuff. The food was bomb tho. But that won't bring me back. I will never step foot into this place again. 

I ain't with no drama. I just hope you think twice before eating here. It's really a hit or miss depending on who is your waiter but if you run a successful business, or in this case, food business, you can't have Lorenzo blond waiter as your first line.

La Mojarra Loca is one of the top marisco spots in Vegas, my personal favorite for two reasons: consistency and pricing.

Customer Service: I'd actually give 5 stars of La Mojarra Loca had across the board customer service, I found service to be hit and miss, they get very busy here and I know its tough for waitors to be extra attentive under those circumstances. 

FOOD:
You dont have to break the bank to get good seafood here. I started going to this spot over 1 year ago, I've tried many items from the menu. I stick to the seafood tostada: fresh with lots of lime. The langostinos al rey: BEST thing on the menu in my opinion full of flavor lots of garlic and citrus. I've had molcajete, not as good as it looks, and the shrimp enchilada tacos were tasty as well. 
 
DRINKS:
If you like margaritas and micheladas, this place wont disappoint you! The mangoneada is so good here you forget there is tequila in it, but and the mangochelada is BEST here (can you tell I like mango?), perfect way to refresh yourself in the Vegas heat! What I like about the drinks here is that I dont feel short changed in quality or quantity. 
Definitely recommend this place if you want Mexican seafood and drinks.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,1,0,4,pROZ7QypB2BR35G2y1yI4g

Was here for Valentine's on a Sunday, so of course it was super packed. Started off all bad, we waited for an hour after finding out we were skipped on the list. The organization with the waitlist was all bad, my group wasn't the only one that had this problem.

Once we were finally seated, the servers made up for everything. They were very nice and attentive to our every need, even though they were super busy running around. All our food was delicious, nothing was rushed or sloppy. To compensate the errors with the seating, we got a dessert and alcoholic drink for free. 

Overall my group and I ended up very happy, and will definitely be back. This location beats the other 2 locations here in Vegas. The molcajete, flan, and mangoniada with alcohol are a must try!! I forgot to take pictures.",0KV4m_0y676-aS86rJTXBw,0,0,5,l8Kqj_mGYmXCEhfk7GlWgg

That's why I blame myself for choosing this restaurant on a Friday night that happened to be Cinco De Mayo that also happened to be during the dinner rush. I'd like to be a dick and low ball them but that's not what yelp or I are about.

Totally five stars for the food, but not a 5 star experience.

First off shout out to the server and kitchen for getting the kids food out super fast upon request.

Anyways this place is super cute and the atmosphere was fun. They had a mariachi and it was packed. They quoted us twenty minutes but that wasn't a thing.

We had a feast! First time for me and we ordered everything and it was all delicious.

I definitely recommend the Fried fish with seafood and the volcan molcajete. The sauce on this dish is amazing. It's $30 but comes with tortillas, rice, beans, and assorted fish in a spicy sauce. The sauce is SO GOOD! OMG! I'm wishing I kept the left overs. It's rich, sweet, spicy, and so complex. The mojarra loca is the restrautants name sake and is served with rice and beans and topped with shrimp and octopus. This is $18 and the fish is a pretty decent size. 

The shrimp that come in both dishes are amazing. 

Also get the oysters toped with ceviche WOW! $18 amazing combination, oysters have a lot of meat, and the ceviche is so fresh. Amazing amazing amazing.

Aside from that we got a kids order of chicken fingers with fries, shrimp empanadas, cheese and bacon mussels, and a small shrimp cocktail. We also all got cocktails. Everything was good except the mussels were weird.

So a thousand percent the food was on point. Came out quick, awesome flavor, cooked well, and stuff I've never seen before. For being all seafood I think the price was worth it too as most dishes are shareable.

My downside was the staffs inability to handle how busy it was. I would totally give them five stars but they can definitely improve. We didn't get our bill until like 20 minutes after our meal and asking twice. On top of waiting an hour and a half to be seated it was just irritating. Our drinks and food came out quickly when we finally ordered but they were just understaffed. They said their systems were down and apologized and we had to scrounge up cash to cover the bill since they couldn't take cards which was fine but the whole ""two tables are ahead of you"" while five more parties got called before us was just irritating and not forgivable. Also no refill on our drinks until we got the check.

I will definitely go back here and have a meal during non peak hours because the food was great.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,2,2,4,kKxRCf66i7WROvTG04O2Vw
4085489,2016-08-31,2,0_mJttUgHIzC-NO18gcgBA,"Hey, do you want to eat a ton of meat and shrimp out of a heavy stone bowl? OF COURSE YOU DO.

Let's cut to the chase. Get the Molcajete Trio. You are getting the shrimp / chicken / and steak, almost shooting out of a huge bowl.  A two person meal of those cost $28. It will feed both of you. 

Opt for the corn tortillas. I've been burned by horrible corn tortillas by other restaurants so I asked for both. Corn are just superior to the flour ones. Plus, the corn tortillas actually hold up here. Side Note: Can we just outlaw store-bought corn tortillas? Or rename them something else. Store bought corn tortillas have just ruined the corn tortillas great name. 

As leftovers, these kept for plenty of days. The steak was still juicy and that marinade was finger licking good. The chicken was moist too and that marinade...

Just when you ask for leftovers, don't think about the environment. The server almost had a stroke because I opted to put the tortillas in with the rest of the food instead of getting a separate box for them. YES YES, I know the tortillas are delicious and hand made. Didn't want the unnecessary waste. 

I've learned my lesson. Get a box for your tortillas. Get a box for your stone bowls of meat. Enjoy for days. Repeat.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,3,5,TnL7jIMT3gSW5jqprTIy8A

I know there are a ton of options in Vegas but we didn't care to go to a hotel or to the strip. This place was in the same parking lot as Escapology so we took the easy way out. And wow did we luck out. 

I had some slight knocks on the place that keeps it from five star. But I won't even go into those. They were nitpicking at best. 

Note that it is a seafood heavy Mexican restaurant. You can get a standard chicken burrito or steak fajita but you kinda have to dig for it. Everything else was shrimp, fish, swordfish, octopus (seriously). Maybe that's typical out here and Denver Mexican standards just different.  I figured despite the fact we were so far from water I'd go with the Tacos Enchilados de Camarones.  They were amazing. I figure I'd get three basic street tacos, light on ingredients. But no. They were stuffed.  The cabbage and pickled onions were fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  And there was something different about their taco shells.  I can't explain it, but they were fantastic. 

If you want off the strip and want to avoid overpriced tourist traps, this is your place. Well done!

See Elizabeth at the bar and order anything you can eat that salsa with. Chorizo and scrambled eggs and huevos rancheros are best in class. And incidentally the coffee is hot, fresh and wonderful.

For the rest of us I will just get all carried away.

Now and then you make a mistake that just goes really well. You know, like discovering flubber or the graphene mixed with a super ball thing (too esoteric???.) Well, we were in Las Vegas for CES and we were looking for the Viva Las Vegas Stamps store for my wife. But first we needed breakfast.

Surprise! There was this garish yellow building called La Mojarra Loca, what appeared to be a Mexican Restaurant that served breakfast. Why not?

Get in an airplane, take a bus or just drive to Las Vegas and stop at this place and eat until your stupid. Get breakfast (Huevos Rancheros or scrambled eggs and chorizo) then go shop or sleep for two hours and go back for lunch.

The chips were fresh and not overcooked, the beans were so good I could have done chips and bean dip and been happy. The two kinds of Salsa are worth bottling and taking home, which I did. I could not make a sound decision so I got Chorizo and scrambled eggs that were warm and filling. So good I did not add any salsa. Then I also ordered Juevos Rancheros an all time favorite of mine. It came with sweet red and green peppers on a delicious tortilla. If you have ever eaten at La Parrrila Suiza (another world class dining experience) you will recognize this flavor. 

I was hoping for a taste of each but I ate every morsel and sopped up the rest with the remains of my chorizo and eggs.

I like Coffee and am relatively picky about it. I will drink warmed hot brown water but I really like good coffee and I was not disappointed. Great flavor, hearty and strong with no bitterness. 

Ok I understand my next comment is not about food but bathrooms can tell you a lot about attention to detail and overall quality. The men's room was emaculate and looked like a designer had been let loose in there complete with an Orchid. They even got toilet seats with a little handle on the side so you can raise the lid with your foot. That of course assumes you are a more civilized man who doesn't just pee on the seats.

This is a great place to eat and just kick back. If Elizabeth is at the bar get to know her because she knows her food and service. We met both managers as well and it is worth speakng to them because they take this place very seriously, and their pride shows all over it.",aYQlPSEi0cXcR-V6BFYBxg,0,0,5,NdpdpYR0IjHDEyd1GfdbZA

I had the mocajete is was a mix of chicken, beef,and shrimp. The shrimp were jumbo shrimp. The beef is carne Asada and the chicken had nothing special but it was good.

Service: 1 star
Value: 4 stars

So I want to start off by emphasizing that the food here was AMAZING. Probably one of the absolute best Shrimp Cocktails I've ever had. This place would have been a SOLID 5 stars, had it not been for the seemingly snobby, inattentive staff. First of all, is it just me, or do all the guys here look like they work at chippendales at night? (not a bad thing, obviously). Everyone here was really good looking, not sure if that contributed to the inattentiveness, but it was definitely different. 

The place was fairly empty on Thursday afternoon when we visited. Our group of 6 was seated immediately, and we received our drinks in a timely manner. They also brought us two sets of chips and salsa to start. To drink, I had a ""casuela"" which was like a margarita in a bowl. It was pretty good, and not to mention, HUGE! 

I ordered the Shrimp Cocktail (as I mentioned before) and it was so good I ate it without adding ketchup or lemon which I don't think I've ever done before. It was absolutely delicious! My kids had a plain cheeseburger, and most of us had a shrimp cocktail. 

Where this place went wrong was the follow-up. My uncles practically had to beg for a refill on their beers. The food took quite a long while to arrive despite the restaurant not being that full. The girl seemed annoyed that we were asking for things, and no one there was very hospitable. 

Despite the sketchy service, the food made up for it all! I also heard they have mariachi on weekends, so that would be worth another visit. 

Overall, I would probably return and hope for a better visit!",gTQEvdmFvjpMR0KUmXQzzQ,0,1,4,jeN_TOpdBzCZIYbztyRXeQ

Anything seafood took longer than expected.  strongly prefer other  places.",8J0O5GCTXAGZNf2uKqstQg,1,1,3,Ci2YixErbMqvu9cODI3Ihw

Went out there for lunch on a weekend and they were super packed but everyone is on beast mode so there's no waiting around for anything! Our drinks came out real fast and they have complimentary chips and salsa.  Their hand made tortillas are really really good and they go great with their choriquezo.  I also had the caldo de camarones and it was good, it had good flavor but I would just suggest that they add some veggies to it... maybe some carrots and green beans??? It was still good though.  Would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.  Great all around.",g_2-si9_4GuAcY9b1FKgFQ,9,10,5,TxMAch8VKUbG_qR5o9S4Hw

They are famous for the clay pot presentation.  Parking is ample.  Nice staff.,NMx2Zxf2aLukc5SoDK5ypQ,0,0,4,4Kl3owkotjsvDAiFO-dHaQ
