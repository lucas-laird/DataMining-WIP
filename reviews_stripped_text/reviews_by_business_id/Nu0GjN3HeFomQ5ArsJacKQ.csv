First stopped by Tacos El Buen Pastor on Fremont but the prices were quite a bit higher than their stand at Bonanza and LVB. So I said forget it and stumbled upon DJ's a block down. 

The menu was pretty standard. Tacos, burritos, sopes, fries, salads, quesadillas. I ordered the taco plate. Came with three tacos, rice and beans. They had two rice selections, three bean options and about six or seven meat options. Plenty of variety. Everything looked fairly fresh given the lack of foot traffic. There were several fresh vegetable toppings and salsas. Everything was very flavorful and tasty. Will stop by again if downtown and craving tacos.",yWHhNCtTULI5CwkowHT27g,2,0,4,9WhzkSZ_leriAE-MQiKPVg
