84046,2012-08-30,0,cZbqG53WCsEyYHSocNZdLQ,"We were excited to try a new filipino restaurant that was highly rated, however, after our experience I honestly do not know why people give such high ratings for this place.  Customer service was awful! The man working the counter was grumpy and acted as if he hated his job. He became more agitated when I showed him my yelp check-in offer for a free drink. 

As for the food, we ordered kare kare, lechon special, shanghai, and dinuguan. There was nothing really special about any of the dishes, as for the dinuguan, it was very bland. The younger guy who was serving our food and drinks was not welcoming at all, he didnt say one word to us.

You can tell the workers play favoritism with certain customers. A larger group of people came after us and instead of ordering at the counter like the sign says, they were happily greeted and taken to a table where they ordered their food. Both workers who lacked customer service towards us were very helpful to the other group. 

I will be sticking to my go-to Filipino restaurants and will not be returning to Elena's.",ly2PHxuhklRek7hL9MJrTg,3,0,2,6wzNrdiH9q1jCP_doJv5jw

         Pork adobo was tender and flavorful , but too fatty and I like pork fat. I just don't like pork fat chunks.  
         Mongo beans needed a little seasoning but otherwise was good once I added some salt.
        Pinakbet was delicious it was fresh and had a clean flavor , bitter melon and eggplant was cooked perfect not to bitter. Overall I think I would give it a 3 1/2 stars.

It was a shock of nostalgia. The whole place is orange - prepare yourself.

In regards to the food, in my opinion, I felt that it was not anything too special (Got the Adobo Pork Omelette Rice). Though friends couldn't stop raving over the omelette rice dishes - filipino food IS a rare find though / a possible reason. 

A warning - taste the sauce for the eggrolls before you dip the eggroll in. You mayyy NOT like it. 

I got to say though - the banana lumpia was delish!!! (We got it whole plate of them for checking in on Yelp ;))

2348882,2011-08-24,0,cZbqG53WCsEyYHSocNZdLQ,"So the original gameplan was to go to Elena's for the AYCE in the morning/brunch hours...didn't happen. We were lounging by the pool too long. Needless to say, our family was famished by the time we arrived at Elena's which was around 6pm. 

The restaurant was strangely empty. I mean, nobody was in there...but us...and the employee. We were concerned that maybe they were still closed but left the door unlocked??? Hmmm...turns out they WERE open. We asked about the AYCE deal and ""auntie"" pointed us to the buffet of Filipino goodness!

It reminded me of your typical Filipino house party -- utensils and plates, along with the steamed rice at the start of the buffet, followed by a long table of various Filipino foods. But in addition to the steamed rice, they also had their famouse pork adobo omelet. I was interested in seeing how delicious this was since during my recent trip to Vegas I was able to devour the Aloha Kitchen version. The verdict? It was pretty good - only since it's a buffet, you're cutting a portion from the omelet (which they btw refill). At Aloha Kitchen, you get an entire portion to yourself. I'm sure the same is true if you were to order this a la carte.

I LOVED their pork adobo, their dinuguan and their pansit (bihon mixed with canton noodles are my fave). The meat had that fatty goodness and it really reminded me of my Mom's cooking. They also had chicken adobo, pinakbet, sari sari, long noodles, pusit, fried chicken, menudo (which I enjoyed) and a couple of other dishes I might be missing. 

What I wish was part of the buffet was kare-kare and lumpia. We did however try their lumpias (both shanghai and vegetable). It was just OK to me. There is something in their veggie lumpia that was stringy...not your typical sprouts. 

We ordered halo-halo too...I thought this was a miss. But just my opinion. Overall, pretty good service, pricing ($8.99 for AYCE) and the food was authentic. I'd come back for sure and maybe this time I'd order off their menu since I already tried their AYCE. :)",JpwnCiInMQdqPz9XnTZsEA,0,0,3,iAEpnLskzIBAph1IiKxerg

I wanted to pick something up on the way to school but I didn't want to go out of the way from my destination. I wanted to avoid fast food and craving for a bowl of rice with a type of meat. Well I ran into and had 2 choices on the way to school on E. Desert Inn and Eastern area, Jun's Korean BBQ or Elena's Filipino Food. 

I chose Elena's and regret eating Pork Adobo Fried Rice Omelet and Lumpia.

Lumpia looked fresh and crispy , which absolutely differed from the taste, inside was soft and watery. I ate it anyways because I was famished and needed food in my tummy.  The pork adobo fried rice omelet was simple, just rice, pork meat, adobo sauce mixed in and wrapped with egg. The sauce had too much vinegar and the smell was so strong that I was embarrassed of my own food and culture while I was eating this in class.  Today, I still taste the strong vinegar in my mouth.....

It consisted of adobong pusit, pinakbet, diniguan, chicken adobo, pork adobo, pansit, and adobo fried rice omelet (and more).  We ordered the lechon special and fried bangus with that.  The three extra order of lechon was a little overkill since they had some bits of it as part of the buffet.  The bangus was so crispy and full of that belly fat I love to dip in garlic vinegar.  You just have to use your fingers with this type of food!  No moist towelette will do after...wash your hands with soap for at least 5 minutes!

I apologize for not remembering the price per person, we all just pooled the last of our cash.  It was on a ridiculously cheap side.

2913052,2010-08-08,0,cZbqG53WCsEyYHSocNZdLQ,"We were in Vegas looking for a non-turo  turo Filipino restaurant. After driving around to all the yelp-reviewed Filipino restaurants, We decided to stick with Elena's Home of the Finest Filipino Food. Coming from Hawaii and having eaten at Elena's in Waipahu, we trusted the quality of the food. For a party of 8 we ordered: Kare Kare, Sari Sari, Shrimp Sinigang, Lumpia Shanghai, Pancit, Lechon Special, and of course, Halo Halo for dessert! 

Everything was great! I loved the Kare Kare (9.99) --perfect balance of creaminess, peanut butter, vegetables, and meat.  Sari Sari (7.99) we very savory and wonderful all around.  The Shrimp Sinigang (8.99) had lots of large shrimp and married sour and salty flavors very well. The Lumpia Shanghai was a hit ( 3.99 for 6 pieces) -- homemade and very crunchy - just the way we like it.  The Pancit we probably the weakest dish (6.75). It was a bit bland and lacked very much pizzazz. The Halo halo (4.99) was also nothing to write home about, lacking beans and generally overpriced in my opinion. The star dish of our meal was  the lechon special (8.99), chopped crispy pork with onions and tomatoes. We loooooved it! 

Opened in August 2008, the restaurant is very clean and service was friendly. The ambiance and decor were very nice and warm. A great choice for Filipino dining that is a step above from those Turo turo's.

On occasion I have even been treated to a free portion of some dish that I asked about. There was maybe one time that my pansit (sp) didn't taste 100% fresh, but that's it. The price is right, the portions are good, and it beats the heck out of fast food chains. A poor college man's dream.

Though the majority of my experiences have been in ordering take out, I must agree that the atmosphere leaves a little something to be desired. The service is as slow as you would expect from a hole in the wall place like this, but it has never been to the point where it bothered me. 

I've eaten there plenty of times and, business willing, I intend to eat there plenty more.

After reading the guidelines I feel morally obliged to edit: This is my first time writing for yelp but far from the first time using it. This was sparked by a sign at Elena's saying a free gift for ""a review"". So I whipped out my smartphone and posted away. Everything I said was my honest opinion, regardless of any gift. You wanna know what the gift was? Wait for it... FREE FOOD! Woooo! Now this poor college student can eat for that much longer simply for sharing his opinions.

I've read this is ilocano style food so it's not the exact style I grew up eating. We ordered adobo chicken fried rice omelet and a combo plate of pork adobo and pancit bihon. The omelet was good. The pork adobo had more vinegar and less soy than I cared for and pancit was bland and kinda dry. I know adobo is regional and I'll get a different adobo based on who is making it. It was good just not what I like.

4444433,2013-04-05,0,cZbqG53WCsEyYHSocNZdLQ,This place reminds me of their home based establishment in Hawaii. Just having returned from home nearly two weeks the craving for HI food hit. I had heard Elena's was in Vegas but was never able to pin point their location. Until now! The restaurant is roomy but was nearly empty when we arrived. We sat down quickly to review the menu. The woman serving us was a gem. She checked up on us continuously and never let our drinks get half way through before she refilled. Asking us how the food was and if we wanted extra rice at no charge was great too! I ordered the two choice combo. Chicken and pork adobo. The chicken adobo was by far my favorite of the two. The pork was great too but I couldn't get enough of the chicken. My gf ordered pansit and another meat dish (not sure of the name) she said very little during our consumption and with an empty plate I'd say they gained another regular. We also ordered the halo halo on the way out. While it was good we have had better. Which is why the four stars and not the five.,WgavxzpJ79SafwOXaO3HAw,1,1,4,lrYZ1YAqG7qs9synsldGJQ

 This lovely establishment is located on Dessert Inn and Eastern.. in the ROSS shopping center..

The buffet is has about 5-12 items a bit small but it had all my favorites such as;

Chicken adobo
Pancit
Adobo Fried Rice

And a few other ones i do not know the name of. 

$6.99 can't go wrong for an all you can eat.. 

If you do not wish to do the all you can eat you can order ala cart but it would be silly not to do the all you can eat since the ala cart will equal to that amount.. just stick to the items i mentioned! hehe


I must warn you the presentation is not that great and the food does not look to appealing, maybe they need to put more lights  in the place, but trust! im a Filipino and the food is good!

Try now! can't beat a 6.99 filipino food buffet. I'm not even sure if there is such a thing here in vegas..",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,6,4,4,pbT4j9VlbEZWttX4yBgtUQ

My wife and I are both originally from Hawaii where the Filipino Food is of a very high standard due to the large Filipino population there. I, luckily, am married to my wife who is Ilocano and has since taught me the cuisine of Filipino food through her Mom's home cooking back in Hawaii. As we were eating lunch here on Sunday, Nov 14, I have never heard my wife utter the words ""This Pancit tastes just as good as my Mom's."" We had the buffet which had over a dozen things to choose from and everything was just good...... real good. The Adobo selections were plentiful and just right with that great vinegar taste! Adobo Omelette y'all! They even had Pork and Pumpkin which is one of my wife's favorites. The Monggo Beans was awesome and had a different taste from what I'm used to, but it was really tasty. One thing that set me just right was the little bowl of onions, tomatoes, and Bagoong as a side dish! I only usually have that at my In-Law's home during dinner!! We even had Hawaiian Sun drinks to top off the whole meal. I wanted to get some Halo-Halo but we were really full and could have used a nap to recover from all the food.

The service was quick and very welcoming. The overall look and feel of the restaurant is very home-style and themed to everything Filipino. Get away from casino food and make the short trip off the Strip to Elena's.",kJOkmWQoL0Jy8iTea_V6og,1,1,5,OUDpKUDoVVIUmsy0dWgufQ

We like the mellow atmosphere of the restaurant because it wasn't too busy or overcrowded, they play island music, and the service was friendly.

Impromptu stop here for halo-halo after sushi with the boyfriend.  I've never been to Elena's and supposedly it's popular, but on a Thursday night at 7:45pm, the place was deserted.  We each got an order of the popular Filipino dessert, which traditionally consists of shaved ice, evaporated milk and a plethora of other ingredients, ranging from leche flan, ube (purple yam), ice cream, coconut (macapuno), sweet potato, plaintain, jackfruit (langka), red beans, and some sort of gelatin.  The said fruits and beans are placed in a cup or bowl first, then the shaved ice, then the ube and/or ice cream, and finally the evaporated milk is poured over the whole thing.  Halo-halo means ""mix-mix"" and that's what you do--mix that whole thing up and consume.  Well, we've now decided to do a tour of Vegas for the best halo-halo; this was not it.  We got four ingredients in our halo-halo here:  ube ice cream, vanilla ice cream, the coconut, and some sort of gelatin. I should have known it would just be okay because the menu sign says, ""no beans,"" next to the halo-halo menu item. Not the best version--no leche flan, either!  So, on to the next place.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,6,3,66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74Qw
5862811,2011-09-08,0,cZbqG53WCsEyYHSocNZdLQ,"5 stars for service, 5 stars for the food.  Theo, the owner, is incredible.  Like shut-the-front-door incredible.  I took my family here as an introduction to Filipino food.  They're Chinese, and for any Asian, Filipino food is just...different.  They were hesitant.  I had already warned them that the food was likely greasy, b/c I've been to 3 other Filipino places in Vegas, and they've all been swimming in the grease.  Anyways, I told Theo that this was their first time and also mentioned that my fiancee and I chose his restaurant b/c we'd been to the branch in Oahu and luv'd it.  So he took care of us.  Really took care of us.  In addition to the free soda we got for checking in, he brought out two extra entrees...on the house.  Here is what we ordered:
- chicken long rice- clear rice noodles with shredded chicken.  Solid.
- original fried rice omelet- savory goodness.  The take of this classic dish wins me over.  It's their signature dish.  Order it at least once.    
- chicken adobo- succulent chicken.  a filipino classic.  dip with a vinegar-ey sauce.
- gisantes- a pork entree that is a little tart.  interesting. not a bad item, but we had so much incredible food, that this took longer to finish.
- dinguan- surprisingly good.  I don't normally go for blood, but the blood was more a part of the sauce, so not a bad dish.  I'd eat it again.
- pinakbet- pretty good.  We ordered a lot of meat heavy dish, so this was refreshing.  I didn't get a piece of the bitter melon, so I can't tell you how bitter it was.  (Some restaurants don't balance it with enough savoriness).
- pansit- popular with our table.  I wished I got more of it.  
- lechon- You must order this.  Crispy pork rind.  Very good.
- Pig Feet Lauya- I know this is a bit adventurous for some.  Please do yourself a favor and order this dish.  The skin and the meat around this portion of the pig is just so succulent and...ahhh, I'm salivating thinking about it.  I can't wait to go back and order it again. 
- shanghai lumpia- I prefer my mother's Viet eggrolls, but these were good.
- banana lumpia- good.  I like fried banana desserts, so I had to try this.  It does not compare to pisang goreng, but we liked it enough.

Nothing we ate was not yummy.  I'm afraid that my review is not helpful, since it's not critical.  But I could not be happier with my experience there.  The best part was that the food was not a bit greasy.  A great success with my family.  Please come and support a wonderful local business.",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,0,1,5,jbTrcN9PJ7yA0rqguhgBWA

Now i'm not one to eat crazy things like liver, tripe, chicken blood or a baby chicken...but I will eat fried intestines. Sorry I know this sounds horrible but it's so good. The sari sari is delicious too. Almost as good as my dad's which I get every week. The Lechon Special is not oily or too crispy. I ate my fair share of all these dishes and then some. I had waited about 6 months to come here, and it was certainly worth the weight!!! I loved it! 

The restaurant decor could use a little help...ok maybe a lot of help. And it's kind of weird that they have this big screen tv in the middle of the restaurant,

Their adobo is different than other filipino adobo we've had before, but in a good way! It certainly was not as salty or greasy. There is an AYCE buffet if thats your thing. I believe its around 9-10 dollars? Overall, good food, good selection, decent prices, and generous portions.
