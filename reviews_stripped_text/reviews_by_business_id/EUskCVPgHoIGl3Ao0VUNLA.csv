They have about 3 different selections and they are all under $2.50.   I always get the bacon wrapped dog topped with mayo, ketchup, mustard, avocado, and pineapple and on the side, a stuffed grilled jalapeño. Seriously delicious!  On lucky nights they also offer tamales, but I say lucky because these are almost always gone by the time we arrive.  You can however pre-order and last I checked they are still just a buck. 

It's normally just two ladies at the stand and they are very nice. The stand is becoming more and more popular so expect a wait.  They appear in the evening and mostly on the weekends, but you can always call to make sure.

Sure there are lots of hot dog places popping up all over town and some a lot fancier than they need to be in my opinion. I am just so glad to be adventurous and diverse when it comes to trying new places.  I get a lot of different looks when I suggest this place because of its location and appearance, but then again I won't be the one missing out...",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,33,31,5,QzFTO-3v4t7fYiXeH5PneA

If you are familiar with the street dogs they sell in LA, (Bacon wrapped dog with sauteed onions and peppers) Fernandez Hot Dogs can be considered ""LV style"" street dogs.

Two ladies run this cart, but the only downer is that they do not have a set schedule. When are they open? when you see the lights on and the cart outside. It is what it is...
They have a no-frills, straightforward menu which offers the following hot dogs:

ESPECIAL DE PINA-($2.50) Bacon wrapped dog, ketchup, mustard, mayo, pineapple, and sliced avocado

ESPECIAL DE CHAMPINONES-($2.50) Same as above, but with mushrooms

PINA, CHAMPINIONES-($2.00) Same as above two, regular hot dog

SENCILLO-($1.50) Regular hot dog, pico de gallo, ketchup, mustard, and mayo

AMERICANO-($1.00) Regular hot dog on a bun

You can pay a small fee for additional toppings and they have Jarritos and other soft drinks available as well. We got the Especial de Pina and every bite was delicious! The Bun was nicely toasted, hot dog was nice and plump, smokiness from the bacon, sweetness from the pineapple, and creaminess from the avocado all worked well together.Who knows? maybe we could make a little pit-stop during our upcoming taco trek!? Stay tuned!   ALOHA!!!

It's authentic, simple and beautiful in a city that's short on all three of those counts.

For $2.50 you can get an Especial which is a grilled dog loaded with avocado and pineapple. Sublimely delicious, and only 40 cents more than one measly taco at Taco El Gordo just up the street. 

Forget TEG, go to Fernandez every time.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,3,5,5,Rv9B_T0eHhqSIauP6G8IAA

I am a simpleton so I just ended up getting an ""Americano"" with mustard. The Americano is just a regular grilled HotDog on a grilled bun with your choice of sauces. The menu is simple and the prices are good. I was told the HotDog is a Mexican dog with mixed meats. The end result was a pretty greasy grilled dog on a greasy grilled bun, it was excellent!

 When asked they stated they had been in business for 7 years, proudly displaying their SNHD grade A plaquard as well as aplicable business licences.

I was told they are open 7 days a week from the hours of 7PM-11PM so you only have 4 hours to stop by.",xUERnT37083Tzip1afVf7A,2,0,5,8EAKig8gu5hTlcBQ35MGKw
5800342,2013-08-13,1,EUskCVPgHoIGl3Ao0VUNLA,"If you are into LA style street dogs this is the place to come.

I found this cart on charleston down the way from TEG its normally setup in front of a tire shop between burnham and crestwood on the northside of charleston. I was driving by and saw the hot dog sign having ate several LA style street dogs I have been looking for them here forever. Now these are NOT LA style dogs like the lady on broadway makes these DO NOT have bell peppers or grilled onions. 

What they do have is their own twist on LA style dogs. So lets break down the menu: You have to choose from an Escpecail de pina which is a hot dog wrapped in bacon with pico de gallo mayo ketchup mustard and pineapple with a roasted jalapeno that filled with cheese. Escpecail de Champinones which is a hot dog wrapped in bacon with pico de gallo mayo ketchup mustard mushrooms and avocado slices also with a roasted jalapeno that filled with cheese. A Sencillo is a hot dog with with pico de gallo mayo mustard ketchup and an Americano is just a frank in a bun, or you can get the pina and champinones with no bacon for .50 cents less. But who doesnt love bacon and its only .50 cents lol. 

Now the menu is not huge but the flavor is monumental. I highly recommend checking out this cart!!",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,6,1,5,IgUqTXDDks4PUDBCwx0CUw
