The food was everything I wanted it to be. I ordered a Desi burrito with chicken. Every bite was exceptionally tasty and I recommended everyone should try it at least once, if not 10 times.

1464918,2016-07-13,4,iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw,"Yummy street Indian fast food :) owned by Mint owners and basically in their parking lot!!! 
This artsy food mobile trailer/stand has a drive thru and I really love that. Why? because it's freaking hot outside. 

We have been here and I'm totally a fan, hubby...not so much. It gives him a tummy ache :( I guess his stomach cant handle the oil and spices (we eat oil free at home).

*NOTE* This place is for cheat days. This place sauces, wheats, and frys everything on their menu :) 

Probably my top pick is the vegan tofu chili burrito. It's a huge sloppy mess of potatoes, sauces, veggies, and more sauce. 
I can only ever eat half of it and I end up tossing the rest because it does not do good at all as a reheat snack. 
Or the next time I should just get a bowl maybe!!!! 

Marsala fries are yummy but they kinda just remind me of season salt? Maybe kick it up a notch with some hot sauce if you are a spicy freak like me. 

The guy at the window is always super nice. I always have my own water when I come here but I really wish that I have tried some of their drinks. They look really good. 

I got an order of those Pani Puri....I thought I was awesome and told my husband I knew what they were....wrong!!!! I pulled them out of the bag like ""where is the inside to these bubbles :?!?!""
But now I know and they were tangy and yummy.
Basically you pop a little hole in the puffy crunchy bubble and then insert the cauli mix and the green sauce. Super yum. Its a pleasant surprise of an explosion in your mouth!

The veggie samosas are the best I have had in town as far as veggie goes. They come one per order. They are fried and the last time I came here I just ordered two of them and I was satisfied. 

I have yet to try their breakfast burritos but you better believe your lentil I will be back to try them ASAP!!!!!!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,7,5,4,h05MxYsXvit5yF3lTE9OhA

If the question is secret sauce...the answer is yes. The fries are even seasoned perfectly to mix with their sauces. The korma sauce was out of this world.

I had a paneer chili taco, masala fries, paani puri and a mango lassi while my friend ordered a chicken chili taco. We both very much enjoyed them. Be warned, they are tiny and addicting, you'll want one more and then one more again! 

Seating is outdoors, the establishment is food truck-esque and they have patio tables to enjoy your food. We weren't there on a very busy day but I imagine it fills up awfully quickly when it is. They're only open until 8pm so plan to show up accordingly. 

What makes it even more special is that two very kind souls, Dharmesh and his wife now own this joint and make everything from scratch. They are a 2 bodied business and work extremely hard to please each and every customer. We were asked multiple times if we enjoyed our food and if we needed anything more.

My wife also had a mango lassi. She said it was good, but has had better. The service was fast and friendly. The food was huge in size and flavor! We will be back to try more vegan options.

But it was great! It's not really fusion. It's more of the use of Mexican structures such as the taco to present Indian food such as saag paneer. It works. As Indian food, its high quality. 

Two notes. First, it's slow. But that is a good sign. They are making the stuff fresh. Second, be careful in the drive through. You can't see what is coming from the left as you exit.

2010552,2016-03-11,15,iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw,"The 411: Desi Burrito is a colorful food truck across the street from the Atomic Museum, where the owners of Mint Indian Bistro are serving up fast food with a slight fusion twist. 

The Food: Menu features burrito style wraps (your choice of flour or wheat), bowls, apps, and desserts. Masala fries and samosas were as expected, small size (and price!) makes them good add-ons to your meal. Lamb stir fry wrap had a mild heat to it and was nicely saucy. My guy and I disagreed about the chili chicken bowl- he felt the cheese and lettuce didn't really work, I appreciated that a lot of grilled veggies were included.

The Service: Polite and prompt. Used the online ordering system and an item was accidentally missing (double check your order before you go!), staff were nice about making it fresh and fast. 

EXTRA INFO: There is a drive thru and online ordering available for convenience, and they even have breakfast!  They have unique customization options like brown or white rice, both available in lemon and masala flavors. Like most Indian restaurants, Desi Burrito has tofu options, so bring your vegetarian friends!

EDIT: Dropping a star. Second online order was wrong, too. It's not that hard to double-check before you bag it up, you can even look it up.

This place has a Chipotle concept, but with Indian cuisine. You pick either burrito or bowl, type of protein (lamb, vegetarian tofu, or vegan tofu), type of rice, then you can turn it into a combo if you'd like. I got a tofu burrito on wheat tortilla with lemon brown rice and fries. My brother got a lamb burrito on wheat with brown masala rice. We also got mango custard and special sauce on the side for our fries. They only had 3 small tables on their patio which were all occupied, but I didn't mind because I love having picnics anyway, so we went down the street to a park and had a nice picnic. 

Both burritos were very flavorful. The veggies, rice, and meat/tofu went together so well. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the burritos. The fries were perfectly crisp and seasoned. My brother ended up stuffing his fries in his burrito and eating it like that. I had mine on the side with the special sauce which was almost like a tzatziki sauce. Either way, the fries were yummy even by themselves. 

I will definitely be back and I'll probably try out a bowl and some veggie samosas next time. $10 for an organic well balanced meal with a side and drink really isnt a bad deal at all!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,4,5,fi2tyAfNIe2TDliMrA2dYA

I hit the Desi Burrito food stand a while back and first off, I love the artwork. The random moon faces, what looks like an Indian farmer's market scene, and everything else that covers the burrito like structure it's very eye catching. Even if you weren't hungry, you might be after looking at the artwork and smelling the tasty aromas. 

I waked up and went with the Chicken Chili Burrito, Samosas, and the Pani Puri. Like I mentioned before the smells coming from the window were intoxicating and might have caused me to over order. The burrito was decent sized and filled with tons of flavor, tender spicy chicken, brown rice and assortment of veggies. A great option if you're hungry because this thing is huge, but also messy. My burrito had a little too much sauce, which with the added chicken chili sauce, my tortilla simply fell apart about halfway through. 

The samosas were great, but pricey. These little fried pockets stuffed with potatoes, green peas and will run you about $1.50 each. A nice side snack, but I'm not sure they are worth the cost. Pani Puri are hollow fragile pastry balls that you crack open, fill potatoes, spicy water and then consume. These took so much work for such little flavor; I was over it by the second one. 

I really enjoyed most of the food here and the service was fast. I just feel like there's a few things that don't translate well to the food stand culture, like messy snacks time-consuming snacks.

I suggest for those who are, to still inquire. One or more of these diets may have if, ands, or buts i.e. how and/or where the food is prepared in presence of what have they. You know what I mean...

Supposed to be fusion. A yelper friend and I briefly discussed what was the fusion? Tortilla versus naan... Probably so. Quesadillas are also on their menu, but it was not an available item when my cousin had ordered. They also mentioned some items to be removed from the menu, but have not yet been crossed off.

Their lamb burrito bowl was tasty. It was a first and no regrets there. Chicken desi burrito is something I commonly order. I like the flavor and spice. Authentic cuisine eaters may have critique on it. But I find the desi burrito filling and satisfying to my hunger.

Most items on the leftside or middle of their menu can be turned into a combo which includes a canned or bottled beverage with masala fries. My recommendation for potato freaks is the masala fries. One must be able to take the spiciness though. No wimps allowed for the spice in their food here. 

Only outside seating. Trees next to their tables aren't full grown yet; they don't look like it - so shading is minimal. Their space all in all is small. It's a cement foundationed converted mobile structure. There's a drive-thru side and walk up window. I personally like the way it's been painted. Props to the artist.

My sister got the chicken burrito, while I tried their lamb burrito. The cashier asked if I wanted it mild or spicy, saying that the spicy was really spicy so I requested for the spicy, because I really enjoy spicy. Guess what? The burrito was not spicy at all. Weak sauce, man. The burrito tasted very plain and half way into it, I forgot that I was biting into an ""Indian"" burrito. The burrito, in all honesty, tasted like one from El Pollo Loco or Del Taco. No offense to those joints, but I expected so much more from this place.

3877303,2016-03-21,4,iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw,"Desi Burrito is an Indian food truck with a Mexican fusion concept. Sounds like it's trying to ride the coattails of the successful fusion food truck movement 5 years ago. Except, it's probably 5 years too late. It tries to emulate the Chipotle concept of customization, but choices are fairly limited - you can choose between tofu (korma or makhani), chicken, or lamb in either a bowl or burrito. And while Chipotle's assembly line is expeditious, Desi was anything, but. It took nearly 20-25 minutes to receive our rather simple order. I can't imagine that boding well for the drive-through. 

Given that this endeavor is fairly new, there were many positives. I enjoyed my lamb stir fry wrapped in a flour tortilla with lemon rice. The flavors were great and the tortilla is a great substitute for the traditional naan, which may be too thick to wrap. The pani puri was also a nice, refreshing appetizer if you like chickpeas and mint. The combo comes with a side of seasoned fries and a canned soda.

While the concept is somewhat outdated, the food flavors were good. I wish there was something extra instead of just stuffing Indian food inside a burrito with cheese. Making the burritos a little larger and stuffing them with the seasoned fries would've been a better move. I think with a little refinement, this little spot can blow up, but their speed needs to pick up, especially with the hot summer months rolling around the corner.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,5,6,3,zcrJxGsm4sxmaL4XKe9qhg

Desi Burrito has a very similar concept to Chipotle but with an Indian twist to it! You have the option of picking either a burrito or a bowl then would would select your type of rice, protein, and sauce. 

I went with a chicken chilli burrito with a side of vegetable samosa and masala fries! The burrito is basically chicken curry + rice wrapped in a tortilla. I was sad to see my burrito to fall apart after taking a bite because the tortilla ripped. As much as I love messy burritos, I'd rather not have my food explode in front me. (If that was the case, I would have ordered a bowl instead). Taste-wise, it was oooOoookay. Personally, I thought it was lacking flavor. The vegetable samosa, on the other hand, was amazing!! The two sauces (one sweet and one spicy) were great additions to it that made it more enjoyable. I ended up using the sauces to add flavor to my burrito. The fries were very pungent but strangely addictive! The portions were great, I basically had enough leftovers for another meal. 

You can either dine by their blimp-styled truck or you can order through the drive-thru. My friend and I were considering eating there but considering the 100+ weather in Vegas during the summer, we decided to take it to go. But any other time, this spot would be a cute place to eat with plenty of photo opps with their very bright, bold exterior design.

Desi Burrito was launched by nearby Mint Indian Bistro about half a year ago. The concept appears to be healthy Indian food to-go (or drive-thru or delivery), although they have a few outdoor tables if you want to unbag your stuff and eat it right there. The Chipotle resemblance comes in quite bluntly with entrees consisting of either burritos, bowls, or tacos, plus your choice of meat, rice, and spice level. They also have multiple sides, desserts, and drinks that include what appear to be traditional options.

I chose a Desi Bowl ($7.21) with lamb stir fry, brown rice, and regular sauce. All entrees have lettuce, sauteed onions, peppers, and pico de gallo. The non-vegan ones come with makhani sauce and non-vegan mayo. The rice and most of the toppings seemed to be done well. The lamb was reasonably portioned, but fairly tough to chew. The overall flavor profile seemed to have one note though, and that note was sour. They really couldn't have had sweet sauces like the ""Hawaiian Chipotle"" local chain or just a solid savory profile like actual Chipotle?

I also had one side. The Masala Fries ($1.57) were fairly crisp, but not quite as moist and fluffy inside as I expected. Moreover, the potato was undersalted and the masala seasoning didn't quite cover it up. Note that the savings from going for the full combo are minimal due to the fountain drink / water bottle pricing (which is actually quite reasonable).

Compared to the typical Indian food that you'd find at a lunch buffet or the typical Chipotle-style places like Chipotle itself (and others), I am not impressed by Desi Burrito. It's perhaps a useful local to-go option for a quick lunch (although it seemed to take almost 10 minutes, making it not-so-fast food), or maybe an option for vegans and vegetarians, but nothing worth a special visit with so many other restaurants around town.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,6,3,_kgv-DwfumotIGtaMr3qQA

When we drove to their location on Apr. 5, 2018, the sign said they were temporarily closed while they find a new location.  I was really saddened to see that sign, because nothing on their website or elsewhere says anything about their temporary closure. That sign they put up on their structure doesn't say when they're opening up again or where. That's not very professional, they could keep customers better informed.  

I posted a picture showing what the sign says here on Yelp and will also update Google with a similar update so that others are informed about what's going on with Desi Burrito.

We went to the drive-thru. My sister was talking on the speaker but no response. We drove to the order pick up window to ask if they were open.

I'm so glad I found this place! It's a food truck right by UNLV and  super convenient for anyone unsure if they are in the mood for some Mexican or Indian food. They have a drive thru as well, making it easy for anyone trying to grab a quick bite. 

Quick isn't really the term I would describe the service; there was only one employee serving all of us at around 7pm and we waited about 20-25 minutes in the drive thru for our food. He was rushing and kept having to repeat our order because he was going back and forth from the drive thru to the front window, not writing down our orders. I know it wasn't his fault but maybe the establishment shouldn't have only one worker during dinner time. I did appreciate the fact that he gave us a free water bottle for the wait. 

The food was pretty good. There was so many vegan and vegetarian options and sides, it was so hard to choose. We ordered the tofu chilli bowl (size was a bit smaller than we expected) and the masala potato burrito (a little dry). We really wanted to try out the veggie samosa and the masala fries but they were unfortunately sold out. 

Prices are pretty good - the sides are about $1-3 each and the bowls and burritos are about $7. The menu also tells you what is vegan or vegetarian which made ordering easier.

Desi Burrito is my go-to spot when I'm craving Indian and in the UNLV area. Here's the lowdown ~


THE GOOD:
+ delicious Indian food conveniently wrapped in a burrito
+ filling portions
+ awesome vegan and vegetarian options (such as the Paneer Chili burrito and masala French fries)

THE MEH:
~ prices ($10 for a combo)
~ fresher than fast food, but also longer wait time
~ no indoor reception / AC
~ awkwardly waiting at the walk up menu not knowing if anyone's there

THE BAD:
- sometimes the rice is crunchy towards the end of the day


Overall, recommend if you're in the area and looking for a filling lunch (and if your stomach can handle spicy food). Also recommend calling in for pick up and using the drive thru to avoid the long wait times.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,4,4,jgRcD-ACIGW9LbwjYw1ryQ

The masala fries were awesome! I dipped them in the green chutney from the samosa and it turned it up to 11! Loved it! The tea had a homemade quality that warmed my heart. The samosa was good and the panini stuffing was different and unexpected in a yummy way. Everything sounds great right? 

Well the next morning we realized we never got our bhel puri. We were charged for it and sat there and ate for 45 minutes and no one came out to talk about what happened with the bhel puri. I will admit, we were enjoying the food so much that we didn't say anything. That's on us. But the order was punched in to her computer so they also have some blame in this. I liked the food enough to go again, but I'm definitely going to feel sore about it. We were charged $19 for basically $14 worth of food. A quarter of the meal was missing!

I ordered a spicy potato burrito with a flour tortilla and white rice. I'm a big eater, and this burrito did not disappoint. I was expecting something the size of a Taco Bell Burrito Supreme, but I got something more along the lines of a Del Taco Macho Burrito. The Indian spices were totally delicious, with the pico de gallo nicely cooling things off a bit. I was so full, I didn't need to order anything more.

The down side is that it's in a parking lot and there is only outside seating (so, it's not ideal for eating there when it's summer or winter). I ate in my car, but I savored every bite.

The prices are great, too. For almost $8 (including tax, excluding sides and a drink), you can have delicious Indian food. It would cost $11 plus tax and tip, anywhere else.

I'll definitely be going back for lunch. :-) I just wish it wasn't so far away from where I work.

Update (7/20) - Well, the food remains awesomely delicious. But, it seems that things are down a notch in the ""available ingredients"" category. I've been back several times. One time, they ran out of chicken. Really? Another time, they ran totally out of rice. Really?? Today, they ran out of brown rice. I don't understand how they can run out of common ingredients like this. I don't know if they're keeping their ingredients list small, so that they don't wind up throwing it out if they have a slow day. Hopefully, they get their inventory issues worked out, because I really like the food.

Update (3/12/18) - I drove there for lunch (30 minute drive), today, and there is a sign which reads that they are in the process of moving to a new location. I read a review from less than a month ago, showing they were open (and their Yelp profile shows that they are open, today). I don't know how ""social-media-savvy"" they are, but they really should have updated their Yelp profile to reflect this.
