Came here a couple nights ago and we had to literally wave down the bartenders to serve us after sitting at the bar and being ignored for 15 minutes. We would finish our drinks and then have to do it again. There were only about 5 other people there at the time, but we were the only 2 not gambling, which is most likely why we got ignored. The bartenders need to learn some manners and customer service. Lost 2 customers that night",yCfHdng4J3PXYHeTBUrfjA,1,0,1,_RQcX17xmZ5Zd3E20ek_4g

Bar ran out of their promoted special ""Pendleton"" for 10:00 games this Sunday so when we asked for another whiskey for the special price they basically said sorry you won a $25 gift card during our raffle which should more than cover the extra cost on regular prices (our friends won the gc). Then she says you're lucky we even gave you raffle tickets because they're only for Steelers fans. Very poor service. They're pool cues are horrible as well.

Was  I surprised! The hostess/server  was pleasant when I walked in and greeted me. I sat down at the bar as I called in take out. The bartender was extremely pleasant and asked me if I would care for a drink while I waited for my order. 

As I called it in, I was told it would be about 10 minutes. I live around the corner and was promptly on time. 

The food was soggy and cold; the fries were so OVER SALTED they couldn't be eaten. My fish as well was so soggy that I couldn't pick it up, it fell apart, had to eat with a fork. The onion rings were so cold and the fries as well, they must have not been made to order.  The food looks nothing as they show it on their online menu. 

However, what takes the cake is when I sat down at the bar to wait, a waitress / server behind the bar who was not busy, was using very potty mouth language. There was a patron at the bar playing poker, and a couple sitting down having a drink. I'm not a PRUDE and have been around the block a few times,  but I was offended at her choice of language talking to the bartender with customers present. 

I know for a fact, I will be throwing away my coupons and will NOT revisit this establishment. I am shocked as hell that they were voted Las Vegas best bar food. Who is doing this rating? A new place to try? Think again, go elsewhere. It's not worth the paper they paid to print the coupon. Manager or owner, take these yelp replies VERY SERIOUSLY!

I love timbers food and always have. 1st trip to this timbers, I ordered fish and chips, takeout, went home 5 minute drive and tried to eat the worst fish I've ever had in my life.. I asked for it well done, it was not. It was nasty doughy breading which I peeled off to stale dry fish. Sorry guys but it was real bad.. 1 piece even had a hint of mold. Fast forward 2 months.. I thought I'd give it another try.. ordered the bacon burger to be safe... not too busy and it took a while for anyone to take our order. When we ordered and got our food my bacon was non existent. Asked the waitress if I had ordered bacon and she confirmed.. she apologized and insisted to bring me bacon, I declined but she still did. The bacon was way overdone and not any good. The burger was marginal and my wife ordered nachos which went in the trash. This timbers is not the place to go for food. I will drive the extra 5 minutes to the edge of town across the bridge.

1/2/16 update:

From Kathleen H (business manager)

Please send your contact information to Info@thglv.com. Someone from our Corporate Office would like to contact you about your experience. Thank you.

Apparently management was concerned so they sent me this... I responded, I used my email address as my contact info. I didn't send a phone number or address... 9 days later, NO RESPONSE.  Why even bother? I have now changed my rating to 1 star because of management's inability to manage.

Their Happy hour runs from 4pm-7pm and then 12am -4am. For drinks, my bf usually get Mai Tai and it was strong and tasty.

We had tried their Chicken Wings and Fries, Utimate Grilled Cheese and Beer- Battered Fish and Chips. They were not bad, not great, just ok. However, I recommend Bozeman Beef Dip. The beef is slow roasted, tender and delicious, and complemented by sauteed onions, melted provolone with just enough creamy horseradish. The roll is grilled and firm but great for dipping.

The service has always been on par. The waitresses check up on us just enough but not too much to see if water needed refill or if we needed anything.

I say down and Server (ABRANDON - what it said on my ticket just in case she lied she was a heavier set middle aged woman with black chopsticks in her hair just in case she rang the ticket under someone else's name) finally acknowledged me and asked me if I wanted something to drink. I stated if I can get some water, and I'll decide on anything  else once they arrive. It took 10mins to get a GLASS OF WATER. Server was more focused on her friends that were here then getting something so simply. Further, when my friends arrived she took our orders, and my brother asked if we can get separate tickets in advanced, she responded "" it's a pain in the butt and I already rang it under one ticket!"" My brother then asked is it really hard ... We can't split the ticket, she said , "" No!"" My best friend asked her if she was ok, and she then proceeded to tell our entire table  something under her breathe and as she walked away we all heard her say "" high-strung!"" She then went to the table next to us and clearly venting about us, after we simply asked an easy question.

The ambience is perfectly lit and unobtrusive, the oversized chairs comfortable and inviting. The bar isn't in a dense part of town which means it's rare for it to be overly-busy, which is a huge plus for me. Compared to other bars around the valley, this place gets a well-deserved extra notch for its servers. Steffi and Chrya, the 2 servers I deal with regularly, are always attentive, extremely nice, and quick to attend to our needs. In the few years I've been going here, the service has always been top-notch. I live in Henderson but make the extra drive just to come here whenever I need to relax.

The food is actually really good. They have two different kinds of homemade excellent salsa. Have the tacos!!  The burgers are good. They ask you how you want it cooked (and are OK with medium rare being an option) and actually cook it as you requested. 
Everything I've had there is really good. Just a little smokey but it's a bar. You kinda expect it. I'd rather go without dealing with that but I live in Vegas.   I get it. Can't ding them for that here.",Lub0GDgHhkeJEpDQXcG1VA,0,0,4,w9LWUQj4dGbBmjhnFBkBPw

If I didn't already order my drink I would have left. We got to the bar and the 3 bartenders were to busy chatting amoungst theirselves and couldn't take our order.

I didn't have a chance to write a review last week but now I do. I ordered take out last Sunday, and I was so happy that I wanted to order take out from here again this week for my family. I was so happy with their onion rings that I was craving it. So the first thing that I didn't like is that I was told my food would be ready in 25 minutes. It took 45 minutes. Even if people were dining it, that wait is way too long. For my burger I wanted, onion rings on the side. To my dismay it was fries. My daughter wanted buffalo wings, I wanted medium. To my disappointment, it was labeled Hot and it was even written ""hot"" on the container. My 11 year old could only eat 3 of the 6 wings. I also asked for extra ranch on the side...didn't get that either. There is nothing like leaving the comfort of your home to pick up food, only to get home and see not one, but several things wrong with your order.

Me and my girlfriend usually go on a Friday to have drinks after work which is very good and relaxing for us help to get rid of all those weekday problems that you've had all week.

I usually get something simple like a whiskey and coke which for 2 for 1 is 2 for $3.50 which you can't find anywhere besides maybe Fremont Street for even one for $3.50. They have great beer specials as well when I do drink beer I use he can get one of those as well and their two for one that's also. My girlfriend likes to get the margaritas which come in a highball glass and they are $4.50. One thing I will say is that the bartenders are awesome they like to talk I like to be interactive and they like to make you feel like you are family which is a great thing for a bar because then you feel like you want to come back and you want to interact with them as well.

I did notice that they have gotten a new cuz I don't know if the cook overnight is the same or if they have change that I do have one problem the last time I went late at night the bartender had to end up helping the cook get our food out quick cuz it took so long and when it did come it wasn't good and it looks like the bartender had actually gone back and cook the food himself because the cook that was back I didn't know what he was doing that was a very late night for us around 4 a.m. so I have not been back that late to see if the Cook has changed but as far as the one that's there during the happy hour he is pretty good and haven't had any problems since I do only go during the four to seven happy hour.",9qFJOY7CcgCWuUFMVRttNg,1,0,4,_5wmokogLmFzqe7NZ-YvyQ

However the ventilation in this place is horrible and the cigarette smoke was too much for me. Additionally, the music was so loud that I couldn't even have a conversation with my boyfriend.
