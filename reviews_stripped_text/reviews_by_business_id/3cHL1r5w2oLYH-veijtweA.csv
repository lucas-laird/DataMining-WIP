Great craft beer selection and letting you look at the selection on the ipad is a cool idea.  Also tried one of their cocktails that they age in-house, which was delicious.  I of course tried the poutine based on these other reviews, which did not disappoint.

I have dipped in here before just to drink as well, since there are few options on the strip with good craft beer options.",bZgAh6psRGHPhiP97cow0g,0,0,4,KkwczZQhe59301GF6n8YXw

He chose a 4 beer sampler for me and they were all great. There was an appetizer that I never heard of called Devil on horseback or something, but Ryan recommended it and it was delicious. Got the scallops and they were big and perfectly seared in a great sauce.  Was loving the ipad menu for drinks, made it really easy.

55057,2012-08-09,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"I absolutely LOVE Public House. Not only is their beer selection fantastic, but their menu is pretty damn good too. 

Their pub burger is delicious, but the other dishes are so great that I would venture out to something you wouldn't normally order. 

The pork loin (how it is served has changed a few times, all delicious) is cooked to a medium (145* ish), which is a refreshing change to the typically overcooked pork in most restaurants. 

Their take on chicken and waffles, ""quail and waffles"" was tasty, but the small quail made it a little tricky to navigate. 

Short Rib - My husband's absolute favorite. They actually fall of the bone and you have to knife and fork it.

Scallops - Perfectly cooked, but beware that onions are a main attraction and isn't listed that way on the menu.

Any item from the butcher block/cheese shop make for a great starter, but the devil's on horseback (blue cheese stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon...on the bar menu) are a must-have.

I haven't mentioned too much about the beer, but I assure you any beer lover will be in heaven. If Russell the cicerone is there, you must have him come over and suggest a pairing for whatever you're eating...he was spot on, every time.",FbZ2VQncK-fAEFM94n2I_Q,0,1,5,ba6DYMSUuKYj4HEq8aa6Gw

They asked for us to come back and ensured that they would give us a better experience and they definitely delivered! I couldn't be in Vegas, but my husband was there this past weekend with some friends and got his dinner and drinks comped and they even gave him a private room.

Great physical layout, occupying the old David Burke space at the Venetian, with the bar up front and seating in the rear. Only complaint was w the hostess who seated us at the very first table btw the bar and restaurant areas. Makes conversation difficult, and our request to be seated at a different table (this was at 530p w literally dozens of open tables) was met w a dubious ""they're all reserved."". Blatant falsehood aside as we left 1.5hrs later w plenty of them still open, it was an otherwise good experience. Waitstaff was attentive, but robotic and wo personality, nevertheless the beer selection was extensive and of excellent quality. Surprisingly good was the food as well. Bibb Salad had excellent flavor, as did their Pub burger. As good as those were, the dessert doubly impressed.

We started with the seafood selection for the appetizer and it was delicious, probably the best part of the meal. A few of us had the salmon and asked for it to be cooked medium rare but it came out well done. It wasn't dry which made up for the fact that it was over cooked but disappointed that they couldn't get it right. The thing that makes this review 3 stars instead of four was the service. The place was not packed but the service was incredibly slow. It took forever to get out order in, and for the food to arrive. And there was no apology for the slowness.

A coworker and I were in town for a conference and stopped in for a beer and lunch. The bartenders are knowledgeable about all their beers and will pour you a good sized sample if you're not sure about a particular brew. I overheard another customer ordering a martini and the bartender asked him plenty of questions about how the customer wanted his drink so he could ""dial it in just right.""

I had the poutine with braised oxtail and my coworker had the beer brat sandwich. Both were excellent, but the Public House's fries are absolutely addictive.

Firstly, we were excited to learn that our waiter Arnie, who we were lucky to meet last year, was still there. Arnie is incredibly accommodating and offers kind attention to your needs as a diner. I suffer from food allergies, and I needed an alternative for bread. I asked for sliced cucumber... Where other waiters have said no. Arnie said, let me see what I can do.  Minutes later, I had sliced cucumber to have with my pâté and Bone marrow.  Speaking of bone marrow, you've got to try them here!!  We will be back to the Public house.

I am definitely a foodie so it took me a minute to absorb their vast menu and to decide on 'only' a few items lol. I ordered the beef tongue and cheek pierogies which were delicious over a lil buerre blanc type sauce and I liked the modern take on them; opposed to your traditional style polish dumpling. 
Service was great what really impressed me was the servers knowledge of the entire menus..beer, wine, cocktails, whiskey, food etc.. I asked josh to pair a glass of wine with my sea bass and he recommended a wine and a beer. Impressed and interested I ended up choosing Squatters Hells Keep beer. ...picture to follow.. One word, amazing! In the end I overdosed on a chocolate cake made with beer and bacon. Need I say more!?

153620,2013-08-27,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Admittedly, out of all the restaurants we planned on visiting during our Las Vegas trip, the one that I was the most excited about was Public House. Public House is a gastropub, serving up refined casual fares and a huge beer selection. It's located in The Venetian on Las Vegas Strip.

Although we had reservations to almost all of the restaurants we dined at, Public House was probably the only restaurant that we actually needed that reservation to get seated, it was bustling with people. Again, the restaurant was beautifully decorated inside and out. Of course it had to be a looker, it was steps away from the Venetian's Grand Canal.

We had the Smothered Prawns, Grilled Octopus, Forest Mushroom, Yukon Potato Puree with Black Truffle Oil and Short Ribs. 

The Smothered Prawns did not have a great deal of flavour, this is what happens when you cook seafood with beer instead of wine... I should have known better! I learned long time ago to always get mussels steamed in a wine broth, not mussels steamed in a beer broth. The Grilled Octopus had a strange texture, it was not springy or chewy, it was... mushy. Yep, the first time I had mushy grilled octopus and we didn't finish this dish. The stars of the meal were the Forest Mushrooms (sauteed mushrooms, what's not to love) and the Yukon Potato Puree (perfectly creamy). The Short Rib all went to the red-meat-eater that I dined with. He enjoyed it, so he says. 

Please check out my blog, where I documented my entire Las Vegas trip. I have photos! ;)

172229,2013-12-21,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"I will start off and say that I think this place is a little overrated on Yelp. I think it deserves three stars at the highest. I just got back from Vegas tonight and stopped by the Public House (based on the reviews here) two days ago. Honestly, it is a bar. That's it. I got the burger which was good but nothing that the Yard House or Portillo's couldn't deliver on. 

The beer selection was diverse but not ton of it on draft. Also, I noticed that each person walking in the door received different options for trying the beer. For example, one couple was offered their ""around the world"" beer tasting when they walked in, I wasn't offered much of anything but the menu, and another group was given other recommendations. Very odd and bad way to introduce the beer -- they need to be consistent to all their customers. Regardless, I tried three different beers in bottles (again, because they didn't have much on draft) and wasn't really impressed.

I definitely won't be going back, not with so many options in Vegas. I heard of another Irish Pub at New York New York that I'll hit up next time. I don't really recommend this place unless you're just looking for something simple and not memorable.",uWHKUnKfjWLpRKWrKaXqfw,0,1,3,tXM6w_oyc5V13OMixKNxhg
203611,2012-10-15,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Overall the experieince was uninspiring.  On the positive side, I enjoyed the use of the iPad for viewing drink options and the beer selection available.  The biggest negative was that the filet I ordered was over-cooked.  In addition, other members of the party also had extremely over-cooked steaks.  For instance, medium-rare steaks coming out well done.  At the price point, you would expect the cooks to execute on the temperature.
The waiter was not very knowledgeable on the beers offered or beer styles.  He also lacked etiquette by taking the tip from the table before we were ready to leave the table (his shift was not over).

230120,2012-05-28,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Amazing beer list? Yes.

But they advertise as a relaxed, 'speakeasy' pub that serves 'pub favourites'-and really, it is anything but that.

The food was very frou frou (if we wanted fine dining-I wouldn't have chosen a 'pub' to eat at). The serving size was ridiculously small-and usually when it's a small serving it's packed with flavour...nope, not here. Small, over-priced, NON-PUB food. 
I had the 'rib'. The serving of 'rib' was the size of 3 fingers and half of the rib was fat. The rib was accompanied with 2 small, cold onion rings (with very little flavour) and 3tablespoons of sweet peas that were pureed. I ordered this based on server recommended, and at $29 I was left with extremely bland and mostly inedible small servings of food. My dining guest was served the wrong beer-and the mistake was not corrected. 

There was no sign of the beer cicerone that they advertise. And the server provided very little knowledge about the beer.

Overall, we came for the beer and the fun twist on 'pub food' that they advertise. We felt completely let down with both (other than the selection of beer)",d9WzVrcxQJWO5mOZw5OkkQ,0,0,1,709xXfVYRImMz4ncmB1f4A

263114,2013-01-06,1,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"There are MANY great things I can say about this establishment..afterall it is owned and operated by Block 16 Hospitality. Same people who brought you Holstein's @Cosmo, Pink's @Planet Hollywood, The Barrymore @The Royal Resort, and the list goes on..(hopefully it will keep expanding, cause they know food :)

I went the day after New Year's because I felt like eating a steak. (Gotta' start the New Year off with one, I mean I survived the whole 'end of the world' thing).. I sat in the cocktail lounge, Lorelei, was my server. She was very friendly, attentive, and made me feel special. I started out with some appetizers. I had the burrata cheese and the devils on horseback. The burrata cheese was beautifully crafted. It consisted of burrata cheese (an Italian cheese; mozzarella and creme), tomatillo sauce, chicharones, and grilled nopales. Yes, you read right, grilled cactus. 

The dish was great to start out with. I grabbed a pork rind and dove right into the cheese and mixed it with the sauce and cactus. It was different, and different is GOOD, let me tell you. Complex flavors of creamy cheese, cactus and the sauce was amazing! Have it with a Stella and you'll see for yourself. Then I moved on to the devils. Dates stuffed with Roquefort blue cheese, wrapped in applewood smoked bacon. The whole salty, sweet thing going on. Obviously, they are light years ahead of the competiton ;)

After I finished my apps, I was ready to order my steak. I heard this place cooks up one hefty steak, so I decided to see if the legend was true.. Lorelei told me that there was a special going on. A veal chop with asparagus, king crab legs, and bearnaise on the side. I'm allergic to shellfish and I asked if she could replace the crab with someone else. She smiled, and took care of it right away. While waiting on my entree, I looked around and noticed how happy the table next to me was with their meal so I knew I was in for a treat. 

Out comes my entree. She told me the chef put a potato puree under the chop because of my allergy to the crab and even a lil bit more asparagus, this made me happy! I poured my bearnaise on my chop and got to diggin' in. I couldn't even finish my meal because it was so good. It's very rare to find a place that cooks up a meal so good that it has that effect. The Veal itself was tender, juicy, full of flavor. The asparagus' taste was fresh, and the bearnaise really kicked it up a notch! This was a great dining experience to bring in the new year. Very clean, very relaxed, and the atmosphere makes YOU feel like you're not in Vegas but in a paradise of fine booze and food. 

Oh, dont let me forget the dessert! It was a special dessert. I had smoked vanilla bean profiteroles w/ espresso chocolate sauce and Deschutte's Black Butte Porter marshmallows.  Very light, not too heavy. But so damn good, made my mouth have an orgasm...

If you come to Vegas, please dont overlook this place. And the people who gave negative reviews, they dont know GOOD food. So forget about it! Cheers!",aLloBzGkAtxiG7NxZoWMXQ,1,1,5,pdK8GlYeSnIb3lM8GJGrww

They have a fairly extensive beer selection.  With such a large selection, they have sampler selections that would allow you to try different beers without getting too blitzed.

From the ""Butcher Block"" tried the Jamon Serrano and the Rabbit Loin in Porcetta.  Serrano ham was good, not too salty.  The Rabbit/Porcetta was flavorful and moist.
Tried three cheeses from the ""Cheese Shop""  Don't remember all but do remember the Roquefort Blue.  Mild for a blue cheese which is a good thing.  Accompanied the two dishes were toast points, jam, and grain mustard.

The short ribs were dry, crispy frog legs were good, poutine was the best of the three.  What's not good about fries covered in gravy, cheese curds, and duck confit.

Despite the hustle and bustle of the Venetian and the general popularity of The Grand Canal Shoppes the area surrounding Public House is very calm. Something tells me that's the way the owners like it.

When you walk into the restaurant you'll find a bar and tvs to your left. While straight ahead you'll be greeted by one of the many (there were three when we showed up) hostesses on staff. 

When you walk in you might be so taken with the beauty of the hostesses that you won't take the time to look at your surroundings. Public House is adorned in dark wood, calming atmosphere. It reminds me of old school steakhouses. Everything about the place just seemed subdued, making it an ideal atmosphere to take your lady for an intimate dinner before the rowdiness that are Vegas clubs. 

Once you get seated you get to take a look at the menus. Public House is noted for it's beer and wine selection. While they do have a wine list, they will bring the staff sommelier by to answer any questions you might have about the wine selection. If beer is what you have a taste for they do have a pretty decent selection for you to peruse. The biggest downside to the beer menu is that it is on an iPad. This is fine if your party is 2 people, not so fun when you have 8. 

The menu is typical of an American upscale restaurant. Yes, it's expensive. You're at the Venetian, on the strip, in Vegas. You're going to make it rain for dinner whether you want to or not. 

My party ran the gauntlet of what Public House had to offer. The chicken wing were tossed in a spicy but tasty chill glaze. The bone marrow was large with a taste to back it up. I had never had poutine fries before but they made me a believer. 

At this point you're probably wondering why I'm giving Public House 3 stars (ordering beer off an iPad can't be that bad right?). Sadly, not all the entrees lived up to the rest of the experience. 

I personally had the fried chicken. The  waiter said it was the best in Vegas. As a matter of fact every employee who came by said it was the best they had ever had.  When the waiter came and dropped of my plate he whispered ""You're going to love this."" Not so much... For me the skin wasn't all that crispy and lacked flavor. For my buddy sitting across the table from me, it was just too dry. Many in our party had the burger. I think one finished it. All complained that it was overly greasy. I know I know it's a burger, but you expect more out of a place this upscale. 

The steaks and shellfish platters were well done. My friends gave them rave reviews and left the rest of us jealous. 

The service was ok. Nothing to complain about, but nothing memorable. 

Overall, I think this is a nice place to eat. If you're in a small party and  stick to the entrees in the center of the menu you will have a fantastic time and eat some amazing food. Otherwise, you're in for an average dinner experience.",M5WgW6XYNu3U1oktXfZTcQ,1,0,3,BJoo25FYZPJJv7eBZtUDRA

We went without reservations probably around 7 or 7:30 on a Saturday night and were seated right away.  Although by the time we left the place had mostly filled out. Our sever was very helpful and the the beer we ended up with was fantastic. They had a great beer selection that was listed on an iPad for the table to look over. We sat in the dining area but the bar looked great as well. The atmosphere was laid back, quiet enough and like dining in some eclectic, rich guy's library. Lots of leather, wood surfaces and because it is Vegas, good lighting. 

As for the food, we ordered several plates to share and ended up with poutine(so wonderfully unhealthy and greasy), chilled prawns, house pickles, roquefort cheese and the Soup du Jour which in my opinion was the best thing we ordered. It was a curried carrot soup made with coconut milk and oh my goodness was it tasty. Very, very difficult not to lick the bowl on that one. Desserts sounded great but we ended up passing.

995404,2014-03-18,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Based on the other reviews my wife and I decided to try Public House for dinner this past weekend.  While the quality of the food was okay, the service warrants this low rating.  I would probably give the food 3-3.5 stars.  The poutine was okay, the ""Belgian"" beer flight overpriced and mediocre at best (and our server was unable to recall the styles of the four beers on the paddle), my burger was overcooked but my wife liked her salmon.

The issue with our night started with the third person in our party, our friend had order a medium rare filet.  Immediately upon cutting into it, it was clear it wasn't mid rare, definitely closer to well or mid well.  The waiter apologized, took the steak back and informed us that he would bring her out a new steak as quickly as possible.  Five minutes later he came back, not with the new steak, but to inform us that the manager wanted to speak with us.  Another five minutes later and the manager comes to our table to tell us that a new steak will be out for her (but no apology or offer to comp).  By now ten minutes have passed, my wife and I are waiting for our friend's meal to arrive so we can start to eat ours.  Another twenty minutes pass and a medium rare filet is finally brought out to the table.  It really shouldn't take 30 minutes to prepare a medium rare filet.  What compounded the issue is the lack of service during that time and the weak offer of a dessert to compensate for the loss of time (I can't fault them for our decision to not start eating our entrees until our friend had her's.)  When we declined the dessert, the waiter offered to comp the poutine.

When we received the bill, nothing was discounted.  We had been charged for the poutine and there was no discount on the bill.  Ultimately we asked to speak with the manager directly about the issue, and the filet was comped.

I'm not in Vegas often enough to overlook poor service.  With the quantity of choices available, I don't see a reason to ever waste my time at this establishment again.",OmC4vc0YTAhymJoaZCy3MQ,1,0,1,5nRFOMG3oHsUnZTMey5gUw

I'm a fan of the sister restaurants of PB so i have high expectations.

Sat at the bar and started with a draft Sierra Nevada IPA.  Nice start

Ordered grilled Octopus ($16??)and the pub burger($19??)

I was kinda surprised by the menu - a little more upscale than i expected.

The Octopus came out quickly.  At the base was a mix of chopped grilled veggies and what i thought was barley but after tasting, it was some sort of pasta.  The octopus was perfectly grilled and tender.  My only ding - more octopus please !

Prior to getting the burger, beer #2 - dang if i know what it was but it had a citrus-y taste with a slight pine taste - refreshing.  The cool bartender gave me a taster of another beer with a bolder flavor he felt would work better with the burger.

The burger ?  Perfectly cooked but needed a little more salt. Loved the bacon marmalade.  The roast tomato did not work for me - felt like i was eating a large, stewed tomato - after one bite i removed it ...betta !  And the bartenders beer pick was perfect ( yet again, Mr. Genius did not get the name !)

The poutine fries with the sour beer gravy, cheese curds, tender pulled duck, and a fried egg on top was still to die for. The cheese curds were so delicious that my friend saved the soft pillows left in our plate for the fries that were coming with her lobster roll. However, that was the only dish that lived up to my memories. Everything else was lackluster at best, must have been the alcohol coursing through my system that skewed my judgment. This time around I got the fisherman's stew. It was too salty for my taste and the fishy seafood taste overpowered the tomato base. Rather than a stew it felt more like an oily sauce that covered soft pieces of sea bass, mussels, shrimp, and lobster. I can't deny that the seafood was cooked nicely and nothing had the texture of a rubber shoe but you're better off going with one of their sandwiches, such as the lobster roll, that's more worth it for the price tag. My friend got the roast chicken hoping that it would blow her away. She even said,""I'm going to be that girl that orders the chicken because at these places you never think it would be good because it's so basic but it will be good!""

We had a group of 8 coming for a bachelorette party and they accommodated us so well! I made the reservation long before the trip, so I was sure that they would be ready for us. Little did I know that they would offer us a private room for our party.  If you've read my other reviews from this trip, you'll notice that I call our group ""indecisive"" and that they needed some guidance overall. This can be pretty difficult for servers and I always feel bad whenever a large group of people isn't really answering or is being a little frustrating for servers. Everyone here was SUPER patient with us and I seriously commend them for that. 

The food was also INCREDIBLE. I had the beef short rib and it was SO delicious. I was so sad that I couldn't clean my plate just for more of that melty and amazing beef. The cheese board was also super tasty and a perfect appetizer for the whole group. I'll definitely go back given the opportunity.",i6nzTfZ8TRckJOGgZIpr5Q,0,0,5,8_Jg3xfcX94mcM2xuVaS5A

So thankful for Yelp when traveling. We were able to find this place and give it a try and just fell in love. The drink and food menus are quite impressive.

Our waitress Gina was awesome!!! We sat ourselves in the bar area facing the entrance and walk way by Blue man Group. So we were in a great spot for people watching.

I am not really a drinker so I always order what I know and this time my husband asked for recommendations...and I am so glad he did! Gina recommended the MC-11 and boy was it yummy! I think I had like 3 of them...2 at dinner and 1 to go! Gotta love Vegas!

We ordered:

Poutine-French Fries with Duck and cheese curd
Devils on Horseback-Blue cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon

Food 5 stars
Beer and Cocktails 5 stars
Service 5 stars (Gina Rocked!)

We had a Groupon for here and before actually buying it, I was fervently going through the menu to make sure it was money well spent. Yep, definitely was. Just looking at the menu, I wished I could use more of the Groupons at once because everything on their menu sounded so good! 

All of the waiters looked like gentlemens with their blazers and ties. It was a nice touch and it goes well with the decor. It's an intimate setting and the music wasn't too loud. Our waiter was very knowledgeable with the beers and helpful when we were choosing a beer. The bf had the Ommegang Witte which was light and had a very nice citrus aftertaste. I had the Funny Man and I really liked it. But for $12, I felt it could have been a bit stronger.

As for food, wee decided to get the poutine, bone marrow, and jamon serrano to start with. You have no idea how excited we were for the poutine. As soon as we saw the waiter walking towards us, our forks were in hand. When the plate landed on the table, it was every man for himself. It was GOOD. Although after eating half of it, it did get a tad salty, but that plate was licked clean. Then the bone marrow. That had to be the star of the night. The bread was perfectly grilled and that bacon marmalade gave each bite of bone marrow and beautiful sweetness. The bone marrow was easy to scoop out of the bones and super delicious. It was very oily though and once you take a bite, if you had chapped lips coming in, you won't have them once you're done. The jamon serrano was good but isn't much to write about.

We shared the scallops as an entree too and the scallops were cooked very well and the oxtail stew underneath it had a nice red wine flavor that wasn't overpowering. The matchstick potatoes also added a much needed crunch to eat bite.

At the end, the mustachioed man came over and settled our tab with the Groupon and I can see why he's known for his mustache. Pretty wicked. Definitely a friendly guy and he seemed to be visiting many tables throughout the night.

One weird thing for me was that there weren't any toilet seat covers in the bathroom. Not that they ran out, but there's no dispenser in the first place. May not bother most people, but I guess I'm a bit of a germaphob.

My brother had the burger which he really enjoyed (even though he basically stripped of all it's uniqueness - removing the bacon marmalade, frisee lettuce, roasted tomato and Guinness aioli and replacing it with pickles, iceberg and yellow mustard! I ordered the duck confit poutine and the roasted bone marrow - clearly I got all the foodie DNA in the family!

I was very excited about the poutine, only to be very disappointed to find it so salty that it couldn't be eaten. I tried my brother's fries and they were delicious and not overly salted; I think the gravy that topped the poutine was the culprit.  The server graciously removed it from the table and the bill.

The bone marrow, on the other hand, was just pure heaven.  My life is now broken up into 2 sections: Before Roasted Bone Marrow and After Roasted Bone Marrow.  Holy cow. (Bahahahaha!)  It's basically meat butter.  Creamy, gooey, marrow, crunchy bread and salty bacon marmalade are a match made in heaven.

We didn't have reservations and we just waltzed in and got seated pretty quickly. The restaurant was one of those cool gastropubs which is a nice break from all the other fancy restaurants at Venetian.  A really good casual restaurant for a quick lunch or casual dinner.  When you walk in, the restaurant is dimly lit.  I really liked the feel of the restaurant.  Casual and nothing too fancy.  A good place to hang out with friends and drink before a wild night out. 

When we got the menu, the one thing that pleasantly surprised me was the how decently priced everything was. Especially for Vegas standard.  AND the food was good! Whaaat??! But the one thing that really sold me was the vast amount of beer they served and they're only $7-8.  

We ordered an array of food.  From the bone marrow to the poutine, I enjoyed it all! Very good food.  The BF ordered the pub burger which he really enjoyed. My favorite in the restaurant was definitely the mussels and clams. SOOO delicious! The broth had a good flavor that by the time I was finished with all the seafood I was dipping anything that I could find in it. Bread, fries, you name it, I tried it.

He recommended that I instead get their shortribs, as they are cooked to well done, but are much more tender than a steak would be. I am so glad he recommended them. They were absolutely amazing, and in a very tasty sweet/sticky, almost teriyaki-like sauce (but better). I am not big on butternut squash, so they substituted fries for me. My husband got some sort of seafood platter that was meant to be an appetizer for a group of people, but he instead got it as a dinner for himself. He really enjoyed everything on it.

The decor was very nice.  Dark wood, nice booths, upscale pub feel.  

Service was good.  Our waiter was pleasant and informative.   

Food & Drinks - this is where things start going downhill.  The spirits menu is presented in digital form.  That's pretty cool.  I flipped to the Reserve Beer section and spied a Brooklyn Black OPS!  Always wanted to try one so placed the order.  Waiter comes back to the table and says sorry, that one sold out within 10 days of being on the menu.  I'm disappointed, but quickly get over it when I see they also have Firestone Walker Parabola!  One of my favorites - so placed that order next.  Waiter slinks back to the table telling me that it is sold out as well.  Oh well, they still had some other limited bottles and I settled on a FW Sucaba.  So not a total failure, just wish they would keep their menu up to date.   

Next, I asked our waiter if the Onion Rings were hand battered and were told that they were.  I ordered the Pub Burger and onion rings.  When the food arrived, I had soggy french fries, but no onion rings.  The server put the dishes down and ran off before I even had a chance to call out the mistake.  Finally flagged down a server and told them about the onion rings.  When then finally came out, they were hot, but weren't anything special.  Also, the Pub burger was a little above average, but was not as good as the one I had over at Buddy V's.  Finally, the water smelled and tasted horrible.  I don't know if they don't filter it or what, but never had a bad water experience at any other restaurant in The Venetian/Palazzo.

I liked that they didn't overdo it on the mayo because that can quickly make you feel like the lobster is a supporting character in the dish. The french fries were cooked nicely here.

I jumped ahead to the entree when I forgot to mention the pork belly appetizer. It sat atop a piece of bread (the name of that small piece of toast escapes me at the moment) and you're supposed to break the poached egg on top. It was good but nothing I would have to get again.

The quality of the food and the customer service and satisfaction attitude of the manager.  We were a dinner party of three.  What were the food quality issues, you ask?  One of our guests was served a ""shrimp cocktail"", that consisted of 3 medium-sized shrimp for the mere price of $18.  The shrimp were literally slimey feeling and had NOT been cleaned of their intestinal tract.  We sent the cocktail back - only to be later told by our waiter that ""the chef saw nothing wrong with the shrimp"".  Then, two of our guests were later served ""prime"" rib steaks, in which there was so much fat (like, multiple ounces of solid fat) that it was unbelievable.  And, the steaks were both so tough that the steak knives would literally not slice the steaks even on the cap end.  After asking for the manager, I explained (and demonstrated) the problems with the steak.  At no time did he offer ANY apologies for the quality.  So, we asked for our check, paid our bill, and went elsewhere for dinner.  This restaurant has at least three major problems: (1) A manager that cares about customer service and satisfaction; (2) A chef that cares about the quality of their profession; and, (3) The quality of the food product that is being purchased.

After we sat down, we were informed that it was their opening night. This immediately made me a little wary, as I don't usually frequent restaurants until they've stretched their sea legs a bit. We had briefly glanced at the menu before entering, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the lamb-filled pierogies. As someone of Greek and Polish descent, this was like music to my soul... er... stomach. As I said, it was their opening night and management was palpably nervous, overeager, and ready to please. Our waiter must have come over three or four times to check if everything was OK, and the owner of the restaurant came over for a good-sized chat right after we ordered and again for a moment as we were eating. Strangely, the waiters made laps around the restaurant, quite unnecessarily, it appeared. For example, my husband finished his wine and the waiter picked up his empty wine glass, walked around the restaurant a few times, and then carried it into the kitchen. I watched several full, untouched plates of food go in and out of the kitchen... for inspections, perhaps? I am not well-versed in culinary protocol, but this just looked flat out odd. The busboys wear navy blue polo shirts, and for the price of this restaurant, we felt as if they should be dressed a little more formally. The waiters wear shirts, ties, and jackets, but (and this was REALLY weird) the girls flounce around in white t-shirts, plaid boxer shorts, and knee highs...?!?  It was like Scottish lassies meets well-dressed gentlemen, with a very french décor and style of thatched wine racks everywhere and flat panel TVs. Nothing ""matched."" 

My husband's hanger steak was excellent, and the pierogies were absolutely out of this world. The mashed potatoes are on the plate, with the pierogies stuffed only with lamb and resting atop the potatoes. Lamb au jus is pooled around the entire plate. YUM!!!  For dessert, we tried the chocolate cake and the sticky toffee pudding, both excellent. The chocolate cake had clusters of Rice Crispies and bacon. I am drooling just thinking about the food. For the food, 10 stars out of five. For service and décor, 2 stars. The music was entirely too loud to have any decent conversation with your company. The waiter accidentally charged us for an entire bottle of Qube, but we only had one glass. Etiquette would usually dictate that the entire glass is removed from the check due to the error, but he simply fixed it and said, ""OK, now you've just been charged for the one glass."" If he had removed the charge entirely, we would have tipped on the price of the one glass of wine in addition to the food, but because he didn't, we left a 10% tip.

Does anyone really think I'm not giving this place 5 stars?  

Let me make something clear.  Even though everything here presents as a huge win, the food really was the star of the show.  Unlike Marilyn's and Earl of Sandwich, this place blew away my rather meager expectations.  Here is what we ordered:

BUTCHER BLOCK (3 items - $24): the potted duck rillettes appear to be heavily doused in delightful black truffle and were an absolutely divine treat, the rabbit loin in porchetta basically melted in the mouth, and the sopresatta had a nice, delicate spicy kick.  Grade: A  

POUTINE ($12.50): Someone who complained about this dish in another review stated that it was too rich.  Umm.... you ordered poutine!  What did you expect?  There were nice, fresh husks of duck confit throughout the dish and the cheese curd ""gravy"" added another layer of richness.  We added the fried egg to complete the full on massacre of the heart.  Grade: A-  

GRILLED OCTOPUS ($16): Personally, I thought the actual octopus was cooked perfectly; specifically, there was none of that awful chewiness one finds when people overcook the delicate meat.  The accompaniments that came with the dish were admittedly boring though.  Grade: B+

TRUFFLE ARINCINIS ($7): Basically, this is fried risotto balls in a decadent cheese sauce.  I only got hints of the truffle.  Grade: B-

BOSTON BIBB ($13): This was a nice refreshing counter-dish to all of our rich orders.  The classic Bibb is finished with champagne vinaigrette and studded with deliciously flavorful tomatoes.  Grade: B

ROASTED BONE MARROW ($15): Standing alone, the bone marrow is nice and delicate, but seemed to be missing something.  Then I tried it with the accompanying bacon marmalade.  Wow.  Again, this kitchen understands their pairings very well.  You don't expect that out of a gastropub.  Or at least I don't.  This was excellent.  Grade: A-

BOUCHOT MUSSELS ($14): The mussels were nice and light, but I wish they were more plump.  The accompanying sauce base was a decadent mix of four of my favorite ingredients in the world: Belgian beer, creme fraiche, bacon, and shallots.  Grade: A

POTTED FARM EGG ($14): This fondue heavy dish was incredibly rich in the most perfect manner.  I liked the addition of asparagus, but I'm beginning to think we ate it wrong because we are convinced we found two tiny spoons within the dish.  Despite our apparent lack of intellect, this was masterful.  Grade: A

Bartender ""Bozo"" was very fun and sociable without invading my quiet, personal lunchtime. Without asking, he read my mind and offered some horseradish for my shrimp cocktail. Perfect service. 

The location is kind of in a passageway between the Palazzo and the Venetian, yet still felt comfortable enough for a casual bite. 

I had the pub burger for my main and it was great - giant patty, caramelized onions and delicious toppings that I can't quite remember. The fries were good but a little on the non-crispy side.

Their sister restaurant is Holstein's at Cosmopolitan - which is one of my other favorite restaurants in Vegas. 

To top off my good experience, Bozo had asked where I'm from. I said I'm from Las Vegas. 20% discount for locals!

Will definitely stop by again and try more of their menu.",AQZs-bWSNxrhXms7zbQ-ew,0,0,4,rjuKDlx-97hnFkiEz20qOg

Some of the flights they put together are incredible, and have turned me on to several new brews and breweries.

After ordering drinks, our waiter disappeared. We finally had to ask another waiter to send him over so we could order food. If only we had known, we would have stopped after ordering beer...

We started with the ""Devils on Horseback"" (bacon-wrapped dates) and they were shameful and bland. You want a real bacon-wrapped date? Head over to La Cave inside Wynn next door. 

I had high hopes for the mussels since they came highly recommended from the staff, however those hopes were dashed. They came in a giant pot (not good for sharing, even though our waiter said they were...) and were also tasteless.

We stopped ordering after that since the food was so disappointing. We ended up having Dinner Part 2 later on that evening since we were still hungry after leaving Public House.

I treated the menu like it was tapas style. I could eat a dozen bacon wrapped dates, perfect sized sweet and salty morsels. I also opted for the quail on a bed of swiss chard and bacon and waffles, a spin on chicken on waffles. I needed a little more meat on the bones to make up for all the gluttony.

Also I totally understand taking a card to start a tab in the bar area, but when I ask for the check, please ask if I want you to charge my card.

Public House has a fun gastropub setting that provides an eclectic menu.  The atmosphere is fun.  The decor is a great mix of modern with rustic.  There is a large dining area with the wine 'shelter' along the back wall.  

Our waitress, Shaina, could have been a little more attentive.  She was very much absent in the majority of our dining experience.  I believe that other employees visited our table more than she did.  I also noticed her enjoying visiting with her coworkers rather than waiting on her tables.  That's unfortunate.

We chose to split an appetizer of beer brined chicken wings and the prime rib french dip.  The chicken wings had a unique and different flare of glaze.  They used a calabrian chili glaze with a house made bleu cheese dressing.  These were good and much different than the usual buffalo chicken wings I'm used to everywhere else.  The wings were good size, juicy and flavorful.  

The Prime Rib French Dip sandwich was also an item I would order again.  It was your normal french dip but they also added firecracker onion straws on top.  Delicious.  The bread was fresh with the wonderful flavors of the horseradish sauce and au jus.  The accompanied french fries could have been cooked a little longer.  They were somewhat on the soggy side.

Just good old fashioned paper menus would be fine....seems like every restaurant is doing this iPad menu now..ugh.

Also regarding beers...the cicerone should aim the beers more in an area where your palette doesn't tire. His recommendations and style seems more heavily laying in barley wine sweeter ales...and leaving so many holes open for crispy IPAs and great pilsners....take a note from the Stone Brewing menu in Escondido CA : they have SO many hard to get 'craft independent' beers it makes it a pleasure to TRY to pick out a beer....still have to respect the Yard House.

There are so many options just on this property and The Public House has been on the list, but we tend to stray elsewhere.  After some disappointing meals at places like Delmonico and B&B Ristorante, we wanted something that had a series of good reviews, so we tried it.

Ashley, our server was excellent.  She was personable, quick with a smile and our orders, but most importantly she knew the menu and was able to discuss the options.  The drink menu is much more than just the beer selections.  They have an equally impressive wine and cocktail menu.  It was a Friday, so not too busy, but there was a mixture of clientele.  Anywhere from the early 30's guys at the bar, to the suits in the booths, to the tourists like ourselves.  It is a mixture.

My wife found her favorite Paso Robles winery on the list (Tobin James), so it made sense to have a meat and cheese board for lunch.  The toasty bread and brie cheese were very good.  The prosciutto was the best we have had, but the potted duck rillettes was extraordinary.  Make sure you skim the fat off the top of the jar, which leaves you with a mixture of potted duck meat and sweet cherries.  The sweet and savory flavor, along with the texture was something I have never tasted before and was delicious.  I am a crude beer guy, but pairing the bite with a taste of her zinfandel took it to an even higher level.

I ordered the Scottish salmon with artichoke risotto and have to say it was one of the best dishes that I have ever had.  The salmon basically melted as soon as I put it in my mouth.  It was flaky and lite, with the added textural pop of the crispy skin.  The artichoke risotto was creamy and a perfect accompaniment to the fish.  I have had a similar dish at other restaurants and this was far and away the best.  Now that Puck has closed his restaurant at the Venetian, the Public House will be our ""Go-To"" when wanting a great meal under $100.00.

Here is a tip if you want to try them! If you come in one afternoon and spend $600 on drinks and appetizers while seated in their exclusive ""entrees"" only dining area ... count your blessings!

Even when the area is empty for hours they usually force you to sit in the drinks and appetizers only section!

I understand keeping seats available for dinner guest but their application of the idea is totally messed up.

When the house is empty and seven people want to sit in normal damn chairs, have apps and drinks ... ""Accommodate them!""

Good portion size - not over stuffed, but definitely didn't leave hungry.

For dinner, I asked the server to choose for me between the Pub Burger and the Scottish Salmon, and she told me to order the Pub Burger, and add avocado, bacon and a fried egg.

Walked in, the decor was nice and they had a great beer list, but the place lacked a certain warmth you usually find in a gastropub...

We sat at the bar when the place was empty around lunchtime on a weekday, and immediately the bartender (who looked about 10 years younger than me) aggressively IDs me - but not the people I was with. I get it, I'm a woman, maybe you want to flatter me. But Honey, I'm 35, and while it's cool to ID someone, there is a certain decorum when IDing. 

This bartender went on to be cool and unfriendly the duration of the experience. Food was ok - 3 stars but nothing to write home about, but they really have some nerve charging $10 extra to put TWO SHRIMP on a salad as the ""protein."" 

Overall, this place is better than the slop at the buffets and most of the other ""celeb chef"" haunts around Vegas, but could not make it in NYC where there are better options for good food/beer, at much more reasonable prices.",OrZl_zQZDt40lnENm1JUaA,1,0,2,YOSfh89M6aCfNJ1LDKkBMw

Most places that serve roasted bone marrow have issues with the marrow being skimpy or stuck to the bone so you can't get it all.  Public House blanches it first so you get all of it, and it's juicy and generous.  Plus, bacon marmalade.  Sounds gross, I know, but trust me.  It works perfectly with this dish.

The Welsh Rarebit is also a requirement.  This is basically cheese toast, but done with such awesome cheeses and herbs that it's a delicious, savory pub appetizer.  Four generous slices.

The lunch sandwiches are a great deal, and the Prime Rib French Dip is fabulous.  Meaty, tender, and awesome in every way.  I was sober when I had mine, but it would be perfect hangover food.  The jus provided is actual beef juice and not bullion cubes in water.

I highly recommend the $2 onion rings upgrade.  They are battered onion rings and they are crisp and hot, not at all soggy like some places.

On another night there I had the Alaskan Halibut dinner entree.  It is not a huge amount of food, but still an excellent portion for $30, and served on top of a small bed of risotto that is delicious.

Cask beer
 - Reading the menu made the Cask beer sound interesting and at 9 dollars it wasnt too bad. The beer of the day was called.....umm...cask beer...hell i barely knew what i was ordering. When the glass came i noticed the foam wasnt from carbonation but was from pouring. Initial taste was light and fruity and the follow up was of a dark beer. No surprise considering it was a darker beer. I took a sip Anthony M took a sip and we looked at each other. Then i said...LYCHEE BEER!! yeah it had a fruity aroma to it with some sweetness that tasted like lychees. 

Poutine
 - I've never had poutine before. I've only heard of poutines through EPIC MEAL TIME!! so what i was expecting was already warped by internet bacon. What came out was a classier version and not as heavy or as...umm...drenched as what i was expecting. The fries were EXCELLENT even without the cheese curds or gravy or duck the fries themselves were EXCELLENT. The dish was nicely balanced but could have used a bit less salt.

Pub Burger
 - After a few trips to Bachi Burger i was pretty damn sure i'd never truely enjoy another burger that wasnt from Bachi. Now i'm ready to revise that. For 'Fusion' Burgers Bachi still holds a special place in my heart through the form of cholesterol in one of my arteries and might kill me one of these days but oh well totally worth it. The Pub Burger is possibly one of the best american style burgers i've had in a while. The roasted tomatoes just add another layer of depth and flavors through it's sweetness and the gruyere cheese just blended nicely with the meat patty. Awesome totally awesome.

For the most part i try not to eat on the strip or at casinos very often as i prefer to support local businesses and stick to the more sane experience of dinning off the strip.

Public House was pretty empty and we easily got a table. We started off all with the free draft beer with the Yelp checkin (thanks!) and an order of Duck Poutine and wings. They have a decent selection of beer but wanted stomach space for my burger... 

Duck Poutine (4.5 stars):
First off, this is a pretty substantial poutine. We had 6 people and while yes, I wanted more, I thought it was more than enough to get your taste buds started. The fries were extra crispy and extremely flavorful. They came out nice and hot and the gravy was poured on after it arrived at the table. Every component was delicious though I wish there had been more gravy and there was a bit too much fat at the bottom of the dish when we got there... but hey, you're eating fries, they're not going to be the healthiest thing lol. 

Pub burger (4 stars):
Everyone in our group ordered some variation of the burger... but it ended up being a great idea. The burger is pretty substantial and you can pay extra for bacon, avocado, and mushrooms. I actually though it was great as is though my medium rare came out a tad more rare than I would have liked. The patty was flavorful and moist though a tad salty for me. The burger comes with a side of fries (same ones as the poutine) so I ended up not finishing though because I had already had quite a few. Regardless, they were still delicious. Much like the poutine, the burger was bigger than expected and only 2 in our party actually finished their burger. We definitely all walked out fully satiated. 

Chicken Wings (2.5 stars):
Not that memorable. Came with 6 wings for $15. I suppose they were good enough but definitely could have passed to save more space for the poutine and burger.

It's always nice to start out in Vegas with a bang. And while that statement has so many salacious and insidious connotations here, for our group it meant hitting up one of the places I was most looking forward to for this trip to Sin City. I actually first heard of Public House when I was trying to find anywhere in Vegas that served a good variety of craft/specialty beers, and then subsequently read heavily lauded reviews from Ashley H and Venu N, which only cemented the fact that it would be a must upon arrival.

It's tucked way back in the recesses of The Venetian, and may take a bit of exploring to find, especially since it's one of the more ""normal"" looking restaurants you'll spot in a Vegas casino, from the outside. Inside though, the place definitely has a unique charm. As mentioned by Venu, the bathroom humor here is some of the best I've ever seen. Unfortunately for me my digital camera memory card died about a week after my Vegas trip ended, completely wiping all the photos I had taken (and idiotically not yet transferred to my laptop), so you'll only be privy (no pun intended) to the one gem I recall reading, just above the men's urinal: ""Stand a little closer, it's smaller than you think.""

Vidal, Julie, Zack, and I all set down and started drinking as soon as we had gone through the 100 or so beers on the very nifty iPad like tablet they use here, while we waited on Brian to arrive and join us. Unfortunately I had lured everyone here with the promise of beautiful women, and while there were a few cute hostesses, our waiter turned out to more closely resemble Humpty Dumpty (which, ironically, was a fascination of former restaurateur David Burke, who used to occupy this space), and their cicerone (akin to a sommelier, for beer) someone who had retired from his former life as a circus ring master. Both were quite nice, indeed, but my mates hopes were far from fulfilled. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment of the night came when, on multiple occasions, their cicerone poured our beers much like someone on their first shift at an average sports bar would, causing head to flow over all down the glass and on the table. This is something I expect from Uncle Buck, not someone with a professional certification in beer service. As for the list itself, it's pretty good, with about 100 bottles to choose from, all pretty fairly priced (I went with the Trappistes ""Rochefort 10"" at $16 and the Firestone Walker ""Wookey Jack"" Black Rye IPA at $25 for a 22oz) and nicely arranged by style. I was hoping to see a few more really rare finds, similar to the elite class of beer bars, but that was mostly missing here. There is high quality stuff to be sure, but most of it can be found at any of the mid-tier beer bars around the country. Compared to the virtual (and literal) desert that is the Vegas beer bar scene though, this is at the mountain top by a mile.

The food turned out to be quite good as well, although I think we would have been wiser to follow some of the previous diners' examples and stick with multiple shared medium plates rather than the entrée dishes. My beer braised short rib and IPA battered onion rings were great, and the sweet pea puree was certainly novel, if not distracting, but I don't think the pork loin, pub burger, or pappardelle quite pleased my friends as much, and after a few bites of each I concurred that while they were solid, they weren't up to the same level. The Welsh rarebit was a massive disappointment that I do not recommend, and the poutine was great (to me), although my friends found it extremely salty, and technically I think it's more like disco fries with duck confit on top, rather than actual poutine. Either way I agree with all the other recommendations to absolutely order this dish (just know it's an ass kicker).",hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA,12,11,4,2Wuv2qZIQK5dywx6uN2a2A

The beer selection was definitely meh. I cannot believe the prices they are charging for beer either. I asked for a bottle of FW Sucaba, and they told me $45. $45?!?!?! Damn, that is one helluva markup! I understand it's Vegas and all, but there is no real reason to have a CERTIFIED CICCERONE and serve subpar shelf beers. I ended up drinking a Moscow Mule since none of the beers on tap interested me.

We shared a few apps, but the highlight of the place was the Poutine... absolutely fantastic! I'd come here again for that, and have water with it.

The positives were that they honored our reservations & sat us promptly, and they processed our room charge quickly.

Now the not so positives:
- our server was off his game - we saw him once after our meal was provided & right before our check was given to us
- this meant that we were not only thirsty for more adult beverages but also for water
- the kitchen must have been short handed because our food only took an hour to get to our tables & that was was just for the apps
- the quality of the food was bad AND poor value for what you get - shrimp cocktail was definitely shrimp in size however the cocktail sauce was nice; the ahi poke was way too too too salty; the oysters tasted bad/rotten & we'll find out how right we are in a few hours time to see if we get food poisoning; the NY strip was tough for it being done medium though it had good flavoring and the sea bass was not cooked through

I would definitely go for the children's chicken fingers meal - the kids from the next table over from us were too cute & they decided to share their meals bc they needed help to finish their dinners.

I made reservations on Open Table but it wasn't really necessary for the time of year. We were the only ones dining. 

The main reason I wanted to try Public House was for the duck Poutine. For those of you who don't know what Poutine is, it's fries with gravy and cheese curds on it. Public House puts duck confit on them as well. OMG it lived up to expectations. So delicious! Portion size was pretty generous for the two of us. We couldn't finish it. I could definitely have just eaten the Poutine as my entree. We also split a French dip sandwich which was excellent. There was so much meat in the sandwich I could barely bite it.

I got the short rib and bone marrow, and got to taste the foie gras and poutine. The short rib was ridiculous. Braised to tender melted collagen perfection while retaining its beefy flavor. It went perfectly with the creamy potato puree it was served with. The roasted bone marrow with onion marmalade was the ultimate combination of savory and sweet. It was my first time having it and I don't remember how it was prepared, but the foie gras was delicious simply because it is foie gras. The poutine wasn't as impressive as the other dishes (can you even call it poutine without the cheese curds and gravy?).

2400235,2012-03-25,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"So I was researching craft beer bars in advance of a recent business trip to Vegas and was downright giddy when I happened across the recently opened Public House. Seeing that the Vegas Strip has always been a bit of a craft beer (ahem) desert, on paper this seemed to be exactly what the doctor ordered.

I soon arrived in Las Vegas and high-tailed it to Public House immediately after dropping my bags at The Flamingo. I was greeted by a wonderfully attentive and friendly staff at the bar. I must admit that these young and attractive barkeeps had me wondering if they really knew their chops when it came to beer. Next thing I knew I was discussing the comparative qualities of various sour beer varieties with one of the female servers which (somewhat embarrassingly) really impressed me. So I hereby apologize to all young, attractive and female beer geeks out there. I will never prejudge you again!

So the draft and bottle selection was impressive indeed. I started with a cask-conditioned Firestone Walker porter which was quite tasty and truly something I might not ever find elsewhere. Then I took a run down the American/Imperial IPA list enjoying several varieties by Uinta (Hop Notch, yum!), Stone and Lagunitas. All fresh and served in proper glassware (always a nice touch).

Alas it was time for a nosh. Impressive menu and definitely on the high-brow end of what one might expect for ""pub grub"". Then again Public House *is* a gastropub after all and they truly live up with their food offerings. I opted for the scallops over oxtail stew. At $29 I was a little apprehensive when I might have been just as happy with a burger and fries at this point. However, let me tell you that this was one of the most fantastic dishes I've ever enjoyed. The aroma of the huge pan-seared scallops over rich red-wine laced oxtail stew demanded my immediate attention (as well as the attention of several others seated at the bar). I'm a meat and potatoes guy so the somewhat small portion had me a bit concerned, but the richness of this flavor-packed entree reinforced the old adage of 'quality over quantity.' Wow, so very happy after this meal.

Needless to say, I found myself back at Public House several times that week and found myself succumbing to the craving for a second helping of the scallops. Every bit as good the second time! Even better paired with a nice dark porter.

Already looking forward to my next trip to Vegas and specifically Public House! Beer geeks (and foodies) rejoice!",o0p-iTC5yTBV5Yab_7es4g,3,0,5,ctVjU4yURkzKGGjmWOfhtw

I ordered a bottled beer. The waiter placed the beer glass on the table as he opened the beer. I noticed that the glass was dishwasher hot. How that escaped the attention of the waiter is beyond me. I asked that he swap out the hot glass with a cold one.

We started with a beet and endive salad to share. We received a small plate containing 5 slices of a beet and a few dime sized slivers of endive. All this for the absurdly high price of $13. We voiced our discontent to our usually helpful waiter. The manager brought over another smaller plate containing more endive, but no beets.

For our entrees my guest selected their Scottish salmon ($26) and I ordered a Pub Burger ($19).

Instead of fries I asked for something not so greasy. The waiter suggested sliced tomatoes. Perfect. I ordered the burger cooked medium rare. I also asked that they serve the aioli on the side. I received the fries which were cold, instead of the tomatoes i ordered. Further, the burger was as cold as the fries and the aioli was absent. Since we had theater tickets in hand for a fast approaching curtain, I returned the dish.

My guest is on a low fat diet. She asked the waiter to provide plain quinoa instead of creamy quinoa and plain brussels sprouts instead of them roasted in butter. The salmon was ordered ""medium"". The dish arrived with the salmon cooked rare and the sprouts cooked hard raw. We sent the dish back along with my burger.

The manager appeared again to apologize and to present his business card so that he could ensure a better experience should we elect to return. Overall the service was reasonable. Our waiter never asked us if we would like another drink (beer and a cocktail), which were finished with our salad.

They gave us our check for 2 drinks and the salad.

Excellent service... our server brought us at least 5 tastings of beers to see which ones we wanted to drink with our meals.  

Most memorable items.... the short rib with the pea-mashed potatoes.  I'm a huge short rib fan and this is a generous and tender portion.  I personally had never had these green mashed potatoes either, delicious.

Number two is the pork chop.  I could have done away with the grapes it was served with, however this is a nice cut, I would expect a piece of pork like this in a steakhouse.

Number 3 is the poutine!  You've heard other people talking about this, and it is delicious.  That gravy, my goodness!!

I can't say that this is a place that you'd go out of your way for when in Vegas ... but you might walk from nearby hotels to go here.

If you love beer, you can't do much better. Their selection was insane and the prices were reasonable.

The food is what really surprised me. A place that is focused on beer might just phone in their food selections. But this place had some great stuff.

Poutine: Really delicious with loads of flavor. It could have used a touch more duck though. And the sauce was really salty to the point that the last 5 or so bites are saline to the point of pain. But other than that it is delicious in that hedonistic way.

Burger: I REALLY wanted to love it but only liked it. I mean, Guinness aioli? That sounds deliciously brilliant. The burger just has SO much going on though. They need to lose a couple of the ingredients. But it's still good for sure.

We also had the pickles which were surprisingly tasty.

The only major problem is the sheer lack of velocity. Everything here happens really slow. Now I will say that our waiter was AWESOME. He knew the ins and outs about our drinks and the food. He kept an eye on us and was funny to boot. But there is just such a massive lag to get your food out it's absurd. This is not a place to grab a ""quick bite.""

The bartenders were very welcoming and I got to see their beer menu from their iPad!  It's kind of cool although I'm not sure how they update it if one of their kegs gets changed?

Even though this place seems very fine dining from the outside looking in, the bar area was very lively in terms of banter and all.  I got recommendations for post work karaoke spots as well as their favorite go-to songs to sing(one of them was Ignition Remix by R. Kelly).  

In terms of the beers that I tried, I had a very mild sour beer along with a light hefeweizen and the bartender staff helped tremendously by letting me taste some samples to help me make my decision.

Even though I knew that the prices for beer in here would be higher than, say a off-Strip location, I wouldn't mind coming back here to Public House in the Venetian.

I was able to speak with him briefly during our lunch, and he promised us things of glory in the near future such as local Joseph James and Big Dogs specialty brews in casks... My eyes lit up with wonder.  

I tried the Poutine ($8), which translates to ""heart attack"" in the native Canadian tongue.  French fries, duck, cheese curds, and a light gravy sauce.  The server warned me that the dish does not have added salt, but it is still extremely salty due to the ingredients.  Salty + beer = good, so I went with it.   Although salty, it wasn't offensively salty until I got to the very bottom of the bowl.  But by that time I was stuffed anyway.  It went perfectly with my beer, and let's be honest here, it is all about the beer.

I had a beer blended by the house Cicerone (Russell Gardner), which was a Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza blended with Maui's Big Swell IPA.  Both beers are two of my favorite beers by themselves.  The Calabaza is a light, tart ""sour"" farmhouse ale.  It's flavor can make you pucker depending on how old it is (the older the more tart).  The Big Swell is a very citrusy, lightly bitter and refreshing IPA.  I knew the two would be great together, and I was right.  What a delight!  Russell hits a home run on his beer blendings.  

They had many amazing beers, such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter on cask, and Uinta's humongous (12% abv) and delicious imperial stout, Labyrinth on tap (good for dessert).  

It is worth mentioning that I had a small bite of my friend's tuna salad sandwich, and my other friend's hamburger (the $20 one).  Both were outstanding, although the tuna salad seemed like it could have been canned tuna to me.  

Overall, this place is a gold mine for beer lovers.  Russell even offered to sell me some stuff in their cellar.  Nothing he had interested me at the time, but I will be back to see if he can score some beer for me.  Yay for Public House!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,7,6,4,9LAVAeWYMvRem4Sh9MNlFA

Our appetizers: lobster mac and cheese and the steak tartar. Both of them were delicious!!!!

I wouldnt recommend browsing the pictures on Yelp because their menu is not as large and they don't carry some of the items that were posted. I tried ordering the french onion soup because I saw a picture of it on Yelp- but sadly they didn't have it on the menu. WAH :(

I ordered the Pub Burger. I usually don't like burgers with big patties because ground beef freaks me out. This was possibly the biggest burger patty I had ever had and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I could tell the meat was actual meat with no additives. The caramelized onions on the burger were perfection. 

Tried the Bourbon County beer- if you are a whiskey lover like me then this is a MUST!!!!!!!!

All in all, I loved this place. We had an awesome waiter, I believe his name was Josh...or Jake- don't really remember. His service was IMPECCABLE. My sister is pregnant and she got sick from what she ordered- he quickly took the plate away and accommodated her all night. Thank you for being so kind.

I've never had it nor have I ordered it anywhere else so I guess that's what I get for assuming! It's was a small appetizer which was perfect because I wasn't trying to get full and walk the strip for the next 8 hours. 

Ashley assured me that the app was a small dish - when I received it I was shocked. In my head I was definitely thinking ""what in the hell am I going to do with this."" But it was quite filling actually and very delightful.

2650869,2012-07-14,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"I went to eat at Public House during my recent Vegas vacation. Located at The Venetian Hotel and Casino right across from the Blue Man Group theater, the wife and I decided to try this  based off from all the good Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. I researched the menu before arriving so I knew what I wanted, but unfortunatly the menu I was handed only somewhat resembled the on-line version and many of my choices were missing. This was rather aggravating but all was forgiven after the meal as what I did have was excellent.  All the plates are designed for sharing which is nice as it allows you to try a little of everything. One of my favorite things was being able to design my own meat and cheese platters.  For the cheese choice we went with Welsh Cheddar, seriously sharp and seriously good and served with a Fresh sweet Tomato jam. For the meat choices we went with a thin sliced and delicious Serrano Ham with whole grain mustard and Potted Duck Rillettes ,which was basically a duck confit spread served in what looked like a candle jar. This was rich and creamy and paired well with the cheese, tomato jam mustard and Ham. All the items were served with some nice grilled crunchy French Bread.  Our next course was Duck Poutine ( because I can't get enough of duck or Fries with Cheese Curds and Gravy)  This would have been better had the fries been homemade as is traditional poutine but was still very good. The gravy was dark and rich and made with dark porter ale beer. The whole dish was greasy goodness.  Next up we split a short rib entree, complete with neon green sweet pea mashed potatoes, more stout gravy and a couple onion rings for garnish. The short rib was fall apart tender and extremely meaty and rich. This was far better then any other steak I had while  in Vegas ( sorry Mr. Gordon Ramsey). Lastly was dessert, which we didn't really need but were glad we got.  I can't actually remember the name but it was a deliciously moist chocolate layer cake laced with chocolate mousse and topped with Bacon Rice Krispie Square Pieces ( yes you read that correctly Bacon Rice Krispies). This was an over the top dessert. Also don't forget to check out the bathrooms while your here- they are complete with witty sayings on the walls and above the sinks. Don't be shy about taking pictures when you do check them out (just try not to catch anybody taking care of business).

I had the herb chicken and with in 15 minutes of eating it I was in the bathroom throwing up. I believe there are issues in their kitchen. When I called to inform them of the incident there was no apology but said they would notify the  kitchen. The GM later called very apologetic and doubted that it came from them since the onset was quick. He assured me that the kitchen would be inspected and offered to pick up dinner tomorrow night.

Now on to our experience at Public House.
The atmosphere is great. Very calm and intimate. I love that. The crowd that comes here is a more mature crowd, so you won't hear any trendy club music or find discount shots.
We went here on New Years Eve, one of the Strips busiest nights and Public House was a needed escape from all the crowds and craziness. The menus at the bar are so freaking cool! They give you an electronic tablet that has their entire drink menu programmed on it. From cocktails to spirits to beer. EVERYTHING is there to learn about. You just touch your category and choose from a list. Once you have chosen something, for example a cocktail, it tells you what's in it. If you're not interested, just go back to the previous list.

Our bartender was awesome. He was a real friendly knowledgeable guy. This was our one and only visit to Public House and it was well worth it. If we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will return for a night of drinking at Public House.",ejryf32C4ZBURQojvWsxig,2,1,4,gKKcoI4eWtoyCQ6IaFpbCg

Olives and wedge salad to start, both great, plenty of olives.

My wife had the strip steak which she loved.  She ate it without A-1 which was a first for her.  She always has A-1 on her steaks.  It was that tasty and well seasoned.  

I had the short rib which came with mashed potato with pea puree in it.  Super good, short rib was super tender, and had amazing flavor but was a smaller portion, it was about the size of a filet mignon.

Also had the Corn with Lobster, super good, comes out really hot, and stays hot in cast iron serving dish.

I feel like maybe it was worth the $115... maybe.  But not $200.

Overpriced but subpar food.

He'res what was GREAT:

Poutine - surprise!  Honestly better poutine than any I've had in Canada or US before.  Perfect fries, cheese, and the duck was amazon.  Not fatty!

He're what was OKAY:

Pub Burger - nothing special... at ALL.  And for $20, you should expect special from a burger.  But it wasn't bad.

Fried Cauliflower App - very good actually, but way overpriced at $14 for an app that had about $.50 in ingredients.

Here's what was POOR:

Wings - Fair.  Super spicy.  And about 3x what you would expect to pay for six wings.

Seabass - It was a thin piece of what tasted previously frozen seabass, with no seasoning at all, that was likely pan fried to a crispy overcooked shell.  If I paid $15 for it, maybe.  But for $38, are you kidding me???

Service was good.  Setting is fine.  But there are so many better places to spend your money in Vegas.  Shame on me for getting a coupon.  Usually there is a good reason why restaurants have to use coupons to get people in the door.

Speaking of, when seated at a table for four (was surprised they sacrificed one for just me, a walk-in) I was provided an iPad which contained all the menus for all the beer. I didn't see anyone else with an iPad though, which I thought was peculiar. Frustration kicked in when I tried to order two beers and they were out of both. Why not have the menus update this information? Regardless, the ""beer cicerone"" was able to help me pick something comparable. They have many canned beers, which they take pride in. So what did I do? Ordered canned beer. Why not-it's Vegas.

Had the Poutine for the appetizer (which was enough for one person's entree): thin, seasoned fries with duck confit, thick cheese curds, a sunny side egg and a gravy that the waiter poured on the dishin person at the table. He even asked me if I was ready (which spooked me a little-uh, ready for what?) This, my friends, was THE. BEST. POUTINE. Everything was perfect, especially that spooky gravy. It's also hard to find poutine stateside that has quality cheese curds.

Entree was their version of Chicken (Quail) and Waffles: buttermilk fried quail and waffles served with greens with lemongrass butter and Moose Drool (a brown ale from Montana) syrup. It was ...good, but not great. I think I was just wanting fried chicken and waffles and not have to fight with quail bones (no fault of theirs.)

For my (and your) finale was a Chocolate Stout Layer Cake with Malted milk ice cream and, AND, caramelized bacon rice crispies. To be honest, the only, ONLY, reason I got this? To see what bacon crispies tasted like. I was already full of food and beer. I knew the chocolate cake was going to be rich and decadent and yes, the crispies did indeed taste like bacon.

My wife got the crab salad - and in the description indicated was served with avocado.  The avocado was deep fried - WTF?  There is a reason you don't cook avocado - it tastes terrible!  

As our beers were empty, the server never offered to get us another round, and we had to ask about dessert options!  WTF - I though Vegas was a service-oriented town. So after dinner we went to have more drinks elsewhere.  

The concept was good but the execution was poor.  Maybe we had a bad draw with our server, but certainly will have to think carefully about whether we will return our next time in town.",_KVAlmVunQGM1vo0K3OB_g,0,0,2,IswCLjy9S8vICpSPdkGIaw

However, combined with the great service, entree, and a particular appetizer (GET IT).  This is a place that you can come to relax just before a long night in LV.

The appetizer that won my heart was their pig's tail.  Wow.  It was tender, soft, full of flavor, and crispy and sweet on the outside.  Simply the best pig part that I've tasted from a Western style cooking perspective.  So... I say again, GET IT!

The other dishes were decent... though I was underwhelmed by the poutine.  I'd skip that one.  The roasted bone marrow.... excellent.  It had good texture and was freshly cooked.  The short rib was tender and soft.  The sea bass was good, but personally, it was a little buttery for me.  If you are into very buttery dishes though, then this is the dish to get.

The desserts were really good.  I had chocolate stout cake and the croissant bread pudding.  They were both sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.

The menu changed a bit, and favorites like the lamb meatballs were taken off. Most upsetting were the wings. They didn't look as good and they certainly didn't taste as good. No longer did the wings have the crispier skin or the delicious sauce. The new sauce tastes like there is a hint of cinnamon in it (gross) and more salt then someone would need to consume for a month. The skin was also mushy/fatty. My husband got the new duck confit reuben (meant to replace the lamb meatball sandwich) and it was a throw away. It wasn't good and it wasn't bad. It was substance. No one goes out and pays $13 for a small sandwich as mere substance (that's what bananas are for!).

We all ordered medium rare and ended up getting steaks on the Medium to Medium well side. If the steaks were cooked better, I'm sure it would've been a little bit more enjoyable but overall, we were all in agreement that they were a little oversalted as well.

I know a party of 10 can be a handful and perhaps they didn't have the right staff to accommodate, but overall I felt that we were a little neglected. After going to other bachelor parties that had impeccable service for even larger parties, it's hard to give this place a ringing endorsement.

They are very proud of their beer list, but with places like the yard house for cheaper I didn't find it a particular draw. They do have a rotating cask ale which is unique and reasonably priced. They get a handful of casks and then move on to the next beer when they run out.

They claim they offer comfort pub food which roughly translates into very rich food. They have homemade pates and charcuterie which were very good but enough to share. The welsh rarebit is beer cheese on toast which I though could have been a bigger portion when it came out, but ended up being perfect after I was stuffed with everything else. They have devils on horseback which is the now ubiquitous bacon wrapped stuffed dates. They are popular for a reason. The poutine was topped with cheese curds, duck confit, and veal gravy. It was both as amazing and filling as it sounds. I could have eaten that and nothing else.

I would definately recommend getting the house made pickles. It comes with pickled onion, cauliflower, and carrot.

Fortunately with Public House, that was not what we found. In fact, I totally fell for this place!

We had been checking out the Venetian and Palazzo and hunger suddenly hit. Most restaurants were pretty quiet as it was a bit late for lunch.  We browsed a few storefronts before deciding on Public House. Perhaps we were drawn into to the dim lighting and the hip Americana decor. We sat in a plush booth and our server greeted us right away. She very friendly and inviting.

I had already eyeballed the Chicken Sandwich on the menu so I just had to order it. It was a grilled chicken breast topped with sliced ham, grain mustard, and cheese. Perfect texture and delicious! Paired with good ol' natural cut fries. All around very good.

I have to say I was really happy with Public House. I'd even say it was my favorite meal on the whole trip. I even tolerated the cheesy humor on the restroom walls. Be sure to find your way to Venetian if you want to check this place out!",6j0B1ExxwBg8W9IrwL9ohA,6,2,5,VdjuYfwG63WRweY-hH2MuQ

I was NOT disappointed!  We ordered the Bone Marrow appetizer which was still sizzling when it was brought to our table.  The bacon marmalade and grilled bread that accompanied it were both yummy.

My husband ordered the pub burger.  It was huge and looked juicy.  He said it was very good, but I did not get to try it because I was too busy swooning over the Scallops that I ordered for myself.  3 jumbo scallops seared to perfection atop shredded oxtail stew with a touch of matchstick potatos on top of it.  My only complaint about the scallops is that the portion was small.

I loved the decor, the staff was friendly without being too intrusive.  The signs in the hallway leading to the bathroom and in the actual bathroom stalls were quirky and cute.  

The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because at the end of the meal, it took them awhile to not only get our check to us, but to pick up our payment and then return it back to us.  I usually don't complain about this if it's busy, but there were not that many people dining at this time.

The Public House is one of those places.  It's OK for what it is, the food is pretty good and the prices are high (well, higher than they should be for a bar).  

Yeah, I know part of the high prices comes from the fact that this restaurant is also inside a hotel/casino, which makes it more expensive than other places, anyway.  But stuff didn't have to be this expensive.  Most appetizers were over $10 and the entrees ranged from $16-$30.  

The service was good, tables seemed pretty easy to come by (I ate here twice) and the portions were large.  The Poutine was a must-try, though I've had better elsewhere.  First time around, I ordered the pub burger, which was tasty with all of the add-ons I opted for .  Second time around, I had the fried chicken and it was really great but a huge portion that I couldn't finish and couldn't take back to my room with me.

Yes, you read that right. $14 for water. I'm gonna let that sink in for you for a minute. Plain, still water. $14. Not bubbly. Just the regular kind you would drink at home. FOURTEEN freakin dollars. It wasn't even my personal money I was paying with, and I was still pissed about it just based on principal alone. The atmosphere is nice. The wait staff is shit. I won't be back. Ever.

The place was not busy. She offered me a table in the lounge. I said I didn't want  a low table. She offered a high table in the bar and said to seat myself. My instinct, based purely on her attitude said to leave. I should have listened to myself. I sat for a bit and finally the bartender, who was very sweet, asked if anyone has talked to me yet. She got me a menu and in a few min.  a friendly guy brought cutlery, napkin and wedges for the wobbly table. 
I ordered the house pickles and the burger which came with herb fries. The pickles were ok but should have been drained before serving, about a quarter inch of vinegar on plate. Except for the peppers, everything kind of tasted the same. good but kind of boring. Great crunch though. Not worth the $6
Burger, for $19, was not so great. Patty was cooked correctly but seemed unseasoned. Bun is like a across between a classic bun and an english muffin -odd. I felt like I had to eat fast to keep it from falling apart, bottom of bun got  very soaked. Cheese was partly melted, partly firm and waxy which made for a poor mouth feel.  The burger had good potential, but for the price was very disappointing. 
The herb fries were about the worst I've had anywhere. Shoestring cut, greasy, mealy, just bad. I left them.
Service, aside from a water refill,  was basically non existent. I got up to get my drinks from the bar, got up to order food from the bartender and I got up to ask for my check. At no point during my meal did anyone stop by to ask how anything was.  ZERO. I cant see any reason to return.

BUT.......since the vast majority of our group was there on business the check needed to be split so receipts could be turned in. There were a few couples there, so I think we needed it split 8 ways. We were told that they could only use 3 different card and that the tables could not be split. Our group was sitting at 3 four tops put together, and a long bench seat on one side. I feel like it would have been very easy to split us and still keep us all seated next to each other due to the bench seat.

I understand that rules/policies are what they are and are put in place for a reason. However, I think this policy may have been put in place for smaller orders or groups, and it may have been smart for our server to check with a manager before having a group of 12 just walk out the door.

He had the Pub Burger ($19) and I had the Quail ($26). He said the burger was pretty tasty, and the thin sliced fries that came with it were certainly appetizing. It was my first time having Quail, so I was unsure what to expect, but it tasted pretty decent! It was breaded in a manner similar to fried chicken, and came with a waffle and what looked to be a spinach and bacon concoction. It was a fantastic dish, though I was surprised at how little meat came on the plate, but then again a quail is quite a small bird.

For dessert, we split the Chocolate Stout Layer Cake ($9). It was extremely rich, and had an interesting caramelized bacon topping on it. Even Dad tried it and thought it was delicious, and he NEVER eats desserts.

The service was excellent as well. Our server, Nikolai, was super speedy and friendly, a nice guy to gab with. The manager who helped process our Groupon was very nice as well :)

Food is quasi-pub style, with things like bone marrow, burgers, and poutine. Everything was really stick-to-your-ribs heavy, which is sometimes called for after a heavy night of Vegas-ing. 

Service is friendly. We were greeted heartily at the door, and the bartender was really nice. 

Beer and tap list are what you would expect, and is about par with other comparable restaurants. But as I hinted at early in my review, the wine list is a surprise and worth checking out. Someone with knowledge and an eye for value is running the wine show, because the list is filled with bottles that are exciting, hard to find, and are priced right in that Vegas sweet spot of $50-$70. That's the pricing range where values tend to hide (less than that, and you're usually looking at a 4x markup for a $10 wine), and there were many to be had here.

We called in to make a reservation, and they said they could accommodate us at 8:30pm for a party of 8. Since they needed a credit card to hold the reservation, we held off on confirming and called back an hour later (at 1:30pm) after I spoke with the rest of the group. By then, they didn't have availability for 8:30, so we were going to go somewhere else. However, at 5pm we decided to go to Public House after all if they were able to seat us within the hour and just get ready later. They said that they could accommodate us in half an hour, so we agreed to head down shortly. We got a bit lost walking over to the Venetian, and we didn't get there until 6pm. When we go to check in at the hostess stand, she gives us a death stare and attitude about how we were supposed to be there half an hour ago, and they may not be able to seat us but she would see. She came back to say there was a table available, but it would take 10 minutes to set up, but we think she just wanted us to wait to be biatchy. And the restaurant wasn't even packed! It was full, but there were still empty tables. When we were finally seated, our server came over right away and seemed really friendly, which was a relief. We ordered:

-Short Rib (Deschutes Black Butte Porter Braised, Sweet Pea Potato Puree, IPA Battered Onion Rings $29): Pretty good but not a mind-blowing dish. The short rib was really tender and the onion rings were delicious, although I think they only gave us two onion rings.
-Pub Burger (All Natural Grass-Fed Beef, Bacon Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Roast Tomato, Frissee, Guinness Aioli w/Herbed Fries $19): Decent burger, but we asked for medium and it was barely medium rare. I wouldn't pay $19 for it again, but at least they gave us a ton of herbed fries whcih were really tasty.
-Foie Gras (Rhubarb Compote, Almonds, Toasted Brioche $19): Good but not worth $19- it was a pretty small piece of foie gras.
-Potted Farm Egg (Asparagus, Chaumes Fondue, Black Truffle Vinaigrette $14): Awesome deal for only $14! This dish was inventive and delicious.
-Quail (Buttermilk Fried, Waffle, Bacon Braised Swiss Chard, Moose Drool Maple Glaze $26): I tried some of my friend's dish, and it was yummy! The waffle was nice and crisp and went well with the quail.
-Creamed Corn & Lobster w/Bacon $10: Pretty good but really creamy. Teeny tiny pieces of lobster.

The food took a little while to come out, and we were confused since a couple of large tables left, and there were empty tables so it's not like they had a huge dinner rush. I had checked in on FourSquare and got a complimentary pint of beer. Our server accidentally brought us two, which we pointed out and he said he would just comp the second beer. Of course, we were charged for both beers on the check. We were trying to get pay quickly and get out of there since dinner took so long, but it took forever to grab our server and get the bill straightened out. I will cut him some slack because he looked super busy and was running around, but I saw one of the managers walking around in his suit and he never came by to see how we were doing and if we needed assistance, even though my friends were walking around with the bill in their hand when looking for our server. Oh well. Come try out Public House if you want to give quail and waffles a chance, but skip if you're in a hurry, and/or want some good service.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,0,0,2,4ZnySx_C_rcN7rZ-MjXk2A

Frog Legs: This dish was okay.  I dont really remember too much about it, so I guess it didn't make an impression on me.

Scotch egg - egg with mustard and crack....  end of story.

Grilled octopus: I liked how there was a bit of tang on this dish, probably from the lemon juice.  The flavors worked pretty well, but I probably wouldn't order this again.

Bacon mussels:  WOW.  I never knew this combination would work...even though they say that bacon goes with everything.  A tornado of flavors really hits you on this dish.  Probably the best thing I ate all weekend.

Bone marrow:  Since bone marrow doesn't have much flavor to it,  I applaud the chef for being creative and serving this dish with carmelized onions.  The marrow acts as the ""butter"" for the bread slices while the carmelized onions gives it that much needed kick.  Tasty dish.

Short rib:  While on the expensive side for short rib, it was probably the most tender short rib I've ever had.  I always expect short rib to be a bit on the dry side, but not here.  The pea mash potatoes are tasty... if you like peas.

Dry-aged rib eye:  Although I've had a better steak for the price, Public house does serve a decent piece of meat.  Although a bit on the fatty side, the meat was juicy, tender, and nicely seasoned.  We also ordered a side of herbed fries for 7bux.  It was nice and crispy.

Beer menu: Nice selection of items on tap.  While they were out of a few items that I wanted (grrrrr),  they still had other items like Stone 15th anniversary, Big Bear IPA, moose drool, chimay triple white, and a few others.  The markup for the beers was a bit much though.  Expect to pay 8+ dollars per glass.  Cool concept to have an ipad as the drink menu.

4 stars is about right for Public House.  Come here, pay a pretty penny, and enjoy some delicious good eats.",QWxW_pApmpY9iPApC8P-UQ,3,1,4,V4_m3GswqFZlZIp2AaYrFA

I don't know how the burger was because my husband ate it in about 1 bite, but he seemed to enjoy it!  The pork belly sandwich was just okay, there was way too much slaw and no apple aioli like promised.  The pork belly was also jut a bit off, like it was almost too chewy.  I know pork belly in general is very fatty and can be chewy but I kept feeling the need to look an make sure what I was eating was cooked!  We also had the poutine with an egg on top....very good!

We dined fairly late but had reservations; it didn't take long to get seated but once we had a table, service was fairly spotty. There were long stretches of time during which we didn't see any waitstaff at all. The iPad menu is neat and all but I would've rather had an iPhone so I could call our waiter when I needed a drink refill or something!

My husband and I split the poutine appetizer, which was delicious, and I had the short rib for my entrée and he had a pub burger. The burger was tasty and my short rib was tender and flavorful, everything you expect from a short rib, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were BLAND BLAND BLAND.

3518102,2012-01-08,2,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"This place oozes coolness. From the high tech looking beer tap set up, to the quirky signs in the bathrooms there are so many details that make this place special.

We first went the day after they opened for some of their many craft beers at the bar. We enjoyed the place so much that we went again the next day for dinner. I really appreciate Public House because of their attention to detail.  The decor is modern and has so many interesting things to notice. They even have some fun notes in the bathroom for you to see.

The beers, oh the beers! There are so many types and the taps run all the way from one side of the bar to the other across the ceiling in industrial looking piping. We checked out some football games on their well positioned TVs while listening to their indie style music mix.

You must get their Pork Rinds! These are not like the ones you get that are processed and sitting in a bag for months which leave that weird disgusting coating in your mouth. These are fresh and with a squeeze of lime they crackle and are perfect with beer.  We also tried their onion soup. It was really good too.

When we returned for dinner I tried one of the barrel beers which is served at a warmer temperature than a beer is typically served. It allowed the full essence of all the flavors of my IPA to come through.  

 Both our appetizers were solid but nothing that special. We had the Ahi Poke and the Potted Egg.  The Poke was kind of plain but a nice portion of high quality fish.  The Potted Egg is hard to describe but is basically a creamy ricotta cheese sauce with a poached egg and wild mushrooms.  It may sound strange but is a nice combination of flavors. The only disappointments were our entrees. The chopped salad had way too much dressing and the dressing wasn't great to begin with. The pork belly wasn't anything special.  The meat's consistency was too stringy and the top of the meat was not as crisp as I would expect from a nice fatty piece of pork belly.

Considering how great everything was, including our service both times, I will write off the issues with the entrees. Plus, they had only been open a couple of days.  I'm looking forward to going back and try some more beers, but I'll probably just stick with their appetizers next time.",0QdwQLVxZpgy9Qb2Qakflw,5,4,4,yrkvCAdG-6Q5CxJPgqqUXg
3519595,2012-02-24,6,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Beer heaven. The pipes along the ceiling leading to the bar may be fake, but there's nothing bogus about the quality of the beer and food. There's no doubt that they take their drink menu seriously. They employ a cicerone (beer version of a sommelier) who has crafted a beer menu second to none. With a good mix of popular craft brews and lesser known ones, there's something for everyone. The menu also includes several barrel aged beer and cask beer. If you're as uninformed as me, take a few moments to chat with the cicerone, Russell Gardner, who will gladly drop some knowledge on you.

Make sure you look at the serving size listed in the menu for each beer. I ordered the Uinta Labrynth Black Ale without doing so and ended up with a whole bottle (750ml) all for myself. Not that I minded... it was so good that I didn't want to share. It was a good thing that my wife was willing to drive home.

The food here is a perfect match for the beer. It isn't just upscale bar food. The menu is full of unique and thoughtful interpretations of classic comfort food.

Appetizers and small bites that our party of four sampled included olives ($6), a selection of three cheeses ($16), and Devils on Horseback ($6), their take on stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. The best app we tried was their Bouchot mussels ($14) which consisted of a dozen or so bivalves in a rich, slightly creamy broth of wit beer and creme fraiche. There was plenty of toast with the dish to sop up every drop. It was so good there was no way we were going to let any go to waste.

For the main course the French onion soup ($9) was a hit, as was the Lamb pierogies ($26) -- a creative version of ""Shepherd's Pie"" with the dumplings resting atop a potato puree and finished with some lamb jus. The short rib ($29) was a hefty portion of tender beef, but I found it to be too fatty and the sauce bordering on gummy. But, the butternut squash puree and onion rings that came with it were amazing.

Along with the entrees, we tired the brussel sprouts ($8), which could have cooked a touch longer, and the heirloom beets ($11.50). Even if you hate beets, it's a must! It's the kind of dish that you'll be fighting over. The goat ricotta cheese mouse gave it a sweet taste that was balanced out by the acidity and a touch of bitterness from the other ingredients. 

The service made the experience even better. The server and cicerone were both charming and knowledgeable and the manager even stopped by to make sure we enjoyed everything. With the success of Holsteins and the Barrymore it's no fluke that Block 16 Hospitality has delivered another hit with Public House. They seem to have a solid understanding of what it takes to have a flourishing restaurant.

- Drink menu is extensive and fun. I would come here for drinks again.
- Apps ordered were Devils on Horseback and Poutine.  The Devils on Horseback were alright, but the gravy on the poutine was just wayyyyyy tooo salty.  We couldn't even finish it.
- I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pierogies.  While they were quite tasty, when I think about the fact they cost $27, so it's basically $9 for each one and they come with that unfortunate salty gravy, I think that's overly expensive.
- Husband ordered the short rib, but substituted the goat cheese polenta.  Again, short rib was tasty, but was it worth $29?  Eh.  However, the polenta was delicious.
- Bacon brussels sprouts for side.  Nothing to write home about.

Duck Poutine with Fried Egg -- http://bit.ly/1v992rE
This was good and loaded with a generous amount of Duck Confit, but I wish it had more gravy.  I usually like my Poutine drowning in that stuff not only because it tastes good, but it makes it easier to eat as well.  This was a huge portion and the Fried Egg, which made for a nice addition, really wasn't necessary for me to add.

Welsh Rarebit --  http://bit.ly/1zdyUZQ
I really ordered this because I had assumed that the Poutine was only going to be a moderate-sized portion.  Well, I was wrong with that assumption.  Plus this was pretty hearty for a side dish as well with all that melted cheese.

I wanted some Frambroise Lambic so I was happy to see that they had it on their beer menu.  For premium pricing of course, but what the hell, we're on the Strip.

First of all, if your restaurant is completely empty and I walk up the host station saying, ""Two for lunch please,"" an appropriate response is not ""Do you have a reservation?"" Even less appropriate is to ask for my first name, last name and cell phone number. I ain't falling for your text message marketing scheme, Public House. Also pretty sure that I won't ""forget anything at the table"" like you suggest that's what giving you my number is for. Sheesh.

Now that we have that out of the way, let's get to the food. I had to go to work immediately after, and the server did not disappoint when I told him I had to be out of there in an hour. He got us our food and my friend's beers and even time to glance at a dessert menu in that time. Well done, sir. 

My friend ordered a beer flight--I rode with a lemonade because I hear that workplaces nowadays don't like when you show up just having drunk at the pub. So I hear. Anyway, we both ordered the pub burger and shared the welsh rarebit and the crisp pork belly. 

Burger--outstanding. I'm not sure worth the $19 pricetag, but definitely delicious. I would order this again if I were inclined to revisit. Welsh rarebit--delicious and reasonable at I believe $7. I would also order this again. The allegedly crisp pork belly was not that great--it wasn't crisp at all, and not really a good sharing appetizer. I love pork belly but this didn't have the best punch-you-in-the-mouth melty bacon flavor. Pass.

All in all a decent meal, but if you get an appetizer, a side, two burgers, a beer flight and a beer, it will run you over $100. Steep pricing, but I suppose that's what you get with a schmancy hotel like Venetian/Palazzo.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,2,0,3,V2abR-Pk126FE2J7XdYoyQ

Listen kids, when I was growing up back in the 1970s there weren't no Gastropubs. (You remember the 70s, right? You've seen it on the TV. Ashton Kutcher lived there.) There was bars, sure. Sometimes you called them pubs, like if you was that Irish Andy Capp feller on the comic page. But even them fancy sounding pubs just gave some salty peanuts. There weren't no gastros. 

Pubic House is a gastropub. That means it has a foodie take on bar comfort food plus a great collection of beer and wine.

Public House is AWESOME. It's an oasis in Vegas, tucked inside the Venetian. The music isn't too loud and they played a lot of classic rock when I was there. The feel of the place is solid, dark and comfortable. The service is great and the staff is smart. I ate there about five times on a recent stay in Vegas. I ended bringing my laptop and having some long working lunches.

Beer and wine selection on iPad like tablets. Great idea and more than a gimick because it allows perusing descriptions. Plus, it's a cool gimmick.

The food. Wow. Bone Marrow there was incredible. Poutine was delish although thicker fries would gave been better. Mussels were perfect; very bacon-y. Welsh rarebit quite good. Cheese plate with a nice bleu stretched out a beer at that long lunch. Quail and Waffles was a great, sorta pretentious take on Chicken n' Waffles but damn, it worked. The kale that came with it was a wonderful surprise, too, and it also was bacon city.

Great place to hang out, eat and drink.",LIn3ZoiGGn5D5nC0BQOMRw,3,1,5,gznfdXb-QMXypKvGYXXrkQ

Poutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. 
Lamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.
Steak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).
Southern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.
And lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it.

I asked my server about the poutine and she explained the appetizer was large and meant to be shared.  She asked me if I had planned on getting a burger and when I answered affirmatively, she said she could sub a down-sized version of poutine for the fires.  A win!

My iced tea was brought quickly and not too much later, a runner appeared with my burger and poutine.  I have not had poutine before.  I'm not sure how authentic this is with the shredded beef on top but there was some cheese and I was brought a small container of gravy to pour over the fries.  They were OK.  I think I need to be closer to Canada to get the real thing.

The barmaid was very friendly and provided great service. She made some great recommendations for food. I wished I only listened to her. I saw Buffalo Pork Rib on the menu and knew I had to try it.

They have an extensive bottle list but the prices are stadium level high; $14 for a Dog Fish Palo Santo Marron and $8 for Negro Modelo?? come on! But prices weren't the only thing that knocked down my review....

The service... my god... so we had a table for 5 and 3 of us were good to go at the reservation time, I figured that would be enough to get seated. But no... their policy was we needed to have the entire group. This was on a Friday but there were plenty of tables available and they close at 12 so I don't see why this rule isn't flexible. We just wanted to get some appetizers and give you our money! Since two of us were running an hour late, we decided to head back to the Venetian and gamble. Luckily it wasn't a total bust as I won $134 on the monopoly machine. 

We went back at ~10:30 (might've been 11) with our 5 and... yeah they weren't seating people anymore. So we had to seat in their lounge area. We grabbed a seat from another table (again PLENTY of tables available) and figured we could get a few drinks in before closing time. The first round was quick and on point. Second round not so much... two drinks took well over half an hour to arrive, small apology is all we got, and another was brought without a clean glass. The place was pretty dead so I have no idea why it took so long to get our drinks. But the beer was good and we were no our way. Until we saw the terrible bill.

We were double charged for the two drinks that took +30mins to arrive. We had asked for a split check and they weren't even close to be correct. Took us a few minutes to flag her down but she did manage to write down which drinks should be billed to which check. Though she did fight us on the double charges. She kept pointing to my beer and saying I had two of the $14 beers... yeah I would've remember that. She also said ""well the bar made two margaritas"" and we countered with ""well we only ordered one and only one showed up"". Took a few more run through and she was annoyed by it but she did fix it so I tipped her the difference.

Wish I had the chance to try out the food but with the lousy service maybe it was for the best. I'll go back with a fellow beer lover but the price and service aren't worth for the casual group gatherings.",9tMQwIKkZvrigFKSRN7Kmg,3,0,2,nBcD3Uw4HTo9s9FLQPqmKg

Walked in and the ambiance is pretty cool. The bar is on the left right when you walk in, which is right where I found my fellow colleagues with a glass of Pino waiting for me (such good friends). The bartender was really friendly as well. It was pretty packed around noon and there's a lot of space when you walk in so plenty of room to wait for your party to arrive.

Once we were seated we were provided water and got a few drinks. We started with the steak tartar which was really good. It came with sliced toasted bread which no one really used because the bread seemed unnecessarily big for the actual tartar. I got the kale salad which was really good. I think it has apples ans candied walnuts with shaved fennel. Others ordered the chicken wings, Caesar salad and the special which was the Reuben sandwich. Everyone seemed pretty content with their orders.

Overall the ambiance waa really nice. Kinda rustic and dark inside, like you're in an upscale barn lol but I liked it.

Bone marrow ($15) w/ bacon & onion marmalade; Grilled octopus ($16) w/ fried chickpeas, chorizo, saffron-romanesco sauce & arugula; and Duck confit poutine ($11) w/ cheese curds, gravy & egg ($2.50 extra).

The marrow was excellent.  It was completely edible vs some places where all the marrow does not come off the bone.  It was nicely seasoned and the marmalade and bread were also excellent too:  5 Stars.  The octopus was outstanding.  It was way better than recently reviewed Black Hogg in Silverlake (LA).  The octopus was super tender, and the fried chickpeas and chorizo added texture and contrast to the octopus:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the poutine was the star of the evening and the perfectly cooked egg put this dish over the top!  The dish was nice sized, the fries were still crispy, and there wasn't too much gravy (poured on at the table).  This version was way better compared to Animal in LA:  5+++ Stars.

To drink, we had the Joseph James lager ($8) and a Speakeasy ($10).  The former is like a Stella (my go to beer), but w/ more malt.  The latter is a Belgian style beer, but not as sweet as some:  5 Stars for both.

Nicholas was an awesome bartender!  Not only did he introduce us to some new beers, he was also very knowledgable about the menu.  Lastly, he poured a tequila shot down the finished bone marrow for one patron.  The patron said he really liked it!  - 5 Stars.

How glad the husband is that I research things way ahead of time and knew that this was one of the few places where you could have bone marrow for lunch.

We hiked it on over here and immediately ordered the mixed flight and light flight of beers.  I traded the husband for the cider on his light flight and we ordered.  OMG, this is amazing food and service!!

I got the lobster roll which was the best I have had outside of Boston - maybe even better than some places there.  Not overdone with onion, huge chunks of meat, and the buttered brioche roll held-up perfectly.  Husband had the bone marrow and a meat plate he created with the best proscuiutto and cheddar (welsh) that I have had in a long time (I did sneak a bite of each).  

We then ordered the chocolate stoute cake with BACON krispies and this was equally incredible.

Our server was super friendly, helpful and made the meal one of our top of the entire trip.  I only wish they sold t-shirts because I would have bought some to remember this great meal!",QnCWtjNiSIRXxSWujG8oBQ,1,1,5,Gy1iKk0pKydAhYgw0uItug

I read some reviews and noticed that there was a groupon and I WAS SO LUCKY! I went on groupon and found it with only 30 minutes left! I purchased a groupon and decided to check it out when i arrived.  I got to vegas on Saturday and the first stop was Public House because I was STARVING. 

We were kindly greeted and seated to our table...the ambiance is very modern and the beer list was AMAZING.  I got the beer flight, I can't remember what I got :( this is what I get for reviewing too late wahhh, and my friend got red wine, I forgot the name of the wine too sorry!!!

He took two things that I love: bar food and beer - and made a menu that revitalized my love for the gastropub. It's a shame that this place is not getting the love that it deserves. The unique array of food here is really out of this world.

I did not get a chance to try an entree, but I did get to sample some apps for a light lunch. And let me tell you, these so called ""bar snacks"" really packed a punch to my taste buds. 

With bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with bleu cheese (dubbed ""Devils in Horseback""), that nearly made me fall out of my chair in a daze of deliciousness, I instantly demanded another order with slivers of drool drifting off of my lip. Then came the poutine, a dish originating from the land of Canada. It comes as a bowl filled with seasoned fries, topped with cheese curds and duck confit (aka super flavorful duck meat). If that wasn't amazing enough, it came with their rendition of ""gravy"" to pour over it. It was so good that I nearly cried, sipped some beer, then cried some more. The pork rinds... well, they were nothing to write home about. They were ok, but reminded me too much of the packaged variety. Everything just went so awesomely with my beer though.

The service was top-notch. The beer selection: wonderful. The food? So good, I'm filling out postcards about my brief trip to bacon and poutine paradise.

We sat in the bar area, with cozy couches and chairs.
I started out with a Prosecco and the hubby a mimosa, served up perfectly chilled in a beautiful champagne glasses.

This restaurant gets 5 stars and 3.5 of those stars go to the staff. From the nice hosts as you walk in to the bussers and runners. I was hoping this place would be great for us and it exceeded expectations.

Public House is probably the first restaurant you run into once you exit the convention center so as you could expect it gets busy, FAST! I am smart so I obviously made a reservation. After pushing through the crowds of angry (idiots) that were complaining about an hour wait since they didn't have reservations (!!), we were seated promptly. 

They have an awesome beer selection and the waiters are very helpful in helping you choose from the extensive list. If you eat hear you MUST get the poutine appetizer. I crave the poutine for months after I have left Vegas. It consists of fries covered in cheese curds, braised beef, and egg and is covered in a beef gravy. It's fantastic! The Pub Burger is also one of my favorites. Also good and they cook it perfectly to order! Get the side salad- the vinaigrette is shockingly good! The price isn't too much especially compared to Vega$ standards.

So, of course, I started with the Prosecco. What?! Yeah, I felt like it in this heavy 100 degree heat. It worked fine. The wine and beer list is available in a book or on an iPad; both were at our table. Those who ordered salads liked them. I nibbled on the Baby Lettuce & Fennel
Blue Cheese Crumbles, Figs, Pistachio, Citrus Balsamic Vinaigrette. I would have ordered my own but I learned a small frise salad came with many entrees. The fried oysters looked good, and were reportedly very nice. 

I held out for the bone-in Ribeye, one of my very favorites. It's a popular cut, and the priciest on the menu as well as the largest at 18 oz. It was very satisfying. Of course the chef's butter on top never hurts -- and in my book, I think that's actually cheating as one can hide a lot of sins behind butter, garlic and even a dash of lemon. Still, it didn't detract from the Creek Farms Natural Black Angus Beef, which is vegetarian fed, and free from hormones and other bad stuff. Cooked to order, and it was enough for me to have held-off on the starters.  Others at our table had the Filet, or the Free-range Chicken, or even the Quail and Waffles. The last one is a nice take on Chicken n Waffles, of course. Though, it was reported that the quail was a bit hard to really get at in the 'meaty' way chicken is. 

Service occasionally bobbled the ball. A slight mix-up on a drink; a salad that was to have been dressing on the side -- and it's replacement took awhile. ('Maybe they're washing it off my salad', went the wisecrack). I enjoyed a big red wine from Sonoma or Alexander Valley. I was asked if I wanted another long after my steak was gone. Similarly, another diner in our party did order another glass of wine, but had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a refill.

My friends and I booked it directly for Public House after arriving in Sin City following a harrowing drive (even though we left LA at 2:30, we still battled some of the worst holiday traffic I've ever battled). We got a round of Ballast Point's reliably delicious Sculpin from the taps, then ordered a few bottles. We tried the overpriced but tasty Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA (it was $26 for a not that big bottle) and Green Flash's Le Freak (a mutant combination of a Belgian Trippel and an American IPA), both delicious. I wasn't hungry because I'd eaten on the road, but my friend ordered their Burger and Fries and I tried a few bites... good stuff.

The decor was fun, basically a hip and winky American vibe with Vinyl Lincoln, Franklin, and GW Bush dolls lining the walls and a huge glass encased beer room. Our waitress was nice, but proportioned in those ridiculous Las Vegas waitress ways. So basically this place combined a hipster beer-hall you'd find in Brooklyn or Silver Lake and infused it with some singularly Vegas flourishes, which made it both silly and awesome.

Everyone absolutely loved it, even my one friend who is an extreme foodie and does not like most places we pick out.  So everyone was wanting to go back this year.  We had an 8:30 Sunday reservation so it was not crowded.  Due to a few people stuck at a Black Jack table we had a party of 5.  It took forever to get our server to initially stop by the table (at least 10 minutes).  Then our drink order took forever to get to our table.  There were not that many tables filled in the restaurant.  When we finally got to order we ordered our entrees and some of us ordered a salad or an appetizer.

My buddy said just bring us the check we were leaving (we were there for over an hour at this point with only one round of drinks to show for it the second round had not even gotten there).

We started off with the poutine, that delicious poutine.  Fries, gravy, duck, cheese curds and a fried egg.  I like all of these things on their own; but together?  I almost didn't want to share.  Everything combines to create a very savory, fancy, bar food appetizer.  A bit salty, but it was okay since we had plenty of beer available to wash it down with.  I see myself ordering this every time I come to Public house.  

For dinner I had the Pub Burger, which I was a bit leery about.  Anytime a burger approaches the $20 price point, I better be getting something special.  The standouts here were the bacon marmalade, roasted tomato and aioli.  This was not a dry burger; it was juicy and had plenty of sauce and flavors going for it.  

Between these two dishes, I think ordering one of each and sharing with someone makes for a good meal to carb up and prepare for more beer.

Their slogan - ""United We Stand, Pint in Hand"" - lured me in to check out their craft beer selection. They did not have an overwhelming selection but enough to satisfy this beer geek. But before making a final decision on the Public House, I did a little research on my smartphone and found out that the Public House was created and owned by the same people who started Holsteins, which is a top notch burger joint further down the strip in the Cosmopolitan. After that point, I was confident I could not go wrong with the Public House. 

Appetizer: The poutine was highly recommended from a super helpful and pleasant waitress.  She said this was not only one of her favorite appetizers but one of the most ordered appetizers on the menu.  After reading the description on the menu, I was thinking how could we go wrong with the poutine? French fries covered with duck, cheese and coated with a stout gravy. Yeah it tastes as good as it sounds. My wife and I finished every single french fry, piece of duck, cheese curd, and if I had thrown my manners out of the door I would have licked every drop of the stout gravy. 

Beers: My first beer was the Cask Dirty Dog IPA which was dry hopped with Amarillo. For those who have not had a cask beer before, it is pretty much beer without most or all of the carbonation. It really relies on the flavors of the hops and malts. Since I'm a big fan of Amarillo hops because of their distinct citrus and orange flavors, I knew I would not be disappointed with this beer. Sure enough, without the carbonation this beer quickly disappeared. Looking for a beer with a bigger and bolder bite, the next beer I decided to try was the Lake Mead Monster Amber Ale. Advertised as imperial amber ale, this beer boasted an abv of 8.9% and was packed full of spicy bitterness. I would definitely recommend this beer to those who enjoy full bodied beers. 

Entrees: I had the Pub Burger and my wife had the Lobster Roll. The Pub Burger was a thick and juicy ground beef patty, with gruyere cheese, guinness mayo, fire roasted tomato, and bacon marmalade layered in between a soft and freshly baked bun. One bite and I was hooked. This was an amazing burger! Every ingredient came together nicely to produce this tasty burger. My wife's lobster roll was equally as amazing. Big chunks of perfectly cooked Maine lobster was mixed in the perfect amount of mayo to create one of the best lobster rolls she had ever tasted. The quality of the lobster was over the top. Apparently they fly in fresh Maine lobster daily and it shows in the quality of the lobster. 

The Public House is an easy four stars. The service, the food and the craft beer are excellent! If the prices were lower, then I would no doubt give this place five stars.

Our server was a soup nazi.. Cranky, slow and definitely not happy to be there. My table mates were able to have a side salad with their meal..

The shrimp & grits seemed small for the price but was packed with flavor. It had a bit of orange peel flavor that complemented the savory sauce and andouille sausage. The two shrimp were perfectly cooked and shelled all the way to the tail. My husband loved his perfectly cooked pub burger. He was overjoyed with the poutine fries. The best.

Ok, fine i will. I'll go in reverse order, the bacon rice krispies are the topping on the 7 Layer Chocolate Stout cake. So good. 

I enjoy the scallops, the creamed corn & lobster side, the pub burger (in my husbands words ""the best burger I've ever had""), and the devils on horseback-bacon wrapped stuffed dates (MY personal fav.). All so good.

Please note, I cried a little inside when I didn't see the stuffed dates on the menu last night. We asked for them and ate them. They are now a bar snack so if you are sitting down having dinner, just ask for them!

I came in for lunch with my sister, aunt, and uncle after reading all of the great the reviews, and this Public House did not disappoint! It is a nice escape from the escape of Vegas, amongst all the other amazing restaurants and shops in the Venetian's Canal Shops. We ordered the poutine and the foie gras to start and they were amazing! The poutine comes with duck confit and a poached egg on top which was the perfect combination with the gravy and cheese curds. The foie gras was, as expected, a very small serving, especially for 4 people to share, but it was also amazing and very flavorful. I ordered the porchetta, which I had been dying to try, but I was actually a bit disappointed. It was served on a french baguette and the pork was extremely thin so really all I could taste was the bread and the excess of arugula. My sandwich came with herb fries, which were pretty good. My sister and my aunt both ordered the pub burger with bacon and avocado and after trying it I was a bit jealous. I'm always very reluctant to order a burger since pretty much every restaurant in the world offers one, but this was really one of the best burgers I've ever tried. My uncle ordered the short ribs and he said that they were also excellent. Our server was very helpful and friendly and recommended we also try their white sangria, which was good but very very sweet so we ended up ordering from their huge beer list as well.

It was one GIANT piece of fried fish with a serving of coleslaw which I hate but actually loved. The coleslaw was lightly dressed and reminded me of broccolini.

We got to Public House to find there was another event but Mark got us in this time.  Awesome customer service!  We were escorted to the bar and the bartender hooked us up with a couple of Cask Ales.  Then he didn't look at us for about 30 minutes.  Three bartenders and we had empty beer glasses for about 15 minutes.  Finally we got one of them to get us another drink.  We asked if they were serving food and they told us the kitchen was closed for the night.  This was at 9:00.  Very disappointing because I wanted to get some Poutine.

Towards the end of the night Russell, the Cicerone, came over and was totally awesome.  He talked to us for a few minutes and poured us some more Cask Ale.

English pub vibe with an American twist means you need to ROCK the fish and chips.

The place was dead on a Monday evening, 11/17/14 at 6 pm to be exact.

The duck confit fries are OVER rated, too greasy to toooo salty and the $2.50 extra for one fried egg is not worth it.  I say skip this dish.  I did say something but the guy

I was recommenced a duck confit pappadelle, which they used the same duck ingredient as the fries...$14 for appetizer size pasta...don;t get it.

Oysters on the half shell were fresh.  The $41 rib eye steak was good, but not the $14 asparagus/crab topping that went on it.

Lobster mac and cheese was good, only because there were more than 3 pieces of lobster.

I was charged for bottled water even though I said tap...I didn't bitch about it because it was in the bottle and my date said it was an unopened bottle.

Originally came because of it's a brewery but we only ended up sharing a flight to beer.

Service was fine, the steak did look like it was sitting under the lamp because the asparagus/crab topping on there looked dry.

150 bottle selections including a huge number of difficult to find, limited edition and seasonal brews, 20+ international and microbrews on tap, multiple cask matured ales tapped on site all backed by one of the most interesting and diverse international wine list, 300+ selections strong and a more than decent malt list.   Now were talking!

And the food.  This isn't your usual fish and chips, sliders, and nachos.  This is pub fare at it's finest.  The bone marrow served with a bacon marmalade and coarse sea salt is so rich, unctuous, and just plain good eats once spread on some grilled bread.  The four inch long bones does a great job preventing the marrow from overcooking. Perfect.

Other must try plates include the grilled octopus, potted duck rillettes, veal sweetbreads with a refreshing green apple slaw, and the blow your mind great poutine (thin fries topped with duck confit and a cheese curd sauce).  Finally, the lump crab salad that is more crab than greens accompanied by a tempura avocado and supreme of grape fruit.  Well balanced and delicious.

Note:  the dishes are made to be paired with beer or wine.  They taste salty if eaten alone.

Prices are in line with other true gastropubs.  Beers average $10. Wines below typical Vegas resorts.  

Service is excellent.  Bartenders and servers are extremely knowledgeable.  Amazing considering how quickly the selection of brews change.

Pinot Brasserie and Aquanox, say hello to your new neighbor/competition. Chef Anthony Meidenbauer of Holstein's & The Barrymore is the mastermind behind the menu and he didn't let me down.

SHORT RIBS: Most memorable part of the meal? SHORTRIBS. Our server recommended the pork loin and the diver scallops but something about shortribs seemed so tempting. Korean people like shortribs--kalbi duh... Braised and marinated in a bordelaise sauce, the meat was so soft and tender I could almost get through it knife-less. At $29, and the priciest thing we ordered, the meat portion was quite healthy served alongside a butternut squash mash and a couple onion rings. The mash was unfortunately overladen with butter. And the onion rings didn't stay crispy for long. 

BONE MARROW: I wish they cut the bone in half then roasted it. They served 3 pieces of marrow bone; one of which looked like all the marrow had leaked out of the bottom (the main reason why i like mine sliced in half before being cooked). However disappointed I was to scrape the last bits out of that bone, the other 2 were 100% amazing. Marrow, carmelized onion on a piece of crusty bread--win. $14

CANADIAN-FRIENDLY: Not that any place is anti-Canadian, but with as many people I meet on the Strip from the North, I might as well mention Public House serves POUTINE! The upscale Vegas version of course: crispy shoestring fries, cheese curds, and duck confit that will cause some unintentional drooling. All topped with bordelaise ""gravy."" They really like bordelaise here? As delicious as this was, I found it a tad bit on the salty side and the cheese left a bit of grease at the bottom of the bowl. $9

VARIETY: The menu is reasonably sized and moderately priced offering many options from all the usual animals: cow, chicken, pig. But they also feature quail and other classics from the sea. The person I was with isn't a seafood person; but next time, I'm not holding back! I wanna get into some of the muscles and oysters here.

BEER: There are a million beers on the menu but I had a couple glasses of one of my favorites: Delirium Tremens--a belgium ale that's so much better on tap and almost 2x the alcohol content of regular beer. Next time, I'll venture to try some obscure varieties I've never heard of.

The food quality in lieu of the beer offerings and dining environment make Public House a shoe-in on my hit list. The music isn't so loud where you can't have a casual business meeting here. But the decor and low-lighting makes this a wonderful date spot. Looks like this place gets pretty packed so I recommend making a reservation.

our server told us they just changed the menu about a week ago.  our cocktails off the new menu wasn't good... i see them redoing that menu in the future.

devils in horseback was good, but not as good as Firefly's. it came out kinda lukewarm.  i wasn't quite sure if the toast goes with the dish.
the crackling was pretty standard.  they are like the ones from the bags, no fatty layers i love =(  it came warm, and the dipping sauce made the dish.
poutine was delicious, but a bit salty.  the french fries were fresh and crispy, the cheese curd was semi melted over the fries, and the duck confit was melt in your mouth tender.  delish
short rib was heavenly.  it was fork tender, fresh and buttery.  the mash peas compliments the short rib well. 
we also got a side of cream corn with lobster.  it could use more cream, but it was delicious nonetheless!
for dessert we had ricotta corn fritter. they were balls of beignet with gooey centers, rolled in sugar, served piping hot with lemon curd, a side of corn ice cream on top of blueberry compote.  the combination of flavors works magically.  its a great desserts, must try!!

5112748,2013-03-25,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"I prearranged a dinner event for 10 with a quasi pre fixe menu and beer or whiskey pairing. When we arrived the table was setup in a semi private room which was nice but the general manager Mark and the Cicerone/manager Russell were not present. I expected at least one of them would have been there to say hello or greet us. No big deal though and we went and sat down. Our waiter then brings menus by and starts going over a few things and I told him that we had a prearranged menu with beer/whiskey pairing and he had absolutely no idea about it whatsoever. Great.....Luckily I had my email chain with the beer and whiskey pairings and we got it somewhat sorted out other than the fact that 2 of the beers we had put on the list they were out of. Ugh. The hits just kept coming. Our server did a good job handling the debacle that was no fault of his own but he did seem at times to be either annoyed by us or just wanted to get our table handled quickly since he knew he would get 18% guaranteed since our party was large.

On to the food:

Poutine- Solid dish and we added the fried egg on top. 
Octopus - Another good appetizer but it didn't wow me. I would go with the poutine over this all day but the contrast between the two was nice.
Beet Salad - My favorite dish on the list. Great flavor and fresh beets. 
Pork Chop - This was recommended to me and it was sadly overcooked which is the last thing you ever want with pork. The dish had promise but was prepared incorrectly.
Fries - Standard shoestring fries, good but nothing special.

Beer and Whiskey:
The beer selection was sadly disappointing. I have been to many other places that don't even focus on craft beers that have a larger selection. We had the Big Trout Slayer and the Grimbergem Blonde with the appetizers.

I went with the whiskey pairing with the main dish and I really enjoyed it. I am glad I decided to go that route versus the smaller beer selection, many of which were easy to find and get at home.

Overall, the food was a 3.5 or 4 but the lack of organization for a planned group over a month in advance and a limited beer selection for a place that prides itself on that was sadly disappointing. The service overall was okay but again there were times when I thought he was ""inconvenienced"" by us.

The waitresses were extremely attentive (and drop-dead gorgeous).  We were the only ones near one of the larger TVs, so we requested they change the channel to a certain game.  The manager came by and confirmed with us what game we wanted and promptly put it on that game.  So far so good.  

I read a few tips on Foursquare, and most beer lovers said to get a beer called ""Moose Drool Brown Ale"", which was brewed by Big Sky Brewery out of Montana.  Boy were they right about that ... great beer.  I would highly recommend it as well.  Prices were up there (it is a spot in the Venetian after all), but not at LA or NYC levels.  I ordered the Pub Burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.

My Quick and Dirty review ... 

Atmosphere - Great (had a cigar bar feel to it (without the smoke) ... dimly lit, leather couches, big TVs, attractive waitresses, etc.)
Food/Drinks - Fantastic (phenomenal beer selection and one of the best burgers I've ever had)
Service - Good (very attentive and helpful in recommending beers ... did I mention attractive waitresses?)

The whole time, the servers were attentive - my water glass was always full, they served the food right away, they checked on us a lot. 

Unfortunately, for me, my Bahn Mi $15 was tasty, but a too greasy.  Sure, it's pork belly sandwich, with jalepeno peppers, and other goodies, but after a few bites, I didn't love it.  I didn't hate it, but it didn't wow me.  The fries were tastier than the sandwich. 

Hubby's Baby Iceberg $13 and side of Chicken for $6 looked mediocre.  
I didn't even bother asking for a bite. 

Friend's Lobster Roll $26.50 looked AMAZING.  She didn't offer anyone a bite, so I think THAT's what I should order next time!  She said it was just what she was looking for. 

Friend's hubby's Pub Burger $19 looked huge and juicy.  Side of fries. 

The big draw here is the Beer... for beer fiends, you'll be very happy. They do a lot of cool beer cocktails:  Beerlini, and such.

Their special gravy was good, but a bit heavy on the salty side.  I'd prefer it being drizzled lightly or on the side.  I'd probably add the fried egg to this dish on my next visit.

One of those rare restaurants in Las Vegas that has remained successful for years without constant critical praise or the name of some absentee Celebrity Chef above the door, it was with desserts in mind that a party of three sat down inside Public House at The Venetian to watch the Buckeyes beat Sparty on Saturday, a few of Chef Anthony Meidenbauer's classics plus one that soon might be joining a full complement of desserts from Rebecca Bills, the Corporate Executive Pastry Chef for all of Block16 Hospitality.

Visited twice in as many days during a 2012 Christmas Vacation, the extensive beer list luring in a friend while Seared Foie Gras, a potted Egg dish and Bread Pudding all proved to be delicious during a long weekend of football, little has changed in the décor as suited Monkeys smile next to clever sayings, medium-volume rock music plays overhead with plenty of Television featuring games from every conference.

Every bit the Gastropub it set out to be, the menu morphing slightly from four years prior though several long-held favorites still stand out, it was with Coffee and Water plus excellent service that the meal took place over the course of nearly one hundred minutes, an Assistant General Manager named Bernard looking over things while Chef Bills took time to explain a bit of her training as well as many of the restaurant group's seasonal dishes.

Choosing to start savory, the housemade Charcuterie a well-culled collection including rich and chunky Pork Pate next to creamy Duck Rillettes plus a block of silky Liver atop toasted Brioche, more Duck was offered by way of one of Sin City's very best plates of Poutine, the handcut Fries crisp enough to stand up to Stout Gravy added tableside plus Confit, a fried Egg and Cheese Curds so fresh that they are still squeaky.

Intrigued by ""Buffalo Style"" Ribs, the tender meat slipping effortlessly from the bone with a fiery hit of acid that found it's foil in Blue Cheese Sauce, Chef Meidenbauer's Pub Burger succeeds on a level not unexpected for the man responsible for Holstein's at The Cosmopolitain, the grind of the Grass Fed Beef smooth despite being well packed beneath a layer of Gruyere, cooked Tomatoes and assertive Bacon Marmalade.

Truly rolling out the red carpet for pastries, all five of Chef Bills' current collection arriving with more Coffee plus the sharable $17 ""Baker's Board"" that presents pint-size variations of each plus fragrant Caramel Popcorn, a Chocolate covered Marshmallow plus Nutella Sandwich Cookie, the toughest question would be which to omit if one is unwilling or unable to taste all of them, the Chocolate Stout Layer Cake probably the safest answer as it is every bit as rich as it sounds and best shared by all but the most ardent Chocoholic.

Happy to see the Irish Coffee Cheesecake eat lighter than average while three piping hot Hand Pies are picture-perfect with caramelized grains of Sugar overlying a flaky crust alongside airy Cream all boozed up for dipping, fans of Beer will be impressed by the way in which Rebecca's Crème Brûlée manages to be both hoppy and sweet simultaneously with herbal notes added by toasted Poundcake, the Banoffee Parfait picking up where Carson Kitchen left off last Winter and perhaps even upping the ante by way of the Pretzel Crumble, Banana-Brown Sugar Jam and stick-a-spoon-up-straight Vanilla Pudding. 

Impressed four years ago by such an adventurous Gastropub on the Strip, some notable additions to the local dining scene having caught up and perhaps surpassed Public House in terms of creativity as well as value, it is relevant to point out that Block16 Hospitality has continued to push the envelope in an era where so many others seem content to rest on old accolades, the dessert menu here in many ways as good as those at Yardbird or Delmonico while the Beer list, Burger and Poutine are remain a consistent focal point for good reason.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,6,5,keO25ilm0FB-tI5wtkfsAw

We ordered the seafood appetizer platter (~$60) to share with some nice oysters, lobsters, shrimps etc but nothing really special. Also got the poutine fries (very good) and a pork chop entree. The pork chop was very dry, almost like they either didn't rest it or didn't put any sauce on it. we sent it back. you should probably stay away from that.

I typically don't complain about service, but this was a worth noting. Our server looks like a 21 year old with no experience. He had 4 tables to wait, one of which was empty yet somehow he was never around. He forgot our drinks menu until 10 minutes in (at a gastropub...seriously?), also forgot to get us extra utensils and condiments when asked repeatedly. At this point my party was getting pretty pissed off. Thinking he was a kid, I wasn't going to stiff him on tips but was socked to see there was an 18% gratuity added for our party of 4. guess he must have anticipated our irritation and preemptively struck. that was gutsy.

5317880,2012-02-14,3,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Just returned from Vegas and ate at the Public House during lunch over the weekend. They had a promotion from Groupon and it was a great lunch. 

We quite liked the ambience of the restaurant and it was a very classy place. I would imagine the bar area would be pretty jumping during a weekend night as they carry a significant number of beers from around the world and its perfect for beer drinkers.

We started our meal with crispy oysters with foie gras and it was delicious. The oysters (3) were on the smaller side, but it was a great one bite starter as the melted foie gras was pretty delicious underneath the oysters. We also had an order of pork rinds and they were great to snack on. 

For our mains, we had the burger and the braised short ribs. The burger was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request and it was very juicy and had good beef flavour. The thin cut shoestring herb fries were good too. I'm from Toronto, and it ranks up there with some of the better burgers I've had here. 

My gf had the short ribs and it was a big Wow for her. It was perfectly cooked and literally melt in your mouth good. It was accompanied by two fantastic onion rings on top of a bed of butternut squash puree. The short rib had great flavour and the jus it was served with made it the best short ribs dish my gf and I have ever had. 

The service was very friendly and the waitress was very knowledgeble. We weren't sure whether it was mashed potatoes that came with the short ribs, but our waitress informed us that it was butternut squash puree. You'll be surprised to know how many waiters/waitresses don't fully know the menu, so bonus points for her from knowing her stuff.

With the Groupon coupon ($25 for $50) and one beer and a generous tip totally $40. So including the $25 we spend buying the coupon, it was easily one of the better lunches we had for $65. It's a great place for a relaxed lunch with reasonable prices.

It's a place I would recommend for a pint and a burger without hesitations. They have a few other items that I would be interested in trying including the poutine, friend quails and waffle and etc.",muSL6_YBYoBN3k8BYUA__A,3,3,5,0BT9wvu6bhE5fAxQLhJ51Q
5319947,2014-01-03,3,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"I went here after a drunken New Year's Eve and I swore not to drink for the next few days. The though of alcohol was making me sick. Where do we get seated? Right in front of the ""Wine Shelter""! I just wanted to drink juice...pineapple juice. So, I looked at their drink menu from a tablet.  Alcohol, alcohol and more alcohol. Then I saw ""pineapple juice"" so that's what I got. It was beer brewed with pineapple juice and it was the tastiest beer (Mana Wheat)  I've had this year.

They had lots of good items on the menu but what I wanted to put to the test were the poutine and porchetta sandwich since I haven't found good versions of these dishes here in Vegas. We got poutine (appetizer portion), lobster roll, chicken sandwich and a porchetta sandwich. You can get your sandwich with fries or onion rings or poutine. 

Poutine:
Just like the good ol' Canadian way of making it: fries, cheese curds and gravy - but this had duck confit which made an already delicious dish even better. The fries were hot and slightly crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The cheese curds are melted somewhere in between those hot fries. The gravy was tasty. The duck confit was tender and perfect on the poutine. This has got to be the best poutine I've had - yup, even better than the ones I've had in Canada. Insane! 5/5

Lobster Roll:
Herbed coleslaw, lobster, butter lettuce on toasted brioche. I've had really good lobster rolls from New England and even here in Vegas - varying price tags too. I've also had awful lobster rolls. This was meaty. However, it has that watery mayo sauce that I'm not too fond of. It's still good but not my favorite. 3.5/5

Porchetta Sandwich:
Pork belly, salsa rossa, garlic aioli and arugula on a baguette. Porchetta is one of those things that makes me feel glad my beliefs don't prevent me from eating pork...if it's done right. This was really fatty and oily...and really delicious. The garlic aioli makes me less guilty for eating porchetta since garlic lowers your blood pressure. 5/5

The service was on point. Glasses were kept filled. The server was friendly, attentive but not annoying and was able to make good recommendations. This is a perfect place to nurse a hangover or to get a hangover!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,2,5,MI02YzvG2i4-nRz74PBsiA

Relaxing on the couch and having a conversation is a breeze here. Even though the area is packed, getting caught up in your neighbors' gossip is not an issue. 

The food is good, but expensive. Bacon wrapped dates came in an order of three for $6. Fried oysters were three for $13. Both were good according to my friends. What I did partake in was the poutine. Their version of the Canadian favorite is completely different then our friendly neighbors from the north. Shoestring fries, duck confit, cheddar cheese, a semi sweet gravy similar to a demi glaze, and a fried egg on top. They forgot our egg, but one of us gets sick from them anyways.

The selection of drinks is overwhelming, the food choices tempting. I settled on a drink called "" The Kramer""...it was deliciously strong with a mix of Phillips Union Vanilla (which I love straight), Chocolate Bitters, and Carpano Antica which I had no idea what it was but later found out it's a high end Italian Sweet Vermouth, so it was well worth the 12$. My husband got the Summer Dunkel which is Bourbon and Beer with a twist, I tasted it and it tasted like a Mary Jane or Squirrel Nut Zipper candy...yum! Friends tried some local beers since they are from way out of town (Scotland). 
I got some Devils on Horseback (blue cheese, bacon wrapped dates) to start, you only get 3 for 6$, they come with Melba toasts. they were good but I have had better. I also got the Scotch Egg (9$), it was amazing. The sausage was a little sweet and juicy, the egg was bright and fresh, all inside a nice crunchy outside. Not greasy at all, the Bacon Mustard dipping sauce was the perfect match. My husband got the Pub Burger (slathered in bacon marmalade and guiness aioli to name a few toppings), it was messy, flavorful, and cooked as ordered. Why can't all these burger joints around Vegas make a burger like this? The Herb Fries it comes with were crispy and scrumptious. Our friends got the Pork and Chicken sandwiches, they came with Herbed Fries too, the sandwiches looked good, the chicken sandwich was on a pretzel roll! They gobbled up their meals. The food was a little pricey, service was good, staff was pleasant. Nice atmosphere. The restaurant really filled up while we were there.

I got the roast bone marrow, I think like others have said is a must have, it is so delicious. It is so soft, delicate but packed with flavor and I loved adding the grilled onions to it. 

The other thing I got was the steak tartare, it was really good I like the plating of it and mixing all the elements on the plate really brings out great flavors, I would say the only slight negative (sounds like a first world problem) is that there is a bit more steak tartare than there is the other things on the plate so after awhile you'll end up eating only it.

I had the Pub Burger - all natural grass-fed beef, bacon marmalade, gruyère cheese, roast tomato, frisée, & guinness aioli.  It came with fries and I actually did the Poutine fries. I thought the fries were quite dry then found out on my 2nd visit that the sauce on the side was actually the gravy.  The waiter failed to tell me that the first time. But the fries were tasty.  And I loved the burger.  Nice juicy meat, cooked correctly.  Others had salads, shrimp cocktail, wings.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  

Other than the mess up on the poutine gravy, the service was good. Food was good.  Drinks were good. Definitely a fun place to go for food and drinks, especially if you are into beer.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,0,1,4,USuW13ghue8N4Fns90BgLw

About half of our party of 10 ordered the Caesar salad, and all of us felt that the salad was gritty. The waitress said it was because of the anchovies. However, of the hundreds of Caesar salads I've eaten in my life, none have ever felt to me like I was chewing sand. On the bright side, the waitress did not charge us for the Caesar salads. I also found it odd that the uniforms for all the hostesses showed so much cleavage--it created confusion about whether this was a classy restaurant or if we should have expected beer and wings.",fDtjztM_LZCKVfKXgbIZhA,0,0,3,iU4gNpLoVEXgHN12TO3I8g
5588424,2012-12-31,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"This has become our favorite low-key place to eat in Las Vegas. The service is almost always outstanding, the food is consistently great and they treat their locals well. 

 They update their menu seasonally (both food and drinks) so it's always interesting to see what new things have been added to the menu. We've tried lots of things but keep wandering back to the pub burger; it's the best burger I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

 Their cocktail list is extensive as is their beer menu; if beer is your thing, you can't go wrong here. I'm a fan of their cocktails; ""Death in the Afternoon"" and ""Sinister in the Fall"" are my favorites. 

 Las Vegas has a bad habit of training hostesses to pretend to be bouncers and so many times I've felt unwelcome when walking into a restaurant; Public House is completely the opposite and their hostesses always greet us warmly. They also have the most polite food runners I've ever encountered. The waiters and waitresses are all fantastic too (we usually ask for Steven or Sarah, but you can't go wrong with any of them). The overall attitude here is so positive and I find it really refreshing; that earns it top marks in my book.

 *I mentioned in my previous review that they offer a locals discount, though I'll admit it's a little confusing about how much it is and when you can get it. I figure it's because locals are less common in a place like this, not all of the servers are on the same page about it (very forgivable). I believe that locals get 20% off (with local ID) Monday through Thursday, but it's best to ask beforehand.",zaC3L_qy28bMLIvnoMng8Q,3,1,5,FSURjQZVMFab3ENgEAKLvQ

Public House is in ""Restaurant Row"" at The Venetian. It's below the Grand Canal Shoppes. Food is a bit on the spendy side, but it's presented well. 

This location has one of the best craft beer lists I've seen in Vegas. Not interested in what they have on draft? They have a large selection of bottles here, for every type of beer preference.

We came with a large group of 16 people, and our service was friendly and attentive. They made it easy to have some meals come out first (a few friends had tickets to a show), and split checks for different couples.

Public House is on the Restaurant Row at the Venitian. We were here for a late 3rd dinner meet up with work people for CES. It's a gastropub upscale sport bar & eatery inside the Venetian offering cask ale, 24 taps & a deep wine selection. 

Hot waitresses work here but not that friendly. 

My colleagues wanted to have a photo taken with her but she turned down twice. She was from India. We asked the manager, an older gent was nice to apologize and said she would, but she refused the second time. Kind of ruined the mood for my colleagues at that time. No big deal, the nice manager made up for it.

- The Burger was good and juicy.

- The Lobster Cobb Salad was good.

- Beer Brined Chicken Wings was good. 

We had a bottle of Sea Smoke Pinot Noir and Hitching Post, they were both good and well priced for Vegas. 

They offer a good list of Grand Cru Bordeaux & Burgundy from Petrus to Haut Brion, Mouton Rothschild to Cheval Blanc, and even a DRC. Use the corporate AMEX! 

Plenty of TVs for you to catch up on games. If I'm staying at the Venitian or the Palazzo, I come here but I'm not going out of my way to come here if I stay at other hotels.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,10,9,3,vrR4HVZFTIf3W4aVWH1HtQ

Located in the Venetian Hotel it is a hike to get to it. Completely PACKED on a Wednesday night the wait was over an hour. We decided to sit at the equally packed bar and snagged a belly bar. Great beer and wine list. We opted for a couple of appetizers instead of a full meal. We went for the Poutine and Shrimp and Grits. Both were very good. Portions are a good size but very pricey $12/$18 respectively. Was so crammed that it was hard to enjoy our $12 beer and $50 bottle of so so wine.

5674882,2012-11-28,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Let's start with the good:

The atmosphere.  Although I expected this place to be MUCH bigger, I really dug the decor.  I think it was really nice, although not as much of a ""pub"" setting, and really not as casual as I imagined.

The beer/wine/cocktail selection is offered on an iPad, so that is pretty cool.  I am a beer drinker, so it was great to have the entire collection available right at your fingertips, with as much (or little) information as you would like about the beer.  They also have their very own Cicerone, which is the beer equivalent of a Sommelier, which is pretty damn cool.  I didn't speak to said Cicerone, but I am sure he is awesome.  However, I was not impressed by their current draft selection, or the prices.  But alas, this is the Las Vegas Strip, and affordability may be asking too much.  I ended up ordering the Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest, so it is definitely nice to see them supporting a local brewery.

The poutine was amazing.  I've seen some complaints about the price ($10), however I don't think that is too much.  It is a pile of french fries, with cheese curds, duck confit and bordelaise sauce (apparently the Public House take on ""gravy"").  It is really salty, so beware.  Great with beer.  I would definitely come back for this alone.

The devils on horseback were also delicious.  These are bleu cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped dates.  The bleu cheese is REALLY strong (which is A-OK in my book), so some people may be caught off guard with this.  But anything with bacon is pretty amazing anyway you do it, in my opinion. :)

Now the bad (Sorry!):

Although it was a Monday night, and we arrived around 6:00pm, the lounge area was full.  The hostess asked if we would be having dinner or just appetizers. We said we were unsure, but were in a hurry and would probably just have appetizers.  She told us it was open seating in the lounge and to seat ourselves.  We turned around, to where there were obviously no seats and looked back at her, dumbfounded.  Luckily, the Manager happened to be standing next to her and told her to seat us in the EMPTY dining room.  She asked if we prefered a table or booth and we said booth.  She then said that all of the booths were reserved.  Um, OK....then why did you ask?  Anyhow, as I mentioned, we were in a bit of a hurry.  She led us to a small table for 2.  Otherwise, she was nice.

In addition to the items above, we also ordered the foie gras.  I was not a fan, and normally I LOVE foie gras.  I can't say what it is I didn't like about it....it seemed undercooked or just not as good as any that I've had before.  I would not order it again.

The service was good, but we had 1 server approach us, take our order, and then a few minutes later another server approached us and told us that Sarah had ""gone home because it was so slow,"" and that he would be taking over. So, ""where were we at?""  Obviously our server told him nothing, like the fact that we had already ordered, etc.  It was kind of weird.  But he was very attentive and nice.

Overall, I liked Public House.  It didn't totally live up to my expectations.  I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make a trip there.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,0,0,3,eUCNXuOAANb_g5xgfMJQ6g

Not to take anything away from the restaurant, it just has a more of a grab a few drinks and let's have a good time vibe.

Quite enjoyable, (but notice I have not returned for 2 years).  This time took my guy (DARK BEER LOVER).  We went Friday nite @ 10pm (Vegas ""come alive time"").  As we approached, the greeting gal snapped out ""dining room is closed, you can sit at bar if you want"".  We didn't 'want'.  Left for dinner at LAVO.
OK, we went back last night at daylight savings time..early 6-7 somewhere around there.  
ATMOSPHERE 3-4 STARS.  I like DARK, RICH DECOR,COZY- so much of Vegas suits me.
But with that said, I also like to sit with my man at my side, not at a 'mini 2-top' not big enough for two dinner plates.  So I refused the 2-top and opted for the 4-top next to it. Host didn't hesitate to move me when I asked. Good, because I refuse to pay high prices ever again and eat off a ""pedestal top"", constantly re-arranging plates and glasses to ""fit"".
FOOD & PRICE-  3-4 STARS.  We shared: Public House Caesar salad-$13, Public House burger & fries-$19, and side of sautéed mushrooms-$12, me red wine/ Zin $11, and my guy the 'Big & Dark Sampler' $17 (4-6 oz samples) We also had 1 crème Brulee $9 and a coffee- $2.95 TOTAL 90.75.
Salad so small it was like a cup of soup or less size each when divided. Dressing was so sour it made my mouth pucker and the bacon cut into little 1 1/2 inch strings and fried into 'glass shards', I could not chew it!  I hope it does not slice me on the way 'thru'.  I gave to my guy and he said it was impossible for him to chew. =FORGET IT!
Burger, good, but I was hungry.  Fresh bun and stewed tomato with dressing of sorts and lettuce-it was GOOD. I've had GOOD for much lower prices, BUT I knew the price going in.  I don't eat fries so can't judge, they were served in a small 6 oz or so s.steel cup.  Mushrooms very tasty, but I kept thinking of the giant tub in my fridge I got for $3.50- but hey- I didn't have to cook them and YES I pay for ATMOSPHERE- and I do understand the trend in Vegas, everything is 'GOURMET'. 
ZIN was ..good red zin.  Beer sampler a HIT (maybe the best deal, and yes I realize PH is famous for the HUGE beer menu). Brulee, average-good.
SERVICE- very attentive without aggravation. 
I would take guest here, especially if they were BEER LOVERS.  But, as I find myself saying:  VEGAS has SO MANY CHOICES, if it doesn't WOW me, I keep trying other places.

Roasted bone marrow $15 - 4/5 - Bacon, bone marrow, grilled bread, caramelized onions, served w/ grilled bread.  This was delicious.  The bone marrow combined w/ the caramelized onions is like smack of flavor hitting your taste buds.  

Grilled Octopus - $16 -  3.75/5 - potatoes, bell-pepper spices, and onions.  The octopus came out just right;  the texture was soft to bite into.  I was worried it'd be rubbery but that wasn't the case at all.  The octopus by itself is boring but if you combine it w/ the veggies, sauce, and the peppers it's almost like eating a fresh salad.  Very refreshing.

Grilled Frog Legs - $17 - 4/5  - Seasoned w/ butter, lemon, and served w/ tomatoes, and crutons.  Acidity of the lemon is offset w/ the butter to have a perfect finish.  Delicious!  Use the crutons to soak up the delicious sauce!

Scotch Egg  $9 - 3.5/5- The mustard used w/ the Scotch Egg was out of this world delicious.  If they bottled this mustard I'd buy it in a heartbeat!  The egg was a little lacking but still delicious.

Mussels $14 - 4.5/5- My favorite appetizer. Mussels, in a cream w/ Belgium beer, served with bacon, comes w/ a side of bread - The sauce used w/ the mussels was amazing.  The bacon combined w/ the mussels was delicious.  Use the bread to soak up the amazing sauce!

Short ribs - $29 - 4/5 - Braised short rib, green peas (in cream form), and 2 onion rings - The braised short rib was amazing.  So tender and flavorful.  You can cut this sucker w/ your fork!  The green peas were delicious too.  I'm not sure why the onion rings are here - I'd prefer something else to be honest.

Among many other things, the menu was refreshingly unique compared to the other options that skirt the strip and casinos, but then, the food was delivered by a personable server with some noteworthy and rare selections of wine & beer...the meal was SO good and the drinks made a perfect pair,

But wait...there's more. The next night we decided to take our clients here for drinks after our dinner meeting - we had about 40 in our party and the service, let alone the drinks and atmosphere were onpoint. The manager's and servers ensured everyone was taken care of and our client feedback was truly spectacular - sure, they were in good company but that was just icing on the cake in comparison to the incredible drinks, service, and atmosphere Public House provided.

Public House is located near Venetian Hotel, right in the middle of the convention centre.  We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow, the 3 Butcher Block - Potted Duck Rillette, Rabbit Loin in Porchetta and Devils on Horseback, Short Rib, Lamb Meatball Sandwich, Chicken Sandwich, Prime Rib French Dip and Public House Caesar.  I really, really like the Lamb Meatball - very moist sandwich.  The bread is soft and goes very well with the lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce.  The appys were very well done.  I found the Roasted Bone Marrow to be bland but when eaten with the bacon marmalade, gave it a different flavour altogether.  I found myself putting a lot of pepper on the Bone Marrow.  The 3 Butcher Block was great!  I liked all 3 of the items we selected.  The Caesar could do with more dressing and needs more flavour.

Happy Hour is only form 5pm-6pm.  So we didn't get much in the way of specials.  I checked in on Yelp and we got a free House Draft Beer.  It was good, but normal price is $10/pint.  I was getting Vodka & Lemonade (was cheaper during HH, had one at HH price), those are also $10.  Weak, it was more lemonade than anything else.  I know, it's Vegas, that's what they do, that's why you should not get mixed drinks in Vegas.  But that's what I wanted.

We also got the Poutine, it was pretty decent.  Not as good as a poutine you would get in Canada.  But pretty decent.  We passed on the sunny side egg.  Not necessary.

Also split the Burger, which was very tasty, $19, came with fries.  The burger was very, very juicy, actually caused a wardrobe malfunction for my boyfriend, but it dried enough that it didn't ruin his shirt.  Passed on the Egg for the burger too.  Everyone wants to put a runny egg on top of perfectly good meals these days.  It's not always a good add-on.  

We spent $104 before tip, for some drinks, one appetizer and one entree.  It's not cheap, but it's in the Venetian, not Hooters.  So, it is what it is.  The ambiance is nice.",rMwMXCEMn9i1wpAJj1S3dg,5,2,3,rtRppLyahizcQXkhClJ2NQ

5806965,2012-10-09,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Not to be confused with Public House at the Luxor; it seems that, since the name is a generic term, no one can lay exclusive claim to it. In any case, this place describes itself as a gastropub.

***The Menu***
Lots and lots of beer - more than 200 varieties. I counted 24 taps and 3 casks. Food offerings are more adventurous than those found at a typical bar - especially the appetizers. Thus, there is poutine, foie gras, bone marrow and octopus.

***The Atmosphere***
I sat at the bar, so my comments are restricted to that area. At 7 pm on a Saturday, it was moderately full, and got busier as the evening progressed. However, it never felt crowded, and even the loud rock music wasn't bothersome. It's a good place you can sit around, watch one of the television sports games, and talk to other patrons.

***The Food***
I decided on two appetizers, figuring that would make a light meal: poutine; bouchot mussels with beer, shallots, bacon and crème fraiche. Alcohol consisted of one bottle of Sam Smith's Pale Ale. The mussels were slightly gritty, and not especially plump. However, the rich sauce hid some of that, and there was plenty of toasted bread to sop everything up. Not good for a restaurant, but not bad for a bar. Now, about the poutine: for the uninitiated, poutine is a French Canadian dish made with french fries, cheese curds and gravy; other stuff is sometimes added. Public House's poutine consisted of: a very large bowl of thin, crisp french fries; a small amount of gravy; two modest pieces of cheese curd; a generous amount of duck; a fried egg (optional). This was the first time I had ever tried the stuff, so take my comments with a grain of salt*. However, I've got to believe there are better versions out there. This version was seriously lacking in cheese and gravy, yet still managed to be very salty.

(*As a native of Bawlmer, Merlin, I know that french fries are meant to be served with gravy only; cheese curds are for furriners.)

***Summary***
I liked Public House's atmosphere, and would consider returning for a beer or two. However, my first experience makes me wary of ordering food again. The problem may lie in expectations. Describing itself as a gastropub, I expected restaurant quality food; I got bar quality food. It might be best to order a small snack to go with your beer, and eat dinner elsewhere.

The meal was $27, plus drinks, tax and tip.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,0,3,PKNtrfJhAbY3-BItPJsMfg

As I was trying to figure out the iPad my waiter Mario arrived and saw I was looking for wine and having trouble so he just took over. I told him what I like in a white wine and he brought me a delicious glass of Paul Hobbs chardonnay and it was magnificent. It was all uphill from there.  
Once he returned with my wine and iced tea I asked him to suggest a few different items and told him I was in the mood for fish. He brought me ale brined wings to start and then the halibut fish n chips  Both were amazing. The wings were not your typical Hooters style buffalo, they were deep, smokey and tangy. The fish n chips was the BEST I'VE EVER HAD!  
While the food & drink was delicious, Mario was the real highlight of my visit to Public House.  He was knowledgeable about what he was serving (as all servers should be) but it was his warm friendly personality that made my visit special. He actually engaged me in conversation and told me several really funny jokes. A couple of times his friend Shana joined in and they both had me in stitches. If you dine alone as often as I do you know just how welcome a pleasant, funny server can be. Btw Mario is pretty easy on the eyes too.
Mario made such a positive impression that later in the weekend I took some friends to Public House for dinner but when we found out Mario wasn't working that evening we chose Table 10 instead. Shame too because I was looking forward to trying something new.  
To sum it up, Public House is a must dine on your next trip to Vegas if you can get past the fact that it's in a building that Sheldon Adelson owns. And when you visit I highly recommend you ask for a table with Mario or Shana.",Jc54w6U_jM82SbwrqDs7Pg,0,0,5,cmsnuj8UgcRKw7eDvKhGPA

Two things that should get you excited about this place is:
1. Cask Beer
2. Poutine

We came here because I had a Groupon.. Thank God we had one because a good dinner and drinks will set you back about $150.00 easy. However you can go the Pake (Cheap Chinese) way and split an entree (large plate) since they are decent size. 

As mentioned earlier, they have cask beer as well as a HUGE array of wine a beer all of which that can be ordered off of their ipad menu. +1 * for techiness.

Here is what we had

Poutine
Absolutely amazing! Lots of tasty smoked duck meat and a awesome home made gravy. Not the packed brown crap but sticky homemade awesomeness! THIS IS A MUST EAT HERE!!!!

Lamb chop
We ordered it medium rare. It came out with a nice char and still maintained a nice red center in the cut. The red wine reduction was an awesome addition to the flavor and complimented the meat very well.

Creamed corn lobster.
Very good side dish! Lots of lobster in the dish not just there for namesake. It came out with a layer of cheese browned on top of it. This was a very welcome change to texture and flavor!. Not your average cream corn that comes from the jolly green giant!



Service and wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable . Our server had a good knowledge of the beer and menus selections. It's always comforting to hear an honest opinion when you are asking about menu items. 



Overall it was a good experience. The restaurant has very good ambiance by itself however like most casino restaurants, they don't discriminate on the patrons dress code so Bobby Joe and Bubba in their cut off T-shirts and holy jeans really detract from the ""zen"" ambiance and atmosphere that they are going for.

He took the time to answer our questions about the menu and made great recommendations for my friend and I. He was also very attentive throughout our meal. 

I ordered the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese to start. OMG. Amazing. They were a mouthful of warm, sweet, salty, bacony and blue cheese goodness!! For $6 you get 3 of them. I was tempted to order a second plate of it but I didn't want to ruin my dinner. For an entree, i got the organic free range chicken. The waiter said it wasn't really necessary to order a side bc it came with mushrooms and farro. It was SO good. The plate had 3 pieces of chicken on top of the farro with mushrooms and sauce. I forgot the name of the dish that my friend ordered but it was sort of like a shepards pie with a twist. There were 3 empanada/dumpling style things - this took place of the crust. And inside them was lamb mixed with a sauce and some veggies. And the 3 pieces lay on top of a potato puree with another sauce. I tried some and it was great and I don't even like lamb!! She said she really liked it. She also got a side of grilled asparagus which was also very good! We were both really really happy with our meals.

Overall, it was a pleasurable dining experience. I highly recommend this place if you want great food!!

I ordered the short ribs..you gotta order the short ribs. They are so tender and  comes with a delicious sauce that's definitely not diet friendly, but AMAZING. It comes a butternut squash puree that  has the texture of mashed potatoes but a little lighter (deceptively so, I assume).

We perused the drink menu for quite some time before deciding on our drinks for the evening. This is no easy feat with the enormous beer, wine and mixed drink selection options they have. I ordered The Blonde and my fella decided on the Banana Bread beer. The drinks came out and everyone kept raving about the Banana Bread beer being their favorite. I wanted nothing to do with it since I don't like the smell or banana, but my fella was quite excited. He tasted it and by the look on his face, he was no as impressed as everyone else seemed to be. My drink, on the other hand, was amazing. My fella even admitted that mine was far superior to his. Haha. I eventually did try the Banana Bread beer out of curiosity and although it wasn't my favorite beer ever, but it wasn't bad. 

For food we shared a few small plates. We got the bone marrow, bacon wrapped figs and the grilled octopus. I have to admit the items we ordered didn't blow me away, but I see potential on the food front. The octopus was a little fishier than I'm used to and I guess I was hoping for a chewier texture. It was just a little different than the octopus I'm used to. The bacon wrapped figs weren't a favorite of mine either. The dressing was just overwhelmingly sweet and I wished that the bacon was just a little crispier to add a less mushy texture to the whole dish. The bone marrow was probably my favorite. It was fatty and fuil of flavor. I was definitely impressed with the restaurant overall and look forward to going back and trying a number of other beers that they offer. I'm also interested by quite a few more options on the food menu that I think hold potential. 

The best part of our dining experience was the service. It was the deciding factor between giving this place a 3 and a 4. Our waiter and busboy were incredibly attentive and every server who brought a drink or plate to our table made pleasant conversation and had a great attitude. To top it all off we had a great conversation with the restaurant manager / sommelier.. He was extremely gracious. We will definitely be back... and soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,3,4,92k9v-hW12TXL_CnC0I46Q

We were greeting immediately.  The server knew the beer selection better than the ipad they gave us that had the beer and wine menu loaded on it.  We did not need any help selecting the appetizers, we immediately picked the Pierogies (beef 'tongue & cheek' filled, sriracha, green onion, butter sauce) and the Roasted Bone Marrow (bacon marmalade, grilled bread).  Both were outstanding.

We skipped the salads because the dessert menu looked too good to pass up.

Our two dinner entree's were again outstanding.  The wife ordered the Short Rib (""descHutes black butte porter"" braised, carrot mousseline, Heirloom carrots, ipa battered onion ring ) and I had a taste for steak so I ordered the Dry Aged Rib-eye (bone in) and it was one of the best steaks that ever slid past my tongue.  I added the onion/bacon marmalade and ordered a side of Forest Mushrooms adding more goodness to an already perfect meal.

Dessert did not disappoint.  The Creme Brulee (Pear Butter, Feuilletine Crumble, Milk Chocolate Sorbet) I ordered was perfect and the wife's Croissant Bread Pudding (Bananas Foster Sauce, Toasted Cinnamon Ice Cream) just sealed the deal as one of the best meals we have shared in our 26+ years together.

I know it is difficult to choose a place to eat on the strip but if you are looking for a gastro pub with a very inventive menu this is the place.

Food, drinks and service are always exceptional! This trip was no different. Whether you're stopping in for a quick drink or staying for a full meal, the crew at the Public House make you feel welcome. Our favorite bartenders Frank and Christopher kept our drink glasses full and kept us laughing with funny stories. The drink recommendations were top notch and I look forward to drinking/eating there again!",S4092V9f7VhhXEuVYJc4Yw,0,0,5,ud7TasWJsFRDccC8aCVpYA

I loved the joint: quaint, relaxing ambience, intimate. The staff engaged with excellent service, and although we beat the oncoming lunch rush, service to our table did slow down a bit as it targeted a larger spread; understandble. Bathrooms clean and stocked. Good review so far huh? That's where most of the stars go to.

The food was good. Don't get me wrong. If someone suggested eating here again though, I'd likely suggest a different spot because, well this is Vegas and it's just drowning in new places to get your Noms on. 

With Boothang and I being appetizer nerds, we immediately put our hands down for the Foie Gras and Roasted Bone Marrow. We've definitely had our fix on some bomb ass decadent foie gras, but unfortunately it wasn't this one. It was served cold with an assortment of jams on a tiny bed of bread sopping in balsamic. The flavors and textures melded well, but nothing slapped my face in amazement. I like to be slapped in the face. The bone marrow was bomb, as bone marrow always is. If you haven't tried bone marrow before, it may not be a terrible idea to get it here, because it was probably the most enjoyable part of our lunch experience here. Just lather that oily melting goodness onto your grilled bread and you're good to go. It came with caramelized onions too, also very yums in accompaniment with the marrow, but don't put too much or you'll loose your appreciation for the fatty goodness of marrow. With that said, the best bone marrow I've experience had nice grilled crusty bread, with just wedges of lemon along with the well roasted and salty marrow... the very things to enhance marrow.

For lunch, Boothang had the French Dip Sandwich, which he very much enjoyed. I feel you can never go wrong with a bunch a thinly sliced beef, melted provolone, wedged between bread and dipped in a salty beefy au jus, but the bread was what made this sandwich a winner. Extremely soft, not too bready, not overly toasted but enough that each bite had a crispness to it. Bomb in my opinion. 

I was craving fresh cold seafood like a mother, so I decided to get myself the the petite seafood platter $58 supposedly to share between 2-3 people as an appetizer. It was fine, but a bit overpriced for what it was. The oysters were tiny and didn't seem too fresh. The shrimp were large and plump... almost the same size as the mini lobster tail. Poke was good, but not your typical poke; it was tangy and briney from the capers. It was a good portion for someone that was eating lunch, however, for $60, I could go to my local fish market (I live in San Diego) and get all the same foods at a higher quality seafood for half the price. I'm a seafood head, and this was a bit of a disappointment. 

All in all, I didn't enjoy this jam as much as I thought I would. Again, like many reviews, this is quite subjective to the fact we came here solely for lunch and did not try any steaks which seemed to be a popular fix on the menu. Although money isn't too much of an issue, this time around, $130 for lunch that was ""ok"" got me walking away like ""Meh... next time let's do In-N-Out"".",eEKPfJ-UCn0jiWcLUS_ixA,2,0,3,p_1SFnl9s-6veYEAxoBSpw
5966444,2016-01-23,1,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"Friendly staff. My boyfriend and I walked in and greeted immediately. We had multiple options to sit in the lounge, dining area, or the bar. The lounge area is great for appetizers and drinks. We sat in a booth in a dining room. They have very nice decor. I ended up ordering the French dip for lunch. It was a good size sandwich I couldn't even finish it. I would just wish the au jus would have now flavor but still very good. The season on the French fries are completely addicting I couldn't stop once I started. I had a bite of my boyfriends meatball sandwich and it was soooo good highly recommend. The service was fast, polite, and very attentive. This is a decent priced restaurant compared to what kind of casino it is.",N2arP_u4sMGLgOZhA6ZFoQ,3,2,4,SDklOQ0q1-JDnkzdjQIYVA
5969859,2015-04-18,0,3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA,"One word - disappointing.  I was taken here on a business lunch at the ISC show held at the Sands. 
Our wait for a table was 10 min which was very nice and allowed us have a quick drink and relax. 
Our party of four was seated at. Nice table ( lunch time about 70% filled). We were not offered a beverage. After a short 10min wait our server prompted Us For lunch orders. We backed them down to a drink (soda) and water. 
The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time but it was not even mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which had some ham and cheese on it as well It was completely cold. It came with fries. I always look forward to that first HOT fry. Mine were totally cold as were another persons in our party. Another member of our party has the wedge salad which she described as the worst ever.  
Nobody checked on us during our meal so we could not request warmer food or give feedback.  
This is not an inexpensive place.
The bar selection and staff are great. I recommend avoiding the restaurAnt.  There are so many other AND better choices.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,1,1,2,JAkFyhB8NYv973rLXtXEsg
