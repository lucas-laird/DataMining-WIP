I love it when employees at Panda Express hook me up by putting a little extra food! Earns a star for me because to me, that is excellent customer service, and it never hurts to put a little more and be generous!",OXTECc-hei5D-ONm39rwNA,0,0,5,YSaDcAMq4fa6MOax6aN6xQ

They give out pretty good portions and will let you taste anything you want. The noodles are decent but the fried rice batches are small so they are usually pretty fresh. 

Orange chicken is the go to like with many of the pandas.",Ws1k3isDsv8P1R5n7T1TKQ,0,0,5,a8guViV9NDPnIiJf8veYQA

No complaints about the food or service but when in Vegas, go to the buffets.
This place is across from the NYNY in a food court and open late but go somewhere else.",F2av57ztcbYiPADtT-YpdA,2,0,3,AXguLGdvPHmaNI9NwgTnUQ
