1980393,2018-05-06,6,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,I do not suggest this place. The food made my husband and I sick and when I let the waitress and owner know they did not give a shot and had no sympathy and charged us anyways for the leftovers. Staff were very rude and disrespectful. We will not be coming back to this shit hole.,AdsiW7xnTixwI4uqNc2n3Q,0,0,1,IDdD1BKkBNleB4DezL01-w

2861026,2018-06-16,2,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"Pretty happy with this new place! We had a craving for sushi and decided to try it out after seeing a ""hot and new!"" Ad for it on Yelp. I was going back and forth between 4 stars and 5, but the new, different appetizers and rolls made it!

Location: 
pretty central, and close to UNLV. I live on the East side and didn't mind the drive. Easy to get to and when we got there for dinner, the area had lots of parking spaces available. 

Atmosphere: 
Smaller area & Casual with an open vibe (lots of windows make up 2 of the 4 walls), dark floors/tables. A mix of chairs and stools against the wall. Similar to Sakana. There's a bar towards the front that seat about 6 leopl

Service: 
our waitress and the chefs were very friendly! Our waters were always refilled in a timely manner and when our waitress was busy, one of the chefs brought it to our table. It did take some time to get some of our rolls/appetizers, but luckily the vibe was calm in the restaurant which made us less impatient. 

Food: 
THIS is what gets the stars. The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is generous and awesome! And Honestly, it was the variety of different appetizers & rolls that other restaurants rarely have that they do. 
-Cucumber rolls! (Rolls wrapped in cucumber rather than rice)
-Ono Special box roll! 
-Hirata bun (pork belly in baos)
-Pork Belly Taco
-Poke Tacos
-Seared salmon miso nigiri
-Scalloped wrapped in bacon skewers (others have this, but here it's much bigger in size and Less burnt crispy)
-Fried octopus (better than crispy calamari!) 
-Takoyaki 
-Truffle fries
Price: 
Similar to other AYCE sushi places, but actually a bit cheaper. Other places I've been to charge as high as 26.95 for dinner and here it is 24.98! Way better deal and still a good sushi experience. 

I would definitely try this place out at least once and try something that you wouldn't have been able to try at other places. :)",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,4,3,5,mOpeI1ghT-xjfoOV60LVug
3103657,2018-06-21,0,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,This is my new favorite spot! I work around the corner and get lunch here regularly. The food and atmosphere is great. Perfect to enjoy on a lunch break or a quick pick-up. Everyone is super friendly and prices are hard to beat! My favorite to pick-up is the poke bowl which comes with a side salad and soup all under 10 bucks. You cant beat that! I highly recommend!,q51QiCJQAywJBVQxr-TpPg,0,0,5,vtFocxtwzUG0c5_FyZrD9A
3250756,2018-06-12,4,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"Was craving AYCE sushi, and I happened to see this place on Instagram so my wife and I decided to check it out. 

They have a huge selection of starters as well as skewers, rolls, and nigiri. I could be here all night trying everything on their menu. The fish quality was excellent, and the sweet shrimp and Hokkaido scallop nigiri were some of the best I've ever had at an AYCE joint! The fish to rice ratio is great, a lot of fish and not much rice! I had to try the super rainbow roll with shrimp tempura and colorful tobiko after seeing it on the 'gram, and that was really tasty. We really enjoyed the hamachi kama as well. It was super juicy, and the side of ponzu sauce was fantastic! We also tried their salmon skin salad, octopus salad, udon, the sushi donut, Sunkist roll, and the Orange Blossom roll, and everything was delicious! Wish we could have eaten more, but we were stuffed! 

For $25 per person and with all the variety of items on their ayce menu, you really can't go wrong here. The decor is modern, and the restaurant is very clean and has an open feel to it. We'll definitely be back to try some of their other stuff.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,10,8,5,BgZOZm-VR1winL-u62SMFA

I love all the different options for food(great choices for sushi lovers and non) and the unique sushi rolls.

3875986,2018-05-09,2,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"Each time I try to find a AYCE sushi buffet in Vegas that can live up to my standard (Goyemon), I fail miserably. Ono had just opened up and recently offered a 30% off opening weekend discount. We missed this by a day, but snagged the 10% off with Yelp check-in. AYCE dinner was $25. 

The menu had a multitude of starters to choose from including bulgogi fries (soggy), and a number of yakitori to choose from. You're limited to 1 skewer per person, but I enjoyed the mushroom option.

As for the nigiri, they have your standard fare, with the exception of quail egg, which I thought was more unique. One time orders included the ocean trout (which we never received), uni, amaebi (sweet shrimp with separate head presented fried), and oyster when seasonably available. Disappointingly, they were mostly out of the salmon belly nigiri except for one order (which was tasty). More unforgivable was the fact that many some of the fish came served with bones and even scales still attached. I've never experienced this before at a sushi restaurant, even for an AYCE place. We tried one specialty roll, the baked salmon, which was not at all what we imagined and I'm not sure if it was even exactly baked. 

For dessert, the ice cream was rock hard. They were also out of the lychee sorbet and most of the mochi. Also if there is such a thing as too much service. The number of table touches by our waiter was borderline interruptive to both our meal and our conversation. Hopefully this was just a case of growing pains from a new restaurant and they improve, but not worth the cost of AYCE IMO.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,11,2,2,2a6xhi5ICBkU4X3QHoOkNQ
4051772,2018-06-13,0,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,Opened a few months ago.  Had their AYCE and other friends had the ramen and udon.  Ramen soup base and chasiu was good.  Sushi was fresh and had good variety.  Will come back.,8GZ-Bp16VUlaUnFn4zhg8Q,0,0,4,7GDyXt8ilrz_JH6KvSScWg
4061435,2018-05-20,4,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"Recently opened and they're operating like they've been in business for awhile...I'm a fan...

Ono Service: For a new restaurant, I was really impressed with the kitchen who got our ayce orders out quickly.  The servers stopped by the table frequently to keep the drinks fresh and to check if wanted to put in more orders.  

Ono Sushi: The nephew fired away on all the deep fried rolls with lots of extras and everything I sampled was tasty and heavy.  I stuck to the nigiri with my niece and the rice to fish ratio is great!  Looking pretty close to 2:1 on most of the nigiri I ordered.  The fish was fresh and the salmon was especially tasty for me. We ordered extra salmon because I'm extra.  Dessert options of ice cream, sherbets, honey toast and mochi are there for after.

Ono Ambiance:  Contemporary asian decor with one main open dining area with a small sushi bar that seats around 6. The two glass walls make the dining area appear larger than it really is. I saw some picnic type tables to accommodate parties of 6+. Nicely decorated where a casual quiet date night is totally doable.  

Overall this is another great ayce sushi option in Vegas on the east side of town.  I'm looking forward to checking out their ramen and other non-sushi dishes when I don't have time for ayce but that's another yelp tale.  Enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,8,3,4,8SbEkMULT9KARvbwLrN-4w
4106767,2018-06-06,0,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"Another good AYCE sushi place in Vegas. It seems like each time I'm back in town a new spot has opened, and this one is the most recent I have found. It also happens to be right by my office! 

AYCE dinner is about 25 dollars, which is inline with most places. Currently, it doesn't seem like there is anything on the menu excluded or limited qty for that amount. We tried a bunch of their sushi, and it was all pretty good. Some items like the lemon shrimp were unique but tasty, while things like their spicy ahi rolls are exactly what you would expect on the menu, and hit the mark.

The staff were super friendly, and service was quick. And they have a sushi bar if you prefer that over a table+server.

They even have honey toast!",_LF2eG3ZHQeKH8KKmguRHA,1,1,4,mW4n6dBy34NCf4g6no6sfA
4802543,2018-05-09,2,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"I actually found this place because Yelp sent me a notification and gave it a go. It did not disappoint, that's for sure! This is now my favorite AYCE sushi place! It's also close to UNLV.

There's a ton of stuff to order from the menu and everything that I've tried so far has been delicious. Salmon belly is my go-to and it was so buttery! It may be crossed out on their menu, but don't hesitate to ask if they have it that day!

I also tried their lemon salmon (it's seared) and it's my new favorite. Anything salmon is delicious, period. Their appetizers and starters take up one part of their menu. I didn't get a picture of it but their bulgogi tacos and takoyaki is delicious. I'm surprised they had takoyaki on their menu. Everything was flat out amazing. Food, service, and atmosphere = amazing.

Their customer service is also good because they constantly come and check on you. The restaurant is easy to find and plenty of parking space.

It turned out to be a great idea lunch is 20 which is cheaper than most ayce sushi places. The have a big selection of starter food. I got the salmon kama which was very moist and tasty, poke taco which comes in two and that was very good the shell was a little to hard for my taste but was good.  Had the fries oyster comes with one and that was so so. Squid, chicken,and octopus karage were all good nice light batter and crispy I didn't care much for the octopus but the other two were very good.  We also had the salmon skin salad very good nice flavor to it and the house salad which came with a light ginger based sauce very good also.  I got the salmon skin hand roll and it was so good I had to get another one. They had takoyaki there so of course I had to try it and this is probably the best I had out of all the ayce places that offer it.  The agedoshi tofu is nice small pieces and flavorful sauce. Tempura veggies is good lightly battered and crispy.  They also offer alot of other things like pork belly but that is for next time we come.  As for the sushi we got the lemon salmon nigiri which is seared thumbs up. Hamachi and yuzu hamachi nigiri both very good. The Saba nigiri was very good also.  The unagi nigiri was soft and tender. The great thing about the nigiri here is the slices of fish are bigger than the amount of rice that is used so for those who prefer big pieces of fish and hardly any rice this is the place for you. For dessert I got the lychee sorbet because I wanted yuzu sorbet and they were out. My son got the mini honey toast it comes with vanilla ice cream but you can substitute the ice cream with a different flavor and my son did with red bean.  We will definitely be coming back again.",2-01LlVLrCujcL1kT2Xchw,0,0,5,gNrYTMTdGvzQihvXZEgong

I mean, I have to say that this place is the best AYCE Sushi ever!! 

My wife and I decided to go to vegas for our trip this time, and we came across this place through Yelp. They just recently opened a few months ago, so we decided to give them a try for our lunch time.
And gosh, literally everything that we ordered were all AMAZING!! From appetizers, sashimi, hand rolls, specialty rolls, and even the desserts were all delicious! Hands down . My fav ones are seared lemon salmon, miso seared salmon, spider hand roll, rolls royce, orange blossom rolls, sexy lady baked rolls (i think), and also lychee sorbet. What makes them even better is that they don't put too much rice on the sashimi. 

So, if you're in vegas or maybe plan to go to vegas, make sure to try this place out! I will definitely come back again anytime we had a chance to go to vegas. Keep up the good work ONOsushi! You guys awesome!",VPtphQfiSPpJlHco1_AdNg,1,0,5,cPGMs8bOTi4zeKcr0wUdkQ
5967413,2018-05-06,12,dlpVK3a2Xfn6jtq5-soAfw,"I know what you're thinking...another AYCE sushi place right? WRONG! This place is more than just sushi, way more. Under their starter section - Seafood Nachos, Bulgogi French fries,  Pork Belly. They have a skewer section - Asparagus Wrapped Bacon, Shrimp. Then you have their sushi selections (OF COURSE)- Tuna hand rolls, Lisa Lisa, Shrimp Lover Roll, First Kiss Roll, Popcorn Shrimp Roll and their beautiful SUPER RAINBOW ROLL. Don't ask where all of this fit in my petite frame, just know it did. All of the dishes that hit my table were fresh and BOMB! Yes, they were all BOMB!! My daughter even ventured out of her norm tuna hand rolls to try some of my sushi rolls and she loved them.

I live out in Summerlin so making the trek out this way on their opening night was bit of a mission for me, but I am so proud of myself for doing it. We arrived right before the dinner rush so service was overly attentive and I have to stress overly because as soon as dinner time arrived, service was still attentive even with the place packing in. Samvy and her crew touched all tables and I loved that. It shows they work as a team to keep up the customers continuously happy. Samvy was full of energy and so welcoming from the moment we stepped in. 

Prices as you can see are no where outrageous and they can do half rolls so you can enjoy more of the options as they have many to choose from. They have a huge picnic style table in the middle of the dining room for big parties and about 11 - 2 top and 4 top tables along with sushi bar seating. I can't wait to go back and bring my family when they visit next month!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,20,19,5,2QOIYKxQZ-SNOWEQBPYvIw
