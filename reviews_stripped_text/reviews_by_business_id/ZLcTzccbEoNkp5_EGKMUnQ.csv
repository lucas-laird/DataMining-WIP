81588,2017-06-12,0,ZLcTzccbEoNkp5_EGKMUnQ,With all the pools available in Vegas this one is a strange mix of people and service could use some training. From the elderly to a large amount of kids I don't know that I'd have a reason to return. The pool is shallow and not very big. Service was very slow and our cabana was dirty with leftover trash from the previous day.,EogqX5ZVx3l49ntnV272zQ,1,0,3,1O5PK5kGZuZoS12_Ve7lLg

Got there at 10:30 and it was absolutely fantastic!  Our server Ashley greeted us as soon as we were taken to our cabana by our Cabana Host Tammy.  Tammy was super attentive to all my emails leading up to our stay.  Ashley was very attentive and checked back every 15-20 minutes to see if we needed anything. When we ordered lunch, she made the guac (was sooo good) right next to us as we were hanging in the pool and allowed us to eat while still in the pool.  She recommended the Egg Salad sliders and those were surprisingly really good. My parents ordered chicken tenders and crab sliders- they loved both of those.  I was worried about the pool temp bring to warm since its been in the 100*s out here, but it was perfect! The pool started to get crowded about 1:30 so that's when we decided to go over to the Mob Museum. When we came back to our cabana, Ashley immediately met us and took our drink and food orders.  Everything we ordered was delicious: chicken skewers, shrimp fritters, mini chicken sliders, marinated shrimp, and chips & guac again.  The pool deck is pretty slippery and to go to the restroom is a bit of a walk. In all, we would definitely book a cabana here again as it was clean, well-maintained, absolutely outstanding service from Ashley, and awesome food!",XMVw5HNzPv2TSAXugzJcVw,3,0,5,jOaMxJmdmncmLlMiaWYdyQ

No towels (which he could of mentioned since we checked in at the towel stand) or introduction to a server. We got our towels and set them up and proceeded to stand around for about 15 minutes to get waited on. Took about a half hour to finally get our drinks. After that service was great. Probably because we were not holding back on $$$$. 

The pool itself is pretty small. 4ft deep all around with a ledge to sit on. It's on the rooftop so the view is nice. There was a mix of people and way too many kids. I got really sick of seeing water wings and goggles. I personally don't think a casino pool is a place for that. The DJ wasn't bad . Played a lot of old school wrap/pop along with a few 2017. 

We ordered beef sliders, chicken lavosh, and a shrimp citrus Caesar salad. Everyone enjoyed their food. No complaints at all. Prices on cocktails are good for a Vegas pool. Probably one of the cheapest places. I would go back for lunch but not to hang out at the pool.",8Ox2EA8A7FVSzVEM3TRn7Q,3,0,3,IiBKGctvZPI4ihvMbhndHA

The place had a great atmosphere. The wifey and I were there when Zapos did a pool take over. The had a DJ, fashion show, drink specials, Quicksilver was there with a cabana and was giving away free drinks. Pretty darn cool.

Also, they had a bottle service that was BOGO. WTH? That never happens at a pool in Vegas. The same went for the buckets of beer. 

The wifey and I plan on coming to this place as long as possible.

If you arent there when pool opens good luck.    Everyones towels sprawled out over the couches too leaving no room for anyone else on lounges or sofas with those shade umbrellas.  They had space they could have opened up to make more room, but they didnt.  The pool isn't that special.   It's just a pool on a deck with sitting spaces in bright colora around it.  I went back twice to see if any space under an umbrella was avail.  Nope!

I can't be out in direct sunlight for long with my radiated skin even with sunscreen but I definitely needed to be where it felt like summer escaping the doom grey of Seattle.  I needed to get a good 1-2 hours to just relax.  I thought the pool would be the spot.   That didnt happen on my 3 night stay.

I paid my resort fees to be able to use the pool. Seemed like guests had their friends joining them that werent guests taking up space other guests could have had.

Maybe guests should have to provide proof of being a guest to access the pool to be fair.  OR friends of guests need to pay.  I felt gyped.

I came to relax post radiation and celebrate my bday on a solo adventure.  It was the worst vacation.  I have the right to give my opinion.

Lesson learned...get to the pool at opening and stake out your spot.

I won't reccomend here.  They can definitely improve who can and cannot access.  Anyone can walk in..go up and head straight out to the pool

2172186,2016-08-24,12,ZLcTzccbEoNkp5_EGKMUnQ,"On the rooftop pool of the Downtown Grand Hotel: *Daytime pool party vibes*, but not as CRAY the day I came. YAY okay :) 

I came by here last weekend and enjoyed my time here relaxing, grubbing, drinking, and jumping into the pool. They had a DJ playing music which was awesome to enjoy while chilling in our cabana. 

The weird thing is our group rented out a private cabana and was told to come at 11:00am, and nobody was there to help us. We had to ask a bartender and they told us which cabana to head to and we waited there for a while. It took 30 minutes to get serviced from our server Chanel. She ended up being really sweet, despite the lack of a welcoming upon arrival. When Tammy (Pool Sales Coordinator) finally came by later she was super friendly and awesome. 

The cabana was nice and allowed for privacy with closable side curtains.. the perfect escape to cool down to beat the heat. The cabana area itself is huge and comes with mini fridge.. lots of nice seating.  For our cabana we opted for John Daly pitchers (frozen lemonade and sweet tea vodka, buckets of beer: Shock Top and Angry Orchard, FOOD: whole watermelon, assorted sliders (wagu beef, grilled chicken, egg salad, and chilled crab), beef skewers, chicken wings, chicken tenders, and shrimp fritters. The only bummer was there were bees galore going on the watermelon and directly on the sliders etc, so we had to be regulators and trapped some to control the buzzin'. Overall, we probably caught five+ and had cages for them in the clear cups.. yikes! 

-beautiful decor and set-up 
-gambling opportunity outside on the table 
-private cabanas were awesome! 
-just meet the minimum requirement and enjoy all the food and drinks!
-great menu selection~ 
-decent pricing for everything
-good service: bussers/servers were efficient and nice 
-pool was small, but decent 4ft and water felt semi-heated! ahh could have been colder
-plenty of restrooms which were very clean

The drinks are cheap and the scenery is pretty good for an old(er) dude like me, where all the girls are almost attainable. I mean, when you go to all the other super hip pools with all the cool kids, the beer belly just ain't a selling point - it will fly here. Leave your six packs at home.

As I mentioned, the drinks are surprisingly affordable for a Vegas pool, but you do need to remember that you are a bit off the beaten path when it comes to LV. There was a DJ playing but it was simply to keep the mood of the pool going rather than it being the main draw of the crowd. They didn't charge us a cover and in all honesty I don't think we were supposed to be there since we weren't hotel guests. The security guards were nice enough to let us take in a couple of quick cocktails and peep the place out since I think it was clear that we weren't going to make a day out of it.

2819963,2017-07-02,0,ZLcTzccbEoNkp5_EGKMUnQ,"One of the reasons we stayed at the Grand was for the pool deck.  It has to be one of the best pools in downtown Vegas.  Please note that cabana minimums changed based on day of the week, etc.  It is worthwhile to get a cabana because you get a place to hang that is comfy.

They serve food on the deck along with drinks.  Service was a little slow so that dropped the stars to four vs. five.  We were able to meet some folks from WI and IL so it was fun to meet some other folks.

They have refreshing water out there as well because it gets really hot on the deck.  The pool is your savior so dip in and then get out back into the sun.  If you are staying at the hotel you don't need to bring your towels.  Also, they have DJ's spinning and live music at night so this place is jumping!

Also, there are coupons for the deck if you are staying there.  For us, we had such a nice stay that next time we will only stay at the Grand.  Their comps programs are awesome and they have great service.",akiIhaV0vVVfDwEozKZxEw,2,2,4,Tlva5Powcy29qPSeM3e3mg

This is the perfect alternative to the pool scenes on the strip. This spot is located on the roof of the Downtown Grand and as far as I can tell it's free! Although, you can rent private cabanas if you're looking for that, ""chic, clubby pool vibe"" or you can just go cheap and hi-jack multiple lawn chairs and create an awesome poolside fort. 

There are kids running around here, but it's not like a daycare and most everyone here is local, a big plus for me. They also have a full bar and serve food until seven at night. The drinks here will run you a little more than the norm, but nothing insane, about six to ten dollars depending on the drink. 

The pool is pretty small, it's more like a very large hot tub than a small pool, but really you're in this thing to escape the heat, get refreshed and possibly pee. Ha! The Pool Deck is a great way to entertain some out-of-town friends and get your bronze bruh.

The area features lots of cabanas, fake grass, table games, picnic benches in the shade, misters everywhere, a nice long bar, a DJ and a raised pool (on the small side). Tack on $5-6 brews, $7-8 cocktails and it makes for a nice place to have a drink with some friends. Not bad!

That being said... Warning!
When we walked in (Saturday @ 3pm), a security guard asked if we were hotel guests. When we said no, he was going to tell us to leave, but instead let us in when we said we were local and just wanted to see the place and grab a drink. I'm not sure if that means that it's OK to grab a drink here, or that this place will be for hotel guests only.

""Picnic Restaurant is open for lunch daily from 11am to 5pm.

Access to non-hotel guests is available with the purchase of our Picnic Day Pass, which includes the use of the facilities as well as a well cocktail or beer of your choice. Prices are Monday through Thursday $15 and Fri/Sat/Sun $25.00 per person""

We waited an hour and the bartender still hadn't showed.  We then had to go downstairs to get a drink ( which was a twenty minute wait),
We came back the pool and bartenders showed around 1- for a 9 am opening.  We never had a cocktail waitress ever come by to serve us- even hough they'd known we'd been waiting since 9.  Finally went to the bar to order a drink.  Three  of the drink items on their drink menu they ""didn't have"".

Besides the pool they had some games on the desk area like beer pong, foosball ball and bags which was cool. Seating wise, besides reserving a cabana, it didn't seem like there was a ton of available seating and it was first come first serve. As for music they had a DJ who played the violin which was interesting. She played mainly edm and some 80's rock, fitting for downtown.

For food and drinks the prices were expensive as expected, but not terrible. I ordered the Chips & Guac as an app for $12. The flavor was awesome and it was a decent portion. For a drink I ended up getting the lemon souvenir cup because I thought it was adorable. It was around $45 for the initial cocktail and $20 for refills. They also had bottles available for purchase, around $300 for a bottle of Grey Goose. (Much cheaper than Strip day clubs) They also had complementary citrus water sitting out for grabs and provided a fruit tray along with our cabana. 

Overall I had an enjoyable experience and would come back again.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,3,1,4,ldURwTNyLFtjCxxcsSXZKQ

Servers tell you the price which includes tax and their tip. Although you know about the tax(duh)you don't know about the automatic 21% because you don't get that part of the receipt n of course they didn't tell you.. As you can see this one was crumpled up...n retrieved from the floor.... after I asked for my copy.  But like I said before the food is good yes and my drink was fine.  I just don't like shipp like that.  I'll do a little more ?

Free for hotel guests and locals, so I'm hoping to go back sometime this summer. There are cabanas for rent, but lots of free seating. Regular lounges chairs as well as bigger couches. Not a huge fan of the couches, though. They have really wide bases and short backs, so they're not the most comfortable. There's a bar, too, of course, if you need a cocktail or some snacks.",m3wHMddXjJTJz18x-my-SA,0,0,4,-gBaLCZUQW5DRsNcrVkO7w

The food was excellent, not just the typical pool side options but also some really delicious dishes like the chicken skewers and cole slaw, frozen grapefruit fruit salad and chicken Caesar wrap. The drinks were refreshing and not overpriced. I've read other reviews that service was poor but we didn't have that experience. Everyone we encountered was friendly and although busy, they checked back on us frequently. Wish summer wasn't over!",Jn5ledPkHp5-GP5B-jvytA,0,0,5,nyJFRsaiNva4liGT_Vc6fw
4997545,2016-06-19,0,ZLcTzccbEoNkp5_EGKMUnQ,"We came to the pool at The Grand as the pool at our hotel was under renovations. The pool area is nice, a little tacky with the fake plants, and the deck was very slippery, which makes sense, but the way the pool is designed, where there is a big step up or down to get in and out of the pool, it seems very unsafe for children or patrons with limited mobility. We saw several very large individuals nearly fall trying to get out of the pool. The service at the pool is horrible, as is the food. We couldn't get a waitress to come over so we went to the bar. The bartender was a complete d-bag and didn't acknowledge us for nearly 5 minutes because he was busy chatting up one of the cleaning ladies. The food was not good, over-priced and unappetizing. Particularly bad were the chicken skewers, which were like rubber, but slightly tougher. The citrus is nice to lounge at, as it seems to be uncrowned, but I would not recommend the food.",iZ7NQCM2pQ8KIsQFDMbebg,0,0,2,6DzqaPKA-3s0O4Q8ut6kTg

I was there on a Saturday, and it wasn't packed at all. I feel like it's a secret gem right now. A little nervous that when word does get out, it won't be as fun. There weren't very many chairs for people, and I believe the couches had to be purchased like the cabanas. 

Otherwise, the drinks were cheaper than the strip, and since it's on the rooftop there are no obstructions to our sun for tanning :) Will definitely be back!",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,0,0,5,NLdrrtwC9Iqdhgf4_7pHcw

It wasn't very busy when I want but it was a Monday afternoon. They are open from 9-7 now. The prices are good on food and drinks but if you're not staying at Downtown Grand you have to pay $15 to get in which is a little steep to me. There are great views from up there though, it's nice to be up above everything where you get full sun. Overall it was a really nice experience.",P78ReKnTlf5QmG5TEta5LQ,3,1,4,M9JTGZtSDPB0ymr1myg5Gg
5604178,2016-07-08,2,ZLcTzccbEoNkp5_EGKMUnQ,"This place is an awesome alternative for locals that don't want to fight crowds at GN pool and are looking for a ""free with local ID"" spot. 
 The pool deck is spacious with tons of shaded seating, a big plus over both newly revamped Plaza pool and the GN one. I'm yet to see it crowded. Sure, some seating and cabanas are reserved for a premium, but there's still lots of awesome free seating. 
 I park on the street for $2/hour, walk a few steps and relax in the shade while the kids are playing in the water. They always have pool noodles and beach balls available, too. 
 The view is great, and there's a bar and eatery. Drink prices are pretty consistent with other downtown pools. I usually get a beer and a vodka cran and with tip get out for $17. Every once in a while kids order lunch, they always go for a $10 grilled chicken wrap and it's plenty to feed them both.

Our waitress was great and suggested the Arnold palmer pitcher and we all got plenty to drink out of it for $30 and that's good for prices in vegas poolside.. we also ordered hummus with pita and some flat bread. Both very good.

Nasty drinks
Although upon arrival there were hairs all over the bathroom and the bed sheets had hair on them as well
I called the front desk hoping for some new sheets I was extremely nice and they had someone change our sheets immediately 
Most people would LOSE it over something like that but I was 100% reasonable 
When I ordered room service the people I got connected with were NOT personable at all
The girls at the hotel bars and at the pool bar were all extremely rude and full of themselves 
They acted like Regina George and her clique
We didn't go back to their bars after visiting each once because we felt so picked out and uncomfortable 
And today after checking out I realized I left two pairs of shorts there 
I called and they claimed they didn't have them 
I'm assuming the maid was pissed that I asked for clean sheets and for revenge she threw away my two pairs of shorts
When dealing with this they hung up on my three times and then connected me with the woman who took my food order when I stayed there
Clearly they all are in kuhoots with each other 
I'm not one to complain but they pushed my limits
so I'm not holding back
F this place
Everywhere is noisy too 
I could hear every time someone above or next to us showered or used their toilet
Also the wifi would connect to my phone for half an hour and then it wouldn't work for the rest of the day",L50_D1Y4qPVUK38JNp8ydQ,1,0,1,uy7oQb8FMjE677th4RkcnA

5974959,2017-07-17,0,ZLcTzccbEoNkp5_EGKMUnQ,"I've never been so disrespected at a place in Vegas like I was at the Citrus pool. I booked a cabana and was really happy with it. Our server was great and her service was great, until later on in the day when we were getting ready to leave. Our server left, so another server, Daniela took over. We had spent well over our minimum and when we closed out with our original server, she had told us that if we wanted to open a new tab with our new server, we could. We said it was getting late and we probably wouldn't order anymore and she said okay and told us to enjoy the rest of our day. Our new server Daniela came up to our cabana and said we still had $200 left to spend and that we didn't reach our minimum. This made no sense because we closed out with our original server before. (One  more note is that we were not aware that gratuity was included. We tipped 40% to our server without knowing. Automatic gratuity should always be mentioned but that's not what they do here, so be careful.) She came off extremely rude and made us feel like we didn't spend enough, when we almost tripled our minimum. She asked to take our receipt and make a copy, but it was the only receipt we had, (we weren't give an itemized which says all we had ordered) so my sister and I asked to follow her to where she was taking the receipt. Daniela told us we couldn't go past a certain point, (understood) but we could wait outside while she got a manager and made the copy. The manger came out, who was also very rude and explained that it was a miscommunication with the 2 servers. The manager also wasn't aware that we had closed out and spent over the minimum so she argued with us as well and then explained that she didn't know. It was not our fault the servers and managers did not communicate. The attitude Daniela had was extremely unnecessary and when we proceeded to explain to her manager the attitude Daniela had, Daniela stepped in and said ""I did not have an attitude with you!"" I work in the service industry and I know that you do not talk to guests that way. Not once did we receive an apology from the server or the manager.  I always recommend tourists in Vegas to visit downtown, but this pool will definitely be taken off of my list of suggestions to everyone, including tourists and locals.",qnV7lwDqMYy__wdMTUBpIg,2,0,1,fCU9cm5r_v1zf34sC4dLHQ
