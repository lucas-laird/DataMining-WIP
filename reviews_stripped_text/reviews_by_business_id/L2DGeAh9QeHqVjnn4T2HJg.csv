Whitmore's is to bar-b-que what Lebron is to the inside game.  Speaking of Lebron, this catering franchise which originated in Cleveland, has decided to plant a flavor flag in the heart and soul of the Las Vegas Valley.  That loud knocking sound that you hear are the knees of all the other bar-b-que joints who now have to compete against the real deal.  And just in case you're saying to yourself that ""Cleveland"" and ""authentic bar-b-que"" don't sound compatible in the same sentence, rest assured that Whitmore's got its start in Texas, the Garden of Eden of bar-b-cue.  Now that they've conquered the Midwest they have decided to roll the dice in Nevada.  Theirs (as a budding, yet established business) and yours (as a customer) will definitely be a safe bet.  (O.k., that's the last Vegas pun--I promise).  

 When it comes to bar-b-que there is definitely 'a new sheriff in town'. So let's stop quipping puns and metaphors, and start eating.   The ribs.  Oh my Goodness, the ribs.  (Why else would you even consider going to a bar-b-que establishment if not for the ribs?  It's like going to New York City and not seeing a Broadway show.  I mean, what's the point?)  The succulent, tender texture of Whitmore's ribs will make you reflect on their flavorful goodness long after the last bite.  Theirs is not some course strip of meat with red-colored goo ladled across the top and then over-cooked until it resembles something that you might come across in an archeological dig.

 So, don't try this on the backyard home grill, boys and girls.  Leave it to the seasoned professionals.  Speaking of professionals, did I neglect to mention that the owner, Vance Whitmore, is a graduate of Cordon Bleu culinary school?  And sampling any item on Whitmore's menu will remind you that his toque is well-deserved.

 So you're not a fan of pork ribs?  Not a problem.  Vance and his crew are not one-dimensional chefs.  The chicken is so tender, uniquely flavorful and perfectly seasoned that it will have you exchanging knowing smiles and nods with your tablemates in communal recognition that ""damn, this is good."" 

 The salmon will have you seriously considering a relocation to Alaska during spawning season.  Stay at home and save your money. Whitmore's salmon is likely able to rival anything that you will pull onto the boat in the Bering Straits.  

 Calling Whitmore's macaroni and cheese, baked beans and candied yams 'sides' does a disservice to their individual delectability.  Each could rightfully take their place center stage if you are a conscientious vegetarian.  And don't even get me started on the cobblers (either apple or peach) whose warm, gentle goodness would be the crowning touch to any meal.
  
 In fact, all of Whitmore's offerings are simply delicious and before you finish your meal you will be planning your next appointment with this traditional yet exquisite cuisine.",q1o8RA8n02uSce6zoE-u-w,0,0,5,REoq-60Q_hKud1wCupP1OQ
