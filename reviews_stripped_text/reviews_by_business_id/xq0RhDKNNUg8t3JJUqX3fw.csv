Really......$1 for a spoon full of rice and beans?  It doesn't get any cheaper than rice and beans folks.....

I ask for no tomatoes but only onions.  They don't have that.  Onions and tomatoes come together as Pico de Gallo.  Yea, I'm aware what Pico de Gallo is thanks.  I just wanted Onions and was told they don't have any.  A Mexican Restaurant without onions?

Rude, slow and then they started talking about me in Spanish.  Just because I'm white, blond and blue eyed, doesn't mean I can't speak Spanish.

376857,2015-01-03,2,xq0RhDKNNUg8t3JJUqX3fw,Worst place ever.  First took forever to take my order then once they took my order it disappeared.   I said i want my money back she's too busy trying to find my food.  I said it a second time she says well what did you order? Really and her attitude was the worst.  I get she didn't understand my English but since where in the US please understand your customers are always right.  I will never eat at that place again.  They need to train ppl basic customer service skills.  Nasty attitude to go along with filthy restaurant.   Should have never stopped.,B8Uon5c__Uapkw65dosebw,1,0,1,1MAPJyTCSBeTJcfxPbLUHQ

This is the first Mexican place I've been to where they had a little ""hot sauce"" bar. Sort of like a salad bar for hot sauces, veggies for your tacos, and those awesome jalapenos, onions & carrots.

I had the steak taco, torta, & chimichanga...all top notch delicious! They didn't skip a beat in the way they marinated their meat, the pico de gallo they added and all the extra toppings. 

Plus, they're open 24 hours and have a drive thru. 

Love you Roberto.",W0TobKzkaqtOZpIe0CrENQ,2,1,5,T9ePz7FVR56rMN1jnvWTCQ
2006318,2007-04-05,0,xq0RhDKNNUg8t3JJUqX3fw,"I believe that this is the first location of Roberto's in town, although I may be wrong, but it is one of the first.  The building looks like nothing much from the outside, but it is always packed.  They have a drive-thru, but it can take a very long time to get your order.  They have a good selection and speak a lot of English at this location.  They are very quick in service and have nice specials.  They just don't have a shrimp burrito like some other locations.  They also have one parking spot, in front of the building, since most customers come from the MAX.  Expect to see some military personnel from the AFB and I'm sure there are lots of customers on the weekend from the adjacent swap meet.  I also found it interesting that this location has some arcade games and a jukebox.",bpJLcSlkjCPtsFWwA_QIkQ,0,0,4,HHaxBYU1t_sI7_dWC7R2dA

Worst rebertos ever and not just from this last visit. I've been here more then a few times and every time there's a problem with my order. Workers have the worst attitudes as well. And if you go through the drive through don't expect to get your drink unless you remind them.  
Today I went through the drive through and the order was wrong and no drink, when I told the lady in the drive through she acted so put out that she had to correct it!!

4818522,2013-09-04,4,xq0RhDKNNUg8t3JJUqX3fw,"On the naughty list

I can't really express myself here the full extent. 
What I will tell you is that the tacos are over $2.00 each, they taste better at Pepes Tacos.

The location is horrible there are always people panhandling, or wanting to sell you something while you are trying to eat. 

The staff is really slow, they don't pay attention to orders. I asked for one thing they gave me another. 

They over charged me and didn't give a proper refund. 

Overall the inside looks dirty, just like the one on Easter Ave. 
The owner if Roberto Robledo, who is the owner of the Eastern, Durango, and a few more, So far the only location I can recommend is Warm Springs and Durango.",65qB0ibVi_6mMu87ioZR3w,6,4,2,osq_AJJuEg_t1bRigdj5yQ

You're making money off of me. Wouldn't even let me just buy some chorizo. You make your food as people order. I would understand if it was pre made ..

5918829,2010-10-14,0,xq0RhDKNNUg8t3JJUqX3fw,"As far as an inexpensive but still really excellent burritos is concern, this Roberto's is the best out of the ones (the others are located in the SW) I have actually tried.

Unlike the other locations, the burritos served here comes to you nice and hot. The burritos is packed with the filling you ordered, and not with rice and beans.  The burrito I love ordering here the most is Lengua (tongue), it is simply the best.  I actually went here for lunch and again for dinner after my class in the same day.  And they do serve Shrimp Burrito at this location.

They also have a simple fresh juice bar, where they will squeeze fresh oranges or carrots for your real fruits and vegetable juice.

The decore is not impressive, although a crew was in there tonight to do some remodeling. So next week, when I go back, the interior may look a lot more presentable.  They still have a few arcade games in there, and the jukebox too.  The salsa, cucumber and other garnishes are still available in the self served bar.

The staff here have no problem taking my order in English. The drive through is pretty active, but I didn't see a huge crowd in the store or in line for the drive-thru (could be the late lunch and late dinner times I was there).

Parking is not a hassel here. Location-wise, I would recommend it to any CSN student attending classes or works at the Cheyanne campus and others in the area.  I would not recommend driving to North Las Vegas if you live or work too far away just to eat here.

5 Stars for delicious burritos, good value for the money, and nice hard working staff in the kitchen.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,4,5,6kGLBer1oXmul8EhKnL3CA
