I ordered my ""for here"" cheeseburger and caramel frappe and upon having my order, I sat down to eat and supposedly enjoy my meal at 10:11 pm. All of a sudden, this Lady crew told me to get out while there were people ahead of me chatting,taking there time eating in the table and some people after me being allowed to stay and sit while she was forcing me to get out. I asked her why she single me out and she did not told the people there to get out rudely except me plus, nobody told me while I was taking my order that the store was closing since it was my first time to eat there, and yet they allowed people also who ordered after me to sit in there table without telling them to go.  I hesitate to leave because my order was ""for here"" and the supervisor at that time put my order ""to go"". She thinks I was a bum that she was forcing me out and yet she does not know I just got out of work with crinkled shirt and dirty pants. I was violated and rudely discriminated because of my looks. So, I wrote a note to McDonalds corporate office to train there crew to respect people or any kind of people who can pay and order and not descriminate between those wearing nice clothes who just sit there and chat and was not told to get out  versus those who work, try to enjoy a meal at Mcdonalds and sitdown in there table to eat quietly. 

VERY VERY RUDE NIGHT CREW AND VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!",RkS8cRTOvc-azbPD5fjrsQ,0,1,1,fveCuXuj1uWeVdPKxCx7vg

This midwest Chicago young man was not only personable, helpful, take charge kind of guy he was a delight with helping us on all the new computerized system. My wife and I had our first experience as seniors experiencing the automated system that McDonald's has developed. Boy how lost we would have been without Stevie. We have never had service like the exceptional service Stevie gave us. We love him so much we came and told our daughter who is yelping this for us. Thank God for Stevie and thank God for our daughter who's a yelper!! Go see him he would love to see you and help you with all your needs. Matter of fact ask for him the first thing you'll get his personable smile. Thanks a bunch Stevie. Happy holidays",gPcsovI3nGJY7w3rZ-OOJw,0,0,5,VEJKbjfbx3--8qr-zBWcmA
1987376,2015-04-10,0,jKu_hYzVNQqjRvdvp6mQaQ,This was one of the worst McDonald's experience I've ever had. One night after my friend and I finished shopping we headed here to eat and to wait for her parents to pick us up. One of their employees was rude. She approached is after sometime and told us when we were leaving. We were shocked and responded to her that it's none of her business. How rude of that employee to tell us to leave when we bought our food there. Never going back!,1IAuZhwpbGl8jwN2DTkh-w,0,0,1,D9CPIzX7YivbSgod9ufKkg

The guy who took my order told me it would be 7 minutes, I was fine with waiting. Decided to eat in the restaurant and REALLY wish i had looked first before ordering for here. None of the tables were wiped down nor were the booths. The first booth I sat in smelled like diapers and pee, I had to move. My food finally came out after 13 minutes. The chicken was hot, so I could tell it was fresh but the bbq sauce is so spicy! I don't know if they accidentally gave me the sriracha one but my mouth is burning. I definitely like spicy food but it was hard to enjoy my meal. The fries were slightly stale. Overall, not a pleasant experience. I don't usually expect much from McDonald's but I have definitely has better experiences and eaten at cleaner locations.",FibmeuO6ByCHICMAJoMpEg,1,0,1,GjiEFWWvVcmcTUQddwbz2g

The floor is sticky and the service is slow.  Management really needs to clean this place,9eFi-CKKmdlwpoHVja9Y6g,0,0,1,-HDVGIgukM_sjc23-VxCBA
4014420,2013-05-01,5,jKu_hYzVNQqjRvdvp6mQaQ,"It's 2 for 1 review day!  I can't review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald's that resides inside.  And boy is it some tantalizing stuff.

I try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald's so deserves it.  I hardly frequent a McDonald's at all (although this is my second McDonald's review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one.  No Yelper should go unwarned.  

Of course I came to McDonald's since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap.  Which when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like 'McCrap'.  After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so.  I need to write McDonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately.

My coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE.  I have a hard time resisting free.  I'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!!  Seriously.

It was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy.  I patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald's time.  At least two folks left the line while I was there.  I know it's not McDonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs.  And they were very loud.  This doesn't bother me much.  But...they were also very stinky.  Yes, stinky.  I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess.  To each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN.  If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back?  You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y.  But who am I to judge?  I took a big step back and waited my turn.  Free is the motivation here.  I finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy.  He takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it.""  Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons!  Mind boggling to say the least.  He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up.  $2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.

I wait.  And wait.  #1!  #2!  #3!  #5!  #6!  #7!  #8!  Obviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting.  Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there?  Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla?  Feathering a chicken?  Perhaps ripening a tomato?  I ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, ""We're waiting for your McWrap.""  Of course.

At this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk.  Thankfully I'm only three minutes away.  I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter.  Talk about disappointment!  I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk.  I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame.  Their golden fries.  I bite into one, eh a bit stale.  I bit into another one, eh not enough salt.  I bite into yet another one, eh cold??  I look down, and whaddaya know?  My damn fry is not even barely cooked!  White like Olivia Wilde in the winter.  I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly!  Not golden brown!  Not delicious!  Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp.  Not acceptable!  Please check my pic for proof of this travesty.  McDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy.  NO BUENO.

After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap.  Wow, talk about lightning striking twice.  This thing was lifeless!  After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off.  Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long.  The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either.  After some hesitation, I took a bite.  UGH I say, UGH!  Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today.  All cold and soggy!  And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly!  Instead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce!  And my bacon was missing!  In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO!  It was McCrap through & through.  Totally upset over this one.  I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well.  

McDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty.  I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure.  Knowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap.  CRAP.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,2,1,PxO_JWZmjaEi7JIqy8EY7g
