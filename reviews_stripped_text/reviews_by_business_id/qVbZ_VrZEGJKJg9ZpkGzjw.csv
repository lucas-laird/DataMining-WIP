I went with their corn dog because the root beer house made batter sounded intriguing. The all beef hot dog was so flavorful, the batter was pretty much obsolete. I also wanted to try a burger so i went with a slider. The slider is angus beef, white cheese, carmelized onions, it comes with mayo but i opted out served on a grilled Hawaiian bun was so good. I really wished I wouldve ordered a full sized burger and passed on the corn dog. The fries were crispy and well seasoned.

The food was crazy good, I got the SOOO Cali, loaded with Avocado and their Spicy Basil Aoli (unreal),  and my friends both got burgers, both of which were apparently great. Food took a few minutes, but I realized after the fact it's because they grill and make everything fresh, which I absolutely loved. The service was great, as all the employees were very interactive with the customers.

As far as drinks, the two I were with both had a couple of craft beers (sorry I don't remember the names) and I had their Spicy Mule cocktail. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. In fact I had two lol. It's Vegas right?

I'm in Las Vegas several times a year, and have now found my spot to go to when I want to get away from all the overpriced tourist traps! Thank you Dog Haus!!",aeirERPQyXqAk768kctflA,0,0,5,rtjKFiTc5Q7hYu77N9krhg

Only issue I had was with an employee who, I'm assuming, was on break. This employee was in the seating area and was watching UFC greatest hits on his cellphone. The soda machine was out of ice when I tried to get my drinks. This employee looked up and went back to his phone. I notified the other employees and the friendly girl who took my order quickly went to the back to get more ice. When she asked the other employee for help he rolled his eyes and wasn't much help since he wouldn't put down his phone. If you're gonna be on break, go hang out outside or in the back and not out with the customers where it would be nice to have assistance when needed.

For about three weeks, I watched Dog Haus get comfortable in the plaza where they decided to make their mark and drooled every time. I kept picturing what their food may be like in my head. Finally, yesterday, I decided to feed my inner beast.

Dog Haus is loud and rocking. The stainless steel interior and muted wood wainscoting makes you feel like you're walking into a rough and tumble junk yard. You're waiting for the dogs to come at you and they do, in all the sweetness a King Hawaiian roll can offer you.

Even accommodating the Vegan taste buds, Dog Haus has a relatively wide range of sausages, dogs and burgers for you to try. My German roots couldn't ignore the Pig Lebowski: Polish sausage, coleslaw, BBQ sauce and French fries. You're welcome to make your meal a combo which includes fries or tots and a drink. If you're a conossuier of chili cheeseness, they do have the option of adding those to your spuds. Try The Love Boat! That comes topped with ooey-gooey awesomeness with a mound of their sweet slaw finishing it off. My choice of entree was delicious, magnanimously flavorful with just the right about of spice. It helped that they were playing David Bowie on the radio.

If you're looking for a hangover cure or a cool joint to hang out at, Dog Haus is the place to go. With a little bar tucked away in the corner, you're able to choose from typical drafts to the daily special. Also, if you're a local, mention it to them in conversation and they may surprise you with a 10% discount.",8CRdokGFu_Y6ym5XnaKZVw,1,3,5,cvPcwhkTF34rZGgnB7rJ2A

Happy hour runs from 3-6pm and there's a reverse late night happy hour as well. That means $1.25 sliders, fries, and tots plus $2 off beers on tap. Decent variety of beers on tap but nothing out of the ordinary. Still, with sliders this tasty, you'll find something cold to wash them down. The burger patties are juicy and well seasoned and work so well with the sweet Hawaiian rolls they're served in. So addictive that you can go though a whole lot of them in no time!

1438113,2016-08-24,2,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"Stopped by here for a quick lunch while in the area today. Heard about this place opening a few months ago and wanted to try it but it was always out of the way. 

I have no previous experience with similar places besides buldolgi's which has been in town for years. 

I realized this location took over the old Johnny Rocket's spot which used to be here when i used to attend UNLV. 

Walking into the establishment, immediately to the right has a small bar with a few things on tap. Lots of bar stool tables on the side. 

This restaurant opens Haus Dogs (special all beef skinless dogs), Haus Sausages (hand crafted sausages), Haus Burgers (proprietary grind of chuck and brisket), sides, sliders, and desserts. Vegetarian styles available upon request. 

I had decided to try something ""standard"" (is that the right word) and went for the Das Brat. Dat Brat contains a bratwurst topped with sauerkraut, caramelized onions, and whole grain mustard aioli, all in a hawaiian dinner bread ""bun"". By the design of the hawaiian breads, the only thing i found cooking myself at home was they were amazing as slider buns. When split in half for anything else, they easily fall apart. And this was no exception. Dinner breads arent big to begin with. A bratwust is probably 2/3's its size. Topped with sauerkraut and onions, its almost impossible to eat this cleanly. Even before my first bite, the bread split off and left with with a ""whole"" dinner bread section with some saurkraut. That itself tasted amazing tho xD but who doesnt like hawaiian bread with anything. The sausage itself had a pretty good chewing texture with its casing. Flavor-wise, i wish it was a little more flavorful. For the price, and something so simple, i feel like i was overpaying for what i got. 

Maybe the other stuff they have offers more but nothing really stood out to me prior to ordering. Maybe i just dont know sausages... if u know what i mean hahaha",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,3,1eghKhKYvbdG2Oy9ZYTMug

I asked to chase my Free Bird turkey sausage with the unique Hawaii-born coconut porter.

Denied.

How about the cider?

Rejected!  ""oh, I'm so sorry. Would you like to try..."" I notice not two, but FOUR beverages on tap are tapped out. Similar to the boozie overpriced and small shake had last time, disappointing. Water will have to do.

That sad exchange aside, the Polish kielbasa I had on my first visit was stellar. Real crunch to the outside, authentic seasoning on the inside, all lovingly held by an open Hawaiian bread which is grilled to perfection, bringing out the soft yet flavorful texture and taste of the oft-neglected bun.

And this time? My turkey 'dog was also aces---simple in execution, but the avocado and other fixings made it a filling spot. One burger slider to top it off, also a fine choice. 

Dog Haus is, for the most part, priced fair. I love the display case so you can see the fresh fixings you are ordering. The bar-like scene is bright yet somehow hotdog-rustic at the same time.

I order the Scott Bailoi, which was described as grilled onions, cheese, garlic ailoi and bacon crumbles. I also opted for the cheesy tots. 

They gave me a number on a stick to place on my table so I went to wash up, grab a drink and check some emails. After cleaning up my inbox I looked up wondering when they were going to bring the food out and noticed a lonely tray of food sitting up on the counter.

Whatever, let's give it a try.. very small dog wraped in a huge bun with a ton of cheese, oily diced onions, hard bacon crumbles and mayonaise. 

This spot would be the bomb if I was in college and drunk. SADLY, I am neither. I am a middle aged, blue collar guy looking for a quick lunch at a good value. (Hot dog, right??)

$12.00 bucks for a poor hot dog, pre-frozen tots with cheese sauce poured over them and drink is not my idea of a reasonable lunch which is why I can only assume they were dead slow at 12:30 on Wednesday.

It is a better deal to pick from one of the options the already created, making your own dog will most likely cost way more since each topping costs anywhere from .70-1.50$.

SOOO CALI: The spicy basil aioli is amazing, but the avocado and crispy onions give it great texture too! A fun explosion of fresh flavors. 
RESERVOIR DOG: a kicked-up take on your usual chili dog, with slaw and mustard, was my guy's favorite. Heads up, the chili is spicier than expected!
SCOTT BAIOLI: I got this for the garlic aioli and caramelized onions but was underwhelmed. Sauce didn't have much flavor, felt like the choice of cheese didn't really fit the other flavors. 
THE COWBOY: bacon, white American cheese, onions, and bbq sauce somehow didn't come together for the wild ride I'd anticipated. 
SIDES/SHAKES: Vanilla shake was super-thick, I hear the salted caramel version is even better. Tots and fries are crispy and salted, add cheese sauce if you're not concerned about a coronary.

They use Hawaiian sweet rolls instead of hot dog buns and I guess they're going for the sweet and savory but I really think the Hawaiian buns takes away the goodness of the sausage itself and the rest of the toppings. My boyfriend ordered the downtown dog which is a bacon wrapped dog, and he said it was nothing special and also didn't like the overpowering of the Hawaiian roll. The chili cheese tots are yummy though. The tots are nicely fried and crispy and golden brown. The chili is good too.

2318520,2016-12-01,0,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"This place took over the space where Johnny rockets was. There is another hot dog place across the street but this one was finished being built first. I didn't actually make it to this one until after going to the other across the street first, though. I feel they are going to start a cross street rivalry like many single stop shops do on the east coast which, ironically, both of these places originate from...the east coast. (I stand corrected. The owner was cool enough to point out that DogHaus is NOT from the east coast....so, it's more like a east/west rivalry, lol)

Ok, so onto the review. I rolled up late and by myself. After midnight and after a long night out. Cool atmosphere, low lights and funky music on. Good seating area. Reminds me of east coast seating with long raised slim style table like a bar with stools positioned adequately spaced apart. Televisions on each row of seats.

Now the food and service...service was nice. The girl was friendly, knowledgeable and smiling. It's always kind of hard going into a new place where they have numerous unique creations because I always want to read all of the ingredients to see which one sounds the most tantalizing but I feel like a dweeb sitting there reading every single one. So, to keep the excitement moving, I usually just ask which is the most popular. The girl pointed out a few. I think this is the best way. If the best is good enough, I'll come back and have a little better idea of what to order and how to order while having more confidence from feeling like a dweeb. 

Now, this place has more options of dogs or sausages and kielbasa, etc. ( fun names btw ). I got the Pig Lebowski. The sausage was great. Perfectly cooked with just enough snap from the casing from well made charcuterie. Good flavor. The toppings were tasty but actually kind of took away from the sausage, in my opinion. Was piled on a little too much. It has Cole slaw, fries and pickles with a dark sweet sauce. These are all good but being a premium sausage, I was almost tempted to wipe off the toppings and eat the sausage plain. Like I said, the sausage was great which almost made the toppings seem unnecessary. And it was a lot to eat. With the combo of drink and choice of fries and tater tots, one dog was plenty to fill me.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,0,1,4,0svpUjpnc2M7wR622EwBPg

Food is freshly prepared, tasty and always filling.  I love that they use those yummy little King's Hawaiian sweet buns to house the dogs.

They offer multiple hot dogs and sausages that you can sub in to any of the menu offerings :)

What we got:

- Chili dog- sub REAL cheddar cheese for that nasty artificial nacho cheese (LOL yuck), fresh onions and ""Haus"" chili.  SO YUM.  All-beef hot-dog is a must get and is super yummy.
- Root-beer battered corn dog- I was not able to taste the root beer, but this corn dog was pretty tasty!!
- Fries- have been hit or miss the times that we have been here.  It has been good/okay about 50% of the time.  You won't miss them if you don't get them.

First off, the dogs themselves are great. Cooked to perfection with the right amount of snap and spiced just right. 

Oh the use of grilled Hawaiian rolls is fantastic. Not sure the rolls are actually King's Hawaiian rolls, (hope they are). They're reminiscent of the type of bread used in lobster roll. Good and different choice. 

First time here, we ran through the following:

Cowboy dog-grilled bun, dog with American cheese, BBQ sauce and crispy onions. Sweet and sticky. A little too sweet for me. Would have preferred a tangier sauce.  Crispy onions are a nice topper. 

Little leaguer-good 'ol chili dog with cheese and onions. Solid. This will be put in the rotation. 

Turkey dog-my kids ate the whole thing so I give it a third party thumbs up. 

Fires and onion rings-cooked correctly. Nice normal fries. The rings were bite through. Which means the onion didn't pull out of the batter on that first bite. 

Chocolate shakes-very good. Not overly sweet. Solid. 

Ambience-clean, nice, industrial, cool and hip. Good friendly service.

2906895,2018-01-14,0,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"As far as Hot Dogs go... This is the best in Las Vegas, IMO.  What makes it, (as you've read from other reviewers), is the King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls that they use. It compliments the wide array of dog items in their menu, splendidly!  I especially like that the dogs are hormone and anti-biotic free.

I came here with my 12 year old, and he too was impressed. Though it was a little too much food for him, (which is fine since we saved it for later), cause I kinda went crazy for the two of us on the ordering. We had an order of the chili cheese tots, my son had a chili dog, (not on the menu but they were accommodating to make it for us), the Sooo Cali, and a small cheese burger. All were amazing and cooked perfectly.
The service and time between ordering and receiving were great, as well!  

Now, keep in mind that the portions are pretty generous and this is not for anyone who is dieting or on a Keto or paleo diet, (though you can just order a sausage or  a dog with no bun). But should you have a cheat day and don't know where to go, come here. It will be worth the extra work afterwards to put your body in that ketogenic state after consuming this goodness...

 I do plan on coming back and trying other dogs and maybe just a brat just by itself with mustard...! Either way, I recommend this place and hope that you have an awesome eating experience, as we did!",Qa67LO6dGw1mKTy7R3YgwQ,0,0,4,X5iVP9bXBWxL7XtnSOZCSw

Since I don't love American cheese but do love onions, I asked for crispy onions instead, made it a combo and, even though I showed up famished, I still had leftover fries.

 My dining companion went with the old town dog, a favorite of hers that comes wrapped in bacon with jalapeños, cojita, aioli, and caramelized onions, and cheesy fries. Haven't tried the old town but it sounds right up my alley. The cheese on the cheesy fries are more like a queso dip style cheese.

I've been here twice now and both times oddly happened after a visiting the Double Down Saloon, I guess Assjuice makes you hungry? If that drink reference goes over your head, you should probably leave the burbs more often. 

The Dog Haus, a Cali based restaurant with a laid back feel and professionally built hot dogs. On my first visit I went with the Downtown Dog stacked with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, pickled peppers, mayo, mustard and ketchup. Flavor bombasaurus! So good, so messy and so satisfying, you will be full after eating this dog. 

The second go around was a total sausage fest, The Pig Lebowski was calling my name and so were the extra carbs that accompanied it. A Polish kielbasa with coleslaw, bbq sauce and topped with french fries! The crunchy coleslaw mixed with spicy BBQ was so good and the kielbasa has perfect snap when I chomped into it. 

What makes this place so amazing is the use of Hawaiian Sweet Rolls as the buns instead of the traditional roll or pretzel roll. The bread is super soft molds to the dog instead of falling apart and creating a mess. The dog may take a little longer than normal, but everything is made fresh to order and come out piping hot, it's worth the wait.

3141578,2018-01-02,4,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"Dog Haus has been bookmarked on my Yelp for who knows how long. I was on a recent stay-cation with some friends that came into town to celebrate the New Year and we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino which just happens to be right across the street. I personally am not really a fan of much of the food options that the Hard Rock has to offer so my friends and I ventured out while staying there and I saw the sign for Dog Haus and just had to stop by to finally see what the hype was about.

When we arrived it was on a Friday night so I was expecting there to be a bit of a wait which it was but nothing too major. After previewing the menu prior to arriving I was already sold on the ""Old Town"" haus dog which consisted of  smoked bacon wrapped dog, caramelized onions, chipotle aioli, pickled jalapeños, cotija cheese and a side of chili cheese fries. After I ordered they gave me a number to bring with me back to the table. 

Cool thing about this place is they have a bar you can utilize while you wait! They offer both dine in and take out orders so having a drink in the meantime always is a good idea! I noticed while I was waiting the sign that advertised a happy hour which is another plus! Mon-Fri 3PM-6PM...""Late Night"" 10PM-4AM and ""Sunday Funday"" 11AM-4AM. I'll have to be back to see how they are during one of those time frames. 

My overall thought of the haus dog was that it was okay. I think that the concept that they have here with serving the hotdogs on Hawaiian bread rolls is different and can set them apart from any other hot dog place but I just didn't get that WOW omg factor from it. I know they offer like an upgrade or something you can do so maybe next time i will do that to get the taste out of the basic category. Same thing with the chili fries they were just meh for $5.99. I think I might just have to try a different type of haus dog or even one of the haus sausages or even one of the burgers.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,8,4,3,m6NT3wYjt4YOYt3F_M6sjA

I had the polish sausage, but they had many options of hot dogs, hamburgers, and sausages, and even a vegetarian option if that's your fancy.  The venue is nice for an after work outing as they have 3-6pm HH and a bunch of tvs and draft list of about 8 - pretty small total but it looked mostly local so I can get behind that.  The bun was the best part of my meal. My sausage came with added onions, peppers, jalapenos, and greens.  I thought the sides were just eh and didn't add much flavor.  In hindsight maybe I should have ordered one of their named plates rather than build your own to experience the sides in a better fashion.  Still, I enjoyed my meal and was full for the same price as any other fast casual lunch in town.  Took about 20 minutes from order to mouth and friendly staff all around.

I have mentioned Dog Haus to my Vegas friends and family and no one has heard of the place - yet. The Vegas location is fairly new, so I'm sure the word will spread quickly.

Dog Haus creates some of the best Bratwursts i have had the pleasure of putting in my face. You can order off the menu or create your own so the possibilities are nearly endless.

I had my usual - ""Another Night in Bangkok"" with the Nurenberg brat instead of the spicy brat. It comes with Thai peanut sauce, a refreshing slaw and crushed peanuts all served up on a toasted Hawaiian sweet bread bun. AMAZING! I washed it all down with lemonade.

I've been to a Dog Haus location about eight times (including the LA location) and I have not even tried their hamburgers yet. The reason is that their bratwurst are the best I've ever eaten.

I hope the Las Vegas Dog Haus becomes as big a hit as it is in LA. Pretty sure it will.",kF04-wLUI1egaAtOnrYkCg,0,0,5,8xPygnJGkp6wsdvd6cWfGg
3520276,2016-06-23,54,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"This is a place my hubby had bookmarked. I honestly didn't expect to like it here as much because I don't usually like hot dogs and burgers, but I ended up pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my experience and it was a worthy of being bookmarked to check out. One thing they do here is serve the dogs and burgers on King's Hawaiian Rolls, so I was interested to see how that would turn out since I love making sandwiches on King's Hawaiian breads and rolls at home. The hot dogs are 100% all-beef skinless, burgers 100% natural Black Angus beef burgers and the sausages are handcrafted. On the menu you will find signature options or you can create your own with several options for toppings. Upon walking in we were given menus to look over and the girl who helped us answered any questions we had. The employees were courteous and knowledgeable of the menu which was nice since I was new to it. You can eat inside, outside or place your order to-go. 

The Fonz ($7.99) - Spicy Italian sausage, pastrami and melted mozzarella served on 3 split King's Hawaiian Rolls. This one is tasty. Great flavors and I'd definitely order it again. Hubby really liked it as well and even thought about going back to order another one. 

Sliders ($2.49 each) - With the sliders it's not just burgers. You can choose from a mini burger, mini hot dog or mini corndog. I chose the burger that was made with angus beef, caramelized onions, white American cheese,mayo and served in a one King's Hawaiian Roll. I hardly ever eat burgers and wished I had ordered a more of these delicious gems! Since they are mostly a 2-biter slider, I'd recommend coming during Happy Hour when they are half off. 

Chili Cheese Fries ($5.99) - These fries were smothered in house-made cheese sauce, shredded cheese, chili and green onions. The fries I had were lightly crispy and hot however they didn't ""wow"" me. The cheese sauce really had a strong flavor that I personally didn't like at all and found it overpowered the taste of the chili. The chili had no beans and was thick with good flavor. Next time I'll ask for them to substitute the cheese sauce with shredded cheese.

Onion Rings ($3.99) - The rings are beer-battered and I liked them a lot. I prefer battered rings over the panko, breadcrumbs, etc. types and they did them just right here. Freshly made, tasty, crispy and something I'd more than likely choose as a side over the fries in the future. Don't forget to ask for some buttermilk ranch to dip or choose from one of their Haus Sauces for an extra $0.79 cents each. 

They have regular shakes for $4.99 and they also have ""spiked"" shakes for $8.99 and soft serve ice cream. There is a bar inside and I recommend checking what the current HH specials are if you are coming down to drink and eat so you can save on both during that designated time.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,72,68,4,sGlBQsPY2s6Sn17wMRf8Fw

Nice and friendly cashier and staff, atmosphere fits the name and food fare, but quality and price don't provide this place justice. I ordered the Scott baioli, a build your own dog with ketchup n tomatoes, a hangover burger and extra crispy fries...all for $25+
The fries were ok, nothing special. The Scott baioli was too much of something that was off putting..I ended up scraping all the extra condiments out and just eating the dog with the bread by itself. The hangover had chili, not bad, but didn't really need it..they use Hawaiian rolls for everything, dog buns, burger buns, etc. I like Hawaiian rolls, but it doesn't always fit with everything...this is one of those cases.
If you must try this place, just go with a build your own..it's $2 cheaper. Get the tots over the fries..no need to mess with the burgers. Probably can venture into sausages though.

Which is interesting because every part of the ordering process is fast food. You walk up to the counter order your meal they ask you for here or to go and they give you a number. They do bring you your food or call out for to go orders. Also like fast food you go to a soda machine. Everything is served in disposable paper products on an aluminum tray. 

The decor is industrial. All the seating is bolted to the ground. Stools and benches are your seating options. Nothing with you sit back and relax in. The counter people were nice.

 I spent $13 on a combo. I ordered the little leaguer with cheese fries and a soda. The beef hot dog was greasy I should have requested turkey dog. The chili was bland and you really couldn't fast the difference in a regular bun vs kings Hawaiian rolls. The cheese fries were good I'd get them again.

Starving, I pulled the burger apart and tried to just eat the meat, tasteless bland ground beef. I hate to be so harsh, I work near there and was hoping that I found my new spot. Only saving grace were the French fries but even those were just saturated with grease. So all in all I payed 13$ for a soda.

The guy taking our order was super nice as was all the staff we interacted with. My boyfriend ordered the Little Leaguer and I ordered the build your own veggie dog. I asked if it was vegan but there was uncertainty among the staff. I also ordered it in a lettuce wrap (gluten free). We both ordered the full meal with tator tots and a fountain soda.

My order came out wrong, it was the Sooo Veggie dog and not the build your own. I ate it anyway; they seemed to have new staff training so there was a lot of confusion. I thought it was good. The veggie dog itself is a good meat substitute if you like that kind of thing. If I were to come back again, I would definitely try the Veggie Smoked Apple sausage as that looks really good. My boyfriend said he liked his meal but has had better at other places. The shining star for him was the bun. Tator tots were yummy to both of us.

4108274,2016-08-04,7,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"Aside from a certain local business with a Korean-inspired name and a Strip location of a famous colorful LA institution, I wouldn't say that I have much experience with gourmet hot dogs. After tonight's visit, I'm starting to feel that I've been missing out.

Dog Haus is another sausage slinger imported from LA, one of at least 3 that come to mind. Had I not known about them before one of their LA locations was recently highlighted on a Travel Channel show, I would have probably gone anyway eventually. I can be a bit of a sucker for those places shown on TV though, and I ended up going sooner than I'd thought.

This Vegas outpost is in a certain very crowded Harmon/Swenson/Paradise-bordered plaza near the Strip, and I was fortunate not to go at anywhere near a peak hour. After carefully perusing the menu with my friend, we agreed to share some food so that we could enjoy a slightly more comprehensive introduction.

Old Town Dog ($6.99, same as their other ""Haus Dogs""): everything packed a big flavor punch here. The sweet Hawaiian rolls (three of which are pulled from a package and split down the middle) and the plump bacon-wrapped dog might've been enough alone, but the sweet and soft caramelized onions, the spicy pickled jalapeños, the chipotle aioli, and the cotija cheese made it a party. It feels like a fairly ""safe"" flavor profile but isn't boring in the slightest, and I'd definitely recommend it.

Another Night In Bangkok ($7.99, same as their other ""Haus Sausages""): also comes on Hawaiian rolls, but features a spiced Thai currywurst instead of a beef dog. I expected it to be spicier based on the concept and how they sold it on the TV show, but it was pleasantly mild. The peanut sauce sold me enough on the Thai concept, and the crunchy flavorful slaw really sealed the deal. I think it had less dimensions of flavor, but it lingered on the taste buds longer.

Fries ($2.99 a la carte, $3.49 with a combo): I was expecting them to be fluffier, but at least these thick-cut potato pieces had a crunch. There's a bit of an odd flavor from the oil, but the right amount of ketchup completely masks it and complements the fries overall. I no longer felt displeased to have to chew on the fries for one or two extra bites because the delay allows the combination of starch and vinegary sweetness to marry perfectly. Not a necessary side, but a very desirable one unless, heavens forbid, a ketchup shortage suddenly strikes.

Dog Haus seems to have found a winning tube meat formula with delicious ingredients through and through, and I'd be very happy to go back sooner rather than later as long as I don't run into parking issues in that jam-packed plaza. It's definitely the first hot dog restaurant on my local list for now.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,10,4,nQS-MsgXD8BfOK0TqjFu_A

Lastly was a mini burger on that same Hawaiian roll with a mini burger cooked to perfection with grilled onions and cheese !! This hands down was my favorite , I would definitively go back just for that alone !! I also enjoyed the cheesy tots , golden brown tots with that luscious cheese sauce on top , I would recommend though , if you go with the tots get them crisp if you add any toppings cuz they do have a tendency to fall apart when adding sauce or chili. from what I can tell their beer choices do change , but I had a pear cider which was great and an 805 lager , both were a great accompaniment to a stellar meal !",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,0,0,5,khUodYFnaJBUGm3f8NojCA

I like the parking lot here as it is big. Our cashier was very nice. As we were deciding, we noticed the variety of hot dogs, sausage and veggie options in the case in front of us. Very nice. We decided on The Cowboy for me, as I love BBQ sauce, and the Old Town Dog for my husband with its jalapenos. We also got a side of tater tots.

I like that they have napkins at the table, so they are within reach and you use only what you need. They offer ranch and bbq sauce if you ask. 

Everyone here was really friendly, and really seemed to enjoy their jobs. Once we got our food, they looked wonderful. The buns consist of 3 Hawaiian rolls together, but cut in half.

I ordered a Downtown Dog with Chili as my side.  You can tell immediately the dog itself is premium.  Juicy, flavorful, smoky grilled flavor.  Taste was great.

We were both very pleased especially since it was delivered. I ordered a build your own dog with several toppings and sauces and my husband ordered the Babcock dog plus the love boat fries. I was super impressed that by the time the dogs got to us they were not at all soggy or soaked. The slaw was still crunchy and the fries were still crispy. We also received the food in under the time expected which was nice. The only thing that bummed me out was that I had asked for sauce on the side and didn't receive it but even then it wasn't a big deal.

But that's ok.

Parking: We found parking right when we entered the plaza. There's plenty of other businesses in the same plaza; however the parking seems plentiful. Not sure how it is during peak hours.

Service: 5/5, greeted us with a smile as we walked in & as we walked out. They give you a number after you order & serve you whenever it's ready. Also was given recommendations on the menu! 

First impression: Clean & spacious. Plenty of tables for everyone. Extensive menu, allows for tons of substitutes if you're that person lol. 

Food: Ordered the old town dog ($6.99), upgraded to a spicy Italian sausage ($0.99), and made it a combo with fries instead of tater tots ($3.49)... Which totaled out to about $12. 

The old town dog consisted a smoked bacon wrapped dog, pickled jalapeños (which is what had me sold), chipotle aioli, caramelized onions, and cotija cheese. They overload that thing with allllll the condiments. Too many onions IMO. But the fact that I got a spicy Italian sausage instead of a hot dog, made it 10x better than it would've been. I'm a spicy kind of gal.

And did I mention they use Hawaiian bread as a hot dog bun??? RIP. 

Overall, 5 stars for the experience. But I feel like major crap right now because I never really eat hot dogs/sausages. Go ahead, make all the jokes you want!!!!!!!!!!!",FOy0Qrkw54VKDEWIw7T-jw,2,1,5,Ybaxis22841MCsLEEP_E-w

It is counter service with a couple of tables out front in case you have your puppy with you like I did.

My friend on the other hand tried the Ringer burger - smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, onion rings, and bbq sauce. I took a bite of her burger and it was good but I still preferred my hot dog more.

It seemed to be a great turnout with a consistent line of approximately 20-30 people the whole time I was there. For a first day, everything was so smooth and we had a wonderful experience. The cashiers were proficient, we received our food quickly considering how busy they were, and someone checked in with us multiple times.

King's Hawaiian Rolls! Everything is on grilled King's Hawaiian Rolls! Dogs and sausages get three in a row and burgers get a square of four rolls. Who doesn't love these rolls?! It's brilliant!

Haus Dogs are made with special all-beef skinless dogs. There are veggie dogs available upon request. $6.99/each.

Sooo Cali: Wild arugula, avocado, tomato, crispy onions, and spicy basil aïoli. The hot dog itself is delicious; great flavor and bite. The toppings worked well together and I loved the little kick of spice from the aïoli.

Old Town Dog: Smoked bacon-wrapped dog, caramelized onions, roasted jalapeño, chipotle aïoli, and cotija. This was the most flavorful and tasty dog/sausage of the bunch. However, it was rather spicy! I would need to go light on the jalapeño and/or aïoli.

Haus Sausages are made with hand-crafted sausages. Veggie Italian Sausage and Veggie Smoked Apple Sausage available upon request. $7.99/each.

The Hot Chick: Chicken fontina sausage (chicken, fontina, basil, arugula, and red chiles; smoked), avocado, tomato, crispy onion, Sriracha, and ranch. The sausage is delicious and everything, of course, was delicious. I could've done without the Sriracha though.

The Fonz: Spicy Italian sausage (pork, basil, fennel, and chiles), pastrami, and melted mozzarella. Really great Italian sausage and again, delicious combination.

Fries ($2.99): Their fries are the skin-on handcut type and decent.

Tater Tots ($2.99): Same ol' tots we all know and love. 

This is a neat spot with delicious gourmet dogs and sausages at decent prices. I'm definitely heading back since there are so many other signature dogs and sausages I want to try, including their adorable slider dogs!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,13,12,4,wjDLhfVf4jHAlo32h0ohpA

Between the three of we shared some tater tots and french fries, oh and not to mention instead of standard buns they use those delicious sweet hawaiian rolls.

""I'm hungry"" someone proclaims.

""Yeah me too.  Tacos or hot dogs""  says another.

""M E A T in a T U B E!""  announces Midwest poker bud.

""Oh brother.  Dog Haus it is"".  And that's all she wrote.

Small but rapidly expanding chain serving loaded dogs and flavorful sausages.  This isn't Biker Jim's.  No need to worry about alligator or rattlers in your sausage.  Just flavorful beef, chicken, and pork.  Good dogs and sausages with no claims of heritage pork, hormone free, antibiotic free, all natural, etc.

Choose a dog or sausage from the display case or one of the premade menu items and you're good to go.  Sub any dog or sausage ($1 extra) in any premade sandwich.  All sandwiches are made on grilled Hawaiian sweet bread rolls (three rolls for a sausage).  The sweetness makes the proteins sing.

Toppings make the dogs.  Leading the list is ""Another Night in Bangkok"".  Take the spicy Thai currywurst with its porky goodness and warming curry heat and top it with a creamy satay sauce, crushed peanuts and a pile of slaw.  Flavor town.  A close second, the ""Old Town Dog""  Smoked bacon around a dog topped with caramelized onions, jalapeños, cheese and topped with a spicy chipotle aioli.  Salty, zesty, and satisfying at 2am.

Great chili cheese tater tots as a side.  So unhealthy but oh so good.

The only major misstep, the root beer batter corn dogs.  Soft with a strange, off putting burnt sugar bitterness.

Speedy no frills service.  Beer a plus.  HH, M-F 3pm-6pm and reverse HH, everyday 1am - 4am with two for one beer and wine.  Open late (4am).

The fonz was good, but I personally wouldn't get it again. It was on the salty side. Italian spicy sausage with pastrami and mozzarella. (7.99)

However, this place must use the money made from its 1 time customers to buy their reviews.

We tried the chili dog, regular hot dog, burger sliders, corn dog, fries and onion rings.  All of it was subpar.  Tasteless for the most part.  However if your lips are chapped, they will thank you, because the amount of grease that was in everything not only left my lips plenty moisturized but made me fee like I needed to apologize to my heart and arteries for the next month.

My personal favorite hotdog to order is the Sooo Cali it's made with wild arugula, crispy onions, spicy basil aioli, avocado, and tomato absolutely delicious. I also would recommend you try the corn dog which is like the high end corn dog at Disneyland in Anaheim with the thick corn bread covering and well done, not the sad soggy limp corn dog they sell throughout the rest of the park, I think Disney sells both just to confuse people. Anyway back to Dog Haus they also have Hamburgers, Milkshakes, Chocolate Chip Cookies and  Coctails for those of you that want to add a little something to your Dog Haus experience.
A huge bonus is that they are open until 4:00AM here in Las Vegas  they are literally right across the street from the Hard Rock hotel casino on Paradise Rd.
Personally I think they should get really creative and add a few more hotdogs to the menu to really set it off I guess we'll have to wait and see. Anyway get in there try them out",tUJJr2fvXDLbo34i3UGAvg,0,0,5,u9nA5Pelqf0GZU3wEPaEHQ

1st off it is in a really great strip mall with lots of things around..I have probably driven past this mall 100 times and never realized anything in it. They had GREAT music playing as we walked in and very friendly staff..plus plus! Great start! We then grabbed a menu and sat down. Great names for each menu item.  I am boring so I got the all beef hot dog with cheese sauce and mustard and the cheese fries!! The dogs are served on Hawaiian bread rolls...amazing idea. The dog was cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce...mmmm mmmm good. Perfect ratio of cheese to dog and mustard. 
The man must have been in the mood for chili since all 3 items he ordered were covered with it. He had chili cheese tots...the chili idol dog and the reservoir hog which was a Polish sausage with chili, slaw and mustard. He was not sure how he would feel about slaw and chili together...welll.....it was down in the belly in about 5 mins...I'd say he enjoyed it!
Chili is hard...it's either really good, ok or terrible. Luckily for him it was really good!!! I kept sneaking bites of his tots!

I called the store, and the cashier admitted to forgetting the other part of the order.  When speaking to the manager, Elizabeth Hernandez, the first thing she said was, ""You forget your order?""

5838039,2016-05-31,4,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"While continuing the subject of memorable hot dogs and assorted related American picnic fare, I just savored two great varieties at Dog Haus quite a bit closer to home.  Henry Winkler, The Fonz of ""Happy Days"" fame, should be proud of ""The Fonz,"" a nice combination of spicy Italian sausage and high-quality pastrami modulated by smooth melted Mozzarella Cheese all embedded within the confines of a large and noticeably sweet grilled King's Hawaiian Roll.  The sausage contained just the right amount of spice, and the pastrami was much more meaty than fat, and not dry like some that engender a gag reflex.  This beast on a roll was accompanied by great golden Cheese Tots which had been removed from the fryer at just the right moment and then smothered in a very tasty mild Cheese Sauce.

After a suitable respite to absorb the first round of eating, a Build Your Own Dog was next on tap for me.  After giving some thought to the matter of what among myriad available elements I would like in my dog, I settled upon free add-ons of yellow mustard, onions, tomatoes, dill pickles, and two premium ingredients requiring an extra charge: Haus Chili and sauerkraut.  When I first bit into the hefty skinless all-beef wiener, I was surprised how moist and tasty it was.  The remaining bitten top even glistened with juices as I gazed down on it before moving in for the next bite.  And, I was quite pleased that partial slices of fresh tomatoes were included instead of small bits of tomato; the white sauerkraut was first rate; and the brown chili was very nice, with a silky texture and just enough heat to make it a desirable dish in its own right without overpowering the rather complex edible construction.  

Not being a purist in matters of adding ketchup to a hot dog except in the case of a classic Chicago Dog, because I generally like the taste of tomato ketchup along with yellow mustard on hot dogs and hamburgers, after one bite I opted to pour a thin trail of this red condiment along the length of my dog from the self-serve stand across the room.  After this, for me personally, enhanced by fine skin-on fries also dressed lightly in ketchup, my dog, which was encased in another grilled King's Hawaiian Roll, became near perfection on a metal tray.  Meanwhile Diane consumed her root beer-battered Corn Dog--which was bigger than most--and happily finished off the remainder of my Cheese Tots. 

Service was friendly and efficient, although someone else's order was mistakenly brought to us first; loud piped in heavy metal music was a nice change of pace from Sirius's The Blend's offerings on my car's satellite radio; and wooden bench seats were comfortable enough that I was not distracted by the hard, ungiving surface.  The food had my full attention, and there was no scrimping on providing generous portions of high-quality ingredients in inventive combinations here.

I will be back soon to try a burger, which I was told by a member of the wait staff can be made medium rare to order; and to enjoy some Haus Chili on its own!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,5,5,fYpbPi3cGgy98C-qrDJouA

5902832,2017-10-29,2,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"Any place that offers a veggie dog that doesn't taste like mostly water is most definitely on my radar. And while it's pretty pricey, it's a price I'm willing to pay. 

Sooo Veggie is their signature veggie dog option, and while you can substitute it in any other menu item, you should definitely give it a try. Similar to their Sooo Cali but replaced with a flavorful, sweet, smoky apple veggie sausage, it's topped with deliciously crispy shoestring onions with arugula, avocado, and tomato for freshness. It's also topped with a basil aioli that lends an herby component with a liiil' kick. It's bomb.com, and to make it better, they stuff it in a sweet, buttery Hawaiian roll. 

I would definitely stick to their hot dog in a bun options. Their hot dogs on a stick are okay, but I don't think they're much better than the ones served up at a mall fast food chain. 

As for their sides, they are massive. And while they're by no means the star of the show, they play a decent support role to round out the meal. One hot dog and one side to share is the perfect portion to leave me feeling satisfied and then some.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,3,4,fdvHv3r93u9sby7WAPT8-Q

I was surprised that they have a pretty big menu considering it's a hot dog place. They have burgers, fries, and desserts too. The atmosphere is really cool, (definitely better than the Johnny Rockets that was there before). They have alcohol and happy hour with beer and food on the menu. They're open late. And in central Vegas. 

I got the slider dog and corn dog and some fries. Then slider dog had cheese and bacon (YUM). The chocolate shake was also to die for (drizzled with chocolate sauce). They have very friendly service and greet you upon entry and acknowledge you when you're leaving. I'm definitely going to come back to try the rest of their menu. It's worth coming to, trust me!

Oh, and FREE wifi!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,5,2,4,Fu_c6_JiOc9nuQ-_ia-OVg
5919357,2016-04-18,1,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"I had some preconceived notions walking in. This isn't the first place to make fancy hotdogs and it won't be the last. I picked the Sooo Cali because it sounded good to me, not too heavy. (Note, this is far from diet food and if you are on a diet don't even walk in the door.) I would have ordered a combo with a shake but their machine was down and decided on a New Belgium Citradelic instead with a side of tots to share w a friend. 

The dog was a little awkward to pick up because Dog Haus doesn't use hotdog buns which over the years have been conditioned to fit hotdogs perfectly, they use three unseparated King's Hawaiian Rolls which have been toasted on the grill with a little butter. This bun base perches the dog a little high and then you have the array of toppings sitting on top of the dog. In this case we had wild arugula, tomato, crispy onions, spicy basil aioli, and avocado. The mix of flavors and textures is worth the mess you are about to create and lean forward to not drop any escaping crispy onions from hitting your pants.  The tots were good, despite the light color they were freshly fried nice and crisp. You can find plenty of napkins on the tables. 

This isn't an every week kind of place but definitely great enough to make me want to try a sausage or burger next time. Hopefully their ice cream machine will be working for a dark chocolate shake.",LubOvS08WwKTWugQ2V9_1Q,1,1,4,O8SHvQ9aBoch67HtQMVY1Q

5922279,2016-06-05,6,qVbZ_VrZEGJKJg9ZpkGzjw,"So I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life and not going to Dog Haus while I was a UNLV student and mere minutes away everyday certainly counts as one of them. I ended up at Dog Haus because one of my mates from London had a bit too much to drink the night before and wanted ""some dirty delicious American food"" this turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. Since it was first time we decided to order a few things and share. We got the little leaguer, hangover burger and the reservoir hog with regular and chili cheese tots. First off, they use quality bacon which is a must with me and their party is definitely fresh ANd well matched. I also am a giant fan of Hawaiian rolls and their sweetness totally pairs well with the savoriness of the meats and chilies. 
I like their combinations of meats and veggies and stuff and that most of their sausages are wrapped in bacon because you can never have too much bacon. 
They also serve alcohol and they had several delicious looking beers on tap but I wasn't able to park take. Neither was I able to put their margaritas to the test. I love that they advertise having alcohol instead of basically keeping it hidden like another restaurant *cough*Chipotle*cough*  hot dogs and margaritas and GOOD BACON= 5 stars from me anyday",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,5,3,5,U-rok4mnE0ExsDkoR9bHpA
