152762,2012-04-03,1,_KCvY2g9mMgcBSrVjCS0FA,"this shop is 100% fantastic!!! 

my friend and i made the trip out from the strip after she raved about the fresh turkey sub she'd had with her husband a year ago. besides some really roundabout directions, the trip was definitely worth the short drive out from the main strip! 
reasons to make your way out to this shop:
-the turkey is roasted fresh every day and melts in your mouth!
-during the time we were there, people from NY, Philly, California, and Texas came by, put the philly sandwich to the test, AND loved it!
-Ruth is one of the sweetest people i met and makes you feel like you're family!

218217,2011-11-18,1,_KCvY2g9mMgcBSrVjCS0FA,"I purchased a $10+tax Italian sub here on Tuesday.  Nice lady and I'd had a very good Philly CS a few weeks ago from here. I took it home and it smelled a little off to me (I suspected one of the meats was not fresh--it happens with deli meats). I ate 1/4 sandwich and fed the rest to my dog.  Later that evening I got a stomach ache followed by diahrea the next day.  I decided $10 was too much to let go for a sandwich that I felt made me ill.  Took back the other half today and was going to ask for a replacement Philly.  The manager got indignant and basically started giving me hell about the sandwich smelling fine.  She offered $5 refund while chewing on me the whole time.  My parting words were ""What happened to the customer being right.""  I'm 61 and don't really look like anyone who would try and get over on anybody.  The Subs at Mama D's down the street and Cuglino's near UNLV were great and only $6! BTW the manager asked me why I didn't call them.  Didn't even know their name until I returned the sandwich.  My first review of anything in Vegas--sorry Hougan's.

I recently had two sandwiches delivered, told the person on the phone exactly what we wanted on each sandwich, yet they came with an added oil & vinegar on one, and cole slaw on the other. They looked like they would have been great sandwiches, but when I'm paying $10+ for a sandwich, I want my correct order. The menu does not say anything about adding oil & vinegar, and my husband specially did not ask for cole slaw. With Jimmy John's just opening up in the area with sandwiches at half the price, not charging delivery & no minimum order, Hougan's definitely needs to step its game up!

I just happened by this place because i was getting my tire fixed. Walked in and saw that they had a HUGE menu of different hot and cold sub sandwiches. I decided on the Hot Turkey sub, which is what I usually ordered from Capriottis. This sub was waaaaaay better. The stuffing was delish, gravy was tasty, and tons of turkey. I even asked for extra stuffing and she didn't charge me. 
The lady at the counter is very sweet and friendly. She also had her mom working there who was also nice. I found out at a latter date that the mom passed away. :(
I have tried a couple of different sandwiches and I always get a great tasting sandwich. They also have a punch card for frequent buyers. which is great and sometimes they have specials like a free drink with a foot long.

The bread is just right and the meat has a decent flavor. Though, I must say that the standard Philly is not as good as when you get it with hot peppers and pepperjack cheese. That just makes the flavors explode and gives you just the right amount of spiciness. In fact, that really is the only way to go here. And it has just the right amount of greasiness. It's a great sandwich.

The downsides are that they don't have Whiz as a cheese option and they don't really offer any sides (i.e. fries), though they do have a decent selection of chips.

The sign outside the building says they are known for cheesesteaks. When I got inside, I browsed the menu. They have a good combination of hot and cold subs. I asked the nice little old lady what she suggested, and by now surprise she recommended the cheesesteak. It set me back $8.78 for a small sandwich. 

The sandwich - I have been to Philly. While I did not go to Pat's or Geno's, I have had a genuine down home Philly steak sandwich equipped with the Wiz. This one was not quite there. In a game of baseball, it would make it to second base and strike out on the way to third base. It was just okay. The bread was somewhat fresh. Maybe baked a day or two prior. The meat was sliced deli-style, which I am not a fan of.

I have heard about it and read some reviews, but since I live in East Vegas, I didn't really want to drive so far across the valley for a cheesesteak. That being said, I have to say:

-The service is great!  The woman and little girl running the place were super friendly!
-My friend said she recognizes him and knows what he wants, all the time. That's how you run a business!
-The double meat philly was a hot mess, and in a good way, freakin huge and oozing with molten cheese and TONS of steak, onions and mushrooms! And only TEN dollars for a DOUBLE meat 9' incher.
-She made a mistake with my friends cheesesteak, as he is allergic to mushrooms, and she accidentally put them on. She was extremely apologetic, and made another one immediately!
-She gave him a 10 dollar gift card with his new sub. Now that's how you treat your customers!
-The other subs looked incredible, like a turkey/gravy/stuffing grinder, a massive reuben sub sandwich, and a Philly chicken parm steak sub.
-I want to go there at least one more time before I move back to Florida in June because, even though I'm not a huge cheesesteak fan, I want to try the other sandwiches they offer, and they were absolutely great to us as customers.

So Yelpers, I recommend giving Hougans a shot.  It's nothing fancy, but I don't go to sub shops for the ambiance, I go for the sandos! Youse unduhstand me? LOL

Walking in, I notice how much character is packed into the small store.  The motif is NASCAR but also has the traditional old-school soda shop feel.  There are tons of young and old pictures of Hougan's fans proudly displayed on the left wall.

I order a Philly cheesesteak for me and a Slick Track for the fiance.  Unfortunately, the Slick Track is not listed on their online menu so I'll explain so it to you so you can get instantly hungry.  It is freshly roasted/carved turkey (she roasts bird(s) EVERYDAY), homemade stuffing, homemade gravy, and cranberry on a fresh sub roll.  It's similar to a Bobby from Capriotti's but, hot and soooooooooooo much better, says the fiance.  The cheesesteak was pretty good itself with good flavor but could've used a touch more steak.

Both sandwiches were made to order, so calling ahead of time is recommended if you are in a crunch.  9"" smalls are $7.50 and 12"" larges are $9.50 and are worth it.

They do have a small dining area available, but we opted to take our sandwiches to go since we live right around the corner. I was really craving a roast beef cold sub(Mmmmmm, I love those!), but they were out. That sucks! How do you run out of Roast Beef?? You're a sub shop! Okay, no biggie. I than opted for the roasted turkey sub while my friend grabbed the hot pastrami. We each ordered the ""regular"" size and for just the two subs with tax it came to a little north of 17 bucks. A little on the pricey side considering that was with no drinks or chips.

But if its a great sub, I'm willing to pay for it! Problem is, it just wasn't that great. The roasted turkey was okay. I got a few bites of the pastrami too and it was quite underwhelming. Almost kind of reminded me of Capriotti's a bit, as they were heavy on the sauce (she did warn us they were gonna be sloppy! lol) 

The service was very friendly and efficient, so certainly no complaints as far as that goes.

For all the glowing reviews on here, we were just a bit underwhelmed. It wasn't horrible, but honestly I can't see myself coming back here.

UPDATE: How odd. About 10 minutes after posting this review I received a hateful message (directly replying to this review) from a Ms G  (account created Sept. 2013...of course) telling me to grow up and ""quit acting like a baby"". Hmmm? Who might be motivated to respond so irrationally to my review?? Perhaps the owner? I would hope not. Seems a bit hypocritical for some one who took the time to create that account and send the mail to tell anyone to ""quit acting like a baby"".

Whenever I see it I cannot fight the urge to do my own xxxx vs. Philly taste test.  Hougan's is one of these places.  They have a sign that sits on Silverado Ranch that begs you to walk in and give their steaks the old college try. After fighting the urge for a month, I finally caved in last night. 

First, let me tell you about the food.  I ordered the Pizza Steak (steak, provolone, pizza sauce) with onions, peppers and mushrooms.  The first step to a great Philly cheese steak is the bread.  A Philly steak will give your wrist a nice dousing of wiz but the bread will always hold firm no matter what toppings you decide to pack into it.  This was not the case with Hougan's.  Immediately upon the unwrapping of the sammy I could see that the bottom of it was soaked almost to the point of turning it into to mush.  This was def from the pizza sauce and might be limited to this particular sammy.  Eventually towards the end of each half everything fell out of the bread due to the bottom deteriorating into mush.  Luckily, I was eating at home so I had access to a roll of paper towels allowing me to pick up the slop and eat it like the savage I am.  The second step to a good Philly steak is the meat.  I believe they use a thin sliced rib eye in your typical Philly steak.  Hougan's meat looked like a couple notches above steak-ums and on its own it tasted pretty bland.  Lastly, the make-or-break moment for a good Philly steak, is that first taste of the cheese.  Mmmmmm cheese.  The cheese didn't stand out as sharp provolone that punches you in the face like it does in Philly but it was plentiful and melted well.  The other toppings were all up to par and I rather enjoyed the pizza sauce.  That sauce could probably pass for a pizza sauce in Philly.  All this being said I HOUSED the sammy and still enjoyed it despite its flaws.

Secondly, let's talk service and decor.  Hougan's has a big menu on the wall with all of their offerings and you have to love places like this where they also have pictures of the menu items posted on the counter.  Sure, I might be the only weirdo who enjoys average printouts of random sammy's but so be it.  The rest of the inside is filled with pictures of patrons and NASCAR memorabilia.  Nothing too exciting or frightening in here, it looks like your average East Coast sub shop.  The woman who took my order was extremely sweet and very good at explaining every item on the menu (she makes the meatballs herself, the turkey is fresh sliced etc.) and she even threw in a free soda because it was my first time there.  Score.

Overall, Hougan's was just OK for me.  The sammy was good but it fell well below the authentic Philly steak standards.  The service was lovely and Hougan's will def get another visit this week to see if it deserves another star on the board.",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,2,0,3,gntSac92Ho1JkAve03s88Q

Not only are the sandwiches better, the service is awesome.  My husband and I took my two sisters and nephew there the other day.  They too were die-hard Capriotti fans, until January 29, 2010!  We watched as the sandwich artist (because that's what she is!) whipped up five superb sandwiches and still managed to carry on a conversation with us!

And the sandwiches...OMJesus!  Get the Burnout which is a great pastrami sandwich with yellow mustard(you can get brown mustard if you like it's my fave), coleslaw and pickles.  Sooo goood and flavorful!  Another favorite is Thanksgiving All Year Long!  Much like the Bobby at Capriotti's but with FLAVOR!  You can imagine that this IS what Thanksgiving leftovers at the owners home would taste like!   The philly is yummy and juicy.  The meatball sub chock full of homemade meatballs and sauce!

Then we ordered and once our food was ready she came around with to go bags and told us they were closing. (I'm like why didn't you tell us that while we were ordering.)

I ordered a Regular Sized (9"") Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Provolone & Peppers.

The woman working there was very nice and friendly.  The other customers in the joint appeared to be regulars because she knew them by name and already knew what a few of them wanted......very impressive.  You don't find service like that too often in Vegas.

My sandwich was very fresh & hot and looked awesome.  However, in the taste department it fell flat for me.  I thought the Beef was a little bland.....it didn't have that distinctive taste that I expect from a Steak Sandwich.  I also thought it could have used more Cheese as I could barely taste the Provolone.  The Peppers were good.....although, I didn't know you had the option to order Sweet or Hot Peppers until I overheard other people asking for them.....wish I would have known, I would have ordered Hot......to be fair, it's printed on the menu on the wall.....but I overlooked it as I was trying to read everything and figure out what to order before someone else came in and cut in front of me.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and even though the Steak Sandwich didn't do it for me, I will give this place another try the next time I'm in the area so I can try the Pastrami & Swiss Burger and their Italian Sandwich.  Until then, it gets 3 Stars in my book.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,12,10,3,7behyhLHCrE7jeNFPjLGxg

3943301,2009-09-18,0,_KCvY2g9mMgcBSrVjCS0FA,"Since moving to Vegas about a year a half ago I have always been a huge fan of Capriotti's. Enjoying their subs 2 or 3 times a month. When I was forced to try this new sub shop, I was not a happy camper. But when you are waiting for a car repair and are starving... your choices are limited.
Lucky for us! This time our choices were limited to Hougans. We decided to get the same exact thing we always get at the competitor so we could truly decide which was better. Philly cheese steak (with hot and sweet peppers) and the Thanksgiving type sandwich. 
The two women who ran the shop were so friendly and so nice! They made everything fresh for us right there, and threw in an extra bag of chips free (just cause!). 
Now lets get down to the nitty gritty. The philly was excellent, hot, and spicy. Really spicy. Like next time we will probably get the hot peppers on the side spicy. The bread was great and the sandwich all around was pretty delicious. Altho, I think I would prefer Capriotti's on this one. The Thanksgiving sandwich (which is what I call it, but the true name escapes me) had huge piles of hot moist turkey. This is where they have Capriotti's beat! More turkey then you could ever imagine! We had them put the gravy on the side, as we were in for the long haul and didn't want it to get soggy. We dipped the sandwich as we went and good lord was it fantastic! 
In the end, I would say the score is tied, 1-1. and until I decide to start eating different sandwiches, the two sub shops remain tied for first place. For those of you who live in the area of Hougan's, for sure a place you want to add to your ""how bout we go here for lunch"" list!",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,3,1,5,YrOc7ovWrazKJy8pXHtVdQ

These lady's roast their own turkey's every night and slice their own meats. The Pastrami was super meaty, lean, and perfectly seasoned. My husbands cheese steak was just perfect, thin soft onions, peppers, and lean beef with a soft roll...oh and very generous portions made him very happy =)  The Pastrami & Cheese Steak were so good that we had to get two Turkey Sandwich's to put in the cooler for the drive home to California and after a long 7.5 hours in bumper to bumper traffic, they were so delicious that we were ALMOST glad we got stuck in traffic...ok not really, but they were great!
The really fantastic part was that the lady's heard that we were going to put them in our cooler for a long drive and they wrapped each half of our sandwich's seperately and put them in a ziploc bag without us even asking!

They have a bright store with a great atmosphere, friendly staff (the store is family owned by a mother and daughter team), a kids menu and many choices for sandwiches, salads, and burgers. 

The quality of the food is excellent, and the price is right, with everything on the menu under $10 (with the exception of platters of subs) it's very easy to feed multiple people without breaking your pocketbook.

I would give a 4 or even 5 star rating if it were not for the bread and several more things that really turn me off. There are a ton of handwritten signs on every available surface inside this establishment and pictures of people who have filled up their meal stamp cards (which as you could imagine is a LOT of people and a LOT of picture frames). The actual official menu on the back wall has marker on it where they've crossed out prices and items and written in new ones. I did not see any fountain machine or any options for fountain drinks, just a fridge with drinks in it. 
I know what it means to be shallow and judge a book by its cover rather than its content but in this case I have to judge the overall experience. While the service was good and the food was great, the cluttered. sloppy, interior and the lack of fountain drinks just beats me out. I didn't see the napkins anywhere either?? I can't see myself returning to this place unless I have an absolutely incredible craving for philly cheese steak again and then in that case I wouldn't stay.
