69938,2014-07-04,2,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"My husband and I have been wanting to try Farmer Boys for a while now. It was well worth the wait, we both had The Farmer Burger® (Double Cheeseburger with Avocado/Bacon & all their normal toppings). FYI...all the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion and 1000 dressing. The patty is not greasy at all, which is always a huge plus.

I like their combo options too, instead of fries, you can have zucchini sticks (which are huge and amazingly tasty!) or onion rings and a few other choices. The shakes are sooooooo good! We tried the Reese's shake and it tastes just like an old fashion milk shake, thick and creamy.

In all, the food is really good and the overall experience was nice as well. The food was fresh, which made it taste even better! We will be going back for sure.",_NjmJcj2B9DX8hybhaAxGw,3,2,5,hQ0N0s7ezVaVhWxvSFjyXg

161536,2011-10-10,1,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"The interior of this restaurant screams 'country kitchen', the décor is complete with awful ceiling fans, floral patterns on awful fabrics, wooden trellises, fake plants, and milk jugs. It felt like someone threw up every awful bit of Homegoods into this place. And to make matters worse, I think every child and adult eating here was at least 30-40 pounds heavier than what they should be. I don't think I've ever gotten the feeling that I actually stepped down a social class walking into a burger joint, even at McDonald's, but this place somehow did it for me. It's like the Wal-Mart of burger joints. So all that being said, if you're looking for a classy joint, read no further. And screw you if you think I'm judgmental.

This is a fast food burger joint, but to make it feel a bit more 'fancy' like some other places, once you place your order you are given a number to take to your table. Only such classy places as Carl's Jr do things like that. The burger took about 5-7 minutes to arrive at my table which isn't bad, and supposedly because each one is cooked to order.

There are many menu options including a Farmer's Burger, which comes with bacon, avocado, thousand island and various toppings, but at 1196 calories I decided to pass on that and go with the Farmer's Classic Double. This burger consists of two 1/8lb patties, American cheese, thousand island, and your standard lettuce, tomato, two dill pickle slices and onions. Everything there is pretty much standard including the plain bun, but the onions were thinly sliced, almost shoestring, doused with thousand island and were a nice touch. I typically don't like too much onion on my burger as it can take away from other flavors, but these were pretty good.

The patties were actually decent, for fast food I would feel safe eating them on their own similar to an In-N-Out patty, unlike one from McDonald's or some other places. Not sure if it was real, but it had a really good char flavor to it, dare I say better than Burger King's, and eerily reminiscent to Harvey's which I miss dearly from my childhood. There was even some pink in the middle of my thin patties, I'm not sure if that was intentional or not because you will never find anything like that in similar fast food places, but I'm brave so I ate it without a worry. Not sure if my stomach ache 30 minutes later was because of this or just the meal in general.

The fries were nothing great, thicker than most typical fast food choices, but not any better. Your standard frozen stadium fries more or less. I still somehow found myself eating almost all of them, and there were a good amount to go with my burger.

And now for what is usually the determining factor for whether I give a place an ok score or not: the value. My entire meal of a double burger, fries and a drink only cost $5.39, which is cheaper than my coveted In-N-Out double double meal, although not quite as good. Still, considering the poor atmosphere and mediocre fries, this is actually a good deal. You can definitely do much worse for a fast food burger and easily pay a lot more. Hell, this is a bargain compared to that overrated crap you get at Five Guys. Granted it is fast food and should almost not even be considered on this blog, but I walked away far happier than anticipated so I won't complain. So if you're looking for something quick, cheap and decent, then by all means don't be afraid to eat at Farm Boys burger alongside some mullet-sporting white trash diners.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,4,lW97IEf_OAmdcu30tuBlFw
173464,2015-04-24,0,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"I have not eaten here before today. My coworkers eat here a lot for lunch. Today I decided to see what the hype is about.

I thought this was an actual restaurant!!  It's not. It's a fast food joint, drive thru & outdoor umbrella seating. 

Arriving just before noon on a weekday, I walked into a packed dining room. How thrilled I was to arrive when I did. Within minutes of entering & paying for my order the line was out the door. Literally!

The first thing I noticed about the order counter is the clutter & the menu is extensive & busy. I had a difficult time finding JUST a bacon cheeseburger & fortunate for me the cashier knew the menu without looking. I still don't know the name of the combo I ordered, but for $9.82 I ended up with a bacon cheeseburger, 1/2 fries & 2 onion rings, & a drink. (If you're a Coke person - they serve Pepsi, Lipton raspberry tea, Dr Pepper & ice tea.). I took my number & sat, waiting for my lunch to be brought out. 

Overall, I was impressed with the freshness of the ingredients. Not just with my meal, but with the LARGE salads being brought out. I wasn't impressed with the ""plating"" (on a sheet of wax type paper & round tray), taste, and more importantly, price. 

Yes, I enjoyed my meal. My burger was hot, properly cooked. Loaded with more white onions than I prefer & 2 strips of bacon. The fries were fine, not too salty, not to large, no too thick. The onion rings were large (both in size & thickness), lightly battered, but bland. The flavor came from the sweet yellow onion itself. I've had better burgers at  Carl's Jr.  

Because it was full the tables weren't properly minded. Cleared? Yes. Wiped down? No. 

For $9.82 I expected a better burger then what I could get at Carls or make at home. Will I return? Probably. The salads I saw looked really good & loaded with chicken breast. I'm pretty sure I saw fish & chips on the menu. They also serve brekkie. 

Tip #1: mind your parking. I made the mistake of parking next to the drive thru entrance and was blocked by cars waiting in the parking aisle to enter the drive thru.  People are rude, selfish & more concerned about themselves than the fact they were intentionally keeping me & others from leaving. 

Tip #2: order your meal for take away. They give it to you in a sturdy container with a bag. Makes bringing leftovers home quick & easy. Most importantly...if you order salad, would you rather eat it off wax paper or from a bowl?  They come with dressing on them...if you order it as take away you can shake your salad & disburse the dressing evenly.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,1,3,CqLLUCYb7Vv3i2e2Itp-bQ

Unlike the birth of my children this stop happened by total accident! I wanted a great burger and didn't want to make the drive to California to eat at my favorite IN-N-OUT joint (because for some reason the ones there taste astronomically different from the ones here in Vegas?) So I decided to try this spot for the first time after hearing such great reviews about it on my Facebook. The decor is, well... Farmer-ish? Hence the name, I guess? I do have to point out that I was surprised at the menu and how extensive it is. They have everything from burgers and fries to soups in a bread bowl! However, take note that the day you decide to add on a few pounds by eating at this restaurant; the fried zucchini is a MUST HAVE! They are not only delicious and served with 2 sides of ranch,but they are HUGE!!! I mean almost 6 inches! ( you can't go wrong with 6 inches :)... of zucchini, I mean.) The burgers, which are grilled perfectly, also have add-ons like bacon,avocado,mushrooms and jalapenos, to say the least. But that truly was a $6 burger! Fries are ""OK"". From what I read they seem to have pretty fresh produce that is used within days of being picked since they are based out of California. Also, they use 100% real ground beef. No fillers, no hormones. All in all this is a pretty good burger joint and when I'm in the mood for a 6 inch zucchini and a great burger , I won't mind breaking my bank again for this place since it was $22 just for two burger combos.

They didn't ask for it.  #3 - I ordered a combo and was asked if I want zucchini or onion rings, even though the menu says choice of any 2...  zucchini, rings, fries.  Because of the way they asked, I figured they meant in addition to fries...  I knew I shoulda asked to make sure...  Because on the rare occasion I hit a burger joint, I want fries.  NOT 4 pieces of GIANT zucchini...  it's way too much zucchini.  So I'm not even going to eat it all.  #4 - The burger is super flat.  This meal would've been over $10 without a coupon.  Yikes!

Rather than rant about a horrific episode that occurred last night at a neighborhood casino buffet (which I may still need to alert everyone about after I collect my thoughts) I would like to take this opportunity to spotlight the restaurant that is Farmer Boys.  
Being a fast food connoisseur, Farmer Boys is somewhat of a hybrid restaurant.  You place your order at a counter (or via drive thru) yet you are served the food and you even get real utensils!  Again, being a picky eater I cannot comment on their fried zucchini, bowls of chili or fresh salad wrap however there burgers have always been approved by my taste buds and the onion rings are delish.  Also, fear not breakfast lovers you no longer have to go to Sonic or JITB to satisfy your craving to chow down on some breakfast munchies for lunch or dinner... this joint is rocking the sausage and bacon all day!  May I suggest their scrumptiously delicious breakfast burrito that comes with your choice of premium meat!  
Please come out and give Farmer Boys a try.  Word to the wise it is a bit pricier than your average burger spot however, they do you have coupons in circulation and have daily specials that will save you $2-4 dollars!  Here is a link for current promotions: http://farmerboys-lasvegas.com/page.cfm?p=1coupons.cfm&CFID=16420536&CFTOKEN=56d06f707cf49ae1-E91EF539-5056-A32D-AD51D5B5B8B2C05E&jsessionid=84306dffd483b5cf4881533115744734372d

Went through the drive thru around 7:15pm it wasn't busy at all. Ordered a Cobb salad and I wanted the soup bowl which they still didn't have, which I remember around this time last year they did! So I ordered a pastrami sandwich instead. I pull up to the window and pay, the employee said it would be just a few minutes. A little time goes by, then I see the guy with my order. Puts it in the bag and sets it near the drive thru window then walks off to the front cashier to take orders of people who walked in. Why didn't he hand it to me the moment he put it all in the bag? I was watched everything, like did he forget I was in the drive thru? But hey thanks for letting my sandwich sit there to get cold. Finally some other lady employee who returned from her smoke break 5 min ago had to hand me my order after it had been sitting there close to my 10 min. Its ridiculous to see what work ethic is these days and how quick people lose track of what they are doing even when it's not busy at all!! I won't ever return to this location again!!

My avocado bacon burger was delicious. I'm really picky about my burgers (they're my favorite food, but they're horribly unhealthy, so I only eat them occasionally. Nothing is worse than a crappy burger), which is why I don't usually order them unless I'm at a restaurant that specializes in them. This was awesome.

They have fried zucchini, and you can tell they do seem to be fresh large pieces of real zucchini, but half the time they are hard as a rock - way undercooked, and even if cooked correctly the breading is tasteless and really not good.  Onion rings probably have the same batter - fresh maybe, but not great.  Every time I have ordered a hamburger in the drive thru, it is at best lukewarm when I eat it...even if I eat it immediately in the car!  Never hot. Probably due to the long wait at the drive thru - I can picture my burger sitting there, getting colder and colder as I wait...Maybe inside is better - might try it sometime.
One great thing is they serve breakfast all day, although it isn't as good as a real restaurant breakfast, it's not that bad.

-The rewards club is pretty great. For every dollar you spend, you get points and when you get 60 points you get $5 off. They also send random perks like free sides, or a few bucks off an entree. 
-They give you a free entree for your birthday. 
-They have delicious ranch that they give to you at no charge. 
-They have daily specials that include entree, a side and a drink for $8.99. I usually get a daily special, and if I use My $5 off, I get a full meal for around $5. - - - - The bbq chicken ranch wrap is amaze balls.
-The sides are massive and you can choose deep fried zucchini, onion rings, or fries.

The only negative is the drive thru is very busy and super slow. It can take up to 20 minutes to get food, which is almost half of my lunch.

My boyfriend went inside and within 3-5 minutes they gave us another batch of fries. I tried one and they felt really hot, so that was enough for me, we were all hungry and wanted to hurry home.

I was in line and was waiting patiently to take my turn in line. Some young kid cuts to the front of the line with his buddy and the cashier sees him and says nothing just welcomes him to the counter and takes his order like nothing happened. Another girl decides to jump on the register by the door ans screams out next ...i look to see if the guy in front of me is going to go and she yells out looking at me ..come on who's next lets go. I walk up and ask her for a hamburger meal with avocado and a chocolate shake. She says do you want fries with that.... i say ..yes i just told you i wanted the meal. She replies with you obviously need to speak up because i didn't hear you....she then is banging away on her register to show me she is irritated with me then snaps at me and says what size shake do you want....i tell her small and she makes me repeat it again.  She tells me the total and snatches the 20.00 out of my hand and gives me back the change. I ask for a receipt and she rolls her eyes at me and bangs away again on the register hands me receipt and turns her back on me walks to the back counter and turns and looks at me while she is talking to someone else to let me know shes discussing me.

Got in the drive-thru line about 1:20pm with 4-5 cars ahead of me.  10 minute wait which was at least 5 minutes too long but things happen.

Finally drive away with $8.00(!) hamburgers to eat in the car and we have to deal with ketchup packets.  No ketchup or mustard on the hamburgers and no mention of this by anyone.

So the worst part - cold hamburgers.  And I don't mean a little cold.  They must've been made at or prior to when I ordered them before the 10 minute wait.  One of those deals where the burger was sitting next to the lettuce so long that it wilted.

Not so impressed with the flavor.  The buns were spongy and the meat had a sooty flavor like they were cooked over a grease flame.  They probably would have been better hot.

Maybe I just I had high hopes because I heard good things about this place.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because the ingredients seemed fresh - at least at one time.",NUtVG7jNPLJR2cxMXMH2-A,0,0,2,fYAZjQsLx20rSVo0-f2dEg

Anyway the food. I had a bacon cheese burger. My boyfriend got the barn burner (I think) and we both were able to compare it to Burger King. I love BK, but the fact that you can compare the two should say enough. I honestly didn't like it at all. It was really dry, the patties are so thin. I'd prefer one thick one.

Farmer Boys serve breakfast plates, salads, sandwiches, wraps, and I guess what they're known for....burgers.

Be sure to check-in so you can redeem and use their check in offer for a cheeseburger combo at $5.49. If you don't...it would be like $7-8. Hey..doesn't hurt to save a few bucks right?

Personally, I thought these are one of the best burgers I've tasted in awhile. To sum it up, it's like a gourmet burger but in a fast food joint? If that makes sense....
My burger tasted fresh and whatever sauce/flavoring they had made  this burger stand out. (Writing this review now makes me want to go to Farmer Boys lol and this rarely happens to me when I write my reviews.)

Came here on a quick lunch break with a co-worker after he had seen it on his way to work. Upon parking, knew the place was going to be packed from just amount of cars in the parking lot surrounding it. 

Be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes for your food (we only had a 30 min lunch break) , 5 of that waiting in line, and another 10-15 waiting for your food. Did not expect this many people to be swamping the place at 1230. Our entire visit was about 40 minutes after everything was said and done.

I snagged a table as soon as we walked in (which is a great idea) while my coworker ordered. 

 The menu I could see from the table had so many tasty, delicious options, and I can understand why it's a popular breakfast and lunch spot. I don't believe they are open for dinner I think I read somewhere. 

I ordered the Avocado, mushroom 1/4 lb. Burger and it was totally worth the wait! The meat was juicy, the avocado & vegetables fresh, the mushroom was delicious and the fries were a nice skinny, long cut which made the crunchy start to finish. Th bun was a very good non-standard bun that didn't taste like a generic bun. Washed it all down with a pop and I was good to go.

3024291,2010-12-01,1,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"My buddies back in California have been telling me for sometime about this joint called Farmer Boys.  They keep saying how great it is and as a fast food connoisseur, it was definitely on my list the next time I made it back there.  Well much like finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans, I was driving down Decatur in part of town I rarely roll to and lo and behold, there was a Farmer Boys staring me in the face.  Waiting was no longer needed.....it was go time!

The place was epically busy during lunch, which is a good sign.  I ordered the Farmer Burger which is a half pound burger with cheese, bacon and avocado (got to go with the namesake) and made it a combo.  I duly paid up and when the transaction was complete I asked for my cup for a soda, the gentleman taking the order was like ""Oh you wanted a combo, I didnt ring it up as such.""  I said no problemo, I'll pay the difference, but he was insistent that it was his fault and that he'd take care of it.  I felt bad and wanted to pay but he wouldn't let me so I put what it would cost me into the tip jar.  I thought that was a nice, albeit really unnecessary, customer service gesture.  Not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.

As for the food, the burger was outstanding.  One of the better fast food burgers I have ever had.  The bacon was crisp, the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.  I struggled to finish the whole thing, which is a rare occurrence.  The fries were good but relatively unspectacular.  I wish the fries were top notch because I would not hesitate to give Farmer Boys a 5 star ranking in that case.  Although, there is hope.  The menu is extensive and I have barely scratched the surface with this matinee performance.  When I make my return, there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakfast menu which is served all day (awesome!) and intriguing salad and wrap options too.  So basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening salvo, while further visits will reveal the true nature of this place. 

Prices were decent, especially considering the quality of the ingredients.  Service was friendly and the dining atmosphere was kitschy, rustic, farmy fun.  I also respect that they rock the drive-thru as well so if that REO Speedwagon song I'm rocking too is just to good to turn off, I can keep the party going without missing a beat.  Now if I can only figure out more reasons to go to this stretch of Decatur.....",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,3,1,4,a_E9H-UQ6PfYMAZiYjowTg
3037238,2010-12-05,2,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"Any place that can serve a good breakfast all day gets my good vote. So excited to go here for dinner after my brunch fail this morning. I already decided before I walked in that I was going to get eggs anything! Except I walked in and saw posters for all their soups. With it being could ouside this changed my mind. I ended up getting their chili which the casher told me was made in house and pretty popular there. I can see why. Pretty yummy. (i just have to remember next time to go easy on the cheese topping.) My mom had some heartattack on a plate. (so you know it was good!) hashbrowns, topped with country gravy, layered with scrambled eggs, and topped off with pieces of chicken tenders. are you craving it yet for breakfast tomorrow? you should be! I had a bite of my boyfriends bacon cheeseburger and that was even good. We shared chili cheese fries (like my bowl of chili wasn't enough right??) and I didn't think they were going to be such a large order! We ended up taking so much home for leftovers of everything. For 4 people to eat dinner it only came to 25 dollars. My dads credit card isn't complaining.

3044381,2014-06-26,1,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"I've been wanting to eat here, as I had heard good things about it. As luck would have it, I was driving by this location as I was driving between work locations, it was a creative route, but it worked.

I looked over the menu and decided on a cheeseburger, makes it easy to rate against other places. I had the Big Cheese combo. It was a cheeseburger, side and drink at $8.31 with tax.

The place is like Carl's Jr in that you order at the counter, they give you a number for the table and they bring your food when it's ready. That's the only thing that reminds me of Carl's Jr here.

The burger was good, it is a 1/4 pound patty, the patty is thinner and larger diameter than most 1/4 pound burgers. The shape of the patty seemed to have helped, it had retained a bit of juiciness after cooking, and the thinness had kept it from being tough. (With thicker burgers, in order to get the middle well done, the outsides are over done, so I kind of like the thinner burgers) The burger came with onion, lettuce, tomato, thousand island dressing.

For the side you get the choice of fries, onion rings or zucchini sticks. I misread the menu, I thought it said, small fries or 2 onion rings or 2 zucchini sticks. I choose onion rings. When my meal arrived it had 4 onion rings, I thought I had scored. But after further review, the side list for the combo said a choice of two, so since I had just picked onion rings it was two orders of two onion rings. I could have had two onion rings and two zucchini sticks, or fries and onion rings, you get the idea. Back to the onion rings, they were huge, I am guessing the onion slice was 1 inch thick, and very tasty. I believe they are made fresh with a unique batter, certainly don't taste frozen.

The soda is the Pepsi genre. I like cherry colas and they had cherry Pepsi, so that was nice. I had just come in from 104 degrees outside, so it was refreshing.

I liked the food. Certainly better than most fast food places. I will go there again, I want to try the patty melt, I noticed it after I had ordered, it's not under burgers, it's under sandwiches. It was my first time there, I know better now.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,0,3,qRAlS-vBXwJ3YQqhCp2tOw

This location isn't hidden but it's on some weird cross streets of Russell/Decatur. We decided to place a phone order instead of dining in since time was running short! I walked in and the manger looked like the only one running the front counter. I let him know my name and wow our order was ready! Now I'm not sure if I should be ready to throw confetti and praise them for this because let's be real how long and difficult is It to prepare two salads? Either way I lked the customer service and the location itself seemed pretty clean. They have this yummy looking breakfast burrito that I will for sure be stopping by in the near future to try out! For two salads only costing us under $20 I would say it was a deal! Most places charge anywhere from $11-20 depending on what kind of salad you get and what you choose for toppings!

This place had only 70 or so with a pretty high rating, so we decided to try it..   We do not have this franchise anywhere near where I live so we wanted to try it while on our stay in Las Vegas.

I do LOVE that they serve breakfast all day.

First- we went there at night- and honestly this does not seem to be in a stellar neighborhood.  There were folks loitering outside that made me uncomfortable. In fact I had my husband take his watch and ring off and put it in his pocket before we went in to order.

We were there really close to closing.  Even so the employees were very nice and did not make us feel rushed.  We had elected to eat there and they cleaned up while we ate.

I decided to have the Veggie Burger.  Its so neat to have that option at a Fast Food place like this.  I also ordered the Onion rings based on reviews here.

The Veggie burger was very good.

The Onion Rings were blah.  The batter completely tasteless and the onions were also big and tasteless.  Definitely not worth having. The Zuchinni spears were also blah. Same boring batter and I don't 
like a long, huge Zuchinni stick,  I was anticipating slices.

I'm going to take a break now from this institution until I hear that things are back to normal. I don't like writing Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde reviews - as this really disturbs me that they have lost their consistency, their overall attention to food quality and preparation and enthusiastic customer service.

Had the Double Cheeseburger and my wife had the Farmer Burger (Dbl CB with Avocado slices, and sauce). Good.

Fries are excellent, hot crispy and not breaded (Burger King, I'm talking to you!)

The Farmer Burger Combo was delivered to my table. The burger was so loaded in toppings I couldn't taste the 1/2 lb of beef. The fries were overdone. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

The combo also came with a cookie. It has been a while since I spit out a chocolate chip cookie, but this one got me to do that. Neither the texture nor the flavor was in any way good.

The menu was full of typical breakfast foods, and they even claimed to make the eggs fresh. At any kind of fast food place, that's rare. I ordered a 3 egg breakfast with ham, tropical fruit & wheat toast. 

I've gotta admit, it felt cozy when I sat down. The booths are like a breakfast nook, so it sort of reminded me of eating breakfast at my grandma's house. The food was good, not great. They weren't lying about the eggs - I could definitely tell they came from an actual egg, not some yellowy pouch of egg product stored in the freezer. The ham was decent - very salty, and one side had been griddled to death, leaving it with thick black marks. My tropical fruit was a mixed bag. The pineapple wasn't entirely ripe, neither was the honeydew, but the papaya was decent. My toast might've been good... if they hadn't globbed a huge smear of butter on it. Why would any place assume I want butter? Leave me a side of butter at the table. I'm a big boy, I can do it myself.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,2,3,3,tE6TPESvCC5xjljB7FOMOg

I ended up getting a bacon burger, special was for 7.99 normally 10.99! My son also got a childs bacon burger. The food is made to order here, so you get a number and sit and wait. I forgot to mention the cashier, he was so nice and attentive and actually gave great suggestions!

We sat and waited about 5 minutes, checked out the decor and here came our food! Upon looking at it, it looked super delectable and savory! I asked for some ranch (of course) and the server was oh so kind to bring me 2 sides! The burgers were juicy and delicious! The ranch was legit delicious! None of that hidden valley ranch crap! The fries were also yummy and they give you enough!

Overall the experience was good. The only gripe is the pricing! And also, you get 3 onion rings for 2.19! WTH!! LOL. But, like I said, go on a day where their special is good and you'll be ok!

4889032,2011-02-06,1,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"came here because a friend had a BOGO coupon for burgers. the deal ended up being a wash cuz you have to buy 1 burger and 2 drinks to get a free burger. since we were getting it to go... we really didn't need to spend $4 on 2 sodas when we could just spend $3 and change for a second burger. it would have been a waste. 

anyway.. we ordered the two burgers for our friends... i got the country fried chicken go bowl.. and my other friend got the chicken club. 

my country fried chicken was not what i expected. the chicken was more like breaded fried chicken fast food places use in a crispy chicken sandwich. think... carl's jr value chicken sandwich. the rest of the bowl consisted of hashbrowns.. and dry scrambled eggs that were trying to hide beneath the country gravy. 

luckily.. it was a friday and the go bowls were on the specials menu for the day. instead of paying $6.19 for just the bowl.. the special was $4.99 for a soda and the bowl. it was an awesome deal!! but i would not order it again.

from what i could tell.. the burgers and sandwich were okay but nothing spectacular. i dont think i would come back on my own but if someone brought me food from here i wouldnt mind giving the burgers a chance. 

avoid the go bowls at all costs!!",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,2,1,2,kHXOS6DgbJQpJYIWf-K5Kg

I know I'm elitist but I think there is a real difference between Carls Jr. and McDonalds.  Farmer Boys definitely goes int he upper category but it does something else also.

The food is ordered at a counter and then taken to your table.  the food is definitely made to order but made quickly.  So it is a fast food joint, just with really tasty food.  Oh and a pretty huge price tag.

The portions are good, the food is tasty but you pay restaurant prices for things.  I think my burger was about $8.00 and while a super deluxe whopper can run $5 or so, going to a chain restaurant like Applebee's or Chili's is about $8-9.

The decor is sort of tastefully tacky?  Kind of a Beverly Hillbillies vibe.  There's lots of simple country affect but with chandeliers and fancy faux french thrown in.  I thought it was a hoot but I was laughing at them, not with them.

Farmer Burger ($5.69)  - still Low carbing so I requested a lettuce wrap (not on the menu, but they had no problems accomodating). The meat itself is in thin patties - very fast food and I think the ones at say In n out are yummier and a bit cheaper. What this place has that you can't get at In n Out is bacon and avocado on the burger! Although the avocados were mashed, they did taste like genuine avocados - NOT some guac processed mushy crap. The bacon was nice and crisp and better than your typical fast food bacon. Honestly my lettuce wrapped burger was a bit of a mess (In n Out has that protein style thing DOWN PAT), but it was overall tasty and being able to get avocado on my burger at  fast food place is pretty sweet ! 

Their salads also looked awesome - way better looking than anything you could get at MCD's/Wendy's. Definitely will be back to try that Cobb salad with 10 net carbs that was calling my name!

Even though it looks like a fast food joint, service is like a full-service restaurant - they bring your food, refill your coffee and bus your table. I'd gladly come back here again!",c3WNlQnInQNhVDkThepkQQ,0,0,5,Fp8LEznFMAuc2KyltlvrZQ
5807738,2016-10-23,0,tXqaK0lBEE1XJbzDPsdFvg,"Went thru the Drive-thru and ordered one breakfast (Denver omelet).  As i'm pulling out of the Drive-thru I check the breakfast and it's the wrong breakfast.  Now I have to park and go inside (kind of defeats the purpose of the Drive-thru).  I wait a few mins while the girl at the counter is taking someone's order, then another girl walks up with a bag in her hand (she already knows why I'm there and apologizes).  Got to work, ate the omelet, it was ok ... nothing to write home about, but at least with the tomato slices and whole wheat bread it was very healthy.",Hlmr1pEVgPGg86ZOw-T0Dw,0,0,2,zB1HEhyWSKqC6alL5v6ziA

I had the double bacon cheeseburger combo and was quite full. I think it's a refreshing change from the usual fast food/ sit down places.",AStHl7m__BTiheHzpXvmRQ,2,1,5,pUgted2lGXEEV6TzyIK6mQ

They always have savings incentives if you are signed up on their e-club in which you can get lots of freebies and discounts. They have great breakfast and lunch regardless of what you order or what time you visit. Their food portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. My only concern lately is the service, my last experience with one of the crew leaders was extremely disappointing.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,3,4,RN2dz4HXhlXJXL0bfyZpXQ

I've ordered the ""farmhand bowl""......
Wonderful dish. The right amount of everything just waiting for a bit. Love it.
I would give five stars but I've ordered a chilly bowl as well. They have a bread bowl and a regular for the chilly. Take the bread. Don't do the mistake I did. The texture of the chilly is for bread or hot dog ,not for a regular bowl. A regular chilly bowl texture is chunky and you can see the pieces NOT GROUNDED !
Over all.....Great food.",Ez4P16pnEESSwjgzA9IWeA,1,0,4,lJnQzwm-ODxU9E5B3Moxmg

1 it was really dry 
2 the thing that made me really frustrated was size of the chicken. Are you kidding me with that small piece of chicken. It was so small I ended up moving it to the side and cut the sandwich in half so I could have all the meat on one side.  Sooo I don't recommend the chicken sandwich. Everything else was super tasty.",3hoZ7pJDrCv1plnUvcTk3A,0,0,3,197BHM5RgFduHnPuBuzIKg

When this one opened up near me hear, I can't say I was too excited. The food is just ok and I think it's a little overpriced for what you actually get. 

The only things I can say I actually enjoy here are the Ice cream shakes and their breakfast meals. Their onion rings are pretty good too, they just don't serve too many in an order, which is disappointing. Burgers are ok too.

If the prices were a tad bit lower I'd probably go more often, but as is it's more like fast food at restaurant prices.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,1,3,xUU9ti8AWdRBPQIaPdbc8w

The huge onion rings have a light breading. The fried Zucchini was long tasty spears   
Our burgers were fresh and full of flavor. The French fries are hot shoe string potatoes. 
Very much enjoyed the friendly service and the food. 
We will be back.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,1,1,5,X0HxzRqVzgabfff9r8w4DA
