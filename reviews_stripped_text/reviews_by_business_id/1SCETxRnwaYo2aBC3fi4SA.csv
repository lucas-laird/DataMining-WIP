First off, the ambiance is really nice, which is a welcomed change from some of the other nearby restaurants. Super clean and modern inside. The staff has always been extremely friendly and the service is very fast. 

While I have only ordered their crispy chicken fingers, they also sell grilled fingers which look equally as delicious. Additionally, you get a generous portion of delicious french fries. I don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it is great. 

The only thing that confuses me at PDQ is the multiple dipping sauces you can get with your order. They are all very good and you can get multiple flavors with each order - I just never know how many I can get without paying extra, so I always ask. 

Give PDQ a try! Highly recommended!",4ULgZD3JsHcT6Vysr4adlQ,0,0,4,7-D4kXeSppXYHDt5apZmuQ
148630,2016-10-20,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,I see pictures of the fried chicken strips and they look larger. Grilled chicken strips are incredible small for the price and i don't recommend them. I had the honey butter chicken sandwich and it was pretty good. The fries were decent.

178564,2016-12-22,1,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"I really wanted to like this place. The parking stalls were full and the drive through had cars lined up. It started off great. It was my first time and I did the drive through. The guy at the window, Adrian, was the kind of employee I would want to have working for me. He was friendly, informative and helpful answering all my questions. I selected the 4 piece chicken tender meal with ranch sauce, fries and a drink. 

The food (tenders and fries) were very hot which I liked. But the look, texture and taste was less than impressive. I called my girlfriend, who was dying to know how it was. I know she was hoping I could report wonderful news. I snapped a pic of the piping hot chicken tender that was happily burning my fingers. She responded with, ""It looks burnt and dry.""  

I'm a die hard ranch sauce fan but their ranch sauce would ward off an entire army of vampires.  The smell of garlic is permeating my jeep and I fear the worst for my pores.  

I really wanted to like the chicken. The price was reasonable. I wished I would have only ordered 3 tenders instead of 4 because I felt compelled not to waste them.",0H4S0Im4o4-mRbPllyei1g,1,0,2,f4zF-lbtarHaxDPUFgtVlg

From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated like family at the Sahara location. From the smiling cooks to the operating and marketing directors (who are both very friendly by the way). Antoine was an absolute pleasure to talk to as well. Go PANTHERS!!! I had the 4 piece tenders meal and although this is only my second time coming to PDQ, I just can't get the French fries. Who else offers blueberry coleslaw as a side?!! It is so well balanced and it makes me FEEL like I'm eating better by not eating fries (probably not but let me live in my fantasy world). Had the creamy garlic, honey bbq, and sweet sriracha sauces with my tenders today. The tenders were flash fried and absolutely delicious. If you're looking for typical fast food quality food you are in the wrong place. PDQ stands by its acronym. People Dedicated to Quality. I can't wait to try the other sauces and the delicious cookies that they make in house. It's so good that I will be bringing my girlfriend here for dinner even though I just ate lunch here. PDQ you are the best. All I can ask is for you to head to west Las Vegas (Summerlin). Keep up the amazing quality and customer service.

446290,2016-06-25,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"I love this place! The staff members all have positive attitudes. The interior is clean and has a wide open floor plan. It's doesn't feel too much like a fast food joint. There is a hand washing station right out in front of the doors which is unique keeps people from crowding the bathrooms. Our food was almost immediately ready, but didn't taste like it was sitting around. 

I'd have to agree with other reviewers, this place is definitely up for competition with Raising Canes. The chicken is tender and free of rubbery gristle. The breading is seasoned (a definite one-up to raising canes), and all of their sauces are made in-house. They offer grilled or fried chicken and turkey in a variety of dishes: tenders, sandwiches, salads,  etc. 

There are substitute side dishes for fries. Blueberry coleslaw is just one other option. For those of you trying to eat lightly, fruit can be substituted for fries. My coworker loves the toffee dip that is served with the apple slices. 

There are two Coca-Cola Freestyle machines and three different teas offered at the drink station. All of the teas appear to be freshly brewed.

This was my first and last time eating at this joint. What a big disappointment. 

The two stars represent the service and the cleanliness of the place that's about all I can share for this place. 

Here is Las Vegas I believe Canes, Cheesecake Factory and Buffalo Wild Wings are much better.

550894,2015-07-19,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"Was very disappointed in the service and the food.  I went thru the drive thru and ordered a 3 piece meal with buff-blue cheese sauce and a side of blueberry coleslaw and ff.  As I pulled out of the drive thru I reached into the bag for a ff and they were not hot, but cold, maybe because they were next to the coleslaw in the same bag, hot food and cold food in the same bag does not make since, the fries where in a round container, not sure if it was suppose to have a lid on it or not. I started to go back but decided no big deal, its just fries.   When I got to work I pulled everything out of the bag and guess what (NO SAUCE) great plain fried chicken. The blue berry slaw was plain at best(regular coleslaw with a couple of blueberries on top)  Overall I paid $8 for 3 pieces of fried tenders( each was the size of a roll of quarters)  So I got out my receipt and called the store to let the manager know about what happened, phone rang about 6 times and then went to voice mail.  They don't even answer the phone number on the receipt.

It does cover any of the salads in their entirety, with your choice of grilled chicken or tenders. I ordered the crispy chicken salad, total comped was $7.56.

I had the buffalo blue cheese sandwich. The bread is light and tasty. It really adds to the spicy chicken flavor. The chicken is not too crunchy and full of flavor. The blueberry coke slaw is a cool idea, but it's not as good as I hoped. That's probably because It is fresh and hasn't been sitting in it's own juices for days.

The sauces I had, Creamy Garlic, Honey Mustard and Ranch were great. The ranch seemed a little flavorless, but I tried the garlic first thinking it was ranch, so that was my guess as to why. I also had the zucchini fries, which I loved, although I thought they were a bit on the softer side of how I like things. Their lemonade from the recommendations, was spot on. I could drink gallons of it. Lastly, I got myself a Cheerwine, which I like, but have no idea where else in Vegas I could get one. All in all, if I lived nearer, I'd be going all the time.

Cons: Everything else. 

I fell victim once again to my fiance choosing a place with ZERO options for vegetarians. They are known for chicken, but also have hamburgers and salads. Would have been nice if they offered a veggie patty substitute. Only a few salads, and had I ordered one without the meat, it would have been basically just lettuce. Plus, I'm not spending $10 on a salad I can make at home. I ended up ordering a side of zucchini fries, which were absolutely disgusting. I don't know what they put in the batter, but it tasted like straight up chemicals, and was drenched in grease. The ranch had a funky taste also. I tried some of his fries, and they were tasteless and super greasy also. Our friend, however, liked his chicken club sandwich. Never again.",u2kUEnt88S7iumV-3Vdmbg,0,1,1,brzIpHzdpjk6i-E45QPT5Q

1098531,2016-10-23,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"I just ate here for the first time. This place is basically a bootleg Raising Canes. Unfortunately, their sandwiches and chicken (in general) don't even come close to tasting as good as Raising Cane's.

The seasoning they use for the batter is way too salty. The portion size is OK. They barely put any mayo on the sandwich at all though. I'd say their chicken sandwich is maybe 1 step above McDonald's and Jack in the Box but below Raising Canes. I can't wait until Chic-Fil-A opens here in Vegas!

The only plus about this place is that they have Cheer Wine and you can buy a whole case of it for $32.39 total... which comes out to about $1.35 a bottle.

I am disappointed overall because earlier reviews by other people led me to believe this place was on par (if not better) than Raising Canes.

The other thing that bothered me is that they like to take their sweet time with making your meal. At Raising Canes, I always had my food in less than 5 mins. At this place, even though there were 4 employees in the kitchen, it took them more than 10 minutes to make my little sandwich and some fries and I was the only person in line... oh and the fries were horrible... super thin shoestring fries, lukewarm, no real flavor, slightly burned",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,1,0,2,XXguCZGr0MU-sv3qiN9MHQ

That is a plus in my book! Almost every chicken place Ive been to they charge for extra sauce. The PDQ cheeseburgers were delicious, my 7 and 4 year old loved them! The only thing I noticed was that the cheeseburger dont come with onions and I always want onions on my cheeseburger. I loved the sauce that it came with. Towards the end of our meal a manager came and ask if we liked our food and if we needed or were going to order anything else.

Went back that same weekend and got terrible service, coworker had also received terrible service. We called and let the manager know of our bad experience. He offered free food and a tour which doesn't make up for bad service. Our entire workplace vowed to never return to PDQ due to the poor service. 

We never did set a foot in the restaurant and hadn't eaten the food since. We find out that Uber eats delivers PDQ so we figured we would place an order so we wouldn't have to actually go experience the service first hand. Our driver shows up with the food only to find out PDQ forgot ten chicken tenders and a chicken sandwich. Called to let them know and they said we could come pick up the food any time. The whole point of placing an order for delivery is so we didn't have to actually go there. On top of that all six boxes of fries were half full with greasy, soggy, wet noodle looking fries. Then the manager hangs up on my coworker. 

This entire experience confirms that PDQ does not stand for what it says and offers horrible service and a poor customer experience.",vyKnnHRgSXm_XNFNTlH2cg,1,0,1,sAenp2Er_Suin86I1GceDA

1976756,2016-04-10,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"I like this place and it's a nice new addition to my drive thru options!  If you were to compare it to a competitor, I would say it's on the level of raising canes, although this is personal preference, I like it better. (Cue the Raising Canes fans saying whaaaat?!?!?!)

Why is it better than raising canes?  Because of the menu selection and sauces. Don't be presumptuous and assume every customer wants the same thing. PDQ offers salads and other items that incorporate their chicken. They also offer crispy & grilled chicken  for those seeking variety. There's several sauces to choose from, at no additional charge such as buffalo, bbq, sarichia, blueberry, ranch, & more. 

Food quality: we've only ordered the chicken strips crispy with fries and a variety of sauces on the side. The chicken strips are good, crispy, appear to be real chicken, and travel well home. I'm not huge on this style of fries (whole potato w skin, fried but not crispy), so they don't elicit any oohs or aahs from me. But they weren't bad. One day I'll venture out of my comfort zone & try the blueberry coleslaw. 
The sauces are what sets this place apart from competitors. My personal fave is the sweet sarichia, second is the bbq. The ranch is a bit too salty. They have a blueberry dipping sauce which had a unique flavor. It was good, but won't be a goto sauce. 
Added bonus: You can order extras at no additional cost. I like to get one I like and rotate in a new flavor. 

Service: we've only ordered at the drive thru. A person takes your order (in person) at the first window, you pay. Then roll up to the second window for your order. It's quick & the food seems to be fresh. It travels well for those taking it a few miles away.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,3,1,4,ewacDCObvy8WUbvtk0HJBQ

I got the grilled turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. Very tasty sandwich with a nice meaty lean piece of turkey. Had to get a chicken tender to try and the blueberry cole slaw. Omg the chicken is moist and cooked perfectly with a nice crunch. Wow! The breading on the tender is light and crispy, not dripping in oil and tasting of old yucky oil. I was a little hesitant to try the blueberry coleslaw but wow, yummilicous!!  They have a bunch of cool sauces too! I tried the honey BBQ (Yum). But what blew me away was the fresh-cut fries!!! Holy fries!! Prob one of the best fresh-cut fries I've ever tried!! So well seasoned you don't even need ketchup!! Nice and thin like I like them. 

I also want to say that not only does this place serve tasty well-made food, the service was amazing. We ordered our food from the manager Chris who asked if this was our first time. He was so nice and helpful and brought our food to us promptly. At the end of our meal he came over to ask us how we liked it and we of course said Awesome!!

My food came out quickly and I was on my way. Everything came out HOT. I ordered the 4 pc chicken tenders, with fries and a drink. I also ordered the garlic sauce, ranch, and buffalo for dipping! No charge for extra sauces :) The garlic sauce was bomb. Creamy, garlicky, it tasted just like a garlic ranch. The ranch sauce was kind of weird. It didn't taste very ranchy and was similar to the garlic sauce but without any garlic. I wouldn't order ranch again from here. The buffalo blue was a hot buffalo sauce and was pretty good. The fries were skin on and came out crispy. They were very tasty as well, seasoned just right. To drink I just got a boring Sprite- but they do have the Freestyle machine so you can get any drink you want.

2178510,2015-07-25,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"The Skinny: the chicken tenders combo is pretty delicious! 4 star quality but the other menu items are only okay (3.5) service: quick and efficient although the cashiers do forget to ask about what sauces you want. Love the ambience. (3) value: meals are a little skimpy on the size of the chicken but very generous on the fries (3.5).

There are some serious things to love about PDQ. The best thing is the chicken fingers combination.  Lightly battered and fried, the tenders are especially tender and juicy. Only complaint are the chicken fingers are a bit on the smaller size for the price. The hand cut fries are pretty good as well with their crisp shoestring sized exterior. I have not tried their coleslaw which is a healthier option instead of fries. For a drink, try their lemonade which they have behind the counter. They will happily refill this for you as well. I found it a bit strong but when diluted with lots of ice,  it works well. 

We tried their honey bbq and honey mustard sauces which are both pretty good. 

If it was just this item alone,  this joint would get 4 stars. However because we tried some other lackluster items which prevent the bump up. 

The fried chicken sandwich was okay. Although the chicken is good the ratio of chicken to the bun is way off. (too much bun... not enough chicken) Also when we ordered this,  they never asked what sauce we wanted with it so it was a bit plain when we had it. Definitely ask for sauce! 

I tried their grilled chicken salad which albeit edible was pretty mediocre. Their grilled chicken tastes more generic - a bit too tough, dry and salty. The salad tastes like the standard iceberg mix you get from a bag from the grocery store with that slightly dehydrated texture from being cut and sitting in a bag for a while. They go heavy on the blueberry dressing which I found to be overly sweet. I would probably pass on this in the future. 

I also tried the crispy chicken salad with the honey mustard dressing. Although the flavoring of the salad is better, it still doesn't even rank up with the chicken fingers combination.

We also tried their brewed iced teas. The green tea had an unpleasant floral tone to it and I cannot recommend it. The brewed iced tea/sweet tea is okay albeit a bit weakly brewed. Probably would be better if you mixed the iced tea with the lemonade and made yourself an Arnold Palmer. 

This place is clean and spacious. I love the fact they have a hands free sink outside the bathrooms so you can wash your hands before/after eating. 

Service is quick and efficient when it comes out. Ordering does take a few minutes though as they only  have 2 cashiers. 

Overall, I like this place -  the fried chicken tender combination is well priced and the sauces are good. I would come back just for that as their other items are decided weaker. 3.5 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,1,3,ic7RlWva-TcEdslNRKSMCg

When you step inside, you see a large and open nice view of the whole establishment and are welcomed by the rest of the staff.

The menu itself is simple, but in a good way.  Too many places in Lad Vegas try to cater to the masses by offering too much of a selection.  

PDQ is all about the chicken tenders, salads, chicken sandwiches, and drinks.  This is first time I have ever seen Cheerwine on this side of the country, too.  

From the moment we placed our order for two fried five-piece meals with fries and drinks, we knew PDQ would set themselves to be a jump ahead other places that specialize in chicken tenders.  The chicken is juicy and has flavor, too.

You are given the option of having your chicken fried in a batter or grilled.  The fries also taste so fresh and the sea salt makes them taste better, too.  Another thing is that there is a large tasty selection of sauces for your meal that you can select from.

We are not reviewing Giada on The Strip, frankly some people should be embarrassed that they even attempted to sound as pretentious in their reviews as they do. That is beside the point. Here's the deal:

The selection is great, you can get all sorts of variations of sandwiches, tenders, salads, and sides. 

The chicken is fresh, it is well seasoned and not dry. The chicken from here tastes like chicken made with love. Not the hate filled chicken of Chick-Fil-A. 

The french fries are deliciously seasoned and well fried. They always come out fresh and crisp. Nothing on earth is better than fresh fries. 

Sauces-a-plenty! There is a huge sauce selection that you can keep coming back for more of. They are not stingy and the associates do not act like their job is on the line if they hand over any extra condiments. God forbid a person needs more sauce. 

The staff is courteous and friendly and always willing to go above and beyond for you. The food is ready quickly and brought out to you. 

Can we talk about the soap they offer by the little wash bin? SMELLS AMAZING. 

The layout is great and holds many people in a non crowded fashion, because who on earth wants to eat their meal next to the creepy IT guy Larry that hasn't showered in two days? ( I work in IT). 

Bottom line, get off your high horse and go eat some tasty chicken at a friendly, clean, and well rounded fast food joint.",F4DjrMmTFuLWCQzpOk7R-Q,2,1,5,MWd7uk99B-GZhCp30E7gCg

Stopped into PDQ out of hunger and curiosity. Once you walk in this place, it's actually nice for a fast food chicken joint. In other words, it's not greasy and tacky looking, PDQ looks like an actual restaurant.

This place is definitely over staffed. I swear all the staff was friendly. Maybe too friendly every other bite had someone asking me how I was if I needed anything, lol. But seriously they were all great! 

Ok the guy in the white chef shirt brought me my order and threw in a huge fresh order of strips. He said they were extra. Holy crap that is a lot of food. 6 strips (so juicy and yummy), california club (the best chicken sandwich I have ever had!), fries (these ones were kinda over cooked), blueberry cole slaw (sweet). And my cup of iced tea. Out of the dipping sauces I loved the honey mustard and the garlic ranch! Honey BBQ is very sweet and doesn't have that smokey BBQ flavor. The Siracha BBQ had the smokey flavor with a bit of a tang.

It was different experience than most drive thru' s. You can review the menu, then pull up to the first window and put in your order. I placed an order for the fingers.  You have the option of fries or blueberry coleslaw.  I'm not a fan of any type of coleslaw so I went with the fries.  Which came out hot and seasoned. There's no size options for the fries,  but they came out in a large box.  I also had the lemonade,  it was super sweet.  Make sure to add water to even out the sweetness.  The tenders can be crispy or grilled.  I chose the crispy tenders they were good,  a little small,  but good.  On the box it states their chicken ia 100% natural.  I must admit their chicken is better than most fast food restaurants. You can really taste the difference.  The service through the driveway was fast!

The only thing that confuses me at PDQ is the multiple dipping sauces you can get with your order. They are all very good and you can get multiple flavors with each order - I just never know how many I can get without paying extra, so I always ask.

This location is the second one in Vegas with plans to open more according to the staff that assisted me today. Everyone is friendly and attentive to your needs which is rare in a fast food joint.

Instead, the tenders were placed on top of the fries.  Because I was served PDQ, the tenders were so hot that I had to cut through them to get to the fries destroying some of the crispness below.  I got the bleu cheese and sweet Sriracha dipping sauces.  Hands down the Sriracha was best.

Service was very prompt.  I sat at the counter and the tray was delivered directly to me.

Kui, the manager insisted we go back and try them again.
My friend who had the salad said that this time around it was way better tasting than the last time, and no gelatinous dressing.
My other friend who thinks chicken is just chicken, and can't differentiate, said it's the same - chicken. (Don't even get me started)
I also ordered the same thing, but I am still not swayed. I just don't care for the tenders. They are cool, so if a friend wanted to go, I'd probably go back, but not on my own accord.

After we finished my husband wanted to try a shake, he went with chocolate oreo. I had my eye on the chocolate peanut butter cookie. Both were awesome. We also thouroughly enjoyed a 2nd order of the apple slices!! We were then treated with a cranapple oatmeal cookie by the Chef that was better than the peanut butter IMO.

4758808,2017-10-05,2,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"""People Dedicated to Quality"". That's what PDQ stands for. And as I was on an empty stomach after making the long road trip into Las Vegas, this is where my lady and I ended up stopping for lunch (on the afternoon of Fri 9/29/17) prior to checking into our hotel room. I know that we don't need yet another fast food chicken place. There's KFC.. There's Popeye's.. There's Chick-fil-A. So how does ""PDQ"" measure up to the big boys of chicken? Well let's just find out.

Located directly on the corner of W. Sahara Ave. & Richfield Blvd. in the Westside neighborhood of Las Vegas, this located has been serving up their delicious chicken ever since 2015. Since I have never stepped foot into one of their restaurants, I had no idea of taste, quality, and service. Fortunately, the respectable amount of Yelp reviews gave me more than enough reason that this would be a quick and inexpensive place to dine.

The inside of this place is very bright, lively, and cheerful. And the employees were super friendly as they said ""Welcome to PDQ!"" as soon as my lady and I walked in. What I particularly loved was that it was extremely clean and spacious. There was an abundance of seating throughout. There is no outdoor seating though. But they do have a drive-thru just in case you wish to take your food to-go.

Their menu is rather extensive as they carry chicken & nuggets (all by themselves), salads, sandwiches, bowls, and shakes. And what does make them special is that they offer a total of 8 homemade sauces. Its very similar to Chick-fil-A in that sense but since PDQ has far less locations nationwide, perhaps their food is of better quality. The good news is that they never freeze their chicken while never adding any hormones and steroids.

As I really was curious to how their chicken batter way, I ended up ordering their ""Crispy Chicken Sandwich"". This was a hand-breaded chicken breast complete with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and Grillo's pickles. I also opted for a side of their cool fresh Blueberry Coleslaw. And to drink, I tried one of their freshly squeezed lemonades. Total price for this entire meal, only about $9. My lady ordered the same thing as myself but with French fries as her side.

As far as the time it took for our food to arrive, my lady's meal came out very quickly, within 3 minutes actually. Mine, on the other hand took about 15 minutes. The cashier who rung me up was very apologetic since my meal was taking so long and she gave me a coupon for a FREE sandwich for a future visit. The only problem is that I live nearly 600 miles away from here! So that option would be a little difficult unless I visit Las Vegas in the very near future.

As far as my sandwich, the chicken was flavored and seasoned very well. The only drawback is that it was a bit on the salty side. No big deal because everything else including the toasted bun was delicious. I also liked the blueberry cole slaw as that was delicious and actually a little bit tastier than what you'd find at KFC.

The food was DAAAAANG good. I was not impressed with the garlic sauce, as I could barely taste any garlic (and I likes me some garlic, so don't tease me). I tried a couple of their other sauces and ended up just using catsup on my zucchini fries because they were all just OK. The fries were just OK, too. Hubby was over the moon with his burger. I had the butter chicken and it was amaze-balls (but still needed more garlic). They lost a star for the ""meh"" sauces and because they only had two of those pick-from-1,000-choices drink dispensers, and only one worked, so there was always a line while we waited for each person to go through the entire menu and then choose Sprite. They did have some really good iced teas, though. Unfortunately, the ice was dispensed from the billion-choice machine, too, so you couldn't get to that without waiting in line, either.

""People dedicated to quality"" couldn't be more true. You can see it in their customer service and you can taste it in their food. A simple concept that is often hard to come by these days with other places. 

Food:
- Chicken tenders: Super tender and juicy with just the right amount of seasoning and breading. 

- Fries: FRESH CUT fries! I liked it! I am actually very picky about fries. (Shh...not a fan of in & out fries!)

- Sauces: They really hook you up here! It is unlimited, so indecisive people just try 'em all. I really like the creamy garlic and sweet sriracha. The buffalo, bleu buffalo, and honey bbq weren't too bad. I have yet to try the honey mustard, ranch, and chipotle bbq sauces.

I love that they are big community supporters. On my first visit, there was a pink t-shirt and milk shake promo for breast cancer awareness month. For Veterans day, they are honoring free tenders or sandwich for vets / active military. 

Fair prices, unlimited sauces, desserts, seasonal shakes, and fresh tasting fast food will keep me coming back!

They were very welcoming and understood that we could get recalled at anytime to attend to the Vegas EMS needs. Food was quickly delivered and very hot and fresh. Great price on my work budget. It compares to Canes chicken fingers but they have salads and sandwiches as well. Enjoyed the spicy ranch. I only ordered the chicken tenders. My partner has grilled tenders and fried Zucchini.

That said, the food is delicious too. To be fair- I only ever get the Turkey sandwhich meal, but it's always been consistently great. And when I've asked if I could sample the blueberry slaw- not only were they more than happy to let me try it, they gave me the entire side for free. 

This place is what all fast food joints should aspire to. The service and quality control feels like that corny 1960's style service you only ever see in the movies- but in a very good way.

The lady was friendly and asked for my name first before taking my order.   Then when I got to the second window, the lady addressed me by name, which was a shock especially because I was using the drive thru.  It just shows they get the name for a reason, making personable customer service.  She was smiling and friendly, she even apologized for the wait (which wasn't long at all!!) just overall great customer service.   I know this place is new, but the workers seem like they don't hate their job and they're happy to help you. I hope this part doesn't change as time goes by.   

Food.  I ordered the tenders, you can get them grilled or fried.  Can't name many places where you can get this option, especially for a fast food chain.  I don't think you can mess up tenders so they're average to me, just a warning if you like it crispy ... these are not for you.   

Sauces.  They're all free and you can get as many or little you like.  I love that!!! Most places are so stingy with their sauces as if they're gold.  I didn't want to seem greedy so I tried their sweet sriracha and honey BBQ. 

Side.  You can choose fries or cole-slaw as your side.  I decided on trying their fresh cut fries, which are similar to five guys fries.

They also have the large soft drink machine where your selection of drinks are unlimited.   After all that, you can add a soft baked cookie to your meal for $0.99.   Their cookies are soft and chewy.   

Side note.   I did see on my receipt that she wrote the description of my car near my name, I did think it was a little awkward, but maybe they do this when they're super busy and they have cars pull around, at least that's the best explanation that I can come up with.   

This location is not my normal commute, but if I'm in the area, this overall experience today made it definitely worth visiting again !",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,3,2,4,vguBrhk6tO8oZjC6MpjifQ

They greet you upon arrival and are very attentive. They all seem to be happy there. The dining area is pleasant and while their competition Chick Fil A is really good too, it is so overwhelmingly busy sometimes. Sometimes hectic. I love PDQ's soda machine and options for flavors. The quality of their chicken fingers are really fresh and so are their fries. Today the fries tasted like they had been out for a while but this was the only time. I love their cheeseburgers too. I was surprised not to really like the chicken sandwich though. Overall, I am glad PDQ opened so when Chick Fil A is busy we can enjoy our lunch there. Thank you PDQ for having a variety of delectable eats beyond chicken.",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,0,0,5,4f9DRVB1DRpnkC2yOaelSg

The French fries are really good, we added some malt vinegar to them.  The ranch that came with the chicken was garlicky and tasty.  Cesar salad was very good and my California club was good too!  We will be back, hope they open stores on the east side soon!",kKwQDkTOSzOaIdsPLIrh3g,0,0,4,LJXdITO6oE6B-o1flCFXTg

I must say when she told me she was serving apples and dip I kind of chuckled and thought that sounded like a kiddie party....but, if you order from here GET THE APPLES!  Lol.

So here it goes ~Am I a fan of PDQ?

Well I have to say I have never heard of this place before stopping here the other night.
It was bright from the road so we decided to check it out.

We went in not knowing what we were in store for. 

The first thing I seen they carried was Cherwine Soda! We do not drink much soda anymore but being a fan of this soda from back east I we had to get one to share. They do charge a .10 up charge to get instead of the fountain drink.

Staff was very friendly. The girl at the register was great. She was pleasant and very helpful after we told her it was our first time here.
The place was clean and not busy at all. Of course just being after Christmas I am sure everyone was home eating left overs and it was New Years Eve everyone was getting ready to party! 

Well we both decided on the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. We were told of a couple of other sides we decided to get the blueberry coleslaw as a extra just to try it.

We do not go to fast food that often so believe it or not have not have not tried the new soda machines with all the flavors in it. That alone is amazing! We did get the sweet tea which was pretty good, not real sweet.

We did try a couple of sauces on the side with the fries. The sweet sriracha one is good and blue cheese was ok, and got some buffalo sauce to dunk the sandwich in.

So the verdict ~
The fries were homemade ~ They give you a bunch, I suggest eating them fast because when they get cold they are not that good. 
The sandwich ~ Not enough sauce on it, it was kinda dry, luckily we asked for some sauce on the side to use. The bread not sure what the roll is they used but it was a bit dry kinda stale tasting. We should have went up and said something but we don't usually complain and it was edible as long as you had your drink with it. 
The chicken? Was good. Being a fan of Canes Chicken it is hard to compare. The chicken was tender and moist and had a good flavor to it.
The blueberry coleslaw. We both say skip! It is not that good. Kinda of a dry coleslaw. We both were not fans of it at all until I added a packet of mayo to it. Then it was not too bad. We would not get this again,

Would we go back? Maybe to try at another time to get one of the chicken dinners not a sandwich or the coleslaw.

It was not a WOW factor for us. It was not disgusting and we would suggest everyone to try for yourself.  It is a nice place and clean that is a plus!
 
Just eat your fries first!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,9,6,3,U_o_VbZLPUYrTKiBw4KoGg

I'm new to the fast food game, and I try to eat on the cleaner side, so PDQ is tight up my alley if you are forced to combine the two and after a long morning of moving, this combo was just what the doctor ordered. I kept it simple and ordered a mix of the breaded and grilled tenders. The breading was light and crispy. The meat was tender. The fries were, meh. Not quite crispy, not quite soft... but hey, I'm a picky fry gal. 

The sauces and service made this place stand out. All made in house, I fell in love with the honey mustard. I was even offered a coupon for my next time in because I was a first timer!!

Not sure this will be my first stop when looking for a healthy and hearty lunch, but I look forward to trying one of their many burger and sandwich selections next.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,25,20,4,HCZQemQ-3cgkxwsANr3CLw
5886279,2017-05-31,0,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,The food is okay but I tried going through the drive thru at 8:45 which they close at 9 on weekdays and I pulled up to the window and the worker saw me sitting waiting to be greeted and she continued to sit and play on her phone instead of at least telling me that they were closing or whatever the reason she wasn't coming to the window was. It was extremely rude I probably won't be coming back to this location.,6zQn7DkWS-e-WD0XQ6ga-A,0,0,1,OdJ8RZd4N62_vZ72XM-DWg

Service was incredible, all the young folks there smiled, very outgoing, called you by your name at the pickup window... What a great job of hiring and training help! Nice to see that in Vegas. 5 stars for the staff!
The crispy chicken tenders were very good, the sauces were great, obviously homemade. Crispy Chicken Sandwich was very good. We liked this much better than Kanes.  Was it better than Chick-fil-a ? Could go ether way, if you like texture and heavier bun..yes. 

We will be going back for sure...",zBdfduwvbKUy8tnDLAM9Xg,4,4,4,WzHhnl7UnHp5rj35SFJ1lw
5954758,2016-09-30,1,1SCETxRnwaYo2aBC3fi4SA,"So good! Came here for a quick, and fairly healthy, lunch. I was not disappointed. 

I ordered the Cali Club with fries and ranch. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. The brioche bun was perfect, a great sandwich. And the food came it very quickly, I was surprised. Got my bf the Grilled Chicken sandwich and he really enjoyed it too. 

The fries were good, not great. I got drive thru so I'm sure they're better fresh. They make their own sauces and I really liked the ranch. It had some other seasoning added to it and that was a nice touch. 

I've always driven by this place and I'm glad I stopped by and gave a try. I'll definitely add this to my lunch/dinner rotation.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,2,1,5,F9pZNfGo3SDz5g6R68pRpQ
