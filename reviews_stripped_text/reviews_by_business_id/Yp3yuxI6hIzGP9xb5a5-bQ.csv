I have now been to this place 4 times and the last time will be the LAST time! Every single time I have gone to this location there are only 2 things I can rely on..

1) the service will be crappy
2) the portions will be cheap and small

Do these people think that by constantly shorting people on the portions that they're paying for that they are somehow saving money?? You may save 20 or 30 cents here and there, but you are pissing off and driving away regular repeat customers. Brilliant.

It;s a pity. I enjoy KFC's product and was so psyched to have one so close to the house, but it sucks to always get home and see you've been short changed...EVERY SINGLE TIME!

3152753,2016-03-11,0,Yp3yuxI6hIzGP9xb5a5-bQ,Drive thru is not the way to order here. Better off going to the one that is farther away on Durango. Third time in the last few weeks they have messed up my order. Ordered my meal and asked for extra crispy. She repeats order back which they should always do but says original. I correct her and say no can I please have extra crispy. She said okay and repeated my order back to me. I should have checked the order before I left because of the two previous times but as usual was just too tired. Not worth the hassle of driving back or calling it in to fix It. So if you go to this KFC I would recommend going inside. You are better off going to church's which is right down the street if you want to go drive thru. This Drive thru never gets it right.

If you consider almost a 20m wait as fast food.

Understandably - most fast food establishments serve drive thru customers faster than dine in customers...

However when other patrons who order after you get their food before you - you have to wonder ?!?

Cornelius said... oh we were waiting for the popcorn chicken ?  then instantly my order is made. 

The #7 food was at room temperature - so you would think they wouldn't prep half of the order if still cooking popcorn chicken ?
So one order is semi-hot ?!? mash hot but popcorn chicken warm and the other room temperature ?!?

Well that would be nice to know there is a WAIT BEFORE you order not 20 mins after you order.

We could have chosen another option.
Or maybe even another restaurant !

First of all customer service is horrible. When I walked in I was not greeted, employees standing around the restroom talking to friends. 
When I approached the counter I was look at like what the heck do you want. 
I place my order was never looked at or think. 
I ask for a receipt was told it will be in the bag like I was asking for something special. By the way it was never in the bag. 
Was handed my food employee turned around and went back to do something else never ask if I needed anything else. 

Since I never got the receipt to call them back I did call corporate and left a message on their voicemail, and I filled out a report online.

I got a callback from corporate I told him that went went on and what had happened and they took the information down and thank me for my call.

I then got a call from someone that called yourself the district manager scolded me for calling and talking to corporate. Never said she was sorry. Never offered a replacement meal. Just basically told me that I should not call corporate again.

I've been called corporate again and let them know that I got a call from someone that scolded me for calling and reporting this to them. They told me that I would not be contacted by the store or anybody again and that they were very sorry.

I then got a call from the owner who seemed very irritated that I called corporate to begin with, that I did not like what her district manager had told me, and that I was only trying to get a free meal. That she would only offer me this meal ones and that if I ever got food that wasn't satisfactory again I need to bring it back to her. Basically telling me that the only reason I was complaining was to get a free meal. I told her that I did not want the free meal that I would never be back to her store again and she could take a free meal and keep it. Basically telling me that I was a liar that her food in her service was great. From reading these complaints online I see that this is a common practice of shorting people food and delivering bad service as well as bad food.
