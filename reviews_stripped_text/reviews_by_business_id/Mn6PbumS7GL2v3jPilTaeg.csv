I'm not sure if our Asian (perhaps philipino) waiter did not have strong English but he would not take my order to switch the paneer for veggies.  I asked if the paneer in my dish could be substituted for veggies and he kept trying to convince me to get a completely different dish.  It was VERY frustrating I've never dealt with that before.  Finally I became extremely irritated and told him to go ask because that's all I wanted. Sure enough I got what I asked for which restaurants are usually very accommodating about so I figured he was just a bad waiter.,45zYH4vddg1alAwG1e0HcQ,1,0,3,Q-9T_Pd4CspLMbC9nJ6BYw

Great choice in picking Tamba!  We had made reservations for Thursday night at 7, but didn't need them b/c the place was dead when we got there.  It picked up as the night went on, but I think the location (hidden in a building behind the Hawaiian market) makes it a tough find.  We both ordered entrees instead of the buffet.  She ordered a chicken curry and I ordered the eggplant dish.  Both oh-so yum with excellent spice and seasoning.  We also got rice and naan to split, and a $30 bottle of wine.  Our total damage?  About $60.  Cheap for Vegas, huh?

You get a good variety of indian food (mostly vegetarian) and its around $13. What is the funniest thing about this place is where it is located. It is inside a, what seems to be an abandoned food court type building, and is the only that has been running ever since I first came here 4 years ago. Seriously, I have never seen any other store in this food court open. 
I think if you dont mind eating a little unhealthy indian food that tastes decent you should check this place out.

As I was eating the people in the next booth tried to order Saag Paneer as an Entree and the waiter told them that it has gone bad so he cannot serve them. I called the  waiter and asked him if Sag Paneer was bad then why did he serve me. He did not have a clear answer and tried to wiggle out of the situation. Then I asked to speak with the manager and brought the same issue to his attention. The Manager (guy with beard) started yelling at me - if it was bad then why did I eat it. Shameful answer (blame the customer). 

I asked him for the check, paid the bill and left. Not going there ever again. I am stressed right now and feeling I will get sick eating bad food. Do not want to get sick while traveling for work.

Decided on the buffet, and was told that we would have to pay before being seated. Was told the buffet was $40 dollars for two people. Gave the front desk a $100 bill. 

Tamba Cashier: Do you have anything smaller? 
Me: No, I don't. (I wanted to get the change) 
TC: We can't break this bill. 
Me: So, how will I get my change back? 
TC: Well, we don't have anything else, because everybody else has been paying with $100 bills. 

At this point, I was going to argue with the cashier, talk to the manager, or suggest that they go to one of the other restaurants nearby to break a few hundreds to manageable change for their register, but my date pulled out her wallet and paid the bill. 

During the meal, asked for a Coke and a lassi, which added another $5.39 to the total bill. Turns out that drinks aren't included in a $20/person buffet. What?  (But water is free, so don't think you can't get a bargain out of Las Vegas.) If the Coke is coming out from a fountain station, is it normal to ask the diner, ""Do you want ice in that?"" 

Leaving the restaurant, had the bill for the drinks with me and $6 ready to pay. 

Me: Hey, we also got drinks. I'd like to pay up. (Hands the bill and money over.) 
TC: Sir, we don't have any change available and can't give you your $.61 back ... (while holding $1 to give back to me) 
Me: You know what, just keep it. Peace out. 

The food review: We wish that there were tags describing what we were eating. Wanting to try something new, we had passed by Tamba before while walking the Strip, just because we didn't know it was at the Hawaiian Marketplace. Her being vegetarian, Indian food was a good choice since meat isn't so prevalent in the diet.  She says that the food was spicier than what she was prepared for, but there was a nice variety.  As someone who will eat everything, it was a pleasant meal and flavorful.

I understand the need to economize during this economy, but plastic plates for the buffet and plastic cups for water?  And the containers for sauces are little styrofoam bowls?  What an ecological disaster.  For the Coke and lassi, we were given glass tumblers, which was good, I guess.

Last night's experience made sure that I will never visit this place again and would never recommend Tamba to any visitors to Las Vegas. Main issues that they have:

1) Extremely arrogant staff that leads to Horrible service and also wrong dishes being served.
2) Very poor quality of food. One out of 3 dishes we ordered had double salt in it!! When questioned about these, their answer is: Sometimes these things happen.

THE MENU has a good selection of Indian fare. The mixed tandoori grill and two mixed feasts represent a good mix of Indian dishes for those new to Indian food. 
THE FOOD was excellent. I am no expert of Indian food, but everyone raved about it. My tamarind shrimp was definitely spicy, but not excessively so. The mixed tandoori grill was excellent for those who do not like spicy food.
THE PRESENTATION was good, especially for the mixed feasts and the grill. instead of just slopping the various dishes on the plate, each one is in a nice  stainless container.
THE SERVICE was excellent, even though we had a large party. We had several people who had never eaten Indian food and the waiter took the time to explain the various dishes, how to eat them and various nuances of Indian food.

However, last year i noticed that they had started serving tourist buses which hoard the place like bees to honeycomb. Last year I ignored it but this year when we visited the place again it turned out to be a big mistake. The server asked us to wait outside while they kept accepting 3-4 tour buses(about 100-150 ppl) one after other in front of us. In addition, they asked us to pay upfront for the buffet which is something I have never experienced at any decent restaurant.  We waited for 20 mins watching hoard of Indian tourists going in and out of the place. We asked the server if we can go in and check the spread of buffet but we couldnt even get a sneak peek of the spread because the place was full of overflowing tourists like washroom of a football stadium. We left place and returned the next day for lunch. It was the same story all over again. I am guessing the management only cares about making money and not providing any service.

Not even upon special request.

Service by a certain server named Anand (tall guy, grey hair) was much below par. The only the only thing he did promptly was to take the initial order. For every thing else (water, soda, extra naan) we had to raise our hand in hope that this server would notice and come to the table.


We even had to wait long to get the check and the receipt. All this on a Tuesday night - not weekend.

When I tipped him apt to the service reveived (it was not zero. There was still some tip). This server totally lost his cool and started shouting abusive language in front of my kids. 

Not coming back here. Not even in a decade. Would prefer McDonald's to this place.

Having lived in India as foodies for 20 yrs i can say that this is undoubtedly the BEST high-end Indian restaurant in the city. The food isn't loaded with spice... and the ingredients are fresh and aromatic. Been here couple of times whenever I visited Las Vegas.  To begin, this is a fine dining experience & the ambiance is good.  Brilliant food, brilliant service and a wonderful atmosphere! The waiters were very friendly. The atmosphere is very calm, perfect for a dinner after sunset. The food is a perfect replica of authentic indian food, and the most real indian food you'll find in Las Vegas possibly in even The whole west coast. The menu is vast and full of variety. Can be a perfect setting for a romantic or group dining. For all veg/ Non-Veg eaters, I recommend you should try their signature dish because you will be blown away, trust me. What else can you ask for. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in town.  A special note to Mr. Rishi Kappor ( GM of Tamba ) 
"" It was a tremendous experience dining at your restaurant. Thank you so much for your outstanding professionalism and warm hospitality shown to us.

At first, this place only had 3 chicken dishes in the buffet. The buffet consisted mainly of North Indian and South Indian dishes. 

Starting with 3 chicken dishes, the Tandoori Chicken was the worst tandoori chicken I had in my life. Tiny drumsticks, dry and overcooked chicken is the best way this tandoori chicken can be described. Chicken curry and chicken tikka masala were okay and edible. 

Among the South Indian dishes, idli (rice cake) was very dry. Sambhar (curry that goes with idli) was okay. 

Among North Indian dishes, Black dal was not good at all. Naan was dry with no garnishing as opposed to the picture shown in one of the pictures posted by someone. There was zucchini dry dish mixed in Indian spices which was tasting like pumpkin. This was the first time I had seen this dish in any Indian restaurant. I don't discourage creativity but this was not a stand out creation. Navratna korma was okay taste wise. 

Taking about deserts, there were two deserts: rice pudding and carrot halwa. These are two most famous deserts in Indian cuisine. Unfortunately, both the recipes were disaster. Both the recipes were too too sweet as if they have got extra supply of sugar...

We went here for their lunch buffet and were not impressed. The ambiance is nice, but it's a little creepy to walk into the building as it's pretty much deserted but for the 1 tenant (Tamba).

The buffet sucked -- only 3 appetizers (one was a salad), a few vegetarian curries and rubbery naan that no one replenished in the 2 hrs we were there. The curries were not spiced and lacked any flavor, it was very bland and uninspired. One of the curries was an odd choice for a North Indian restaurant (squash...TF?).

For dinner, highly recommend ordering pani puri to start with. The puri was crispy and the pani perfectly made. Also don't miss out on the lamb chops! Weird to order at an Indian restaurant but honestly they were incredible. We kept ordering more and more plates because we just couldn't stop eating them! Oh course we tried all the stables, butter chicken, chicken biryani, paneer tikka, palak panner, garlic naan and raitha. Everything was delicious and nothing was left over. The dishes are kinda on the small side so it's good for sharing and trying a bunch of items.

We never would have ventured into the Hawaiian Marketplace for food--never. After reading the reviews and finding a coupon in the Vegas 24/7 booklet, we went.

It was exactly as stated, totally deserted. We wondered whether it was open when we arrived at about 8:30. By the time we left, it filled to overflowing with mostly Indian clientele (which is telling). I think the dinner buffet began around 9 PM. 

My husband and I are big fans of Indian, but we always find it hard to get really good and not just mediocre Indian cuisine. There's lots of mediocrity out there in terms of Indian. Tamba was really really tasty. We tried two new dishes which we enjoyed. 

The first was Panipuri, an Indian street food, which involves a hollow shell made of Indian crispy bread which you fill with a green spicy sauce which is supplied separately. Thanks to our server who told us how to eat it. It's fun. Like a shot of mild spice. 

The other dish we had was the dessert which came with the Ashoka's feast. It was made of dried carrot and nuts. Now, I have this weird thing against cooked carrots. They make me gag, but I love raw carrot. It's strange. So anyhow, I was not aware of what this dish, Gajar Halva, was made out of. I asked the waiter. It tasted nothing like carrot. It has this amazing texture and sweetness. I highly recommend it. Like most extra-American dishes, I find that you should eat it without knowing what it is. I think many Americans have preconceived notions of what things should taste like and their texture so knowing what you're eating is more apt to gross you out than allow you to experience it. 

Oh yea, while the food was excellent here and the service, the Ashoka's feast is not really enough food for two people. We ordered the pani puri as an appetizer with this in mind and even though I wasn't starving, it was barely enough food. It was all very tasty, but I wish we had ordered a bit more food (especially now as I write this really wishing I was in Vegas eating some Tamba).

First impression is its super costly for what it offers. $20 for buffet with very few options compare to Bay areas buffets. Compare to bay are this is kind of $10 to $11... So it's costly.

Tamba serves meat in Vegetarian Dishes and does not even care to apologize.

Myself and four friends visited Tamba for lunch buffet on Jan 18, 2015. While having our buffet lunch, I realized there were ""chicken pieces"" in ""Sambar"". I thought it was just my bowl of Sambar , NOPE all my four friends also found chicken pieces in their Sambar bowls. (Sambar is a South Indian dish made with lentils and vegetables)

Please see the pictures attached as proof. (go to photo gallery of this restaurant in yelp in case you do not see it along with my review post)

I was SHOCKED and called the waiter to show our Sambar bowls with chicken, he neither was apologetic and said he would check and get back.

As I did not see the waiter come back for a while, I walked to the elderly person I believe he was the owner of the restaurant and explained him the issue with chicken pieces in Sambar. 

To my utter dismay, instead of being apologetic he raised his voice and was acting shocked saying that he himself set up the Sambar dish in the buffet.

Being an Indian, with respect to elders (here the owner of the restaurant) I continued to be polite and informed him that it is a SERIOUS OFFENSE. One cannot serve a vegetarian dish with meat in it, if it does have meat they need to highlight in the description of the dish in buffet table.

He continued to raise his voice and was defending himself, whereas I was trying to be polite and making sure that this NEVER happens. I pity the vegetarian customers who ate their lunch with Sambar earlier in Tamba on same day.

This elderly person continued his arguments and in no ways was apologetic and instead was saying someone else would have done that. Whatever might be the reason one cannot serve meat in a pure vegetarian dish.

While he continued to defend himself in a high pitch voice, the customers around that time stopped by and were shocked to know about Sambar having chicken pieces in it.

Finally, the waiter intervened, took this hot headed elder person away and they removed the Sambar from the buffet menu.

Neither the Owner nor the waiter offered a sincere apology for their GRAVE mistake.

*** At the end, I would like to WARN all VEGETARIANS who visit Tamba restaurant to be careful when eating any dish they serve. ***

The best thing is that the saunf (fennel seeds) are not roasted. I usually avoid them at all the indian restaurants as they roast them and/or coat them with stuff. But here, they are just right.

I am in Vegas quite a bit for work and my coworkers and I are always searching for dinner options that don't require you to win big before you can eat.  Thanks to Open Table, we found this hidden little gem.

The feeling of the restaurant is pretty generic.  The website gives the impression that you will be walking into a luxurious setting complete with red velvet cushions and dramatic draperies.  Um, not so much, but we clearly weren't looking for trendy so no big deal.

We had booked a party of 6, which ended up being a party of four.  The host was nice about it, but, unfortunately the restaurant doesn't have too many options for 4-tops so we ended up sitting at a table for six.  I guess they get a lot of large groups?

I started with a manhattan.  When it came out a dark red, I was a little concerned that it wasn't made correctly, but after tasting, it was just right.  I had the butter chicken, which was rich and delicious, but not too heavy.  My friends didn't really know what they wanted so the server just brought out a few different dishes to share.  One of my friends had a spicy chicken dish that was fantastic.  In hindsight, I wish we would have asked what they were.

First I want to say the service and staff here were amazing.  My water glass never went less than half full.  Kudos! Our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get.  I would say he went above and beyond! 

To start off, we tried the Vegetable Samosa's and Vegetable Pakora's.  The Samosa's reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas.  Accompanied with the sauces, these were great! The Pakora's were good also but a little too much breading.  For the main course, we went with the Chicken Tikka Masala.  The tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! I scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased.   As for the chicken and rice dishes, there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldn't imagine eating this all myself. We even had much leftover! The garlic naan came out warm, flavorful and perfect.

Since this was my first time out as a Las Vegas resident, I was extremely pleased to discover that Las Vegas does indeed have stellar Indian cuisine. I read the first review carefully and already knew it was considered excellent by Indian natives.

But when I arrived and saw that virtually everyone in the restaurant was Indian, I knew it was going to be superb and it was. My perennial favorite, Lamb Vindaloo, was as spicy as it should be. The lamb was tender, although I've tasted superior lamb, namely in Paris.

As a starter I ordered Onion Kulcha. The waiter brought out the nan accompanied by a plate of tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and pickled vegetables. I knew then and there that I would be in for a treat.

The rice was excellent although I prefer mine laced with peas and authentic cardamom seeds, but for most food lovers this is probably adventurous enough. ;)

We had been wondering around the Hawian Marketplace and I was feeling so bad I was not sure what I was doing.  We went in the building which sadly is deserted on the first floor and one of the employees directed us upstairs.  He could see I was ill and got the manager who immediately got us a table.  Once I had been seated and started getting back to normal we ordered.  I had the butter chicken which was amazing and my BF had the curried Goat.  Our waiter was shocked he asked for the goat and had to make sure they still had some but came back smiling and letting us know it was still available.  He said it was fantastic.  Our waiter was attentive and kept a positive attitude even though and indian couple behind us ordered several things and kept sending them back unhappy he never lost patience with anyone.   It was a great meal and we would go back.  At the time one of the half price outlets had coupons to reduce the price.  We also ate here on Christmas day for the lunch buffet and while it was good none of the entrees were marked and even a few indian customers questioned what the dishes were.

Tamba offers perhaps the best Indian lunch buffet in town.  Unlike most Indian restaurants in Vegas, the cooks at Tamba don't focus on a bland tourist palate.  And as a result, they don't produce spice-less offerings.

What the buffet does offer is an amazing array of vegetarian options--tasty, spicy and delicious options--chana masala (chick pea masala), palak paneer and various other vegetable-based deliciousness.  But the buffet isn't solely for the vegetable lover.  The Tamba buffet also carries several chicken dishes in well-crafted sauces.  If you've eaten at a few Vegas Indian buffets, you'll know that tasty and spicy foods are rare.  So if you're near the south side of the strip for lunch, you can't do much better.

As for the dinner or regular dishes (not in buffet form), I haven't tried them, but several India-born friends have told me that Tamba is the best Indian restaurant in town.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,1,4,Sf9RnRDQMuJBQ70HGmCrzw

Food stinked really bad.
Me and my girlfriend were sitting in the waiting area for 10min to be seated then another couple came after we have already waited for 10min and the host got them seats and when I asked the host that what's going on his reply was(in a VERY rude tone): ""Wait outside i will be with you soon"". Then he finally called us in and there was no apology whatsoever but we were hungry so I was like never mind. He said we have a buffet going on and you can help yourself, so we did. Now when got to the buffet station something STINKED really bad, I didn't realize it was the food that was stinking, I thought it must be something they used in the mop or other but then we took the food back to our table and I ate one bite of the naan with alloo mattar and I figured right away what was stinking. I told my girlfriend to not eat the food because we don't want to get sick. I asked the same rude guy to get me our check because whatever they do, even if they are serving old food, I made the call to go to this restaurant because we got lured in by the decorations outside the business so I still want to pay them, regardless of how much it is. They guy asked me what happened I told him that the food stinks, I ate a bite and I know you're serving old food and you know that too but for now, just get me my check so that we can clear our dues and still not get sick. He said ohh in that case you leave the food and just go, I asked him are you sure? He said yes and I am sorry. We walked away, just because he didn't charge us and apologized for serving old food and acknowledging it I am giving 2 stars. If you consume old food, especially old Indian food which is mostly curry based it will make you sick in a giffy and that's not right. I even checked in while I was there and even took a photo.

The chicken tikka was so buttery and had a great flavor while the lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat.  We had samosas of course and they were pretty good.

I decided I needed to get out for Valentine's Day and chose to go Indian. I came across Tamba's amazing website and easily made up my mind. After making the reservation I read a few revues on Google and they worried me a bit, but I wasn't going to be shaken. I'm so glad I stayed with it, I loved this place. Staff was very friendly and the food was delicious! We tried the Bhel Puri for an appetizer, based off of the waiters recommendation, great choice. Then for entrees we went with the Aloo Gobi & Chana Masala. Both were amazing and complimented each other nicely, great for sharing. She went with a glass of house Chard, which turned out to be Mondavi(Nice!) and I tried one of the many Indian Imported beers. Hayward 5000 was the beer I went with and was perfect. Gotta find that at Lee's Discount Liquor, hope they have it.

The lamb roganjosh was prepared with a perfect blend of spices. The chicken masala also prepared just to taste. Everything was very flavorful and though try described it as spicey, nothing was too spicey.  This meal also included a donuthole dessert with a sweet caramel sauce.

The food was being served buffet style so I got to sample a good array of items. I have to say, the items were in Indian so I had no idea about a few items that I was eating but since I'm adventurous like that, I put a teeny bit of whatever I didn't know and then decided if I wanted seconds. Certain items were a tad spicy but not enough to ruin your meal if you're sensitive to heat. The Tandoori Chicken, which always tends to be dry, was super juicy, the Curry Chicken was fragrant and addicting. The Rice was soft and fluffy and they give u a basket of Naan for your table. I may have been the only Spanish person here, lol, everyone else was Indian, I love that, very telling AND promising. The price is right, $14 for a very clean, well maintained, hot meal.

Tampa has made some very nice and noticeable changes to its interior. Tamba could use some improvements to the exterior as well. It is deep set in an aging shopping center which prevents Tamba from completely standing out and getting noticed.
The quality of the food and the service was excellent. Service included knowledgeable servers who wasted no time in informing us of the daily specials and the top selling dishes of the restaurant.
We had the Pani Puri for an appetizer and it was delightfully flavorful. For dinner we had the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken. Both of these dishes were prepared to our taste buds' liking. The sauce on the Butter Chicken consisted of the right texture, color and flavor. The Chicken Tandoori lacked the artificial color (Thank You) which many Indian restaurants use to make it red however it tasted as chicken from a full flavored tandoor oven. It was tender and had the right combination of the herbs and spices.

Usually, it's associated with trying to make more from you off something else (once they get you in), or just offering you something at a discount because it was way overpriced to begin with.  Then there are those deals that are so low because it's crappy food (like many of the prime rib specials.) Well, Tamba doesn't fit into any of those categories, but they have a genuine deal: a $12.95 lunch buffet!

And it's not the type of buffet that you're accustomed to running away from.  There are a variety of reasons I stay away from buffets these days, but Indian buffets tend to be an exception. Quality food, and wait for it...fresh food. Shocker!  I had salad with mint chutney, potatoes, rice, marsala, chicken tandoori, and a few other things I can't all remember.  Most of the items contain a description above it, but when I was struggling, one of the employees noticed and gave me a suggestion in a kind matter.

3368737,2012-04-02,0,Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg,"It pains me to give 3 stars to this place when my first experience here only less than two months ago warranted about a 4-ish rating.  

My boyfriend and I came in here about an hour before closing and instead of being greeted with a ""Hello, how are you this evening?"" spiel, we were told right off the bat to order only one entree since the kitchen was closing soon.  I thought that was a bit harsh and strange as the dining area was a little more than half full already.  The kicker was a group of women that showed up about 15 minutes prior to closing and the same host was taking care and doting over them with open arms.  Guess you have to show some skin, cleavage, possibly more... to override the rules, eh?  

Service here on the whole part is excellent.  The food here is excellent and VERY fresh.  However, I highly do recommend not to order spicy as the last dish I ordered was heavily-overpowered with chili powder, but no taste.  Order medium, if you want a kick, but still can enjoy the flavors.  Portions are not big, but that is perfectly fine as they are definitely filling.  The garlic naan is good; samosas are forgettable and not worth it by any means; the korma is great; and I HIGHLY recommend the yellow/cumin rice as a side dish as it is superb. 

The other knock-off is that they automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill.  It's one thing if it was a group of people and I understand that, but for just two people?  At least have a sign at the front desk or something on the menu that says this is going to be enforced.  It has nothing to do with us being cheap tippers or anything as we both vary between 15% to 20% on tipping (dependent on food/service etc...)  I know the last time I went with my boyfriend and a close friend of our's, this did not occur.  Was it because we ""inconvenienced"" them by coming in an hour before closing since the tone of the voice and body language of the host made it obvious?  Bizarre to say the least and this definitely did not go over well with the bf one bit.  The redemption was later on when I won money on the slots at Paris to cover up the dinner cost.   

Pricey, yes, but what do you expect in Vegas?  $14 for channa masala (garbanzo beans in a sauce) is hilarious as you can go get a Trader Joe's frozen version of the same thing/taste for around $2 and change.  Expect to pay at least nearly $30 a person to give you a gauge of what to expect.  

Unfortunately, this last experience did not go over well at all, especially with my boyfriend.

3380328,2010-08-17,0,Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg,"I was trying to find a nice place to take my girlfriend for her birthday dinner.  First, we were looking for a Greek place, but didn't find any with decent reviews, so since we have had good luck with Indian food in the past, I figured I'd scour Yelp for suggestions.  I found Tamba to be in the top five on Yelp and found every place in the list to have mixed reviews.  After looking at the web sites of the top five, their menus and plenty of thought, I finally decided on Tamba.  I used opentable.com to make our reservation for 7pm Saturday night.  Since this place is in the Hawaiian Marketplace on the strip, I figured it would be packed.  In fact, one of the reviews said to make sure you get a reservation or your wait could exceed two hours.

When we arrived, the place was pretty empty.  I believe there were only four or five tables taken at that point, so we were greeted by the manager and he wished my girlfriend a happy birthday.  Nice touch.  

I am actually glad the place was empty because the waiter spent a lot of time talking over the menu options and giving us recommendations.  During our conversation with the waiter, we talked about the lamb dishes and he could tell we were hesitant, so he brought over sample for us to try.  It was so good, I chose the Roghan Gosht as my main dish.  My girlfriend chose the Butter Chicken and we started with the Sea Bass appetizer.  On the spice scale, I'd say the lamb was a 5 out of 10 and the butter chicken was a 3.

The wine selection was average, but my girlfriend really enjoyed the fruity martini.

The price was better than I expected for dinner on the strip in Las Vegas.  We both had two drinks, an appetizer, two main dishes, rice, garlic nan and two desert items and got out of there for around $70 and that included the tip.  

Two more signs that Tamba serves good Indian food; by the time we left (8:30ish), the place was packed and there were a lot of actual Indian people dinning there.

We both said that we would go back.",QySlTI-ppj-cCwm3J30rwA,0,0,4,_1GCxNcgZv33ysUVwmd56Q

Then, the place started filling up. Next reason: I was the sole Anglo there, everyone else seemed to be from the sub-continent or at least know their way around a tandoor. The long buffet had a variety of great dishes, veggie and carnivore. It could have been sliced up more for my taste, but that's why we hit the chutneys.
It's a little pricey since I don't wallow away from the trough overstuffed and miserable but I'll be back. Great place.

I had always been hesitant to try it because the curry smelled so strong and that line from Anchorman always made me cringe (""It smells like a baby's diaper full of Indian food"")....WAS I A RA-TARD!

My friends invited my man and I to a birthday gathering for a co-worker and were raving about this place. The owners have come to visit us at my work on several occasions so I thought I could at least go and see what it was all about. I knew it was going to be good because it was the only business left in the building (its located inside the Hawaiian Marketplace building by Polo Towers) and there were a ton of Indian people there (always a good sign).Alex was our server. He was very friendly and we left our dinner in his hands....what a smart decision. He brought out an AMAZING prix fixe menu I think of his own creation (nice touch). Now I will do my best to at least describe my favorites:

1) Little fried dough balls with peas and potatoes inside...served with a mint cilantro and some sort of sweet/spicy glaze (tandoori sauce?)
2) Chicken tandoori....great flavor. Sweet/spicy and BBQ'd to perfection
3) Lollipop lamb chops with some sort of glaze with a kick (great with the mint cilantro and sweet/spicy sauce mixed together).
4) Chicken Tikka Masala....HOLY COW! You must get this dish. The curry is mild, its creamy and a little bit of heaven in a dish. 
5) Garlic nan....garlic flat bread which was perfect for dipping in the Chicken Tikka Masala.

I was so happy when we left. My man and I actually went back the following evening because I was craving it again. Just as good the second time and we actually got Alex as our server again...he remembered us from the night before (another nice touch).

This place is a bit different since you have to pay upfront before going into the buffet. It is also easy to miss because it is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza. You have to go into the main building next to the Chili's and just ignore the rundown shops on the first floor as you ascend to the second level where this restaurant is located.  

They have a good selection of food like naan, butter chicken, basmati rice, tandoori chicken, and some other items. The naan is in the buffet so you can grab as much as you want when you want it! The only downer is that it is plain naan instead of garlic, but it still tastes fine since you can just eat it with the curry for flavor. 

I'd recommend checking this place out if you like Indian food and want a change of pace when it comes to eating on the strip. The lunch price with the Yelp discount was about $14-15/ person which isn't too bad considering the food and location. Also, I saw a bunch of Indian people when we walked in so that must mean this place is good!

We came here one Saturday evening for dinner and I fell in love with the setting. It's nothing like restaurants you see on the strip. It had a buffet, large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and an orange and gold scheme that made you feel like you were in India itself (or so I imagined).
Being with the crowd I was with, it was great because some of them were not too fond of extremely spicy food so we got a lot of mild dishes. You can just tell the staff to make it mild and they will do so. The vegetarian dishes were great. We started off with dishes like the Kurkari Bhindi- okra with brown onions and had chicken tikka for our entree.  The Naan had a great texture for scooping up all the sauce left over.

Medium spice was perfect for us- it had a good kick and wonderful flavor. We were relieved the lamb was cooked well, that's usually a toss up.

I was searching for a place to eat that would fit my newly discovered vegetarian diet and be acceptable for the rest of my lady friends for a night out.  

We walked in and were seated, immediately (of course there were only 8 other people in the restaurant).  The aroma of spices were all around and our appetites were ready to get down.  We were greeted by a gorgeous Morrocan man.  (Yay!  What a way to get the night started.)  And soon after a Philipino hottie joined in.  Two servers + four ladies = an exciting dining experience.

Hakim hooked us up with suggestions on food and drinks (that would be alcohol beverages).  What a delight!

Everything was good...except how distracted our 2 servers would get.  Something went wrong with the bill...for them.  I don't even remember the details.  I just remember having a great time.

I've been back several times now with my lady friends.  We always have a good time and good eats at this place.

If you like Indian food and you're looking for a place on the strip, this is it.  If you're looking for a place to hit up before a night out, this is it.  If you're looking for an Indian buffet, this is it.  (Yes, they do a lunch buffet and the price is low.)

We tried the cheese appetizer served with spicy mint sauce, tamarind sauce and crackers.  It was really good!  We had lamb korma, chicken tikka masala, eggplant, 2 types of naan, and basmati rice.  The sauces on the chicken and lamb were excellent but the meat was dry in both.  The eggplant was out of this world.  Everything had great flavor.  

I would definitely go back and I'm recommending it to all.

The flavors of all the curries were fantastic and deserving of 4-5 stars, the only problem is every curry was WAY TOO SALTY.  Not sure if this was intended being that it was a buffet and perhaps they want you to fill up on rice or nan.  Had they cut the salt in half, they would have gotten 5 stars from me.

Tip: don't forget to check in on Yelp for 10% off!

The friends I came to Vegas with all love Indian food, so we decided to grab an Indian meal for our last dinner in Vegas. The four of us arrived Sunday night around 7:30 pm and the restaurant was about half full, so we were able to get seated immediately. Most of the other patrons were Indian which seemed promising for the food.

The restaurant is in a super weird location on the second floor of what appeared to be a deserted mall with not much else inside. We were staying near the Cosmo and it was maybe a 10-15 minute walk from there, so at least it's pretty close to the heart of the strip.

We ordered a couple of things to share:

Samosa chaat ($8) - this dish is like a deconstructed samosa with some additional toppings served with yogurt and a sweet tamarind sauce. it was pretty good here

Butter chicken ($14) - I enjoyed the creamy sauce this was served in

Paneer tikka masala ($14) - I'm not a big fan of paneer (I think of it as Indian cheese) but I liked the tikka masala it came in, which honestly didn't taste that different from the curry sauce used for the butter chicken

Yellow dal ($13) - essentially lentil soup, this dish was my favorite out of the three since I love dal

We also ordered some rice, naan, and roti to eat with the curries as well.

Service was slightly on the slower side as we had trouble finding our server to flag him down, but we weren't in a rush so that was fine. Ended up paying around $20 pp.",epPsJevS8chv-tvxYDCSew,0,0,4,LKZkARyqPu3YhT09uzgQcg

The food was pretty good.  I couldn't believe that the entrees didn't come with Naan or anything.  Everything (Dal, Naan, etc.) had to be ordered a la carte (for an extra charge).  We ordered the Naan and Roti which only came with four pieces each.

4603762,2009-07-22,6,Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg,"Oh Yelpers, how you have failed me!  

My boyfriend and I found Tamba's advertisement in one of Vegas's books during our visit, and decided to go here for dinner after reading the ""good reviews"" and ratings on yelp.  After finally having eaten there,  I would give this place HALF a star if I could, for its bad food and terrible service!

I live in Silicon Valley---a mecca of Indian restaurants and cafes-- and eat Indian food at least once a week. (It's my latest addiction).  I know good curry when I taste it, and let me tell you now before you waste your time and money: you will not find good curry here.

We went for the ""dinner buffet"" which, it turns out, ""was reserved for private parties only."" So we ended up ordering the butter chicken and a lamb curry with some naan off of the menu.  But the waiter brought out what he called ""chicken tikka masala"", and when we told him it wasn't what we ordered, he then said he misspoke and it was actually ""butter chicken"" after all.

Either way, it tasted like water.  No flavor whatsoever.  The lamb curry on the other hand... was a SPOONFUL of SALT with every bite.  YUCK!

I've never abandoned an Indian meal in my life, no matter how mediocre.  But I could not get myself past even half this meal.  Maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier, or, ""Maybe,"" I thought, ""if i mix the two curries together, I would find a happy medium.""  How wrong I was! There was no happiness to be found there. :(

To top it off, when our bill came, we were charged $15 for the ""chicken tikka masala"" instead of butter chicken, and told our server about the mistake.  He said, ""It doesn't matter anyway, they're the same price.""  Indeed not!  I corrected him and said that the butter chicken is $14.  So he responded, ""Fine, I'll just COMP you the difference.""

""COMP""? ""COMP""??? Are you kidding me?!  You're not comping us anything!  We're just asking you to charge us for what we ACTUALLY ORDERED!  Don't think you're doing us any favors!

Finally, just to add insult to injury, they advertised 10% off the bill if you showed them the ad from the Vegas 24/7 booklet.  But when we gave him the ""coupon"", INSTEAD of taking 10% OFF, he ADDED 18% to our bill for gratuity!

Our plan was to find some grub at Aria but we either found stuff that was too expensive or not very appealing. By this time we were STARVING so I whip out my trusty iPhone and used my Yelp app to find this place just across the street. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace all the way in the back.

The first thing we did after we entered was pay the $15 for the weekend lunch buffet. I thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not. 

They had a lot of variety, at least 14 different items, and thought everything was just ok. One thing I thought was really good was their upma, it's like an Indian version of the Moroccan cous cous. It was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty. The chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry. The chicken tikka masala sauce was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken, I had to dig around for some. What I noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes. I've never seen that before and thought it's a good idea for those who don't like mixing their food. 

They were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates. Bad thing with this buffet was drinks weren't included so a separate bill was handed to us. Another downside was the food wasn't labeled properly, so I was just grabbing things blindly. 

Overall it was just an OK experience. At least Tamba introduced me to a new dish, now all I have to do is find it here in LA!",Ba_cWbzh2Wghm9runQ0WUQ,5,6,3,b5j2GCLvBq_hP4yOT6_vDg

It's hard when you want to try a bunch of different stuff when it's just you and the BF.  But Tamba offers a couple of 'feasts' to help satisfy that curiosity!

For $25, the BF got the Ashoka's Feast which comes with:

* Tandoori Chicken ""Spring chicken in a mildly spiced ginger yogurt sauce."" - It came with two drumsticks and two breasts, a decent amount to start his meal.  There were three dipping sauces - the mint one, a chutney of some sort, and a dark purplish one.  I'm not a particular big fan of tandoori, but the BF ate three pieces of it.

* Lamb Curry ""Cubes of lamb cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, red chilies, and pickling spices."" - It tasted a bit gamey for me, but we did enjoy dipping our nan bread into the sauce.

* Chicken Tikka Masala ""Chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay oven and then served in a mild curry sauce."" - The chicken was white meat, and pretty flavorless.  But the curry sauce was SO good!  I wish I had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with!  Next time I'll tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce!

* Kali Dal ""Slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices."" The BF thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito, as in skip the black beans, refried beans, or pinto, and add some black lentils instead.  Pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan bread too.

* Rice - A generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration.  Needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer.

* Nan ""White flour tandoori bread"" - A must when eating Indian food.  My preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries, especially those that come with tikka masalas! 

* Raita - Condiment based on yogurt used as a sauce or dip.  Served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes.  I'm not a big fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice 'cuz the BF was doing it.  I can pass on this.  

* Daily Dessert - Two small donut-like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey.  Oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty Indian dinner.

I ordered up the Buddha's Feast for $21 and this is what I got: 

* Vegetable Samosa ""Crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas."" - The order came with two samosas, and two dipping sauces.  The BF was pretty impressed by these, and I'm lucky that I had two to share!

* Malai Kofta ""Chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream sauce."" - It came with one chunk of cheese only, which I couldn't even tell was cheese! I thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something.  The sauce was okay, and good for dipping. 

* Saag Paneer ""Spinach with our special cottage cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices."" - It came with one piece of cottage cheese, and I think it lacked flavor.  The BF said it had been sitting out too long and this is one of his favorite Indian dishes.

* Kali Dal

* Rice

* Nan

* Raita

* Daily Dessert

The feasts are presented quite nicely on a large platter and it's a decent amount of food.  You definitely get the chance to taste a few different things without breaking the budget or ordering too much food.

The BF also ordered a Mango Lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his liking.  I thought it tasted fine, but was more watery than what I'm used to.

Service was good - our water glasses were filled without asking.  The only complaint was that our main courses came out too quickly after our appetizers.  We had to help the waiter move some dishes around while we were still eating and he was juggling the huge platters.

There's also a back room available for private parties with a more family style seating.

Sidenote: You can get a 50% off coupon/entree at the Tix4Less booth downstairs! Or a 10% coupon from their website.

I proceeded to the buffet section but most items were already out. Indian food has lots of variety and biryani is always included in most buffet if not lamb at least chicken. They had plain rice and other curries. The sweet selection were only 2 choices. You can add kheer, gulab jamun, and maybe carrot halwa?

I had never really been into Indian food before, but not trying it and having other places, this place is pretty good. The service is good if you're a bunch of girls...haha. There are a couple of waiters that the girls lust over, so they definitely pay attention to us when we come in. The service has been delayed in that regard, but only delayed with us getting the check. 

 I've been there for the buffet and I've ordered individual dishes. I love every dish I've had with chicken in it. I don't usually like curry to much, but I love the curry dishes here. I usually get 7-10 on the spice level as well. There are also a lamb dish that is amazing, which is best spicy. I think most things are best spicy.

5133108,2015-05-01,0,Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg,"As an Indian (from Fiji) who eats Indian food daily, I think I can bring to light that this place is not average. It is slightly below average. For one, the prices are ridiculous. I understand this is Vegas, but who doesn't include naan or rice with their entrées? This was definitely a first for me. 

I was asked if I wanted my food mild or spicy, but my wife wasn't. When she got her meal (Yellow Dal) it was very spicy and not to her liking. She barely ate any of her food. She didn't return the food either because she was already so unsatisfied with the service she didn't feel the need to wait again. I'll give them credit for my Butter Chicken meal for being slightly above average and the spice (heat) level to be of my liking. 

Decor is nice, except for the random book shelf wall diving the kitchen from the dining. Atmosphere is above average.

Service was bad, to put it simply. Our actual waiter only came to the table when we got there, when we ordered, and when we got the check. Other waiters helped us in between. Also, our waiter waited over 15 minutes to bring us our check. He was wandering around and had clearly seen us just sitting there waiting. I'm not a bad customer or just rude, but I couldn't stop thinking about just walking out if this place and not give them any of my hard-earned money. 

Overall, I won't ever be coming back here. I'll wait to go back home and get my Indian food instead of wasting time and money here. I'm giving it two stars simply because this place gave me a chance to eat something that reminded me of home.",HgCupDRGjSMtKSHXCZjTRw,0,0,2,XMN1fKb1wWvIU09hW87s-A

I've been to this place multiple number of times every time I visit Vegas. This place is located on the strip in the same complex as Chili's. Finding this place could be very challenging since there are no proper direction boards when we look from the strip. You need to step inside the plaza and keep walking to the escalators to reach here. Parking is charged which can be waived of if we show the Bill. The outside of this place looks very dull and no proper lights. 

As we reached this place we were greeted by a staff named ""Kumar"" whom I've seen for about 3 or 4 years at place now. The inside of the restaurant needs some more lights. The menu is quite good. We ordered for Samosa chat, Ashoka, Chicken kabab, Chicken Curry and a Lamb side and some Lime juice. They did not make us wait for the food for long. I must say that every single item tasted really good. The meat was perfectly cooked and well served. 

Even the lime juice was really good that we ordered for more. The Price of the dishes were a little on the higher side but we got a 10% discount for our Yelp check-in. Thank you Yelp :)

Veggie Samosas (about 5 or 6 pieces) http://su.pr/2wAdc9

The internet can be so deceiving. 
First of all, the chic dining area they prominently display on their website, which is (and I quote), ""designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist Farhad Elahi"" is their reserved banquet dining room, tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant. Regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space, complete with standard tables and chairs. I suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner, but it was V-Day and I wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit! Exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation. Being adventurous- not to mention gluttonous- we pretty much ordered one of everything. The mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water, while the other Pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat. The service sucked, especially considering it was V-Day. This place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley (Gandhi's and Gaylord's), in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre North Indian/Pakistani spot and more of a, and I quote, ""hipster hangout.""

Service: attentive and friendly

In Vegas for a convention, and not really that happy with the bazillions of ""hotel"" restaurant choices (while recognizing that many of them are exceptionally good) and wanting something vegetarian, I looked these guys up and was impressed by their website.

I went alone, as the rest of my compadres were busy at the blackjack tables, or somewhere else doing more ""Vegasy"" things, and the hostess sat me immediately, gave me a menu, and made sure I received my H20.  

The waiter came, discussed the wine and beer list and suggested a beer-- the name I forget, but it was great.

I ordered the Navrattan Korma, and sort of expected your typical Indian Navrattan Korma, but was pleasantly surprised to receive it with a nice kick-- seriously spiced right!  VERY tasty.   When he first put down the dish I figured I'd eat about half of it, but I polished it off and would have continued eating if there had been more... I've been to Vegas a few times, and have never been all that happy with the food, so it was a real treat to go somewhere this good.

Don't bother ordering off the menu and you won't be complaining about bad service or long wait times for your food. Here's why Tamba has the best Indian buffet in town:

1. Huge selection with plenty of veggie options. I don't  think there's a bigger Indian buffet in Vegas.
2. Buffet is not set up against a wall so you can go down the row on both sides. No waiting!
3. Great naan and great rice. These are key.
4. All you can eat gulab jamin dessert. So good.
5. Friendly staff. We've been going for years and the owners, staff etc have always been extremely cordial to us.
6. 30 bucks for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hard to beat that.
7. Great recipes of standard dishes that should satisfy most everyone.
8. The place has Indian folks arriving in big numbers. There is no way an entire Indian family would go there and bring their non-English speaking, sari-adorned grandma, who happily eats with her hands, if this wasn't the real deal.

Although the 'katories' or styrofoam bowls I took the curries in were flimsy, they helped me taste everything separately and not have everything mixed in my plate. I liked that.

The waiter took forever to take our order.  I ordered the Meat Thali.  The food was bland and not tasty.  It was better than Gandhi Indian restaurant for sure, but still sucked.  We came here specifically because another yelp review said that the naan melted in your mouth.  I call BS.  No way.  The prices were expensive 15-18 dollars a plate. 

They gave us onions and indian pickle without asking which was nice.

Anyway Bottom line is that I will keep looking for that elusive good indian restaurant in Las Vegas",M0yU5oNTKDPo51AlSDKNMA,0,0,1,nvaRfgxqL00jutnKxD0NKw

When you ask  how many items in the buffet , the answer is ""Lots of items"" with a eye on the credit card.  You don't even know what you are paying for. The food tastes like its been cooked a long time before.

Not a good selection of the buffet menu.",6xImJ45vqZl3vvvkChE-Ug,0,0,1,80mGAzOM-6XikfP6T0tdDQ

Luckily nothing happened to him , but we literally had to run and gave him medicines before anyrging happen to him. Owner even though understood our language, never came to our table once. 25% discount doesn't solve the problem. 
(Ideally, they should have made whole order free, but   I am not going to argue for that). 

Also, they add lots of food color especially in paneer curry . Please be aware of that..!! My wife also had allergies due to that afterwards :( :(.

Giving 1 star because service wasn't too bad. Servers and Manager was not as good as thry should have been in mistake they made, but that s fine.

I dont know , if they take this seriously or not, but from now onwards, anytime I am in Vegas, this restaurant will be my last option..!!",U8GVO6x9BKI_Hj9o8OHl2g,0,0,1,Tnae88O9mL-tkXmrd5E30A
5990794,2012-06-14,1,Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg,"Legit spot for hangover brunch. If you can wake up early enough for it. I'm very critical of Indian restaurants but this lunch buffet hits the spot like a triple chilled, quintuple distilled, boutique vodka. Service is hit or miss but the food makes up for it. If you're jonesing for different edible fare in Vegas in between the $80 buffets and the Subway in that crappy casino on the Strip, this is a solid choice to soak up your alcohol indiscretions. If you shoot fire out of your bunghole the next day, it might be Tamba. Then again, it might be the result of table service at Marquee. Who knows?",xYS0_k9dYw1ikghQetkL-w,2,1,4,NSUyP1-blu_khSt7FGI5Rw
5993081,2016-07-08,0,Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg,Seriously loved this place! The owner is so nice and kind and so was our waiter! Although we were about 1 hour late for our reservation they still held a table for us! The food was amazing. I really recommend eating here. The butter chicken and lamb biryani is too die for.,-FAUTkaAa5s4mN5sVel1yA,0,0,5,31KDJAHM2MAkcE24LpeZTA
