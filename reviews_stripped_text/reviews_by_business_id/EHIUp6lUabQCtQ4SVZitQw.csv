The Ramen noodles were kind of soggy but we did get our food delivered which took about 45 minutes to an hour.

When I told the employee that it was taking too long and he had said 30-40min he said ""yea i know has it been that long yet"" i said yes it has its been about an hour! No apology Nothing!

now I did come here at 10:30 on a Thursday night...so which was great because we had fast service.

They also have some different choices that Yama doesn't offer.

Now I ordered a bunch of the specialty rolls which were all delicious especially the baked scallops...what I really liked was the purple rice, doesn't taste any different to me but made a big difference in presentation of the food. I highly recommend u give this place a try.

I would rank this place in the top sushi spots in Vegas for sure.

Found this through yelp and ordered 35$ of food. My girlfriend said she really enjoyed it however it tasted slightly off. For the next couple of hours she became incredibly sick to her stomach and proceeded to throw up multiple times that day. While I can't say it with absolute certainty, I am almost positive that the sushi we received was bad in some way or another. It was the only thing that my girlfriend had eaten that day since she never eats breakfast and became too sick for dinner afterwards. When I called them later that night after I had gotten off work they seemed very flustered and unsympathetic. Additionally, no manager was present.

1230038,2015-12-20,1,EHIUp6lUabQCtQ4SVZitQw,"At the time of this review, the overall rating of this place was 4 stars, which is why my husband & I decided to eat here for dinner. But don't let that fool you because this restaurant bribes patrons to write a good review for a free roll (more below).

We walked in around 7:30 pm this past Thursday night. It was pretty empty with only 2 tables. We were seated at a booth & given menus. After browsing through the menus (make sure to also check out the meal specials that are in a display sign on the table), we ended up ordering:

Happy Hour Skewer Special, 3 for $5 (Happy Hour: Monday- Saturday, 7- 10 pm)
Chicken Skewer- Ordered 2 of these. I was actually surprised with the amount of chicken I got for each skewer. The chicken had a good grilled taste. Because I had already filled up on the other food we ordered, I only had 1 of them & took the 2nd one to go.

Spicy Pork Skewer- Ordered 1 of these. My husband ate this & thought it was good. 

Las Vegas Roll, $8 prior to tax (on Happy Hour Menu)- This roll was made with purple rice, which is a nice change from white. I liked the crunchy fried garlic on top of this & thought this was good. I was surprised with the amount of pieces this came with. This cut roll was pretty filling. I liked the sauces on this roll.

Shaggy Dawg Roll, $9 prior to tax (Happy Hour Menu)- This roll is also made with purple rice. Imitation crab is cut & draped over the rice that looked like a dog with long, shaggy hair (thus the name I suppose). Just like the Las Vegas roll, there was also a number of pieces that came in this cut roll. It was also filling. Although I did like the sauce on this roll, there is sirarracha sauce on top in case you don't do spicy like me (yes it was spicy for me so I stopped eating it).

LS12: Yellow Tail Roll with Ramen, $10 prior to tax- Originally my husband ordered a udon entrée, but changed it to this entrée after I saw the meal special menu on the table (which was pushed to the very back of the table, against the wall). You can order this meal special with udon instead if you do not want ramen. Anyways, this meal special also comes with a bowl of miso soup & a salad, which is quite a lot of food for $10. 

The yellow tail roll comes with 8 pieces & also made with purple rice. But it was not rolled tightly and started to break down. I thought this roll was good. 

The ramen was spicy (although the menu did not specify that it would be) and tasted like your typical ramen that you could get at the store and cook at home. But for $10, we weren't surprised by that.

 For the salad, when I asked the server about that, she told us that it is self serve (there is a small salad bar at the bar). I wished the server who took our order (another server) would have told us this before hand. So my husband got up & plated a salad & gave it to me (I am such a salad fan). I was happy to see that they had the dark green leafys, but some of it was a little soggy & wished it was a little more fresh. 
---------------------
(Total= $34.57, after tax, prior to tip)

Originally I was charged incorrectly & had to ask a server to fix it (our original server left for the evening). She fixed the error & said the other server had rung us up wrong.

Service was lacking. I also did not like that when we gave our server our order in the beginning that she saying 'what else' after each item. I thought that was kind of odd because we ordered quite a lot of items for just the 2 of us. Another thing that really bothered me was our server had brought over 1 of those small condiment dishes that has 1 compartment for ginger & the other for wasabi, the ginger was so measly & skimpy. The wasabi was just a few small little pieces instead of a larger amount. Not that I eat wasabi, but my husband & I thought it was odd to be given such an incredibly skimpy amount. Also what bothered & annoyed me was that with 2 people sitting at this table, she did not bother to bring us 2 of these condiment dishes. So when my husband asked for another 1, she asked 'for the sauce?' My husband said yes & so she brought me a large bowl instead. Why would I need a large bowl to dip my sushi in? Especially when she acknowledged that we need it for the sushi. This sever is either new or just wasn't thinking about what she was doing on this shift. 

Although the food is good (and some of it being average), the server was much to be desired. I honestly would NEVER come back here. 

By the way, about all of those 5 star reviews, there is a small sign on each table ""To our valued customers, if you are happy with our food and service, you will get a free menu item"", which you can choose from California roll, cucumber maki, salmon skin, spicy tuna Philadelphia, vegetable maki. In order to receive your free item, the review must be posted and shown to an employee (limit 2/ table). Being that this place is close to UNLV, this targets poor, hungry college students who would take advantage of this deal.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,1,0,2,ypUPZwqFwhZhyDtgCmVrnw

After about 15 min they brought out two rolls for my boyfriend, we assumed they were the two that he ordered however he brought a third roll and found that they had originally given us the wrong roll, they gave us a yellowtail instead of caterpillar. Another 15 min goes by and other customers are getting all their rolls and soups, mind u I ordered just one roll and one soup and I got nothing. On top of that my boyfriend had ordered the oyster as part of his appetizer and they came out an hour after we arrived and they gave it to him last, the waiter seemed very new and didn't know how to answer one question without asking someone else. They seemed to have only one cook as the service was the worst and slowest I have ever experienced in my life. We were visiting from Orange County, ca and we will never come back here. And on top of that, the food was mediocre and they didn't provide any hot sauce salt and never checked on us to see if we were okay. Never again.",AxOM3pvCiaPZgbfBfEPw8A,0,0,2,GWl3JDvGejq9MV5QCrrYxw

When I first walked in, it resembled that of a typical Korean restaurant. You look over to the sushi chefs and they're both Korean, and they're playing Korean music videos on the TV screens haha 

The menu looked pretty good. They have an all day lunch special basically from open to close and its either 8-10-12 dollars depending on what you would like to get. The portions are huge too. I wanted to get a sushi roll as well but my friend advised me against it.. Good thing she did because I couldn't even finish my special! It comes with whatever dish you order, obviously, a ramen or using which is pretty big, and a miso soup. There is also  salad already on the plate. So yeah, the servings are pretty friendly too. 

I got the katsu whish was really good. It wasn't sooo fried to the point where all the meat has disappeared. They also didn't smother the sauce all over the katsu which I really liked - it was just enough. My friend got the salmon and it was also very delicious.

The udon soup was fine. Ediable. Good broth. The noodles were good. Shrimp tempura tasted fine, but was soggy. Tons and tons of broccoli. Kind of offputting. The gyzoa was mushy on the inside in a way I've never experienced before. Still tasted okay. The yellowtail sashami was actually pretty good. Thick, fresh tasting. The mango roll I got was gross.

The first time I came, I was one of two people out of a party of 5 that actually ate. The other members just ordered drinks. During this stay, we had a meeting the lasted way too long and the staff did not mind that we loitered. I know they want to keep their customers happy and I like how they allowed non-eating members to join us at the table.


The second time I came, everyone in my party was hungry. We were seated at a table that was a little too squished on the left hand corner of the business. The service was well and the food was pretty good. My husband and I both bought a sushi roll combo (the Vegas and Burrito roll). This was not as great as other sushi restaurants we have ordered from because the rolls felt a little heavy, but it was definitely on par with fast food sushi joints like Jaburritos.

Alright, here is the kicker that dropped it down from 4 stars. My friend actually killed a baby roach that was crawling on the wall near our table. We don't want to say that this play is infested with roaches, but I am a bit disturbed by it. After that happened my husband couldn't even eat any more of the food. We didn't box it up and I am not honestly sure if we will come back.

I suppose I could have mentioned it to the staff, but we didn't want to cause a seen over a potential anomaly roach. There are just way to many places to go to than to put up with bugs or even wonder about them.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,3,1,3,QAJ_6m8NpPeGhA6hNaUNPw

We were already eating and at that point we could not eat anymore, being that we always pay regardless of any circumstances, we asked for the check and paid.

The price for AYCE isn't bad; it's cheaper than other sushi places around the area. It's probably a good marketing strategy because it's right across from UNLV and I feel like most of the clientele are college students. 

I liked the sushi rolls, but I've honestly had better. The rolls were made with purple rice, which is a unique twist to sushi because I've never seen that done before. The rolls that I enjoyed here were the Las Vegas and the Spider rolls.

There were other rolls that weren't as good like the Hawaii roll, which is a basic California roll topped with tuna. I know, I know... some people don't classify a California roll as sushi, but I didn't want to get anything too crazy. When this roll came out, I noticed the tuna on top was darker in color than normal. The discoloration made me feel that the fish used in the roll wasn't fresh. Total appetite killer.

I think the little side orders of food (listed under the ""Starter"" section of the AYCE menu) were better than the rolls, in my opinion. Definitely try the baked scallop and the baked green mussel. The baked scallop had a creamy, soft texture. It's rich in flavor and can fill you up easily. The baked mussels were probably the best baked mussels I've had in a while! They're packed with flavor and they practically melted in my mouth.

I think this place is average. If you're balling on a budget and are craving AYCE sushi, then this is your spot. Some of the rolls were a hit or miss, but overall Oodolee is just okay.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,11,11,3,2MoaV0dy2tOUtEnm1x1GWg

Fresh salad bar. That's a plus, especially with fresh greens, seaweed salad, and fruits.  

Spider Roll: it's made of soft shell crab. Also has avocado, eel sauce, sprouts. A little too much eel sauce but still one of the better spider rolls I've had.

Salmon teriyaki: the simplicity and cleanliness of the food presentation was really appealing. I really like how the salmon was cooked. Skin was crispy and so good to eat. Devoured it in minutes.

Hamachi Kama: grilled fish collar.  Amazingly good. No sauce needed. Definitely would order again. I'm a fan now. 

Tonkotsu plate: Nice and crispy with an interesting sauce. However, the fried katsu gets a bit rich after a while.

Ramen: super hot and spicy. I added the shredded cabbage that came with my salmon plate and it tasted better. 
If you like spicy, this is for you. 

Udon: kind of standard, but nice with vegetables and an added shrimp tempura.

Service is superb. Our server is really nice and cute. 
Very reasonable price, considering the sizeable portions.
Happy hour Mon to Sat 7PM to 11PM.

Boy was I wrong.  I have no idea what the hell happened from a month ago where I first went versus today.

I had TERRIBLE service.  I was extremely baffled.  It started out horrible right from the beginning.  
Our waiter brought over the water, but didn't bring any straws.  I asked for a straw right when he brought the water.  Do you know when I received from straw?  Five minutes later.  

It just went down hill from there.  Half of the things we ordered didn't even get to the table, but it was definitely listed on the check.

My brother ordered a tempura udon and waited almost forty minutes for it to come out.  Once it was out, the waiter dropped the spoon in the soup and picked it out with his hand.  Another waiter then brought it over to my brother.  I told my brother not to eat it because of what I saw.  I then had it taken back.

Our water glasses were pretty much empty the entire time we were there.  I had to scream across the restaurant to get attention from one of the water to have my water glass filled.  They were pretty much messing around and having conversations with each other instead of doing their jobs.  THEY LITERALLY STARED AT MY WATER CUP CONTINUOUSLY AND TOTALLY DISREGARDED THE FACT THAT IT WAS EMPTY. 

You know what the funny part is?  There were a few people that came in thirty minutes after we got there, yelling about writing a yelp review for a free dessert.  And guess what the wait staff did?  Yes, they ended up spending most of their time making sure that they got their food in a timely matter and that their water glasses was filled.

Ridiculous.  

NEVER going back ever again.  HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE STAFF.  NEVER AGAIN.

I didn't tip, nor do I feel bad about it.  I was so distraught about the entire situation, I wanted to go to the kitchen and get my own food and go to the POS to pay my own bill.

I got three rolls in the $24 all you can eat(cheaper to do that vs buying the rolls separately):
First was the Kamikaze. It had a good helping of fish and a nice chunk of jalapeño. I generally don't like tempura rolls but this one had a really light tempura and wasn't over breaded. 
Second was the Red devil. Sooooo good. I like that they weren't afraid to pile on the sriracha. 
Third, was my favorite. The Ninja. The albacore melts in your mouth and all the flavors worked well together. The garlic chip on top felt weird on my teeth but was a good addition to the roll.

5151283,2016-02-02,4,EHIUp6lUabQCtQ4SVZitQw,"We wanted some sushi that delivered to our hotel. This location had a bunch of reviews and good star rating so we figured there was no way we wouldn't enjoy the food. We were wrong. The only positive thing was the delivery man. He was courteous and on time. The food was not what we had hoped. They were over soaked in sauces and the ingredients didn't taste fresh. Even the simple ones like spicy tuna and Philadelphia roll were off and those are hard to mess up. I stopped eating less than half way thru because it was just that bad. I threw up a little of it this morning too. Yuck. 

I figured the calamari would at least be decent. They were in sticks and tasted like fish sticks. Very disappointing. The restaurant did provide ample ginger, wasabi, soy and chopsticks. Because of their delivery man and the well packed order, they get two stars instead of one, otherwise it was a no Bueno experience. My husband felt the same. 

Also, they charge $6 for delivery.",cnohx8UN5XyC7Evg2zX-3w,12,8,2,PI1nXT8wtzyKz1ChY6kzgg

5871270,2015-03-02,4,EHIUp6lUabQCtQ4SVZitQw,"Needed a last minute sushi restaurant with an AYCE and short wait. This had four stars so we took a chance.

There was no wait. We were the only ones there. We were seated and served by a very reserved, soft spoken, seemingly very shy boy who didn't know anything about the menu or its items.

All sushi places we've been to (many) minimize the portion sizes when doing AYCE sushi versus ordering ala carte, so we (wrongfully) assumed this was the case. I ordered a fried jalapeño, which is usually 2 jalapeños/ 4 halves at most. They gave me 10 halves. A full sized appetizer. Since we like ordering large amounts at one time, it was too late once we realized they don't hold back on portions.

ALL of the tempura (shrimp, calamari) comes with tempura vegetables whether you like it or not. The shrimp tempura was fine but the coating seemed damp? I didn't personally have the calamari but my friend hated it. It was overcooked and very rubbery.

The rolls are huge and don't come in half sizes. We were told they'd be 8 pieces but I think I counted at least 12.

Key note is that the rice is purple. They apparently use black rice and white rice and the result is that it dyes all of it purple. While it is very off putting at first, we couldn't taste a difference.

Dumb Notes: I hated their chopsticks. Seemed very cheap as they had splinters, and I couldn't grip them well enough to eat with. They provide a thing with ginger on one side and wasabi on the other but nothing for soy sauce. I know most people mix their soy sauce with wasabi, but I am not that kind of person. When we asked for Coke, he said okay and gave us Pepsi.

Would we go here again? Probably not.",OCz9lJa59X2YXkQy9u2-0Q,2,1,3,wxkJwXY_eCOzFzngBeAHvQ

But as far as sushi meals for cheap this is a great place to snag something quick. They have a specials menu that I suggest buying from. There's an $8, $10, and $12 option. All of which come with miso soup and salad. They actually have a salad bar so you can choose what type of lettuce and dressing your like. It's also got different sides like cucumber and shredded cabbage. (I love the cucumber with vinegar!!!!!) My meal was $10 for some yellowtail sushi, ramen (spicy but no flavor, but the egg was bomb), and ayce salad and cucumber. I liked it for the price. Wouldn't come here unless I was in the area and actually craving some quick Asian food.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,3,3,3,wuGPlxovyKHSg27a7nBDwg
