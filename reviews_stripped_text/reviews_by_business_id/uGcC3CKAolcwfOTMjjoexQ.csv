The staff was friendly but the cleaning the tables part was very poor. It took a while for them to bus the tables when people wanted to sit down. 

Now getting down to the burgers, so far I tried the mushroom Swiss burger with extra mushrooms because I love mushrooms. It was really good but very greasy. I also ordered the smashfries as a side, ehh it was okay it's topped with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic salt. But man was there way to much olive oil! The other burger I tried was the Sin City SmashBurger which has bacon, fried egg, cheese, onions (I don't like raw onions so I took that out), haystack onions, and egg bun. It was good but oily! 

The prices of the burgers range from $4.99 to $6.99 and the sides range from $1.49 and $3 something.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,0,3,EgSWu0ve0aVuQQBZ10hVrA

The staff was very friendly and helpful and gave me the 10% off Yelp discount even though I was having trouble with the app and could not pull up the actual coupon.

The wait to get our food was fairly short but still the manager gave my daughter some Oreo cookie to eat and chatted with us about babies and such. 

I felt that the prices were very reasonable, my order of 2 Sin City burgers, one club burger, one plain burger, 2 Smash fries, 1 veggie fries, and 1 PB&J shake came to under $35 dollars.

The food was great. The burger was juicy, without being overly greasy. The chili cheese fries were tasty and came with jalape√±o and diced onions. It's much better than eating at a normal fast food place where the fries are skinny and the chili and cheese aren't of the highest quality. You're not going to get five star restaurant quality, but it's a step up from normal chili cheese fries. The haystack onions were crispy and came with some sort of spicy mayo. The sauce was great and a good match for the onions.

After perusing the menu, I decided that the Sin City Smash and some sweet potatoes fries sounded very appealing.  I order, they give me my number and I sit and wait.

Finally, the food had arrived.  Mind you the wait wasn't that bad, 5 minutes maybe, decent time, nothing to mark down on.  I take my bite, and I'm overwhelmed by the onions.  There were 2 types of onions in the burger that it pretty much took over.  I could taste the burger and the egg, but it was well masked by the onions.  The burger was well cooked and very good, and the egg was nice, though a little overcooked.  Altogether an good burger.  The sweet potatoes fries were tossed in olive oil and rosemary (and I think garlic, not sure on that one).  It was very offsetting for the sweet potato fries, though I'm sure it would taste better as the normal SmashFries instead.

All in all, I was kinda let down after all the hype I had been hearing.  I'll probably be back, as it is a better burger than 99% of fast food, but as of now, probably not too often.",0rsH7td3l2l2vzRePNIXCw,3,2,3,TnX6fLoJqewxLN7K0h1dIg

511213,2015-01-26,1,uGcC3CKAolcwfOTMjjoexQ,"Not going to lie, but every since I became a vegetarian a year ago the appeal of smashburger has unfortunately waned. When I have an inkling to stop by, I have to get the bean burger or a salad. I refuse to get salads at any restaurant, so I go for the bean burger.  The burger itself is... Ummm... Well, it sucks. It is very dry and unappealing so I have to dress it up through the build your own menu. I regrettably have to say that I will not be frequent to smashburger anymore and this makes me sad. I just don't live the meat eaters lifestyle anymore =(

The staff at this location are ALWAYS sweet and accommodating! Customer service is 5 stars on its own. They are almost too sweet. I get a little suspicious sometimes, because it's rare to get such pleasant service the moment you step inside to the time you leave. 

I will miss them but after tonight's dinner I realized the bean burger isn't going to cut it for me to continue being a customer. The smash fries are not what they used to be either. Too much oil and over-frying of the fries.

But to you meat-eaters, this location in particular is the best! Its clean, inviting, and customer service is 5 star! Smash fries are usually good, but I've had a couple disappointing batches. I still think the food is good enough (if you're not a vegetarian) to warrant a visit to this location, so definitely stop by!

As for me it. I have to say good bye my sweet smashburger! I'll miss you very much, but I can't eat one more bean burger. It's just not good without a crap ton of dressing and condiments, which only then makes it edible. Try introducing the garden burger instead or maybe a different spin on the beans so they aren't so dry and tasteless.",ka8Pk_MXUXNmPy9kPaO43w,1,0,4,7ViAt4p-9x-RWh_a4KXoIw

Not sure why I was so excited when the Counter in CA also provides this custom item on their burgers. Very well cooked, and all the ingredients went well together. Onion strings, bacon, and a fried egg, really good. Also, I got one order of the smash fries and they were great. It wasn't super oily and it was well seasoned.

We ordered
1.  Truffle Mushroom and Swiss with smash fries and a drink.
2 Classic Smash with no cheese with regular fries and a drink.
3. Big Spicy Baja with large smash fries and a drink.

It was rang in as three classic smash burgers with regular fries. Luckily he read it back so we were able to void some things to get the order right or so I thought. Guess what.... overcharged. 

While I was looking at my receipt I tried to get unsweetened tea. Well, they were out, leaving me a choice of sweetened teas as soda. I don't drink soda or sweetened tea so I asked them to make more unsweetened tea.

The guy at the register was annoyed when I brought my receipt up to get a refund for the overcharge.

While waiting for the refund, the front person decided it was as more important to clean counters and tables then make the tea I asked for. So I asked for a refund for my drink also.

Now on to when the food arrives and guess what? Wrong fries on my daughters order and I got a small Baja not a big one. Same guy delivers the food and when I point out the mistakes he asked what I wanted, I replied the manager. Now for the big reveal!!!! He is the manager. I told him it was ridiculous and to bring out the correct food. And the topper you ask? I had to ask the girl cleaning the tables earlier to get my daughters smash fries. The ""manager"" hid in the back.

The jalapenos slices burst like flavor crystals in your mouth. The veggies were crisp and cold. The bun was perfectly toasted yet soft and tasty. The Smash Fries were crispy and so damn flavorful it would make you wish it was Red Robin were you get ALL YOU CAN EAT!!. The wife ordered the Smash Chicken Sandwich. Perfectly seasoned smash seared piece of chicken heaven. Topped with tomatos, onions lettuce and pickles and light mayo. The toasted wheat bun was great.

I have to say that while it's close I give a slight edge to Smash. Sure the burgers are smaller, sure you don't get an extra 5 lbs of fries shoveled into your bag, sure you can't eat salted in the shell peanuts and throw the shells at the staff (your supposed to do that right?) - but damnit they have milkshakes and sweet potato fries and that is what it takes to win.

Let's start with the burger- the only option for any self respecting Vegasite is the Sin City. There is no other burger like it in the counter- certainly not any of the exact same burger with a different city- specific name in every other town with a SmashBurger- this thing is unique to Vegas. Bacon, fried egg, onion strings- the most delicious threesome since that time I met your mom and sister. Its a tad hard to eat without it falling apart- but the poor structural integrity just means you have to shovel it into your pie hole faster before it collapses mysteriously like tower 7. 

The Shakes- I enjoy Haagen Daz ice cream regularly while wearing a smoking jacket in my study, sitting in my rich leather recliner having my feet massaged by a faceless servant- and with Smashburger I can replicate that somewhat out in the world amongst the unwashed masses. The ice cream is really rich which improves the flavor of shakes like Oreo but doesn't match well with shakes like Butterfinger so plan accordingly. 

The fries- Sweet potato Smash fries are the move- and make sure they come loaded with lots ofherbs and dripping with oil- otherwise reject them like a deformed Spartan Baby.

But when I see three people in the back all scratching their heads and making grimace faces attempting to get my order...that's unexcusable.

I will post a picture of the pathetic excuse they called onion rings. Not only didn't it fill the measly little paper cup, it was a salt bomb of cold, lumpish onions, I think. Mind you, we got this home before  we inspected the contents, other wise we would have said something on the spot. Something like, 'no friggin' way are those edible', or 'are those actually made of onions.' And the burger was over-cooked and rubbery/chewy in an ice-cold-get-it down-if-you-can way. And this was a new burger they were promoting, so it was less expensive than normal. But even at a cut-rate discount it was way overpriced. McD's crappola dollar menu items would have been better.

Not a good experience to gag down (and not finish). I'm usually ordering the same thing here, but I'm afraid this is scaring me off. It wasn't crowded.

Just another fudruckers, johnny rockets, fatburger etc. All a little different but expensive for just a burger! No combo meal just a dollar off when getting fries with a burger, so everything is priced separately.

They also have Haagen Daas desserts which my girlfriend enjoyed, not something important to me though. I did like their selection of sodas, coke zero ftw

Staff was all over personality wise, some employees were quiet and standoffish, the counter girl was the most friendly. The manager used to work at Gordon Biersch I think. 
Seems like the business is too new, decor could be a lot better, eating area is pretty large but plain. I will definitely go back to see if it evolves or I like the plain fries,  burger / cheeseburger etc. just a hard choice with so many other options and create across the street heh",5oiqsyik4YwMVLT6THEdTQ,1,1,3,nt0AHoWxpyByvTJdRpLqnA

2150559,2010-06-22,0,uGcC3CKAolcwfOTMjjoexQ,"The Skinny: Great burgers however spotty consistency  (3), really slow service (3), value - a little more expensive than your usual burger joint but significant better taste.

I would have liked to give this place a four star review however the problem here has been the consistency of the food and service.

My hubby and I dropped in on the grand opening day and were floored by how juicy the burgers were. Like dripping in all the meaty goodness to the point where the bun was becoming over saturated. Although the wait is comparable to a busy In-N-Out,  wait staff were enthusiastic, helpful and eager to make your visit a pleasant one. 

Fast forward a few months later. On our fifth visit, the burger was significantly overcooked to the point of the having a hard crust on the patty. Not only was the burger a disappointment, the entree salad we ordered took significantly long time to come to the table. 

The wait staff apologized for the wait but said they needed to get it exactly right. (FYI, It took over 30 minutes to make a small salad with a fried egg and some bacon crumbled on top right. And the salad wasn't really anything special either.)

Other than the burgers, the chili isn't that much different from Wendy's chili - minus the kidney beans. The french fries are okay - the rosemary flavour is marginally better but not worth the extra cost. The sweet potato fries and veggie frites are too soggy and unappetizing.

Overall, I would recommend it for a good place for a burger but not much else. ""Choose your own burger"" frees you to get the toppings you want - including grilled onions.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,3,T4KYpcM-CkkLrJnjQL8XmA

From reading my beverage cup, I learned that Smashburger actually smashes their Angus beef burgers onto the grill, hence their name. The burgers are soooo good. If you have ever had Fatburger, I think the quality is similar. If a Crabby Patty was manifested into a real life burger---it may possibly taste like a smashburger.

I had the American smashburger and my BF had the Sin City smashburger. His burger was quite tasty---the fried egg made a difference! I love that they serve their burgers in ""egg buns"" too.

The smashfries are the best fries I have ever had. They were crispy and flavorful. I have never had fries like these anywhere else! Yum.

However, for a ""smash"" burger (a ball of ground beef that is smashed into the grill to form a thin patty), Smashburger does it very well. I came in on a Sunday afternoon, so the place was empty. It has a similar style to a Chipotle in both decoration and menu. The lady at the counter was super nice and cheery. 

Based on the reviews here, I ordered the Sin City Burger with Smash Fries and an Oreo Milkshake. It only took a few minutes to be served and I was quite happy with it all. The burger was good. Fried egg, bacon, onion petals, egg bun, and a tender beef patty with smash sauce. They all combined quite well and hit the spot. The fries were thin and crispy, and even without any sauce were quite tasty. The smash fries have a light coating of olive oil and garlic, so that was nice. I opted for the chipotle mayo sauce, and that was a great dip for the fries.

Finally, the oreo milkshake was great. I like that they serve it old school with the metal tin with a generous amount of extra milkshake in. Creamy, thick, and with small chunks of oreo blended in made for a sweet escape from the blazing heat outside.

Overall, I was quite happy with lunch here. Compared to similar burger joints like Five Guys, I would say Smashburger has the edge. For my taste, they have better fries (I find Five guys fries to be too greasy and soggy), more variety in burger offerings, plus great milk shakes compared to no milk shakes.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,0,0,4,uK-3DknuHiVPP8UDEZqXrw

They don't have their liquor license yet cause they are brand new, but They have malt shakes, bottled root beer,  water and the standard soda fountain. What intrigued me was their menu-nice and simple. The place looks cool too. Big red words on the wall and lots of booth and half booth seating inside. They have a small outside eating area if you want to be in the breeze. Here's the review breakdown. 

Ambiance: nice and casual with a hip feel to it. They play alternative music and some yuppie stuff, too. Seating is comfortable and plentiful. 

Service: good. Cashier in the front and they bring you your food if you are eating in. Nice people and it looks like there's only 3 running the front. More than enough. 

Cleanliness: I posted a picture of the floor. Under majority of empty seating we saw food, napkins and other various trash. One booth still had food on the seat so we moved. You may see greasy fingerprints on the leather booth chairs, too. What worries me is that a dirty eating area sometimes reflects the kitchen cleanliness. Despite this, I needed to try it to review so we stayed, but I usually walk out when I see this. Burger joint or not--dirty floors are unacceptable in any eating establishment whether cheap or expensive. They do keep the tables tops fairly clean.

Food: I made my own burger with their smash sauce, side of sweet potato fries, a sin city burger with smash fries and a plain dog with veggie fries. Just to let you know they don't ask how you want your burger cooked. 

Make your own burger:  My burger was salty like they overdid the seasoning on the patty. They also left a bit of cheese on the patty that they pulled off when they realized I ordered without. That left a nice, shiny top to my burger patty. Their smash sauce is mustard mixed with mayo and a bit of salt and pepper.  Bun was nice and light (egg bun) and slightly sweet. It was okay. 

Sin city burger: The sin city burger is great for those who want a really greasy burger, otherwise steer clear. It literally dripped grease. I thought it was egg yolk but it was grease. Lots of it. We're not talking burger grease from the patty, but pure vegetable oil dripping from the burger.  We assume it was the onion rings on top and the fried egg.  They weren't drained on a towel or anything before being placed on the burger, so it was packed with oil. 

Smash dog (plain): The dog is salty hot dog goodness. It's 100% beef and it was split open.  The bun was egg bread with sesame seeds on it, and it was slightly hard.   As for their veggie fries they came out soggy. The oil temp wasn't high enough. 

The highlights  are their sweet potato and smash fries. Herb seasoned with rock salt, they were well seasoned and very good. It tasted like rosemary, thyme and parsley on there.  That was different and nice to eat at a place like this.

Will I come again? Only if I want fries and crave theirs. I don't care for the burger because it honestly looks and tastes like what my dad makes at home, but worse. I like comfort food and will pay when it's worth it, but I won't pay 4 bucks to eat their burgers again. It was too close to what anyone could do at home. They need to find a better seasoning recipe or different way to shape the patties..something to make them stand out more than flattening a patty on a hot flat top. Maybe charbroiled or grilled, otherwise I'll go to dad's and pay him. 

To justify my review, I'm one to love a good burger once in a while.  I love fast food and diner burgers when they are good, but this one was okay but not worth going out to pay for.  It's a good stop for fries, beer (when they get it) and a shake but the burgers didn't impress me enough to justify coming back again. I think I'll do another review six months from now to see if they improve.  I hope to God they clean up the floors and seats better, because any place that has a dirty eating area probably has a messy and dirty kitchen, too.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,1,2,LPL1dX3TByzv2acxjl6txA

Similar price, better tasting burger, more interesting sides, and better atmosphere and service.  The classic cheese is delicious and the spicy baha burger I had with jalepenos, pepper jack, guac, on chipotle bun was incredible.  There regular bun is an egg bread and it's perfect.  They serve great fries with or without rosemary and garlic and their fried pickles are real crispy without being greasy, the best I have had.  The haystack onions are thin sliced fried onions served with a great sauce, it all taste similar to an awesome blossom just different presentation.   

The service was fast for a made to order burger compared to slow as hell fat burger and real friendly compared to ""welcome to fat burger, what the F"".

Service: Quick, efficient!

I was given a number stand to put on my table so that the server could deliver my food to me at my table.

My food came pretty quickly. I don't remember waiting too long for my food upon ordering.

Food: Nice, but nothing amazing
I ordered the classic burger with fries. The burger was nice and hearty. Everything on the burger was cooked thoroughly. My burger had bacon and cheese on it. The fries were a little too greasy for me, however.

The hostess/cashier at the front took our order didnt really say a word about the wait. 30 mins later as i see togo customers packing their own orders in the bags I knew it was busy. Meanwhile my wife is getting stressed because we have somewhere to be. there were about 6 parties that sat down after us and all of the orders came up. 38 minutes in; the food finally pops up. I can read the order window and all the togo food is done after priority of the people sitting in. Not a problem if i was told it would be 45 mins. Meanwhile i confront the hostess if i can get my food because she is knee deep in the weeds. she says no ill do it when im ready. i reply its been 40 mins. she says well im not working in the back its not my fault. being a business owner i understand customer service and i know for a fact the customer is always right even if i tell you its blue and the damn color is red. So i reply are you arguing with me. Which she then says no im just saying its not my fault.

We sat and waited for our shake, and during that time, what we saw made us never want to come to this chain again. First of all, customers were in line waiting 45 minutes just to get their order taken. And they were in the front of the line! Everyone else had walked out, so I'm surprised they stood around. Next, they obviously don't drug test seeing as the woman making shakes was obviously on meth. She was so busy making shakes she wasn't taking orders. And the guy standing next to her was doing just that. Standing. Just standing around. The orders weren't getting cleared out so the cooks had to come out and clear them out themselves. Wallpaper was peeling off the wall. There were boxes of trash stacked up in the kitchen, and there were fries all over the floor. They either pay their employees very poorly here, or they just flat out don't have a manager. They need someone there delegating everything. This was truly shocking. I have been to this location when they first opened and it wasn't like this. It's gone way downhill. Never ever again will we return. 

Edit*** Id like to add, the ""hand spun"" milkshake was absolutely disgusting. I can't believe a major chain is selling this garbage. It tasted like watery milk and cigarettes.

So that's what I ordered and of course the burger was just blah. The meat was overcooked and a total waste of good angus beef. There was a sauce that looked like mustard-mayo, you know da kine like port-of-subs but this one had no flavor to it so it didn't do anything to help the lack luster meat it was sitting on top of.

In fact, it took so long to decide, we just rolled out of work and kind of went ""on the fly"", much later than usual and right in the middle of the traditional lunch hour. I thought we were headed for a chinese buffet, but I wasn't driving (or paying attention) and somehow we wound up in the area of Lake Mead and Tenaya, surrounded by a plethora of choices for the midday meal.

Not being one to ever pass on an opportunity for a good burger, I said ""what about Smashburger?"" We rolled in to a crowded parking lot and thought we might have to find another place to dine, as we are not the patient kind, did not want to wait in line and were beyond hungry. As luck have it, the crowded parking lot is kind of deceptive.  We walked in and were pleasantly surprised there was no wait. The lunch crowd here seemed to get a little bigger closer to the end of the noon hour.

Whoever came up with the idea to put a fried egg on a burger should be Knighted, or at least be made king for a day. The Sin City Burger was fantastic. The meat was fresh and flavorful. The egg and all that accompanied it made the burger that much better. I opted for the Buffalo Fries, and they didn't disappoint. Seasoned with Buffalo seasoning, they were hot (to the touch), a little spicy and full of flavor. The service was fast and friendly and they even came to clean off the table.

If you are looking for a great meal in the middle of the day, served fast and fresh, give Smashburger a try.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the ""Avocado Club"" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The ""Fried Pickles"" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the ""Spicy Black Bean Burger""  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The ""Nutter Butter"" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer.

Anyone who knows how to cook a burger knows when you smash it, it dries it out, which was the case here. Turned out to be dry. Not bad flavor though. The fries were shoestring variety and overall were not very good. The fried pickles were a big disappointment.

Flash forward to 2014.  There are great burgers on every corner (well, almost). That being said, the Sin City is still a great burger, no need to go with the heavier burger, it is quite satisfying with cheese, bacon, onion haystacks, & a fried egg.

As much as everyone seems to like the Smash Fries (crispy shoestring fries tossed in olive oil with garlic, rosemary, and salt), I prefer the Sweet Potato Fries.  Classic thin fry cut, lightly battered/breaded, for crispness, & mildly sweet.

I am glad that there are great burgers out there, but this is one of the places that helped raise the bar in the first place.

4014339,2015-04-28,4,uGcC3CKAolcwfOTMjjoexQ,"Where I go when I want to get smashed!

There are a lot of burger joints in this town, so the competition is fierce (like Sasha).  When I have those off days I want a burger but aren't feeling In N Out or Five Guys, I often end up at Smashburger.  Gotta love those griddled burnt edges!  Smash, smash away my friends!

I'm one who likes the ease of combos on a menu, and finally Smashburger has a few ""Smash Specials"" on their roster.  For $5.99 you can have your choice of a regular:

-Classic Smash
-All American
-Mushroom Swiss
-Classic Hot Dog
-Classic Smashchicken ($6.99)

Each special comes with a small order of French fries or Smash fries (fries seasoned with olive oil, rosemary & garlic).  For another $1.89 you can add on a small drink.  I like the convenience of this as well as the price so I often get this as a meal.  I usually go for the Classic Smash (American cheese, Smash sauce, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle on an egg bun) or the Mushroom Swiss (Crimini mushrooms, Swiss & mayo on an egg bun).  Don't get me wrong, I love the Sin City burger just as much as the next guy, but sometimes I like my fries included with the burger, you know?

You can of course add another $1 and get your Smashburger upgraded to the 'Big' size, but honestly I think it can be a tad dry.  If I'm gonna eat a 'fat' burger, I want the middle of it to be pink & juicy!  Yes folks I said it.  And I mean it.  Their egg bun is where it's at though.  Supple, yet firm, makes their burgers tasty!

The Smash Special combo is just enough to satisfy my appetite.  You hungry eaters will most likely just order the bigger burger to begin with.  I have yet to try most of their other side or options on the menu, but they don't look half bad.  Fried pickles or haystack onions?  I'm in.  Cobb Salad?  I'd give it a whirl.  Hand-spun Haagen-Dazs milkshakes?  I think I will!

Hubby liked the SCB although he prefers his meat a bit rarer (pointed out that SB cooks all burgers a particular way). The Buffalo Chicken was good-maybe a tad too much of the hot sauce but the blue cheese crumbles were perfect!

LOVED the fried pickles- they were light on the outside-juicy warm pickle on the inside with a side of ranch  (ranch was fine-not awesome but it didn't taste like it came from a bottle!).  Loved the Haystack onions and sauce that came with as well.  The chili cheese fries were good.  Light on the chili but still tasty.

Literally outside this restaurant is a ton of places to eat at in a one mile radius.  If you're in the mood for burgers around here, you have IN-N-Out, Five Guys, use to have Create, and this place.  

The inside of this place is always clean and all you will see is red.  Fine with me, just as long as all I see isn't blue.  When you walk into this place, it is deceivingly busy.  Long lines during lunch time, but line goes through quick.  The sfaff also brings the food to you.  A plus for me is that this place has real silverware.  I'm a dipper when I eat burgers.  So I usually cut my burgers in 3 portions so that I can dip them.  Doing this with plastic silverware is sometimes a challenge. 

Now for the food.  I haven't tried any of their angus burgers at this point.  When it comes to burgers, I like them plain (meat, cheese, bun, and that's it).  So, I can only review their Chicken Sandwiches. 

-Crispy Chicken Sandwhich w/Swiss:  Had ranch added and it's pretty good.  Reminds me of the Charleston Chicken Sandwich that Denny's use to have.

-Grilled Chicken Sandwhich w/Swiss:  Tasted a little bland

-Smash Fries:  Addicting

-Bottled Water:  $2 for a bottle of Crystal Geyser water. You can get a case of this water at Big Lots for less than $3.  

-Milk Shakes:  I've been lectured more than once because I have never tried their shakes.  Everyone I've talk to swears by them.  So if you're reading this, try their shakes!!

My rating may change after I try their angus burgers and shakes, but for now just a 4 because I left satified everytime.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,1,4,O474mpgmYpcgRERlf3ekgA

By that I mean being near the combo prices of the large chain burger joints with drive-thrus (Carl's Jr, McDonalds, etc), Smashburger's taste blows them away.  Also, when it comes to probably the closest resemblance of a competitor in my opinion - Five Guys, they also blow them away when it comes to value and taste compared to your dollars spent.

Numerous reviews describe the menu choices, so I will skip that except the mention of the fried pickles - this is something you don't see at most burger places and my daughter loves these!  You can also opt to replace your fries in a combo for these (I think for a price difference).

The burgers have that home made appeal and flavor with fresh ingredients and the way the edges are crispy really make things pop.  If you want to make yourself feel really guilty, get one of their shakes that are fantastic and have that old malt shop feeling about them.

I have been going on and off to Smashburger for a couple of years because my sister is in love with SB.  The burgers are ok and will get the job done, but that is about it.  They do have several speciality burgers, with the Sin City burger being the highlight of the menu.  They have recently added a new Truffle Mushroom burger to the menu.  I tried it the last time I was there and I was so disappointed by the burger.  It was smothered in truffle oil which completely overwhelmed the whole burger, as well as made it super oily.  Oh well, I guess I will just stick with the Sin City burger from here on out.

I don't know if this is true for you or not, but the fries are super important to any burger experience in my book.  The fries here are so-so at best.  Fries are super skinny and almost always extremely greasy, in a bad way.   They just don't have much fry flavor for me, but rather just frying oil.  Yuck.

The side item that saves Smashburger for me are the Haystack Onions.  These qualify for the status of statuses know as ""Oh My Goodness FANTASTIC!""  I could eat 3 baskets full of them I think.  They are crunchy, flavorful, and finger lickin' good.  Yummy!

Kaboom!"" I progress...

#1 Burgers are juicy, fresh, and indeed smashed; buns are of the egg-variety; toppings galore.
#2 They serve all beef hot dogs too. 
#3 Outdoor patio is just far enough off the parking lot with just enough planters filled with just enough flowers to make it almost, just almost seem like a sidewalk cafe in a real city.
#4 Plenty of space for dining and lingering. 
#5 Smash Fries are strange because they are herbed yet had no herbs. It was as if they smashed the potatoes, mixed the mush with herbs or herb-like bits, reconstituted the potatoes into fry-like shapes and fried them up. The result was fries with an herbal essence, not herbed fries. Perhaps not an issue for you (certainly not a deal breaker for me) but worth noting.

After the first couple of bites, I had already regretted not getting the bigger 1/2 lb. version. Each bite was pure bliss. Although, it was a bit too greasy for my tastes. Fat does equal flavor though, so sometimes you just gotta roll with it, especially if you're hungry.  The haystack onions taste just like you would expect it to taste, except they were excessively greasy. Definitely nothing to rave about. And this time, the excess oil was unwarranted. It was like they didn't even shake off the oil when it came from the fryer. For a $2 side, you'd think you'd get a bigger quantity, but you don't really get much of it at all.

There's been an explosion of different burger franchises in the last few years to challenge the leaders.  But I think SmashBurger has a way to go.

I was less than impressed by the [lack of] atmosphere.  I could be a fan of minimalist design, but I found the grey upper walls and khaki lower ones just depressing.  The counter where you order your food looks like they forgot to build the other half.  But they say you can't eat the atmosphere, so on to the food.

My husband and I both ordered the Mushroom and Swiss burger, but I substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Swiss.  The burger was cooked medium-well, but was still juicy and didn't suffer from what I usually complain about - too much salt.  But there must have been such a tiny bit of the cheese, since I didn't get even the slightest kick from it.  The egg bun tastes very good, but isn't firm enough to hold up under the liquid from the burger, pickles, tomatoes, and grilled onions.  My husband ordered the sweet potato fries, which I'm not crazy about, so I just had the burger.  To me, they looked almost burnt, but he loves burnt food, so it was okay by him.  

Because I had just the burger, I left feeling as if I'd had an appetizer, not dinner.  I wish they offered a side salad, or something besides more fried stuff.  But they don't.

The burger was juicy but as some had said was slightly greasy probably because of the egg and bacon too.

I usually get a simple burger, less is more -- but I decided to live on the cardiac edge and try the Sin City Burger, the local signature burger with bacon, haystack onions, grilled onions, an egg, American cheese, smash sauce and Lipitor. 

SO. DAMN. GOOD.

Usually, I find Smashburgers a bit on the overly salty side, but this was perfectly seasoned and all the artery-clogging deliciousness worth every bite. I could only eat half, but the rest reheated well the next day (though, wrap it up when you get home in clingwrap, the box lets the bun dry out).

In visits past I've had their Veggie Frites, which are a pass, in my opinion. Always super greasy with limp vegetables.  No one likes flaccid veg.  

I also am not a big fan of their turkey burger, for what it's worth. Bland, pre-formed patties -- or so it seemed.

 The place didn't have a very friendly feel to it. I don't know why, it just seemed like the staff really didn't have much mojo for being there. Next, the burger was pretty good, but I fell prey to the temptation to make it too complex. With these burger places, if you keep it simple you usually end up with a tastier burger. I didn't follow my simple is better mantra and ended up with a big, sloppy mess. After I scraped off most of the mayo, ketchup, and smashburger sauce it was pretty decent. Where the two star review comes in is with the fries and milkshake.

 The fries were not very fresh tasting at all. It was like they were a little freezer burned and then fried in old oil. The milkshake was too watery-in other words, too much milk, not enough ice cream. Oh yeah, guess how much my sloppy burger, inedible fries and watered down shake set me back? $8? $10? $12?

All wrong, it was nearly $14 with tax! 

Really it was quite a ripoff if you think about it. I've been to normal sit down restaurants with true waiter service that will have a great burger for $8 or $9 that comes with fries and a deli pickle. 

Do you want a really good burger that will remind you of Fourth of July cookouts and happier times? Go to a Five Guys when they come, or even In-and-Out Burger. They are both better at what Smashburger tries to do.",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,2,0,2,iyZM7BQGqjI5fUdio83bZw

I've made a few trips here, and I've never been let down. At all. On my last trip here, I bought food for myself and my way-picky brother. I bought him the larger cheeseburger with fries and a Nutter Butter shake. I got the spicy burger, rosemary fries, and the shake, too. Altogether, I spent $26. It's more expensive than In N Out, sure, but it's worth it.

First of all, the meat was delicious. It was perfectly juicy and tender without being undercooked. It was great, and seemed a mile apart from McDonald's-type stuff. Win. The bread was better, too, as were all the little extras: crisp lettuce, cold onions, juicy tomatoes... the works. Everything was great, and really in a different league than any other fast food place. The sauce on my spicy burger was great, too, and was more ""gourmet"" than I expected. It was another little bonus that kicked this place up another notch. When we finished our burgers and fries, both of us were fully stuffed. It's a lot of food, without really considering the shake. The shake was delicious, and way thicker and tastier than I expected. Again, it's more upscale. It's not even fair to compare Smashburger and McDonald's.

One thing you know pretty much before you take one step inside this small burger chain,  you're gonna like your meal. There's something salivating about smashing ingredients onto or into a fresh juicy all beef patty. 

Upon entering a smashburger it's clear that is ain't your typical burger joint.  Don't expect any mind altering experience, like Dorthy had upon arriving in the land of munchkins and the yellow brick road, but certainly not the homogeneous looks of the big chains of McD's, BKing, Jacks ( formerly known as jack in the box) Karl's Jr, Wendy's, Taco Bell and others that dominate this resturant category.  Simple typography of classic burger ingredients don the walls and a pleasant combination of Maroon, natural wood, Browns and wine color palette slowly come to focus revealing snippets of other menu items available.  While the typical layout of tables, ordering counter and soda fountain machine gently remind you that this is still a ""fast food"" establishment. 

But onto the main stage:  How's the food?
Take one part great FRESH food and FRESH INGREDIENTS and one part creative-takes-on-classics and smash them together!  You end up with a meal that somehow gets into you belly faster than you expected and well before you realize you remember to savor the last few bites.   Smash sweet potato fries add a perfect compliment to more than 90% of the menu. Hand made to order shakes available in the classic Chocolate, vanilla strawberry flavored and these are not the only choices.  Other mouthwatering favors include salted caramel, Oreo blend, and seasonal flavors.   

Food is delivered by onsite employees and on metal baskets with smashburger branded parchment paper. 

Overall, this place rocks and definitely has raised the bar on what quality fast food can be.  They smashed more than food, they smash the competition into the chuck ground.",1b5ghutIrDsrAcpKs1b6NQ,0,0,5,nSy3vsgYx2b64x6x6DTm7A

The burger was nothing to brag about. The flavor was decent, slightly salty. I got the large Bacon Cheeseburger and my friend ordered the Medium Size Bacon Cheeseburger.

The Applewood bacon on my burger was gummy. My friend's bacon was really small. I think they divided 1 slice into 3 different pieces on her's.

 The first bite of burger was WAY too salty. The limp lettuce leaf and mushy tomato didn't help either. The red onions added a nice bite of flavor.
 The fries were glorious and popping one in with each burger bite saved it's cheesy life! 
 The shake was a chocolate mint Oreo, in a smallish glass but served with the rest in a frozen metal shake glass, great temp control!

The BF and I grabbed the Sin City burger (egg, onion strings, grilled onions, American cheese, smash sauce, egg bun). This was good, but it was very rich. I think I would ask this without the cheese since egg is enough creamy richness. I was a bit worried about the reviews saying it's burnt and salty or dripping grease. It was cooked medium well, juicy but not overly greasy. It was lacking sauce though so I grabbed some BBQ sauce. 

Mom and Grandma got the Spicy Baja (pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato,onion, chipotle mayo, slice jalapenos, chipotle bun). They enjoyed it and said they would come back again. 

We shared 4 sides:

Sweet Potato Fries- interesting take that it's not plain or sweet, but have savory herbs on it. It had a smidge too much rosemary, but was good.

Fried Pickles- they were pretty good, but kinda salty after eating a couple.

Mixed Veggies- I thought these were going to be breaded, but were more sauteed. They had good flavor and just something different to snack on. 

Haystack Onions- this was the winning side. I love string onions and theirs were nicely done.

Our food came out fairly quickly, but BF and I got the wrong burgers so had to wait for them to refire the right ones. Overall it was a decent burger, but far from being the best in Vegas.

I saw they have shakes, I'm a fan of good shakes(Jack in the Box's real ice creams shakes are killa!) but I had to pass on that, maybe on the next visit. I asked what the difference between the two sizes is. 1/3 and 1/2lb patty. I decided on the Sin City burger Big Size & order of Smash fries(tossed in olive oil, rosemary & garlic). Sin City comes with bacon, their sauce and an egg. Eggs can be an awesome burger/sandwich topping so that clinched it as the first burger to try! Burger was a nice size and delicious. The fries, I really wasn't sure. Being my first time I tried a few fries first to taste them but I really couldn't tell if there was any rosemary and/or garlic. Far as I could tell it either wasn't really well seasoned/tossed or they gave me regular fries cause they sure seemed like regular fries...Service was good so I was sitting around 3.5 stars for this place since the only real disappointment was the fries. 
Still, would be enough to warrant another try in the future.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,0,1,4,J5o127VcDGzrRkmfLEIHyQ

I'm not entirely sure what this place is doing, it promised a gourmet burger and garlic fries but really all I ended up with was a 15-minute wait and some little chisel sticks.  The jalapeno burger wasn't at all and was missing vital parts, like spice.

And waited.....another staff member strolled out of the kitchen and proceeded to make a shake, which she consumed herself, as we waited....and waited.  It was laughable as the original young fellow, (remember him) finally came over to let us know that they were very shorthanded and it would be, and I quote, ""at least eleven minutes until someone would be AVAILABLE,  to take our order!""
At that time,  each in our party of 4 laughed, and then we proceeded to the In and Out Burger a short distance from the Smashburger.
Of course the order was promptly taken, and we were eating in a reasonable amount of time.

Everything I had was so utterly salty and cooked bad, that eating at McDonalds would have been much better than eating here.  

Where do I start?  Fries, were the type of fries that might have been sitting out the day before.  They were all petrified, and extremely salty.  The kind of fries where every single one tasted like a bad potato chip.  They were supposed to have sea salt on them, which would have made the saltiness a little bearable, but there was no trace of sea salt on these.  

Haystack Onion strings were seasoned so badly I had to throw them out.  They had this funky taste that made me think they were seasoned with ground up chicken bullion cubes.  I kid you not.  They were just so over the top they were inedible.

The burger probably was better than the sides but all the burger was, was a huge mass of gray meat.  There was no char whatsoever, as if it was microwaved or something.  I took a few bites and didn't finish this either.  The only thing I liked about this burger was the wheat bun, but it was so doughy and starchy, way too much bread for meat.

There are very few burger joints in the area worse than this place, go to all of them and you'll know you ate better than eating at Smash Burger.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,1,0,1,pErbYfAWJEP7yKo2sB0pIQ

I do like that they have some kind of unique items on the menu (veggies frites, sweet potato fries, fried pickles).  You can switch out chicken instead of hamburger on a number of the burgers. A fountain drink, burger, and fries cost me just over $10.00, which I think is a pretty good value for a quality burger.

And now the verbose version :p

So, Groupon offered a burger promo a few months back to a few burger joints around Vegas.  Smashburger was one of the options, and I selected the Lake Mead location because I have never been to this location before.

It is located in a popular strip mall plaza (Dolphin Court Day Spa, Grape Street, Starbuck, DQ, Walgreen, and a Red Box) and gets plenty of traffic.  But on a chilly Thursday evening in November, I did not have to wait at all to place my order nor have trouble finding a booth to sit down and enjoy the Chocolate Malt Shake and Grilled Chicken Avocado Club plus a side order of Smashwedge salad.

Their Grilled Chickens are always nice and juicy, and what you end up ordering will be up to your personal preference or your mood.  I went with the Avocado Club option, and it was delicious. 

The Side of Smashwedge Salad was pretty good, but you have to really love blue cheese and blue cheese dressing.

Their milkshakes and malts are all very good.  Today I went with the Chocolate Malt, and it was as delicious as always.

Only gripe about dining at Smashburger is that the burgers and chicken sandwiches are not at all a big hearty sandwich, and a growing teenager or someone with a healthy appetite can easily put away two of them.  Which means taking out a family of four here can easily put a small dent in a parent's wallet.

Service was good, and my order was placed without any issues.  

Location:  SW.  Near the 95 and Summerlin Parkway..

Taste:  4/5  I like the food I have had at Smashburger overall, except I am not a fan of their ""onion rings"".  All their milkshakes and malts are excellent!

Price:  3/5  A tad pricier compared to their peers.

Quality:  5/5 Everything appears to be made from fresh ingredients.

Parking:  3/5  In a busy plaza with plentiful parking spaces, although not all of them are right outside the front of the restaurant.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,2,3,07VXH70mJLgVOXetDpLtJg
