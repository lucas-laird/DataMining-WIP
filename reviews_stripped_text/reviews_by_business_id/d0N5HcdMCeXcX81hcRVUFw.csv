I would have asked for another order of fries with no salt, but I had seen there were no fresh fries being made at the time as the fry bin was full of those dreadful salt covered fries. I was on my lunch break and I didn't have the time to wait for a fresh batch. I spent around 3 minutes wiping my fries with tissues, desperately trying to get the salt off. Unfortunately this isn't the first time this has happened at this particular restaurant location. I am reluctant to go back anytime soon.",c7wVtEduFIb8PRLaF5TXug,0,0,2,N-eyBO_bTSMrjuQdKHxpfQ

Of my cheeseburgers I ordered, one of them did NOT have a beef patty in it. Just onions and a slice of cheese. Really?!? How does that get through the assembly line and into a wrapper?

Usually, the customer service is excellent and the food is fresh and delicious but on Friday after work I had the worst experience I've ever had at a McDonalds. 
I ordered a combo meal is a small with a lemonade for my son and the ""lady"" who took my order rudely said ""we don't have small, and we don't have lemonade"" okay fine. The smallest size and a Sprite will do. I paid with a different lady who was nice and wished me a good day but the ""lady"" at the last window who gave me my order (the same ""lady"" who took my order) didn't say a word as she handed me the drink and then the bag of food. Literally. Not. One. Word. Okay, ""lady."" It didn't help that she had a dirty, nasty rag hanging out the window. Disgusting!
Luckily, it was a great week and the day before my sons birthday so instead of pulling in and mentioning the blatant rudeness and lack of customer service I went on my way. When I opened my burger, the cheese was cold and not even close to melted. Nuggets and fries were fresh.

All the window tables have electricity, inviting those of us who enjoy computer work. Yet I have never found the dinning room too crowded so that I feel I am taking dining space from others.

What can I say about the food? Well, it is McDonald's so hamburger fare is what you get. The coffee is super; I never find myself missing Starbucks. 

I second the mention of the beautiful chandelier in the center of the dining area--beautiful and classy. All in all, I count this location as my favorite McDonald's in Las Vegas.",Ta1TWU5uYRFHEpBemUdG9A,0,0,5,sJTzYtYHO0fwq-g3oF_tUA

Not that hard.) if you're going to have someone on the drive through then they should be able to take orders efficiently and speak clearly enough for the person on the other end to understand. She was nice though. Then went to get the food and went home. Everything was there except it was stale and the burger buns were burnt. Not good at all.

The lady we ordered the was nice. They have a sticker at the ordering machine where it says you get a free fries when you downloaded Uber eats. Well the girl I ordered with had no idea about this. 
I pulled up at the window to pay, the guy there being really friendly. And he also was able to answer the question about the Uber eats promotion and he informed me it ended last week. So I told him, they might want to take those stickers off, because they are still out there showing this promotion. 
Pulling up to the food window, the woman straight throws the drinks in my face in one of those transport drink holders. I look at her and tell her, that I don't want that, I have more than enough cup holders in my car. I don't need more trash them needed. I'm used from all the other McDonalds, that staff first ask me if I want one. Well the woman rolls her eyes, because o don't want that drink holder.
