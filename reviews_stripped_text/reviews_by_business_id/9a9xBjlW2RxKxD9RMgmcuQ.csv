28224,2014-09-10,3,9a9xBjlW2RxKxD9RMgmcuQ,DISGUSTING!!  What a nasty McDonalds! The bathrooms were filthy with no toilet paper. Waited a ridiculously long time for a Jalapeno Double burger which was so gross I threw the majority of it in the trash. It was cold and the slice of processed cheese they slopped on there was not even close to melted. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!,D6Svy1ujwTRwjYRBWWOyow,1,1,1,6GscMAOAoawbU3O4tCMmNQ

Extremely happy. sometimes I wake up and I rushed to McDonald's to get there before 10 a.m. just to get breakfast but now I don't have to get there by 10 a.m. . my first meal of the day even if it's at 12 o'clock noon or 1 p.m. I consider it breakfast time. My favorite is the sausage McMuffin with egg. and the price you can't beat it. Two for $3 and change. I'm loving it.,Nmrfk7jTdWW2tGP0I8AUbQ,3,1,5,-Sdu5r3siabeEnLQ63YeHg

My daughter slid on the floor and hit her nose on a table. Her nose was bleeding profusely, a sweet little family that was there eating came over to offer help. The drive thru attendant came out of his little room and went and got us ice and told us he would inform the manager. He came back with the ice And said his manager was too busy to come out? Really someone gets hurt and they don't even come out to make sure the child is ok? Unreal! The manager finally came out with the offer to get more napkins.

I came here on Christmas Eve as I have a family tradition feeding the homeless. Forget about them donating any food rather than throwing it away they wouldn't even give a discount. So again I bought a few bags out of pocket to hand out. Not only did they make me drive around the drive-thru 3 times but then they keep me waiting outside for another 15-20 minutes.

At least at my son's work at Starbucks donated  hot coffee for us to give to the homeless.

All of our guest kept complimenting how nice and easy the party was. They refrigerated our cake and cupcakes for us and all of the food was great. The kids got to play the whole time and the adults got to just talk and enjoy themselves. No clean up and the best part is it was so affordable. This is one of the nicest McDonald's locations I have been to. The playplace and outside grounds are the cleanest and very well kept.

When I arrived at the window to pay for the order I placed the guy opened the window and just stared at me. I had to ask him how much I owed so that I could pay for my order. I guess he just assumed I could understand anything he might have uttered through their high quality drive thru speakers.

The drive through service was extremely slow. This is one of those places that make you wish you would have parked and walked in because you probably would have gotten your food faster.

I think being a kid at heart will still result in strange looks from other parents, if I ever did get to play in the Play Place. BUT this review is isolated to their drive-thru service; so that's irrelevant :P

I have nothing awful to say here. I love that they have two lanes and either lane at anytime I've decided to drive through, there is voice wanting to know what you're hungry for. If it isn't fries for me, then hash browns. And they're ALWAYS crispy... with salsa please. Fries ALWAYS off the fryer with some of my fave soggy ones I will hunt for first. (Please don't question why I prefer crispy hash browns but soggy fries. It's a natural characteristic.)

Who doesn't want a super-size drink for just a $1. Any size all day! Great sweet tea and enough ice left over for my crunching habit. Then their Caramel Macchiatos ALWAYS hot! Trust the cup warning. With non-fat milk it's still super delish and creamy. Today though, they apologized for having me wait for it. They gave me a complimentary ticket for free small fries, or pie, or cone. Even after parking in the reserved drive-thru waiting spot, a couple minutes later my yummy hot and cozy warms up my tummy Caramel Macchiato is being brought to me.

This is what prompted my review. They have standards and they wanna live up to it. They're an international brand. How does a little kink in service matter to them this much? Because us as customers have expectations. For me an apology and explanation would've been sufficient. This complimentary ticket just shows how they will scrutinize themselves for me, due to those little kinks in quick efficient service. You guys this is quality. They want to be excellent at it!

If I could purchase their machine and recipe for the ice cream, It would be sitting in my kitchen this minute. 

99c for 99 calories of perfect treat. I know there are tons of soft serve ice cream out there but Micky D makes it just right to my taste. Packed at least 6 inches high on a tiny cone. It's not to watery, not too creamy. Not too soft and not too hard. Not too sweet. It takes me 10 minutes to get through the whole cone and I do savor those 10 minutes.

Only thing reminiscent of a Mickey D's is at least the sweet tea is on point & that's it -
They are the slowest rudest saltiest & grossest mc D's around - do yourself a favor & keep truck in til u see the next set if Golden Arches - this place is a dump!",y0axDGrceM7ve0chunw2Iw,1,0,1,hc0hXk496DY_vJ0LBD5jVg

Last vist was on 8/20/14 around 2:30pm. Went in to get my girl a Ice tea, it was me and one other couple in line. As we waited for about 5 min for someone to come and talk to us (we watched multiple employees look directly at us and say nothing, like we were inconveniencing them). I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and tell myself that they are very busy lol and go to the bathroom. After a 10 min dump I came back out to attempt to order my ice tea. Same result. I am the only one standing there and now its time to cause some friction. I asked ""HELLO ANYONE HOME""? No one came to check if I needed service, they did look at me, but no one attempted to say anything.  I said ""you have got to be fucking kidding me"" NOTHING. I couldn't take it anymore as I have been in the same situation at this place before. I stormed out upset, but i guess there are worse things in the world as me not getting my iced tea. I would advise you try the Wendy's up the street, at least they acknowledge you as a customer. This is the second time I have called the corporate office with the promise of something and the delivery of nothing. Please if you want to know how NOT to run a fast food business, come here for training.",UPZIgefiKxKNcsZMeWc3jQ,0,0,1,YGpDQR6yuanBcilfKD-aEA

The choice was easy Since only one outlet was available and this wolf was at 3% battery and needs to get his Yelp on.  Interesting artwork in the dining room or as he locals call it ""kids room.""   Food was fast and looked as if it as was made right from the picture.   They even offer the silverware in a ""take home"" option.  Brilliant.  I enjoyed this very much.  All I expected and more.   Hats of to the Chef Ronald and team!!!

Nope.

The color scheme is so nice with teal, magenta, olive, rust, orange and browns. I saw babies to seniors enjoying a cool place to eat and be entertained by the flat screen tv's and interactive games. There are a variety of seating options from 1 to many. Booths, bar stools and ottomans. The play area is huge with plenty of seating and tall extended ceiling. The actual play gym has a lot activities inside it's almost like America Ninja Warrior for kids lol. The ordering and pick up area is very small, lines form quickly. The self serve area is dope. Someone made a good penny off the lid dispenser, finally keep your dirty paws off my lid. Clean clean clean. I am so impressed. Drop your tray into the cubby. Organized clean I can dig it.
