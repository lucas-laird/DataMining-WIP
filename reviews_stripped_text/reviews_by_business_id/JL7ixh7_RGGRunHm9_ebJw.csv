As soon as we stepped in the restaurant we were pleasantly greeted and sat by Stephanie; a lovely and friendly server.  She was an absolute pleasure to deal with, very attentive and with a great personality.  

The atmosphere was classy and relaxed, I felt welcomed the second I stepped inside.  With it's dim lighting and retro design the place is perfect for a night out with friends and family.  It being a new restaurant,  I asked the server for a suggestion on what I should order. I thought, ""I'll let them show me what this place is all about"". I am glad I did. The food was absolutely stellar. I ordered the ""chef's special"" that night which was a spicy chicken and rice dish.  It was hands down one of the best meals I've had in a while. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. The chef is extremely talented, and her dish tasted like I should have paid more for my dinner. SO GOOD, If you're looking for great Mediterranean food and atmosphere, you cannot go wrong with this place. 

Also, if you're looking for quality hookah in Las Vegas, there are only a hand full of places where you will find it, and if you do, the service is not the best. In my experience of visiting hookah lounges, you either get great hookah, or great service, never both. FINALLY, a place that you can expect both. loading a proper hookah has an art to it, and the hookah masters have nailed it. I had to leave for my appointment before my bowl was finally gone. 

I cannot say enough good things about this new restaurant/hookah bar. I'm glad they are open for business, and if they continue with this model, passion and attention to the customer, we will all enjoy this place for a long time.",U1l5QWC4hn5xEQ_ir3fwrA,2,0,5,nx9NhVbPpixZ4lvkmaDsaw

What came was dry falafel plate with small slices of tomatoes, pickles and cucumber with one pita cut in half.  The tahini sauce was barely a tablespoon.  The gyro plate came with paper thin slices of meat, a 1/2 cup of salad, one pita and another tablespoon of sauce. We do not mind spending money on food, but this was ridiculous.

Our order was taken, and 40 minutes later, we still had no food. No explanation, zero customer service, and no food. When we got so hungry we decided to leave, the staff watched us leave without a word.",4YhH5WyN8hKhRyo14Thpww,0,0,1,P6xpWcKt-vcTCpjQOW6CHA

Chris, the early shift mixologist has a very special touch with his liquors, and he listened to my wife and blended a cocktail to her description of flavor and hit it perfectly,  CJ, our server was very cheerful, helpful, and honest.  A breath of fresh air and presented our drinks, appetizer, and order with grace and class, even tending to our left overs.  Jeanine was a major surprise.  She is the chef at the restaurant, and came out and talked to us personally about questions we had about dishes, gave us sound recommendations, and prepared absolutely marvelous Preserved Lemon Chicken Tangine an Beef Schwarma plate with salad.  Jeanine visited us twice personally during the meal, and as a final pass try her homade Baklava for desert.  I see return visits in our futureI",QevYjxVahffbvVM53g9a0w,0,0,5,vTEY73jsrCtDBsxTZlGEtg
902646,2016-12-27,0,JL7ixh7_RGGRunHm9_ebJw,"As lovers of hookah, our experience was beyond horrible. When we first got to the place, we ordered one of the fresh fruit bowls. The bowl was too harsh and the person who was serving us was kind enough to offer to change it for us. A woman who seemed to be the manager started yelling at him in front of us - asking things like ""why did they have two bowls and we're not charging them for it?"". She was constantly pointing at us and making us feel really uncomfortable. We went and talked to her and explained to her that he was only trying to help. Afterwards, the same woman asked us to change our seats as she ""reserved"" them for someone else. We said OK, and we moved outside, which was freezing, as there were zero open seats inside. After being outside for less than an hour, the same woman comes back and says ""sorry you've been smoking for too long and we need to use the hookah you're using for someone else - we have a policy that you could only smoke for 45 minutes only"".  I have have been to so many hookah places and I have NEVER experienced such horrible service. The woman who's the manager obviously has zero experience in the service industry. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone.",_AjDfIIGz8_EnwqeC7uKAw,6,0,1,WlGNIJznkroDTXZvdLExdA
1226192,2017-04-16,0,JL7ixh7_RGGRunHm9_ebJw,"This is by far one of the absolute worst hookah lounges I have ever had the misfortune of visiting. First off when we got our hookah it was obvious that the bowl was packed way too tight, so it made for a really hard draw. Second of all, they put five coals on it so it was not only a hard pull, but also tasted very harsh. When we asked to take a few coals off because it was too harsh. They took one off, which didn't really do anything to help the situation. Also the flavors we picked were completely masked by whatever flavor the person before us had smoked. Did I mention that they clearly don't wash their hookahs or even change the water???Yeah, the water in our base was a very dark BROWN color when we got it. That's BEFORE we even started smoking. The inside and outside of the place is amazing, but what they serve you inside is something God awful. The staff was really friendly and nice, but it's obvious that no one has taught them how to make even a half decent bowl. The hookah here will make you feel noxious and sick after 10 mins of smoking. Not exactly a relaxing experience. Stay away if you value your health. Definitely not coming back here again.",80M199lg5RFnkvzNDhltig,0,0,1,xWMr6J03OzEdI5KY0TNILw
1829539,2017-03-06,0,JL7ixh7_RGGRunHm9_ebJw,"Wow. The food was incredibly bad. Got delivery from here and the gyro meat looked like spam, the falafel tasted like sawdust and the tabouleh was actually off (rancid). Imagine the worst bar food you've ever seen, then make it worse than that. We took a few bites of each dish, then threw it all out and ordered from a different restaurant. First time in my life I've ever done that. Pretty clear the rest of these 5 star reviews are fake and/or the owner's friends.",ESArK9E3EWPOkBYwa8uNSw,0,0,1,UT4L0wx3JNwO8ILIAiiqIQ

So u can imagine my surprise walking into Karizma and being blown away. From the moment I stepped in I garnered the attention of the staff. The food was impeccable with a home made feel that's hard to duplicate. The hookahs are brand new with spot-on flavors that out lasted me as I enjoyed the mystical, Moroccan-style decor.  The pricing is on par with other hookah lounges. On my visit the place ran seamlessly under the attentive direction of the manager in charge, Zahra. I feel her grace, attention to detail and welcoming smile was contagious and helped set Karizma apart from others. Check it out and you maybe blown away too!",TX9FFKsImwxBTgeFD1wIKw,0,0,5,Ji9OlCEXuBWY3Y1hE3ex_g
2403710,2017-05-18,0,JL7ixh7_RGGRunHm9_ebJw,"Really disappointed in everything here. I won't leave a bad review based off the terrible decor and lackluster service because I've learned you can't expect those things at a middle eastern hookah lounge/restaurant so my review reflects only the low quality food and burnt hookah. If everything was really cheap I wouldn't be surprised with the quality but prices were definitely higher than expected. It's very obvious that they copy/pasted the concept/menu from a successful business that has been in town for a very long time and they definitely implemented it very poorly. They are the restaurant equivalent of a cheap knock off item, except it's the same price as a genuine one.",Hb6byMh4r-r3KmdqEnTSRQ,0,0,1,Gwx7skDuUSKhffOpjyLX5Q

3332826,2017-03-05,0,JL7ixh7_RGGRunHm9_ebJw,Solid hookah bar all around. Not very crowded on a Saturday night and only $15 for a 3 flavor hookah with $10 refills. Food costs about $15 for a full plate but was very large. The hookah wasn't the strongest and the food wasn't former but the full ensemble was very good overall.

The food is just great.  I had the chicken & beef (koobideh) kabobs which were just perfect.  Sepehr is really on top of the hookah and does great fruit top hookah (pineapple top is what I got)  and special tobacco flavour mixes.  Ask him for the 7 fruit mix flavour in particular.  I call it the Sepehr as it is not really on the menu. Zara goes out of her way to make sure your experience is memorable. This place is lucky to have the two of them.

Update.  Zara and Sepehr are no longer there and the reason I was told is the owner didn't pay them.  Not cool.  They were the only reason I went there as they created a great atmosphere.  Changed my rating accordingly.",CoDepBR1sqDOTks4iSKJtQ,4,2,1,xwjTmZhDw1y7uEUimXAf_A
