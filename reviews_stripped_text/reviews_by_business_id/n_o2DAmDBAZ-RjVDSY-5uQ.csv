I ordered the petite filet medium rare with creamed spinach and both were orgasmically delicious!!! Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed there meal and experience. Service was top notch as well as the view we had from our booth. I highly recommend going here for any special occasion or just because. I am a lover of red meat and they knocked it out of the park!!! 

We have been to the one in Palm Desert and that Ruth's just does not measure up to this one as far as the food goes. My husband and I have been here a few times now and they never fail!!!  Yummy yummy for your tummy!!!",8Z76cW_VT1ZJL-ssijX1wQ,0,0,5,Wn6Kb5NVEqRihA45ivKN8Q

It now caters to tourist and the romantic, intimate settings are gone. The food is pretty much the same- 500 degree plates that continue to cook your meat, service that is wonderful, bar that is what it used to be. I was kind of let down. Had a great booth overlooking the giant sign that lights up brightly at 8 pm and the cement building of the hotel next door. So much for intimate and romantic. While my date and I are dressed up, the people across the aisle sat in Bermuda shorts. I know they have a dress code but obviously it has changed along with the change of location. I am sure this works out well for the corporate America that has taken over the Casino life in Vegas, but some of us still like intimate and romantic when spending mega bucks for a dinner.

    Our waiter John was fabulous, he was friendly and very helpful to us in our wine and menu selections. The steaks that we ordered came out exactly the way we wanted and tasted great. The baked potato was split in the kitchen for us and the green beans were prepared expertly. 

    We don't splurge like this very often, so when you spend that kind of money on a nice dinner it's nice to have everything turn out so wonderful.

134493,2014-06-03,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,We'd never been there before and thought that we'd give it a try. The hostess greeted us upon arrival and was very pleasant. We were seated right away. We did not wait for our drink orders to be taken; the waitress was right there to explain everything to us. Angie was great and repeatedly checked up on us to make sure that we were ok. The problem was the food. I ordered Lobster Bisque and it was just not as expected. Barely any small little bits of lobster in it at all and the flavor was not great. I had ordered a NY strip med/rare with an order of shrimp to go with it. The shrimp was dry and tough and the steak was raw in the middle. Poor Angie had to say that this was their med/rare but it was cold and purple in the middle and I knew that she was just trying to make it seem like it wasn't an error. Funny thing is that my husband ordered his filet medium and it also came out raw in the middle. He just didn't say anything about it. What was most disappointing is that this is supposed to be one of the best places to get a good meal and to get what you pay for and it was just mediocre at best. You'd think that they would know how to prepare steaks to the letter by now. We live here and like to splurge on an expensive meal a few times a year but we won't be going to Ruth's Chris.,s5sdgacFonCsVsvP2CvceA,0,0,2,CWKXrYj-QeVuV0mbS8xN6w

Three of the four of my group selected the Steak Sandwich ($12, with fries), which is amazing and a great value, especially considering the price nearly doubles to $22 after Happy Hour. The lobster dish was chosen by the fourth person, and while it tasted great according to him, the portion was conspicuously smaller. 

The Steak Sandwich comes on a garlic French roll/baguette, and the steak is topped with b√©arnaise sauce. It also comes with a generous portion of fries. I asked for mine medium-rare, but I did think it was closer to rare as some of the pieces looked like they had just been seared and the inside looked purple. I still ate it, though. And it was delicious. Next time, though, I will probably go for medium or medium-well which should equate to medium-rare.

App was spicy lobster which was a lightly fried lobster tossed in  spicy  cream sauce served with a tangy cucumber salad. $17.00. It was just OK.  I had a house salad iceberg, baby arugula, grape tomatoes, garlic croutons, red onion  with balsamic. $8.50 I order there Halibut special they did not have Halibut but had substituted sea bass $40.00. The Sea Bass was cooked perfect light flaky. Fresh tomato on the bottom Sea bass topped with crab and lobster meat this was great. My friend order a cowboy rib-eye $53.00 rare with sauteed onions. It came medium rare the onions where over salted server addressed and fixed this in less then ten minutes. My other friend had harvest salad an petite fillet $40.00 it was cooked medium rare which is how she ordered it. We choose the sweet potato casserole pecan crust  this is like a dessert its good.  Potatoes Au gratin Idaho sliced potatoes with a three cheese sauce this was a much better side great flavors. Chef was nice to send out dessert bread pudding it was delicious.From beginning to end it was a good dinning experience and great prices.

The ambiance was nice for a steakhouse and was on point with other fine steakhouses. 

Our main complaints came from the service. We had 2 waiters and a water girl. We were there for a celebration so 2 bottles of champagne were ordered and unfortunately our main waiter tried to pour them over us at the table and managed to spill a decent amount on the table. No other drink orders were ever offered, besides the glass of water everyone gets. We didn't notice at the time because we were having a good group conversation so straight to the steaks.  Our 2 waiters were stuffy and didn't seem very interested in doing a good job. I assume it's because a large group already includes gratuity but it may be incompetence. My steak came out medium when ordered medium rare but was still delicious. Sadly the most inexperienced of the servers, the water girl, was by far the best and most attentive to us throughout the meal. 

The pre-steak bread and butter was plain and unimpressive. The sweet potato casserole was excellent, and the only side worth eating of the four we ordered. 

With so many viable steak options in Vegas I wouldn't eat here. 4 or 5 star prices require 4 or 5 star service and we ended up getting 1 to 2 star service from our main 2 waiters.",87FqAhPPCGWO1b0TUSTcZQ,0,0,2,KHJ-3Eaujb1RGxadQORYOg

We went for our anniversary to celebrate and see what all the buzz is about. We only liked the view and the dessert. But honestly, you really do go for the steak! We were gravely disappointed. Our waiter was very nice but it's the steak that ruined it for us! First of all, everything is a la carte. We ordered 2 filets with a side of lobster Mac and cheese. My husband's filet was over done for medium rare and both steaks were bland! They did warn us that it only comes with butter and salt and pepper (encouraging guests to spend even more on toppings!) As if $60+ is not enough for one tasty filet? The steaks were charred and dry on the outside. Hence the melted butter! Honestly my husband said my filets seared on a hot iron skillet with appropriate seasonings are way better! I cook all our food myself and we rarely eat out. We rarely eat red meat as it IS a culprit of bad health. I was sad to know I cannot even take them to my dogs as we stayed in a hotel with no fridge. :( We couldn't finish our steaks and it was a huge waste of money. Not to mention, Harrah's made it hospitable with raw sewage smell as we exited the hotel the restaurant was located in.

My filet was the best I've ever had (and I've had a few in my day!)  The ribeye was such a disappointment.  fatty, and just not very good.  Our waitress asked how our dinners were, and we told her.

354389,2016-11-28,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"BEWARE!!!!!!!My husband and I  made dinner reservations at this particular Ruth's Chris to enjoy the Thanksgiving Prix Fixe Menu. Our first issue was the price, we have a tradition of traveling Thanksgiving week and we have dined at Ruth's Chris in various states and cities over the years. Over time the holiday meal price has changed varying from $36.95 to $39.95. However, never in our 6 years of this tradition have we ever paid $66 for our Thanksgiving Prix Fixe Dinner. Our server stated the charge was due to the fact this particular location is inside of the Harrah's Casino. It was Thanksgiving night and our anniversary so my wife and I went ahead ordered the meal since she really wanted Turkey. Second issue is when the food arrived, I immediately noticed that the meal looked vastly different to all the others we have had in the past. First the stuffing did not have sausage in it, in fact, it appeared to be plain toasted French bread slathered in cheap canned gravy. I tried to make the best of this $66 meal however, once I tried to put my fork into the stuffing, I discovered a rather large chunk of just plain dry bread. We immediately alerted our server who promptly apologized and offered to replace the meal. I declined with tears in my eyes stating its ok I am no longer hungry. At this point, I pretty much felt like dinner was ruined. When I told the server I cant believe Ruth's Chris would serve something like this and how the Thanksgiving meal has never been this bad at any of the other locations. Our server admitted the Thanksgiving meal had been prepared downstairs by the Harrah's cooks who work in their buffet kitchen and then brought upstairs to Ruth's. I was so upset to know that we had been duped into believing we were eating Ruth's quality dinner (especially for the price) only to find that it was the same meal being served in the Buffet. Of course I confirmed that the stuffing and mashed potatoes were all in fact the exact same. Our server was able to remove my meal from the bill however, seeing as how my husband ate his so we still had to pay $66, in my mind we still paid a hefty price to have cafeteria style dinner for one. My concern is if Ruth's allows for franchise purchasing they need to add specific guidelines to ensure the quality of the food being served under their namesake.",Ts73miAb3Cr38uWJU0BmaA,0,0,1,mBNOzagPYJY6ZH4DdzSYyQ

Why they ever put their old restaurants in such horrible places with no business before beats me.  The new restaurant is hug and you take an elevator to get there, fancy huh.  There are  plenty of tables right next to the window, and even if you are not sitting directly by a window there are great views from all spots in the restaurant.  

Since this place is so new the staff were EXTREMELY friendly so that people would say nice things.  Good job because it worked.  They brought the coolest light-up comment card holder to the table at the beginning.  The waiter knows the name of the host and calls you by your last name, which a lot of nice places do on the strip; very nice touch.  

As for the food, I had the filet which was amazing, you cannot go wrong with this choice.  It is a very generous size filet also, you will not go hungry with some small, tiny over priced steak, you get what you pay for here and its amazing.  I also had the lobster bisque which was alright, but there are plenty of great appetizers to choose from here.  I will upload some pictures later.  Also if your going to get desert get the cheesecake, it will blow any you have had before out of the water!

This was my girlfriend's first trip to Las Vegas and exposing her to the excellence that I have come to know here was paramount. I knew i could count on Caesar.

We were seated but before we ordered dinner the waiter advised us that he was being let go for the evening and that someone else would be taking care of us.  From that point forward, we rarely saw any wait or service staff.  Given that the restaurant was so empty there were no service people nearby.  We would have purchased more drinks if we had only been waited on properly.  The food that we got was very good. The timing on the food was off however.  Salads were barely served before the main entrees were delivered.  Drinks had to be asked for several times before they were delivered.  We were told that this particular location doesn't have the shoestring fries because the restaurant is too big and they would get cold before they were delivered to the table; in reality we know now that the fries would get cold because the service was so bad.",RDMFMLPf8FGb9xBRSC21LQ,1,0,2,d4UUxyshMtNy1BKIWjDp7w

Nothing can ruin a very expensive meal faster than an incorrectly cooked steak.  It just seems so demoralizing after waiting all day to get that juicy taste of Medium Rare Goodness to then bite into a worn leather tough steak.  BOTH of our medium rare steaks came out this way.  Given that we had a show to catch and didn't want to have to wait longer than we already had, we didn't ask them to correct it (which I am sure they would have).

We decided to come here because the GF used to love going to the old closed-down location in town.  The steak was always cooked perfectly with great flavor, the service was impeccable, and the experience wonderful.  This location missed on all counts.  I really did get the sense they were trying, but it just didn't work.  And we really wanted it to work.  The steak was very tough, it seemed maybe even more than just from the overcooking.  The service was both slow and rushed over the course of the same meal.  Forking over this much cash for a meal that was in no way enjoyable for either of us was just painful, especially when you are treating your love to a meal that is supposed to be special.  When we should have been celebrating our special occasion with joy, I found myself apologizing over and over again for surprising her with the new Ruth's Chris (she didn't know they had opened this location).  We are really hoping that they just weren't on their game, and that they will get back on to par with the levels of the old location.  But until we hear from multiple people that they have turned the corner and gotten everything running smoothly, sadly we won't be returning.

I was with my friends and my boyfriend just last sunday to eat dinner and we were assigned to this server named Jessica. At first, she was still okay getting our orders until the time that she asked me what i want. Now since my boyfriend and i will be sharing a big streak, i ordered a calamari and she asked me, ""is this your meal?"". WHAT THE HECK! Why would she ask me if that was my meal? That isnt right. Who cares what i wanna order! So i just let it go. My friend ordered a three course meal. The soup came and then the steak. And then she stopped serving us. The mashed potato which should be with the steak never came until we got the attention of another server and this other server got it for us. Jessica never even bothered to check on us if we are ok. As far as i can remember, if you are a server, you need to ask if everything is okay. Now come on! This is an expensive place! We have to pay our money's worth by having a nice meal with a good service. And still, we kept our cool. We looked around for Jessica and she was only serving like 2 tables and it wasnt even a busy night. I called her to ask for another bread. Guess what? It never came. And then the dessert which should be included with the three course meal? NEVER CAME. So we decided to just pay and ask her for our bill. We called her for it and waited and waited... NEVER CAME. This is really a bad service among all the restaurants that i have dined. And this server is not really happy with her job. We have no choice but to talk to the manager. My friend talked to the manager...(too bad, i forgot his name) but he was really nice to us. He kept on apologizing and even gave us a discount and had our dessert as ""to go"". 

The food was not something to really rave about. But the mashed potatoes were really good. The steak was tender and good as well. The only complaint i had was the bad server named Jessica so if any of you want to eat at this place in Vegas, please ask for another server if they will give you Jessica.

The steaks are fantastic as everything else is too, even the bread is good to eat while waiting for your meal.

All sides are separate but generous enough for you to share. There is a good view of Caesar's Palace and the lights of the strip. It was a good evening till the check arrived. I tried to use two $25.00 gift cards from ""Ruth Chris"". The waiter said he took off $25.00 but the second card had no money on it which was kind of embarrassing for me. I think they believed since we were tourists we would just throw the card away. When we got home I made some calls and found out the card was used on the date we ate there and the location. I called the restaurant and explained what had happened and what I had discovered. A few days later the assistant manager called and got my e-mail address to conclude what he found. He confirmed the card was cashed in at his restaurant but no credit given to me. He agreed to give us our $25.00 that was stolen and $10.00 for our trouble and left it at that. This was no mistake, the waiter stole $25.00 from us, He ran the card took the money and told us it was no good.

You figured out the perfect business model: Dare to charge opulent prices for an 'exclusive experience' and everyone's gotta have it. Hell, I did. I wanted that exclusive 500 degree sizzling plate people 'ooh and ahh' over. Gotta be honest. I remember more about burning my thumb on that plate than I do the steak. My $59 hockey-puck-sized petite filet was in fact, perfectly cooked and bursted of buttery carniverous delight. So you won there, Ruth. Oddly, the flavor I remember most is the nuked rubbery seaweed flavored shrimp resting atop such a beautiful cut of roast beast. The salad and sides were good, but not memorable. Same w the creme brulee.

Unfortunately, I can't find a true hero in the Ruth's Chris experience. There's nothing I can say about this place, be it the vibe, service or food that justify the price. Especially since you can, (with a quick Google-search and some tenacity), learn how to make a steak surpisingly comparable to Ruths for 1/2 the cost. If you know this, you walk away feeling a bit duped, even a little angry. 

The server's had sold me on the fact that the beef we were about to eat is the top 3% in America. In all fairness to Ruth, there's simply no way to give the time and attention required to make every steak great and pump them all out in a night. Ruth knows you don't understand this. Thats why they've got you in their restaurant. The guy sitting next to me got the most expensive cut on the menu (the $100 cowboy ribeye) and offered me a bite (It damn near burned my mouth it was so hot.) The number 1 food crime in America is not letting your steak rest before served. How could u do this to a man who just paid $100 bucks for a slice of cow? And I hate saying this but it tasted so damn....average. Not even half as good as the $27 ribeye I got at Pappy's way out in the desert.

This was the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant.  This includes such gems as Taco Bell,  Waffle House, Roberto's (for the late night burrito eaters) McDonald's...this beats them all. Worst meal ever. I feel like Ruth's Chris should win an award for being in such austere company as fast food/drinking food giants. 

The evening boded well when we (my father and I) got off the elevator and were led to our table. We had a lovely two top in front of a large picture window that overlooked the Quad and Carnival Court.  Normally this view would be terrible due to the predominance of drunken fools littering the landscape but it was nice because it was dark outside.  Our server was friendly, yet slightly pretentious. 

To start, I ordered a Caesar salad and my dad got a lettuce wedge. You know it's a bad Caesar when the very best thing was the shaved cheese on top. It is very hard to mess up shaved cheese. The Caesar salad itself tasted like something you could get at a TGI Fridays restaurant.  Too much dressing, soggy lettuce. As for  the lettuce wedge, Iceberg lettuce is a funny thing.  When it is served cold, it is crisp and refreshing. Unfortunately my father's iceberg lettuce wedge was served lukewarm and limp.  

For our meals I ordered seabass with crabmeat and lobster. My father ordered the roasted chicken.

The sea bass was obviously frozen and heated under a broiler.  The edges had freezer burn and the inside was still cold. The ""crab and lobster"" was the crap that comes out of a can that gets mixed with bread crumbs in order to make stuffed mushrooms.  Mmmmm...stuffed mushrooms.  I like them. With real crab. None of that in sight on my plate.  The whole monstrosity was smothered in lousy Knorr-like Hollandaise sauce.  This inedible mess was $42. $42 for undercooked frozen fish sticks covered in sauce.    Las Vegas is a city where fresh seafood is flown in every single day.  There is no excuse for this dish.

The roasted chicken showed up at the table and the first question my dear old dad asked our server was about the Orange Glob seeping out the middle of the chicken.  Fungal disease?  Unicorn poo? What in the name of all that is holy was wrong with that poor chicken? Nothing!  They had stuffed it with cheese sauce!  Cheese Whiz sauce is more like it.  Everybody knows that cheese and chicken are perfect food partners.  Like bacon and butterscotch, pancakes and ketchup, chocolate and orange juice.  If you haven't tried them you don't know what you're missing. He tried scraping the sauce off to no avail.  He gave up after a couple of bites.

We plan our annual visit to the National Finals Rodeo with the idea of eating at Ruth's Cris one of the nights we are there.  It's a big deal for us.  But not for them.  We had reservations and were truly looking forward to our dining experience. We knew that our bill was going to run well over $400.00, because there would have been three of us, and we were going to splurge.  But we couldn't.  The reason for this is - is that Ruth's Cris called our cell phone and told us it was their ""Slow season"" and if we wanted to change our reservation to an hour earlier, they would book us, otherwise, they were cancelling our reservation.  I told the person that we had come a very long way, had waited a very long time to visit their dining establishment and that the rodeo didn't get over until 9:00pm and we would rush to get there. That's when she told me it was their ""slow season"" and hung up. 
There is a Ruth's Cris Steakhouse in Minneapolis, where our daughter lives, it is wonderful.  We will go there. As it was, we went to Lawry's (which was outstanding) and they were more than happy to feed us.  The next night we dined at The Homestead Steakhouse in Caesars Palace.  It was amazing, we recommend the Wedge Salad with the best Ranch Dressing ever and the Rib-eye steak.  They were happy to feed us, too.",T-GLNO77AKzUPpI1hxW-hw,0,0,1,KAsCxEhRM_D9lhDKqB2d9A

My recommendation to anyone reading this review is to goto craft steak house in the MGM.  If it wasn't for us being in Harrah and it being a little late for dinner we would not have gone - but I figured ""it's Ruth Chris"" so I knew it would be at the very least a good meal.

This review will be rather short as the bartenders are very generous with their pours here, making the remainder of my evening a little blurry.  My boy ordered a Balvenie Doublewood on the rocks and was basically given a pint for the same price.  With all the generosity, I'm sure we were the loudest and happiest couple in the entire restaurant.  Or maybe the most annoying, whatevs.  Haters gonna hate.

The restaurant is all windows and has a killer strip view.  The bar wasn't overcrowded or too loud and has a nice booth area to hang out in while waiting to be seated.  Starting with the hostess to the server (Tina) - everything service wise was excellent.  The steaks are magically delicious and cooked to perfection.  It's like they douse their steak in butter.. hence magically delicious.  You have to appreciate a steakhouse that knows EXACTLY what medium rare should look like.

We made our reservations the same day for eight and we did not have any problems getting a table. We showed up at our reserved time and was seated a few minutes later. The restaurant is really nice, dimly lit and looks out over the strip. 

I ordered (as did most of my party) the three course special. I want to say it was $69 for what I got, which was lobster bisque as a starter, the 8oz filet as the entree with sweet potato casserole as the side, and the chocolate sin cake as dessert. You have a choice for appetizer, entree, and side, but not dessert.

We got some complimentary bread with butter at first. With the appetizer, those of us of drinking age shared a bottle of delicious white wine. The lobster bisque was very good, and pretty filling. Next the steak and the side came out (note about the sides: they are big enough to share with another person, and are not included with the entree - with the three course special a choice of side is included), along with a bottle of red wine that we had ordered, at the waiter's recommendation. The plates are very, very hot. Of course, one of the kids with us immediately grabbed both sides of her plate to move it over, and burnt herself. She was fine, but upset and one of the waiters came over with ice and joked around with her a little. Nice touch! The steak was very good, and I am not a big meat person. The sweet potato casserole was way too sweet as a side, and I would recommend the mashed potatoes instead which my brother got. Too big of a side for one too. The kids with us are huge eaters, and one actually finished their steak which I couldn't do! The waiter was delighted.

It was my opinion, as well as my family's, that having the chocolate sin cake for dessert was too much. The meal itself was very filling, and it would have been much more fitting to serve a sorbet or something else light at the end. As it was, I ended up so full I felt sick.

Everything was delicious, but portions could be scaled down for the three course special as it was way too much food. Our main waiter was fantastic, and incredibly polite. We all enjoyed our meal and the experience.",sKSpFS7Kx66dVYStAzdGmw,10,8,4,mbWpTsg3rFzL3X_n9ZeCCQ

1652477,2017-01-12,11,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"First off, I have to say that I'm not the kind of person who gets caught up in the yelp hype of a particular restaurant simply because there are some positive reviews posted. In addition, I walked into Ruth Chris Steak House with a bit of trepidation because many of the local Las Vegas yelpers I follow hadn't posted reviews of this dining establishment. Many of the reviews were from visitors or tourists who may not know the ins and outs of Las Vegas steak houses.  Just the same, I had high expectations for this restaurant, in part because I knew I was about to plunk down over $200 for a dinner for two. I'm sad to say, those expectations weren't realized. 

The following is my score card for Ruth Chris Steak House: 

Hostess/Front Counter service 

4 out 5 stars. They greeted us with a smile and smartly took time to make small talk as were escorted to our table.

Ambiance

4 out of 5 stars. For most tables, you have an elevated view of the bright lights of the strip (or at least part of it). The table settings and overall decor were as expected.

Waiter service 

3 out of 5 stars. Our waiter, Dean, was relatively cordial and efficient for what he did. He got down to business and took our order relatively quickly. For some reason, he skipped engaging us with small talk or making any personal connection, and his check-ins with us were few and far between (at a time when the restaurant wasn't busy). Food was brought out by a server, so Dean earned a nice sized tip simply for taking our order and dropping off the check. 

Food

3 out of 5 stars. We both ordered filet mignon, salad and a number of side orders, which are easily large enough to share. At the very least, I was expecting an impressive steak, but Ruth Chris didn't deliver.  My steak was merely average.  

Hot plate situation 

Both the waiter and server made a number of cautionary announcements about their entrees being served piping hot 500 degree plates. So much so, I got a little concerned for my personal safety. Put your hand on the plate without oven mitts and you'll could end up in a burn unit. Yikes. I hate Mexican food served in this fashion, and serving steak this way didn't make it any better. 

Something you might factor into your steak order is if you want your steak cooked medium, and (when served) you take time for a couple of yelp photos, a yelp check-in and chit chat with your company, your steak (sitting on 500 degree plate) might just end up sizzling itself up to medium well. I'm just saying its possible, especially when you consider you can fry an egg on the pavement at about 150 degrees.  

I might give Ruth Chris one more try, but only after I've run through a number of other Las Vegas steakhouses.",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,18,14,3,VwcX4IU30iFFevavl-Htbw

1837276,2015-08-25,7,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"My eyes sparkled at the sight of a deliciously juicy steak on a sizzling buttery hot plate. My heart beat raced and I felt elated being in a steak house ready to feast. And then a group of 4 girls dubbed ""the hostesses"" got between me and my juicy meaty love and brought me to a screeching halt. 

Wait what? 

I don't know what it is with their high school drama, but one of them checked our reservation and asked another one to take us to our table. The other one frowns and says, ""No I took the last one."" The others diverted their gaze, like clueless students not wanting to be picked by the professor. Silence fell upon us. Awkward, with a capital A. A few minutes passes as the 4 went on with their drama.  Finally, one of them grew up and took the menus and took us to our table.  I watched them in amusement but one more minute away from my juicy steak and I am ready to kick butt. Professionalism should tell you, don't pull that in front of the customers. But the rest of the experience was as smooth as steak knife through butter.  

And now to the food: 

Spicy Lobster- Succulent pieces of lobster, lightly fried, tossed in a spicy cream
sauce. Delicious! The perfect balance of tender lobster, a nice crisp exterior, and a great sauce with just the right hint of spicy. The cucumber salad that came with it wasn't all too impressive. I would've liked a more crispy bite for the cucumbers and less of that a stale and vinegar taste. 

Ribeye- Came sizzling on a hot plate and drenched in butter. Juicy, melts in your mouth, with a delicious buttery taste. Nice marbling. Cooked perfectly. I had the medium and it was cooked evenly and with just the right hint of pink. This is why I love Ruth's Chris. So good. The only con is that it is also incredibly heavy. I already started feeling full after a few bites. But it's soooo good so I kept going for the sake of my mouth.

Potatoes Au Gratin- sliced potatoes with a three cheese sauce. This one wasn't too memorable and rather mediocre. I don't know what it is with amazing steak houses and mediocre side dishes. I had a similar experience with another steak house of similar caliber. 

Chocolate Explosion- chocolate molten cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Pretty good and a nice way to end a meal.   

My last dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse was in Pasadena, California. This being my first time visit to the one in Las Vegas, I didn't know what to expect. The first impression made by the hostesses wasn't all too promising. Luckily, the rest of the experience made up for it and was exactly the same. Our servers were extremely friendly and constantly checked our table to make sure everything is perfect. Amazing service.

They failed to take a group or offer to take a group pic when 4 people in the group had birthdays , and only 3 birthday cakes were served.

Cowboy Ribeye - perfect medium rare, melts in your mouth

Calamari - Not the best i've had, but decent

Veal Osso Buco Ravioli - really light, good subtle flavor

Arrived with no reservations and grabbed a table in the bar area to eat.  That usually works well in the other Ruth's Chris, plus it's a good spot to people-watch.

Our waiter was friendly and settled us in with menus.  We ordered sparklling water and a glass of red wine.............and waited.

After about three apologies for the slowness in the wine arriving it came - mid-way through the salads.  Hmmm.

Dinner arrived, and as always, the steaks were a shining spot of happiness.  Perfectly cooked, sizzling plates, tender, yummy.  Blissfull.  Oh yes, the Cesar salad and potatoes were also perfect.

We never saw our waiter again.  Ever.  My wine was way long gone, something that would NEVER have happened at the other locations.  He didn't come back to check if everything was ok, if we wanted to order dessert.  Nada.  We had just been abandoned.

The GM was very kind and apologetic, but by then, we just wanted a check and to head out.  And then it took another 15 minutes to get the check.

So why the four stars?  Because Ruth's Chris is a fabulous place to eat.  The food is exceptional and worth the cost for a special occasion or if you just want a good chunk of perfect cow.  As soon as they work the bumps out from being in a new location, it will be killer.  But seriously, maybe wait a few weeks to let that all happen.",DvyGXJYn4A9ReUFi9z5dyw,5,0,4,SOamO8oTLjs_YQ5_u8nNWA

I am not snotty person by any means but when you walk by people with orange hair, women covered with tattoos from head-to-toes in a see-through dress, a skin-head with tattoos all over his face, etc., you have to wonder why this restaurant is here. After walking through the entire casino, you take a small elevator up to the 2nd floor to find yourself in the restaurant. Weird!

Having said that, the restaurant is wonderful. The view from our table was of Las Vegas Blvd. The service was decent. Our waiter was a 50-ish YO guy who was a bit impersonal but polite.

Overall, this experience was on-par with other locations. The food is consistent.

We had some type of banana pudding desert and it wasn't one of the best we have had at a Ruth's Chris. We sat by a window and had a great view of the strip. The service was a bit slow and our server was less than attentive (refills were slow, etc.) but we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a huge deal. One of the biggest disappointments, at least to me: the soup of the day was some type of a seafood soup as was the regular menu soup. I would have preferred to see an alternative to a seafood soup offered, just a personal thought.

The restaurant is located in Harrah's and it was a bit difficult for us to find. You have to take an elevator that is in the middle of the Harrah's casino. If you follow the signs, you will be fine.

The problem is Las Vegas - the often weirdly friendly or edgy labor pool and the design and planning for imports to a city where less is never heard of, and more is more. When the dessert came, a spoon larger than any soup spoon I'd ever seen accompanied it. I mentioned it to the people I was chatting with as well as the bar server. ""Well, I've been here for three years and nobody has ever complained about the spoon."" Okay, I expressed myself clearly to indicate that I was not pleased. To show how off-base the whole scene was, later the server/bar guy and a cohort returned with tiniest spoon in the house. Very funny - they thought!! I guess it was a spoon for cocktail sauce.

However, our two dining experiences at this Ruth's Chris have been disappointing. The service was fine in both cases, but the food wasn't. Both times, my steak came out incorrectly prepared. I know that a medium rare steak has a 'cool red center' .... not a squishy purple / red center. The last time we were there -- on New Year's Eve -- my husband's steak was properly prepared. Mine was squishy and purple inside. I sent it back and they then cooked it to medium well. So they then prepared a new one and it came out with gristle in several spots. Not what you expect for the price. But by then, my husband was almost done with his meal and I didn't want to send it back again so I just ate it. They did make the changes graciously but given the experience and the fact that it was New Year's Eve, I think it would have been appropriate to offer something else, whether a desert or to comp drinks or something.

2569636,2013-06-13,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.

Let me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.

I ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.

We both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.

And what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.

The sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.

As for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.

In summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.

Lastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left.",8q_hQwTR-v-xRt35sexavA,0,0,2,2_LDrp6OkVoKq7y1TendSg

If you ever get lost or have no idea where to find the elevators that would take you up to Ruth Chris, don't hesitate to ask an employee. Parked his car in valet because it was quick and convenient. 

This place isn't cheap....the two of us ran the bill to about $200.00. But of course, appetizers, soup and salad and wine were ordered as well as our entrees + side dishes.
I ordered the lobster bisque soup while my date ordered a wedge salad.

LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP: My soup was delicious. Although...I think they used a mushroom based broth (if that makes any sense) because I don't like mushrooms and I can recognize that distinct mushroom taste. And it was certainly in my soup. Yucky but it wasn't unbearable.

PETITE FILET MIGNON: The petite is 8 oz. and the larger size is 11 oz. My date and I both ordered the 8 oz. and it was PERFECT sized. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!! The flavoring and seasoning they cooked their steaks with were perfect! Even though I ordered my filet (and any steaks) WELL DONE...it wasn't dried at all. Each bite completely melts in my mouth. You can tell the quality here is ON POINT.

NOTE: Your steaks and any other entrees do not come with any other side dishes. So if you want mashed potatoes or veggies....you gotta order it. Each dish is more than enough to share between two grown adults.

POTATOES AU GRATIN: I'm a sucker for all potatoes. So potatoes with cheese melted on top? UMMM....THIS is like an orgasm in my mouth!!!! Amazing side dish! Must order if you're in love with potatoes like me.

SAUTEED SPINACH WITH GARLIC: Don't be afraid of the garlic...there was only a small hint of the taste. Definitely not strong enough to leave any garlic breath.

Service was great the entire night. They were attentive to our drinks and kept checking back on us throughout the night to see how everything is going. The dessert menu was offered at the end of our meals but we were just too full. He recommended the banana cream pie? Sooo....perhaps you can give that a try?  

Also, this is a fancy restaurant. My date and I were dressed to the nines but I did see a couple people in very casual attire. Come on guys. Please dress the part.

They didn't have everything because they were still waiting for approval. 
I had crab legs and bone in filet medium rare. 
The crab kegs were soft and not too tasty. I didn't enjoy them at all. 
The filet came out well done at the first cuts. When I told them I only eat it medium rare, they told me to cut close to the bone, it should be medium rare there. What?? So I throw away 75% of the $67 steak to get what I want. They finally took it, but then brought back a steak rare. Since I don't live here, I couldn't get it to go to cook more at home. They then told me to jet it rest longer so it would cook more. Really?!?
It was tender, but little flavor. 
The chopped salad was as amazing as ever, but the bakes potato was cold with no little sides for such a big potato. 
Someone had the $90 lobster. It was tough, and not worth $90.

My order was the Cowboy Ribeye Steak w/ blue cheese crumbles. Now let me start by saying I am a true steak person and I know an excellent steak when I get one. I was very underwhelmed with this $61 steak because the taste was so bland and there was a ton of fat on this cut! I have had steaks extremely better at like 35 Steaks & Martinis or even Delmonico or something! I had to ask myself how is it that they nailed the Salmon dish but completely missed the steak!? A dish that they are supposedly specializing in? By far the worst I've had! No $61 steak should just be average! I had to keep in good spirits because of my cousins birthday but lastly how about this terrible quadruple chocolate cake they give out on birthdays? It's WAY too much chocolate matter of the fact I don't even think it's cake! It's basically a fudge bar! In summary I pretty much wasted $200 on an average ass meal! I'll never return!

The Good:

Delicious sweet potato casserole with pecan crust.  They split our orders onto separate plates. We mentioned it was our anniversary and they gave us a chocolate cake.


The Bad:

Tough steak... dry. Not worth the price!

Staff felt like they were ""trying"" but the true feel of ""fine dining"" was not there. The staff may have been trained, but they just couldn't get the little touches to complete the fine part of fine dining. For example:
 - the staff would get into the way while they attempt to pour water. 
 - Staff would interrupt the conversation to ask their question. I was going to finish my sentence before letting the staff ask their question, but she rudely interrupted. 
 - We had to ask wait staff to find our waiter to get our check
 - They never cleaned the table throughout the appetizers, salad, entrees, etc.
 - The items above were all things that the staff in San Diego's Ruth's Chris was very good at. I read a review saying the old business at this Las Vegas location was another steakhouse but Ruth's Chris now has a majority of the staff from that location. If the old staff was not truly capable of ""fine dining"", this Ruth's Chris staff will only bring down the experience of what this restaurant could bring. (Perhap's Ruth's Chris has a contract with Harrah's to use existing staff. . . either way, not a good wait staff for this type of restaurant.)

Cowboy ribeye at San Diego's Ruth's Chris, is my all time favorite. I've had it 4-6 times. This Las Vegas location, seemed like they sourced their steak meat from the buffet. Perhaps Harrah's has a vendor they go through for all the food of all the restaurants inside their property, which would limited Ruth's Chris quality.",pA0Ke_97Qn8ROyZbEMtVWg,1,1,1,oh5NmlVaCBNCRP8ouS0Jjg
3162077,2015-09-01,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"Food was delicious as always. Had the usual baroque shrimp. Absolutely creamy deliciousness. Stuffed mushrooms always one of my favorites. Maybe not for others though, they tend to be on the mushy side and very garlicky. 

For the dinner wine we had the Robert Mondavi 2012 red Cabernet. Ordered the rib eye and the bone in rib eye, both rare. Both delectable in their own individual ways. For me I personally prefer the rib eye. Our bone in rib eye was over cooked to medium rare. The rib eye for some reason tastes more tender. I have had both many times at other Ruth Chris locations and had the same result. For the sides we got the lobster mac and cheese and the cream spinach. I always order the creamed spinach, it is my favorite side. The lobster mac and cheese was a first for me. I would not order it again. The green peppers were overpowering and the Mac and cheese was not that tasty unfortunately. 

For dessert we ordered the berries and sweet cream sauce and the cheesecake. Both my favorite for different reasons. The cream sauce is to die for. So delicious. The cheesecake is very rich and cheesy. The only thing I would say is that ordering the two together is not recommended since the sweet cream sauce is so sweet takes away from cheesecake. 

Our server, Darcel was probably the most disappointing aspect of the night. She seemed very rushed and most of the time was loud, but inaudible. When I asked her to decant the wine she looked at me weird and did not want to. She would disappear on us for 10 minutes intervals and we had to ask other servers to get things and help with the check.

Mushroom - butter soup. I think that sums it up. 

Calamari - great flavor, but I wish I had known that it was in a glaze. It almost tasted like a sweet & sour calamari. Perhaps the menu said something about the glaze, but I didn't fully read it. I probably should have. 

Garlic mashed potatoes - very buttery. Can't say it was super delicious.

3627645,2013-09-23,2,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"Ruth's Chris Steak House is visually fantastic.  The ambiance is relaxing, yet the decor adds a bit of a sophisticated touch. The windows that line the side of the restaurant provide a great view, especially in the evening.  With that said, when you sit down in this steak house, your expectations are already high.

We had an extremely large group of people.  Roughly 50+ people were there who are a part of our Sales Organization.  With this in mind, we had a limited menu which was no problem at all.  They did a great job of taking care of each person.  They had about 6 or 7 waiters who took care of us.  I think the longest my wine glass went empty was for 5 minutes...impressive when you think about how many people we rolled in with. 

Soooo why the 2 star rating? Because the steak I ordered was horrible.  I know I could be a touch more gracious here, but no joke....it was not good.  The cut was fine, it was thick, tender, it looked like heaven.  However....this is the part that gets me.  Butter.  Yes I just said....Butter.  My steak was floating in a plate of....Butter.  Is it just me? Perhaps this is some new fancy thing that's beyond my palate, but DO NOT EVER soak my steak in melted butter.  What I didn't care for was that the buttery taste took over the whole steak.  As I said previously, expectations were already set when I first walked in.  I was expecting a stellar steak, which didn't happen this time.  Also, there wasn't any type of indication that it was going to be prepared that way, if so...I would've opted for one of the other selections we had to choose from.  The sides were good, bread....mashed taters and of course wine were all spot on.

I could probably be a little more forgiving, but for me ambiance and decor don't get the lion share of the ratings.  I would eat dinner in a box on the street and give it 5 stars if the food was spectacular, probably note in the review that the box was a little small......but none the less, I would still drop 5 stars if it was fantastic.",InxaL8hCQrs6XmLtbkcjSA,3,3,2,Af8ojKNCVNy_tl3i4un7Vg

3907003,2015-06-22,1,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"By far the best steak house that's ever come to light.  Especially with the long awaited return to Las Vegas inside of Harrah's Casino.  My first experience with Ruth Chris was in Los Angeles on a birthday weekend three years ago.  I thought I just happen to find a really nice steak house, but everywhere else I have ever compared it to have come nothing but too short.  The location here in Las Vegas delivered exactly the same consistency I remembered!

I always order the three course meal for $69, which includes an 8oz filet, a side dish, house salad or lobster bisque, and of course a dessert of pure chocolate that takes you into a fantasy island.  I've had other meals and all are seasoned with the most flavorful seasonings a man can only dream of.  If it wasn't for the price, I'd probably be at Ruth Chris every single day.  Well worth the prices though.  The real review aside from the other items on there menu is for the steaks.  They must slow cook them for two days, because I can't figure out how they get that tender on the steak.  When it came to my table my plate was probably still 200 degrees it was that hot!  The savory taste of the melted butter on top warranted no additional seasoning required.

If you're looking for the best steak in the world and want an evening of romance and fun, look no further.  You'll die and wake up in steak heaven.  Bravo!!!",u90s9wJ9pMK2FMpy5F8Wpg,3,2,5,eH4bbVU8QqoQdn7p3El0ig

3919406,2017-08-14,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"Ok, I do not usually do expensive steak houses, but this was my first trip to Las Vegas, and I wanted one really memorable meal if I won any money there.  So after battling the slot machines for about 5 hours, I finally hit a small jackpot and said to myself ""time to celebrate with a good meal.""   Since the restaurant was right near the casino, I decided to treat myself.

Walking in the door of this place....and the aroma of grilled meat takes over.  Yeah, thank god for cows. 

I like New York Strip Steaks, and this one was a nice sized, sizzling steak (yes, you do hear it come to your table, and yes, that plate is hot!).  I also had a loaded baked potato which was the biggest potato I had ever seen.  The steak was a little more done than I wished for, but even so, it was so tender you did not need a knife.  And nicely seasoned, too!  I don't go for sauces.  I want to taste the steak.  This did not disappoint.  But if you want medium, you may be wise to order it medium rare, because my steak did not have any pink in the center.  It may have left the grill that way, but hitting that plate at 500 degrees probably cooked it a bit more.  

My only complaint was the salad.  Or should I say the dressing for the salad.  It was rather salty and had an unusual after taste.  

Oh well....it is a steak house.  A damn good one, too.  But that chicken that just passed me....well maybe the next trip.  It looked real fine.

We ordered crab cakes for an appetizer and they were adequate.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad.  Very small for the price paid.  The real disappointment for me was the main dish.  I ordered the 11 oz filet cooked medium.  It was WAY overcooked.  It was gray all the way through, no pink whatsoever.  It also seemed like it lacked any seasoning at all.  For the first time ever in a steakhouse of that caliber (or price), I had to use salt and pepper to give my filet taste.  The kicker was the $11 mashed potatoes we bought to share.  I assumed they were family style, but it was about 2-3 spoonfuls of potatoes each, and they were also very average.

The final bill was over $200 and I honestly felt the Outback next door would have been better.  Maybe we were just there too early or caught the cook on an off night, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend going.",uzWvpOGz0-r0JPcllPrkAg,0,0,2,8TOBTR9fIlC3B-qk6AXlOA

We had reservations at got seated within a few minutes.  Each person from host, wait staff, and manager were all very nice and professional. We definitely felt as we were attended to. (4.4/5)
The problem and deduction in rating was the food, unfortunately.  We each ordered the filet, medium well, and we ordered two sides to share. The filets came out sizzling hot and looked and smelled so good.  We cut into each and we noticed a huge difference. One was pretty red, and mine was, well, brown.  It was still edible and it is hard for me to send food back to any kitchen (we all know why there is anxiety sending food back.) when our waitress came back around I showed her the difference and she acknowledged that they were not cooked the same. She said it looked like one was underdone and the other a little over cooked. The manager did a round checking on tables as well. I let her know I was enjoying my meal, but did point out the difference.  She was surprised at the difference and offered to correct the mistake. I will admit, I did not ask for a correction.  But when we are paying $210 for two (2 filets, 2 sides total, and three glasses of wine total), it should really come out right the first time.  And since it didn't, a server or manager should try to make it right in another way as it should be known that some guests are not comfortable sending food back.  Maybe comp a slice of cake? Or not charge for one of the filets....just saying. Service was good good, food was blah, issue resolution skills could use some improvement.

Our server told us at the end of our dinner that they were not expecting such a large amount of people dining there that day so they weren't meeting a lot of expectations. However, our party thought everything went very well! If that was a bad night for them, I can't imagine how much more amazing they could be on a regular day!

I ordered the lamb chops (3 THICK pieces of lamb) on a 500 degree sizzling plate. Ugh it was so delicious that my mouth is watering as I am typing. My boyfriend ordered the cowboy bone-in rib eye steak and that was also very tasty. Both of our meats were cooked perfectly medium rare as requested. We shared three sides with our friends which is perfect! If you go with a large party, definitely consider sharing your sides so that you all can try a little bit of everything! 

Calamari: I feel like this appetizer is a must everywhere I go but this one is by far one of the best I've had. Squeeze as much lemon as you want. The more the better IMO!

Lobster mac & cheese: extra cheesy and a piece of lobster in every bite almost.

Sweet potato casserole: I feel like we can do without. It was very sweet that day. I've had it before at another location and I thought it was delicious. However, I regret ordering this one on that day. 

Blackberry sidecar: Very strong but the flavor is still pretty good for how strong it was.

For our friend's birthday, they gave him a slice of cheesecake on the house.

So far, everything has been excellent. The spicy lobster and seared ahi tuna appetizers are two cant-go-wrong selections. 

(And so much for my real time opinion, which may be the ""second"" best compliment I can give. When my steak arrived my primal instincts switched to EAT and my opinion took a back seat.) 

So now here I am several days later and I'm still completely impressed with this meal. I've known about Ruth's Chris for a long time and have heard nothing but great things but honestly because it's a chain, I sort of shrugged it off. I'm just more of a hidden gem kind of guy. Thankfully I ventured out of my box and into the private elevator at Harrah's that leads to the beautiful view belonging to Ruth's Chris. Unfortunately, we didn't get to soak in the view but that was actually fine with me. We showed up with no reservations during a busy March Madness weekend and were able to sit and eat immediately at the bar, which was great (bartenders always make the best servers.) After finishing our appetizers, I had a baked potato, the bone-in New York steak (a.k.a. ""The distraction"") and the banana cream pie. The baked potato was standard but the steak was amazing and big enough to feed two, easy. The banana cream pie, unlike the potato, was far from standard and is a must try for banana cream and non-banana cream fans alike. I'm a huge fan but my brother is not and we both loved it.

Served on a 500 degree plate and came out sizzling.  Porthouse combined the filet and the strip. I preferred the filet but with such a huge piece of meat there was definitely enough to have both!  We started with the crab corn chowder which was fantastic and also had the creamed spinach.  The bread left a lot to be desired which was fine for us being that we didn't want to fill up on bread but was somewhat disappointing.  If you want good bread go to Mon Ami Gabi.

Unfortunately,  the food was not good (or at least mine wasn't). In all fairness,  I didnt have much of an appetite after eating at Harrahs hotel buffet earlier that afternoon,  so I wasn't in the mood for a heavy steak. The waitress suggested the scallops as it was a fairly small portion. My husband who was actually starving ordered the stuffed chicken and thought it was pretty good,  but my scallops arrived and after one bite,  I immediately spit them out because it was extremely SALTY. Our server immediately tried to rectify the situation and offered to make them again or order something else on the menu,  but by this time,  I had already eaten about half the sweet potato casserole and a good portion of the creamed spinach,  both which were delicious by the way,  so I declined and she was gracious enough to take them off the bill.

I ordered the filet, and it was a bit dry--I admit, it was probably cooked the way I ordered it, but it was dry regardless.

He hurt his tooth, and told our waitress when she came by. She informed the manager, who came out to speak to us. My husband showed him the piece of bone, and he offered to prepare him another steak. He declined, since we had a show that night and didn't have time to wait. My husband kept eating it, but he didn't really get to enjoy it, as he was worried about it happening again. When we got the bill, we were a bit disappointed to see there was not even a little bit of discount offered for that. My husband left a note on the back of the receipt, expressing his disappointment, and the manager ended up calling us. He told my husband he had planned to take the price of the steak off the tab but hadn't had a chance to relay that to our waitress.

I give all components of this review 5 stars: Atmosphere, Location, Service, Presentation, and Product! I visit Ruth's Chris when I visit a city, and  now I have one locally, as well. I'm never disappointed by a visit to any location. 
I'll start my review by delineating all components. 
Atmosphere: located in the Harrah's casino second floor via elevator access only. As you step off the elevator, you're immediately greeted by the hostess station and a divine view of Las Vegas Blvd. If your visit is st night, as mine was, you have access to the beautiful glittering lights along the Blvd. My table was located to allow a perfect view of Caesar's Palace. It was stunning. 
Location: centrally located on LVBlvd, in a very fun part of the strip. Lots of casinos and activities are in this area. 
Service: exceptional- everything you expect and then some. 
Presentation: the meal looks as if it's art on a photo shoot. No detail is spared. 
Product: the food was amazing. Packed with flavor, hot, seasoned, saut√©ed and sauced to perfection. Moist and tender where need be, crisp with a crunch as described, melt in your mouth goodness. 

All 5 areas made this dining experience a clear 5 star rating. I love a brand that delivers in all areas.",Cn3pKcYrMX3rOp01eG3WJw,0,0,5,CyXe0tAnJaE90YKc33WmOw

If I didn't have the deal I would not get that much food but everything I had was good. The steak was so tender and flavorful. For my appetizer we got spicy lobster. I don't generally eat lobster but I tried it and I liked it. The spicy sauce was really good on it. Our side was mashed potatoes. One is definitely large enough to share. Also I have to have potatoes when I have steak. The potatoes were thick and not lumpy and garlic and buttery. The dessert was the chocolate explosion. It was good but I was stuffed at this point.

I made a reservation for March 28th at 8:30. My boyfriend was so excited and happy and told the hostesses that it was his Birthday and none of them even said "" Happy Birthday"". Then we were prompted to our table. The table was unstable and was shaking. We didn't say anything. Then it took a while for a bus person to bring us water I would say 15-20 minutes. At that point we haven't even seen our waiter. We finished water, our bread and the waiter still didn't show up. Nobody refilled our water, we even spilled one glass because the table was shaking and nobody even noticed. Then we asked a bus person to call a waiter for us and still nothing. Then we asked a photographer to call a manager. The manager came his name was Anthony he apologized and said he would take care of us. By the way when manager came our waiter showed up after 30 minutes; at that point we told him we didn't need him. So it took them 30 minutes to take our order. And guess what after the manager took our order, the food came out and the order was wrong. And we were for real now? Even the manager can't take an order at such expensive and high-end restaurant? He took our order and it was wrong!!!! If you charge customers high $$$$ please provide a good customer service. And make sure your managers know what they are doing and not just the name ""a manager"". There are plenty fancy restaurants on the strip with tasty food and superb service!!!!! Don't waste your money and time on this steakhouse. Not worth it....

4298022,2014-01-15,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"I love steaks. I love Ruth's Chris. I took my entire team here for a dinner and they were incredibly flexible with me when it came to my reservation. I forgot to call ahead and they managed to squeeze me in within 2 hours of me calling for a group of 7.

What I did like was the level of service that we got, that you normally expect from a Ruth's Chris steakhouse and the overall quality of the steaks and sides. We got plenty of appetizers, including the calamari and seared ahi tuna which were both delicious and then all of us ended up ordering different steaks and I got myself a Filet Mignon. It came out a bit too burnt on the outside and arguably medium-well rather than the medium I had ordered. My normal experience at steakhouses is that they usually undercook from what you order so if you order a steak medium rare it comes out almsot rare and when you order a steak well, it comes out medium well. This way, they never overcook the meat or have to give you a new steak if you're unhappy with the grill. Normally, I would say that I was just being picky, but one of my colleagues ended up actually sending his steak back because he too ordered a medium steak and it ended up coming out medium-well.

The desserts were fantastic and delicious and overall, the meal was very filling and satisfying. No matter that it cost me about $100 a head, we enjoyed ourselves. However, I would like to point out to the restaurant's management that they should consider slightly undercooking, not overcooking their steaks. And that they should re-train some of their waitstaff as our waiter constantly tried upselling us on sparking mineral water throughout the meal. Keep in mind that we had already ordered two bottles and some cocktails.

Also, one of the waitresses that came by ended up pouring a half glass of still water into a glass of sparkling water without asking before pouring. This also may require some retraining of the staff as it wouldn't be a problem if they didn't charge extra for sparking mineral water. Overall, my experience was okay but this location definitely needs work when compared to the Ruth's Chris of San Diego and Del Mar.",bEVUAezrj97yyvXmGqIGcQ,2,1,3,Lf9dYOvZKJM2h2v2AVtQBQ

Maybe 1.5 stars bc the steak was seasoned well. But overcooked. Asked for medium. Came out medium well.

Baked potato had everything on it even though I asked to have everything on the SIDE. And was over done.

Mashed Potatoes were super late. We were more than half way through our meal and asked for it twice b4 receiving it. 

Dessert never came. Mind you we ordered the 3 course meal. Extra bread never came despite asking politely for some. Drinks were not refilled to save her life. 

Asked for check twice and was never brought. She entertained her other guests and made us wait for eternity. Another waitress brought our mashed potatoes. And to top it off we never got an apology. 

I'm not one to complain but this was too much. I hope it was isolated, but don't expect me to dine there ever again even if my diamond member friends invite me. Sorry, but worst service ever. Total rewards? I think not. More like no rewards. MLife for life.

This was in the early 2000s, and I had not eaten there since.  I had been wanting to go back and revisit that same steakhouse to see if it was as good as I remember.  During my most recent visit to Vegas I got to do so, but the steakhouse is now a Ruth's Chris.  I was not too disappointed by the change, as I really liked Ruth's Chris when I dined at the Beverly Hills location.  I looked forward to dining here even more knowing that it was now a Ruth's Chris, and I had only been to one once before.

I tend to keep my orders basic when I go to a higher end steakhouse, and this visit was no exception.  My meal consisted of the filet and sides of the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.  It was all superbly flavorful with great presentation.  The steak was exactly how I wanted it prepared, and the potatoes and spinach were great complements.  The experience was highlighted even further by the attentive service of the excellent staff.

My visit to Ruth's Chris was the most memorable dining experience on my recent trip to Vegas.  It was outstanding from beginning to end with great service, atmosphere, and food.

I loved Ruth's in Pittsburgh, Louisville, and several other locations, but this one is just not up to the expectations Ruth's advertises.

If you are looking for an elegant dinner experience there are 100's in Vegas, this is not one.  

The first indication of an upcoming bad experience, well after entering Harrah's, is there is no enforcement of a dress code.  People had cut off jeans, crop top shirts and flip flops (without the bodies that should be wearing such revealing clothes, I'm talking 200 pound women where the shorts are vacuumed up locations best undescribed).  This wasn't unusual, it was the predominate outfit.  This isn't the pool, but it was the norm when we were there, Monday May 2, 2016.

Pretty good cocktail prices, around $15 for specialty drinks.  4 shrimp (1 order) cocktail, the best part of the meal $22, 11 oz (although it looked larger, more like 14 oz) filet for around $60. Sides were priced at market rate.  The Oscar topping was horrible, canned or old crab meat definitely ruined anything it was served on.   It reminded me of the ""cheese"" sauce you buy in 64 oz cans at Sams. It also, seemed like it accompanied almost everything.  The steaks were cooked to order, good but not spectacular.  I'd rate the experience and food quality as that you'd see in a chain, such as Texas Roadhouse, etc.  Not what you'd expect from ""fine"" dining, or prices in this category.

Server John was very attentive, helpful, and was busy but efficient.

Once our glasses were poured, it was another 20-ish minutes before the server came to check on us again- I ended up pouring my own wine because I didn't want to wait any longer.

My husband (Vegetarian) had the terrific option (sarcasm meter going off) of choosing any 3 sides. Come on RC, a $50/plate restaurant can't keep some pasta noodles in the pantry and throw together a nice veggie and pasta dish? I understand we were at a steak house, but it would have been nice to provide an option other than a bunch of sides disguised as an entree.

My ""medium"" steak came out well done, and the wrong veggies were delivered with my husband's 'entree'.  Fortunately they fixed the error quickly, but given the series of errors, it was beginning to get ridiculous.

Eventually the manager walked by who was very kind and pleasant to speak with.  He seemed genuinely concerned about our satisfaction and apologized for the many errors we endured.

As we waited for our check, our server brought over a piece of chocolate cake with ""Thank you"" written in chocolate, as an apology from the manager.  Now this cake, was probably one of the most amazing desserts I have ever eaten.  Very rich, very decadent, and enough for two of us to easily share- the cake, was the stuff dreams are made of!  I wanted to come back to the restaurant later that evening just to get another piece of that cake (I didn't do it- but the thought genuinely crossed my mind!).  That gesture of good will has changed my mind from a ""will never return"" to a ""we might give RC a second chance after all.""",R1OH2ebX6VoMRbVT-qo7MQ,2,1,2,8iWH4b1bJxITMemdB0fZ4w

I made my reservation directly with Ruth's Chris online system. I told them it was my wedding anniversary and I would love a table with a view.  When we arrived (30 minutes late due to traffic) we were seated at a table with a great view of the strip and our table had rose pedals on it in celebration of our anniversary.

We were quickly greeted by Angie who called us by our last names which was a nice touch.  Her assistant (name started with an A) was EXTREMELY  helpful and VERY funny. We really enjoyed his sense of humor. We split everything except for the steak and we were not made to feel bad about it.

We had...

Cowboy Ribeye
Petit Filet 
Cesar Salad - split and it was enough for two people (ask for anchovies)
Baked potato - split and it was enough for two, my husband just wanted butter but Angie brought the 'loaded part' on the side for me 
Dirty Absolut Martini for me

We were surprised when Angie brought us a cheese cake on a plater that had Happy Anniversary written on it - Free

Our total bill was $179 and with a 20% tip came out to $211

We didn't over eat by getting two many sides and we could not have been more happy with the service that was provided.  The manager came to our table and asked how everything was which was a nice touch.

4842045,2015-03-08,0,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"So I ate here a few nights ago while visiting Vegas and was not disappointed, but I was upset with a few things. I will start by saying that the petite filet was delicious, and it was perfectly done. I paired it with the cheaper Sterling Merlot. I also had a side of sweet potato casserole, since I can never pass up anything with sweet potatoes. 

Here is where I was disappointed:

First, the service was OK. Don't get me wrong, our server and her ""helper"" or assistant, whatever you choose to call it, were very friendly and attentive. However, they were improper. I also work at a high end restaraunt where service is very important. Language at the table can make all the difference in the world. For example, rather than attending to individuals there was yelling across the table and the whole ""what can I get for ya?"" type of service. 

Second, the presentation was absolutely terrible. They serve their steak on a plate by itself bc their plates are 500 degrees when they come out. So your side will actually be on the side, which is fine, but none of it had any type of garnish, and you could tell the rims had not been wiped down after the food was plated.

These may not be that big of a deal to many people but it should be noted, because when you are paying for a high end restaraunt you should be receiving top quality in all areas of the restaraunt, not just the food. I say this because part of the price you pay should reflect your experience in this type of place rather than only the food. 

I don't mean to be rude, I am sure being in the Vegas location the turnover is much higher and they probably don't have time to be as attentive as they might be somewhere else. But if you are like me and and believe these are important factors in your dining experience, then keep walking. I am sure there are other high end Vegas restaraunts where you can receive the whole package for that price at Ruth's Chris.",S-QNToG4ZCLYmnPLKpfXAg,2,0,3,7AXWpvbbFA-aT_1h5pkRWA

At the request of my mom (she was my plus one at the Elite event and was very impressed), we celebrated my brother's birthday at Ruth's Chris a couple of weeks ago.  Please be forewarned that there is no valet or self parking anywhere near Ruth's Chris.  It's at the exact opposite of all the entrances if you are arriving by car.  

The one star is for the decoration of the restaurant, but that was it.  From the bread, the 400 degree hot plate of bone-in ribeye, to our server's unkempt attire, it was not the ""upscale"" experience, food or service, Ruth's Chris is supposed to be.  

By no mean am I trying to be a snob about the whole affair.  I think I am capable of adjusting my standards based on where I am at.  However, for the price and the service, I'd take my dollar right next door to the Caesar's Palace Joe's Stonecrab and be a happier customer.",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,4,0,1,uNEfCI9qPxO_sz4MxIHdVg

The potatoes au gratin were cheesy blandness and the asparagus stalks were fibrous and tough.  As a local there are many fantastic steakhouses in Vegas that will knock your socks off. Some are more expensive than here, some less. The point is the food here is less than average when compared to its peers.

4886482,2015-02-09,1,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"Start with the good stuff. The server was really attentive, and had a very good sense of humor (which I really appreciate at a restaurant). Our orders arrived remarkably quickly. The food was yummy. We started with the Caesar salad which was tasty.  We each had filet mignon (both cooked to perfection). We had sides of Lyonnaise potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce. The hollandaise sauce actually was very good.  We did not get dessert.

Now why I didn't give more than 3 stars: 

(a) when I made our reservation on Opentable.com, I couldn't get anything earlier than 8:00 p.m. (They open at 5:00pm. I wanted 7:00 or 7:30pm). When we arrived, however, the place was over 2/3 empty (it was the night of the Grammys); 

(b) my ""petit"" filet mignon cost $42, my friend's regular filet (which wasn't any larger than mine) was $55. All we got was the steaks. No sides. Not even some kind of sauce other than ketchup or A1 (Flemings at least offers a selection of Au Juice, etc.).  They said the sides we ordered were big enough to share. They were not even close. The portion barely reached the top of each small serving dish. For the prices they were charging it should have been overflowing.  In short, we got more food, for (literally) about 1/4 the price at the Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian;

(c) I have been to several Ruth's Chris steakhouses. Each of them has a very similar feel of a  high-end, classy steak house (big private booths, warm wood colors, etc).  This location clearly had been cheaply jerry-rigged out of a prior restaurant. While it looked nice enough, perhaps, to be a ""Ruby Tuesday's"" location, it looked nothing like what you would expect from a Ruth's Chris; and 

(d) To get to the restaurant you needed to park in a lot that was, at best, sketchy and nasty, and then walk through a hotel (Harrah's) that is (or should be) two days away from a wrecking ball and a week-long environmental decontamination project.  Although there certainly should have been, sadly there was not one of those hand sanitizer dispensers outside the elevators to the restaurant",zdd3a5Qb4RZ5FGB_HXY3Mg,0,0,3,5VnMNfWSsIaErtMbO2BR_w

He charged my card for two drinks and I bought one my friend payed with cash. He kept her cash and charged my card for both drinks!! I was so pissed. The server Jessica was great she took great care of us. The manager Lisa Martin showed love she gave us 20% off our entire bill.

Service was no where near what I expected. I figure if I am having a 200.00 dinner I should NEVER have to ask for a drink refill but we had to flag him down.
We were trying to order and felt rushed plus the waiter was adamant we could share the sides. Which I thought was odd but we order the filet and I ordered the 20 oz lobster. (He explained the small size was very tiny) 
The steak was good but it wasn't as good as expected. (Bob 's in Irving Texas beat the heck out of this piece of meat.)
We shared a potato( I don't k now why) We both asked for one but he was pretty sure we wanted to share...lol
We also shared the salad..which was prob a good idea it was not that great we left most of it on our plates. The lobster was VERY chewy and stringy ..of the 20 oz ..about 25% was not edible to me. Hate to say it but I've had better at Red Lobster.

The fillet was $56.   I got the lobster tail which was Marketing Price/$100.  It.was.huge.   It could have been slightly less cooked, however, still delicious.  Everyone was sharing their cuts of meat, which are a la cart.  I tasted the Rib eye, fillet, lamb.  All delicious and mouth watering.  

The highlight though was the Prisoner wine which was a cabernet blend from californian.  Also, the spicy (not at all) lobster appetizer was my favorite.  Think of the best orange chicken you have ever had, but with lobster!

As a San Diego resident the service and food at Ruth Chris San Diego is amazing-sadly it was not the case for my Vegas experience. We went a couple of weeks ago for my BF's birthday and I made an online reservation indicating the special occasion. We got there a little late and it took about 5 minutes for us to get seated which we were okay with. Our server seem to be attentive at the beginning but as time progressed we were totally abandoned-he only came to check on us about two-three times after our food was served. We couldn't make up our mind with the drinks and maybe that's what got him frustrated so he decided to go take care of his other tables and forget about us. We ordered the three course meal and while we were still eating our salad the steaks and sides came out which rushed me to finish my salad and my boyfriend had to ask the busser or whoever he was (it wasn't even the waiter) to take the food back, he was not going to rush his salad just because they decided to bombard us with all the food. The steak was alright I guess, somewhat salty but the sides were horrible. I ordered the saut√©ed mushrooms and creamed spinach, the spinach looked like it was the left over of the day with some butter added and the mushroom consistency was like they weren't saut√©ed but rather taken out of a bag and just tossed in microwaved melted butter. My point is-the sides tasted like we go the leftovers of the day and maybe we did since we go there at 9 and they close at 10:30. We truly felt rushed throughout our dinner and if you are going to be rushing people then don't take late dinner reservations. I like to be constantly checked on the service needs especially when we are paying for a $200 dinner. He didn't even get a birthday cake like they normally do in SD.

I ordered my steak med rare and when it sizzled on the plate it was medium almost well.  Just pink.  I still enjoyed the taste and we went on a business dinner, but I had to pay for it I think that I would be upset with the crab legs and the steak.
Let's clarify this, I mentioned it to the Donald Bishop the general manager when he casually came by and ask us how everything was.  I told him it was great except for the crab legs he asked why and I told him, based on that I thought he would give us a dessert (even though we couldn't eat another bite).  Instead he thank us for the feed back.  I didn't say it for something it was the truth, but for him to not even just comp it because it was still on the table.  I think for a place like that he could have done somthing about this.  If I am wrong please let me know.  I am a business owner myself and I know customer service is everything.  This was not really customer service to me.

Staff was very polite and professional, we were greeted by a server and his assistant - I just want to begin by saying our server was shown up his assistant. My party was not given bad service but all the service we received was from the assistant. 

Paying 20% on a $480 bill is roughly $100. I need my waiter/server to earn that kind of money. 
In the future I hope wait staff, like Johnny, are more attentive and concerned with paying customers.

My wife was pushing for Ramsey and I wanted to go with reliability.  But it's in Harrahs and you have to walk through the smokey casino to get there.  But what a relief to come off the elevator to what tends to be a Ruth Chris unaffected by Vegas!  Beautifully (minute signs of wear) appointed circular restaurant. We were seated by the window with a view of the strip. Jeff our waiter was friendly and attentive. Just enough small talk to make us feel welcomed.

However, I'd say that the steak itself was subpar. Took my mother and younger brother.

The place is nice and everything is what it should be for a steak house in Las Vegas. Their menu is short giving you a few options, although it's short it has all the necessary items. They have everything from Ruth's favorite, family sized sides, big and petite steaks, kids menu, and deserts. I ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, 40 oz porterhouse for two (medium rare), and lobster Mac n Cheese as a side. Let's start with the shrimp cocktail. It came with cocktail sauce, salad, and 4 jumbo sized shrimp. The shrimp with plump and soft. Supremely sweet and perfect with the sauce as it's sidekick. Next the main event the steak. I got the porterhouse because it gives me two different cuts of steaks. The filet and strip. I must say presentation was pretty awful for this dish. The steak was cut up with 3 chunks on either side and had this massive bone just nuzzled in between. The steak was so dry that I unfortunately had to dip the steak in A1, one side was more brown than the other, it was ice cold when I bit into it. The steaks color transitioning of medium rare was totally uneven and instead a target color type of steak instead of a sea of red. Lastly the lobster Mac n cheese. The presentation was average. What more can you expect from Mac and cheese. The macaroni itself was good, however a little to soft and past al dente. The cheese was completely set and not gooey when it got to my table. However the star of this dish, the lobster should go back into the sea. First of all, the lobster was not fresh. You were biting the sea instead of a succulent plump and sweet piece of lobster. Overall overcooked pasta, cold cheese, and fishy lobster do not go well together. The service here is spot on, so is the setting. What makes this place deserve a 2 star is the food and the price that comes with it.",PgahbauUKkpwKK4i1oi-iQ,0,0,2,_bk3LInc3e9Lmw69ZNeBmQ

I ordered a filet and we ordered a bunch of sides so I was able to try the creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes, and mashed potatoes. All the sides were delicious, especially the spinach! The filet was juicy and tender. I've been to Ruth Chris in Cancun and Irvine and this Ruth Chris meets the same standard of deliciousness as the others.

I was disappointed with their deserts though! I got the cheesecake and the layer on top was more bitter than sweet (weird for cheesecake) and the graham cracker tasted stale. Would not recommend cheesecake here.

Our server, Dora, was first rate. Very funny and attentive not to mention extremely knowledgeable about the menu.

I started with the spicy lobster appetizer which Dora said was her favorite appetizer on the menu. It was amazing. It was so good in fact that I almost cancelled my steak and just ordered two more portions of the spicy lobster.

I also had the Harvest Salad which was quite tasty as well. One of the better dinner salads that I have ever had.

For dinner I had the Filet Mignon. It was 11 ounces and quite good, although I will say that it was under cooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). It was also just a little chewy. I have had better cuts at other restaurants, but it was still good and I still finished it.

On the side I had the loaded baked potato which I split with someone else. Again, it was good, but I have to admit that I have had better. Morton's baked potatoes put the Ruth's Chris potatoes to shame, but it was still good.

Oh, I almost forgot, our dinner also came with this amazing French bread. It was warm and soft and all kinds of awesome. 

After dinner we were absolutely stuffed, so I can't comment on the desserts. I will add that this location (which is inside Harrah's Casino) has a really nice view of the strip, especially Caesar's Palace.

Overall it was a fantastic dining experience. It is not cheap, so be prepared to spend some cash, but it is definitely worth it.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,0,1,4,l5I-qfn00C0x4ak7OTWD5A

I ordered without even opening the menu. I do this to impress whoever I'm with. The crab cakes came out sizzling hot. It's 99% crab, the way it should be. I also love their butter sauce with little pieces of that bell peppers.

My ribeye came out sizzling hot, well done charred, just how I like it. He got a petite fillet which he enjoyed very much.

I came in with my family (10 people) for a Christmas dinner. Dimly-lit atmosphere, okay service. You can order with a set course meal or just by the plate. 

My family started off with calamari and shrimp cocktails. Shrimp cocktails only consist of 4 shrimps per plate but I will admit that the shrimp was a good size. Both were okay. 

I started with the lobster bisque which was pretty good. As for the steaks, they are expensive because they are bigger than usual for the size. 

I got a 20 oz Ribeye ($50), med/rare and it was juicy! Good at first, but then when I got to the center, it became dry, which started to take awhile for me to chew. They also charge you for sides that you order, so if you only order a steak, that's all you get. Which is why I am saying poor presentation of food. Can't offer a little flower on the side to make it look a little better? 

I've had much better steak for cheaper or equivalent prices. I would suggest you guys to go elsewhere if you don't want to get ripped off. 

My family ordered the 19 oz filet mignon's and weren't satisfied with the way they cooked it. One was more well done than the other (compared to my parents), and they both got med/rare.

This location is really nice and classy.  Has a view to accompany the classy feel.  With all the fancy hotels in Vegas I would have never guessed I would find Ruth's Chris in the Harrah's hotel.  

Seriously, I've been to the Beverly Hills location and the service is always great so I'm sure it would be great even if the waiter didn't think he was serving a star.  There was a second waitress who came to assist and he shooed her off and said he could handle our group of 12 alone.  Wow, he did just that. Even with one, the service did not slack and he stayed on beat. (I'm very unhappy, I have forgotten his name)  

The food...well if you have never eaten at Ruth's Chris you must.  The lobster mac, and the sweet potato casserole are really heaven to your palette.  The BEST part, this is a steak house.  So order the bone in at medium or medium well (please don't char your steak with well done), and you will be satisfied with this wonderful food party.

It was delivered well done so I sent it back requesting a new steak. My second steak was not the same quality of cut as the first and it was well done as well. On the third attempt the management told me they would bring it to me under done and allow their 500 degree plate to cook it through more completely. It arrived medium rare. The rest of my party was almost done eating and I now had to cut my steak into smaller pieces and finish cooking it myself by searing each piece on my plate. I was annoyed that I was paying almost $50 for a steak and it couldn't be prepared properly. As an apology they offered me a free $11 dessert but made me pay for the steak that I couldn't finish because the plate became too cold to continue cooking my steak on.

5773945,2018-03-09,1,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"Geez, where do I start. This place could be so much more successful with just a little attention to detail. It is located on the second floor of Harrah's which allows for a nice view of the strip - providing you get a table close enough to the windows. This was the first Ruth's Chris that I have been to and had high hopes for such a reputable name. 

There was a group of 11 of us and after all was said and done we spent a little over 3 hours and $1,800 (not including tip). The dress code posted at the hostess stand does not seem to be enforced. There were people in a wide range of attire, most not suitable for a high end steakhouse but I digress - after all, it is Vegas. There were kids screaming, yelling and running around most of our visit.  Again, not ideal for this type of environment. 

The wait staff was attentive but could have improved. Our waiter took our order but due to a technical ""glitch"" the system lost the order and he had to retake everyone's order (quite a while after placing the initial order). The cocktails were good but overpriced for the size. The food was good, one of the best steaks I've had in a while. I chose the 11 oz filet with Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese and cheesecake. They serve the steaks on a 500 degree plate and repeatedly inform you of how hot the plates are.  The lobster in the mac and cheese was a bit chewy but still tasty. The Caesar salad and cheesecake were both very good. 

Shortly after 10pm they turned all the lights on, essentially hinting to those still there that it's time to pack up and get out. Not very professional in my opinion. Overall it was a good meal but I came in expecting more out of such a well recognized name.  With the wide range of choices in Vegas I would definitely look at other options in the future.",E2u5fJb146uIJeLRoC1ezw,3,1,2,48Q44udhIw-8ksM8W_jd2Q

By far the best steak I've ever had. Top quality meat seasoned and cooked absolutely perfectly. The steak was so good, I didn't bother with the bread or the two side dishes we ordered! Service is top shelf and expected in a place like this. If you've never been to a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, you've got to try it. I highly recommend reservations. FYI: Restaurant is located in the run down Harrah's Casino, but they are a separate entity entirely. You take a special elevator to the second floor and when the door opens, you're in the restaurant. Windows all around. View of courtyard between the hotels is stunning. Neon everywhere, very Las Vegas!",vEhrJJDLGypFAAnPkJfQrQ,0,0,5,0neQx9SJ_2kmHhQJWH89eQ

The staff was very friendly and even remembered that we were on location for my boyfriends birthday earlier this month. For dinner I had water with fresh lemons, a peach mascato, the chilian sea bass, shared the lobster mac n cheese (side dishes are big enough to share), and the boyfriend had the ribeye steak. We were even surprised with a birthday treat for him which was raspberry cheese cake. Such a wonderful time!",f82QsPEd5w1W6yDnwsjmPA,1,0,4,lO5wksNbVGbIglrXIbB9uA

I had the salmon with creamed spinach and he had the 8oz steak with mashed potatoes and we shared the lobster mac n cheese. We started h with one waiter and out of the blue, we ended up with a different waiter. The 1st waiter didn't go over any details like a nearby waiter did for her table. She was very engaged and detailed and he was just blah. There was no pass of or even a mention of a change in waiter. The new waiter didn't even introduce himself or even ask what we were drinking. He assumed that my husband was drinking Pepsi when it was actually root beer but he charged us for the drink he mistakenly brought out as well as the correct drink but I didn't even say anything; although I should have. He seemed to be in a rush and dropped my husband's silver on his sunglasses. He was was a sloppy mess with the rushing. I was quite disappointed in the level of customer service from these waiters.",zygllU5kMSlzxfGr_Zt19g,0,0,2,JhFVyyOxUm9_DyV9JtUjRg

We attended for our anniversary, looking to take a photo on Strip,, as well as enjoy a special evening. Hostess could not find reservation, even though we made it the evening before in person. Hostess was equally rude and non responsive to request for seating, as too busy talking to another employee.  First two wines we attempted to order, out of stock.  When we finally attempted to order, the waitress was non existent to take food order. When food did come, side dish forgotten.. Photographer was to show up pre dinner, was no show until after dinner, and had mechanical error, so photo not available to next day for return trip. Total debacle = Total Rewards at this location.

Excellently prepared steak, the green beans were just how I like them and the sweet potato souffle was ... well, damn near perfect.

The evening started a little slow as our waiter was busy with the manager over something. Once we did get things started (about a ten+ minute wait even after we asked for the waiter) service was excellent. The mozzarella and tomato salad is large enough to split, which my wife and I did. I tried the bone in NY steak rather than my usual rib eye and was not disappointed. It was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My wife ordered the stuffed chicken breast and would not do that again. She said it was all cheese. She wished she had just ordered a petite filet which she has enjoyed in the past. One disappointment was that when they revamped their menu about a year ago they removed Lyonnaise potatoes which I love. Half the reason for choosing between steak restaurants in Las Vegas is the side dishes since they all have great steaks. I expressed my disappointment to the manager when he came by to ask how everything was and he told me that if I informed them I wanted Lyonnaise potatoes when I make my next reservation, they will have them available for me. That is great customer service and I will take them up on their offer. Our out of town visitors had the filet and the shrimp entr√©e and both were pleased. The French fries were good but not Lyonnaise potatoes and the creamed spinach was excellent. I can't comment on dessert as we've never had room for it on any of our visits but they do look good. The steaks and the service coupled with The Strip view still make this is my favorite Ruth's Chris location.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,0,4,LsympweaUI9ZdWKzZWt7Yw

5918511,2013-04-05,1,n_o2DAmDBAZ-RjVDSY-5uQ,"This Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is the busiest of all of their many locations (if I heard it explained correctly).  It is located inside Harrah's casino, and has a beautiful view (especially in the evening) of the Las Vegas Blvd and The Forum Shop across the street from the bar and most of the dining area.

To get to the restaurant look for the pair of elevators with the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse signage nearby. If you can't locate it,I am sure one of the Harrah's staff will be happy to provide direction or perhaps even escort you there.

(Disclaimer)  I was at this Ruth's Chris Steakhouse recently for a private function, therefore I will primarily limit my comments on the service, food, and overall dining experience.

First, the decor and overall ambiance was very pleasant.  The lighting is dim, not conducive to food photography (unless you have really good camera gears that are capable of low light photography), as you don't want to disturb other guests with your flash photography.  But the view of the Strip and automobiles and pedestrians below is almost hypnotic.  (4.5/5)

The staff that waited on us were a good group.  Rene our server was exceptional, and was knowledgeable about the menu, including details not printed on the menu, as well as the trivia about the oven temperature for preparing steaks (1,800 degrees) and warming the plates that the steaks and most other entrees are served on (500 degrees for the plate, so don't get burn).  (5/5)

Highlights of their menu:

Cowboy (USDA Prime Beef Bone-In) Ribeye.  If you love a good steak cooked to your desired doneness, they have excellent steaks.  Portion size is 22 oz, including the bone.

Caesar Salad:  Very common in most restaurants, but they prepared a really good one here.  (4.5/5)

Seafood Gumbo.   A milder version of the gumbo that will suit the palette of most guests. I personally like my seafood gumbo with more kick, at least from the Andouille sausage and seasoning.  (3.5/5)

Barbecued Shrimp.  Used barbecue spices in the sauce (which is very delicious and would go great with the breads from the bread basket), but the Jumbo Gulf shrimp is sauteed not grilled.  (4.5/5)

Sweet Potato Casserole.  Of the sides we ordered (French Fries, would be better if it was double fried or more crispy; Creamed Spinach, no complaints; Potatoes Au Gratin, no complaints), the Sweet Potato Casserole was the only one we completely finished.  It is sweet, has a nice crunchy crust, and I liked it with my entree, but could also enjoy it as a substitute of their normal dessert options.  (5/5)

Banana Cream Pie.  Generous portion, easily shared with 2-4 dining companions, if you even have room to spare after a steak dinner.  

Overall, everyone at the table was extremely happy with the service, food and had a blast.  5 stars!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,12,7,5,KEgPPKwl7vGWFYR30aKtSw

Hit most of them in every major city and wasn't planning on eating dinner here.  It was dumb luck as my wife didn't want to walk anymore and wanted food immediately.  Lucky for me we were in front of Harrah's.  Walked right in and had the best experience at a RC yet.  Way to go folks in Vegas.  

Locations I have eaten at are:

Annapolis, Atlantic City, Anaheim, DC (don't go to that one), San Francisco, San Diego, Orlando (thought the folks there were a little racist), Chicago (there are better steak houses than RC in Chicago), St. Louis, Midtown NYC, Charlotte, PDX and Seattle to name a few.  Business trips are nice for eating at good restaurants.
