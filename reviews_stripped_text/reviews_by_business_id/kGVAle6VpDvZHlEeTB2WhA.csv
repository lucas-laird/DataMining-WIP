I have driven by it a million times, and never even thought of stopping there. But I took a chance. They had an awesome deli menu, and sell boar's head meats there. But I was in the mood for pizza. I ordered a large pepperoni for my daughter, her friend and myself, and it was a giant new york style greasy pizza. Just the way I love it! I have been complaining for years that I can't find great pizza in vegas, but I guess I just gotta know where to look. If you like great cheese, grease that drips off your pizza....mmmmmm..... then this is the place for you. Also, since they serve boars head meats, im sure they make some great sandwiches too...if you want something a tad healthier. :)",ilUszgXeT1P0xpdKEemvAw,0,0,5,sBdQnWpYAbXXNvWCOt2OCA

Been coming here for couple years and every time I get great service and conversation and it's a wonderful little cozy spot that isn't anything glamorous or tons of tables and servers. The guy making my pizza and sandwich is the same guy who brought it over. But that's what I like about it and that it offers well made deli sandwiches and pizza that will take you back to how pizza suppose to made. Rich just right sauce with lots of cheese and ingredients to add. A must have pastrami sandwich for those real pastrami lovers. A great prices and atmosphere!
This isn't your cracker type pizza's nor is it 5 lbs of dough to chew through, It's a perfect pizza!!! But it's only for those who appreciate a well made pie. My family and friends all love coming here. It's our only place for great food of this type and will return again and again and again.  See you there. Hey they deliver but I rather eat in!",3E_s_uUd9ov7S7EP2RlqvQ,0,0,5,IXeAeiHtPatELx7o9SSpig
1178285,2011-05-30,0,kGVAle6VpDvZHlEeTB2WhA,Great food a little pricey but quality is awesome. $5 Gyro lunch special with fries is a steal. Owners are very friendly always a warm greeting with a smile. Their corned beef sandwich special is to die for.,FkmQbim2v64DvE69FfuThw,0,0,5,GeCDIPHzKwCDYPEXdETkPg
1552040,2015-07-18,0,kGVAle6VpDvZHlEeTB2WhA,"This is easily the best Pizza that you are going to find in Las Vegas. They don't do any advertising and they don't need to. This pizza is to die for. I have been going here for years and have even ran into Floyd Money Mayweather here 3 times over the last 5 years. It doesn't have the bright lights like most of the overrated joints on the strip, its just a place to get the best pizza that you'll ever find in Vegas. You don't even need to search anymore, its already here.",rVSD0x81lsAplKLV5z36OQ,0,0,5,PCcIr1FJOsMdOWBgrRFBfg

2390999,2012-10-03,0,kGVAle6VpDvZHlEeTB2WhA,"OOey, gOOey cheese and juicy mouthwatering toppings..this place deserves five stars from me.  I stop in about three times a month to order a 20 inch barbecue or hawaiian pizza.  For under $22 and the amount of pizza you get its definitely worth it.  They are so generous with their high quality Boar's Head toppings as well.  Walking into Deliria, you'll find they see they sell cervezas in their refrigerator among other canned soft drinks.  Best of all, I don't have to drive all the way to Sunflower Market to pick up Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  

Ditch the Domino's and the 'Za Hut, shit, ditch the Papa's too, and head over to Deliria for an awesome addition to your sunday and monday night. (Go Niners!)",2WtJLiJtZgUF-aY0RCQTRg,0,0,5,4zPc7S7gMGqLjVZVjEie9Q
3216100,2013-03-10,0,kGVAle6VpDvZHlEeTB2WhA,There's nothing visually outstanding about this place. You walk in and it's basically a sandwich shop that has pizza too. I ordered a small cheese pizza for my kiddo and she was very happy with it. The crust was chewy in a good way and I liked the tangy-ness of the sauce. My 6 year old loved it. I liked that the crust didn't get soggy in the 30 minutes of taking it from the shop to the dinner table. It's a good local joint with a delivery option. I'll definitely be back for more.,qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,2,1,4,A-OSOyXGch-DU1uRJbBXog

The place always seems to be a mess though, something a good days cleaning would help.",ZsAw2e4Vdq88-yDCtZJPlg,3,0,2,ett_lPNSwEscJy8MRU1UBg
4579234,2016-02-09,0,kGVAle6VpDvZHlEeTB2WhA,Just Ok. When the pizza arrived it was lukewarm. The wings weren't very spicy either. I understand they are close by my house so I don't understand why it would be lukewarm.,BSTUa43K1sqiFf1Pp76vGA,1,0,3,Iv4SVHI7Hs1beDM4BPcwlA
