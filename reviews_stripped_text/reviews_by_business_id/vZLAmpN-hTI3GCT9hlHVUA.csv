We loved the complimentary goodies like Parmesan cheese, bread basket, pickled cauliflower, and salami. 

The octopus appetizer is great. We shared the veal Parmesan and spicy vodka rigatoni and both were good. 

We had a glass of Leviathan and the Barolo. Both were good. 

We finished with espresso and complimentary lemoncello. 

We did not care for the music - the 50s/60s music seemed out of place with the ambience. A little too loud and upbeat. 

Overall a great experience, although a bit expensive.",8NL04B7pa7iXTai-QZqYGg,2,1,4,sRgyDC7bdbj4BlU5b6hkYQ

28950,2017-03-14,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"This is my first time eating at Carbone in Vegas, but I've been to the NY location a few times.  Carbone in NY is still my fave Italian restaurant but it can get pricey, so reserve it for special occassions.  That said, I think the quality in the Vegas location is similar but not the same.

Food:
Carpaccio - definitely worth it for the table to share as a starter.  Super flavorful
Rigatoni Vodka - always a must get when you go to Carbone.  This and the meatballs could be all that you order and be happy.
Fettuccini Funghi - underwhelmed.  For a $30 of pasta I expected a bit more but the serving size was surprising.  Pasta was fresh but I'd rather get another rigatoni vodka.
Meatballs - always must get.  I could eat all 3 meatballs and be OK.
Bass Oreganta - OK, not a must have.
Squash - if they have this, definitely get it.  After having the squash here, I've wanted to replicate it at home.  
Ribeye - not worth $100+.  I've had this in NY and it was 2x better.  Not sure why this didn't stand up to the original but something was off.  Maybe it's that there's ton of other great steakhouses in Vegas, so coming here for steak just didn't make sense.  

Overall - get a few rigatoni vodka pastas to share, some meatballs (make sure each person gets one... maybe 1.5 ;), and the squash..  Add in the carpaccio and you're good to go.  Finish off with a few cocktails, which are solid too.

Dress attire is: don't be a slob.  You can wear jeans, but wear nice ones.. not ones w/ giant logos, ripped jeans, or saggin from your knees.  It's the modern age so look proper.",zxH6hETFTgNh5uF-s_ONdA,0,0,4,hQF6iMQK9RQyXFCCN4wp3g

113058,2015-11-16,2,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"As locals living in Vegas, we rarely dine on the strip. Carbone is a fine example of why we stay away. It was so loud we could hardly hear our waiter, who was just creepy to begin with. He told us about his favorite dishes while ignoring our questions. The menus are also so large in size, it just just obnoxious. There are not that many options, why make the menu so huge? It literally blocked you from seeing/hearing the people sitting just next to you. 

I ordered a vodka soda before my dinner, and the metal straw it was served with has some one else's lipstick on it. I do understand mistakes are made, but gross. It also took so long to bring this attention to a waiter that the drink was entirely melted by the time it was taken away.

As a vegetarian, I understand I am not the target guest for restaurants like this but we had reservations with friends so this is where we ate. I ordered the minestrone soup which was green for some reason but absolutely flavorless. A bit of salt would have helped a lot but there was none on the table and getting attention of our waiter was nearly impossible. I also had the chopped salad which was just so weird. It had radicchio, beans, tomato and some other things. It was spicy and weird, not tasty at all. For my meal, it was as if no one had tried these things they were serving to me. The friends we ate with, liked what they had which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars.

195456,2016-06-01,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I was anxious to try this restaurant, so I made reservations one month in advance. I read other reviews online and I knew that the worst place to be seated would be the three (maybe four) tables for two on your way to the kitchen. To prevent this from happening, I called the restaurant right after I made the reservation to ask for the ""booths"" or the semi-private tables. I was told by the person on the phone that this would be ""noted"". My wife and arrived a little early to the restaurant and we asked if it was possible to be seated early. We were told that nothing was available until our time (which was 45 minutes away). My wife and I came back to the restaurant at our scheduled reservation time. Once we were brought to our seats I noticed that their were many vacant tables. The hostess seated us (guess where?) next to kitchen. When our waiter arrived we asked to be moved to one of several vacant booths. He told us that we had to make earlier arrangements to have one of the booths. I told him that we did and he said he would talk to ""someone"" about it. When he returned he proceeded to tell us their was nothing that anyone could do about it. We ordered our food. I really enjoyed the house salad. Also, they had a person cut chunks of cheese from a wheel. I thought that this was a great touch. We ordered the vodka pasta and the almond pesto pasta.  As I mentioned earlier there were several vacant tables (including the booths and semi-private tables) so I was a little surprised at their 35 minute ticket time for pasta. Once the pasta did arrive, I was shocked at over cooked and bland each of pasta dishes were. So, with the bad customer service and bad pasta, why would anyone want to waste their time with this restaurant? With all the wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas spend your time and money somewhere else. You'll be happy you did. Also, no one ever sat down in the vacant tables. Like I said before- bad customer service.",03Mz2LjUY2f79rgepndS-Q,1,0,1,bieHHg3SVuNC9hIySpOlOA

238570,2016-04-07,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Carbone was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas. When entering the room it took me back to our dining experiences in NYC and maybe due to the chandelier, the Rainbow Room initially came to mind (not the view however). They did create the environment they advertise. But the best part was the food, which was some of the best traditional Italian the 5 of us have had. The sauces were expertly prepared and complimented the pasta dishes exactly. The main entrees were perfection and all were made to certain requests a couple of us made.  The service was excellent and very attentive but not intrusive. And finally our desserts were also high quality with some extras also provided by the very friendly and enjoyable staff. Our only negative was the hefty priced wine list which needs attention. Overall this restaurant deserves 5 stars. 

Our dining experience was a couple of days before Christmas so the restaurant was quiet except for the 50/60s music. But that did add to the experience which even our middle aged children agreed went with the decor. Yes, it did add to the dining experience listening to songs sung by the ""rat pack"" that made you want to get up and dance like we did back then.

342221,2016-03-12,1,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Don't look at my review and the stars I gave as a result of the food that we ate. My wife and I live in Ohio and we visit Vegas 2-3 times a year. We love the nightlife and the food scene in Las Vegas.  When we visit, our favorite thing to do is eat at nice restaurants. My wife's good friend is a gm at a restaurant in the bellagio and she said carbone was highly recommended. Our night started by us sitting down and waiting 10 mins for a table touchdown from our server. We ended up ordering drinks right after we got the menus and those took 20 mins to get. That might be understandable for a fancy mixed drink, but not for a bourbon and a glass of wine. After we saw our server again when he brought our drinks, we ordered salads and our entrees. We also ordered meatballs for an appetizer that never showed up. The salads showed up after 30 minutes and the Caesar was unbelievable. It just shouldn't have taken that long. About 15 minutes after our salads were finished our waiter came over to let us know that we couldn't have the tortellini because it wasn't good that night. We had to change one of our entree orders, so that made it take another 30 mins for our food to come out. Once the entrees were delivered we were still missing our meatballs. When our waiter finally came back over and we asked, he said he would get them out to us as soon as he could. We told him to forget it and he said ""that's good, because I think we are out of them."" Our dinner experience ended up turning into a 3 hour nightmare. The food was great, the service was just terrible. We talked to the manager when we were on our way out and she could have cared less. We would love to give carbone one more chance because the food was so good but I don't even know if it would be worth the time or money.",NaIITTP_GkgkA2I2MzCYnw,1,0,2,0VdIWe8o1gHPoUZIXFF5yg

However, I am genuinely disappointed by the lack of communication from Management. When I booked online in the comment section I informed that the night we were dining was my wife's birthday and our 21st Wedding Anniversary (yes we got married on her birthday). I called a few days later to reconfirm the time of the reservation and asked the hostess if she say my note to which she replied yes. On the day of our reservation I received a call later afternoon asking if we still planned to dine there that night. My response was ""absolutely and we're very excited"". I again asked if they saw a note about birthday and anniversary to which once again the hostess replied ""Yup, I see it there"". So the long of the short-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING was done. No greeting-NOTHING. Let me be clear that I was not looking for something for nothing. It's my pleasure to buy my wife a $12 piece of cake I simply wanted an acknowledgement and at most a candle on the piece of cake. I was not looking for complimentary beverages or anything. Needless to say this was truly disappointing. I called the following day and spoke to a manger and expressed the embarrassment and disappointment. The Manager apologized and offered us a free dessert if we were to come in again. The obvious answer is I am not going to come spend upwards of $200 for a free piece of cake.

Only two people in our party (if only two in your party you will sit VERY CLOSE to other 2-tops). Two waiters per table and the main waiter recommended we share plates, which I would NOT recommend. We shared baked clams, salad and the entrée. The baked clams and salad came in timely manner, then only after my husband and I lost track of time, we realized that three tables seated AFTER us had received their entrees (one table had 8 people!) -- never once did our waiter refill our waters, they were actually avoiding us. He stopped by the table beside us twice and told them their entrée was on the way out and then to serve their entrée -- each time we tried to get his attention and he would run off. When he finally brought our entrée (scallops...which is usually the quickest item to prepare), my husband asked him why it was delayed -- he gave a total BS answer and set the plate down, offered us a free drink and filled my wine glass  (my husband was drinking iced tea) and ran off...again. I understand delays happen in the kitchen, but all they needed to do was tell us there were delays, don't ignore the customers. I would not recommend this place at all.

We ordered some twisted pasta with spinach and some chicken dish (named after a shoe maker per Dave the waiter...wtf?!? A shoe maker famous for is chicken dish?) The small bowl of mush I received (think shallow cereal bowl overly priced at $27) was so overpowering with sherry wine and garlic it was inedible. About 12 minutes after the mush arrived, Manager Jaime walked by. We spoke about the creepy obese waiter ""Dave"" and how I was waiting over 15 minutes, at that point, without my chicken dish. Manager Jaime said she would not charge for the inedible food, or my meal which never arrived...now 20 minutes.

1019908,2017-10-25,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"We dined at Carbone for my husband's birthday, on a quick weekend trip to Vegas. There were 5 of us total, and we had made a reservation about a week in advance, although I think you could get away with making one a day or two before (There we're still plenty of time slots when I had to make a quick change to the reservation the day before). Dress code seemed to range from suits to a couple people in jeans and t-shirts. We all dressed in business casual and felt appropriately dressed.

The Service:
We had an overall pleasant dining experience, but we thought the service was lacking and the ordering process was a bit hard to understand. They recommend that you order in courses and share the food, which we found challenging to gauge how much food we needed (this was our first visit), and exactly how to split courses between 5 people. Everyone at my table was only able to order 1 drink or glass of wine, because we barely saw our waiter after our initial order. This was disappointing since it was our last night in Vegas, and we all intended to really celebrate. Although we were too full for dessert we were never offered the dessert cart, which again was disappointing as I would have liked to take something to go for later!

The Food:
Initially they bring out bread, cheese, salami and pickled cauliflower. All of this was wonderful and more food than I was expecting from a ""pre-appetizer"". Make a grab for the tomato focaccia, it tastes like pizza and was our favorite.

We started with the octopus, which was a really great tasting dish, nice and crispy with peppers and potatoes. The portion was a bit smaller than I was expecting for $26, and is definitely not an appetizer to be shared by more than 2 people. Next we moved on to the ""pasta"" dish, and ordered the spicy vodka rigatoni, which was absolutely perfect and amazing, and frankly the only reason I am rating this restaurant so highly. A friend got the lobster ravioli, which was okay, no complaints. Finally we had the ribeye Diana, which was cooked closer to rare than the medium rare we requested. It was good, but not as good as some of the steak we've had in the Midwest. Others at the table had pork chops (fatty), veal Parmesan (could feed at least 3 people), and a really amazing chicken dish.

My biggest complaint was we ordered way too much food for the table, and we didn't have a great way to take it back and enjoy it later. They ended the night with the cookies and the limoncello, which was nice but since we hadn't seen our waiter in ages we were just anxious for the bill and to leave.

If you specifically want pasta then I'd recommend Carbone for the spicy rigatoni alone, but if you are looking for service and atmosphere, I would probably take my money somewhere else.",4mHn9Z3aK9amRSZnLP-jKw,0,0,3,PGHNEmZR8FFldCc6GIz1GA

We walked into a smelly traditional Italian restaurant at a different hotel famous for good food, and ultimately walked out after drinking their water. We needed good good and atmosphere both. 

On to the Aria / close to our hotel / to cash in a few stray vouchers before exiting the Hot and Windy City.  Surprise!  With no reservation the wait was supposed to be a half hour. But the hostess with the mostess found us outside pretty quickly and informed us of an open table. Thanks!

Walking back into the Chandelier Room I was excited as I had seen it online and its gorgeous! Our pretty gold round booth was right under it. Nice!  

Ok. Then we had to decide on the food. Seemed difficult at first but then out pops Eric and Joe (our wait team!) to make recommendations and be super friendly. And the really cool thing?  They were right in their recommendations. Everything was excellent. 

Now as if the pasta was not delicious enough, out comes this Lemon Cheesecake - I mean out of this Lemon World.  Add a little Limoncello - made in house - and you are in Lemon heaven. 

Ok. Now meet the GM. Gotta tell him how impressed we were - and he is super cool. A Vegas guy himself - but gives New York credit for the wonderful people in the kitchen.

It takes you to back in the day- rat pack era. I honestly felt like I was in New York (especially after a few rounds of drinks). Elegant captains dressed in red/burgundy tuxedos with bow ties, they do a tremendous job at making everyone feel like a VIP.

The restaurant has two different dining rooms: the first is a more casual theme with blue and white tile and surrounds the bar area. Further inside is the ""Red room"" with a gorgeous chandelier and romantic, cozy booths- the absolute perfect place for a date night with loud classics playing over the speakers.

Some highlights of the meal were:
Caesar Salad (The croutons were incredible)
Spicy Rigatoni Vodka
Veal Parmesan 
Tortellini with Black Truffle shaved by the Executive Chef himself- Quite the unforgettable experience
Banana Foster (Cooked in front of you)

It's not just a dinner- it's an experience. Allow yourself a good amount of time to really relax and enjoy. The service is impeccable and trust in your Captain and the staff, from the hostesses to the management and complete wait staff, these people will take care of you like their own.

We were not familiar with the place in New York so we had no particular expectations. Word on the street was it was excellent. Once we arrived and seated we were promptly greater by the service team. The head waiter walked us through the menu options and ordering concept. Once we discussed our culinary strategy, we decided to each start with chop salad for me and minestrone for my husband. Both were fabulous, the salad particularly delicious...I know...salad delicious...crazy.We moved them to the macaroni and choose the rigatoni to share. Be carful...it has a kick! Then we shared the lobster, my husband more than me because I was already feeling my limit. Wanted to save room for dessert and I am so glad I did. All the options were brought table side and described but it was the chocolate cake that won us over. Wow wee! It was so good. But hold on, that's not all. You also have the option to choose a rare rum or aperitif from the bar trolley and we were also treated to their house made limoncello.  I can't forget to mention the delicious varieties of breads served with antipasto assortment before our soup and salads. Again, ALL delicious.

I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and they didn't mention that it would be in squids ink pasta.  The flavor was so strong it was practically inedible.  We tried to split dessert but even that was horrible.  I can't remember what they called it but it was supposed to be some twist on bananas foster.  I didn't realize that the base would be a rock hard chocolate brownie.  We scrapped everything off of the brownie and tried to eat what we could that was edible.  We knew that we were eating a pricey restaurant but paying over $200, for the two of us to both have horrible meals was awful.  The manager kept lingering saying isn't that wonderful, and when we would complain she kept saying, well you must not go to New York because this is the way it is done in New York.  I have never had Veal marsala, in New York or anywhere else that used a bone in veal chop.  Sorry, it was definitely NOT what he was looking for in a meal that night.  The Marsala sauce was typical of any you would find a  decent restaurant.  Also, be aware that if you are going to eat anywhere on the strip, valet parking is now anywhere from $10-$20 for less than 4 hours.  We paid $14 to valet our car so we could have the horrible $200 meal.  It was a nightmare dinner and we will never return there again.  Their menu does not do a very good job of describing the various dishes.  So, I was being generous with two stars and that was only because the Caesar Salad and coffee were so good.

Once inside the restaurant you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas, which is a bonus.  The front room, in particular, is quaint, charming, and feels like you're in an old school Italian spot.  The staff is unbelievably friendly and attentive.  The menu looks simple, but it's anything but that, and the wait staff are pros at directing you on what to order and how to order for your table. They're incredibly well trained and polite.  Make no mistake...we over-ordered and over-ate! It was amazing. Don't underestimate the garlic bread. Baked clams, scampi, caesar, spicy rigatoni and, oh, those chops!  Those chops!!  Also, best carrot cake I've ever had.  And, they bring you these little tri-colored cookies as a palate cleanser after the meal that look like the Italian flag and taste like love.  Also, although we ordered the scampi we were still bummed because we also wanted the shrimp su'modo...the waitress surprised us with a sampling!  Fantastic experience...I'd call it a can't miss if you're anywhere near Vegas.",FGwhxsNx0rCFK-MF-vk_7g,0,0,5,gLyPMFovhYdyMX6PKa238Q

My husband and I split an appetizer (prosciutto and freshly made mozzarella), pasta (fettuccine con funghi), 2 meat balls and veal parmesan- all outstanding, I'd say the pasta was my favorite but it was all fantastic. We finished by splitting a piece of cheesecake which was good but I heard the carrot cake was to die for and the chocolate mousse looked yummy!

1249621,2018-04-06,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I will give 4 stars for the food. 

First off,  I'm a NY-er. Brooklyn to be exact. Does that make me an expert on food? Yeah,it does. As far as Italian food goes...sorry but we Brooklynites are kind of experts. In Italian cuisine anyway. Here's the thing--if the hostess tells you to go to the bar so you can wait for your table and you wanna order a nice glass of wine, you should be able to do just that. As my client and I approach the bar we were told ""why don't you go sit over there in that area and someone will be there in a moment to help you"". Not sure why we had to ""go to that area"" but no one was there to help us. As we sat there and pondered....""where is our wine"" our table was ready. We ordered the tortellini and spaghetti puttanesca. It's unfortunate that the bread is nothing like the seeded semolina that we covet so much in New York... but hey, we are in Vegas so...whatever. Just a tip to the management here, if you want to charge New York prices then the Quality of the service and the food has to be equally matched. Perhaps a little bartender training will improve the service. 

One nice touch is the very cold limoncello we were provided at the end of our meal. 

It may serve you well to take a look at what Il Mulino does in Greenwich village New York to set the standard of what we New Yorkers compare as a great Italian dining experience. Follow their lead in service and maybe I'll consider returning. 

Please train your staff in how to make your customers feel welcome and then I'm happy to return!",s9NmJrulng2ntVFYObEeoA,0,0,3,2YnYRSt5snEiBDz--fgCow
1278480,2017-08-11,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Came here with a party of 5. Cool atmosphere good service and good food. I will say however, we were duped a bit when ordering, the waitress made the impression that the dishes were really small and had us order a few too many dishes. Due to this we initially ordered the veal parmesan which is the only dish we really wanted to try and ended up having to cancel it after our pastas since there was way too much food. 

ANTIPASTIs
- Octopus Pizzaiolo (5 stars) smokey you can really taste that BBQ charcoal flavor. Delicious

Zuppa E Insalate
- House Chopped (4 stars): it's chopped salad how great can it be. Still that being said great salad.  
- Caprese (5 stars): very fresh mozzarella. Probably one of the best I've had. Also they cut it up in front of you. Tomoatoes very fresh 

Macaroni
- Tortellini al Ragu (4 stars): nothing that really blew me away, but good dish.
- lobster ravioli (4 stars): pretty good dish but I have had better. 
- Spicy Rigatoni Vodka (4.5 stars): very solid spicy rigatoni vodka sauce. Creamy and quite delicious. I would probably order this pasta over any of the others. 

Pesci
- Pork Chop & peppers (4 stars): good dish but did not wow me. Pork was tender and moist. If I had to do it again probably would not get this dish and substitute it for the veal parmesan we were unable to try.
- white fish (fish of the day) (4.5 stars): This was surprisingly a fairly good dish. very light fish.  

Contorni
- Funghi Trifolati- Good dish. Interesting with all the variety of different mushrooms. 
- Truffle corn - You can see all the shavings of truffle on the top of the corn. Good but very overpowering with the abundant truffle shavings. 

Overall good place to eat. Atmosphere was great. Oh forgot to mention they give you free limoncello and italian wedding cake. I would probably dine here again for a special occassion.",c55ONBsSZBfaUN5Uhy-qGw,2,0,5,QmnvwCwfWcJz9Pq1HpZI7g

Not a ""thank you for your comments,"" or ""apologies for not meeting your expectations"". Our experience was subpar at best but knowing management does not value constructive criticism or acknowledge guests feedback reinforces this restaurant is not worth the hype or the price. 
The veal was bland. Portion is generous but tasteless. Do not order the potato Louis. It was over salted to the point of extreme. I couldn't believe a dish like that could ever leave the kitchen of its caliber. Servers were eye-rolling each other and annoyed with one another.

Once, Carbone hosted a 'Wheels Up' dinner that I was invited to where I sampled a bit of everything.  The tableside Ceasars Salad was impressive.  I love the large homemade croutons.  Tuna was melt in your mouth.  Bass & Clam Oreganta was ok.  The Veal Parmigiano tasty & cheesy, but I've had the best at Sinatra's.  Love the festive Italian dishes like you're at your Italian grandma's.  

Tiramsu was ok... I'M LYING IT WAS TO DIE FOR!  One of the best I've had.  It's also absolutely beautiful.  Check put my picture mmm.  I will start here first next time I'm at Carbone.  Also the Cheesecake was ridiculously good.

Overall, I cannot get enough of the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka.  

Also sit at the bar.  To start they bring a nice cheese & salumi w/ bread plate & an excellent wine selection w/ knowledgeable bartender's.  Service has been fantastic from day one.

1355217,2016-01-08,6,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Excellent food but seriously overpriced, in my opinion. They say that eating at Carbone's is like eating at your Grandmas house, but I don't remember Grandma hitting me up for $300 after dinner.  LOL. 

We came to Carbone's while staying at the Aria for New Years. After rejecting the first two crappy tables we were offered, we were seated in a really cool booth that reminded me of the Vegas rat-pack days. A quick review of the menu let me know that the evening was not going to be cheap or even reasonable, so I sucked it up and just figured I'd enjoy the meal regardless of the cost, but I'd save the steak eating for another night (because the bone in ribeye for 2 was over $200). After ordering a glass of wine we decided to share a salad and a the mozzarella appetizer. We both ordered the rigatoni for the main course. 

The watercress / blue cheese salad came first and was truly interesting in flavor, texture, and appearance but at almost $20 for a small salad, not a great value. 

The mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer was next, and it was truly excellent. Fresh mozzarella and prosciutto made for magnificent flavors and was enough for 2. I don't recall the price but it was really worth having. 

Next was the rigatoni. Although the flavor was excellent (spicy!!), it was served on a small plate with almost no presentation and for $27 seemed a little underwhelming. It did taste amazing but for that price, it should have been a bit more impressive. Along with the rigatoni we ordered 3 meatballs which were truly excellent.  

Look Yelpers the food here is truly very good, but I just feel like there are much better values for the money in Vegas and at the Aria (try fifty 5 for some pizza!!). The service was also top notch, but I would be insistent about getting a good table as they will cram you into a two seater by the kitchen if you let them. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, the food, and the service but I thought the meal should have been about $100 cheaper. If money is no object, I think you'll have a great time here but for $250-$300, I was left feeling a little jaded. 

Food      -  5 Stars
Service  -  5 Stars

The entire decor and ambiance drools retro chic while the food stays true to its roots in flavor but gets dressed up

Meatballs (4.5/5) - off menu but some of the best I've had at a restaurant. I'd argue they were better than Rao's by far

Caesar salad (4/5) - one of the best Caesars I've had. It's also done table side

Lobster ravioli (4.5/5) - delicious and an abundance of lobster pieces 

Veal parmigiana (4/5) - tender and elegant. This is where Rao's has an edge.

1399554,2016-01-14,1,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Food: A NYC transplant, this was a very typical LV type restaurant in terms of overpriced. The pasta however was excellent! The rigatoni in a vodka cream sauce was succulent and it was one of the dishes that you kept wanting more. Linguine & clams was also good but not as a spectacular as the rigatoni. The spaghetti held its own and prepared aldente very simply in a tomato sauce. All the pasta were in the $28 range but as mentioned in Vegas that seems to be the going rate. For appetizers the waiter recommended the ahi sashimi style; it was nothing special. For the entrees the veal marsala was a generous cut on the bone and fork tender but the marsala was prepared in more traditional fashion so the flavor profile was different from your typical Americanized marsala. The Ribeye Diana was excellent, very juicy, and tender and the sauce complimented it really well. The Branzino which was another recommendation from the waiter, fell flat in flavor and texture; definitely not worth the $68. The dessert cart was impressive and the triple chocolate cake was more than enough to share among 4. The wine list was very overpriced and would recommend bringing your own bottle or drink in the casino before dining. It's easy to load up on the bread as the selections of garlic; focaccia and ciabatta were all very good.

Service: Service started good as the appetizers and the pasta came out quickly but there was a very long wait for the entrees which made it the dinner far longer than it had to be. Though the waiter was apologetic and said he would comp our appetizer and wine the manager did not approve it.

Ambiance: Very cool décor and there are 2 rooms which are separated by the bar and styled differently which made the noise level acceptable for conversation.

We came in a bit early at 6pm due to a red eye flight and was immediately seated in one of their intimate red curtained booths towards the back of the restaurant. Carbone provided an impressive amount of food before we even ordered our meal, including a slice of Parmesan cheese, pickled cauliflower, spicy salami and a bread basket with 3 different types of bread. I only tried the focaccia (which was a bit too salty) and the garlic bread which was pretty yummy!
For our meal, we ordered a lot of things based on our waiter's recommendations. We ordered the baked clams as our app which was soooo good! Definitely recommend! It offered the clams baked in 3 different ways and the middle three with breadcrumbs was my fave! It comes with 9 clams so it was a generous serving.
We then ordered the spicy vodka rigatoni along with the tortellini alla ragu with 2 meatballs on the side. Although the rigatoni is what the restaurant is famous for, I definitely enjoyed the tortellini more! The pasta was cooked to perfection and it just melts in your mouth. I would definitely order that pasta again!
Lastly, a dessert cart is brought to your table and a selection of the desserts are on display for your choosing. We whittled our choices down to the lemon cheesecake and the Nutella tiramisu and once again, chose the cheesecake as per our waiter's recommendation. Along with the delicious cheesecake, two rainbow cookies as well as some limoncello was delivered complimentary with the bill.

He was very pushy on selling us the nights specials, as well as getting our drink orders right when we got there. We told him we needed a minute to look over the menu, and by the time he came back to order he took the cocktail menu from us. 

Personally, I pair my drinks with what I am going to eat to compliment each other (how strange). I think he had in his mind we weren't going to buy drinks so he just stopped checking on us all together. Literally! We were constantly checking with other servers for assistance. After over two hours of being there, we waited..and waited... for the check that never came. To the point where we were walking to the front of the doors to pay there, and they were telling us have a good night.. No... we are trying to pay for our bill, and we have waited almost forty minutes.. we just wanted us to pay to leave and they insisted on us sitting back at our table..

The manager I believe stopped by? She apologized, and a different server came and gave us a drink from the bar on the house.. It was like a lemon vodka, that was too strong.. and I am not sure if he meant to but he left the whole bottle on the table with us. Not my idea of fixing the issue, but that's just me, since we just wanted the check to leave. We didn't even finish the drinks that were poured or the bottle.

The cherry pepper ribs have a wonderful flavor though the ribs themselves are incredibly tough.  I ordered a pasta dish for my parents and requested it to be well done rather than al dente as they have difficulty chewing and was told by the server that he will not offend the chef by making such a request.  We have spent countless months traveling the villages and cities of Italy and always requested softer well done pasta for my parents to be able to enjoy. Clearly Carbone is well off enough to refuse to serve patrons in an accommodating fashion. The tourists may keep this place going.  As a local, I will not dine here again.

After a lackluster lunch (and crappy service) at Milos over at the Cosmo yesterday,  my wife and I celebrated her 3rd annual 29th birthday with dinner at Carbone.

From start to finish,  this was possibly the best dining service we've ever had. 

We started with drinks obviously,  and my wife,  being the Ryan Gosseling fan that she is,  ordered an Old Fashioned,  which Carbone makes with an Apple Brandy. Perfectly balanced sweetness that she was looking for. 

Before our appetizers arrived, they brought out several types of garlic bread with fresh chunks of the best parmesean you'll probably ever find,  along with salami   and cauliflower. 

I had the lobster fra DiaVolo,  which may have been the best Lobster I've had outside of New England where I grew up. Pulled out of the shell by the captain at our table,  and topped with a tomato sauce that was just enough spice to heat it up,  and stop perfectly as you begin to taste the lobster with each bite. 

My wife had the scallops,  mostly because she loves them,  but I also think we were just a little full from all the free alcohol in the casino. The scallops are massive,  and of course perfect. 

Side of the most bomb mushrooms ever,  followed by banana flambe,  and we were eve brought Italian cookies and house made lemon cello that was incredible. 

In all,  the bill was nowhere near as big as we expected,  which is always a bonus,  but of course that's not to say it was cheap. The service,  and entire experience just made it feel like we owed much more than we were asked by Carbone.

And that's why we'll be making this a must for every trip we make from here on.",eFP1599TbP303-6cWiM1Gw,5,2,5,gDSqvCiKJ2oCpjZX_24Rfg

We were checked on. At this point we asked about our meatballs we never got. Our waiter told us "" he would try and get them to us. "" After being  annoyed and tired we told him to never mind and his response was "" OH GOOD I THINK WE ARE OUT ANYWAY "" WAIT WHAT ?!?!?? ok, so you were just not going to serve us what we ordered and just think we were going to forget about it.  Our waiter then was no where to be found was asked one of the assistants for our check in which he brought it. He never asked us if we were interested in dessert, I never got asked if I wanted another glass of wine ? We had plans of eating and drinking all night but over 2 hours at a dinner and we didn't even get appetizers. Also, someone told me everyone gets free cookies .. Never got them never saw them. I've eaten at so many places in Vegas and never had crappier customer service. They told us they were "" busy "" well, it's Vegas on a Friday night ... I would assume you would be used to busy.  For being a fine dining establishment they were unprofessional. We told the manager on the way out and she basically said they were busy and "" what could she do for us? "" For a 300$ dinner I rather spend the 300$ at Jean George's across the hallway or Olives at the Bellagio. I have several friends in the restaurant industry in Vegas, I told them about our experience and they were flabbergasted. Was the food good ? Yes. But I don't want to wait 30
Minutes for salads. Also, there were four of us. It's not like we were a table of 12. I would expect a 2-2.5 hour dinner when you are drinking, eating appetizers, salads, entrees and dessert. If the customer service would have been better I can assure you 3 more alcoholic beverages minimum would have been ordered, and we would have each gotten a dessert. But dessert at 11:30 pm didn't sound appetizing since I was falling asleep at the table Practically. So so so disappointed after we had heard so many good things. We checked out of our hotel this morning and I was sure to tell all four of the people
Standing there about our experience. They felt bad and all said they wish there was something they could do.",LIBCmKxseYYK4w7GOvRqsw,4,0,2,xMLn49gOMNi1RN9kcThM-g

The maitre d is so helpful, accommodating and friendly! Along with the entire staff from bus boy to waiter to bartender! Top of the line service. The complimentary goodies in the beginning are delish! Salami and breads..mmm the menu itself is a bit overpriced. I wanted the famous veal but wasn't paying $70 when eating alone only if sharing. Opted for the famous penne with vodka sauce and one meatball. The penne was too rich for me. Looked beautiful! But very intense and overrated sadly. The meatball was okay. Next time I would try the veal parm and tortellini ragu instead. I think best to only come here if sharing and having a couple bites of each dish to avoid a tummy ache from how decadent it truly is.",VKcl3pHSyO8tyEStQBkEoA,0,0,4,QJ41dLVRUlm5fkHUf7CFnA

Came here with a friend with medium high recommendations. The prices are definitely high so started expecting a lot. It started off right with the servers bringing fresh parmigiano reggiano cheese, bread, spicy salami, and pickled cauliflower. 

My friend and I were deciding between a number of dishes and they recommended the spicy rigatoni vodka... It was amazing. Perfectly al dente, delicious sauce, full flavors even without any meat. We then shared the dover, which was well cooked - although maybe a tad high on the butter and capers. 

We ended the night with tiramisu and (complimentary) Limon cello.

1652502,2016-01-02,2,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I've said before, fine dining is generally not my thing, however, on special occasions I have to ""man-up"" and go to an Italian restaurant fancier than the Olive Garden or Bucca di Beppo.  New Year's day was one of those days.  Put on the shiny shoes, fill the wallet with crisp Benjamins and off we go to Carbone in the Aria.  

We got seated in a cozy red velvet booth.  This is the kind of booth the waiter has to tuck you in with by pushing the table around.  I planned on having adult beverages later in the evening, so I didn't want to make myself comatose with food (or carbone-load).  Fortunately, Carbone has plates, which aren't filled with a pile of food.  This was fine with me.  We dined on the following food components:

House salad - very good (Italian dressing)
Beets Siciliana - very good (good as a plate to share)
Spicy Rigatoni Vodka - very tasty (with a tiny amount of heat / medium size dish)
Tortellini Ragu - tasty (cheese filling, the ragu is creamy - a relatively small dish) 
Bread basket - good (a mix of breads / gratis)
Parmesan cheese chunks - For cheese lovers (gratis)
Sliced salami - very good (gratis)
White wine and a fancy wheat beer (with a name I can't remember) - as expected (and necessary)         

Overall, the restaurant operated with a high level of precision.  The wait staff was great.  The head waiter (or possibly the Captain who was named Chris) was knowledgeable and very serious about his business.  Our waiter, Keith, was serious until you broke him down a little.  Underneath, he proved to be a regular guy who completely understood the need to delicately balance food intake with the need to leave room for after dinner adult beverages.  Everyone treated us well.  Everyone bid us farewell.  I'd certainly go back (maybe just having a couple of small plates at the counter bar along with the salami and bread).

For the entree we got the spicy ragitoni vodka($28) and lobster ravioli ($39)! It was my boyfriends birthday and our chef friend brought us out a veal entree and side of potatoes. For desert they bring around a cart and we chose the lemon cheesecake which was a treat, it had so many flavors like nothing I've tasted before.

The standards are spectacular: the rigatoni, the caesar (made tableside), the meatballs. Cocktails & wine selection are both also fantastic.

It's a fun environment that feels actually authentic - very refreshing vs. the rest of the Vegas vibe. I like how old school and traditional it is. Looking forward to coming back!",vUprhQajGQSsqUVPCYhrtw,0,1,5,ahB6h3vFTaovVSWJmYxzKg

Since our friends made the reservations, we were seated without hesitation.  Our main waiter for the evening was very courteous and professional.  His counterpart, who assisted table duties, was a little off color for this dining establishment.  It almost became comical by the end of the night to see what he would say next. 

A lovely variety of bread, fresh parmesan, italian meat and cauliflower are all brought to each table compliments of the restaurant.  It was actually surprising how much is bought out before placing any food orders. With all of these goodies I decided to skip the salad and order the Veal Parmesan.  This entree is huge with plenty to take home for leftovers.  The sauce could have used a bit more flavor to brighten the dish.  The veal was good but not the best of quality I was expecting.  

Since I was dining with the dessert queen, we decided to split the NY Cheesecake.  It was very creamy with a hint of lemon to create a delicious flavor.  I would absolutely order this again.  The complimentary tricolored cakes brought out were pretty but dry.  I did however appreciate all of the generosity.

But they just keep on giving... a complimentary bottle of limoncello is also presented to the table.  Now since I was driving I decided to pass.  From our friends at the table it was pretty strong so drink slowly!

1680676,2016-03-30,2,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Carbone was the last dinner we had in Vegas since we were feeling Italian. The decision was between Carbone and Carmine's. Carbone won because it was the closest in distance. However, despite it being in less walking distance, it was so difficult to get a reservation and it might be because the restaurant is new-ish having opened in Oct 2015. After pulling some strings, we were able to get an 8:30pm reservation instead of the the 9:45pm time slot that shows up on OpenTable.

Decor: It's dark, kind of an old-school feel especially with the music on the particular night we were there. The Temptations were on a loop and the walls looked like a dark turquoise to me in the main dining room where the bar is located. There's a bit of a diner feel to it with the black/white tile floors. The music really throws me off because of the dark decor which I don't really care for. 

What we ate family-style...

Octopus appetizer: The more we eat octopus, the more we realize that most restaurants MUST be using a sous vide to cook this before finishing it off on a grill. This was still pretty delicious the way it's cooked to be tender. I definitely appreciated the thicker parts of the tentacle more than the thin parts.

Oyster appetizer: This was a special of the day not on the menu. The oysters come with a bit of a calabrian chili sauce that has a really nice kick to it.

Complimentary sides: pepperoni, pickled cauliflower, block of parm and bread. These items really did what they were supposed to: I was getting hungry while still deciding on what to order.

Rigatoni in Vodka Sauce: Ok, so I know this sounds like something pretty regular, but our waiter sold us on this and he delivered. I've never had a decent vodka or even arrabiata sauce spicy like this. It's kind of like a spicy cheesy sauce, but you really taste more heat than the cheese, almost like a fancy mac and cheese. The pasta is made in-house and is more elbow-shaped than the rigatoni I'm used to, but the shape was perfect for the pasta. 

Meatballs: This pairs really well with the rigatoni. There's something about the tomato sauce. It's a little sweet, but so good that the guys at the table were sopping up the sauce with bread.

Veal Parmesan: One of the more tame dishes, I suppose, but it's good but now ""wow-amazing"" good. 

Pork Chop: Probably one of the favorite meat courses of the night. Even though it's pork, it reminded me so much of steak so it's not too overcooked. 

Service was terrific. We got a lot of great recommendations from our server. At the end of the meal, they served us complimentary limoncello and almond cookies. It's been a few weeks since I went and I still dream about their spicy rigatoni. Nearly worth going back to if I'm back in Vegas, but depending on if i I can get a good reservation time.",3SGQKsO1J-jcRIp3WNxCeA,4,2,4,0yVeyfLCoAkMgwLzSy7-tQ
1687010,2015-10-23,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"So good. So good. So good. Best Italian I've had yet. I went with three friends and they each agreed that every course was just amazing. 

I was a bit nervous trying a place with no reviews, but I am so glad I did. We went to Mon Ami Gabi last night at Paris, which was extremely underwhelming so as a first timer in Vegas I was beginning to think Vegas was all hype. I am so glad I was wrong.

We arrived early for our reservation and were promptly take to a lounge area where we were able to order drinks. We were sat at a table shortly after. The bread basket comes with a traditional loaf, ""pizza"" bread, and garlic bread, each very good with the garlic bread taking home gold. We ordered 3 Caesar salads and one chopped.  The Caesars were prepared table-side dressing and all; we all agreed the croutons were the best we'd ever had. I think it's the best Caesar I've ever had. At this point we were all full - and we still had meatballs and pasta coming. The Spicy Rigatoni Vodka was just amazing. The pasta portions are smaller than you would expect but with all of the bread and the salad it was just right. I was able to try the Tortellini Ragu as well, which was very good but had nothing on the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. The two others also enjoyed theirs dishes.

I will for sure be back at Carbone if I am ever back in Vegas. 

Oh, the drinks we tried were on point too! My amaretto sour was made using egg whites with gives it that lovely foam on top, and the men enjoyed their traditional Old Fashioneds.

I wanted something around $200 a bottle but the attitude and comments made it really difficult not to order a high ticket bottle.  Especially in front of other friends and clients.  They definitely do their best to make sure the ticket is on high end side.   Very professional at doing it with finesse. 

The food is average, the overall service is very professional .  The $130 steak was Really not that great.  I don't think it was seared hot enough, didn't have the crust texture.   The lobster was slightly soggy.  I would expect restaurant like this to use Sous Vide but I highly doubted due to the texture and tenderness of all the dishes.

Upon settling into our table, I scanned the place....and re-scanned.  ""Wow"" I thought.....there had been significant thought and effort put into the aesthetics and ambiance.

The service here can be slow, but it is always knowledgeable and courteous.

1756441,2016-02-14,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"The food was good, but ... the experience was loathsome ... and kind of sad. I think this place was designed for men in their 20s who just don't know any better. I mean, it's supposed to recreate 1958, but we were seated under a speaker blaring mid-1960s pop music. That was our first clue that something's just ... off about this place. 

Here are some other highlights:

The ""captain"" said he'd tell us the price of the specials, but only if we were interested in ordering them. Very classy. 

He repeatedly described small portions as ""designed for sharing"". (And why would a plate of rigatoni be a signature dish? Everybody's nonna brings a tray of rigatoni to pot lucks and picnics. Nothing special about Carbone's rigatoni that would differentiate it from nonna's. Except the price, obviously.)

The wines were priced a little higher higher than any other Vegas restaurant. 

The restaurant drops a lot of complimentary snacks on the table while you wait. It's not a ... bad thing, but everything is heavy and spicy, while some of the main courses are delicately flavored and are overpowered by the pizza bread and salami and chunks of cheese and pickled cauliflower. 

The ""captain"" didn't offer us any limoncello, either, but he probably figured we wanted to get out of there and would stiff him on the tip. We did NOT, as this mess of a place is not entirely his fault. 

The food was way overpriced. Similar dishes at other high-end Italian restaurants -- with less-muddled concepts -- are less expensive, and the experiences have never made me want to get up and leave.",bxtJZVQ2NE_k7IEu_MbFtQ,4,1,1,4klviWbzAvHrRlKg6SsajQ

Now for the food. Unfortunately, it was average at best and did not live up to expectations. I split the tortellini ragu and spicy rigatoni vodka. Both were good but not that flavorful. For main I had the bass oreganata. It was cooked well but a little salty for my liking. 

Overall I would've given this place a 4, however, the waiter was a complete prick. Considering the price and location, I expect excellent service. Several times he was very rude and gave a laugh regarding menu questions. No reason to be pompous, you're serving me.

1783592,2018-03-05,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"We went to Carbone for my husband's birthday.  We were very surprised by the treatment we received.  We were served water but and offered wine.  We turned down the wine as I was in pain medication but neither of us were offered anything else to drink.  My husband had a Manhattan earlier and was hoping for a second one. We were never asked again.  As soon as we waved off the wine,  the staff weren't interested in serving us and were very rude.
 
At first, we actually wondered if they were specifically trained for the sheer rudeness.  

The busboy made a point to explain why the wine is 600% more because of the $7 millions dining room renovation.  Wow.  When you are a sommelier,  you didn't need the extra knowledge on wine costs at a restaurant,  but you definitely got the hint that alcohol was where their money was.

When the waiter finally came to our table,  he asked what we wanted.
He did not offer other drinks, specials,  or explain the menu options or descriptions that all other restaurants do.  It was like being served by Lurch from the Adam's family.

Ordered minestrone and Caesar salad.  Lovely table side presentation of the salad but when placed down,  declined additional anchovies,  yet he left them to sit in front of me even after he removed my salad plate.  I got to see the fish all the way through and after dinner.

No seasonings of salt or pepper were to be found on table.  Still,  our waiter could not be flagged down by us.  Very few words were spoken to us.  We were never asked anything other than what we wanted in the menu.  Meanwhile,  Lurch was having a good ole time laughing it up at the crowded table of guests behind us as he spent all his time there serving wine and later after dinner drinks.

The music was so loud that the Busboy got right up in my ear and yelled  ""everything ok?"" when our dinner was served.  

I ordered lobster ravioli.  I was surprised to see that the Lobster was on outside of ravioli.  Squid black in color for the ravioli.  It was tough as if undercooked and aldenti.  We could not get a hold of our waiter at all to tell him. The Lobster Fra Diavlo my husband orders was tasty,  but no spice whatsoever.  The description of the name of the dish implies spice.  No heat as all. Still couldn't find someone to ask for some pepper.  

When the bill arrived,  we had three drinks added on our menu that were not ours.  Once fixed,  round 2 the bill reflected a $16 double rye plus $3 for a manhattan bump.  The house Manhattan that was ordered was $17.  After asking that,  he went back again to correct the receipt.  

The Lobster Fra Diavlo was $95.  My dinner $39.   Not worth it.   Our table was cleared except for the anchovies still and we were done after the lack of service.  They brought us two cookies,  one broken, as a token and we left.   

It's a shame that we were treated so terribly.  We spent close over $1500 on a family dinner at the Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse the night before and had the best time.  We were there for our four hours.  We were expecting a similar experience.  Instead,  we felt insulted.  We asked for the manager but he was too busy to come by.  After waiting awhile, we left.

Let me begin with the caesars salad; it was the best salad I have ever had (I understand I am saying this a lot, but I am not exaggerating). The server came and made the salad table side with fresh parmesan and fresh ingredients, that's just the beginning. Next came our main course, I am not going to mention anything other than the pasta that we had because it was pure perfection (Please don't waste your experience by ordering a steak here, go to Jean George for that). All of their pasta dishes, which we ordered, was authentic and delicious. I am impressed as ever and couldn't help but rave about this place. I was too full for dessert, but I am sure that it would be just as perfect as the main course. Try the cream corn with truffle too, that was to die for. 
I hope this review helps and encourages everyone to give this place a try.",79pMUntDZLY_iBTOnEcI4w,1,0,5,OS6JIP8dcoVu6JkUi0N6Mg

The decor/ ambiance and service make you feel like you could be in a back alley of Rome somewhere and that's without mentioning the food which tasted like it was cooked in Italy too.

There really wasn't a need for appetizers as the bread, meats and parmesan were fantastic and help to justify the high prices of Carbone. Having said that we split the baked clams of which there were 3 different types. They were all hot, steamy and mouth-wateringly good.

I followed that up with a simple tomato vodka pasta which was the perfect amount and you could really taste the freshness of the pasta. It really makes a difference when everything is made fresh from scratch and that was clearly the case here. My colleagues had the seafood pasta and ribs respectively. The latter was huge and could easily have been split between 2 or three people.

We then split a slice of carrot cake and cheesecake and I have no complaints with them either. I didn't see the check as it was expensed but I'd bet it was a high number. However, I'll go back on my own dime anytime as the whole experience is worth the money.",JDC7mpF4Qs8nDO6BXbSY5Q,2,2,5,JOLpBb7LrZSyWb6O632Rbw

And like most Italian restaurants, we were given some bread before the meal...the bread was top notch.

2016312,2017-07-31,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Excellent Italian restaurant in Vegas (heard it was based on the one in NYC). Has the old school east coast Italian restaurant feel, merged with a cool trendy restaurant in terms of feel and decor. 

Did some yelp searching before going, and some frequent items many people were suggesting were the Caesar salad, meatballs, and the Vodka rigatoni pasta. Opted for these 3, and it was more than enough food, especially along with all the extras they provide there (although the waiter did seem to be pushing to add an extra meat entree). That would have just put it overboard imho (although if you come hungry, many people seem to suggest getting the veal parmesan). 

Off the bat, they provide a huge basket of bread (which is quite good, particularly the marinara bread and garlic bread), along with complimentary Salami or something like that. One could get kind of full off that alone. 

Caesar salad: Maybe the best ever. They make it table side, and add a little anchovie it seems like to provide some extra flavor. 

Meatballs: Off the menu, but the house special. They are very good. Not sure about best ever, but definitely good. 

Vodka pasta: Excellent. Not too heavy or overwhelming. Dish was almost kind of simplistic, but very good. 

Didn't opt for dessert, but also complimentary, at the end, they bring you some small pieces of cake, as well as an 80 proof free bottle of Limoncello. It was quite sweet, but has a very strong kick to it. Only had a couple small glasses, but I can't even imagine how wasted you could get (and how much sugar you'd drink) pounding the whole thing. 

Drinks: Told the waiter I wanted something whiskey based but not too sweet and he said he'd have something. Ended up being a rye old fashioned, which was very good. 

Also: Decor is awesome. Very cool vibe to the restaurant. 

Overall highly recommended! Especially if you have a 100 dollar food voucher from staying at Aria (pretty much the only thing I liked about the hotel, but that's a separate issue and review).",71IYrODaVPnVTAMcoQwelQ,1,0,5,jh5WAphhv4kHJI-lJqOB_w

We arrived at about 9:45 PM on Thursday evening. It was our last night in Vegas. I was there on a work trip and my fiancé came to meet me. We were looking to celebrate a night out in Vegas together. We had wine across the way at Bardot,  which is another great restaurant. We headed over to our reservation and had to wait a few minutes before walking in. The staff was lovely and had great customer service. The restaurant is much bigger than I expected. We walked through three different rooms, each carrying a ambience but with the overtone of old-fashioned, Italian style. We headed to the back where there are separate booths. It was so cool. My fiancé and I immediately looked at each other and knew we were going to have a fantastic experience. The aromas of garlic, Parmesan cheese, marinara sauce hit you right away. As soon as we sat down we grew increasingly more and more hungry. They serve you water and put a big chunk of Parmesan cheese in front of you. Old-school, Italian. The place was coming down from being busy earlier. You could tell that everyone was running around. Our waiter told us that we just missed a party of 40. There were a few menu items that were off the table so I'll server told us this right after that. There was no specials, but he recommended a few dishes. He then, got busy so Eric came over, assuming he is a manager to take our orders. He recommended the rigatoni vodka penne because that is the most popular item on the menu. I try to avoid heavier sauces so we went with the pesto, sausage, and broccoli dish. Forgive my Italian. We also got the caprese salad. I was surprised at how big the portions were. The caprese salad is amazing and I definitely recommend getting those two dishes together. They bring over amazing garlic bread as well as a pizza bread. Everything tasted so amazing together. When we were done, they brought over the dessert cart - but we were pretty stuffed. Although, we did not order dessert - the servers brought us over an Italian flag made out of chocolate anyways complimented with some limoncello. One of the servers came over and accidentally knocked limoncello on my fiancé's lap. He felt so bad. Other than that, this was a perfect experience. Everything that we got was $100. We also got red and white wine. The prices are so reasonable for how delicious it is and how fancy a restaurant it is. I highly recommend that no matter where your staying in Vegas, you dine here.

A drunk and a waiter both bumped into the table. Not something that should happen during a 300 dollar meal for two without wine.  We would have ordered wine, but they seemed very expensive for relatively mediocre bottles of wine, even for Las Vegas.

Even with reading reviews or speaking to people you can't seem to get a solid consensus of which are the can't miss places being there are so many choices. We had originally made a reservation at B&B Ristorante but after being totally jet lagged from flying in we decided on Carbone since we are staying at Aria.

The Atmosphere is really nice, very classy design as well as good sound insulation. Service was great as well. They start off by bringing you some sharp provolone and bread which was fresh and cheese was great tasting. We shared the chopped salad which was excellent. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli $39.00 entree and I had Penne Vodka $28. 00. My wife's lobster ravioli was very fishy but she enjoyed the flavor of the sauce it was Cooked in. My penne alla  vodka was well penne alla vodka. Nothing special. We are prob a little tainted because we are from NY and have so many good choices for Italian but overall the food was good not great but not worth the price. 1 Chopped salad, penne vodka, lobster ravioli, 4 glasses of wine came to $195.00

The food... ambience... service...wine!!!!

It was perfect for a romantic dinner for my husband and me. We got one of those cute table for two where you're sitting side by side :)

We had :

Parmesan - on the house - yummy!
Bread basket - on the house - really good!
Cauliflower steak - super yumm! Have had this at other places - but it was the best here.
Linguine - Aglio olio - superb
Vodka sauce pasta - Yummmmmy!

I had Bigaro - red sparkling sweet wine was amazin!

For dessert we had :
Chocolate cherry cake and tiramisu - both were out of this world!

Well so it was a perfect dinner!

The fish was heavy and greasy with an over browned butter sauce that  I found to to be almost stomach turning. Hoping to salvage the meal, tiramisu was ordered thinking it should be in the strike zone for an Italian restaurant. Nope. I found the dessert dry and inedible.  The lady finger, which to me is an integral element to any tiramisu was just placed on top almost as an afterthought. The coffee was good though.",mRRPkNjj7NWDQpyq6evieA,1,0,1,5t036gmWAo39ReKntYdDNQ
2342060,2018-02-03,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"First time every coming to Carbone based off of a recommendation. Since it came so highly recommended, I had high expectations for dinner and thankfully it did not disappoint. We had reservations and were sat immediately. 

The captain explained to us that everything comes family style and it is recommended to order from a few different areas on the menu and share. When we were deciding what to order, we just weren't in the mood for any of the ""main entrees"".  The only negative comment I have to say about the entire night/experience was that when we ordered our meal, a salad and 2 pastas. The captain looked at us funny and said ""No main entree?"" We were just in the mood for pasta. 

As in most higher end restaurants you are offered a bottle of regular water, sparkling or tap. Which I personally love! 

We ordered the Caesar salad to start with and share. They make it table side so you're able to customize it as much as you'd like. The only thing we opted out for were the anchovies. It was absolutely delicious! The croutons were by far the best part of the entire salad. That might sound a little odd considering they're just croutons but they're made in house and have the best flavoring to them and they're not too crunchy! Trust me, if you like Caesar salads in general you're going to LOVE this one! 

I asked what were the most popular/ favorite dishes and they recommended to me the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. I think it's safe to say that I'll be dreaming about this pasta. I'm typically not a fan of any type of red sauce but this may have changed my mind. It's a red, slightly creamier sauce. The captain explained it almost like a pink sauce. It had just the right amount of vodka to where I forgot it was even in the sauce and the perfect amount of spice. I would go back just for this! 

The other pasta we ordered was the Tortellini al Ragu. Homemade tortellini with ricotta and what I believe was some type of bechamel on top of the ragu sauce. This was also excellent! 

Lastly to end the meal we were given a almond cookie and a shot of the lemon liquor. I will definitely be coming back.",aXOkJO_X9IdiXiyjeCJ3tQ,0,0,5,ZpVbsa875v3D1_RpLaA1Gg
2347594,2015-12-14,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"The restaurant had a nice ambiance but overall, it was a huge disappointment.  I was there to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and invited one other friend to come along with us.  Although I notified the restaurant that we were there for a special occasion when I made the reservation as well as informing the girl that seated us at our table to remind the waiter, no mention was made of his birthday. 

Unless you are psychic, you won't know what the dishes on the menu consist of because there are no descriptions (except for a few standards like Veal Marsala).  Our waiter acted like he was doing us a favor by describing the dishes.  The Caesar salad ($21 each!) was prepared table side and the dressing was good, but the lettuce pieces and croutons were very large.  No cracked black pepper was offered at the table.

My friend's pasta dish was very average and barely had enough Vodka sauce to coat the too-chewy al dente rigatoni.  My boyfriend's Rib Eye Diane was not ""Diane"" style at all.  It was very fatty and greasy even for a rib eye steak and had a few sliced mushrooms on top for $54.  I didn't even order an entree because I couldn't find one menu item that seemed appealing enough to me and the waiter didn't seem interested in explaining any of the dishes or was he aware of the price of the ""specials.""  He ""thought"" the two fish Market Price items were around $90 and I wasn't about to be surprised when I received the bill, so I passed on those two offerings.

The parmesan cheese, pickled cauliflower, bread basket and Limoncello were nice touches.

There are too many other good fine dining establishments in Vegas for this restaurant to be so impressed with itself.  After reading some of the other reviews posted, I realized that I was not alone in my opinions.",vdV_f2cRtAVu8TvOcauR1A,1,0,1,A0b0aH44qKuMwZHhKt9dUA

Also we were nicely surprised and appreciative of the little extras they give you for free beside the main order: it started with a complementary generous piece of aged parmesan cheese, followed by a plate of charcuterie and ended with a bottle of house limoncello.

The only point they will need to work on and improve is the ice cream and gelato which are below average and were not even at the level of a regular supermarket brand ice-cream, that was a bit of a disappointment especially considering the $15 price for 3 scoops.",GYzUlry61MdFSdwyMKIgSw,7,8,5,kl77luUS7LY49i7pgYkOjA

Caesar salad table-side followed by the pasta course - Lasagna Verde served table-side and the Spicy Rigatoni. For the main course we chose the Veal Parmesan which seems to be a popular choice and did not disappoint. Our second entree was the Bass Alison, a lighter dish, baked which kept it juicy and flaky. All of this was shared four ways. We continued into desert, opting for the airy cheesecake topped with lemon curd.

There are no descriptions on the menu so you have to ask if you want to know what you are getting. The music was so loud (ridiculously loud) and he had an accent so we had to ask him to repeat himself and he got frustrated with us.

The vibe in the restaurant is incredible.  Upbeat exciting music that almost makes you want to dance.

When you are seated, you are immediately greeted and provided several very nice starters.  Delicious Breads, Spicy Salami, Pickled Cauliflower (try it) and  what I assume is extremely aged Parmesan cheese.  These items alone deserve 5 stars.

You have a waiter and a captain who explains the restaurant and menu to you.  We decided to order the prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer and man...it was incredible.  They literally make the mozzarella to order.  It comes out hot and they cut it into pieces infront of you placing it on the prosciutto.  SOOOOOOO good.

We followed the appetizer with a single order of the veal parmesan.  Holy crap.  Top 2 veal parmesan's I've ever had.  The veal has a light crispy parmesan crust covering the entire veal and an absolutely delicious marinara sauce to go with it.  The waiter cuts the veal into 4 pieces and serves it to you.  Amazing.

Oh yeah, the drinks - I am a rum fan.  HUGE rum menu.  Even better - staff that knows and understands the rum.  My waiter talked to me for 5 minutes about the rum telling me the different options and what he thought I would like based on my preferences.  When they bring you the rum, they cart over a good sized round table with all of the rum choices on it, hand you the bottle to confirm your choice and then pour your drink.  Very unique and excellent.

By the end of the meal we were actually pretty full, and while we wanted to try a dessert, couldn't manage.  All of them looked amazing though.

The top off the night by providing you with a complimentary bottle of homemade limoncello and an Italian cookie.  You obviously can't take the bottle, but you can sit there as long as you want to sip on the final drinks of the night.

The lobster ravioli and the veal Parmesan were the best and really tasty. Took 30 minutes for our food to come out and it was probably because of the four orders and the veal. Lobster ravioli not filling but interesting and the veal was very Tender and perfectly ""sauced"". We didn't get to try the rib that came with it because we wanted to save it for later but it was tossed instead of boxed along with a quarter of the veal Parmesan.

Food, great. Wine, what little we had, amazing. Let me explain how to ruin an evening with great food and wine.

NO SERVICE...had to beg.

After opening and pouring the first pours, they left the wine bottles on the table and never came back to refill glasses or offer additional selections. Never came back to refill water, ask for cocktails, we had to get up twice to ask if someone could bring more water to the table.

Three of our guests, left the table discreetly to ask what was going on and why no one was coming to service our table while the 4-top table next to us was being well-attended to.

They forgot to bring out three different side dishes we had ordered (total of 6 dishes). Completely forgot. They offered to put the orders in after bringing out the main courses.

Of course, our table was a mess. Empty cocktail, wine and water glasses, empty wine bottles left on table, no one came by to take empty dishes away or sweep debris before dessert.

I have to admit the dishes were great, however, there are a lot of extraordinary restaurants in Vegas. Carbone lost our faith and our referrals. Each of us traveled in from all over to attend this birthday gathering which made it all the more disappointing. Even if they were shorthanded that evening, they could have explained it to us and at least make sure we weren't parched by the end of the evening. Bummed.",mNiB3ki6lPERwxduPqfNQw,12,2,1,g4cVSmzmoRIpOsSlGvCRmQ
2875213,2017-12-14,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Located in the Aria Resort, it was fairly easy to find. So that's a plus if you have been walking around or gaming all day and need to relax with a fancy meal. And before I get into depth about the food that we ate, I will start with this. The restaurant is gorgeous. An artsy canvas of Christopher Walken invites you at the lobby and you are taken into a luxurious blue dining area area and past that, lo and behold, the lush red room with twinkling chandeliers comes into view as you pass full carts of desserts, liquors, and cheese. It's beautiful. Now, sitting at the table, Sinatra blaring from the speakers, you are given quick pickles (delicious!) and a basket of bread. The bread basket is probably my favorite part of the restaurant. It has garlic bread, focaccia and one other kind (that I don't remember ) with a small chunk of parmesan cheese. It's yum. 
The menu is brought to you, and there's very little written on them but dang, those are some large menus. 

Anyway. We were planning on eating something later in the night so we decided to skip a large meal and we decided on lighter dishes. We decided to go with the Octopus Pizzaiolo - an aged grilled Octopus. It was really soft and not at all chewy which was an interesting texture. It was alright. Next, we split an order of the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka, their most suggested menu for their pasta. Ours were slightly undercooked for my taste and the sauce was very zesty salty. It was good. Not great, but it was alright. But were both dishes worth +$25, um... no. The ambience was ok but the tables for smaller parties were all stuck together and it wasn't the most spectacular experience. Lastly, with the check comes a few slices of the marzipan rainbow cookies. 

The price is unavoidable because it is Vegas but it's a shame that it was such a lackluster dining experience. Because -  the restaurant was so beautiful. I just wish it had been a more memorable experience. The cliche music kind of kills the authentic vibe and the cuisine.",wMuDRWVYiW9MsryTfyayXA,0,0,3,T9k04FqNhUdHQpPf6NfzDg

I love beets and I know my beets. The perfect beet salad actually doesn't need a whole lot of dressing if the produce is high quality. Their beet salad was doused in oil, and the flavors just didn't sing. Also the beets lacked the wholesome earthiness... I kept searching for flavor without much luck. 
For my main, I had the spicy rigatoni vodka. It was good but I've had better. The pasta was cooked inconsistently and the sauce was just ok. 
For the price of the meal, I expected to walk away more in awe of the food. Even though I am a vegetarian. That shouldn't be a cop out. My husband loved it - and I'm sure the seafood and meats were delicious. I was disappointed.",ohGSJMtYC_C6-8vPOmw4yg,0,0,3,XqjHD8YbSytpuoqlHCUTZg

If you are happy payiing $64 for Veal Parmigianna -- which comes with absolutely NOTHING else -- then this may be your place. And the Veal arrived ""barely"" luke warm, with the cheese on top unmelted. Really? Is the kitchen serious with this presentation? Our group found the food lacklustre, compared to MANY other Itlaian Restaurants we have visited in both Las Vegas & other communities. $28 for an appetizer portion of Linguine Vongole, which had precisely 6 SMALL clams on top. $17 for a chopped salad that was ONLY lettuce, radicchio, endive etc. They do provide a VERY TINY piece of Parmigiana cheese at the start of your meal --- perhaps, literally, 1 inch square ---- along with some excellent bread. At the end of the meal each guest gets a single 1 inch square piece of Italian wedding cake, & a shot of Limoncella. Big deal.  You will also have to do a LONG search on the wine list to find bottles under $100 --- lots in the $200-$400 & $1,000+ range. So glad we did not waste money on a higher priced wine, on the food we received. Will keep it to drinks at the bar, & never eat there again. Especially since the speakers in the dining room were turned up sooooooooooooo LOUD that it made conversation unpleasant.

The menu is huge ( just the size of the menu, unfortunately when you open this giant menu, there's only 20 menu items listed). 

I ordered the linguini and clams. There was so much pepper in the dish that you couldn't really taste it. That was too distracting. 

The others in my party got the lobster ravioli. The dish seems small (4 ravioli's) but I guess you're paying for the lobster. It was inside and outside of the ravioli's. It was good but nothing to write home about. 

We did order the banana bread which is done flambé table side which was cool but the server didn't cook down the liquor enough so that was hard to eat without feeling that you'd be drunk from eating it.

2970767,2016-02-25,15,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Carbone is like a set piece stuck in the Goodfellas universe and I'm not mad about it.  

My fiancé and I had reservations for 9pm on a Friday, we got there early and sat at the bar. They have a great bar space with an amazing cocktail menu and great selection of wines and whiskies. After ordering drinks and a snack-a-tizer, we were informed that our table was ready early, nice! 

Just a heads up, before you order an appetizer wait until the pepperoni and bread plates arrive and then decide if more snacking foods will be in your future, because these plates of meats and cheeses are so delicious will take every ounce of your ""goomba"" willpower not to eat it all. We didn't know this and ordered an appetizer at the bar which, when placed on the table along with the pepperoni and breads, makes it look like a commercial to hype up foodie tourism to Sicily or South Jersey.  

We went with the ""Prosciutto and Mozz"" to start and it was incredible, the mozzarella comes out hot and is cut with scissors right in front front of you, truly old school. You get three types of prosciutto, and they are all great. Salty, spicy, paper thin and not too greasy. 

After the orgy of spiced cured meats, breads, and cheese came to an end it was finally time to eat dinner. My fiancé and I split our meals, first up was the Tortellini Ragu, handmade pasta stuffed with ricotta and swimming in a rich Bolognese sauce. I personally loved the tortellini, but my fiance wasn't a fan, it was cooked perfect just past the point of being under so the pasta was still firm with small snap and the Bolognese ""fugget about it"" If could, I would have asked for a glass of the stuff to sip on afterwards. 

Next up was the Veal Marsala, which we also shared; they brought it fully carved tongs in tow, so we could just serve ourselves. This was like butta, tender, juicy and with only a slim hint of guilt as I indulged in this tasty meal. The mushrooms, fantastic, the marsala sauce, again it was drinkable. 

Throughout the entire night, the service was on point and the timing between meals was almost mechanical, it was just that good. No egg noodles and ketchup here, just pure New York Italian food.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,37,25,5,3my1pjKEuNoq6gpVjdd9ag

Pasta was al dente and the sauce was delicious. The disappointment came from the veal Marsala. I've never had such a grisly piece of meat cost so much. It was chewy and could barely be eaten. My mom and I were both forcing pieces down and they were fatty and chewy and gross. My mom and I decided it was time to leave bc the food was so bad. We did not complain bc we figured it was pointless (I had my baby with me and we didn't have time to deal with speaking to a manager.)  I do not recommend this restaurant for anything but pasta and drinks. Save your $64, skip the veal, in fact, save $200, skip the restaurant and go somewhere else altogether. 

Our ""captain"" waited too long to check on us about the veal for us to complain, otherwise we would have said something.

All though it was good, I don't think Il Mulino has anything to worry about.  Basically a red sauce joint that was way too expensive for the quality of their food.
Was a beautiful room wih very good service.  The main reason i did not go back to Il Mulino is that they ""house u"" on the wine list and there is no corkage fee allowed.  At Carbone they allow you to bring a bottle at $50, Magnum $75
The wine that i brought, 2005 Leoville Las Cases was actually on their wine wine list for $825.00!  Generally when a restaurant has the same wine and vintage, they will not allow you to open up your own  bottle.  The som. was real cool because of it being my birthday.  Ok
    However, the food was just good and outrageously expensive.  For 65 bucks u get a Veal Chop Parm that was kind of small and a little soggy.  Whatever the fish was (supposed to be like Branzino) for 60 bucks it was good but tiny.  At Il Mulino, there Branxino is roasted in salt and filated  (spelling not right and a little risque) and is big enough for 2 people.  Plus 100 times more flavorful.  Incidently, best Veal Park is at Buddy V^s in the Venetian.  42 bucks WITH spaghetti.  Every otber place charges like?15 just for a side of pasta.

We sat and was immediately greeted by a gentleman in a purple suit who asked about drinks. We brought our own wine ($35 corkage), and he opened it up for us. No offer for a decanter (it was a great Cab), but then again we didn't ask for it either. 

After that, nothing for a solid 10 minutes. It was strange. The gentleman was pouring drinks for other tables so we figured him to be the sommelier. I flagged down someone and said no one had been at our table for 10 minutes, just the somm. 

Turns out, the ""somm"" was actually our waiter. He came back over and took our order. He was a very friendly Frenchman, with an accent and did a good job of the service overall. 

We ordered the Caesar salad, the lobster ravioli, the steak and potato side. 

Food quality was excellent. Turns out there was a ""problem"" with our steak, so they brought a spicy rigatoni vodka dish as a tweener for us complimentary. That was fantastic. 

Steak finally came (took an extra 20-30 minutes) and it was fantastic. Perfectly cooked. Same with the potatoes. Found out later the steak was $120, so glad it was done correctly! 

They provided a comp dessert as well for the hassle. We went with the lemon cheesecake, fantastic. It all got rounded out with some almond cookies and limoncello. 

Overall, this was a very good restaurant with high quality food. The service was a bit spotty in areas, which was kind of a drag for a $350 dinner, but they did try and make amends with some complimentary dishes when the steak took a while to bring out.

Dinner for two, reservations. I didn't like our original seating and asked to be moved. It was no issue and they gave us a nice booth. The service was outstanding.

Octopus for apps. They bring three varieties of bread plus proscuitto and parmesean cheese. The captain looked like Tina Fey. She was knowledgable and very respectful.

For entrees we got the spicy rigatoni and lobster ravioli. We're not heavy eaters and found this to be enough food. If you like to pig out then I recommend one more appetizer. We did have an issue with one of our entrees and they took care of it immediately.

I would highly remommend this even if you remotely like Italian food. It's worth the price you pay. Thumbs up and will return every time I'm in Vegas!

of excitement!
We were sited at a huge booth, that would sit at min 6 and possibly 8 people. 
Forgot to mention, I called the restaurant before we came and asked if they had langoustines, after I was placed on a brief hold I was told that I am in luck and they have them.
When we got to our table and a very energetic waiter came to greet us I asked about langoustines and was told that they don't have any....
We ordered drinking and appetizers.... the aged cheese and bread were provided by the restaurant, and w lovely Caesar Salad ( made at the table), really tasty octopus ( highly recommend)  and baked clams ( tasty) we had began our celebration.
When you read comments of people who say that portions are huge and there is some to take home, please keep in mind they are referring to the least expansive pasta dishes... I have seen them being served to other table and they were huge.
The best dish for main course was ordered by the birthday girl ( thankfully) and it was lobster ravioli. They were delicious and we all enjoyed a little taste of it. My husband orders seafood stew.... the red sauce was overwhelming and killed the taste of all the seafood. The rest of us ( 2) ordered shrimp scampi and side of cream of corn w truffles.
The shrimps were gigantic and that is all I can say about them.... there was barely any sauce and they would have been way better served chilled w cocktail sauce. Years ago I had shrimp scampi at Cheesecake Factory and I have to say, they were way better...
There was no panacota  ( Italian desert that was on the menu, but not available), so we left after the main course.
I was not impressed w most of the food and the bill
was over $500.00
One could say, you knew it was a $$$$ restaurant.
I agree and would have never mention the money, if the food would worse it.
Here at Carbone, Aria, it did not worse it....

We indulged on bread and cheese and then ordered a beet salad. We also split the rigatoni a la vodka. That was more than enough food. But we couldn't pass up the dessert cart so we shared a carrot cake with ginger ice cream and a lemon cheesecake (another recommendation by another member of the bar staff). Why did I eat so much? Because it was divine! Also, a group of women who were starting their bachelorette party showed up while we were there.

3332753,2016-05-13,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"To begin, I'm not usually a fan of the family style dinner; but Carbone nails it.  Unlike other Italian restaurants in Vegas where the family style screams portion sizes, Carbone's family style simply means sharing is caring.  All meals are delicious and better shared, though they are not as large as one would expect for the price.

We had a party of 5 and began with the caesar salad which was prepared in front of us.  Very good presentation to see how it's conjured up; the anchovies were a great salty addition to the salad.  Next we shared the chicken parmesan (off menu), pesto pasta, rigatoni, steak, and bass.  The rigatoni was as advertised; truly a great tasting meal, albeit small in portion size.  The steak was marinated and cooked to perfection and the chicken parmesan was perhaps the best rendition of the dish I have ever had.  The bass and pesto pasta were average.  To end we had the cheesecake, tiramisu, carrot cake, and chocolate cake and shared all.  The carrot cake was a must try.  The chocolate cake was solid but could have been more mist rather than dry.  I was disappointed in the cheesecake because as a New York restaurant I would expect the best, but this cheesecake was lemon flavored and creamy more than moist, resulting in a lemon tart-tasting dish.  

Overall the meal was very good and recommended for an Italian excursion on the strip.  I would simply order and not resort to a family style type of atmosphere, personally.  The prices are high but honestly not outrageous for the strip.  They also have an outstanding Italian wine menu (though disappointing beer menu).

Issue that stopped me from going to 5 stars. I got stuck at a table with a fake plant drooping over me. Did not like that much. I also found out after our dinner that there is a much nicer dinning room in the back. You have to ask to be sat there when you make your reservation.

I was hoping to grab some food prior to the show and after a bit of searching I saw this joint pop within a reasonable walking distance to the show. I also recognized the name from its chefs and figured it was worth a shot given I had not had the opportunity to partake in their food before. This joint is located in Aria and it is quite the ""old school"" traditional feel with the red accents in the room making me feel I was walking into a mafia den and waiting for someone to kick down the door to use their tommy gun.... Maybe ive been watching too many movies. But I digress, the service is on point and quite friendly throughout the entire meal and we were seated promptly for our dinner reservation.

As part of their opening plates, they provide a basket of bread, a small plate of salami, and some pickled vegetables which was a nice touch. The bread basket was delicious with the focaccia being quite delicious and my favorite. The drinks are plentiful here with a fully stocked bar so they kept coming throughout the meal. After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the famous meatballs, the famous rigatoni, and the veal Parmesan dish. The meatballs were out first and they were juicy and packed with flavor. Really solid meatballs and a great way to start the meal. The rigatoni was cooked great and perfectly al dente with the sauce being made really well making you yearn for more bites of it. You can choose to add a protein to it with a charge of course. The veal Parmesan was massive and came out with good presentation with the bone on the side. The veal was cooked well although I wish the meat was a bit more tender but I really appreciated the fact that the breading was not too overpowering. We were stuffed with the  meal after these dishes so were unable to try the dessert but it looked solid as well.

All in all, this is a solid spot for dinner and definitely hits the mark for just good solid traditional Italian food. This is definitely worth a visit if you are searching for this criteria and a spot worthy of its location in aria.",3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA,4,4,4,PkqBD0QoUuxiQOeUwwp3xA

Menu has old school classic coctails like Rusty Nail, Manhattan,  etc. The waiter was really looking out for us. I told him that the bartender forgot my limes with my drinks and he offered to break his legs. The waiter is definitely customer oriented. LOL. 

 I was disappointed that they didn't have Malbec or Red Zinfandel on the wine menu. Really the only disappointment at Carbone.  I like Red Zin especially with red mest and red sauce. Seemed limited in that aspect.  We did order a bottle of Failla Pinot which was excellent based on the sommelier recommendation. 

Baked clams with 3 different types are what you'd find in an  NY style italian joint. Crabcake was placed on top of artichike heart. Lemon zest inside and was the best eva.

I had a classic tableside caesar with ""medium rare"" croutons. Fresh & flavorful. 

I wouldn't go to this place without ordering the Lobster Ravioli. DARK Green pasta stuffed with fresh chunky lobster on a cream sauce. But wait...They topped the plate off with tons of fresh lobster on top of the lobster ravioli. Unbelievable.  Imagine the best ravioli you've ever had. This is about 4 steps better. Really. Big green soft pillows of heaven. I could probably eat that ravioli everyday.

We also had ribeye, veal and ribs.  Cooked to perfection. We had the scallops too. Very good soft scallops in a lite sauce with herbs. I thought we ordered veal marsala but it was in a demiglaze. It may have beeen ordered that way because there were several veal dishes. All very good but the Ravioli should make everyone's bucket list. The waiter gave us a hard sell on the acorn squash. I'm not a fan but the acorn squash was like wow. I wouldn't go there without ordering the acorn. It was truly amazing. Topped with a cream sauce and pumkin seeds. 

Ended with a shared piece of carrotcake with ginger frosting. Very good. It seemed to resemble a bunt cake in the form. It was topped with dehydrated carrot strands. Very good with a unique texture. 

The meal wasn't cheap luckily one of my company's partners paid the bill. It is pricey but I'd spend my own money going there. 

Ps. They had regular garlic bread (crunchy and dripping with butter) and focaccia garlic bread (very soft and pillowy).

If the food  or the bill doesn't give you a heart attack then you'll really like the place. Overall it was a memorable meal. I just wouldn't expect to do.much after eating there outside of loosening my belt and passing out. You'll waddle out of there and back to do your Vegas thing.",8H90RHp-lL2KXwOFR8ATCQ,2,0,5,izx34VpzY9-68daBn9wfoA

Just a few touches need to be smoothed out (had reservation - still waited appr 30 min. couple of things on menu not available) I chalked this up to the newness and still ironing some kinks out. No penalty here, more on that in a minute. 
We had:
- Lobster Ravioli - perfect - elegantly served but not over the top - with delicate perfectly sized pieces of lobster in a cream sauce, with light pieces of fresh ravioli - superb dish
- The proscuitto appetizer with pieces of mozzarella cut while you watch - excellent
- bountiful bread dish and a waiter trolling the restaurant with an enormous block of reggiano of the best quality. and finally...

the reason for the five star rating is the Dover Sole - $100 portion (whole fish) absolutely for two or more, was the finest I have ever eaten and the presentation tableside by Michael was flawless. A show in itself that left your mouth watering for the taste and absolutely didn't dissapoint.

The cocktails were excellent, wine pairing well done, desert was very good although not up to the dinner in my opinion but still good..

Dinner was a feast, the service was excellent, (the staff being well informed, experienced, and enthuiastic) and the ambiance of the main dining room (the red room) was perfect. Clearly there was much experience and thought put into this place.

I gave this 5 stars because 4 was just not enough to describe our evening so I gave it the five in the anticipation that the couple of corrections needed will be improved soon

FIRST, they bring you some items to snack on before you even order. Fresh parm, pickled veggies, salumi...all yum... BUT the carpaccio, the CARPACCIO - truly to die for. Best I've ever had, it's a bit different but fantastic nonetheless. Next, at the waiters suggestion, we had the spicy rigatoni vodka - perfectly al dente, great flavor-a simple dish yet so delightful!

That said: THIS PLACE IS FIVE-STAR

From the dark, brooding ambience of the 'red room', to the impeccable service & the food-- my god, the food...Carbone was an A-level experience.

Listen, I'm keeping this simple. I had the white fish special ($86) - I call it 'white fish' because I can't remember the name. A+ Yelper right here, y'all. 

I began my meal with some 'mini- Scottish Lobster' scampi. Once again: don't remember the actual name. It was $64 though & delectable. There were three. That averages out to about $21.50 for each mini lobster.

I could've bought, like, three halibut steaks at whole foods for that price. But I won at blackjack earlier in the night, so I ordered the Scottish mini-lobsters. Don't regret it.

Italian food can be hard to break any barriers because the nature of it values old school tradition. However, Carbone has managed to bring Italian dining into the 21st century without disrespecting the integrity of it. Its a hybrid dining experience. The serving vessels themselves remind you of Grandma Nonnas but the food is reinvented and served with the most high quality wait staff you could ever dream of, some even being prepared table side that almost conjures a hibachi type dining experience.

I've eaten here three times now and Deon (Dion?) was the most talented waiter I have ever had in my life. His passion for the food, the branding, his colleagues was obvious and translated to his talent of executing a very memorable dining experience

3970160,2015-11-16,19,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I joined six friends to try this new restaurant in Aria.  We ordered:

Double order of Caesar salad
Assorted baked clams
Foie gras
Fettuccini con funghi
Spicy rigatoni vodka
Spaghetti Julien
Meatballs
Veal parmesan 
Chicken Scarpariello
Lasagna verde
Bananas flambée
Carrot cake

We were started with two types of bread and each got a piece of parmigiano-reggiano.  We were given menus and then we waited.  It was approximately 45 minutes from sitting down and getting menus until our order was taken.  The captain was busy with other tables and other things and we just waited.  

After ordering, it was not long until the first items came out.  The good items of the meal were the Caesar salad, the foie gras, the spaghetti Julien, and the carrot cake.  The Julien had a very good mixture of flavors that was interesting and quite tasty.  However, there was not one pasta that was cooked anywhere near al dente.  Everything was overcooked something I wouldn't expect from a neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone one in a major Strip hotel.

The poorest example for a dish was the lasagna verde at $75.  It is a large container.  It's cut and served by the captain.  The dish, however, was ruined by the burnt top.  Evidently it was put under a broiler to brown the top but someone blackened part of the top and it permeated every taste I took of my share.  As soon as I tasted the lasagna I said, ""This doesn't taste good.""  When our group doesn't finish everything on every serving plate--and the last piece of lasagna was not finished--you know something is wrong.  We finish dishes.  Not burnt ones, however.

The room was quite loud.  It was very crowded and the noise from conversations filled the room.  The music was great.  It was from my era--basically from 1955 to 1965.  

From the 45 minute wait, one can tell that service was a little lacking.  One thing that hit me wrong in the beginning happened when the captain was going over the specials.  He held a box with two large white truffles and he waved one of Carbone's rather large menus over the truffles so we could get the rich smell of the truffles.  I thought it was very patronizing.

Two of us at my side of our round table had a blast of cold air coming down on us throughout the meal.  We both wore our jackets for much of the meal.  

Having spent $100 including tip, I felt more than a bit disappointed.  There are so many very good Italian restaurants on and off the Strip that are doing better cooking than this and charging less.  Fool me once!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,34,19,2,NGQK_nbmvQXTwPsxulC7eg

3982437,2016-04-22,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I have to say that this was the only downside to what was otherwise a stellar weekend in Vegas with my older brother and stay at the beautiful Aria (which I highly recommended in another yelp review). The average score was because Carbone did some wonderful things out of the gates with being met by a waiter, a sommelier and floor Captain all of which were very accommodating at the beginning. They made recommendations which typically I will lean towards as I believe they are in the know and also began by bringing us some fresh made salami and parmesan cheese which were complimentary and delicious. As it was my brothers treat (I had night two at Prime at Bellagio) he chose an excellent bottle of Italian red which must have been incredible as we split two (don't judge!). Well we started with Captain's recommendation which was to have their caesar salad which is made table side and per his words, the best in Vegas. From my experience I concur, it was delicious. Next course, also a recommendation from the Captain was a rigatoni with meatballs which, again my brother and I shared equally. And again delicious. This is where unfortunately for myself and later both of us, our experience turned. It seemed as though they may have lost our entree order in a busy shuffle of many big tables or rush of new orders or what have you and truthfully, we may not have noticed except for the fact that the Captain came by not once but three times over a 30 minute span to tell us our entrees were coming right up. 
They eventually arrived with my brother having Veal Parmesan and myself opting for the Captain's recommendation of their unbelievable Short Ribs entree special. I must say that I am a short rib aholic (don't judge) and will try them pretty much anywhere and anytime they are recommended. Call it a sort of pavlovian response to hearing the words spoken; short rib and I'm ordering it. Well I took my first bite and immediately knew something was not right. But I thought maybe the mealy chewy nature of the first bite may have been a bad cut? Then the second bite and the consistency of the mealy nature did not go away. And the flavor? Well I had my brother taste them after I did and without telling him what I thought it tasted like, he said pastrami? Insane right? My brother was paying over $50 bucks (don't know exact cost as my brother paid) for pastrami. And not good pastrami mind you this was in bulk. Had they shaved it over a toasted rye with mustard I may have eaten it but after two bites I was quickly feeling my appetite go away and was not able to enjoy. Well about 10 minutes in the Captain comes by to check how we are doing and my brother has almost finished his veal parmesan and I had a full plate of ""short ribs"". And yes I know folks I should have spoken up and said, dog food but after waiting for the meal with such anticipation, I didn't want to wait further. Captain did not ask if there was anything wrong with my meal which I was always taught is service etiquette 101, rather went about his business. 

A few minutes later they come and clear our plates, not asking if I wanted my full plate of ""short ribs"" packaged for my room (I believe they all must had tasted them at the pre-service meeting!). They follow up quickly with dessert menus. I order a tiramisu to share with my brother and we both order a cappuccino. The dessert and cappuccinos arrive with the check put on the table immediately with us being told they will take that for us whenever we were ready. We thought that odd that they dropped a check as A: we did not ask for it and B: We were not in a TGI Fridays or Applebee's, we were in a $$$$ Italian restaurant.

In any event while my brother and I acknowledged that it was odd, he placed the check by himself, signaling that he was indeed paying. Within 15 seconds of doing that, the Captain came by again asking if he could take the check. We were one bite in on a dessert with full cappuccino's! My brother looked at me and said the the Captain; ""you want us to pay now don't you?"". Must have another table waiting was my comment (they easily had 6 random tables open within view). Captain was caught off guard from this, apologized and ran off. My brother took out his credit card, we paid and left after finishing our cappuccinos. 

So to wrap it up, I am giving a three because I am hopeful the issues with long time tickets and frequent reminders of same as well as being given a check rather than the institution waiting for a guest to request same, were one off deals, never to be done again. I hope. The issue of the short ribs should not have happened. They were awful in both flavor and consistency and I believe all of the staff should have an opportunity to try every meal being offered that evening at pre service and their opinions be readily received without fear of repercussions from a chef. My brother gave a lower score but he also paid the $750 plus bill and had every right to. You can and should do better.",4jNVZzeYoi2AKCQZxlI3tw,0,0,3,baL6zwE1F5tn3f_JKl7NBQ

For people concerned about portion size and price trust me you are not getting Olive Garden quality for an inflated price. This is upscale amazing Italian food and you it's so good that you want more!

Bread basket. You know your off to a good start when the bread basket is so good you would be fine eating just the bread basket. Tomato bread, garlic bread, flat bread and then a side of salami, mozzarella, and cauliflower. The garlic bread is sooo good perfect flavor crispiness and we had to order more because there was a battle for it. 

Spicy rigatoni vodka was so good. Spicy layered tomato flavor with a little sweetness from the onions was so good and had just the right bite to the rigatoni and perfect sauce to pasta ratio. 

Veal Parmesan so crispy, light, and perfectly tender. They put the tomato sauce and cheese on top but didn't drown the veal so it was still the star. Not overly greasy. 

Tortellini al ragu so good little pillows of pasta stuffed with cheese and in light cheese tomato sauce was perfectly cooked. Want to eat this everyday.

Meatballs so tender, perfectly flavored, and so good with that garlic bread. Be sure to order more bread to pick up all of that sauce. Dense in flavor, but tender and light in texture. Makes you want to use all other meatballs as doorstops or paper weights from now on.

Banana fosters and tiramisu were only ok you can skip it. Everything else was so good you don't even need it.",EjyMPOlY1ebsih9afCH_2A,2,2,5,Ik4TA6Th4mjrjXzhhsNzjA

We took the waiters recommendation on some plates such as caesar salad, and meatballs..he was not kidding when he said the caesar salad was the best ever. My favorite dish was the octopus appetizer dish. I have never tried octopus that fresh with that much flavor. We also tried the spicy rigatoni, lobster ravioli, and steak. Steak was delish. We finished off dinner with some complementary spumoni and lemon liqour. We had a fantastic and delicious dinner experience at Carbone.

Waited about 15 minutes then our party of 11 was sat.  Then we waited for another 10 minutes and a server assistant came by for the drink order. We all order cocktails as we we're celebrating a birthday. The drinks took about 15 minutes to come to the table. We have been there 30 minutes and NO CAPTAIN yet. Finally here he comes... He starts telling us the specials and most of the 11 could not understand / hear him. Then he starts taking orders. After several questions and people ordering he is gone.  I ordered veal Parmesan and my wife ordered branzino. The captain says he's not sure if they have it and has to go ask. He disappeared for 5 minutes and returned. No problem we can order branzino. One of our guests never got to order his meal. Then we wait. We all were ready for more drinks... Nothing... Waited some more. We asked for bread several times. No bread. About 20 min later the apps arrive. Our guest that didn't order placed his order at this time. Food was delicious. And we could order our second cocktails. STILL NO BREAD.  Then captain returns to tell one of the guests they DID NOT HAVE LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE.  So he orders something else. About 20 more minutes go by and we still have NO BREAD. The captain returns to tell my wife they have NO BRANZINO. 
At this point we are very upset. We asked to talk to the manager. She came by apologized and said she would bring bread right out. We have now been there for about an hour and a half. I noticed another table of 5 that sat down right as we did is paying the check. They already had dessert. By now the restaurant is clearing out. It is after 10:20. We did not get entrees for another 20 minutes and they FORGOT ALL OF THE SIDES WE HAD ORDERED. This review is getting long so I'll wrap it up. DINNER TOOK OVER 3 HOURS. Service was the worst we've had EVER!!  CHECK WAS $955 after they comped off a bunch of drinks , free desserts , and comped some food.  STILL FELT LIKE IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. I WILL NOT RETURN. NONE OF IS WILL. THIS WAS A TABLE FULL OF BUSINESS REPS WHO WILL NOT RETURN. Who would subject their clientele to this.

The service is 5 stars all the way and your ""captain"" will ensure you have a great experience, not just a great meal.

They have a very extensive wine and cocktail list and I'd highly recommend the Manhattan which has a hint of cinnamon. Their Mai Tai comes with a chilled metal straw. Just another added detail that puts things over the top.

The carpaccio is the best I've ever had. Ever. The shaved truffles put it into a whole new category but just a warning, those shavings aren't cheap!

The ribeye also the best I've ever had. Although it's grilled on charcoal, it's like it was seared in a cast iron pan that was infused with flavor from over a hundred years of cooking. It was that good! You might not think to order steak at an Italian restaurant but if you are a steak lover, it's a must.

The lemon cheesecake is quite unique. It's not super dense like most cheesecakes. It's light and creamy with a velvety texture which is melt in your mouth delicious!

The shtick here is over-the-top retro Dago chic: checkered linoleum floor, obnoxious doo-wop blaring, tacky gilt accents and a massive fountain of crystal jizz doubling as a chandelier, aggressively spooging an unimpeachably Hi-Class aesthetic over everything. Basically, it's like being on the set of Goodfellas. Fabulous!

Lest you think I'm being overly snarky, their advertising confirms that ambiance is their focus -- ""Every meal deserves a captain,"" as in, this goombah lunk in a burgundy velour suit who schmoozes you, takes your order, takes your photo, tells you the specials and answers your questions about the menu. A separate ""front waiter"" actually brings you the food, and a back waiter (i.e. busser) comes around to crumb your table and refill your water glass and whatnot. Meanwhile there's also a sommelier and a cheese guy who comes around spearing chunks off a giant wheel of parmigiano reggiano...because that's how they used to do/still do in hi-class places. Even, apparently, places with linoleum floors and ear-splitting doo-wop.

Even tho food isn't the priority here, and even tho I'm not a fan of Italian, what I had was REALLY good: truffle beef carpaccio, Caesar salad, antipasti, assorted baked clams, penne alla vodka, veal parmigiana, cheesecake. Even the freaking bread basket was exceptional (thanks to the guy with the cheese wheel). Drinks were also above standard -- I had a negroni and my friend had an old-fashioned, and both were fantastic. The sommelier paired wines for us with each dish, and those were all great, too. (No wonder I feel like shit today....I just realized how much I ate and drank last night. Ugh!)

I should note that I wasn't paying for any of this, so that probably made everything taste a LOT better...as the only dago joint on the Strip MY budget allows for is the Sbarro at Ballys. I didn't even look at the prices of anything, but I'm assuming because it's at the Aria they are probably exorbitant...so be warned.
 
Anyway, I would definitely come here again, if only to sit in the fabulous bar area and sip a Campari -- but next time, I would wear some kind of chiffon frock, with my hair sprayed black and teased into a beehive. Hit me up if you want to go -- I've got a zoot suit and xtra-large jug of Dippity Do you can borrow; bonus points if there are blood spatters on your shoes. We can pretend it's 1962, and that you just got out of jail and I'm about to embark on an uninterrupted 20-year span of pregnancies. The ambiance here is so legit, it'll really feel like we fell thru some kind of wormhole. 

Until one of us has to hit the head -- the fun stops jarringly and abruptly once you enter the bathroom, which has zero charm. I've seen better guinea shtick in the pissoir at Bucca di Beppo's; step up your pishadu game, Carbone!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,13,13,4,o24xb8xPqr7Vt6QlO2jZug

4324613,2018-02-19,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Disappointing Visit This Time

Our reservation was at 8:45p for 9 ppl.   We were seated in the bar area of the restaurant about five minutes past our reservation time.  Which was fine.  It was a Friday night and kind of busy, though there were open seats at the bar.  I've been to Carbone on many occasions, as have others in our group.  We've always had an excellent experience.

The cocktail waiter who was serving us in the bar happened to come by our table and since our waiter was nowhere in sight, we order drinks from him again.  Finally, our waiter showed up about 10 minutes later and gave us this long monologue about the food & the experience.  I really thought he was going to be very attentive based on our initial meeting with him.  Well, that started to go down in flames shortly thereafter.  

He finally came back to take out order.  I mentioned that we wanted the ceasar  salad & the spicy rigatoni for the table, them everyone would add additional items based on their preference.  We ordered a few other things and then the waiter TOLD us that wasn't enough and what we needed to order.  Didn't ask, but TOLD us.  At this point, we also finally received bread & pickled veggies.  

Sometime after 930p, we finally had our ceasar salad (1st course) being prepared for us.   We ordered addl drinks at this time as well.  Drinks were finally delivered almost 25 min later and finally almost an hour after the salad, the pasta course was served.   This was almost two hours later we had just received our pasta course.  Our waiter appeared to have one or two other tables, so certainly not overwhelmed with tables.  He NEVER checked on us...the only time we saw him was when we were flagging him down to ask a question, inquire about our drinks, food, etc.  

In all of my visits to Carbone, the waitstaff has been VERY attentive and ALWAYS available.  This is what always brings me back to this place.

Well, after being there for almost two hours and no main course, we told him to cancel everything.  It was a very disappointing experience at that point.  He made up a million excuses about how he was giving us extra time during courses and he couldn't cancel anything at that time and then said we could speak to the manager.  At which point we said yes, we'd like that, he never brought a manager over to our table until we asked where's the manager that you said we could speak with?

Then all of a sudden, he's bringing out our meals...funny how the simplest courses took two hours but then once we ask to cancel the rest of our order, its ready in less than five minutes.  Then he started spilling out stories about how he wanted us to experience the dinner, for no charge, trying to makeup for his earlier shortcomings.  Something was clearly off with the kitchen or our waiter that evening.

A manager finally did come to the table and we did explain the overall experience and our disappointment overall.  She also tried to get us to accept the meal, on them, but at this point, our evening has already been ruined.    I do appreciate that the manager did her best to resolve the situation, and for that, the next time I'm in LV, I will go to Carbone again.  But in the future, if there is something wrong in the kitchen, please, as a waiter, do not try to cover it up and disappear from your guests.  You should be keeping them in the loop about whatever the situation may be. 

And to top it all off, as we were walking out, we realized, we never got our fresh Parmesan cheese.",Q-3q2Om5jkyyvP5RGaG5hA,0,0,3,8blciHPBDrpO53YwpKeP7A

So maybe we didn't get the last table, but we did get a nice semi-circle booth with the plush red velvet cushions :) Deion (sp?) was our waiter and he was exceptional. I think the wait staff has the ability to make or break your dining experience and he made sure ours was soaring into the clouds. The way he described all of the food made you feel like if you didn't order exactly what he recommended you were missing out on the meal of a lifetime. So I will say that I am glad we took him up on all of his suggestions and enjoyed just that - a truly exquisite meal that I won't soon forget.

We ordered the beef carpaccio with arugula, sliced mushrooms and truffle oil as an appetizer. Then we had the spicy rigatoni vodka with a housemade meatball* (pro-tip: not on the menu!) For the entree we had the special, which was fresh sole flown in from Holland, de-boned and filleted at the table with a lemon butter caper sauce. As a side we had truffle creamed corn with parmesan. For dessert we indulged in the bananas foster which was flambeed table-side (because why wouldn't it be?) but somehow the overwhelming flavor was still drenched in 151. Even with that minor mishap, I can't take off a star because I truly felt the rest of the food was THAT good.

Was it pricey? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Would I go again? For a special occasion :)",YP2gJfEhUftrOlES_az5zA,0,0,5,pvUo-LcMMCoLiLPV9HajYg

4382447,2017-10-07,1,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"The food is pretty good, but it's not the best option on the Strip for Italian or fine dining. 

I generally enjoy the restaurants at Aria so I was expecting to love this restaurants. For locals this is one of the easier casinos to access. The parking garage is easy to access and the walk to the restaurants isn't a long one. Aria does charge for parking though. 

With a reservation we were promptly seated. Without delay someone came by to take our drink orders and thus began what I'd call interesting service. Our waiter was nice, professional, and clearly had plenty of knowledge of the menu. We primarily were helped by what I assume was the assistant waiter who was very casual. His casual nature ranged from awkward to funny. Overall, the service wasn't bad, but it wasn't the excellent service I'm accustomed to receiving at similar restaurants on the Strip.

The best part of the restaurant was all of the complimentary items that are part of the dining experience. Before the meal we were served a bread basket with a nice variety of breads, fresh parmesan-reggiano, salami, and a marinated cauliflower. All of this was very tasty. At the end of the meal we were served rainbow cookies and Limoncello. The rainbow cookies had amazing flavor, but were very dry. The Limoncello was deliciously sweet and dangerously strong. I thought that all of this was a very nice touch and helped balance out the prices.

My husband and I shared a House Chopped Salad before our meals. It was plenty to share between the two of us and was from a basic salad. The salad included a lot of interesting ingredients and was pretty good. Next time I'd get the Caesar Salad since it's prepared tableside. For our entrees we ordered Spicy Rigatoni Vodka and Pork Chop & Peppers. The rigatoni was perfectly prepared and the sauce on top was delicious with the perfect amount of spiciness. The pork chop and peppers came pre-sliced and had a nice flavor with both the meat and the peppers on top. It was a fattier cut of meat which seems to be Carbone's style and I didn't care for that.

Dessert was the highlight of the entire meal. My friend and I shared the NY Style Cheesecake. The cheesecake was creamy and had the perfect flavor. On the bottom was a thin layer of lemon for some added flavor. I don't usually care for cheesecake, but I would never order anything else for dessert at Carbone after eating this cheesecake.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,1,3,f-5bK2Q-9eJUUjqgIqiSZg

Well duh, especially when they are charging the prices they do they better treat ya like royalty. I was seated in a huge booth and the restaurant had a ""Scarface"" feel to it aka in one of the scenes where he is cussing his wife out and the whole crowd inside the restaurant lol. Extreme Italian vibes. Meats, cheeses, and pickles were brought upon arrival instead of the traditional bread and butter which was pretty awesome. I ordered my basic 'Long Island' drink which had just the right amount of alcohol and more which I totally appreciate. I felt kinda tipsy on the first drink. Don't you hate when you go out and can barely get alcohol in a drink so you spend way extra than needed just to feel that good buzz? 

My friend was urging me to try octopus for the first time as I have always vowed to never try it but I gave it a shot and it was delicious. It was smoked and grilled and had a rich red wine flavoring to it. My friend and I ended up ordering the lamb rack special & I went for the basic angel hair and meatballs.

4458999,2017-12-25,2,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"There were some high points and some low points with our dinner last night. I would like to give this restaurant 3.5 stars, but in the absence of half ratings, I had to drop to 3. I could not justify a 4 star. 

We walked in, and the ambience was nice. We enjoyed the decor and details of the restaurant. We had heard great things and were really excited to dine at the restaurant. 

I had to drop the rating to a zero for the service. The service was absolutely appalling for a fine dining experience. First, it took about ten minutes for someone to come to our table and get our drink order. We hoped that was the only slip in our slow service. 

It took about twenty minutes from there to receive the old fashion and lemon drop that were ordered. We could not find our waiter to ask on the status of the drinks and stopped someone else to inquire. We also asked if we could order our entrees, since we were now there for a half hour without being asked to place any food order. We asked for the specials and received the list of recommended dishes. We were told to think it over, and then they would come back in a few minutes to take our order. 

Now 50 minutes in to being seated, no one came back to take our order, so we had to hunt down service again to try and place our order. When we finally were able to place our order, the waiter expressed concern with one of our dishes which would take about 35 minutes to prepare and wanted to make sure we would be ok with the wait. Well, it took us close to an hour just to place the order, so 35 minutes was nothing at that point! 

So now the high points...

When being seated, they do bring you a nice chunk of Parmesan cheese and some salami, along with an assortment of delicious and warm breads. The bread options are a toasted sesame bread, some focaccia, and garlic bread. They also bring out some pickled vegetables. It was with these little goodies that we were able to wait over an hour and a half to get any food we ordered on our table. 

We ordered the tableside Caesar salad, which was arguable the best I've had. The croutons were scrumptious, and the salad was well seasoned and dressed. The Parmesan cheese was also generously sprinkled. 

We ordered the double lamb chops and the veal Parmesan. Both were good...neither were spectacular. I did enjoy the three sauce options that came with the lamp chops. 

Finally, we did not order dessert but were brought some Italian cookies and an after dinner liqueur. 

The special touches of the extras were a six in terms of stars. The bread basket, the Parmesan cheese, pickled vegetables, salami, and the dessert and liquor were really really nice touches. The service detracted from the overall experience. Our Caesar drove the ratings up again, but the lamb chops and veal Parmesan were about a 4. 

The friends we dined with had come two weeks prior and raved about the service they had before, so maybe it was just an off night with the wrong waiter. Had our service been what we expected of this restaurant, my rating would have been between a 4 and a 5. It's worth giving it a shot in hopes that you do receive the service you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber.",rvXXTD-_rbLu5mLDTTQcRQ,2,1,3,PwAACd9NT7eQEq-m-D0Gpg

Service is superb. Complimentary bread, pickled cauliflower, and spicy salami when you get seated. They also come around with a cheese block for fresh Parmesan. I decided on the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka because Yelp said so ;) and because I was ready to devour carb after a week of salad diet. My boyfriend got the rack of lamb, this dish is MP but I believe it came out to be around $85. PRICY but seriously the best lamb dish I ever had. We also got a side of asparagus. All of the dishes were amazing. Seasoned to perfection. Rigatoni sauce on point. The portions are not huge but sized right. We were definitely full afterwards and no room for dessert.

It's dimly lit with Frank Sinatra songs entertaining you in the background. I had the ever so popular Rigatoni in a spicy vodka sauce. It was pleasant and the pasta tasted fresh but it honestly wasn't all that I expected it to be. 

The Tiramisu came for dessert and while it was nice to try a new version of the delicious classic, I felt the hints of orange from the Grand Mariner were too over powering and the dessert itself was more of a drier cake than the traditional creamy goodness you would expect. It was a Nutella Tiramisu but I didn't taste much at all, not enough to redo the original recipe. 

Service was on the fair to good side, I was left alone a little too much for my liking and would have preferred not to have to wait endlessly till their return before I was able to ask for something. 

A little glass of Limoncello was offered at the end as well as a bite of a rainbow cookie. Both lacking the right flavors in my opinion. For a total bill of $86 for one person it felt a little much for the food I received as well as the lack of attention and amateur behavior from the hostess.

4593204,2016-05-27,2,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"There are a lot of things to love about Las Vegas, but perhaps my favorite is its in-your-face artifice.  Carbone is a perfect example of this.  It's only been open for 8 months or so, but it proudly flaunts a totally phony sense of history.

Sorry, Carbone, but I see through your act.  Even with antique chandeliers and Noo-Yawk-accented staff, you're still in a trendy hotel-casino on the Strip.

Artifice aside, Carbone is actually quite lovely.  I dropped by on a Saturday night for dinner at the bar -- which is a good option if you're can't score a reservation.  (The dining room was packed solid, but the bar wasn't busy at all.)

The bartender wasted no time taking my drink order (Pinot Grigio -- my happy wine) and bringing me a whole array of complimentary goodies to nosh on, including an enormous breadbasket (with traditional, pizza, and garlic breads), pickled cauliflower, salami plate, and parmesan pieces freshly chipped off a giant slab.  It was all very over-the-top, and it put a smile on my face.

Next, I had the beets siciliana -- a simple but delicious dish of red and yellow beets.  This is also a nice, healthful alternative to the richer, more gluttonous items on the menu.

For my entree, I had the spicy rigatoni vodka, which I enjoyed, but not as much as the beets.  I was actually taken aback at just how aggressively spicy the sauce was, and the pasta itself was a bit overcooked.  

For me, even okay pasta is still enjoyable, but the main reason I was annoyed by the pasta dish is that Carbone's prices are completely out of control.  I completely understand that the Strip is a high-rent district, but charging close to $30 for a small handful of simply prepared pasta seems ridiculous to me.  I guess that phony sense of history costs mad money to maintain.  

Despite my cynicism, Carbone is still a fun and tasty place for a night out.  As I was leaving, the bartender brought out some complimentary marzipan-like cookies, which were a nice touch and made me want to go back.  Maybe it's not all artifice around here.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,5,5,4,GlGJgDI3ybsyOSF4pgU5Hg

The bar and restaurant's ambience is gorgeous and the feel to the bar is upscale, yet very very social and down to earth. I easily made several conversations with folks around me and vice versa. The bar chairs were very comfortable and set up to maximize your comfort if you choose to eat at the bar.  This was the 2nd time I've eaten at this restaurant, but first time at the bar. 

Started off with a beet salad and the carpaccio.  Both were very good.  Bernie recommended a white wine that was spot and paired extremely well with my apps.   For dinner me and my friend split the cherry pepper ribs, pork chop and spicy rigatoni.  The ribs, well we were told that they were from a pig.  No way. These ribs were from an elephant or a dinosaur.  I've never ever seen ribs this big in my life.  The size in and of itself had my eyes bulging out.  They tasted even better.  Cooked perfectly, very tender and the dry and wet rub combo had a perfect balance of sweet and slightly spicy. 

The pork chop was cooked medium plus and came out perfectly. It was very tender and had a great moist flavor.  Combining pieces of the chop with the pickled peppers it came with gave an intense flavor.  The rigatoni was cooked perfectly and had great flavor with a light spicy-heat finish.  For dinner Bernie also recommended a red wine that has possibly changed my life (ok too dramatic, but seriously, what an amazing wine I discovered). It was Brunello Di Montacino 2010.  I've already called my local liquor store and reserved a bottle of it.

For dessert the carrot cake was like everything else, great.  Very moist, with great flavors of ginger, carrots and cream cheese. I can't wait to come back. In a town with insane competition, Great job Carbone.",NUjtjJd5Pex6uODSDOHaKA,0,0,5,ivvXT-i_6ZKEQkeYG9kEvw
4642826,2016-02-15,2,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I was really excited to try Carbone and it didn't disappoint. We had a hard time picking just a few to try but settled on the carpaccio, spicy rigatoni vodka with meatballs (latter not on the menu but a house specialty), and the whole branzino. I loved everything except the fish.

First off, the bread basket, to me, was just average (too bland and the garlic one was too oily) but the real star was the pickled cauliflower. A little tart and a little spicy! The salami on the side was a nice surprise too. The carpaccio appetizer might be my favorite one ever, and I've had a lot. Great flavor, great texture, and I think the quality speaks for itself. I could eat this all by myself. 

I can see why the rigatoni is a classic because it really is perfectly done. Al dente with an exceptional sauce. The meatball is solid but I think I still prefer Rao's. 

The brazino was where the meal went slightly downhill. We had some fish scales and bones which didn't make for a great experience. I also thought that for $95 a whole branzino needed something more than just a fish with three sauces. Luckily, the ""captain"" provided great service and comped the fish. I don't think we would order again even if it was prepared properly. It's just not worth the $.

We'd love to return but will stick with the starters and pastas. Also, I have to mention that service is really slowwwww, so prepared for the long meal!",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,4,3,4,RE5TY-_p5g_VBR1yVGdh-w

They wouldn't seat us until our entire party was there, so we sat in the bar waiting for our table. We were totally late for our reservation but they didn't even blink an eye.  The service was amazing and the food was very good. 

They kept pushing us to order family style, and said we would have way too much food if we didn't. The pasta and salad orders were not large so this didn't make sense at all. They also were pushing us to order a bunch of entrees to share, on top of the pasta orders we were sharing. This didn't make sense to me since we had some vegetarians at the table, and the entrees were all meat. We ended up ordered one of the steaks to share since some of the girls wanted a protein. I get why he was pushing the entrees so badly. This was the most expensive steaks I've ever seen. I've been to many steak houses but was surprised to see on the bill the steak for $135! I was expecting it to be closer to $80. We didn't ask what MP was for the steak when we ordered and they didn't offer up the information.

I think this place is great for a nice meal in Vegas but make sure you ask what MP is before you order so you know what you are paying. They will push family style but if all you want is pasta then there is no need. Also, they charge for refills on soda, which is a bit messed up.

The bread basket was soo good! It was served with picked vegetables and salami. We were shocked to find out it was complimentary and those little things can go along way. My date loved the pickled vegetables and I loved the pizza bread.
Our next course was the chopped salad. There was something spicy and finally figured out it was the bell pepper! It was a welcomed surprise and it was fabulous. I wanted to take home the dressing, it was so good!
Our pasta course came next. We had the spicy rigatoni and fettuccini al funghi. The portions aren't huge, as described by our waiter, but they were definitely perfect for sharing. Our entree course came next and we ordered the peppered ribs, Louie potatoes and the acorn squash. The ribs were hugeee and tender. There were only three and they laid on a bed of kale, tossed in that delicious dressing from the chopped salad. I could only eat half the rib, it was a bit too rich for me, but also extremely delicious! The Louie potatoes are where it's at!",-uk4wYCSmjWz8vH9XkqroA,3,3,5,mVom8Pg5_rogNNlLz-v7aw

Then you meet your captain, we had the honor of being served by Dion Bennet the man is perfect. Simply perfect. So with the service being impeccable, we ordered some dishes:

The beef carpaccio, Caesar salad, lobster ravioli, veal Marsala, tiramisu...

Each dish was excellent, a little too salty on the beef carpaccio but otherwise felt like you were eating tuna sushi, that good. 

The croutons in the Caesar salad were amazing as well as the whole salad was perfectly prepared table side. 

The lobster ravioli was excellent and fresh. Another fabulous dish. 

Finally the best course of them all...the veal Marsala!! This was the best preparation of veal Marsala I've ever had the pleasure of having. 
OMG. Worth the visit right there. 

The ribs were also an amazing treat. Unreal how good they were too!

Finally the tiramisu was good not amazing but not bad either. Wish they had fresh Italian cheesecake or a strawberry cassata cake like the Grotto at the Golden Nugget downtown.

The coffee was excellent and easy to drink straight black without cream or sugar. Very aromatic and tasty. 

In any case what an amazing meal topped with Italian rainbow cookies and limoncello to finish. 

Couldn't be happier and can't wait to go back.

If you look at my previous review you will see it was Top Shelf and 6 months later as we return for our second foray we come hungry and excited... The excitement didn't ask to long as from start to finish this is an absolute unmitigated disaster.   We are seated and the complimentary really top shelf bread and cheese and salami is put on the table.  15 Minutes go by were 1st ones in the place at 6PM before someone comes to take our drink orders....  Wine sommelier comes and we settle on wine... 15 MORE MINUTES wine arrives we are 1/2 hour still waiting for our 'PRE DINNER COCKTAILS"" ...  FINALLY arrive as we tell the wine steward to open and let the wine breath.    I drink a particular high end whiskey neat while another at my table has a cognac.   They mix drinks up as we both take our sip we both gag as this is not what we were expecting and I don't drink Cognac.   When we notify our waiter.. What does he do.. walks over grabs the glass from my buddy grabs my glass and SWITCHES THEM... ARE YOU SERIOUS... I'm Upalled.   STRIKE 1 and a big one..  No Apology NOTHING just incompetence 


Order our meal and as we are told previously its ... Appetizers / Salad / Pasta / Entree just like it's on the menu.    OK... Well here comes the Salad guy... and I ask our waiter why are you making our ceasar salad 1st.. His short abrupt nasty answer is Well thats they way the food comes out.. Pardon we just discussed a few minutes ago the order and how it will be spaced and timely.    He says ""If you don't like it you can talk to the manager"" I'm about to lose my cool until my buddy calms me down.      Salad bar is now vacant as our appetizers arrive.. and GUESS WHAT not 10 seconds after appetizers are put on the table he makes the salad which is to be shared and actually has the audacity to hand it to me to start passing it around the table..   NEVER IN MY LIFE have I seen this and now I'm on Tilt.   I ask for the Manger and now ""SANTIAGO"" our useless waiter is missing in action rest of the night we never see him again.    Manager comes over didn't get her name pleasant Asian women states ""WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU"". Sorry for everything so far.  

rest of the meal passes in real active peace aside from the fact the Chicken Scarpieloo was 35.00 worth of Blah and ""Santiago"" talks us into too much food that will go to waste..  And it took 25 minutes to get more garlic bread.. ""THE KITCHEN LOST THE TICKET"""" ... Yea ok..... 

So now it's time for the check and the We took care of you...  Bill is 100% exactly what we ordered... when I find he Manager an ask what did you do for us... her answer is I you can't make this stuff up.. Well the rest of the meal was peaceful wasn't it... Honestly at this point I'm so dam angry that I simply tell her We will never be back, not that she cares but honestly the price points are so HIGH the service has to be on par with what they have the nerve to charge for very little food.     And aside from excellent clams, and very good not great veal Parm this time, the balance of food was mediocre at best and the Spicy Rigatoni which I raved about last time was in short a major disappointment. 

Would not be surprised to see this place fail in the near future as IT SHOULD. I have never ever in my life been treated so rudely with no apologies whatsoever from anyone up and down the line... Medicore food, Horrible service and a 0 STAR rating....

4865681,2017-11-20,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"We were really looking forward to coming here on our annual trip to Las Vegas. My husband researched many restaurants and ultimately chose this one due to the menu and positive reviews, and in the weeks leading up to our trip he mentioned many times how excited he was to go to Carbone. Unfortunately, what we experienced was not quite what we had hoped for and we believe the primary reason for that is that we were younger than most of the crowd there and it was assumed we would not spend as much money.

We were seated at a small, two-person booth that gave us a view of our section and the restaurant's fun decor that paid homage to old Italian restaurants. Keith came over right away and provided us with fresh parmesan cheese, and explained a bit to us about the menu and then shared that our server would be right over. After a few minutes and no appearance from our waiter, Keith took our drink order and then reassured us that again, our server would be right over. Forty-five minutes after being sat, the server had still not come to our table and instead spent his time schmoozing with every other table in our section, including those that had been sat after us.

In that time, Keith came back to us and we ordered our food through him and also asked to speak to the manager. It took the manager another 20 minutes to come talk to us, and by then our server had stopped by to make us a caesar salad and finally introduce himself. The manager wasn't much help and instead thanked us for the kind words about Keith (who we talked up because at that point, he was the only reason we were still there) and told us he'd take care of us when it was time for dessert.

Overall, the food was everything we hoped for but we were very disappointed by our experience. Unfortunately for the restaurant, we were prepared to spend much more on our dinner had we received reasonable service and actually been treated with respect like everyone else in our section. The two stars on this review is solely for the delicious food and the excellent service that Keith provided, but I couldn't give more than that based on how negative we felt throughout our time at Carbone.",qO3dqgyGqBNztN7kEKHp7g,4,0,2,OIMktHrT-Wc690apvk_JiQ

While waiting for our drinks (which was not long at all) I surveyed the room. Every single employee was dressed beautifully. The restaurant itself was elegant.

Sizzling Pancetta
Spicy Rigatoni Vodka

NYC's Carbone makes it to Aria.  Serving I-talian (Americanized Italian food) with 1960's panache.  Maroon jacket clad ""table captains"", table side preparations, Sinatra playing overhead, and a stunning dining room to match.  Unfortunately, the journey to yesteryear is gonna cost you.  Prices are out of line surpassing its NYC location.

Incorrect preconception that I-talian is unpretentious and fun perhaps but $6 golf ball size meatball, $27 handful of pasta with tomato sauce, $65 veal parm, $200 porterhouse steak for two?  You draw your own conclusions.

Tip:  if you want to eat family style, ask the table captain to make recommendations.  Certain dishes are large and can be shared.  

About the food, the meatball is just OK. Tender and juicy braised in a flavorful sauce but lacking seasoning.  It relies on the sauce to flavor it. 

Prosciutto and Mozz solid.  Mild, thinly sliced prosciutto and hand pulled, mildly seasoned mozzarella with torn basil, EVOO and fresh cracked pepper, a pleasing finger starter.  The carpaccio, acceptable.  Thin slice of chilled beef topped with a EVOO and marinated mushrooms.  While pleasing, both dishes lacked intensity and a wow factor.  Even the EVOO lacks any kind of intensity (black pepper notes, bitterness, acidic grip).

Veal dishes are well made.  The marsala and parmesan both nice cuts, perfectly cooked, tender and milky.  The marsala properly cooked off and imparting a great woody flavor, the acidic tomato sauce on the veal parm, improving the natural sweetness of the veal.

The standout dish was the surprisingly simple spicy rigatoni.  Perfectly cooked, giant rigatoni enveloped in a tomato vodka sauce.  It's spicy but the flavor of the chili shows through and is well balanced by the gently acidic tomato sauce.  Austere and a joy to eat.

Service borders on slow even by European standards.

Good wine list focusing on Italy.  High Vegas resort markup.

In the end, OK but other options exist hailing from NYC.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,21,14,3,bQFLa1eEWWT0Psc6ZpHPNQ

I've been here a total of 3 times with each experience better than the last. I will first say I have never made a reservation to dine here, I always sit at the bar. With that being said, the bartenders, Kirk and Robert have made every meal here memorable and enjoyable. They also make amazing cocktails so that is a plus. There is a lounge area where you can order drinks while waiting for the bar as well. 

When you sit down you are immediately served with a plate of salami, cheese picked from the cheese wheel, pickled cauliflower and garlic bread. My two favorite, must order dishes are the Caesar Salad and the Spicy Vodka Rigatoni. The salad is brought out and tossed fresh in front of you and topped with a Parm and the best garlic croutons (white anchovies can be added or served on the side). The Spicy Vodka Rigatoni is always fresh, perfectly cooked and the sauce is makes every bite better than the last. Add a meatball if you think you'll still be hungry. As for appetizers, I have had the Octopus Pizzaiolo (sous vide and then grilled) and the baked clams (served 3 ways). Both are great starters. Dessert! Everything you could wish for to satisfy your sweet tooth comes on a dessert cart for your choosing. The banana foster is really great and they made it tableside for your viewing!

I'm not sure if our particular waitress (Team 4) was having an off-night but she was pretty rude to us. Her facial expressions alone were comical as she was supremely upset that she couldn't force us into ordering anything. 

We simply wanted a quick meal, and I get that maybe our table might have not been as profitable as her other tables, but get it together or ask for someone else to serve us. We had a gluten-free diner with us and it took quite a bit of questioning to figure out what to order. We each ended up ordering the spicy rigatoni which is the sole reason I am giving them 3 stars. This dish is out of this world! I ordered the meatballs and that was pretty filling as a whole meal.

So if you don't want the full review - I have a quick overview right below:

POSITIVES:
-Start you off with a Parmesan chunk from the wheel
-Variety of table bread, pickled cauliflower and salami
-Meatballs
-Tableside service for multiple dishes including Caesar Salad
-Lemon Cheesecake
-Complimentary Limoncello (digestif post dinner) (vodka, lemon, sugar) they leave the bottle at your table along with Italian rainbow cookies

NEGATIVES:
-Service was awful
-Taste like BOX pasta 
-Menu is super small so very little variety
-Wine prices are absurd
-Sommelier only directs you to expensive wines and doesn't bother asking questions to pair food properly, what's the point?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

APPETIZER:
*Foie Gras Veneziana $45
Two pieces of foie gras that were seared to melt in your mouth.  The foie gras was silky, buttery, umami and I was pleasantly surprised that the accompanying sauteed onions didn't overwhelm the foie gras but definitely complemented it.

ENTREES:
*Spicy Rigatoni Vodka Pasta: So I asked the hostess that walked us to the table, the busser and the server which of the pastas do they like most and all three said this one.  Okay, ordered it and almost spit it out.  WTF.  The pasta was way too al dente, definitely did not taste homemade, was really dry and plain and the sauce - where was the spice?  So I know you're probably thinking my idea of spice is really spicy and it's not.  I can't handle much spice and what I tasted was some super bland onion powder tasting pasta.  Gross.  Took 2 morsels and left it on the side of the table.  
*Gemelli di Rabe: fusilli pasta with a pesto sauce with tomatoes and broccoli rabe.  The pasta was not too al dente this time but it's helpful the pasta was a lot smaller and the rabe was bitter but not too bitter.  It could use some additional seasoning - salt, pepper, cheese, pepper flakes, something.  

*Pro tip: Order the meatballs.  You get 3 large ones to an order for $18 and they are super tasty.  I would also ask them to make sure they come out PIPING HOT because ours were definitely room temperature.  My friend and I were saying that if they were hot, they might be the best meatballs we've ever had.  

WINE/SOMMELIER:
We wanted to get a bottle of red wine, preferably a Cabernet and he asked me what the most recent wine I've liked is and I said Worthy Cab 2012 (about $30 retail).  So he pointed me to a dozen Napa Valley bottles that were $250-$1,000 a bottle!  I mean I'm not trying to spend that much and there were no descriptions or additional questions on tasting notes, what we are ordering to pair it properly or anything else.  So after some discussion of what we were planning on having for dinner I opted for a Brunello in our price range which was under $150.  I asked the sommelier for his opinion on 4 Brunello bottles ranging from $100-$150 and he picked the $150 - I'm seeing a pattern here.

DESSERT: $15 each
*Lemon Cheesecake: It's pretty lemony but not in a bad way, it sort of cuts through the richness.  It also has a nice thick graham cracker crust which I appreciate.
*Tiramisu: It isn't your traditional tiramisu and it's a fairly dense cake and it has layers of nutella instead of the espresso soaked lady fingers.  I was recently in Venice, this is not tiramisu.

SERVICE:
Our server Santiago was meh.  I struggled to tip 20% but I did only because the team he worked with made up for his terrible service.  He was barely attentive and after my replacement pasta order he didn't even come check on it until I waved him down from our booth and I was already halfway done.  I need grated cheese and pepper because again, food is so bland here.  

VERDICT:
I would skip this place simply because the food was not that good.  We spent $500 on two people and I really hated our whole dining experience, mostly because of the lack of service we received from Santiago.  My friend isn't as picky as I am and he even thought it was a pretty low level of service.",KCV-jezsN2Zy-UvI8vPhyg,3,2,3,e-z5KiSivmc_NQf5XVSjSw

5225057,2016-01-03,1,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"One of my earliest Las Vegas influences was my Aunt Ann. She had married an owner of a car dealership in Alabama and his favorite thing to do was to hit the tables in Las vegas in the mid 1960's to about 1975. A great time to be high rolling in Vegas if you ask me.  She regaled  me with stories of seeing  Sinatra at the Sands and Elvis at the International. Fine Dining was the Golden Steer and The Bacchanal room at Caesars where the ""wine goddesses"" would pour wine and massage the necks of male patrons right at the dinner table!  Many of us today want to go to Las vegas and try to find that vintage experience that sadly doesn't really exist anymore, until now. Ladies and Gentleman I give you Carbone Las Vegas...located at Aria just across from Bardot Brasserie and near the entrance of Zarkana. The original Carbone is in New York City and has another outpost in Hong Kong. On October 19th I was given a behind the scenes tour of the latest location in Las Vegas just before opening night. The restaurant is stunning to say the least and much larger than the New York branch. The bar area dining room is beautiful and clubby, done in palm fronds and blue similar to that of Bouchon at the Venetian. The Main dining room detailed in crushed red velvet and gold is simply stunning. the star of the dining room  is the over the top Murano crystal chandelier repurposed from a now defunct Ferrari dealership. The private dining rooms are elegant and inviting. As you walk in to the foyer you are greeted by three exceptionally beautiful hostesses and a large portrait of Christopher Walken behind the reservation desk. At 5:oo on opening night guest number one was your truly. I was held at the door because they couldn't  get the music to play in the dining room. The music was powered by an Aria issued iPad that didn't want to work. At 5:10 the music finally started to play. The first song was Day-O by Harry Belafonte. I was escorted to the bar as the first ceremonial bottle of champagne was popped. The bubbly was poured into a wine glass as they could not locate the champagne flutes as of yet.  My companion had a business function at the Mirage so I thought I would experience Carbone by myself, but I wasn't alone for very long as Louie Carbone, cousin of founder Mario carbon greeted me and congratulated me on being customer number one. He presented me with a china dinner plate that was hand made in Italy and  just like the ones they use in the restaurant as a memento. The food was outstanding and the service like none I have ever  had before, but had been told about by my Aunt. Table side preparation of fresh handmade buffalo Mozzarella  caesar salads, and Bananas Foster are the norm at Carbone, they can't wait to wheel a cart over to your table with some time of delightful preparation ahead. Carbone is like a scene out of Casino, The Godfather, or Goodfella's, glamorous, retro, and how the rat pack dined. The food was outstanding in every way. Dinner starts with some complimentary items that hit the table quickly. A few chunks of the best Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese I had ever tasted, a bowl of Giardiniera, imported salami and Italian bread. That's before you order anything! I started with the table side Mozzarella and prosciutto. Louis Carbone made mine fresh and hand cut the mozzarella with scissors. He hit it with some oil and  and it was heaven on a plate. The pasta course was next and it was with out a doubt the star of the show. A simple house made  Spicy Rigatoni  ala Vodka that was simply the best pasta I've  ever had. The main course was next and it was grand indeed, a bone in Veal Parmesan that is matched by no other. Terrific from the first bite and massive as it covers the plate. I was only able to get through about a quarter of it before my stomach said, enough. My usual end of meal Irish Coffee was in order but this one was presented deconstructed at the table with all of the ingredients for me to make it myself. Evidently deciding  that you are done eating at Carbone isn't an option. I was goaded in to trying the table side bananas Foster  as a must do experience at Carbone, ""Mr. Oldham, you cannot leave until you have had the Bananas Foster. I figured if I didn't get it I would be escorted to a private room in the back where my kneecaps may be pummeled. Yes, bring the dessert cart! Yes, it was better than the version that  had at Brennans in New Orleans and they invented the dish. Unfortunately two bites in I was through. Just couldn't handle another bite. You think dinner is over? It's not over until they say it's over. How about complimentary bottles of house made Grappa and Limoncello? all you can drink, they certainly know when to bring it, when you are are stuffed like a toad. They put in my record book, (yes, they keep a customer log) that I was customer number one and listed all of my likes and preferences. Pretty cool huh? Very expensive, but an over the top Vegas experience. Enjoy!",w_7hcrI4Yj0wm26u4GRDUg,3,2,5,pVMAQhcsNV2sOy3ksInT5w

They also provide fresh cheddar that they grate in front of you straight from the block. Guess what else they give you for free? Salami and pickled cauliflower. What else?! Marzipan dessert and a bottle of limoncello!! So yeah this place is pricy but if you take into account how much you're getting on the house, it's really a pretty good deal! The pasta is so fresh and rich!! No complaints about the main entrees. The one negative comment for this place would be their Nutella tiramisu.

Besides the beautiful decor, you'll be equally impressed with the food and service.  Nothing was left to chance, thanks to our fantastic waiter captain, Chris. 

After the tasty, complimentary bread basket and salami, we started with the most amazing mozzarella, which Chris had specially done for us, as it wasn't on the menu.  

Next, we shared a fantastic squash agrodolce, which is baked squash, topped with mascarpone cheese, agrodolce sauce (butter and sage based), and pumpkin seeds...not only was it magically delicious, it was also prepped table side by Chris.

The Linguine Vongole, which arrived next, had that delicious clam taste you're always hoping for, amidst perfectly cooked pasta.

For our main course, we had the 60-day, dry aged NY Strip for two, which was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of pink, resulting in delicious chew after delicious chew.

When the dessert cart parked at our table, it was hard to resist the bananas flambee, once again, prepared table side by Chris.

Desserts:  grapefruit w/sorbet (refreshing), lemon cheesecake (nice), chocolate cherry something cake (lacking a bit of intensity).   When we got the check the nasty surprise was $100 for the sole!

5253311,2015-11-19,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Another fantastic restaurant in Las Vegas. New at the Aria hotel, there is much buzz about this place as this NYC restaurant has seen much success since its conception. This place reminds you of old school NY - elegant, cozy, and inviting. Excellent wait staff that really knows the food and will let you know if you are ordering the right amount of food for the table. The wine list is extensive and the cocktail menu is old fashion in a good way (think Manhattan and Old Fashioned). You really can judge any restaurant by the quality of its bread basket and this place offered some delicious variety of bread such as the YUMMY focaccia bread, garlic bread, and just simple sour dough bread. Also they shaved some complimentary parmigiano reggiano and bought pickled cauliflower to the table. 

FRESH OYSTERS / SPICY RIGATONI: We ordered fresh oysters to start - the oysters were fresh from Long Island, which at first I was like ""Oh, really...hoping for a mix of some from the west coast given that we were in Vegas"" but it absolutely did not disappoint...it was sweet and had a nice kick to it from the pepper condiment atop....and plus I'm a bigger fan of the East Coast oysters anyways. We also shared the Spicy Rigatoni pasta which they conveniently split the order for the table and this was some of the best pasta I've ever had...perfectly al dente, simple, creamy, and delicious. I was in heaven.

GRILLED SCALLOPS / CHERRY PEPPER RIBS: For the entree I ordered the Scallops. At this point, I was super full (must be all that bread). The scallops were cooked perfectly and had nice grill marks so you really taste the light char but still have the inherit sweetness and saltiness from the scallops. The dish was accompanied with shaved zucchini which I don't think did much for the dish (perhaps shaved picked cucumber would've been a better choice). Think what really threw me off was the cilantro, mint, and basil all together in a dish. Definitely had better scallop dishes in other restaurants, but nonetheless, still great and no real complaints...although don't think I would order it again next time. Perhaps will go for the dover sole. My boyfriend ordered the Cherry Pepper Ribs as recommended by our waiter which looked absolutely mouth-watering delish. He was only able to eat two of the three ribs since they were massive.

NUTELLA TIRAMISU: OMG. This was like so good on every level. So after you're done with your meal. They bring over the dessert cart of all their special desserts and I really can't fit any more food in my body but once they said TIRAMISU and NUTELLA all in one sentence, we had to order one and IT WAS AMAZING. LIKE SO AMAZING that I'd have to order this every single time.

Upon receiving your bill, you get some complimentary rainbow cookies and limoncello. Wasn't a fan of either. The rainbow cookies were very disappointing (maybe because I just had the nutella tiramisu...or maybe because I'm from Brooklyn) and the limoncello was too sweet.

Having watched Carbone open to gratuitous fanfare from more than a dozen writers and industry folks the New York import had knowingly comped, it was not until I was able to gather a group large enough to properly sample the pricy Aria restaurant that I hazard to make a reservation, the results of a nearly three-hour meal with six friends far less impressive than any of the 'media' will openly pronounce.

No doubt a splashy space, the original channeled for much of the lavish design and showy tableside service from Captains shining in red, Carbone is the brainchild of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and famous for high prices for traditional ""red sauce"" classics the Las Vegas iteration raises the stakes even higher than the Manhattan original, a $64 Veal Parm and $75 Lasagna a mere tip of the iceberg on a menu with prices not displayed out front.

Clearly trying to evoke an dining environment rare to be found in Las Vegas in the year 2015, entrance to Carbone begins at a podium of smiling young faces in front of a painting of Christopher Walken and with Rat Pack classics playing a bit too loudly overhead those with reservations are quickly whisked through an elegant lounge to one of three large rooms, the center featuring circular enclaves and several large tables with a central chandelier that speaks volumes about the restaurants intentions and unrepentant opulence.

Championing the slogan ""every table deserves a captain,"" a concept is inherently flawed by tableside shows preventing him from appropriate steering the backstaff flow of traffic, it was nearly forty-five minutes holding enormous menus close like blankets that passed before orders were finally taken, and somehow avoiding to topple unused wine glasses while reaching for a complimentary selection of antipasti the first bites of the meal would actually prove to be some of the best and most interesting, the acid-splashed cauliflower simple yet refreshing while cured meat alongside three breads were all quite delicious, the saucy focaccia particularly quite addictive.

Breaking the menu down into four-courses, though presentations of five plates requiring a show saw things slightly more staggered, round one included nine baked clams in 3x3 preparation alongside two steaks of foie gras amidst onions plus sauteed peppers and although the former proved a bit unwieldy for sharing while the liver was unctuous and well portioned, all attention was drawn to the tableside preparation of ZZ's Caesar's, a $42 double-order highlighted by the buttery croutons and sardines that was otherwise quite standard.

Taking macaroni recommendations from a Public Relations executive and adding in personal preferences plus the anecdotal experience of others, course two featured four different pastas along with seven off-menu meatballs, only the $150 White Truffle Tagliatelle proving appropriately cooked al dente as thinner noodles bordered on 'mushy,' the meatballs no better or worse than would be expected for six dollars each...and certainly not enough to compensate for the uni-tinged Julian's great flavor being marred by such a failure in execution.

Onward to entrees, the Chicken Scarpariello suggested by a local Italian restauanteur undoubtedly performing the best of any savory as spicy sausage provided a decadent nest for the juicy half-bird, those enticed by the famous fried Veal Chop will be happy to know that the $64 tab is mostly justified by both size and virtually perfect execution, the same not to be said of a $75 loaf of lasagna far too heavy handed with green peppers beneath a top that was actually too bitter to be enjoyable as a result of being burned.

Enjoying the company and conversation far more than the food as the clock inched toward ten it was finally with the dessert cart parked tableside that a concluding duo was selected and treated to fudgey Rainbow Cookies and complimentary Limoncello as we watched bananas flambeed tableside it was with good fortune that both the boozy fruit over ice cteam and curl of carrot cake succeeded where other plates had failed, each textbook in execution and large enough to share at comparative bargain of just fifteen dollars.

** Admittedly early in its Las Vegas lifespan and no doubt a place that will drum up tourist dollars and praise from the press to whom prices and service are tilted to please, Carbone offers a unique dinning experience compared to anything else currently on The Strip, yet failing in several basics of execution from kitchen to captain it simply is not nearly as great as it currently seems to believe.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,29,16,2,f4LeG8xAEJGG5VPVqF9ZMA

Normally the price mirrors the quality of the food, not in this case. Not only was it over priced for its quality (which was mediocre) it was also taken over by very large amounts of garlic. So much garlic on the Ceasar salad that everyone who ate it at the table immediately said ""Whoa, there is a lot of garlic in this!"", all you tasted was garlic. 
Garlic, garlic, and then some more garlic. There is so much more to Italian cuisine than garlic but that was forgotten about at this restaurant.

5468883,2015-12-10,1,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"I headed in with a guest that was visiting from Asia after hearing some very positive reviews from some friends. The meal started out fine enough with my order of wine and our starters. I thoroughly enjoyed the garlic bread from the bread basket, the salami, and the pickled cauliflower. However, the pizza bread was a bit soggy. We later realized we were not offered the chunk of Parmesan that our neighboring tables received. 

We had an order of the baked clams which were a bit underwhelming. I think they tried to overthink things, but the clams basic clams with garlic and some lemon were the best. We had the lobster ravioli and rigatoni vodka for our pasta. It took a few times to flag down anyone to get some shaved Parmesan for our meals. They were tasty enough, but weren't mind blowing by any means. 

Our server was super inattentive and when I needed another glass of what I initially ordered, he brought out something completely different. He never even came out to check on us after our entrees were served. When it came to pay the check, we did get our Italian cookie, but were not offered any limoncello or sambuca that were offered to other parties. It took way too long to process our payment. 

All in all, I'm pretty sure that I won't be back... the food was okay, but the service was terrible for a high tier restaurants. They won't care since they have plenty of convention business with guys that have big expense accounts and have players that don't care about dumping their comps. Based on the lack of response by management on Yelp, I highly doubt they care about these reviews anyways.

Comparing to Chicago Italian fine dining options, this place is the pits.   
We had zupa di pesce and ribeye, both are normally good options at Italian places. 
Zupa was just ok, sauce lacking complexity but edible. The steak was of really poor quality - about 40% fat and garnished with..... wait for it..... cubes of fat! Really. Who does that. 
They also forgot a side of mushrooms we ordered.

Main dishes took longer to be served than usual and some dishes like the pastas were overly salty. Ribeye, octopus, raw tuna, meatball, fish, and caprese were excellent. Drinks were pretty and well made, but nothing special. 

Service started out great then he ignored us halfway into our dinner and never even came by again. Pretty rude since they didn't seem that busy, but at least there was help to bring us our check. 

They seem to try to motivate you to order more than you need, but don't. The plates, though fairly sized, are filling. So just choose what floats your boat.

5529463,2018-01-16,56,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Totally loved the old school vibe of the red dining room and kinda felt like Scarface sans cocaine.  We were seated in one of the cozy booths on the outer area, which offered a great view of the beautiful center chandelier and patrons drinking their Xmas eve away with wine.  

""Prosciutto & Mozz"" was a remarkable starter with 3 cuts of cured pig (Parma, Americano and Speck), which was then topped with some amazing mozzarella sliced by our table captain.  I could have loved the tableside made ""Caesar alla ZZ"", but the bibb lettuce was too large for bites, so using a knife for salad that wasn't a wedge was annoying.  I regret not ordering another hot starter like the ""Foie Gras Veneziana"" or ""Octopus Pizzaiolo"" instead.   

I knew I had to get it, but how could one not be skeptical about the famous ""Spicy Rigatoni Vodka""??  I mean.....it's just some pasta and sauce, right?  But ho-ho-hoooo-leeee shit!  This was the highlight of the evening!!!  They somehow managed to find the perfect balance of pasta chew, sauce tanginess, and possibly some secret contraband to make this absolute heaven.  Marco Carbone should wear a gold medal at all times including when bathing or asleep.  Fuhgeddaboudit!!!

The staff pushes a 3 course dinner, but we were close to the edge of full by the time the proteins arrived.  In hindsight, sharing just one item from ""A Piacere"" or totally skipping it and going with three appetizers/pasta/split dessert would have been a better play.  Maybe even ask to see the dessert cart at the beginning of the meal to make sure you're down?  

The captain bills the ""Shrimp Su'modo"" as their scampi, but the 3 huge shrimp were chargrilled, which made them a bit tough and dry.  I thought they were good, but my wife wanted a juicier, softer prawn, so she didn't like it.  I would have eaten more of that, but was way too wrapped up in my own ""Pork Chop & Peppers"".  The boneless cut was outstanding and was presented almost like a porterhouse while the center had a wonderful meaty, fatty chashu quality to it.  I would have preferred hot peppers over the sweet ones it came with, like how Rao's does it, but that's my own fault for not asking.  

Seriously ready to go back now for the rigatoni alone though!  I'll be sure to have a better dinner the next time around now that I have a feel for the place.   So say good night to the bad guy!!!

Small props to the grilled octopus app, which was very nicely done. The service was just ok. App came out way too early..we just barely got our bread served before the app was plunked on our table.

5674567,2017-09-25,1,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"We've been really good at choosing restaurants lately, because once again we had an absolutely amazing experience at Carbone!

I am not one to just go to the Strip and am just as happy at local hidden gems, but I am certainly glad we decided to eat at Carbone. This was our first date night after baby was born and my Mom was nice enough to babysit so we could enjoy a few hours out of the house. We were also celebrating my birthday and I was excited to be able to enjoy a glass or 2 of wine with dinner.

We both love Italian food and were excited to try out this restaurant. We made our reservations via OpenTable and notated that we were celebrating 3 special occasions - the birth of our little one, our recent nuptials, and my birthday. I guess we like to cram all of our celebrations into 1 dinner!

Carbone is located on the 2nd level promenade of the Aria Hotel and Casino, adjacent to the buffet. If you are staying on the Strip, I suggest walking or taking a cab, because Aria does now charge for parking and the restaurants do not offer validation, even if you are a local resident. This restaurant is an import from New York City, where they've had a popular location in Greenwich Village. 

This is New York inspired Italian food and not what you would find in Italy. But don't let that scare you off, this food is AMAZING! When booking our reservation, I specifically requested a quiet table in the ""red room,"" which is located in the back of the restaurant. This is a more romantic area and it didn't disappoint. We were seated in a small booth and felt tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the casino. 

We decided to start with a bottle of wine and chose a reasonably priced red. I think the Sommelier was silently judging us, but isn't that what Sommelier's do?! The servers are called ""Captains"" and ours was fantastic. He suggested quite a few of his favorite dishes and explained what their signature items were.

The server's assistant brought out a small bowl with various pickled vegetables and also a selection of breads, along with oil and vinegar. This was a great start to the meal and a strong indicator of what was to come. 

We decided to share everything, starting with the Caesar Alla ZZ salad, which is something they are known for and is prepared table side. Let me tell you that this salad did not disappoint! Both my Hubby and I agreed that this was by far the best Caesar salad we'd ever had. I am fairly positive they put crack in that dressing - it was so delicious!! It was fun to see it prepared right at our table as well.

Next, we went with a pasta course - the spicy rigatoni vodka. This was a tough sell for Hubs because he is not typically a fan of vodka sauce. Well, Carbone hit it out of the park and earned a fan! The sauce was creamy with just a touch of spice and perfectly distributed through the rigatoni. It was a small portion, and perfect to share, but we still found ourselves wanting more. Luckily, we had another course on it's way. 

Our final course was a meat dish. Another signature dish, we chose to try the veal parmesan and added a side of mushrooms. This veal cutlet was HUGE! By now, we were starting to feel pretty full and we knew it wasn't likely that we would finish this behemoth! As great as everything else was so far, this was definitely the highlight of the meal. I am not normally a huge fan of veal, but Carbone may have changed my mind. The cutlet was perfectly breaded and cooked and the sauce was delicious. We could only manage to eat about half and took the rest home.

As if it couldn't get much better, the restaurant decided to surprise us with complimentary dessert! One was a lemon cheesecake and the other was a carrot cake with ginger ice cream. Both were phenomenal and more than half of both also came home with us. I believe my guy enjoyed the rest of the lemon cheesecake for breakfast the next day.

I've had dreams about this meal since then. I'd heard a lot of things about Carbone - the food isn't that great, the prices are too high, etc. Neither of those things are true at all. Not only was the food fantastic, our meal was less than $200. Yes, that is a lot of money, especially for new parents, but it was well worth it and included a $90 bottle of wine. This isn't the kind of meal that you eat every week or maybe even every month, but it was the perfect night for our special occasions and a wonderful 1st night out without baby. It's not often that we'll get to experience something like this and I am really happy that we splurged. It was a very intimate and romantic dinner, we both shut off our phones and neither of us took any pictures of the meal (this is a small miracle)! 

There are a lot of great dining options in Las Vegas, but Carbone gets ""it."" All of their attention to small details really set them apart from other restaurants - from just acknowledging our special night out, to a shot of limoncello at the end of the meal, this was a phenomenal experience.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,6,1,5,cy223B3hvge1aADr0KLDSQ

Spicy rigatoni, linguine with clams and veal parmesan. Everything was delicious. We picked a dessert off the cart which was amazing chocolate cake with cherries.

Carbone blew me away from the moment I walked in! Every single detail from  the delicious food and presentation, to the excellent service, and the jaw dropping ambiance were incredible. Joe the GM is a wonderful man! He ensured that we had an extraordinary time and a memorable experience! Thank you to all of you!

5792140,2018-05-09,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"This review is coming from someone with an Italian mother who lived for eight years in south Philly. 

This place is for real. It is in my top three all-time Italian restaurants. You can really tell they pour their passion into the food. I am not going to go into the food choices but from what I had, yes all the way to dessert (Italian desserts usually suck), the food was air tight. It is the best meatball I have every had. I just marveled in amazement at it wondering where it had been all my life. 

I wonder why there aren't more Italian restaurants like Carbone. It is a shame but I am fortunate to have found it as it will be my go to place for Italian from now on in Las Vegas.",fP5XwugCQmqkh5kFdPMRUw,0,0,5,1ao5HxjWbsH3O9HCFBRqkA
5794635,2016-12-20,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Normally I would give a 4 star review and rating. What got them t the 5th star for me is the table side service, the music ( all 50s doo wop and that type of music ad finally our captain, Santiago. He and his burgundy tuxedo made the night. We had a Vegan with us and he went above and beyond to make her feel comfortable at every course right along with us, the carnivores. 

The food was delicious. We did a family style sharing. The caesar said was crazy good. Made right at the table. We also had a beet salad, the beef carpaccio with the caesar salad.  . All were delicious and flawless. 

We shared the roasted chicken, the rib eye and a spicy penne. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and so was the chicken. There were no dry spots or burnt ends. 

Dessert was the lady finger cake and the carrot cake. The carrot cake was great! They also dropped a bottle of limoncello at the table for us. On the way out we met Joseph the manager. He was so nice to take the time to speak to me. He was incredibly gracious. 

Overall I cannot wait to go back and i have been telling people about it since we went. Definitely beats the hell out of the one in NYC!!",FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,0,0,5,usdAKrTELg_xe-iCjvOwyw
5798965,2018-01-21,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"We came here few months ago and had a little mishap in service which I yelped about. Andy, one of the managers, messaged me and wanted to speak to me regarding my experience. I explained to him what had happened and he wanted to make things right. I advised him we will never stop coming back since we love the food too much. Since that visit and yelp review, I kept in contact with Andy and advised him we will be returning soon..Well that night was tonight. 

Lets just say we received the most amazing service. Not because of what had happened last time, but this was the service they have always provided which we were used to. Athena was our server who was attentive and explained to us some of the dishes. She suggested for us to try something different that we never had before so we decided on the chicken massimo. We ended up ordering the chicken, spicy rigatoni, spaghetti, meatballs and caesar salad. When the food arrived we were beyond hungry and the presentation was awesome. I never once complained about any of their dishes and today was no different. Everything was spot on and delicious. The chicken massimo smelled and tasted so good, that's going to be one of our go to dishes. 

Besides the food being awesome as always, the service again was truly the high point of our dinner experience. 

Andy I want to thank you for the great food and dinner experience. You went above and beyond to make our experience at Carbone a night to remember. 

Athena, thank you for your service and knowledge of all the food and suggesting us to try something new. 

Andy we will definitely be returning again soon and thank you again for everything!!!",PcfwKJJA9-H6ZNXAqNke9A,1,0,5,eNIb0EHTk2IRIWyOFsBStA

You are well taken care of from the minute you walk in the the door until you leave.  The food portions are large so  don't be afraid to ask if you could split a meal.  My husband and I both ordered the Veal Parmesan.  Our waiter told us one order would be good enough for the two of us.   He 
also told us to do the same with the Spicy Vodka Rigatoni.  He had the kitchen plate our pasta for us. When our Veal came out he cut it into four pieces and served us each a piece on to our plate with the pasta..
There're so many little extras that they do and give to you  at this restaurant.  You have to go try it yourself to understand and get the full experience..
By the way both of those dishes were fantastic!",wyt1GgDlijypVrj59e_ZAA,0,0,5,qSbxJ9x-tuSphMXMtvu4Cg

Everything had very very strong flavors from the bread to the chicken entree. My husband loved this, but I did not. I had the chicken Massimo which was good but the balsamic was a little too strong. I couldn't eat much of it and had to take it home - it was admittedly better the 2nd day once the flavors calmed down.  The asparagus side was very good and my husband's chicken dish looked and tasted amazing. The wait staff was nice. Overall not the greatest experience but far from the worst.",GdBzz5WyQbK7ZBsw2eJiBg,1,1,3,iuzvp8tWh8nGsQnKqJdajQ

They wear a red suit but they make it look sharp.  This is authentic Italian food.  Not Olive Garden.  Bread brought to table was good.  They cut big block of cheese to but on your bread.  I could not spread it on the bread.  This may be more me though.  

I had a dish with chicken in it.  It was very good and fresh.    Wife and I both had mixed drinks.  They were not good.  Way to much alcohol.  

They last think we got was dessert.  Your captain brings a cart with dessert and it all looked great!  Besides what's on the tray they also have bananas foster.  It's was made at the table which was cool.  It was a real panty dropper with the wife.   If you are looking for a little show try this.  It was 15 bucks but easily feeds two.",x9txomt_2I-48pZWgt-uTg,0,0,4,fENhIOFAAPad32w7Arxuzw

I ordered the soupa de pisce, which is like a cioppino, for my entree. It was slightly mild and great for dipping. There was an abundance of ingredients including clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and baby octopus.
The server also brought out a whole complimentary bottle of lemon liqueur after our dessert. I'm pretty sure I could have gotten drunk from it, but I decided to have only one glass.

5944892,2016-06-17,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"One of the most enjoyable meals I've had in Las Vegas. It's as good as the New York location but better. The decor is over the top old school glamour. Although the space is large, the booths and seating is done so well that you feel like you are in an intimate space. Request a booth with curtain as it really does make the experience quite special. 
One doesn't see restaurants with table captains anymore but this accentuates the service level at Carbone. The staff was friendly, attentive without being invasive. 
Our party of four had everything as family style.
The tasty snacks you receive upon sitting are so good that I had to stop myself from overeating. Salami, pickled cauliflower and a wheel of Parmesan that gets a piece taken off for each person. Perfect 
For the meal we had:
Caesar Salad
Clams three ways (bakes with uni, clams casino and a spicy pepper) 
Spicy rigatoni alla vodka 
Tagliatelle with mushrooms 
Meatballs (off the menu)
Dover sole 

The Caesar salad prepared table side was one of the best I've ever had in my life. The rigatoni  alla vodka is just so good, I was tempted to lick the plate clean. The tagliatelle was an excellent accompanying side to the Dover sole. The sole was deboned and finished table side. It comes with a lemon butter caper and was perfect in texture and taste. Amazingly perfect. 
I wish I had room for dessert. I did however, have room for the Italian almond cookies and lemoncello (complimentary). 

The music was also a highlight. Classics but not one Frank Sinatra (it wouldve been just too hokey). Who doesn't like Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye at dinner? I look forward to engorging myself again at Carbone.",BW6y9Y9yM79DZO7E31Ri_Q,2,0,5,iWWjG-z8v-buxAK-bosHxQ
5983988,2016-07-04,0,vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,"Food and service were outstanding.  This is some of the best Italian food I've had in Las Vegas, BUT it comes at a very hefty price.  Only the value proposition and insanely loud music caused me to give this a 3 Star rating versus something higher.  Aria is a large convention casino/hotel with tons of people on expense accounts.  I get it that restaurants on the strip can charge up and get away with it, but some of the pricing at Carbone is frankly outrageous.    My only other criticism is that  with the music being so loud it was extremely difficult to carry on a conversation with our party of 5.  I like a lively, fun atmosphere and really dig the music selection, but I would equally like to be able to carry-on a conversation with my wife when we're spending over $150/per person for dinner.  While the food was memorable, I'm not sure I can highly recommend this place.  In my opinion, if you're willing to spend this kind of money go to Carnevino at The Venetian.  It's super expensive as well, but, in my opinion, a much better overall experience.  One last thing - skip the desserts.  They are underwhelming.",YjoSaXsm7xOLMKldTJJbuw,0,0,3,N64Qp1AFquz1zStNqtyNKA
