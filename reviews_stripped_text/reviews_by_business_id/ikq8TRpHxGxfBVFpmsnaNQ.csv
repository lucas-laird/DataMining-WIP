I always order a med-well burger & it always comes out as a hockey puck.  The bun would be great IF it were baked through; tis a tad gummy on the bottom.  Hit or miss with fries.  

Overall, I like the burger. Its 1/2lb & tasty, even burnt to a crisp.

As for how long it takes your food to come out, well, it kinda depends. I've noticed if you eat there food is quick. If you order to go & wait...well, you're gonna wait. I was here Monday at 11:30am & the place was pretty empty yet I waited 30 minutes for lunch.  When my order came out I was thanked & it was handed to me without my drink.  Unfortunately when I asked if I could have the drink I paid for I got an attitude.  

Whatever.  This place is at best average.  Unfortunately the options just aren't there for lunch near Court.  What is one to do?  The prices are better than Quiznos & Capriotti's (bleh) & you don't have to go thru security to get there. Way overpriced on drinks: $2 & $3.

I had the chef salad, which was mostly big chunks of iceberg topped with chopped cheese and lunch meat. It was fresh but not very flavorful. My co-diners had soups and sandwiches, none of which looked appealing to me.

1986821,2012-12-10,0,ikq8TRpHxGxfBVFpmsnaNQ,"Courthouse Bar & Grill is a decent place to get a sandwich at lunch (3 stars) with an extra star added in for good customer service and relaxed atmosphere.

Around lunchtime, you'll find this place packed.  It seems to be the center of the Las Vegas legal universe around noon.  The menu is fairly standard for a lunch place (burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps).  The food is decent, but not remarkable.  Burgers are made with frozen patties, but the fries are tasty.  The wraps are fresh and worth a try.  There's a few fried options--try the chicken fingers (which are delicious, but most chicken fingers are).  Bottom line: Courthouse Bar & Grill is a decent place to get a meal if you're downtown and don't want to drive somewhere.  If you order a sandwich, know that it'll be good enough.

As the workday ends, this place is a nice, relaxed space to grab a few beers.  It's a good, quiet place to ramp down after work.

Bottom line: the food isn't worth writing home about, but the atmosphere's laid back and the staff is super friendly.  4 stars overall.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,2,2,4,FiwNqX6KlSl0M7WTZ1wMGg

But the food is just ok.  The baked potato soup was pretty good but the southern fried chicken salad was pretty blah.  Just iceberg lettuce, some onions and bell peppers, and overcooked fried chicken strips with ranch dressing.  I've had the Santa Fe chicken wrap here as well, and it's just ok.  Nothing special.   

I got the $10 for $25 groupon for here and it's a bit confusing.  It says on the groupon that you need to buy at least one food item.  I thought that meant that you couldn't just use it for alcohol.  But you actually need to give them cash for one food item and then you can apply the groupon to the rest.  Kinda cheesy and confusing.  It's not as good of a deal that way.  So if you have the groupon, make sure to buy one food item that is really cheap, like a cup of soup, and that will be the food item you need to buy.

I work in the vicinity and you would think with Capriotti's newly opened they would be trying to keep customers not lose them.  I was behind a coworker and ordered the same thing she did.  Mine was .50 more.  Not a big deal money wise but when I say I ask for the same extra sauce when I order in and they don't charge why is take out different.  He actually argues about it instead of saying something like, ""Well, they are supposed to charge.  This one is on me but going forward there is a charge for the additional sauce.""  That I could have accepted.  Instead he must have said, ""They are supposed to charge,"" like five times.  

The kicker is when the coworkers exact order comes out which I know she was charged less for he ask her for the additional .50 because I am standing there, and I guess he wants to look like he charges everyone for extra sauce when he obviously doesn't.  At this point he's made himself look like such an ass that the other friendly women behind the counter tells her she will cover the .50 for her.

This place is located on 3rd and Bridger in the Downtown area.  Pretty standard, pub looking curb appeal, nothing special.  There's a cup of coffee sign and red awnings on the outside, a couple of tables for outside seating.  When you get into the location, you'll see the bar on the left and to the right, you'll see a restaurant for ample seating.  At first sight, it's pretty dingy.  The carpet looks pretty old, the walls are huge montage pictures of people and the table tops and chairs are light brown.  

The service is quite the opposite.  Ying, our server is AH-MAZE-ING.  She is so attentive, sweet and personable.  I was amazed to find out that she actually remembered our drink and food order the second time around.  Such an amazing server, makes you feel like you're at home.  

Speaking of food order, I got the same dish both visits:  The chicken fingers for $6.50.  You get three battered and fried chicken strips and a huge scoop of thick cut fries.  I usually get the mild hot sauce on the side as well as some ranch.  The food comes out within 5 minutes, so I know they don't make it fresh.  The fries are usually stale.  Little crispy but overall, stale.  The chicken, although pre-made, is super good!  The chicken is juicy and the batter is crispy.  Always a favorite!

The added saying, ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" is something I would say to someone who is curious in visiting.  The service and food is great and kept me coming back.
