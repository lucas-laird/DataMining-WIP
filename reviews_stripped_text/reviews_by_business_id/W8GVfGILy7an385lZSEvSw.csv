We order chicken fries and he says ""We are all out"" so my roommate says never mind but thanks anyways. As we drive off the employee at the drive thru sticks his finger out and flips us off. 
So now I'm pissed off. We go back around to the drive thru window and ask for the manager. 
the Manager did nothing and I have it all on video. 

Tried to contact Burger King headquarters but their email site doesn't work. 

Burger King needs to be shut down this is the shitty restaurant ever!

I wanted ice cream after eating some awesome Venezuelan street food, and it was too late for Luv-It. Burger King's gingerbread sundae sounded good, so I ordered one and an order of the new sweet potato curly fries to try. The gingerbread syrup was too thin, and not as satisfying as the caramel sundae. When I checked the fries before leaving the drive thru, the container was barely half full of sweet potato... nubs? Stumps? Not a curl in sight. My husband showed this to the cashier, who briskly replied, ""yeah, they're supposed to be like that, all chopped up""... and with that, we drove away.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,5,3,1,6NoRCYN-2PT2cdolSEnr3Q

When asked a simple question they pause as if your speaking a foreign language then ask you to repeat it.

It was no big, I went to the counter to have them switched out, I showed them to the cashier who obviously didn't take notice. She grabbed the tray with the onion rings on them and common sence; the hair will fly off while your move the try across the front counter area. When I told the manager Lucia , I wasn't rude at all, I just wanted the onion rings repced because Cleary saw the hair. She said in Spanish no one here has long hair. I'm bilingual, she didn't know that. The ladies there have long hair. She was rude and defensive so I gave up and just said I'd like my money back. She of course kept her attitude the whole time.

20 minutes after I get our food, it was still wrong. 

Also, so ghetto in here. Ketchup by request only. Restrooms need the key from the manager. No water available at the fountain. Yuck.
