276014,2014-01-17,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"I was a little skeptical about this food court during my first visit to Caesars Palace about 6 months ago. Upon my return visit this month, I decided to explore the options.  While the prices are a bit high (just like everything in Vegas), the portions are decent.  They do offer food to go, so keep that in mind if that suits your style.   

During two visits to the Asian place, awkwardly named ""Ah So"", I once had the seafood udon, and then the house chow mein.  Both had good flavor and the portions were large.  The seafood udon was a little sparse on meat (shrimp, squid, fish cake, etc), but they did toss in some snow peas and other vegetables as well.  They make these when your order, so it's hot and fresh. Interestingly (and in a nice way) they served the udon in a ceramic bowl, rather than plastic.  The house chow mein had a decent portion.  I took it to go and while eating back in my meeting room with colleagues, they were jealous of my plate.  One other nicety was that they offered the spicy yellow mustard.

During two visits to the Bar BQ (bar-b-que) place, the one meat plate was plentiful.  The beef brisket was tender and juicy.  The cornbread was ok, but a little butter never hurts.  Adding a side of the okra vegetable sides was a nice touch.  But together with the meat, it could easily serve two people.  We had the pork ribs in a second visit.  Flavor was still good and the meat was tender. But given that the ribs comes with bones, the beef brisket plate is the better detail. 

This is worth a return visit if I have business in Caesars.",Y8soACnXhNO2RUCLDCI8iw,1,0,4,rmnlSRDTWSglAm9L1_9now

In einem großen Halbrund bieten verschiedene Shops ihre Speisen an: Burger, asiatische/chinesische Küche, Pizzen etc. Innerhalb des Rundes der Marktplatz mit vielen Tischen. 
Zunächst heißt es, sich einen Überblick zu verschaffen. Hat man dann gewählt, gibt man seine Bestellung auf, erhält eine Nummer, die aufgerufen wird, wenn das Essen fertig ist. Mit dem Tablett auf zu einem freien Tisch und schon kann der knurrende Magen beruhigt werden.
Das ganze ist auf Imbiss-Format, also darf keine haute cuisine erwartet werden. Dafür ist es preisgünstig. Ein Hamburger kostet z.B. $ 6,95, ein Double Burger $ 8,95. Fountain Soda (Cola, Sprite etc.) schlägt mit $ 3,99 zu Buche.
Auch hier kann problemlos mit Kreditkarte bezahlt werden. Und da Selbstbedienung herrscht, kann man das Trinkgeld weitaus moderater ausfallen lassen, als sonst in der amerikanischen Gastronomie üblich. 
Fazit: Es muss ja nicht immer die große und damit teure Küche sein. Auch in einem 5-Sterne-Domizil wie dem Caesars lässt es sich preislich günstig essen.

Better food going on the strip and just walking into the food joints on the strip like Fatburger or Pinks... which get several stars over this place.

So as far as customer service, this place is fantastic.  

My selection was a seafood restaurant two eateries to the right of the BQ takeout counter.  The woman who took my order was very friendly.  The highlight to my meal was the Nuvo drink I bought, which is a combination of red wine, vodka and carbonation.  I ordered the chicken strip and fries as I felt that was f*&^-up proof... I was wrong.  It tasted of nothing but salty batter...and lots of it.  So, I took it back and asked if I might be able toswap it for the fish and chips.  She traded and didn't charge me the difference.  So again, customer service is excellent.  The fish was less salty, but very battery, nonetheless.

Hubby got the burger and fries which was probably the safest bet from all of our food.  It wasn't great, but really--how do you mess up a burger and fries?  Only downside--it cost almost $15 with a drink.

First of all, this food court is a great idea if you either need something fast or on a budget. They had a number of deliciously appetizing items on their menu like fish and chips, fried calamari, clam chowder, etc. After taking several minutes debating on what to get, I finally decided on a cup of lobster chowder. Total with tax came out to $6.41.

I thought chowder was supposed to be thick. Their lobster chowder was watery and it looked like lobster bisque. Taste-wise, it was mediocre at best. It had maybe a few pieces of lobster, celery, and lots of potatoes. While chowder may be just the ticket to cure a hangover, it isn't good enough for me to want to come back.",yhJ1SVBSjC_R2viEh5AbUA,0,0,2,9QxTUVFmlz2ccIpKrLbA5g

They delivered a top notch lobsta roll for sure!  Here is what blows my mind everything at Caesars is lets just say a little more expensive then maybe it needs to be, I don't mind because I love their poker room, I love their staff, and well I am generally their to have fun so why not spend a little extra...  This lobsta roll was $12.95; kids this is down right affordable for a lobsta roll, I would pay that, out of a cart in an alley in a major city, with out great staff and poker all around me...  I have paid closer to 20 off the side of the road in New England...  Although this was not the best I have ever had, it was right up there with the big boys of the northeast trade, and I will be partaking in one of these, I think maybe, every time I head back to Vegas from now on...  

I am not the only one, I had two while I was there, and when I was ordering my first one I was interrogating the exceptionally nice lady behind the counter and she said, oh its good, she said people come from all the casinos around Vegas just for this Lobsta roll, and she said wow do they get upset when we run out, here that?

The people saying the service is bad and slow are right though. It took more than ten minutes to get my burger and fries.
My wife was almost finished with her orange chicken before my burger came out. But for some reason, I feel like it's only that place that takes forever.

The salad / pizza place is pretty cool too because near where the line starts is a little station with salad cards where you check off boxes to say what you want. This was a neat idea especially because I don't like salads and there's usually one element in them that I hate. This way I get a simple salad with none of those gross bitter greens.

There was even some excitement.  A patron was arguing with one of the women who was busing tables.  Not sure what it was about or who won though.

WRAPS: The wraps are big but somewhat flavorless. The freshness of produce varies from day-to-day. They're alright but I wouldn't go back.

CHINESE: Semi-Restaurant / Semi-Panda Express. The fried rice is average but The black bean chicken was pretty good. All the entrees come with a hefty serving of steamed rice. At times, the quality of the chicken is poor. On occasion, instead of chicken breast, I'd get chicken gristle and bits.

FRIED FOOD: The place that has the fish & chips and chicken tenders is awesome. Then again, how can you mess up fried food? Chicken tenders are juicy and the fries are crispy but soft. Everything is fried fresh to order.

PIZZA: I haven't sampled the pizza place. But girls at the store are regulars and eat the pizza there religiously.

DRINKS: some places sell personal size wine bottles and beer, bottled beverages, and all places serve fountain drinks.

The ""make your own salad"" with drink was $14. It was a HUGE thing of salad and I couldn't finish it, but because everything was piled on the bottom of the salad didn't get any dressing.

There's a coffee shop on the very edge that sells smoothies... but it's like $6 and made from a powder and not even fresh fruit! It def wasn't worth it but we ended up using it as a mixer for our vodka later and it was pretty good...

I also got the mediterranean chicken wrap with spinach tortillas. It was a little bland and I had to use Cholula to give it some spice. The veggies were pretty fresh so that's good.

Come here if you want to get some quick food court food thats overpriced, but it's the only thing close...",gPh8rpoOq2hjyhF2pAdn2A,1,0,3,U7JL-dXLNmesYa81D7wb2Q
5374615,2012-03-23,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"this is a great food court. considering it's in CP, it's quite impressive. plenty of food options here to pretty much satisfy any discerning, yet frugal, palate. as the big sign to the entrance points out, they have... burgers, sandwiches, pizza, salad, wraps, fish and chips and of course, the ubiquitous... Chinese!

now, the prices here are definitely not similar to the other prestigious food courts located on the strip, such as Oshea's Le Whopper and Casino Royale with Chez Denny's. however, it is extremely reasonable and the quality is leaps and bounds most others. i actually had the fish and chips and they were absolutely delish. the fish was very crispy and the fries were marvelous. it was only 2 fish, but, very big. i also had some hot sour soup from the chinese joint and also pretty good. mind you it's lent, and it was friday so i had to fill myself up enough to make it the rest of day. 

the little filipino ladies cleaning up and offering to fill up your sodas and get you water were very friendly. they're not tied to one specific restaurant so tip them well regardless if they help you out. oh yeah, there's also a salsa condiment bar right in front of the mexican spot. i helped myself.. shhh!",R12GCq7XczBpP99KzenLAQ,1,0,4,YGJqZ79j4f_QZ-9_9sAeiA
5444577,2012-10-19,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"Who would've thought Caesar's Palace would have a food court in their hotel? When I first stayed in Caesar's I was surprised to find one after wandering around the casino looking for the Forum Shops and actually ran into mall type of food court and it was not that cheap and not too expensive. This is great if you want to save some money and it's seconds away to the casino. So you can gamble and grab a snack after hours of playing which is very convenient. Soda fountains are located outside of the food court, so you can get unlimited refills.

As every part of Caesar's, this has a Roman theme to it with Roman architecture, with food court seating. It can get very crowded with long lines and fully occupied tables, I suggest you wait in line to order while someone else looks for a clear table.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,2,0,4,XVatEpmdgept15ThX5odqA
5479137,2015-06-25,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"Horrible.  I ordered a salad and soft drink from the pizza place.  They charge $4.50 for a soft drink.  Then when I went to pick up my salad,  I saw it under the heat lamp cooking.  

The Smashburger place was also bad, salad was horrible, long wait when not very many people, also charged $4.50 soft drink.  No salad dressing was put in the takeout order.

Skip this one, for $15 you get food worse than McDonalds.",w4HNs_abqYF3PaHwjezbbg,0,0,1,Mvk0zU3e0yDfYymOwlzOYw
5583197,2013-02-11,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"Great expectations built up by our enjoyment of other Caesar's Palace establishments and the warm seating area.  They have a seven stars area which got me to thinking, why would a seven stars member dine at the food court.  This food court is like any foodcourt except with more upscale names.  There was the obligatory pizza place reminding me of SB___O, the chinese place, reminding me of Pa__a, a burger place, bbq, salad, mexican, lobster chowder place, and coffee/pastry place.   We sampled the pizza, lobster chowder, and BBQ establishments.  The pizza was disappointing, a poor attempt at imitating NY pizza except the crust was rubbery, the cheese flavorless and the sauce thin and watery.   The lobster place was more enjoyable although the clam chowder was bland and they didn't have lobster or lobster chowder on the menu (I think they might have a lobster roll but I don't recall, still it wasn't the focus of the menu.)  The BBQ place was not bad but the pulled pork was overcooked, the chicken portion small and it was clearly not the best quality chicken, more like KFC quality with little meat and lots of bone.  The sauce was good but not on par with the better bbq restaurants in town.

What really knocks this place down though is the management company's brilliant move making adding a combo of fries and fountain drink to your meal a whopping $6.00.  Individually the drinks are 4.25.  The cost of most of the meals are only a dollar or two more.  The $10.00 bbq combo became $16.00 with the side and drink.

I always hate places that abuse the pricing.  They would do better keeping a few extra bucks in the patrons' pockets so they could blow it at a slot on the way out.

Anyway, two adults and one child ended up spending $40.00 for a mediocre dinner.  You could do better at Serendipity 3 for a much better meal and only a few dollars more.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,2,1,2,5gulm0-mJ3hMIhUKkKvhqw
5584159,2011-11-17,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,We grabbed a bite to eat at the Pizza Slice located in Cypress Street Marketplace.  The Marketplace was clean and the bathrooms were in good condition.  Our pizza was good but the service was bad.  The lady dishing up the pizza pies skipped us all together.  She was really rude.  Next time I eat at the Marketplace I'll try a different shop.,HIeIOKwSzTra0eA2IhNBPw,0,0,3,kFWM8lFv4jeC505fX8LcfA

5659379,2011-08-20,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"Seriously, just go to Spago, or Max Brenner... any other restaurant. You will pay the same amount of money. $5+ for a single slice of cheese pizza and no drink? Yep. $13 for red, white and blue tortilla chips smothered in plastic cheese sauce and a scoop of guacamole? YEP. $13 for a basic salad? YES. 

This place is bizarrely overpriced. Why would anybody spend this kind of money on sub-par food court food when they could spend the same amount and go eat at say, Trevi?

I went here yesterday (8/19/11) on my break to the ""Ole"" station and ordered Chicken Tortilla Soup for $5.50. Although they ladled it from some container on the stove, I still had to wait what seemed like forever. I got a small square to-go container (like the kind you'd put a side salad in) without a lid, full of cumin water, mixed with a can of Campbell's vegetable soup, with two bits of chicken inside. I ordered my food to-go, so I said, ""Is there a lid that goes with this so I can carry this out of here?"" After picking around the soup, I then asked, ""Does the tortilla soup come with tortillas, or chips or something?"" The lady at the counter said yes, then took another 3-4 minutes messing around with my soup lid to try to put chips in the container of soup.

I felt insanely nauseous after eating this ""tortilla"" soup. Yuck. Save your money and go to a sit-down restaurant if you want a better value for your money.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,0,0,1,vms1pW1SqkGxv1stvPj1RA
5928920,2011-09-20,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"This food court is not too bad in my opinion. Located near one of the entrances to The Forum Shops, you could consider this place a bargain when you compare it to all the other expensive restaurants nearby. 

The one thing that really impressed me about this place is the customer service that the cleaning people provide. Every time I ate here, they have stopped by my table to give me napkins, take my trash away, offered to refill my soda, gave me toothpicks, and asked if there was anything else I needed. Wow! Really? All this at a food court?? This is the main reason why this place stands out!!

The food is kind of expensive. Expect to pay at least $10-$11 for a meal. There is a pretty good variety of food - Chinese, Pizza, Burgers, BBQ, Salads, Wraps, Coffee, etc. So far I have tried a Pepperoni Pizza slice, Caesar Salad, and Beef Broccoli, which was nothing spectacular, but also not horrible. I believe I also tried a smoothie a while back from the coffee shop, which didn't taste too great from what I remember.  

If you are in the area and looking for a cheaper and quicker option for food, this place will probably be your best bet.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,1,0,3,ZxxQA6sc-NXZxWVBadqDfw
5935909,2012-05-21,0,Lu4pQHQCRXI773PeP3PjTA,"3.5 stars...So this is also known as ""Caesar's Palace for Food Court""...I'll essentially repost what I put for that one:

Yum yum...I've only tried the pizza place and grabbed breakfast here, so this probably isn't very accurate. However, it is convenient and affordable when you just want to grab a quick bite. The calzones and other pizza-looking (but not pizza) things are a bit overpriced, IMO, but the salads are what really stands out in the food court. Giant and abundant in meats and cheeses yum yum! Bonus that you can even customize your own! 

Breakfast is a bit of a hassle...lines are long since everyone wants the good breakfast deal...($4 for oatmeal, $7 for a set meal of eggs, bacon, etc) I just got the fruit cup, but they also have nice giant plates of fruit and other goodies. Coffee is your typical cup o' joe; nothing too special. I will definitely get the breakfast specials next time I come!

There is also a really nice lady at night who gets utensils, makes sure you aren't missing anything, and even grabs ice for your bottled water. Amazing service for a food court!

Bottomline...Salads are GREAT! Breakfast specials are WOW! Enjoy!",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,1,0,4,CJf8tLF_EyynHPDsIfO76g
