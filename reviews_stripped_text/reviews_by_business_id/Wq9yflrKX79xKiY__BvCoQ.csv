My sis-in-law who was visiting from Seattle also concurred with me noting that she had not found any place that made Halo-Halo this good until now. The place is quite busy, and a bit small for ongoing traffic but definitely worth the wait. The cost is a little more in the pricey side but it is no different if I wanted to order Boba. Plus, you can choose what you want to put in your Halo-Halo. I got the regular mix. A must-try when you are near the area.",kFRcpROKtA0aZUzPPa0eAg,0,0,5,5xEfYBXXvcUbFSbS9aQJjg

I was especially excited to see a little Magnolia ice cream shop in the corner. I was familiar with the tubs of Magnolia they sell in the store but not an actual place that sells it severed like a Baskin Robbins. I wanted to try ever single flavor but settled on getting the Avocado and Macapuno Ube which was the creamiest and milkiest ice cream ever. Though you can get the tubs of these, having it served here is 100 times better as the ice cream is stored in ice cream chests and at the correct temperature resulting in the best ice cream consistency.

I knocked 2 stars out because prices were waaaay too high! For one scoop it's $2.49... One scoop!! Plus, we ordered the Halo-Halo and tbh id rather just get it from Chow King or Jolibee. Here, they use snow shaved ice rather than the regular crushed shaved ice, which makes it really hard to mix around. Also, the topping to ice cream ratio was off. The texture just so different than what I'm used to. The only thing that was good to me what the ube ice cream.

I missed that detail when stalking their IG page and found myself wandering the shopping center in confusion. Also, the pin on the map on the app is wrong, so that was no help either. You're welcome.

Once you find it, the corner location is bright, colorful, and welcoming, with a large selection of traditional flavors, and the choice of cup, cone, or halo-halo. If you don't know what that is, check the posters on the wall. You can even DIY your own to adjust the sweetness levels and ingredients.

Favorite flavors include the regular ube, which is the bomb dot com- my guy insists the coconut version is even better, but I'm a purist. The avocado ice cream is especially creamy, but thai tea and green tea weren't as flavorful as I'd hoped. The Kona coffee and mango are both pretty good, too. Toss your choice in a bowl or atop your choice of cone (sugar or waffle), take a quick photo, and dive in. Price per person is around $5.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,13,4,ld6DUErC6pB93y2PKcvzYw

I can't say I was familiar with the Magnolia brand prior to moving to Las Vegas, and ube ice cream was a new flavor to me about 8 years ago when a coworker stashed a tub of the purple stuff in our ice cream chest at work and told me to try it. I was intrigued enough to seek out an Asian market on Spring Mountain Road and see what other unfamiliar flavors I'd find in the freezer. I was still confused as to what a halohalo actually was, but I just had to buy the corn and cheese ice cream. It may have been Magnolia brand, but I'll never know. 

I ended up inside Seafood City soon after Magnolia's grand opening. It was after a mediocre dinner at a new east side restaurant and I was in search of something to get the taste of unclean fryer oil my mouth. I knew halo-halo would do the trick, but few of the toppings on display really appealed to me. The man working at the counter invited us to sample the variety of tropical ice cream flavors and the bright green buko pandan was love at first bite. I didn't care for the cashew langka, but there were plenty of interesting options to choose from.

I ordered two scoops and it was a very large serving. The ice cream was so rich and creamy, and boldly flavored. I also enjoyed the texture, because all the little bits of fruit and fiber indicate that they use fresh ingredients- not processed.

2318275,2017-10-15,11,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"Hello, Halo-Halo!

Magnolia is a brand from the Philippines. Before this place, I used to think that the only way that I could get my fix of ube ice cream was from the freezer aisle inside Seafood City. The gallons can be pricey and sometimes you just want to sample a new flavor-- that's where this place comes in to save the day.

Magnolia Ice Cream and Treats is a physical store front that sells all your favorite flavors by the scoop. Located inside Seafood City, this little ice cream shop has traditional Filipino flavors such as avocado, macapuno, ube, and mais queso are on deck. Green tea, mango, thai tea and other flavors are also delicious and can be a good option for first timers who are not ready to be that adventurous. Their ice cream quality is perfect-- creamy and rich. They even have a halo-halo ice cream flavor, but really you should just get the real thing here. Ice cream scoops and halo-halo portions are generous here, so it may be a good idea to share. 

Halo-Halo, which literally translates to ""mix-mix"" is a delicious dessert that can help anyone beat the heat in this Vegas weather. It is shaved ice, condensed milk, a scoop of ice cream (ube, ftw) with a ton of toppings. Some traditional toppings include leche flan, jackfruit, red bean, sweet bean, coconut jelly, and corn. The best part about this place is that you have the option of building your own. Don't hate me, but I'm not a huge fan of jackfruit. I know, I know cray. So, when I order my halo-halo here I usually opt out of the jackfruit and double my servings on the flan or the lychee jelly. You can never go wrong with extra flan!

The store has seating, but it's a tight squeeze in here. They have board games for you to borrow and a wall full of poloroids of all their happy customers. Depending on the day and time, there might be little to no seating in here. You can sit in the food court area right outside Magnolia. 

For first timers, you might think ""corn? nah. red beans? nah.""-- but it's so goooood. You can't knock it until you've tried it. Halo-halo is meant to mixed up, so make sure to stir your cup before you eat it. That's it, now you can enjoy your halo-halo like a pro.",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,14,13,5,ZYnT-ATBg34ks9Mp-GvwQA

Tucked away in the very corner of Seafood City's foodcourt, you can find this Filipino version of Baskin-Robbins. Yes, that's right. Instead of the classic banana split, Magnolia offers the popular Filipino dessert... You guessed it, Halo-Halo! One of my absolute favs! If you're not familiar with Halo-Halo, it's just shaved ice, evaporated milk for sweetness, and various toppings or mix-ins. A few of my favorite toppings include nata de coco (coconut gel), langka (jackfruit), pinipig (crunchy rice cereal), and let's not forget Magnolia's signature ube ice cream! Mix them all together and you've got deliciousness in a cup! There's an option to build-your-own Halo-Halo as well!

Not only does Magnolia serve Halo-Halo, they offer regular shave ice too! I've had their shave ice once and it was delicious. I love how the ice is smooth and I don't have to chew it. If I'm not in the mood for Halo-Halo or shave ice (which is rarely ever), I go for their tropical ice cream! They have a wide selection of flavors and it makes it so hard for me to choose! Flavors range from Avocado to Buko Salad to Guava to Macapuno Ube! The list goes on. Cashew Langka has been my favorite for a while now. I'm hooked! I haven't tried the Mais Queso yet, which seems to be popular amongst my fellow Yelpers, so that just gives me an excuse to visit again soon! The ice cream is rich in flavor and the portions are big!

2. You can replace anything! If u don't want the pinipig  tell them they'll replace it with anything you want!

3. Get only 1 scoop- 2 scoops will spill the damn cover. And try the ice creams before you add them to your halo halo.

4. Suggest trying the cashew- it's the best.

Lastly I would suggest trying their waffle cones too their really good and yummy. If only there's a store like this here in AZ I think people will love it. They have all the flavors that magnolia have back home.

3275505,2017-07-17,1,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"Is your face melting off from the summer heat like mine? Here's a lifesaving tip: Do yourself a favor and treat yo'self (specifically, the Halo Halo) from Magnolia. It'll make you appreciate it's summertime.

The ice cream and offered flavors here are delicious. I say this after being a fan of Messina (gelato place in Downtown Summerlin) and generally getting bored with American flavors (sorry). Ube (purple yam), coconut with pandan, mango, avocado, cashew with salted something, among others, are just a few example flavors.

But Halo Halo was where it was at. It's similar to the Seven-Layer Vietnamese dessert, except I actually prefer this because of the addition of the ice cream and the crispy rice cereal. The textures in this dessert is frikkin' fantastic - it makes eating the whole thing really interesting. (This puts the banana split to SHAME!) The layers of ingredients is altogether PERFECT - you get chewy, crunchy, creamy... and heck, it even tastes good even after it's all melted together half an hour later.

Okay, here's the other thing: Magnolia is tucked in among several other fast food places inside Seafood City, a Filipino grocery store. This place is like a museum unto itself (I love looking at the whole fish display). So you can grab something grilled/stewed at Grill City... or delectable fried foods at Crispy Town. Basically, the warning here is... don't expect to go in sticking to your diet. That being said, your taste buds are gonna be really happy!",ORI1UqfFXsNnk8KzmYK5bQ,2,1,5,I6sqOIv9-wnF5GZ3AxS_zg

Magnolia Ice Cream & Treats is a small ice cream shop located inside Seafood City - a Filipino grocery and they serve Halo-Halo and Mais Con Hielo. Halo Halo is basically a Filipino dessert that consists of shaved ice, gelatin, tapioca, langka (jack fruit), coconut and a bunch of other small sweet or savory bits and pieces then, it's topped off with evaporated milk and ube ice cream. Mais Con Hielo on the other hand is pretty much the same thing except swap out all the bits and pieces from a halo-halo with corn. Yes, corn. It's frigging amazing and a complete favorite of mine. Magnolia though, takes the cake since they finish off their Mais Con Hielo with a scoop of Queso & Mais (Cheese and Corn) ice cream. I mean come on now, how good does that sound? If you're not drooling now, you should be. 

Service is great and don't be scared to ask them to take out certain things from your halo-halo if you're not comfortable with it (for instance, I'm not a fan of jack fruit so they happily left it out). 

Sheesh, I'd give this place ten stars if I could. If only there were a location close to me, *sigh*. If you're ever out in Vegas or better yet, if you live in Vegas, this spot is a MUST try. Seriously, go on now.",zgbSBvtZrIO2A4ysQ1XfcQ,8,10,5,AlwSOvHlLA-gCNtEOckCLA

The halo-halo is pretttttttttty frickin' good. I went with the custom, choose-yo-toppings halo-halo because ___ bless uhMURRICA ; we have freedom - including freedom to build your halo-halo ^_^ Well...at least up to 6 toppings.

I'd say you MUST GET corn and the red coconut jelly cubes in there! NOMNOM! I had also chosen flan which was rich and borderline cheesy tasting to me (kinda turned me off and trust me im a huge flan fan). Topped off with a scoop of buko pandan ice cream. It was YUM! The ice was nicely shaved so it wasn't too grainy and chunky, yet it wasn't too fine enough that it was melting at the speed of light. It was just right!

HOWEVER - what makes me more uncomfortable than someone putting an ice cube down your shirt is THE PRICE! A little under $6 for a cup of ice, condensed milk, scoop of your choice of ice cream and some jellies/beans/random chewies of color??? Holy mother of profit!! Ice cream by the scoop is priced reasonably tho.

The total for 1 custom halo-halo and a single scoop of ice cream in a waffle cone for da booboo rang up to $9.55?!!? You could basically feed two people at Cici's pizza buffet for that price!

LOCATION/PARKING - it's inside Seafood City, there were no visible signs from the outside but do not fear!! Right when you walk in, make a left to the food court. Ample amount of parking. 

Would I return? Maybe when it's 1,059 degrees outside and the craving is insanely real but in the mean time looks like I'd have to start saving up now for my next $ $ halo-halo $ $",16A22OSpylVKhl-oJVXneQ,1,0,4,4VCe0L4f__Miy2IUbI1aWA

They pretty much have all the Magnolia flavors. You can choose from single to triple scoop in a cup or cone, ice cream shake, halo-halo, ice cream sliders (ice cream in between bread - pan de sal), shave ice, etc.

I got a Kasoy Langka Shake (cashew & jackfruit) and it was good! It was creamy, the serving was huge, and I saw that they put at least 2 large scoops of ice cream. I could definitely taste the ice cream flavor, and it wasn't watered down by additional milk or ice.. It was a REAL ice cream shake.

Their prices are comparable to Baskin-Robbins or Cold Stone, which I'm not sure is a good thing. 
Ice Cream Shake = $5.29, Halo-Halo = $5.59, 1 scoop of ice cream = $2.49. The servings were pretty generous though, so it was worth it.

Magnolia ice cream is known for their out of this world Filipino flavors so if you haven't tried some, you'll have to treat yourself and indulge. They're mostly found in Asian supermarkets. 

I ordered the deluxe halo-halo for $7.19 comes with a scoop of ice cream and a free ""keiki"" (junior) size also. I actually put both scoops in the halo-halo. I got the ube (purple yam) and the buko pandan (coconut). It was delicious too.

The serving in a cup for Halo-Halo may be on the small side but that's OK with me.  This is a treat that is perfect for a warm spring day or a hot summer one!  Cold & sweet, it's hard to beat!  Their Halo-Halo actually tastes better than other places around town, my guess is because of the use of their imported ingredients.  Supposedly they are flown in frozen to cut down on any preservatives, resulting in a better product.  Let's hope this is true!  Magnolia's Halo-Halo is damn tasty!

4026855,2017-01-16,4,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"Located inside Seafood City, this treat shop has become my favorite part of grocery shopping. As the self-proclaimed halo-halo queen, believe me when I say that Magnolia is a must try! I sample halo-halo at every Filipino restaurant I go to and I am constantly seeking out new places to try. So much so that my dentist said I need to stop because the ice is damaging my teeth lol... but since my recent trip to the Philippines, I have been even more crazy about halo-halo and I just can't stop. 

Halo-halo is a popular Filipino dessert consisting of shaved ice, condensed milk, and give or take any of the following ingredients: various sweetened beans, sweetened ube (purple yam of the Philippines), various fruits (jack fruit, coconut, plantains, etc), gelatin, ice cream (most commonly ube-flavored) and leche flan (Filipino version of flan). Dubbed the MaHalo-Halo, Magnolia makes a fairly traditional halo-halo except for the crispy rice cereal on the top which is less common. This addition adds unexpected flavor and texture and I am a big fan! Weirded out by beans in a dessert? No worries, your halo-halo can be completely customized to omit or include any ingredients you'd like. You can even choose what ice cream flavor to top it off with. The best part for me, though, is the ice. It's soft and snow-like. This is not typical for halo-halo; you'll find that restaurants use ice shavers that dispense much rougher-cut ice. So, thank you Magnolia. I can eat my favorite dessert all the time without my dentist yelling at me ;) The regular-sized portion will cost you around $5, which is a good deal. On our last visit, we received a free small scoop of ice cream with our halo-halo purchase (their special at the time), sweetening the deal even further.

If halo-halo isn't your style, there are a variety of delicious ice cream flavors to choose from. They've got a few of your normal flavors if you're not too adventurous but my favorites are Buko Pandan and Mais Queso (coconut & screwpine leaves and corn & cheese, respectively). Hey, don't knock it til you try it!

Additionally, the staff is so sweet! They are happy to help and will answer any of your questions if you're not familiar with the product. They are very friendly. I LOVE great customer service like this. I'll be a repeat customer!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,9,6,5,AUj5eX7uLVNHrFTbR6X1iA

On my first visit I tried the halo halo with everything on it. It wasn't the best I have ever had, considering this is their specialty; however, I think it is the best choice for halo halo amongst the immediate competition (Chow King and Jollibee). My favorite part was the ube ice cream before I did the ""mix mix."" The pinipig (rice crispies) added crunch and texture. 

Second visit, I wanted to try the maiz con hielo (corn ice) out of curiousity. I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't too cheesy at all, but a nice balance of lightly sweetened corn. I liked the cornflakes on top for texture. Just like the halo halo, I think it is best enjoyed all mixed up. 

I actually returned the next day with my mom, but did not end up ordering. It was too busy even though I tried waiting in line. Although there was only one person ahead of me at the time (5 people behind me), the transaction and time to scoop that customers ice cream took forever! Also, the girls at the counter started another transaction right in front of me for an off duty coworker. I think they need some improvements with workflow and prioritizing customers.

The shave ice in the HALO HALO is very milky and delicious! Along with all the topic that is in it, it's perfect! I must say this is the best HALO HALO ever!",dIf4QycwIDC2F2_SEF-n7A,0,0,5,l6sGzI7-9GNawkDE_R9P3Q

Ice was crushed where it melted in your mouth. Price was decent for the price ice. Their prices on ice cream alone is a little over priced. If you just want ice cream, I suggest you just get one in Seafood City",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,0,1,4,Wtcqe2C67jdHQr-_LYfkEQ
5333667,2016-12-13,7,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"One of the main reason I like going to Seafood City. Is the delicious ice cream and Halo-Halo at Magnolia.

Majority of the flavors are tropical and exotic, including:

Macapuno-Coconut
Buko-Pandan- Young coconut w/ screwpine leaves
Langka- Jackfruit
Ube- Taro(purple yam)
Mangga- Mango
Mais-queso- Corn & Cheese
Berde na Tsa- Matcha Green Tea
They have various flavor including a few common ones like strawberry and coffee.

The ice cream is very creamy and flavorful with Ube being the most popular according to the friendly staff. Your able to sample the flavors prior to deciding. 

If your feeling a bit more daring, You have to try the Halo-Halo, Mix-Mix in English. A combination of shave ice, fruits, jelly, mung beans and ice cream with condensed milk as a mixture. It's one of the most popular cold desert in the Philippines!",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,14,10,5,koObE1HVd1-IMAUpa9Rb5Q
5369636,2017-04-18,0,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"Love trying exotic deserts and foods. Magnolias ice cream is a Filipino ice cream Company. One location in Las Vegas inside seafood city in the food court the other location is in San Francisco and Hawaii. It's a very small clean ice cream and halo halo store. Halo halo is Filipino shaved ice but I was there for the ice cream. They let me sample as many flavors as I wanted which was really nice of them. No pressure and great service. I got a lychee ice cream and boka salad (a coconut and some exotic fruit flavor it was so good) it was like crack. I had to get another scoop after my initial 2 scoops. 

I'm always impressed by how a ice cream or gelato place lets customers try as many flavors as you want. I love that concept because that way you choose your favorite one. My friend got Thai ice tea flavor ice cream he liked it. All the flavors were just right for me anyways in terms of sweetness it want overly sweet like most commercial ice cream you buy or go to.  Prices are pretty good also for the serving size. Can't wait to go back!!!",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,5,n-dt90szgbdb_dh2z5W0rQ

5517559,2016-09-15,1,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"So Arnold came bock to try the halohalo. I didn't finish it. I didn't even like it. Pick your jaw up and stop gasping. Here's why, I thought when they said build your halohalo you can pick which ""toppings"" to drop at the bottom of your cup before it gets sat on by crushed ice. I'm brain farting right now because I completely forgot if your customizing your halohalo how much toppings you can have...6? It's 120am...heck let's go with 6. My assumption is you have max 6 toppings to choose from. What I discovered is you are REQUIRED to have 6 toppings. You can't choose just 1,2, or 3 toppings. It's an unfortunate deal for someone like me who doesn't not like all that jazz down there who only wants the coconut gels, but not 6 scoops of it! What's so customizing about that?! BOO! 

Also, I love magnolia ice cream...I respect its ube game...but I thought their halohalo was more like a smoothie. I all ready had a disappointed face upon sitting down. The husband thought I got into it with a worker, but I was all ready peeved I couldn't technically make my own halohalo. Then biting into it and the texture was smoothie like. Look, I love smoothies...I love halohalo. I don't love halohalo smoothies. 

Thus, I've dropped a star and won't be returning for their halohalo. Just isn't my preference. I can get a textured one to my liking around the corner. But don't let my preference deter you from jumping on the magnolia train! Staff is still friendly and helpful, magnolia ice cream is still deelish...just don't prefer their halohalo. Tis all.

5519425,2016-08-21,0,Wq9yflrKX79xKiY__BvCoQ,"Came here mainly to try the halo halo, one of my favorite desserts. This small dessert shop is inside Seafood City Supermarket. There aren't too many tables for seating inside the shop, but you can easily sit around the food court nearby. I ordered a regular halo halo. The ube ice cream on top is super delicious and flavorful. However, most of the other ingredients were packed towards the bottom of the cup, with shaved ice in the middle, making it quite difficult to mix the entire cup. Nonetheless, the portion is plenty for a regular size. I liked all the ingredients included, although the coconut gel tasted a little funny to me. I would come back for more if I'm ever in the area, but wouldn't say it was the best halo halo I've ever had.",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,2,2,4,PoBrbDuiCKl74zuYdHqrvw

He suggested mais queso rather than queso ice cream with queso chunks. I also ordered a double  scoop of mais queso and queso uble  for my sister.

Flavors on the board the last visit:  avocado, buko pandan, cashew langka, green tea, guava, halo-halo, haupia, kona coffee, lychee, macapuno, macapuno ube, mais queso (corn and cheese, mango, Thai tea, and the uber-popular UBE.  I enjoyed the double scoop of Thai Tea and Ube on a cone very much and plan to return to try all of the flavors eventually.

Located inside the bustling Seafood City, Magnolia Ice Cream also serves up halo-halo.  Unfortunately, I have to say the one I had there is not the best I've ever had.  There was way too much ice and not enough evaporated milk, so much so that I could barely mix-mix the ingredients.  This can easily be fixed, though, so hopefully it will be better the next time around; I'll be sure to request less ice if I try it again.
