Every time I come into this location my service is terrible!!!! This tuesday we sat at the bar, the bartender got my drink and then I no longer exsisted in his world! I tried to get his attention to order and the girl behind the bar ended up taking my order. She must not liked the way I tried getting the guys attention because she immediately seemed annoyed. If she thought her attitude went unnoticed it didn't! Our food came out as ordered but that was the extent of our service! We had to ask for our check and she never came back to cash us out. 

Buffalo Wild Wings is usually my choice of guilty pleasures when i'm on a cheat day and when I come in looking forward to this only to receive the worst service each time is so dissapointing!",6X3--JJwPaCcNEGhhl90Yg,1,0,2,L8Pc4ZlB4ZJEt_EGRCw1lw

Throw Buffalo Wild Wings sauces on some decent sized wings and we've got a winner here!  Pretty darn expensive as well.  I just spent nearly $70 on drinks and 24 wings for two - on discount wing night!  

Still, though, the place has a decent vibe particularly for watching games whether it be basketball or football.  Not somewhere I'm going to frequent on a regular basis, though.  Just too pricey for the product that ya get.",OfBF_6IvMnCjE9dfAKOBlQ,2,0,3,a-yQ4GT5VUZkMkDhIwX8RQ

We came in during the dinner time rush.

I used to be a waitress and I can always tell when the wait staff if working their asses off. She was doing just that and still made time to keep checking up on us, talk to us for a bit about hockey (go Sharks!), making sure we were happy with our meals, bringing extra sauces and generally going above and beyond even though the restaurant was crazy busy. I always appreciate good service and she was definitely working hard to provide it, and made our experience here tonight great.

fairly recently we've been having issues with them getting the order right.  typically they forget utensils, missing orders of celery and / or ranch, give us the wrong flavor, etc - but the line was drawn for us when we placed a 24pc wing order only to see that there were 12 wings in a 24pc box and the other half of the order was not included after coming home, relaxing in front of the tv and getting ready to eat.

never had we really experienced a problem with dining in (with the exception of the occasional lag of service when it's a little crowded) but all of these mistakes with carry-out has started to rub us the wrong way.

when picking up an order, always always ALWAYS double-check right in front of them.",_neRb5ZdXP9SQg7bq7mBcQ,2,0,2,dYD6OTxDrwMIFSjdmzm4qw

When I arrived, the gentleman at the takeout station remembered what I had called about and immediately got a manager. When the manager, Scott, came to talk to me, he asked if I would like the wings. I said that would be fine and had a wonderful conversation with the takeout server. 

When Scott came back out, he had the entire original order: 15 hot wings, wet, with carrots and ranch. I was absolutely amazed! I had expected just 5 hot wings! Exemplary customer service that went above and beyond my expectations!",mxLe4i9PRgCVeAVJWbhsUA,2,0,5,T8Mb6njWYbxasiqFzIAvUQ

524032,2013-11-28,0,uDeycmwCy26ALJHeG3SsEA,"I love me some B-Dubs but this location is just meh.  Been to this location a few times but I've found that the service is hit or miss.  Sometimes it seems that it takes FOR-EV-ERRRR (if you're a 90's kid like me, you read that like Squints from the Sandlot) to get something from the waiters/waitresses.  I swear, one time, we had to ask 3 different people to get us some silverware because the people we asked before never gave us any.  The same thing happened when we asked for ranch.  Then we ended up getting ranch from a bunch of different people like 15 minutes after we asked for it.  Kind of annoying.

If you come at dinner time, there always seems to be a long wait.  Like at least 30 mins...but there always seems to be a bunch of tables open.  Hmmm..not sure what's up with that but whatever.  My husband and I try to just head over to the bar area to see if we can find some open seats or tables so we don't have to wait.  We have always found a spot to sit there so far, so, if you're over 21, head to the bar instead as that seems to be the quicker option.

As far as the food, I love their queso chili fries!  So addicting!  I usually order the boneless wings with medium sauce or the buffalo ranch chicken wrap.  I like both although I wish they would melt the cheese in the wrap.  The cheese is always cold so it's a little weird.  Doesn't taste bad, just would be better with cheese that didn't come right out of the fridge.",dAhV0ka-Toxs9_JTfAqxlA,1,0,3,120vDz-yafltbwQmtrmbow

However, there's something in the Wild sauce that's simply addicting. Kind of a legal crack. Show up on Tuesday and it's really budget friendly. Like all big chains, they have constant turnover in staff and some visits are better than others, but I've certainly had more 'betters' than 'others' over the years.

540581,2016-04-17,0,uDeycmwCy26ALJHeG3SsEA,"My husband and I decided to stop in since we haven't been to a BWW in quite a long time.  We were greeted immediately and seated where we asked.  The booth we sat at was quite difficult to get in and out; the table had to be moved back and forth to get in and I'm a size 8!  The servers were all very nice and pleasant and the Buffalo Sauce was good.  What was NOT pleasant was the food.  My chicken tenders were not tender- they were dry and it hurt to bite into them.  My husband's Southwest Philly was OK but he asked for the toppings on the side- they were on top of the sandwich.

The TVs were OK - I'm sure it's too expensive to upgrade to newer large screens but what would have been nice is if I didn't have to watch several screens with the same sports talk show on them.  Staring at the same coach talking and not being able to hear/read what he was saying was boring.

I'm surprised so many parents are bringing their babies here.  The place has a large bar and the restaurant has a party atmosphere.  That means there is loud music going on.  I have an app on my phone that senses how loud a place is - it read 70-80 dB while we were there - that can't be good for little ears.  (Constant exposure to 85dB can lead to hearing loss)

With so many other restaurants offering good fare at about the same price, I'd recommend go somewhere else.",kLLj-q8rzn0qpE3APMF43g,0,0,1,Cd2m8sC-Hv7eijXxL56-Zw

644020,2014-03-07,0,uDeycmwCy26ALJHeG3SsEA,"The basis for the three stars in this case is the happy hour and Thursday specials.  Generally I think Buffalo Wild Wings aka BW3 (although the T-Mobile salesman pointed out to me that no one  calls it that anymore) is well OK, not great, but I would normally put this in the ""meh"" category as I feel like they are over priced for what you get on any day but for their specials. Normally, they charge extra for extra ranch/blue cheese and carrots/celery - really? Always a pet peeve, it costs them mere cents so they should just give it to the customer for free and factor that in to their already high mark up for wings. OK off my soap box - Thursday night - 60 cent boneless wing night (mini chicken fingers). For 60 cents I can justify paying 60 cents to get blue cheese. The mini chicken fingers were small but crisp, my only complaint was that they didn't toss them in the sauce that well so only have of each mini chicken finger (MCF) was coated. I got medium heat - which was plenty 'o' heat for me. Also, ordered the Chili Con Queso with chips for $3 on happy hour and the onion rings. Onion rings were super hot (in temperature) the chili con queso I wouldn't order again, I realize it was only $3 but it was just a small cup of the nacho cheese you can get in a can with a small dollop of their house bean chili on top - ""meh"".  Anyway, happy hour goes until 6 (I think) with $3 app specials and $3 domestic drafts and several $3 spirit drinks (Jack and Coke, Absolut etc). They have the normal bar fare on the $3 happy hour list - fried mozz, chips & salsa, onion rings, chili con queso and a couple of others. But for $3 you can't really beat it. It was plenty loud in there but I assume it was busier because of 60 cent wing night and if you want to see a lot of sports TV and not be in a sports book then this is a good alternative.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,1,3,H6JovJKeMc02YwU-dK-Sew

Well not realizing the time, I came over an hour later to pick up my food, which had been sitting out at that point for about 30 minutes. Needless to say nothing was hot anymore. Knowing it was my own fault I asked what was the best way to reheat the food to make it hot again. She told me to hold on and got a manager. She told the manager what happened, he asked if I had been waiting in line for the food the entire time and she told him I just got there. He said okay, put the order in again and told me it would be a little bit since they had to re-make the order. I definitely wasn't expecting them to remake it again.

969063,2013-06-06,2,uDeycmwCy26ALJHeG3SsEA,"Buffalo Wild Wings, B-Dubs or BWW how ever you say it all means the same!  

Buffalo Wild Wings always delivers!  The food is always pretty consistent and the service most of the time is pretty good.  This time though I have to send a shout out our server Christina.  We have had her several times.  She remembers us even though we don't come in that often.  She is so cute with a great personality.  She always offers suggestions and displays an over and beyond attitude no matter how busy she is.  She even got the BF hooked on the LA Water.  *its one of the bartender's specialties not on the menu.  Be sure to order one. Its tasty and leaves ya loopy. LOL

We ordered the pretzels with the spicy honey mustard and queso.  The queso is not that great but I do love the mustard.  The pretzels are soft on the inside...always delicious.  BF ordered the traditional wings (6 mild sauce and 6 with desert heat rub).  The desert heat rub is really good.  We have actually bought the rub for grillin at home.  Its a little on the spicy side so I wouldn't suggest it for the fragile peeps.  I ordered the naked tenders (naked tenders are grilled white meat strips and not fried) tossed in the desert heat and they were good as always.  I ordered with Caribbean Jerk on the side with Fat Free Ranch.  The Jerk sauce is pretty spicy but it is by far my fave!  We also ordered the wedges to share.  Those are yummy dipped in any kind of sauce.

Lagundo brought our food out.  Lagundo, Gondo, G or God's Gift to B-Dubs is how he introduced himself when we asked his name. LOL  Each time this guy has come to our table he is one of the most pleasant, smily, kind hearted young people I have ever come across.  I was astonished to find out he was only 17.  I had to mention to him how pleasant we thought he was each time we go there and that we thought he really has a special quality in customer service. This guy really has a presence about him.  What a great quality to have at such a young age.  I hope his manager notices what a benefit he is and could be! 

What can I say? We are total suckers for excellent service and in this city and this day in age it comes few and far between unfortunately.  So shout outs to SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE is necessary to Yelp I believe  Christina and Lagundo will be the deciding factor on our quick return back for sure....and the food a quick second factor or course.",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,2,5,T9n6TKhnkqwh7u3a70O-pQ

I have this thing about food joints with napkin rolled silverware.  When there are no other napkins available you have a choice of placing your silverware on a table wiped with a dish towel of unknown cleanliness or going without a napkin so your silverware can rest on it.

Clean..friendly atmosphere.
Service: Could use some improvement. Took the server 20 minutes before coming over to our table to take our order.
A little slow with the drink. 15 minutes before our alcoholic beverages were serve. 
Another 20 minutes before food is brought out.

Total time from being seated and eating: approximately 55 minutes. Lets just call it an hour.

Fries: A little soggy.
Wings: Acceptable,. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall, I've had a better experience at other BWW..... 


The only thing that saved it from getting a 2-star: Good wings.

1090836,2017-08-25,0,uDeycmwCy26ALJHeG3SsEA,"Thursday around 230 PM, I pick my girlfriend up from work and we head over here to try this place out after mulling it over for a few weeks. The parking lot seemed decently filled but when we walk in, there were 4-5 employees hanging out at the front counter with a relatively empty seating area. 

We smile upon entry and all employees at the front stare at us blankly until one asks if we are here for pick up. We decline and say we would like to dine in. They talk about available booths before one goes to check on one. Meanwhile a group comes in and crams their way in between us and the employee that was going to seat us (we were about a foot and a half away from the server, by the way) and they have some confusion about a seating arrangement. We get seated after they decide to figure out the other customers afterward. 

We sit for a moment before our server comes to ask us what we want to drink and if we are ready to order. We order some iced teas and then state we need a few minutes. My girlfriend started to speak up for her order when another employee interrupts to tell our server to do something whenever he finished with us. While I was ordering -mind you I've never been here- I wasn't sure how the process went. I got the naked tenders and I was waiting for the server to maybe prompt me to pick a sauce but he just kinda stared at me. 

Three times I saw servers bring tables the wrong food, including once to our table. Our food finally gets to us and my first bite of these naked tenders is one of those bites where you instantly question if your food is cooked. I moved on to another piece of chicken and the rest were pretty cooked. My girlfriend and I both liked her wing choice. 

We ate pretty fast and got our bill, then sat there at the table for ten min or longer before the server picked it up to process. Once we got the receipt back to sign, we were given a red pen to sign with.

All in all, we probably should have left before we even ordered our drinks because our initial gut feeling wasn't promising. Our server was decently nice and he still got a good tip, but there was no sincerity or connections made at all, let alone a lack of customer service.",ROMD11t9rLV-FuNJPRoY1g,0,0,2,zT8rxSgi3qX2bupRDX3Muw

The wings were great, the lemonade was delish, and the cheese sticks we ordered were good but a little cold. You cold tell they were pre made. They have tons of TVs with different sports games playing, and you can play trivia while you wait for your food which I thought was pretty fun. From a girl in a wheelchair's point of view: the hostess was nice but they did what pretty much every restaurant does... They sat me in the middle of the room of tables. It's was hard to squeeze the wheelchair past everyone that was already seated. So it's really inconvenient for me and the people who had to either stand up or scoot in so we could pass.

Seems like the cooks in the back truly don't give a crap anymore.  Nachos were garbage?  With bagged chicken added?  Not even fresh??  And just liquid cheese dumped on it and a spoon of chili?  Worse we've ever had.  One order of wings came out in a POOL of hot sauce.  Sauce was just dumped on them and so much in the bottom of the bowl.  It was like wings floating in soup! Another order came out over poured too, but not as bad as the other.  Still - way too much added to the wings.  And then the chipotle bbq rub ones- OMG...they cooked them, threw then in the bowl and poured/dusted a massive coat of the rub on one side of the wings?  Not lightly tossed??  I had to scrape them off.  The service is always great (will give them a 4) and you can always get some beer.  But c'mon guys, the cooks suck!",xVfK4hxPqr57SRleHT1U5w,1,0,1,BvMWa0AAGavflfo-oXHWYQ

So, the first visit was not impressive at all.  

Second visit in Feb 2018, I made sure the veteran was the first to be served, as he was very reluctant to return.  But, same consistent food, nothing really to look forward to in my opinion - but consistent.

Or....,.(yes, as in camping chairs) OR, better yet....should I begin with the people sitting on the floor in front of one of the entrance doors eating wings picnic style?. I am dead serious people.  There's nothing pretty about what I am about to share.  You can't make this stuff up. It's THAT bad!!  I am still reeling from the experience and I am not sure how much energy I have to go into details.  However, I feel an obligation to share this hair-raising (and just plain awful) adventure. Here's the deal.  I called on Friday to find out if they were playing the fight. ""No, we do not take any reservations. It's first come fist serve.""  ""So even if I have a big group? ""No, we do not reserve tables at all.""  What time can I come in and be ""first"" ?  ""Any. Then you are ""first"" come first serve for a table. Great. We got there Sat., 4:45 pm and walked into the non-organized nightmare.  A long line just to get on the list. So as I asked the lady at the pulpit, while my husband stood, committed to the big line, I was told about the list they were making was for the dining room. Where at the time I was standing there, was full and she said would be cleared by 6:00 to start their STADUIM SEATING. The list is how they are seating the room.  Then, goes on, ""But, the bar was open seating, no wait over there, no list. Sit where you want.  Great...My husband got out of the line and we went over to the bar area. Not a great idea. There was 8 or so people scattered about but on every single seating area had these cheezy dirty signs that said, ""RESERVED FOR FIGHT"".  Huh? So, Each employee gave a different story.  ""Contest winners"" , ""People who reserved a table"", ""Overflow from the dining room."" , ""Gaming customers.""  We were told not ONE seat was available - ALL SEATS ARE RESERVED. Okay, back to the line. (Yes, the one we got out of).  After telling the 3 girls at the pulpit they were shocked and didn't know this. One even went over to ask. She never came back. We ended up 59 or so on the ""List"" after getting out of line to get back in line. No mercy. They said, ""Oh, don't worry, we are clearing this place out empty.""  We asked if we could get a drink to wait. Sure. Okay, back to the bar because they told us, ""You wouldn't be able to sit in the dining room unless we were there JUST TO EAT - NOT TO WATCH THE FIGHT. (seriously, I swear this was out of the Managers mouth).  What? Wait. Yes,  I am here to eat... Huh?  Okay, sitting at the (almost empty except for these signs) bar order beers and chat up the girls next to us.  They were not contest winners and didn't make any reservations and they were sitting there. (And ended up sitting there the rest of the night with no hassel).... This is getting long but I swear this happened.... Well, at 6 - They only told 3 or 4 tables in the dining room to get up. People were pissed. They said, ""They are just eating."" People who walked right in sat down at empty tables that they just told people to get up. And the servers didn't know who sat down where. No contest winners showed-up at the bar. (We asked) But, were told it was going to be ""overflow' that never happened, because after raging and them offering us a bench seat to sit on with 4 other people, (yes, no table, a bench)  we went back to the bar where we had been drinking earlier (and were told to clear out because we followed directions ). We then got gutsy and moved the 'RESERVED FOR FIGHT' sign and had to endure a FIRE DEPT VIOLATION OF TOO MANY PEOPLE. and BABIES on the floor with food and lawn chairs and chaos. There was no way they had any order to the situation!

First time I stopped by with a friend, who ordered a variety of wings and some fries while I had the buffalo wrap with fries.  It was quite tasty and the wings were good. Decent fries too.  

The second visit was where things went to crap.  A group of us stopped in for a quick late lunch that was anything but.  Upon entry and asking for a booth, the hostess marched us straight back to a booth near the toilets despite a number of open booths elsewhere in the facility.  Not only is this booth near the toilets it had the worst viewing area for the numerous college football games being shown.  She then took off before we could ask to move.  Fortunately our waitress let us move, but as we walked over to a much nicer booth the hostess who seated us was starring daggers at us.  If looks could kill we'd all be dust.  We then had a bunch of wings, some fries, and I had a buffalo chicken sandwich (grilled).  The chicken sandwich was disgusting, really chewy with lots of tendon in it and barely hot.  The dry rub buffalo wings were ok, as were the fries, but the Caribbean jerk wings were way way too sweet.  Service was ok to start, with a couple of drink refills and the food coming out quick, but our waitress kinda vanished after that and it took forever to get our bill.

Never acknowledged us or anything.. then to make it worse he complains to a manager about how he hates being here... yeah... if there was a way to get Todds schedule I would only come when he's here because this guys got me convinced he's the only one who enjoys her job besides Michelle, she brought us out our food and she was so nice and presentable.

I ordered 15 boneless wings with mild classic wing sauce.  My daughter had the build your own sandwich, which she chose the chicken sandwich with lettuce, pickle spear, and bacon.  Sandwich comes with fries.  We also started with some cheese sticks because it was still happy hour, so why not.

Cheese sticks came out pretty quick and tasted delicious.  About 10 min later our food arrived.  My daughters sandwich had Swiss cheese on it, which she didn't order, but she still ate it anyway.  My boneless wings looked like breaded chicken pieces literally DROWNING in wing sauce.  I was only able to get through about 6-7 of them before I had to stop.  Not only was it not mild flavored, but I felt like I was just eating liquid hot wing sauce.  The waitress (Samantha) was very nice to offer me something else, which I declined, and took it off our bill.  My daughter was very happy with her meal...cheese and all.  Samantha our server checked on us often, refilled our drinks as needed, and was very nice.  You could tell she had been serving for quite a while and knew what she was doing.  

In closing, with the exception of my food being messed up due to the kitchen, this was a good experience.  Honestly never really had any real bad issues with this restaurant and the wings are always great.  

I give this dining experience 4 out of 5 stars with the only problem being the drowning wings.  Other than that, service was great.  Best of luck to Samantha in law school, which she leaves for in 2 weeks (as she told us through our conversation).  If you make it in there before her two weeks are up, I would request her if you can.  Always good to have a helpful server!!",D_uUJZCSVSvV-TTCQbeCQg,1,0,4,GZHEKzuRDkUDYIH4gjdONQ

Today I went for the Sampler.....Nachos, Cheese Sticks, Boneless Wings, and Onion Rings....yeah baby!  I thought the sampler was excellent, except the Nachos which were just OK in my book.  I'm not a huge fan of their Cheese/Chili combo on the Nachos.

Washed it down with an Apricot Wheat beer....went for the Ranger IPA next and then the other IPA they have on tap to end the day.

My husband REALLY wanted to eat at B dubs tonight, because we found one in our new neighborhood in the Northwest and he was extremely excited. The only reason we left our house on a Friday night was to come to this restaurant. 

There appeared to be a line from the outside, so we parked the car and called just to make sure we can get a table in a reasonable amount of time. Girl answering the phone screamed in laughter when she answered and then continued to yell into the phone to greet me. I asked how long the wait was and she said ""Probably... wait how many of you are there? ""I told her there were only two of us and she said ""We have tables open,  no wait come in now."" We shut off the car and walked inside, and the girl with the white shirt on and a pixie haircut, who I can only presume is the manager, to this if there's a 20 minute wait for the two of us. We said ""Oh...really? We literally just called from the parking lot and they said their tables were open to come on in."" She said, ""Okay.""

We turn to leave, and she said, ""You can sit at the bar."" We said ""No, thank you."" She said, ""You don't want to sit at the bar?"" We left. Some people don't want to sit at a bar with a poker machine embedded in it, in an uncomfortable chair, yelling over sports fans to spend time with their significant other. Mainly, don't tell us to come in when there isn't a spot for us.

I'm writing this review from a booth at BJ's Restaurant down the street, where we will spend our money this evening. 

Poor customer service in the phone, terrible customer service by the person you can only presume is the manager, the music was so loud when we went in that we had to strain to hear the rudeness, and the parking lot sprinklers are shooting up in the air making a muddy mess all over.

4014323,2014-10-30,1,uDeycmwCy26ALJHeG3SsEA,"Went to Buffalo Wild Wings because we had a gift card to use.  Normally I'm not much of a wing guy but I do like Wing Stop so I figure, why not?  What do we have to lose?  Quite a bit actually.

No offense to the service here.  Our waitress was prompt, very polite, and kept a good check on us.  But the food?  Eh, not my favorite for wings or bar type food.  For a chain I guess I should have been held to the 'average to maybe above average' experience.  

Was I mistaken to think the wings here at Buffalo Wild Wings should be bigger?  Damn, these wings were small!  An order of six could barely feed my 12 year old kid!  We got her a kid's meal as well.  Luckily we had our gift card which did cover most of the bill, but still we had to order quite a bit of food to lose our hunger.

We started off with the 'Ultimate' Nachos.  I put ultimate in quote because they really weren't at all.  Basic dish of nachos with chili, pico de gallo, jalapenos, cheese, and salsa all on a bed of tortilla chips.  But...who puts shredded lettuce on hot nachos?  Thing was all soggy upon arrival to our table.  Serving was ok but barely enough for three of us to share.

For wings, we got traditional in the medium size (about 15-16 wings) in three flavors: Mild, Lemon Pepper, and Asian Zing.  Our wings also came with sides of carrot and celery sticks, and blue cheese dressing.  The wings?  Bit of a disappointment to say the least!  So tiny!  Looks like it was meant for kids to nosh on.  After two little bites one wing was gone.  Flavors weren't my favorite either.  The Mild?  Basic Buffalo with less kick.  Lemon Pepper?  Dry, dry, dry!  Where is the butter for this?  Like they took fried wings and just dressed it with lemon pepper without anything to make them stick to the wings.  Asian Zing?  Just damn basic sweet chili sauce on wings.  Bleh.

Kid got a meal of boneless wings in Parmesan Garlic flavor.  She was disappointed as well unfortunately.  The boneless wings were dry.  There was nothing on them to really hold the parmesan garlic flavor in.  Once again, a dip in butter would have helped.  She ended up not eating most of them.  

We've gone to that 'other' wing place (*cough* Wing Stop *cough*) a number of times and much prefer them I'm sorry to say.  The wings were much more substantial, and the flavorings were much more on par with being tasty.  Pricing was a bit better as well since it provided more value.

1.  I do not hoot and holler when my team scores a field goal in the final minutes of the 4th quarter when the score is 38-14.

3.  Ridiculing other patrons because their team is losing isn't cool.

When you walk in you have their whole section with booths and tables you know, basic stuff. But in the back, you have the bar area. Tables and a whole wrap around bar with a bunch of tv's and projectors. I think it's great!
My boyfriend and I went around 6ish so it was pretty busy and there were people waiting outside to be seated. But lucky for us, we're over 21 and got to just walk over and sit at the bar. 
So, like I said they were busy and it took a few minutes for them to actually greet us and get our drinks. But lucky for them, i'm completely understanding and I don't mind waiting a few minutes if a place is busy. We ordered 2 tall Blue Moons with an orange slice. I LOVE Blue Moon on tap so if a place has it, I get it! 
They had a special going on for their boneless wings. It was buy one get one. So we ended up ordering a pretzel for an appetizer, and a small order of wings(including the free one). The flavors we got were Honey BBQ, Asian Zing, and Lemon Pepper. 
I was really happy that they brought our pretzel out first before the wings. The pretzel was huge (and delicious)! And our cheese sauce was soooo yummy! It had a little spice to it that I really enjoyed.
By the time we were almost done with the pretzel they brought out our wings. The wings were great. The honey BBQ was nice and sweet, probably my second favorite. The Asian Zing had a nice kick that wasn't overwhelming, but I really enjoyed the flavor so these were my top favorite. The Lemon Pepper were my least favorite. I mean don't get me wrong, they were still great but I feel like it just doesn't work for boneless wings. Next time i'll try it on normal wings for sure. 
All in all, I had a great time. We watched the hockey game and our servers Eddie and Angie (I think, I can't fully remember her name sadly!) were nice and made sure were were happy with our meal without being too in our face like some places can be.

The restaurant was basically empty, and the lights were turned all t he way down. It was so dark that it was very hard to read the menu. We ordered mozzarella sticks to start, and then wings for ""Wings Tuesday"", which went from $0.45 cents a wing, now up to $0.70 a wing. Taking that, plus the extra cost of ranch, carrots and celery, is really no longer a deal. The wings and other food were delivered, and we had not received our mozzarella sticks. I told the server, and also told her to not worry about them, since our food was already out. She begged and convinced me to get them anyway, since they would ""only take a minute"". She claimed it was ""totally her fault"" that they did not come out. We ate the food, and I had an empty soda glass on the edge of the table. Our server hardly came by, and completely ignored the empty glass on the table. Another server even came over to the table, grabbed the empty cup and never returned with it, assuming I was finished with it, even though I was still eating my food. I get the bill, half expecting the mozzarella sticks to be comped since she had to beg me to keep them, but no... They were still on the ticket. Usually B-Dubs is good at handling the situation. Not today. We were completely ignored. I watched a manager stop by every table around us and ask us how their meals were. She completely skipped over our table. Severely disappointed!

During my visit a few months ago I was the only patron in the entire bar. It was after work and roughly 2am, the bartender forgot my drink order twice and forgot that I even ordered food. Then once he remembered that I ordered food, it was wrong! He brought me the wrong beer too!

So I decided to try takeout today since the service is obviously sub-par. The food came out in a decent timely manner, they gave me bone-in wings when I instead ordered boneless. I was hungry so I said I didn't mind and then went home. As I got ready to eat, I opened the lid and saw fucking feathers still attached to the chicken. I almost threw up. 
I called the manager to complain and he casually responded with ""well yea, it's chicken.. that's gonna happen sometimes"". Are you kidding me? Is there any sort of quality control whatsoever for your kitchen? They cooked it, sauced it, put it in a box to serve and still didn't see an issue with it? It's 100% obvious to me that nobody here gives a flying shit about the quality of food they serve to their customers. Thankfully he gave zero resistance to a full refund and responded with ""yea aight man I'll get it taken care of for you"". Aight? Man? How about 'ok sir'? The unprofessionalism is astounding.

No tip for you pukebag!)

The wings are pretty good though, most of the sauces I have tried have been pretty awesome too, but the highest in hotness I've gone has only been Caribbean Jerk. Not a big fan over super spicy, but I'm sure they're just as good as the other ones.

The best thing here too, if they're not too busy, they will grill them for you.... but please tip the cooks. They'll love you for it and it takes more work and time. Service is usually pretty good, but the bartenders know my boyfriend and I. 
I like to splurge 1-2 days of the week and I try to stay really healthy with my diet the rest of the week. This is one of my favorite ""eat my heart"" out places, or "" eat because I'm so drunk "". But I don't drive, I promise.

The best wings there in my opinion -
Mango Habenero
Parmasen Garlic
Sweet BBQ 
Wild

They usually have a few really good IPA's on tap too. Dead Guy is my favorite. 

For appetizers...eh. They're average like most places. The breaded mushrooms are good, but that's about it. 

The downside - Their ranch and bluecheese dressing is just on the okay side. I think they need to revamp that.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,1,0,4,InskGW95XXdsUj3jgQlPzg

Great place to watch games.....and the only place nearby where I could watch NHL playoffs.  With 18 screens around the bar, and 22 monitors in the dining room area, I had the pleasure of watching some NBA and UFC as well.  They even have two more monitors in the mens bathroom (over the urinals), so I never would miss a goal or powerplay.  Not sure if there were screens inside the women's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did!

After a few visits, I've become a fan of their bar food as well.  With 14 ""smilin to screamin"" different sauces, we've only had four so far.   Their boneless wings were satisfying with their medium sauce.  But their honey BBQ sauce made their ribs and wings combo better than average.  Our last visit involved their mango habanero sauce on their tender, juicy ribs and perfectly cooked wings.  This screamin sauce (third from their hottest) had a nice flavor and kick to it.  Their hot BBQ sauce went well with the pulled pork slammers.  The pork was a little dry but full of flavor.
For desserts, we've had the chocolate cake and cinnamon bites, which I highly recommend after the spices.  Both were served with ice cream, and were very refreshing.

I have reached out to Buffalo Wild Wings about my experience and I have never received an email back which is beyond ridiculous. To begin, my boyfriend and I had come in for dinner and he had ordered a cheese curd burger. We waited and waited and we had finally recieved our food. Our waitress dropped off our food and then had walked away before we realized that the cheese curd burger we had ordered was missing a prime ingredient, the cheese curds. We did not see our waitress for about 15 minutes. When she had finally asked us how our food was, we made her aware that it was the wrong burger. She took the burger to the kitchen and returned with the cheese curd burger instantly. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and thought that they made the new burger pretty quick. We had taken a bite of the burger and realized it was the same cold burger that we had first recieved with the cheese curds just added on top. Why not make us a new burger?!? At this point we were hungry and tired. We then asked for the check. Once I looked over the check I realized the waitress had charged us for 2 burgers when we had only ordered one. I brought it up to our waitress and she had stated ""oh yeah I know I am just waiting for my manager to fix the check."" First of all, why would you give us the wrong bill and expect us to pay for it without even saying something to us. To this day, I believe that if I hadn't looked over the bill and said something she would have charged us the full amount to get a bigger tip. Once we left the restaurant I instantly sent an email to Buffalo Wild Wing's customer service. It's been quite while now and I still haven't heard anything back.

We ordered 18 wings with Medium, Asian Zing, Caribbean Jerk, and Parmesan Garlic assortment of sauces.  Also my friend also ordered the ""Buffalito Tacos"" with her choice of any sauce, but she chose the standard BBQ sauce.  Granted we both ordered water for our drinks, the cost of everything including tip was below $25 for two....NOT BAD!  If you are fan of buffalo wings like I am.....you will enjoy Buffalo Wild Wings whichever restaurant you choose.  I can't wait to go again!

(Sidenote:  I  found out from the waitress that Buffalo Wild Wings is a large franchise chain that still has to creep into the Orange County area.

The last time I was here was with my best friend, who had befriended the bartender and demanded that I tag along and enjoy the drinks that the two of the came up with. Well, us not caring about pop sport culture did not know it was a game night, and so struggled to find seats at the bar. Her friend the bartender took a while to get us our drinks, which was fine since he had to service the whole place. But then came the food fiasco. First, it took fifteen minutes for us to put in our order. Then it took twenty minutes for the order to go through. Which isn't all that bad considering, but the thing was, we only ordered appetizers. I got fried pickles and she got the sampler plate. I was approached by a waiter with two baskets of fried pickles who asked me if I had order some. I said yes, and they gave me a basket. Turns out the people next to us had ordered two baskets of fried pickles. I basically just jacked their pickles.
I didn't know this until much, much, much later when my friend got her plate and they gave me another basket of fried pickles. The bill was only for one as well. I seriously hope those people didn't end up paying for two.

Atmosphere: the usual for a sports bar. Multiple large screen tvs showing various sporting events. On the loud side, but whadda ya expect? Overall clean.

Staff: bartenders were attentive, helpful, friendly and ensured we were taken care of. One simple and effective way I judge service, is how long it takes to get an empty water glass refilled. Here, it wasn't long. 

Food: Had their Tuesday special traditional wings (70 cents/each) with Garlic Parmesan dipping sauce. The wings were nicely crispy golden brown and moist and tender in the middle. Yum. 

Then had the Chili Queso Dip with tortilla chips. This was topped with a spoonful of pico de gallo. The chili was miniscule, didn't even realize it had chili until I looked up the official name from my posted pic. Anyways, it was alright. 

Lastly, ordered the Southwest Loaded Chips. Crispy and tasty dressed with liquid cheese and southwest ranch. Would order again

Drinks: Tall, cold, Bud Lights. Perfect when it's 110 out.

They have Happy hour beer prices and some happy hour food offerings.  We happened to be there on 60¢ wing night.  We asked for the wings extra crispy and they were.

I am pretty sure they charged extra for ranch and blue cheese - which that is cheesy!  We had an order of 20 wings and we got a tiny plastic cup of ranch and 1 tiny cup of blue cheese.  

The happy hour special were mini corn dogs, chili con queso dip (that's chili and chese dip) and onion rings.  I do enjoy greasy bar food, but  I could have done better at 7-11.  

With the happy hour prices you really are just paying fair prices.  Basically, you get a discount on there overly inflated prices.

When you spend 30.00 on food and it's cold because it's sitting in the window, it's upsetting.

Oh I did, but I was placed on hold for longer than it takes for me to get here from my house. So as I continue to sit here, I finally got helped. Giving 2 stars just because the bartender is polite. Here's to hoping the food is good tonight & it takes less time to make than to order",0yeivpX5ESfDO7djvhi6lg,1,0,2,PvVly09vb42r79p_1y4D_Q
