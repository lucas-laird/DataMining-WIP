851350,2015-02-22,0,S6V63OzrCaj22BQJeKBDCw,"Going to this particular Taco Time was one of the WORST experiences I've ever had concerning fast food. I used to go to Taco Time all the time as a kid back in Oregon. When I found out there was one here I was excited to go and eat there again. My excitement died quite fast though after I got there. It was around 7:00pm and there was only one guy behind the counter. He didn't come to the cash register for a good while, even after seeing me and the other customers waiting. Instead, he yelled for the guy from Burger King to come and work the counter after we had already been waiting a while. Why schedule only one guy in the first place when you know he might need some help? Anyways, the worker from Burger King came over and worked the register. Only, he had trouble doing so. When taking my order he charged me for things I did not ask for. When he printed the receipt I called him on this and he continued by saying 'Oh, I'll fix it'. He took my card back and then supposedly refunded me. Then, after further inspection of the receipt we told him that he forgot to add one of the burritos we ordered. He said 'Oh, I know. But I already told him', referring to the Taco Time employee. How did he tell him and not charge me though? I asked him and he said 'it's all taken care of'. When we finally got our food, took a while since only one guy was there, I checked it. The burrito that the Burger King employee said he told the other was not there. & some of the other items were wrong as well. We ended up going back and telling them. The Taco Time employee corrected the order, sort of, and then we thought everything was fine so we left. But everything was NOT fine. I checked my bank just to be sure and it said that the BK employee had charged me when he tried to refund me and that the TT employee had charged me for something extra too. I was BEYOND annoyed. I filed a complaint with my bank and they fixed the situation to the best of their ability, however they were not able to refund me everything and told me to contact Taco Time. I wasted money there for food that was beyond disgusting as it was made hurriedly and sloppy, and then I was charged extra which I will never get back as I have tried calling Taco Time numerous times only to be sent to voicemail or put on hold. I would advise others to STAY AWAY from this place. There are plenty of other places or fast food joints that are more put together. That way you can get what you pay for and not get charged extra for things you never asked for.",v30NqPi4Zzq5F5sdjaQphQ,0,0,1,rsst3Cf172AZSKdr_Yjqzw

Though the pictures on the menu look way more satisfying. There wasn't enough lettuce on it. Taco time is like an upscale taco bell. Though I did had a few bloated tummy after I ate it.

Of late, I've been trying to get away from the Crisp Beef Burrito and have varied it up a bit. I revisited the Soft Meat Burrito -yum- it's the enchilada sauce that makes it so different! Just last week, I had the Casita Burrito (Beef). It was excellent! Next time, I think I'll have that again. 

The gal that I see most often (monthly?), knows just how to get my sour cream/ranch so that it's like the Pacific Northwest Taco Time's. She's always smiling, even when she is the only one in the kitchen. Most of the employees I've seen working there are quite nice.

2741663,2012-06-23,6,S6V63OzrCaj22BQJeKBDCw,"Growing up in Seattle, Taco Time was a normal stop for me and my family. Since moving to LA, and now living in Vegas, I was only too happy to discover this childhood favorite right here in sin city. 

Now whether you are a first timer or a regular here, there are things that you need to know. First of all, there are two different versions of Taco Time. This one here in this review and the original that is abundant in Washington (also known as Taco Time Pacific Northwest). I call any Taco Time outside of the Pacific Northwest an ""Express Taco Time"" because they don't have the complete menu and most importantly, the hot sauce is in packets! In Washington, they make the hot sauce made fresh from scratch!

The good thing is that the main items that they are known for are readily available. My most favorite item is their crisp burritos which come in chicken, pinto bean, and the best of them all, beef. Allow me to describe it. Seasoned ground beef rolled up in a flower tortilla and deep fried to a golden brown. Kinda looks like a large taquito only way better! Damn, my mouth is watering right now just typing this! Get that in a combo with mexi-fries (basically tater tots) and a drink, you're all set! Dipping these items in their hot salsa is the cherry on top! Occasionally I have one of their tacos, soft burritos and taco salads, which is not bad either. Those choices are up to you. To me, the crisp beef burritos have no equal.

I gave them 3 stars because of their location and not so good service. It's in a food court in between Burger King and Subway. The food court itself is smack dab in the middle of a truck stop, which doesn't make it any more appealing. The service is below mediocre because you have one employee that handles everything from taking your order, to cooking, to calling you when it's done. 

So if you ever go to Seattle, make Taco Time as a part of your itinerary. For more info, go to their website: www.tacotime.com",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,16,10,3,3rdWJl-KDakwGqh_-KXiRQ

I'm Mexican and had no idea tater tots were Mexican-news to me. So I order the taco meal with ""mexi-fries"" and an extra taco. We waited like 30 minutes for anyone's order to come out. When our order was ready the guy said tacos, ""who ordered tacos?"" My friends and I and other customers just stare at each other, like this is a taco place everyone ordered tacos. So we are like is this order 518, they guy was dumbfounded and said ""two tacos?"" I'm like yes we all ordered tacos is it #518, he looks at the screen 3 times. I'm just like I'm taking these damn tacos I'm starving. Sit back down and I have no ketchup for my tater tots so I go ask for some, took them 10 minutes to acknowledge me, by the time I go sit down my food is cold. Open up my taco expecting to eat the best taco I've ever had in my life. Jesus Christ it tasted like nothing and my taco crumbled in my hands. The tater tots tasted like tater tots, um okay.

Yes fellow yelper foodies, don't lie to me.  Be it McD, Jack, the King, you've all eaten it and you all secretly crave it.  You know, ""food"" manufactured from 20 different chemicals, called natural because human hands made them in a lab.  Genetically modified animal and plant life perfectly altered to meet formulation requirements.  Some, ""deep fried"" in a chemically modified oil, others subjected to radiation.  YUM!

""It's a difference you can taste"" (their slogan, not mine).  So true!

Crisp MEAT Burrito - I promise that's what it's called.  One bite of the crispy, preservative laden flour-ish tortilla sends molten cheeze and taste bud altering, texturally appealing protein amalgam oozing into your mouth!  Be sure to add the ""fresh"" original salsa to every bite.  Straight from the little packet.  Heaven!

Don't forget the side of Mexi-Fries [tm], AKA tater tots.  Crispy on the outside, oily on the inside, outstanding lubrication for later. 

Want a good laugh, check out their website while consuming.  You thought BK was bad.

The grub at this spot really is THAT good though (for deep-fried fast food)  Their 1/4lb crisp tacos are just way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco in my opinion, but my true favorites are the rolled crisp chicken burritos.   Imagine chicken in Alfredo sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla and deep fried until the tortilla is crispy and flaky, but the chicken is not all dried out (Mind you, it's not really Alfredo Sauce, I think, but it's just what the sauce reminds me of).

My GF loves this franchise and explains every time we drive by how she grew up eating at one on the west coast.

We stopped by a few months ago and the food and service was your typical fast food Mexican fare. Nothing there stood out as great and would cause me to desire or crave the dish I had.

Last night the GF begged me to bring her a veggie burrito. I parked and went inside and was surprised to see how many smelly truckers there were. Had to be two or three truckers for every truck outside.

Service was fairly quick my GF couldn't find the sunflower seeds in her veggie burrito but it didn't stop her from wolfing it down.

I won't be coming here on my own (more Taco Johns than Taco Bell and I do live across from a taco shop and can walk there) I will be happy to drive down here the next time the GF gets the craving for home/childhood.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,1,3,0eNbrq6KcS90TOj1eaLfcg
