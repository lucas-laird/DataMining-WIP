Anyhow. The night guy is super awesome, helpful, and nice. 

I'm here now on a Saturday at 4pm. After leaving another subway because they only make cookies once a day and i wanted chocolate chip delicious morsels with my sandwhich, i drove here. (Knowing if they dont have cookies theyll make them). 

I come in and no one says anything, no acknowledgement, no hello, no ""be right with you""

I stand waiting (they were filling a big order. Probably a catering im assuming. Still no one said a word. Two other ladies walked in... Silent

I asked if they could make some more chocolate chips and he said no we cant. 
(Theyre 24 hours and have to make them) 
The chick said. Yeah give me 10 minutes. 


Finally the young guy asked what I wanted. I said turkey and double american on an italian herbs n cheese footlong. 

He puts 4 turkey slices on (its supposed to be 8) and moved on. 
I asked ""isnt it supposed to be 8 slices of turkey. He said ""yeah""

Ummm can i get ma damn turkey please? 
Then he only put four pieces of cheese on (i asked for double) and then i asked again. He said ""i dont know""

The woman behind me told him it was supposed to be more cheese.
Then he started making her sandwhich and left me. 

That woman told him to do mine. And he said ""yeah butt"" 
And someone else came to help. 

Anyways. I got everything and it tasted good. Still waiting on the cookies. 

I also noticed on the catered items theyre sooooooo stingy with items. Usually you get 3/4 lettuce and 1/4 other. With the catered sandwhiches they probably had 10 shreds of lettuce on there. Pretty weird and gross looking.",yQuEw5dp9G3Uac5XaSogQg,2,0,2,27UESBS3frxbEP-wrWedAw

But I LOVE this location because.....

1. It's 24 hours.
2. Service has always been great here. They're not rude and always greet and acknowledge their customers whenever someone walks in the door. Even if they're busy.
3. SOUPS!!!!! THIS LOCATION HAVE SOUP!!!!! I've tried both their chicken noodle and broccoli cheddar soup and they're delicious!!! Perfect for those sick days or cold chilly days. (I've been to at least 2 other Subways around the area and other locations do not have soup. What's up with that yo!?)",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,1,1,5,IghjBpgA85cS_EthAsZ8fg

As we quickly realized was the exact opposite...here is my review...in the pictures is two I have uploaded showing my concern...

The first thing I noticed was a gentleman spraying down the walk way infront of the store...I won't express the lack of education this is during busy..hot hours. If u look closely at the pictures u will notice he has no yellow wet floor signs out...very dumb..so he is spraying the water and it hits my car...FAIL! Now I usually wouldn't bark about this but my sister in law is pregnant and all we need is for her to fall due to this. Once was walked into the restaurant, the dang water hose was laying in the ground were customers could easily step on it and trip...this is also pictured. Now ur saying well where should it go it's a hose...no one as there warning us of the hose or a hazard sign wasn't up...very serious...if someone trips and falls and the restaurant knows of the failure...my yelp is about lack of proper hazard awareness!",R7_bFyf6OFcySWj55WeuUA,0,0,2,0h6omAF9AV_qzouQsBwRLA

Jerica did her best under the circumstance of the horrible management but this place is very poorly run. The employees are told to not give out water cups to PAYIng customers. I purchased two meals and one drink and wanted water because I do not drink anything else but water and the poor girl was scared to loose her job if she gave me a cup for water. There was no one else in the store and it took 20 minutes to make a 1/2 sub and a cheese pizza. Greedy business owners like this are have got to go.

5044679,2017-09-13,2,rQ9zKk0So6EFT5WR1TAzfQ,"WHERE THE HECK IS 0 STAR BUTTON?
Let me explain my story here. I was there with my roommates at 3AM, last Saturday; or Sunday. Door was locked, which was understandable, dangerous at 3AM. Staff opened the door for us, we went in. Staff asked us what we would like to have instead of greeting us first, which actually was fine with me since all I wanted was a sub, not a 5 star hotel service. I ordered spicy Italian, and asked her to put sauce first before I toast it. She never answered and tried to put it in the oven, so I let her know one more time, then she put sauce that I have requested before toasting it. I guess mine went smooth after that point. 


What pissed me off was when my roommate was trying to order his. He was trying to order teriyaki and asked lady whether or not he can get that as a Panini. She ignored first time. And started to make sub. She asked us whether or not he wanted that toasted. He said no. but he still wanted that as a Panini. Lady ignored again, and tried to go on a vegetable side. Right before she put vegetables, my friend asked one more time whether or not he can get that as a Panini, and lady acted like she was annoyed, and did not want to assist us. So I stood up and told that lady, ""If you have once responded his request, yes or no, we won't be keep asking you the same questions!"".  AND SHE TOLD ME TO SHUT UP. LITERALLY SHUT UP. I thought I misheard, so I asked my friend, what she said. And my friend knew that I would be pissed off and start cursing, so instead letting me know what she said, my roommate told her ""You should not say that to customers"" VERY NICELY. And she told us to leave.  We were like.. WTF...?  Trust me. We were nice, we did not curse or anything, and I even used ma'am while I was making my sub. But we were still evicted because we were arguing over what we have requested. I do understand that restaurant deserves the right to refuse customer, but to be honest, was it a legitimate reason for her to evict us? I do not believe so.

We left, and next day, I called subway to talk to manager to share this feedback before I make a bad review everywhere. Manager was not there, so I asked staff to write down my number and my name so that manager can give me a call back to share this feedback. The manager has not called me since last Saturday, and I come, my first 1Star review (Wished it was 0 Star). 

I am mad at the staff that time, but I am more upset that manager did not call me back. Is it because they are a franchise and they don't give a F about  service? Welp. For sure, even though I live really close by this place, I don't think I will be coming to this location, maybe nor the subway. Trust me, McDonald staff won't say SHUT UP to their customers.",Uk1UKBIAwOqhjZdLm3r9zg,0,1,1,k3LGw29SUJg6CJz69nXCVQ

They have the deal going for a $2.00 6 inch meatball marinara or cold cut combo sub so we got two foot long cold cut combos!


Yum the toppings were fresh and generous and the bread which I tried was the parmesan cheddar bread and it was delicious!

What a deal it only cost us $15 bucks for two foot long subs, two large drinks, two packs of chips and 3 fresh chocolate chip cookies!
