In addition, they do not skimp on their portions. Also, their cuban sandwich is 5.00. It's an official cuban sandwich. It is hearty sandwich too. You will not get a batido de mamey this cheap and taste so good. 2.50 for large shake. It's not too sweet nor heavy. It's a perfect batido. This place reminds me of the inexpensive cuban spots back in jersey. I always miss those spots because it's cheap and serve in big portions.

The lady behind the counter wears gloves but uses the same gloves when she is cleaning or picking up garbage off the floor and handling food. I watched her as she picked up garbage off the floor and then went around the counter and touched my fries with the same gloves. Not only that but once my sandwich was ready she just left it on the counter and she started doing other things. Someone else must have finally asked her about the sandwich and I see her pointing to us so as to tell her who it's for. The girl comes and give me the sandwich and I tell her what I witnessed and she just says I'll tell her. No apology or nothing.

Its a flat $5 per plate.  You choose a carb (rice,  or rice with beans) a meat (rotating menu) and a ""veggie"" (yucca, bananas etc). 

You get a full serving of each and it's plenty to fill up on.  They don't have a menu because the daily offering changes every time.   They also have empanadas for $1 and a variety of pastries. You really can't beat the price.  And the food was delicious and from what I know it was authentic (I've never been to Cuba). 

They were super friendly and answered all of my questions, as I'm fairly new to Cuban cuisine and I don't speak Spanish. I got my order to go and it hit the spot!! Perfect meal after a long night of drinking haha.",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,4,3,5,W0N7WR0XZjvGXNm-Dfel7w

2013505,2017-11-08,4,_vvK0PUe7KJtntpRVVAj4Q,"""I wish I could throw up so I could eat lunch again."" 

Honestly, after sharing my husband's comments on Carlito's as we walked to his car, need I say more?

Okay, fine... 

We walked in around noon today for lunch. I'm not very familiar with this side of town. I'm sure that had something to do with the challenge in finding it. However, for anyone equally or less familiar, if you head north on Maryland Parkway, turn right on Karen and left into the strip mall, the restaurant will be to your right. That said, parking was easy once we found where we were going. 

The venue itself is tiny. Two two-tops outside, maybe four four-tops inside, and a little bit of counter seating in the back. Inside, you'll find black & white photos of classic cards, a large wooden Cuba island art piece, a photo of Celia Cruz, raggaeton on the speakers, and the clamoring of Cuban-accented Spanish in the air. My husband called this the most Cuban place outside of Florida he's ever been. Clearly, we haven't been to Cuba. 

The entire process is cafeteria/Panda Express/filipino turo-turo-style, with a few a la carte options posted on the menu that really aren't visible until you're about to pay. When you approach the line, you'll find dessert options first (I love them for this). I don't think you order the dessert at this time. Rather, you have a chance to see the items and can order them when you pay. I could be wrong though. Moving on, you'll start by announcing ""for here"" or ""to go"". 

PRO TIP: Even if you plan to dine in, ask for your food to go. My husband and I had enough rice and sides left over that we ate them as our sides with dinner. 

Anyway, you'll choose your side. Assuming the choices don't change, you'l choose from congris (black beans cooked into rice), yellow rice, or white rice with beans. Whatever you choose will be generously poured in the main compartment of a three-segment box. Next, you'll choose your entree. Today, we had a choice of lechon, fried pork chunks, roasted chicken, or fried tilapia. I assume these rotate. Finally, you'll choose your side from tostones (flattened, fried, unripened plantain), maduros (caramelized over ripened plantain), or yucca con mojo. I also saw a tamale, but I don't think that was an option as it is available a la carte. 

I chose the yellow rice, lechon, and tostones. Let me just say that this is the best Cuban lechon I've had in Las Vegas. I say this because lechon can often be dry if you don't get your meat from the glorious juicy areas of the pig. This lechon was juicy and savory as can be. I have an appreciation for onions (*waves weirdo flag*). Some places will undercook the onion (leaving a raw aftertaste). Others will cook them to the point of caramelizing them (masking the pork flavor). The onions in this lechon were perfect; translucent, savory, and tender with an added tartness from the mojo). The rice was fluffy and soft. And then the tostones. You know when you fry something so well that it's almost delicate? Yeah. That. These were perfect. 

Service was fast. We were in an out within half an hour. 

OH AND HERE'S THE KICKER - we both got full meals and 1 can of soda each. Our total came to $12.99. You are not out of your mind! You read that right. $12.99!

Some things to keep in mind:
- CASH ONLY (not that you'll need much)
- Most of the guests in line will be ordering in Spanish. If that makes you hesitant to visit, just know you can point and pick. Also, there are employees who speak English... 
- There is no fountain soda (bummer), but they don't only offer Pepsi (#teamcoke #notthatcoke)
- This is not going to be a place where you'd take anyone with dietary needs other than ""carnivorous"" or ""pork lover"". 
- Other items for order included croquetas and tamales. The press in the back suggested there may also be sandwiches.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,5,5,5,EI32adiT7S-ObIWgw-HDXA

The food is just so-so, it's just ok.  No tastier than a plain hotdog or bag of chips.  This place is so ethnic, they don't even know what yelp is.

The place is really simple,  5 dollar plates. You pick a rice, a protein, and a starchy side.  The meats are chicken pork or beef.  The sides are Yuca or fried Yuca.  Sweet platano, or fried plantains.  I don't recommend anything but the plain white rice.  The rice and beans are over done and dry.  The white is made just right.

The meat: Its dry, fairly seasoned.  I don't think food deserves bonus stars just for being cheap.  I agree the portions are huge, but the food is super unhealthy as there is no veg whatsoever.

I do recommend this place when you're broke and wanna get a lot of food for cheap.  Or you're the boss of something and you're treating the staff.  It's literally 2 lbs of food for 5 bux.


Come here if you're just looking to get stuffed for cheap.

Unfortunately, they don't speak English and we were unable to order because we had know idea what anything was other than ""pork"". The only word they said.  There's about six
People working and they lacked communication.   
We love good Cuban and always looking for some great food.  

My husband speaks Spanish and he still couldnt get the gist of what they were saying.  
I hope they do well, they'd do better if we knew what we were about to order.",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,2,0,3,dyQsKcOJzhTKFxds4_YReg

In my experience, you don't get the same quality and treatment from other places like florida caf√© or Havana grill. The employees are so nice and welcoming. The ropa vieja and platanos are my favorite :)",xLr0KUQ0wlFP6FuxHir0PQ,2,0,5,nTr1PSqJiXgBFtPV1_QXsA

Note- they have a new address- they are in the same shopping center (closer to the street) next to Thai BBQ. It is very informal and most employee's English is limited. The one that helped us spoke well enough so we were able to understand here. We will be back.",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,1,0,4,7ozLkXWJam5aEZSLJV0pcQ

We did what someone else suggested and had our food in the togo container as you will have enough leftovers for the next day.,sMwH4-oDgOlOrIA5gCEAfQ,0,0,5,PhTg27RQHqhTZwSdH9P6YA

Both times I have left wildly confused having only a basic idea of what I ordered and thinking to myself, ""What just happened?"" Luckily, I'm willing to eat just about anything twice. Both times I've eaten at Carlito's my stomach was in love and I found myself calculating my next visit.

This is a cafeteria style restaurant and ordering is odd - but just go with it. There are no signs, no labels. You walk to the food counter and start with your rice. Then you pick a meat. Then your side.

My first trip I ordered the white rice that is cooked with black beans, BBQ pork, and plantains. The rice was flavorful, the pork melted off the bone, and the plantains had perfectly caramelized edges. I also ordered two Papas Rellenas. It's the most popular type of croquette in Latin America and it's a delicious fried potato stuffed with ground beef. I was going to bring the second one home for my roommate. It was so good that I ate it too! The mashed potatoes were like butter.

My second trip I landed on the yellow rice (it has some sort of sausage too), pulled pork with onion, and yucca fries. I didn't care for this rice as much but it was still good. The pork was oh-so-salty but in a good way. The meat was fatty and packed with flavor and the onions perfectly caramelized. Don't get me started on the yucca fries. That crunch! That flavor!

The dishes are always changing and I have yet to try something I didn't like and I've tried a lot of things I've loved. I wish there was a lot more guidance on the ordering process and what is being served - but for now, I'll let it slide for another Papas Rellenas. 

Pro-Tip: It's cash only but they have an ATM inside.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,27,18,4,KVqdteLbUVx7fp6hlNRfxw
