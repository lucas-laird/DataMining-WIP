Servers were not very friendly and were slightly rude. We actually noticed them looking at the customers and sort of making fun of people. That  was a big turn off for all of us. It seemed as they didnt want to spend too much time with customers, they were more interested in watching the belly dance performance :-)

The atmosphere and music are great, belly dancers are beautiful and very good performers. 
They serve a 6 course meal, which I really enjoyed. My favorite was definitely desert: chocolate, cinnamon and pastry.. it was heavenly.

Menu is quite simple: 6  course price fixe menu. Shrimp scampi appetizer, ""cinnamon - tomato soup"" (my description, I don't know if it was actual tomato soup), hummus, beef skewers, chicken & couscous, and a chocolate banana pastry with powdered sugar (that can be made with peaches or pear) served with a hot tea.  

I loved that the only utensil available...were your fingers (until the chicken dish & desert).

The flavors were wonderful. Not too little, not too much. Just right. The soup had a cinnamon taste to it which I found delightful & surprising. The skewers presentation was fun: delivered a la pineapple. I really enjoyed these two courses and filled up on these and the shrimp scampi. I really needed to be rolled out of the restaurant...I ate way to much. Unfortunately, I did not care for the hummus. (Did I spell that correctly?)

The decor is stunning and the shaabi/rai music was manna to my abused ears (seriously, did they stop importing music into Vegas in the early 90s?  so much bad music everywhere we went!).  The food was by far the best we had during our trip; you can tell the difference between chefs who make food because they care about food and chefs who design dishes to please the masses, and the chefs at Marrakech are definitely the former.  We were stuffed by the kabobs, but made a valiant effort to eat what we could of the couscous and the sweet bistilla served for dessert.

And of course there was the belly dancing--house dancer Aradia put on an excellent show, full of energy even though the restaurant was not that busy on a Tuesday evening.  I'm a dancer myself and I can say with authority that she is very good, a national class dancer and a great entertainer.

The Moroccan experience at Marrakech is just as good as the food.  The belly dancer was awesome.  She encouraged my wife to get up and shake her booty.

The food is awesome as well.  I like not having to worrying about ordering they just keep bringing the food.  The service is top notch, glass of water always full, never have to ask for more bread and the next course comes just as you wash down the prior course with your beverage.

The place isn't cheap and I got the impression that the menu doesn't change much so I'm not sure if this is a good place to go to more than once a month.  The groups we saw there were having an AWESOME time.  Lots of locals here, this is a good place to go if you want to get off the strip.

There isn't any good Moroccan in San Diego so when SoCal residents drive to Vegas, dine at a place off the strip once and enjoy the entire experience of dinning at a Moroccan Restaurant",5Fk89VCV2ffs1bCBamxFOA,2,0,5,CKStE9MqcL3-laQ9fauODg

353539,2011-05-02,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Angel:  4 Stars: Very intimate and sensual atmosphere. We were greeted by a typical male Las Vegas nightclub host; seeing that we were dining at a venue that promotes itself as an authentic Moroccan restaurant, I found him to be quite out of place. Upon entering Marrakech we found ourselves submerged into a relaxing, and tantalizing ambiance. If you select the basic option you are given three courses, including a dessert. I had a glass of Amazir red, a Moroccan wine, that paired nicely with my meal. This is definitely a delightful place for couples and groups. They had really gorgeous belly dancers who were very ""skilled"" at their profession, Lol. But make sure that if you are brave enough to shake it with these ladies that you have ""CASH AT HAND"" and tip accordingly :o)

Before you are served your hands are cleaned in a cute sort of ritualistic manner. Eating with your hands enhances the overall experience. If you are an average size lady, the portions may be a little big for you. However, I found myself falling in love more and more with every bite. The dessert was too much, but the overall meal kept my taste buds very excited. The servers weren't the most talkative, but I'm not sure if that was a cultural thing and that's just how Moroccan food is presented? Its also very easy to lose track of time, which makes this a great mini escape from Vegas without leaving Vegas.


Alex: 4 stars. I've never had authentic Moroccan food, so I'm unqualified to compare. All I can say is that I was thoroughly impressed with the taste. Very flavorful and well-prepared. We ordered the three-dish meal for $25 each (a solid deal) which came with cooked veggies and dip, chicken with couscous, and dessert. I had no complaints whatsoever about the food. The dancers were great, and made sure to keep the entire restaurant engaged; bring cash for tips to show your appreciation for their talent. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. Dance with the dancers, laugh, drink, be merry. I guess what keeps it from being a true 5-star for me is two things: First, though I love the belly-dancing music, between shows it slips into cheesy Vegas techno and kills the beautiful atmosphere they've created with the interior design and lighting. Second is the Welcome-Factor of the waiters. There is none. It's kind of a ""done yet?"" feeling.

379157,2015-07-25,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"I think I speak for myself when I say dining should be not only a palatable experience but a moral one. Now, where I'm from taking a 9 yr. old bride is not kosher, and neither is a middle-aged man preying on younger women on social media, especially women whose chastity is bound by an oath to God. Now what does that have to do with Marrakech's food? Absolutely nothing, I think.

The chicken I ordered was sprinkled with nuts of some sort. Now, I'm a fairly uneducated man, and to be frank, this ignorance is quite uninhibited, but I do think this chicken's integrity is compromised by such a gratuitous sprinkling of cashews, almonds and walnuts. The sauce was a curry, I think, and yellow, like the sort of ""man"" that fishes women out of their hijab with artful keystrokes and the peacock exuberance of wealth acquired young but earned a few generations ago. Bootstraps come cheaper when your parents couldn't ever be caught dead scraping bitumen out of a barrel for a colonial pound a week.

Also, the most palatable spice to the food here is the triple-filtered tap water and the midriffs swishing around our table-tents.

407379,2011-03-20,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Great restaurant.  Husband & I were visiting Las Vegas, had never had Moroccan food, so we decided to give this a try.

We had NO idea what to expect, so we were seated & sat around like goons for a minute (despite the fact that the restaurant has a big placard right inside the front door describing what to expect).  

As mentioned in most reviews, this is a prix fixe menu (about $40 a person) serving six courses.  No menu necessary.  

Everything was very good.  The highlight was the 'salad' (really more of an appetizer plate, but described on the menu as salad, and served as the third course), with beets, carrots, hummus, tzatziki, and olives.  Loved it.  The steak skewers were also fabulous.  The chicken and couscous was pretty bland, but by that time, we were so stuffed with great food that we could forgive this.

Also worth note - the dessert.  Holy cow.  I'm not a big fan of dessert, but this was amazing...a huge plate of something similar to baklava.  Lots of phyllo dough with walnuts, honey, some type of fruit (pear?  apple?) and baked.  And lots of it!  Yyeeaahh!!!

Service was good...they just kept bringing the food.  My husband thought the belly dancer was great & wished that she had performed more than once in the hour & a half that she was there.

As other reviews note, tons of good food.  Prix-fix menu.  First course, shrimp scampi, was happily devoured by all.  The soup dish was the ""ho-hum"" course; nothing bad but not very interesting either.  The hummus / baba ganoush course was really high quality with bonus flourishes like olives and marinated carrots to take it up a notch.  Meat skewers were really tender, very above average.  Chicken cous-cous was a bit ""ho-hum"" for me but others in my family insisted it was amazing.  All this in a cozy setting (looks like you are in a tent) and multiple performances by some rather sexy belly dancers who I think did a good job keeping the female guests (e.g. my wife) feeling engaged and part of the fun.",0F92UCErUmsAdXCfcnAbCw,0,0,5,1nOFZ0Cx3lQBSLZi4MAP-g

The waiters were nice.  Service was good.  The mojito wasn't that great, but the wine was good and reasonably priced.  

I've never had Moroccan before, but love Mediterranean food, so was optimistic.  The food at Marrakech was great.  We did the prefix and everything as really good.  Started with a soup, then hummus plate, then shrimp, a chicken dish, and desert.  There was way more food than needed, but they were nice about letting us take the leftovers home so as not to go to waste.  

They also had a belly dancer, which was pretty cool.  Although it was a bit uncomfortable as we didn't really know what the etiquette is for tipping.  We gave her a few singles, and she seems to appreciate it.  So hope we did the right thing.  

With food, wine, and tip it came out to be about $70 per person, which I think is reasonable.   Overall I'd definitely recommend Marrakech.  Good food and experience.",Pzp1sK6WissJ7LaQ58U4qw,0,0,4,9akXA6OTaTJONkF2aHGrnA

576390,2012-01-03,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"We spent the New Year's 2012 eve there. It WAS a unique dining experience alright - nevermore, thank you. Not fun. Not tasty. Disappointing in every respect.  
My husband is Moroccan. Naturally I had high expectations for the place knowing the taste of Moroccan cuisine. Trust me, the taste of dishes could not have been more disappointing. How can you guys call yourself Moroccan restaurant when you cook the cous-cous without the basic ingredients?!?! The cous-cous we had was cooked without pumpkin, potato and chickpeas!! Only cabbage. Well, some slices of carrots, too. While It's the Traditional Moroccan dish! Unbelievable... 
Now for the dessert. Bastilla filed with chocolate and banana? Where did you get that recipe? It's a BAD mix of Moroccan and American tastes, if this is whet you were attempting to recreate. Hardly eatable... 
Now for the famous mint tea. We were not served that at all. Guess, they have decided that free champagne is a good substitute. Well, it was not. By the way, from the color of tea we saw being poured to a couple from another table, we can assume that it is not the best-tasting Moroccan tea either.     
As for the entertainment, the dancing lady was lovely! BUT if we had entered the restaurant 10 minutes later - we would have missed her completely. And that was the ONLY entertainment offered for the New Year's eve. Don't even want to mention the music screaming as loudly as it only could from the speakers above our ears. And it was some stupid pop songs, not even a hint to oriental tunes!! Or was it a special offer due to the New Year's eve? Another bad idea, gentlemen.  
The entourage is shocking at first as everyone are sitting in front of each other, in one large hall. But you get used to it, so OK for a change.  
All in all, we could NOT have been more disappointed by the restaurant. It by no means cost $140. The only reason why I asked the waited to pack the remains of our food to-go, was cuz I wanted to give the bastilla and the cous-cous another chance by eating them at home. It did not help...",nWYiD1XCsQfnizSCaOI3zg,2,0,1,EkifHLy0nDZyRCWJyLv9hw

Basics, dimly lit, good for groups (make a reservation...this is good too because there's plenty of food to go around), loud (esp every 30 min when the belly dancing starts up). You will definitely be propositioned at least once during the meal to dance with the belly dancer, and hey! why not? :) You're in Vegas and what happens here stays here right?

I would come here just for the experience, takes about 2 hours. And if not for the experience, for the DESSERT! Gooey, hot amalgamation of bananas, chocolate and slivered almonds wrapped in phyllo dough, baked up to a flaky moon of perfection and covered with a heaping helping of powdered sugar and cocoa powder.

TIP: come hungry, bring friends, don't eat everything that you see since you probably want to save room for the rest of the meal.

Gluten Free: also, came with a friend who was allergic to gluten. They asked at the beginning of the meal and make entirely separate dishes to make it gluten free. That's an automatic plus one star for me. Sadly the dessert I mentioned above was cold and chunky since phyllo dough was out of the question so it was not baked, but otherwise still tasty.",yVIThBMSPT8FapfuRnAv3g,1,0,5,pDTNLRPSzgATkSU9ca_utA

1) Only two prix fixe menu: a six course for $39.95, or a three course for $24.95
2) The food is good, but not amazing. Definitely not the best hummus, cous cous, or kebabs I've had, but still good.

I had the three course menu, which has two options. The first is soup, salad, and then the entree. The second is salad, entree, and then the dessert. I don't really have a sweet tooth, so I went with the former.

The soup was a lentil soup, that came with some bread. The bread was nothing special, but I thought the lentil soup was excellent, especially since I'm not a fan of lentils. The salad was basically some carrots, olives, and cucumbers with hummus and a eggplant sauce/hummus. I enjoyed both and thought it was definitely above average. For the entree, I had roasted chicken and vegetables over some cous cous. The cous cous was excellent, flavorful and moist, while the chicken was just decent. 

The real star of the meal was the pot of mint tea I ordered. Slightly on the sweet side, but it was some of the best mint tea I've ever had. Highly recommended.

I've been to Marrakech Morroccan Restaurant twice in the last two years, both times were very enjoyable experiences. They serve a fixed price menu containing several dishes.

The Morrocan Mojito's are delicious, and a nice 16oz glass for $14. 

The staff was attentive (almost too eager to clear our plates when we were taking a pause due to our overloaded bellies), and very friendly. 

The belly dancing is outstanding, and there is lots of audience participation. Good vibes and great food at the Marrakech. Plan to spend about 2 hours there to get the full experience.",lE5DZEhnbSlwHkXbvla-jw,0,1,4,qb4ezUQLbEXglTjPYxnOhQ

We opted for the six course meal (we had fasted in preparation) but still could not eat all of it. While it's not commonly advertised, they do a smaller prix fix and an a la cart menu as well, so if you're not prepared for the six courses, ask or they probably won't tell you about it. The inside of the restaurant is amazing and beautiful; it really makes the ambiance fun and probably even makes the food taste better (not that it needs to, it's wonderful too). Every course was great even though we couldn't eat all of it and they do have utensils too, thankfully. The dancers were fun to watch and they weren't too pushy in getting people to dance (usually the drunk or bald guys would get picked on).

This Moroccan restaurant has figured out a working business model.  They use the lack of other Moroccan restaurants in the area, plus belly dancers, plus interesting decor, all to distract customers from the sub par food and poor service.  

We did the 6 course tasting menu for $40.  Much of the food tasted like it was sitting out at a buffet, and some unhappy waiter just brought it to our table.  For the money that you will spend here, you can actually go to a good buffet, even though you may have to get the food yourself.  

The mint tea at the end of the meal was heavenly.  It was soothing, and left a very pleasant taste on my palette, which helped distract from the other flavors that were there prior.

I was in Vegas last week for my best friend's bachelorette/birthday weekend. While planning, we needed to figure out a dinner location that would fit the occasion, not too expensive and had a prefix meal. I came across Marraheck Moroccan, got the bride to be's approval and made a reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was as though we were transported to a fancy tent in Morroca, the decorations were beautiful and there was a lot of drapery. We had a little issue with the seating at first because they had us all side on couches on one side of the table (not very good for conversation) and when we asked to be switched to another table or for more chairs on the other side of the table, our waiter was not accomedating, so I went and grabbed chairs from another table so that we could have 3 girls on one side of the table and 4 girls on the other side. HOWEVER, i must say that our waiter made up for his original rudeness because when we ordered our meal, we told him that we had one vegan and one girl who cannot eat cinammon, he made sure that their meals fitted their needs. There were two belly dancers who performed during the night, super fun to watch. Especially when we pushed our bride to be to go dance. We got the 6 course meal, and wow...everything was absolutely delicious! We were going clubbing after dinner, so I didn't plan on eating too much since I didn't want to have a little belly, but I COULD NOT stop eatting! Everything was just sooo good! When dessert came, they made a small one with no cinnamon and one vegan one to accomedate the the diets of the allergic and vegan. That was super nice of them to do that. I forgot to mention the yelp deal so we didn't get the 15% discount, but I was so happy with the meal that I don't care.

Well, I saw the great reviews for this restaurant and a groupon deal so I bought it as a gift for them. They showed up to the restaurant and the RUDE lady at the front told them that since they didn't have a reservation, they can't eat there, and that if they wanted to eat there they would have to come back ANOTHER DAY and that there were other restaurants in the area and that they should try something else. WHAT THE F WORD!??? My poor parents, who are not used to taking cabs (we live in the suburbs) asked if they could help call them a cab, and they said yeah we'll call someone but you're going to have to wait outside. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET MY PARENTS WAIT INSIDE FOR A CAB!! It's December, winter, and I double checked the website and did not see mandatory reservation required anywhere!!!! While they waited outside for 45 mins, people walking by looked and stared and no cab ever came. My dad had to go hail a cab outside in the main streets for them.

They decided to go to this restaurant on a weds night at 6:30, and were rudely turned away and after cabbing here from their hotel, had to cab back. My mom said she has never felt so lowly, degraded, and embarrassed before from this awful customer service and it was a horrible way to end their 25th anniversary.

1170306,2013-11-03,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"TL;DR - Overpriced and underspiced.

Cons: Not worth $40 for dinner. Maybe $30, but still pushing it for me.The soup was clearly from a can - tasted like cheap Campbell's vegetable soup to me, no flavor, had that tin taste. Bread was okay, nothing special, clearly purchased from a factory. Everything was underspiced and a little bland, which sucks because one of the things I love (and expect!) about food from this region is the flavor. The red wine I had was good, but not $11/glass good. Maybe $6.

Pros: kebabs were yummy, put a couple drops of lemon juice on them for a different flavor. Can't go wrong with hummus and cucumbers. The shrimp (though a bit tough) had a nice sauce. Dessert was yummy and went well with coffee (they give you mint tea, but ask for the coffee instead). Chicken was pretty good. Large portions, my party of 3 had plenty of food to go around. Decor was lovely and the dancing girls were a crowd pleaser. Service was spot on.

I think this was once a nice restaurant experience with authentic food, but management was losing money or wanted to make more money so they cut corners with the food. Typical, but sad. Marrakesh, make a fresh soup and your own bread. Stop outsourcing. Add a little love and flavor into the food. You're not doing yourselves any favors by Americanizing your menu. Sure, you advertise and get the tourists... but what about the locals like myself who would make it a regular thing if you had better food? Do you want someone to spend money once or many times?

The restaurant was very cozy and intimate. They even pour rose water over your hands so you can wash them at your table.  The experience itself was hands down amazing!

Now you gotta come here HUNGRY cause they do offer a 6 course meal (yes 6 courses) and I must say, by the time we got to the main course we were FULL. Probably our fault since we loaded on the Morroccan bread ;) But that bread dipped in the shrimp scampi sauce...heaven!  I especially loved their hummus and babaganoush plate. If you're like me and love roasted eggplant, you'll love the babaganoush - it was packed with so much flavor! The beef kabobs were so yummy that I wished they offered more especially since I thought that was the main course, but I was wrong. The main course came after and honestly, we were already stuffed we just couldn't eat anymore. Which was okay since I wasn't too impressed with the chicken and couscous. The chicken was on the dry side and I think the only thing I enjoyed was the veggies on the plate. But if you love sweets, you'll love their dessert though.  It reminded me of a huge baklava puffed up. It was yummy!

Now for the entertainment, the main reason the husband took me here for my birthday - the belly dancers. It was the first time for both of us and it was fun! There were two dancers that night.

If you're feeling adventurous, or just need a break from the Vegas strip, make your way here. It's not too far but far enough that you forget about the chaos that's just around the corner.

Located in a non-descript shopping plaza, you wouldn't realize you were actually about to be transported to Morrocco itself. The decor is amazing - you are in a tent! The tables are low, everything is authentic... nothing big-box manufactured.

We opted for the 6-course meal and I assure it's a lot of amazing food and it's great because it leaves all the thinking to the restaurant and yes, they have a vegetarian option.

Here's the breakdown:
1st course: sautéed shirmp (mushrooms for me) in a garlic butter/white wine reduction sauce.. O.M.G. I ASKED FOR BREAD SO I WOULDN'T NEED A STRAW TO DRINK THE SAUCE.

2nd course: lentil soup. Was really well flavored... you could really taste the cumin, fennel seeds.. it was vegetarian. Oddly they didn't give you utensils... but now that I am thinking about it, we didn't use utensils throughout the meal.. (ah, now that wonderful rose hand wash at the beginning of the meal makes so much sense).

3rd course - kebobs served on a pineapple. Delish and perfectly cooked

4th course: hummus, babaganoush - good hummus. I think it was more of a palette cleanser

5th course: chicken and couscous - wowza. The chicken (according to the hubster) fell off the bone. The couscous was really good too... cooked in a saffron broth

6th course: I can't even begin to explain what this was... it was like a bakalava, banana pie cake thing of amazing-ness. I wish I had more room for it.

So go... pack your stretchy pants and dancing shoes (because you must dance with the belly dancer), venture off the strip and go to Morroco.",L_y7WM4B6MtqRtSsFzuzvg,6,3,5,SeQsprWcf3uB_zSKTycUfg

Great Service  - Our server, Ali, made this a top notch experience.  He was pleasant, charming, attentive, quick, and very accommodating.  

Good Food - Some of the 7 items were hits and some were miss, but overall the meal was satisfying.  The shrimp seemed a bit overcooked, it was almost rubbery.  The soup that followed was like canned soup.  Everything that followed was good, especially the kabob which was flavorful and tender.  There was so much food that by the 6th plate, I was so full that I could barely put a dent in the chicken or dessert.  Thankfully they let you take leftover food home.  

Ambiance - The restaurant itself is very cozy and ethnic looking, at least that's what it's going for.  I've never been to Morocco so I don't know how authentic it all is, but they did a good job in making the customer feel like they've left Vegas and entered a Moroccan lounge. 

Talented belly dancers - they come out once every hour and a half and dance for 10 minutes.  

NEGATIVES: 

Lack of menu options

Shrimp tasted like rubber

Soup tasted like canned soup

CONCLUSION:

If it were my restaurant, I'd replace the shrimp scampi plate with something else, get rid of the soup, and maybe throw some more options in the menu that allow the customer to have more variety.  The current 7 course meal is fine for the first time customer, but I don't see how this business would attract repeat customers using the same foods.",rhEF7nrppbzsj0NYA7lzAw,0,0,4,8vBBFwM88eO-vqB7uoyOpw

Ok, I dont think that's really one word, but when you find a great place to eat and be entertained, you make some exceptions.   My military unit was staying nearbye this restaurant and a frequent visitor (new guy in the unit) wouldnt shut up about this place.  After finally being convinced to try the place, I soon found out the reason why he was so enthusiastic.

First of all they have a six course meal and it IS delicious.  From the start all the way til the end the food was delicious.  The very first dish was the shrimp scampi - this dish was the best shrimp scampi dish i've ever  had.  One word of advice, you have to try the bread and dip into the savory shrimp scampi sauce.  The next dish was the lentil soup.  I've only had a few bowls of this stuff, but the way this place makes it, it comes out very lemony and tasty.  The steak skewer was perfectly grilled and the rest of the meal was great. 

To finish it off, the tea that they give you was the perfect way to end it. Who would have ever thought that an extremley hot, sweet tea would be a nice way to end a meal.  Thanks to my friend who was so insistent on going here.  I've now found a place I must head to every time to vegas.  You can have your buffets, but this place rocks and I will now be a frequent customer every time I head to vegas.

So, when I saw a groupon for it we snatched that baby up and booked a reservation for July 4th weekend, during our recent trip to Vegas. The coupon helped tremendously, since there were 7 of us and this place is a tad on the expensive side, but for all you get, it is surely worth the price. 

Based on the food alone I would probably rate this restaurant 3 stars, but who goes here JUST for the food - no one. The experience is well worth the price and even though the food isn't the BEST I've ever had, it is pretty good. Stand outs for me are the shrimp appetizer with bread, which is so good. Soaking up that buttery, garlicky sauce with fresh bread is excellent. I love the hummus and pickled carrots. The soup is OK (I would cut this course out if I could). The beef kabobs are the BOMB! They are so well cooked and extra yummy. The chicken is moist, and the cous cous is good, but nothing special. The dessert was different this past time than it previously was. I liked how it used to be - nuts and chicken- this time it was bananas and chocolate and I'm allergic to bananas and I didn't know they were in there, so that was a bummer. 

The belly dancing MAKES this place. It's fun, and I love seeing my Husband get pulled up to dance with the girls. Cracks me up every time. I would say go to Marrakech for the experience at least once when you are in Vegas.

I was greeted by a hostess right outside the door.  As I took a few steps passed the door, I had to step through another doorway with hanging curtains-- then, I was transported to what seems like a magical far-away place (I had never experience anything like this before!!) The decor and setting of the place was outstanding! I felt like I was in an authentic Moroccan tent with draping fabrics on the ceilings; hookahs in the corners; low-leveled seatings and tables; dim lightings with lit candles; beautifully printed fabrics and carpets covered every space of the walls. 

This place has a prixe fixe  6 course menu--  $39.96 per person. My favorite was the Beef Brochette (Kabob). It was super (SUPER) juicy, tender and...definitely grilled to perfection! Be sure to dip them into the  two dips from the sampler's plate. The overall dining experience was  3.5/5. Not every dish was a hit nor was it a miss for me. It was definitely fun trying new things.

The belly dancers were amazing. It was mesmerizing to watch and entertaining at the same time. The music was thumping non-stop!!

Overall 3 stars because:
1) Customers cannot order from a menu and are offered only one choice: A Six Course Meal for a fixed price.
2) Though the six course meal clearly mentions Mint Tea which is served along with the dessert, if you want your mint tea earlier with your food they will charge you extra.
3) For 1 person: The six course meal with an added charge for asking for the Mint Tea with my food was $ 54 (tip not included).
4) You cannot eat and leave quickly. The whole thing takes a lot of time and so you should be prepared to spend a lot longer than most places. 

- As you can see this is a more expensive place than the average because you are forced to spend a fixed amount which is much higher than an average entree by itself since you are paying for six courses.

If you wanted to have a meal for less $ than that then this is not a place you want to go to.

If you don't mind the cost, have plenty of time and would like to have a unique experience of being inside a Moroccan tent with soft lighting, music, belly dancing and an authentic feeling ambiance then this is the place for you. Enjoy it!",YnZCux4_W5vt3jsXEtwAmg,4,0,3,WBj2r-YAVqnAFXPLQfTy1w

The only thing I wish is that they didn't rush you with the food - we were only done with one entree before they brought the other ones. 
Otherwise - we were still eating and they would bring out the next entree. Other than that, atmosphere is great, but the belly dancers (who were amazing btw) don't come out every 40 minutes like the waiter told us initially. We got there at 8:00 pm and saw one show, and then at 9:25 the other belly dancer came out... the girls are amazing and it's great to see them dance, but I just wish that they would have let us know that when we came in as opposed to telling us they came out every 40 mins. 

As far as the food goes, it's super delicious. It's a price fixe meal but they're pretty flexible - we were four people and we got 3 price fixe meals. We still had leftovers.

Great food, fun atmosphere, great service.. but when it was time for our party of 31 to split the tab for over $2,300 it became a little difficult to accommodate everyone. The host had checked with management prior to this large engagement as to whether the check could be split among such a large party. Management assured her that it was no problem only to find out upon completion of the meal that there was no other option but to pay it as one large tab. Ridiculous. Not to mention, they tried to charge us for 6 guests that were not in attendance and that reservations had not been made for. Some mix up about the number of people that was supposed to show up. When the host asked to speak to the manager, the guy said he would go get him and he came back as the manager. Aside from that, the entire experience was phenomenal. 

Our party opted for the six course vegetarian Moroccan feast which consisted of sautéed mushrooms and zucchini, harira soup, sampler of hummus, Baba Ghannouj (eggplant/tahini dip), olives, cucumbers and carrots, grilled veggie kabob (zucchini, eggplant, onion, and tomato), couscous platter minus the chicken, and a beautiful dessert pastry filled with fruits, chocolate, and nuts. The prefixe meal also came with mint tea and homemade bread. We had to devour the first four courses without utensils which was really fun because the bread acted as a scooping and soaking element. I was quite relieved when forks appeared for the couscous. I think that would have been challenging to use just hands and fingers.

The entertainment was the highlight of the evening at the restaurant. The belly dancers were talented and beautiful. They came out to dance twice during our visit and brought up some of the guests in our party to do some belly dancing with them as well. The servers were also very friendly, prompt, and attentive.

First you begin with hand washing in rose water, then the six course meal provides a LOT of food. Utensils are provided if you ask, however this is meant to be a very hands-on experience. Hence the hand-washing ceremony.

I had mushroom scampi due to a shrimp allergy, which was out of this world, and my boyfriend had shrimp. My friend had zucchini scampi however because she doesn't eat shrimp or mushrooms. Hers was equally delicious.

The hummus was excellent and I'm a picky hummus person. The harrira soup was fantastic; I make it at home a lot and loved it. I never knew my recipe at home was so ""on target"".

The kebobs were delicious, even the vegetarian option. The bread is addicting from start to finish. Especially when dipping it into the scampi sauce. Next up was the cous cous with Cornish game hen. By now I was just about full but persevered. It was too great not to.

I had an apricot beer to go with my meal with was a perfect choice.

Then there is dessert, a baklava type  dish with Moroccan tea. Both a pleasure to enjoy.

Marrakech offers a set menu with several courses. Simply check out the pics one of the reviewers put up (kudos). No menu. Just a server swiftly giving you the run-down of what will be served. I believe the meal is $40/person.  I'm allergic to seafood and couldn't eat the shrimp scampi. They were very cool about substituting. I had sauteed mushrooms in garlic &  herbs. I dipped the peasant bread in the juices and OMG!! The hummus course was so good and so smooth that I literally want to hop on a plane right now just for a repeat! 

By the 4th course I was stuffed, but the food was so damn good that I just kept going and going! This is one of those places the locals go. So I knew it would be great. Oh, and fellas, the belly dancers are awesome too!

The waiter kindly suggested we only order 2 feasts so our son ate our portions which were very generous.  The meal was pre-set...no ordering of main dishes.  First was large prawns in a white wine, butter, garlic, lemon broth with a huge thinly-sliced loaf of bread.  We dipped with delight and polished of the generous prawns.  Next came a rich Hummus and Eggplant dip. The Hummus had lots of Tahini so it was decadent.  The eggplant dip was similar to Babaganoush but more smokey-flavored and otherwise lightly spiced.  Large lemony pickled cucumbers and sweet pickled carrots along with a small selection of Mediterranean olives were very fresh accompanied the dips well.  Unfortunately one was not quite pitted all the way and I nearly broke my upper back molar. Please be careful when eating these.  There was filling, flavorful lentil soup too.

Next were two large tender kabobs of Filet Mignon steak cubes.  Now after all this we got a huge plate of couscous and (chicken?) on top.  The meat could have been another poultry as there were thinner bones than usual.  It was tasty but we were almost too full already.  A very large phyllo-pastry filled with dates, bananas, nuts with chocolate sauce drizzled on top was also included for desert.  We also ordered traditional Moroccan mint tea for $10 at the start of the meal.  The waiters, who were gracious and relaxed poured it several feet above the glasses to aerate it and then filled the pot for us at least 6 times.  It was very sweet and strong of mint flavor.  I would highly recommend ordering this to compliment your meal.  

Lastly the dancer was Acadia and she was an amazing belly dancer who could undulate her belly and shimmy her entire body simultaneously.  She was sweet and has been dancing here for years.  She allowed my son to dance with her and we got great pictures for his Instagram.  I wish I had brought a $20 just for her but I did add it to my tip and asked the waiters if they would give that portion to her.  This is an exceptional restaurant.  Well worth the price with high quality food.  You will not leave hungry and you can't help but enjoy yourself in the laid-back, darkened and romantic setting with the high quality food, exotic belly dancing and high class waiter service.

With the Groupon, we had the 6 course meal, which was DELICIOUS!!  Every course that came out was made to perfection and in just the right proportions.  My favorites were the shrimp and lemon garlic sauce.  The bread dipped in the drippings were scrumptious.  And the Beef Kabobs were perfect.

The Belly dancer was pretty cool.  She was amazing, and everyone had a great time!  She moved through the room gracefully, and encouraged people to get up and dance with here.  The music they played was perfect, and just loud enough where you felt like you wanted to get up and dance, but could still carry on a conversation with your friends.

Cab fare from the strip, and back, was about $30 total.

-3. *Marrakech Sampler*-Hummus (garbanzo/ tahini dip), Baba Ghannouj (eggplant/ tahini dip), Moroccan olives, cucumbers & marinated carrots: awesome  hummus, and carrots were too pickled for my taste
-4. *Beef Brochette* (Kabob)- stabbed in a pineapple, these grilled beef steak kabobs were tender &  delicious! excellent presentation and flavor ;]
-5. *Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Djaj* (Chicken)- this came with variety of veggies, my favorite was the butternut squash in the mix and the chicken was juicy and delightful.. I was too full to eat a lot of it, but did taste it's goodness, MmMmm
-6. *B'stilla* (classic Moroccan pastry stuffed with bananas, nuts & chocolate. Topped with heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon and served with traditional mint tea).. great dessert reminds me of a filled crepe and tasted light and fluffy

They had 2 belly dancers the night I came: one thicker belly dancer and the second belly dancer was more slender and fit. Both were great and friendly which added for great entertainment with their music, decor, ambiance, and dinner crowds.

2172278,2010-11-05,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Oh My God - Such a great experience. Everything from the company, to the food, to the ambiance, to the entertainment was amazing. 

First of all it's off the strip, so you don't have that crazy rush of people coming in and out of the place. It's sort of refreshing, after being surrounded by people 24/7. The place is pretty small, you can probably fit about 50 people in the whole place. So make sure you make a reservation, if you want to get seated right away.

Once you walk in you will notice the great decor. Beautiful bold colors all over the the restaurant, its literally covered top to bottom. The tables/seats are covered in plush cushions, which make you never want to get up from the table.

As far as the food is concerned, everything is on a set menu. It's six courses, the first being shrimp scampi, the second being a tomato based soup, the third being hummus and vegetable platter, the fourth being beef kabobs, the fifth being chicken and couscous, and the sixth and last being a fruit, powdered sugar, filo dough dessert. Everything was family style and amazing. Oh and they really don't give you any silverware, so you have to eat with your hands, good thing they wash your hands with rose water before hand. I really can't tell you which of the six dishes was my favorite, everything had a unique delicious taste. 

The other great thing about this restaurant was the entertainment. Every 15 minutes or so a belly dancer would come and dance about two or three songs. The girls are beautiful and it's amazing how they move their bodies. They also interact with the crowd, they encourage people to come up and dance with them. When I was there some of the crowd was getting too happy - they were making it rain on the belly dancers - throwing lots and lots of dollar bills at them. 

I can't wait to come back again. I will have to take some belly dancing classes before hand, that way I can dance with the best of them!",-hxUwfo3cMnLTv-CAaP69A,0,0,5,5dqAG1gVzhbSgHrdDFeXKQ
2194069,2013-08-19,10,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Who knew they had a traditional style Moroccan restaurant hidden outside the sparkly strips of Vegas?

Welcome to Marrakech.

For just $40 you receive a traditional six course meal that leaves you absolutely stuffed while watching beautiful belly dancers mesmerize you with their vibrating hips. Seriously, what muscles do these girls have that I don't?! Sugar honey iced tea.

So I'm going to give you a disclaimer for the meal that I wish had been there for me to see when I had dined there this Saturday: do NOT have a 6 course meal if you plan on going clubbing later that evening. Just don't do it. Why? Well, after 6 delicious courses you will have no other desire but to curl up into a ball and slip into the inevitable food coma. Nothing else. No really, nothing else. 

That being said, the fare at Marrakech was heavenly. Here's a detailed course by course recap of our FEAST:

1st Course - Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi (sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic): I could not get enough of this dish. We were given two plates of shrimp for the four of us and it was such a great serving. I could not get enough of the sauce and kept dipping my bread in it to munch on. I knew I  was a goner once half of my loaf was already in my belly at after this course.

2nd Course - Harira Soup (lentil, rice, lemon and spices): I usually dislike lentils but I really enjoyed their version of this dish. The flavor of the lentils did not overpower the other flavors and I really appreciated the tomato-lemon essence. True it was probably 90 something degrees outside but I really did enjoy that hot cup of soup!

3rd Course - Moroccan Sampler (hummus, zaaluk, Moroccan style olives, beets & carrots): Wow that was definitely homemade hummus. Wonderfully fresh with a hint of smokiness. We were given even MORE bread at this point (i.e. warm pita) to mop this up with. The zaaluk (eggplant tomato dip) was to die for as well.

4th Course - Beef Brochette (marinated beef kabobs): Beef skewers served on a whole pineapple. Unfortunately I dropped two pieces of my kabob like a child but I really enjoyed my meat. It was a tad chewy but great seasoning.

**Please note that by this course you should make sure that you have car arrangements figured out once you receive this entree otherwise you might be screwed FYI.**

5th Course - Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken (served the traditional way with heaps of vegetables including squash and cabbage): At this point we were totally dying. I think I had 4 bites of this dish and had to call it quits from fear of exploding. The chicken was tender and literally fell off the bone and the couscous were fluffy perfection. Our poor waiter thought we didn't like the food but we reassured him that we did. 

6th Course - B'Stilla (classic pastry filled with bananas, walnuts and chocolate covered with powdered sugar served with Moroccan mint tea): Basically this was a warm, flaky puff pastry filled with all of the above. 

The voluptuous belly dancers entertained us about every half hour during our meal which was a great distraction from our constant noshing.


Overall Marakech was a fantastic and AFFORDABLE dining experience in Las Vegas. Now I will reiterate that the food was great.. but the reason why this restaurant received 5 stars instead of 4 was because the amazing owner drove me and the rest of our party to the Palms after waiting outside his restaurant for an hour for a cab. He took pity on us and offered us the ride since we were sweet (unlike the other see you next Tuesdays that were also outside). What a gentleman! 

Plus, he's hot. Great combo ladies.",AtZ5hAERArUCN-9L6SnoPA,12,10,5,tJ2Tcpx8VMfPCeAYpkgy3A
2205768,2011-03-05,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"I don't have much experience with Moroccan food but it is often mentioned in Las Vegas that if you want to try Moroccan cuisine, the best place to go is Marrakesh. The restaurant is close to the Las Vegas strip and in the same plaza as the infamous Spanish tappas restaurant, Firefly.

The inside of the restaurant is decorated elaborately and feels like a real life set of Aladdin. If half of a restaurant is made by its ambiance, then Marrakesh has it nailed. After you are seated around a circular table, a service staff member comes by with a bowl and a pot of rose scented water, and you are asked to cleanse your hands.

The two items worth noting were the Moroccan style shrimp scampi which comes out as the first course and the beef brochette which comes out on skewers (essentially a kabob) planted in a pineapple. The Moroccan bread which is served like a bread basket throughout the entire dining experience was actually one of the highlights.

The lemon herb chicken accompanied with cous cous as the main course was actually a bit of a disappointment. The cous cous seemed bland and the chicken equally under seasoned. The dessert, which was amazing on the first bite, seeemed disastrously sweet on the second, and almost inedible by the third.  

Another part of the dining experience at Marrakesh was the live belly dancing show and the loud Moraccan music that is piped overhead. While the show and the music was enjoyable at first. It became more of a nuisance to anyone that was trying to have a conversation over dinner. This isn't a restaurant you would take a friend you want to catch up with.

This restaurant seems ideal for partying with a large group. The food was decent, and the atmosphere enjoyable the first 30 minutes. I'm not sure if the entire dinner was worth the 40 dollars. Service was timely and impeccable.",lcbJ_02EYZ0g1Mu6HNPzsQ,1,0,3,lmzli42TpfkVI55MBgLfpg

Visited her with my Morrocon friend, and opted for the 6 course prix fixe meal for $50. 

The venue was great, the ambiance was nice and super authentic. We got to wash our hands, eat with our hands and try some cool dishes.

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the ambiance itself. 

The starter shrimps were okay, and my friend noted that they weren't authentic at all. 

The second dish was the lentil soup, which was a mix of lentil, rice, chickpeas, and tomatoes. We enjoyed the soup.

The third dish was the Morrocon salad which came with cooked carrots, hummus, babaganous, and cucumbers. Surprisingly, the carrots were amazing, the dips were nice, and the cucumbers were... Cucumbers.

The fourth dish was the beef skewers. Their presentation was beautiful as they came skewered into a whole pineapple. I really enjoyed the skewer, made me want more!

The fifth dish was the couscous with chicken. This dish was absolutely horrendous, both me and my friend took two bites and let the entire plate go to waste. One of her favourite meals is couscous and she was really looking forward to this dish, unfortunately it was a disaster and not authentic at all.

The sixth and final dish wad the dessert with tea. The tea was fantastic but the dessert was awful. Banana completely overwhelmed my taste buds so we took two bites and let it all go to waste.

There was also a belly dancer which came out periodically. I find belly dancers really awkward, especially when I'm at dinner. However, it's Vegas, so other people seemed to really be enjoying it.

Overall this was a good one time experience, but I would never want to come back again as more than half the food sucked. I'm surprised this place is rated so high, I'm assuming it's the experience as oppose to the food that people enjoy.",jkBOSB5CBB_omGWIHKCIpg,1,1,3,Aqzr_f5X1x7K8bSKCOhjHg

Earlier in the day we had been online trying to figure out where to eat that night.  There are so many places to choose from in Vegas as you all know.  We wanted to try something different from anything we've tried before.  This fit the bill.  

We were greeted by the owner, he appears to greet all incoming customers and were promptly seated. I liked the ambiance because I've never been to a place like this. It seems like you are sitting in a large tent and the decor goes well with the food.  The service here was excellent, very friendly and prompt.   I thought the food was very good, but I think the prices were high and your only choice on the menu is the multi course meal.  It may be beneficial for them to add items to the menu where you don't have to get the multi course meal, so that people will come back more often and have more choices.  

The shrimp was very good, as well as the hummus, soup and kebobs. By the time we got to the main entree I was stuffed and felt bad that I couldn't eat much of it although I did like it.  The meat in the main entree was very tender.  Somehow I managed to eat the dessert which was very light.  I can never pass up dessert.

The dancers were very good, although for whatever reason it made me feel uncomfortable when they were dancing at our table.",QgCT8TI6BNvLrkAbRhjpPQ,1,0,4,RWHlZLr7ckAq3liId9NGGA
2354489,2011-04-23,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Marrakech is an excellent venue if you're looking for a set price, great for large groups and adds that extra spice with it's authentic Moroccan decor. 

It's as if you're transported directly to Morocco as the host leads you through the draped red velvet curtains into the restaurant. Fabric as far as the eye can see, cozy couches, plush benches and intimate little seating areas serve as this restaurant's dining space. It feels as though you've stepped into a Moroccan themed living room. 

Side note: The ladies restroom is almost as big as my apartment (ha), complete with table and chair (as if sitting on the toilet is not relaxing enough, perhaps a waiting area for potential ""drop off""? Ha ha, not sure). 

Upon arrival, your server may or may not see the urgency in taking your order right away, I've had two sets of experiences with the staff there. Once you place your beverage order, the feeding frenzy commences! 

The food is a 6 course set menu with a vegetarian option (in which I thoroughly enjoyed). First you will have to cleanse your hands in a table side experience where the server pours rose water over all hands dining at the table (not sure how ""clean"" rose water actually gets your hands, but they smell delightful after wards!). 

Shrimp scampi (or garlic mushrooms), soup, bread, bread, and more bread. Kabobs, chicken with veggies and what I like to call Moroccan ""rice/pasta"", cous cous, and some powdered sugar drenched pastry for desert accompanied by a super SWEET tea. 

All in all the experience is fantastic, hot belly dancers, great variety of Moroccan music, decent service, and tasty eats. 

Bring a date or bring a group, the set menu and fixed price definitely is a plus. (Cash a bond or liquidate your assets for the drink menu though.. yikes!)",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,1,0,4,Z3U29THTkV9HWQh_LA9MBg

  I've been to Marrakech twice now, not many restaurants have blown me away on first impression the way this place has.  You won't forget your first time here.  The second time, the magic wasn't quite there, however still good, so maybe its a place to go once for a date, but not necessarily often or repeatedly, especially considering the food selection is planned for you and it's always the same.

  FOOD:  The 6 course meal includes a shrimp scampi, a kind of lentil soup, a sampler including humus, dips, olives, and veggies, beef kabobs, a chicken platter, a Moroccan dessert, and hot tea to drink. (There is also an option for vegetarians)
  All of the food was pretty solid, the shrimp, beef, and humus sampler were my favorites, all 4/5's.  And although the food will not disappoint you, what's going on around you is where Marrakech really kills it...

  ATMOSPHERE:  It looks like you're eating in a tent, sitting on low comfortable couch seats, with interesting wall hangings around you, and loud middle-eastern music playing.  Warm, refreshing towels are  used to wash your hands.  A beautiful belly-dancer comes out and really puts on a show.  She made my date blush because we were trying to tip her but she wouldn't stop gyrating her hips, so she couldn't get the bills in her waste band.  Silverware is optional but they recommend you use your grubby little digits to feed your face.

  BOTTOM LINE:  The place is crazy authentic.  Admittedly I've never been to Morocco, so I wouldn't know.  Okay, so I've never eaten at another Moroccan restaurant.  Whatever.  The point is that this is what I would think is totally authentic, and it was really really really cool.  I recommend it highly to anyone out there who hasn't yet made this trip, you are totally missing out on a very unique and entertaining experience.

  NOTES:  On one occasion the owner was there and was genuinely concerned about what we thought.  It turned out we both grew up in NJ, so I totally Facebook added him.  He seems to check in there often.  Super, super nice guy.
  Also, as others have mentioned, there are Groupon discounts available from time to time, so grab that bad boy up if you see it selling.

The music, and ambiance is upbeat and sexy, which will undoubtedly make you want to gyrate alongside the belly dancer. The drinks are well worth it it here as they are STRONG! I loved this experience. It's definitely worth exploring, but be advised that finding a cab after is a bit tedious. The restaurant called a cab for us.

This restaurant is located in a small plaza so parking can be tough. The ambiance seemed casual with very dim lighting and loud music. You'll get right into the feel of the atmosphere with belly dancers around the restaurant.

We came with a group of friends so they ordered for us. A variety of dishes were served one at a time while we sat on a couch with a lower table, like a coffee table. We started off with an appetizer that included hummus, olives, and dipping sauces. The main dishes were tasty but I don't know the names of them. We had vegetables mixed together and also meat skewers served vertically on a plate. When all the courses have been served, we were pretty full. The dessert was something I've never had before. It tastes like bananas and chocolate between crispy flakes but looked like a round cake. We were too full to finish it so we took it to go.

My first time visiting a restaurant with this type of atmosphere and food so I'm not sure how the food should taste, but I enjoyed it.

After driving from Los Angeles, seeing a show, and wandering around, this was the kicker at the end of the night...and it didn't disappoint.

Marrakech is a very unassuming restaurant from the outside.  It looks like a regular hole in the wall joint, with nothing spectacular going on inside.  This is where this facade ends.  Once we stepped in, we felt as if we'd been transported to a distant land, where the royalty had lavish tents filled with food, drink, and debauchery.  The interior had a beautiful, and romantic appeal which seduced us with beauty, aroma, and ambiance.  We were lead to our section of the ""tent"" and began our meal.  It was explained to us that the menu is prix fixe, and if we had any preferences (vegetarian) to let them know.  We did not, so they began to serve us.

Before the meal started, they washed our hands in rose water over a beautifully elaborate bowl, and we knew that we were in for a treat.  Next, they began to bring out the food.  Each dish was extravagant, and each dish progressively tasted better and better.  We were wowed by the presentation of the dishes, and the flavors exceeded even the visual appeal of the beautifully prepared dishes.

Just when we thought we were done, they brought out the dancers.  Now this was a year into our relationship, so I began to avert my eyes from the dancers, and enjoy the company with whom I was spending my time.  My fiancee, however, thought it would be a good idea to make me dance with the dancer.  I obliged, and after an embarrassing (but fun) dance, I was affirmed of the excellence of this place.

We have tried looking around for somewhere similar in our area, but have yet to try something, since this was one of the best dining experiences we had.  We have never found Moroccan food to even come close.",HMDFHc9jk8J-clirUp72kg,1,1,5,_DSOKZinyKr6SRtlAApF7A

We took advantage of the 6 course meal. The first four dishes were amazing. They came out quickly and were quite tasty.  We had totally overlooked the fact that our waiter never smiled and had no personality.  We were having a great time. 

The meal started with some fresh baked bread.  The bread was great, even better when dipped into the fourth course, the hummus.  Naturally when the waiter came over to clear the hummus we told him to leave it. There was plenty of bread and hummus left for dipping. 

We were having a very nice time, laughing and enjoying the belly dancing. Then we started to notice that the food stopped coming.  It had been 20 minutes since the waiter stopped by. We joked: ""maybe we should have let him take the hummus!"". 

10 more minutes passed as we tried to get the waiter's attention. We finally decided to chug our waters so the water boy would come over. ""He could get us our waiter,"" we thought...

We had now been waiting 40 minutes for the chicken to come.  The water boy came over almost immediatly as we finished chugging. We asked if he knew if our chicken was ever coming...He told us he'd go find out.

Shortly thereafter the waiter came over and said ""oh, are you done with this?"" referring to the hummus. We really would have continued to dip, but feared we would never see the chicken if we did. We let it go and a few moments later we got our bland chicken.

Second course was the bowl of soup that tasted like progresso, then the hummus platter that was ok. Then the steak skewers that weren't bad but again not anything great. Lastly the chicken & cous cous. This isn't Moroccan food. 

The other strange thing was the belly dancer was Asian, aren't we at a Moroccan restaurant? Don't get me wrong, she was good. 

For 4 people to dine, with the $65 off for the groupon it still was $102. I'm sorry but it definitely was not worth it. Way better Mediterranean food at Paymons.

But as I said the food was pretty good, just nothing special. I wish that with  with our 6 course meal, that rice was served, and a better variation of meats. I don't know if I would return, this place was just whatever food wise for me.",j2rFqYXfK8dN-CxULh6aUg,1,1,3,dAqmSanMuW0q6HD2hLPUTQ
2823579,2012-12-15,3,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Wow. As I perused the reviews of this place, I was surprised to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews. While I really liked the ambience of the place (reminds me of Babouch in San Pedro, CA), the food was just average. I can say this because, yes, I've been to Morocco and had authentic food (cooked at a home, not a restaurant).

For what we paid per person--some 50.00 w/o alcohol--the place is seriously overpriced. Although you do get several courses, the main dishes (chicken, cous cous) are not properly seasoned and the chicken is not the best quality cut. Probably the best part of the meal was the dessert, which was way too big for three people. 

The bellydancers were fine. We tipped and even got a friend in a picture. He thought the place was great (he lives in Utah) so I guess if at least one of us was satisfied, the night wasn't a total loss. 

But I would never return here again. If you're looking for an ""experience"", give it a try. However, if your entourage is particular about food quality, you may want to think twice, especially since they do not serve a la carte (at least the night we were there they didn't).",B-iOBo0dzfBiI2QJUu-aSw,3,1,3,8PyP0h5Luk_P80prWVHOtw

It was fun and I really enjoyed it :-) We washed our hands in rose water prior to eating of course and that was even enjoyable, I love the smell of rose water :-) The food tasted great from beginning to end, even the mint tea they served at the very end was a little something special :-)

2901968,2012-04-01,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Let me just preface this review by stating why I'm giving it only three stars.  Our waiter told one of girls in our party to ""shhshhh"".  Totally rude because the response was unwarranted.  I understand that Middle Eastern/Persian/Moroccan people have a different culture, especially towards women but, we're in Vegas damn it.  And when you are a server working for tips, you are not to be dismissive.  There were other things during the course of our six course meal that he did/responded to in less than attractive/rude ways.  It's ashamed because the other bus boys/hand washers were polite and diligent.  

We start off the cocktails, who would've guessed? LOL!  Liqour-wise they're stocked but, wine-wise it's pretty much all house.  

One of the highlights of the night was the hand washing.  A guy came out with a kettle of warm rose water to cleanse our hands.  Loved it!  My hands were so soft afterwards.

Shortly after, the first course comes out.  Shrimp, looked like shrimp scampi.  I don't eat stuff that has lived in the water, yuck.  Squiggly goo, blah.  Everyone else seemed to like it though.  

Next was the harira or, lentil soup.  AOK.  Definitely a tomato/vegetable based broth. Not too spicy, not too bland, just okay.  

Third course, Hummers and eggs.  More like hummus, eggplant dip, fresh vegetables, and fresh bread.  The hummus was okay.  The eggplant dip, okay.  It sort of had a bitter salsa taste to it, quite unique.  The bread was good and soothed the bitterness from the dip.  I don't eat veggies, LOL.

""Where's the beef?""  Guess what, beef skewers were our fourth course.  I bet you weren't anticipating that.  For presentation purposes, the skewers were stabbed into a fresh pineapple and had about four or five large bites of beef (assuming sirloin) on them.  They were tender, juicy, smokey, and were really good. 

Cockadoodle Doo was our fifth course.  This was pretty good as well.  Not good enough to go back to Marrakech but, good enough to order it from another Moroccan restaurant.  I could tell the chicken was either slowly stewed or slow cooked in a juicy sauce for many hours.  To get the flavor they attained, the chicken was obviously bone-in.  So beware when chewing because it's dark in there.  This dish also came with couscous.  The couscous tasted as though it was simmered in chicken broth (yum) and had a near perfect texture.

Course number sex. jdofa;je;wajfewioj! Six.  I don't know what the heck you call the dessert bread they served but it had fruits, nuts, and lots of powdered sugar on top.  Tasty but we were all so full by then.  Along with the dessert came the my second favorite thing of the night.  The mint tea.  It looked like battery acid but, it had this heavenly scent and flavor.  I need to find out how to make this and where to buy the ingredients!!!!  I could drink this battery acid-looking stuff everyday!

Hey guys and some girls, there's belly dancers that shake what their momma gave them there nightly.  

As mentioned previously, it's dark in there (remember the cockadoodle doo course).  In fact, when you walk through the front doors you immediately walk through large red drapes and, from there it feels like you are magically transformed into something Aladdin may have dined at back in his day.  The restaurant as a whole, is small for Vegas standards, though the dining room is one large room--predominantly red, with appropriate Moroccan decor.  Tables are very low to the ground and replicate a Moroccan dining experience.  With that, don't expect to have a lot of privacy from other parties.

This was a new experience for most of our party.  It was fun but, our waiter was rude.  Hopefully, you don't get him.  Otherwise, foodwise, ambiance, entertainment, and price I would've rated it four stars.  Our prix fixe meal was a mere $40ish per person.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,3,0,3,D6VsECb5rqL-A6Bx1OMmEg

We left bored out of our minds and out of cash from all the belly dancers shaking their hips for tips. I would definately recommend this place for a large group where you have plenty of conversation between many people. Average wait for each meal was 30 minutes or more.

2927265,2010-03-03,2,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"We probably shouldn't have eaten indian buffet for lunch before coming here for dinner. 

The exterior of the restaurant looks NOTHING like the inside, you are pleasantly surprised the second you walk in through the doors and see the red curtains. The staff however didn't seem very friendly at all, we weren't greeted. The first thing they even said when they saw us was ""do you have reservations?"" Rather than greet us and say hello, that's all they asked us. I wasn't too fond of that, which just made me change my rating from a 4 star to a 3. 

The inside of the restaurant was beautiful! With fabricated walls and intricate designs. I loved it. The low lit room set the mood to a very cool ambiance. This is definitely a place for a nice date or hangout session. 

We didn't realize what we were in for when it came to the food! 6 courses I recall. First we got the shrimp with the bread. That was so good! We ate the shrimp and dipped the bread in the sauce. It came with a whole loaf of bread. My boyfriend and I just kept eating and eating more bread, then the second appetizer came in. That's when the waiter says ""oh, I should've warned you not to really eat much of that bread since you still have 5 more courses."" Wow really? That's something he should've mentioned the second he put down the plate of bread. By that time we were halfway stuffed with the bread. 

The dip was ehh, I pretty much tried to force my boyfriend to eat most of it.

The meat skewers were very tender and juicy and came with a whole pineapple! I don't understand why it came with a whole pineapple though. It's like that wasted that whole thing just to have meat skewers stabbed into it. Kind of strange. 

The main course was very tasty! I didn't finish it though, not even half because I was waay too stuffed by then. Thank goodness they had to go boxes (which they never offered) we had to ask them if they even had any. Otherwise they would've thrown that whole meal away. 

The dessert was different, but good. It was a warm delight! I mainly focused on eating the outer layer of it though, since it was crunchy. I don't think I really touched the inside at all, ha.

The tea was awesome! And the way they served it was out of this world! I wish I could've taken THAT home.

All in all, the food was good, but the service was less than mediocre. It seemed like from the beginning they didn't care for us being their customers at all and the only people they even smiled at or tended to was the party of about 10 people that was going on across the room. 3 stars. I understand they were a larger party, but they were the ONLY other party. 

When we left, we weren't thanked for dining there, nor were we given a nice, ""Have a good night, come back again!"" like most other places would've done. 
I'd like to come back again. Hopefully I'd have a better experience though",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,2,3,cEiARqvu7D3pugpiFyeUIQ

Walking into the restaurant was a surprise itself! This place is located in a strip mall off of Paradise, nothing too exciting...yet the interior is absolutely beautiful. Decorations cover the walls, low tables are in the room, fabric drapes from the ceiling with lanterns dangling as well. The room is lit very dimly as well...this is an ideal place for a date, albeit a costly one.

The night started with a Moroccan hand-washing ceremony, where the server poured a jug of rose water over Mom and I's hands. It was a neat little touch, and the water left our hands smelling great and feeling clean :)

I'll list the courses in order and talk about each...

1) Sauteed Mushrooms w/ Wine, Oil and Garlic Sauce - We opted to substitute this for the Shrimp Scampi as I don't eat shrimp. The sauce was tasty, although super garlic-ey. Mom thought the mushrooms weren't cooked enough, and to be fair, they didn't look like they had been sauteed at all. I used an entire loaf of the sesame bread they give you at the table just eating the garlic sauce.

2) Harira Soup - This soup was excellent, and tasted more or less like Tomato soup. It had a nice flavor and was served extremely hot.

3) Marrakech Sampler - This plate included Hummus, Zaaluck (Tomato/Eggplant dip), Olives and Carrots. Neither of us like Hummus, so we skipped out, but I thought the Zaaluck was extremely tasty. Mom thought the marinated carrots were alright, but neither of us found the olives very tasty.

4) Beef Brochette - This dish consisted of two beef kabobs that were stabbed into the side of a pineapple. The meat was extremely tasty and included some roasted onions and peppers. I had thought the meat would be much more seasoned and found it somewhat less tasteful than I would have liked, but it was still wonderful.

5) Couscous Platter w/ Chicken - This dish was a pretty big platter and included some cabbage and other veggies mixed in with the Couscous and Chicken. They also gave us an extra container full of chicken broth to add to our food for more flavor. The chicken was amazing. It feel right off of the bone and nearly melted in our mouths. The couscous was cooked perfectly and even the cabbage tasted great as the flavor of the dish overall rubbed into it. 

6) B'Stilla - This was the dessert item, and neither Mom or myself particularly enjoyed it. It's a pastry stuffed with fruits and nuts and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. The mint tea that came with it was AWESOME though.

I also must say that this restaurant has great entertainment in the belly dancing. I've seen many belly dancers, and normally they're not particularly attractive, but the one at Marrakech is gorgeous AND very talented. She had people getting up and dancing with her in the middle of the restaurant, which made for much laughter. 

Overall, this place is worth at least one visit. I wouldn't have gone before simply because $40 per person is a little more than I'd be willing to pay for this. The atmosphere is truly incomparable and the service was wonderful.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,0,0,4,Un3rlNN3855Fi-VKONy3Fw

The server took our drink order and asked us if we had any food allergies. After we said no he told us the first of six courses would be out soon. 

1st course: Shrimp scampi...did I forget to mention that the first 4 courses are meant to be eaten with your hands...pretty cool :) It was so yummy...garlic and citrus jumped out. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and made me excited for the rest of the meal

2nd course: Hummus, babaganush, pickled cukes, beets anld carrots. Loved both the dips although I must say I preferred the hummus.

3rd course: some form of lentil soup that was super hot and tasted kind of boring at first but then started to grow on you. I ended up pounding it because it was so good. 

4th course: Beef skewers that were served sticking out of a pineapple. You must use the bread given at the beginning of the meal to get it off the skewer otherwise you will burn your hands. The meat was cooked just to my liking and the onions had a delicious caramelized flavor.

5th course: We got a fork for this one. Chicken on the bone and couscous. The chicken was so moist and the couscous had a chicken-y flavor. I was getting kinda full  by this course so I don't think I could fully appreciate it.

6th course: DESSERT! A Moroccan pastry with cinnamon, chocolate, cream and bananas. It was light and flaky but I could only have a few bites.

When I first walked in, I was disappointed. I expected quiet and romantic and it was loud and a bit boisterous. But our seats were cozy and close, so it made conversation easy. Once my expectations readjusted, I had a great time.

The music could be a little lower in volume when the dancers come out, and it could be even lower still in between dancers. But the cozy seating and the method of eating made it all cozy anyway. And...the music was mostly quite awesome!

The scampi was scrumptious, though though would have been completely stellar with a bit less salt. My bf's vegetarian version with mushrooms was a neat idea and worked well.

The lentil soup was some of the best I ever had! In fact, all of the food was really good. 

This was a fun night and though I wouldn't eat there all the time, this is definitely  a place to take a group. Aside from the bellydancing, the presentation of the food, hand washing, tea pouring, are all flashy, showy and FUN!

they also have a belly dancer who will come up to your table, wiggle around and stare at you while you are either trying to eat your food or converse with your dining companion. i didn't want to be rude and ignore her, but other people were tipping her and i felt awkward paying attention and smiling politely while she danced around our table without giving her a tip, which would have made me feel creepy, like i was at a strip club or something... maybe i am just too awkward for this place.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,1,0,2,SegE4xbrf23RwtyamNkQHw

Our servers were very attentive.  Based on the prior reviews, I was a bit hesitant but glad I decided to see for myself.

The food was delicious.
1st-Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi: love the lemon wine garlic sauce.  We were dipping the moroccan bread pieces into this flavorful sauce that I had to keep reminding myself not to overdo it since there are 5 more courses to come.  The shrimps were small but cooked perfectly.

2nd-Harira Soup:  this was really good!  I can gulp down 2 bowls of this lentil soup!

3rd-Marrakech Sampler: hummus, eggplant/tomato dip, olives, cucumbers, beets and carrots.  Nothing special

4th-Beef Brochette:  a skewer of tender beef, very tender and has good flavor.  I was pretty full at this point so I ate one chunk and the rest was eaten by my bf.

5th-Chicken couscous (Morrocan Style): The chicken was tender over couscous.  An extra bowl of gravy was brought out in case we wanted more gravy on our dish.  We tasted some of this dish and ask for it to go.  So So full.

6th-B'stilla and hot Morrocan mint tea:  Oh wow, this fluffy pastry, wrapped with filo dough was so yummy with the mint tea.  I wonder if I can just come and have the fluffy pastry and mint tea...that would be awesome.  Anywho, the fluffy pasty was filled with chocolate and almonds, topped with more almonds, powdered sugar and cinnamon.  So good.

The bellydancers were great.  However, since we enjoy our conversation with each other, the music can be a tad bit loud.  

Conclusion:  I probably wouldn't pay $40 dinner for one.  It was a great dinner and experience but not for that price.  Therefore, I am a fan when there is such a deal.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,2,1,4,ieiKQ8b0kRvNsgMhrbW1Ug

You don't get a choice of entries so no honey lamb,  no lemon chicken.   Bastilla is a poor version,  not the chicken and egg we typically get at home.   No wonderful eggplant appetizer. . :-(  $170 wasted.

Shrimp scampi was good  nice  large shrimp cooked to perfection .
Lentil rice soup was good.
Vegetable salad was good and so were the carrots and olives.  The humus was good, but not better than what I make at home or buy at costco.
Beef kabobs were not well seasoned and had no flavor.
The main corse couscous  and chicken with ""steamed vegetables"" had no outstanding flavor.  Tasted like chicken and rice.  
Bastillia was a disaster we were not expecting the bananas and chocolate.  I should have known when it was brought as dessert and not an appetizer .

After you are seated, someone comes by to help wash your hands because you'll be eating with your hands here. Hope you don't mind sharing cooties with your dinner guests! The 6 course meal includes:

Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi - Sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic 
It was a little difficult eating this with our hands because the shrimp was pretty hot. Quite delicious though! Very garlic flavored.

Harira Soup - Lentil, rice lemon and spices 
The bf didn't like this very much because it was on the slightly spicy side. I thought it was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of lentils but this was ok.

Marrakech Sampler - Hummus (Garbanzo/Tahini Dip)/Zaáluk (Eggplant/Tomato Dip)/Moroccan style olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots 
This was my favorite dish! I love their hummus, very very fresh. The carrots were soooo tasty. What did they do to it?! More please!

Beef Brochette (Kabob) - Tender beef marinated & grilled to perfection 
Definitely grilled to perfection here! Yum, I wish they gave more though. We only got to kabob sticks. Goes great with the hummus too.

Royal moroccan Couscous Platter with Djaj (Chicken) - Served the traditional way, with heaps of assorted vegetables including butternut squash & cabbage 
This is the main course. Here you get a fork to eat with. I don't know how they seasoned the chicken but it was lovely. 

B'Stilla - classic Moroccan pastry stuffed with the fruits & nuts, topped with the heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon and served with traditional mint tea 
This dessert is very sweet. I feel they put way too much powdered sugar on top. Too much for even 2 people to finish. We took this to go. Be warned, it get soggy quick.

3943297,2009-04-11,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"What an experience!! My wife and I decided to try this place on our anniversary after finding it here on yelp. It was beyond our expectations and we will most certainly come back with friends and family when we can afford it. 

First off, when we entered the restaurant I was shocked at how small the place is. Everything was in one small room with no source of outside light. Once you pass through the curtains at the entrance it is almost like entering a giant tent! Very awesome ambiance, the lights and the low seats and everything made for a very unique experience. 

It was also really cool when they came to our table with towels and some rose water to wash our hands in! If you aren't aware yet, Moroccan cuisine involves using your hands for most of the meals. So they bring one big plate of food and everyone serves themselves with their hands. Not a big deal for my wife and I thankfully. 

Ok, now for the food. The scampi was yummy, both my wife and I agree it was better prepared than most restaurants would do so. The shrimp was still plump and the sauce was wonderful with the bread they brought out. Careful though, stains aplenty here!

The soup was my least favorite but one of my wife's favorites. I thought it was a little better than canned tomato soup, but my wife thought it was the best she'd ever had. 

The salad was incredible!! I normally don't like hummus but this stuff was insanely good, combine it with the carrots and I was in heaven. Came with a few veggies that are marinated and my wife and I finished it off far too quickly for our tastes.

The skewers were awesome, but I jumped in a little too quickly and burned myself on the onion =P. The meat was perfect though and just melted in my mouth once I could eat it safely, lol.

Mmmm, the chicken. Sadly my wife and I were getting full by this point, but we still tried it. The cous cous was not to my or my wife's tastes, but the chicken was moist and just fell apart in my hands. Excellent cold as well since I took it home as leftovers and enjoyed it the next day.

Finally the dessert.... nearly killed me since I'm borderline diabetic  so I only let myself one bite. Soooo much powdered sugar, lol, my wife enjoyed it but we both agreed it could have used more chunks of fruit inside.

As for entertainment, the dancer was pretty cool and she is quite talented, but I'm thankful she kept some distance from me and stuck to the larger groups. I'd rather not have found myself on the couch later due to my gawking eyes, lol ^_-",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,0,0,4,jX_8sYjJXVSDTupyRygKWw

3989316,2014-04-20,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"This place was on my husband's Vegas bucket list.  As locals, there are places you want to try or things you want to do, but regular life gets in the way.

So, for his 40th birthday, I decided to treat him to this experience on Friday night.  

The decor (which I never comment on) was amazing.  While we were eating our dessert and chillin' a bit, we really had a chance to look around and the place is just so interesting and beautiful to look at.

We started our meals with beer (him) and a mojito for me.  The Marrehech mojito is no joke, by the way.  I probably should not have had the second one, but it was so tasty.

The prefix menu is a crazy amount of food.  A couple of recommendations.  First, eat a baby size lunch that day before going in.  When you get the first course of shrimp scampi, despite the deliciousness of the homemade bread, stop yourself from completely gobbling it all down.  You have a long way to go and if you go too hard at the beginning courses, the main course will arrive and you will have no room!

The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Well seasoned and a good texture.  The second course of the veggies with the hummus was good.  The hummus was the best part.  The soup had a nice kick to it, but I am not a huge fan of rice in my soup, so I just didn't eat the rice.

The steak was amazing.  But all of this left me to look at the chicken and couscous with sadness.  I knew that if I had a bite of the chicken that the dessert would be unattainable.  Therefore, I determined that the chicken and couscous would have to come home with me (which made an amazing breakfast).  The dessert was this interesting pastry with bananas and hazelnut inside with cinnamon on top.  It was seriously good, but the jasmine mint tea was the finishing touch to the meal.  I stole the hubby's and finished his off, too.

The belly dancers were talented.  I got a cute pic of the hubby with the dancer.

Thanks for a great night!  We would love to return with friends.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,4,3,4,LMktB7M4nebkCGDWHwm_8Q

What a great combination of tourist attraction, good food and good service.  The inside of the restaurant is really like being inside of the genie bottle on I Dream of Jeanie. 

The amount of food you get with the six course dinner is incredible.

Course #1 - Shrimp Scampi - So lemony and buttery.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Maybe my favorite course.  

Course #2 - A hummus platter of pickled carrots, olives, pita bread.  The hummus had a great flavor.  Loved it. 

Course # 3 - Some type of hot tomato soup.  This was the only course I didn't enjoy.

Course #4 - Beef skewers.  They're presented in a pineapple, more for show than anything, but this course was so good!

Course #5 - Chicken with couscous.  Enjoyed this.

Course # 6 - Dessert.  I don't know how else to describe it.  By this point I was seeing stars from all the food.  I remember it was a warm pastry with fruit and nuts and a half ton of powdered sugar.  

All for $40 a person!  Admittedly, I have little to no experience with belly dancers, but I thought both of the dancers we saw were great.  This place was entertaining and far exceeds Tournament of Kings in terms of entertainment and quality of the food.

There are much better places in town to get middle eastern food... maybe not Moroccan, per se, but do you really consider two withered beef kabobs jammed in a pineapple with a birthday candle on top Moroccan?!
I did love the ambience here. The room is cozy, red plush sheikh-chic, like the inside of a Bedouin tent. The bellydancer was really beautiful and very talented, and danced for most of the meal. The service was pretty good, and the seats are comfy. In short, everything was going along great until the food arrived!
OK, maybe I don't know enough about Moroccan food (I've only been to one other place that serves it), but I was expecting more delicate spices and exotic sweet/savory blends, grilled meats and interesting stuff like that. What we got was: white bread and shrimp scampi... minestrone soup (OK, it's supposedly ""lentil"" soup but it tasted like Chef Boyardee to me)... a few pickled beets and olives with hummus and more white bread... the aforementioned beef kabobs jammed into a decorative pineapple... some sort of salty stewed chicked and potatoes... and a GINORMOUS apple-baklava-pie thing that looked like it came from the bakery at Costco, doused in powdered sugar and dumped unceremoniously on a plate. I'm kind of a foodie, and this was not foodie-food -- this was food for people who are too busy ogling a bellydancer to care what they're stuffing into their salivating maws.
I had been wanting to come here for a long time, and  I was very disappointed.  For those seeking an Arabian Nights-vibe, I would recommend Paymon's over this any day -- although they don't have belly dancers, so if that's the main draw for you, then enjoy your white bread and Chef Boyardee... but don't eat the pineapple; they ""wash"" them and re-use 'em.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,6,3,2,Cy3UF_8yPyL_vHBB8dp7Kw

Was quite intrigued by the décor from the get-go. Felt like I was sitting inside a lavish tent awaiting a sumptuous banquet. All of the furnishing, wall panels and light fixtures were so beautiful and ornate as if I have traveled to a distant land.

Our party of two ordered the 6 course Moroccan feast which includes the Moroccan style shrimp scampi, harira soup, sampler of hummus, zaaluk(eggplant/tomato dip), olives, cucumbers and carrots, beef kabob, couscous with chicken and a beautiful dessert pastry filled with fruits and nuts.The prixe fixe meal also came with mint team and homemade bread.

Did I mention live belly dancing? The lady who performed several of the songs appeared in different costumes and boy was she talented!

We were devouring the bread and the first entree - shrimp scampi as soon as they came out. It was absolutely yummy! Actually everything was just simply delicious! 

We had to eat the first 4 dishes without any utensils which was really fun because the bread acted as a soaking and scooping element. I was quite relieved when forks appeared for the cous cous. I think that would have been challenging to use just hands and fingers.

All in all, we were so stuff by the time the cous cous was served that we almost couldn't eat the dessert. The dessert was so good that we managed to eat half of it.

I asked for some options & the waiter stared at me & said, 'What?' & 'we don't have that' - I was informed I'd be having the pre set 6 course meal (NEVER my favorite thing - I like to choose what I'll eat). But, I was in a group setting for a birthday, so I'm being  a good sport. #1 - shrimp, fine. #1 - Lentil soup - ok, I didn't like the tomato base, prefer it more traditionally Middle Eastern. #3 - Hummus, veggies, baba gammosh, hummus was great, veggies, too, disappointed in eggplant. I love baba & this was some sort of variation (pickles? salsa?) that I didn't really like. Oh, & the bread wasn't pita bread. I've never eaten in any type of Greek/Arabic/Middle Eastern style restaurant anywhere that didn't serve it. I wasn't pleased with the bland, round white bread offered. #4 - Beef kabobs, too well done for me. One of the reasons I don't like pre set menus. I would have ordered it rare. Gave mine to someone else. #5 - Chicken, cous cous, veggies, again - bland & nothing special. Tasted like anything I'd get at any American chain (Panera Bread, Chilis....) nothing remotely spicy or exotic about it. Next came a sickeningly sweet tea that nearly no one in the party touched. Oh, I'd ordered tea at the start of the meal & was never refilled or asked if I'd like another. #6 - Dessert, some sort of banana & chocolate meets filo dough with so much powdered sugar, people were sneezing as they ate. NO ONE wanted any of it to take home which is a HUGE indicator that my disappointment was not unique since I know many of fellow diners are dessert lovers. The music: Too Loud for Talking!! We had to ask them to lower it, I just accepted that I'd have to lean in & speak into people's ears all night. The belly dancers - FUN! I'd gladly have them do their shows every 45 minutes or so & take over the place. That's part of the experience. In between, the music should be back round level.

I like the scampi course and the beef kabobs best. Would absolutely be a 4 star review if we had not been served a subpar bottle of wine. We ordered a bottle of Moroccan wine for $35. Reasonable price. Well, the waiter did not pour a taste for my husband. As soon as we sipped it we knew why - it tasted bad, like grape juice. I waved a waiter down and said as much but was told that is how it was supposed to taste. Paying for gross wine that we didn't even finish left a bad taste in my mouth.

4491211,2015-01-04,4,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"I chose Marrakech for my official birthday dinner because I wanted a combination of  dining and entertainment. It's a pre fix menu which may turn off some people but I didn't mind because I saw this as a dining experience. When you walk in It's like your transported into a an exotic tent. The rich colors and music set the mood. When you are seated you are greeted with someone who will rinse your hands with aromatic rose water. The beautiful fragrance lasts long after the meal. 

The first course is the Shrimp Scampi that comes in a lemon, garlic , and white wine sauce. It is accompanied by some fresh bread that you can dip in the sauce. I don't typically like to eat up all of the Scampi sauce because I think it is a little thick but this one is perfect for dipping and not too heavy. 

 Harira Soup follows the Scampi. It is a lemon and lentil based soup that has a little kick to it. It felt great after coming in from the cold . It will warm you up! 

Just when you think you think you are getting a little full the Marrakech Sampler is brought out. It consists of Hummus (garbanzo, Tahini dip) , Taktooka (Moroccan green pepper and tomato appetizer) ,olives, cucumbers, beets and carrots. 

The fourth course is two skewers sticking out of a pineapple. My picture only had one because we were to anxious so we ate one before the picture could be taken. It was tender and juicy. When I first saw it I thought that it wasn't enough but it is. 

The main course is a Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Djaj (Chicken). The chicken falls off the bone with ease. The sauce is tasty and mixed with an assortment of vegetables that included butternut squash which I'm amazed I ate . I typically hate butternut squash but the sauce was that savory that it changed the taste of the squash into something acceptable. We were so full by this time we had most of it wrapped so we could take it to go. Plus my husband and I try to make it a rule to make room for dessert. 

B'Stilla should be known as be still my heart lol. I loved this dessert because it is different than your ordinary pie or cake. It is a pastry made from Filo dough stuffed with bananas, nuts & chocolate. Topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon . It had some nice textures going on between the flakiness of the dough, the crunch of the almonds and the creaminess of the bananas. We had some hot mint tea that went great with dessert.

While your eating all of this fabulous food you are entertained by a belly dancer . They will also let you join in on the dance. I was thinking for my 40th birthday wouldn't that be a cool profile picture for Facebook if I too was dancing? That thought didn't last too long when I was asked I chickened out because I was too shy like always. (story of my life) . I had a Moroccan like blouse on it would have been perfect but I sent my husband to go dance instead. 

The only thing I would have liked to see on the menu is Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) , stuffed tomatoes or onions. I'm not sure if that goes along the line of Moroccan Cuisine but it is one of my favorite middle eastern dishes if it is made correctly. It's fun place to celebrate a special occasion but you can't be in a hurry. It takes about 3 hours from beginning to end .",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,9,7,5,9OswyeiCNZvxCwDrtx2Ztg

I made our reservation for a Saturday at 9PM for 8 guests but needed to change it to 9 guests. I called and spoke to Tariq, Owner/GM, and advised him of our addition.  He said that he would have to push our reservation back to 9:45PM, since the table he had for us could only seat 8 people. I was a little disappointed since I didn't want my guests to wait to eat so late, but hey its Vegas right!. Tariq told me that if he could accommodate us sooner he would text me and let me know (in my head I was thinking yeah right) Well at around 9PM Tariq text me and said come on down we are ready for you. (big kudos for the great customer service)

The restaurant is rather small but so intimate and inviting. The decor was beautiful and felt as if you were actually in Morocco. They start off with the traditional handwashing. Then brought out 3 heaping platefuls of Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi which was sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic, it was so good. (two of our guests were vegetarians and so they had sauteed mushrooms which they said was very good). 
They then proceeded to serve us the soup and sampler which included 
Hummus (garbanzo/tahini dip), Taktooka (Moroccan green pepper, tomato appetizer) Moroccan olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots

The Beef Kabob was so tender and flavorful (veggie kabob for the veg)
and the main dish Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken were so delicious.  There was sooo much food and all of it was so tasty.

We began our night hoping for a reservation across the parking lot. When they were full we Yelped and found Marrakech right here so we gave it a shot. We were with a large group of 10 and were sat pretty quickly, about 15 minutes which was nice compared to the hour plus wait we left to come here. 

The music was very loud and we requested it to be at a more realistic level so we could talk during their 5-6 course meal. It would have been strange to sit there that long and not be able to talk at all. Every 45 minutes or so they had a belly dancing show with even louder music, which is fine since it's not too often and made for the experience overall.

It took a while (15 to get our initial drinks) where we ordered wines. Even longer yet to receive any food such as apatizers or bread. We acctually had to ask to receive something after another 20 minutes of receiving our drinks. 

The first place received was breads, humus, olives, etc. which was fine and the last quality food brought out. I won't go into the details of each dish to follow only to say for the expense we were not happy at all. 

The wait staff was pleasant but very slow and lacked understanding of the level of sound and need to communicate ones there.

We went on a Saturday night. We had the fixed price menu.. The shrimp was to die for. Succulent, lemony- perfect! The bread was good. The lentil soup- I have tasted better. The cous cous... not so outstanding cause it was a little mushy! Their appetizer plate was really fresh. Their hummus, baba ghanoush and beets were delish.  Service was pretty good. They took pics for us which was really nice of them.. 

The belly dancers were pretty good. I got up and danced after the first dancer pointed for me to join her on the dance floor. I can belly dance pretty well. She must have felt that I started to steal the attention from her since a few people seemed to like my dancing- so of course.. she turns her back to me and keeps dancing by a group of other customers. She needs to make her living. So it's No big deal obviously. I still danced a little more and my friend took pics. This place is overpriced- but the place makes up for it with the service and the atmosphere. Oh I forgot my credit card there and the waiter ran to give it to me. That was very kind of him.

Cons
- $40 for this food was way too expensive. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending money. But, this was unjustified given the quality
- Water to wash  your hands with was cold
- Course 1: Moroccan style shrimp scampi - this wasn't bad. But, if I wanted a dish that tasted like any other shrimp scampi, I would've gone to Olive Garden
- Course 2: Harira: tastes exactly like Indian lentil soup. The Moroccan version has less tomato and more lemon, not to mention less spice
- Course 3: Marrakech sampler - The hummous and the Zaáluk tasted like they came from grocery stores. The Olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots are clearly canned
- Dessert: tasted like banana nutella crepes. It was hard not to snort all the powdered sugar
- Couscous: wasn't bad, but didn't even have the basic moroccan flavors you'd see at decent moroccan places
- Wine: nothing much to write home about. Overpriced though.

- Kabobs were good
- Ambience and belly dancer were a saving grace",iDVtNw1D1OFzJ08jHiO3XA,1,0,1,Npf1DLfucQJTirfbNkKppA

Located in a small shopping center on Paradise Road in the same block as the Las Vegas Convention Center, this gem gets a lot of convention center patronage. It's handy for that crowd, who tend to travel in packs -- there's a two-hour group ""party package"" with open-bar for $85 per person, or a wonderful six-course prixe-fixe feast for $50 per person. Those are the popular picks, though there are also individual menu choices -- beef kabob, chicken, vegetarian options and a very popular shrimp scampi that lives up to its local reputation.

As wonderful as the food is, the ambiance and entertainment propel Marrakech into a ""dining experience."" Step through the door from a dusty Vegas shopping center and find yourself transported to Morocco. First time visitors are wow'ed by colorful, intricate wall-to-wall tile mosaics, lighted sconces, gorgeous textile hangings, and metal Moroccan wall art. You're seated on soft couches at low, intricately inlaid tables and offered a feast of food and drink. They take special care of first-timers and they warmly welcome back regulars.

The harrira soup was warming 

The hummus and eggplant dip was great

The beef kabob was cooked medium rare and had flavor, seasoned well. Just becareful removing from skewer with hand because it was very hot. 

Didn't really care for the couscous with the chicken entree (main course) but the chicken itself was tender n moist.

Dessert had a very hot filling so becareful. It's a pastry stuffed with bananas, nuts & chocolate. Topped with heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon and served with traditional mint tea.

I think we got the same chunky Cuban waiter Nikki H. mentioned below. He was incredibly unpleasant, forgot to wash our hands until it was time for dessert, and he repeatedly forgot out drinks. It was an adventure just trying to get a water.

The time before last, I was here with a large party, and the same chunky guy scolded my stepmom for saying she doesn't eat beef, after he asked if anyone has any dietary restrictions. Whatever.

The food was the same as always, with the shrimp scampi being my favorite part, but they seemed to be trying to rush us out of there while taking good care of everyone else. My husband even participated in the bellydancing and tipped the girls well, but we were still treated like dirt.

Round 2 Harira Soup: The soup had hints of tomato flavor which isn't my first choice of vegetable soups none the less it was pleasant. If your looking for a spoon there aren't any just grab your bowl!!

Round 3 Sampler: I'm new to the world of hummus and I actually enjoyed it

Round 4 Kabob: I live a PESCATARIAN friendly lifestyle and my kabobs were modified to Shrimp which were amazing!!

Round 5 Vegetarian Couscous: I was completely full by this time. I sampled this dish and it was just okay. 

Round 6 B'Stilla: Oh my I love a good pastry and this thing is gigantic and very delicious.

Seats low to the ground, tent like drapery and intricate hanging lamps create a far away vibe. 

Once seated your hands are washed over a bowl with rose scented water as you will be eating with your hands for most of the meal. Can you say ""romantic""? Tray after tray of beautifully presented items are whisked out while you lounge on the seats and enjoy the experience. Shrimp scampi, lentil soup, hummus and marinated veggies, filet skewers, couscous and chicken followed by a seriously decadent phylo dough pastry filled with apples and raisins. 

While you dine the most sexy belly dancer you have ever seen wiggles and writhes between the tables. If you are not thoroughly turned on by the atmosphere, the entertainment and the food you must be dead. 

Marrakech is best either in a large group or just for two. I can only imagine being on a date at such a place--uber romantic. And, with a large group the laughter and indulgence is sure to please. I've been with a group of about 10 and I've been with just myself and a gal pal--next will have to be a sexy man to enjoy the ambiance with.",SIF0vgC3dMHs5cA_5uxpig,4,3,5,W0oAF_w40vVIX8V3ExFQjA

As for the food:

My tastebuds were more excited during free lunch in the employee dining room today. I felt like the first four courses could be procured at my local albertsons and cooked in fifteen minutes on my stove. Dessert was some banana with sugar? on sugar? and a extra layer of sugar on top.

The final shot of tea tasted like Starbucks black tea with honey.

5049727,2011-10-21,1,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"The BF and I had a little date night planned. Dinner show with Moroccan food and gyrating booties! 

*Lentil soup & bread- the bread was good and the soup was nicely spiced. 
*Shrimp scampi- I don't see how this belongs in a Moroccan place, but as far as scampi goes it was alright. 
*Hummus & Zaaluk- hummus was alright, but the zaaluk (eggplant dip) was tasty. They gave us beets, olives, vinegared cucumbers and carrot sticks to dip.
* Beef Kebob- this was pretty decent, slightly salty. 
* Chicken (Djaj) platter- chicken was juicy and thrown on cabbage and cous cous. This was okay, it wasn't really an exciting dish to make as the main. I have had some real Moroccan tagines before and they are full of flavor and was expecting something more exotically spiced. This was more like what I would make in a tagine at home if I didn't have a lot of fragrant spices on hand (which I always do!)
* B'Stilla- from the description on the menu it sounded like a baklava with fruits in it. What we ended up getting was a puff pastry with chocolate, nuts and banana. It was not was expecting, but decent. It was very heavy with powdered sugar on it though. 
*Mint Tea- this was really nice, lightly sweetened. Wish they gave you a whole pot and not just a cup of this hot tea. 

On a plus, food came out piping hot! 

To drink throughout the meal we got Iced Mint Tea which is the same kind as what they were serving us with dessert. It's good iced as well as warm. It was $5 though! I think they do that to get you to be even with those drinking. C'mon now though, tea is cheap to make. 

Service was attentive and really good. I like how they wash your hands in rose water and my hands smelled nice throughout the night. I picture our music room looking like this place eventually. 

We came rather late so there weren't many parties there dining. The belly dancer was really cute and very good at what she does. I think since it was a small group we only got a short show (maybe 15 minutes of dancing) and sat around eating dinner with music and was hoping they come out in intervals but she was never to be seen again. Is it like that during packed times or are there dancers constantly out? If its the latter then we kinda got screwed out of a show then just because it wasn't a packed house. We're still customers. It's probably a different experience when there's a ton of groups participating. 

I had a groupon so it covered some of the cost. Still even with that I am not sure about the value of dinner and a show.  It's expensive for what you get. The dinner for two would end up to be $118 regularly (2 meals, tip for belly dancer and waiter), $58 with groupon.

I'm glad we tried it and had the groupon, but I think it was a one time experience. I just feel like for $58 I rather have gone to AYCE sushi and for $118 then I would go to the strip and get ourselves a $40 taster so we get  a gourmet meal. For a dinner show- I rather go next door to teppanyaki.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,1,3,bwnnrebTOL8IiyUrd0_FGg

Everything was really good but the pickled carrots, shrimp, baba ganoush, hummus, and the desert were real standouts.  The belly dancer really WAS a belly dancer!  She had a great energy about her and was a lot of fun.  The music was a TOTAL trip:  traditional middle eastern music sung in Arabic AND French, with reggae sung in French as well.  (O.K. The reggae in French was damned strange to listen to but it speaks to the various colonial cultural influences that shaped Morocco over the last 100+ years.)  They open up the Hookah bar at 10 PM so that is always an option after dinner as well.  When I come back in a few months with my wife this will be one of the must-go places for us.

WARNING:  The Prix Fixe menu is really meant for AT LEAST 2 people.  It was only $39.95 but would have fed 2 VERY hungry people easily!

But Yelp won't stop putting it in the corner of my home screen because I made a reservation through the link they provided. So, here we go. 

This place was a lot better than I expected. I've always heard it was a cool place with belly dancers, and of course, guys love it. I appreciate good dancers, but I always found it awkward when I'm eating my food for a girl to come up and shake her body around me. I actually got up and danced with her...the powerful influence of beer. Only one, might I add. Yes, I'm a lightweight. 

This is the course dinner they give you. 

-Lentil Soup & Bread - I normally do not like lentil soup, but theirs was made very well. 
-Shrimp Scampi - I don't know if this is really a Moroccan dish, but it was amazing.
-Hummus & Zaaluk- Both were okay, they give you pickled veggies to dip in it. 
-Beef Kabob - the meat was good, but not very tender. I wanted to eat the pineapple it  was served with more than the beef.
-Chicken Platter - It was served on top of cous cous and cabbage. The cous cous was my favorite part. The chicken was very tender and seemed stewed for quite some time. It reminded me a lot of Filipino adobo. I enjoyed this dish. 
-B'Stilla - this was a crisp pastry filled with the same ingredients as baklava. It was okay for me. I'm not very big into Baklava because I hate nuts in general.
- Mint Tea - They give you an entire pot of this hot tea. 

I think the service is good and you should usually come with a group of people. A lot of people like this place, and I can see why just for the atmosphere. It is good food, and they are quick to serve you. It is a lot of food, so go hungry. The prices are a little too much in my opinion, but this is close to the strip.

Then, that evening, I was delayed in an out of town airport.  I called three hours prior to the reservation time to explain our reason for cancellation.  I asked to make new reservations but was told to call at another time! 

I then get a note from Open Table, the site you must reserve through, that I was listed as a ""no show"" and I was at risk of not being able to use open table again!  

Needless to say, I was dismayed.  

Then, I tried again to get reservations but they were so far out, I couldn't seem to book them on line so we decided to walk in.  In fact, I tried to get 5:30 reservations for Oct 3, but the site said there were none for that day.

We walked in at 6 pm and were asked how many.  We indicated two, and my husband noted we have a groupon.  The gentleman then said, ""We don't have availability tonight.""

Now, we were there 1/2 AFTER the time we wanted, and there was only ONE table with two people seated at it utilized.  The restaurant was EMPTY.  But they had no availability for us at 5:30, and none when we walked in.

I mean the favorable food reviews that it gets here on Yelp and for the promise of hips, er, dips, skewers of meat, and bread that I'd read about here.  

First things first, we were greeted warmly upon entry and seated.  The seating structure took me by surprise a little as we were right next to another group that seemed a little too close for my usual standards of comfort.  In a restaurant the further I'm seated away from the next table generally the better I feel.  Anti social behavior FTW!  Luckily another friend took the spot closest to the next table, and I breathed a sigh of relief.  The handwashing ceremony was nice, even though my friends and I made fools of ourselves trying to figure out exactly how to participate.

We each decided to try some different specialty cocktails from the menu during the meal, and personally I found them too sweet for the most part and therefore disappointing.  At $10 a pop I expected a little more out of them, but I should have known to just stick with what I tend to like.  That's what I get for being adventurous in my libations  

We each did the 6 course prix fixe meal.  The following is the 130th recap of all 6 of those that exists here:

1)  Shrimp Scampi - I liked this a lot.  The shrimp tasted fresh and there were plenty to be shared between all of us.   Accompanying it was a huge plate of fresh bread that tasted great dipped in the Scampi sauce or with the shrimp on it

2)  Lentil soup - Decent, nothing I would order again a la carte.  It was tomato based which is not normally my preference

3)  Hummus and eggplant dip - I love hummus and this wasn't my favorite I've had by any means but I enjoyed it still.   I dont really like veggies so I'm disregarding that there were some on this plate

4)  MEAT ON A STICK.  Beef skewers sticking out of a pineapple.   I don't have to get it to know that these were delicious.   For the 4th plate in a row, bread was not spared and in fact we asked for a 2nd plate of it to be brought out during this.   Moral of story:  bread goes with damn near everything in life

5)  Chicken with couscous.   I liked this more than the rest of my party I think.  I tend to like anything that consists of a grain like substance mixed in with various meat and veggies.  I also got a giant chunk of chicken skin in with one of the bites which would have only been more delicious if it was fried.  Bread used with this?   You betcha.

Prior to the 6th plate being brought out, we got some hot tea that they pour from like 3 stories up high into a small cup.   Showoffs.   Once it cooled down, I thought it was very nice.

6)  Some chocolate/banana pastry dish.   I rarely order dessert on my own, but when it's placed in front of me I'm like a moth to a flame.   Tastes exactly as it sounds, which is a good thing.   No bread used for the first time in the night.

I shouldn't eat carbs again for a month.

When it was all said and done, I enjoyed the meal a lot.   I didn't dislike any of the six dishes and highly enjoyed 4 of the 6 plus the tea and bread.

Service was fine, though there was a weird moment in the beginning when the waiter asked if we had any allergies, and I told him I was lactose intolerant.  I'm not sure if his face expressed more confusion or annoyance but I believe he made a comment to the effect of ""We don't use lactose""   My entire party thought this was what he said, which I just found completely bizarre, and I'd bet the Scampi and dessert both had some sort of butter or milk involved in the preparation.   I brought lactaid so it wasnt a big deal, but I guess I didn't really understand the interaction.  Nothing worth docking any stars.

I'd be remiss to not mention the dancers, both of whom I thought were very entertaining and not intrusive if you didn't want them to be.  Unless you're a stick in the mud it'd be hard to not enjoy yourself here on at least that level of watching them interact with the crowd.  

Great experience overall.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,jiF-OQltzqh9bDp6tVoVwA

By the time the main course with the cous cous and game hen came out, most of our table was done eating. I tried a bit of everything and liked it all. It starts with bread and a shrimp dish, followed by lentil soup and a hummus and veggie plate, followed by kebabs skewered into a pineapple, the cous cous with game hen, then dessert followed by a mint tea or something like that. Everyone loved the dessert (apples and peaches baked in phyllo dough), and even though we all swore we were full, most of us ate the dessert anyway.

Belly dancers provided entertainment and music was piped in when the dancers weren't performing. You eat with your hands for the most part and the chairs around the tables are kinda low so it was weird because I was wearing high heels and my back kinda hurt so I had to take my shoes off.

It's a great place for large groups or an intimate table for two, as long as you're looking for a truly entertaining evening of food, drinks, music and fun.

So why only three stars? For me, there's nothing wrong with a solid three star rating. Start with one of their mojitos, but be sure to stir it and don't sip from the straw at first. I did, and got a huge sugar blast. Easily fixed, and I had two more during our six course feast.

While Marrakech makes every effort to accommodate gluten free diners, some of the dining experience is lessened by having to use a fork instead of what looked to be amazingly tasty bread. My colleagues, who are not GF, confirmed the bread was quite delicious. The couscous too. Half the fun of this style of dining is the whole communal vibe, so having separate plates and altered courses is a little isolating. 

The courses themselves are all fine, but don't fill up on the shrimp and hummus. Make sure to save room for the chicken and the dessert. Mine had to be served cold, sans pastry shell, but I thoroughly enjoyed it along with the excellent mint tea.

The only thing missing from the Marrakech experience is a hookah lounge, but our excellent belly dancer provided stellar entertainment, along with the raucous patrons on hand that evening.

However, there were a few things that were odd to me. We went on Wednesday evening and there was only one other table seated in the restaurant. I was surprised that they did not have more business than that and honestly it worried me a little. That also made it a little awkward when the belly dancer came out. Though she was wonderful and very entertaining it felt a little like she was performing just for us and that made me slightly uncomfortable. I don't know why. 

For the amount of people in there the time I felt like the service was a little slow. Perhaps they were giving us time to chat and digest between courses? 

I really liked that they washed our hands with rose water first. It smelled amazing. 

The food was very good. The flavor of their hummus is wonderful. I really liked the beef kabobs but they were very very hot so be careful! The mint tea with dessert was a perfect ending. And speaking of dessert it was amazing! It's called ""b'stilla"" and it's basically chocolate, banana, and walnut warmed up and gooey inside puff pastry and coated in powdered sugar and cinnamon.

Rather than satisfying and building a loyal customer, they would rather screw their customers out of their money.

5659351,2010-11-21,1,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"For the record, I went here last Saturday, November 13th.

So this guy James L was driving up from Phoenix (yeah) for our first date (double yeah) on Saturday. I'm not too into planning dates, because, well, that's not my job as a woman. James hadn't been to Nevada so he wasn't much good as to picking out a Vegas restaurant for us, so we compromised - he'd pick the cuisine and I'd pick the restaurant. He chose middle eastern food and so my search was on. Now Vegas isn't really known for its delicious middle eastern food so it was a bit of a search trying to find a place that wasn't just a spot serving Kronos gyros and mint tea. Some girls I met earlier that day at a meetup.com hike I was on suggested Marrakech.

Well, my date picked me up at 5 and we headed on out to Vegas (because I live in Henderson.) So I've driven past this restaurant about a zillion times but I had no idea what the name was. I thought it was in the same shopping center as Ferraro's but in actuality, it's a little further down the street. After getting turned around and driving on the highway and turning back around, we found the place.

I literally knew nothing about the restaurant other than it was Moroccan, which isn't quite middle eastern but it's really similar - or just enough so that it doesn't much matter for this reviewer. We went inside and were asked if we had a reservation - we didn't, and they sat us anyway, which wasn't a problem because the place was pretty empty. The place was cool - definitely an awesome spot for a first date. The tent like atmosphere is different, it's very dark, so you don't have to worry about looking busted (not that either of us looked busted, actually, it was the exact opposite) because candle light makes everybody 10X better looking. It also makes stealing long kisses easier because you don't feel as if you're being watched by a thousand pairs of peering eyes. 

We were seated in a corner in front of a tiny little table. Be forewarned, I'm 5'9 and James is 6'4 so the leg room is a teeny bit cramped but nothing too tough. A waiter washed our hands and gave us each a terry rag to dry off our hands and to use as a napkin. I'm a fan of rose water so that was fun for me. 

James and I were given a wine menu but we didn't order any booze and we weren't offered whatever free bottle of wine everybody else is talking about. No biggie. We were told it was a prefix menu so... yeah. That's about it. We were asked if we had food allergies, which neither of us had and they brought out the food. 

Hmmmm... I'm not sure how ""Moroccan"" shrimp scampi and bread topped with sesame seeds is, but it was good. It was nothing mind blowing, I mean, it's a dish I made every day after school when I was in the 7th grade - butter, shrimp, garlic and parsley. 

The next was the lentil soup, which was bleh. Michelle M.'s review is right on the money; (including her position on the belly dancer) the soup tasted like canned soup. *Tears*

The crudité plate was good. The picked beets were a nice touch. I wish I would have known we could have taken food to go before they whisked it away to bring out the next course. 

The next was the beef kabob and we each got a weirdly tough piece of meat per skewer. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't a big deal. 

We didn't eat any of the couscous and dark meat chicken dish - I ended up having it three days later (because we found out from a nice blonde waitress that we could get our food to go) and it was so bland. 

The dessert was decent - I liked that it had walnuts and we ended up taking 98% of it to go.

Honestly, the food left something to be desired,  but the atmosphere was good. I definitely don't think they food was worth the $100 bill he threw down before we left but nonetheless, I enjoyed myself. James could have taken me to the city dump and I would have had just as good of time with him, because, well, let's be real for a second; he was looking and smelling like heaven. I don't know if this place really deserves three whole stars, but I'll give them the extra one because I had a great time and that's really what it's all about.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,3,3,-jHJ2K8AkCVl3FdgfiNV5Q

First, the food: 6 course set meal, for $40/person-
1) shrimp scampi type dish w/ fresh bread- good, but tastes like any other scampi dish you get at an American restaurant, with just a hint of a foreign spice; the shrimp were a little dry
2) lentil soup- good but tastes like Campell's Tomato Soup with rice.
3) ""salad"" which consisted of various vegetables and hummus- hummus is awesome, seasoned vegetagles ok.
4) beef skewers- this was the best part of the meal; the steaks were juicy and the vegetables (scallion and green bell peppers) were perfectly cooked, but there were only 3 pieces, which was disappointing.
5) Chicken-I had two bites and put down my fork; the chicken was super dry and combined with the cous cous, I felt like I had cotton mouth.  Thank goodness for my delicious Lebanese beer.
6) Dessert- This was pretty good, but there was too much powdered sugar (if that's possible) and cinnamon.  I wish there was some type of custard inside, which reduced the dry texture of the dessert.

Second, entertainment: I can honestly say that even though the food was sub-par, the entertainment was definitely an experience.  I mean, 2 scantily clad women shaking their booties, how can you go wrong?  

I definitely think that this place is more of a group adventure, where everyone can have a chance to dance with the ladies and be merry, and ignore the fact that the food is not that great, and somewhat overpriced.  If you want authentic Moroccan, I don't think this place is the place to go, but for a good time with friends, totally worth it.

They could have taken it a little easier on the powdered sugar.  It was all topped off with some tea, which was super good!  I'm not big on tea usually, but I ended up drinking mine and hustled a couple of the other party-goers out of their cups!  Silverware was provided for the main course and dessert, and everything else was manageable without utensils.

They start out with bread and shrimp scampi and recommend dipping the bread in the butter.  Well, careful with that because we filled up on bread was busting full by end of dinner.  They bring one couse at a time so it's hard to gauge how much you should eat of each course.  Perhaps several courses at a time will be better.

Is dark, quiet, romantic, and the belly dancers are a fun nice touch for entertainment. The food is good, and you do leave full, the portions are pretty good. 

The only downfall is that we had a less than enthused with his job waiter :( He had dark hair and was heavy set, a real grump. If you see a shorter chubby bear approaching your table with a look on his face as if you just interrupted him during a bowel movement then you are screwed. 

The overall experience. ambiance was a fun different type of thing.
Service and food mediocre at best.

From the shrimp scampi to the kabobs and on to dessert.  Every bite was scrumptious.  The belly dancer had a great personality and she was very entertaining.  The service was very good and I likes how they gave you a few minutes in between each course to really enjoy yourself.  I will be back for more!,1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,0,0,4,-IUvswyl-KldOt2eJIHUlg

But the food was plentiful and delicious, although there were a few gaps in between courses that could have been shorter since they weren't really that busy. 
The belly dancer was entertaining and not too pushy, which I liked.  Sometimes they can be a pain in the ass trying to coax you out of your seat to dance with them.  For the fixed price of about $40 per person, you really can't go wrong here.  You will leave stuffed and feel as though you got your money's worth.  For a first time visitor to a Moroccan restaurant I would highly recommend Marrakesh; if you've been before and are looking to try a different place, I would still recommend but it won't be anything you haven't seen or tasted before.",iiQAk1fM5_WqngmNYQwrmQ,0,1,3,N6RoeRZ8FfaV_Eb2CGITPg

The food and service was impeccable and atmosphere very nice.   I have been to  a Moroccan restaurant before and I think the food was a bit more exotic or cultural.  The food was excellent but I think the dinner selections that were chosen were ""safe"" for people trying Moroccan food for the first time verses authentic.    When I've had Moroccan food previously some of our party found it quite a change for their palettes this time less so,  more mainstream or safe for those picky eaters.   That worked good for the kids.   I would've like a more cultural experience where I felt I was trying something new.  However it was great anyway.",NYYznmn26C8DZeYip2cx4A,0,0,4,4Qio8Y7Xo4HfD6dWTIzKZA
5926067,2013-07-15,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"Belly Dancing, is an art and it like any art, it should be practiced by few who have toiled and tormented to perfect the art and more importantly should have the right curves-meaning not too thin, mean or lean. You can find the above description, at the Marrakesh, which has been a fixture on Paradise rd., when other eateries have come and gone at this good central location for both tourists and local alike.

There is nothing more enticing and enjoying than watching beautiful belly dancers and eating lamb kebab under the spell of red wine. This place is not only a sight for sore eyes but a delight for you palate. The best days are Friday and Saturday nights, when the belly dancers are practicing Turkish Navel Manueavers !

As far as I know there is no other Moroccan place in Las Vegas. The  food which is a six course meal is authentic with subtle spicing and the lamb kebabs (kebab is Persian fantasy, that spread to Turkey and the Balkan countries like Greece etc) is just the most delicious perfect morsel of meat  I have ever eaten (the only other place is Mad Greek Cafe on Sahara and Durango)  You are seated in a Moroccan tent on divans, cross legged and relaxed with not a worry in the world .The wine will take you into a state of fantasy of being a Sheik with your own harem! .

5937172,2011-11-15,0,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"I brought my in-laws here for dinner. It was their very first time at a Moroccan restaurant. I could see their hesitation in coming as they are very accustomed to eating Chinese food every day. Low and behold-it was a GREAT experience. The belly dancer was beautiful and had great moves. She was the only one tonight, but captivated everyone in the room.

As for the food, I wish it was better. I honestly was a bit disappointed in the food. It's not my first time at a Moroccan restaurant and in the past have always been pleased with all the food. This time, however, was different. Although the food was good, it was nothing spectacular (it's my first time at this restaurant).

Ranking for good to bad (or not so great)-

Shrimp Scampi
Soup
Beef Kebab
B'Stilla
Hummus & Eggplant Dip
Chicken Couscous (where's the flavor? Forget to add salt?)

Not sure if I'd come back here. Perhaps that's just me comparing my previous experiences at other restaurants and this night. For those who haven't ever been to a Moroccan restaurant, it's definitely worth a go, as I believe everyone should try everything at least once. If you don't like it, then don't go back.

5962757,2013-09-04,3,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"We had an awesome time here for our anniversary.  I booked the restaurant about a month ahead of time in order to make sure we could get in.  I had heard from a couple of friends that Marrakech was not to be missed, and they were right.  Marrakech Moroccan Restaurant was everything they had mentioned plus more!

I have never been to Morocco, but I imagine that Marrakech gives a good representation of the cuisine in that country.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with tapestries, inlaid tables, low to the ground couches, and gorgeous belly dancers!!  They encourage you to eat with your fingers which is the traditional Moroccan way (although silverware is available if requested).  I have absolutely no problem with eating with my hands cause that is the traditional Filipino way also!  Before partaking of the six course meal, they wash your hands with rose water.

The six course meal is the same menu for everyone.  With the exception being a vegetarian menu for those who request it.  All of the courses tasted very good.  Starting from course #1 which was shrimp scampi all the way to course #6 which was the dessert.  The dessert is a Moroccan pastry called b'stilla.  It is a yummy concotion of chocolate, banana, & nuts all inside the pastry.  It was a perfect end to the meal.  

The entertainment was the highlight of the evening at the restaurant.  Those belly dancers are fabulous.  They came out to dance twice during our time there.  Of course, I had to entertain the patrons also.  They had me do my belly dancing with them as well.  I must say that they put me to shame, but I got a loud applause (at least I think the applause was for me).  My wife loved my dancing, and I got to burn off some calories which is always a good thing!!  

I highly recommend that you visit here if you're in Las Vegas.  The location is not far from the Strip.  The ambiance, service, and entertainment are top notch and worth 5 stars.  The six course meal is 4.5 stars and costs $40 per person.  I could not quite give them 5 stars for the food because I'm just not a real big couscous fan.  Although, my wife really enjoyed it.  Our time at Marrakech was truly a memorable and wonderful experience.  

I do have one suggestion, though.  It would be terrific if they would offer a couple of other options for their prixe-fixe menu.  I'd love to taste other Morrocan delicacies on our next visit.  With that being said, just go here and check them out for yourself!  If not for the scrumptious food, then for the beautiful belly dancers!!",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,4,3,5,BMZxX09AAFSLj7Bu8hKmxA

5986508,2016-05-04,3,-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg,"This was definitely a unique dining experience. To be tried at least once in your lifetime! 

AMBIANCE: The place is very dimmed, set for a pretty lightly lit romantic meal. Everything inside was fit for the Moroccan theme. The music was great as well. The tables were a bit small and low, while the booths were higher. When eating, you have to lean down more than I would have liked. 

SERVICE: You eat with your fingers, so they actually rinse your hands with rose water. The rose water made my hands smell so good! The belly dancer was very entertaining, she would come out once every 30 minutes or so. We came in and were seated right away. The waiter was very very nice, made our experience all the better. Make sure if you choose to eat here, that you have a several hours, because this meal takes some time. It's not meant to be a quick meal.  

FOOD: A bit disappointing. You are given a $45 pre-fix 6 course meal. We had a restaurant.com voucher that we used, which made the meal more affordable. The food was very interesting. 
1. Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi wasn't too authentic, it tasted like a normal shrimp scampi, but it was good. Even better with the bread because the scampi was a bit on the saltier side, but this might have been one of the better dishes.  
2. I really enjoyed the Harira (lentil) soup, but my bf did not. 
3. Marrakech Sample was a good refresher dish. Fresh cucumber, carrots, olives and hummus/zaaluk. The zaaluk I didn't enjoy because it was bitter. The hummus was just like any normal original hummus. 
4. Beef Brochette (kabob) was very nicely presented, on a pineapple. My bf really enjoyed the kebabs. I thought it wasn't too bad either, I would have liked it more if the meat was juicier, not so dry.   
5. When the Royal Moroccan CousCous Platter with Djaj came out, we were already feeling pretty stuffed! This was probably my least favorite dish, though I LOVE couscous... 
6. B'stilla dessert was interesting. Like a large flaky chocolate and banana pastry. We could not finish it, had to take it home, but that wasnt a good idea because it was no longer crispy. We also had enough leftovers for lunch the next day for the two of us!  
7. Mint Tea was interesting. Good combination with the very sweet dessert.",zWynzAq32vzsYXWZ3gfAyQ,7,6,4,Lzu4stwrVOR1rGtEqZ24Sg
