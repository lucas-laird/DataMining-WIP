18015,2017-10-23,0,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"Visited a few times over the course of a year and the food quality has consistently gone way down.  Before, the chicken katsu had plump, juicy pieces of white meat chicken.  I remember the first time I said out loud 'Wow! I've never seen so much white meat in katsu before.""  I loved it!  Their rice was always on the dry side but that chicken katsu made up for it.  The spicy poke was also a winner.  I went there a few days ago and you can tell they've cut corners on quality.  Chicken wasn't as moist and kind of on the dry side with hardly any white meat showing.  Poke is a big disappointment with smaller fish cubes and more filler (onions, sauce, etc.).  The only consistent thing about this place is that the rice (white or brown) is still super dry.  So annoying with the dry rice all the time.  I hope the quality comes back like it was before.  As of now, you're better off going to L&L down the street at Russell.",y65DJJeXdG8UwqdBO7imCw,0,0,1,dlIOm5f4u1KxTyZWWwP5_g

The chicken was tasty and so was the steak, but the temperature on the steak was just warm and it got cold fast. The rice was a little hard, so I didn't eat too much of it.

295039,2017-03-09,0,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"This place use to be a great place to eat.
It was a bargain too. But unfortunately, it seems like they are falling into the same thing a lot of restaurants in this town fall into. A few months back, they raised the price on all of the items while giving smaller portions. They started to change the ingredients to save money and the food quality took a hit also. Two big red flags. Everything became overly salty. Even after this I decided to give them another shot thinking that maybe I just came at a bad time. But the food portion was even smaller and didn't taste as good as it tasted the previous time. My chicken was way over cooked and the steak was tough and hard to chew. And I don't know if it's just me, but their customer service took a serious hit recently, they use to have very good customer service, being somewhat of a regular, I stopped seeing familiar friendly servers, and seen them replaced with severs who don't seem to know what they are doing. Or even care about what they are doing for that matter. That's three big red flags. It sucks because I really enjoyed the food here and the atmosphere. I'm giving two starts because I'm hoping they can change back before it's too late. I may give them another shot sometime in the future.

If you don't get the food right when it is hot off the press than you may be disappointed. They do give very generous portions of the chicken katsu which is always a positive. I don't like that their edamame is always cold. A few times that I have got their edamame it is also wayyyyyy under cooked and seemingly uneatable.

339743,2016-03-31,0,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"When this place opened I was excited as its right around the corner from my house. I have been there quite a bit since it is so close to me and was really good. 

Sadly, my visit today was horrible. I have noticed before that the employees don't wear gloves and didn't bother me until today when the girls hand touched a good amount of my food. Major health violation, considering sometimes the people who cashier also help pack the food. Perception is everything and even if she just washed her hands- I didn't see that so I am left to assume she hadn't. 

When I got home I looked at my poke as I ordered a pound. The color was off because of the oxidation but when I took one piece you could immediately tell it was not good.  To me it tasted a little old so I spit it out. I had my husband try and he said they changed the product and the quality.

I called because the other visits were so good with the exception of one visit where the rice was hard. I asked to speak with a manager or owner... I basically explained my disappointment and asked only for a refund on the poke (not my whole meal) stating that I could bring it back so they can see that we didn't eat it. He declined the refund after noting they did change products and were changing back next week but that this was still a nice product. I told him if they truly believed it was good then they wouldn't have a reason to change back to the original. I told him that was fine, if he didn't want to refund me since it's not good and the product I had several times before that he has lost a customer. As a business owner I would think you would want to keep you customers but since they are a fast food style place they can't grasp that concept. He said we can't start doing refunds on poke as if they plan to continue to serve a bad product. 
Generally, I like to give my business to small business / local owners because they are trying hard to succeed but maybe that's not the case and they feel they've already made the big time.",wDDFUioCyyVKa1J8wRDozA,3,2,1,_1anGsCE3IiWzaRwa0fqxA

I love me some Hawaiian food but it's generally a time commitment.  This place, however, is fast and straightforward.  You pick your size (ono, ono'er or ono'est, i.e. small, medium or large), proteins, base (white or brown rice) and your sides and you're done. They also have salads and a bowl (2 protein and one base).

For the proteins, I've tried the teriyaki, katsu and pulehu steak and chicken. The teriyaki is pretty basic but the pulehu was moist and tender.  I've yet to try the poke but it looks delicious.  Side note: beef items are $1.00 more and poke is $1.75 more).  As for the sides, try the kimchee slaw, it's soo good.  The mac salad is fine so, if you don't want to waste the calories on ""fine,"" try the garlic edamame or corn as well.

The first time I had the food here I nearly died and gone to heaven because of the legit Mac Salad and savory Kalua Pig.  My favorites.  The Mac isn't just macaroni swimming in mayo which I appreciate.

The overall ambiance of the restaurant is clean, staff is friendly and happy to be there.... I've been back SEVERAL times.  I enjoy their Teri Steak (+$1.00 per serving) with salad and Creamy Sesame Dressing as well - when I don't feel like eating so much rice, I'll get a Bowl which is normally 2 scoops rice and 2 choices of meats, and I'll substitute one scoop rice for a side(+$0.30), where I'll get the toss salad. (*For some reason I love the sesame dressing on my steak too lol).

For anyone commenting about the $1.00 extra for steak being unnecessary- I mean hello? It's steak. A lot of other places do an up charge for certain fish or steak..... & the $1.25 extra for Poke. It's Ahi I mean duh. Seems people are being overly critical and picky.

Kalua Pig is just pig, no cabbage, wish they would put just a little, because the texture and flavor would be great.  Some places often put to much cabbage.

We both ordered the ONO'EST (we were starving!) -- which came with 3 servings of meat, 2 sides and a base... and also chose almost the same exact options:

FOR HER: 
- white rice
- chicken katsu
- regular poke 
- teriyaki steak
- double mac salad
FOR HIM:
- brown rice
- chicken katsu
- spicy poke
- pulehu steak
- double make salad

Everything was extremely satisfactory. We both agreed the teriyaki steak was better than the pulehu (a tad bland -- he ended up dipping it into the teriyaki sauce), and that the spicy mayo based poke was better than the regular. But again, left satisfied & full, and we will definitely be returning! 

COMPLAINT: Why did a drop a star from my rating? My only qualm was it was not exactly a pleasant dining experience customer service wise. I can't help but state that every single employee seemed not only extremely unhappy, but never cracked a single smile and even answered every question with annoyance! I asked the guy what steak he preferred between the teriyaki and the pulehu, and all he did was open both lids and look at me blankly, clearly annoyed.

After calling around to several other similar food locations, I came across Makai and looked on their website (and Yelp) for catering prices. They had an Ohana size and Regular size. To be sure, I called and spoke to Tony, the assistant manager, who kindly explained the sizes to me. 

I chose the regular size for an order of chicken katsu and the total came to under $55 including tax, which was a LOT better than other food chains. I paid over the phone, which was no problem and set a time for pickup. Tony also informed me if there were any other questions/concerns and that when the order was ready he would give me a ring.

The day of, Tony called me confirming that the order was for that day and told me it would be an extra 5 minutes so they could prepare my order, which was no big deal to me! I'd rather wait a little longer for fresh, hot food :-) Since the order was paid, I just had to sign my receipt and wait for the food. 

Once it was ready, an employee brought out my order with two small tubs of their katsu sauce and we were good to go! 

Thank you Makai for the awesome and efficient service! Will definitely recommend to those looking to feed a crowd within a decent budget.

Came here on 02/15/16 (President's Day) and they were open. Lay out kind of reminds me of chipotle, with an area on the side sectioned off for the line, with seating in the middle. 

Menu is as follows

Choose your Size - Ono (Small - $4.99 - Base, 1 meat, 1 side), Ono'er (Medium - $6.99 - Base, 2 meats, 2 side), Ono'est (Large - $8.49 - Base, 3 meats, 2 sides), Bowl ($5.99 - Base, 2 meats), Salad ($7.99 - Romaine lettuce with cucumber, radish, wonton and glazed almonds, 2 meats, and choice of sweet onion, creamy sesame or ginger vinaigrette dressing)

Base - White Rice or Brown Rice (Add $0.50)

Meat - Chicken (Teriyaki, Pulehu, Katsu, Mochiko Wings), Pork (Kalua Pig), Steak - ADD $1.00 per serving (Teriyaki, Pulehu), Ahi Tuna - ADD $1.25 per serving (2 styles, one traditional hawaiian with limu, other with a spicy mayo sauce) 

NOTE: Below notes a style called ""Pulehu"" which means ""broil over a fire"" but it is a style of cooking with seasoning mix (salt, garlic, sugar, black pepper) and maybe other variations

Sides - Garlic Edamame, Grilled Veggies, Sweet Corn, Macaroni Salad, Kimchee Slaw

Since this was the first meal of the day, lets say breakfast at a lunch time, i opt'ed for the ONO'EST (large) for the most food to last me thru the day and to try more stuff. White rice, Kalua Pig, Pulehu steak (didnt realize it was additional charge until i was paying.. oops) and traditional poke (i like limu...), sweet corn and macaroni salad

My friend ordered first and he had ordered the pulehu steak as well.. and ran out. I had to wait for them to cook some new ones (steak cooks fast and easy anyway... came out med rare too ! perfect XD ! my friend was jealous...) oops :3 

Rice was a little on the drier side. Pre-made earlier on the day. 

Pulehu steak was seasoned well. Cooked well. Medium Rare. No sauces needed. 

Kalua Pig was flavored nice. A bit dry. But then again, the only thing i can compare it to was the actual kalua pig in hawaii during a luau from the pig... But id expect moister meat and not so shredded? 

Traditional Poke was.... traditional poke, with soy sauce, sesame sauce, green onions, onions?, and limu. A little ""Stronger"" in saltiness than i'd prefer but fresh and tasted nice overall

Sweet corn is ... sweet corn Lol XD 

Macaroni salad was like a normal mac salad but with cubes of potato too. 

Overall not bad. Prefer over like aloha kitchen strictly cuz i dont have to get teriyaki everything and get diabetes later... I like the option about NOT getting teriyaki and the pulehu seasoning is pretty decent, especially on the freshly cooked MEDIUM RARE steak.. Lol. 

Price at the end was like 11.50, which is a little pricey... wouldnt be so bad with additional $1 for steak and $1.25 for ahi poke... additional cost for steak i think is a little unnecessary. Ahi poke, may be a little more justified but the serving size is to a small sample cup =/ 

Good and convenient place in the area since the closest hawaiian place iirc is durango and warm springs (Ohana) or rainbow/hacienda (Boba Hut)...",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,3,gHzq-PaXnxiePKPTvBHSvw

Think of Makai as a ""Hawaiian Food"" Chipotle. You choose SM, MD or LG. White or brown rice. Meats, sides & you're done!

I've had it tender and cut medium sized and I've also had it tough and cut so small it's almost considered ""chopped"" steak. Chicken katsu is always fried perfectly. I also love their sesame dressing on the tossed salad. Definitely try the spicy teriyaki sauce and let your meal swim in it; it is that good.

Watch out if you're here for dinner. Once they're out of poke, they're out, that's it! So come here earlier to make sure you get it.",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,3,4,4,cARR7GWFBR29EA-Ocs-vjA

Days and months would pass when me and my buddy who had partaken in the previous experience would speak of how we needed to return.

That day would be today (01/25/17), when we would take the mild journey across part of the valley to visit again.

Rolling in well after the lunch hour rush, I took a look at the menu over hanging the many trays of goodness.  This time around, I was processed carb and relatively sugar free.  No rice (PISS) and no mac (DOUBLE PISS) this time around.  Is there sugar in teriyaki?  I was gonna be in denial about that one.  So I ordered up the mighty ""Ono'est.""  This heart warmer consists of 3 meats and 2 sides.  I went with teriyaki steak, teriyaki chicken, some spicy poke, no rice and a double order of kimchee slaw.  The nice lady compensated me for the lack of rice with extra salad.  Mahalo ma'am, Mahalo!  

Given that this is an order...and placed in a wonderful circular, tin tray as you order, my meal was ready to go at cash out.  Me with the meats and four pounds of kimchee slaw.

Everything was divine sans the cold teriyaki chicken.  I was not gonna make a stink, and so I shredded and added it to the good fun kimchee slaw.  I truly missed rice and mac...I really did.

Menu has several add-on fees for options like brown rice (50 cents extra), choice of steak ($1/serving extra), and poke (two options, $1.25/serving extra), but base prices are pretty reasonable. 

PROS: Pulehu steak has good flavor, Kahlua pig is tender, both poke options were fresh. They have several sauces by the drink station, no extra charge if you want to get more than one salad dressing. The kimchee slaw and garlic edamame sides were better than expected.

CONS: Brown rice was crunchy, steak is fatty and doesn't need an extra charge, poke portions are tiny so buy by the pound instead, salad is served pre-tossed with tongs so majority of toppings fall to bottom and you receive mostly lettuce... Management should look into adding toppings by hand for those who order salad as an entree.

Some items need a little improvement but I liked what I got and would come again. BF isn't much of a Hawaiian food fan and he cleared his plate. Total for two orders (large plate, poke salad) was about $25 without drinks.

Yes you can get double of anything even on the main choices like if want double chicken katsu. 

 On a side note if you get the Mochiko chicken you only get 3 pieces? This is the reason for only four stars not five! So I would get double Mochiko chicken.

I highly suggest waiting for meat to come off the grill or looking to see if the containers are full with meat. I sampled chicken pelehu which looked amazing in Yelp pics but it was SO dry. :( teriyaki chicken was fresh off the grill and what a difference! It was moist and delicious. 

Unfortunately the amount of meat given was very small portion. I wanted more meat it was so good. I liked how it's not smothered in teriyaki sauce but if you compare the portion to what you get at Island Flavor and the price you get 1/3 -1/4 the amount of meat. 

I also tried a steak which was dry and another which wasn't. The one that wasn't was really good and not overlooked.

Loved the almonds on the salad yummm but would have been nice if the worker knew the answer to my question about the dressing being homemade. She did not know which she should. 

On to the poke...lovvvvvvedddd it! Both flavors were good. The portion is tiny and there is an up charge. The person assembling your food determines how much you get. Mine was above the top of the small cup and my husbands was below the top of the cup line. I don't like that inconsistency. We saw someone near us whose cup was overflowing with poke. Would be great if it's the same amount each time. For the price the portion is comparable I think and it is probably a normal portion size, just now what you expect when you think Hawaiian. 

My husband's mochiko chicken has a great flavor. 

We were not given napkins and I don't think others were either. I saw people having to go up and ask for napkins. No napkins on tables and no napkins near the soda machine. Put out some napkins, people need it. I kid you not I saw a man blow his nose in his shirt. It was gross. It's an easy fix so I hope management can do that.

Makai seems to be either a hit or miss when I go here. The first time I tried Makai, the food was just alright. I was a bit disappointed in their chicken katsu as it seemed to be a bit overcooked. However the poke was phenomenal! Which is partly why I came back. The other factor was that the staff was so nice. 

This time on the other hand was weird though because it was as if things had switched! Tonight I tried their mochiko wings, Hawaiian poke and chicken katsu. Great taste, nothing overcooked - I was so happy I stopped by here for dinner. I guess this makes up for their customer service. 

*****WHAT I REALLY LEFT THIS REVIEW FOR*****
I usually don't have a problem with ""poor"" customer service as I've worked in the food industry before. I get it. It can be pretty annoying working around food all day. HOWEVER, I have no idea what triggered this girl to make me feel like I shouldn't be here. I ordered and when she added rice to my plate, she stared me down in silence. Like... Alright. Did I do or say something? If this was my first time, I would have been completely confused as to what I needed to tell her next.

I was completely taken off guard but I just proceeded telling her the meats I wanted. Apparently she didn't hear the last thing I ordered in which she, once again, stared me down in silence.

Whoever the chick with the nose stud is - It's really, really weird and uncomfortable to stare down customers until they speak.

Everything on the menu is super delicious, haven't been disappointed once. Added bonus: my kids love it too!! 

Prices are more than fair. And you get so much food so it's a good idea to share. Sharing is caring, right? ; ) I recommend the ""Ono'est"" 3 servings of meat, 2 sides, and a base.

I thoroughly enjoyed the teriyaki chicken. It was delightful, flavorful and grilled well. The pulehu steak, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre. It did not live up to its hype like the teriyaki chicken. I thought it tasted pretty bland. The chicken katsu was pretty standard as well. The rice was weird. Not sure how to explain it so that's all I'm going to say. The mac salad wasn't very cold like I'm used to with Hawaiian food (probably because they have it out on the counter, so no biggie). I loved ""Da Spicy Yaki"". It was a mysterious, delicious sauce that I made sure to bring to my table. The food overall is very filling.

To also add their price point is ON POINT. 
You get the best bang for your buck and they give you SOO MUCH food. They have a whole sauce station to get all your desired sauces. They have some Hawaiian juices if you wanted some lilikoi drink or whatnot.
The atmosphere is super nice in there too, if you don't want to sit inside there's outdoor seats too! 
My favorite plate to order here HAS to be the kalua pork, so Ono, literally the BEST kalua and they offer you brown or white rice.
They also offer you salads if you're more of the vegetarian side. What's even more awesome is they offer kimchi slaw as a side too!!! Like whaaaaaaattttt  
You can also order the poke on the side, half lb or full lb to take home.

Prices are fair and I believe they match the quality & portion of food you receive. Order a size up for more variety and extra food for later. I highly recommend the canned hawaiian sun drinks as they pair perfectly with savory meals.

The second to last time I came it was around 8pm and they were completely out of poke and mochiko chicken.

That's like telling someone they can't get more than one container of teriyaki sauce. But we couldn't get teriyaki sauce anyways because literally every single bottle was empty and no one was refilling them. Not only that but every table was dirty and we had to clean them ourselves.

Always get the same thing.   

Kalua pig- so damn tender and extra good with the teriyaki sauce on it.   

Katsu chicken- basically breaded chicken.  But it's always crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  And they have a special sauce that takes it up a few notches.   It heats up crazy good too in the toaster oven if you can finish it.   

Mac Salad- I'm not Mac Salad connoisseur but this stuff is ridiculous tasty.   

White rice- its white rice.  Standard, nothing you are gonna call you mom and tell her about.   But it works with everything.  


But in the end it costs like $8.25.   Fills my big appetite.   Leaves me happy and satisfied (that's what she said).  And it's like 5 minutes from my house.  Staff is nice.

One of the latest additions is Makai Pacific Island Grill. Any business that makes the Hot New Business list on yelp and close to my house so in!!! 

My first stop really wanted to try some of the spicy poke. I went when they first open so told me 10-15miin wait. Ok. I figure get some on my second visit. I went with the Pulehu Steak and Kalua Pig choice of meat. Two sides went mac salad and Kimchee slaw. The kimchee slaw was awesome. I love all things Kimchee. I never had Kimchee slaw. It had nice kick nothing over the top heat but added so much more flavor then regular coleslaw. Mac Salad was solid. The meats the Kalua Pig and the Steak Pulehu both was solid. The Kalua Pig surprise not offer it with cabbage. Still the meat was nice moist and had nice flavor to it. The Steak Pulehu was cooked perfect medium rare. Second visit got me some Spicy Poke. Poke hands down was the WINNAH. Also have Hawaiian style poke but would highly recommend the Spicy Poke more. If you want they offer sample of the Poke can have one bite. Second go around my meats went with teri chicken and spicy poke. The teri chicken was cooked perfect! It had nice char on the outside, hot and moist inside, and not overpowering sauce at all. The spicy Poke was amazing. I read other reviews that hit or miss. They do make it fresh everyday so consistency might be problem. On this day got nothing but amazing amazing and right there was the best straight poke (all they sell POKE like Poke express) spots in town. It was that good decided take half pound action later for dinner. Yay!!! 

The concept at Makai Pacific Island Grill is one that think is really cool. Simple, straight forward, very very reasonable, get choke food, and legit local grinds. They offer three different size bowls. The medium size (Ono'er) get two meats and two sides. Just right.  If not fan of white rice they offer brown rice as other base option. They have few options comes to meats and sides. It like ordering half an half at other local restaurants. The POKE that really stands out. Not often see menu that has Poke as meat option. POKE be honest not the cheapest thing on the menu always at market price. No different here and the price per lb changes daily basis. Steal of deal plate lunch with all the sides and Poke. They have four different bottle sauces on the side condiments can add.

The interior is nothing that blow you away. Really simple. The music not sure if local station back home. All hawaiian music that grew up with come the C&K, Hawaiian Style Music, Braddah Iz, and just good island roots. 

No doubt Makai is my new quick go to spot comes for local grinds.. POKE the star of the show!!!!!!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,10,7,4,GAglyIJ_-DQlR2IWjyV99A

We didn't know what pulehu steak was so we asked for a sample and found it to be quite tasty and very tender.   We should have suspected something was going to be off when the server had to scrape the last of the steak into our tin.  What we ended up with was the overcooked, medium well pieces at the bottom that were tough.  When we brought it to the cashier's attention, he didn't care.  ""I'll let the chef know."" was his response.

BBQ beef had very large pieces and was over cooked and zero taste, but sure had some jaw breaking moments trying to eat this thing.  If it had been thin sliced and marinated for several days might have been tastier.  Mochi chicken was alright but just 4 very tiny pieces, come-on.  Cold slaw kim chee was pretty good and the mac salad was a bit on the warm side, (maybe it was just made or sitting to long).  Hawaiian Sun drinks were warm and not in a working display cooler, bad.

Always looking for good quick lunch spots. When we arrived on a Saturday afternoon it wasn't crazy busy at all maybe one family sitting down when we entered. 

So the place is very clean and with a good amount of tables for people to sit in. It's a pick and choose type of restaurant which I haven't seen before in a Hawaiian restaurant. They have different combos to choose from. I got the medium which was two meats and one base (rice), also including two sides. They have two versions of the steak which was typical teriyaki and the pulehu steak. I was curious what the pulehu was, the lady said it was garlic, salt, and pepper. So I got both steak options with garlic edamame and kimchee slaw. My BF got the kalua pork and pulehu steak. 

So the garlic edamame was the highlight of my meal. It had so much flavor and the only thing was I wished it was hot but it's not a big deal. The slaw was ok I probably wouldn't get it again. So for the steaks there were both a little dry for me and lacking flavor. And the rice they serve us, was hard and had a lot of crunchy pieces. I dipped the steaks in their steak sauce which just had A1 flavor and their spicy teriyaki which was good and needed it for sure. My BF said the kalua was good but hard to eat the meal because the rice was so hard. He said he absolutely loved the corn. 

I will say the price is cheap and you get a lot of food. 

I really want to give this place more stars but it just seemed like the items could have been better it was 12:00 when we  came in which I thought was prime time lunch hour.",Uav1HjC3_sZBt3-vN3s6ZA,1,0,3,fsdzCFXOO6FZz2yYiEAV9w

They serve it on a bed of rice with your pick of sides. I always like getting the garlic edamame for one of them. It's the perfect kind of salty to pair with rice. I tried their wings once which were all right. I personally prefer the chicken katsu waaaay more. I promise you can't go wrong with it.

I came here for the first time with my family last weekend because we were all craving a little taste of home. I've heard nothing but good things about Makai Pacific Island Grill, so I suggested it and that's how we ended up here.

I really liked the concept of Makai. It's almost like Chipotle in a sense because you get to choose and build your plate as you walk down the line, but with Hawaiian flavors instead. You choose what size plate you want, and from there you pick your base, meats, and sides. The Ono'er (Medium) was definitely enough for me. I went with the brown rice, Kalua pig, spicy ahi poke, mac salad, and sweet corn. Keep in mind that the premium meats are extra, which isn't a big deal at all. The teriyaki steak and Pulehu steak are both $1 extra and the Hawaiian poke and spicy ahi poke are both $1.25 extra. My sister also went with the Ono'er option and chose the teriyaki chicken. While ordering, she noticed that the teriyaki chicken was almost out and decided to wait for the fresh batch that would be coming off of the grill in a few minutes. Meanwhile, we paid and took the rest of our order to the table that we were lucky enough to snag!

My food was just okay. For starters, the Kalua pig here just wasn't appealing to me, which is really unfortunate because Kalua pig is one of my favorite local dishes. It didn't look appetizing on my plate, but I tried it anyway. The flavor was there, but the meat was way too fatty for my liking. I ate a few bites of it after picking around the fat and then just pushed the rest to the side. The spicy ahi is a different story. It was fresh and soft. It didn't have that fishy taste to it, which I liked. It was cut into perfect bite-sized cubes and it didn't take much effort to chew... You know the poke is good when it just melts in your mouth! The poke did not let me down at all. My sides were nothing spectacular. The mac salad has potatoes in it, which is different, and the sweet corn reminded me of the stuff they take out of the can and serve to you in the cafeteria at school.

Anyways, the other reason I had to give this place three stars is because the teriyaki chicken that my sister patiently waited for was undercooked. She took a bite into one of the pieces and it was rubbery and still a little pink. We brought it to management's attention and they were very apologetic and replaced it without a problem. 

Overall, our first experience here wasn't the best and I'm not sure that we'll be driving 35 minutes across town any time soon to give it another go. Hopefully our next visit in the future will be a better one.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,9,8,3,T6qItuSKxxTc_KNd8W9iNA
2626889,2016-05-11,2,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"Here's what I liked: poke as a protein option. And, it was really good poke. The portion size overall was generous and I found myself with a bit of the itis after.

The wait at lunch was pretty long on my visit. Something was up at the register, thats cool no worries it happens. But after being in line for over five minutes (an eternity in fast casual chipotle style assembly lines) the girl behind the counter is dancing around and socializing. *blank stare* 

Anyway, theres a few items on the menu that have been removed like the chicken *pulehu? so beware. Also, the seared ahi is made to order so don't expect to get it right away.

We walked in, everyone was welcoming and hungry. They were 12 people deep waiting in line. We walked right to the register and ready to pay. Food was almost ready (called 6 minutes prior) so they're super speedy!

We ordered a large bowl consisting of mochiko wings, poke, teriyaki chicken, white rice. All their sauces on the side and a glass of water.

Once you enter you get into the queue/line to the left and there's a huge menu that describes the size of the plates and what it comes with. Since it was my first time here with my kuya last week, we ended up asking a bunch of questions and were given some really friendly service and great advice on what to order. The lady that helped us as well as the lady that cashed us out (I'm sorry, I wish I knew their names!) was soo sweet and helped us order within minutes. 

TIP: We wanted to try almost everythingggg, and ended up making the most of our money by adding a quarter pound of poke each because it's just a bit larger than what they would give you if it was a ""meat side""! 

DELICIOUS food, great and friendly service, and the portions are pretty generous for the amount that you pay. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm on this side of town!

Got mac salad and garlic edamame for my sides. The garlic edamame is served cold but I think it would be way better served hot. Served cold it just doesn't work for me.

After a gym session (with a trainer who is Hawaiian), my husband and I were doing Yelp searches since we aren't sure of what to eat for dinner and up pops amazing reviews and photos of this place. I struggled with going to a healthier place but said, ""screw it, I want good food right now"", and we made our way over here. Ordering is Chipotle-esque, which reminded me of Braddah's, but I do think the food here is better than Braddah's because I immediately wanted to go back (went back after 2 days). In comparison, I haven't wanted to go back to Braddah's since I first went even though it's a close option for me. 

So what to get? Depends on what you like. Both brown rice and white rice are available (brown rice is 50 cents extra). I really like their flavorful and tender kalua pork and pulehu chicken. Mac salad has macaroni and bits of potato and is perfectly creamy. My husband is a big fan of the mochiko chicken wings; I haven't even gotten a bite in of them yet because he gobbles them up. I tried their toss salad as a side - they include candied almonds and I got the creamy sesame dressing. It's very simple but packs a lot of flavor that pairs well with the rest of your food. Portions are very generous and prices are amazing. To get so much food for under $20 bucks for two people is ridiculous. I even saw some big guys unable to finish up their plates. They have a variety of sauces on the side, but be warned, the to go cups to place the sauces in are a bit flimsy (a few bursted on me on my short drive home), so if you're taking to go, I think it's best to just put the sauce on your food directly before you head out or place them inside your plate within the cup.

Walking in we were greeted by a staff member and I noticed that the place was pretty empty considering it was dinner time. The workers here do not have much energy or very welcoming and I did not see a single smile. One of the workers proceeded to tell us that they were out of katsu, kalua pig, and poke. I was extremely disappointed because those were the three top choices of meat I wanted to try. In the end I got a medium size bowl with chicken wings, puleho steak, brown rice, kimchi Cole slaw and salad. 

To start off, the puleho steak was probably the best thing out of my bowl, especially when you eat it with their spicy sauce. The chicken wings were disgusting because 2 out of 3 of my wings had the feathers on it still! I immediately threw it away and just proceeded with my food. My salad came with a choice of either sweet onion or sesame dressing so I sided with sweet onion. The sweet onion sauce had a peculiar color because it looked like pepto bismol medicine. I decided to dip my fork in it to try it and it was WAAAAY too sweet. The whole time I watched the worker put my food into the bowl I felt like I was getting all the leftovers even though they still had two hours till closing.

Overall this place is okay. Their prices are pretty decent and you shouldn't expect much service because it's basically like a fast food place. I'm not sure if I would come back because I've read previous reviews that they always run out of poke and kalua pig by a certain time and those are the two items I want to try most, not to mention their chicken wings had feathers on it still.

I always get the medium sized plate and for the price ($7), it's hard to beat. Sometimes I feel like the meats get a little on the fatty side, but that's nothing new for Hawaiian joints. A good friend of mine consistently gets the Chicken Katsu which he loves because of how moist it is. 
The thing that I love about Makai the most is the POKE! It's amazingly delicious. Fresh, clean, and delicious. I've even introduced it to my mother who NEVER eats raw fish and she enjoyed it. I've read some reviews about how some people felt it wasn't okay for them to run out, and I actually 100% disagree. If Makai only makes a certain amount of tuna every day to consistently keep things as fresh as they have it right now, I'm okay with it. I always call ahead of time and confirm availability or hold a pound or so to ensure I'm not disappointed. Because a trip to Makai and walking out without tuna would certainly be a disappointment!

I was surprised that when I got home (less than 10 minutes) the chicken wasn't even luke  warm, maybe even one piece cold.  It was a bit disappointing and misleading.

The space is small with very few tables. 

Tonight, my family and I walked in and waited in line to order our food. A family of I would say 15-20 people walked in and just sat down while some of them walked to the back of the line. The 15-20 people already in line had nowhere to sit while the family of 20 sat without ordering. One of the kids they were with took some of the sriracha sauce and teriyaki sauce bottles (the ones next to the soda machine) to the table and began to put some sauce on his finger, licking his finger and then putting more sauce on his finger after.

There was a sign that said they were known for their mac salad so naturally I had to give that a taste. I also tried a sample of their katsu sauce which surprisingly was very good. The flavor in that sauce is on point.

My friend had the chicken katsu with the kalua pig, white rice and a double serving of the mac salad.

The mac salad is one of the best. They use little chopped potatoes which actually makes a huge difference that turns the texture around.

The fish surprisingly tastes very fresh so if you're looking for a spot for poke then come here. They will even let you take a sample before you decide to buy. I asked where he got his fish from and he was able to answer my questions before I even got to ask any of my other questions about the fish so they do know what's important information to us and I appreciate that.

Excited that we had another hawaiian restaurant in Vegas, we finally decided to make the drive from da east side to Makai which is way out there. Happy for those who live on that side with the convenience of a local style restaurant in their neighborhood. All excited for some pulehu chicken which was on the pictures I looked at in yelp. We get there and the girl who by da way didn't greet us, just looked at us like ok what do you want. Being that is was our first time there didn't know anything about da menu or the different size of plates they had. So, we start to order. I proceeded to order da pulehu chicken and pulehu steak combo, well to my disapointment, even tho da pulehu chicken is still on the menu, they discontinued making pulehu chicken. Being a guy who likes to eat, I decided to go with da large plate with 3 choices of meat. Went with da pulehu steak, kalua pig, and teriyaki chicken. This is where I start getting disappointed. Da steak was already cut up, sitting in a container which I can only assume is hot. I could already see da fat on da steak turning white like it is getting cold. I'm thinking maybe they going to micro it but duh it's in a aluminum container. Da portions were not quite what I'm used to being that I just came back from Hawaii. Large plate I guess meant larger portions of rice. Da teriyaki chicken was burnt and also already sitting in a container. Kalua pig was sitting in its juices, thinking ok that looks good. At this point da only friendliness I got was from da cashier, who flipped the screen and told me to pick a % on how much to tip. I still gave da max 15%, ""support da locals"". 
Sat down to eat, and wow da kalua pig was super salty, da teriyaki chicken was burnt, and as I thought da pulehu steak was cold. My daughter loves shoyu, so I put some on her rice. Aloha shoyu is da bottle but it was watered down. She had da chicken katsu and da sauce tasted like ketchup and worterchier mixed. No real katsu sauce. I am by no means a food critic and not here to put people on blast, but this was not a good dining experience. 
Da staff should have more ALOHA, it wasn't busy at all to be rushing us on our order. Not to mention, not even assisting us first timers with da menu. Maybe that should be da first questioned asked. ""Aloha is this your first time here?"" It was to obvious that da reason da cashier was a little friendly, was because of da tipping aspect of our encounter.
If you don't sell items on da menu anymore, please take it off da menu and somehow inform your customers on da website or yelp.
Poke was horrible, they only had one kind which was spicy tuna. Not spicy at all.
Da lack of communication from da time you walk into da place needs to improve to include taking items off da menu.
Da food is like ""LUNCH WAGON"" food. It's like someone went to a construction site in Hawaii and brought da lunch wagon back to vegas and stuffed it in a restaurant. Da food would be perfect for sweaty construction workers and people at da beach. Not really good for a restaurant type atmosphere. 
If da owners did a few tweeks to improve da quality of how da food is stored before serving, how its cooked (over cooked and over seasoned) and teaching da staff to spread ""ALOHA"" to all da customers who come in. This place would be a perfect addition to da hawaiian community who live in vegas. 
Sorry it was a long review guys, but I think this place could potentially be a great place to eat at. Mahalo for reading.",ibqLewQg99S_X5P9GwPwKA,6,2,2,DwS5bmXYFEFGL5BAEZKWAw

Let's start with the chicken katsu. Might be the best I've had. They are making full pieces of chicken breasts and slicing it to order. The breading was crispy and the chicken was moist and delicious (oh yeah, I said moist *wink wink*). Kailua pig was also tender and very tasty. What can be said about macaroni salad and corn?

The highlight for me was their poké, which was a little unexpected considering it's not what they specialize in. The mayo was light so I could really taste the freshness of the tuna. The Pulehu steak was a little dry and chewy (tasted like jerky), but maybe I got a bad batch? I also heard that their chicken katsu was dank so I'm gonna have to try that next time!

I got the large portion with 3 protein options and 2 sides. Here's the catch, the protein option is not a set base price for all protein which makes it a bit misleading. If you decide to get the steak it's extra, if you get the poke it's extra. I have no problem with paying more for better quality meat but it should be made more clear. As for the meat itself, they sit in warmers which did not do a great job keeping the meat warm. The steak was tender but the poke was very salty. Now on to the sides, I chose to go with the mac salad which was good and the garlic edamame was as well. Makai is a nice option if you're on this side of town and seeking a clean Hawaiian food option.

I ordered the small which is the perfect amount of food for one person. You get a protein, rice, and a side. I don't think anyone actually ""needs"" more than that lol. I noticed it can get pricey if you choose the more expensive proteins or want brown rice. (I hate it when the more healthy option costs more -_-). It's $1.25 extra for ahi tuna, plus .50 cents for brown rice. Not too bad but I'm always looking for good food AND a good deal. The chicken katsu was cooked perfectly, not too dry but still had that great crunch to it. The mac was a little too creamy for me, but I can see why everyone loves it.

The room got dark and the trees started to die around me. I then proceeded to order the teriyaki chicken and the Kalua pig with macaroni salad and sweet corn. The teriyaki chicken was okay. Nothing special from the other places with teriyaki chicken. The chicken was a bit dry, but still edible in its form. The Kalua pig, was too salty for me. I don't eat pork, but I took a few bites and thought it was too salty. I gave the remainder to my BF, which he gladly ate. Overall, nothing wowed me, but it's a great place for cheap and fast food.

3768193,2017-07-09,1,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"TLDR: Chipotle-style ordering; Americanized flavors; quick service; minimal options 

After passing by this location on several Sundays, I decided to make a special trip with my friend when they were actually open. To my surprise, it wasn't a full service restaurant, but that's ok because it just meant we were going to get our food faster. 

You place the order at the front service counter depending on the number of meats and sides to order. The availability of proteins were limited. I opted for the tuna poké, Mac salad, and white rice. They offered a regular Hawaiian-style and a spicy version. When I asked the serve the difference, he rudely stated ""Well the spicy has mayo and sriracha. Does that help?"" No it doesn't snatch because I've never been here before and I want to know the other sauces. If you're tired of explaining the differences, then make a sign. Either way, I opted for the spicy version. The other server weighs the exact amount of poké for the $1.25 upcharge. 

I left hungry and unsatisfied. The poké was of poor quality. The mac salad containing potato bits was flavorless and left much to be desired. I question the amount of fellow Islanders in line as the food and service wasn't even worth the trip. Their teri sauce was super oily and the total food portions were very small. Definitely an Americanized version overall or maybe just a bad batch of foods. The 4.5 star rating is very confusing and I wonder if the reviewers have ever had true Hawaiian food. 

Needless to say, I won't be coming back to visit anytime soon. A serious change would have to occur in order to earn my business. (Not even a yelp check-in offer would entice me to visit in the near future.)",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,0,0,2,C0WdLLd-2QYWQCvZha-Hog

I typically get a Medium (rice, 2 meat, 2 sides) with white rice, katsu, mochiko wings, and double garlic edamame. It's a lot of food and I can rarely finish the whole thing in one sitting unless I'm really hungry. If you order katsu, they cut it right in front of you before they add it to your plate. Don't forget to grab some Katsu sauce before you eat! I personally don't eat Poke, but when I eat at Makai with friends, they rave about how good the Hawaiian style Poke is. They order it every time we come, so it must be pretty darn good. 

Their system is similar to Chipotle/Subway where you go down a line, tell someone what to put in your order and so on until you reach the register to pay. Sometimes the line gets pretty slow and it seems like they run out of stuff often, then you have to wait a bit for a new batch. Maybe I'm a little unlucky, but they never seem to have mochiko wings when I come in, so I end up having to get double katsu more often than not. I'd recommend coming well before closing time to ensure that they'll have the meats you want. I typically take my order to go, but there's plenty of tables if you choose to eat in.

Lately, however, I've been coming here and they don't have any poke left. They say they make a batch of it every day and whenever it sells out, it sells out. I typically come here at around 6:30 or 7. The place closes at 9. Not everyone has the luxury of coming to a restaurant early enough to order one of their 6 or 7 menu items before it sells out for the day. Additionally, I frequent all the time and this used to never be a problem, so it seems like lately they are making less poke every day to maybe save money.

Their food is delicious. And I still recommend eating here. But they would receive a much higher rating from me if they didn't ""run out"" of one of their main menu items 2 or more hours before closing.

Also, to piggyback off of other people's reviews, they definitely take their time to weigh out portions of meat when the difference in weight and cost to them is very miniscule. It is kind of frustrating to watch.",DFKHKDlXP6330xSyAXoD1w,0,0,3,ny2DWJqxMXdBX6lOHjZ7rA

Being a native Maui (Built) Boy, naturally I wanted to support our local small businesses.  Especially when it comes to local Hawaiian food!  Run by actual Hawaiian locals!  None of this, I'm L&L Hawaiian BBQ or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ...but owned and run by all Chinese folks!  Ah, da pilao!  Pilao!  No offense to you franchisees, but who behind the line am I gonna run Pidgin English by?  I want the food...but I also want the friendly banter!

Luckily, Makai Pacific Island Grill owned and run by genuine kine locals!  Da kine dat understand da Pidgin!  Good for me, not so good for mainlander folks like the wifey.  Oh well, it's okay bebe, let me do the talking!

This place is pretty far for us to drive to but on a Friday night we decided to make the little trek on down to the SW side of Vegas.  I think it was a little after 8 PM so it wasn't very busy, maybe only 2 or 3 other tables occupied.  That gave us a lot of time to look at the menu boards and talk with one of the owners behind the counter.  Pidgin accent do I detect?  Oh yeah, howzit brah!?  ""Oh yeah, you from Oahu?  Yeah, yeah I from Maui..."" and so on, and so on.  Within a 5 minute conversation I was able to easily navigate through Makai's menu.

Very similar in style to Chipotle as well as another local-run joint Braddah's.  Except instead of stuffing it into a burrito or a taco, you get a fancy foil bowl.  A taste of Hawaii, all in one!

 First you choose your SIZE of bowl:
*Ono (small) $4.99 - 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base
*Ono'er (medium) $6.99 - 2 meat, 2 side, 1 base
*Ono'est (large) $8.49 - 3 meat, 2 side, 1 base
*Bowl $5.99 - 2 meat, 1 base
*Salad $7.99 - 2 meat

Then you choose your base:
*White rice
*Brown rice (extra)

Then you choose your business (meat):
*Chicken - Teri, Pulehu, Katsu, or Mochiko Wings
*Pork - Kalua
*Steak - Teri or Pulehu (extra)
*Ahi Tuna! - Poke or Seared Poke (extra)

Then you pick a side:
*Garlic Edamame
*Corn
*Grilled Veggies
*Mac Salad
*Toss Salad
*Kimchee Slaw

Things on the line were dwindling that night so I asked if for our order they could cook us up fresh, not a problem!  Hot and tasty stuff from the grill.  We ordered:

-Ono'er bowl with rice, chicken katsu, teri steak, mac salad & kimchee slaw
-Ono'er bowl with rice, kalua pork, pulehu steak, double mac salad
-Salad with kalua pork, pulehu steak & creamy sesame dressing

Food was ONO!  Grilled items great with the papa'a (burnt) edges just like I like it.  Flavor was good and the katsu was moist & crunchy.  Mac salad was cold & simple the way it should be, kimchee slaw was a nice surprise!  Not too spicy.  Rice was actually cooked CORRECTLY!Wifey & kid liked their bowls as well, we pretty much sopped it all up!  

Don't forget the secrets here - shoyu & furikake on the rice (ask at the counter), shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco on the mac salad, Da Katsu Sauce on da katsu!  Sauces are clearly labeled at Makai!

OK, only reason Makai didn't get a 5-star?  They ran out of POKE!  NOOOOO!  Locals in the know, know that hot rice & cold poke make a person happy.  Next time Makai, make sure get poke for last all day long!  

Another plus for Makai though, they serve Coca-Cola products!  Plus for me anyway.

Makai Grill, I will be back brah...but make sure, bettah make sure, get nuff' poke for when I come around!

Both times I went it was pretty slow. I have to say I never rushed here because I just couldn't imagine it being that good. I was pleasantly surprised!

Makai serves Hawaiian plate lunches in a non traditional way. They have you choose white or brown rice THEN you add proteins! They have a lot of classics and then they have some special items that make the cost go up like poke and mochiko wings.

The food was all really good. I enjoyed everything. My recommendations would be their poke and their garlic edamame. The classics are done well and really hit the spot like the chicken katsu and the kalua pig.

My one gripe was the noticeable portioning. Hey man I'm all about food costs and making a living, but the first visit I had one of the servers take some food out of my tray because the portion was too much I suppose? Come on guys! Be a little slick! 

Overall I support local businesses and I'll definitely be back. The food hits the spot and it gives you a variety instead of ordering a huge serving of only one entree.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,2,5,wutkL96LWcUKnAVFfiYCJw

4052539,2017-01-15,6,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"All Good!! It's all good here at Makai.  All of my experiences at Makai have been really good ones.  This is fast Hawaiian food at its finest.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).  

The pricing is as good as it gets and I dare you to find another restaurant that sells quality Hawaiian food that even comes close.  The Ono, which is their small, is $4.99 and comes with your choice of one meat, rice, and a side.  The Ono'er, which is their medium, is $6.99 and comes with 2 meats, rice, and 2 sides.  The best value is their The Ono'est, which is their large, is $8.49 and comes with 3 meat sources, rice, and 2 sides.  Steak is an extra buck and the poke depends on their current market price.  I had their bowls and love the teri chicken.  I also like the fact that you can also order a la carte.  My most recent order was a side of 5 oz. steak and a 1/2 lb. Spicy Ahi Poke.  Both were great and at that price, a steal.  Overall, I do recommend and wish a place like Makai would open all over Las Vegas.

4100698,2016-07-20,0,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"Probably the best Hawaii food I have had in Las Vegas!  Everything was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Its like Chipotle, but Hawaii-food!  

Got the ono'est plate with mochico chicken wings, chicken katsu, and hawaiian poke with side garlic edamame & kimchee slaw.  Mochico chicken was a bit on the dryer side, but still very tasty.  The katsu was very moist and crunchy on the outside... So hard to do, but it was perfection.  The edamame was good, and well spiced and not overcooked.  The kimchee slaw was something else!  Its like a normal slaw, but with a kimchee base liquid... So ono!  The teri chicken for the kids was also moist and flavorful, but right on the borderline of too much char for me personally.

And now the best part... The poke!  The hawaiian and the spicy ahi poke was probably the best I have had in vegas.  Fresh, cut right, and without all the stringy parts.  Perfect amount of spice!  Also a decent price (was $13.99/lb).  

As a tip, do not order poke as a protein option for your plate.  You pay $1.25 more, for a tiny little cup.  Its totally not enough!  Its probably best to just get a 1/4 pound on the side.

My only two real disappointments with this place... The Samurai Hawaiian Frost cups cooler was wrecked!  Hardly any flavors left!  Also no fruit punch to speak of in the soda dispensers...

Also don't go on Sundays!  They are closed... (Ohana time)

How their Menu works is that you have your choices of 3 sizes...Ono (Small), Ono'er (Medium), and Ono'est (Large).

I saw a picture of the menu on here, so I won't go into great detail in that. I'll just give you the Basics.

Ono: Consists of 1 Serving of Meat, 1 Side, and a Base (White or Brown Rice).
Ono'er or Medium: Consists of 2 Servings of Meat, 2 Sides, and a Base.
Ono'est or Large: Consists of 3 Servings of Meat, 2 Sides, and a Base.
Bowl: Consists of 2 servings of Meat, and a Base.
They do have a Salad for I Believe 6.99

I had a Medium: Which was White Rice, Chicken Katsu, Teriyaki Chicken, Macaroni Salad, and Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing( Which was Delicious)

I didn't think it was gonna fill me up, it did! I will admit, the portions they give are not as plentiful, and it may not fill most people up. 

My opinion?? I would definitely be back, should I ever be in the area...but it is too far for me! You don't have to take my opinion for it.....Try it for yourself! =)

The only weird thing is they have a bowl that isn't like most places that have a ""bowl"". Basically, their bowl is the 2 meat combo without sides. You might as well just get the 2 meat combo because then you get 2 sides! I chose garlic edamame and kimchi slaw. I love kimchi, and this was a kimchi like coleslaw that paired great with the white rice.

3 brothers opened this amazing island eatz! They're legit island boyz, none of them imitation wannabes! This place is legitimately delicious! And not the small kine! I literally stopped eating my food to write this review. 

Upon entering this restaurant, you're kindly greeted by one of the brothers, he shows you his meats ;), and you make your creations!

The price point is seriously on point, 4.99 1 meat, 6.99 2 meats, and 8.49 3 meats ($1 extra per serving for steak and $1.25 extra per serving for poke.) Of course sides and a base. I decided to balls to the wall and get one of each, minus pork. The pulehu steak is seriously melt in your mouth delicious! Best I've ever had! The pulehu chicken is so succulent and delectable! The Ahí Poke in island style is out of this world! I don't even like fish! Katsu is tasty and not greasy! Mac salad is buttery and flavorful! And I'm legit the mac salad master, and this one is bomb!

The inside of this place is clean and beautiful and the employees seriously care here. They make sure the food is delicious and you are completely satisfied. I am just seriously blown away!

Pulehu steak was very Ono. Cooked just about to medium. 
Cali poke was also good. Not too spicy and etc and I'm sure a lil more spice wouldn't hurt. Still good. 

One of the down falls was that the portions was not ""Hawaiian"" style. Meaning on the smaller side. U know them Hawaiians are not afraid to eat. Will be back!!",y2651Fx4BMalRcfINMWniA,0,0,4,stM3B1G06o9uqBhKGMTcWg

I've been waiting for a place that sells poke by the pound since I moved here from Hawaii, well at least one that's close to me.

Taste:
My husband got an Ono'er combo (2 rice scoops, 2 meats and 2 sides) with brown rice, BBQ Chicken, Katsu, corn and cold slaw. The BBQ chicken was pretty burnt and hard. My husband came here first and said the BBQ Chicken the day he came was cook just right. Katsu was good.

I got a pound of poke in both half regular and half spicy. The spicy poke wasn't spicy at all.
But I understand that not many can tolerate spicy food. They had some sauces on the side which I didn't bother checking out so I probably missed out on some Sriracha or something so that was my fault. The regular poke was a tad, juuust a tad salty for me. Maybe it was just the batch. It wasn't too bad though. I had some of my husband's brown rice and mixed it with the regular poke to fix it. Other restaurant wouldn't bother on this but I do like that there are some seaweed and masago in their poke.

Quality:
It was BBQ chicken and Katsu, dark meat but cheaply priced so it was fine. Beside the pulehu being pretty burnt and hard. I honestly can't say too much about ""fresh fish/sashimi in Vegas"".

Portion:
The Ono'er was a generous size.

Price:
I believe our bill came out to around $25 no drink but including a 10% tip. It wasn't bad at all.
They charge extra $.50 for the brown rice option and $1.25 for each poke choice on the combo which was totally ok. A whole pound of poke was $13.99.

Service:
The employees were nice but should come out of their shell. 

Ambiance:
Love the music. It was like I didn't get off my car. The place was nice and clean. It was very similar to Chipotle's food concept and restaurant design.

Location:
Very convenient spot. Safe and open plaza. Will definitely add this to our new spot for when we pau grocery shopping.

Overall:
This is like Chipotle but Hawaiian, good concept. This place is better than To See Roll. I wish they had Mahimahi though.
I really wanted to give this place 5 starts but it's a 4 and a half for now. Well go back again and go from there. Overall it was still ono, mahalo!",AkxF-Hc7e8iAQkcTcJHGiA,0,0,4,FDVpGOnOmu8j_21SXDRhYw
4401326,2017-02-06,1,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"Makai - think: chipotle but for Hawaiian/Asian fusion cuisine. There are pre-made items that you just pick and choose.

You get to select what size you want, the smallest being 1 meat and 1 side. The next would be 2 meats and 2 sides. There were even options to make your own bowl or do an a la carte selection.

I chose the smallest. This was $5 and honestly was pretty satisfying - did not make me too full but I was good. It'd be a great lunch size. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of garlic edamame and you get your choice of rice. Brown rice was a little extra, fyi. 

The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection. They have a station next to the drinks that has teriyaki sauce (+ a spicy version if you so desire) so you can add more or add it to your rice like I did!

The garlic edamame was cold. I'm wondering if you can ask for it to be warmed up as I didn't like it as much cold. 

Overall the food was enjoyable and I'd come here again for either a quick lunch or dinner. Definitely possible to go in & out if you're on a time crunch and the options give you a variety where you can try something new every time you come!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,5,2,4,8FvsOL07Kmx8WGWWS8TZlw

Set up is definitely similar to chipotle where they put what you want in a bowl while going down the line.

I got the Ono'est (largest) where you get 3 meats and 2 sides. For the protein I got the Kalua pig, Mochiko wings, and Hawaiian style poke while sides I got macaroni salad and garlic edamame. 

Pros: The Mochiko Wings and Hawaiian Poke! The Mochiko wings were awesome. Sweet and salty and the chicken was still moist which is always a plus. The Poke was great. Nicely cubed and marinated with great flavor throughout. (But both have a fee to get them as a protein)

Cons: The pork and macaroni salad. The pork was way too salty. I had to take a bite of rice with it just to eat it. The macaroni salad I found was a bit saturated in mayonnaise so that's all I could taste which was a bit of a let down.

First, there was no more poke. Not complaining, maybe had I come earlier, there would've been some.

Second, my mom and I both wanted the steak. Come to find out it's made to order so I was asked to wait 10 minutes, no big deal. However, 20 minutes later I was still waiting for my steak. Why it takes 20 minutes to cook steak is beyond me. 

Third, my steak finally finished but was told I'd have to wait for the mochiko chicken to finish frying. That's when I was like, what the hell. I just waited over 20 minutes for my steak, now you're asking me to wait longer for my chicken? Instead I said to cancel my chicken and I'll just take something that was already cooked. I was trying my hardest not to get mad. I used to be in customer service, so I didn't wanna be that customer that gave a hard time over something that was out of their control. I had my mom and 2 year old in the car waiting, so I was kind of in a hurry and was not expecting to be waiting for that long.

I really do think their system needs to improve. Because waiting over 20 minutes for my food was a little ridiculous. Customer service was still great, everyone was very apologetic. I might not come back for awhile because of what happened, but my mom said the food was still delicious and it was worth waiting for.

I'm aware I'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to Hawaiian food, but I know what tastes good, and whether or not management is being stingy. 

I ordered the Ono'er (the medium sized plate). It includes 2 scoops of rice, 2 choices of meat, and 2 choices of sides. I got myself the teriyaki chicken, kalua pig, and a side of macoroni salad, and kimchi slaw. 

As a server builds up my plate, I watch him for a good 10 seconds each, picking out the smallest portions of meat he could find. Does he not think it looks bad on him to place a larger piece of chicken on my plate, only to put it back and replace it with a significantly smaller piece? At least they weren't stingy on the sides. 

Before you dig in, it's highly recommended to pick up one of the sauce bottles that are accompanied by forks and napkins. I prefer the Yaki sauce, even on the chicken katsu. The katsu sauce tastes too much like ketchup. 

The thing is, the food is good. But you have to douse every meat with the Yaki sauce, or else they'll taste a tad bland. The meat can also sometimes be a little dry. It's all these small things that add up. I really want to like this place, but they'll need to work on quality control for me to keep coming back.",MghRQ6h95OSD5so41-SPBA,1,0,3,TWapwyKMPfwWFouP6RGzmw

I typically go for kalua pig and Hawaiian style poke with corn and mac salad on the side, plus a can of Hawaiian Sun (though every single time I've been here the juice doesn't seem to be refrigerated well).

It's a simple menu: you choose the size (1, 2, or 3 meats), choice of meat(s), white or brown rice (2 scoops), and side(s). The meats all taste ono. The kalua pig (which is hard to find that tastes good out here) is tender and moist. The chicken and steak taste like home. Poke is also good; although most of the time, the Hawaiian style poke runs out and they only have the California style left (which is mehhh). You get all of this for a decent price.

Only thing I dislike is the rice. It's too hard. I don't know if it is undercooked, or if it's the type of rice they use, but I like my rice sticky and moist in my Hawaiian dishes. Also, maybe it's just this one occurrence, but there was a funky tang to the kimchee. For the sides, I recommend simple sweet corn, garlic edamame, and mac salad.

There's no shortage of choices with nine meats, five sides, three bases, and a myriad of sauces. 

My brother and I visited in the middle of the afternoon last week and it was surprisingly busy for a random weekday. There weren't any tables available when we arrived, but that quickly changed by the time we had our food. It's a very familiar style of ordering - you wait in line on the left and order down the line at the counter until you reach the cashier.

Pricing:
Ono (Small): 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base | $4.99
Ono'er (Medium): 2 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $6.99
Ono'est (Large): 3 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $8.49
Bowl: 2 meats, 1 base | $5.99
Salad: 2 meats, dressing | $7.99 (or $5.99 without meat)
*Steak is an extra $1 per serving
*Poke is an extra $1.25 per serving
*Brown Rice is an extra $0.50.

We opted for two ""Ono'est"" plates to try as many options as possible. The first plate: Pulehu Steak, Kalua Pig, Hawaiian Pok?, Tossed Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing, Macaroni Salad, and Brown Rice ($11.24). The second plate: White Rice, Mochiko Wings, Chicken Katsu, Seared Spicy Ahi Pok?, Macaroni Salad, and Kimchi Slaw ($9.74). We really enjoyed all the items. Everything was flavorful and exactly what you want in Hawaiian eats. The tossed salad was fresh with a great dressing; the kimchi slaw was surprisingly delightful; and all of the OGs were done right (Kalua Pig, Poke). This is definitely the best plate lunch spot in Vegas!

Extra details: There are two types of Ahi Poke, Hawaiian and Spicy; both can be seared per request. There are sauces available next to the soda fountain: Da Katsu Sauce, Da Spicy Sauce, Da Steak Sauce, and Da Yaki Sauce. (The names may have changed a little because I swear there was a Spicy Yaki?)

I ordered the large, with katsu chicken, kalua pig, & the spicy poke. Sides were white rice with garlic edamame & macaroni salad. 
The chicken & pig were super good. The katsu was not dry at all and tasted great with the sauce. The pig was juicy and had great flavor. 
Garlic edamame was basic but good. And macaroni salad was great, better than L&L in my opinion. 
The spicy poke was good at first but it got a but salty and I ended up not finishing it.

I really enjoy the teriyaki chicken here, as they mentioned it was the top seller.

I always go for the Ono (small) plate, it comes with brown rice or white rice, just keep in mind that the brown rice is an additional $.60 charge. The proteins available are teriyaki chicken, kahlua pig, chicken wings or you can pay the extra $1 for the ahi or steak. 

The mac salad on the side is also my favorite mac salad of any Hawaiian spot in the valley. Something about it here tastes extra fresh and there's that love put into the recipe that I really admire also!

4876211,2016-01-27,1,V-0qRzBHKixmQgon_fW_AA,"I was driving around my neighborhood when I Yelp'd Hawaiian food and Makai popped up. Saw the location and didn't recognize it on the map due to the fact that I drive by there 4x or more a week and didn't know about it blew me away. Regardless of having heard about it or not the reviews were fairly good on Yelp though there were  only 10, I had to give it a go! (After talking to one of the three owners who are brothers I learned they opened only 3 days prior to my visit, pretty amazing reviews considering how long it has been in business).

I walked in and it wasn't very busy but there were a handful of people eating in. Walked up to the counter and right away and was greeted by a friendly guy with a big smile. I asked, ""so how does this work?"" Meaning, how do I order? After explaining I pretty much choose the amount of meat I want and I get 1-2 sides along with rice (base). I ordered the Ono'est= Large: chicken katsu (x2), pulehu steak, tossed salad with sweet onion vinaigrette and garlic edamame. 
-Chicken katsu: crispy, hot/fresh, not greasy considering its deep fried.
-pulehu steak: tender, juicy, perfectly sweet and savory, real island bbq.
-tossed salad: fresh and crisp, tried it with glazed almonds and though I'm not sure if it is homemade it paired great and was delicious.
sweet onion vinaigrette: vibrant color, not too sweet. *there is also a creamy sesame dressing that sounded great too. 
-garlic edamame: if you like garlic you will love this, edamame was still firm with a good crunch.
They also approached me instead of me asking, if I wanted to try the poke and of course I did. The two I tried were ahi (tuna), one had a creamy texture/flavor and the other was traditional. Flavors all poke lovers would enjoy! 
*Try to go early to be sure you get your hands on some.

This place is fast food style, all the food is precooked and lying on trays and you get to pick what you want kind of like chipotle. They have size options that comes with rice, meat, and sides. They also have up charge items like brown rice, beef, and poke. 

I got the large size because it's the most bang for your buck. You get three meats, and two sides.  I got the spicy poke, chicken Katsu and mochiko chicken wings. Sides I got the kimchee slaw and of course the infamous macaroni salad. My friends also got the kalua pork, teriyaki steak and teriyaki chicken, sweet corn, and garlic edamame. We basically ordered the entire menu. 

Everything I had was pretty delicious. The poke was definitely fresh and flavorful. The pieces of tuna were large and fresh!  My chicken Katsu was very crispy. It isn't seasoned so you need a sauce. The mochiko chicken wings were sweet!  Really bomb. The kalua pork was fatty and juicy, not dry at all. The kimchi slaw was a great balance to everything cause it was refreshing and spicy. My macaroni salad was creamy and traditional. The sweet corn was very good as well. For the edamame I couldn't really taste the garlic.

It was somewhat busy Saturday during lunch but not hectic enough for the workers to be so irritable. No hi, welcome to Makai was uttered, not even a simple hello. What greeted us was a lifeless what is your order going to be? Ummm ok, awkward.

We decided on 2 Ono'er (medium $6.99) plates, 1 Ono'est (large $8.49) and salad ($7.99). The way they have it set up is you pick your base, sides and protein. Price is standard until your ""upgrades"" and then bam before you know it, your plate is close to $10. I don't really mind paying more if it's worth it but when meat portions are somewhat questionable and taste is sub par then we have a slight problem. My mom's salad was definitely not worth $7.99, there was barely any greens and proteins. I enjoyed my pulehu chicken, great flavors. Spicy poke was just ok as was the mac salad. Edamame needed to be boiled longer, was so hard that I couldn't take out the bean without crushing it. Garlic seasoning was tasty but it was frustrating eating those suckers. The kalua pig was salty and barely had smoky taste and flavor. My husband enjoyed his mochiko wings and said the kimchi slaw was surprisingly good, I wasn't on the same page.

I wanted to order for pick up and I called from my office and cell found it odd that the phone was never answered. I get there and there are 3 people in line. I placed my order and asked for an extra side of spicy poke I was told I can't unless I order the large meal. I even told them to charge me they apparently couldn't do that either. When I got to the register I asked to verify the phone number it was the same one I had called. He said that they don't answer the phone if they are busy. To me that's just bad service. You may ask why I still went only because it was the pregnant friend of mine whom really wanted the food..  the food was good but the service hmmm not the best.

En pese con pedir mi orden y le pedí al muchacho un side adicional de spicy poke pero me aviso que no podía que tendría que ordenar otro plato más grande que no me podía cobrar por lo que pedía así que lo deje y seguí. Cuando llegue a la registradora le pregunté al otro joven que si me podía confirmar el número de teléfono y si yo había marcado bien le mencione que llame varias veces y de varios números y que no me contestaron. Y me dijo que si ellos están ocupados que no contestan el teléfono. Y eso para mí es mal servicio.

So the first time I've been here was over a year ago around the time they first opened since I work at Driven Boutique next door! The first time I ate here was before I became pescatarian so I've tried the teriyaki chicken and the steak and they were SOOO good especially when you get the steak fresh!! (I would request it, does take a bit longer but it's so worth it) But now that I'm pescatarian I'm only able to eat the poke which I'm not complaining about!! My typical order now would be the small with brown rice, w/ either just the Hawaiian poke or I get half and half of the Hawaiian and spicy tuna which is another tip I suggest if you want both, and the green salad with the sesame dressing (YALL THIS IS BOMB DONT SLEEP ON IT) with the candied almonds on top(ALSO OBSESSED WITH THIS ASK FOR IT ON THE TOP OR ON THE SIDE) I always ask for as much almonds as they can give me because it just goes so well with the salad and dressing! The small gets me at a perfect and satisfied full, not too full where I feel bloated but satisfies my hunger! The staff is always so nice and sweet to me! The only complaint I have is that they up charge for brown rice.. I mean it's only 50 cents more but why :( other than that I love this place and eat here multiple times per week! Perfect healthy and satisfying meal! Another tip is, when you come past 8 chances are they are out of poke! Also, I hate that they are closed on Sunday's because sometimes after church I be craving but remember it's close but I like that they give Sunday's off to their employees to have family time which is what Sunday's are all about in my opinion! I love love love this place y'all need to try NOW!

Some of items I triedI included: Katsu (cripsy outside, tender inside), Teri chicken (good flavor), mochiko wings, (not enough mochiko for me) kalua pork (tender and not dry) , spicy poke,(yummy)  garlic edamame (So good! ), kimchi slaw (yummy, carrots included) mac salad.(Not overly sweet, shredded carrots included). 

I really don't like having too many carrots for the side dishes because my bestie is allergic to carrots, nuts, soy, and corn. So pretty much everything on the side was not a great choice. 

I haven't tried the pulahu (grilled versions) since it was $1 more, but will next time.

However, the protein here is really good. Their teri chicken among other meats are grilled and has that great BBQ flavor you find on the islands. Their sauce (Da sauce) here, oddly enough is very watery.  But when I ate more and more of it, I actually liked it more because it doesn't cover up the bbq taste and just give a hint of teri sauce or spicy, depending which bottle you get. 

Their Ono'er (Medium) is about $7.50 after tax and pretty much is enough to feed a grown man. The Poke here is delicious and I was able to just buy 1/4 pound as well.  Will be back soon for Ono gridz!",GaTWkVy-pY6phZOqW6ykuw,2,2,5,qIya_91Kcw2MJm_KgRjFpg

I went in at 12:30 on a Saturday.  The katsu would've taken ""8-10 minutes"" to prepare.  I probably would've waited but he already had the 2 other meats on the plate when he told me there'd be a wait.  (When I said the 3 meats I wanted I said in this order ""mochiko wings, chicken katsu, palehu steak"").  I believe the guy at the start of the assembly line was pretty new, so I understand.. But to not have some katsu even cooking during a lunch rush was a little disappointing.  
Regardless of this experience the food I did order was so ono I will definitely be back.  
I ordered the mochiko wings (awesome flavor, juiciness & crunch) pulehu steak (tender and seasoned just right) Hawaiian style poke (almost as good as poke express, just wish the cup was a little bigger), Mac salad (finally a Hawaiian place that puts potato in the Mac salad!  Just like my grandmas), garlic edamame (delicious), and brown rice (just brown rice lol).
My mom ended up with the same plate I had since they didn't have Katsu or mixed veggie's.  After she ate she forgot she wanted anything different.

The pulehu steak was pretty good. Could have provided us with a little more, but it was certainly good. 

I like chicken katsu but have a difficult time looking for a Hawaiian Food restaurant that can make good chicken katsu, and this place had some bomb ass katsu. The chicken katsu was thick, not flat like most restaurants. On top of that, the katsu was super juicy. My son absolutely loved it.

The kalua pig was juicy. It was so delicious that it really made me feel like I was at home. I can make kalua pig at home but when I don't have time or patience to cook it, I would like a restaurant to have it. Makai's one was so ono!

I am not a big fan of Poke, but my brother and boyfriend thought it was good. Almost to the point that they wanted me to make a second pick up within 15 minutes of bringing the food home.

They also sell a handful of different flavors of Hawaiian Sun drinks. Of course, the price is pretty high for a can of Hawaiian Sun but my kids loved it so I purchased it for them.

The atmosphere is simple but relaxing. Super clean, and the people were pretty nice. There are lots of parking. I can't wait to try the different types of chicken and steak.

The prices are fairly cheap for what they give you but for any beef options you have to pay extra so your basically left with chicken only if you don't want to pay extra, chicken katsu or teriyaki chicken etc. The other meat options were $1.50 more. The portions we're decent size. So you get two types of meats, two sides and two large scoops of rice for like $8 with bottle water which is fairly cheap. 

The sesame dressing was dam good. It was for the salad but I used it to dip the chicken katsu and it was better than the katsu sauce. I would have given them another star but the service seem a bit shotty. The restaurant was run basically by high school kids. When I went in Friday evening. They had run out of all poke I guess that is understandable since it was an hour before closing. The girl who was ringing me up asked me what salad dressing I wanted and I didn't know what they had she rattled off so fast that all I heard was sesame and that's what I took. 

She needs a lesson in service, not all customers who come in are regulars and know what salad dressing they have and she needs to slow down instead of just rattling off like I'm bugging her. It wasn't like the place was busy I was the only one ordering at the time. Also it was my first time and they could have asked me if I have been there before and if I needed any help ordering.

I don't know what the hell they put in the poke, but it was delicious...sucks that it was a small amount so I cried a little on the inside. The rice was a bit dry, I'm not sure if it was old rice or that's just how they make it. The salad just pretty plain with romaine, carrots, and some cucumbers - still good though but I could just make that at home.

I've had this marked so twas the best time to do it since we were already on this part of town. There were a few people in the building enough to make you think, wow...these folks definitely got business. 

Service was mediocre. Nothing welcoming nor unwelcoming. Just a bunch of folks standing behind the counter doing their job. No prob, though. I was just excited to try somewhere new.

We ordered a bowl (2 proteins and 2 scoops of rice) of chicken katsu and spicy ahi, 1 Ono (1 protein, 1 scoop of rice, and 1 side) with the chicken teriyaki, 1 Ono'er (2 proteins, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides) with spicy ahi and mochiko chicken, and an extra order of garlic edamame on the side. All our sides we opted for garlic edamame and 1 of their sweet corn.

I love the concept of this place! From choosing your protein to your sides. I love garlic edamame so honestly, being able to have this option on my plate was seriously the need for me to try this spot out. 

But to be honest, the food was jusssst alright. I had 4 pcs of mochiko chicken wings that were the tiny kine chicken wings. By the time I finished the wings, which didn't take long at all, I still couldn't figure out if the mochiko chicken was legit. I think the flavor almost had me by the 4th one, but I feel as tiny as those wings are...they should increase the serving. Not to mention the chicken was pretty dry and chewy. Clearly been sitting for abit. The spicy ahi was pretty decent as well. It tasted super fishy, though. Which may sound funny to many out there, but fish shouldnt taste l...""fishy"". My husband enjoyed it. I liked it...but not a fan of fish tasting like fish if you know what I mean.

The sweet corn kind of reminded me of canned corn. I was hoping to feel excited off the corn, but I wasnt. That got abandoned. 

My son had a couple strands of hair in his serving of poke, which they gladly replaced. Same batch of poke, just no scoop of hair in this one. The young lady running the register did apologize. My son didn't really like his poke because he got a lot of the peices that were the chewier cuts. The chicken katsu is made with chicken thighs. You get 1 thigh cut into voila, katsu status. Overall, the son agrees that everything on his plate was jusssst alright. I could tell he wasn't excited about it because he didn't kill his plate as he normally would if something was on point. The kid is only 8, but he's a beast when it comes to his food and he has impressive tastebuds. His opinion matters. Lol.

The other son had the chicken teriyaki. I mean, chicken teriyaki is pretty basic. I believe the chicken teriyaki is chicken thighs as well just cut into peices. The Ono was a perfect serving for my 6 year old, who didn't even finish it. Not because he didn't like it, but because he's the polar.opposite of his big brother. He, too, is an edamame lover so he def killed that.

Overall, we spent about $26 for our meal. The dining room was filled and folks were still coming in. I started feeling bad for those who got their food, then had to do the grueling search for an open seat you know has yet to exist. 

I would recommend someone in the area to give it a shot or anyone who just wants a different hawaiian eating experience. We probably wouldn't make such a drive specifically for this place being that it's across town. Nothing wowed or had my tastebuds on its knees for more. The first experience just didn't go too swell.

Definitely kid friendly and you could get away with bringing a stroller in here as well.

I ordered a salad... The price confused me because it costs seventy cents more and you get one side less than the two meat bowl. As you can see the 'salad' is lettuce. That's it. No topping as shown in menu. My 'salad' cost me 10.80. Look at the picture. That's sad. Lettuce and some meat. 

The chicken was weighed and weighed again. She took five different pieces in and out of my bowl... I'm just like dude is five grams of chicken thigh that serious? The chicken was old and dry, which was a bummer. I love their chicken and sauce usually. 

When I asked for two different dressings to try a new one she told me it would cost fifty cents... Then she has my friend bring me an extra so I had two of the same dressing!! Why?",rpWCcNQD7nGVUYoU6vzCFw,0,1,2,U8yzQ1lLhXMZJlBmegWS6Q

I never eat in, always take out.
 
But the queen of the castle, cream of the crop, apple of my eye, most beloved item on the menu is their spicy ahi poke.  The portion as part of a meal is never enough, so I order the larger size on its own.  There's been several times where my wife and I get a pound of it for $14 and pair it with rice and salad at home for a satisfying dinner.  I try to go before 7pm because they occasionally run out and that's really the only time I end up on Skype with my psychiatrist in a parking lot as they help me through breathing exercises while I sweat profusely, rocking my body back and forth with Celine Dion's version of ""All by Myself"" on infinite loop.

Knowing I wouldn't be back for awhile, I decided to go ahead and go balls to the wall and order the large. The large is composed of 3 meats and 2 sides. Heads up: the poke, steak, and brown rice is extra, but believe me when I say the spicy poke is absolutely worth paying extra. I'll get into more details in a bit.

I ordered the kalua pig which is a shredded pork, the spicy poke, and chicken katsu. So, back to the poke I was talking about earlier! If you're a fan of spicy, it has a nice little bite to it. The poke bits were nice and chunky too. It's absolutely worth paying extra for!

The kalua pig was thankfully moist thanks to the natural fattiness of pork and the seasoning was just right. I'm not a katsu fan, but I got it anyway. It was good, but I'd imagine it would be pretty damn good to someone who actually orders katsu regularly.

As far as servings go, they don't hold back here. The medium probably would have sufficed, but as I mentioned earlier, I wanted to go all out.

I didn't catch the guy's name that helped us, but he was funny and overall a cool guy.

Makai definitely hit the spot. I ordered the Medium bowl with teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, brown rice, kimchee slaw (10/10 for kimchee lovers), and the garlic edamame.  

The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection, it was still moist and not covered in an unnecessary amount of teriyaki sauce. The chicken katsu was perfectly crispy and the inside was soft and juicy! The kimchee slaw was delicious on so many levels. I'll probably end up getting double kimchi slaw the next time! They do have furikake so make sure you ask for it and put it on your rice for some extra flavor!

Makai is located on Fort Apache, right across from Walmart and in the same plaza as Sweet Addiction.

It kind of reminds me of Chipotle in the sense where you get to choose what you want in your order. They have an assortment of sizes to select from that all vary in the base (white or brown rice), meat (chicken, steak, ahi poke, etc.) and a side if available. You can also choose to add on a side if you'd like. The ordering is pretty straight forward, so just go for what you'd like. If you decide on the poke, there's a regular one and a spicy. I opted for the spicy and it was delicious!

We are regulars at Sweet Addiction, so I was excited to see this place being built a few doors down. I hate to admit it, but we have been coming here at least twice a week. The food is just so good!

The first time I dined here, it reminded me of a Chipotle, but Hawaiian style. I do appreciate the different sizes that they offer - you can choose a small plate that comes with one meat and one side, or the large plate that comes with three servings of meat and two sides. Don't care for the sides? They also have a bowl with two servings of meat. So far, my favorites are the Teriyaki Steak and the Kalua Pork. The Teriyaki Steak has great flavor, is cooked well and never disappoints. The Kalua Pork is also delicious and I like how they don't put cabbage in their version. I'm so happy because it is very hard to find good Kalua Pork in this city. Usually I find it to be flavorless, dry or too watery. Makai and Braddah's are the only two places where I can eat it. I'm not too crazy about their sides, but if I do get them, its usually the edamame and corn. I choose the brown rice once, but it was kind of dry. Maybe I'm just a rice connoisseur, but I feel that many people don't know how to cook brown rice. Normally it requires more water and longer cooking times. But no problem, I am cool with eating white rice.

The employees are very friendly. Glad to see that there are always many people at the restaurant. Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for good Hawaiian food!!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,8,9,5,FLC7KxZiI-Ap8JAJmHZRlg

You can select from several different sizes varying from a small bowl with one protein option to the largest option that allows you to choose three different proteins. On my first visit I ordered the poke, kalua pork and pulehu steak with brown rice. The kalua pork was good but not great but the poke and and pulehu steak were tasty. On my second visit I went with the Mochiko chicken and poke salad which was delicious. 

I enjoy that they offer so many health options and allow you to choose brown rice or salad in place of white rice. I look forward to returning soon for some more poke and Mochiko chicken. The prices are reasonable but can get high as you add additional add-ons.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,20,16,3,-ilGksuO5BL7hyq8JQgKKA
