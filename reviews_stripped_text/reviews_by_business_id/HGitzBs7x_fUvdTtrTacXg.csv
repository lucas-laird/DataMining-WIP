35456,2012-08-06,0,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"To be honest, the boy and I generally ignore this side of Aria. After a lackluster experience at Sage and not ever really being in the mood for tapas, there wasn't must reason to be there. This weekend however we had Aria food credits to spend and wanted to try something new. Tetsu is apparently very new as it just opened this past Wednesday, August 1. 

Front staff: The entranced was manned (or should I say womanned) by 3 young ladies. They were nice and attentive. We were promptly seated at our own teppanyaki grill, which was great because I've gone to other places and they like to lump you together right away. Other guests were also seated at their own tables.

Atmosphere/Decor: I found the entrance beautiful, especially as the sun was setting and the backlighting really made the colors pop. However, once you are led to your seat the décor drastically changes to a simple modern stone background. I was a little disappointed that the interior didn't mirror the beautiful qualities of the entrance, but I'm not there to stare at the design, I'm there to eat. For attire I marked casual, but I would lean it more toward dressy-casual. At least wear a nice shirt people! Overall, if you want to know the ""feelings"" associated with Tetsu, I would describe them as neutral. It's not a place that gives you the warm and fuzzies like a log cabin, but it isn't uninviting like the DMV either. It's hard to explain I guess, but I just associate modern design and décor with neutrality. Moving on.      

Food: Four grills surround an ice mountain where you see vegetables and seafood. 
The menu offers appetizers, meats, vegetables, and rice. 

-For the appetizer we went with the jalapeno calamari. It was f.r.e.s.h. The chef brought out the whole squid and tiny octopus on a wooden board and chopped it up right in front of us. The jalapenos were seeded and cut fresh inches away from me as well. A few minutes later we were dipping our calamari into two seafood sauces: salsa verde (good) and salsa roja (awesome). This is coming from a gal who looooooooves green salsas over red any day of the week too. Two side notes: sauces are brought out in chilled square black rock containers. So cool (literally and figuratively)! And FYI, this is naked calamari, not deep fried-watching-a-sporting-event calamari. The calamari was flavorful, not overly chewy and the jalapenos tasted like red and green pepper - duh, the seeds were gone and it's been cooked. 

-For dinner we had 10 ounces of filet minion and I added kale, corn, zucchini and eggplant. The vegetables were cooked first. The kale and corn were delicious. The zucchini and eggplant were really good too, but not as awesome as the corn! I am a biased corn lover though. For you meat lovers, the filet and rib eye are charged by the ounce. If you must know, twelve dolla-make-you-holla for filet and ten for rib. Ten ounces at twelve bucks, you do the math. Our chef brought out the rib eye by mistake, but we didn't mind because it was beautiful piece of meat! Something like an 80 oz. filet was brought out and the chef cut off our piece and put it straight on the grill with sprigs of rosemary on top. I like my filet medium, but we went for medium well (a crime I know) and it was so, so good. Melt in your mouth filet minion goodness. Two sauces are also brought out for the meat: another salsa verde (cilantro if I recall) and a chili soy sauce. Of the two, I loved the chili soy sauce. Finally, we had the wagyu fried rice. I don't know if this was a wild rice, but it was black or purple in color along with cuts of wagyu beef, vegetables, and we added egg. I was stuffed at this point and my senses were dulled, but the Mr. said it was really good.

Service: Our server Milan was so, so sweet and attentive. Almost too attentive, hehe. Is this what Kate Middleton feels like? He checked in on us frequently and we were well taken care of. This is what fine dining should always be like. Luckily, Vegas always seems to treat us well. Our chef, Yoku (I might be wrong) was funny and corny - just like me. I've only gone to teppanyaki a few times, but I swear it is a requirement that the chefs be personable and be able to crack jokes. What a hoot! Note: there will be no showboating here; I secretly hoped for an onion volcano but it didn't happen. What matters is that he made everything taste awesome. Lastly, the executive chef greeted us when we were seated and he was out and about overseeing that everything was going well. I don't know about you, but I appreciate things like that. 

Summary: Tasty, melt in your mouth food. Attentive, friendly staff. Expect to pay around ninety dollars per person not including drinks, so come eat here before you lose all your money at the Texas Hold'em table.",n2xGqfJOdUXuzGqY1tCUGQ,1,1,5,LI3WAyGG9KwI2SUAjuhLzg

Thankfully, was not the ""fling fried egg at your face"", knife juggling, rice volcano spectacle.  I actually was blown away at the culinary experience! 
I ordered fingerling potatoes with bacon and the thyme duck. My husband got the seabass and of course the fried rice. They started dishes sauteing fresh herbs, and finished with a beautifully cut and artfully plated dish.  The seabass was like butter, the duck was absolutely amazing. The potatoes were to die for.  All delivered tapas style, so each could be enjoyed and shared at a nice pace.

It is entertaining to watch the masterful chef prepare your meal in front of you. It's not theatrical, just classy. You're grouped around the grill with 6 diners and we got to know a very nice couple. It was their 20th trip to the restaurant! Now that's a recommendation. If you're intimidated by Japanese food this restaurant is not a concern. The ingredients and flavors seemed fairly western to me. We had the lobster, lamb, scallop, chicken dumplings, Chinese broccoli and creme brûlée and everything was wonderful.

I've been to a few teppanyaki restaurants and this one really impressed me. With the display of fresh ingredients and herbs surrounding the teppan chef, it made me eager to see what creations he would put on my plate.

I opted for the Lobster entree and boy was I glad! A whole lobster with tons of garlic, rosemary can only be good and that it was. It was so mouthwateringly good, it made you want the mountain of lobster meat to be bottomless.

I had a yuzu cocktail which had a spicy kick to it and was a great accompaniment to my dinner. And lastly we ended with some Yuzu sorbet which was very refreshing.

I highly recommend this resto for a special occasion!",BYTI34s-Q1FaYlxVtD3_lA,1,0,5,WT4Q_WkvrL1nSYQ1zU1iJQ

Everything was perfect.  Starting with the awesome entry to the restaurant.  I loved the majestic doors! Then our sommelier (T.J.) provided expert commentary and advice on the wine list.  He just had a very nice way about him as we went through the wine choices.  I also really enjoyed watching the great skills and the attention to detail displayed by our personal chef.   I had some sushi pieces as appetizers, followed by prime rib with shiitake mushrooms and shrimp fried rice.  Again, everything was outstanding.  

We also ordered ohmi beef to share.  This was quite the treat as I've never had ohmi beef before.  Wow!!!  It just melted on my tongue.  The ""emperor's beef"" is definitely something we will all remember for a long time.

Seared scallop appetizer is the best scallop I've ever had! 
Foi grais- not on menu but you can still order it. Was very good, I usually don't like it but I loved this one! Easy to share because you only want a couple bites
Zucchini, mushrooms, and asparagus make for great light vegetable sides
Sea bass was moist, tender, and tasty
Filet mignon- extra pricey but excellent 
Lime chicken- very tender and tasty
Lastly the chili cilantro shrimp fried rice was a very good twist on fried rice. Wasn't overly soaked with soy sauce, wonderful combination of flavors.

1425485,2014-08-10,0,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"I love Teppanyaki, and Tetsu is by far the best Teppan restaurant I have had the pleasure at which to dine.  As Mike O. said, this is not your Benihana style showman Teppan where you engorge yourself; this is fine dining at its highest.  If you want to be loaded up on average meats and root vegetables, there's a Benihana at the LVH.  If you are looking for an exquisite dining experience that takes the best of Teppan and prepares it individually, this is your place.  

Ratings seem to be low based on price, service and quality of food.  There is a $$$ premium for eating in Las Vegas (the LVH Benihana is not much less expensive), and I have found the prices at Tetsu to be more than reasonable when considering the quality of the food and the location of the restaurant.  The service is excellent, designed to be slow so you can enjoy your food, with consistent check-ins from staff that keep up with the ambiance but do not overwhelm or herd you out.  I do not understand how anyone could see this food as average -- the wine and sake selection is some of the best in America, the food options incredible, the food fresh and cooked with a care and compassion that lets the flavor of the food shine rather than (as with most Teppan places) a load of sauces to mask the taste of average food.  If you want an excellent dining experience that focuses on quality and your company over quantity and a quick finish so you can get back to the slot machines, I cannot recommend a better place.",Splhu18GE4FGTwOZWCaAaQ,1,0,5,lCUmdgHbXC502DDhGT3Xkw
1448945,2015-06-29,0,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"My wife and I had the opportunity to visit Tetsu this past Friday night and were not disappointed. The intelligent layout of the place fed a pleasing combination of natural and overhead lighting to all of the teppan grill tables and decor was warm and subdued offering a break to the frequent over-the-top extravagance of Las Vegas.

Servers were immediately attentive and helpful and guided us through getting the most out of their menu. Suggestions were offered on effective food pairings to guarantee that we got the most out of exploration of the menu and our chef executed each dish flawless leaving each course perfectly timed. Just enough time to linger on why the last dish was exquisite and as soon as we began to wonder what the next would be like it would be placed before us.

I am sure that there are other, better reviews that call out the finer points of their amazing wine list or the perfect balance on their filets or scallops but I wanted to mention the corn, morel and pea fried rice as it probably doesn't get its praises sung enough. I've never tasted something so comfortable and inviting. To eat it was to be transported to a grandmother's dinner table and have the world melt away for a moment. Comfort food and fine dining in Las Vegas don't often go together and so I thought it was worth mentioning.

Lastly often with these places the chef is sadly a perfunctory figure. A mascot trotted out to justify the cost of the extravagance. This was not the case. Chef Masa Takayama quietly moved from table to table and greeted each patron before returning to task of guiding his restaurant.

We will certainly be back!",IvYsHFaZ5JThiDmlD_Ot5w,0,0,5,AoUO_hutu6YwSenWa0aC_g

Cook needs to learn how multi task and cook more than 1 item at a time.  I finished my vegetables before the meat.  I also finished my meat before the rice dish.  It was the sad representation of a fusion hibachi.  Seriously everyone watched one dish cook at at a time.  I guess having a huge flat top isn't enough space to cook more than one dish at a time.  If food tasted better and could be enjoyed at actual course instead of soooo slow you can't but one part at a time this place might reached 2 or 3 star.

They have DIVINE DROPLETS.  So delish.  Two sizes to order from.

Cold:
-Wasabicress, the dressing completely takes away from the bitter greens.  SO good.
-Lobster carpaccio, ok, would not order again
-Toro tartar and caviar, beautiful luscious appetizer

Teppan:
-Squab and kale, nice and gamey, perfectly cooked and loved the kale.
-Chinese greens, garlicky, tender but with a crunch
-Rib Eye, flavorful, but too fat and I LOVE fat
-Maitakes with truffle butter, my fave shrooms EVER
-Jidori chicken balls, good, maybe dark meat would have been better?
-Spinach and shrimp dumplings, super healthy and low carb, good
-Salmon with dill sauce, loved the salmon, although more cooked than I would have liked, seasoned well but the sauce was so creamy and reminded me of Sizzler
-Wagyu fried rice, good, after all the meat, we were stuffed and could not fully enjoy, I would have liked to have it during the meal

Ambiance
Trendy upscale interior with several semi circular tables seating about six with a teppanyaki grill at each table. Seats were comfortable, and there wasn't a smoky smell nor did we leave smelling like grilled meat. 


Service
The hostesses were somewhat aloof but professional.  The server was very good, though with the food cooked in front of us she didn't have to do too much except deliver drinks or sometimes move the food one foot from the grill to in front of us. The father sitting next to us with his family was an absolute d-bag (he complained a lot and swore in front of his two young sons), and she didn't seem to lose her cool with him. The chef was very serious and stern and said virtually nothing to anyone at the whole table. I didn't expect knife juggling, but a few words would've been nice. 

Food
We went for the prix fixe menu which was $70 each and included several courses including prawn appetizer, choice of meat for main course, and shrimp fried rice (among other things). We also had a couple of cocktails and later a couple soft drinks. Side note - they charged for every soft drink refill (they didn't mention this when they were refilling the drinks). Utterly ridiculous for a place like this. We often have one round of cocktails followed by soft drinks and have never been charged for refills at other very upscale eateries on the strip. The food was pretty good. The steak was very tender. Likewise the chicken was tasty with a very light teriyaki glaze. The vegetables were all very fresh. It was good but not exceptional. The prixe fixe included a grapefruit ice dessert, and we added a white chocolate miso creme brûlée which sounded intriguing just to try it. It was also good but not great. 

Mojo
Overall this was a fun experience, and I think it's the only teppanyaki on the strip. The food was good though not great. The server was very good and the chef stoic. The total bill with drinks, tip, and tax was almost $300. Compared with all the other upscale meals we've had on the strip for similar prices this one really underwhelmed. Having tried it once I think it's doubtful we would return (if it stays open).",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,3,3,3,ZIThCAd6TCd5lbBCZqQOOg

Being from California, it's the foie that drew us in and it continues to blow us away.  The asparagus is also amazing.  This trip, we also tried the wagyu and the lobster with sriracha mayonnaise.  Both were excellent.  The only dish I wouldn't recommend is the garlic fried rice.

2318575,2013-12-25,0,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"WOW!!!! What a joke!!! I must say I never pay attention to the prices at restaurants as I have gotten older, however having said that... The prices at Tetsu are just offensive! Being a family restaurant such as it is where you sit at a table with strangers, one would think the prices would reflect this type of place. Not the case here...

 We weren't that hungry so we decided to split a 10 ounce rib eye steak at $100.00 (ala cart). And even at $100.00 it would be fine if half the steak were not fat. Half of the steak was completely inedible. Ok moving forward... 

I ordered a glass of plum wine at a cost of $28.00. Now please understand a whole bottle of plum wine at bev mo is about $7.00. $28.00 for a glass? How would you feel? 

So now we get back to our room and my wife asked me if I still a copy of our bill? it just so happens I had stuffed the check in my pocket ( I never go over my restaurant bills so I almost always toss my receipt in the nearest trash can). When she went over the bill, there were items on the bill that we either never received or never ordered at all! 

The server tried to sell ust the miso brûlée however we were not interested in a soy based desert. We were charged for the desert we never ordered nor ever received just the same. Our shared meal with a total of 3 drinks was $301.87 (including the tip). Had the food and the overall experience been great , no problem with the price. This was not the case. At Tetsu!!! 

I write this review without an ounce of exaggeration or agenda of any degree. Being in Las Vegas our choices of good restaurants are endless, Tetsu is just not among the good ones. You should avoid this restaurant at all cost. Eat well my friends!",7JnKVxH7j4YC47-_4tPubw,2,0,1,_7hIymu7nzd_N6Wsl2kDvw

We sat at the table with the grill. We ordered tons of food right off the bat, just to get it going quickly. We ordered the mushrooms (phenomenal), the avacado tomato salad (lots of flavor), the sea scallop  (melt in your mouth) and the 8oz wagu ribeye (the best piece of meat I've ever put in my mouth). 
The staff was so friendly and helpful for a quick decision making process (we are talking like 20 mins till our flight was scheduled to board). The chef was so sweet. Such a great, warm smile. I felt like it was family. Our server was fast, efficient, and explained everything very well, Down to sauces and ingredients. I had zero questions! That never happens. He covered everything before I got the chance to ask anything. 
Then at the end, our chef was so pleasant and excited to tell us that CHEF MASA was in the restaurant. This is a huge deal, as he lives in NY and only comes to Vegas once a month to visit. We caught him. 
I walked up to him, shook his hand and just hugged him. He is the sweetest, most down to earth man. So personable. He grabbed my face and kissed my cheek. I love to give praise and respect where it is due. But more than him warming my heart, he warmed my insides with hot, delicious food. I cannot Rave enough about this place or him! And I For sure cannot wait to try his restaurant in NY. Love love love! 

I will admit, the bill was higher than expected!! But you have to remember where you are at. You are at one of the finest resorts, on the strip, in Las Vegas! But that $120 steak, TASTED like a $120 steak. No regrets!!

Thrilled in watching him carefully selecting the freshest of seafood, vegetables, and meats.  Then masterfully chopping and mixing right before my eyes into fabulous and aromatic dishes!

I adored all of the dishes ordered: 1) Grilled Octopus: soft and lemony in opening up the palate; 2) Langoustine with Salsa Roja, Gun Powder: fabulously juicy with heated bites; 3) Rib-Eye Steak: tender and flavorful with yummy grilled whole garlic; and, 4) Chili Shrimp Cilantro Fried Rice: not to be missed,by far the best fried rice I've ever had!

My only real gripe about this place is the timing of food.. I understand the fun in teppanyaki, but do you really need to cook one thing at a time? I like eating veggies WITH my main, not for a dessert course... I almost wanted to go back there and start cooking myself.

We had Chef Bonafacio prepare our meal and he did a phenomenal job. You have to ask for him. No he didn't do back flips, crack corny jokes or catch onion rings on his head, but he took the time to make sure each dish we had was cooked to perfection. I loved watching him work because you can see the passion in his eyes as he prepared each dish. He made sure every detail was set to perfection. He also explained everything he did which I greatly appreciated. The concept of Tetsu was to provide the teppanyaki experience but focus more on the actual food as opposed to the show and I understood the concept from the start. It just seemed classier than your typical teppanyaki restaurant.

Every ingredient he used was right behind him and everything was fresh. I loved the open kitchen. We were served a variety of dishes from crab legs to wagyu steaks cooked and seasoned to perfection. The best way I can describe the food is delicious and clean. You can tell there weren't a lot of filler ingredients. Everything was of the highest quality.

The service was on point as well. We never had a dirty dish in front of us or an empty glass. The sommelier helped us choose some amazing wines.

But, the more important thing is the food. The portion was small and the food did not taste as if it was more high quality than any other teppanyaki places I have been to in Los Angeles. Overall, it was not worth the price. In addition, we waited at least 45 minutes before the teppanyaki started.

Second, it will be pricey, but the prices are not extreme.  Your meals are not huge, however if you order about 4 things from the menu, you should receive a good fill.  Please see the photos of the menu to gauge the prices.

For instance, the Brussels sprouts were just cooked in water and oil with some salt and pepper on the grill. Nothing extraordinary. The miso cod cooked from the kitchen was good but I've had better.

Tetsu is one of those restaurants that we always used to walk by, but never really thought to try.  We stay at the Aria frequently, so venturing off of the property for dinner is pretty common, but on a recent trip we tried Tetsu and were kicking ourselves afterwards for not trying it sooner.

Tetsu has a lively atmosphere, great service, and excellent food.  Prices were pretty normal, with the wine list being a little limited but there were some good values.  Sake menu was great, so be sure to try some if that's your thing.

The show here centers around the teppanyaki tables.  The chefs are all professional, but with personality, and you can taste how fresh all of the vegetables are, as well as whatever you choice of protein (be sure to try the shrimp & lobster if you are a seafood-grill person).   There is a sushi menu available if teppanyaki is not your thing, but even if you are going for the grill, the rolls are so good I recommend sharing one or two as an appetizer.

Overall, the food was great (not really too much to write about since it's a basic teppanyaki menu), and the service was on point...the only drawback was a limited wine list and way too many super-sugary cocktails on the signature drink list.  Everything sounded good, but so sweet!  More champagne and vodka-based cocktails, please!

4413819,2016-08-19,1,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"Not worth the time or the money. Fantastic service, high quality food, but wayyyyy too overpriced for the taste and size of it all. 

Eating at Tetsu means you can also order from the sushi menu (barMASA) from next door! We ordered the Seared Salmon with Avocado and the Uni Ebi roll. Both were fairly standard, nothing too amazing, which was quite the disappointment. 

At Tetsu, we ordered the seared scallops, rib-eye, lamb chops, sea bass, brussel sprouts, and the cilantro shrimp fried rice. 

[Appetizer]
Seared scallops - I am so biased because I love scallops in all forms! We ordered 3 orders to start off with, but because the chef thought the scallops were on the smaller side, they ended up giving us 5! They were deliciously seared, perfectly flavored, and a fantastic start to the meal!

[Entrees]
Rib-eye - delicious and tender, with just the right amount of fat! Really enjoyed the sauces that were given to complement the meat. Portion sizes were stingy though. 
Lamb chops - tasty, but nothing particularly memorable. Also underwhelming.
Sea Bass - I think the best of the 3 entrees. Fresh, smooth, and nicely seasoned.
All three were definitely solid dishes, but nothing that truly amazed me. 

[Sides]
Brussel sprouts - simple, grilled, and flavored lightly with lemon and salt and pepper. 
Cilantro shrimp fried rice - skimpy on the shrimp, but nicely satisfying with the rice, cilantro, and occasional peppers. We definitely needed the rice to keep us even remotely satiated. 

Overall, the waiters were great. The chef himself however was quite stoic, and not the usual teppanyaki personality you would expect to find. He made the meal feel somehow stern and overly formal. The food was simple, small in portion sizes, high quality, and taste-wise, not something particularly memorable.

100% not worth the price. Definitely do not recommend and definitely not coming back.",WMLrJpSqeQU9us9FTKJFew,5,1,2,NfRX83zKKTlqk45oBTgvPQ

Also the process of having the guy cook one item at a time was entertaining but not very efficient, especially since the plates were in the small side.  So I felt like there was a lot of sitting around.  The table side chef was very nice though.  the food i found overall to be good, but inconsistent.  the 5 of us ordered several dishes, which ranged from superb to okay to oh no.  The superb: lobster ceviche, spicy octopus, jalapeno calamari, chicken meatballs, maitake mushrooms with truffle butter, wagyu ribeye, sea bass.  The okay: daikon/apple/asparagus salad, wagyu fried rice, shrimp and vegetable dumplings.  The oh no: vegetable yakisoba.  The yakisoba was an extremely sweet flavor I've never seen in soba.  I couldnt' even eat it. 

One thing that was also off putting was the hostess who seated us.  At first she seated us at this one teppan counter where one of the chairs clearly was pulled from a different sized table.  The problem is that it was much lower than the table such that you couldn't really eat sitting in that chair.  When we brought this to her attention, she inquired about getting another chair, then came back and told us there were no other chairs available.  I waited for her to offer to move us to a different table, since the restaurant was very empty at this point.  But no, she just gave us this look like we were shit out of luck.  I had to insist that she move us.  At which point he kind of gave a bit of attitude.  finally one of the other hosts came over and moved us.

4453632,2013-05-23,0,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"First off, I MUST say, that if you are giving this place a bad review, you are ordering the wrong dishes! Of course don't go to a Teppan grill and expect the same steak amazement you'd get at a steak house. That is utterly ridiculous. What they DO do well is their more unique and specialized dishes :)

What I ate and I recommend are allllll of their vegetable sides, particularly the mushrooms! I made an entire meal out of them and ordered two more than my original request, and did so for about half the price of the entrees. They were delectable, unique and had the Vegas WOW factor. We also ordered the scallops for another bit of tastiness. My boyfriend had the lobster and throughly enjoyed it.

We chatted up our chef and he seemed a little embarrassed about his limited English, but he was hilarious, and then since we were being so friendly, the head chef came out and cooked for us for awhile and chatted us up. Even gave us two extra scallops!

Bottom line is: you can get a cheaper meal here if you order in a savvy way than you can at most of the other nice restaurants in Vegas. Furthermore, these guys are amazing, and it was a wonderful meal, but order what THEY do well, not what you'd expect from an americana style restaurant or steakhouse.

They have an ice bar behind the chef and everything on the menu is on display. The interesting fact of this restaurant is that all of their seafood is directly from Japan with the turnaround rate at 48hours. In Vegas, I believe that's the most fresh seafood you can get. 

The service is impeccable. When I went there with my friends, all 4 of us we literally have 2 servers standing right behind us. The food is the most amazing part. The chef cooks right in front of you and you can see exactly how you food is being picked,prepared and cooked. For appetizer, I highly recommend Caviar and Spicy Octopus.

I had to get the Wagyu rib-eye steak since it's a rare find to see Wagyu offered at a restaurant.  Also, the cost of Wagyu here is very reasonable relative to the prices in San Francisco.  

BIG bonus:  They ran out of the lobster I had ordered and I was upgraded to a blue lobster caught in Ireland!  That was super generous of the restaurant and really topped off my dinner experience.  By the way, I think the blue lobster is an off-menu item.

5095000,2013-06-17,13,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"An exclusive restaurant in a restaurant serving outstanding teppanyaki.

No knife juggling.  No onion volcano spewing fire.  No shrimp tails flying through the air.  This is about modern Japanese teppanyaki made with the freshest, highest quality, visually stunning ingredients.  No ""ugly"" produce; a perfectly formed, evenly colored eggplant, baby bok choy with no holes in the leaves, you get the idea.

To start, the spicy octopus is incredible.  Lightly grilled with slivered jalapeno peppers, sweet, spicy, tender.  Borrowing from the menu of barMasa, the otoro with osetra caviar, absolutely phenomenal, the salty, brininess of the caviar enhancing the fatty fish.

Australian wagyu for mains.  Two cuts (fillet or rib eye), both approaching A4 quality.  The fillet is well trimmed, the rib eye, less so,  If you like to savor the fat around the edge of your steak, this cut is for you.  Tender, juicy, cooked to temperature, served with a spicy cilantro verde that brightens and intensifies the sweetness of the beef and a spicy red chili and soy that brings out the savory, beefy flavor.

For sides, it's hard to pass the maitake with truffle butter.  An umame explosion that works well with the beef.

Finally, the wagyu fried rice (a filler) is different and over the top.  Black and red rice are combined to create a nuttier flavor.  Fat from the wagyu adds richness, onions sweetness. 

Service is excellent with two servers assisting a single table.  

The restaurant shares the same outstanding sake list as barMasa.  Vegas resort pricing.

While not up to the standards of Michelin rated teppanyaki restaurants of Tokyo, Tetsu delivers a solid, authentic experience at a far more reasonable price.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,24,20,4,jC7PvKPA7JkvA2dbf61zIQ

5407098,2012-08-13,1,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"$92 for a petite filet ala carte?  There are plenty of better choices at Aria and nearby.  Teppan style dining without the show.  Don't get me wrong, the food was decent (not great), BUT (and this is a big but) it sits among some of the greater restaurants in Las Vegas and just can't compete.  Yet the prices charged here are among the upper limit.  

Food:  We ordered steak and chicken (new place, give them something easy to do).  The chicken was breast meat, fatty and included the skin (which had to be removed if you wanted to avoid the fat).  The steak was decent but not great (a bit too much salty sauce, methinks). The two sauces were good.  The sides were fried rice (weird with a lot of unknown bits and too much oil) and limp asparagus spears the size of pipe cleaners.  

Service:  The service was very attentive.  There were several food servers, not just one.  We sat at one of the teppan tables.  The chef was nice, but just there to cook.  No flair, like you would get at one of the other teppan places nearby.  

Bottom line:  If you want great Japanese food, there are too many better choices to count nearby.  If you want a great steak, try Jean George's or better yet, Gordon Ramsay's at Paris.  $260 for two.",8zkKq1ePsgu1yvv2OK1nqA,3,1,2,QIKU-vNXJ7eSCRXM7olz1w

5800957,2015-11-17,33,HGitzBs7x_fUvdTtrTacXg,"A classy teppanyaki restaurant in the middle of the greenest hotel on The Strip!  Don't expect cheesy displays of unnecessary spatula clacking and Everclear volcanoes and flipping eggs onto hats and junk.  You're paying for a sophisticated dining experience with a heftier price tag.

Six of us dined at Tetsu at $700, including tax and tip.  It paid for some delicious cocktails, great appetizers, main courses, excellent service, and a charismatic chef cooking up delicious food.  I can only really talk about what I and one other had ordered and shared so wipe your hands on the oshibori and let's get into it.

For our appetizers, we chose The Uni Custard Half Shell with White Truffle ($48), Santa Barbara Prawns with Cajun Spice( $28), and a Whole Fried Quail ($18).  The uni was so buttery and the white truffles gave it a nice earthy taste.  I didn't want to share this.  Watching them brûlée the custard in front of us just made me drool.  It was creamy and rich and it was bliss!  As for the Santa Barbara Prawns with Cajun Spice, it was decent.  Good flavor, very sweet seafood taste, but getting the cajun spiced roe out of the little legs was a messy losing battle.  The Whole fried Quail was nothing special.  It had delicate seasoning but it was definitely lacking luster compared to the uni and prawns.  I would not recommend the quail.

For our entrees, we shared the 6oz. Ribeye ($96) and Duck Breast with Thyme Salt ($32).  The Ribeye was such a disappointment.  You already brace yourself for a tiny 6oz portion but at a $96 price tag, I was expecting some aged well-seasoned beef.  What I received broke my heart.  I enjoyed the garlic that accompanied the steak more than the actual steak.  They do give you three dipping sauces for you to use but I prefer to eat my steak without unnecessary sauces.  If it's a good steak, it will naturally have good flavor.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare though so at least there's that.  The Duck Breast with Thyme Salt delivered what the steak couldn't: Lots of flavor.  It was juicy, flavorful, and I was happy.

As a ""filling,"" we shared the Salmon & Ikura Fried Rice.  I liked it!  I originally didn't want to get any fillings because I can make my own fried rice but our waitress was persuasive.  I'm happy with our choice since I decided to forego getting sides in favor of three appetizers.  The rice had good flavor and I like the slight smoky taste of the rice.  It came at the end of the meal though so the carbs definitely made me have to fight off an impending food coma.  Everything was washed down with a $18 Cucumber Shiso Martini (Bacardi Limón Rum, Fresh Cucumber, Shiso Leaf, and Ginger).  Refreshing!

All in all, while there were hits and misses to our meals, I had an overall pleasant dinner with some amazing company.  The Uni Custard with White Truffle was the best bite of the night.  I wish I skipped the 6oz. Ribeye and got two orders of The Uni Custard Half Shell with White Truffle instead.  A decadent luxurious meal at Tetsu starts the night off right!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,44,36,4,pHgFWt6dAJZpuzvMrVssiA

Usually when people visit these kinds of places, they expect world class service and this was not world class at all.
The food was good.
The service was shitty.
The cocktail was too sweet, too thick, with too much fruit syrup and too little alcohol.",jmsQZ9YM4erppqjfwYxK_A,0,0,2,Cixdklnuo7o4RNWFLxp_Aw

The wine list was extensive.  If you would like to enjoy classy teppanyaki in a cozy environment with top-shelf ingredients, this is the place.",J90nBc4CPqsVLfggCaxTfw,0,0,5,mZ2foTJ_W4XE9p5Avz6ULw
