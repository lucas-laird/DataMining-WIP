To get to the point, we went there tonight and what a great experience. I ordered steak and unlimited shrimp, my wife ordered grilled chicken with unlimited shrimp, and of course we started with blooming onion. Every food item we got was perfectly cooked and timely served which is key to having a great dinner, from bread to steak we got a top quality dinner.
I must start with Jason our server, this guy is amazing, he knows what he is doing and it shows. This fine guy pleases his customers with his personality and he knows when to check on you and replenish your drinks and food (bread and shrimp).
I asked my wife to use her card to pay, when he returned the receipts to be signed, he wrote on our copy ""girls rule"", way to go Jason, keep up the great work. Outback, please make sure you are taking a notice of this review and try to fix your other locations, i.e. the one on the strip above casino royal.",rY2rxCHslXoR5Bvxd5PIDg,0,0,5,2jtNxvErfoJcdSF6qkC6vg
169422,2015-03-14,0,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"I came here last night around 930 with my boyfriend. Walked in behind 2 other people. We weren't greeted by either the hostess of the server walking by. They just stared. Then the host came back and silently sat the first two guests. When she came back she said ""you gotta let me clean a table"". Came back then sat us down. After 10 minutes we finally got greeted by our server. He brought us our drinks and we put in our appetizer. Another 5 minutes goes by and our server comes down the aisle then turns around so my boyfriend grabbed his attention. Asked us what we needed, which was to take our order then walked away. 
Dinner...
I ordered a med-rare filet and boyfriend ordered the med-rare sirloin and lobster combo. His meal was delicious other than steak being med-well. My filet came out extra rare. I love rare steaks but even I couldn't eat that. Unfortunately I had to send it back for a couple more minutes on the grill. My boyfriend was done eating when I got it back. It was now medium which I was at this point just happy to have the steak. Little to no flavor at all and extremely chewy. Thankfully I always get filled up with bread and of course bloomin' onions. The server never came back to check on us again. Literally. For the rest of our dinner. He was closing the store while my boyfriend had to stop the managers conversation with another employee to ask for our check. When she stopped mopping the floor the manager brought the check to who I figured was our server. Out comes another server. She gives our check. We put in the check book 20$ in cash and a debit card. Before we could explain our payment she returned, grabbed the book and went back to the kitchen. She comes again, dropping off our payment. I was charged the amount ($61.38) and our server kept $20 as his tip. Without ever returning. We told the female server what had happened and fixed the mistake. Of course my bank was charged, then repaid then charged again. So basically it was the worst service I ever got in a restaurant. Luckily the bloomin onions are amazing and will always keep me coming back. The strawberry sangria was also delicious. I am a server and so is my boyfriend so we know the struggle of being a server but this was ridiculous. He had only 2 tables total and the manager and all other employees only cared about getting off the clock.",CXkh7tAK51SYv6L1lqPu9A,1,0,2,oQ487QaECujcpxTeqyc80A

657316,2015-05-17,3,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"It's been a long time since I've been to an OBSH. Since my son and husband have never been, I decided this time we'd celebrate his birthday there. What a mistake that was! My one year old granddaughter was hungry and grumpy, so my D-I-L ended up leaving right after the appetizers were served to take her home. That left my husband, me, our son and other granddaughter for dinner. We had to get the attention of the waiter to finally take our order. 

My son also ordered an entrée for his wife to go, but I mentioned to make that later (which most restaurants would assume anyway). My husband and I both ordered the parmesan linguine with shrimp. We both agreed that it had an odd flavor and we wouldn't order it again. My son ordered the sirloin combo with coconut shrimp. He didn't receive his dinner at the same time the rest of us were served, his was about another 10-15 minute wait. They actually served the TO GO order when our dinners were served, which was bothersome because it was a salmon dish. The manager came out and apologized and gave him a card for a free bloomin onion on his next visit. The one we ordered, sitting on the table looks nothing like any of the ones depicted on the website. This one was fried darker and extremely greasy. 

In all the time he was waiting, my son's salad hadn't even been served, thus I called the waiter over to remind him of that. He apologized for it and brought it to the table. At this time, my son had put on his cell phone that it was his dad's birthday. The waiter acknowledged it - or so we thought. A couple of minutes after the salad was served, the manager came out with his meal. She had the nerve to serve burnt coconut shrimp. We were all so disappointed. And to top it off, no birthday acknowledgment for my hubby. They can keep their bloomin onion coupon.

811749,2014-11-18,3,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"Can someone please explain to me how this chain of ""restaurants"" is still in business?  I just don't get it.

Outback, for some reason I cannot fathom, is a favorite among many of my family members.  It is often chosen as the place to celebrate a birthday or some other special occasion, and each time it is, I dread the prospect of paying ridiculous prices for subpar food.

On this particular visit, there were multiple groups of people waiting for a table.  I pondered to myself, ""Why is this place so busy?"" After about 30 minutes, we were seated in a booth at the back of the place.  The waiter introduced himself, took our drink order, and scurried along.  A Bloomin' Onion was also ordered and we carried on our chatter as we anticipate the arrival of our deep fried tear-jerker.

Some time later, he came back to take our order, and the onion came shortly after.  Why this particular appetizer is so popular is beyond me.  It's looks greasy, it tastes greasy.  The plate it was served on looked greasy too, but that's just the damn thing sweating from its hot oil bath.  My daughter in law asked if we could get some of that infamous warm bread, to which the waiter replied, ""The bread is served with the salads.""  Really?  Is the kitchen going to spontaneously combust if the bread is served out of order?

Soon our salads arrived.  They're fresh, they're tasty.  Three of us ordered the same salad; a wedge.  Two were very nicely portioned.  The third was about half the size of the other two.  Mind boggling.

Salads are done, bread is gone.  Tick tock - tick tock - tick tock.  Here comes the ""food.""  I ordered the Alice Springs chicken.  For those who don't know, it's a chicken breast with bacon, mushrooms, cheese and some mustard sauce.  The waiter drops this plate in front of me and it's hardly recognizable as a cut of chicken.  It's drenched in grease, and the fries served with it are cold.  I cut into it, take a bite, and I am unsurprised by the lackluster flavor.  It tastes just as greasy as it looks, but I'm hungry and I absolutely refuse to send anything back to the kitchen - we've all seen ""Waiting.""

Dinner is complete, everyone at the table seems just as disappointed in their meal as I do.  I decide to share a desert with my grandson and order the chocolate thunder from under, or whatever it's called.  It takes 15 minutes to get it, and when we dug into it, we wished they'd kept it.  The brownie is dry and flavorless.  The ice cream has giant chunks of ice in it, like it had thawed and been refrozen.  My grandson knows no ""bad"" desert and delights in it.  I'm a chocolate freak - I DO know better, and I know that this dessert should never have been served like that.

There's only one person to blame for this mess, and that's the manager.  From forgotten requests to poorly prepared food, there just aren't enough chefs in this kitchen.",pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,3,2,1,Tq37NSyHrRz3BChg0PGWrw

Attached is a picture of my online confirmation email that shows I ordered mushrooms. Also attached is the 6 onions I received instead of mushrooms. Sure it doesn't seem like a big deal but it's the little things that matter. Last time I carried out they forgot to put a rib eye order in.

1567107,2013-11-15,0,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"We have eaten at Outback, this location many times. I have always had no problems with my meals (but I would usually order the Salad with crispy chicken.. can't rememberr the name at the moment). But my husband had a problem a couple months back with his steak. It was raw, I mean 'still mooing', raw. 

The other night, on our anniversary, we decided to go give it another try. We were seated promptly and had a wonderful waiter. He was so attentive and personable. We told him it was our anniversary and chose Outback to eat because I was craving a margarita.  We both ordered the special, 'Turf and Surf' but upgraded the meat to a filet. We discussed with outr waiter (Josh ?) that we wanted it pink inside, not raw, and he told us what we already knew: order it medium.  He said medium rare is RARE! Medium is pink inside and just a touch of grilling on the outside. A different server delivered our plates and I immediately saw that my filet was black. Shriveled and black. I cut it in half (not easy either)  and the inside was gray and tough. My husband's was the same. Our waiter happened to be at the booth behind me and asked how our food was. He looked at the plates at the same time as I said, 'This is NOT medium, this is burned!'  He apologized up and down and went to tell the manager and order us 2 more correctly cooked steaks. We ate the lobster tails becasue they were getting cold and pushed around our potatoes. Meanwhile, across the aisle from us and one booth back, the same thing was happening over there. The woman got her order which was incorrect, the manager came out eventually (after ours was served) and apologized and handed her the newly cooked meat. The customer  cut into it and it was wrong again. The manager came back to her once more and I saw the woman point at us (as she had seen what happened with our food.)
When our food did arrive,  it was pink but our centers were blood red. I did not want to re-order because it was getting late as it was and honetly, I was hungry. It was also served with fresh mashed potatoes, but our anniversary meal was kind of ruined.   I thought maybe after all that mess, we maybe could have gotten a free 'dessert'? (No!)
Something definitely was wrong with the kitchen that night. Either the cook was asleep at the grill or they have defective equipment, as in a 'timer'.

Never had a steakhouse steak that did not offer a blue cheese/ shallot sauce. But they did try to accommodate my request by dumping plain blue cheese on my steak. Very over powering. I had to scrape off the excess cheese.
 'loaded' mashed potatoes were bland. Lacked flavor and salt.
I was asked if i wanted an extra shot of tequila for my margarita for an additional dollar. I declined. Man, I was sorry I did. There appeared to be no tequila in my drink. My husband tasted it ( he does not like tequila) and said it tasted like plain lime juice. I told server and she said 'Oh, I am practicing.' I just was speechless and asked for a  real margarita. But by then I had almost finished my meal and decided it wasn't worth the wait.

2875584,2015-08-22,1,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"I'm going to give a description of the events that occurred at today's visit.. 

My mother and I walked In around 1pm we were instantly greeted by the hostess.. She seated us and gave us menus.. Her name is Jessica she was very professional and beautiful 

Our server wasn't around so my mother went to wash her hands.. When she came back I went.(just to give you an estimate of how much time elapsed before we met our initial server) the host walked by and seated another group of older Caucasian women (we are African American and I hate to bring up race because I like to believe that it isn't a factor in everyday situations) the server Nicole greeted the older ladies first and and took their drink order. Then stopped at our table my mom ordered ""two ice teas with white sugar only."" Those are her exact words because that's what she orders at every restaurant. So when she brought the drinks out she was serving 3 tables at once. She delivered our drinks second along with a side of the house pumpernickel bread.. She brought a tray of sweet and low  and equal and one tray with 4 white sugars in it with sweet and low and equal also in it. I went to ask for more white sugar and she walked away fast. Also the bread she served us was very hard. Imagine taking a bite out of a hockey puck. When she came back to take our orders (about 7 minutes later) I instantly felt rushed by her. My mom asked for more white sugar and then proceeded to order her steak and unlimited shrimp meal. I wanted the Cobb salad with grilled chicken. She asked me what kind of dressing I would like and I told her I didn't know then I asked what kind do you have. She said well what kind do I normally eat because they offer 14 different kinds and I told her I don't typically eat dressing could she list them. She seemed annoyed at this point and listed about 5 dressings at lightning speed. I asked if she had Italian dressing and she said ""no we have a honey mustard vinaigrette""my mom asked if I had anything lighter like a raspberry vinaigrette she again said ""honey mustard vinaigrette"".. Instead of finishing listing the dressings she said "" well do you just want a Cesar"" I replied no I am pregnant I'm not supposed to have that. She says ""well my friends were pregnant and they ate sushi and their kids came out fine"" my mouth dropped to the floor.. I said that's ok I'll just have a steak like my moms. We never mentioned anything about sushi. It felt like she was pressuring me to hurry up and make a decision. Her vibe and attitude was terrible towards us. She left to put in our order and came back 3 minutes later with a cup of white sugar and slammed it on the table then walked away. We watched how she spoke amongst other guests and it was definitely different. She was slower and more friendly with them. (Again I don't like to think it was because we were black but there were no other African Americans in the restaurant to compare our service to.) 

One of the managers came by her name was Krystal she asked was anything wrong and how she could fix the problem. My mom and I told her the situations that occurred and we mentioned that maybe Nicole is just having an off day. We are all women and I am in the service industry I totally understand when you're having a bad day. Maybe black people that come in the restaurant don't tip or maybe she is on her period my mom goes on trying to give her the benefit of the doubt before she throws her under the bus.. The manager sincerely apologized about her behavior and attitude towards us. She offered to give us a new server and new bread she also ensured that our food would come out fresh hot and clean.. 

She sent us a new server her name was Yulie. She was kind she came over with a smile and a nice conversation. She regularly checked on us and took very good care of us. She is the reason I even gave this place two stars. If we had her as our initial server we probably would have rated with 5 stars. She was efficient and accurate. She also made small jokes with my mom. She turned our experience around..

However Nicole never stopped by to apologize to us. She laughed and joked with all surrounding tables, which was fine with us, however, she would never learn from her actions because she was never held accountable for her behavior. All of her tables were surrounding ours and she wouldn't even look at us.. Overall she made our experience terrible. Nicole acted as if it was tough to serve black people. I was awed by the lack of respect shown to us as consumers. 

Because of Nicole, we will never return. And we will pass our experience along to the black community that they are not welcomed at that establishment.

3030514,2015-06-30,0,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"I have not written a review of a restaurant in over 4 years, this terrible experience has brought me out of retirement. Let's go through the timeline. 

We walked in to an almost empty restaurant with only about 4-5 tables seated. The hostess had been talking with someone at the bar and upon seeing my wife and I she shuffled back and without any emotion asked how many in our party and then led us to our table. She clearly enjoys her job, especially since she didn't crack a smile the whole time. 

Our waitress was pleasant enough. She took our orders and then commended us for trying to be ""good"" about our food selections (my wife has a yeast and dairy allergy, I'm not sure how ""good"" we were trying to be). That was a bit patronizing but engaging. She was really on top of making sure our waters were refilled. We both ordered sirloin steaks, medium rare.

When our food arrived, we both cut into our steaks to discover that my wife's was a solid rare to borderline raw, while mine was a slightly more cooked rare. Hers was cold in the middle, mine was at least warm. When the waitress came back we requested they be cooked to the temperature/cook we had ordered. She then proceeded to argue with me about if I knew what medium rare meant, and pulled out their menu to explain what each cook level means. She ultimately decided that my warm rare was less cooked than my wife's almost raw steak and the proceeded to take the steaks back so she could have them both cooked to medium well. Why medium well you ask? Good question... 

I am not a toddler, nor an imbecile. Apparently this steakhouse has a different understanding of how beef is cooked than the rest of the food industry. They apparently also have a policy that if the customer doesn't like how it is cooked, to argue with them and to convert their steak into borderline shoe leather. My steak came back practically well done; it was chewy and bland. My wife's came back medium and at least had some juices left in it. 

We will never frequent this pathetic steakhouse again. Stay away unless you want to be belittled for your choices and want shoe leather instead of steaks. You have been warned.",fCH61dJfLEkrSKumlJTEGA,2,0,1,t_QbvBzf_gueZ8oFTGG3hA

BUT, tonight my husband and myself decided to try the prime rib.  BIG mistake!  I ordered the 20 ounce, medium rare.  When it arrived it was so red, not pink, but red, that I thought they were kidding!  I happen to love rare meat, sort of a barbarian here, so I decided to give it a try.  It was so hard to cut with their big steak knives, and when I did get a piece cut and tried to chew it, it was so tough I didn't know whether to try and swallow, or spit it out!

My husband asked if I wanted to send it back to get it cooked further and I said what for, that is not going to help the strands of unchewable fat running through it.  Instead I boxed it up and brought it home for Jake - he could care how it's cooked or how tough it is, he's an Australian Shepherd who eats anything from spaghetti to pickles, so he loved this prime rib.  Unfortunately, I did not love it and will never order it again!  Sorry Outback Steakhouse, but you really goofed on this one!  P.S.

During multiple occasions, they say ""It seems like you need a few more minutes, I will be right back."" Maybe they were all trained to say that, but I personally like when servers recommend food and tell me what is the most popular at least.",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,3,2,3,lB5EXot03RvZm8LJwBH1rw
3890351,2013-12-24,0,IuSx68tb7iZa-aAeknXp8A,"I went here with my parents for a quick dinner on a Monday night. It seems to be a busy location and there were a number of people waiting at the  front for tables, but nevertheless they found us a table in no time, which was nice. 

We informed our waiter that we were in a bit of a hurry. I ordered the French Onion Soup. It should have been called Italian Onion Soup as the menu listed provolone as the cheese on top, but nevertheless is was delicious. I'm a big fan of F.O.S. Theirs wasn't exceptional, but fit the  bill with lots of gooey cheese and flavourful broth. 

Our steaks took a bit longer than we expected to come out. Our waiter had warned us against ordering medium rare, which is how I usually order. He gave us the spiel ""Rare is warm red throughout, medium rare is pink with a warm red center, etc."" I always thought med. rare was pink throughout, like a nice bright pink, with rare being more rubbery and almost raw. I had opted for the ribeye, medium rare despite his warning it might be too rare, while my parents each had a small sirloin. We all ordered mashed potatoes and veggies. 

The steaks came. Theirs were pretty decent, generally pink-looking, even though my mother ordered hers medium. Mine, well, it was well-done. Grey with a tinge of pink. Barely. Nicely seasoned, well-marbled flavourful ribeye, but totally overdone from what I specified. Like a previous reviewer, I was in a hurry, and hungry, and ate the whole steak anyway. However, we did at first say something to the waiter about the long wait, and the manager came with two 4$ lunch coupons, which was nice. Then our waiter came back a bit later and asked about the steaks and I showed him mine. He agreed that it was overdone. To his immense credit, he got the manager to return, who then comped the (rather expensive) rib-eye steak and apologized profusely. From other reviewers' experiences, I'm wondering if they might have problems with the cooking staff getting orders right. 

I find that unless I'm at a serious fine dining establishment, it's pretty hard to get a rare or medium rare steak. I've had staff say, ""That's how we do medium rare,"" when they bring out a well-done steak, and leave it at that. So to the credit of The Outback Steakhouse, they at least acknowledged their mistake. I give them three stars because generally I think the food is pretty good, and I know  my folks really like it here and have had many meals they enjoyed. At present, I wouldn't recommend them as a place to get a steak prepared exactly to your specifications. And thanks to our sever for being such a good sport.",20uTDQPo7BD0IJPR64t1SQ,0,0,3,kN4ybfNROxWHIhrmEJmgWw

Service here although not rude, fairly friendly actually but slower than turtles and not accurate order takers either. I have been to this location several times, including during construction and they were sorry for that inconvenience, but that was least of the inconveniences. If a server takes your order and brings the order to you when it is painfully obvious it is not correct, it is the servers fault... not the cooks, they cook did not bring the improper meal to me, and if they do not care about accuracy then do not expect a decent tip. NOBODY likes for a person in your party to not have the food in front of them while everybody does...then what?  either everyone waits politely until the order is fixed while the food cools off right in front of you OR rudely and awkwardly eat your while the one person watches everyone else. Atleast with this option the person without food has the floor to talk and not be interrupted which is ok, but what if this person happens to be on of the types with a grating annoying voice who is spouting glibly uninteresting annoying drivel??

The food here is average at best, and I have never seen a place that cooks steaks that does not know what the definition of medium is. Not Bloody not dry is pretty simple to me. The garlic shrimp is dry more often than not and not only do I not know why I keep ordering it, I do not know why I keep coming here (Actually I do but family likes it so that part is not Outbacks fault). If I was a real man I would tell my family off until they pick someplace good, but that is problematic because the other go to joint for them is Olive Garden which I can not stand. So in Closing, I very mediocre meal from time to time helps ground us so we could appreciate a really good meal when we have the chance to have one.",9x8o-z3LQ2mIk0X9sQOTZQ,3,4,2,UVKxwigtfFF3uJhlvdzHxQ

The waiting area was crowded...and it was a weeknight?  Ugh!  Waiting around for a table on weeknight when you have kids in tow is not fun.

So while we waited...or rather so I can put up with the wait, my husband walked over to the bar to order a cocktail.  Luckily the bartender mixed up a fabulous ""House"" Margarita on the rocks. Then we waited...and waited...and waited...for our table. So when we saw the hostess looking for ""someone"" we finally asked, ""Did you call our name yet?""  And they said, ""Yes, just a minute ago.""...Well, guess what? Our pager was not working. I have to say the greeter at the door was very friendly and apologetic for the wait but I was a bit annoyed.

Our waitress seemed a bit tired and not overly enthusiastic to be there, but she was pleasant.  I'm sure it had been a long night.  I overheard another waitress apologize to her table for the food taking too long.  I thought, ""Oh no!  Not good!"" How am I going to continue to keep these kids busy?

So the nice thing is that there are kids activity menus and crayons..and our iphones to keep them from complaining (the cocktail was to keep me from complaining).  We ordered and it took a while for the drinks and bread to come out.  However, the food did not take too long.

Portions are a bit small-but very tasty.  Macaroni and cheese fabulous, steak cooked to perfection, pork medallions very yummy, new Asian salmon very good, grilled shrimp small but tasty and kids meals which included a grilled cheese for my picky eater all good and kids steak medallions.  Kids loved the complimentary warm mini loaf of bread.  The waitress was nice enough to offer more if we wanted...of course the Peanut Gallery in unison said, ""More please!""  We had a few kid leftovers but without the appetizer we had lots room to finish our meals.

I think for the value and taste it's not bad but the wait was just too long for a weeknight family outing, next time I'll just go to Chili's.",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,9,6,3,dI6Z_chp-lHLyznXBqgV2A

We were seated immediately. Within 2 minutes our server was at the table taking drink orders. She brought out drinks ASAP and then took our order. Our entire order. We ordered 1 appetizer and our main courses all at once. 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. Another 20 for our main course. At this point, it was 9:35pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm. When our server finally brought out meal I asked to speak to the manager. Jennifer can over to our table. All I had to say was ""50 minutes"". The place was dead. There was no reason for our order to have taken FIFTY MINUTES!! But Jennifer was awesome. She comped our entire meal. It's refreshing when a manger sees that her team dropped the ball and made no excuses. Thank you. Jennifer is a keeper. The food was good. Good enough to to warrant a return trip. I got the flat iron steak and shrimp. The steak was grilled to perfection. The shrimp was a little overdone. The salad that came with the meal was non-descript. Iceberg lettuce with some tomatoes, cucumber, and shredded cheese with the dressing kind of dumped in the middle. Hubby got the French dip. Meh. Nothing to write home about on that one.

I had ordered a grilled chicken breast with veggies and it was all great until I started eating my veggies. It was gross to say the least.

I was finished with my chicken, but didn't eat the veggies. It was kinda disappointing when my plate is passed along to at least 2 people who didn't notice something was wrong.

It's the cooks job to double check the plate and then it's 100% the waitresses job to make sure that your food is legit before it's brought to you. In my opinion failure to do so on the waitresses end leads me to believe that someone isn't paying close attention to their job duties... who knows.

I understand people make mistakes, but this incident just makes me not want to try this place ever again. For those of you who would come back after eating hairy food you'd be glad to know that the manager apologized and took my meal off the bill, which was decent of them to do.

I had the Large Cobb Salad. It was okay, nothing spectacular, but not bad. Everything was fresh and crispy just like a salad should be. Ranch dressing wasn't very good, I would suggest trying a different salad dressing.

    Our waiter was really nice but you could tell he was busy and running around a lot. Took some time to get our drinks and the bread was only served with a teeny tiny amount of butter... so small it barely covered half the loaf!

We LOVED the mac n cheese bites, but the issue with them was that the girl had accidentally dropped them before they were delivered, which is fine, accidents happen. But it took awhile to get them replaced, we even asked our waiter about them and he had no idea and had to go check on them. But, hey, they were worth it because they were tasty.

    For our entrees we ordered two 6 oz filet mignons ($22.99 each) with asparagus, mashed potatoes and two macaroni and cheeses, and an order of a 12 oz prime rib ($22.99) with loaded mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad. They arrived but they had forgot one of the macaroni and cheeses and the loaded mashed potatoes (they came regular) and both of these were an extra $1.00 each to order. But that was an easy fix and they were pretty quick with getting them to us. The steaks were super yummy but, a a tad pricey for the sizes. The sides were good, all expect for the salad because the dressing did taste a little off and the macaroni and cheese is super dry, not creamy at all (not worth the extra dollar).

    Overall, it was a pretty okay experience. The employees were very polite and tried to do the best they could with being so busy. The only reason I'm leaning more toward a three than a four is because there were a bunch of long wait times (They might have been understaffed?) and the mistakes on the orders. Other than that, we'd come back again.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,1,3,UXb9i-nUV_kEtOLAon0rmQ

I ordered a pitcher of Sangria b/c the price was much better than a single glass. The picture does NOT match the size of the pitcher that you receive. It was more like a small carafe. 

We got to our table and ordered our food. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. We waited for over 30 minutes before we had to ask the manager, Abbie, whether they had forgotten our appetizer. Our appetizer was spinach dip - doesn't take long to make. When we asked the manager, she apologized, and efficiently got our appetizer out from the kitchen. Then we took a bite of the spinach dip and almost choked on the amount of salt that was on the tortilla chips. We couldn't finish it because the chips were so salty. We didn't want to complain again, so we simply waited of our main dish.

We waited, and waited, ..... (you see where this is going, right?)

Eventually, our food came to our table and the main dish I chose was their steak special. I have to say, the steak was cooked properly, which was a great sign. The broccoli on the side, however, was also doused with salt. I wasn't able to finish the broccoli either. My date ordered the bacon cheeseburger (I know, at a steak restaurant, what the heck?!) and he said it was also really delicious. The fries that came with it, however, looked like the scrap fries that get left behind in the fryer. Even the manager noticed when she came back to check on us and she demanded that we get more fries from the kitchen.

By the time we finished and paid our bill we had been there for nearly 2 hours. That's just 2 people eating dinner - 2 hours! Way too long for me.

I give 1 star for the wait time, but I give 1 more star for the manager because she made an effort to keep us from never returning and she recognized our wait time and the lackluster food without us having to prompt her - aside from the first time. We may be back to give it another go, but if it weren't for Abbie, it would have been out of the question.",NYDvprxYyDm1dJj8g_G0RA,2,0,2,hzfHTxyn89dOf7wf0Jq37w

That is why I am giving three stars to this Outback property. As much as a franchised brand like Outback is an assurance of quality consistency, I could swear I have experienced tastier examples of the same menu items at other Outbacks. Tonight I ordered the Ribeye steak and it was very bland, lacking the usual spicy blend seared into the meat that I have had at other Outbacks. On the plus side, I have been to this location 4 times and the staff are way above average in friendly, competent, prompt an appropriate service! Really, the people working here are closer to a 5 star than a 4... Now, if the kitchen could just prepare meals that were more line Aussie Outback and less like high school cafeteria in flavor and appearance!",LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA,1,0,3,gabqJOISamjaaxl_t1BA4w

Ok, I used to be the biggest Outback fan and would have given them 5 stars all day long but something that was special about Outback in general has faded. You used to get good steak for a reasonable if not a cheap price. It was extraordinary but now just ordinary. The first one that opened near me I went to 3 times the first week cause it was so reasonably priced. I'm all for a franchise staying in business and prices will always increase but most meals are $10 to $15 bucks more, portion sizes seem smaller and all the add ons can really drive up the cost in a hurry. I'll still go to Outback as it is still pretty good but mainly cause my girlfriend loves it.",m-I2uTU5Y1sQIaZ5l8yytQ,1,1,3,ugr6NkKlQPELYD3c6nYsMQ

Tried calling over to the store and could not get a hold of anyone. Had to leave. Horrible customer service. Could not even get food. Will never go to this location again.

When we did get our entrees they brought me a rib eye when I specifically ordered a 12oz prime rib!!  When we ordered he didn't even ask how I wanted my prime rib and so I had to get his attention before our meal was brought and tell him. That's partly my fault though. 
We were seated near the door and with the traffic coming in and out we were cold. And our food got cold really fast for this same reason. I'm hoping we were just unlucky and got an inept waiter. I did let him know how displeased I was in the tip I left him.",79Ea49GrBLDPQMewNGtSlw,0,0,4,2ZmFqiN3XEDkxAXUlElg-A

We both got the ribeye melt lunch combo, but it only comes with one side- soup/salad/potatoe/ or veggie. I think it would be better to have a side plus soup or salad. But alas I ordered another side along with soup. The ribeye melt was absolutely delicious :) highly recommend. Our server was Tony, he was a very nice guy with some humour mixed in.

group of 4 ordered about 80 something bill 

Prime rib was my order along with salad and apps. 

Prime rib done really nicely - not alot of hard gristle or nice cut of meat for price. I was actually impressed that everything was coursed out from the beginning of the meal towards the end of the meal. 

Our waitress was really amazing -- keeping up with re fills I counted at least 3 times while being bombarded with a 9 top that just finished a group of 7 plus few other randoms. 

Overall it was a great experience. All our meats where cooked to right temps and left very happy as well as the front door being open to us when we where leaving bye the host  obiv leaving a great impression with that.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,0,1,4,-d9BS_ZfbBZS6f8Oas-1GA

Anything we needed took 10 minutes no matter how easy it was. We called for the manager twice, he really could care less.
