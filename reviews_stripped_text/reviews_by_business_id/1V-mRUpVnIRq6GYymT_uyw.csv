The day it opened I went I had a wonderful experience, friendly service good portions,good food! I couldn't be happier with my first experience. I went again, it was good. Hoping to make this a regular spot for me  the next time I had a bad experience. I had friendly service but was over charged and the portion size decreased and I felt like i got ripped off. No meat no veggies, I wasnt going to go back. My roommate wanted to go , I said  I'd go in. They asked me if i I wanted anything after she started to order. I said no , She said ok may i ask why ? I told her the experience i had and Tia was her name , she insisted on buying me lunch to right the wrong that had happened. Then to top off her excellent service the manager Chris came over apologized and added in the most amazing dessert  ""coconut bark"" . MMMMMMM. I dont write reviews often but, they blew me away with how quick they were willing to right the wrong. With a smile to top that off.

Corn salsa looked like it had been out for days and the Guacamole was brown. Very disappointing since you could tell this place had potential. Pork was good, beef was ok. Smaller pieces tasted much better as the bigger they were the harder it was to chew. Pineapple salsa is pretty good. We both mixed up our bowls before tasting the rice so we couldn't eat more than a few bites of each. Both meals Ended up in the trash. Seems like food sits out for awhile so freshness could be a concern. Guys behind the counter didn't even seem concerned about the condition of some of the bins, raw rice, two pieces (yes two pieces) of brunt veggies and brown guac, oh and the tiny bit of wilted brown cilantro left.

1570976,2015-10-12,0,1V-mRUpVnIRq6GYymT_uyw,"The pig was legit! This place is like a Hawaiian Chipotle, where you walk in and create a salad/burrito/bowl from an assembly line of delicious ingredients. I made a salad bowl with pig (I like that their menu refers to pork specifically as pig), chicken, lettuce, grilled veggies, hot salsa, and habaneros. My buddy also got chips and guac, which I shared with him.

The pig was a bit more salty than I expected, but it was really good. I like salty food, so no biggie for me. The chicken was good; not extraordinary but not bad at all. A solid showing on the chicken. The grilled veggies were grilled veggies; I wish places would give me more onion and less green bell pepper -- Chipotle has the same problem, all peppers -- but also no biggie. Veggies were cooked alright and tasted fine. Habaneros were hot. I've had some that were not quite as hot as you would expect a habanero to be, but these were not like that. I took a bite with a bunch of habanero on it and I paid the price for the rest of the meal.

The chips and guac were pretty good! I have this thing about cilantro being disgusting and I hate it, but the guac didn't have an overpowering cilantro taste like some places can. The chips were great.

So it sounds like I have a bunch of above-average things to say, why only 3 stars? Food quality. Look, Braddah's, I know I didn't come here for health food. And I know I should have certain expectations about fast food, but you don't have to rub it in my face. I looked at the kitchen area and saw a bunch of huge oil jugs. ""Sesame flavored oil"" -- flavored? What? You're not using sesame oil? No! Lucky for me I have 20/15 eyesight so I can read the ingredients list: Soybean oil, sesame oil. Okay great, so you want the sesame flavor because your island-style food is made with it, but you also want to make more money by using the cheapest, lowest quality oil possible (soybean) and then adding flavor to it so nobody knows. 

EXCEPT I KNOW. And now everybody that reads my review will know. So even though I liked the food well enough, and the pig and chips/guac were great, I can never get higher than 3 stars for a place that just so blatantly feeds me low quality junk. Which also makes me wonder: everything else I'm eating, what's the quality of it? I can only assume it is also poor.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,0,3,vSWlwkNgzLkH3680VzH-3A

Anyhow, onto the food.  

IF it is your first time, let them know that it is your first time, they will give you little bites of the meat so that you can taste before you buy!  Good deal huh?

I normally hate chicken and will not eat it anywhere else unless it is deep fried. . .BUT here the chicken is sooooo freaking good!  Juicy with just the right amount of char to give that extra kick of flavor.  I have had it on a salad, burrito and nachos. . .and they have all been delicious!  I've liked the chicken so much from the beginning that I have not wanted to eat any other meat there. . .so my reccomendation is to get the chicken!  =D

1889529,2015-09-08,0,1V-mRUpVnIRq6GYymT_uyw,"I travel to Hawaii often and was glad to see a Hawaiian food themed place open up close to me after reading about it the the Las Vegas Sun magazine. I've been twice and both times have had the tacos. Pork, Chicken and beef I have tried. Unfortuantly my stomach has been upset after each visit within 30 minutes. I wondered if it was a certain sauce I tried the first time, but the same thing happened after the second visit with different sauce and ingredients. My first visit there were 2 young employees (guys) in uniform hats and shirts hanging around the register on the customer side, but were not interacting with customers and seemed bothered when one customer asked a question. Manager was there also behind the counter and on the floor and was pleasant when I spoke to her. 
My second visit was saturday night 8pm on Sept 5th and there was only 1 employee (a young girl) working by herself. I saw a cook at one time, but the young girl was doing everything by herself and there was a line of 6 people to order. She was very polite when it was my turn to order and assisted me and offered a sample if I wanted one of the steak. I was disappointed that the homemade ranch dressing was not in stock, but I then opted for the non spicy salsa.",86Z8-q5IpUybkquCBG1XHg,0,0,2,HVJxACNnD8jPSJhhO4McdA
2008182,2015-07-24,23,1V-mRUpVnIRq6GYymT_uyw,"NEW OBSESSION ALERT! Braddah's Island Style blew me away! I had been reading the reviews of the other locations and Braddah's was definitely on my radar, but I never had a chance to make it in.

I happened to be in the area and saw that a new location was opening somewhat near me and I felt like that lady in the annoying Mervyn's commercial back in the day... OPEN! OPEN! OPEN! So I kept checking back to see when it was going to open and low and behold, today I saw that it was and IT WAS ONNNNN!!!!!

So I just tried their amazing food and I'm hooked! It was sooo good! It's fast casual style, a lot like Chipotle with the bowls, burritos, tacos or salads but with a way better vibe and food. The menu is a lot more creative with higher quality ingredients. Like seriously though. Soo OVER Chipotle. I had already been saying that anyway because their meat is so nasty. Tons of gristle. I'll never eat there again but thankfully I have an alternative. And a healthy alternative at that. 

So here's how it works:

Step 1 - Choose One - Burrito, Bowl, Salad, Tacos or Nachos

Step 2 - Choose One - Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, Grilled Veggies

Step 3 - Choose Any - Seaweed Rice or Brown Rice, Black Beans, Grilled Veggies ($1.25)

Step 4 - Choose Any - Charred Pineapple Verde (Mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (Medium), Tomato with Grilled Maui Onions (Hot), Guacamole (Upcharge), Sour Cream, Cheese, Bean Sprouts, Lettuce, Purple Cabbage, Cilantro, Chopped Jalapeños or Habaneros

They also had some side sauces to choose from: Mango Habanero, Raspberry Jalapeño and Kiwi Jalapeño.

I had the Steak Bowl (pictured) and in mine I got: Pulehu Steak, Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Charred Pineapple Verde, Cheese, Jalapeños, Habanero, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts with Mango Habanero sauce. Highly recommend. I ate every last grain of rice.

They gave me a sample of their soon to be world famous Coconut Bark because I was a newb and WOW that stuff is fantastic! That salted caramel and chocolate with the coconut just melted in my mouth. It's won awards and I can see why.

I am so happy! I'm going to be like their best regular now. I wish this place was closer to me though. That's the only thing that sucks. But it's close enough. I'm going to make the trek because it's worth it!

Do yourself a favor and try the food here. It is soooooo friggin good, I can't even tell you.

At 7pm on a regular Monday night, this place was just deserted. I think it was the location. There is only one other restaurant there in that plaza which was a Japanese place and even they do not look like there were getting a lot of business too. 

We walked in and were greeted warmly by everyone in store. They asked if it was our first time there and we said ""Yes."" They gave us a sample of each of their meats and recommended which sauce goes well with what. So we got two things: Huli Huli Chicken bowl with brown rice and a Pulehu Steak Burrito with the seaweed rice. 

Flavor wise, I loved it! Only concern - The food was actually pretty cold even though they prepared it in front of us. Maybe the meat was left out for too long? Given that they do not get as much business, the meat was a tad bit cold so I was disappointed about that. This has a potential to be really good but it just did not have that served hot and fresh factor that should come in all sit down places anyway. Even Subway offers to heat up your food, right? I do have to remember, however, that it is a fast food place.

So overall, I'd say meh. I would still give it three stars because of how nice the staffs were.  They even gave us free coconut bark for desserts.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,5,2,3,8i9ERuTaOqquZVMat-2APA

It has a chipotle-like ordering style where you pick everything you want in and on your food. 
I got the three fish tacos to go with the hottest salsa available, black beans, cheese, cabbage, and fresh jalapeños. 
When I got home I thought they looked nice but when I bit into them it was so underwhelming. The salsa wasn't even hot, the fish was dry and bland. The black beans were good but that's about it. Seriously the fish was so dry I couldn't even bite through it. 
If you're looking for a decent fish taco avoid this place.

UPDATE: so I complained to them via Twitter about their meal and instead of acknowledging the terrible meal I had, THEY BLOCKED ME! So I will literally never be back to this poorly run establishment, not that I was going to anyway.

BEWARE
My daughter ordered Huli Huli
Chicken tacos and found a BIG chicken bone in her food.
Waited for other patrons to leave before I said anything.
No sorry no concern no nothing!
Luckily my daughter didn't choke on the 2"" chicken bone.
Asked who was responsible for cutting up
Chicken - they need to be more careful !
All FIVE employees - said absolutely nothing.

I'm taking my money elsewhere where they care.



Well it's unfortunate that someone's safety and well being has to be taught to your ""young leadership""! As well as their common sense and courtesy to at least acknowledge the issue; then show concern for your patron and at minimum an apology regarding the situation. 

NOT ONE of your staff whom varied in age offered an apology which leaves your patrons ""the perception that there is no concern regardless of how long they have been in leadership"".
Obviously they learned from you as your lack of sincerity comes through your response.",5ArMzPUBncPqDrB7PmZBCg,8,0,1,yuDA7PT97S6JLwWcK7lALg

Got a flyer in the mail about Braddah's and since I was wanting to try a place I'd never been to before, I decided to try them out with a to go order. Decor is tidy and clean, and the staff was friendly.

Now, even though this place is LIKE a Chipotle, you have to remember that Hawaiian food is not like Mexican food, and so you have to build your bowl a little differently. I, however, did not make that distinction initially and paid the price by ending up with a bowl of very random tastes which did not entirely play nice together. Cheese and Kalua Pig do not mix! And guac doesn't particularly work with the salsa I chose either.

I had one big complaint, and that was the container used for my bowl. I'm not a stickler for how my food is presented, but a change is needed here. My ""bowl"" was a clear rectangular plastic container. The server, bless her heart, crammed, and I mean CRAMMED, this cube as full of food as she could. The sight of all the food just smashed in there was just unappetizing! Then, when I got home, all the guac stuck to the lid with the cheese and lettuce as well. Ick. Hopefully the dine in bowls are better, but the to go bowls need to be more like Chipotle or Zabas.

Food quality was good, however, and I'd say most of my negatives were actually my fault for not asking for the right combination of ingredients. I'll definitely give them another try, as the chicken looked delicious.",qSXebesQe7_awsDyFH0baQ,0,0,3,XoLBi7afp4E0IYRabx07Iw

I had two tacos- one with pulehu steak and kalua pig.  I've never been too fond of kalua pig, but it was actually really good here with awesome texture. 

The coconut bark was mind-blowing, that I went back and bought a box several times within the following weak. It's dangerous, and to be frank, I ate so much of it that I'm now currently a bit tired of eating it. But it doesn't change the fact that it is a-maaaaaaazing.  

I'll DEFINITELY be back for more of that pulehu Steak, and the lava chips (blue corn tortilla chips) are SO good, that I bet the nachos are legit, too.

FOOD:
The chicken and pulled pork are very flavorful. I've never tried the brown rice because the seaweed rice is absolutely delicious and compliments the meats. My go-to is usually the bowl - seaweed rice, cabbage, meat, corn salsa, tomato salsa, and jalapeño. The tacos are a good choice too. If you've haven't already, try the coconut bark. It's pretty tasty but I stay away from sweets usually!

QUALITY:
Overall, I think the quality of the food is fresh for the most part but I have noticed some gristly chicken pieces and old corn in the corn salsa. Just throw out the old stuff!!!!

PRICE:
$ - my bowl cost about $7.50. They have an affordable lunch special for $5.00. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The servers are usually friendly. I went in when I lost my voice one time and the server was very understanding in that moment.

On the other hand because I got to choose it wasn't very good. And the worst part is there is no hot sauce to put on the tacos. They have mild medium and hot options but it's more of a relish than a sauce and I need sauce. Especially since this is cafe rio style and the meat can get dry and you have rice that starches it up... Other than the music and atmosphere nothing seemed Hawaiian. Hawaiian flavors are distinct and if you're going for Hawaiian food that's what you want. So... I might go back might not.

We came for lunch during the week and it was completely empty at 12:30 in the afternoon. Only one other couple came in while we were dining in. 

I ordered a chicken salad and my husband got a pork burrito. The meats were the only thing I had that actually had salt on it, and a little too much at that. 

You can get romain or cabbage on your salad and I decided to mix the two for a little more texture and I am so glad that I did because almost everything else was over cooked and soggy. 

It's your basic diy: salad, bowl, burrito & nachos with some very similar toppings that you would see at chipotle only with a Hawaiian twist. 

I got fajita veggies: under seasoned &  incredibly soft and oily. 

The corn salsa: under seasoned, and the corn was overcooked and chewy. 

The pico: under seasoned & did not taste fresh. 

The salsas were all under seasoned. I tried them all and went back because after I started eating my salad I realized it needed some heat and I thought I had asked for the spicy salsa. I went and asked for a side of their spicy salsa and brought it back and realized that I already had it on my salad but it didn't have much heat to it. 

The girls working were so nice and they offered us some samples of their meat but they were out of beef so we were only able to try the chicken and pork. 

I think this place could be excellent if they got their seasoning down and cooking time on the veggies right. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case at this time.

Located on the corner of Tenaya and Warm Springs, end cap of the retail space facing Warm Springs. The place is clean and friendly as you walk in and are greeted with Aloha! and the sound of Hawaiian music. 
There are several tables and bar table top settings however this location is not too big in size. There is an outside area set up for seating, however, every time I have been here there was not tables outside. 

The ordering style is basically a walk up to the counter and start at one side and work your way down the other as the employees prepare your tacos, burrito, nachos, or salads. Basically similar to any subway or cafe rio type system. 

The are quick to ask for extras and tell you any up-charges for certain items. 
I have had tacos; one steak, one pork, one chicken and also have had two burritos, one pork and one chicken since the times I have been here and all were great and of course made with the toppings and rice, salsa, etc, that I chose. 

I also love the Coconut Bark! its certainly a sweet so if that is not your taste than be ready because goodness of sugar, chocolate and coconut is coming at you. 

There is also a self service drink system with refills while your dinning in.

Again, I personally like this Hawaiian Food and find it better than a few other places in Vegas and of course the employees all have a great Hawaiian Spirit.
