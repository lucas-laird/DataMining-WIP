2890942,2018-02-23,0,Yk23uco9_lru4frmDe8Krg,"So first off, me and my husband purchased carne asada nachos. We gave our 1 year old son some guacamole because he loves guacamole. It was the only thing we all ate that day, and very soon after eating we ALL feel nauseous and eventually we're all puking. My son had to go to the emergency room because he's so young, him puking was getting him dehydrated and is dangerous at his age. We all couldn't even keep water down. We spent a week in the hospital monitoring my one year old son because whoever made our food came to work sick with a virus or didn't store or handle food properly. So we finally leave the hospital with a doctors note (and our robertos receipt) for my son being sick from their food. Not only did i have to go through all of that but the employee STILL GAVE ME A HARD TIME Getting my refund back ! The employees name is BEATRIZ HERNANDEZ. Shes the rudest employee there and had NO empathy or compassion for What we just went through. She said Our doctors note wasn't specific enough for her. She refused to give me my refund, So i had to go get another doctors note. I came back and she STILL gave me a hard time ! They told me on the phone before i ever came to the store that i needed to talk to corrina. Both times i went they said corrina would be there but She WASN'T there either time. It seems like the beatriz lady was lieing because i told her im not leaving until she calls corrina on the phone so i can speak to her in order to get my refund back. Then after arguing for so long , all of a sudden i could finally get my refund back. I still never spoke to corrina. Just beatriz. Beatriz went to the back room alone to take pictures of my sons papers from the doctors and then said she had to keep my robertos receipt. That employee caused me to never want robertos ever again. You guys lost a good Customer and lots of money because my family and friends also loved robertos. But not anymore after i told everyone what happened. This is not acceptable and was very unprofessional of them. I talked to corporate. I will also be calling the health department on this location. NEVER go here..Unless you want to get sick AND have rude employees give you a hard time about something that was THEIR fault.

Why ?
I've had to ask a worker to please not mop the floor with bleach while I'm  eating at table. You'd  think that would be common sense but I guess not. I hate to be an asshat but I just dont find clorox appetizing.
On a recent visit,  I ordered 5 rolled tacos with everything.  Usually pretty dang good for a quick lunch -- well these rolled tacos had a noticeably fishy odor and taste to them so I'm assuming they were deep fried in oil used for fish,  instead of dropped in his ( the cooks ) gf 's panties.

My issues is when I informed the cashier (Rick at 4:07am) that my order was incorrect, instead of filling out my correct order, he charged me additionally for the chips with guacamole with the two incorrect burritos.

The restaurant wasn't busy, so the food came out fairly fast, but their was a little bit of food on the ground and the bathroom was a mess.  They probably run a thin crowd at night, but somebody trashed it and it wasn't cleaned by the time I got there.

It is a solid place to eat late, but if you are coming down here during the day time, you can do a LOT better",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,0,2,qpjy_lvDANvwhwancQx0KA

5210194,2015-10-28,1,Yk23uco9_lru4frmDe8Krg,The amount of garlic this cook put in my food was ridiculous. Paid extra for things I have never been charged for in the past. I am so disappointed. If your cook doesn't want or know how to make something simply tell me when I order; don't make the food inedible.,2U8uo4y_fQm1_6LA0b6ahA,5,0,1,BM3vHwbtyPlj-LiD_EgmOQ

The girl at the front counter does not greet you and she looks and acts like your bothering her. I ordered $100 worth of breakfast burritos for my staff, but next time it won't be here. Many of other options with a much friendlier staff. No one here says hello or thank you. 

I see all the same reviews, but I guess it falls on deaf ears. What a shame.",DgxzftNcQaObBMEa4-7qYA,1,0,1,qzpfUOb963_zrBS00amGrg
