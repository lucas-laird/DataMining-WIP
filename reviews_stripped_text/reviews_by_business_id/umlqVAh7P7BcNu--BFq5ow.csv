Drive thru was wide open and the teen who took my order was very very nice & friendly & helpful. I never eat at Macca's and the Happy Meal comes with so many options now. He picked up on it & walked me through it. For $4.22 I was happy with my cheeseburger double fries & small coke. 

The teen girl who gave me my food was just as polite & nice as the boy was. She complimented my old manicure & polish & wished me a great evening. 

All she forgot was the napkin. 

My fries & cheeseburger were old...I was starved and didn't care. Maybe it was bc those 2 employees were genuinely nice & friendly??",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,1,4,MYNRaWburHW4-t_Jlm_Fmg
1079551,2014-09-23,0,umlqVAh7P7BcNu--BFq5ow,Finally a playland that doesn't make me cringe at the thought of my kids playing in it. Although it is very small. Perfect for the mid-day play time with the younger kids but I couldn't see more than 4 small children playing in it at the same time. Another perk- tall ceilings. If you have a small child you know that at least once per visit you will find yourself climbing through worm holes to find your screaming toddler. Not this one! I was able to stand upright and walk all the way to the top of the tallest tower to rescue my prince in distress!! All around I think it's a great playland.

For the most part..you can find this at any McD's, and this location is no exception.

As previously stated, I rolled into the split drive-thru and ordered up a jalape√±o burger combo.  Nice enough on the squawk box.  Rolled in and paid.  Bounced to the instructed window and found a very nice worker.  Out I went on to Cheyenne.

This location is a model of efficiency.  Short was the time between purchase and consumption.  Long were the tears as I hated myself while I devoured the meal heading west into the sunset.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,5,4,azZi1B4GFsLXT0-fb5PSLA

Well,  my husband just  drove over for an order in this extensive heat, and get gets back home, and one of the sirloin burgers we ordered  had a bun, lettuce, onion and cheese. NO BURGER PATTY! So he leaves all the other food here at home and now has to make another return trip -to return the screw up. Then when my husband (who has been there twice now), gets home-  he gets to eat food cold French fries and a cold sirloin burger (he had left the other part of the order home when we discovered the missing hamburger patty.)  Nice. McDonald's....... at  least have your employees check the food, before wrapping it up.  Sheesh!",frfYajFX8MCNzOgKQ1yKrw,0,0,2,AKmCZ_o5YxgWOHO8cknpFQ

I live around the corner from here I use to love coming since it's by home. I went tonight with my husband the staff on 3-09-18 around 9:40pm the rudest very rude. My husband went to the drive thru with our child ordering 6 apple pies with large fries and lady rudely said okay you want more ? And he said no and she asked to proceed to the window and we got there she said we only have 2 apple pies can we give you the strawberry or cherry instead. I understand that's fine if you don't have any more but it's your job to check because asking costumer to proceed to the window I said nvm thank you I'll just take my money back lady said she wasn't able to do that, that she had to charge me she said let me ask my manager? Um why would you have to ask your manager to give me my money back. Manager proceeds to the window to tell me they have to charge me for my fries I said no I don't want it, it's not our fault that they didn't let my husband and I know before heading to the window and I was very nice about it and manager got annoyed and told the other employee to just give my husband his money back that it LOOKS LIKE HE NEEDS IT.!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! What kind of thing is that to say seriously! I have never experienced something so horrible as that. This is not the first bad experience I've got many at your location why I tell my family friends and others to not come to this McDonald's. I'm absolutely done coming to this location. I rather drive to a further location than deal with you untrained unprofessionally employees. You really need to fix this as a huge corporation this is a problem. I usually don't ever like to whine and make reviews because I've worked the restaurant/ fast food industry I understand the stress and being tired but it's no excuse to act this way.",2EdlIPuWFafY1bADv4618A,0,0,1,rLZ2veAuwEzjexeL54CgZg

This is the ONLY Mcdonald's in this part of town and always struggles during the morning and even the afternoon shifts to get the lines to move. Gave this a 2 star because their customer service is good but service is SLOW.,2_PIEEOrqF59TO7W1ijD9g,1,0,2,YXuQTmNVuLmhN1XVIKbUwg

As we were driving down to my meeting on Cheyenne Rd. from summerlin, I was craving some hashbrowns. 

Our cashier in the drive thru was sweet but she sounded a bit tired I DONT BLAME HER! She got our order & paid at the first window w/ her but as we drove up... there were 2 windows for pick-up... DOOD way too early to make us think that hard hahha but she flagged us to the right window when we drove up too far. =]

HASHBROWNS - $1.09  it had the perfect texture of crispness 

SAUSAGE EGG MCGRIDDLE - can't complain it was like every MCGRIDDLE that we get.

FRIED CHICKEN BISCUIT - had to get this because it was something we tried when it first came out on menu & it was freaken BOMB DOT COM!! But I was disappointed as for this time (maybe only this location?) The chicken was flat small piece & not so crispy batter as if it was just microwaved =[  but the biscuit was ON POINT.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,4,1,3,LGOuNu6AsB77nZJdvGZNVg

The bait and switch has returned to the arches. The pick 2 is now five dollars on items that I don't want. These guys again try to slip this to us hoping we won't notice.
Burger King, right next door had a nice two items for 3 bucks. The fries were better and there was more of them.",l7Ytk_LW_wzXjkxe5kkLFQ,1,0,1,PfTG111WQoHuBFaYDdLbcw

Grabbed some food on my way home from a 16 hour day. Got home and we had been shorted my daughter's Big Mac. I tried calling twice and there was no answer. So I drove back.

No questions asked, no attitude, just professionalism!! 
They made me a fresh order and apologized and put a smile on my daughter's face!!
