Quick review:
Smores crepe was super sweet. If you love the overloaded chocolate flavor then this is for you. Unfortunately, that isn't us so we ate half and had to toss the rest. 

Strawberry crepe has mascarpone cheese and I felt tgier was more of that than strawberries so a little too heavy for me. 

Plain nutella crepe was good. But how can you really mess that up. 

Service was good our cashier was friendly and the crepe maker was quick and fun to watch.

They are more on the expensive side compared to some other crepe places but they are in a hotel on the strip so I guess that makes sense.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,3,2,3,P0JGCiJIvG5DrcQnR6rDGQ

Date of visit: 06-23-2018 (Saturday) 
Time of visit: 12:00 noon

I was excited to visit this place because I heard reviews about it before arriving to New York, New York Resort and Casino. The crepes were delicious; however the staff was very unprofessional and unenthused about being there. The staff had very rude responses and remarks criticizing customers in plain view of other customers.

I find this type of behavior not only inappropriate but very unbecoming of a novelty restaurant that caters to 90% tourists. This lack of customer service and professionalism is not a very good impression on tourists providing this is a very busy resort.

Incident referenced: a customer whom has already purchased some food, comes back to the counter to ask about condiments. The female representative at the time cooking, scoffs, and replies in a rude manner, ""No, we don't have that"", then she proceeds to chat to another employee (older gentlemen) in the front area about how ""ridiculous"" the customers request was and they continue to laugh and carry on criticizing the customer asking about condiments as if the customer should know better. 

In addition the front cooking area exposed to customers was extremely messy and not very appetizing. It was just plain dirty. (see picture attached) 

I'm appalled by this behavior and quite frankly individuals like these have no business in the hospitality industry; if you don't like customers that are providing your salary and keeping you gainfully employed maybe you should find a different job that doesn't deal with customer interaction.

We were staying at New York-New York, so in the morning (or around noon, to be honest) when it was finally time to eat something, this was a quick enough option.  They have breakfast crepes, so it gave me the breakfast I wanted without much hassle. I had the egg and bacon crepe for my first two trips.  I also had a sweet crepe with Nutella on my third (and final) trip here.

You order at the counter, then wait for them to call your name.  It is a little bit pricey for a crepe, but I think most restaurants in hotels are overpriced. The staff was nice and friendly.  On the first day (Saturday morning), there were quite a few people waiting for crepes, but it still only took about 15 minutes, which was fair to me.  The crepe wasn't totally the best thing ever, but it was good!!!  It was large and full of food, so it was more than enough and kept me full for quite some time.

48th and Crepe doesn't have it's own seating area, but there are tables scattered throughout the area it is in.

I also appreciated their service on my last visit there, because they had accidentally added strawberries to my banana and Nutella crepe.  (My friend had ordered her's with strawberries, which was an upcharge.)  Opposed to throwing it out and starting over, charging me, or just not acknowledging it, they informed me they had put strawberries on it and asked if I still wanted that or another. (I love strawberries, so of course I happily took it.)  I appreciated that and the fact that the crepes hit the spot every day I spent in Vegas!",Efo7y431RD5WsD3oArttMg,1,1,4,MI9PJgnLvHj4gojob0VcAA

They have the huge crepe griddles and spread the batter on with little wooden squeegees. Which you get to watch through the glass.

A good option if you are looking for something casual and you have some time to wait but don't have the patience for a full sit down meal. I went on a saturday morning, and the pick up line was waaaay longer than the order line. I probably waited about 1-2 mins to place an order and then 15-20mins for my crepe. Not too bad, but could be frustrating if you were in a rush to get to a show.

What I tried:
Vegetarian crepe- lots of sauteed veggies and cheese in a pesto sauce. Could have used more sauce and got progressively less good as it cooled.

Steak with cheese and bechamel- like unto a philly cheese steak but in a crepe. It was delicious. Order this one and you will be very happy :)",LUWbVukgLd7hGvQ3la4pgg,0,1,3,6s1gQtwyIp5Jp8mz3LvZmw

My girlfriend and I were in the mood for something sweet right after seeing Zumanity at New York New York in Las Vegas.

The Plot:
We shared a Chocolate Banana Crepe, a Cappuccino, and an Espresso. 

The Scene:
The portion size was very good and plenty for the two of us.
The crepe itself was very yummy, filled with Nutella and sliced banana, and topped with more Nutella, chopped hazelnuts, powered sugar, and whipped cream.
The Cappuccino was also good and a nice accompaniment to the crepe.

The Rest of the Story:
This is not the place to order Espresso.

Epilogue:
We were both pleased as well as satisfied and this was the perfect way to conclude our night out together.

Of course, they also have breakfast/dessert crepes. My girlfriend's mom ordered a Nutella crepe and said it was way too sweet. I didn't try any, but that's because I much prefer savory over sweet for breakfast... or anytime, really.

In conclusion, 48th and Crepe may not be the biggest place but their menu is pretty good. You can have breakfast with the sweet side of the menu or the breakfast selection or lunch and dinner with the savory selection. I really enjoyed this place and would definitely encourage people who are either staying at the New York New York Hotel or in Las Vegas to check it out.",8ueiUseUi2qrXYeQVIy4gw,4,2,3,Z-CvNfmlBGd7u6z6DUauCA

This place apparently shares a storefront with the hot dog joint, and for 3 days I went to their sister hot dog place and the lazy woman - even when I asked her to not put the mustard on top of the sauerkraut - put the mustard on top of the sauerkraut.  Out of sheer laziness.  The crepes are good.  The shared-door hot dog place is bad, and they staff it with this one enormously slow lady who ignores your requests so the sauerkraut falls off our dogs with the mustard on top when we ask her not to.  Really sad the managment wouldn't see people just leave the place when the line is too long to get a hot dog.",fpNH1CqgDxavVh6Q73eA0A,0,0,1,9l1QBQlwJvW9Hy2fVizizA

I ordered the healthy omelet with egg whites. I guess I should have gone with a more sweet option than savory. The line was pretty long, wasn't sure if the cashier was just taking a while to ring people up or the actual crepe making themselves were the hold up. 

The crepe chef was amazing and fun to watch while she spread the mix onto the hot plate. 

I would try it but, not my fav. The crepe place in Paris is by far the best.",Fj18oVJp9v_DTJ8rGty1Vw,1,0,3,YCCAD-90UN-jT317PP37dg

We split a nutella/banana crepe (they are fairly large and are shareable).   I had hyped this place up to my guest, telling them they were going to have amazing crepes, etc. etc.  Totally a letdown.  The crepe itself was nothing special, didn't seem particularly great texture or soft,  - just boring.   The nutella filling basically tasted like overly sweet chocolate.  I felt it had way too much chocolate filling, so it seemed like every bite was a mouthful of gloppy chocolate and not enough crepe. (and the nutella flavor was very lacking, if you are nutella fan).  We were both somewhat overloaded with chocolate to the point that we felt like we needed something else to cope with all  the sweet.  yuck.   If people think that's what  a crepe is supposed to be , then I guess they haven't had very many crepes in their life. A tender fluffy crepe,  balanced with  delicacy, subtle flavors - that's what makes a  great crepe (and crepe filling.) 

Maybe they have other crepes here that are better, but we were totally unimpressed and won't be back. ( we would have been very unhappy if we'd each had our own, at $10 each.  At least we split it and saved our wallets a little).",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,0,0,2,0Hz5vEHe5P0WpM06E4tTfg

Peach cobbler crepe: $8.99 (bottom)

One crepe is definitely enough to feed two to three people. The crepes are pretty big in size, rich in taste, and sweet. There is homemade whipped cream added on top and lots of filling. 

If you haven't had a crepe before, I recommend the chocolate banana crepe. The peach cobbler crepe might be seasonal. The peaches used taste like canned peaches, so they aren't as ""fresh"" as some of the other crepes available. 

This place is located inside New York New York hotel where all of the other little restaurants are located. Perfect place if you have a sweet tooth, but there are also savory crepes available.",fiBa3Y5v5TKhNWrqF-VMTA,0,2,4,A_4pfK1vQ-2c4eKi6pHjAQ

The waffle was very plain. I asked for my whipped cream on the side and got a small ice cream scoop of it. She sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. Butter, sugar-free syrup, and utensils were self-serve.

I don't know if it was the egg whites, but even with grilled veggies it needed salt and pepper to give it some real flavor. And ketchup. No salt or pepper nearby though - we had to hunt for it.
