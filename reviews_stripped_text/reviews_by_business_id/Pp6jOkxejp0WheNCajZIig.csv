I was very impressed!  I ordered the Surf and Turf which is a steak and grilled shrimp.  The steak was excellent for a steakhouse, let alone a hotel.  Really tender, cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  The shrimp was great too and seasoned very well.  Even the veggies were great.  I had this meal twice and both time the chef came out of the kitchen to ask if I enjoyed my meal!   I was there for 7 days and didn't eat there until my 4th day there.  Considering the meals I had at some of the local restaurants, I wish I had ate there the first night I arrived.",u4BHxiH2fBlH6bRJxDl8Xw,0,1,4,TqjUwFsCtC4Qfbze1FPBLQ

What I appreciated about Amy this morning was ZERO argument about my asks. They're pretty simple yet asking outside what's printed on the menu can sometimes spark too much conversation when I haven't had coffee yet! I ordered a 3-egg omelette (the menu says 2 eggs) with jalape√±os (not listed), spinach, and other veggies with a side of avocado  (not listed!) 

It's the little things in life! 

Thanks Amy for the great service! I'll be back!

On top of that there was an old piece of fruit instead of chips, and a cookie that was as hard as a rock and tasted like it was a left over from a previous day. If you have a business meeting here, DON'T ORDER THEIR LUNCH!!!",sUYMIwl-Zv5tOxZrQ8Iu9g,1,0,1,KlTvan3oLp8cPITIBgvjRA
