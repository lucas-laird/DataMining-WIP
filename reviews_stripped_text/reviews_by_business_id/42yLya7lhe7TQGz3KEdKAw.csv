My friend asked her if the chicken on the spicy chicken plate was breaded and she didn't know what we were talking about. The rice isn't sticky, it's hard, macaroni salad is bland, it's literally just Asian food trying to be Hawaiian. Ross J's is still #1 in town along with Aloha Specialties.

I was looking at the menu and inquired about the ""garlic chicken"" that was listed and how it was prepared.  The person behind the counter stated it was fried chicken and cooked in their garlic sauce.  They even added ""its really good"".  I understand everyone has different opinions but when i got home to eat this was far from good.  it was fried chicken pieces which is fine but it looks like they just put some Thai sweet chili sauce over it and called it a day.  They didn't even try to mix it up, it was literally just sauced poured over the chicken pieces.  I've been off yelp for a while but this was sooo bad I felt I had to write a review.  Maybe their other items are great but DO NOT get the garlic chicken unless you really like the Thai style sweet chili sauce.

I'm afraid I will not be giving this place another chance.  Too many other good spots around!",OIvNpfJyF9mXoKcDSOocMA,1,0,2,L78iSFR_EGEUgao4lei8NA

I had the loco moco (two beef patties covered in gravy, with two eggs on top of a bed of rice. I always order it with over easy eggs, but they were almost cooked all the way through, so no yolky goodness for me. And they were a bit stingy on the gravy. The next time I ordered a 1/2 & 1/2 (Chicken Katsu and Kalua Pork), the chicken was perfect (crisp and GBD) the sauce was a nice balance of sweet and savory, but the Kalua pork was kind of dry.

1700745,2014-09-08,3,42yLya7lhe7TQGz3KEdKAw,"#1 Hawaiian Barbecue. That's the name of this place.  I read on their website they opened a 2nd location on my side of town a few weeks ago. So while we were shopping in the area, we decided to check it out even though we already ate. 

It's located in front of the Ross store in the shopping center near the airport. On the corner of Eastern and Oquendo. You can see the ""grand opening"" flags from Eastern.

Fast casual place. Order and pay up front and seat yourself. The dining area sign says max capacity 50. There were about 2 other families dining in and I felt it was already cramped. The tables are too close together. Barely any walking space in between.  Cant imagine 50 persons in there. Place is clean though.

They serve the traditional favorites like bbq shortribs, kalua pork plate lunches with 2 scoop rice and 1 scoop mac salad. I thought it was cool I can skip the carbs and in place they include eggs. Great for those who want to boost their protein intake.
 
Taste wise though it's between 'meh' and alright. It's missing a bit of the local 808 flavor and vibe for me.

The bbq shortribs I had wasn't the best quality. Then again the price was right for what I got. Judging by the Styrofoam boxes that I just threw out when I cleared out the fridge, safe to say that even my haole honey didn't think much of his Portuguese saugage and fried rice.  He has that dish all the time at other Hawaiian restaurants and  he cleans his plate. 

The Taro smoothie was not too bad and the malasada I tried was okay. It's affordable though. It's just that I've had much better food at other places near me. 

Staff is nice but there was just a bit of a language barrier and ordering was a tad difficult. 

The family that owns this place just opened a new Chinese restaurant next door though. Maybe I'll give that place a shot the next time I ever in the area. Cool points for having delivery service! Im just  not in no rush though for the dine in part.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,3,3,2,J6Gx0umOgGJu1TyD6JgX2g
1808584,2015-09-24,6,42yLya7lhe7TQGz3KEdKAw,"Calling yourself #1 at anything just invites judgement, and makes the disappointment of dismal product even worse. I ordered a bento box to try several meats (pork, ribs, mahi) for a quick takeout lunch. Food took longer than expected to come out, and when I opened the box back at my desk, it was the wrong order. I had an overwhelming portion of chicken katsu. The chicken itself was fine, slightly dry but nicely crispy, tasty katsu sauce. But the mac salad was drowning in mayo, the rice was mushy, and oh yeah- it's totally not what I ordered. Didn't finish the portion, tossed the leftovers.

Yes, similar to L&L, but a lot better.  You know how I judge, by the cooks. Lol...sorry, truth to it.  You get some quality tasting meals from Chinese cooks.  My hubs is my personal Chinese cook, Lol.

I like that they allow you to substitute items, so instead of the mahi mahi I decided on bbq short ribs and chicken katsu.

Their plates come with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. I really enjoyed the chicken katsu and fried shrimp. The rice is really good and I am not normally a fan of white rice however when you mix the macaroni salad and the katsu sauce in, it was tasty!

The bbq short ribs left a lot to be desired as one was completely inedible as it was all tough grizzle, the other one was good.

The meal is generous and for 8.95 you can't go wrong. I think we will do lunch here again, I will just refrain from the bbq short ribs and try a different choice.

The macaroni salad is not so good stand alone, however mixed in with everything else it is ok.

We popped in on a Sunday and as always, I started my order with the Spam Musubi. It hardly had any sauce, the rice mushy, and the seaweed was tough to bite through. I ate it there while I waited for them to package up the rest of my food. My roommate was with me so we waited together. We got all kinds of things. Lumpia, which was more like an egg roll and so greasy that it was nearly impossible to eat, chicken katsu plate which lacked any flavor and their pork which I will say was the highlight.

Thankfully my roommate and I were waiting together because they also mixed our orders up and packaged some of mine into his, which they caught before we left but wouldn't have had we not been.

All that being said, I have had better, but I wouldn't completely count them out. They are trying and if I'm over that way again, I might swing in and give them another shot.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,18,12,2,yDCZSAbEEhb-KtjbPsi3Tw
