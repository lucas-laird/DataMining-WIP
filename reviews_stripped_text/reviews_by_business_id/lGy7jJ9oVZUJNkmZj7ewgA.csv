Firstly we were seated right in the path of traffic when there were 20 or more tables empty.  We asked and were seated in a table of our choosing.

Another bad omen was that our food came out too quickly,a true sign that something had been cooked ahead.  I am an avid Ahi tuna eater and was glad to see it on the menu.  My wife ordered a chicken and pasta dish and I ordered the pasta.  The chicken in my wife's dish was tough and overcooked as if it had been sitting for a while.  My tuna was cold on the inside like they had just taken it out of the fridge and was not seared on a very hot stove.

The food was mediocre at best. Out of the 5 of us, no one was impressed. In fact one of us didn't even touch the chicken to their chicken & waffles. I ordered the corned beef hash and I don't know what happened. Maybe being close to the casino, they figure everyone is drunk and looking for greesy food, or maybe the cook accidentally spilled the oil on my plate but I could tip my plate and watch the oil run off. I ended up eating enough so that I wasn't starving and left the rest. 

The service was horrible. We were constantly out of water. Our waiters switched over shortly after sitting down and I think the new guy forgot about us. Once we ordered, it seemed like forever that we got our food but the worst was paying. We gave the waiter our money/cards and he took off for 25 minutes! We watched him service other tables while we waited to get our change or in my case, my credit card back. I'm sorry but I'm not comfortable with the fact that my credit card was sitting God knows where for that long. Needless to say, I've been vigilantly checking my account every day just to make sure.

It's all kinda gimmickry wrapped in cliche, deep fried and heavily salted, but sometimes when you're in Vegas, that's exactly what you're looking for.

Go here for the meal before you go to a really nice restaurant - just to reset your taste buds to average ;) Oh, and this place rocks when you are drunk - there's nothing better than breakfast-diner food when you are five drinks in and trying to recover.",cY_N4Z6rOST_kub8g7zQhQ,2,1,3,3AAlHkbVPQdO7U-hy8bP5g

I had the potstickers and they were tasty. Perfect crisp on them, light flavor. They came with a traditional soy sauce type dipping sauce and a spicy sort of duck sauce. I liked that best. 

My husband had a buffalo chicken sandwich. It was quite large on a really tasty looking bun. He enjoyed the sandwich. The hot sauce had just the right kick to it. The blue cheese crumbles added a flavorful touch to the sandwich. It came with fries that were fried and crispy to perfection. We dipped a few in my duck sauce and they went really well together.

352435,2010-12-30,0,lGy7jJ9oVZUJNkmZj7ewgA,"This review is long over due as it is a place I regularly eat at during my trips to Vegas.  Now don't get me wrong, it isn't because I love this restaurant but more because I always happen to stay at Planet Hollywood (which I have a separate review for, dont even get me started on that) and it is the only 24 diner.

Food:
This is PH's version of Cheescake Factory.  They have a ridiculously large menu with everything on it from various cuisines.  Most recently, I tried the Kobe Beef Sliders which are about what you expect for sliders.  They aren't terrible but nothing spectacular.  My bf ordered the meatloaf which was pretty tasty.  This dish came in very generous portions, 2 large piece of meatloaf and large ice cream scoop of mash potatoes with gravy drizzled all over it.

A friend of mine order the Chicken Parmesan and that plate seems like it was meant to feed a family of 4.  There is a heap of pasta with a giant piece of chicken that had double side batter.

We also had potato wedges, which were giant sized and tasted pretty good, very greasy- yum.

Bottom line, I would say this is up to par with Cheesecake, about average.

Service:
Absolutely horrible. Consistently. Every time I come here.  The food seriously takes forever to come out and they rarely get the order right.  Somehow, at least one persons order gets messed up or don't even come at all- which is what happened in the most recent trip.  My friend's entree didn't come at all until we pointed it out and by the time they brought it out, everyone else was done.  We said to just cancel it cuz there was no point and there response was a simple ""ok""- no apologies, nothing.

Basically, when you come here to eat, be prepared to be here for at least 1.5 hour for a party of 4 of fewer.  If more than that, prob 2 hours.

Price:
Very pricey, especially for the quality. That is, unless you are ok with paying $18 for mediocre pad thai.  Not that I would come here to order pad thai but that's just an example of their ridiculous prices.",GyYInrWOVwPEqECKOC9T3g,0,0,2,KdY09vIBqyFxhAbDT_CjyA

We came in famished and buzzed around 12 AM.  Lousy 6 hour drive to vegas thanks to traffic.

Our server appeared kinda slow.  At first I thought he was stoned because he spoke slowly and incoherently but he was okay for the most part...just a little slow with the check/he didn't stop by our table very often.  

Food.  We started off with the buffalo wings, which I thought were okay.  Some were a bit small.

I asked for the Hawaiian rib eye, and he said they were out.  in fact they were out of all steak except for the filet mignion.  wtf?  i like my steak w/ a bit of chew, and yea i know rib eye is a bit soft too, but i was tempted by the hawaiian part.  instead i opted for the Jamaican jerk pork chops.  very large side of steamed vegetables.  baked potato (hard to mess that up).  pork chops said they were marinated, but sure as hell didn't taste like it.  more like the grill with a bit of spices sprinkled on.  still it was cooked well, and wasn't dry.  two small but fat pieces of chops.
i thought it was mediocre food at a high price (20 bucks for the chops).  it'd be better to go some place else, but i was staying here, and that was the only place open at the time.  

but i was buzzed and hungry so i ate it all up.  their fries were good.
had the 10% off coupon i got when i checked in.

On a recent trip to Vegas, we were a little hungover and a lot hungry for something to eat. After wandering around we just decided to head back to our own hotel and eat there. 

What a mistake! It was just after 12:00 and on Saturday and Sunday, the breakfast stops at 12:00. They have some breakfast 'specials' available on the regular menu, but it was things like omelets with french fries. I just wanted an egg sandwich or something very simple, but no....

My husband ordered a dinner salad, which arrived without any dressing.  It took over five minutes to get a little container with about two tablespoons of dressing.  The server did come back a few minutes later with a cream pitcher holding a quarter cup or so of dressing.

I ordered a Kobe burger with cheese, plain, telling the server I would put ketchup and mustard on it myself.  He therefore knew I would need these things.  Burger delivered with not one condiment, and none were on the table.  Apparently the place is too frou frou to provide mustard and ketchup in their bottles.  After flagging down the server, I got my condiments in the same tiny containers that were used for the salad dressing.  By now it's been close to ten minutes.  My burger isn't particularly hot, and the fries are well on the way to stone cold by the time the condiments arrive.

I had also ordered a thick chocolate shake without whipped cream.  I specified thick.  The server could have explained that the shakes there weren't thick.  He should have.  It was essentially frothy chocolate milk.  All of the syrup was sticking to the sides of the glass.  To demonstrate that it wasn't thick, and to mix it up, I talked to him for a couple of minutes while stirring it with my butter knife.  I complained that it wasn't thick, nor was it mixed.  He explained that the whipped cream would have covered that up.  Unless the glass is dunked in whipped cream, it would have been perfectly obvious that it was not mixed.  The chocolate milk tasted ok, but it wasn't the chocolate shake I ordered.

I also asked for napkins to use while eating the burger.  It was large and juicy, and the napkins at our table were linen.  The napkins didn't come, and I was about ready to use the linen dinner napkin when he delivered napkins - cocktail napkins.  For a 10-oz. burger.  For those who don't know the difference, cocktail napkins are those little coaster size napkins that sit under your beverage.  They were pretty insufficient when used as a dinner napkin, unless you ordered sliders.  

This was apparently the only napkins the restaurant had, as a couple nearby had sliders, requested napkins, and got a fistful of cocktail napkins as well.  

The burger was fairly good after I finally got some mustard.  The fries were okay when hot, but once cold, they were unappealing.  That's usually the case with fries.

We declined dessert.   Nothing had arrived as ordered yet, and we were tired of making experiments.  I had mixed my milkshake with a butter knife, eaten my hamburger with cocktail napkins, and my husband had gotten his salad without any dressing.",m6oS7Ad9_Wd4RrU8VtVNMQ,0,0,2,PrwiZ3RpiAje9B1tUabKyQ

The portions are pretty small though and it's kind of expensive. So if you're super hungry, I wouldn't recommend this place. I ate lobster alfredo and it was pretty good (maybe b/c it came out to be half price!).

aside from that, the food was affordable and decent. a couple of our friends commented on how big the portions were for its price, and decided to only eat half and save the rest for breakfast. me, i wiped my steak dish clean just because i was hungry... but i've had better, and cheaper for a bigger chunk. but then again, it's vegas!",3kPOK-VhFmLWHhKlXromjg,1,1,3,6bZf3ALCvSV_SwKcij4Nkg

It was really buttery and creamy and omg, with the syrup.. forkfuls of sweet goodness. Definitely a nice way to end a long night. 

The second time here was the morning right before our flight home. I ordered the eggs benedict and since we were crunched for time, I finished one and some fries really quick. It was okay, not the best eggs benedict I've ever had, but it was decent and satisfied my hungry stomach.

The blue cheese salad dressing tastes like miracle whip and the bacon is questionable. YUCK!  I added some pepper to give it some flavor and the somewhat helped.  Needless to say I won't be finishing this salad. Hopefully the burger and fries will be good.  We'll see.....

The hubby ordered fried chicken, mashed potatoes and veggies.  His potatoes are good and the chicken is okay.  It looks kinda weird because they split and pounded the breasts into a strange shape.  It has decent seasonings.

It's my fault, I forgot to tell my server no pickles.  I took a bite to try it out after I removed the pickle but it's no good.  My server graciously took it back and is getting me a new one.  I feel bad for wasting food and her time but I'm hungry and can't eat a burger covered in pickle juice.  It's 2:55 and my fries haven't arrived.  Hopefully they'll arrive with the new burger.

Fries arrived at 3:00, no burger.  The fries are fresh and yummy.  They are skinny fries covered in some sort of batter.

Late late night eats for late night drinks..

Bare in mind that I've been here a few times during my trip but I think the last time I was there was a highlight.  

Keeping that in mind... 

Despite what my drunken, irritable, and anxious fellow compatriots felt about this place.. I liked it. Not a place I would go out of my way to get to, but if it's an elevator ride... and a drunken crawl away then hell yes! Blanking out the unsavory pre-late late dinner conversation I found that  the ambiance was typical kitchy Vegas with an unusual mix of culinary fare... between congee, chicken and waffles, and really good orange juice.. it wasn't half bad. It would actually have rated higher if not for the typically slow service one can find @ 4am. My bbq duck noodle soup was pretty damn good. The broth wasn't over seasoned and the noodles, though not what I had wanted because I can't differentiate between egg noodles and vermicelli, were just right. Wish I knew how to eat duck off the bone though but it being such a late late hour my eating etiquette was no where to be found. 

Many antics later I told everyone to leave money and for them to go to sleep while I waited to take care of the bill. The things that apparently I missed if I had only left with them is probably a short lived regret... considering the driver's license that was lost. In that time that I waited to pay for our time there.. i was able to find some solace in the whirlwind that is Vegas. 

And then I drank. 
Again.

I also always get their lemongrass soup, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup. Their food is decent and they always have deals going on like breakfast specials, all you can eat pancake specials, happy hours, etc. throughout various times on certain days. Their specials are actually really good deals because it is a lot cheaper. For example, they had a breakfast special when we went on a Friday morning. The breakfast special ended at 11am that day and the steak and eggs was only about $6.99. 

However, the service here is terrible! The waiters take  long time to acknowledge you have just been seated. When you have already placed your order, it takes forever for food to come to the table. I've been here when the restaurant was full and when the restaurant was empty. The wait for our food took just as long when it was empty.

We had 45 minutes before the show, and the waitress did an excellent job with the rush service, although that might be because the place was empty on a Saturday night.

Cue in Planet Dailies located inside Planet Hollywood.   We both eyed the $9.99 AYCE Pasta special.   Winner winner, not a chicken dinner!

We were greeted by our server Joey.   His mannerisms and voice reminded D of one of his favorite characters from Big Bang Theory - Sheldon.   So from this point forward, our server shall be coined SheldonJ.

We immediately placed our orders for the AYCE Pasta special.    SheldonJ explained the choices available...linguine, penne, or spaghetti for the pastas & meat sauce, garlic, and I believe a polonaise sauce.     I wound up ordering one of each pasta and tried all the sauces except for polonaise.

They were extremely busy which was reflected in the service.   When asking for water, D always requests having a lemon in the water.   SheldonJ bought waters back but without the lemon.   Before D could ask for the lemon, SheldonJ was off at another table.   We flagged him down a few minutes later and asked for the lemon wedges which took about ten minutes to get back.

The pastas themselves were really good with my favorite being the linguine with the meat sauce.   Another server was responsible for bringing the pastas out.    As I was enjoying the linguine pasta (which was the 2nd pasta that I ordered), I realized that there was no parmesan cheese to put on the pasta.    I flagged SheldonJ and he said the pasta servers usually provide the parmesan but he would go get some.    He never came back with it.   Rather than let my pasta get cold, I went without it.

And subsequently on my 3rd pasta order I asked the server for some parmesan cheese and he said he'd be back and AGAIN no cheese.   As a funny aside they initially gave the 3rd pasta order to D (who only had room for 2 plates).   D jokingly lamented that because he's a bigger guy, they automatically assumed he was the glutton.   LOL

Despite the lack of cheese (which actually they probably saved me a few extra calories...LOL) it wound up being a satisfactory meal and a great bargain for the price.",PVG8Mven0Swjrwxg_C5a4Q,0,0,4,inafbblwuwJubsKdkO9uIQ

I usually prefers neighborhood small brunch places, instead of glossy overpriced eating establishment serving the same brunch dishes but in Vegas Strip, you don't really have much choice.  

Anyway, to be fair, the brunch selection here is pretty good. I got Croissant French Toast, which was four croissants flattened, then dipped in creme brûlée batter, and grilled. Sounds good, right? Full point for uniqueness. It was good, but this got too buttery and oily the more I had them. My heart doctor would not approve this. So I recommend sharing this dish around the table. 

The Breakfast Burrito was pleasant. Big serving. The beans and eggs were done perfectly, and the salsa was good, although I wish it was more tangy. I feel this has nothing special to warrant almost 16 dollars price but again, what could I expect in a big restaurant in Planet Hollywood like this?

Ok, so it probably wasn't the best I have EVER had, but at the time it was perfect. 

I always get the over-easy eggs with french fries... Uh.. remember that last part when I said I was drunk? Don't judge! Drunk or not, it is delicious and totally hits the spot! Also, I have never had bad service here. My water glass was constantly being refilled (Wonder why?!) and the servers are very good at pretending they don't hear the ridiculous conversations you are having. 

The only bad thing about this restaurant is the price. It is to be expected in Vegas I suppose, but for the type of food they sell- general American fare- it is definitely over-priced.

I had the the Buffalo chicken sammich fashioned after an order of what else but buffalo wings, duh. Pulling an all-nighter and being in desperate need of refueling, of COURSE that's the item that stood out to me. I wasn't really expecting much as the place even resembles a Denny's, but all in all, I was surprisingly pleased. No small piece of rubbery chicken doused in some ranch-like goo made it's way to the table. Instead, I received a hefty patty of crisp, hot sauced chix, sprinkled with a good amount of blue cheese crumbles. Not fine dining by any means, but it certainly hit the spot. It was a decent size too. I only finished half and took the rest back to the hotel before heading straight back out for more trouble-brewing.... but that's another conversation entirely.

A few cons:

- $15 is on the pricey side for a meal that probably shouldn't cost more than 10 bucks elsewhere. It *IS* Vegas, though. I suppose that's to be expected.

- SERVICE. Damn. The guy was nice when he was around, but we barely saw him outside of taking our orders and when he brought the check. I understand we're eating at 4am, but this place is supposed to be fully operational 24 hours a day. Why oh WHY did it take 30+ minutes to get our food? And if we didn't ask another server to check on our orders, I wonder how much longer we would have waited.

Anyway, I'd eat here again if it was a convenience issue (which it was), but probably not by choice because of the whole when-in-Vegas-eat-GREAT-not-good thing... Actually, on second thought, I take that back. I'll probably be back out of necessity. Thems dining options are slim to none at the crack of dawn.

Worse yet? Of the five in our group I don't think a single one of us was happy with the meal. It was just.... ok.

This place, even in the middle of the night, tries to have a far reaching menu but fails to deliver on the quality of said items... and they are relatively overpriced to boot!

There are easily three or four dozen televisions in the establishment running what seems to be an attention-deficit friendly tirade of Extra and Sports Center in every direction.  The decor and furnishings are actually somewhat stylish by comparison of the rest of Planet Hollywood's contrast-happy black, pink, chrome, and frosted glass.

Sadly, the ""late night"" menu stumbles in its hopes to offer anything substantial or memorable (or pleasantly memorable, anyhow).  There was the gummy/chewy calamari that came to the table in an abundant, but lukewarm oily pile.  The lettuce wraps, wherein the chicken/peanuts/water-chestnut mix was so homogenous, it was scary.  The fried chicken and waffle with the overcooked flavorless dry chicken ""breast"" patty sitting unceremoniously atop an unremarkable waffle (okay, the honey-butter was okay...!)  And the pepper'd pepper chicken that was so peppering pepper'd that all you could pepper was the pepper.

Plus one star for the service, Molly, I believe her name was; she was excellent in her attention and could tell we weren't enjoying the food much.  But she was sweet, its too bad she has to fight such an uphill battle serving this stuff.

I ordered the Ham & Cheese Omelette ($13.99/14.99 w/o TR Card)  combo which consisted of the following:
the omelette
toast
roasted potatoes

The Omelette (2 stars): I don't think this was made with real eggs. The texture had a very slimy consistency. Even the portion size was ample, Paying $15 for an omelette not made with real eggs is not on my Vegas to-do list.

Toast: (1 star): It's really a giant piece of bread, not even cut. I tried to take one bite into the toast...inedible. It was impossible to eat because the toast was too dry and hard to bite into.

Roasted Potatoes ( 3 stars): Sadly, the best part of the menu. It's pretty hard to mess up cooking potatos, right?

We went for a late dinner after driving hours to get to Vegas. Was seated immediately because there weren't too many people. The lighting was very dim and the decor/furniture/waiters' uniforms was very blah. All the staff there seemed bored to death. Very apathetic and their attitude screamed that they did not want to be there. And that attitude spoke out, because our waiter went missing for a long time. Saw her flirting with a co-worker. Had to flag her down to get water refilled and get some Tabasco.

They serve breakfast all day, which was nice as I was feeling breakfast. But their prices were RIDICULOUS. Cheapest thing on their menu was $12 and it goes up to $25. I paid $12 for 3 scrambled eggs (looked more like 2 eggs though), 2 pieces of bacon, 2 pieces of toast. At least they gave me some butter and jam for my toast. A luxury! Taste was ok, but it's eggs and bacon...can't really mess that up. Wasn't worth $12. More like a $6 meal. 

Basically, if we had known the prices were so high, we would have gone to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR, which was literally right next door.

We also came here for dinner with the kids and order the New York steak, burger, quesadillas, as well as a lettuce wrap. Everything was amazing. We had steak the night before at STK and this one was much, much better. High quality meat, grilled to perfection. 

I really don't get any of the other people complaining about the food. I have come here about 25 times and every time the experience has been amazing.

The wait staff is the best on the strip. Richard and Bryan are particularly good: Friendly, attentive, etc. Richard offered to split one Oreo shake into 2 for the kids, because he thought a whole shake is too much for an 8 year old - right he was (even though the kids disagreed).

The one comment I would make is the wine selection. It's not great at all. It's also overpriced relative to the food which is fabulous value. They basically sell $6 wine for about $40.

For the food, it was mediocre at best and a little overpriced. I ordered the corned beef hash which wasn't terrible but for the cost, the portion was very small. Little cubes of corn beef hash really doesn't cut it for $16. However, the corn beef was flavorful and really made the dish along with the eggs. The potatoes needed a touch up on seasoning. Nothing some salt and pepper couldn't fix though.

I didn't come in with high expectations and knew the possibility of tasting nothing ground breaking as I've been to many places just like this. Though small, the corn beef (meat alone) and the service earns this three stars in my opinion. The prices need some work for what you're receiving.

We ordered some pancakes and were told that the $6.99 deal was only on weekdays. Really? The huge flashing banner doesn't say that (we checked on the way out, too.

When we arrived (just 3 ladies) the restaurant was pretty much empty:; it was 2:30pm. Our server came for drink orders and we asked for three waters and two soft drinks. It took well over 5 minutes to get 2 waters and one soft drink. We had to ask again for a third water and the other soft drink that was supposed to come. It took about 3-5 min for that request to be fulfilled. When the server came back, she filled what she THOUGHT was my water and it was actually my Sprite. I had no idea she even took my glass and i went to drink and it was sweet water. When I told her, she laughed and said ""oh, I thought something was wrong when I grabbed that glass"". It's like, if you felt it was wrong, you should have let me know instead of just putting it back for me to figure out. Next, we ordered food, where, personally I felt was rushed (I was a server for over 8 years and when menus are still open, you just leave tables alone). I'm not sure if the server was rushing because she was trying to leave or what, but it was really annoying. Once we ordered, it took almost 25 min to get our entrees (two deli sandwiches and one Mac and cheese with fries as an appetizer). Well, my appetizer never came so I had to request it again and instead of an apology we were told ""oh, yeah, I'll go make sure they don't get lost like they usually tend to!"" Not professional at all and too much information that I could have done without. I finally received the fries and they were okay. I ate most of my Mac and cheese since I was starving, but it was pretty tasteless and unseasoned. My friend hated her tuna salad sandwich but does not like to complain at restaurants to avoid her food being potentially tampered with out of spite, so she ate enough to feel satisfied and left the rest. We got our check and even the checks were messed up with items all split incorrectly. We just paid what was on our check and us ladies just paid each other so we didn't have to stay longer for the server to re-do everything.

Food 1/2 Star
Price vs Quality/Value  1/2 Star
 
Overall this is an ok place to eat if your in a pinch for time. I had breakfast and dinner here during my stay at Planet Hollywood. It's nothing the worst or the best it's a true definition of a three star location. 

ATMOSPHERE
The location is on the casino floor and if your not a smoker you will notice the smoke and smell inside the location very easy. There is no separation between the restaurant and the casino its open space. The inside is very simple and basic with the seating and tables. They are standard size tables and seats both chairs and cushion bench.

CLEANLINESS
I was not impressed with the level of cleanliness I observed during my visits. The menu had food on it and sticky from prior guests. The smell of the smoke also made it feel not clean even if it was. 

SERVICE
The server I had each time was fine. They did ok and were nothing special. I could have gotten the same level of service from a robot. No personality, no food recommendations, and very limited follow up after the food arrived on one occasion. 

FOOD
I had breakfast with eggs benedict one morning and it was served the proper way. The ham was slightly over cooked making it tough to cut with a fork. Bacon side I ordered was cooked crispy and tasted good. The eggs benefict aside from the ham was tasty.

I had the breakfast platter one morning which included eggs, bacon. sausage, and pancakes. That was a good meal. Everything was cooked correctly and tasted good. I would order that again for sure

The breakfast meals come with potato wedges that are WAY OVER SALTED. You will need chapstick after eating some of those from the dehydration in your mouth the salt causes. 

I lastly ordered a burger to go and pot stickers around 4:30 am one morning as I returned to the hotel. The burger was not cooked to the proper temperature. The pot stickers were not flavorful at all. This mean was disappointing at best. No it was not from coming back at 4 am intoxicated either lol I do not drink alcohol very often.

PRICE vs QUALITY
This location is a little pricey for the food you get. Breakfast for a single person will easily run $20-$35 per person. They charge for everything such as a super small children's size orange juice is $5 and soda's are like $3.99 I think. They do not even list the price on the menu for them. Simple side of bacon just a couple strips was the cost a meal $5.99 for 3 pieces of bacon lol. So they are open 24 hours and it's easy to get to inside the casino so it's convenient.

So our waitress comes and she says we can only order breakfast.  Lunch and the Asian dishes can only be ordered after 11am.  11am?!  Even McDonalds starts serving lunch earlier than that!!  And we couldn't even order a side of fries! She couldn't even take our order now and give it to the cooks at 11. So we take more time to look at breakfast only.

I ordered the chicken and waffle ($16) along with 4 other people at our table.  Food took forrrevver to get to our table.  By the time the food came, it was already time to start serving lunch.  But there was one person at our table who didn't get their meal.  We asked the server and he checked the ticket and says it wasn't on there. WTF, our waitress totally didn't even add it!  And we couldn't even confront her about it because she never came back to our table to see if everything was OK, we had to flag down our server to let them know the order was missing.  

Food quality was subpar.  The syrup they provided was not regular maple syrup.  It actually tasted pretty nasty with my waffle so I ate my waffle without syrup. The chicken was dry with not much flavor, so we all asked for ketchup (hella filipino) to dip our chicken in.  But when we asked, they only gave us a tiny serving of ketchup.  When we asked for more ketchup, specifically a bottle of ketchup, they just brought out more mini cups of ketchup.

The portion was massive and this definitely would have been better for a family-style sharing (my friend doesn't like duck, so this was all mine).

We each ordered a pop to drink and after the first time bringing out our drinks and food not once did a waitstaff member come by to check to see if we were enjoying or meal, or if we needed anything else.

Personal preferences aside, this time, I ordered a mini mac & cheese which was perfect and probably 2 servings worth. It was perfect.

And i kept it down and I downed it all. 4-star mac and cheese.

My 2 star goes to the Corned Hash. Do NOT order it. if you love corned hash this will ruin it for you. I thought that this benedict combo of a corned hash dish with its poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, sprinkled with chives sounded bomb but nope. Diced potatoes were undercooked. The Corned Hash itself was drenched in grease. The Holladaise sauce was not the creamy savory taste you want in the sauce and the eggs were rubbery. Sad. 

My other friends were very happy with their steak and eggs, french onion soups and chow mein however. Those may be better options. If you order the nachos, it can probably be shared between 4+ people.

This place wasn't too busy for dinner, but the wait for food took a while. I had asked for brown gravy instead of country gravy, but the order came out with country gravy and had to be returned to the kitchen.

Now let me say that the wait was a little long for the whole meal, and normally that plus the order mistake would make for a negative review. However, the food was amazing - like I said, best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had, and creamy Mashed Potatoes. An excellent meal.

On top of this, Jarrett was a great server; this caliber of service is so greatly appreciated in Vegas! He was polite, checked on the table repeatedly, apologized for the delays and errors, and sincerely did everything he could for a terrific dining experience.

They offer breakfast, asian food, soups, nachos, and everything that your heart desires. My friends had ordered a medley chicken nachos, chicken and waffles, wonton noodle soup amongst other things. I think that the location is great since there are no other moderately cheap dine-in places in Planet Hollywood. To be honest, I was really getting sick of eating Panda Express and Earl's Sandwiches. The waitress was very friendly for putting up with such a large party (15+) and especially since some of us has brought fast food in to eat with our friends. 

The best part was that they gave us these tiny little ketchup bottles and jam jars for each individual. Sure, it was hard to take out such little ketchup in one of those mini glass jars, but I really appreciate the little cute things.

The worst part however was that they did not have a restroom. In order to wash your hands and such, you have to walk out of the restaurant and go into one of the public restrooms.

The remaining group (including yours truly) walked around looking for something to munch on.  Being lazy, we decided to look for something within PH.

So we found this coffee house right next to the Pleasure Pits of Planet Hollywood and decided to give it a try.  Look quickly through the menu and......one thing on the menu caught all our eyes.  LOCO MOCO!!

Three husky boys getting all excited for some late night loco moco....woo hoo.

Big props to Rob for ordering extra gravy for our dishes because it's not made the usual hawaiian way you get at those BBQ houses.

Rice was a little on the dry side and the steak was pretty small.  Even our waiter was understanding and brought us 6 dishes of gravy...NICE DUDE!

For what its worth...it's Las Vegas....it's 3-4 in the morning...it's $15 a plate....not too bad.  Or maybe it was the alcohol that made the food taste good.  Hmmm.....",AIaegsReyPT1j66wRyQHCQ,0,0,3,R7Tkp_STR3_YsWW6UD3yEg

Normally I don't like fries with my breakfast but these were really good. My only complaint was the biscuit was very salty so I didn't eat it.

We ordered a few appetizers- the blacked ahi and the chicken lettuce wraps. The ahi was delicious! Perfect sear, and seasoning, as well as delicious chunks of avocado in between each piece. The lettuce wraps were ok- I am more use to like a really chicken but this one was more like a ground chicken. 

For our entrees I got the bacon, cheddar burger and asked if I could get an egg on it. They were able to accommodate my request thanks to Jose. The burger was huge and very good. I only are about half- the fries were delicious! My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he also enjoyed.

I don't remember too much of the past but the sober me that went recently found this place to be A-OK.  I guess I must have been on hot streaks when I went to Planet Dailies in the past because a sober me would never want to spend $20 on a salad, despite it being good, at a casino cafe.

One thing that really got on my nerve though was when our waiter described to us their Egg Drop Soup ($10.95).  He described it as the size of a Pho Noodle Bowl, so we decided to have it thinking it was a lot of soup for a party of 4.  When it arrived...the bowl was huge but ""where was the soup we thought?""  The soup filled only a quarter of the bowl...wow!...we got hosed.

Here's what we orderd:
Egg Drop Soup $10.95
Crab Salad $20.50
Carbonara $14.50
Reuben $13.99

The Crab Salad was a superstar although a bit pricey.  The Egg Drop Soup was a rip.  The Carbonara was alright.  And, the Reuben was good enough to clean the plate.

'Planet Dailies' was the spot our group of gals chose after walkin' endlessly in Vegas. 

On to the marks for the good, bad, and ugly !

Good: 

- Seated almost immediately with a group of 6. 

- My Ahi tuna salad was delish. Not overly seasoned and it wasn't doused with so much dressing that you could barely taste the delicate flavors of the veggies and ahi tuna. 

- Free mini Heinz ketchup bottle ! Well, at least the girls figured it was free. Cute memorabilia ???

- Lively and flat screen TVs are seen throughout. A good place to catch a game and maybe grab a few drAnks.

Bad:

- Menu suffered from a case of mistaken identity. Are we American, Asian, Italian, or Mexican ???

- I love options, but looking at the menu made me crave for a broad range of things from oatmeal to wonton soup ?! Oy ! I'm indecisive enough as it is. Why must you torture me 'Planet Dailies' ? Why ?

Ugly:

- An extensive menu comes with a ridiculous price. Basic breakfast food items you can get from Denny's is twice the cost here. No bueno.

3958229,2011-05-18,0,lGy7jJ9oVZUJNkmZj7ewgA,"A couple days later and still thinking about this place... not in a good way.
So my bf and I are debating what to eat for dinner after watching Peep Show and we turn to Yelp. Although Yelp had Earl of Sandwich (5 stars and cheap) listed as a hot spot we went for Planet Dailies instead since it was in Planet Hollywood where the show was. It was nearly empty when we went but then again it was midnight. We did however walk by the place before the show at 8:00pm and it still was pretty empty for a Saturday night.

These were the following reasons why a) I can't stop thinking about how disappointed I was, b) gave it 2 stars, and c) will never go back.

We ordered a Reuben sandwich, shrimp tempura, and a Caesar salad. We requested the shrimp tempura, being an appetizer, be served prior to our dinner. When the food arrived we received the Caesar salad and the Reuben first. We let the server, who was not our waiter, know of the missing shrimp tempura. He said he would check with our waiter on it. I was next disappointed in the fact that the Caesar salad was brought to me not chopped, but in huge ""leaf-like"" pieces. I suppose it's something new places are trying to make it more avant garde but I'm on vacation trying to cut my lettuce with a butter knife. The grilled chicken that came on the plate looked delicious but when I took a bite it tasted very burnt. The cross marks from being grilled were indeed black. The edge of the chicken crispy and dry. The taste was so unpleasant I did not eat anymore. A third server brought us our shrimp tempura and did explain that they know we wanted it first but it actually took longer for the shrimp tempura to cook than the other two dishes we ordered. The shrimp tempura was actually delicious and hot but at that point I really didn't care. When ever appetizer dishes are brought out after the main dishes, I always have this attitude like, ""Well I could have just not ordered it to begin with and not have to pay for it if it was going to arrive late."" 

Finally, our actual server came by and apologized. I honestly felt the staff had been really nice... I think I just may have ordered the wrong things, they came out in the wrong order, and they were not the best quality... All of this confirmed by a $60 bill :( That is pretty steep considering we had lunch at Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris Hotel which offers excellent atmosphere, service, and the dishes are actually worth the $60 for a 4 1/2 star place. At Mon Ami Gabi they actually comped us dessert for serving me the wrong dish. At this place I only heard apologies... would have liked to see us comped for receiving our appetizer late. I feel a restaurant who delivers great guest service will do it without the guest having to ask. We honestly will not go back because there is something better we can compare it to for the same price.",Qg6MiDBh2uAupQSwqPqHOQ,1,0,2,c5jEdJNxiPzwv13H9nY_NQ

Food Quality = Okay.  I had a BLT for one visit, and hot and sour soup another visit.  The BLT was AMAZING!  One of the best BLT's I have ever had.  The bacon was perfectly crunchy and salty.  The hot and sour soup was not that great.  The presentation of the soup was pretty good though.

After checking in to the hotel, BF and I were starving and didn't want to have to wander too far to grab something to eat.  So we headed here, and we were not disappointed at all.

It took a while to decide what we wanted, they have so many choices on their menu (think Cheesecake Factory menu book).  Our server was super cute and friendly and did not hesitate to offer up suggestions.  So I settled with Lobster Fettucine and BF got the Club.  My dish was so good that I ate ALL of it.  And usually I'm done with fettucine halfway though since it's so heavy.  Planet Dailies version is far from that.  I didn't even need a nap afterwards!

Now my BF's sandwich was a completely different story.  That thing was as big as my head.  Fries were thin and crispy (perfect).  There was so much meat on his sandwich that he ended up having to take it apart and take some meat off so he could fit the thing in his mouth.

24-hour service for breakfast, lunch or dinner, center of the LV Strip. Plus, it's located in the casino area-- not through a maze at the back of the hotel-- easy access no matter where you are coming from on the strip.

Unfortunately, some of the items are a little over-priced, but if you're on vacation, you're probably already making some splurges anyway.  My husband got one waffle with a little syrup (no fruit, no extra butter, nothing) for $10.  When you think about how much it would cost you to make one waffle on your own, $10 is a little steep; then, you consider that it's 3 am on a Wednesday, and it's not too terrible I suppose.  But then again, some items are about right, price wise.  

The service is fair; you can tell that some servers are sick of the night shifts, tired of drunk tourists, or just hate their job.  

Also, there's no restroom in the restaurant; only in the casino area, which is just outside the restaurant.   

Overall, a good spot for late night or early morning meals.  They have a wide variety of items at a slightly higher price, but they serve it all 24 hours a day.",GomlzJ2OiLCsiowRfWUl8g,0,0,3,AqlHS7qybSlPLmj0oXVb5A

We were also both really happy with what we ordered.  Mine was a breakfast burrito, which was grilled and melty and delicious.  It was also too gigantic to finish.   My guy got this outrageous French toast.  They started with cinnamon rolls and sliced them up and dipped them in creme brulee batter and grilled them.  Then they put strawberry sauce on top.

It came with two pieces of toast, and a small heap of fries. Other members of my family had equally pricey meals.

We ordered eggs and bacon with pancakes.  I also ordered an iced tea that never arrived. 20 minutes later our waiter told me he didn't forget about my tea, he just had to make more. I didn't really believe that. I think he forgot- then remembered that he forgot and told me he had to make it.  On a Saturday morning shouldn't someone be checking on things like how much tea or coffee do we have, and do we need to make more??  I think we had a new waiter. He didn't know what ""country scramble"" eggs are. After I explained it, he said all their eggs are fresh.  The eggs were not fresh cracked eggs. They definitely came from a carton.  

When our food came my husband had one dry piece(no butter) of sourdough toast on his plate with his eggs. I had all my food on 1 plate- eggs, pancakes, potatoes, and a bunch of bacon scraps.  We didn't get any butter for our pancakes or toast so we had to wait for that. I wanted an extra plate for my pancakes so I didn't get syrup on my eggs-maybe I'm picky- but we had to wait for that. So my eggs ended up getting cold.   The plates are too small- my food kept sliding off it.  The salt and pepper shakers are grinders- so you get big pieces of sea salt and pepper- and you can't adjust the grind.  We also had to wait forever for our bill.

This place is aiite. Typical Diner food, but pricier. I accompanied my girlfriend here after a night of drinking and staying up late.

Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry and I'm kind of trying to watch my figure so I went with the biscuits and country gravy with a side of grits. My alcoholic girlfriend ordered a glass of orange juice and a country omelet. Although the food is pricey, you get a pretty large portion. My biscuits were very buttery and the country gravy gave it a nice creamy texture to them. The potatoes were delicious and the sausage was just wateves. Luckily my girlfriend had to puke some more, so while she was gone I got to taste her country omelet. It sucked. cold, gross, and rubbery. Anyways, I asked for the check and to my surprise the meal was over 40 bucks. My girlfriend's OJ was 6 bucks. damn. if you get a screwdriver on the casino floor, that would have been free.

It was around 11pm or so when my friends and I landed in Vegas. This was my first time and like every other first time, it was one I'll never forget. 

Anywho, we met these guys from Miami and they were staying at the Bellagio (which I will review later) and so, one of the guys wanted to take me to eat. I am not gonna lie, I was starving. 

The environment is great. The hostess were friendly and I don't know if the guy wanted to show off or not but he topped one of them because he wants a booth. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Pasta and it was great!!! The garlic bread sticks were buttery and tasty as well. I forget what he ordered but they burnt his toast. Lol.

Our waiter Gordon was very handsome and we could tell that he had a long day, so we didn't give him a hard time.

With that said, this is an awesome place for dinner at 5am in the morning!!!

The accuracy with our orders could have been a little better, though I also think some of us were being a bit high maintenance with the changes and substitutions! The restaurant is kept-up really well for being a 24/7 spot; the cleanliness was quite impressive.

This place has a $12, 24-ounce tall alcoholic plastic beverage thing that you can walk around with, and that's amazing. First, I only went there for 'refills' (they give you a new plastic glass each time) but then decided to hit the spot up for a dinner later.

They have great promo prices (we had a whole 16-ounce prime rib dinner for $16.99) that came with the meat, a huge salad, fries or potatoes, and side veggies. Everything else on the menu looks awesome, and we'll definitely be back. Open 24/7 and have all kinds of meals, all the time.

It's a cool spot to look out onto the slot area and enjoy some people-watching. It's not the 'nicest' spot to go, but it's great for solid food and good service (we had a gal who sounded like she was perhaps from the midwest, Nell, and she was super sweet and also very efficient).

Rueben - Tasty but a bit dry.  Im more of a jewish deli rueben guy so this just didnt cut it.

Mushroom Swiss burger - Juicy patty and hit the spot but that might be due to all the alcohol from beforehand.

Momosas - Fruity flavor.  strawberry better than mango.  Dont forget to stick your pinky out

I got in the early morning and was staying at the Planet Hollywood, and I am happy this place is located right in the hotel because I desperately needed fuel after an awful and uncomfortable flight.

You always worry about an overcooked steak, especially a steak that's only 7 ounces. Next, you worry about over cooked eggs. Thankfully, everything was perfect. The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and well-seasoned, and the eggs were perfectly over easy with a runny yolk. I got rye bread, but it didn't seem like I did since I didn't get much caraway seeds. The bread was thick cut, which was nicely soaked up the runny yolk and juices from the steak. Now, if you'd believe, those weren't even the best part! The potatoes were amazing. I loved the seasoning, and the potatoes were fried to a nice crisp while the inside was soft. I wish I had more of it!

The service was very good. Out server was very attentive, very friendly, and spot on refilling our water. The food came out fast too.

Overall, you can't beat a steak and eggs breakfast for only $7.95 anywhere, but a steak and eggs breakfast that is well-cooked, well-seasoned, and well-prepared with super attentive and friendly service? You can't go anywhere else! I wish this was available where I live. Actually, it is, but it's double the cost -_-.

4654918,2012-09-23,1,lGy7jJ9oVZUJNkmZj7ewgA,"I have dined in better restaurants- such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Panda Express.

 The $9.99  ""all you can eat pasta with salad"" special lured me here. I love spaghetti, so how could I pass up an all you can eat pasta special in a Strip resort cafe? My experience here puts an answer to that question. The service and food was not up to the expectations I have for a restaurant that usually charges over $15 for a burger. 

  The ""all you can eat pasta with salad"" special, as another yelper wrote, is a joke. I am seriously under the impression that it is a scam. What makes me say that? When the waiter served me the spaghetti, it was only pasta (I had to ask for sauce). Aha! Then I turn to Yelp, and another reviewer wrote that if they put sauce on the pasta it is $4.95 each refill. These were red flags and a negative first impression of Planet Hollywood's coffee shop. When I pressed the waiter about this, he stated that it is free with sauce. At any rate, the pasta was unworthy of a high calorie refill. To put it nicely Sbarro was better-at least they have meatballs.

The restaurant is understaffed, causing  an overworked waiter to serve many tables. The consequence is slow service. If I relished the pasta, I would pass over waiting the equivalent of a couple baseball innings for a refill. If you eat here I recommend that your batteries are fully charged on your smart phone. You could be sitting here a long time. By the way the overworked waiter was friendly-one redeeming fact in keeping the rating at 2.

  Another minor complaint I have are the booths. The booths are too plush and this causes the table to be in a higher proportion than your shoulder-at least if you are my size.

  I would pass over Planet Dailies. So overpriced and slow service. If you are in Planet Hollywood, I recommend the restaurants in Miracle Mile, or even McDonald's.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,1,0,2,whUMk6fTJmjzXaPF9S4S8A

I couldn't agree more. Planet Dailies, located on the casino level of Planet Hollywood, is definitely not a place I'd recommend to anyone who actually feels like eating and enjoying their food. I would, however, recommend this place to people who find themselves in one of the following situations:
a) It's between 2pm and 4pm - that awkward time that's too late to be lunch, yet too early to be dinner - and you've finally gotten over your morning hangover. 
b) You need to eat because you know it's bad to drink on an empty stomach.

Upon arrival we were seated promptly.  No complaints about that. The seating arrangement I suppose is made to work around all the plasma tv's that surround the entire eatery.  I ordered the fried chicken meal which was really good and my hub ordered salmon which was also pretty damn good!

We didn't order anything else and I'm glad we didn't because just two meals and two mimosa's came to a total of $80!!! Wow! The mimosas were $10 each!!!

White rice, with a thick gravy sauce, and two eggs -- which we opted for over easy. Love that gooey yolk! We ended up getting this dish twice, on separate days, once for takeout since we were in a hurry, and once for dine-in. Open 24 hours, conveniently located in Planet Hollywood. They give a lot more rice and gravy for the dine-in plate, which is expected.Everyone can kind of slap a dish together for takeout, but presentation would count more for dining in. Either way, delicious, and thoroughly enjoyed. Especially on a cold night, this was really warming and comforting. 

Another time, I got the egg white omelette with cheddar cheese/tomatoes. Nothing special about this meal -- more scrambled than an omelette, but the french fries were thin and crispy, with a little batter on them. Sourdough bread slice with butter and jam rounded out the meal. Hearty enough to start the day or afternoon, or a late night snack. You get hungry pretty quickly thereafter with this meal. 

Both dine-in service and take-out are really friendly. Hostesses are always greeting you or saying goodbye, answering questions I had about the menu, etc. We were given to go water cups while we waited for our take out order. 

Our server, Nathan was super nice, came by multiple times to either check on us or clear our plates. Was tentative to my husband's drinks and whether he wanted more. Never rushed us -- it was not busy at either time we stopped by, and it was a very large space with plentiful tables.

We asked some of the staff what was open at the time we were looking for a restaurant + bar (around 3am) and he said only McD's, Planet Dailies, & Earl of Sandwich. LIES! So many things were still open even after we ate. Boo.

Service is super slow even with not many customers. We had a table for 5, got a bucket of beer, waters, and diner food. Beer came in a low level of ice and the beer wasn't even chilled! Took forever to get cold after we added some salt in the ice bucket. Waters needed refilling and we were able to get one towards the end of our stay...dude what?!

We ordered 2 omelets, a loco moco, croissant French toast, and fish tacos. I remember the guys saying the omelet was edible but not great (Denny's was even better), loco moco was ordered with eggs over easy and steak medium rare and ended up eggs over hard and steak super well done (they were even crispy) and dry, and didn't provide much gravy. No island flavah...L&L mo bettah. The fish tacos tasted bland, fell apart and had to be eaten with a fork. The croissant French toast was probably the best one there (dipped in creme brûlée batter and dusted with powdered sugar).

We sat right next to their register and still wasn't being served much, and holy crap the food was expensive!!! The croissant French toast and fish tacos order (with just water, mind you) came out to be $27.00 after tax. Yeah...

Best bet is walking around as other bars and restaurants are still open after 3am AND McD's will probably even be a better choice.

It was basically 7 bucks for it. 3.95 for the biscuits and 2.50 for the gravy. Now you just wanna milk me for my money. Our last visit wasn't spectacular.

Here's two things you should try for sure coming here: the huevos rancheros - served differently than you would normally see - and the freaken ice cream cup with brownies plastered all over the side - its the craziest ice cream cup ever in terms of size - the picture doesn't even do it justice cuz usually they over-exaggerate pictures but they definitely shorted this one by two fold (thats a good thing!)

FYI - I am reviewing this place even after losing (financially) on my vegas trip so don't think I am giving it a good rating because I was up and anything would've tasted good.

I had the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs, it came with potatoes and biscuits. This is by far the nasties cfs I've ever eaten, it was chewy, like gum and the meat tasted like it was frozen again and again. For a $16 plate you'd think you be eating real eggs, well these are the ones that come out of a box, this definitely was not a $16 plate; the best thing from this plate were the potatoes. My husband ordered an omelette and he said the same thing about the eggs, he said it wasn't that good. Maybe breakfast isn't their thing, I didn't care for it and will never be back when we're in Vegas.",rf_ZfJBQ7UG90117NWizKQ,0,0,1,AuJHr5dzSE4Hw26lh055VA

The first time we arrived in line around 10:30AM and sat within 10 minutes of falling in line. The next morning we arrived at 9:30AM and got sat immediately. Closer to 11AM you tend to see a longer line. 

We ordered the 6oz steak and eggs for $8.99. This special is available daily from 11PM-11AM. We ordered different cooks for the steak and for a diner I'm glad they cooked it as we asked. I've experienced discounted diners that over cooked the meat however this restaurant cooked it to our liking. We also ordered a tall stack of pancakes to share for our table ($14.99). I really enjoyed the pancakes. They weren't soggy or too dense. They were fluffy and the powdered sugar formed an extra layer and texture. I enjoyed it more than simple pancakes at other diners. 

Overall it was a good breakfast option if you're not looking for something really fancy. Quite a bit of seating available so they turn tables rather quickly. When it gets busy servers may take longer to get to you since the hosts seat guests as tables open up. Next to the server cashier we got a coupon for earls and other restaurants.

5189199,2011-07-09,0,lGy7jJ9oVZUJNkmZj7ewgA,"Saturday Dinner @ Planet Dailies in Planet Hollywood
With the show, we got a small meal deal with it. We got a voucher for all of us to get 50% our meals at this place Planet Dailies. We didn't really know what to expect, so when we got there we found plenty of options. They have all kinds of food there, and it's all pretty decently priced, around $10-15 a plate, with pretty good sized portions as well. The waiter was really nice and he let us know that the asian noodles were really good there because the chef was in kind of a separate kitchen almost with his own little section and he barely speaks english. The food, therefore, was pretty authentic according to him. Having completely overlooked that entire section because we had thought otherwise, we thought it would be good to try. My friend decided to just go with a pastrami sandwich, which looked pretty good. It had really cool bread and lots of meat. Plus it came with fries. Looked delicious and filling. I was foolish and thought I wanted 2 dishes. I got both macaroni and cheese as well as beef congee (jook). Both were huge, and of course if you know me you could guess that I ate about 1/2 of one and 1/6 of the other. The macaroni and cheese was VERY rich. Delicious, but rich. The noodles were drenched in cheese, and there was a TON of it. The jook was good, nothing too special, but I don't really know how you can make that better than it is... I mean all it is is rice and water... it helped my throat, which was a little irritated at the time. Oh, and did I mention that the macaroni and cheese was GIGANTIC? Oh, I did? Well... it really was. But it was really good.. I wish that they sold them in small bowls, because that's really what I wanted... Anyway, my eyes are definitely way bigger than my stomach for SURE. Another thing that my mom got was the Hong Kong style won ton soup. It looked really good, but between my two dishes, I had 0% space in my stomach. My mom said it was especially filling because they had both the won tons and the extra noodles on the bottom. She said it was good though. Everyone seemed to like their meals there, and everyone got something different. Plus, the fact that everything was 50% off made it just that much better.",ajiBmXVNJ9FFUKMIJRSh7g,0,0,4,jHWPz180_K8u6weB4E1row

The first night I went with a group of friends, but I wasn't too hungry so had their Tex-Mex egg rolls which were pretty filling. They had some bite to it, thanks to all the delicious chili action going on. My friend's hubby got the Pad Thai, which he totally devoured and loved. While my egg rolls were tasty, I couldn't help but eye his noods.

The following night my best friend and I went for a late din after our concert and we were starving! Got the chicken lettuce wraps and a side of the house fried rice. WOW, the rice was amazing! I'm Filipino, was raised off Asian food and eat fried rice for breakfast more than I'd like to admit - I have to say that that was probably the best simple fried rice I've ever had! The lettuce wraps and the rice combination was simple and genius, two things I love! 

My BFF and I were thinking of going again for dinner but alas, we stayed on the strip but quite a ways away unforch. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat if not to only chow down on the lettuce wraps and fried rice - soooo delicious!  

The service the first night seemed a little off at first but then it ended up being fine. The second night our server was superb - he was the one who pointed out the lettuce wraps. Also, love the fact that they are generous in giving out refills!",7Ec68uItxHt14RX8a1IbbQ,1,1,4,jykx00H2kf8XTSEDWgXoqA

Anyway, the food itself was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Although, as I mentioned before, the choices are pretty good.  Open early and late is a big plus being in Vegas.  Costwise, I suppose it could have been a little less expensive being in Vegas for a diner, but not too bad.

There's a wide selection of food on the menu, but that's probably why the quality was not good at all. It's not even that cheap either. My husband ordered the Western Omelet ($14.99). It was a sad looking omelet with limp looking fries and toast on the side. My husband almost never complains about food and hates to waste anything, but even he didn't enjoy this meal and left quite a lot on his plate. 

I ordered the Mac & Cheese ($14.50). The pasta was a decent al dente, but the cheese sauce was incredibly bland. When I reached for the salt and pepper shakers, I discovered a large wad of tangled hair caught on the opening of the salt shaker. DISGUSTING! The mac was mostly inedible to begin with, and seeing that wad of hair obviously ruined my appetite further. 

After the hair incident, we couldn't wait to get out of this place. They messed up our check and added an extra beer on there. It was a relatively simple fix, but that just dragged things out longer. Ugh.",DNBkhL3fkyD7LC_ZT57EFg,0,0,2,HG94FzbrRV9Pzhw-HZy41w

At some point intending to visit each and every one of The Strip's 24/7 eateries it was largely as a result of my participation in the 2014 Dress For Success Power Walk that I ended up at Planet Dailies just after 6:00am on Saturday and although much could be written of the inebriated eye-candy still lingering after a long night of drinking and dance it was actually the food as well as the service that proved even more remarkable, a pleasant surprise to say the least.  Clearly not a typical pre-dawn patron for the Los Angeles import whose vast size only serves to magnify the sound emitted from LCDs displaying videos of top-40 hits it was with a request for a table toward the rear of the restaurant that I sought solace from the post-club 'scene' and graciously assenting to my appeal despite the section being otherwise unpopulated I was no sooner seated than a young woman named Deidre arrived along with a menu and all the right answers to questions regarding an order meant to make the most of my morning.  Happily offering a true ""All Day"" experience inclusive of breakfast favorites straight through sandwiches and steaks to dessert it was with gluttonous eyes focused more on variety than the costs involved that I inquired about single serving options and after confirming with the cook that such an order could be compiled it was in a quintet that I partook, a bottomless cup of coffee never coming close to half-empty throughout my sixty minute stay.  Opting to proceed in two courses with the first consisting of three a la carte griddle favorites plus a decidedly dry cinnamon roll it was undoubtedly the eggy French Toast that shined the brightest of the selections and with fresh fruit toppings all made in house along with hand whipped vanilla cream I'd be hard pressed to suggest which accoutrement was actually 'best,' though the juicy ripe peaches and boozy bananas foster certainly made an equally strong case.  Undoubtedly a substantial order given the heft of the custard laden challah it was unfettered that I moved on to a choice of desserts and although the restaurant's signature carrot cake certainly warranted a second look it was in the 'Heaven n' Hell' style bread pudding that I placed my trust - the juxtaposition of black and white batons proving absolutely delightful with the former resembling a semi-set brownie while the later featured laminated layers soaked in butter and cream that slowly melted on the tongue.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,3,4,NHTM7BLZ6YHEXq3xkE2yCQ

The ""specialty"" drinks are all $10.50 regardless of size or alcohol content. They were good, but not worth the price. I got the blood orange Cosmo and my bf got the creamsicle martini. These are the two drinks on the specialty cocktails menu with the most alcohol (highly recommended). Although not served  in martini glasses, as listed on the menu.

The worst though, was the service!!! We were sat immediately and brought water, which was fabulous. But not by our server. Once a sever was assigned to our table he was at our table every two seconds to take our order. We take a bit to decide on main dishes, so we ordered drinks and appetizers and let him know it would take us a bit to figure out what we wanted for our main course. He came over at least once every two minutes to ask if we were ready to place our order. Once we received our appetizer, he came back another two-three times to ask if we were ready. We were so fed up as we couldn't even get any peace to figure out what we wanted that we just closed out our check!

On top of it all, we were for my birthday and everyone that dealt with us (the ladies at the front holding the menus, the hostesses, even the lady that brought us water) wished me happy birthday......except for OUR WAITER!!! It might seem like a small thing, but you'd think that the person your dealing with the most during your dining experience (your waiter), would wish you a Happy Birthday when your wearing a giant ""Happy Birthday to me"" pin! Especially considering the amount of times he came to the table!

Once we closed our check, it only got worse. We paid the bill and were finishing our drinks. We under-tipped him a bit for the terrible service, so I had the book with the receipt still directly in front of me.

-Corned Beef Hash - topped with poached eggs with sauce. I'm wary of ordering poached eggs from places b/c I've had one too many experiences where they cooked the yolk solid. This place did it well! Runny yolk = LOOOVE. Corned beef was pretty salty, but not sure if it's supposed to be like that.... Any corned beef connoisseurs out there?

-Two Egg Breakfast - friend got this sunny side up. Good portion of food for a girl-with-the-appetite-of-a-dude.

Both came with potatoes and toast. The ""breakfast potatoes"" were actually more like crispy potato wedges and all uniformly golden. The whole wheat toast was the most perfectly toasted, thick yet fluffy piece of bread I'd ever seen in my life. I felt like Wallace... ""CRACKIN TOAST, GROMIT!!!"" They must have one excellent griddle/fryer master working those hours.

Our server stopped by often, and our food came out quickly. The restaurant was not that busy though.

Our waiter was probably the most memorable aspect because he looked like he could care less about being a waiter.  He wasn't rude or bad, he was just apathetic.

The ham in the omelette was excellent.

Something that always irritates me in a restaurant is getting your food and you have no silverware. Yup, that's what happen. Now this was breakfast, eggs cool down quickly. We said something to the person that brought our food and when he came out of the kitchen with more food for another table and no utensils for us to eat with I knew it would be a long wait.
I do not know if my food was served hot, by the time we received silverware my omelette was room temp.
Simple Western Omelette, but the classic mistake was made. Minimal filling and all dumped in the middle.  1/3 of the omelette was egg only, 1/3 cheese, onion and green pepper and 1/3 everything including the ham (which had an excellent flavor).",wgUYHGNoo0ulwwZpMox7dg,0,0,3,IbjXdByw4DKjwwvtZ-6yyA

My friend and I woke up late and wanted to grab lunch but couldn't think of anywhere else to go so we settled for this one. She said she saw this place was packed from the day before so she was curious, as was I. 

We were seated as soon as we walked in as it wasn't that busy. My friend and I ordered Mango Mimosas to start, and the Chicken Marsala and the Lobster Omelet. Those $6 mimosas were the best mimosas I've ever had. They were SO good! Being that I was in Vegas and I wanted to be drunk the entire time, I was glad that I was buzzed after just 2 sips of the drink. It was so strong but it was so worth it. Thumbs up. Or rather, two thumbs up. Six if I had six thumbs.

The chicken dish had a really strong wine flavor, which was good (I've had chicken marsalas where I can barely taste the wine, blech). The poultry was nice and moist, and the mushrooms gave the dish a nice touch. The veggies on the side were nicely steamed as well. The egg dish was very filling; I love love loved the lobster - it was very chunky and moist. 

I think I loved almost everything that this place had to offer. Very generous portions, chatty and really friendly server, the different TV's all playing different shows and the atmosphere. The one thing I didn't like was the price. I thought it was quite expensive. Was it good value for the food? Not really. I think I would have paid less than what I paid for

A better choice late night than Cabo Wabo!  Gosh starvation would be better than that horrid place but I digress...

We tried the buffet downstairs but couldn't get past waiting in line.  It felt as if we were waiting to eat in a windowless cellar and the people in line with us were being really pushy and aggressive.  I've noticed people ramp it up at buffets and I'm convinced that proximity to food brings out some sort of animalistic aggressive instinct.  No thank you.  So where can one eat late or later at Planet Hollywood?

Planet Dailies is great for that.  Basic food, served quickly and without a lot of fanfare. it never seems to be too busy and we get seated quickly and served quickly as well.

It's also pretty reasonably priced. 

Unfortunately Planet Hollywood seemed kind of tired and rundown the last time we visited and the first room they put us on was totally unsat. We likely won't stay there again. I thought the privacy drapes were closed but that was the view of the back of a wall and even though it was supposed to be 'strip view' it was a view of part of the Walgreen's on Las Vegas Blvd.  Once I complained they moved us.

We loved the formula which reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory with the super-sized creative dishes. We finally made it to breakfast which is one of my complaints since they serve ""breakfast"" 'round-the-clock but the real breakfasts are only in the AM. Like more variety of omlettes and waffles.

So my big complaint is how we charged our 12:30 AM dessert and coffee tab to our room. At check-out my darling noticed our extras tab had a swollen total for that dessert visit. Don't mess with Meg. Our bill was $17 and we left a (fair) $4. tip. Especially considering the restaurant happened to be out of half and half (I went next-door to Starbucks and brought back some in a tasting cup) I understand a restaurant 86'ing on stuff but vanilla ice cream? Di had to have a hot fudge sundae with the only remaining flavor, strawberry. But for our waitress to give herself a $17 tip ON TOP of ours, I'm sure she must-have sized us up as guests who wouldn't nit-pick the tab. The tip was bigger than our bill.

We got the credit at the desk after Meggie produces our receipt and the next night I called the shift supervisor, Matt who was very interested in our situation. He offered us ONE free meal. I was disappointed in his gesture. 

But we will go back for sure. Any place can have a shady employee and it barely affects my warm, fuzzy feelings about Planet Dailies. In fact, at our breakfast (10:45 AM) When our amazingly cheerful waitress actually read back our table order memorized, Di had never had a wait person do that before. She was really impressed. The food is high-quality fabulous. The atmosphere is great and their coffee is that kind we lust over. Real coffee shop coffee with that hint of chickory. We love that you can go right up to the counter with the stools in the middle of the restaurant and get coffees to go. Starbucks is too strong for my darling.

All the steaks were cooked a perfect medium rare, very tender and had a great flavor.  Ribs were also very good. Wife liked the Sea Bass.  Wide selection of choices, and breakfast specials 24/7.
The first server we had was good, but the next couple of times had young inexperienced servers who didn't seem to be very well trained.  They were slow to pick up empty plates, not attentive to us, and used phrases like 'not a problem!' instead of 'absolutely!'  When I flagged down our breakfast server to send my under cooked eggs back she ran over and said ""what's wrong?""

My sandwich was very so-so however. I couldn't taste much crab and it was kind of mushy. Larry's Reuben looked good, it was on marble rye and piled with meat and kraut, although I didn't try it.

We had a group of eight people, who each wanted something different and it was a huge headache, trying to figure out a place that would accommodate everyone's taste. Not to mention, I already had a huge headache from all of the previous night's alcohol consumption to begin with. 

We finally agreed to give Planet Dailies a try, since they had such a vast variety on their menu. They had all sorts of dishes: soups, salads, Asian cuisine, pastas, sandwiches/burgers, breakfast, steaks, seafood, smoothies, and shakes. 

I got the Hong Kong Wonton soup, which was okay. It came with leafy greens and several wontons. The broth was nice and clear, but it wasn't as good as wonton soup from an Asian restaurant of course. It was the perfect remedy for the time being. I also got the try the chicken fettuccini and the spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccini was too dry and the Alfredo sauce was way too thick. On the other hand, the spaghetti and meatballs was great. It was a humungous serving that my friend could not finish. Luckily, she was nice enough to share. The meatballs were tender and abundant. The sauce was the perfect consistency and I liked it.

The food actually deserves three stars, but I've given them an overall two stars, for their incredibly slow service. The food took a good thirty minutes to come out and when one of my friends asked for an extra spoon and Tabasco sauce, it took the waiter 15 minutes to bring out just the spoon--he had forgotten about the Tabasco sauce. There were only two other tables being occupied at the time, so the slow and forgetful service was really unacceptable. 

Since they are open 24 hours, I would probably only come back during a drunken stupor, when I am feeling too good to even care about how long my food takes.",bm2DqfP4P454FjEtCbZdkQ,1,2,2,FFUvxsp5vnVfnsoopDLJbQ
