There's always a soccer game playing if that's your deal. The place is usually full of families and Hispanic bachelors. I don't blame them - the prices are fair, the food has been excellent every time. It's listed as mexican, but it's also salvadorean, which means they have pupusas. I highly recommend the chicharon y queso (pork and cheese). They're only a buck fifty. Same for tacos. The carne asada quesadilla has been tasty everytime. The meat entrees are good too.

We are visiting from out of town and wanted Mexican.  Found this restaurant on yelp and thought it was worth a look.

1657348,2013-06-25,0,oH84VXzObXpaC5ia2Tenpw,"I don't know where to start, I'm just glad it ended. WORST Mexican food I have had in a while and the service was atrocious. 

Now, most place Mexican places have a little chips and salsa to get you started, but this place didn't. That was OK though, because it was lunch and I didn't want much. It should have been an indicator of what was to come.

After about 10 minutes a waitress finally came over and I ordered a three item combo because I wanted to try a sampling of their fare. I'm glad I did because I don't think I could have eaten a whole plate of one food item. The enchilada had terrible sauce (possibly previously frozen), the carne asada taco was the smallest ever and the tamale was as bland as can be. Beans were awful, but I can say that the rice was OK, but that's about it. Oh, the tomato was great though! 

So, I finished what I could manage to and started to finish reading the CityLife mag I got on the way in while I waited for the check to come. Well, I read the WHOLE THING and never saw anyone! I got up and went up to the counter to pay. I saw why my check never came. The WHOLE staff was standing around laughing and texting. No wonder!

I paid the bill and left without a tip and I ALWAYS tip at least 15%, sometimes 10% if the service is really bad. Ouch!

I figured some of the best ethnic food comes from the hole in the wall places anyway. We walked into the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The interior looked classy and was quite spacious.  We decided to try several of their pupusas ($1.50 ea), in addition I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had their carne asada burrito. The pupusas were very good, and a steal for the price. The rest of the food was not anything special that would warrant coming back.

The service was non existent after our food came out. I ran out of water and pushing my cup damn near off the edge of the table I guess was not enough of a hint that I would like a refill. There were no signs posted that you're suppose to pay at the register anywhere in the restaurant, and maybe that's not the standard procedure, but we ended up going up to the register to pay. It was a fairly inexpensive lunch with solid pupusas and non existent service. I would not go back.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,6,2,2,GNU-LoMjBqmZqbKTRYqmgg

I still come from time to time, sometimes I call in an order and pick it up for lunch. I don't work too far so it's a cheap, convenient meal. The pupusas are really good and a steal at $1.50 each, although I do prefer the revueltas versus the other filling options they offer, they come with a red salsa and curtido (chopped cabbage in vinegar). The platanos fritos con crema y frijol are also really good, I love dipping the plantains in the beans, it's mix of sweetness and saltiness that I can tolerate without being grossed out. To wash your meal down, I recommend an ensalada. It's a homemade fruit drink with little chunks of apple. 

I've never had a problem with service, there is normally a sweet older lady that hands me my order, other times, a younger woman replaces her, let's just say she's not the friendliest, she's very cold in comparison, doesn't smile, and just seems miserable, but she is never rude.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,7,7,4,pYAxXLVdhERCOg2t5Gs6Rg

2862836,2010-08-09,1,oH84VXzObXpaC5ia2Tenpw,"Totally unexpected, in a good way.  First, its looks and a lot of its menu are those of a typical (at least as far as places I know in NYC) Mexican diner, but the staff is Salvadoran.  In addition to the tasty Mexican staples, they are serving up an array of other Latin dishes that make great comfort food, even to those of us who didn't eat them at home.

I had chuletas with rice and beans, as well as some shredded beef tacos, either of which I would recommend to anyone.  Entrees come with a choice of tortillas - go with the handmade ones, you will be as pleased as I was.  GF got the enchiladas, which she was pleased enough with to not offer me a taste.

Portions are a bit large in my opinion; just don't over-order and you'll be fine.  Everything was positively inexpensive, so when you need a fill-up, come to Esmerelda's.",572oYxUrf-chelYblqKw6Q,0,0,4,3kH4hTM22zvfm2yo9yN8ZQ

Overall, the atmosphere is very casual. The good is delicious and very well priced. Chips and salsa always hits the spot. If you stick to a couple pupusas (which also come with the yummy red sauce and the slaw), you can have an entire meal under $10, which is great. 

Again, just assume that it is going to take a little bit longer and you may have to flag down the waitress to get the bill. It is what it is...and totally worth it for the food.",0wSc-4uFM0v55DOT3jTyQA,0,0,5,UHlg1E5rlfUBFHUKswW9zg

We were afraid they wouldn't allow us in because we were covered in color but were glad they let us stay and wash up a bit. 
At first we were not impressed when they brought us our complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were thick and hard and the salsa was very watery. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and my husband ordered the carne asada burrito. We shared 2 cheese pupusas. The enchilada was the best I ever had! The shrimp were abundant and so flavorful. The rice and beans were perfect! I barely had room to eat the pupusa but it was delicious, too. My husband said his meal was also surprisingly good.

4015861,2018-01-05,5,oH84VXzObXpaC5ia2Tenpw,"Esmeralda, you did me wrong girl.

I want to preface this review by saying that the pupusas here are delicious. With that being said, I will never return here because the service was terrible. I'm very sad that I'll never eat those pupusas again, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. RIP Esmeralda's pupusas in my life. Read on about this tragedy.

My friend and I were on the way to a museum when we stopped for what we thought would be a quick bite to eat. The museum we went to is fairly new and I wanted to get there when they opened and get in line before it got too crowded. We saw this place was just around the corner, so we were like ""F yeah we want pupusas!"" so we ended up here. 

Upon entering, it didn't look too crowded for a Saturday around lunch time, yet we waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged. A woman finally saw us and told us to sit whenever. Okay! So, we chose a booth in their lower level seating area and the menus were brought really quickly. That was, I thought, a sign that we would be able to get our food quickly and leave. Wrong! The waitress came back about ten minutes later to take our drink order and we ended up ordering our meal to speed things up. We ordered two horchatas and two pupusas each. Easy. 

The waitress came back quickly with our horchatas(no water offered) and chips and salsa. Horchata was good and as expected, the chips fine and the salsa super watery(maybe that was supposed to be our water?). We were pretty damn hungry so we were into the chips and super watery salsa that dripped all over the place when you tried to scoop some up. Anyway, the chips vanished quickly and we were left with an empty basket and salsa drippings all over the table. We chatted for what seemed like forever until we started checking our phones for the time. It had been about 45 minutes and no pupusas, no offering of water, no refill on the chips. 

One waitress quickly walked passed our table and said our food was coming. I thought maybe directly from El Salvador and that Esmeralda had made the food herself. I was still holding onto hope for an experience turn around. Ten more minutes passed and just as I flagged a waitress down, out came our food. Okay. No offer for refills on our nearly empty horchatas, no water offering either, but she did take our empty sad chip basket away. 

Now like I said, the pupusas were so good. I ordered a cheese and a chicken one and they were both amazing. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. The dough was thick but the filling was a plenty, so there was a nice ratio. Piping hot and super satisfying with the curtido on top. Soooooo good, but were they nearly an hour's wait good? Maybe without the sucky service. 

I flagged down the waitress once more for the check because we had to go. I let my friend have the last sips of my horchata since she was practically choking and we had no drink left. The waitress said I needed to pay at the front, so I went up to the front area and waited for the group ahead of me to pay. I also noticed another waitress ringing up another party on the other side of the counter and he was complaining about the long ass wait for food, so it wasn't just us. I thought ""maybe just a bad day"" and proceeded to get my total(about $12) from the woman at the register and hand her my card. ""Declined"". Nope and I told her as much. She tried again. ""Declined"". So, this annoyed me obviously, but I remained calm. I explained that it was not declined but she could try another card. That didn't work either. She tried one of her own cards and that didn't work. Yeah, not declined, yo. 

So, we find out the credit card machine is having issues. I have no cash, so I asked if she has a manual credit card machine(you know, the old school carbon copy crunchers?). She said no and runs off to check the power or something at the far wall. I stood there a bit dumbfounded for a few minutes because this experience is bizarre. She comes back and tells me ""It isn't working"". Yep, got that. I said I could come back after I go to the bank later but I had somewhere to be. She tells me to go to the liquor store ATM a few doors down(and pay a fee? No.) My friend and I got into my car and drove off. Now now, calm down y'all because I did eventually pay(I don't mess with karma by being a heathen) by mailing them payment but I was not going to pay a liquor store ATM fee. Plus I was already late to where I needed to be after this jenky lunch experience.

To sum it up: Divine pupusas but I will never return. I did not feel welcome because the lack of customer service, the wait time was ridiculous, and I was genuinely put off by how the credit card machine issue was approached. Onto the next pupusa place.",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,6,2,2,s9x39zsNetelr7ZnZ1l5NA

The service is hit or miss, mostly miss. The waitresses just don't check up on tables. And your left on your own to guess where to pay.

Now on to the food. My latest dish I tried was the grilled steak topped with onions and some type of red sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and it was a good portion. The red sauce was not spicy and it had an interesting flavor. I was surprised. It was $9.99, and came with rice and refried beans, and a small portion of lettuce tomato and cucumber. 

In the past, I have had the shredded beef burrito served enchilada style (awesome), the shrimp soup (not really filling), and the machaca--seasoned shredded beef over fried eggs. The beef was good. 

I noticed they started serving chips and salsa. I wonder if they have been reading the reviews. Also, diet soda comes in a can with a side cup of ice. They have the coke in a bottle ad well. 

Haven't tried the pupusas yet. The beans are not remarkable but the rice is pretty good. My friend always says the portions aren't big enough, but he's a guy, so go figure.

I ordered one cheese and one chicken pupusa and they were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the pork and he really loved it. We also got a side of fried yuca which was awesome, and a side of plantains, crema, and beans - the mix of this was great. I'm not sure if I'd like beans alone though. I enjoyed the food enough to say I will come here again. We left very satisfied!",bvPS4vrfiO7ZZ4KAo8KBTw,0,0,4,UrCTKObAC_1IgsEAAEP-VQ
