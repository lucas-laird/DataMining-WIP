That's what happened to me when I ordered the regular ol' eggs, sausage patty & potatoes breakfast.  Sure they give you a lot of food for breakfast, but it better be considering what they're charging.

The service was also pretty damn slow.  The waitress was nice and all, but she comes across somewhat fake and insincere.

My boyfriend and I arrived at the Rio Hotel about 9am and was told check in was not till 4pm......... 0___0"" we were so hungry from a our flight from Hawaii and we were really tired and just wanted to relax. We walked around the hotel and all the restaurants we found were CLOSED. We were so disappointed and didn't know what we were going to do. Finally we found Sao Paulo Caf√©. 

Thank goodness this restaurant is open for breakfast. I ordered Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the gravy all over I believe. I felt like the service here was a bit slow, because it took them awhile to just bring out our waters. Along with that both our meals took a little while to come out (or maybe it just felt like awhile be cause we were so tired and hungry).

We both had coffee and it came out to be $30. 

The food and service was good but, I don't like having limited choices. There is no food court at the Rio where you can get an inexpensive breakfast.

I thought eating here would spare me the dregs of convention luncheon fare. What I got was convention luncheon fare, except I had to pay for it.

You probably cannot go wrong with the standard ""burgers 'n shit,"" but steer well clear of the spaghetti and meatballs and the fruit plate. Don't even *look* at the pseudo-chinese food list on the back side of the menu. $11 for congee?? Come on.

Now, I didn't order the spag and meatballs, that was a business partner. He's a young guy and sometimes young guys aren't too picky as long as they are full. But even he told me afterwards the food was really bad.
I got the fruit plate and it was exactly like convention fruit plates. Crunchy cantaloupe, browning bananas, tasteless strawberries.  But there was no other place to go in the time we had to eat.

Finally, business partner thought the staff working there seemed a little lackluster. I said their eyes showed soul-crushing disappointment in the neverending tedium of serving cafeteria food as a profession to desperate gamblers and exhausted convention-goers. Maybe that is the same as lackluster, but I try to be creative.

Oh, and my water glass and silverware smelled like eggs.",qunxFdBDVl0ordRJEPVNtQ,2,2,2,SKS49MtDvFZ8TTqAP830lw

The staff was just for shit...slow, understaffed, not friendly, and I think barely spoke English as they got my drink order wrong.  I know I was not the only person who had a terrible experience that day or during the ensuing conference that week.

I ordered a panini and my boyfriend got a fried shrimp dish, both dishes came out pretty good and surprisingly quick. The menu was limited due to the WSOP, but the prices were reasonable for what you get. There was another line to pay upon exiting, but it's Vegas, there seems to be lines everywhere.

A bit over-priced but hey, that's Vegas

Good gut-busting food. The country fried steak and gravy hit the sweet spot of full and sleepy and happy. The gravy was rich and thick. I ordered coffee and they left a hot pot at the table. Nice touch.

There was a customer who left, complaining that one of the waiting staff made a smart-ass comment. I'm not sure if this is symptomatic of Sao Paolo or the Rio (I'm never staying there again), but my server was very nice. 

If I find myself stuck at the Rio again (please, God, no!) I'll definitely consider going back to Sao Paolo.",NFoSLHwFmjeA1eJrkxNrlQ,2,1,3,yDY2tK3fFgn561e8yffo7A

The meal was disappointing because there was really no way to say it was homemade and that it wasn't any better than out of a can.  It appears what they do is take chunks of corned beef and put it into a food processor to make it like hamburger.  They mix in some diced potatoes and then saute.  They don't make it crispy, so it's got a consistency of oatmeal.  The flavor was okay and I can tell it was real brisket ground up, but the presentation and texture was just so far from ""homemade"" that I had to tell the waitress they need to remove that homemade label on the menu. My previous reviews indicate I should have gone someplace else, but I had no time to drive someplace and I didn't want to do the buffet...

I ordered the chicken fried steak, and as Dave S. commented, they didn't plate it like it normally is.  It came as chicken fried steak, topped with cheese scrambled eggs, biscuits & gravy on the side.  No gravy on the chicken fried steak?!  What the...?

The gravy was good, thick & tasty with bits of bacon.  I tried to finish it because it was sooo yummy, but in the end I took it to go and noshed on it the next day before our early morning flight back home (sans silverware! haha).
