Rice bowls are convenient but the kalbi and bugolki box sets (bento? Doshirak?) are very filling.  
Refillable soda for $1 makes eating in a plus.  
Not a common place to find korean food.  Great stop for lunch while waiting for car services.
Ask for side of kimchi if they haven't run out.",UGzG7JupCO6GRsxNNJBjIQ,1,1,5,M-B-NnhiRkGnj23LgLV0OQ

2185481,2017-01-26,0,gV9qWwd4eU8GffyuvQ4hwg,I really liked how fresh the food was. The owners do not use MSG or even granulated sugar; they use pineapple juice instead.  A thoroughly pleasant meal and the owners are super friendly. This is definitely my new favorite Korean restaurant.,05KZrRKUbHfYzeiH-N7BQg,0,0,5,YmsXvBVZw5ykv-tl30k87A

The service: is absolutely perfect. I was greeted by the owners daughter working the register ( Monique?) Maybe I'm not pronouncing it correctly. She was very happy to answer all my questions. I asked how long was this place opened ( less than 2 months ) and I asked about the special of the day ( chicken teriyaki bowl ) so after I ordered my meal I was observing the kitchen and seen the chef in the back cooking on a flat top grille. So I can tell you that the chicken is cook to order. The chef is also the owner (she's a sweet heart) she give me some kimchi she prepared and also she let me try a crab shrimp egg roll and a home made sweet and sour sauce. 

I know that the heading was service but I had to explain how friendly and professional the owner and her daughter is. In order for you to get the full effect

Taste/ flavor: authentic Korean. okay so little bit about me I am into big bold flavors I love the taste of sriracha soy sauce and oyster black bean sauce. Especially when it comes to Asian Cuisine. I didn't expect to see a Teriyaki Bowl what a bunch of vegetables and chicken look so simple. The owner / chef came out and explained her dish to me. Like something you see on the Food Network. She told me that she don't like the flavor of soy sauce to her it's yucky lol. She made the sauce from scratch that was on the Teriyaki Bowl it was very mild but yet flavorful very subtle flavors. But the kimchi was some of the best I ever had very fresh crisp and delicious( I'm not a kimchi fan) the crab shrimp a Eggroll I was telling you about that was on the house was also very good.

Sorry for the wall of text I am doing this from my phone not my computer


Overall very clean environment.

My critique would be that the place is disorganized and a bunch of boxes and stuff laying all over the place. Given they're just moving in but it's been 2 months the place should be more organized. 


I would give 5 Stars if the place was more organized had some better seating and decor",rn0sbjR0GuyZStj6QEETXg,0,0,4,W40htAjenf8JdpMFjLehpA

This placed closed,  I have been there before and thought that they might be closed for a week or so but the same sign is in the window saying Closed in July and to go to another place by Craig & Revere.  As of 09/21/17,  there is a For Lease sign in the same window.  I guess they never reopened.",cy4CP4shM8hCXnU7BOwxSg,1,0,1,bqRJ0ktBeuq6xc7Ct5Og4w
5290963,2017-05-23,0,gV9qWwd4eU8GffyuvQ4hwg,"Spam musubi was really good. The sauce on the spam was on point. We also got the ono chicken bowl, which was small but only $6 and came with a drink. It was good too nice sweet and tangy fried chicken. But the fried rice plate was not very good. In fact, it tasted really weird. I'm not sure what seasonings they used but it really was not appetizing, I couldn't eat it after a while. I hope they change up their recipe.",nc0Tz2DEKEcbuNnwre_igA,1,0,3,OVCiGuZS92bygdzJMdGD6g

You couldn't meet a nicer group of people than the staff at this place and the food...well let's just say I'm planning my next visit already. A friend of mine had told me about a place that makes awesome butter mochi in various flavors, and that's initially what intrigued me. The meat jun I ordered today was hands down, the best I've ever eaten. The sweet flavor of the tender meat, the savory egg, and the mildly smooth sauce made me sit down to give this dish my full attention. The portion was huge! The japchae was so flavorful and enriched with the crunchy textures of the vegetables. I also bought some cascarones to try for the first time since they didn't have butter mochi on hand. They were delicious in flavor and texture. The chef here described them as butter mochi that's been fried, and that's very accurate. You still get the super chewy mochi texture but with an added crispy outside. I'm in a food coma now and still have leftovers in the fridge. I'm seriously going back in the next few days to see what other wonders I can discover.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,1,5,OESRFHeYE2_Nr9kBFfKGRw
