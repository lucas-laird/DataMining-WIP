I was going to pass on it at first because I packed a lunch, and I never really like the food trucks that normally come. But oh my! I ordered the Fried Catfish with a side of potato salad, and when I say I wanted everybody in the building to know about it, I WANTED EVERYBODY to know. I gave out a few bites of mine and sent a memo to those that were not already aware this food is DELISH. Catfish made to order and the sides are good just the way they're served. The customer service was great and they are very event savvy, with tips on local gatherings.

I hope they come back, but I will find them if they don't. LoL **A MUST TRY**",Mu5-XuedcXU8P7ecoTuUdA,3,0,5,VHZNYLc5nC4hq-7PgH2xEQ
2654853,2018-03-25,0,L_rnF5qiCYSu9d1yIv5Cvw,Saw their truck for the first time here in front of Liquor World (southern highlands). Ordered the catfish and man...I wish I had ordered more. The catfish is just the way I like it - lightly breaded in the outside and tender and flaky on the inside. Added a little hot sauce and I loved it.,0hzlPsl1edGLSuCYDnlIhQ,0,0,5,TZSDRH6VMAWhsoDTetX6UQ

It is a good truck, I'm wondering if they have an actual restaurant somewhere because it was great, and well priced for what I got. Totaled to about $10 for 5 pieces of catfish (well seasoned, crispy but soft), Mac and cheese, and potato salad. Service was fast and food came out hot!",fj-cFMD2qheCcv3FNvMcEg,1,1,5,Cnw-JGE1PFuKSjmpp5gprQ

Well, it was amazing. The flavors were all there and the fish was cooked perfectly. The portions were perfect. I had enough to fill me up and take home. The family was extremely welcoming when I was standing there trying to figure out what to eat.",LxRx0S-LJHcVhgu9D8JEYA,1,0,5,QkztqipbiNcfChdTms61qQ
