127556,2016-05-16,0,SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q,First time ordering from this place and it will be the last. The sesame chicken had every part of the dark meat chicken grizzle and all. The fried rice had long pieces of dark meat which tasted terrible (we didn't eat it). I love egg rolls and can always eat them but not these. Big pieces of cabbage and some other stuff that was uncooked Took a bite and this big piece falls out not even packed inside the egg roll tight. It by far was the worse 40 dollars I spent . Panda Express beats them all over and that is saying something when franchise beats fresh cooked.,eqd1u6oE1Y-5usU_Zfyi_g,0,0,1,6LvzE3_-NfeA1X6Zs2Yx7Q

We found this place by accident while helping my brother move from his apartment to his house. We were in charge of picking up food. That was 3 years ago. Since then we've been going to China A GoGo for our chinese-fast food cravings. 

Okay so we don't frequently go out to eat. Only when we don't have anything else to eat at home OR we're sick of eating my cooking. =D

The reason why we keep going to China A GoGo is:
1) Very generous portions, especially when you order combos.
2) Variety of foods. There is plenty to choose from on the menu. They even serve Pad Thai.
3) Food is cooked to order and not placed on a warming dish.
4) Prices are pretty cheap.
5) It's nearby.

We prefer their food to Panda Express and the Grand China which is on the other side of Durango (and Warm Springs). I hear that the Henderson location is a lot better. We may have to take a trip there one day to see if it's true.",wdM3JAF4T6W4EQH4B2SxZQ,1,0,3,La6BJHwCGusaC27ryrCdfg

We looked over the menu and found that they have a pretty huge selection of different dishes so finding something that we would like was not hard at all and the prices are very reasonable. 

We ended up getting Cashew Chicken and Mongolian Beef, so we took a seat and waited for our food and they ended up delivering the food to the table in what appears to be the only serving dishes they have which is a styro-foam container. So my first thought was oh no, maybe its so bad that they want you to take it home to eat so you wont complain. So we both opened our container and the steam came up and hit us in the face and once the steam cleared out of our face we took in the portion size and were very content since we were starving. 

We grubbed on the food and it was fresh ingredients and tasted awesome. The portions were huge and we ended up both taking the rest of the food home for dinner.

Update. The driver remembered me, so that was real nice. He was always personable.
The food quality and taste where not what they used to be. I order the Twice spicy cooked chicken and it was over run with hot red peppers to the point it was almost inedible. The bbq fried rice was awesome though. 
The next week I ordered mushu chicken. It was more like mushu chicken soup. I wound up putting the whole container in a colander to drain all the excess liquid. I wasn't happy at all. 
I gave Gogo one more chance after that, hoping they just had a bad night two (its real hard to find decent Chinese food out here). I kept my fingers crossed.
I was heart broken. I ordered fried wontons, bbq sliced pork, and chicken with broccoli.
The fried wontons were not crispy, in fact they were very soggy and mushy. The bbq sliced pork was like chewing leather . After eating 4 pieces I had to throw it out. The chicken and broccoli had so much ginger in it. It tasted like I was eating soap. 
I will not be eating from here again.

Ordered a Lunch combo orange chicken and a buddah's delight for dinner.

Wow...just wow...where to begin...lets start on the outside of the plate and work ourselves inward.

Crab Ragoons
Since when is it acceptable for Krab (imitation crab made from fish) to be called Crab?  Other then the imitation crab used but real crab named these were pretty decent green onions in the cream cheese gave it some flavor, soft and crunchy. Crab as well as Krab both virtually nonexistent.

Orange Chicken Lunch Combo
Blandest noodles ever, they have a fried look but a 'just boiled' taste. yummy....
Orange Chicken itself....nothing to write home about. if i didn't actually look at each individual hunk of chicken and noticed that it's coated in sauce i would have assumed they missed some spots going by taste alone.
Fried rice, dont want to bore anybody you see where this review is going.

And now the rant....the lunch combo includes a soup but not for takeout orders. So...I pay the same price as someone who eats in but i'm denied something i paid for...Now i can understand the whole 'to go fast food' concept which is why it's not offered but at least give the customer the option. It doesnt even have to be in bowls resulting in an increase in dishes to wash, why not use small disposable coffee cups? Let the customer sip on some soup while they wait for the food to cook. They do advertise 'Fresh to Order' nothing's sitting under a heating lamp, the time between placing an order and picking up an order could be spent sipping on soup rather then thinking to yourself 'did the guy even greet me when i walked in?'",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,0,2,bav1-XA0-BnTEPQzGB4eAg

Every single item was either deepfried or covered in a sauce loaded with extra sugar, guai lo style.

I got the appetizer sampler which was just several versions of slightly different shaped, bland, tasteless, deep fried eggroll and wonton-ish looking things - dripping with oil.

Ordered the salt and pepper pork chop because of another yelp review and also they list it as Chef's special.  These turned out to be double breaded and deep fried pieces of pork with a ton of bone still on.  Some pieces was just deep fried bone. And the extra, extra, extra breading they coat it with is completely bland and tasteless.  I think they should call it the NO SALT OR PEPPER pork chop.

I also ordered the Kung Pao chicken ""extra spicy please"".  Aside from a couple of stray peppers, the dish had zero heat.  It was also chock full of zucchini.  Loooooootttts of zucchini.  They should've called it Kung Pao Zucchini with a couple little pieces of dry chicken breast.  And this dish was not seasoned at all - nothin'.  No salt, not even a little MSG.

The only dish that was passable was the young chow fried rice.  Good enough, not oily, but once again completely underseasoned.

3397269,2014-03-31,0,SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q,"We were craving Chinese food and looked up places in Chinatown but most closed at 10pm or earlier so we were out of luck on a sit down place. We were looking for something like the Great Wall: old, dark lighting, booth seating, authentic, with great hot tea. We didn't see anything that fit the bill so we decided to eat in, because there's nothing I dislike more than eating at the newer Chinese restaurants with a tiny storefront and a couple of wooden tables to sit and eat. Since China GoGo is closest to us, and we've had their food before, we knew it would satisfy our food craving. In the past, delivery sometimes gets a bit mixed up, so we chose to pick up. 


1. Ordered food around 9pm on Friday night, they said it would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes! Talk about quick service! Very impressed with that.

2. Arrived and the order was perfect, everything was packed. I appreciate their attention to detail. 5 stars for service, ease, attention to detail, & convenience 

2. Ordered Family Dinner B and Combo noodles, chow mein, I think. 

The fatter noodles, chow mein combo, it was greasier than I liked, but the chicken and shrimp were tender. It needed extra soy sauce, the flavor could definitely be amped up in their noodles, so that was a minus. I'd say 2.5 stars for the noodles. Not awful, not great.

I got the Shrimp with Snow Peas, my fave, the shrimp were tender, portion was huge and for fast food style Chinese, I was very happy. The dish had more flavor than the noodles. Came with white rice and the rice was done right. Overall, a 4 star for what it is.

Boyfriend got the Beef Hunan,,crispy spicy beef. He usually gets Mo Gillian Beef but doesn't like their version. Loves PF Chang's with green beans instead of onions. YUM! But not from China GoGo, so he tried something new to us both. I tasted it and was surprised, reminded me of a sweet/spicy friend boneless  chicken I've had before from somewhere, but can't remember where. It was flavorful;  too spicy though, if you really want spicy this isn't for you. The one problem is the cornstarch breaking had a weird mouthfeel. Don't know what that was about kind of chalky. I would give the dish a 3.5 stars for Hunan Beef. Again, the rice was good.

Corn egg flower Soup was included. It was bland, not as good as I've had before. 2.5 stars for the soup. 

Family Dinner B Came with fried shrimp, eggrolls and crab Rangoon. We didn't get enough of the sweet dipping sauce, minus points. I had a nite of each, enjoyed the egg roll, the fried shrimp were crisp but greasy, the Rangoon were yummy. Overall score for these were 3.5, because we needed more sauce and the grease factor. 

4) I give them 3.5 stars overall, better than a 3 for the service and convenience. They lost points for some blandness, sparse serving of dipping sauce  & too much grease of some dishes. However, the food seems fresh, the value is great. You get a LOT of food for your money. Our bill was $40 for everything, and I think this is what you expect when you want fast food Chinese!",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,1,0,3,9hOoTM3SHVoe02SpioBqEA

I made the mistake of avoiding this place because it doesn't look very appealing from the outside. I'm glad I finally went in and gave it a try. There is a well balanced menu with lots of great options.

I was surprised by how quickly my food came out. It was served incredibly hot (the way I like it), even when I got the food home, there was steam rising from the box.

I tried the hot garlic chicken and subbed the mushrooms with jalapeños. I ordered it extra spicy because that's what I'm about. I tend to think places believe their food is spicy enough and ignore my request. Not this place. My food was wonderfully spicy and full of robust flavor.

I definitely recommend getting the individual meal, it costs a little more money but it's worth it. Along with your meal you get a pretty big serving of soup and two delicious spring rolls.

I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.

There was only one time they messed up on my order, they forgot to put my potstickers when I ordered takeout, but I just called them and they said I could come pick it up again or just come back the next day for a refund. Since it was late I picked it up the next day. 
Other than that, they have good chinese food if you want it quick but good quality. The fact that it is cooked fresh in front of you once you order it is a good thing, nothing like panda express where they have their food sitting out in the open under the heat.

  In the future, this China Go Go location looks like it will be a China No Go. I left extremely disappointed.

   First, I felt they overcharged me. If the pepper steak lunch special is $6.89 and a Coke is $1.50, how did it end up $9.70? But, why sweat over the small stuff? You live once. However, the big stuff was that the food wasn't good. In all honesty, the Chinese food I eat in a Feast Buffet is better.

  A red flag that the quality was lacking here was when the egg drop soup was placed on my table a couple of minutes after sitting down, with the pepper steak immediately after. Please give me time to enjoy the soup. Yeah, the food came fast. But it was lacking in quality and reminded me more of fast food than a good Chinese restaurant.

   In recent times I have been to several Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. I can tell the difference in quality just from the pepper steak. The peppersteak here was lacking in the flavor and ingredients that I have been accustomed to lately in the Chinese restaurants that I have dined in. For example XO Chinese Restaurant down the road and China Wan Wan on Boulder Highway, served me pepper steak that would make me drive out of my way to have it. Here, the pepper steak was lacking flavor and pieces of it had a rubbery taste. Here, the fried rice lacked flavor where down the road XO served some of the finest fried rice that I have had in Las Vegas. And the chow mein noodles that seemed to take up over a third of the styrophone bowl was filler that lacked flavor. It was nothing like the lo mein noodles side that Chop Stix on Mark's Street in Henderson recently served me with far superior pepper steak. Even the chow mein noodles at Panda Express is far better. Finally, the Coke tasted funky and I would pour it out and complement the food with Mr Pibb.

  Customer service is also lacking here. I remember the people working in the Locosee Road China Go Go being personable. And the people working in the Alicante Parkway and the Windmill Parkway China Go Go's were nicer workers serving better food.

  In the future this China Go Go is a China No Go for at least a year.  There are far better Chinese restaurants and better China Go Go's for me to spend my hard earned money.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,7,2,mVxRWOz5WP_Ul_NoH8gPIQ

4700899,2015-03-27,5,SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q,"The bae and I ordered the family dinner A.
The lady at the counter is VERY accommodating to my boyfriends needs. He always seems to complicate things when we eat out. Anyway!

Dinner A; comes with egg rolls (2), crab rangoons (2), soup of your choice, rice of your choice and two entrees of your choice.

My boyfriend wanted to replace the two egg rolls with two more crab rangoons. The lady was very sweet and said I'll give you the egg rolls for free. And she also added four more crab rangoons for free. So we had six crab rangoons in total. How sweet of her???
There were also two entrees to choose from. I picked the Mongolian beef and of course my boyfriend wanted something else that wasn't on the list of entrees. He asked if he can get the teriyaki chicken entree instead. And that's what he got! You can also choose from white rice or BBQ pork fried rice. Obviously, I got the BBQ pork fried rice (If you haven't seen my pictures yet.) and lastly we got the egg drop soup. Yum!!! One of my choosings!!! I also ordered my thai tea. 

Now, I've been fasting for the last week or so. So I only eat at night! #carbnite I'm not sure if it was because I haven't ate all day but damn, the Mongolian beef was good :p and the soup and the teriyaki chicken and everything else. I definitely was satisfied! Especially the amount of food that was given. We had leftovers... Well, the bae had left overs. He finished everything by that night. I was so full. I couldn't eat anymore!
And I almost forgot... The Thai tea. If you know me, I like thai tea a lot. But this one not so much. It lacked flavor. So I didn't finish it and ended up throwing it away. Overall, everything was good. Service was good too. We didn't wait so long. Food was really hot! I enjoyed it. Will be coming back (:

I am kind of weird. If I want Chinese I normally go to the buffet. This place is the only exception to that rule.

Lets commence with the actual store. The location is very clean and organized. I am surprised that they have so many staff members being that is it kind of small. (maybe they have the whole family)

My favorite dish here is egg fu yung! I tried it for the first time ever, and was shocked at what I had been missing out on. The use actual gravy at China A GoGo. (other places use what looks like Teriyaki sauce)

Over all the fried rice was really good as well. Other places offer free egg rolls when you order so much food. In which case I do!  This particular locations doesn't. (which is whatever you know)

With the delivery charge and tax our total was $30.08 + driver's tip
We had a coupon for a free order of Fried Rice with a $25 purchase so we had them throw that in as well. The ordering was quick and easy; the communication with the staff which often can be tricky with these places was actually good.

The food was steaming hot and delivered fast! (Although we don't live very far away.) Everything arrived in cute little Chinese takeout boxes, along with chopsticks, soy sauce, hot mustard and fortune cookies.

There was A TON of food, I felt we really got our money's worth, enough to feed 4 people, and more than 2 people needed for sure!

The Hot and Sour Soup came in a large container and was delicious! Had shrimp and crab in it and came with noodles on the side that you could add.

The Egg Rolls were nothing special, wouldn't order them on their own. Vegetable only, no meat inside.

The Crab Rangoons were average. I generally like these but it's more for the cream cheese than anything. These were just okay.

The BBQ Pork Fried Rice wasn't my favorite, I'm not a huge pork fan, I would have preferred regular fried rice myself but again it wasn't bad.

The General Tso's Chicken was terrific, I kept piling more and more on my plate which says a lot for a non-Chinese fast food eater! the breading on the chicken was soft not hard like you often find. It was spicy, had green peppers, red chili peppers, carrots, onions and pineapple. Yum!

The Mongolian Beef was excellent as well. Thin strips of Beef which I always appreciate, onion strings & chili peppers. This dish was spicy too!

I love spicy food but I ended up with the hiccups  because I kept having to hold my breath. LOL

Lastly today we ordered delivery and not only did it take 1 hour and 15 mins to get here (it's a five min drive) it was spilled all over the bag when it did get here.",BhArlMF5NCpgZ75d27QcgA,0,0,1,rI-_0p2Xipzba_QhGFLdMg

The pork fried rice was okay. It was worth a try, but only one.",4C_JFKgEo15R2eJa1s4vTw,0,0,2,eTfuwBnXvRZCdTdwYisMYw

But there is nothing special about it.  I had the (soggy) potstickers, corn egg flower soup and the shrimp with lobster sauce. About a cup too much salt for me. If I go back I'll ask for no salt!",uvHuljQFVMVLUt9VPV__uQ,0,0,3,1gLiDA9UUIruHhqeatB8fQ

The pork strips are actually really good, this is why they got more than 2 stars from me, but don't call a spring roll an egg roll-I SOOO miss egg rolls as they have been largely replaced with Spring rolls-if you want to know what I mean by egg roll go to Von's and get Chung's Pork Egg Rolls in the freezer section-THOSE ARE REAL HUNAN EGG ROLLS. I also am baffled why they do not have pork dumplings but rather opt for chicken pot stickers (pan fried pork ""ravioli"" or dumplings are the best). By and large their meal menu is pretty thorough I can say the Szechuan beef is good, sweet and sour pork is also really good. I'm disappointed that their appetizer menu is very limited and a bit atypical. On the final odd plus is they offer Thai Tea (its sweetened milk tea-MUST TRY). I think many reviewers are a bit harsh, this restaurant doesn't pretend to be high end cuisine-it's fast food Chinese at a pricier level than Panda Express but also offers more authentic cuisine than a Panda Express.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,3,jOy28jdHqCHmCTRLhNgknw

Went there twice since I've been here in Vegas and the food was perfect both times. Good healthy food and portions, prices are reasonable.",jEr99iuvhTgdKS8-NyMvaA,1,1,4,wbQ-3GaCEbLeXrijiXVmmA
