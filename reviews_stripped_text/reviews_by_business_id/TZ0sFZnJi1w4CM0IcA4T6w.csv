1154617,2017-10-28,0,TZ0sFZnJi1w4CM0IcA4T6w,I came here for the first about a month ago and i was looking for tacos and i have to admit there tacos are delightful flavorful and not too pricey. But theres only one downside to this place there restaurant smells like straight bathrooms like there sewer lines are all fucked up from the time i went to open the front door to the time i left i swear the whole restaurant stinks so bad i suggest if you eat here order to go because i wouldn't want to eat in a place that smells bad,ab_9OHrMmAwCNGO94c3_lA,0,0,3,j1jGPz5EhOojSyiQYTOy_Q

1718822,2017-03-19,0,TZ0sFZnJi1w4CM0IcA4T6w,"I've been to this place several times and the same experience occurs every time. Food is good, but the employees always seem like they just don't want your business. The business hours listed online are not correct, they always close early. Forget about calling in for a pick up order. They take the phone order(which is taken by a lady that can barely speak English), but don't respect their customers enough to make the food before you get there. They don't make the food until after you pay no matter. So, calling in is pointless because you still have to wait the same amount of time when you get there. It's just a funny way they run their business. I will still continue to go here because I like their food and it's down the street from my house, but customer service is NO BUENO!",4_blbamcfMqwpwhQcQxNcg,1,0,1,6Lesfex7ZnMY8_3GO9NwBA
1801922,2012-07-02,0,TZ0sFZnJi1w4CM0IcA4T6w,"The amount of random taco shops in Vegas is quite daunting. Usually the shredded beef is a safe bet on an initial visit because it might not always be the best, but there is less of a chance of fatty meat appearing than say the Carne Asada. Anyway, i ordered three $1.25 tacos of that beef and this was actually really flavorful stuff loaded onto double corn tortillas and grilled with a few peppers and tomatoes (unusual). There was no sauce on top, but cilantro and chopped onions topped off the tacos. They really put alot of beef on them and three will last you awhile especially if you load up on the cold radishes (not green either) and the kinda spicy carrots. Red and green salsa were traditional. Almost five stars, but the walls were kinda dirty next to my booth. Still a great lunch for 4 bucks.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,3,0,4,JImVIsuE55y7m9mvQ_GaiA
1911497,2010-03-03,0,TZ0sFZnJi1w4CM0IcA4T6w,UPDATE 3/3/10:  Recently went back and tried their chicken quesadilla and ceviche tostada.  Both were excellent! Serving sizes are generous and food quality is way above average.  Still highly recommended!,k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,2,0,4,H7rWgYKAWWnQ779-s1CBTw

Look I get it, ""craft tacos"" are super cool right now, but every now and then I want a taco made with love, lard, and a possible an old family recipe. So far, I have yet to come across this in the Valley. I had high hopes Tacos Los Toritos especially after seeing their four star rating, but alas it was just flavorless tacos, refried beans from a can, and overcooked rice. This meal could have a been a ""Taco Tuesday"", lunch special at the local junior high cafeteria. 

I ordered the taco & burrito meal, with carnitas. The taco was ok, made street style with two small corn tortillas, seared onions, and carnitas. The tortilla was not house made, but it did hold together while I ate my taco. The carnitas were juicy, but lacked flavor and crunch. To my understanding carnitas are cooked until tender then seared in a hot pan to get them a little crispy. I know this sounds picky, but most taco shops get this right, but unfortunately this was not the case at Tacos Los Toritos. 

The burrito was more of the same, flavorless meat and canned beans, more beans than meat by the way. The was size ok, but does that matter if the taste doesn't match the size? I did however like their green verde salsa, this was very good and I drenched most of my food in this green mixture of tamatillos, chilis and spices. 

Sad to say I will not be coming back to Tacos Los Toritos. My search for a quality taco shop in Vegas continues!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,2,3,2,W7ZOzel2MqCll9EmcXyeVg

Their burritos are full of beans and rice.  I just want the meat!",zbRjeEkON8EXFk_VrcTAiA,0,0,3,RTK08pDYZjA5N6k3G3I-Xg
3029517,2010-10-01,1,TZ0sFZnJi1w4CM0IcA4T6w,"For Las Vegas it's great! When I saw that there was a Los Toritos tacos here I was so happy! and sketchy because I wanted to know if they tasted as good as the one here where I used to live. I ate the food and oh man it was real good! Iv'e ate gorditas, taco de asad, buche, carnitas, tortas, burrito. Everything tastes REAL GOOD! Good location, plenty of parking. Close to my HOUSE! The retsaurant is clean and big. It came out to be a whole lot better than the one in my home town! Want to know why? Because went I went back to my home town and ate here, I loved the flavor of the other Los Torritos restaurant! 

  Good prices, I think it is a lot cheaper than the one in L.A. Not so sure on that, but will check it. The food comes out fast so no worries there. Alright amount of people there all the time so you know it's good. Never have gone to the bathroom tho, I avoid that... Now after living in L.A for 21 yrs and to be convinced by another restaurant in the family... Now that's a work out! Eating of course... So I aften came to place whenever I could not find any better mexican food. They place was a real life saver for me and my family lol.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,1,2,5,OB98yE8MkyLLhBjffNHvjw

I was there for the Interbike convention and the first two days where spent riding very expensive bikes in the hot hills of Boulder, after the second day I really wanted something basic...  A taco.  A plate of tacos!  So I headed south from the Sands where I dropped off a bike and departed my buddies, I remember some eat places over on Flamingo so I thought I'd find the same on Sands Blvd.  Not the case.

I passed this strip mall and saw a sign that featured tacos, I dove for the lot!  ""Tacos Los Toritos"" is a medium size place, the seating was limited to one half the place as one of the workers was scrubbing down the floor of the other half, love that Pine-Sol!!

Good size menu with lots of choices, but I knew I needed tacos pronto so I ordered up from the sweet semi-bilingual girl behind the counter.  4 carnitas tacos...  And an orange pop, Jarritos, which I love!  This plate reminded me of home near Highland Park and all the taco trucks to choose from.

Tacos hit the spot and all was had for $7 bucks...  I needed to conserve funds as I didn't fair so well at the tables, so, this place was key in more ways than one!  Well, just 2 stars because I've had tastier pork, the salsa was also more on the tame side.  If I ever stop here again I'll ask for hotter salsa.  Oh, and as I walked to my truck I caught the eye of a girl walking on the sidewalk...  HOOKER!  lol",7SQJKdtty2xDXFPD4aSBZg,2,2,2,lzDRdH4nj1Nzf08qUoxu7g
4601968,2013-06-09,1,TZ0sFZnJi1w4CM0IcA4T6w,"Great spot for late night eats. The carne asada tacos were street taco size, and were filled with delicious marinated beef. They were $1.50 each. We also had some horchata, which wasn't super sweet like how other kinds can get, and was very cool and refreshing. I didn't see any hours posted on the door, but we were there on a Saturday night at 11 P.M. and they were still open.",DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog,2,1,4,8_htuppQgr5s2d27Muk5Yg

Tacos de Burris is my favorite item though..all their tacos are good, their burritos, their Tortas are great, the Menudo is to die for. An acquired taste if youve never had it. But if it's cooked right, it's the bomb. And theirs is the bomb. Their tripe is cleaned right and cooked right where it melts in your mouth. Their aquas, or fresh fruit waters are made in house. Recommend this one highly.",v4WB-qGb4mSIOilHK6i-xg,0,0,5,IkDFgPK7AfWC7zUdM1CE7g

The way authentic mexican food should be.  Steak Quesadilla well meaty and cheesy.  When in Vegas again its my new home town place to eat.,bo5YWQgHX5rNDib121oD1A,1,1,5,TXW51RLVWH8l2XSBKK6taw

I had the torta with everything on it and it was pretty good! Nice size, and will definitely fill you up. Plus I liked the way they made it- not sloppy at all. The guacamole was so tasty too. I had to try the horchata, but I was disappointed as it wasn't very sweet and they didn't mixed it very well, Roberto's horchata is way better. Overall, this is a good place for a quick bite :)",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,1,3,kr36_TwddfGGWmQ1p8aM3w

I've found the burritos are actually better the next day after being in the fridge all night (I think it just gives them time to come together).  Are there better Mexican places in this town? Yup, but this place is an inexpensive, reliable place to grab some food, especially later in the evening after a few drinks.",Kh95vaUIj_NCSbYmWMAiyQ,0,0,3,8cNN_tPtcRhIhxCUXQbr0w

this is the best local taqueria i've been to in vegas.

you know you've hit upon a good taco spot when you're the only white chick in the joint and the 2 mexican guys in front of you in line are wearing cowboy hats and singing along with the awful mexican music on the jukebox.  telemundo all day long!
