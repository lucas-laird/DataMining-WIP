Not because it was to much, it was only a 5 inch sandwich, but because the bread was discussing. It did not taste right. Not sure if it was day old bread or what but I will be going to another location next time.",ZyclVIL3nE3G2GmYRL_uLQ,0,0,2,vvnV1USYzj0VfrX6e03TaA

Water was leaking from the ceiling in several places.  It dripped on my back a few times while ordering until I finally realized and looked up.  I ordered two extra large sandwiches, they made three.  I have never seen a store skimp on the meat as much as this place.  You give cheap service, you get cheap customers.  This was a one time deal.",AnctBy0lQxRFNh7iosodgw,0,0,1,G6wAO0rtxK1W8FIxxcUcyA
2066160,2017-02-26,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,"Update: A few days after my original Yelp review I received a call from Gina at Port of Subs corporate. We received an apology for our poor experience. We were offered 2 large combos along with dessert... under the condition that we return to that exact location and mention the managers name. While it certainly WAS a nice gesture, wouldn't  it would be better to just do the right thing everyday, instead of only when management is watching? Sorry, but I am still choosing to say no to this port of subs location.",48VJzPKelBfK8Fano-ch5g,0,0,2,Sga6phsYzudhmAvt5i3IBA
2290737,2015-02-08,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,We were hungry after shopping and saw Port of Subs. Love them and decided to get some lunch. William and Carly were working and were very friendly. William was especially helpful and outgoing! Our sandwiches were yummy as usual. They have a new Marinated Cucumber Salad. Decided to try it. It was delicious.  Definitely will be back.,TqKDnj5_IthGvPCGgN1qvQ,0,0,5,So2ogvMU3bGsOcyNp4zz2Q
2309312,2011-12-21,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,"port of subs.....   sliced meat fresh in front of you to edge them out over subway....  They have changed their menus since I have last been in there....   I ordered a small Blackforest Ham with provolone on Wheat with spicy mustard... it was great and exactly what I was looking for for lunch.  I think the price was sub 4 bucks too which was also a bonus.   There was kind of a long line and it was understaffed considering the time of day it was (lunch)    all in all, it was a great experience and I would go back to this particular one again should I need a quick bite.",B6wnNghKgXmIrbn5k1pKBQ,1,1,3,JyQqKroY6ENRULOUHYqjsw
2725156,2015-02-08,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,This was our first visit to this port of subs.Willams and Carla greeted us and got started on our orders right before it got busy. They handled it well and got us great food with great service. While they were cleaning up and restocking after the rush they asked us how we like our meal. They were chatting it up with us while they cleaned the place. William even gave me suggestions for my next sandwich. Awesome job so I had to post a review.,_YB_-vej0GOP8B7gagBJJQ,0,0,5,sC-PcPtuiUMxz_pmjeq87A

Flakes from her hair all over her shirt/ hat there is a good chance it could get on the food ! We had to walk out since we were disgusted!,shheBq1DLEKS9hvo-hvajw,0,0,1,j2Cmj_8Gv5tV2CGgFM2kBA

People behind the counter looked miserable doing what they were doing...

I ordered a turkey pastrami with everything which was okay, but I still prefer Subway or Capriotti's...they also definitely give you better service
for sure...ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,1,1,3,l2n9EAWl9THCpfY3fpHG4g
3790175,2018-07-01,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,The online ordering for port of subs is garbage! I put my order in online and It never told me that It went through so I called the store and they told me that It was almost ready even though i didn't tell them my name. When I got to the location It was the wrong order and I had to stand in line 10 minutes to re order everything again,89FmDw2kZgYvdI6m-1C82Q,0,0,1,ZvE9WSgsMTSlsE7buftWfA

It has been quite some time since I have been to this location.  I would think again before returning.  I ordered a salad.  The staff seemed pleasant, however, when asking me if I wanted the iceberg lettuce, the staff member just pointed to the lettuce...  didn't even ask me verbally.  She forgot to ask me if I wanted cucumber (like she did with the other ingredients) so I had to ask for her to add it.  Once my salad was complete, I asked for the fat free ranch dressing on the side.  They were out!  They weren't even able to offer me another dressing besides oil and vinegar.  I will look at other options before returning here.",kOPRX94rDBXEPmLBZNG7RQ,0,0,1,p0DhMX3a5I2drpcm35E_MQ
4397149,2016-08-02,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,"My first time at Port of Subs in YEARS (probably because I'm not a huge sandwich person) but I had a craving today and boy, did it hit the spot!! I ordered a classic medium sub. The meat, bread, and cheese all fresh and tasty. I love the fact that on days that I'm not so famished I can opt for a 5 inch small, in lieu of its bigger 8 inch sandwich. They have added a few new things to the menu so I will be back to try a griller or a wrap. Sandra, the manager was very nice and greeted me when I walked in. My iced tea was great too! Fresh; not stale. As far as franchise sandwich shops go; this one is great one! I will be back. Thank you for a great lunch today.",EZbvMdvCA2D9vF6VjILYXA,1,1,5,Z0EFjBV3hOEapSlBuqLnzA
4548921,2017-01-19,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,"Food was ok but the place reeked of bleach. Really strong. And as I was eating they came around again with a bleach bucket washing floors right where we were all sitting. Couldn't finish my sandwich. I appreciate that they are trying to keep the place clean but it's just too strong and they did it during dinner. I feel they should do it during down times. After I decided it was just too smelly to eat, I wanted used the bathroom before getting back on the road. The toilet seat was broken in half and not usable and it smelled of bleach even stronger in there. I absolutely love their sandwiches and the staff were polite and friendly but the bleach and broken toilet seat makes it likely that I won't return.",OI7eN_aR8LjgkTYT4Yyteg,0,0,3,3wibo0rNYIF5S1ssuEMiCA
5212403,2013-06-07,0,5G4Tg_hBfUGilQWj2lj8IA,"This is the 2nd Port of Subs I have dined in at and the service is not so great. The first location I went to was on 215/Decatur. Horrible service as well. I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. The sandwich maker didn't ask what kind of bread, rather she assumed I wanted wheat, she didn't ask if I would like t toasted. I notice the lettuce and veggies were old, brown and soggy so I asked if they had a new batch to serve and she said "" no just cause it has a few browns in the lettuce, it's still good"". I was like nevermind you ignored my question and just made my sandwich feel less appetizing. She went on to making 3 other people's sandwiches before asking if that's all i wanted and if I was dinning in or to-go. I just don't understand Port of Subs  employment standards but I think I'm going back to Eating Fresh at Subway!",n6_omiRPyUthZMlpevRgdQ,1,0,1,o3qCjt80X384CMGMK2EoTA

They help you load everything into your car, your orders are top priority and are done in a very convenient time and manner. Plus the Manager himself sits with you with a menu to go over the options and helps you idealize the portions accordingly. Every time I've gone in, even for a simple sandwich for myself, I have been treated with great customer service.",kxy46oEIF7Us2sN5DcJTAg,0,0,5,d-9oxkXj5s0KSFFvlzEeHA
