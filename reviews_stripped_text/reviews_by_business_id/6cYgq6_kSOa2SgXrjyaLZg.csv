First time ever at a Popeye's and walking in the food smelled good and the place was clean, but that's about all.
Women working the counter did not want to be there. Being at Popeye's for the first time I had a lot of questions but it seemed like I was bothering her. 
So I decided on the 10 piece deal for $20 with half spicy crispy and half regular with ""gumbo"" and mash potato, also an order of fried shrimp.
Got home (5 mins away) and was disappointed with the shrimp it was super dry. 
A few pieces of chicken were pretty ok, I did like the spicy ones. And a few pieces were very dry!
The so-called gumbo was dry just red rice!?
The mash potato was pre-mixed with gravy which is dumb in my opinion so there is nothing to dip the biscuit in.

 The chicken is spicy, I can't wait to try their spicy variety, while I'm eating with my mom and toddler I settle for regular.

If i was the owner I would have fired a bunch of people in the store today and gave her a raise since she seems to be working twice as hard for others to slack off.,-jJTm50YRw71h_F9xJ3bmA,0,0,3,74z_hpY9Cx2if-UVhpBmOg
