4045,2015-09-06,0,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,The food is great.. But I feel like the service and quality has gone down since I came here a couple months ago. Food took a lot longer than the last time. They seem really short staffed for a Saturday night. Couldn't even get a Togo box for my pizza.. Got offered a piece of foil instead.. Love this place but I just feel if they tried a little harder to make the guests happy; they would get better business.,gpqjvuBvOeyZPCPRAgLIjQ,1,0,3,K6ns6Us5pzXQL4L01vUz4A

48229,2015-04-25,0,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"Disappointing to say the least.  I went to eat at Sammys only to find that it has been changed to Table 89.   A fast food concept though the food is better.  if I'm going to go out to dinner and spend $70 I want to be greeted, seated, and waited on.  Going out to dinner is supposed to be a nice, relaxing experience where someone else takes care of your needs. I'm a mom, I do that for others every day so going out to dinner is supposed to be my turn.  I ordered a glass of wine with dinner, which I'm glad they still have, but didn't get a second as i usually would because I didn't want to have to get up, wait in line a second time, and pay a second time.   As for desert, we opted out for the same reason.  Sometimes you just don't know if you're going to want it till the end, you know what I mean.  So while I did enjoy the food, there is really no service to speak of and the restaurant lost out on another $30 from our table because we didn't want to have to keep standing in line to pay over again.  Though I am a big fan of Sammys, it is unlikely that I will return to Table 89.",si4jISAz919doHZywbHeyQ,0,0,2,8hJ6hyq_W-F9fofOtxSHyA

We were afraid walked in that the the whole menu was different as well. That was not completely the case. The food was somewhat the same. Sliders are now just sliders with chips instead of fries and lettuce,tomato, pickle. We didn't like the fact that we had to get up and get everything ourselves. Drinks,silverware, condiments, and napkins. As a busy mom that was expecting to get served in a restaurant, I was highly disappointed that I had to do all this myself. I could have just stayed home and saved the money! Sorry but I won't be returning here. This farm to table idea is bull. It's the same food just scaled down.

The food (3 different pizzas and 3 different salads) was not very good.  The pizza crusts were dry and tasteless.  My wife's margarita pizza had some kind of dijon vinegrette on it which absolutely ruined the basil flavor.

The atmosphere was terrible.  We ate outside because the dining room was freezing cold.  This was a mistake due to the sitting area (where everyone stands and smokes) that is on the other side of the fence.  The strong smell of cigarette smoke was present the entire time as different people waited and smoked by the fence.

Sammy's at the same location always had great food and I never had a bad meal there.  I don't know what brought on the changes to Table 89 but the result was terrible.

1672004,2015-03-08,0,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"With a limited number of restaurants in the area and loving Sammy's, I decided to check out this new restaurant by the creator of Sammy's. The decor was slightly different, however the layout is exactly the same. I was comforted to see a couple familiar faces, but after standing at the usual hostess stand to wait to be seated I was a bit taken back when someone asked me from behind the Sammy's ""to go"" cashier stand if I was ready to order. My reaction was, ""Ready to Order?"" So confused, my friend and I said we've never been there so wasn't sure what to do (clearly since they just recently opened and I'm standing waiting to be seated). The ""busser"" went on to explain it was a casual dining and for us to go ahead and order, then they bring the food to us. Ok no problem. Not what we expected, but I think a better greeting and explanation of the new layout would have been nice. After we ordered, I went to find a seat outside while my friend unsure of what to do, went to go fill out drinks. After finally sitting we realized we were supposed to get our own utensils and napkin as well. Again, being a new restaurant and having a menu so close to what Sammy's offers, you would think the staff would be kind enough to explain this, especially after we said it was our first time there and we weren't sure what to do. In the end the food and price was actually pretty good. My friend and I both had the Thai Shrimp Salad ($11).  I hated seeing the dirty dishes piled up on other tables until there were at least 5 that needed to be busses before someone came and paid attention to them. Then to watch an old lady ask the busser if she had to get her own drink refill, then have to go back into the building and across the restaurant to fill up her glass was a little unsettling too. She and her husband were as confused as we were on the new concept. Definitely nothing like the experience when it was a Sammy's. 

It did not, however, stop me from returning for dinner that very same day (tonight). Again, the food was good and the location is convenient to my home. Knowing what to do this time, my party and I walked straight up to the 20"" menu screen to look over the menu, but not even 5 minutes from arriving we were asked of we were ready to order. Really? We were a party of 3 and again, this is a new restaurant. I don't see how anyone can be ready that fast. Especially when the menu is so small. We went to the utensils to grab some forks, but all that was in the containers were oversized spoons, steak knives, regular knives and teaspoons. No forks and it was only 8p. They close at 9:30p and it was not busy. I had the Market Salad ($9) and added Grilled Chicken Breast ($3) which was ok. Nothing exciting, but fresh and healthy. I would order it again. My friend had the Grilled Steak with Lentils  ($12), but before ordering she asked what kind of steak it was. The busser told her NY Strip, which surprised us, but it was actually a Flank Steak. I think the Flank is actually better. We watched as people walked in only to be greeted with, ""Hi, are you ready to order?"" I really think this should change. Maybe a warm welcome and the staff inquiring if it was the persons first time there so they can explain the concept, layout and such.

1757339,2015-02-07,4,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"Sibling restaurant to Sammy's Woodfired Grill & Pizzas, Table 89 offers pizza and assorted healthy-style fare like salads, soups, sandwiches, and a handful of entrees. Not familiar enough with Sammy's menu to be able to tell if the pizzas are the same or not, but style is similar. Came in for soft opening advertised via social media.

LOBSTER BISQUE; smooth and creamy with a good dose of lobster flavor
GOAT CHEESE AND TOMATO FLATBREAD: menu descrbies this as coming ""with Mediterranean herbs"" but it's actually zatar. Odd combination of flavors, not sure this really works. Only dish we didn't finish.
STEAK SALAD: ample portion of grilled marinated steak was a touch tough, vegetables were overdressed in a scallion-ranch dressing that didn't have much flavor  but the various textures of tomato and radish, plus the addition of feta worked nicely. Particularly enjoyed the watercress in the lettuce mix.
HERB MARINATED SLICED STEAK: same type of steak as was served in the salad, seems to be round top and was cooked properly to medium rare but again- tough and chewy. The warm beluga lentils and greens had an earthy flavor that didn't quite work for my guy.

Setup is a walk-up counter to place your order at a light-up menu, take your glass to a drink station and pick up your cutlery at another station, then pick a table and your food is brought out. Not sure why drinks and cutlery are not positioned together. Service still seems to be getting settled in, some employees are friendly and polite but many were quiet- possibly nervous.

 I like the freshness of the food but the concept seems a little muddled with Italian and modern and quazi-Mediterranean options. Appreciate the healthy and flavorful options available on the menu though.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,5,3,YCldN3LPZ3CWZNZ1UxbbPQ

My hubbie and I dined here regularly when it was Sammy's. I was taken aback when I went to grab lunch and saw the new signage on the building. The menu still had the beet salad I went out for, so I decided to give it a whirl. 

I walked in to an empty restaurant, 1 guy in front of me. He was sampling beers trying to decide what kind of beer he wanted in his pitcher. I was fine with that because I knew I'd be next. And the cooks weren't too busy, so they'd be able to get my food out quickly. As I continued to wait patiently the room behind me filled up with others waiting to order. It appeared the bartender called for back up because 2 girls came to the front counter. The people behind me (who hadn't been waiting nearly as long as I had) proceeded to order at the register to the left of where I was standing. Still, I was waiting on pitcher of beer guy to pay... seriously?

Now my order was going to be behind the huge crowd of folks that came in after me (I think it was a softball team or something?). No thank you. My guess is that they eliminated wait staff to reduce overhead. In personal opinion, it is a big mistake. 

I can't comment on the food because I left without ever having ordered. Or even being acknowledged for that matter. Service is a big thumbs down for sure.",Yq_TS4fTDVcfOKLRzytgdQ,2,0,1,rjXusOzHZv8NHYtdfeA2Hw

Luckily they still offer vegan Daiya cheese... unluckily, they offer almost none of the toppings they used to.  There weren't even any vegan pizzas on the menu anymore, they all had to be altered to all hell to be vegan, much less appetizing.

This used to be Sammy's Wood Fired Pizzas and is still owned by the same parent company, as well as carrying over a few of their signature Sammy's pizzas and other plates.

Thai shrimp salad $11
Five large shrimp grilled to just barely done--how I like it. The salad was a bit overly dressed, but the dressing was really good. If you're watching your calories, ask for the dressing on the side. There is also a big crunchy slice of garlic bread that I loved.

Steak and watercress sandwich $11
""I love buttered grass!""
You get a choice of multigrain or white bread and I chose multigrain. Nice chew to the bread and held up against the steak. The steak was grilled to med rare (my preference) and sliced thin, and was tender, not chewy. Served with cole slaw (very creamy) or kettle style chips.

Steak salad $12
Same style of steak as the sandwich but on greens and with the same garlic bread slice. More steak on this than the sandwich.

Kobe beef sliders (three) $10
Good sized sliders that were thick. The patties were very tender. Just wished there was more sauce, but another person in my party got more sauce on theirs. If you want extra sauce, ask for it on the side. Kettle ships come with this and they are thick and crunchy.

Pear and Proscuitto pizza $11
My favorite dish. The crust is very thin and very crunchy. It held up to the salad on top and all the cheese and oil. The salad again was overly dressed with balsamic. It was a very potent vinaigrette, so a little goes a long way. But I loved the mix of cheese, salty proscuitto, and soft and slightly sweet pear.

No way we could finish all the food. The leftovers were still great reheated later that day.

The staff was very attentive, even though they are new and just opened. Several of them checked on us throughout the meal. They promptly removed dishes without even asking.

For the most part the portion sizes are good, except the fried chicken. One of our party got this dish and another asked if it was an appetizer or entree bc it was small. Everything else is about the size you would expect. I think this place is better than say Panera as far as taste and value. But if we are comparing pizzas to pizzas, Pieology and the like offer a similar sized pizza for around $8-9 vs Table 89's $11-12. However, Table 89 does have some topping not available at the custom pizza places.

They also share a beautiful patio with Chipotle with lots of umbrellas and trees; serve beer and wine; and have tv's to watch the game if it's on.

Anyone in the NW part of town should def give this place a try.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,11,6,4,gAAqtljpmG7w_igxM1Q3pQ

It looks like they gutted the old Sammy's Woodfired Pizza at this location and replaced with a new fast casual concept. Everything is self service except for the delivery and removal of plates at your table. 

The food was decent. I tried the fried chicken breast and steak salad. The chicken looked like chicken tenders and were served with kimchi and ranch. It was tasty overall and the kimchi was surprisingly good! The steak salad was ok and came as a pretty big portion. The steak looked medium rare which is how I ususlly like it although they don't ask your preference.

The only problem I ran into is that while eating my salad, I found a crumpled paper condiment cup mixed into my salad. WTF! A waitress walked by 2 minutes later to check on us and we showed her the crumpled paper cup amd told her that it was mixed into the salad. She apologized and said she would show her manager. A few minutes later, another employee comes by to apologize and tells us that she'll go notify her manager. I continuted my meal expecting to receive an apology or at least a visit from a manager but nobody ever came back. How disappointing, especially considering that this was their official soft opening event and there were plenty of representation from corporate present...

NOT: a stand in line, order your food, get your own drink, take your # to the table, wait to be served DELI SITUATION.

Now let me quickly state here that Beto, the waiter, greeter, order taker, should be manager because he is so AMAZING, was JUST as wonderful and gracious and quick to get the food to us, offer additional drinks, etc as he was when this was Sammy's! They are lucky to have him!

However, shouldn't a restaurant afford all the accommodations of being 'a restaurant'. Come in, sit down, order drinks, take your time, order appies, entrees etc, all at the diners convenience and time table? Not the restaurant's?

Table 89 has succeeded in taking the enjoyment out of  meal time. 
Their little hook of ""We are committed to using the freshest local produce and organic ingredients from farmers we know and partners we trust."" Is sure to entice some foodies. 

But intelligent, aware foodies are going to look for the words: Organic or non-GMO on the menu. And you will not find them. Because by law, the only way you can state that on a menu is if it is true. Organic ingredients are one thing, organic menu items, meats and produce are entirely a different matter.

Maybe this is a case for the younger hipper crowd who don't mind standing in line to order food, read through an entire menu and order everything they may want to consume, all within 5 minutes of walking in the door.",0hPdEvppGe_sWn7yjHnRLw,3,0,1,prIXgV1vv2waO-93OfKwnA

2969856,2015-03-29,0,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"After reading the reviews we were on the fence about eating here, I'm glad I ignored the reviews and went in.

First off I really don't understand what all the hubub is about it not being Sammy's or that the ordering is confusing. If you have never eaten at a Fast Casual (Chipotle, Panera, Chick-Fil-a just to name a few) restaurant that has the exact same ordering process there's a sign as you walk in that tells you how to order - you grab a menu, wait your turn and order, they give you a number and they bring you your food. How is that confusing? It's called fast casual, many companies have done this Panda Inn = Panda Express, PF Chang = Pei Wei to name a couple.

Regarding it not being Sammy's. I wonder if these people complain when they go to Ruth's Chris that it's not Morton's or that McDonald's isn't Burger King. I don't get that, if you wanted Sammy's why didn't you go to Sammy's? Makes no sense. A review should be written on the restaurants merits not that its not some other restaurant. Again, glad we ignored these reviews.

Arrived as they were opening for lunch. Got in line, reviewed menu, by the time we were at the front of the line we had made-up our minds.

Gal working register was very friendly and apologized for the wait . . . this surprised me as we really were not in line that long. Long enough to make-up our minds, maybe a minute or two more.

Ordered a four cheese pizza for my 13 yo son, wife got a chicken hummus wrap and I got the mushroom pizza and hummus small plate. Thought I'd mention I was stuck between two items so I thought I'd ask the gal running the register her opinion. Gave me a great reason to order one over the other and I'm VERY glad I took her advice. Grabbed our drinks, sat down and I'd say that in about 10 minutes we had our food. Didn't seem long at all, my son even commented on how fast it was.

Pizzas were awesome and quite filling. My son who typically only likes pizza hut cheese pizza (yuk) loved his. I was only able to eat 1/2 my pizza and my son ate 3/4 of his.

Wife's wrap was great! Peppers, olives, crisp lettuce and hummus (might have been more in there). I asked her what she ranked it and she said a 10. Came with coleslaw or chips and she upgraded to fries for a buck. Fries were very good, cooked to perfection and a nice seasoning.

The hummus, damn the hummus and pita was good, so good, probably one of the best I've had and a very healthy portion (see picture). So much in-fact that I after the pita slices were gone I used pizza crust to finish every last bit. LOVED THE HUMMUS!!!!

Food a 10!

Now the misc. items:
Staff was friendly and helpful, restaurant was spotless (even bathroom), great decor, lots of natural light, they have a nice patio, prices are average and about what I would expect for the quality of the food. I didn't feel that anything we ordered was overpriced. Menu had a great selection of items for everyone.

Bottom-line we loved this place and will definitely be back. A great Fast Casual option on this side of town.",GkiooMd-muOFUgsC_nI7QQ,2,0,5,xMkGHGUh3h-Ozi7LpjaKcA

Table 89, owned by Sammy's parent company, does not disappoint on it's menu. Familiar dishes and new favorites alike. The quality of the ingredients, preparation, and finished products are great. You definitely get the ""locally sourced"" and ""farm to table"" feel and quality here. And while Table 89 has gone to a more ""serve yourself"" style, they still have an attentive staff that caters to the customers needs and is happy to help. Adding / subtracting components from any dish is no problem. The biggest surprise----the menu prices are 30-40% lower than before!!!!!

3167844,2015-02-19,2,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"Having never really been a fan of Sammy's pizza, I wasn't really rushing to check out Table 89. But since Chipotle had its usual line nearly out the door, we figured we might as well check it out. It's under the same ownership as Sammy's but is a completely different ""concept"". Walking in, you'll see a large counter with an open kitchen right behind it, and seating to both your left and right. And while they might be taking the fast-casual approach, it feels a bit ""cheaper"" as it is basically an all self-service restaurant, besides placing your order and having the food brought to your table. All the silverware, napkins, etc. are in separate sections and nothing is at the table or brought with your food. Considering how many similar places will at least bring you silverware with your food, I found it a bit odd.

Moving on, Table 89 actually has a pretty extensive menu. With plenty of apps, salads, entrees, sides and a kids menu, there's bound to be something for everyone. There's also quite a pizza options as well, although I can't say how they compare to Sammy's offerings, since I only went a couple times. I decided on the Mini Duck Tacos to share with my son, and then the Herb Marinated Sliced Steak as dinner.

Mini Duck Tacos - 4 small crunchy tacos served basically smothered in an almost slaw like topping. The shells themselves were brittle, almost stale tasting and since there was very little actual meat on the tacos, it was hard to taste anything else. I did try of a piece of the duck by itself and it was definitely overcooked, with very little flavor. Sadly, the feta cheese and tomato mixture topped with a creamy sauce was the definite star of the dish. It might be the only time I'd say having something other than meat smother a taco was a good thing. 

Herb Marinated Sliced Steak - After having read bad reviews about this, I was kind of kicking myself for ordering it afterwards. Much like what's already been expressed about it, the steak was very tough and overcooked. The menu claims its medium-rare, but mine was more like well done. It was barely seasoned and completely masked by the way too sweet lentils. I liked the crispness of the fresh greens on top, but overall it's just not a dish I'd recommend.

With the tacos being the exception, the portion sizes aren't too bad for the price. My steak entree was priced at $11 with a healthy portion of steak and plenty of lentils to go along with it. The wife had a salad, and it was also a pretty good size for $8. Our total bill was $37 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 kids meal and 2 drinks. Not the greatest pricing considering the style of restaurant, but stick to drinking water and you can get out of here for a decent amount. 

Since you don't interact with staff too often, I can't say a whole lot about the service. When we first walked in, they explained the system and kind of just sent us on our way. We did have a nice girl check on us once while we were eating, but otherwise you're mostly on your own here. 

Overall, everything was just okay. If you're in the area, it's worth a shot, but definitely not worth going out of your way for. It's nice that they're bringing something a little different to the Northwest area, but I certainly won't be rushing back.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,9,3,3,UVGibgd4zoRcUwp1HAoWDA

3452021,2015-08-31,0,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"I loved the food choices here, an eclectic menu that caters to carnivores, vegans, gluten free, and the pizza lover! I enjoyed my grilled steak on lentils, it was cooked more than medium rare but still good, with a topping of greens.  We also ordered the sirracha tofu which was a nice appetizer and healthier than ordering fries and I would definitely make this at home! I love that they had a selection of wines, I tried a ginger beer which was very nice, my bill came to $19.

Part Two, what makes this restaurant different is that you order up at the counter. When you walk in there is a stack of menus to order from and then you proceed to the counter. I was meeting a friend and the girl at the counter suggested I take a menu and I could sit down. My friend arrived and she also took a menu and sat down. Ten minutes later we realized by the card holder on the table we needed to order up at the front. To be fair there is signage but we both made the same error. The setup looks like a regular restaurant, so there is no line management to make you think otherwise. 

Part Three. We discussed how one would classify this restaurant. I said fast food, she disagreed, and I have to agree it is not fast food either, but I cannot classify it as a full service diner. It is modeled after Sizzler, and we do not see those around anymore.

Part Four. Overall, I loved the food, however, for the $19 I spent, I would prefer to spend a little more for full service. I probably would not drive the 20 minutes to eat there, but if I was in the area and there were dietary restrictions in my group I would.

Just a note, two times this week, counter people were unable to answer simple questions about how the food is prepared. I was perplexed when I asked the girl if the ice tea was caffeinated and she was not sure. I tried a second way, is the tea herbal and she responded it is brewed. Which brings me to another point, it would be nice to have a complete list of beverages!

Came here Friday evening for dinner. It was fairly busy but casual and enjoyable dining experience. 

I liked the quick order at the counter, fill your own drinks, and seat yourself system. Reminds me of the ""upscale casual"" dining I'm used to at home.  It was quick, efficient, and you don't have to sit around waiting for service (which also leaves the door open for less obligation to tip-- but you would of course given the follow up wait service.. i.e. clearing plates, bringing boxes, refilling drinks, etc.). 

The kobe sliders and fries were pretty good and simple. I enjoyed the sundried tomato artisan crust pizza and small plates meatballs with marinara. Both were delicious and fairly filling. The messy sundae was the BEST PART -- 1/3 whipped cream, 1/3 hot fudge, 1/3 vanilla ice cream. It was a great and decently priced ending to the meal.. especially for a sweet tooth like me. My fiancee split it with some left over to spare so it was a pretty hefty size. 

Would definitely come here again for no frills/hassle, quick but not too fast, dining.

P.S. It just dawned on me that Sammys is a San Diego based restaurant which may explain my affinity for Table 89 and why the type of service is not a surprise to me.. vice what previous commenters are saying (which is a little aggravating).

In fact, I would say we have been there hundreds of times.   One day I went to our local Sammy's for a birthday and it was suddenly a table 89.  Some familiar items but mostly not.  All of our favorites:  Gone except Chicken Tequila Fettuccine  and Hummus.   We ordered what we liked and were shocked when it was so.much.smaller.   Smaller portions at the same price.  I wasn't happy at all.  They changed the lobster bisque recipe too, so now it tastes canned.  :(  

The atmosphere we had spent almost every birthday and special event at for years is GONE.  It's like a fast food restaurant now where you have to keep getting up and down to go get your own silverware and drinks.  Making it more confusing, no one tells you about this at first, so you wander around, confused,   I guess if it had Mac Donald's prices, that would be cool, but it doesn't.  

Today we decided to give it another chance.  After glancing at the menu, we can clearly see that it is now even smaller.   No more Pasta, so goodbye Chicken Tequila fettuccine and Hello nothing but mostly lettuce salads.

4777401,2015-02-19,0,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"First, we understand that the folks from Sammy's still have ownership of this location. And it is always nice to have a new restaurant open in the neighborhood. We tried to get by here 5 or 6 times a year under the Sammy's name and always enjoyed the wine selection, although it seemed a touch pricey. At TABLE 89, it's basically an 'order at the counter' situation; sort of like ordering at.....say a Fuddruckers. It's billed as a globally inspired and locally produced restaurant. The menu is certainly modern with lobster bisque, mini duck tacos, watercress sandwich, arugula n beet salad, and tofu in a few places. The $18 Merlot carafe netted 2 glasses, but the by the glass price was $6. As an appetizer, we tried a 'small plate' meatballs n marinara for $6 . They were well presented and tasty. For the dinner entr√©e, we ordered a 4 cheese pizza that the wife and kiddo described as cheese on dough. I ordered an $11 chicken Caesar. The salad was good and I really liked the grilled garlic bread; but as a lo-carb guy, I only get is a small taste. I wouldn't say there was great or even good value here.  And as a restaurant with no servers to bring anything (not even flatware), I struggled a bit to understand the giant spot on the charge receipt for a typical restaurant tip. They even had the typical 15, 18, and 20 percent tip calcs. I do appreciate great service (see my other reviews) and regularly tip 20 to 30 points; but this would be like tipping at the counter at Rubios and then before even seeing the food. In the end, I can't say that we'll be back anytime soon.

Overall, (for $59.18;  2 glasses of wine, a side of meatballs, a salad, and a low to medium quality pizza),  I'd say we should all let this concept have a chance, but I wouldn't bet it'll make it past the 1st year.",86a4dBuUXY_a_DCQX6DCGQ,10,0,2,EXv_94tBEvF2vyB1XytU6A

Never been here since Sammy's closed down but figured why not.  As we walked in, we were greeted by the order station.  The woman at this station was very friendly, and helpful with the ordering (1 star.)  The place was pretty busy, but did not seem overly crowded.  You can see the chefs cooking behind the counter (not the food), but can see people cooking.  We both ordered the Kobe Beef Burgers.  They did not ask us how we wanted them cooked, and I guess it's my fault for not telling them.  There was a special request on our order, and the accommodated with a smile (1 more star.)  We waited 15 minutes and our order arrived.  Both of our orders were cooked medium with a lot of pink (we prefer well done), however, we ate it anyway.  The burgers were very tasty and other than the pink, prepared and presented ok (1 star.)  We would go back and try it again, and recommend at least one try to everyone.  Total $22.70.",0krIXTM-fNED7ozGt11UmQ,0,0,3,OZUbW_OIqfjYKQYNztZPeA

It was cold,  the shrimp had some char from the grill but they were cold also. The hummus was thin and pasty. The Kobe sliders were lukewarm. Apparently  ,the restaurant doesn't stock mustard , no never we were told.  The beer was flat. Coconut shrimp was the bright spot. We all shared food and all had digestive issues 5-6 hours later.

I ordered the a Mediterranean wrap which was really good and my boyfriend ordered the bolognese which was the best thing ever! I normally do not like meat sauce and I ended up eating everything he didn't. We also ordered the Cesar salad which I wouldn't order again just because it had way too much dressing. It was good though so if ordered maybe just ask for dressing on the side. The only negative is that it's only open until 8pm. I wish it was open until 9 at least.

The concept here is strange and appears more like a way for ownership to cut costs by not having waiters and servers than something that benefits the customer. Want a second beer? Go back to the counter and order one. Also take out your credit card and pay again.

The food isn't very good and certainly not worth the hassle they force you through to get it. Go somewhere else because this place sucks.",S4dV5bWLNli05LUgfV3FCQ,0,0,1,QVwMQqN_OLXkMUVlzRqLeg

Especially for large parties going Dutch. No need to split a bill at the end of the meal. Food was great. Service was awesome as always. Menu prices are lower. Now we can go back more often. Boys love that their pizzas and messy sundae stayed on the menu. I had the kale and romaine Caesar salad, yummy. My hubby had beef over lentils, very tasty!

Trying to mix too many things into one. Also got the wagyu sliders. Not bad but not much to them. The second time we go the tequila fettuccine and the ""fried chicken"" i quote it because it was more like chicken jerky rolled in salt. It was disgusting. Again with the flavors. Why would you serve kimchi with fried chicken? The alfredo was good but the portions both times are very very small. I feel ripped off.

As a result, I had to go and order a New York style pizza which was $14 for a 10 inch since I added chicken. In total, I paid about $26 + tax for ONE person since my first dish was not enough to satisfy my hunger. It's a new concept, and the food is healthy, they have gluten free options, vegan food, etc. However since the dining is self serving, I would assume that they be more generous in the quantity of food they serve per order.",QcVn9-ZawjQCeBji6XgA_Q,0,0,3,oesdL9ImplmCPPD9HqwcrQ

Location: Sucks
Parking: Sucks
The beginning does not bode well...
As you enter, you'll be struck right away that this place is not your standard dining experience. That was a turn off for me. The food selection was confusing to me, it seemed to be all over the place. Some say, ""eclectic"" I say chaos. That was a turn off for me. My family ate and they selected choices that they could live with, nothing jumped out at them. I was too turned off to eat. It was a little pricey for what they got. That was a turn off to me. I won't be back.

Here's a suggestion for the manager: Shut it down for a day. Take your entire staff, including every person, to Nordstrom Cafe at Fashion show. If you model your business after them  and serve high quality meals like they do, you might make it, even with the parking situation.",miYjr7cJ-e0Yjgnr1rYPOg,0,0,2,dm8B49dZtVEuPBMCGczw8A

The moment u walk in, the smoky aroma of a wood-fired oven reassures u that u picked the right place to eat. It's a more casual sit down restaurant. U order at a counter & a waiter brings your food and wine in 5-10 minutes.

5813530,2015-03-10,1,w55IYhyLHUdsRlo_EvMmNQ,"Dull.  Uninviting.  Confusing. 

We walked in tonight with good spirits.  We've seen this restaurant by going to other nearby restaurants (i.e. Chipotle) and noticed it was the old Sammy's Woodfire Grille.  At first glance, the restaurant seemed hidden.  As we walked in, we were puzzled with the ordering process.  There weren't any friendly workers to ask questions or any greetings from anyone, not even smiles from any workers.  The people in front of us were taking their sweet time looking at the two menu monitors, so we waited.  When it was our turn to order, I mentioned to the cashier that we have never dined in the restaurant, ever.  Hoping for a response, we instead got a blank stare.  We didn't want to take a long time, unlike the people before us, so we preceded to order quickly.  

We decided to order the lobster bisque, meatball with marinara, cheese bread and steak sandwich.  The cashier finally spoke and asked ""...and for drinks??"" as if we were annoying her with our order.  The rest of the dinner continued on to be below average.  It was actually too quiet.  Everyone was whispering because the ceiling are too low and walls too close.  There were no background music to even enjoy.  

The short end of the story, I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant by choice.  The food was decent, nothing to rave about.  I wish the service was friendlier and more inviting, after all there are other restaurants a lot friendlier just outside their doors.  I don't ask for a high quality presentation or a big welcome, just friendly faces and appreciation.",WDO_asCWPs7dpCG5v_x57g,4,0,2,ILl-usLblUz2q9Z_nEdHGQ
