I ordered a chicken kabob, the chicken was chewy and dry. I had asked them if they had fresh jalapeño and if they can grill it and they had said yes. What came out??? Geilled Pickled jalapeños.

While browsing at the after noon munchie options we decided to try this place Pita's which is also a Philly Cheese steak place as well.  I did not know that one guy was running both outlets at first until I ordered at one and walked over to the other register and asked if I needed a cheese steak as well.  

He was very helpful surprisingly.  He made sure that I wanted everything I ordered. For example when we ordered the falafel he said ""you want the hummus, tahini, lettuce, tomato on the pita.  most places will not explain what everything is like that.  I am sure he did this because he probably gets a lot of people who order and are not really sure what they are getting seeing how this mall The Premium Outlets South is mostly for Las Vegas Tourists.   By ensuring the order is correct when placed it puts the blame for mistakes on the customer instead of the business operator.  Smart Guy!

He did the same when I ordered the Cheese steak as well.  He went through the ingredients including the cheese whiz like sauce that would be added to my sandwich.  I also wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo added and he repeated it back as well ensuring I was clear with what I was ordering.  

The food came out at a decent time.  They call out your number and you pick up the food at the other end of the Philly counter.  The Pita sandwich was good, as well as the fallafel and hummus.  They veggies were nice and fresh meaning the lettuce and tomatoes good bright colorful chunks.  You could tell they were using fresh produce.  My sandwich was a little small on the meat portion but it was delicious and fresh and made just the way I ordered it.  I understand portion control consistency are important when operating a biz and meat is expensive.  I am sure his rent at this place is Ridiculous!

We finished our meal and our beverage so I went back to the counter to ask for a refill and he gladly took care of it.  The guy even asked how my meal was tasting. Amazing!  I thought the service we received was good.  This man actually cared about our experience which is very important as a small business owner. This man get its. 

The only reason I gave them 3 stars was becuase of the frumpy looking women sitting in a chair behind the counter.  No smile, No hello, and no intention of doing either in the near future and on top ofit she was EATING! a wrap or sandwich right there in the food prep area in guest view.  Not a care in the world.  A big NO! NO! in my book.  Everything else was good.  Loose frumpy face....its killing your Biz my friend.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,0,0,3,3pt1JSZYcTRhKeIo4uS5aQ

The pita:  dry-stale and crumbled when touched.  
The meat:  Gross!  Zero flavor.  Presented like a dried up shoe sole.  The meat was packaged into small plastic bags that were dipped in a vat of boiling water to heat it!! 
The tzaki  sauce was lumpy with huge chunks if cucumber.  No flavor and they forgot the dill! 

Save your $$$ -- Dont do it!",l_fCnDWlT6UFLxwqguI_2g,0,0,1,Xi28YtxQQte7mJ3g6-vc8g
3846030,2013-12-31,0,V8wvvaOaRFqrjuPqVPuMjw,The veggie plate was very good for mall food..I enjoyed the hummus and falafel. The guy working the register was covering two restaurants efficiently so kudos to him. I would stop by here again. One suggestion would be to get rid of the Styrofoam and switch to paper plates.,BNLlJRu0dxwsJXekXogt0Q,0,0,4,lZpdeZxyMlpzUW2OcSkjHQ
5463049,2015-04-24,0,V8wvvaOaRFqrjuPqVPuMjw,"I spent most of my childhood growing up in the Middle East. Since there's not a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants where I live, I'm always on the lookout for authentic Middle Eastern food when I travel. This place is not authentic. Yes, they use words like kabob and falafel to reel you in, but that's all they are - empty words.

I ordered the chicken kabob sandwich and was very disappointed at how dry and unseasoned the chicken was. There wasn't even a hint of the Middle Eastern spices that I grew up with that's supposed to tantalize with every bite. The hummus was just mashed chick peas devoid of any seasoning. I know I shouldn't expect much from mall food, but I wanted even just a HINT of flavor. I only added the extra star because it's a mall establishment.",wU6NcgB1h1lQNm-EuzDppA,0,0,2,alyNSc8q8KBmeR1x6s3FQg
