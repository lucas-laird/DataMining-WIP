Tonight, I ordered the Doritos taco..on the display it has sour cream. The cashier asked me if I wanted the nacho cheese Doritos taco..I said yea..I guess. Everything I ordered had Nacho cheese on it ..no sour cream. I can't fault the cashier, because she can't be expected to tell everyone..everything involved with each menu item. There has to be another way to make this easier for the consumer.",hwhe0vb9aYrSWXKpC2LT-A,0,0,2,rnUqqJRFjNHN28XZt9GV6g

I have had many interactions with the night shift manager in the past. He sometimes will work the drive thru window. He has always been fantastic. The lady preparing the food was very nice and personable. She thanked me for my business as she handed me the food. Her wonderful smile was absolutely contagious. I must truly say this was probably my single best fast food experience.",vKTAfjgvNowWgWeQ4m2LFA,0,0,5,XrkkV64Dk9D-PDeZV7fQOA

A nice young lady at the cash register was very helpful to us, she had us do a survey 'tell the bell' and gave us free cinnamon twists afterwards. The other ladies in the back also seemed cheery and over all had a great and friendly atmosphere!",YlUluJgec1PMgAMj5l-TVA,0,0,5,UL6dnigtEeNJKT3iMqu3dA

Not only that, they take so long just to mess up your order. Oh, and when you go through drive-thru, check your food. My order was wrong and I've called 5 times, still no answer. Is it that hard to answer a phone?!",HBe9fodpxpxMpi4vck6VHw,0,0,1,ta48kLdXcjOBwt_fmDXO9Q

3977649,2018-04-07,0,KY5-vGUZhDmDi1ieXRUmmw,I give 5 stars because they have a really nice staff. The cashier was extremely patient and friendly. One of the kitchen girls offered me a free drink and it was a heel of me not to accept it. Food is in great quality and fresh. I like that and be coming in again to this location. Very nice staff and professional service.,8xoiTVHPawcYxeaW8fZpDg,0,0,5,FnByn1tLfb41cDEqgk7HSA
4366035,2015-03-11,0,KY5-vGUZhDmDi1ieXRUmmw,Friendliest cashier at any fast food place that I've ever been to. They should hang on to this guy. It's hard to get good customer service at restaurants now a days. My receipt says his name is Cesar C. Not much of a wait. Food here is the same at any other Taco Bell.,8HLZTMjLK4ILflTuqQR96g,0,0,4,piwzfscneOHlhfQzseOZ_w

We were charged for the sour cream but it wasn't actually on the taco. That was a little annoying since it was on the receipt and they repeated it back to us correctly. But then it wasn't correct. Usually, they're accurate and quick but today they were just quick.",ZTR73AMIx6kuBAvXfdm_XQ,0,0,3,2ppqIOvGkOEHS2K0V1YdZg
