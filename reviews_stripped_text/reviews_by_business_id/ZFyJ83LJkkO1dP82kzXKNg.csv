If you haven't been here before, think of it as the In N Out of chicken fingers. That's what I like about it, I already know what I'm going to get, chicken fingers!!

Lack of care and lack of decent chicken quality makes this place fall out. This is no longer my Friday night deal. Also includes the quality of canes on vegas Blvd and warm springs area.",mikMQRxcmwwNu5aZBR1Zyg,0,0,2,IAL2c9218Drf_eLgvda37w

Raising Cane's was ok. The tenders were served piping hot; however, the fries are not very good. The iced-tea was SWEET, like I needed an insulin shot afterward. I couldn't stop thinking about those ""diabeetus"" commercials with Wilford Brimley. I ended up having to wash the tea down with Sprite. Yes, you read that correctly.

Giant plus: the servers were hilarious/kind and gave us a good ribbing for being out-of-towners. I would go back just for that.",AzALGc2e8SuDi7qtA_vzXQ,1,0,3,E7WatdmbVslMaNdlBbn2fw

191943,2016-01-05,0,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,"Cane's would get a 5 star if they could keep the quality control to standard.

At best, the chicken is perfectly brined, with a breading so perfect you could call it tempura. It will slide off the chicken if you let it. Chicken is perfectly tender. The fries are have a crisp outside and a soft, delicious inside. The toast is beautiful, buttery, and garlicky.

At worst, and definitely more common, the chicken will be overcooked. The breading will infuse into the chicken and basically create an hard, inedible rock. Frequently only 40% of the finger will even be edible. The fries will be a soggy mess. The toast will have been pressed into the styrofoam lid and there will be melted styrofoam on it.
 
If you ask for the chicken to be remade and explain what is wrong, they will always look at you like you're insane, and will end up giving you another plate of garbage. If you say you want your money back they won't give it to you. Instead they'll try to give you a gift card.

Lastly, I have to mention how corny the music and decor of Cane's is. A bunch of movie posters are on the wall that all suck, and the music is frequently stuff that is even bad for radio music. They make the workers dress like a pre-diabetes Texan. Expect to see a Ferris Bueler poster, probably a Twilight poster, some Harry Potter action and then the Hangover. Expect to hear some weird ass Britney Spears music you'd hoped you would forget.

TL;DR: If the quality control could stay up, they would get a 5/5, regardless of the music and decor.",OZUbBzvKB0cRIAED8Nkaxw,0,0,3,VhFKN3R-DjHk6T4OWZuyFA

297402,2017-08-02,0,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,"What can I say.. I grew up working for KFC in my teenage years, dined on Church's and Pioneer Chicken (sorry, I'm reminiscing) and enjoy the crunch of Popeye's so I had a few fast food chicken in my life. My nephew told me to try out Cane's since he knew we were going to Vegas. I did and I loved it.

The menu is simple.. There are set numbers of meals... 3,4, 6 pieces of chicken tenders with fries, texas toast, coleslaw and a drink. Or if you have a lot to feed, they have their tailgate numbers.. 25, 50 or 100. No need to worry about spicy or regular, crispy or original or roasted or whatever else to confuse your hungry mind. They had it figured out that when a customer is hungry, the last thing they want to do is go through a gauntlet of choices. Sometimes, simple is best. The chicken was very good. Coating was crispy but not too thick. The chicken itself was moist, flavorful and not dry. The Cane sauce complimented the chicken well.. not spicy but a little tangy to not overpower the star, which is the chicken. 

Overall.. my first time at Raising Cane's was good (at this location at least). Service was quick and friendly and the place was very clean. It is fast food but it's a good alternative to the others out there. Now if they can only come to the Bay Area...",6eYHnRWS75M0i5WGQ5s0Hw,1,1,5,bsu-3SNIqLvMtBRZ60WbQQ

I think of Raising Cane's as the chicken finger version of In-n-Out Burger.  They have a simple menu, clean restaurants and friendly staff.  I have never had a bad experience at any Raising Cane's and all of the employees seem genuinely happy to work there.  The fact that they have an adorable dog as their mascot (Cane) doesn't hurt either.

The chicken fingers are good, especially with their signature sauce.  Cole slaw and fries are also winners as is their Texas toast (LOVE their Texas toast!).  There really is something to be said about no over-diversifying your menu.  Keep it simple and so it right.

Cane's also involves themselves with local charities, and currently have a promotion during the holidays where you can buy a little stuffed Cane in a ""Buddy the Elf"" costume and proceeds will go to charity.

While driving by this fast food restaurant, I noticed that there was a drive-thru as well as a sitting area inside. Of course I decided to go inside to check it out. The interior was quite interesting. There were Halloween decorations and awesome ceiling fans that look like an airplane wing fan. 

We were greeted promptly and ordered the 3 piece combo and the caniac combo.

Thank you lady...Anyways, this also came with Texas bread, fries and a drink. The Texas bread was excellent because it tasted like a Hawaiian bread that was soft and not too buttery. The fries wasn't all that great, but it was ok though. The sweet tea was not as good as Popeyes...it was kind of bitter. Maybe they accidentally mixed the unsweetened iced tea with the sweet tea? 

The caniac combo meal came with the same items stated above as well as coleslaw. The coleslaw was a bit drenched in the sauce; however, the cabbage wasn't soggy and limp but crispy still.

I recommend ordering number 1 or number 3. Three is the largest box of strips and fries, but can easily be shared with another person. Of course, I have friends that can pound the number 3 by themselves, but I am a lightweight I guess. Number 1 is just about right and is worth the price.

Plus, their deliciously gooey dipping sauce (still have no idea what it is, and I probably don't ever want to know because I can't imagine it being anything other than an artery-clogging mixture of very heavy sauces/dressings) is unlike anything I've had elsewhere. 

The fries and texas toast are also very tasty and work well as sides, but nothing beats Cane's chicken tenders.

My first visit was dine-in, and even on a late Tuesday afternoon it was packed! We were lucky to find a table that was available since it seemed like some little league team was there at the time and took up most of the tables. The place was pretty clean and I saw them sweeping up a lot.

Service was OK. I didn't know anything about the place before ordering so when I asked if they had any BBQ sauce the cashier kinda just laughed at me. I mean OK sorry if that was obvious but, I really didn't know... Besides that she was nice enough, and I didn't have any interaction with the other staff.

The food was also just.. OK. I love chicken tenders and I was really excited to come here because I had heard such good things. The chicken itself was good and juicy, but it really didn't have too much flavor in either the meat or the breading. It kind of felt like I was just eating a good piece of chicken coated in bland panko. Some seasoning would really help the chicken, as well as the fries. I like the crinkle cut just fine, but when I put some seasoning salt on the leftovers myself after we had left, they were 10x better. I can't comment on the coleslaw since I'm not a fan and don't order it. But I can say that the Texas Toast is GREAT. I love the buttery-garlic-y not-too-crunchy outside that hides the soft and fluffy inside. I'd continue going back just for the toast.

Overall, even thought I was pretty underwhelmed, I think this place is OK. I came back on my most recent Vegas trip, because it's cheap for the portion and for its relative proximity to the strip (by car). My opinion on the food is the same, but that may be a good thing since I got it to-go most recently. I wouldn't say I come here to have a great meal (exception being the amazing toast), but it's something decent to hold you over until dinner comes along.",0Y87ZjxctwwN6QKElBP2Vw,1,0,3,m-YAueOwHdpffxX1DMtsvw

Let me start off by saying I am a loyal Raising Canes fan. I literally eat this during every lunch break since I've discovered it (I am not from LV and never heard of Raising Canes)

If I were to rate the food it would be 5/5 no doubt, this is my favorite fast food joint.

However, when visiting this East Flamingo location I was very disappointed and left upset by the rude ""customer service"" I had in the drive thru. I always go to the one near my workplace on St Rose and they treat their guest excellently. Well during my drive thru visit the lady helping us out had us repeat our order several times and then when we corrected her she would say ""that's what I said"" when she didn't... When we asked to substitute something she said ""no you can't do it"" in a snarky tone.. might I add that I've done it before at the other location. Then at the window she just came across as snobby and not wanting to assist us.

Here's the secret for Canes tho - Breakfast Chicken! A lot of Canes (including this one) open at 9 AM, I figure a chicken basket isn't that far off from chicken and waffles for breakfast (its pretty much the same thing without syrup). There's hardly anyone there until like 10:30 or so too, plus early in the day you can be sure you're getting strips fresh out the fryer, which makes them twice as good. 

Listed hours are till 1 AM every night but note the dining room actually closes at midnight. You can stay in there until 1 if you already ordered, but they lock the doors to new orders at midnight, its drive thru only for the final hour.",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,0,0,4,yntWMaLbxFe0aGm7CtyIAg

WHY: I have a strong gut feeling that this may be the best Cane's location out of the Las Vegas chain! Haha.

WHAT:  I have previously written a review about one of the other Cane's locations, but this is my absolute favorite location! The reasons behind my judgement is that the customer service is the best, the food is the best, and it stays 100 percent consistent!

The handful of times I have come here, I have never been let down.  There are times when the fries are either too salty, too soggy, or too crispy. Or times when the chicken fingers just don't taste how they should be tasting. But! Never has any of these incidents happened to me here!! I just may be their number one fan and proud!

The manager was an absolute sweetheart! I had forgotten my Caniac Club card, and he made it easy to accommodate me! There was one time I had forgotten my card at one of the other locations, and I couldn't redeem my box combo there! They had told me to email and or contact Cane's Corporate!! & sure did!

Had it not been for my best friend moving to Louisiana and telling me about this place, I probably would have never tried Raising Cane's. I mean, a fast-food restaurant that only serves chicken fingers?! How good could that be?! Let me tell you: pretty darn good!

I always get the Box Combo, which comes with 4 chicken strips, coleslaw, fries, texas toast, 1 cane's sauce and a medium drink. It's just the right amount of food for my healthy appetite.

Chicken fingers: They're always tender, and never dry. The outside of the chicken could be a little crunchier, but at least it doesn't have any of the hard, chewy chunks that you sometimes find in chicken fingers (gross, I know, lol). 

Coleslaw: It's very reminiscent of KFC's version, only creamier and fresher.

Fries: These remind me of a thinner version of Ore-Ida's crinkle french fries - they're pretty mediocre but perfectly salted, for me.

Texas toast: Thick texas toast, grilled with a slight buttery-garlic flavor.

Cane's sauce: I love their sauce! It's a mayo-ketchup based sauce with tons of black pepper, which I feel compliments the chicken fingers nicely... and the fries... and... hell, just dump it on everything!

Service is always top notch! They're very accommodating if you want to switch out the coleslaw in your combo to add another piece of toast, so you can make yourself a big chicken finger sandwich. And I love the fact that everything is made cooked-to-order and not sitting under heat lamps.",b7CwEKur07HjPr4D0msT0g,3,2,5,qBkIMH3Xkq7XZ-IFX30dcg

They have the best chicken fingers around and I cannot not stress that if there is one place to visit this is the place to visit in Vegas. I look forward to my trips because I know I will be getting some Cane's. Not only is  the food consistent in all their restaurants but the price is so cheap. If you look at the pic you would see how much food you get and in the Bay it would cost more to go to McDonald's then to go the Cane's. I love the atmosphere, you can't beat having a disco ball on the ceiling right? They show support to our Rebels at UNLV by offering literally starving student discounts. 
When you order your food they bring it to your table and they also help clean up your food. Now that is some superior service for a fast food joint right? The restroom are very clean too which I totally appreciate. The tables and floors are constantly being cleaned which I love too. So if you make it out to Vegas just like the M&M store and Coke Store put this on the list of places to visit.

Unfortunately, the fried chicken is REALLY hit and miss (some of the pieces I got were extremely dry) the fries are WAY too salty, and what the hell do I need a giant side of carbs for? The bread doesn't pair with anything.

The sauce is ok, it makes the bland chicken fingers so go from ""meh"" to okay, but there's a lot of mayo in there.

First off, I'm not a real big fan of fried chicken (at least if the fried chicken in discussion is KFC, Popeye's & the like).  I am a real big fan of toast, specifically texas toast & garlic toast.  The two together = why I ordered 6 slices of toast to take back to the hotel to munch on in case I got so 'slizzered' that I would be sleeping next to the toilet all night.

Moving on though, I love you Raising Cane's.  I love your toast (swap the coleslaw for an extra slice!), I love your chicken (strips!), I love your sauce (one extra please!), I love your iced tea (jug to go please!) and I love your service (always extra, super duper nice!).

Other nice perks:  PLENTY of parking.  next to a cupcake shop (which I've never tried, because I'm so full, but always swear I will the next time), drive-thru (a rarity for chicken spots), next to a Walmart (super convenient), fast service, clean bathrooms, clean eating area, funky decor.

Ok more about the food...

The chicken is always fried perfect and is fresh.  Never over cooked but always a golden brown color.  Fries don't taste like they've been cooked in week old oil and the Texas toast is amazing!

Don't forget to get an Arnold Palmer.  For those of you who are unfamiliar it's a sweet tea and lemonade mixed.",tzIlxRJz_Y3gXA9eNP7QAQ,2,1,4,x5gkLYySATawlq5w1SsbSA

I LOVE the food here, and I go all the time, but I'm giving a 3 star because of the way the restaurant is set up. The drink machine is too close to the counter so it's always packed over there and hard to refill your drink. There's nowhere for the line to go other than right by other people's tables. I was sitting in the last booth before the order counter and I could barely hear my mom who was sitting right next to me. On top of that, the restaurant's music is always reeeeeaaaaally loud. I wouldn't suggest eating inside the restaurant if you want to be able to actually enjoy eating and conversation. I've had a couple really unfortunate incidences in their ladies restroom. It's either really clean or it's a nightmare, although this isn't really their fault since customers are usually teenagers and even some of the lesser well off people around the area. I'm usually fine with waiting for my food because it's just too good to never wait in line for it.

Took 5 minutes exactly to order and get our food delivered while it was busy. That's great. We ordered the 6 piece platter with extra fries and Texas toast. Oh yeah and sauce :) food was delivered to me by a manager with a smile. Love seeing managers involved.

The breading was super crispy, though a little oily, and the inside was juicy and tender white meat chicken.  They're not small, so a few fingers is probably enough for most people, especially if you order sides.  

We got four fingers plus the Texas toast, which was a thick-cut slice of white bread with a garlicky butter spread.  The flavor was good but the bread was sort of soggy and chewy.  The Cane's sauce is a smoky, BBQ, creamy sauce that's meant for the chicken, I guess, but was also tasty on the toast.  I'm not big on fries or coleslaw, so I didn't try them, but this still means I tried half of the menu.  That's sort of crazy when you consider that I only tried three things!

Currently live in NOLA, so have access to Cane's on a regular basis.

The chicken is okay (some crispy, some parts not as crispy), the fries are good, the sweet tea is great, the coleslaw has crispy lettuce and a great flavor.

But it is the DIPPING SAUCE that does it. THAT SAUCE IS SO GOOD.
The TEXAS TOAST is so good. Crispy, buttery, goodness.

Great hangover cure (2nd to pho), and about 1.5 miles down Flamingo so close to the strip if you have a car.

Pro tip: switch out the coleslaw for another Texas Toast if you don't like slaw (or you love the toast)

They bring your meal to you if you dine in. Service (cashier and delivery of food) were not the fastest though.

Since I love chicken I asked if I could have a piece just to try.  I ate it plain, I usually don't put a lot of sauces on my chicken fingers.  I would have to say it was ok, and I was really buzzed when I took a bite.

So the next day, I'm still craving chicken.  We decide to go to Raising Cane's again, but we will eat there.  We went there and the line was pretty long for a fast food restaurant and the dining room wasn't the biggest (maybe sitting 30 people), so we tried to decide which meal to get, our group was six people, thinking the tailgate would be enough.  After more thinking, we just decided to get our own meals.  I shared with my bf, I forgot which size we got but I ate about three chicken fingers.  I would have to say it tasted better than the night before, plus I tried it with the Cajun dipping sauce each platter comes with, I liked it.  The sauce was a mayo base with Cajun spices mixed it with it, simple one may think, but it's what made the chicken taste even better.  The fries that came with the meal were decent and didn't outshine the chicken.  I didn't eat the cole slaw, I don't like it, but my bf did and he thought it was one of the best he has had.  I took a nibble on the toast but all I couldn't anything on it.  And the sweet tea wasn't bad either.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.

I will totally come here again, but will not get it to go because it tastes a lot better at the restaurant than eating at the comforts of your hotel room.  There are other Raising Cane's in the area too.  I think many of them are build ab round major colleges, this one near UNLV.  So if you like Louisiana-style fried chicken finger or get sick of eating a buffets in Vegas go to Raising Cane's.",bdWKnCMHMyPuKpfBAYJ0OQ,0,0,4,7RRGVbunbPfFV64p_viajw

Agreed with Kevin P. - friendly, quick service that is better than most fast food establishments (regardless of whether you're in Vegas or not!), and they DO give personalized service. I think that it's a part of the training...even if the things they say are scripted, they actually say it and sound like they mean it. :)

I just went to the website - the story is pretty cool. The founder was basically shot down by his professor and the banks, saying that there was no way you would succeed with a chicken finger restaurant. And now he's laughing all the way to the bank with 80 locations in 13 states.

Located in the same plaza as the Target, maybe a 5-10 minute drive from the strip. Came on a Tuesday around 1 PM, it was busy, but the lines moved quickly.

They're famous for their chicken strips, so I had to get their most popular combo, The Box Combo. It comes with 4 chicken fingers, a piece of texas toast, some fries, cole slaw, and a side of the Cane sauce. After you order, you sit down, when it's ready, they'll call out your name, and bring your food to you! Great service!

The chicken fingers are DELICIOUS! Probably some of the best chicken fingers I've had. Super crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside. The Cane sauce is pretty good, it's pretty peppery, which I liked, but other than that I couldn't really taste a flavor, maybe it was kind of tangy? All I know is that it's good with the chicken! The rest of the box is average. Fries were whatever, and the toast didn't blow me away. It was buttery and toasty, but not superb. Cole slaw wasn't the best, next time I'll be subbing the cole slaw for extra sauce!

Overall, great fast food place, definitely worth the trip out if you're visiting Vegas. It's also cheaper than most of the food you'll find on the strip!",pL4jGZ9YJEQfzprnrFAr2w,1,1,4,4No6UNTbwKkwB4QaEY5aeg
3746286,2014-10-29,1,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,"A couple of friends who were celebrating their birthdays in Vegas over the weekend wanted to try Raising Cane's for lunch. There are multiple locations around Vegas, but this one was the closest to us and off-strip.

I had no idea Raising Cane's was fast food and didn't know what to expect. The place was packed around 1:30 pm and we got into line, which moved quickly. They specialize in chicken fingers, so there aren't many options. I decided on The Box Combo, which included four chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries their famous Cane's sauce, and a regular drink for $7. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't finish the fries or slaw. The chicken tenders came in huge pieces and were super filling, although a bit dry on the inside but the yummy Cane's sauce helped with that.

Service was awful. The cashier who rang me up was clueless, distracted, and rude. I asked her what was in the coleslaw and she straight up giggled and said, ""I don't know."" I just looked at her, thinking she'd ask a manager or provide some other response, but nope; all I got back was a blank stare. Okay... After that lovely exchange, she seemed completely disinterested in me and kept making googly eyes at this guy behind me, who I assume she personally knew, and basically had a side conversation with him while I was trying to order.

Overall, Raising Cane's reminds me of another chain, Chicken Now, as they're pretty much on the same playing field. To be honest, I'd rather go to McDonald's (guilty pleasure) than come here again, but I wouldn't be opposed if friends wanted to come back. But before then, I'd like to try Strip 'N Dip Chicken Strips next time since I've had that bookmarked for awhile.",3KK7L2Q6NMfJA1Ky4Ntmdg,8,2,3,ZFaBnEgnbY7s5h7LvO-g9Q

Also, I've been fascinated by how the chicken strip game in Vegas is pretty strong with Raising Cane's and Strip N Dip.  So I had to try it to see if it was worth the hype.  And it was!

I ordered the Box Combo (http://bit.ly/2ljiNaq) which included four Chicken Fingers, crinkle-cut Fries, Cane's Sauce, Texas Toast, coleslaw, and a drink.  The chicken strips were huge, crispy, and juicier than I expected.  Also tasted good when dipping in Cane's Sauce which is like a tangy-er version of Chik-Fil-A's Signature Sauce.  Good stuff!  And I was surprised how buttery the Texas Toast was.  It almost tasted like brioche.  Overall it was a very filling and satisfying meal.  I was pretty stuffed after.

If I'm ever craving chicken strips when I'm back in Vegas, I would definitely consider going back to Raising Cane's again just because it is conveniently located near the Strip.  I still have to try Strip N Dip, so I can't say which is better, but after this one visit to Raising Cane's, I'm convinced that the Vegas' Chicken Strip game is strong no matter where you go.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,12,13,4,GeUf0LXlH5ebexbsDZMVlQ

So, I decided to swing by here to grab a small lunch on the way to the airport.

Unfortunately, none of their meal deals look like a ""small lunch."" Especially one that could be eaten on the move.

I did go inside to check out the menu at my own pace, and the store was a 9 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of the madhouse factor. All tables packed, kids screaming with no parental control and just an atmosphere I want nothing to do with on this planet.

Even an attempt to wash my hands upon entering the restaurant was not successful as both restroom doors were locked and apparently require a key from the front counter. Honestly, this is the first time I have ever experienced this at a fast food restaurant anywhere. Gas station off a highway, yes? Fast food restaurant in the city limits, nope.

While there was chaos from the customers (except the guys who work at UNLV athletics who were behind me in line), the employees were calm, friendly and got me in and out the door fast!

My ""small lunch"" comprised of two chicken fingers, a piece of Texas toast and the sauce. This was the first time I'd ever seen a dipping sauce on the menu at an additional price, but it obviously is one of their signature items and it had a zesty flavor. The Texas toast was also tasty, but I found the chicken fingers kind of average in size and flavor on their own without the sauce.

They also give free kids meals to crowd members who watched a mountain west basketball or football game, just as long as the rebels WON. Just make sure to save your ticket from the game.  When this location first opened I did not understand the hype and actually thought they were pricey. Gave Canes a second chance and now I love it.

The fries are the ruffled ones (too soggy) and the Texas toast isn't good at all (soggy as well and needs garlic or something to make it taste better). All in all the chicken is pretty solid.

Let me tell you a story. It's kind of long.

Long before my wife and I moved to Vegas, we came from Chicago as tourists many times. On our very first visit, we stopped by the Atomic Testing Museum. Afterwards, looking for a cheap lunch that we couldn't get back home, we checked her original iPhone (before everyone had one) and looked up our nearby options.

We ended up at In-n-Out on Maryland, over by UNLV. It was horribly overrated. On the way over, though, we drove past Raising Cane's, and I exclaimed, ""A restaurant devoted only to chicken fingers! We HAVE to go there.""

We didn't make it back until our next trip, and the meal I had then changed my life.

After that point, I had Cane's wherever I could find it - which was not often, since there weren't (and still aren't) any in or around Chicago. When we visited Minneapolis, we found the Cane's by the university closed on Memorial Day...so we drove to the suburbs for it. Afterwards, we bought a 32oz cup of the sauce and drove it back to Chicago. Every time we came back to Vegas, we'd have lunch here at least once - usually twice.

As you might imagine, when we moved here, we went nuts. We haven't gotten any fatter, but I did get a Caniac Club card and have racked up something like 40 visits in a year. There simply isn't any other fast food this fresh and this flavorful. When we want a cheap, delicious meal, there's only one option - box combo, double toast bbs, no slaw, extra sauce.

And that sauce is, indeed, boss. Totally fucking boss.",ITNVSsPgUIWOwgKMSqwZ2w,1,2,5,p_qroYfKHbUnHU3jum0XZQ

4024657,2010-11-18,7,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,"For those that read my last review on Rio buffet knows that I was in Vegas last week.  So while driving around town in Vegas I've passed by and noticed a huge ""Cane's"" sign.  Not sure what that was so the moment I got back to the room, I've decided to look them up.  There I realized that it's not ""Cane's"", but Raising Cane's Chicken Finger Restaurant.  So being a curious foodie that I am... I had to make a point to check them out before I'm heading back to good ol LA.

My initial reaction... chicken finger restaurant?  What the?  I really got to go see it.  Upon my arrival (10:50am), There were like 3 people getting some food in front of me.  The location is right on Flamingo and near Maryland Pkwy which you can't miss, and it's super clean!  (Sorry for the sidetrack but I'll focus now!)

So the interior was squeaky clean to me!  Perhaps it was early in the day but it definitely smelled really good, super clean, very pleasant.  So now I'm approaching the counter.

The clerk was extremely courteous!  Very nice touch because I'm a sucker for service!  I told her that this is my first time here and that I'm from LA, and she gave me a good quick run down on the business history and what they offer...  I'm sure they were part of the procedure but nevertheless it's interesting to hear.

Very simply menu... it's pretty much 3 pcs of chicken with toast, fries, cole slaw and sauce, the 4 pcs version, or the Caniac (6 pcs version which was their large combo)  Having people in my party I had to get the 6 pcs with 2 sauces...

Here's how the food tasted...  Chicken finger was great!  Solid chicken pieces, freshly prepared, but to me it was slightly small that I would have liked for the price (which I'll get to in a minute).  Crinkle fries were pretty good... (I don't complain much about fries as they are my favorite, but I don't like steak fries too much because it's like eating an entire potato)  Cane sauce was decent, it was pretty much a hybrid of mayo based sauce mixed in with chili of some sort.. not too salty which is great with a little kick to it.  Texas toast was a thick piece of loaf with very little garlic butter on it, and the cole slaw was a cole slaw... nothing out of the ordinary and mediocre at it's best.  It also came with a drink though... (They got southern sweet tea which was pretty sweet!  LOL!) 

The total of my meal came out be just under $9... it's little steep for me but the experience was very positive.  Again the chicken tender pieces could of been either bigger, or they could have substituted for more pieces considering that we are paying $9 bucks, but I have to say the quality of the chicken was very good and will definitely visit them again in the near future when I go back to Vegas.

So the history was about a guy writing a business plan on opening a chicken finger only restaurant, but was shot down by his professors, countless bankers, and eventually, worked hard a a day job and saved enough money so he can make his dream come true... Very inspiring if you ask me!  So maybe this review may not be as funny as others, but do remember that as long as you put your heart in doing what you love to do, work hard and not give up, you will eventually be rewarded!",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,13,13,4,KlLivbkatzoYKelYI-E-AA

I opted for their 3 finger combo (includes 3 strips chicken tenders, crinkled - cut fries, Texas toast, medium drink).  Their menu is very simple and consists of chicken fingers and chicken sandwiches, their selections are very similar to one another but just different sizes. Chicken strips was perfectly battered, not too salty, crispy, cooked just right, and you get them freshly made. It comes with their signature cane sauce and their Texas toast was warm, buttery, so good.

The only bummer is that I have had multiple issues with order accuracy. Which is surprising considering the order is repeatedly read back. Today's example is a box combo which was ordered and read back as ""no slaw, no fries, extra, extra toast"". My boss brought the lunch into the office and it was no toast, no slaw, extra, extra fries. It isn't a huge deal that the order was very incorrect. It would be even less of a big deal if the order were correct. I probably wouldn't have wrote a review. Who likes reviewing fast food places? Since we're here though, here is some free feedback that I feel could benefit Raising Cane's. The fries suck and take me back to public school cafeterias. The slaw is mediocre and shouldn't be packaged in the same container as the hot fingers, fries, and toast. Styrofoam is less than mediocre and isn't great for hot food either.

I was really wanting chicken fingers (hadn't had them in a long time). But I didn't want heavily breaded ones (I hate that). Enter Raising Cane's. Since we were going to Target, the Dollar Tree, and K & K, we went here. 

It was packed inside- should've known, the parking lot was full. Man, was it super loud. Our little one had just fallen asleep. Not for long! The music is pretty loud to begin with. There is a very loud yell for your name to pick up your food- even the girl next to him was like ""Dang!"" One of the few booths available were right up front, so we were stuck there. The remaining seats were stools in front of the window, opposite the cashier counter. So, the crowd, music, and the shout-out for your name made this a loud environment. Note to self: only bring the baby when he is awake. 

The food came out fast. Free Refills on soda. I love that the fingers are not full of breading. The sauce is really good (kinda like ranch mixed with thousand island dressing). I don't normally like cafeteria style french fries, but the crispy ones were tasty. Pump-style ketchup (like Wendy's and Arby's) at the counter next to the soda fountain. I must've been hungry (or anticipating, or BOTH) because I ate most of (OK, almost all of it- you caught me) my 3 finger combo meal- three fingers, sauce, texas toast, fries and drink. My husband got the Box lunch combo- mine plus another finger and coleslaw.

This is a modern, clean, good looking fast food chain. It looked brand new, and things were well maintained. However, what REALLY surprised me were the staff.

Putting some ice in so I don't have to?! That's service.

Now down to the food...it was delicious. I had only ever had their chicken before after it was cold because someone brought it for a group, however this time around it was piping hot and unbelievably good. 

There are a few reasons this is a 5 and not a 4. These are those reasons:

1) Great staff, loved the friendliness and helpfulness

Look I get that people rave about Raising Cane's, but to be perfectly honest I only believe it to be an okay establishment. It does have its place in many people's chicken strip loving hearts, but my experiences here have been lackluster.

The last time I went I got the 3-strip combo, which comes with 3 chicken strips, french fries, and of course, their tasty bread. I got a Dr. Pepper, because I don't like their sweet iced tea (ohmahgawd! I know.) It's too sweet. It's nothing like my Mother's Texas Tea, and well, she makes it better so she wins, the end.

As for the combo meal, I felt like I had more carbs than anything else. Were the fries good? Ya. Was the bread good? Ya. Were the chicken strips good? Ya. But I felt like I should have had more chicken strips than anything else, and my chicken strips were very much on the small side. If you're going to base your establishment on chicken strips, shouldn't those suckers be BIG, juicy, and plentiful?!

   Regardless that Raising Canes is named after a canine, it is fast food for a King. At Raising Canes you are not a number. When your order is ready, they will call you by your name. And there are times where they will deliver your food to you. 

  The combos are abundant in quantity and quality. My favorite is the Caniac Combo. It includes:
  *6 chicken fingers..tasty & huge.
  *2 canes sauces..little bowls instead of packets. Kind of tastes like 1,000 Island.
  * Coleslaw......very good.
  * Fries.....tastes like supermarket fries (don't they sell White Castles and Nathan's hot dogs in supermarkets anyway?). Still good
  * Texas toast....usually full by the time I get to it. 
  * 32 ounce drink.....Nothing bad to say about Coke beverages. Still, it would be cool if they had 100 flavors like Five Guys or the new Burger Kings.

  The one negative is that Raising Canes is not cheap. To be fair the prices of fast food have escalated in recent times. So $8.96 for a Codiac Combo, which is a dollar above the average fast food meal, is not off the charts expensive.

   Raising Canes is raising the standard of fast food. Now when I pass an out-of-business fast food restaurant, I know what I want to see go in there.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,1,1,4,WNb6IhUj9cVQeYd1WpcsMQ

The good part is you can always do substitutions. My sister doesn't like their Texas toast (a preference) so she ask for substitution of extra fries which they were willing to substitute. 

Always ask for extra sauce as well! One of the reasons for coming back to Raising Cane's is for their sauce.

The customer service is outstanding. The young kid with the ""poofy"" ( I mean that in a nice way) who brings out the food is a sweetie.  The counter girls are also very efficient, even though it is so busy in there. 

Now, the chaos!  The patrons!  This place is super busy during mid day and there were a group of rude, loud, obnoxious girls in BIKINIS eating while all the mothers inside were trying to distract their kids from noticing.

I ordered one of the meals. Chicken tenders, texas toast, and fries. 

I really liked it. The chicken tenders had a good amount of batter and crisp. The toast was soft on the inside, would've preferred it grilled longer, I like my toast to have more crisp when grilled. The fries and Cane's sauce were tasty as well.

Raising Canes has got to be one of my favorite fast food places for chicken! Their chicken fingers are always yummy, and the dipping sauce for them is so good. It adds a kick of flavor to each chicken finger, and tastes great with the fries and texas toast as well! My favorite thing about eating here has to be the texas toast. Please order extra, you will not regret this decision. If you don't care for coleslaw like me, you can ask them to trade it out for another piece of toast! It's so great! 

I definitely recommend coming here if you like cheap, but delicious fast food.",Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,0,0,4,0Nn-AzRPLMYNtFrNV75lnA

Raising Cane's are one of the many businesses that Las Vegas have that the Bay Area or the entire state of California don't. Maybe one day that founder Todd Graves will work on expanding the franchise to California. Hopefully, the Bay Area will be first. 

I was here and ordered the ""3-strip"" Combo. For $6.99, I get three battered boneless chicken breast strips, with a side of fries, spicy dipping sauce and a thick ""Texas-Style"" grilled toast. I usually get chicken strips from businesses like Popeye or KFC, but Raising Cane's version are a tad better than the other competitors. I also get a fountain soda (Coke) with my meal.

Raising Cane's, let me count the ways I love thee!  I've been wanting to try for a while but I thought, ""how good can a place that only serves chicken fingers be?""  I got SCHOOLED.  It can be *really* good.  

They serve up juicy and fresh (not frozen) chicken tenders; Texas toast, which is the best side ever; crinkle cut french fries, which just hit the spot sometimes, you know?  I did think the french fry portion was a little modest, so-to-speak.  But I chose the 3-finger meal and was full afterwards.  The dipping sauce is the real deal - so good.  My husband raved about the crushed iced.  I was all, ""really?  The crushed ice, babe??""  But I admit, there's just something about it lol.  I do think it's strange that lemonade is 10 cents extra but no biggie, it's good.  

This location feels like it should be UNLV's student center lol.  Just has that college feel.  It's cool though.  I remember those days and would have been there almost every day!

I now have a happy full stomach.  I'll be back.",RBVx19UH3A6QRKxi5tBaDQ,0,0,4,gprXbbWZ0tU2pKCMm5x3Rw

5647978,2018-04-24,8,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,"Unfortunately, this place was disappointing. I was expecting the greatest chicken tenders ever and it was the complete opposite. 

Chicken tenders has that crispy and crunchy texture on the outside, with the juicy meat, however, that's just it. There's no seasoning and it was very bland. I was later told by another customer who dines there regularly that Raising Cane is known for their Cajun dipping sauce. Meh. I prefer it on the chicken. 

The restaurant is pretty small and fills up quick! It's busy, but I wouldn't wait for this chicken. The sauce isn't spectacular so I may not come back.",KDuWv96lLrfkKQ-4KtaU8w,15,12,2,zvp75I0EVQxcjdCtY2riCw
5657828,2010-08-03,0,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,"I've heard a lot about this place and the reviews were stellar so on my last trip to Vegas I decided to give them a shot. For fast food it is good, but there are a million bars and restaurants that have better chicken fingers. 

I will say that the chicken itself was very moist, tender and juicy. They get credit (and the 3rd star) for that. Unfortunately the breading was very bland and tasteless and the sauce was only okay.

Be prepared, the ONLY thing this place sells is chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich made from chicken fingers. So if you are eating with someone who might want a burger or something else you will need to go elsewhere.

I was quite disappointed that they didn't appear to have a selection of sauces. I would have preferred a good BBQ sauce to their Canes Sauce, but considering the lack of options on their menu I guess their business plan is to tell people what to eat rather than let them decide what they want for themselves.

Again, not bad I guess for fast food, definitely better than the chicken strips at Burger King or Jack-in-the-Box (not that the bar there is set that high) but if you really want good chicken fingers you can do much better.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,3,0,3,oNbrZnGvQoJPVFPidzwuWQ

This fast food joint had a lot of people around lunch, but we still managed to get a table and my food pretty quick. 

Ordered the CANIAC COMBO which has 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, 2 cane sauces, and a large sweet tea. I split it with my friend, so we had to order an extra toast. The food was amazing!! The sweet tea tastes exactly like McDonald's sweet tea....still refreshing. The chicken fingers and toast were ON POINT.

The service was just as great as the food. Each employee had a smile on their face and were never hesitant when I asked for something.

Definitely a place to eat when you want something different and fast, especially if you're not from Vegas. Great place to eat right before heading home...can't wait to go back",Vl-c9zRq-tcst4uC8GG1hw,2,1,4,GaZ3MeICbYwIxzYdBJVAgA

Without even stopping by the strip or our hotel yet, we came straight here right after exiting the freeway after a 6 hour drive waiting to fill our hungry stomachs with chicken. Perfect meal to start or end your Vegas weekend.

I got the box combo. The chicken was fresh, still steaming and made to order, and super tender and crispy. The sweet tea is a must! I also love the bread. So glad my friend didn't want it so I could have a second slice. It's buttery and perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside. I opted for the box combo since it has coleslaw included. Makes for a nice fresh touch when mostly everything on the plate is fried. And of course as everyone's already mentioned, the sauce is great.

You definitely get your money's worth! Not expensive at all and you'll most likely be taking a box to go for your leftovers. A sure go to next time I'm in town.",j3lFpCwGJXbd0_-Q35sfbg,0,0,5,GyCTYpZqrXJhTq4cCjbQnw
