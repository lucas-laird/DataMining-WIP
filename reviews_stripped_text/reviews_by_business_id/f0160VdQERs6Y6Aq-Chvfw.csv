The ceiling is very low and the room is small. We had a group having a business meeting next to us. Honestly I felt that I was apart of the meeting. The space was so tight that our waitress stood behind me to take my order.  I didn't realize that she was there until my husband said something. The food is good, but not great. I would rather go to the Bouchon. Also the restaurant has no windows to the outside for those who care.",UPcJWzP6VBv31bl-TrAfzQ,0,0,2,4NZyFCY2VHoYAjNs2bMYKQ

I ate here for lunch twice during my 4-day trip. Definitely a small place, in a kind of hard-to-find location (take the guest room elevators up to the pool floor, it's right before you walk out to the pool area).

I tried the breakfast wrap, sonoran scramble, grilled ahi tuna sandwich, chicken satay, and a smoothie. I love how everything is fresh and organic...I could just taste the freshness! I could even tell that the salsa was made with fresh ingredients. I loved how the breakfast meals came with a small side of fresh fruits.

My favorites were the breakfast wrap (with organic eggs, veg, and sprouted whole wheat tortilla) and the open-faced ahi sandwich. My least favorite was the chicken satay. It was a bit dry and the flavoring wasn't as strong as I'd like. 

I was debating between a 4 or 5 star. 
5 stars because I feel like it's the most high quality AND only organic, healthy option there is ON the Strip. Not to mention that the food is yummy.
4 stars because the portions are a bit on the smaller size for the price. Although I left satisfied but not bloated, my hubby who loves to eat meat and large portions was still hungry.",xA4JmvFap_i0PsUb3nR-IQ,0,0,4,t2RsZEFYP5TBjNO2yudmyQ

The food quality and service just undelivered relative to other places within the Palazzo.  

The server forgot to bring our ordered items - the spinach omelette - did not have any spinach.  After it was pointed out to the server, his response was, ""...they might have not put enough in it - just keep eating, it should be there somewhere...""  Not quite the response you expect from such an establishment.  

The items that he forgot also, were not some exotic things, it was Equal (for the coffee), skim milk, and avocado - all of which came at different times during our meal - almost to the point where there was no value in bringing it.  The eggs tasted very ordinary and frankly a bit cold - the image of healthy and organic  undelivered in all aspects (taste, quality) and the service (or lack thereof) did not help.

At the end of the meal - the server felt bad and brought us free OJ (on the house), frankly I would have been happy to pay for the OJ if the other stuff had been up to par.

First off- if not in a large group sit at the bar for breakfast and hope you get Jose. He is super nice, attentive, and seems to genuinely care.

Smoothie- they have a few fruit smoothies and you can customize. They are made with organic juices and frozen fruit and you can add in protein and other supplements.
Wasn't a wow- and honestly they could use an organic protein vs the natural powder they carry.

Next I had the chorizo (homemade grass fed) and organic eggs- if you don't eat corn take out the tortilla strips and the corn (this wasn't listed on the menu). When I got my food and saw the corn I tried to pick around and Jose noticed and went back to the kitchen and explained the error and had a new scramble out in minutes. Thank you Jose!

Bottom line clean, organic, healthy options.

They slopped some wilted, yellow greens on a plate and topped it with a fishy tasting salmon. Not very good at all. Edamame was totally undercooked also. My husband got the veggie stir fry with chicken. Once again it was as if they threw the food onto the plate without any consideration for presentation. So sloppy. 

Service was terrible as well. The woman worked very hard but was so unfriendly and unwelcoming. Very slow and forgot an addition to salad

One short of five stars because I'm frugal and my vegan warm vegetable tofu salad was $23. Now that we have that out of the way, let's get down to the nitty gritty. 

PROS
+ They have vegan options - #winning
+ Warm vegetable tofu salad was light, tangy and tasty 
+ Service made me feel like royalty (bartender was fab!)
+ Canyon Ranch is SO beautiful and clean
+ Didn't wait long at all for my food to arrive 

CONS
- If you're cheap, I mean frugal, like me then the prices may freak you out

(Q): Would I go back?
(A): Yes, but not as often as I'd like because it's a little pricey. 

(Q): Do they have a large selection on the menu?
(A): To my surprise, yes they do. However, I'm vegan so my options were limited. I did notice a lot of fun blueberry treats for breakfast and brunch which were highlighted as feature items. 

(Q): Should you check this place out?
(A): I say go for it, even if it's just once. You may think my one con listed, isn't really a con for you at all. Then you can come back here and call me cheap but then thank me for the recommendation. ;)",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,3,2,4,MVQzPuth1Ili2CxyBt2Slg

We also watched him handle some rude guests with ease - so charming! We appreciated his service and company so we decided to head back the following day. We had another fantastic meal. I love that as a healthy eater, I was able to order off the menu without modifying anything. The food is so good, nutritious and makes you feel recharged.. of course I had a gimlet to wash it down. Made to perfection by Armando.  We met Daniella this 2nd time.  She took care of us while Armando stepped away. She was very professional and detail oriented making sure our beverages were expertly prepared and that we were set up to take anything to go. We came back a third time (farewell breakfast) and had the pleasure of dining with Daniella again. As a service veteran who rarely eats out anymore, she has restored my faith in the service industry!

Why I'd come back:
- The Berry Tea they served was enough to bring back my hungover friend to earth, which meant I wasn't left without a spa buddy.
- It's very rare that a restaurant (esp. in Vegas) dedicate its menu entirely to healthy dishes.  
- I seriously left this restaurant with a different perspective, enough that I want to incorporate organic food in at least 1/3 of my meals, if not more.  I felt full, yet clean.  Yes, I paid $11.00 for a small portion, but really...you should eat to live or just barely enough to get you full,... not to have 3 days of leftovers.  I felt more energized.  One might say it's due to some sort of placebo effect, but I've made feeble attempts at supposed ""healthy eating"", and you could certainly feel the difference here.

It needed another teaspoon of oil. I know they're trying to be healthy, but another teaspoon of olive oil won't break your diet. The babaganoj was boring and bland. I couldn't even taste it. I knew I was eating something, but it tasted like nothing. Could have bought a better tub at the store for $1.59 instead of paying $7 for dry/tasteless food. 

The shrimp and goat cheese quesadilla....I think I could make it better. There was so little goat cheese, that I forgot there was goat cheese in it till someone mentioned it. The shrimp (which were sustaniably farmed) were small and seemed previously frozen, and the kind you find in crappy shrimp cocktail. There was a 1"" ring around the edge of my tortilla where there was no goat cheese, and barely a tablespoon of goat cheese to cover the tortilla. Not worth $14.

It was so good that I only used a small amount of maple syrup because I didn't want it to overwhelm the fruit.  Served with the French toast was a small container of fresh fruit.

This grill is designed to serve healthy or more healthy food.  There's nutrition information on the menu for most items.  

Coffee was brought quickly and refilled often.

This really was a pleasant breakfast and something off the beaten path right on the Strip.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,0,0,4,qsZbGyr87HJRtPfRZ13fhA

I am a calorie counter, I work out every day (yes, even on vacation in Vegas), and I always struggle with finding good food choices that I can feel won't burst my pant seams while traveling.  Also, considering I do like to treat myself with fancier dinners while traveling in Vegas, all I really want for lunch is something simple and low calorie, keeping me full until dinner.  This place was perfect.

Went here twice during my last trip...had the berry pancakes for 365 calories the first time and the French toast for 315 calories the second time.  Both meals included a small side of fruit, and I also ordered a small side of cottage cheese.  All of the ingredients included in the meal are organic, and bursting with flavor.  The prices are not bad either...I'm not talking Denny's prices, but around $40 for two people, which isn't too bad for a Vegas, poolside cafe, especially considering the food's organic nature.

Also of note, the restaurant does have gluten free options, which was great for my husband who has celiecs.  He enjoyed a fresh omelet both times we ate there, and he also raved about the homemade cola he ordered (yes, they have homemade cola and I tried a sip,,,pretty tangy and uniquely good).

The only reason I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars was due to the service.  We had the same waitress both times we went, and she just seemed put out by the entire experience of waitressing.  I know that she wasn't the one on vacation, but it would have been nice for her to be a bit more friendly...impressions are important, and a restaurant should know that!   Regardless, I know we'll be back to this restaurant when we return to the Palazzo, which can't be soon enough for me!!",XBtnvZJcPpeY1zbOxrUx6w,0,0,4,mGUNaF2OFnD8JPQBiGujKw

Mom the savory side with hints of cardamom. We ordered the quinoa portobello on spinach as  our entree and loved it! We were both famished and splitting three was a good choice. Dessert was $3 so we obviously had to give the chocolate mousse a shot. Yumm. Most of the people dining were in spa robes and the place was pretty empty for a Friday afternoon.

We both ordered coffees, which came very quickly and were very good.  We also both got the Sonoran Scramble, a delicious medley of eggs, tomatoes, chiles, onions, garlic, cilantro, tortilla strips, avocado, and best of all, chorizo (all for 315 calories!).  It sounds like A LOT, but the portion size was perfect and the dish was spot-on flavorful.  I loved the slice of avocado on top - yummy yum yum.  Best of all, it came with a very small side of fresh berries that were incredibly delicious and balanced against the egg dish. We also ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes, which were super good, but mostly went uneaten since the scramble was so filling.

Between 4 of us we had the Caribbean french toast, breakfast wrap, a side of berries, toast and jam and a chicken sandwich.

I had:
* the pineapple smoothie (great, but honestly how hard is it to make a bad smoothie!)
* the baked mozzerella - eh not so good. It was globby cheese sitting on a plate with breading just crumbled on top in a sea of not so good tomato sauce... oh and it was TINY.
* Chicken satay - again hard to screw up!
* this place does serve booze (they can bring it to you while you're getting a mani/pedi), although I didn't try any of their organic wines and whatnot myself. 

I loved how everything had a calorie count next to it! So great when you're trying to eat healthy. Unfortunately none of my dining companions were that happy with their meals (spaghetti, tuna melt).. everything was just so-so.
