But I'm happy my curiosity got the best of me.  I was blown away again with the deliciousness... OMG!! That was delicious. The owner actually helped me to decide on a delicious chicken entree, balsamic rice and some naan. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, the food is delicious and you can't beat the prices here.",FV09hP2Nq6s_AwUWSkGJeQ,11,11,5,5bVqe9NxiRoSmycrfpIZ5w

Great service, great food and very friendly to your wallet.

Food was amazing. Tried Chinese at lunch and they had good quantity of each dish
Returned again for dinner and tried indian food. 
Specially Nihari and kofta was very delicious, and I am positive for other items too
The restaurant is not at all expensive. Tea is for $0.50 
Must try for anyone looking for quality food in vegas 
Also the place is very very clean and owner is very humble

LISTEN UP YALL: This place is going to be hard to beat. I would love to say it's cheap eats, but then you'd be probably stop reading this review AND this place is just so much more than that. 

Sure, it's much less expensive than other HALAL places in the valley - but the food is a GREAT DEAL better than other places *ahem, read my other reviews* My mom usually makes all the dishes that are on the menu here and being 100% Pakistani, she's known to be GAME for her Sindhi biryani, shami kabobs, beef nihari, etc. I'm so PLEASED to say that each dish that we tried at this place tasted AUTHENTIC and my tastebuds were surprised! 

As another reviewer stated, the prices & food provided definitely are cheaper than what you'd spend at home making it! 

So here it is, the *list* 

Pros: 
1. SPACIOUS. The maximum capacity for Al Madina states that it can be occupied by 46 people at most. However, if you taste the food once, I guarantee you'll be back and you'll bring back the ""khandaan"" #extendedfam
2. Chinese, Indian, American ($2.99 breakfast?!). HOLY SMOKES this place has a lot of choices. I wasn't able to taste the Chinese that evening because it seemed like a soft grand opening - but I'm excited to get my hands on some of that food too! 
3. the PRICE IS RIGHT! Ever pay $2 at your local Indian restaurant for a cup of hot masala tea? Me too, it sucks. Al Madina's chai is properly hand made, not any of that GMO ish...and it's 50 CENTS for tea!! *I've been told by the owner that the prices will NEVER change; I hope that's true because if they do, so will this review ;)* 
4. A bit more than adequate portion sizes. I think that's great for large family sizes. SHARE your food, mom & pop style. I went with my in-laws and all 5 of us were able to be really full REALLY fast. 
5. Friendly, ATTENTIVE owner (Syed) & staff. Our needs were addressed quickly, water was never left empty, chutneys and other things were ALWAYS offered, and so was that chai! Recommendations were given, and if you know me you know I'm the inquisitive type so all my questions were answered too! 

Cons (suggestions for the restaurant): 
1. Probably not too much of a bad thing for me, but if you prefer to have less oil in your food - go ahead and let them know. I come from a family where oil (and salt) is used as staple ingredients so it doesn't bother me much! 
2. Bright lights - it was shining as bright as diamonds and it was 8:30 pm ! A little dimmer and it would seriously have the perfect atmosphere. 

PS. Grand opening is after Ramadan. God Willing (InshAllah) they will have a place for CHAATS opening up in a couple of months next door. For those folks thinking I just wrote chats instead of chaAts - that's CODE for delicious Indian snacks *please google* :) #panipuri #paprichaat",n9zwrWp8EeB9ODTitKZYsw,6,6,5,mue3HpGM_IY4ODjLK2Ffmw

Moreover the prices are unbelievably low. The owner Saeed is very personable and so is the chef Adam who is from Morocco . You must try this restaurant. You can chose from Indian, Chinese or Moroccan dishes. Soft drinks or bottled water are only 50 cents!! So is the coffee. You must try the soups too. I have eaten in many restaurants frequented by locals in Las Vegas and my recommendation does not come lightly.
I know that I will be a frequent flier here :) So should you. Bring your family and friends.",bxNO14lGdhM_ns18gjZI-g,3,3,5,QzWKGgxKo8G7Gyx-twaNYA

Walked in and was greeted by a punch in the face with a funky (bad) smell that lingered throughout the restaurant. There was a man sitting behind the counter at the front that seated us down and soon after a server came to ask if we wanted anything to drink. After the second time we were asked if we were ready yet to which we responded a few more minutes and he disappeared to the back. But when we were ready, he was still nowhere to be found so we kindly got the attention of the man chilling behind the counter to order but he walks away to the back to get the server. Okaaaaaaay, so he doesn't take the orders at all that's fine. Does he chill by the counter as a cook/security perhaps? But once our server came and took our order, the same exact man stood right besides him as we ordered and constantly repeated the item we pointed at. I'm guessing both are in charge of making the food, but isn't that a bit of a security problem as no one else is watching or tending to customers (if there were any)? Decided halfway through to ask for it to be placed in to-go boxes but had to go shout into the kitchen as no one else was outside to ask. Fast forward to a mysterious bag of food placed on the counter and the man chilling back at his counter again. Maybe it's mine? Maybe it's another guy's since he was sitting at a table waiting too. Make eye contact. Nothing. Okay maybe it's ours. Go up to pay the guy just stares and looks elsewhere while standing right in front of him. Maybe he's waiting for the server to translate? 3-4 awkward minutes pass after sitting back down since clearly he wasn't going to do anything and he finally says ""ready."" Wow really?! Okay back to paying. And still, he's not stating the total or showing us the bill to see what was charged to make sure--just stare. Had to scout for the screen that states the amount due. 
Having a language barrier is completely fine, but running a business with zero communication is not. Not even the basics of a point and order from a menu, hello goodbye, yes no, thank you, and numbers. At least the server was trying his best to handle the customer service part of his job. 
Contrary to basically all the reviews here praising this restaurant, I feel they are all phony. The food was very much not worth the price. I get it. You get what you pay for. But the portions are just ridiculous! For a couple dollars more for the SAME meal elsewhere, you'd get a full portion. At a discount of a few bucks less than regular prices, this place will literally give you only 1/4 of the portion DESPITE being HALF of the regular pricing. Expect only 2-3 pieces of meat per bowl of rice",ooTnyvza14szGKWm3zKbAA,0,0,2,-ELQAeB2fmh-bAJuvpn-CA
