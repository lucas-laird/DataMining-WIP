We arrived here for lunch at 1115 ish, and stood in a short line. The Asian male that was taking the initial orders appeared to be new, due to his slow pace and lack of communication with co-workers. The two Hispanic looking females were efficient and should've moved the new guy to a different spot maybe to the cashier spot or wipe tables something else. Let this new guy learn after the lunch crowd has moved on. That's just my opinion as a customer.

By the time I finally got to order, the mixed veggies were almost out so he set my plate aside until more veggies were made, cool. But for some reason I don't think the cooks heard him because other orders after mines started to pile up and my plate got mixed in with the next guys order. Luckily they write your order on the box but it caused some unnecessary confusion and slowed the line down. After that I wasn't even hungry nor did I want be inside of there anymore.

I normally get pot stickers and crab or the fried shrimp instead but today all of them were very old and burnt from being under the lamps. Its very sad that i havent been able to say great food at any point at this location.  
Im hoping someone there will read a review and fix ANY of the issues they have with the food. For 22.00 i just expect more from Panda.

Its gone to 22-24 
They have been charging 3.90 for the 3rd item
On each plate. 
I asked my son to watch and he forgets so today i got receipt
I chicken bowl and a 3 item dinner no shrimp today

4654914,2013-11-17,4,r2vAwakuF7qXNtQDuMEFpA,"If I had seen a Chinese restaurant in the vicinity of Charlie Frias Park that is rated highly, I would of made it lunch. I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch specials. They are one of the best deals in town. I didn't do my homework, and after burning fuel driving around, I wanted to grab lunch and get on with exploring Charlie Frias Park. I checked-in at the Panda.

  These days my opinion of the Panda has changed. The average $9 plus tax transaction for a two item combo and medium beverage trails behind the pricing of genuine Chinese restaurants. Especially at lunch. 

  In my book, Panda Express is a good choice when it is in a large place with a captive audience or when the area lacks good Chinese restaurants. This location is an example. It is in a location where a transient stretch of Tropicana merges into Las Vegas communities. The majority of restaurants are fast food eateries in the shadow of the Orleans. When I dine here it is more out of convenience than hunger. In my situation it was near Charlie Frias Park, a quick yet creepy walk.

  This Panda has a large footprint. I cannot see a problem with ever getting a table. 

  The chicken with mushrooms, fried rice (they also have brown), and chow mein was fast food good.  Where Panda outbeats local Chinese restaurant lunch specials is in their chow mein. At the local restaurants I often leave over the chow mein noodles where in Panda, the chow mein noodles on my plate turns to air. Problem! Chicken with mushrooms was not my food of choice. This location suffered from what I call the Panda Syndrom. This is a major flaw when the food trays are empty causing a presentation of metal and cooking oils (to put it kindly). This looks bad. They would be doing the customer a favor by putting a cover over the empty food trays. Possibly showing a panda with a frown saying ""Sorry we will be cooking new food.""

  When there is a good Chinese restaurant nearby and I am unrushed I will probably pass over Panda. However, when I am hungry and want to move on, the Panda will probably get some of my check-in love.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,7,6,3,Ei9IgRgdvaaZyu9LaPboqg

I know this location is somewhat near Chinatown but to be honest I've only eaten Chinese in that area @ one place and it was my worst experience so I chose to just take her here.. cheap good Chinese.

2 ITEM ENTREE: We wanted to try the new Kobari beef but the bin was empty. So... I asked the only girl behind the counter how long would we wait before the next batch was made. She didnt seem to understand what I said and gave me and my mom a sample of 2 small pieces of beef left @ the edge of the barren pan. (not what I asked for but GREAT!.. it was goooooood!) I was excited.. so I asked my quetion again. Nope didn't understand. so I asked her in spanish (what little I could muster up) ""cuando va estar lista la carne?""... nope... well hell couldn't figure out what her primary language was b/c it wasnt chinese. My mom finally said I think she's cuban or PR or something b/c we heard her speaking Spanish as we left. SO.. she didn't answer me on purpose. How does a place stay open if you cant order?  
We hung bk for a few minutes discussing if we should just find another Panda Express or go next door to the Orleans and eat @ their Chinese place. We decided we'll just wait for the nxt batch and we pointed to whatever we wanted - Kobari beef and Beef & broccoli. sooo... good.

Had the fire cracker chicken and it tasted excellent. Portions are small and the place makes 2000% profit on white rice (which I usually don't get) charging $2 for something that costs a dime to make, no thanks.

It's panda express so everyone know what that means cheap, typical, and pretty tasty Chinese food. It's near my job and though there are many other Chinese restaurants this one is quick and I know what I'm getting, and usually I'm lucky to get it right out of the Wok, and even it wasn't--- I still get a bowl to go.",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,1,1,3,LB-zlzFHqCeAQl8BEqkC9w

It is Saturday Aug 2nd at 4:30pm and I am literally watching two employees argue at the register about how to do ones job.  The lady in green is going off on the cashier in red, why do I need to see or ESPECIALLY hear any of his.  Where is the manager.......that is why 1 star!!!!  Stupid!!!!   One in green needs to be reprimanded!",jv-4qwApg9MqUSB63m56ug,2,1,1,XxCGO6k_fvXM2vAOMZJsgg

For $1.25 extra, the honey-walnut shrimp should be pretty darn good, it was just ok.  Like the rest of the meal (and what other reviews have said), ok place to stop by if you are hungry but not for really good food.",Hlmr1pEVgPGg86ZOw-T0Dw,0,0,2,Hzln8sbmR3rpMVs81olY2w
5816201,2017-02-10,0,r2vAwakuF7qXNtQDuMEFpA,"Best place to go for a quick, affordable freshly made meal in front of you.  You are always offered free samples of any item before purchase.  That does not happen in other food establishments.  Thanks to Melissa, who I think is the manager, she is always happy friendly, I like to see employees eating at the place they work.  That tells me that the place is super clean, beyond what we see, the food is just as tasty to the employee.  Thats Melissa and your staff for your great attitude and delivery each time of good affordable fresh food. The best part is that if you do the survey on your receipt, you get a FREE entree!  Cant beat the great deal here.  I do agree that the meat portions seem to be shrinking, I have to search through all the onions to find it....I am sure the employees hate enforcing that new rule.",UCajrzkcn6sTOGACxRaZQg,0,0,5,4G2zN_xb69RwYQ7motSOGg

She originally didn't know that this location existed & she was also pleasantly surprised.

Upon arrival, we were greeted very nicely and walked into a very clean restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive. 

I enjoyed the fact that they offer steamed brown rice and brown fried rice. It is nice to see such options.

The food was amazingly fresh, my vegetables cooked perfectly with some crunch to it. It wasn't heavy in oil or grease to my surprise either. I have ate at other Panda Express' before but I do not ever recall leaving one, thinking that my food was pretty good and that I would return. They also carry this peach green tea that I cannot get enough of. 

One of the staff members walked around while we ate and asked everyone if everything was okay. He did this a couple of times during my visit & he made sure to not ask the same customer twice. I like that.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,6,4,zzfA1T-iJQxFOPu56M-34w

Love PE, but I will never go back to this location and I saw that other people had same problem",FMeLh_hS_7iGk7VfaAWHEA,0,0,1,XCpH-laZUnV0A4cn8WBezw
