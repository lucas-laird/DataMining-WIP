1673246,2018-04-14,7,zN4f3aLeCuIhCTPRH0di-A,"A Mexican restaurant adjacent to my gym only spells trouble but somehow I've only popped in a couple of times. Their daily HH runs 4-6:30, with food and drink specials, and usually overlaps with my workouts. I park on the other side of the building to avoid the temptation. I've been in a couple of times and tried a considerable portion of the menu with friends. Service alternately attentive and friendly or the exact opposite. Note that they have discontinued their weekend brunch.

HITS: 
+ Their table salsas. One roasted, one green, and one with a vaguely Asian flavor with sesame and tamarind? Could not stop eating them.
+ Guacamole del Mar with crab, parmesan, and roasted garlic: The seafood and dairy add some interesting notes to the classic guac without overpowering it. Nice for something different.
+ Octopus Salteado: This was barely a hit. The portion was good for the price and I mostly liked the sauce but the amount was overwhelming. Presentation is messy and unappealing, you won't win over any people who don't already love octopus. 
+ Crab & Shrimp Relleno: Huge portion, definitely a dish to share. Sauce was good, pepper was huge, ample filling, and went well the cilantro rice. Despite being a seafood dish, this was very heavy.
+ Duck Carnitas: Very good! Nicely crispy, paired well with the berry jalapeno chutney, would get again but wish they made their tortillas in house.

MISSES: 
- Queso Fundido: wasn't stringy, didn't pull, was alternately watery and clumpy, wasn't quite executed right, maybe not hot enough?
- Campechana Ceviche: Classic Mexican seafood cocktail, but inconsistent across two visits with drastically different tastes. Seafood was fresh, though.
- Gnocchi Mexicano: A vegetarian pasta dish at Mexican restaurant? It didn't work. Again, super heavy with a portion size fit for a family. I liked the guajillo-mushroom cream sauce but it was very heavy and the pasta was gummy and the dish vaguely unbalanced. 

UNDECIDED: the fact that this is even a category is why my rating sits at a solidly average three stars for ""A-OK""
? Lobster & Chorizo Empanadas: Interesting. Didn't taste distinctly of lobster or chorizo. Seemed overpriced ($15) for the portion. Liked the pastry though.
? Surf & Turf Pizza: crust was way too thick and the (admittedly plentiful) toppings didn't harmonize.
? Ceviche de la Casa: fresh but notably smaller portion than other ceviches despite lower quality ingredients, and flavors were not well distributed.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,11,3,UZzxNbA05fSyiLyeq9-DPw

Great Mexican food is hard to come by after living in San Diego. It is like going to the NFL and then being sent to a high school team, lol.

But this place had rave reviews, so I took a chance and ordered the street tacos and carne asada fries.

The delivery was very fast and only took 20 minutes. First off, they included some free chips and salsa, which is a nice touch. 

I dug into the street tacos, which were a mix of carne asada, pork, chicken, and a few other meats. All pretty good. The carne asada fries were also pretty good, and the portion sizes were generous for both.

While it isn't up to San Diego level, it is a good rendition and I would order from here again.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,2,1,4,K2A2hLBIik73bcPbWgtW4g

The complimentary chips and salsa with 3 salsas came to the table. The chips were crunchy and not oily and my fave sauce was Macho.

We ordered the Octopus Salteado, came out very fresh, and the sauces on it were flavorful. That was our favorite dish.

Chicken wings was ok and Pork Belly slider needs some sauce on it, it was not pork belly and was bland.

I ordered a campechana ceviche to start, duck carnitas for my entrée, and flan for dessert.  The campechana consisted of shrimp, mussels, octopus, crab, and avocado with an ancho chipotle sauce.  It was outstanding.  A good amount of seafood with a spicy sauce to work with the citrus.

The duck carnitas were good but the duck was a bit dry.  Having three kinds of salsa helped.  The dish was something quite different for a Mexican restaurant.

Dessert of orange flavored flan was another outstanding dish.  The beginning and end of the meal were the best parts.

My server was Ashley and she was very helpful with questions I had and with always keeping my iced tea filled.

They where happy to explain the menu to me; when the staff sat us down near the bar? she took our orders then we got to talking and I love when businesses take the time out to say hello to there customers. I felt like they where family right away as if I just came to a backyard BBQ. But the restaurants looks nothing like a backyard lol
It is very settling on the eyes but decorated beautifully with a spin of fun. When our food came out I tasted the fries and I could not believe how delicious they where. And let me tell you I always order this off any menu when going to restaurants. But WOW they have some amazing dishes I even tried my best friends gnocchi mexicano and could not believe how tasty it was and I don't do mushrooms ever.

The pre-meal chips and salsa are delicious, each of the 3 salsas have true authentic mexican flavors. My only complaint would be to make the chips a little bigger, it was hard to scoop all the salsa-y goodness onto the very small chips they provide.

Guacamole portion is huge and super yummy, nice to see they aren't skimpy on the avocados. Chipotle should take some notes....

I've ordered the tacos al pastor twice now and each time they have not disappointed, pork isn't fatty and pineapple is perfectly grilled.  My boo thangggg ordered the chicken fajitas and they were fantastic! Both entrees were accompanied by mexican rice and refried beans.

Okay, it was a Saturday night, two families were leaving as we were going in, so why were we the only ones in the dining room? I can't figure it out, given all the great reviews.

Our waiter, Bernie, was the best - attentive, funny, and all-around charming, and we thoroughly enjoyed talking with him and learning about how (oops! I almost spoiled his surprise)...

My traditional margarita came exactly as I asked, without salt and just a little ice, and was appropriately tangy. Good start.

We skipped appetizers because we don't eat a lot and went straight to the main event. I ordered the Pollo Sarandeado, which turned out to be a beautiful dish - a juicy, Frenched chicken breast with an eye-fetching portion of rice, along with a huge, separate side of black beans. I was happy, because I had forgotten to specify that I wanted my beans black, instead of pink, refried, or any other way. I wasn't aware that the sauce was a cream sauce, or I probably wouldn't have ordered that dish - ya know, high fat, yada yada. So I ignored that fact and plunged in, and my taste buds thanked me, even if my waistline, or lack of one, didn't. It was sublimely delicious!

The hubs, the supreme chicken man, went for the Fajita Salad. It was a large portion, much bigger than it appears in my photo. He absolutely adored it. I tried some, too, and boy, do I love those rajas.

Even though we loved the flan we had for dessert last visit, we skipped it this time. Too full.  But there's always a next time!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,7,7,5,uM_4Y3PQ_zuuJZto3Uaryg

I was also attracted by the ambitious menu which includes a mix of both traditional dishes and some highly innovative ones.  On entering, I realized the restaurant space was once occupied by Rosemary's - sigh.  We had made Opentable reservations for a Saturday evening which proved to be unnecessary as the restaurant was only about 1/2 full, the bar less so.  A trio of what I believe were house made salsas accompanied by a bowl of taco chips were brought to the table while we reviewed the menu.  My wife chose the Pacific halibut with pineapple mango tequila sauce that included both black beans and cilantro rice.  The sauce nearly overwhelmed plate perhaps in recognition of the halibut being very dry due to overcooking.  I gravitated to the bone-in short rib with quajillo chipolte mole that was topped with crispy onions and accompanied by charro beans and roasted corn.  The biggest problem was the short-rib was unusually stringy and dry, once again requiring massive amounts of sauce to make it more palatable.  Given the upscale pricing, we were not overly impressed.  On a more positive note, the service throughout was very good.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,2,1,3,8Ey0xC8QHf703H_E_AlcUA

They give you complimentary chips and salsa and the Macho sauce (the darkest one) is the best.  It has a smiley flavor and made out of helio peppers.

The octopus was cooked perfectly with a sauce that tasted both buttery yet seemed to have mustard seed as an ingredient which gave it a ""fun"" texture.

My friend ordered tacos and complimented how good they tasted.  They looked very appealing but my attentions were on eating my octopus.  I also ordered a combination plate that included a cheese chile relleno, beef enchilada, beans & rice.  The enchilada tasted like a unique recipe and quite delicious.

The Shrimp Sope is a grand slam. My favorite thing on the menu period. 

The pork tamale is super good. Tamales always seem to be a little dry everywhere else. Not here, and the green salsa makes the difference.

Today I had a bone-in short rib with a guajillo chipotle mole sauce with charro beans and corn on cob on the side. Mole is done at almost every Mexican and Latin restaurant in town and done poorly for the most part. It's often chalky from people using a mix or bitter from too much chocolate. Here the mole sauce has a complex, savory, spicy flavor from a combination of chilis and and a hint of chocolate.

The decor is modern Mexican but not over the top, cool but relaxed. The service is very accommodating, friendly, and eager to please. 

I also ordered a lunch combination plate of a barbacoa taquitos and a three cheese enchiladas which were delicious with fresh ingredients and tasty salsas even though I'm not a taquito fan. The complementary salas and chips had a variety of creative salsas. 
 
I had their house margarita with a spicy twist, the traditional spicy. It was tasty, actually spicy, strong and not overly sweet.j",TxYvDePA67VeFBwnh-wr8A,0,0,5,224G_CmeJW3Zs35cbLzbNw

5279090,2018-02-13,1,zN4f3aLeCuIhCTPRH0di-A,"Open for just six months at the former site of Rosemary's it seems Salud! Mexican Bistro and Tequileria has captured a following faster than many, the upscale twist on Mexican cuisine distinctive from what anyone else seems to be doing in Sin City and more-or-less comparable to the Cuisine offered at Candelas on the Bay on Coronado Island.

Toqued by Chef Israel Reyes and owned by a family of Restaurateurs, at least one of them present on-site and checking in with patrons on a regular basis during a visit on Friday, Salud promises ""Food worthy of a fine dining restaurant with a casual atmosphere"" and it is immediately upon entry that the later is confirmed, a Bar stocked with top-shelf Tequila lined by guests watching sports television while the dining room offers a more sedate atmosphere decorated in art made by the Chef and his staff.

Taking a modern approach to Mexican Food but still offering Tacos, Burritos and Guacamole, the former even part of an AYCE option along with Margaritas on Mondays, it was after confirming a reservation that seats were offered at a sturdy wooden four-top in the center of the room, the list of Food and Drink soon distributed by a waitress who proved efficient and pleasant throughout the evening.

Dividing the menu into several sections with prices lower than portions dictate, the sizable kitchen quick to send out complimentary Tortilla Strips flanked by three Salsas including a beautiful Guajillo version that eats like dipping Oil with a robust head of Garlic, it was after a moment's indecision that two Appetizers and three Entrees were selected, a seemingly manageable amount of Food that in reality could have fed at least two others.

Understanding that those seeking ""authentic"" or ""cheap"" Mexican may be turned off by something that at times feels ""fusion-y,"" blistering Queso Fundido studded with Corn like the Koreans nonetheless exemplary with up-front heat and lingering sweetness, it was also in a humongous pile of Carne Asada Fries for just $9 that first impressions of Reyes' cooking were formed, the hand-cut Potatoes crispy and capable of standing up to thick chunks of Beef served with white Cheese and smoky Colorado Sauce.

As usual doing plenty of research on the place before making a reservation, misspellings on the website and a Grub Hub that mirrors neither price nor scope of the offerings evidencing ownership not quite as on-the-ball as they suggest, it was only a few minutes after receiving Appetizers that a loud male server approached to inform the table that Entrees were ready, the first two plates barely half-finished and his suggestion that Food could ""be left under the warmers"" forcibly deemed acceptable as there was simply no room to bring them out.

Feeling rushed even though the Restaurant was less than 1/6 full, the rest of the Fundido and Fries shoveled onto share-plates, it was with plates piping-hot from lamps that the ""Owner's favorite"" stuffed-Chicken was cut into next, the Cheese not as thick or prevalent as on Salud's Facebook post from November but flavor and technique still great with juicy Bird complimented yet not overwhelmed by Chorizo and Cream Sauce.

Additionally ordering the $25 Duck Carnitas and $19 Mexican Gnocchi, both portions easily sharable but the former unfortunately a bit under flavored without the accompanying Chutney, it should be fairly obvious to anyone paying attention that the Pasta is not ""light"" despite being Vegetarian, three completely distinct flavors of velvety Dumplings highlighted by dark ones tinged in Guajillo Peppers, though all played well off a thick Sauce teaming with Mushrooms.

Packing up several Gnocchi plus a heap of Beans and Rice perfumed with Cilantro for home, easily enough for another diner despite everyone being quite full, it was after being presented a verbal list of sweets that two were decided upon, the Tres Leches Flan a good idea that is unfortunately compromised by bitter Citrus notes while the Churro Waffles fall short of those at CRAFTkitchen by being a bit greasy, though the Whipped Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream and Cajeta do a good job of covering up for it.

***1/2:  Giving credit where it is due, a unique concept these days difficult to find on-Strip let alone in the Suburbs, Salud! Mexican Bistro and Tequileria would be well served to slow down and focus on the details when volume is low instead of trying to lure patrons in with Bingo, AYCE and Comedy Night - as Sparrow & Wolf, Other Mama and Esther's Kitchen have shown great Food and service sells itself.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,3,E0-XINHrOZ7QkioYcb6ntg

The margarita on the rocks was perfect. I could taste all the flavors without a heavy sour taste, which some margaritas can have. 

I didn't think there would ever come a time when I would rave about chips, but when they're served with a flight of salsa, it's really easy to do. The salsas included green tomatillo, red and a dark oil salsa infused wonderfully with garlic. When you try this salsa, don't forget to scoop up the goodies at the bottom. 

I ordered the Quinoa and Mushroom Chili Relleno. Although this is a vegetarian dish, and I'm not vegetarian, it was just as savory and filling as a non-vegetarian dish. 
My boyfriend opted for the Pollo Sarandeado and couldn't say enough about it (all positive). 

I also had a side salad which was tossed with orange slices and mango which really helped to cool the bit of heat from the relleno. 

For dessert - churro waffles with sliced strawberries, whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream with crispy drizzled chocolate on top. There's only one word I can use to describe the dessert - Divine!

Your first hint of the goodness to come is the pre-meal chips and salsa that arrives with a flight of three different salsas. The red one that's oil, garlic and chili is excellent.  I had the Pollo Sarandead. It's chicken stuffed with chorizo on a bed of Spanish rice and an amazing sauce that starts out mild and gives a bit of a kick at the end.  Old family recipe and I can see why. I've never had anything like this in Vegas. Superb!

So basically I went here with my family for dinner last night and let me tell ya, totally worth every penny. 

For appetizers we had the guacamole which had pineapple and mangos in it which was unique but delicious. The queen fundido was top notch. The appetizers platter was also very tasty.

BUT THE PORK BELLY WAS DELICIOUS. My dad ordered it and I could smell it right when the server set it down in from of him. I don't remember what sauce the serve with the dish but oh my goodness it was phenomenal. Easily the best thing I've had in a while.

As for my dinner, I had 2 chicken and 1 lobster taco. Both were very good. I preferred the lobster tacos over the chicken tacos. It was served with Spanish Rice and maybe the best refried Beans I've ever had. My ONLY complaint was that my Spanish rice was slightly undercooked, but honestly i didn't care because everything else was amazing. 

The bartender made all of us drinks after we told her what we liked. My dad wanted something ""sweet"" so the bartender asked if he liked apples and he said yes. She made him this drink that tasted like my mother's homemade apple pie, it was incredible.

I wish I didn't live so far from this place because i would be a weekly visitor.

 For my first plate of tacos, I tried all 3 of the vegan option tacos which included the hibiscus taco, soy based taco and chipotle mushroom taco. My favorite was the soy based tacos, so good! They kinda had the same texture as ground beef but softer. I would highly recommend them. The all you can drink margaritas only include the traditional house margaritas. 

Pros: there's a bar area, great specials, vegan options, friendly staff, good service 

Cons: found out there is a time limit on the $22 special

I understand there are different styles of Mexican and Tex Mex foods but I don't think a higher end restaurant should have this much fat in their meat. I know the pork belly meat is fatty but I had chunks of just fat in there. The red salsa was good, the green one had no flavor, and the brown one was a mystery.
