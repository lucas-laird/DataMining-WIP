Arrived at 4:45 pm. No one in restaurant. Sat ourselves. A guy came by and gave us menus. Told us Crystal will be our server. Did not take our beverage order.

Waited 10 minutes all alone in dining room. Staff all laughing in kitchen having good time. Called the restaurant on our phone and let them know we were waiting. Waited 5 minutes nothing. Called again, finally the guy that seated us came to the table.

Some excuse about Crystal being busy with 30 people. Yet he peeked out of the kitchen 3 times. Something about he thought Crystal was handling us. He took our drink order and left.

After 5 minutes we left. So sad, we heard the food was good. Service counts guys and staff needs to step up and help each other. If someone is handling like 20 people, then YOU take care of the others....",RoJeErivU6c4tr_vba_cHw,0,0,1,4pMKHgYDubHwUzQadmcPfQ

An interesting twist to a ""Hole in the wall"" bar/ tavern.

The energy amongst the group here is very impressive, the age demographic group seem to mesh perfectly.

That being said their beer and drink selection is to be expected and doesn't disappoint my tastebuds in particular.  There is a fair amount of liquor options and their beer on tap is plentiful.  

Now to food... Cannot complain and actually give two thumbs up for a ""gourmet"" take on the menu.  From their shredded chicken nachos to the Grilled Alaskan salmon, the people in the kitchen know what they are doing and bring an excellence to their craft.  To imagine a ""Bar"" producing this quality of food is not possible and usually not expected but the cooks know what they are doing.

Don't know what more I can say honestly I highly recommend this location or the other for a night out from the regular bar scene.

FOOD: Talk about food worth your dollar. Everything on their menu is huge! I highly recommend the buffalo chicken wings. It is a great big portion and it tastes great. I like to get their house salad. It is only about $5, but it is sharing size. You can't go wrong with the sliders either, there are various types to chose from. The worst thing on their menu is the chicken pot pie....just don't order it or you'll regret it.

Finally round 2  is served. Meanwhile, each of us are down over $40 in these tight machines. 
The food comes and looks delicious.  Unfortunately there was no flavor in any of our pasta dishes. It was weird, cause it looked so good and I wanted it to at least taste ok, but NO FLAVOR!  
Round 3 was served. No one asked how the food was. Maybe they know what the answer would be.
Just to cut to the chase and finish this story, we had about 5 beers each and 3 shots. They comped 2 drinks!!! We were playing the whole damn time!!
The absolute worst was when my friends girlfriend came to pick us up, there was some fight in the parking lot and a guy pulled a gun on the other guy! All these police came and had the guys on the side of the road!

I love the decor. The light fixtures are unique, and everything is dark, but it still feels clean and cool. 

As for the food, it's all quality. I like the fried chicken sliders in particular. It's what I crave if I am craving bar food. 

The service is a little touch and go. The servers are quick to take your order, and the food does not take very long, but once you have your food, the servers really seem to not check in too often.

To be fair they do offer something for the non smoking crowd.

Of course, you have to walk through the smoke to get there - smoke so heavy that you need to change clothes to get rid of the smell. 

Don't get me wrong, I love a dive bar.  I lived at Dinos for about a month.  But Distill falls somewhere in the middle of a dive bar and a restaurant- and unfortunately on my visit they fell hard.

We found machines to gamble out right away. The bartender was friendly we ordered drinks and food. The problem is when the food came out. I got a western burger the bacon came out barley cooked it looked raw. My boyfriends food came out with a bug on it! It was dead laying on his plate in the middle of the food. It took us a couple minutes to flag down the bartender and we informed her of the meal. She grabbed the plate said eww and what do you want me to do? Grab you another one or just take it off. At this point we were so grossed out we just wanted to leave. We grabbed the bill and the food with the bug was still on there. I had to ask them to remove it. No one ever said sorry about it or a manager didn't even come talk to us. We will never return here again.,0m7CDy76OonQYgU0dl9wag,0,0,1,VXoJR2ZCO23erOIL9GkAtQ

At night it's lit up VERY well by the signs and the words on the building.  I could see it from the intersection of Silverado Ranch and Decatur easily.

My friend Olivia introduced me to Distill a few months ago. We started coming here after work to de-stress, eat and have a few drinks. There are two parts to this place: there's the actual bar, which takes up most of the space here. Large TVs for sports, tons of tables to sit at, the entrance is the main entrance at the front of the establishment. The second part is the actual sit-down, restaurant section. It's separate from the smokiness and loudness of the bar area. And much more intimate. I prefer to sit here. And the entrance is off to the side. 

Seating is by choice. We usually love to grab an open booth. Happy hour is from 3pm to 7pm! My roomie ordered the chicken lettuce wraps off the happy hour menu. And my goodness. I honestly think those were THE BEST lettuce chicken wraps I've had in Vegas. The chicken was shredded and so juicy. I couldn't take a pic because I was way too hungry, unfortunately. I ordered a side of sweet potato fries - which were nothing short of amazing - and a whiskey ginger ale off the happy hour menu for $3! My coworker ordered a BLT and she seemed very pleased with her food. But then again, I've seen her order multiple items here and she seemed to thoroughly enjoy the others as well.

Please order the chicken lettuce wraps, even if you don't make it in for happy hour. 

And ask your server for a loyalty card! It gives you points on all your future visits and access to their other bar properties around the Vegas area.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,1,1,4,4S2vAPK7ZznOk15H09_Kew

I've been here many times before and never had a problem and food and drinks always hit the spot.

We arrived around 5:35ish. It was a Sunday and the same playoff game was on every TV. We walked in and it was really loud, I'm going to assume it's because of the playoff game, because after it was over i could actually hear our waitress and talk to my party without yelling.  We came here as a group for bro beers. We grabbed the big chairs and put them in a circle with two tables in the middle for the apps. We started with chips and salsa and a personal pizza. The chips and salsa were a good choice nothing crazy special but it was perfect thing to keep me from ordering all the other delicious looking items. I was trying to be good. However, i tried the pizza and it was yummy. We order some HH drinks and started the night. I started with a vodka redbull. They have nice heavy glasses. We joked when it was close to 6 that our waitress was avoid us. She came back right at 6 and said she had a large party and she would add another drink for HH. NICE! After everyone showed we just chit chatting and looking around. They had some really funny signs. One of my favorite was the big D that pointed to the bathroom. hehe, I thought it was funny. After a few cranberry vodkas I had to use the bathroom, I walked in and thought I was in a club. The music is super loud in the bathroom. I just couldn't understand when it transformed into a club.

Distill is definitely going for that 30 something crowd with its old school video games and ""loungey"" vibe. This is enhanced with multiple large cozy chairs and soft couches lining one side of the bar. To quote my GF, ""it didn't feel like a sleazy Vegas bar"". This is true, the sleaze factor in here is low, but so is the excitement level...which isn't a bad thing. Sometimes you just wanna sit in a dimly lit location, drink a few craft cocktails, and just chill with friends. 

The decor is modern influenced with giant letters, canvas ""paintings"" and random light bulbs on the walls that you're starting to see everywhere. Distill is also very clean, which sadly can be a troublesome thing to find with most local bars in the Valley. The staff here are super attentive and make sure you've always have something in your hand; my glass was never empty for more than a minute. I was going to give this place a 3 star rating, but the food won me over and welcomed that coveted extra star. 

I'm not a big carb lover, but this place got me right in the feels; fried Mashed Potato Bites and Mini Soft Pretzel Bits, yowza! These might have had meth in them cause I just couldn't stop eating; then I found myself getting fired up when finished them. My food anger only subsided when the Seared Mahi and Carne Street Tacos were placed in front me. These were good, but I definitely have had better seared fish and street tacos. Trust me go with the Mashed Potato Bites you won't be disappointed!

If your not hungry try the ""Distiller's Delight"", a very good and refreshing drink for a whiskey based cocktail. It has Bulleit Whiskey, orange bitters, Sprite, and some other tasty items. Very good in my whiskey drinking book. Great especially after a long day in the Vegas heat. 

Distill is a great spot for a laid back weekday night cap or for the upcoming football season. They have copious amounts of TVs. Party on dudes!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,9,5,4,PTk3SnwfJiJcty81CogSJw

The specialty drinks all looked pretty good. As far as cost they were a little more expensive than I expected but not Strip prices by any means. We ordered the Distiller's Delight and the Mad Mule. Both were tasty. We also ordered the mashed potato bites and the crab bites. The crab bites were a little on the pricey side but they were tasty as well. The mashed potato bites were bomb. I could have eaten another order of those if I had been so full. Our server was attentive, refilled our water, asked if we needed anything, so no complaints there. We moved to the bar after we ate as space had opened up. I overheard someone complain about how smoky it was, but I completely disagree. There were maybe three or four people smoking in the whole place. Bartenders were very attentive and checked on us several times.

So for those looking for this local bar......South Decatur and W. Pyle Ave.  Whatever you do.....keep heading south on S. Decatur until you see Distill sign on your left.

Anyway, the service was really good.  Our waitress,Danielle was very attentive.  She made sure our glasses were full and our plates were cleared when needed.  As for the food, I really enjoyed the fried mashed potato and the grilled chicken with vegetables. The chicken was very flavorful!  The vegetable was cooked just right!    As my stress reliever drink from getting lost trying to find the bar......it was so soothing and comforting that I forgot about being stressed out!!  LOL ( I had the Cinnamon Apple Sour- Infused Orange Cinnamon Whiskey, Redd's Apple Ale and Sour.)

I enjoyed my dinner and service.  I would recommend this bar to my friends and family.  Looking forward to visiting again!",JFnNd9Ak1E0mHv5_IT5vSw,1,2,4,cU-IoxjsLgXSHJVNtQWURA

The potato medley that came with it was excellent. I asked for the creamy dijon sauce on the side. I am a health-conscious eater. One of the bartenders asked me how I liked it, and she said how much she loves the food there and gave me an extra tip. She said she orders the chicken ""dry"", to avoid the oils/butter they use when making it. She also recommended the egg white omelette. Breakfast is served all day, so that is awesome. 

I will definitely be getting the chicken dinner again and I will be trying an egg white omelette sometime.  Atmosphere is cool. Service was good. Beer selection is decent, but I'd prefer even more craft beers. Great addition to Southern Highlands, and I am looking forward to many visits here.",2t__HKqBFV1-2eIW2Nom9g,4,3,5,UXNjA7eOz-gxbDW_4-J5SA

They always provide delicious food using quality ingredients. Their staff is always polite and gives you that neighborhood vibe. Of all the gaming/local bars this is my go-to for the best food! My favorite thing to get is the Distill chicken sandwich it comes with bacon and avocado and I like to add jalapeños. Their bread is Always very fresh as well!

I have never felt so disrespected In a place of business in my life. I had a French martini with the previous bartender, who made it well (9:30pm John) my drink was perfect and it tasted  exactly like it's supposed to be made. I re ordered my drink at midnight as we were with a group of friends and the graveyard bartender delivered my drink tasting off. I  went over to the bar and asked the bartender what he made my drink with. He begin to explain what he thought was in the drink (wrong) instead of asking he was pissed off when I told him what was actually in the drink. He then prepared a new drink, as i waited at the bar. The new drink was prepared and delivered in front of me looking completely different and tasting different as well. When I asked the bartender If he thought the drink looked different than the previous prepared he ignored me... I proceeded to taste the drink and told him that the drink tasted differently as well. I told him I had no problem paying for both drinks but the first was almost undrinkable. He then swiftly grabbed the drink from me and immediately and abruptly poured it out in front of me... ignoring my concern. I sat back down with my large group of friends astonished by his disrespect and unprofessionalism. I told our waitress my concern who was very busy and a complete sweetheart. She notified our table that his name was Ryan and that she was very sorry on his behalf. How is ""Ryan"" about to work graveyard at a bar in Las Vegas and not know how to make a french martini.. Even so.. How do you allow yourself as a bartender to be offended when a customer patiently and politely tries to inform you on how to make a certain popular drink... And be rude and disrespectful to the customer. I am blown away by the lack of professionalism what a poorly run establishment if they allow rude bartenders to treat paying customer with disrespect during after hours... Is this how you train your employees? I will continue to notify everyone I know of this bar and the graveyard bartender and his lack of respect to customers.

You can dine in their dinning room which has booths and tables or dine in the bar area which also has the bar top, tables, and smaller tables with lounge/chase chairs. It's was incredibly loud in the bar area so we chose to eat in the dinning room so we could hear each other chat but then went into the bar area for drinks after dinner. 

Menu: MUST TRY THE MASHED POTATO BALLS. Omg they're unreal. it's basically a baked potato with chives and butter, mashed up, and fried into little balls served with a ranch dipping sauce and a chipotle sour cream dipping sauce. I we had them in both the dinning area and bar they were that good. The grilled cheese is served on big soft texas toast with a generous amount of fries. I ordered the western burger with the black bean patty which was tasty but i was a little disappointed the black bean patty wasn't made in house so the patty was kind of slim. And of course its served with a generous portion of fries. 

Drinks: Very reasonable priced drinks and they also have happy hour! i looked a few of their house wines and the pinot noir is their best quality. I ended up ordering that and was very pleased. They also have about every flavor vodka and flavored rums as well. The bar area is very relaxed with serves in the area in addition to the bar tenders. They even offered us water bottles on our way out the door while paying our check which i feel the gesture went a long way.  Top notch in service and genuine for sure. 

Bill: We split the bill, signed for my half of the bill and somehow i was still charged the full bill so i have to give them a call and get that fixed. So may just be sure you check your account before leaving the parking lot.",AeGPePY0FG7_Mu0CHck3GA,1,0,4,k53i2T-gGd1Cdpq8Y47l2g

beverages are of the essence, so even though I was heartbroken of great white being removed off the menu, the seasonal pumpkin shandy they now have is the BOMB!! it's sweet with hints of cinnamon and is so delicious. safe to say I've drank plenty of these already and you should too if this fits your flavor profile.

food was so much better this time. the gyro was on point. cooked to temperature so it wasn't too dry. my sister got the bread bowl and she enjoyed it. nice new addition on the menu and good choice of mash and stew to put inside. my friend got the steak and eggs plate and it looked great as well. it's promising that breakfast is enjoyable here at any hour.

After those two items .. nothing else is even worth mentioning. Mediocre soups lacking any kind of seasoning and a dry BLT that left my girlfriends face sadder than the amount of bacon on her sandwich. The worst part of all was the customer service. Our waitress was designated to the restaurant section away from the bar and struggled to manage the few tables that exist in this section. She managed to make us wait 15 minutes prior to greeting us or taking our drink down followed by an additional 15 minutes for delivery. This place was an embarrassing experience to say the least .

We all got different sliders with sweet potato fires. One of the fries was very dark and the others which looked freshly made were hot but loaded with salt. The sliders could have been made out of cardboard as we never tasted anything so dry. The chicken cordon blu sliders was a chicken tender topped with the driest ham ever. We could barely eat any of them and decided to take them home to the dog and see if he could choke them down. Our waitress disappeared after we got our food and we sat for at least 10 minutes before we asked another waitress for to-go boxes.  When the bill came it was wrong-our HH drinks were at full price, when she came back with a ""corrected"" bill it had some of the drinks corrected but added another at full price.

What happened within the last two months?  The food has always been delicious.  I eat here often.  
Now, the food is always overlooked.  Pancakes, always dry and burnt. Ordered pancakes at least five times in the past, and always so bad.  Last hamburger bun, burnt.  Meat so over cooked and dry.  Beef tenderloin skewers, so overcooked and dry, couldn't even bite into them. In the garbage they went.  Avocado eggrolls used to be big and nice presentation.  So yummy! Again, overlooked and smaller.  Fruit bowl was slimmy.
I hate writing this but come on, please have the kitchen step it up like it used to be!    What happened lately?

Also, bartenders, acknowledge a customer when they stand at the bar. I know you're busy, but at least say I'll be right with you.  And don't keep having a conversation with other customers talking about the weather, etc, when you have customers waiting.  Bad customer service!

On the bright side: the potato medley was good as well as the side Caesar salad. Stick with the traditional bar foods & skip the entrees.

Breakfast service is good. It is typically very slow so it's easy to get attentive service. At bars I typically get bacon and eggs. At Distill that also includes hash browns and toast. They are both fine. I believe the hash is probably frozen, but it is still tasty. There is no kids breakfast on kids menu so order one egg and bacon side a la cart for my 4 year old. Works out well for us as hash and toast is a lot of starch and we can split that easily enough. 

Coffee has always been good. I take it with two creams so have to remember to remind server to bring more cream with refill (they consistently bring 3 with first cup).

Server came back and I ordered an Redd's Apple with Fireball shot (25 oz) and my boyfriend ordered a beer. Another server or manager came over and checked on us. She was very friendly. We also ordered the medium chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. It was pretty good & yummy. I enjoyed my beer. It was recommended by a friend. The cinnamon from the fireball shot kind of made my Apple cider taste a ""little"" like Apple pie. 

Anyway, we received great service. They were very attentive and friendly. Also chatted with us. Plus the food came pretty quick. So that was good because I wanted to eat while I drank. 

The atmosphere was cool. Not smokey in there at all or anything & had nice decor and lighting. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves there.

5350707,2018-04-27,0,mwE5uNVkxCXvEuVa1KQ_3g,"Update: how convenient of this bartender to not give receipts to the individuals of our group after they've paid. Definitely need to file a dispute somewhere to make sure this doesn't become a common occurrence!

I would have rated this place a 4 stars if it wasn't for the end where our bill was incorrect and the bartenders' (Ryan G.) response was ""that's the way it is"" just because we are the last ones to leave. We leave a tab open for ourselves (group of 5 people) not for others to charge their shit onto our card and the bartender had no right allowing people to charge onto our card or even to add items that weren't paid for because he couldn't pay attention. Did he pocket cash and we ended up responsible for the two added items, very possible. That constitutes fraud and management should keep a closer eye on this guy. If it's not this guy, then this bar is taking advantage of large isolated groups that come in and adds on items that weren't ordered to increase profit. 

We ordered two sex on the beach, a pomagranite punch and a whiskey sour and ordered one water (not bottled) before shift change. Then at the end we ordered two tequila shots, somehow wings and an AMF drink were added to our tab when we decided to leave and close the tab. 

I tried ordering my tequila shots earlier in the night, but Ryan was too busy showing some customers what was on his cellphone instead so I left and returned to the counter a bit later for it and to get quarters for the pool table again. I tried to hand him his tip after getting my coins, but he just turned around and walked away after handing me quarters, so it ended up being placed under the rubber mat on the counter. Kind of explains why our tab ended up incorrect because of his negligence and lack of attention or he pocketed the cash that was paid from our other group and decided to use us since we paid with credit. Make sure to keep/ask for receipts if part of your group pays cash.

AGAIN BEWARE of leaving your tab open, for the reasons above which is why I was skeptical at leaving it open in the first place, but since it wasn't busy(Monday evening) I thought we would be ok. How terribly wrong I was. How is it fair to overcharge customers because you couldn't do your job properly?

Pool tables cost $1 each game (uses quarters only or maybe it just works better with coins). We came in a little before 11pm and unfortunately I didn't get the names of the original bartender or waitress. He was great, seem to have a sense of humor from our brief encounter and waitress was good, could have been better, she seemed like she didn't want to be there and didn't seem too happy when I told her my sister was still deciding what her first legal drink should be, it had only been a few minutes since we arrived. She warmed up a bit later and was very attentive, frequently coming back to check up on us and apologized for taking long in bringing my boyfriend the water he requested. Both were definitely better at providing service than Ryan did. 

Restrooms were clean, a plus. Large area to hang out and yes a bit smokey. You can smell it once you pass the first set of doors. I may or may not return to this establishment.. since our first experience here turned out like this. 

I was really hoping I could come back to this place and take advantage of their loyalty program versus going to PTs/Sierra Gold or all the choices in Downtown area.

Inside is a rectangle center bar that is pretty big in size, has alot of seating along the walls with booths and chairs. You seat yourself but the servers greet you very quickly. The drink selection is great and the menu has a big variety of food. The prices are pretty awesome, 4$-$20, for appetizers to full meals. They carry craft beers and the normal beers. Have great sounding cocktails. 

They have a good music selection and it's not too loud inside. Many televisions and casino games to be entertained by, they also have arcade games and 2 pool tables! They have a personal jukebox for the entire place where the customers play the music they want. Just download the app. Nice atmosphere with cool lighting. They even have a nonsmoking area. They got a cool lounge area with classy seating. The booths are very well made too. 

Highly recommend this bar to everyone, tourists and locals. Will definitely be coming back here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  for a great night out without breaking the wallet!",4wSQtIUTcogmff31YW265Q,3,1,5,KwL80DQ9qQD-Ys97FZq8eQ

Each time, I've grabbed a bite to eat and played video poker. On all of the previous visits, my drinks were comped including a visit earlier that day. When I came for dinner, I bought a friend. We ate dinner and when we got the check, I was charged for 1 of my 2 beers. I'm not upset that I was charged but I'm upset that I wasn't informed ahead of time that I was being charged. Inconsistency and lack of communication impacted the tip. I'm one that regularly tips above 20% but think I may have left $2-3 this visit. Great food but not sure I will continue to visit. I also went to Fireside and the food is just as good with a better beer selection which is free while playing.

5674363,2015-10-12,0,mwE5uNVkxCXvEuVa1KQ_3g,"I mean...it's mediocre food with hurried service, which Im coming to understand is pretty much a constant in this city.

The mashed potatoe balls which many have recommended were less about the potatoes and more about the cheese, jalapeño, and generic Italian'esk breading, which strangely enough tasted like the same breading used on the mozzarella triangles.

The fish and chips were coated with a heavy thick batter which was soggy and undercooked and the chips were bland tasteless soggy luke warm bag fries.  Awesome.

My martini arrived on the rocks in some kind of mixed drink / beer glass, which, considering they have like 6 different kinds of martinis on the menu, theyd at least know how to serve them.

Having sat down in the bar area, we at least anticipated being able to have a few drinks and hang out, its not as though there were no other tables open, and we did have a 80 dollar cheque open.  Needless to say, as soon as we opted to not have dessert, our bill immediately arrived and the card was wisked away and returned 60 seconds later, which was THEE fastest service of the night.  I guess we're more interested in turning tables than having people order a handfull of 12 dollar drinks.",NdOowgN5r4Q8VRtJXQoo3w,1,0,2,FWwsnWLRDb5vuvu6MpGPoA

Used to be an Italian place which was pretty bad, Distill certainly upped the ante with the whole reclaimed wood, Edison bulb feel that seems to be the go to look for a restaurant that wants to be ""different."" Layout is clean, good place to watch games with multitude of screens, pool tables, and an enclosed dining area. 

My food experience was a bit of a letdown though. Had the fish tacos with it being rubbery and over seasoned. My wife had probably the most disappointing fish and chips ever--soggy and greasy. I mean, it's fried guys, hard to mess up. We have a theory that it sat at the pass and just drowned in its own oil. The positive was service where they recognized our displeasure and comped us the meals. I'm going to give them a pass and will try them again, chalk it up to it being new. 

Anyway, they are trying. Next time I'll just sit at the bar, have drinks, and enjoy the view...rraaar.",-YLiMJ0xeWxqny9O9YKzoA,1,0,3,M5FvqM-Xwu8Vpm6B1HDgYQ

She recommended some turkey waffles. I have never heard of such a contraption. But the way she described the succulent Turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry, gravy, and syrup topped on a breakfast waffle had my mouth watering.  I didn't need a menu. I ordered before she was even done explaining what it was. This is Thanksgiving on a waffle the week before Thanksgiving. This was the best invention at the best bar in town.

Distill's changed that for me, though!  Minutes from where I live and a great atmosphere.  You've got a good-sized bar in the middle, some tables and lounge-type chairs along the outside walls and a couple of pool tables just outside of the separate dining room area.

I stopped by for their grand opening last week around midnight.  Missed the main crowd but it was still super busy.  Despite the volume of people I had no trouble getting up to the bar and being served in a timely manner.  Went back again today for lunch and tried the Western Bacon Burger with fries and washed it down with the Redd's Apple Ale they have on tap.  Delish!

I've only been waited on by two people so far, one of them my friend Kristina who's been serving me for close to a year now, but it seems like everybody on the staff is on top of their game, friendly and happy to work there.  That's a big plus because I've been to my share of bars in this town where there's drama going on with the employees and employers and that just kills the vibe for me.

Decent prices during football hrs so we were planning on being there at least 3 hrs. Until about maybe 30 mins into it when I was asked to move from a unique (1 of 2) machine at the bar so a woman (who had just won and cashed out a decent amount, I can assume at the other,) wanted to play where I was sitting. Not one for playing a a machine while my hands are dirty, due to the appetizer sampler that had arrive 5 mins prior, I was waiting to play until finished. Though my boyfriend next to me was playing his machine, and having already been asked if we were playing, I was asked to move to a different seat. Thoroughly upset I was too polite to say no and speak my mind. 

Felt it appropriate to add as well the women's restroom was in poor order. One of the two stalls was not only out of paper but had toilet seat covers covering the floor of the stalls. As accidents and people happen, I would have not paid attention to this if weren't for the fact I could hear myself even speak out loud due to the loud music. I don't often mind this being in my mid 20's but really?

As good as the food was (reason for the 2nd star), and as regular as we would have become living and working just down the road, we won't be returning. Which is saddening since Molly's closed and the food was good.

I like a neighborhood pub with video poker, decent food, and a chill ambiance - this isn't the place for that.  that jukebox is nightclub-loud!  A good chunk of people were hollering to communicate with one another in perhaps an attempt to ensure they were being understood but it just added to the cacophony of the place.  Some people might dig that and feel at home in a place where you can't hear yourself think but that's not my thing.  What really soured my experience were other rowdy patrons.  Not rowdy in the fun way but rowdy in the obnoxious way.  People who angrily scream f-bombs in some sort of misguided attempt for attention.  Looking 'round, customers and staff all were clearly annoyed but no one from the bar took the initiative to quell the brewing storm.
