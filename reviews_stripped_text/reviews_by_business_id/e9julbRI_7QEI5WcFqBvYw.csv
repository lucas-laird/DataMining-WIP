My boyfriend and I stopped in Vegas on our drive from Cali to Texas. We wanted a late night snack that was affordable and off the strip. We originally used our GPS system to track down a different restaurant but thankfully we were unable to locate that place and we came across Teriyaki Time!! It was their grand opening the day we showed up, which was wonderful. We got free mugs and extra sushi snacks considering it was opening day! What luck! We shared a bento box of chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki. Amazing! It had inari on the plate which is my favorite. I wish this place was close to me, I would go there numerous times in a week. Great proportions, wonderful service!! The girls working the front were very welcoming and helpful! I'll be back to Vegas one day, and when I do... Teriyaki Time is on my list of places to go! Mmmmm.",ysPVp4rQfRmAAc8QCiTlCg,1,0,5,6RGmMUCgO8pfS-fVLDg0oA

My bento combo wasn't great, but it wasn't awful, either.  It was just kind of meh-uninspired.  The offerings have a more Korean focus now.",V33eN85b4PvAsPIQRaaecg,0,0,2,ewvPTa4dejk5Gyb2UzWb2w

I haven't really tried any of the sushi but i'm sure its not extraordinary or anything. The main this this place has going for itself are its bento boxes, curries, ramens, and other dishes. The prices are great and if you have a UNLV ID you get a free drink with your order.",uDUjigr6CXJrOSh4Yz1lKw,0,0,4,9eJYFzuVMX74bFiE4CXr6Q
2237215,2009-11-04,0,e9julbRI_7QEI5WcFqBvYw,"Being a UNLV student, I am always looking for a quick bite to eat between classes. I first came to Cafe Mitz with a friend from class and thought that the salmon teriyaki bento I got was a little lack luster, but for the price you can't really complain too much. I came here a second time because I had a major craving for nabeyaki udon, which they had, but the $9 price tag deterred me from getting it. Instead I settled on the tempura udon. The broth was savory and sweet, which I like (I can see it being a little too sweet for some), the noodles were chewy and for $6.75, it was a pretty good meal. All in all, I will definitely come here again (possibly with the BF) - for the udon.",hyIGLrzgG3Bbe1ue73ZM_w,0,0,3,L-mSvnQxPl66g0D901666w
2585869,2007-02-27,0,e9julbRI_7QEI5WcFqBvYw,"It took one visit for Cafe Mitz to become a lunchtime staple in my office.  It's pretty straightforward:  Good Japanese food made quickly and for not a lot of dough.  Their bentos are perfect for lunch: an entree selection (such as chicken teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, beef sukiyaki, chicken katsu), edamame, salad, rice, California roll and (randomly) potato salad ranging from $5.00 to $6.50.  It's not the most delicious Japanese food you'll ever get, but for the cost you definitely are getting more than your money's worth.

They have a shaved ice machine which proves to be amazing in the summer, and they also offer a selection of Mochi as well as Boba tea.  They have a good selection of sushi and a decent vegetarian menu.  There's something here for everyone.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,0,4,MBwrm3XkTEwAGCJ--VRUZQ
3785719,2007-04-27,0,e9julbRI_7QEI5WcFqBvYw,"Boyfriend comes here all the time with his buddies after Japanese class, and it sucks having to hear all the fun I'm missing out on when I'm all the way across the country for school. But I went with him for the first time recently, and it was pretty darn good. I think the bento boxes are pretty much the way to go here. The other review has a good description of the varieties and the items included, although I think they've replaced chicken katsu with pork katsu and salmon teriyaki with fried fish. And chicken teriyaki is the only $5.00 bento.

All the food was pretty good, and it's definitely enough to fill you up. The California roll lacked a little though, and the random potato salad reminded me of Aloha Kitchen. Everything else wasn't too shabby. Boyfriend said he got the shrimp tempura bowl the last time he went. He said it was alright, but he'll be sticking with the bentos from now on. Save your shrimp tempura bowl cravings for Ichiza.

The Japanese girls are cute and nice, haha. The place itself doesn't have a very Japanese-like feel (more like Aloha Kitchen again), but it's clean with nice music. I think you'll find two groups of people here: UNLV kids or business folks, all out for a quick lunch.",tbXhMtRaWgscqbD6U_PV5A,5,2,4,eJDNEPi0ErSPrX85_L3O1Q
4287114,2008-11-30,0,e9julbRI_7QEI5WcFqBvYw,"Cafe Mitz gathers a strong Asian crowd and a strong college crowd. They're located across Maryland from UNLV, next to the laundromat. 

I think its Japanese-owned and -operated. There's always a genial middle-aged man working the counter when I go in. I don't know about back of the house. 

The menu is Japanese fast food kind of. They do bento boxes, sushi, and bowls (don). The prices are decent, for the amount of food you get. Like the Salmon Teriyaki bento ($7) I got last week had a small salmon chunk, a generous serving of rice, three small California roll pieces, edamame, seaweed salad, and a small garden salad. I also got a piping hot green tea for $1, which is refillable if you dine in. And I got a teriyaki kushi dango (skewered mochi) for $3. It was obviously outsourced and there were three skewers in the package. 

The location is pretty convenient. 

The ambiance is okay. Its like you're in a fast food restaurant. In Japan. Everything is clean and organized. 

I don't know, there's not much to say here. You get what you pay for. The fare isn't such that you need to go out of your way to check this place out. But its good between classes. There, I said it.",bEVFXdlFYzZzXsYY1DmXQg,1,1,2,P9ZbY1xkvhCx6dXQkDWjPQ

It was really close to school and the house that it was too hard to pass up.",KuGQIxKfGiHLNRuWLuPpXA,0,0,3,DUUAvGz0-81mNFCLOYE7Sg
