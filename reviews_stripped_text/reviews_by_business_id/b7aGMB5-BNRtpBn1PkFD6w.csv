Unfortunately, the quality of the wings was not on par. If I could recommend anything it is, do NOT have them toss it in the sauce. Ask for the sauce on the side or else you'll have greased soggy wings. It's far from appetizing.",nRTuJU6CEw97CzGwlKEb7w,2,0,2,VyT1Ohc9V9aLAu_QdK72uQ

The concoctions created here, are simply put, not so good.. order anything but the soggy pre-breaded frozen chicken wings, and hopefully your experience will better than mine. 

Best of luck guys",uzKQVbCQUxEyVc2Qlm6nMQ,2,0,2,xp2ASuvXey1yfoCbFpv6pQ

Talked with Owner who was very Friendly and we really like this place will be back.",eUWxFeV1rDdSqMk-9maqlw,0,0,5,NAfcIMKQuPr6Ze5ekEMc7w

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was that they had a little play area for kids in the corner. It was stocked with toys and books so your children could keep busy while waiting for food. I thought it was very thoughtful and we had our 2 year old play there while we waited.

The memu had pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and wings. We were told they're known for their wings, but we stuck with pastas. I ordered lasagna and my husband ordered fettuccine with chicken.

Our pastas came out and they looked so good! The portions were pretty big and they had little garlic toasts laid around the plates. I dug in right away and I was very pleasantly surprised. I was expecting something mediocre because I'm not usually a fan of Italian food, but the lasagna was so fresh and delicious, it just melts in your mouth. I don't even want to try anything else. My husband loved his fettuccini as well. It was very rich, so he didn't finish it, but it made for a yummy late night snack while we were watched our evening shows later on.

Highly recommended. We will be back to try their famous wings next!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,0,5,bAqfG1KRsuSE2x3A9NqmRA

Pizza craving was inevitable.  We saw this grand opening sign and I was interested.   We stopped at the register to read the menu and we went with a $24 large white pizza and an order of $7 mozzarella sticks.  I was definitely in love with the theme inside, brick laminate i think and bright lime green walls.  Large TV for everyone to watch had futbol! 

This pizza is made with love, I love the crust it's a thin crust cooked golden brown.  Lots of Garlic (our favorite), ingredients are fresh and I loved the taste.  Mozzarella sticks were cooked to perfection with a nice crunch, and delicious gooey mozzarella center.

I did not know they make their Alfredo sauce in house every day.  This location is moving in two weeks to Anthem. I'm so sad but I understand why they are moving when not everyone in Summerlin appreciates a great pizza.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,3,1,5,PthdKhz9Sq4hYc3xyMcrzA

The long time owners sold out and the new owners changed all the recipes. The pizza terrible. We gave the new people several chances but it was not worth it. Tried their pizza again last week and tasted like a frozen supermarket pizza. They claim they're known for their famous wings when they've only been there a couple of months. Don't waste your time, the food isn't good.",H7bJDtGzhdg1fsmBL4KZWg,1,0,1,XZE4FNmKSIjvCYfJyJk_Kg
5235056,2017-07-10,0,b7aGMB5-BNRtpBn1PkFD6w,"First time customers here. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs, fries and several different wings. The spaghetti was surprisingly good, although the meatballs were kind of meh. The garlic bread was perfect. The wing sauce was fantastic, we got alfredo, garlic parm, hot BBQ, jalapeño cheddar and pb&j. Alfredo, garlic parm and hot BBQ all get several thumbs up; jalapeño and pb&j are a little weird though. The only reason we aren't giving a full 5 stars is because the wings were very greasy. They were a bit difficult to handle because they kept falling apart, what with the wet breading and all. Overall though, we will definitely order from here again!",N78782Cts6fWwBoL2e6s1A,0,0,4,eA8WcKVLmmbIbFqRrECBzg
