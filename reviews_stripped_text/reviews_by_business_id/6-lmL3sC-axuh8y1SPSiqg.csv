This Roberto's is always my first stop, regardless if I am hungry or not, regardless if I don't feel like eating mexican food, and regardless of what time it is.

I usually get the two beef tacos combo, but I've had a lot of other items on their menu.  I love their bacon breakfast burritos.  It's not the best I've had, but it's pretty good. Overall, their food never disappoints.  It is always made fresh and the price of their food is reasonably priced.

The only complaint I have, and the only reason why I gave it a 4 star and not a 5, is because of their red salsa.  It used to be my favorite one, but when I came to visit in July of 2015, I noticed that their red salsa tasted very bland and it has some kind of ""plastic"" taste to it.  I thought, ""Okay, maybe they just made a bad batch..."" But as I came back in January and July of 2016 and 2017, I've noticed that it still has that same taste...it's not as good as it once was.

1376628,2017-11-07,0,6-lmL3sC-axuh8y1SPSiqg,"I love Roberto's and this store meets the high standard of every Roberto's I've ever visited. There are few fast food restaurants offering vegetarian items on their menu so I am a regular. I always buy the bean and cheese burrito (quite a deal at $3.45), but there is quite a mark-up for extras ($1.10 for pico de gallo and $.50 for lettuce-totally worth it!). For the amount and quality of food you receive, this is a great place to stop when you need to pick up a quick lunch. 

A great thing about Roberto's stores is that they also have a salsa bar. I'm not a fan of the salsas (too hot for this lily white girl), but I love the cucumbers, radishes, and carrots (okay, they're a little hot because they're mixed with whole jalape√±os). Walking out the door with my tasty burrito filled with vegetables in addition to baggies full of veggies from the salsa bar for less than $6 is incredible. 

Some things I don't like:
--I'm not particularly impressed with their tortilla chips. They are made fresh, but I don't like the flavor. 
--You do have to wait for your food, but it doesn't take long. Everything is made to order--no heat-lamps here!

Some things I like:
--I really like that like Roberto's doesn't skimp of the size of their burritos. As an athlete, I'm often famished after a long run (13.1+ miles) or ride (75+ miles). This is my go-to place when I need to quickly replenish calories.

Saw some chicken and decided to taste it. I wasn't gone let my $10 go down the drain.. what a mistake, I couldn't even chew the chicken because it was so hard and again it tasted very weird. So I spit that out and took it apart to see what was inside. The small amount of chicken in my second enchilada was definitely not cooked all the way. It made me think about the third one. So since it was in a separate container I thought it would be different. NOT AT ALL. It tasted the worst of the two. It had this taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth.

The patio furniture passing for tables and chairs is nothing to note and of course it's fast food so don't have expectations of fine dining.  Grab a plastic fork and a lot of napkins and dive in because it's a delicious endeavor.

You can find Roberto's sprinkled all over Las Vegas. 

It's a cheap alternative to sitting down at a Mexican restaurant. 

The best part about this location?  They have Machaca!  

Machaca is made in the Mexican state of Sonora, where they dry the shredded beef with chilies and garlic. It's cooked with eggs and it makes a perfect Brunch burrito. I also ordered some enchiladas but the cheese wasn't melted and they use an orange type of cheddar cheese not Monterey.

No drive-thru here. 

I think for the value and the other items I've tried that were very good, including the tacos and rice and beans, I would come back.  Menudo on Sat. and Sun.

Thank God for Mexican Food.

4014363,2013-06-20,3,6-lmL3sC-axuh8y1SPSiqg,"I've been to a bunch of Roberto's around town for some down-home, greasy somewhat authentic Mexican food.  This particular location is OK, but it is in a seedy little strip mall.  For those of you not in the know, it's in the same mall as the Big Lots.  It is hard to find, it's around one of the far corners of the mall, tucked in between a laundry cleaners and a PT's Pub.  Can be easy to miss.

Came here late one night after a Yelp event because we were hungry and had the urge for some tacos for some reason.  This Roberto's is probably the closest one to our place since they closed the one that used to be on N. Rainbow Blvd.  

The inside of this Roberto's is typical, same paint scheme (white), same menu, even the same layout as other Roberto's around town.  So it's nice and familiar.  Stayed with what we know should be good:

-3 Rolled tacos with shredded cheese and guacamole
-Carne asada burrito

Placed the order and proceeded to wait for our nibbles.  This is where the night almost takes a frightenly sickening turn.  Each Roberto's has their 'salsa bar', right?  So my wife sees this guy that placed his order before us...wait.  If you are the queasy type that gets sick easily you should skip reading the next paragraph and proceed on down.

SO...my wife sees this guy that placed his order before us at the salsa bar.  He's making a few containers of red and green salsa to go.  He's also filling up little plastic bags with radishes, and pickled carrots with jalapenos.  Here's where it gets kinda gross.  This guy, he arranges the pickled carrots with jalapenos in his plastic bag, tears the stem off of one of the jalapenos, licks his FINGERS (yes, licks), then proceeds to throw the jalpeno stem back into the tray of pickled carrots and jalapenos on the salsa bar!  FRIGGIN' GROSS!  Seriously, and this guy thinks no one was watching him during this heinous act.  Luckily my wife was kind enough not to go into full panic mode right away.  She waited till this doofus left with his food to let me know.  I immediately picked up the entire tray of pickled carrots and jalapenos and brought it straight up to the counter to tell Roberto's staff what happened.  Hello...anybody remember the 'Firefly' fiasco??  Anyway, the staff we apologetic and went straight to throwing away that tray and making an entire new batch of pickled carrots and jalapenos in a new tray.  Salmonella averted!  Geez guy, next time eat at home and play with your own carrot.  Or jalapeno.

You would think after what happened we would make a beeline to the door.  But no, we were too hungry so we waited.  Just didn't bother touching much of the salsa bar.  Glad we waited too.  Our fatty Mexican food was pretty much on point.  The rolled tacos were hot and crunchy, covered in a layer of bright orange cheddar cheese and a load of guacamole.  My carne asada burrito was nice and hot, with good cuts of steak, seasoned well and mixed with cheese.  No filler on this one.  Grease rules the coop here!

I do enjoy most of the menu at Roberto's, from the chicken tacos, to the tortas.  Of course, they also serve lengua and cabeza!  That's Mexican speak for tongue and head, yo!  Oh God, I really (really) want to insert a tongue-head joke so bad right now...but I'm gonna resist.  Eat at Roberto's!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,3,i34BT-OB7ibCO-SAyylzcA

This specific Roberto's, imo, has the biggest tacos. I've been to the one by UNLV and they do not put as much chicken as this one does. How can you go wrong with .99 tacos!?

The tacos are pretty greasy, so I just wrap them in a napkin.

I know what you're saying, 4 stars for Roberto's? YES. The customer service here is awesome, they're so nice and accommodating. Here they also have one of the better salsa bars, their red salsa is one of the best I've had out of 3 others Roberto's. They also have cucumbers! Not those crusty white ones, delicious green, crunchy ones! They also have green onions, and other stuff.
