We came here because of the Yelp reviews.  From outside it looked kind of iffy.  Inside, the place was empty at 8am.  What's wrong with this place?  Nothing!  Food was great!  Shwarma lean and tasty.  Best pancakes I've ever had in a restaurant!  Service was thoughtful and prompt.  Place was clean.  Prices were very good.

90339,2013-05-09,0,pCxzM4yOWyPQwZw11Y34Tw,"The food was excellent. I really enjoyed the Crunchy French Toast that I had. I felt that I couldn't give them only one start when the food was really good.

But my visit was very disappointing. We visited on the afternoon of 4/21/13. This was my last day of vacation and I wanted a late breakfast. Nearby yelp search showed that this and Mr. Mama's was nearby. The Daily Egg had a half a star lesser rating, but we decided to go here because they had a yelp check-in special for the Breakfast Special for $6.99.

When we showed them the check in special on my phone they simply stated ""You had to of printed it out."" We explained that that's a little difficult to do when your checking-in to a place on a mobile phone. The waitress explained that it wasn't her rule that it was the establishment's. Besides that, I wasn't impressed with the service as we hardly saw the waitress much and only ever got one refill on our drinks.

They should not be listing a check-in special if they aren't going to honor it. Two problems:
1. People checking-in on a mobile app are not going to be carrying around a printer.
2. There is no print option from the app. So I have to take a screenshot of the deal, send it to my PC and have it printed from there? You're average user isn't going to know how to do that.",XfqVFLekBZdkM_95hLkIdQ,4,1,2,wQ2fM-vfRYRqGKTZL0E6CQ
145560,2012-10-14,0,pCxzM4yOWyPQwZw11Y34Tw,"This review is for the customer service and management. I purchase a yelp deal ($10 for $15) and the manager or owner basically did everything possible to stop me from using the deal. We first arrived on a sunday morning, and after showing our yelp deal, the owner claimed the deal was only valid on weekdays. No where on the details of the deal does it state that the deal would only be applicable on weekdays, however, I still decided to give it a try. We asked the waitress what else we needed to know about the deal and she said as long as we came in on a weekday, we would be able to show the deal and use it. The second time we came back, the waitress claimed we couldn't use the deal because we didn't print out the offer......ok, no where on the deal does it state we have to print this offer, it says to show them the redemption code (as with all other yelp deals). We asked to speak to the manager and the waitress came back saying ""oh he's busy right now."" We asked if we could wait because we're from LA so we don't have every opportunity to come out here. She came back saying ""he says you cannot use the deal. There's nothing I can do about this..."" we turn around and clearly see the manager just standing in the kitchen not doing anything. We asked one more time if we could speak to him and she came back and said ""he's too busy to talk to you, you cannot use the deal..."" Honestly, he couldn't even come out and tell us himself? He had to pretend he was ""busy"" and send her saying the same thing each time. WORST customer service ever - it's not even about the deal, the fact is he couldn't event take 2 minutes of his time to come talk to a customer. If they really dont want you to use the deal - why offer one? Obviously, the deal is no longer on yelp. I will never return, and I highly advise you do the same as the food was nothing to rage about and customer service seems to be  non existent.",YMJYL8V29erzVeo-m3u6VQ,2,0,1,Ftxu4Vr6dzPYau8Jk-3gfg

Beef Schwarma: 3.5/5
I just got done watching The Avengers so for some reason I was craving schwarma as I never had one before. When I came home I found a new flyer on my door for the Daily Egg and noticed they had schwarma! Sweet!

The meal came with fries which were amazing. The schwarma is like a Mediterranean burrito, is the best way to describe it. Good amounts of meat and vegetables, warm bread and had a sauce on it. It was good, but didnt think it was Omg nom nom nom nom!

Chicken Tenders: 3/5
Its good, but not bad. Its made a little differently but its nothing to write home about.

Chicken and Waffles: 4/5
Has the chicken tenders as above, but the waffle is awesome! Homemade with powdered sugar on top.

Nutella Crepe: 5/5
Nutella, bananas, chocolate syrup and whip cream. It would be a crime to mess that up.

Sliders: 5/5
Sweet hawaiian rolls, made with a good sized portion of ground beef with their delicious fries! I LOVE their sliders!

Wait staff: 3/5 
This one older lady with an accent is great! Then you have this younger one where I tested her by putting my empty glass at the edge of the table, to where one touch it would fall off the side. And still nothing, she just stood there with a blank stare, ugh! The owner is nice enough, but can work on his people skills. 

Over all the place is great. The wait staff is rocky, but they're still new so i can give them a pass for now. Next time they better have their A game.",-zrwxAG8MEv5ZoouxM_PAQ,0,0,4,gFI3-7ZLrvLWVE9p5HQ_1Q

We were waited on by a somewhat older couple who might be the owners, and they were very friendly and attentive--we never had to worry about the coffee getting low. The food was delicious. This is one of those great places that does the basics right--pancakes, eggs, etc.--while ALSO having some unique things on the menu (like a fennel omlette) that you won't find elsewhere, and which taste super delicious. Plus, the servings were very generous, and we could pick from several really delicious sides to go with our eggs. I was very pleased with my meal--the eggs were perfectly cooked and the pancake was awesome; not at all heavy, and the perfect treat before our drive to, and short hike in, the Mojave. I like the basics for breakfast and am picky about them, and the food here was spot on. I was surprised when I went in and saw that it was not too crowded.

We walk in around 10:30 am on a sunday - the place is empty... That's not good.

GF orders a steak fajita omelet ( something like that ) interestingly she asks for no bell pepper, no onion and asks to add spinach and i believe mushroom.  She's told they have to add .75 cents for each item.  I advise the server that the items she's removing from the omelet  are .75 cents when ordered within the ""make your own""' omelet option so isn't fair not to charge for the add on's since she's subtracting two items..."" yeah ... I guess so ... ok .""  of course, later those two items will showed up on the bill.

 I went with the country fried steak and three eggs, hash browns and a pancake.  I've attached a pic of the menu ( so you can see the prices) and pics of the food.

after order and getting coffee and water. several other parties came in - sized from one person to 8 so business started picking up.  Unfortunately, this is not good since there is one cook, one server .  eventually one couple left after waiting several minutes to even be acknowledged.

The food did take some time to reach us, but i tell ya - the food will keep us coming back with the hope service will improve.

The gravy on the country fried steak had good flavor, chunks of bacon and sausage.  The hash browns were seasoned well and the pancake was decent sized and had a slight sweetness to my liking.  You'll notice the menu has several specialty pancakes ala babystack's so that might also garner another visit from me.

The omelet was decent - it was 4-egg sized - could've used some more cheese but overall, tasty stuff.

prior to ordering we were told that the meal is capped off with some free banana fritters - after asking the now frazzled server for the fritters several times over a 15 minute time span - we opted to leave ...sad

Food horrible and service wasn't bad because of attitudes or anything.  It was mostly lack of knowing what a craft of orange juice is.  Screwed up the order for 3 people.  They only had 4 other parties in the whole place.  This one is worth passing up.  Mr. Mamas is right down the street and taste better.

I only haven't given it 5 stars because I've only been there once, and want to try it again before I can give it an absolute thumbs way up.  For those of you who love egg white omelets, this place has a ""snow white"" omelet (vegetarian) that comes ""pancake"" style cooked hard, just the way I like it.  It comes with a bowl of fruit (watermelon, cantaloupe, apple, and pineapple), and hash browns which are awesome - cut really really think, with a nice crisp on top.  One thing I really loved about their eggs was that they didn't cook them in butter or drench them in oil, so if you're picky about overly buttered/oiled eggs, then you can rest easy at the daily egg.
 
My breakfast-mate ordered the chicken schwarma, which was pretty tasty.  It comes with four fluffy eggs (and yes, they are really fluffy), wrapped in a taco-like pita that is bursting at the seams, hash browns, and your choice of toast/english muffin.  The flavor of the schwarma wasn't out of this world, but it was pretty tasty as far as schwarma goes.

They also serve lunch, and have some pretty delicious looking pancakes on the menu, and a gyro omelet that I'm going to put on my to-eat list.  To summarize, this place knows how to cook a mean egg, and it's got some interesting mediterranean-ish options on the menu to keep it interesting.  The service was also unobtrusive but attentive - I think it's a husband and wife team who own it, and they're really nice but don't bug you too much when you're eating.

Many days when I get out of the gym all I want is a protein laden meal so I used my yelp app trying to find a place with Steak and Eggs. Sure I found a bunch but good grief sometimes I just want to spend $12 bucks. Going through several restaurants, I saw that this wasn't far so I figured I'd give it a shot and I'm glad I did.

I went into a very diver diner restaurant and took a booth on the wall. The server, who was very very friendly, took my order for coffee and water, while I looked through the menu even though I was pretty sure what I wanted. I ordered Steak, 3 eggs, Cottage Cheese, and some toast. She brought out the cottage cheese early so I could start eating. I must have had that ""I just lifted heavy stuff for 45 minutes and might eat my hand soon"" look on my face but I was super grateful! 

The steak and eggs came out pretty quickly. I have to say for a quick $12 steak I was very pleased. At places like this I might be apt to order steak sauce but really this was cooked a perfect rare and was darn tasty. The eggs were cooked perfectly and season just right. The server was prompt and kept the coffee coming. All in all I will walked out happy and will definitely be going back after another long gym sessions or if I just need something at work.

My only issue with the place was (1) The decor was HORRIBLE. Like bad bad bad. Not just divy, but unnecessary fake flowers and junk. (2) They had some idiotic women's daytime talk show on the tv and the sound turned way up. I know the staff gets bored but good grief I almost asked them to turn it off. I decided to be nice and let them have it.

I discovered it through Yelp and decided to give it a shot despite one particularly nasty review. Boy am I glad I did.

My experience:

The place does not jump out at you - it's just one of several businesses on its plaza, so it's a bit of a 'hidden gem'. We came in just half hour before closing time, and our waitress was friendly and courteous. Food came quickly, cooked perfectly to order - I have never had eggs cooked perfectly ""over-medium"" style until I came here. The highlight was the ham - cut thick, charred on the outer edge. You MUST try it. The rest (hash browns, pancakes, bacon) tasted great too. Upon leaving, we were happy customers who agreed that the negative reviews damn near robbed us of good eating.

Pros:

- Service was friendly.
- The food tastes good.
- Portions are a perfect size (slightly on the large side if anything)
- Very well priced menu considering quality of food.
- THE best ham I've ever had, hands down. Absolutely delicious.

Cons:

- Nothing I can think of.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon. I was expecting a nice fluffy egg, a couple strips of bacon, and a slice of cheese on a soft flaky croissant. Instead I received a burnt omelet on a flavorless piece of cardboard. I could barely eat this ridiculous excuse of a sandwich. However, it is a good thing my order came with 2 sides. 

I figured the hash browns had to be better than what I just tried to eat. WRONG! 
These hash browns were just as awful! Is there anyone in charge of quality control on the orders going out? Someone with any sense would have known to not serve these burnt  potatoes. 

At this point, i was getting pissed off. But wait, I still had a gigantic pancake to eat. Ahhhhhh, that's more like it. A nice sized fluffy pancake --second to only Du-par's in my book. Was that a hint of lemon zest? A dusting of powdered sugar? Too bad I wasted  most of my appetite on that slop earlier. 

This meal was a major disappointment for me as I really wanted to like this place. The only thing saving this place from 0 stars is the heavenly pancakes. Perhaps a name change to "" The Daily Pancake"" would be more appropriate.",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,4,2,2,4g79STJynZiMOo0fW5a_qg

1) There was one pesky fly that kept buzzing around us before and after the meal (strangely, it disappeared while the food was served us??).  Probably didn't help we were the only ones in the place for it to ""bug"".
2) Coworker ordered bacon ""extra crispy"".  He ate it, but I've not seen bacon that fatty and undercooked before.  IF I ever come back, certainly won't be ordering bacon here.

On our first visit my friend asked what was in the specific omelet, and the server grabbed the menu and read right off it??? My friend wanted to know specifically what one item in the omelet was. Then the server says you will like our omelets they are better than other places and so we asked what makes them better, and he said we season them different, so you guessed it, we asked what do they season them with... answer... ""Seasoning"". So based on a cheesecake picture on yelp I ordered the cheesecake. Bill comes out and no cheesecake. So I politely remind them they didn't get my cheesecake. He leaves to what I assume is, to get the cheesecake. Nope he goes and serves another table. So finally I have to get up and ask him for my cheesecake. I visibly see him take it out of the fridge and take the saranwrap of and wallah cheesecake. IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE YELP PHOTO.. it looks like a slice of cheesecake you buy at Albertsons. Second visit, same server.. Lord Help US!! We tell him we want separate checks. He acknowledges with no problem. Bill comes, no separate checks. So we ask the on-duty manager for separate checks and she asks us what we each had. After we tell her.. I kid you not, she goes around the table and I quote, she says to each of us "" Ok you owe 12 to 13 dollars, you owe 9 to 11 dollars"" WHEEEEAAAT???

The waitress apologized for the cheese mix up and got me two pieces of ""Swiss"" cheese which was the processed white cheese kind. Both of us ordered home fries that turned out to be the same kind you can buy in a bag from a grocery store and the only seasoning you can taste is from an unclean grill. The only thing we are all of was the toast. Even thought my sandwich cost $7.99 on the check it said $8.49. I wasn't in the mood to argue cause after eating a small portion of my meal I just wanted to get out and find a restroom.

We ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes, Belign Waffle combo, & I ordered an omelette but he must've misheard and put in hummus. The food was delicious!

After I paid in which the gentleman who delivered had already taken out my check when giving me change and I didn't know I paid him for the order plus tip. He could've left with a $30 tip but instead did the right thing and came back to knock on my door and tell me he had already taken it out and the money I gave him was way too much! Its very hard to find honest people in this world but the gentleman who also was the MANAGER who delivered my order is an outright honest & amazing person.

My boss wanted to order breakfast for the office recently, so I suggested we give them a try. We ordered 5 meals for takeout, so this review is not taking service into account at all... 

If I was basing my review on what my coworkers had, I'd go 4 stars. The two omelets and the classic three egg breakfast that three of my coworkers had were all good, they had no complaints.(And they know I Yelp everything we eat so if there is anything to complain about, they do, haha) Another coworker had the croissant breakfast sandwich which was good but he said he has had better for cheaper. 

If I was basing my review on only what I had, I'd go with a 2. I had the breakfast sliders and they were rather disappointing. You get 4 with your choice of ham, bacon or sausage. And no, you can not mix and match, which I wanted to. Lame. So I ended up getting sausage ones, and I wouldn't do that again.

The sliders are served on the yummy little Hawaiian rolls, but that's the only thing I can say good about them. All four buns were connected, it would have been nice if they were separated from each other, like sliders should be. The sausage was not patties like I had assumed but rather links cut into pieces and cooked with the eggs. The cheese was MIA. Basically I got an omelet between 4 connected buns. Not what I was hoping for and not easy to eat either, who expects to need a knife to eat sliders?! 

So... 4 stars based on coworkers.... 2 stars based on my own food. 3 star review it is!

We came on a Mon morning, so it was mostly empty. Sat down and ordered a couple waters and my gf got a coffee. 

Waters came, no coffee. Finally had to flag the waitress down to remind her, and when it came my gf swears she gave her a sneer when she dropped it off. I didn't see it, but the waitress did seem a little perturbed that we had to remind her. 

I ordered the Western omelet with light cheese. Historically, anytime I get an omelet with cheese on it they slather than damn thing. It also came with fresh fruit and a pancake. 

Anyway, my food came out, but my gf's didn't. Then her omelet came out. A few minutes later, her hash brown came out. Then later still, her fruit was brought to her. Uh, that sure is a weird way to serve your customers. Considering there were 5 or 6 other people in here, I'm not sure what was up with the staggered delivery. 

Omelet was good, but they cook them in butter, so they taste fatty and buttery. Too bad because otherwise it was a picture perfect omelet. Fat, pillowy, full of tasty stuff... it had everything I require. 

The side of pancake was one really big, thin pancake, coated in powdered sugar. Tasted pretty good; nothing too noteworthy.

I felt like the breakfast menu (and overall menu) had a ton of offerings: from traditional (Spinach Omelet) to more fun (EG: Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes), to healthy (eg: The Snow White Omelet). 

There were only about 4 other customers seated when we came in around 9:30 am; it gradually got a bit more busy after that, but no long wait. 

We got: The breakfast burrito (not on the menu, but on their specials board), order of fruit, and order of biscuits and gravy. The breakfast burrito was very fresh! It was not overly oily or heavily seasoned and they didn't attempt to overfill it with cheese and cheap products. The eggs inside were nice and fluffy! 

For $3.00, I would've liked a bit more fruit. The plate was a bit small - only a few bites. Although, I understand this is Vegas and nothing grows here =)

I love coffee as well, and it was nice that they had GIANT COFFEE MUGS! No hunting down the waitress for a refill.

Wanted to try something new, but Daily Egg was not at all what I had hoped. With a 4-star Yelp rating, you come to have a certain expectation. Feeling misled here. And it was the ""last morning in Vegas"" breakfast with my BFF. :-(

Service: she spent more time on her phone than paying attention to the two seated tables in the place. Would disappear for extended periods, leaving us looking at our empty coffee cups. Odd to notice there were no spoons at any of the table settings throughout the entire resto. Ok, I can stir my coffee with a knife, but goes to show... 

Snow White Omelet: watery, no flavor. Hash browns: no other flavor besides the food industry grease they use. Huge pancake (paid $1 extra for the lemon poppyseed) - tasted nothing of lemon, and in fact had no discernable flavor - it is a thin disc of gummy white flour nothingness. Tennis ball sized scoop of butter atop the flour frisbee: also *no flavor!* - not even the butter tasted like anything. Worst of all, the coffee. I had such a bad taste in my mouth by the time this breakfast was over, I reached for my Altoids tin first thing after getting in my car. Guessing their whole menu's stock comes from a commercial food industry supplier - easily-supplied mass packaged ""food product"" chosen over quality and flavor. Ick. I mean, this wasn't even greasy-spoon-diner ""good.""

My BFF had eggs and hash, he finished it, also hated the coffee, and took one bite of his pancake, and left it.

$30 for this lame breakfast, when we could have had a memorable breakfast at any of the other three stellar places mentioned above. This is one of those times when trying a new place didn't pan out.

They really made the decor a lot better than previous restaurant - the place used to be Dad's Grilled Cheese which had a 50s/60s feel, and now it is more pleasantly dressed up with curtains and bright colors. They also added a wall so you can't see the kitchen area. 

I am attaching a pic of my entree, the Snow White omelet - delicious! I love egg white omelets and was thrilled to see I didn't have to pay a buck extra for egg whites like some places. It came with thinly shredded hash browns which were really tasty and unique. I also got a side which I chose cottage cheese. 

My friend ordered an omelet which she said was very good also. (I think the western omelet)  I also ordered a to-go meal for my boyfriend, and he ordered corned beef hash and eggs. He said they were delicious. 

The only thing I think would make this a more popular choice for me is if they added champagne/mimosas/bloody marys to the menu, we were originally looking for champagne brunch and got tired of looking around. My girlfriends and I love getting a big group together for champagne brunch ... so that's what this place is lacking in my opinion. :-)

The only down side to our visit: we tried to split our bill so that we were paying with two separate credit cards. The waitress understood. Unfortunately... she brings out the credit card receipts and BOTH transactions were rung up on my credit card. She apologized and realized she forgot to clear my credit card info in the machine before swiping the second card. She didn't know how to credit my card and said the owner was the only one who could issue the credit. He just happened to leave not that long ago to make a delivery and she asked if we would mind waiting. Well... we waited for about 15-18 minutes and decided my friend, since she had no cash on her, would just give me the cash when we went to an ATM later. The waitress was very apologetic and I know she didn't do it on purpose, it's just a mistake. I wished we didn't wait as long as we did but we weren't sure how soon the owner would return. Besides, it was a Saturday afternoon and we were wasting valuable pool time!  

The food was excellent, and I will definitely go back. I hope to see mimosas or bloody mary drinks on the menu next time, though!!

Hubby checked out local breakfast place on yelp and came across Daily Egg. Inspite of some negative reviews we decided to give it a try, passed by it and saw their sign Grand Opening. The place is nicely decorated very clean and uncluttered looking. The servers were helpful and accomodating. Dany the cook and owner made sure that we were attended to and asked us how everything was. We came here everyday for breakfast/brunch for the 4 days we where in Vegas.
Food was made from scratch like the yummy hashbrowns. These were made fresh every order topped with fresh parsley. I tried the mediterranean breakfast twice ask Chef Dany or the servers to help you out with this one since there are many combinations to choose from.These were also good! We tried the buttermilk pancakes (oh so fluffy), Chef Dany's omelet (hubby's fav) and fennel omelet, mediterranean pie-meat (oven baked so not greasy), Daily Egg burger (love the fried egg with the burger). Chef Dany gave us the banana fritters as desert for free. Yummy and crunchy!for our last day we ordered to go Breakfast Sliders came in 4 buns super good and easy to eat while on the road.
The cafe is still new and staff and cook are still being trained but service and food cannot compare to your fast food chains and breakfas buffet. Try Daily Egg when you are craving for gourmet food and good service.

The answer... Because they know not what they do!
Both breakfasts were awkward to say the least. Dry toast requested by both of us was of course slathered with some form of icky butter flavor.
The coffee were horrible and should anyone wait a true 8 minutes for the waiter to get you creamer after 3 requests?
Our breakfasts were not terrible but they weren't enough to overcome the other irritations of this dive.

5274631,2013-04-07,0,pCxzM4yOWyPQwZw11Y34Tw,"Located in a strip Mall. Was suprised at the first appearance for the place. Nice and clean. Register is on the right when you enter next to one o those large Fridges you see at Coffee and Bakery places in the casinos filled with muffins and drinks. 

Sat down at a booth table with my husband and 2 kids. My husband aske what came with the Pineapple Upsode Down Cake Pancakes and she sai nothing. Mind you, for 3 pancakes it cost over $9. So I was thinking, I hope these pancakes speak for themselves and be worth the price. He ordered the Pancake Combo which came with Pancakes and a choice of 2 sides for $9.49 ""Hmm... Odd that the price was almost the same"" I asked for the Nutella and Banana Crepe. And this is what she said ""Let me check with the chef because I think I sold the last one"", then she comes back an says ""Yes we don't have any crepes, Indid sell the last one"" In my head I was thinking ""Last time I checked, a crepe is something that you make fresh per order"" I wasn't buying a bottle of water, it was a crepe. Ok so I asked for the Crunchy French Toast and my kids both wanted the silver dollar pancakes for $6 it would be $3 more if we wanted to add eggs or sausage, etc... Time passes by and it seems like it has been over 20min before receiving our food. My husband started getting hot as well as my 4 year old daughter. I realized it felt like no air was on. It was really stuffy in there. My husbands pancakes came out and were huge and looked like someone three a few maraschino cherries and canned pineapple chunks on top. Not a pleasant first impression. GE said it tasted *ok but nothing like his Fav dessert. He said definitly not worth over $9. My French toast actually tasted quite delicious. Be warned. The kids silver dollar pancakes are huge. Not at all the size of a silver dollar pancake. Our kids couldn't finish their food. One of those orders could have fed both of them. 

Pros:
-My Crispy French Toast was delicious 
-Our server seemed nice and came by to ask if we needed anything 
-Clean and Bright place 


-Cons:
-Food took a long time
-Out of Crepes. Umm... So make some. Or if you were out of batter, then say that not ""I sold the last crepe. No crepes are made ready"" 
-Consider making the silver dollar pancakes actually silver dollar size and lessening the price. Why do we have to pay extra for one egg and a slice of bacon for the kids? I mean $7 for pancakes and no sides for the kids? 
-Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was a flop :-/

-What would make it better:
-More variety to choose from the breakfast menu. Not everyone wants 3 pancakes with a side of sausage. Some may want one pancake, 2 eggs, and sausage. If I were to ask for this, it would have cost me so much. 

-The temperature was at least in the mid to high 80s. Please monitor your building temperature 

-Consider using real Pineapple juice in the pineapple pancake batter, have real slices of Pineapple to accompany the pancake instead of throwing chunk can pineapples on top of it. A Brown Sugar Whipped Butter would go delicious with this as well",SiKidCx57lIVwjjSygvRqg,2,1,3,Xp0Nek9D0Meow21VNe0Xxg
5322420,2013-12-20,0,pCxzM4yOWyPQwZw11Y34Tw,"Sunday afternoon with the family, my mom decided to introduce me to her favorite brunch place. I was stoked it was a mom and pop place.

The gentleman/owner recognized my mother and sat us in a booth. We ordered out beverages and hen he disappeared for a good solid 5 minutes, then another server came over and asked if we'd been helped. This place is tiny, so this was a bit bizarre. No big deal. Our drinks came shortly after and then we ordered.

My sister ordered the cornbeef hash and eggs and it was rather bland. She got a side of home fries, which didn't have onion or peppers or any real seasoning, they were cut potatoes fried in a pan. My mother had the meat lovers omelet which was nothing special. I ordered the crunchy French toast and it was delightful. My mother didn't her her biscuits and gravy that she had ordered and I had to remind them of my side of bacon. It took 2x me asking to get it.

All in all, the food was 2.5 stars worthy and, but the piss poor service dinged that right off. Although our waiter was friendly, he was inconsistent and we were the only patrons in the establishment.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,3,0,2,V9DbUcKuXngwL-_94HXNOA
5339830,2013-04-18,3,pCxzM4yOWyPQwZw11Y34Tw,"Probably one of the worst all-around experiences I've had in a while. Came here a few Sundays ago

Mistake #1
Our waitress either:
a) hates her job.
b) hates life in general.
c) Both.
I have no idea why this girl would be hired in the first place. The only words that were exchanged between her and uswere ""What are you having"" and ""Here"".  And to be honest, the way she was with her other customers, we were treated the best. She didn't crack a smile- she didn't even look at us. She just seemed as though she was miserable and did not want to be there.

Mistake #2
Out of pancakes by 9 am on a Saturday????!!!!!
Luckily, my husband must have ordered the very last one but we heard her tell the people sat behind us - ""We are out of pancakes"". There wasn't a ""I'm sorry we are out of pancakes"" or ""We don't have pancakes now but we will in 20 minutes"" -- it was just a cold, matter-of-fact, unapologetic ""We are out of pancakes"".  

Mistake #3
The food presentation. My Chicken Fried Steak was so-so, but I must mention that the picture posted here does not look  ANYTHING like what  was handed to me. My hubby ordered chicken and waffles.. when he got his order he got a plate of 2 chicken fingers & ranch placed next a plate of a waffle. The expectation of the order was Chicken and waffles but it seemed like it was 2 separate orders. Plus it took over 7 minutes (i counted) for her to put syrup on the table. And despite getting the last order of pancakes ---- they were cold.... cold enough that the huge glob of butter that they put on top didn't even melt at all.

So why two stars instead of 1? The food was okay. The expectations were high because of the reviews, but all in all, the food (other than the cold pancakes) was standard. I'd like to think that this breakfast place has potential to be better if they hire better servers and order more pancake mix.... but until then, I'm sticking to Mr. Mama's - it's just down the street from here.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,4,4,2,Nl8dtpmMBsytwozMM7Irew

There is humus and I ordered the beef shwarma, pretty good and comes with some outstanding fries.  At first it came out a bit under the temperature I prefer...I am Asian and was taught that piping hot food is the tastiest food.  

Moreover, back to the fries...if any of my friends remember Kenny's Diner back in Kalihi, Hawaii, these fries are that good...next closest thing is Zippy's fries...the breading does it.  

My lady got the pineapple upside down pancake...bad boy was monstrous!!!  There were levels upon levels of tasty pancake.

Ive been in Vegas for 2 weeks now (on vacation) and have gone to every popular breakfast spot from Mr mamas to the Egg and I; and both being very trendy spots the daily egg is super under rated but super good. Got the breakfast sliders and the country fried steak and eggs. The breakfast sliders were so good oh my goodness, the biscuit where so fresh and buttery. The country fried steak was nice and crispy with very flavorful gravy on top. The place is pretty easy to find, in a parking lot the atmosphere of the place is nothing special but you cant beat the prices under $10 for a full breakfast. Overall I like this place better than the egg and I just has better flavor and more breakfast choices and not over the top omelets. I will be back",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,2,0,4,_MEZpXET_xhYvHUbNnl5KA

A coworker and I went for lunch and I ordered the snowflake omelet with fruit and potatoes. Those potatoes were extremely delicious. They were well seasoned and I almost wanted to order just a side of those spuds. They were that good. My omelet was cooked well too. I'm funny about omelette's - they can be too thin, too fluffy, still runny, too dry, but ironically enough I felt like Goldilocks and it was just right.
