Their selection of fresh cut meats, etc, looked really good.  We plan to come by next time we feel like firing up the grill for some steaks.",HUUOllovCmPyzcgBwUM1vA,0,0,5,4GRXXRMXusy22-9krwIkCQ

I get so excited when I'm on this side of town because I know I'm close to this place. 
If you don't know already, on one side of the building is the deli, where you can order delicious meat (try the salmon jerky, it's to die for), and the other side is for ordering food. 
There are so many great choices on the menu. I personally love any of the bbq sandwiches. The pulled pork is so good. I recently tried their cheesesteak and fell even more in love with this place. 
If you get the chance to try their fries, DO SO! Same with any of their yummy sides, like potato salad or even their dessert potato salad, if they still serve it. 
Everything here is fresh, real and made with care, so be prepared for a wait. Your belly will thank you.",nMUHUGm2acP8_XBrl8-QwQ,0,0,5,ekkOCBQQFqApM3LlvJzuzg

Ordered a philly steak sandwich and a pastrami to go. There was a party of three guys who ordered before I arrived and the lady behind the counter was apologizing it was taking so long and thanking them for their patience. I should have known. It took more than 15 mins to get my sandwiches. Twice the lady said thanks for your patience. When I finally received my sandwiches, I got home and opened them up. By FAR The worst pastrami I have ever seen.  Thick cut. Fatty. Tons of grizzle. Inedible. Ended up sharing my wife's Philly which was Edible but not great. The display counter in the deli was fully empty. Assume there is not enough business to keep the case full. Based on my experience I see why.",325vaaxZ6ZxUIlPGQHLSeQ,1,0,1,5-FNnnvNn69nUpV1Tg115Q

A couple months ago they had a large menu with amazing food, They now have cut the menu down to a handful of items and the quality has gone down the drain.",Gx5r5je4MHw1WtKMw7mrNg,1,0,1,Z9fMfnvOFrGJMqcwYLW-vQ

And the menu was about half of what is was.  I will not be back for the restaurant.  The butcher has always been fantastic, it is a shame they screwed up the restaurant.",VX9dmwkeJlxKukgV3ggNeQ,1,0,1,vGq6nyqnoGU3fQ0BBW_MqQ
