HOWEVER: If for some reason my doctor told me that I had to immediately discontinue eating any sort of meat or meat products or else face dire consequences.....well I would probably kick the bucket within a month's time.  Except this is now no longer the case due to my discovery of Alternative Junkie!  Seriously, this is the only vegan food that I would not only eat with a bum's mouth, but I'm actually more than delighted to feed it to myself!  They have somehow cracked the code of turning rabbit feed into divine human food fit for the inner T-Rex in all of us!  So if you want to try something that's good for you, good for the environment, good for creatures lower on the food chain, AND good for your taste buds, I cannot recommend Alternative Junkie enough! TRY IT!",VUm7gN1hNbpk-YLPqWw3xg,0,0,5,d8nTQeHilgvlpLd13K_8aw

My favorites are the jackfruit crab cakes, the sliders, and the buffalo cauliflower taco salad. If you're looking for a healthy, plant-based meal prep company they will blow your mind!",2kBCLqbfl7w-CtAxzC9tpw,1,2,5,He9k8Q0Oysc-IMzH8SU2ug

My personal favorites are the quesadilla or the black bean burger! Not to mention how simple it is to order and pick up, including two locations in the valley! I 100% recommend Alternative Junkie for anyone that would like great tasting food at a reasonable price!",2XTAiJpjMqOoVm_kc2TTjw,1,0,5,kP5if3KE4h3qEbsu4f0TSw
