I'm pretty sure they changed their soup because of the reviews... But they shouldnt have. Both the egg drop and hot & sour soup, now have peas and carrots in them, I hate smushy veggies! Not only that, the soup tastes more like vegetable soup rather than Egg or Hot & Sour. They were both perfect before the change.

They earned 1 extra star for bending over backwards to create a tofu dish which was NOT on the menu.  They had every other protein on the menu except tofu and I love tofu.  :) they created a tofu and vegetable dish in a white garlic sauce for me.  It was pretty good.  :) I asked for fried and got steamed tofu but it was tofu so all good.  :) beggars can't be choosers u know?  But next time I'm gonna ask for fried tofu and see what happens.  :)

The other dish that I got was a beef and broccoli dish.  Odd thing was that it had onions and carrots in it as well.  If I had known I would have asked for no carrots as I hate cooked carrots but the flavor was decent and the meat was pretty tender.  

I would have given them 3 stars but they did make that tofu dish for me.  :) so 4 stars.  :)  I paid around $18 for 2 large entrees and 1 large fried rice.  Totally worth the money. There is no way I could even finish one entree. And the veggies were perfectly cooked.  They still had texture and definitely were not soggy which is what I love.  :)

I was thinking that these were the same owners as Liu's BUT it's not.

The menu is not that big when I think about most Chinese restaurants. Really for the most part has your normal or should say most common items see at every Chinese restaurants. On the back of the menu have the lunch specials. They have ten different ones choose from. I went with the Chicken Broccoli. The lunch specials come with your choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup. I went with the hot and sour soup. I thought was pretty tasty. The chicken and broccoli. I was definitely impressed with it! It decent size portion for lunch special. It nice and hearty. They give you bunch of vegetables besides broccoli, nice amount of chicken, and the KEY for me is the sauce. I had no expectations. It usually been hit or miss with me with Chinese lunch specials. The sauces can sometimes lack any kind of distinct flavor or any flavor period. Asian Fusion Kitchen they do it right. Light not heavy sauce. Just refreshing dish, perfect light hearty lunch, and the price is steal of deal (even with soda) under $10. Woot! Woot! I definitely plan on coming back try more of the lunch special list.

I've tried the kung pao shrimp, cashew chicken, orange chicken, and house special chicken. All items were tasty.

Competitors nearby: It's better than Rice & Noode. I don't think there are any other chinese type places nearby.

Flavor: 4 out of 5
Location (compared to competitors nearby): 5 out of 5
Price: 5 out of 5, you sure get your moneys worth

I'm giving this place 5 stars for lack of competitors nearby. You'd probably have to drive 15-20 minutes away to find anything better.",pA0Ke_97Qn8ROyZbEMtVWg,1,1,5,o65cEbJPZ3WT8J9Tyd3bDg

I almost always stop by and get their House Special Chicken. It's delicious, it's simple, it's absolutely amazing. Great presentation, and the flavors are rich and on point. I've also tried their crab rangoons, wonton soup, and fried rice is simple, yet not oily at all and delicious.

That's the best way to describe Asian Fusion Kitchen, it's simple and delicious. They don't go over the top, they don't complicate things, they know what works for them, and they do it well. The prices aren't expensive, an the portions are HUGE for what you pay.

Service, now that's something you don't get much of at traditional Asian restaurants. AFK steps it up here, everyone has always been super polite and very accommodating to our requests.

We are here on holiday and my honey wanted some spicy food. I suggested Chinese and got on yelp. The reviews are great but I don't think it does this place justice. 

No frills, clean and quiet. We came around 4:30pm before the dinner rush so there was no one here. We ordered the house chicken, salt and pepper pork chops, beef chow mein and the cream cheese wontons. 

The waitress, who is likely one of the owners was very proficient, very sweet and checked in with us the entire time. Making sure we were comfortable, had enough of everything. She brought pitchers of water and extra napkins without prompting. But the food was out of this world. 

Everything was brought out plate by plate, steaming hot and as fresh as it gets. The house chicken was mind blowing. The perfect amount of sweet with savory. The green onions were cooked in the sauce and really made the flavor pop. The cream cheese wontons were perfectly crispy and the filling was sweet and balanced. The scallions were a great touch to the cream cheese filling. The beef chow mein was incredible. The noodles were perfect. The chunks of beef were huge! The onions perfectly tender yet crisp. The salt and pepper pork chops however were like nothing we had ever had before. Big pieces of pork, coated in a tempura batter and fried perfectly. The topped with tons of salt and pepper along with sautéed jalapeños. They had a flavor that was like nothing we had tasted before.
