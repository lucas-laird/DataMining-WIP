Their stalls include pizza, tacos, dim sum, all types of noodles, burgers and sweets. We had udon, ramen, and dim sum. Udon doesn't have as much flavor as I would like it to. Ramen is good. Dim sum is good if they make it in front of you. The decor is very hipster.

It's streetfood that's trying hard to be more fancy but fails at it terribly. Just not worth it for the price they are selling their food for. 

On top of it, for the price they are charging, they should at least be able to afford actual plates not plastic plates and at least be able to buy some vegetables and some meat for their oh so hungry and super malnourished dishes. 

The sesame noodles, for around $12, had little sesame, little to nothing vegetables and eggs, and for a few bucks more... they can add little strips of chicken. And then... $7.95 for four shrimp dumplings which you can affordably get somewhere else for as low as $3.00. Same taste. Same size. A lot more cheaper.

Despite the prices, I decided to stay because I was really craving something different. I settled on a green tea juice without boba since my stomach cannot handle the little gooey stuff. I went up to order and my total came out to almost $10 even though it shouldn't even have been $8. After waiting for my cousin to order her drink, I went to tell the cashier that she messed up my order and all she said was ""sorry, but the drink is already being made."" I was furious for overpaying but when I saw my drink I was even angrier. I ordered a green tea JUICE without boba and I got a green tea SMOOTHIE with boba. I asked the cashier if I could have another drink since they messed up mine and she said I would have to pay for another one....no thanks.Talk about customer service. 
My matcha green tea smoothie was good, but I could not finish it because of the boba. My cousin got a mango smoothie and it was also good.

We came here on a Thursday afternoon, and it was super empty. There were maybe 5 or 6 different stations to get food. After looking at what each station had to offer, we decided on getting the roast duck and pork combo for 14.99 or 15.99 (I can't remember). 

DO NOT GET THE DUCK!

Instead of getting FRESH duck from the window.. We ended up getting MICROWAVED leftovers! The pork was microwaved, the duck was microwaved, even the vegetables that came with the dish was microwaved. Seriously?! We paid 15 dollars for some microwaved leftovers?? What's even worse is that they don't even try and hide the fact that they're giving you microwaved food. The microwave is on the front counter in plain sight.

Regardless, we still decided to give the food a try. The pork was edible. Not great but not the worst. My fiancé and I both tried one piece of duck.. It was pretty fatty, and had a lot of bones with barely any meat. We also noticed it had a foul smell to it.. Think it must have been really old duck.

Before I provide my experience, I will say, Cool concept! Definitely reminds me of when I was in China, Thailand and Philippines going to their night markets. The hotness in there definitely reminded me of my visits to Asia.  I wish it was a little cooler especially in the summer.  I enjoy the different Asian cuisines in one place. From what I could see the cuisines represented were Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese and Fuku burger (which is one of my favorite food trucks in town).  I thought overall there would be more options and the food quality in the window would look better even Panda Express food looks like the freshness and quality is better.

I would have to agree that buying food from different places were annoying.  What was more annoying is asking for something and the worker at the front had no idea what I was talking about.  I wanted the summer rolls in which the cashier gave me but then I said, where is the peanut sauce? He replied we don't have that. I said, um, its right there in your display and who would serve summer rolls without peanut sauce? He looked confused. I pointed to the display and he said, oh let me ask. You need to hire people that are knowledgeable in the cuisine.  We paid for our 2 choice plate. After we ordered from the ""Chinese"" panda express looking station, we went to the next station to order the bento looking set to include, BBQ pork and duck. I didn't think it was worth $16. And very true about the duck... I took a bite and it was bones! Yuck! It wasn't even good after I had to wait 15 minutes for my food.  The food took forever to come out! And there wasn't that many people in line. (Possible kitchen still learning the process?) We paid at another station for the plate.  Now off to fuku burger... To get our tamago burger and fries with crack sauce and side Mac salad.  This is the only place that knows what they are doing flawless service and good food. Now we want boba and beer and we are off to the next station. I have never waited for boba for 20 minutes.  Why did it take so long? They made orders for people behind me and forgot my boba. By the end I was annoyed. 

If I have to spend that much money on fast food, I would rather eat at Brooklyn Bowl or Chayo.  I spent just as much at those restaurants and the quality is better.  I may give them a couple more months to see if they fixed ""new restaurant opening flaws"".

We've also tried Fuku burger's Tamago burger and jazz fries, but we were completely disappointed. Every flavor that we could taste was very salty.

The flavors were just too simple and fell flat on my asian fusion radar. We would try another one of their burger creations in the future, but we are definitely wary.

The reason why I'm not hating too hard on FAME, is because they have an incredible location at the LINQ - right smack dab in the middle of thangs! Plus, their ""Boba Lounge"" is not half bad. Their honey green tea is super refreshing and actually had a robust, full bodied, deep tea flavor. They also added the right amount of honey to sweeten it nicely. The boba itself is white/clear and had pops of reddish pink color which is really cool to look at, I just wished they cooked it properly.

The set up of the place is pretty confusing. There was no greeter at the door. The place was pretty darn slow on a Saturday night (there was a TON of people at the Linq the night I went and the other restaurants were busy) so there shouldn't be an excuse for the workers to just stand there if a customer  walks in.

I noticed that the workers just socialized amongst themselves and some of them were seated on the bar stools talking to the other workers behind the counter. Not a single employee asked/acknowledge my presence when I walked around. I even stood right next to an employee, I made eye contact w/ him and he didn't even say anything to me.

It's a new restaurant in a new and popular mall on the strip; the service should be up to par because of all the competition.",5-t2GXKX1FqW7U9MV2eUWQ,8,3,1,BG4cBVihJYiDPoLp1v8RWQ

Wait a minute, this place isnt where the soundtrack came from!?!?
Actually, what FAME stands for is ""Food, Art, Music, and Entertainment"".

FOOD. This is where I think that its most important. You have a bunch of food stalls all clustered together. Fukuburger and Beard Papas are what is well known. There are others as well that serve dim sum, boba tea, and udon bowls. I cant seem to remember the names of these places. Anyway, bottom line is that everything is overpriced due to well, you're on the strip.

ART. When you go inside, the decor is definitely all about art. From benches that look like chairs to parts of the walls looking like window sills, they definitely try to keep you on your toes when it comes ""Abstract Art"". 

MUSIC. Yes they play an array of music inside by default. On some nights you will have DJ's with their large speakers spinning music.

ENTERTAINMENT. Yes the DJ playing loud music outside is part of the entertainment. Just the other night I witnessed some drummers doing their thing like we were on some Hawaiin Island. Come to find out they are actually employees because they are wearing shirts that say ""FAME"" all over them. Inside you have several flat screens that may or may not be showing the big game.

Overall, the food here is decent, which in my opinion is what would draw me here in the first place. It's just the pricing on some of these items is just a bit ridiculous. To me FAME would probably stand for ""Food And Mediocre Entertainment"".

2859898,2014-12-10,1,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"If it weren't for the horrible service, the food might have gotten 2 stars.  There was a hostess podium outside the restaurant where we waited for 5 minutes, then realized no one was going to host us.  So we walked inside and awkwardly waited for someone to seat us. Again, no one, so we had to stop a server who sat us down.  He said he'd be right with us and never came back to serve us.  A different server came by and took our drink orders, interrupting each order so he could shout it to the drink prep behind the bar.  Three of us ordered food.  One order came out 15 minutes before the other two and he was nearly done eating by the time the other 2 orders came out.  His was a main course by the way and the other two were main dishes and an order of steamed dumplings.  You'd think the steam dumplings would come out first, but whatever.  The food was just OK.  I got the ramen which wasn't the best I've ever had, but clearly something you could probably get from Trader Joe's and heat up at home.  At around $14 per main course, this place was NOT worth the money.  Finally, the poorly-mannered server gave us our bill and stood there and waited while I put down the tip.  I only put about 15% by the way because I was so displeased with the service.  He rudely opened the book to look at the tip in front of us and walked away.  Just tacky.  The service sucks and the food is overpriced. Save your money and go eat elsewhere at the Linq.",fFlY3v8WI79ksbwUEhQVuQ,2,1,1,U6e11dtR7OuACW94fyNSuw

I do not recommend this place to anyone.  They actually served this high priced food on paper plates and bowls with plastic forks.  TERRIBLE.

3318310,2014-06-16,8,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"I had high hopes for this place when I heard that it was opening. Asian food in the heart of Vegas's newest attraction, the Linq. That sounds like good news to me and good is what I was expecting. Unfortunately, my hopes were shot down soon after watching my friend order food. 

They have a boba place inside as well as a place where you can order dishes like a restaurant and a place where you can order food down a line like Panda Express. Looking at the prices that they had at the boba place, it was a little pricy and I can't expect it to have that much better quality than somewhere off the strip, and so I deem the price a little higher than normal. I understand rent must be expensive, but they won't be making money with higher prices. 

The area where you can order food had a variety of dishes from different Asian cuisines, but this again was a little expensive. I can't imagine it tasting any better than somewhere off the strip at a specific ethnic restaurant, and especially for the price they were charging, $11 for fried rice is a little much. They also have dim sum & dumplings and they list it out what kind they have on the window. The prices are a little expensive for how much they give you, which is the usual 4 at traditional dim sum places. $4.99+ for an order is not worth getting while you are there, you might as well go out somewhere else off the strip for dim sum. 

The area where you can pick out food like at Panda Express was also pricy and it didn't look very good, it seemed as though it was sitting out there for a while. When my friend ordered food from there, she got the duck and they microwaved it... You know, when you're at home at they're leftovers, it's ok to microwave food, but when you order food from outside of your own home, that ain't cool bro. That right there was just shocking for me that a place would even do that. So I don't think the food will look too appetizing unless it came fresh out of the kitchen, just make sure they don't microwave the food before they give it to you.

Last but not least, when my friend's food was finished, they brought the food out to where we were sitting. When the waitress (or whatever category you want to put them in) brought out her food, the tray didn't have utensils and the waitress said she forgot and asked her to get it herself. Umm... I think that's a little bit rude to say, and you have a job where you mostly stand right next to the front anyways, so I don't understand why she couldn't have just gotten them right after. 

I don't mind the higher prices of the places inside the Linq, I can at least understand that much, but when you have unappealing food, microwave food, and have bad service, that's a big nono there. Eat before you go to the Linq if you can.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,10,4,1,EpvluKsbc60RoeRg-loEYQ

3335984,2014-06-26,1,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"After reading most of the reviews, they're pretty accurate. I still haven't had their ramen or Asian food combinations, but I've had their FUKU Burger, Boba Lounge, and Beard Papa. 

Fukuburger is by far the most hyped up burger joint on the planet. I had their burgers when they first opened up, and they were pretty decent. But this place is a disaster. The two times I've been here, including today, they messed up on our order and forgot to give us food that we ordered until we asked them. How hard is it to look at what you need to make it and make it? I get it, people make mistakes, but twice in a row they mess up? I guess third strike and they're out. But on top of that, their Tamago is just a big mess. They just throw all the ingredients together and call it food. The fried onions are always stale now. I'm not paying 9 bucks for a messy burger. 

Boba Lounge. You're getting what you're paying for. 9 bucks for traditional fruit slush, real fruits, and honey infused boba in a big ass cup. And if for a big twist, add a shot for 5 more bucks. Service is cute too, haha. 

Beard Papa. I've read some of the reviews for this place, and I've actually had their eclair, and it was pretty good. Haven't had their original cream puff yet, so I'll have to try it. 

Overall. Two stars. Boba was good for the price you give em'. Fukuburger is overrated and they need to be more organized. Beard Papa ain't so bad. Pretty good.",6WGZXYuVrqVfpexaPyv5wQ,4,1,2,EhUXN_qOp1kGUCHhpw2jwA
3355687,2014-05-30,2,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"Went here tonight, I know it's only been open 1 day but there are some serious flaws in the concept.  The food was ok, nothing very good.  It is crazy expensive.  I know it's the strip but you are paying $6 for 4 tiny shumai.  Or $9 for a bowl with 1 cup of rice, 1/4 cup of beef and 2 strips of pickled ginger.  I got the BBQ duck and pork plate, $16.  The duck was bad, there was no meat on any of the bones and it was super fatty.  They did not render the fat out.  The pork was pretty good.  The pork bao was not very good, the bao was the frozen variety.  After asking for a beer and getting a crazy look from a girl at their bar, I asked if they were still open.  She shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know.  5 minutes later I saw another guy at the bar, I told him what happened.  He apologized and got me an Asahi draft for $9.19!

Ok despite the prices there are other issues.  The presentation is worse than Panda Express.  There is no thought put into how the food looks.  The whole set up is super confusing.  There are some signs and pricing but some booths have no signs or very minimal signs.  Plus you have to pay at every booth.  You want bao, wait in line and pay.  Ramen?  Wait in line and pay.  Beer.  Hope someone is there, wait and pay.  My friend ordered shumai and since it's so disorganized they gave it to someone else after her.  Very poor set up.  Ultimately for the price, you expect better food and service.

I know they opened yesterday and it's a beautiful space, but quite frankly this concept is not working in its current state.  I wish them the best but I won't be back.",WEXkES4QG-INtrBMtdFyBQ,11,4,1,9SOcvvPKvRGE5IPJLyNVfg
3409019,2014-09-24,1,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"I came here with my boyfriend for the first time because we were hungry & have heard plenty of good things about Fukuburger (and we were really hungry!). It's connected to F.A.M.E along with, I believe 7?, other restaurants and there was no one in line so we ordered our food and the girl asked us for a silly name for them to call out so I gave my silly name as Stargirl and my boyfriend's was Glue. So that was kind of cool, unique even. We ordered separately and sat at the table closest to their little section and waited. Patiently, might I add. But finally over 20 minutes passed and I still didn't get my food and i FAINTLY a heard Stargirl? Like she was unsure, so I went up and got my food. My boyfriend told me to eat because I'm a slow eater and by the time he gets his food, I would probably still be eating, so I ate. More people were in line to order and I heard their names being called out, well, I heard SOMETHING being called out, because their speaker where the cook calls the name out is completely muffled, and people were coming up to pick up their food. About 10 more minutes passed, I finished eating and I see food sitting at the register. I look at the girl and she hasn't said anything and my boyfriend says to just wait. I waited. Still, the food sat there, nothing was called out, so I came up to her and asked if that food was for the name Glue, because he ordered right after me and we've been waiting. She says I'm not sure, looks at the cook and asks twice if the food was for Glue, and he goes yeah, and she hands it to me. That's all. 

So overall, 1 star because my top bun of my burger was cold, I waited a long time for my food, he waited an extremely long time for his food, and the food was not worth the wait.

I came here for dessert, beard papa specifically got a little more. The cream puff from beard papa was $3.00 for the regular and like an extra $0.20-$0.30 for the other kinds, they have a special flavor of filling every day while they keep the original on stock every day. It's not exactly worth it to me. It didn't taste fresh at all, I'd rather go take a trip out to SoCal and get some there instead where it is fresh, outside of the drive there it costs slightly less too. That or I'll just wait until I go back to Japan where it's $1 a piece....=[ sorry but it's not all that's cracked up here, they bring shame to the name beard papa! 

Also got potted ice cream while we were here, because well why not? It's just vanilla ice cream with crushed oreo cookies on top, a gummy worm, and a mint leaf. For $6 it was pretty expensive because of the size but they need to offset the cost somehow right?

The pad Thai however was disappointing: lifeless chewy rice noodles which were bathed in a watery tamarind sauce, that almost made this dish resemble a soup.

 I feel kinda bad for giving this place such a low rating so I'll bump it up to 2 for decent service & interesting decor inside.  It makes the spot look really unique with how they arranged this place & the decor they used.  
It is a bit confusing because we all thought this was kind of like a food court concept but you actually get seated & there are servers that wait on you.  (FUKU Burger is a different story---you order upfront & seat yourselves)

+SUPER OVERPRICED---probably why it's always so empty inside.
+Small tea's are $5.99  & Small slushees are $6.99-- SERIOUSLY?!
+Pork shrimp wonton noodle soup was like nearly $18
+Noodle soup came out in a SMALL PLASTIC BOWL w/ plastic utensils

My friend said the noodle soup was okay.  It wasnt terrible but just knowing that his small sad bowl cost nearly $20 made it ""less good""

Honestly, if this place lowered their prices by ALOT and upgraded their plastic bowls & utentils for decent ones.. I'm sure they would be getting alot more customers.

4826172,2014-08-14,2,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"FAME seems to be having an identity crisis. It doesn't know what it wants to be. There are several counters that serve different types of food, but they call themselves an Asian place. I got a burrito. Don't get me wrong, the food was good; it was prepared right in front of me and it tasted very fresh. My girlfriend ordered dumplings and was made to wait long enough that I finished my burrito completely before she got her 6 dumplings. They did not give her dumpling sauce, instead they gave her a cup to put soy sauce in. Soy sauce does not go with dumplings.

When I went to place my order, a worker approached me and asked if I wanted to order from the Mexican counter. I said yes and she asked which type of meat I wanted. I said shredded beef. She then simply turned and told the woman behind the counter what I could have easily told her. It was all very odd. There was no real 'counter' for the server outside of the kitchen to stand at, she was just awkwardly standing next to me.

I asked for shredded beef and I'm pretty sure I got pulled pork. It still tasted very good, but the place made me kind of uncomfortable with how oddly/poorly(?) it was run.

FAME stands for ""Food, Art, Music, Entertainment."" It wants to be a food court, a single restaurant, and a club all at once. Oh yeah I forgot to mention, there was a DJ in the corner trying to get people to dance in the middle of what was essentially a food court. Very odd.

Unknown to the reservations department at Caesars' and inciting an ""I don't believe it is open yet"" when I contacted The Linq concierge suffice it to say that the ""Asian Nightmarket""-inspired F.A.M.E. quietly opened to the public on Friday and having stopped in to see the space then I returned the next day just after the doors opened at 11am to give it a taste, my seventy-minute visit curated by the expansive venue's two owners while a young, energetic staff buzzed around explaining the concept to curious customers. Not only new but decidedly nontraditional in its format with several stations encompassing stir-fry, soups, dim-sum, BBQ, Thai, Korean, Chinese Take-Out, and the first stationary Fukuburger it should be expected that F.A.M.E. is not yet firing on all cylinders - Beard Papa, boba, in-house pastry, and Fochun upstairs coming soon - but with full meals unlikely to top $15/pp and hours extending to 2am the concept is already poised to make waves as nearly everything I tasted was quite good. Beginning first with a few bites of chicken - a trio of karaage, 'bourban,' and orange - I was immediately impressed by the crunchy sapor of the first while the last was a touch too sweet and moving next through a basket of juicy shumai my attention turned to the 'truck,' my first Fukuburger moist and rich even before being gilded with a slightly overcooked egg and punchy accoutrements. Rarely impressed by potatoes but finding the crispy 'jazz' fries quite addicting as I chatted with the team about the upcoming ""art, music, and entertainment"" it was just prior to noon when my final plate arrived and with both duck and pork crispy yet supple beneath a touch of acid-sweet sauce I immediately swooned, a $12 plate worth the drive from Spring Mountain to The Strip as opposed to the other way around.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,4,kCh5hrwVpPZ4X0r78qTFkA

5386477,2014-06-20,3,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"This place needs some serious work. I admire the decor, it looks really hip and fresh, but food wise, this place is way too expensive, and honestly, poor quality. 

FAME seems like it's set up to be like a modern Asian Market Place with vendors lined up kind of like a lunch line. There was Fuku Burger at one end of the area, which my friends ended up eating at and said it was pricier than the food truck. I chose to go to the opposite side of the area, where they showcased duck and pork hanging (kind of like Sam Woo BBQ, if anyone is familiar with that restaurant). I ordered the duck and pork combo and switched the rice out for noodles (lo-mein possibly), which came out to $18. While I definitely thought this was way over-priced for something trying to mimic an Asian Market (where prices are cheap as hell, helloooo i.e. Philippines, Thailand, etc), I still gave it a fair shot.  

Still, the quality of food was garbage. I literally saw them microwave the duck. They didn't cut it from the duck hanging in the window, and when the server brought the food to my table, she forgot my utensils and said, ""Oh shoot, I forgot to give you utensils, can you just get them?"" Smh. Also, the manager scolded one of his workers in front of me for not giving someone a number card, really not professional. 

The food tasted old, not fresh, and the duck was soggy. The pork was reasonable, but definitely not $18 worth. The noodles were so-so, oily, and not very flavorful, and the side vegetables were oily and also not fresh. 

If this place wants to survive, they need to cut prices, work on quality of food, big time, and work on customer service. I was really disappointed with this place, be wary.",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,12,3,1,ynhRNTnxbNs1vvkFePN68g

I glanced up at the menu at the station right by the entrance and was intrigued when I saw the word ""slushee"" up there. I was too full to have any right then but made a mental note to possibly come back for it the next day.

By the way, there was a friendly worker near the entrance who gave us a quick explanation of the whole night market concept and encouraged us to check out all the different stations :)

We came back the next day for their slushee bobas. The menu was no longer up; instead, the DVD menu for a Bruce Lee movie was up :p I had to ask the guy at the station for the different flavors they had available. He had me at watermelon lol. It took him a few minutes to make it. I had a bit of sticker shock when he told me the price when he rang me up - over $9! It made my sister change her mind about getting her own and it was big enough for the two of us to share anyway. (But it's so nice and refreshing you might not want to share lol.)

5497944,2014-06-17,4,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"This review is for the FAME concept in general, not the individual food stall that I tried. When I first heard of the concept - Asian street market and lounge, I was pretty excited. I've been to Hawker Centers in Singapore and the international food courts of malls in Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Macau and the food there is always great with a fun, high energy environment. FAME was none of those things - it was just an over glorified, expensive lounge-y looking food court.  IMHO, they tried a little too hard on the decor - you really just needed some plastic folding tables, plastic chairs, fluorescent lighting and you'd have something more authentic. 

The layout is confusing - some stalls had menus while others didn't. Boba was $9. Need I continue? Stalls included a Beard Papa-boba/dessert place, a Fuku burger, noodle stall, and some dim sum/Chinese BBQ stall. We dropped by around noon on Saturday to check the place out and it was dead. Walked by the Fuku burger and it peaked our interest. I eventually did come back around 1:50 am and ate at Fuku Burger and really liked my meal (got the #5 with jazz fries - good drunk food at reasonable prices). The one downside of Fuku is that it closes at 2 a.m. - it really should be open until at least 3 or 4 a.m. for the club crowd to sober up at. 

Overall, they need to totally rethink the execution of this place - bring in some high profile brands from LA's SGV and let them set up shop here. Boba can be from Half and Half, desserts from Bambu - it can still be overpriced  b/c as of right now, it's the only option for that kind of stuff on the Strip. At this point,  I'd recommend driving over to Chinatown if you want to get your asian grub on.

5937027,2014-08-31,1,fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw,"I was excited to try this place out because it had fuku burger. I have always been a fan of the food truck but found it too taxing to try to figure out where the truck was parked, what time and if there was any food left. So basically FAME is the food court at linq. It's a collection of different vendors like beard papa - they have cream puffs and Boba drinks; pizza buddha; fuku burger and an Asian place with just a Chinese character for a name (see pic ) I have no clue why they call this food court ""FAME"", is it because they think the eateries here are Famous in their own right??? NOT! I gave it 2 stars coz the couple times we went there the place wasn't packed and had plenty of seats available. Also they had utensils and condiments that u could use on each table. The fountain drinks were also self serve. If not for these I would've given it a 1 star. 
Ok so 1.)""BEARD PAPA"" - they are supposedly famous for their cream puffs, I tried the chocolate one with vanilla cream, it was good but no wow factor especially at almost $4 a piece. It wasn't too sweet which is good. I tried their drinks as well, milk tea was good and mango slush was good, the drinks are huge and this is the only size it comes in avg at 10$/ drink. So ya it's going to be a pretty expensive snack! 
2.) FUKU BURGER - my all time faves have always been the tamago burger, the spicy burger, Naga dog and the togarashi fries. Please note that they cook their burgers medium so If u don't like seeing pink in your burgers u can specify how you want the meat cooked. I am sad to say though that although the food was still good the quality of food I had that day was below par. I had asked for my spicy burger to be medium well, it came out well done, also the fries were a bit on the overcooked side. On top of the food coming out about 20 mins. Later they had shorted us an order of the Katsu burger which he had forgotten to dispute since we were so hungry already and the kids were driving us nuts. So that was $10 for nothing. And yes... the burgers and hot dogs avg at around $10 per item and no fries or drink included, they have fountain drinks available at $10/drink coz it's in a so called ""souvenir cup"". So better get ur soda elsewhere. So bottom line... was not impressed anymore and got the craving out of my system. 
3.) ""No name chinese/thai/Japanese identity crisis - ish "" this is the place that has a Chinese character for a name. I think they did this on purpose so that it's harder to bad mouth and criticize them. So the first time we tried fried rice- which was the only delicious item we tried, but it wasn't even that amazing my standards, definitely not $12 amazing coz that's how much it was for one plate that is good for about 1 1/2 ppl maybe. Shrimp dumplings - the wrapper was too thick and it had 2 tiny pcs. Of shrimp in it which was falling apart when u bit into it. So when u eat it u have to eat it in one big bite and u get a mouth full of the wonton wrapper. Gyozas- wrapper also very thick and the ground pork filling was falling apart as well. UDON SOUP - soup base was a dark brown color and did not taste good at all... at least the noodles were edible. Ramen - the soup tasted fishy and too salty. BBQ pork platter - this one was the worst, it took them almost 1 hour to serve this and when I tried the BBQ pork I had to SPIT IT OUT! it was just nasty! It had a very weird after taste, I could not make myself swallow it in fear that I might regurgitate. The dishes here range from $10-$15 per serving. service was also very slow and they bring ur dishes out at different intervals. This place definitely needs to train the cooks better.

So overall impression of FAME... i love the ambience, but it is way over priced and it feels like all they are after is the consumers money without delivering good quality and service. It's like a Walmart pretending to be a Nordstrom and charging Nordstrom prices. Very slow service, so if you are in a hurry, good luck to you! Very disorganized, also no sink to wash your hands not even hand sanitizer stations. And they expect you to tip them too? Tsk tsk tsk... i am better off spending my money elsewhere where I can at least get my money's worth.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,2,1,2,3OxxwWfks6AL7rOHb6FrKQ
