My major issues with this place is that the waitress had a real attitude.  Not only that but she had a cell phone to her ear from the time we were seated to the time we left, over an hour.
Service was practically non existent.   Several times I had to get up and go to the counter for incidentals.  Getting a refill on coffee was like pulling teeth, we never did get a water refill.

I ate there twice while in Vegas.  The meatloaf dry with the consistency of a can of dog food.  For my Monday breakfast I ordered sausage and eggs, all bland.

To be fair, my friend really enjoyed his gumbo but completely turned off with the service.",RdH15d0SoQaoH8HJL9gXCg,1,0,2,mDL5bWiHiATVT57C1umuQg

As a local I was excited about the second location due to the Charleston one being so small and this one having a later closing time. Um, scrach that nonsense! It was shady enough in the daytime on a Sunday after church I don't even wanna know what Saturday night is like. First things you relise is parking sucks. Maybe 4 spots 1 of which is handicapped but you could park at the pay by the hour hotel right nextdoor. My party of 5 was shuffled to the far back past several empty tables after waiting 20 minutes already to a dirty table that can seat 8. I place my expense camera on far end of the table away from my party. We order, fried chicken both white and dark meat were order, paid extra, spliting sides of different things at the table, all 5 ordered waters. 15 minutes later our water shows up, dropping off on the side of the table that has my camera, purses and so on you know, not the people. But no straws but she'll be back. 10 minutes later dry mac n cheese, still no straws and a leg. I had the kids split it. They are hit and hungry. 3 larger groups have now come on and have been seated with their order taken. 
Oh look, our straw showed up, just 1, 4 more to go. We ask another waiter he said he'll be right back, he was swallowed by the black hole too. A thigh, and the saddest strip of chicken came out. We pointed and said whats that, is that supposed to be a breast the waitress said "" I don't know I don't eat meat"". Those 3 large groups  are finishing up their meals now, Im still a piece of dried out over cooked piece of chicken! I cant hardly wait to leave. No complimentary cornbread cakes like normal, no knowledge of your food, overcooked, under served, I question going back to the original on Charleston after this experience.

Unfortunately, it's not quite the same....

The parking is almost nonexistent... A few spots on the side of the restaurant. But it's a much larger dining room and the restroom was very clean.

We got there on a Sunday around 10:30am and decided to have breakfast.... We later decided that maybe we should have chosen the iHop across the street.

After placing our order, we realized that there was a group of about 12 people seated behind us. Each one of them got their food.... One plate at a time.... Our waitress came by after about 45 minutes to tell us that our food was ""next"".... 

After about 10 more minutes, the people at the next table joked with us that ""they must have had to kill a hog to get your breakfast""..... they had been served and were finished eating before we got any food

I ordered the omelet and pancakes.... Omelet came with a biscuit sliced in half. Half order of pancakes was two.... They were large with warm syrup. The pancakes were whole wheat, with a touch of cinnamon... If this had been described on the menu, I wouldn't have ordered them.... But they were nice and tasty, as was the omelet.

My husband ordered the Denver omelet with hash browns. Again, the omelet came with one sliced biscuit, so I gave him mine. The potatoes, priced at $2.50, came out on a saucer and looked to be about 2 ounces! 

One other thing.... Proofread your menu! There is no such thing as a ""salmon crochet""! LOL try ""croquette""....

We think the problem is that there needs to be more help in the kitchen.... Maybe they had only one cook who was cooking one order at a time.... We'll probably give this one more try but will probably drive out to the Charleston location if we see no improvement.",m5YQ5n9aDhx11dMLLGfZ7Q,1,0,3,6g5Ymiz9qR3ph3PRiIagLw

I had the sausage links, eggs, grits and biscuits. The sausage links were greasy and I couldn't finish them. Hey, probably my fault. I can't eat that stuff like I used too. The eggs were fine but either had too much butter or some cream or something in them. The biscuits were ""flat as a fritter"" and over cooked. It looked like they hadn't been proofed at all. 

The grits were flavorless and obviously had been sitting in a warm pan for a while. 

Staff was nice enough, but the place was dead on a Monday morning at 8:30 so they were just hanging out and BLASTING music. They did turn it down when asked.

I was meeting a group of ladies and told them just bring the one while I waited at the door.  After 5 minutes I asked again and another staff member informed me they just had one and I told them that was fine and that I was sitting with the group right by the door.  After another five minutes I decided to go to the bar and asked for someone to bring out the high chair which they again informed me of the one and they finally did.  After all that, the one chair was broken and so I had them take it back.  Then since I was joining the ladies already in progress I waited for a waitress.  After never getting one I went to the bar and ordered the food with the first person I could get, then when they brought it I had to go back to the bar and ask for a drink and silverware. After finishing I went back to the bar and asked for the bill.  We paid and left.

12:14 - hot cornbread pancakes. Great start.  I appreciate the fact they make it per customer.   Doesn't sit and dry out. 12:18.  She had to bring me more.  ;-)

12:19 lunch served.  

Sides great.  Chicken flavor is great. First piece of chicken is slightly overcooked but I pull most of the skin off anyway. Second piece is on target.  Could be the way they like to eat/prepare it.

Waitress forgot my Dr. Pepper but I didn't bring it up.  Two more tables had come in and I really didn't need it.

I'd come back.  May try other location to compare.

1062510,2017-09-11,0,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,Our first attempt to patronize this establishment was on Sunday evening. We were greeted outside by other patrons who told us that the wait was around two hours long. They also said the food was not worth the wait. They said their mother cooked better food. We went inside and saw how many people were sitting around like they were waiting to be seated and decided to go elsewhere. Monday afternoon we tried again. This time we walked in but wasn't sure where to go because no one greeted us at the door. We saw people sitting in chairs that looked like they were waiting to be seated so we asked them what we were supposed to be doing. They were actually there for job interviews so they didn't know. One man behind the bar did tell me that he would be with me after he waited a table. But he never came back. Someone who was dressed up and look like they may be a manager or owner asked me if I had been helped yet. I told her no and she quickly got someone. She thought I was there for a job interview at first. We were given menus and told we could sit anywhere we wanted. We ordered Chicken and Waffles and had muddy water drinks. I'll have to rate the chicken and waffles at three stars. The chicken was fried well but not seasoned any particular way. Didn't have any type of flavor that would make you remember it. The waffle sort of tasted like gingerbread. Not sure but it wasn't awesome. It was just okay. The waitress was nice. The establishment itself was a little grungy and could use a facelift. There was a friendly gentleman who seemed to be an owner or manager that kept going around to different tables speaking with people to see how they were doing or if they liked the food. Overall I'd say this place isn't really worth the time it takes to get your food. It offers average food and a medicore dining experience.,fQWwOv9dDvPmt0bWzk9Lcw,0,0,3,mZnl1VcqdEruaJgeFXWvjQ

1428464,2018-01-28,0,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"Well.. if you have watched the latest episodes of Sweetie Pie, and wondered what could have gone more wrong for Tim and Co. at his Houston venture, look no further, cause M&M is it. 

All you need is light and camera, and Gordon Ramsay himself, and this one can easily go down in one of the ""Kitchen Nightmare"" episode.  Or give Robert Irvine a call, and this will do quite well for ""Restaurant Impossible"". 

Sarcasm aside, let me get in the experience my wife and myself just endured today.  

After waking up early in Vegas (around 1230), my wife decided to check out M&M Soul Food Café since her friends from Seattle (Red Flag #1) told her this was a great joint for soul food.  We caught a Uber and arrived in the not so crowded restaurant, about 7 waiting (including us) and a dozen or so dining in.  So I thought to myself we shouldn't wait anytime with our dining experience. 

A sign near the host stand caught my eyes while we were waiting, indicating all fried food will take 25~40 min (Red Flag #2).  I have been in the industry for 20+ years, managing restaurant big and small, never have I seen a sign like this before. But when in Rome...

Ambiance (2 out of 5)

Typical diner set up.  This one doesn't bother me as much since most soul food place is defined by their food rather attractions. 

Speed of Service (1 out of 5)

I have to separate quality and speed here because the staff were actually friendly (forgetful, but friendly).  But the speed..

After the waitress, singular as we didn't see another one for another 1 and 1/2 hr later, took our drink and food order, it took another 30 minutes for the ""cornbread"" to arrive.  We then waited nearly 45 min, and watched 2 tables worth of customer (who sat after us) leaving, we got our food.  Despite telling the waitress to have my fried food for take out, so my wife and I can enjoy the non-fried food first, everything came at once.  

Quality of Food (1 to 2 out of 5)

I ordered a good sampling of the food, because I wanted to be fair to my judgment. 

Cornbread - I know these are actually mini pancake with corn bread mix, but they tasted delicious especially when you top them with some tabasco.  4/5.

Collard Green - I hate stems in my greens.  Stems checked.  I hate watery greens because they lessen the flavor.  Watery green checked. 1/5

Corns - This must be either canned or frozen, with little process.  I would've settled if they just simmer some frozen corn in butter.  But corn kernels simmered in hot water? No thanks. 1/5

Beef Short Rib - I had to settle for this since the waitress told me their Ox tail would take 1 hr to make (Red Flat #3).  The flavor would have been great if they didn't doused with BBQ sauce.  I think the rib was slow cooked with the greens.  Not a bad idea.  3/5 

Chitlins - This dish was actually pretty good.  I know some of your food critiques would complain about the smell and question whether they were treated properly.  But I grew up in a farm in China, so I am okay if my plate of chitlins smell a bit on the raw side.  It's tender and completely broken down, a bit more spice would be nice, but this is nice. 4/5

Fried Fish - 4 oz of cat fish fillets don't take 1 hr to make.  It doesn't matter if this is Chinese math or Deep south math.  There is nothing write home about these.. no bones? 2/5

Fried Chicken - Though I disagreed with my wife that her chicken was better than the restaurant we went to yesterday, I assured her that hers were better today.  But I was so hangry, I finished mine anyway.  Kind of wished I saved the $$$ for some KFC or Popeye when I get home. 1/5

Seafood Gumbo - Gumbo should not be snoddy (Red Flag #4).  Put some acid (tomato will do), and it will break down the chemical chains which make snoddy gumbo.  My wife had a horrible experience with it and I couldn't say much about it either.  Just because you have all the ingredients of a gumbo in a dish, does not make it a seafood gumbo 1/5. 

Price (1/5)

Just because you are near the strip, does not mean you can charge it.  Especially with the slow service, unattentative table touches, and sub par food.  The menu price does not justify the food, in a bad way. 

Overall (1/5)

I heard there is another M&M on Charleston Blvd, and the food there is better.  But I only had the experience at the one north of the strip.  I must regrettably say my experience was not a fond one.  If the ownership or manager thought I was overtly harsh or critical, I am more than willing to offer more insightful suggestions regarding operation or improvement.

( Charleston location ) So I went to the Charleston location today. I placed a call in order for a half portion of Short Ribs with Mac n cheese and collard greens for sides. Let's start with the actual call which I had to place 5x's before I got an answer. Not the most professional people answering the phone. I get there and a young lady named Tonisha help me. She was very pleasant, however the rest of the staff were quite loud and ghetto. It seems that they were having their own little party, which is probably why I had to call so many times before getting an answer. After all they didn't look that busy when I walked in. Now let's get to the food. It looked like something you would get I a school cafeteria. It was 1 rib, the sides were skimpy and not good at all.

1495749,2015-04-02,1,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"To jump straight to the point, it's okay. Three people were in my oarty and we ordered the full order of fried chicken, full order of catfish and half order of bbq chicken. 

I can (and will) only speak for the taste of the fried chicken. The fried chicken was well seasoned...but the meat itself seemed kind of dry. I had also ordered greens, mac & cheese & mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were alright, nothing extraordinary. Mac & cheese wasn't as cheesy as I prefer, but again..alright. The greens... I can cook greens so I'm pretty particular. I prefer mine spicy, these greens were not. They were quite smokey tasting. Some people prefer that. 

The pros about this joint is that there is a lot of space, the mason jar kool aid (drinks in general) are a nice touch and the hot water cornbread served with the meals was great! 

There is room for improvement in the service. The person acting as hostess that day (she was also serving, wish we had gotten sat in her section) was sweet and attentive. Our server stopped by to take our order and drop off our food and check. Our server never checked on us or our drinks... how our food tasted. I was thinking that maybe she was having a bad day, but I've served... leave your home problems at home. 
There is also room for improvement on the flavor and quality of some of the food... but that may vary by person. Those who did not grow up eating and/or cooking soul food may not know, ha, but it can be executed much better. 

Speaking about everything outside of the hostess... it just seemed like everyone didn't really care today. Perhaps just one of those days? I'm antsy to try the other location... I'm used to seeing a soul food joint on every other corner. I don't always feel like cooking, ha!

Don't come to Vegas for soul food... if you are really craving it, try this location if you want to - but don't expect anything to blow your mind.",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,5,1,2,hUGfgw0Qc8mnfMf0LHhcCQ

If you are going to put your restaurant on the Las Vegas strip your establishment should be up to par. Unfortunately this place doesn't hold up. When my friend and I arrived on a Saturday evening it was slow and we we seated quickly. Our server took a little too long to arrive to take drink orders. It was understandable as she was training someone. They were both very nice though.
     Things went downhill from there unfortunately. service from the kitchen was super slow. The hot water cornbread they brought it as we waited was terrible and over cooked. I ordered the half order pork chop dinner with cornbread dressing and greens. The pork chop was pretty good but on the small side. I've had better ant many other soul food restaurants and my mom's house. The sides however, were awful. The cornbread dressing was super wet and almost soupy. The greens had an extreme amount of black pepper. My friend ordered the full catfish meal with Mac and cheese, yams and string beans. It was a complete disaster. The fish was fried too hard, the Mac and cheese was dry and the string beans and yams were cold. I forced my meal down but my friend couldn't even finish her meal. It was taken off the bill, but when she asked to lodge a complaint to the manager, they refused to come out and talk to us. Very unprofessional. 
     I want to support black businesses, but when you treat your own people like this and serve less than mediocre food, it a shame that I have to write a review like this in order for you to do better.

Our waiter was very friendly and welcoming, though she made a mistake on our orders, she was quick to rectify them and offered us complimentary sides with dessert. Sometimes things happen that are beyond our control and we can only move forward and control our own actions, and our waiter handled hers very well. 

I would highly recommend this place. Just be sure to come earlier in the day for a more speedy service.",UiHrJCGXLu3cjH7nIhj0UQ,0,0,3,uGyY6pIghu0IaipScOFl1g

1917354,2016-07-26,0,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"Came here about 2 PM EST coming off my flight to Vegas before my hotel check-in. Was hungry and figured I get something to eat since I just arrived in town. Came in and sat at the counters area you see as you enter. The place had enough customers to be busy and by the way, everyone was moving around you'd think it was much busier. Was disappointed by the wait. Yep, they were busy, but it took longer than need be for someone to ask what I wanted and take my order. Thankfully ANGIE was great! Despite having her hands full, she took the time to check on me, take my order and give me some cornbread to start. I watched as all the servers hustled, the chef's coordinated things with them and one dude who acted like a manager but looked like he was a customer walked the kitchen area. About that: Bad Idea to have a wide open kitchen/serving area. Despite having a low wall to block the direct view of the kitchen, I could still see how everything operated in the kitchen. Back Of House....Keep that view away from the customers. It was no doubt part of the reason why a guy who came in ten minutes after I did leave when no one waited on him.

With all that, my food finally came and you know what? It was delicious! The battery on my phone drained otherwise I'd have taken a picture of my order of short ribs, red beans and rice, greens and fried okra. The beef was tender and leaving me wanting more. The greens? Well, I can eat just about any greens, but these were a bit dry but still great. The Red Beans and Rice were not New Orleans but still good and the fried okra wasn't how I usually have them, but that may change because I liked how they were done. I left full and happy except for that wait time and the architectural blunder of seeing the behind the scenes activity of the staff. The manager-looking guy should also consider dressing as professionally as his servers and chefs. But Angie was fantastic and the food was great. It's A-OK with me but I'd reconsider when I'd come in. I also chatted up a cutie customer who was coming for take out who told me of another location. I'd be curious to see how they operate. But, want a soul food fix in Vegas and willing to deal with these drawbacks? Then, by all means, check this place out!",2fx9sNxxTtsvb8KXaYJITQ,1,1,3,XqB60Xi-O7lu3XdpdIb9hA

2162257,2018-01-04,0,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"As a native of Louisiana who has also lived in Mississippi, I love me some good soul food. 

After several trips, I can safely say that M&M's food is legit and authentic; but I have reserved judgment in giving a rating in hopes that they could improve their service quality. Unfortunately, after last night's experience, I was convinced that it is not going to get any better any time soon. 

I arrived about 7 pm and the restaurant was not very busy with approximately 10 customers. I sat at the bar prepared to place a take-out order and **20** minutes later, the waitress finally took my order (fried pork chops, collard greens, mac & cheese, black-eyed peas). During that time, she asked the women sitting **next** to me three times what their order was (they were being very indecisive). 

**45** minutes after that, I finally received my order. In the meantime, I experienced the following:

-2 take out orders fulfilled. 
-The women next to me being hit on by the cook. And the cook giving them a free side order to try to win their favor.
-The waitress helping the women next to me as they didn't like their food and getting them replacements.
-The waitress asking me two additional times what my side items were
-The waitress not acknowledging me in any other way (e.g., I'm sorry about the wait, would you like some water, etc.) during that time.
-Did not receive the complimentary cornbread appetizer that is custom and other tables received.
-The kitchen running out of the side items I ordered.
-Lukewarm food when it finally arrived.
-No ""thank you"" or ""sorry"" when the bill came. 

I sat there patiently for this entire time. Maybe I should have spoken up but I didn't want to be disrespectful so perhaps that's on me.  And since I'm from the south, I get that we have a different pace of life there but service here has consistently been mediocre to poor with poor being more prevalent as of recent as I experienced last night.

This didn't happen to us, but there was clearly a party of similar size who have been waiting longer than us to get a table.  I mean, it sucks for them that they got seated after us, and I'm not complaining, but that's not cool.

It's also a complete waste of space.  At least, like 5-10-15 feet between tables.  There's no list by which you sign up and wait for a table.  It's just a woman who walks around like every 5-10 minutes and asks how long people have been waiting, totally inefficient.

Got seated, and waiting to order?  Like 10-15 minutes.  Waitress apologized, but she probably didn't care.  It sounded like she was used to apologizing and was just doing it out of habit.

The bacon was crisp, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the home fries were flavorful. My companion had chicken and waffles. I must admit, I don't normally like the combination of chicken and waffles, but the chicken and waffles came with chicken wings and buttery waffles. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and very crisp. The combination  of sweet and salty were divine. This is definitely a place that I will return to when I return to Vegas.

Now, I can get this southern style comfort food quite often if I choose to. I don't know how healthy it will be for me, but I will enjoy it!

I am a big fan of the catfish, and the fried chicken. The meatloaf didn't impress me, but the gravy on top was great. 
The greens, the mac & cheese, and the rice and gravy are personal favorite sides. And if you like mustard, try the potato salad as it has a mustard-y flavor that is undeniable. 

This location is pretty big. You could pull off a birthday dinner or special event easy. The service is great, very friendly and hospitable. They make me feel welcome every time. 

Don't let the surrounding area throw you off. It is not the best neighborhood, but there are way worse areas in Vegas.

As a Black southerner I love the food. But sometimes the service is so bad that it makes me consider never going again and it's a 5 min walk from my condo. 

My favorite menu item is the pork chops. They're ALWAYS good.  The fried chicken is great too. 

My least favorite menu item is the shrimp and grits which tastes good but has terrible presentation. It just looks like soup on top of grits. In fairness to the restaurant I had it when they first added it to the menu but I haven't had it since because it just looked so gross. 

The other thing that I don't like is the noise level. The building has awful acoustics so no matter what's going on it sounds super loud. Even when there's no music.

I'd like to start by saying that I'd heard so many wonderful reviews on M & M Soul Food Cafe and my expectations were quite high. I got to the restaurant with my family, 5 other individuals, at 3:30 PM and stood waiting to be greeting by a host. After several minutes of waiting, the host, who also happens to be the manager, came to greet us. She informed us that there was a wait of 25 minutes. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we approached the manager and asked for an update on the table. She informed us that we could not be seated because there was a shortage of fried chicken and there was another table who had not been served their food yet. Fast forward 1 hour. We are irritated that we still don't have food. The manager came over and started to have a friendly conversation in which we informed her that serval parties have left because of the long wait and bad service. Verbatim, she replied ""we don't care! Our food is good and we only want to serve customers who understand that it's going be a long wait"" 

Fast forward another 25 mins.. still no food! The server came over and told us our food was ""up next"". My cousin asked what ""up next"" meant and then all hell broke loose. The server replied that she didn't know what it meant but that she saw our ticket up next at the counter. My cousin asked if the server could go and ask the manager how long ""up next"" was. The server replied ""no I already asked my manager 3 times and she just told me to get the hell out of her face"" Wow. My cousin said, you do realize we have been waiting for 2 hours and the server replied ""what do you want me to do about it""

The pork chitterlings are also very very good for those who eat them. If you don't eat them but wanted to try them, this would be the place to do it.
  The gravy they make is also top notch.  I sampled the collard greens, okra, red beans and rice and yams, all were very good.  A little corn bread pancake comes out with every meal.  The portions come in full and half sizes, the full sizes can probably be shared so you leave room for dessert. 
  The only negative part of the experience would be the climate in the restaurant during the summer months can be a little warm for some but that doesn't take away from a great soul food restaurant that is on the strip.",YvAeTU7CnzpDHurVYjX9Xw,2,1,4,9p-F8d8-zIC-xmvNBiyIlw

3167821,2015-01-19,0,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"Located on Las Vegas Boulevard, just south of Sahara, this is the second location for M&M in Vegas. If you have a hard time finding it, look for the Holiday House Motel on the East side of the road. They are in the same parking lot, which features excellent views of the Aztec Inn (which I hear has a great buffet by the way) & an Ihop...ok, kidding about the views. But this new location is definitely much larger then the first, with quite a bit more seating and a lot more of an open feeling. Everything else remains just about the same, including the styling, menu, etc.

While this was my first visit to this new location, I've been to the original a couple times. I've tried quite a few different things at the other that I wasn't happy with, but I'll save that for another review of it. At this location I ordered something I've never gotten before, Smothered Pork Chops. For $14.99 you get two pork chops and 3 sides. The pork chops themselves were on the smaller side, pretty tough and also dry. Since they were smothered, it wasn't too bad eating them, but the texture of the gravy was a bit weird and it was way too salty. Besides helping the meat be more edible, it didn't really do anything for the plate. For my 3 sides, I chose greens, cornbread dressing and fried okra. It could just be new opening issues, but besides the greens, all the sides were lacking. The dressing was extremely grainy and also covered in the overly salted gravy. Okra was basically flavorless and seemed barely fried making them too greasy. Overall, the sides just weren't what I'm used to getting from the other location.

Unfortunately, the same could be said for the service. Our waitress was friendly for the most part, but I felt a bit rushed and they were having strange issues with getting drinks. When we first sat down, they completely skipped me when taking drink orders and then brought out the wrong drink to a couple people in our party. When it came time for refills, they had almost no clue what anyone was drinking and had to come back more then once to ask. They were also bringing out warm tea without refilling ice, or even just bringing out extra glasses of ice. Some of this could have partially been the fault of the busser, who looked like he was on his first day, but with only 1 other table sat during most of our meal, it was pretty frustrating. We got checked on a couple times, but again, the service just wasn't like what we get at the original location.

There were a few things however that matched what we're used too. Maybe most importantly, but it was the cornbread pancakes and fried chicken. Those little fluffy cakes brought out before your meal are absolutely delicious and if I could, I'd probably order like a half stack of those things by themselves. They also seem to be executing the fried chicken well. I only had a small bite, but I had no complaints. It had nice crispy, salty skin and was cooked just right. Very juicy and not a hint of dryness. There's definitely a reason they're known for that chicken.

Now, when the employees at the Charleston location told us about this new one opening a couple months ago, they told us it was going to be open 24 hours. It looks like those plans changed, and they're only going to be open 24 hours during some portions of the summer. I guess at this time, they are thinking only weekends in the summer time. All other times they'll be open from 7am - 9pm. Breakfast is served up until either 10am or 11am, depending on the day of the week.

Really, I'm still torn on M&M. With as many things as I've had at the other location that I didn't like, I can't say for certain that I'd give that one any more than 3 stars either. But with this one having both service and food that just doesn't compare to the original, I'd say it's a solid 2.5 that I'm rounding up to a 3 since they're new. We may be back if we were in the area, but I'd much rather visit the original location for the time being.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,5,2,3,JC0NLbZYDWmQKvJ31o4t6Q
3176672,2016-12-06,4,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"Really dig this place. I may go back there for breakfast on my last morning in town! Looking through reviews, it's a really mixed bag. Seems folks have issues with a person, a wait, go on a bad day and so they give it one star. I call B.S. This place is a solid 4 as far as I""m concerned.

Left the hotel in search of breakfast my first morning. Walked by this place but kept on walking because I had a destination mind (thanks Yelp!). Somehow I couldnt locate it. I managed to find the hotel it sits in but still once inside got turned around. Was in a mood so just huffed off. I probably walked 40 minutes, passing nothing of consequence but managed to leave the largest souvenier shop in the WORLD spending only a few $.

By the time I headed back around towards my hotel, I was famished and even more annoyed. Cut to the moment I once again saw this beacon across the street. All of a sudden everything fell into place. Breakfast was over but I'm not the biggest chicken and waffle fan anyway. But I AM the biggest fried chicken and sides fan in the world!

I was one of a few white folks in there. Any jew who eats chinese food (which btw is EVERY jew) knows that's how you know whether or not you should eat there. And I bet the white people were all southern. I hope I don't get in trouble for this one, as my loud mouth often gets me.

I really enjoyed my chicken. Crispy, moist (that word!) and deliscious. Cooked perfect. I've never had corn cakes before and I am in LOVE! Please give me these every day and I will never eat a pancake again. Mashed potatoes was great. The green beans were canned which wasn't awesome for me, so I asked instead for collard greens. I will admit I did not love them, but the caveat is that I'm still new to collard greens and sometimes I like them, sometimes not. Still trying to figure out why and since I don't cook them it's harder.

The decor is kinda cafeteria and bare bones with some cool stuff on the walls. The place on Friday around 11 was fairly busy but many seats were still open in the front area as it's a big space!

ATMOSPHERE:

M&M's newest location on Las Vegas Blvd. is a bit more open and spacious than their Charleston location, Memorabilia of celebrities and sports legends decorate the walls, and if you wish, there is counter dining as well. Service for the most part was okay, but at times, spotty. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and call it working out the service kinks.


BITES/BEVERAGES:

Fried Chicken is my entree of choice.. This time, I went with a half order($9.99) being that they are new, and we also had plans to go check out a new ice cream spot for dessert that opened earlier that day. My Half order came with a couple of Corn Cakes two pieces of dark meat (I'm a leg and thigh man when it comes to fried chicken) and two sides. I got the Cornbread Dressing and Collard Greens and some Muddy Water to enjoy with my meal. Although on the smallish side, my chicken was pretty good, as was my sides, but again, not as good as the Charleston location.


CLOSING STATEMENTS:

I really do hope the kitchen and service staff can fine tune things because not only are they in a good strip location, they also have potential to serve up some tasty soul food like the flagship location does.  ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3

So, if you do not want to feel rushed while eating or told that ""it takes 25 minutes to fry chicken, so don't ask"" do not walk in at 7:30 as we did without knowing the true closing time.  We were looking for an authentic soul food restaurant and an off the strip experience but this was not it.

After being told what not to order, I opted for the baked chicken and two sides.  I've never gone to a restaurant where the meat comes out first, at least 10 minutes before the accompanying sides - oops, only one side was brought out, the other was being cooked.  At that point I told the waitress to keep the second side, by the time it would have arrived, the other food would have been finished.  The baked chicken was just OK - gravy was too peppery but then again to each his own.  Overall, the chicken was just ok nothing to run home and tell anyone about.  The one side I did get - greens were good.

My husband had pork chops and three sides - greens, cabbage & rice/gravy.  He stated the pork chops and rice gravy were salty the veggies were good.

Opted for a cheese omelette with a few strips of bacon and a fresh and buttery biscuit washed down with fresh orange juice poured into a mason jar glass.

4126129,2016-08-22,2,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"Came here on a random Thursday night with a friend.  This restaurant is in one of the sketchier parts of town located near the Stratosphere, but my friend and I continued on in the name of food.  The restaurant itself is quite large and plainly decorated, it looked like this place could use a good sweeping too with straw wrappers/crumbs littering the floor.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Our server was friendly but not the most attentive (ex. forgot to bring out coffee requested). 

However, what saved our opinion of this restaurant was the food!  We ordered:
-Chicken Waffles ($10.99) - People you need to get this!  I about died from joy when I put the crispy on the outside, yet juicy on the inside fried chicken (3 pieces) in my mouth.  The waffles were so fluffy and delicious, I was so sad that it only came with 2 waffles.  This was definitely the stand out dish out of everything we ordered.  Get this and enjoy the savory sweetness of this dish. 
-Baked Chicken ($9.99 for Half Portion Size) - My friend ordered this and I had some of hers.  The baked chicken was smothered in a tasty BBQ sauce and the chicken was so tender that it literally fell off the bone.  The mac and cheese side was decent but the red beans and rice side dish was a little on the bland side. 
-Cornbread (free!) - Came out warm and delicious, no complaints here especially since it was free.
-Kool-Aid ($2.75) - Really good, but this was literally diabetes in a cup...just keep in mind they put a lot of sugar in it. 

I'm torn between giving this place a 3 star rating and a 4 star rating, if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  Yeah this place was a little dingy and dirty and our server forgot a couple of things, but the food knocked it out of the park for me.",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,5,1,3,wyZKLEennURu0UtktAc1MQ
4126468,2016-01-29,2,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"I'll give them 3 stars only because their fried porkchops were just THAT damn good.  They were a thick cut and they were moist and seasoned really well.

For sides, I got the cabbage, greens, and macaroni and cheese.  I can be picky about my macaroni and cheese, but this was absolutely the worst mac I've ever had.  It was basically like someone took Kraft mac and cheese, didn't cook the macaroni all the way, and used only a quarter of a packet of that fake cheese powder.  The cabbage smelled really old (I get it, I know what cabbage is SUPPOSED to smell like and i know it smells, but trust me on this one, guys).  I was scared to try the greens so..I didn't.  They could be good, but I honestly didn't get that far.

My boyfriend got the catfish and said it tastes like something out of the frozen section of the grocery store.  The potato salad side that he got was similar; no flavor and tasted like something from the grocery store deli.  He is a pescatarian and asked the waitress if the collard greens were cooked with any meat bc he can't have anything besides fish.  She said, ""No, no meat.  We cook it with turkey.""  My definition of meat could be off but...isn't turkey meat? No?

The servers were nice and very helpful and aside from the food, they made the experience positive.  The place looks like a real hole in the wall on the inside and outside, but I don't hold that against them because hole in the wall soul food places usually have the best food!

After receiving our food, she abruptly placed toast (wrong type of bread) on the table and said ""oh sorry"".  The food looked like slop from a prison cell!

Her words to us were ""you have to wait until we take care of all of our tables and maybe someone can help you"". Keep in mind we had already been waiting patiently for 15 min. We were finally able to get one young lady to assist us with our order. We ordered the friend chicken meals, with sides of candied yams, and mac n cheese. We were then told that it takes an additional 20 minutes on all fried orders. About 35 minutes later the food finally arrived. If we would've known it would've been that slow we would've sat down and eaten. 

We did notice that the kitchen employees were working very hard and get the food out quick. However the servers were not coming to get the food from the line in a timely manner. Therefor the chef had to yell a number do times for them to come get the customers food.

Im literally looking into the restaurant at empty tables and we still waited about an hour. The furniture looks like something from a yard sale for the owner to say the place is ""new"". The waiting area was literally two rows of fold out lawn chairs . Now on the the food. The food is definitely no worth the money and they over cooked the fish. The fish was fried to the point where it's was just batter . I understand trying to ""save money"" but when you have a business, under cutting your customers is not the way to go . My friends snapper looked like 1 filet cut in half again!  My fish was one small little filet .I was so disappointed with my plate I instantly returned it . The owner came out to speak with us and offered to compensate our horrible experience with a discount . The discount was a gracious 3% off !! That's not even tax! This place is ridiculous and a disgrace to the name and brand ""M&M soul food"" I'm so pissed & disappointed !!!",eG4E3ty-7_wQbPP3W6dsLA,2,0,1,wpElLMT9VGkLdf2a1EsnVA

The food though....solid four stars, all the time.....
The Fried Chicken is my husbands favorite, and he likes the collard greens, mac & cheese for the sides.

I grew up eating real southern soul food in Florida.  THIS is not real soul food.  It's over-priced wanna-be without any flavor.

There were LOTS of stems in the collard greens.  The ""meatloaf"" was nothing more than a salsbury steak, and a very small portion at that.  Also, the meat was raw in the center.  Undercooked ground beef is a recipe for food poisoning!  The fried pork chop was thin, mostly bone and fat, and flavorless.  The black-eyed peas were so over cooked they were mush and had a burnt taste to them.  Their ""world famous"" corn cakes were rubbery and flavorless.  They only good thing really were the mashed potatoes that had decent flavor and lumps (yes I love lumps in my mashed potatoes).  

The music was so loud it was impossible to carry on a conversation without yelling.  We went for dinner, so the sun was starting to set and was blazing down onto the tables making it hot and stuffy inside.  The staff never offered to change the blinds to block the sun even with us squinting and fanning ourselves while trying to block the sun with our hands.  Between the heat, the sun, and the sheer volume of noise from the music, I left with a pounding headache.  

The floors in the dining room were dirty.  The ladies room was FILTHY!  The trash cans were overflowing onto the floor.

While we may try the location on Charleston, we will not ever return to the location on Las Vegas Blvd.  Way over priced for the quality and quantity they serve.",0ZUN_H8JJAkmVWr6Ve0Yzg,2,1,2,MTTjXLd_nTktcm3onIupGA

When the server brought our forks, she brought a cup of hot water to rinse them off (who does that?)

We had 5 in our party, we got two cheap napkins. Asked for napkins three times? We got napkins when I went to the ladies room and got us paper towels. It's fried chicken wth are we gonna do with two napkins between 5 of us!

One of use asked for our server for her drink twice before getting it. One of us asked for refills twice ... never got a refill.

Now the food...Cornbread was good. It came 10 minutes after our meal was brought to us.  Chicken was over cooked and dry. Mac and cheese was so dry it wasn't edible,and the mashed potatoes were a'right.

When we walked in we were told to sit wherever. Which would have been fine except the only empty tables were dirty. So we waited about 5 minutes for them to clean a table off. We got sat directly in the sun so we asked to move tables. Which took another 25 minutes. During that time no one took our drink orders. We finally got seated and was told that our waitress would be right over. 5 minutes later she never came so the only helpful waitress working came back and took our drink and food order. We waited and waited still no drinks. We've been waiting for 50 minutes with no drinks at this point, not even water! At this point we asked for a manager. The manager was nice and worked on getting us our food and drinks. When we were explaining the situation to the manager one of the other waitresses who had an attitude problem chimed in and said well yea they didn't get served because they kept moving around. Her attitude and comments were completely unnecessary. After the manager stepped in we finally got drinks and our food came about 15 minutes after that. The table had no silverware so we asked one of the men there for a few forks and he said wow they really didn't do anything. The food was good, but not on the same level as their other location, the black eyed peas and red beans and rice were both bland. I will say the catfish was delicious. In the end they did try to make it better by comping our drinks and giving a percentage off of the meal. The manager and the girl who ended up serving us did apologize several times for the issues we had.

A group of six of my friends and I went to this restaurant after hearing great reviews. We were told there would be a 20-minute wait. No problem. After about 50 minutes to an hour we were finally seated. We sat at the table for over 20 minutes and witnessed The Waitresses seating several other tables and taking their orders but still had yet to come to our table. We politely asked why I order had not been taken yet because we had already been there over an hour. The waitress had no explanation so after sitting 10 more minutes we decided to get up and leave. A different waitress came outside and caught up with us and asked us to come back and apologized for the wait so we came back and sat down again. We waited another 10 minutes and finally our orders were taken. There were seven of us so of course it was a big order. 20 minutes later the same waitress comes back to our table and slams the receipt on the table and says the cook is refusing to make your order then she walks away!!!!!! Mind you at this point it had been well over an hour and a half we were never rude the entire time except to Simply ask why are order had not been taken it. There were plenty of reasons to act ignorant and make a scene but of course we never did. For absolutely no reason they refused our service because we we asked a time in being served. This was absolutely horrible customer service I don't care how good your food is you don't treat customers that way.

4995823,2016-06-27,0,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"We were very excited to see a reasonably priced soul food restaurant within walking distance of our hotel and on the strip! Couldn't wait to get in and have some amazing food.

We waited for over 20 mins for a table. Sad part, there were empty tables that could of been used, but weren't. We were given menus to look at and told that by the time we get our table our food would be ready. Nope. Can't order unless you are at a table or doing take out.

Once seated, we still had to wait almost another 20 mins for food. The menu doesn't accurately describe half size. Menu says that half size mean 2 side orders instead of 3. We ordered a half plate of catfish. We got 1 piece of fish. The two sides... one that we chose was out, but we weren't told until they brought our food out. Disappointing considering how long we waited to eat and that was one of the main things we wanted.

The food is alright. Mac and cheese is VERY GOOD. The catfish was on point. Their cornbread looks like small pancakes, but is pretty good too. The seasoning was hit or miss. Some things were great and some, not so much. The kool-aid, yes they have kool-aid on their menu, was soooooooo good!

Our waitress was pretty cool. She worked her tail off. I think her name was Skylar. From the moment we walked in, until we left, she was on the go and always very friendly. I loved her energy.

If it weren't for the long wait for a table, with multiple tables open I would of given 4 stars. The food isn't 5 star, but close.

The staff was very friendly and they welcomed us very warmly just like souther hospitality is known for. We came during breakfast hours and I got the chicken fried steak that came with two biscuits and potatoes, ordered the grits on the side. It was AMAZING. The batter was crisp, meat was very juicy and tender. Potatoes were on point and seasoning was great! The biscuits were so fluffy and soft and oh so buttery. Even the grits were hot and very fresh. Best chicken fried steak I've ever had. He got the chicken and waffles and he got three good size wings very crispy and seasoned. Waffles were Long shaped and very good looking. It was little crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside and it was perfect. Overall, the food was amazing, fresh, home made and authentic to their southern roots. The drinks came in cute mason jars. The presentation here is excellent. Also it is a huge restaurant. Service was over the top. She was fast, filled up our drinks often and she was so cute and nice!

My mother enjoyed everything she ordered only stating that the sides of red beans and rice and the greens could have been hotter.  They were like lukewarm. Which brings me to my food. The chitterlings were delicious. I normally don't eat them, but I wanted something different. Nothing else caught my eye. The yams were very delicious as well, they seemed to be fresh to me and not canned. The cabbage on the other hand was warm, and bland. They didn't really have any flavor to me. I was extremely disappointed in that fact because I've been waiting some cabbage.

5495011,2016-07-29,1,TXS-9SUkjpZFz29XOB1SPg,"Admittedly I LOVE SOUL FOOD and my hips do too. So I was in Vegas last week and we decided to try this place on Thursday. Actually I think that it may have been Friday ( all my days run together in Vegas!) So our uber drops us off right out front around 2 pm. There is a line coming OUT of the door and the waiting area inside to the right was at capacity. As soon as we make it inside, the manager (older black man with glasses) starts hollering for us to 'CLEAR THE WALKWAY' as it is a fire hazard. Insert deep sigh. So we CLEARRRRRRRRRR the walkway and get our name on the list. Some gentlemen get up so that my friendgirl and I can sit down. 

An energetic young waiter acknowledged that it was hotter than the hinges of hell and asked if any of us that were waiting wanted water and he brought us all water. I thought that was really nice. Meanwhile, people are still falling up in here (it was Hoodie award weekend and Omega Psi Phi conclave so I expected it to be really busy) I noticed several empty tables that were empty, however it took a long time for people to be seated at those tables, not sure if that was an oversight by whomever was in charge of the floor or what was going on with that. 

As our wait nears 30 minutes, two men (I won't even refer to them as gentlemen) walk in and the manager puts their name on the list. About 3 minutes later, the manager calls a name on the list with no response. He walks away and says something to the energetic waiter that brought us the water. Then, the waiter walks over to the waiting area and says 'JONES?' Do you know that the two men that JUST PUT THEIR NAME ON THE LIST HOP UP AND GET SEATED ALL WHILE THE MANAGER JUST WATCHES FROM THE BAR AREA?!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF?!!!!!!!! Like you KNOW they just came in. I decided NOT to say anything because I know that there are some men who don't give a fcuk about disrespecting women and I didn't want to put myself in that position. SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT FOR ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN. 

About 10 minutes later we were seated. By the kitchen. I was trying my BEST NOT to look in the kitchen, because if I did, I'm sure I would have lost my appetite. Waiters and waitresses blatantly ignored us for about 15 minutes. I didn't feel special though, because they were ignoring other customers that were seated by us also. Finally the waiter who brought the water earlier took our order. I got the smothered chicken, cabbage and mac and cheese and friendgirl got the smothered pork chop, mashed potatoes and collards. Food was pretty decent. Nothing to write home about though. When I go back to Vegas in a couple months I won't return simply because I don't agree with the way they run their business.

We walked in the door and there was no one there to greet us or take our name. A few people left so we sat down in the waiting area and some waitress walked over and asked how many in our party. She then sat us ahead of a few other parties. We then sat and waited........... 

I had to find my own menus and the waitress looked at me crazy when I reached for one. Like excuse me this is a restaurant, I need a menu to know what you offer. Then we waited some more................ 

15 min later someone walked by and handed us silver wear 

10 min after that the waitress came and said she would be right back........ Another 10 min and someone else said they would be right with us. Another 5 and we got cornbread pancakes with no butter (still no drinks). Another 10 min and we placed our drink order. Almost an hour goes by and we still haven't ordered our food. 

There is a disclaimer on the menu that it's another 20 min wait for fried food (most of the food on the menu is fried) 

10 min later we finally ordered food after I mentioned I was going to leave and go to IHOP (waitress overheard me) 

It has now been over an hour and just ordered our food. The waitress felt bad so she brought us another cornbread pancake but at this point I just want my food. But since we ordered fried food it will probably be another 20-30 min for that.

Pros: The Fried Chicken was very well seasoned as well as the catfish. The mac & cheese was good. The service was friendly & very efficient with refills. Order the homemade lemonade! So good. The peach cobbler was AMAZING! (Wish they had served it warm) For the ice cream they topped it with a quality brand of vanilla bean.

Cons: The cabbage lacked seasoning of any kind, I did find a minced piece of some unknown meat it was too small to determine. The greens were bland, the red beans and rice, as well as the rice & gravy was mediocre but wish that the serving size had been larger to accommodate 3 large oxtails. Now the oxtails were very VERY good! From the meat perspective but the ratio of fat to meat was a losing battle, they were so fatty! (Picture to follow).

After we were moved to the other side of the restaurant, our drink order was taken but, we didn't receive the drinks. Cornbread arrived and still no drinks and No waitress to take our order. We ask for some water at that point since they did bring us something to snack on. The water never arrived. Finally, our waitress arrives and takes our drink orders again (still no drinks at this point) and our food order. Our food finally arrives but, we still do not have our drinks. Oh, I forgot to mention, the waitress smells of weed when she's taking our orders. So, we finally get our drinks and most of our food has arrived. My son has no food. My daughter ordered the last of the ribs so, he now has to order something else on the fly. We still didn't get any water but the waitress brings us our bill and asks if we would like to take some drinks to go. When she comes back with our to go drinks, she now informs is that we cannot use our cards to pay the bill because the machine was down. Now, that would've been useful information when we first arrived, as we had already used most of our cash earlier in the day.

I will be back when I'm in Vegas. We were staying at the SLS Las Vegas and stumbled upon this gem which is just a hop and a skip. We had 3 entrees and 6 sides shared between 2 people which was MORE than enough food. Everything was savory and cooked to perfection. Shoutout to the collard greens which is a good I'm always picky about and the short ribs. Notable mentions for the fried chicken and snapper. Ne-Ne let us know about the original LA locations which is where I reside and I will now be visiting. Thank you guys.

Then after I asked Tonisha if breakfast was still being served. She proceeded to tell me breakfast was over at 10:45am when I know that breakfast should be over at 11:00am. After recanting her statement about breakfast being over she left my table to take someone else's order that arrived after my family. That rude gesture was only second to her purposely waiting until after 11:00am so much so that I had to get up and locate her manager to take our order and inform us that breakfast was over yet again. 

Needless to say I voiced my disgust with the matter and promptly took my family and left. Never to return to this location again. 

It is a sad shame that when we as a people try to support black business and give back to the community and we are treated with such contempt and disregarded with complete disrespect.",uwnE8036cwfAaOyOzetwyQ,7,0,1,8p0S_1DKc3vKXksDomOyRQ

I love there chicken and I will say it's delicious , but I constantly receive what they have and not what I order . They have no system for take out. You can be first there but they will take the order of another because they don't know who was there first. 45 minutes to receive your food and not what you ordered is why I am giving it 2 stars. The Mac and cheese is not worth ordering since there is little cheese in it. There greens and yams are great.

I came back and my food was hot and ready for me with a smile and a sincere apology. Also the manager immediately greeted me with an apology and a smile when he saw me come in.
