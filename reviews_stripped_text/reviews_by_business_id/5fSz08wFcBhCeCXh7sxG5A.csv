They are conveniently located in Atlantic Aviation (the General Aviation FBO) so patrons of the FBO just may be most of their business? Very often we (flight crews) leave there in the morning and want to take a sandwich with us for lunch. BUT, they won't sell you a sandwich before lunch.   It's not that they can't, they won't. Patrons are told ""I can make it, but I'll get in trouble"". The manager needs to wake up and realize who their customers are.",bPiiaKfd270DVQKhdYfPbg,2,1,1,IGC4XFRYGwrGSEHlvZ80nw

I got their at the transition time between breakfast and lunch. I asked the girl what was the best seller in the house and she recommended to Philly cheesesteak because it didn't take very long to cook.

The Philly cheesesteak came out within about a five minute time frame. They wrapped it all up for me in a little to go bag so I can take it on the flight to the next stop. The sandwich was great it was one of the best Philly cheesesteaks I've had in a long time. Will definitely come back and try something else on the menu.",ciAlgQnvj4L4DhajfqkHDw,0,0,4,7-5N-effwnLqQUkJu9mscg
