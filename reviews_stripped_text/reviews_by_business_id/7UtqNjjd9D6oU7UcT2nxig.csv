We were looking for an easy sandwich place to satisfy our lunch time craves and I just knew I had to expose them to the deliciousness that is Capriotti's.
The two most popular sandwiches are by far the Bobbie and the Capistrami.  The Bobbie can be summed up as Thanksgiving on a roll, with fresh turkey meat, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  The Capistrami has pastrami meat, thousand island dressing, swiss cheese and cole slaw.  Both are great options and I go back and forth between the two.  I've also heard the Philly Cheese Steak is pretty darn good too, but I have yet to try it.
The sandwiches always take a little longer to make at Capriotti's (especially if you are comparing to something like Subway), but we don't usually mind.  After all, it takes longer to make when its fresh. You can also call ahead and order, and I believe this location delivers!",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,0,0,5,FRMuW6BTwIHMyzYZGJ56hw

Other then her none of the employees are on the same page about anything everyone acts like they don't know what's going on..... I ordered a sandwich by phone the person making it seemed like he was rushing me off the phone and then when I got home had the wrong order....

Needless to say I ate the entire sub in like 4 stop lights.....it was that good.  Perfect blend of salty, sweet, hot, and cold.

1260874,2018-05-19,0,7UtqNjjd9D6oU7UcT2nxig,"On 0t/17/18 at approximately 1100 hours, I ordered some food for pick-up at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop located at 8450 W. Sahara Las Vegas,NV. suite 116.  When I  arrived for pick of my order, a young lady, told me that she couldn't find my order.  I gave her the online confirmation number and she still had some difficulty finding my order. She finally asked someone else and my order was discovered. Pick-up was at 1200 hours.  I ordered two large bowls of chicken and noodles soup.  Also, ordered two sandwiches.  A Bobbie 20"" and a Chicken Cheese Steak 12"".  A young man who made the sandwiches and handed me a paper bag with one soup inside of it.  When I told him that wasn't correct, he said what's wrong with it.  Instead of looking at the written order, I  felt he wanted to continue to question me about what I had ordered.  I told him that I had ordered two large Chicken Soups.  Again, instead of looking at the written order, I felt he was not pleased with me for saying the order was not correct;  terrible attitude.  
In my judgement, this Capriotti's isn't orgainzed  when an order is placed online.   Also, the person making the sandwiches/food has a bad demeanor.  
Also, if you order a large bowl of soup which is $5.99, it's not, in my opinion, large.  So, don't expect it to be.  And the person making the sandwiches roiled the sandwiches so small that you think your getting a tightly rolled Cuban cigar.  The Bobbiie and Chicken Cheese Steak meat was paste too.  
These are my judgements of what took place for me and wantrd to give others this information inorder to make their own decision if one wants to use this Capriotti's Sandwich Shop location. I'm sure most Capriotti's Sandwich Shops are not like this one.  My opinion is to think twice about ordering from this location.

Hopefully Capriotti's reads this and realizes that their female black employee whom is trying to look like Rihanna needs some serious customer service skills. She is terrible. I placed a phone order at this location. I walk in to pick it up. I walk up to the front register where she is standing there fiddling around with the register and I stand there, right in front of her. And for about 20 seconds she refuses to even acknowledge my existence, even though I'm standing right there in front of her. I have no problem with you finishing what you need to do but at least acknowledge me and say ""be with you in a minute"" or something like that. But it's a pet peeve of mine when you just ignore me. 

After that she asks what I need I say I am picking up an order. She tells me the amount and I give her my credit card. She hands me the receipt. I sign it and she goes back to fiddling with the register. At this point I figure my order isn't ready yet since she didn't say anything. But as I'm standing at the counter I see my order sitting on the back counter. Completely ready to go and getting cold. So I wait a little bit as she is still staring at the register I say ""is my order ready?"" Without responding to me or even looking at me she just turns around and grabs my sandwiches puts them in a bag and hands it to me. Without saying a word. Without even looking at me, nothing at all.

So I get there and there is no need to even look at the menu. I know what I'm there for...the Bobbie. I see signs around saying how it's been voted the best sandwich around and so now I'm desperate to try this amazing sandwich. 

I get my order to go and when I get home. I unwrap the sandwich like a kid unwrapping his first present on his birthday. With so much excitement and glee. I swear my eyes are twinkling at this point. 

I look at it. It's a mess. Cranberry, Turkey, and stuffing piled on to the max...I bust out my camera and take my yelp photo then open my mouth as big as it opens and sink my teeth into....disappointment. 

The turkey was nothing special. No flavors. The cranberries were over powering and the stuffing....that was the worst part. Didn't know you could actually ever make stuffing taste bad. Now I know you can. It lacked the flavor and the texture I was looking for.

I invited some of my Vegas buddies to go here for lunch with me a couple of weeks ago and I was pretty disappointed. The food was really good, but that's where the enjoyment stopped. When I got there I really had to use the restroom when I asked the staff if they could unlock the bathroom in the rear. They told me it will be just a few moments. Having to go so badly, I decided to go around to the back of the building and wait hoping that they would see me go back there and help me more quickly. I waited back there for about 10 minutes and nobody came to the door so I messaged my friend to ask the staff to open the door for me and they said they would in a few moments. It's OK I'm about another five minutes before they came and unlocked the door for me. That was annoying because I really had to go. 

I was also annoyed because I figured that my food will be cold once I got back inside however, after about 20 minutes from the time that I ordered my food was not ready. About five minutes later it came up. 25 minutes at lunchtime is pretty unacceptable in a sandwich shop. Then I took a look at the sandwich and it was done incorrectly. So although she was very nice, she had to remake it. That's OK about another five minutes so about 30 minutes to get a sandwich. Unsatisfactory in my book.

My favorite so far is the Italian. The seasonings and blend of oil, vinegar and sauces just melt together to crest a rich base for the sandwiches.

I then approached the counter where the other guy had his back to me making sandwiches. He then turned around and obviously saw me.  With zero eye contact, he ignored me completely. No greeting, no ""hi, I'll be right with you,"" no nothing.

After standing there for quite some time, I turned around and walked out.  It was as if I were never even there.  And I will never ever return to be ignored again. Thanks guys, for treating me as poorly as one could possibly be treated.",GdnJtqYWVSBAjya-WdN5RQ,0,0,1,HGdxbAydsN4QcsSTNH7tGg

I ordered my standard: a medium ""bobbie"" with cheese. I've got to say that I've had this sandwich probably 4 times now at other Capriotti's, and this was the driest that it has ever come. A sandwich that features stuffing, bread and dry turkey better have some mayo on it. Otherwise, your mouth will be left drier than Britney Spears' concert calendar.

I was moving the other weekend and decided to order Caps for my friends that were helping me. I placed a catering order two days ahead of time. I ordered a small tray which has three different sandwiches included. I ordered a Bobbie, an Italian and ham with cheese. My ONLY request was that the sauces, like mayo and mustard, be on the side so the sandwiches won't get soggy. They offered for some pickles and olives to be on the side as well which I agreed to. Million, the manager, took this order. He also called me the morning of the pickup to verify everything. I had my hopes riding pretty high that this was going to go well. I was wrong. 

The sandwiches ended up being made with NOTHING on them except meat and cheese. No lettuce. No tomato. No onion. We had to ask for the sauces after all as they didn't have them ready. I found this out once the catering tray was at the new home I moved to. They forgot to send me with all the veggies and never packed cranberry sauce...for the Bobbie. 

I called to notify them of the issue. Million told me I should check my bags again to make sure because he thought I definitely had everything I needed. After checking again I told him I was bringing it all back for a refund. Once I showed up with all the original food, the two girls making sandwiches profusely insisted that I just pickup all the missing items and bring them back to the house. Apparently my time driving across town to get the correct order is of no consideration at all. I finally told them how ridiculous it is that they couldn't provide me with HALF of what a sandwich is made of. Million wouldn't even come out of the office to show his face or apologize. Coward. 

All franchises are not created equal. I'll never use this location again. It's been nothing but a disappointment. You're just making sandwiches....last time I checked, it wasn't that hard.",kmXn7iEJWGDGbWUiEmZ_kA,1,0,1,0pRi3v-uBcEc58TEghYeXw

As a sandwich-lover, I cannot get enough of this place and have since tried most of the options on the menu. I think the best is the roast beef - pulled instead of sliced like at most sandwich places.

The sandwiches are made-to-order, so it can take a little longer than other sub shops, like Subway, but it is well worth it. You still get a pretty full array of options on the sandwich, it just isn't in an assembly line. They don't have many sides (only an atypical selection of potato chips), so you go here just for the sandwiches. Also, it's more of a take-away place. They do have a small bar and one table where you could dine-in if you really wanted to, but there's no atmosphere. It's basically just a deli counter.

5199023,2010-03-26,3,7UtqNjjd9D6oU7UcT2nxig,"Capriotti's deserves special accolades for offering three very legitimate vegetarian options. I am not talking about a salad on a loaf. No, they offer much more than that. They have fake meat! To be specific, you can get a vegetarian turkey, cheesesteak or hamburger. I find this astounding and convenient especially here in Las Vegas where the closest thing to vegetarian is often cranberry and vodka. Blech.

Ran into my neighborhood Capriotti's today to grab a sandwich. For a chain, they are really lacking in a cohesive design. Pretty much every Capriotti's I have visited looks terrible. My neighborhood location has several glass-enclosed bulletin boards, and while waiting for my sandwich, I was noticing that every one had a section of USA today tacked up. I am sure there is an explanation for this, but as a casual observer it seemed random.

Service was quick and friendly. I walked out with a 12-inch vegetarian turkey sub with everything except cheese and mayo. Capriotti's loses some sub-cred by not offering a selection of breads and for closing at like 7pm on the weekdays in my hood. However, they do white, soft bread rather well, and they regain some cred by having really flavorful peppers. I think the peppers make the sandwich. The fake meat must be decent because my taste buds had no complaints. Then again, perhaps they were distracted by the peppers. Either way, Capriotti's is fine by me, and I think they are quite a find for a vegetarian in need of a quick meal.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,8,3,5KlCL_ZGgDt5-nVWB6vjNA

The first time I walked into this place, the staff behind the counter was super friendly. I told them I was a Capriotti's virgin and asked for some recommendations. The nice girl behind the counter suggested the ""Capastrami"" which is ""Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw on a soft roll."" How can one go wrong with that? ""Sure thing"" I fired back and we were off to a journey towards flavorful bliss.

I watch in anticipation as the sandwich maker spins his magic. About 7 minutes later, my name is called out and this masterpiece wrapped in white butcher paper is bestowed upon me. To make a long story short... I ate it. It was damn good. The pastrami was tender and the cole slaw and russian dressing ratio was perfect. The bread was soft and the whole sandwich warm and inviting. I didnt think I was going to eat the whole thing.... But damn it was good. I didnt want to take the risk of bringing half of it home and not letting the sandwich fulfill its destiny.

On my 2nd trip back I ordered the Bobbie and it was a little dry. Somehow I thought the turkey would be warm. It's served cold. It was still good nevertheless.

On my 3rd trip back I ordered the meatball sandwich. It was yummy... But somehow my heart still belongs to the Capastrami.

I included some pictures. Dang. How do you people write food reviews without getting hungry?!",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,8,10,4,wrexVOkUL01ze3y9GtPG_g

I deducted one star because they need a better restroom situation.",thi-jmMx-himXfCw_EuDSw,0,0,4,kPHfGZ7QERg0F8iBAsr56w

Review in regards to the customer service. A few times my order was incorrect. This particular occasion, it started out okay. I had ordered 4 sandwiches online to avoid the wait, but it looked like the staff was slammed. I had to wait an additional 10/15 minutes. I got my sandwiches, and decided to check them. Two of my sandwiches did not have a marking on them. I requested the slaw and sauce of the capastrami to be on the side, and neither one were in the bag. 
I mentioned it to the cashier, and she was unsure so she asked the others which was which. One gentleman took 3 of the sandwiches, and reopened all of them. From what I could see my order was made incorrectly. He fixed it with a not so happy demeanor thus a star deducted. Oh well, I am just glad he fixed it.",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,5,5,4,ZcsSqijhCf8n13apj8UtMA
5495296,2017-03-11,0,7UtqNjjd9D6oU7UcT2nxig,I was the only customer in the shop.  Ordered a Bobbie to eat there.  I didn't mind that the one guy behind the counter wanted to be chatty while I ate but was it really necessary to tell me about your acid reflux and the fact that you throw up when you wake up too early?  Seriously train your employees please.,L0AoWLv7jUmM_rfDlq_Msg,0,0,2,5VaQ-596ay240qlc8kJpJQ
5500542,2010-02-10,1,7UtqNjjd9D6oU7UcT2nxig,"I personally like the food at Capriottis, I prefer the one on Silverado Ranch for a few reasons.

1. It is much cleaner
2. The staff is much friendlier 
3. The food is prepared better 
4. They have yet to mess up an order

The location on Sahara is not very clean and everytime we have called in an order the girl that ""ALWAYS"" seems to answer the phone is completely rude and for some reason does not understand what no peppers means. The sandwiches are always a few notches below the other locations and the attitude of the employee may actually play into that response. 
I hope they can turn around the customer service and clean up the act a little because overall capriottis has a good product.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,2,2,2,W_KUBwBmUtJJHHcS4RLKyQ

It's a good thing the sandwiches are so delicious or this location would go outta business. Try another location for the same sandwiches.,l_evb28R9tee2slynDY2nQ,1,0,2,upVlBNiTY9ejDax-EMdFoQ

5848400,2011-06-25,4,7UtqNjjd9D6oU7UcT2nxig,"""I did it all for the Bobbie"" 

Yes folk's ""Bobbie"" sub is their nationally acclaimed best seller. 
Real turkey (not the processed junk) cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo seal the deal. 

Thanksgiving dinner on a roll, come on seriously...does it get any better? 

I am just a fan of turkey period, turkey and bacon, turkey and cheese, turkey and avocado, you name it I like it. The ""Bobbie"" sub is my ultimate favorite way of eating my turkey in form of a sub by far. 

I know most of us las vegas locals are aware of this sub, if you are a visitor or new to Capriotti's then give this sub a shot! 

*Honorable mention is the ""Capistrami"" sub, hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw. Mmmm yummy as well.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,11,5,3,WrGvJzuwJSbievFjb72Jlw
