He then offered me some coupons instead i stated i wanted my money for the difference, he then said the lady that waited on us never brought to his attention our order was wrong.

Not once did we get an im sorry and we had to wait for our burgers and it almost seemed like they just wiped the mayo off put some heat on the burger and brought it back out. I think a big issue is both times our order was taken it was by a latina who i don't think understood english well because we always have to repeat our order more than once i have not been back i refuse to give my money to a buisness that has no customer service nor do they appologize for their mistakes.

I placed an order for a boneless wing combo, plus two small drinks since it was happy hour. When I finally got up to the window to pay, and the employee read my order back to me, it was wrong. Totally okay, it was only off by two items, so I corrected him and he went back to correct it. I get that it's happy hour, it's a busy time, and these things happen. It's really not a big deal.

What wasn't okay was taking 20 minutes to fix a small error. All that was wrong was fries instead of tots for the combo, and adding one small drink they forgot to add. Literally 20 minutes at the window for that. When the cashier finally made contact with me again, he mistakenly read back a medium drink instead of a small drink. I just said that was fine because I would have been there for another 10 minutes if I would have corrected him again.

The correction took so long that one of the carhops delivered the orders to two people behind me in the drive thru. The employees knew it was taking too long - so what gives? They also charged me full price for the order, while other Sonic locations have given me orders for free for waiting half the time.

WHAT?

I promptly put my car back in drive and left (good thing you're not sandwiched in like most drive-thrus). I wonder if this is a nationwide epidemic.

In all seriousness, Sonic does serve good food. But if they no longer do malts, that's an epic fail.

5337066,2018-06-01,0,ccd6w9w81PUBmtV1DFXgig,"""Fast"" food. Honestly it would be quicker to go milk a cow and make your own ice cream instead of sitting in the drive-thru line at this location. We came on a Thursday night at 1:30 AM and it took until 2:20 AM to get the milkshake. Honestly it's a once in a blue moon occurrence when I go to Sonic's but this experience makes me never want to come back. Upon reaching the front of the line, the shakes were melting from sitting out for such a long period of time. As someone who works in customer service, I completely understand when something goes wrong in the work environment; however, the two girls at the register were rude and unapologetic. Other customers were exiting the line and complaining about the drawn out wait for their food, meanwhile, the girl was on her cellphone. I would highly suggest providing better training to the young employees who work here, especially since it's a good place to indulge in once in a while but even then, there are better options that are opened 24/7.",52FeOAXrqwKuwZXmH5q_fw,0,0,1,WCFf9qBvWtltNQd8VDIgPQ

Today I went and it was just a horrible experience. A server by the name of Amanda had the absolute WORST attitude and didn't want to fix our order after she messed it up.

I'm pretty sure they are milking the cow to use to make the ice cream for my shake. Avoid at all costs. I'm actually upset I have to give 1 star. There needs to be an option to give negative stars.

After going to the disgusting, smoke-laden and not poppin' Strip last night, my sister and I drove over here. We split the popcorn chicken meal with tater tots (she had the drink to herself because I had my trusty water bottle with me.) There was more than enough food in this single meal for us to split.

Service was decently fast and with a tip, $8.50 isn't too bad for two people to eat. The fact it's open 24 hours is FABULOUS!

I paid 11.60 for 2 half price shakes after 8pm. Upon arrival no answer at the car hop so myself and other cars resorted to the drive through. I had to get out of my car and speak into the drive through speakers because they could not hear. I paid for my order. Two shakes a half-price cheeseburger and a regular price double bacon cheeseburger. Checked it before I left and it was wrong. I parked AGAIN and requested it be corrected. After waiting an additional 17 minutes for a response requested a refund for the double bacon cheeseburger they got wrong on the order. MANAGER brings me $2.05 for a $5.99 regular price burger.

Everything on their menu screams all american fast food greatness from their chili cheese tater tots to their foot long coney's to their famous limeades. And the best part? You can either go through the drive thru or opt to pull into one of their many stalls and eat in your car!
