We had two of their specialty cocktails on a Friday night during summer.  Very refreshing.  However, was very disappointed in the size to price ratio.  Pretty expensive for a drink that did not even fill up what I think was a 10oz cup.  Any who, life goes on.

The place itself is very well put together.  All the decor, the colors, the furniture, etc.  someone did a great job in designing the place.

Very yummy Turkey Brie panini. The crunch on the bread and the apricot jam just make this a melty goodness and I would order it again. The negative - two house wines ordered and unavailable, with no offer of substitution. So I opted for ice water instead which came from the tap of the hand sink. Gross and a big no no. This is a cute place in Container Park and the girls working there seem to have it together. Not sure who the guy is, that came out checking on things and handing out handsink tap. I'm going to try the Lobster roll next time, but I'll check first to see if they have stocked their house wine.",B9ZoUgcyy45HlzJG0tNwuA,3,1,3,v6kkkpYgtmPdHgkLNFcpVQ

737211,2014-03-21,0,NCR20zyNvXPb3gYpZqAvbQ,"We had a fantastic night here. The service was on point, the drink menu is solid, and the food was delicious.

My boyfriend and I arrived at about 6:00. This was my first time at the Container Park, so I was a bit nervous about how ""Disney-ified"" it looked. But, the sun was still up, kids were everywhere; I decided to be patient. We went straight to Bin 702 and found a table inside immediately, despite the limited seating. There were three employees working that night and each served us in turn. They were welcoming and willing to chat with us. It was a bit loud because there was music playing outside and inside is such close quarters that you can hear other tables and people at the bar clearly. 

We had 2 rounds of unibrou maudite to drink and to eat we had the deviled eggs and the ""bin"" (which is a combo. cheese board and charcuterie) to start, and then we split the Italian panini. I recommend you try everything I just listed. Not a weak item in the bunch. We especially relished the bin board, which also includes olives, nuts, and honey and jam. The Italian panini was like the Platonic ideal of a panini: melty cheese and salty meat between crispy, warm bread. We spent about $80, not including tip, which seems reasonable to me. 

By the time we finished, the sun was down and the kids had gone. We sat outside of the restaurant and enjoyed people-watching for a while. It was an all-around lovely evening and I hope to enjoy another night at Bin 702 again soon.",H7f5JJM4FFXyqm4_jtfC_w,2,0,4,_1TCPaWprvScjBnuuLCgYQ

Great place for locals, business persons, or just a tourist looking for great vibes! Bin 702's location in Container Park downtown Las Vegas, Freemont East, is perfect.

So far, my favorite thing to order on the menu for a beverage, is the last option, be adventurous and let the bartender decide for you!

The guys and gals, such as Davey and Desiree,  have flare and style with such unique qualities that come together and you taste the love in the food and drinks!

We were very excited to try the happy hour menu after we read the sign outside the patio area. We arrived around 3:00pm, placed our drink order, and asked about one of the food items listed on the ""Happy Hour"" menu posted outside. We were rudely told by a blonde bartender ""No food on the Happy Hour menu, all full priced-what would you like?"" We accepted the response and ordered two of the full price ""hot cheeto paninis."" After our order was placed around 3:15pm, we sat on the patio and enjoyed our drinks. There were only 3 other parties being served on the patio, the inside of the establishment was empty. The large party that arrived after us received an incredible amount of food before us around 3:30pm. My boyfriend approached the bar counter to ask about the status of our food, but before he was able to ask, the blonde bartender asked him how we enjoyed our sandwiches. He explained that we hadn't received our food yet, but that we were fine with waiting a few more minutes. She offered no apology or explanation. 4:00pm rolls around, still waiting for our food, and I approached the bar counter to ask about the status of our sandwiches. The bartender responded ""Sh*t, hold on we'll get them out to you."" as someone who looked like the cook yelled from behind the bartender, ""I'm throwing them on the grill now!"" We received two very simple sandwiches around 4:20p with no apologies or compensation for making us wait over an hour for our food. As we ate, one of the employees stood on the patio conversing with one of the other parties, cursing about every 5 words, yelling, ""Fu*k Trump! Put me on a tv show, I'll tell the whole world! She continued to scream her political views, high fiving the party around her, then ended the speech with, ""Sh*t, I'm on the clock, I should probably get back to work. Fu*ck Trump!"" and walked back inside. The family with two small children sitting near the patio got up and walked away, while a man who was clearly on a phone call, had to get up and relocate due to how loudly she had been screaming. Overall, it was not an enjoyable experience. This bummed us out because we typically love our afternoons downtown/in the container park. Will not be returning, and as locals, we will not be recommending Bin702 to any of our friends or visitors we have.",bxDOs_sho8V5SVOgBzcn6A,0,0,2,cK8bmcnZ3Oh_KnMtrDRkWA
1169770,2017-07-15,0,NCR20zyNvXPb3gYpZqAvbQ,"So, so close to five stars.

I came here with the intention of the trying the very delicious looking flamin' hot grilled cheese. 

The staff is friendly, and the container is cute. It's obviously not very big, so I am glad it wasn't busy. 

The grilled cheese has great flavor. I loved the bread; it was so thick and fluffy. The cheetos added just the right amount of kick. I was surprised to see the cheeto dust added after grilling. Usually, it's added before, so it doesn't fall off. This version makes it a little harder to eat, but the flavor is stronger. 

I had to take one star off because the cheese wasn't melted all the way. It's just not quite grilled cheese with only semi-melted cheese. They should consider how to better make sure the cheese is fully melted with such a thick bread. Don't get rid of the bread -- just melt the cheese more! 

Overall, I would definitely eat it again.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,1,0,4,RHuD-GCGIotOESbvpsvdfA

We were served our wine in small clear plastic glasses and my boyfriend was given the wrong wine - he ordered a red and the bartender gave him a white wine. He let her know she had given him the wrong wine, and she tried to correct it, but was out of the original wine he had ordered.

The advertised happy hour was solid, something like $4 for a beer or wine and a few food specials. We decided to grab one of their luxurious grilled cheese options. They ranged from a $6 standard to a $15 lobster grilled cheese. We sampled the original and an apple/bree - holy cheese this was good! Really nice melding of flavors on a some boss bread! The original with white cheddar was quite lovely as well - served on some thick toast, it was delicious!

All in all, this was just about the perfect restaurant for adults watching the kiddos run off energy. The gals inside were very nice and kept things moving nicely. End of the day - Beer, wine, sangria, grilled cheese, done!",1yXVKvK7uYjAZnonIl3jNg,1,1,5,vUHz8URcERiADIIx4vHE-w

The ingredients were very fresh and the bread was flaky and had the perfect amount of herbs placed. The ingredients were top notch from what I could tell. The reason I'm giving them a 3 stars is that none of our sandwhiches had melted cheese. Its like they put everything together and then press it on a panini hot press to give it grill marks.

1. Lobster Grilled Cheese
2. Brie, Apple, and Honey Grilled Cheese
3. FLAMING HOT TURKEY GRILLED CHEESE 
4. Cuban Montadito (bite size sandwich)

Verdict: 

1. Lobster Grilled Cheese was sooooooo goood! I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought it would taste more mayo-y and not lobster-y but NOPE, you could actually taste the lobster. The bread is so crispy but also soft. Highly recommend. 
2. Brie, Apple, and Honey Grilled Cheese. This was good but after the Lobster Grilled Cheese it was a little bland. Maybe it needed more honey? I would get this but I would definitely eat this first. 
3. Flaming Hot Grilled Cheese. Maybe my expectation was too high bc I loveeeee Flaming Hot Cheetos. I mean don't get me wrong, I still ate it and licked my fingers but I kind of wish there were Flaming Hot Cheetos served on the side! That would've been perfection. 
4. Cuban Montadito. Don't waste your time on the small sandwiches. Just get a big one. I bet the regular Cuban would've been delicious.",KRUfX3aZdOV2sLigsTpAAw,0,0,4,mgm5CwatRxlNN48FBEIbcw

My husband & I went in prior to Happy Hour to beat the crowds & it was still very crowded and you feel like a sardine in there because it is a bit warm with very little seating. So to the left is this wall of couches and there were two young women there reserving 2/3 of the couch for their friends who weren't even there yet! Had their feet up on the couch!! Since when is THAT okay??? When I mentioned it to the bartender she did zilch about it so I told the girls when her friends arrive we will get up!! Friends never arrived the entire time we were there.Hardly any seating in the place so they need to have some rules about that. Biggest problem was the bartender, a tall tattooed blonde woman who kept repeating like we were brain dead that hey, I am the only person here taking orders! We never complained & we just stood there. But the clincher and the reason we will NEVER go back & we go to Vegas quite often is this bartender! When the bar thinned out we got up & sat at the bar. My husband & I were conversing about something that happened back home & I said something to him which & get this the bartender eaves-dropped & gave me this look & attitude that was beyond belief!! Firstly, I wasn't even talking about anyone in there and what a rude thing to do to not only listen to a private convo but then huff about it, roll your eyes & act as if I was talking about HER! It was pretty ridiculous. When I saw her do this I said right away to her that we weren't talking about anyone there, YET she proceeded to show the disgusted face & acted all annoyed!! Lol! Huh?? Really Bin702!! Save this crap for your therapist. I was there to relax & should be able to talk about what I want to quietly with my hubby without getting judgement OR someone listening in, let alone making faces & judging!!! It was so weird. Prices are high for the grilled cheese which is just okay. Seriously, Over $34.00 for two grilled cheese ( and NOT the lobster) and three beers.The girl making the grilled cheese was very nice but JEEZ....I mean really? They cater to the locals & the bartender was VERY obvious in who she preferred and who she gave priority to. Trust me when I say it wasn't US. I am a VERY generous tipper even when service is lacking some. This reaction by her & lack of organization overall in how things are being done is something I don't want to revisit. Sorry, but I was so excited about coming here and what a let down. If they would be more organized and nicer it could improve.Maybe she was having a bad day who knows but did I feel welcome....NO, was the food phenomenal...NO was this place comfortable....NO.

Recently my boyfriend and I went and had great service and of course, top quality service and  grilled cheeses!  We, of course, bragged about it and sharing photos with our friends. We went out last night to enjoy the weekend shenanigans at DTLV. As the drinks and night rolled on, so did the need for food. Everyone we brought wanted these grilled cheeses. 

1st problem my boyfriend encountered. Our order was written on a napkin, not put in the computer. We waited, socialized. It was fairly busy when we first got there, around 11:10 but hey, it's Saturday on in the Fremont area, we wouldn't expect less. It died down before we ordered however. 30 minutes pass, we are tired AND hungry. I go see what's going on. The bartender was too busy chatting w three gentleman and partaking in their sampling of beers. Took another 5 minutes before I was next. I asked how much longer for the food and handed my receipt. This was accepted with an ""Oh shit! She didn't make your food??"" Um, excuse me? The line behind her was void of the person who was making the sandwiches and she had to text her for her whereabouts. Lord knows where she was (busy stocking, I was told). Please note, I wasn't looking for free food or some sort of comp. An apology, a sincere apology could have done it. But apparently I ""should have come and nudged us! We make them pretty quick!"" Why should I be aware of the timing you know you need to provide good service??? Anyway, I asked to be refunded and was told again, I should ask in the future to make sure food is on its way. I said, there probably won't be a next time. She was null of giving a crap.

She didn't need the card for the refund nor did we receive a receipt of the reversed transaction. So I will be making sure we actually get the money back. 

Another table was complaining about not having food yet as we were leaving (we were 5 people, who ordered the 12 mini deals) that party was larger and they pretty much saw the whole thing go down. They probably didn't get their food either.  I was pretty disappointed in the situation overall and the bartenders failure to provide good customer service.

Most of us ordered the lobster grilled cheese. I thought it was ok, not something extremely amazing or different. It was packed with lobster meat but I think it was processed, definitely didn't taste fresh. I don't think I would order it again.

So why 4 stars?..our server was amazing. She  was all alone and she was still running in the back to help the People cook and prep the food. She was apologetic and as attentive as she could be all alone. Service definitely makes or breaks an experience.....she made mine!",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,10,11,4,UWxkHHcDeSKHAKn0tqrjKw

Only because not fan of dealing with the whole downtown parking or the distance from my house just keeping it real yelpers. loll. 

While hanging out at the container park for few hours started to get hungry. Thankfully talk about LOT of options comes to food. We started with some solid day drinking got some beer at bin 702. We checked out the menu but since just got there decided stick with the nice craft bottle beer. I forgot the name but it was grapefruit style beer that was tasty. I look over the menu quick notice lot of sandwiches, some anti pasta or charcuterie board, and some other options. The kitchen not really kitchen. It more small deli sandwich kind of set up behind the bar area. So the menu not that big but never been fan of huge menu. Diversity can be great thing in restaurant business. Sometimes keep it simple small and high quality take it all day. I ended up getting the Flamin Hot Cheetos Grilled Cheese. Come on start grilled cheese sandwich. What not to LOVE about that??? Cheetos that peaked my interest I was impressed!!! It definitely kicked grilled cheese sandwich up few notches. The bread was amazing. They use panini style pressed looks like on most of the sandwiches or my grilled cheese they did. The bread is nice crusty, crispy, and the perfect crunch bite dive into great sandwich. The cheese and the cheetos (most of it crush up fine on the outside of the bread) gives the sandwich not only different look but adds another flavor never had before in sandwich. Just perfect light/just right size sandwich enjoy beautiful outdoor weather had that day. 

The service thought was fabulous!!! Friendly. We were chilling with my friends kids out by the stage area with fake grass and lego blocks and other building foam things for the kids. They brought our food out no problems. They do have some indoor dining and outdoor seating. 

So not doubt if looking for something on the lighter side while hanging out at the container park bin 702 is great spot!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,5,5,07L5Ab7OY7ufQgfOOe3tMg

For food, we ordered the mini-bin (two gourmet meats and one delicious cheese with warm, toasted bread) and two montaditos (mini-sandwiches) that were not so mini and were absolutely wonderful (the turkey one was just as good as my beloved Cuban, the world's greatest sandwich).

My meats were a truffle salumi and bresaola, my fave! I can't recall the name of the cheese but it was good. The plate included some bread and whole grain mustard. Everything was just perfect. I can't resist whole grain mustard! The salad was bigger than expected and delicious! Avocado was perfect.

Expecting the same amount of selection and service we happily trotted over from ""Glutton"" across the street for a bit of nostalgia and a night cap to end the evening...I wish we wouldn't have. 

 Although it has been a while since we have been there, things have totally changed for the worse.  Small plastic cups for the wine, of which there were actual glasses but we were not offered any.  The Bartender said, ""Oh you wanted glasses? We have them I am just in auto mode giving out the plastic cups for everyone else.""  What???  Hey I get that it is downtown and the ""daiquiri in large funnel crowd"" is just up the street but it was later in the evening on a Tuesday and we are locals.  The wine selection is mediocre at best out of the tap, and they have gone to a much more cocktail and beer focus.  Maybe things weren't selling as well as they liked and they decided to go with what keeps the doors open...again I get that we all have to make a buck, but this place has gone seriously down hill.  The only redeeming factor of the place is that it is near the stage and has an outdoor patio to hang out on.

Bin 702 is a hip place located at container park on Fremont. The place is small inside but also makes up for it by having an awesome outdoor patio with comfortable couches and tables. Defiantly utilized this.

My friend RAVED about the Hot Cheeto Grilled Cheese. The hot cheetos were on top and inside the grilled cheese, which means I HAD to get it. I added avocado to it for something extra. Hands down the BEST grilled cheese I've had in years. I truly mean that. The bread wasn't soggy nor over cooked. Just the right crisp to the sammy. You can easily butcher a grilled cheese sadly and I've had it done to me. 

Perfect amount of cheese on it. Some people are slim with it and some people put so much you can't taste the bread. Well not here, with the ""heat"" of the cheetos this was a great meal. Plus it's served with a really good pickle, who doesn't love a good pickle ;)

The staff there was so chill, didn't bother us and for sure didn't neglect us with their conversations. The happy hour is from 3-6. Small menu with a few draft beers. Easy to make up your mind there. There girls there made an awesome suggestion for my friend and she loved hers too.

I can at about 12:30 on a Saturday night. I wasn't aware before but the container park closes at 1am so they kind of rushed us in and out.

Their beer selection rotates but offers the usual Vegas scene beers with the micros and a couple Tenaya and Big Dog's. Their cocktails weren't all that creative either. They were about $10 and the usual creations. If looking.

I have been there a couple of times just because I happened to be going to the container park for various events. The service really bothers me there. Bartender is not exactly the friendliest or caring. Bartenders are at the forefront of your restaurant. They are supposed to be friendly and accommodating. She is far from that and makes you feel like you bother her. Yet, I decided to look past that.

Last time we were there, I brought in a  group of people, ordered drinks and then sat at tables inside. Be mindful of the following facts:
- The bar/restaurant is inside a container = Small space, limited room to move around
- The purpose of the business is to serve food and drinks to as many customers as possible in order to remain open and generate revenue

Obviously, confined space and lots of customers poses a challenge and should be something that the owners of the place would have to learn to deal with, right?
Nope! My group was rudely reprimanded for talking to each other across tables by who I assume is the manager or/and co-owner. Even though, we were considerate enough to make sure that she could walk by, she got aggravated and threatened us that she would have to force us to move to other seats.
I get it, she needs room to move around, but diplomacy should be in order when you're dealing with a larger group that spent good money on overpriced, low quality and very undersized poured drinks and wines ($10 to $14 for wine, $3 for water, for example). It simply resulted in a change of plan and my whole group moved on to friendlier pastures. 

I am very respectful of people and was taught to be polite, always say thank you and again, be considerate of others. Something that is not standard practice at bin 702.",MKC5kBFwZ3oAX2ZAT-9IVw,1,1,1,9T-MCZly0M3QRIDzoYewNA

I walked in with my 1.5 year old in my arms and asked for a Chardonnay. The bartender (A.G.M. lady with long blond hair with attitude) asked if I minded a wine out of the tap. I said no and she spouted out the Blanc instead of Chard. I didn't mention it. She said $11 for the wine and I said I don't recall last week that it was that much and also I thought I got something out of a bottle for less. Well that kinda hit her nerve then it was all down hill from there. She thought I was calling her out and I  explained maybe it was my baby mind that I was confused since I was holding my 15 month old. Anyways she became cold and basically rude. She touted she was the AGM and then I touted I have been coming here 6 years and I don't remember the wine coming out of the tap. Most likely because I always came with a friend or friends and just payed the bill without noticing the pour or price. I was just trying to make conversation after that but she became irritated and made me feel uncomfortable. Being that she was in a position of management and i was a loyal customer she should have been a little more understanding that the customer was confused possibly and backed down. Obviously she was in a bad mood. After I agreed I would take a half carafe and she would pour 3 glasses for $25 instead of 1 for $11 I took the Blanc even though I ordered Chardonnay not wanting to piss her off anymore then she was. After coming  back in to ask for my 3rd glass of the carafe she rudely told me ""this is your last one"" I kinda laughed and walked out with my daughter. Here I am a local with many places  to spend my money and really  enjoying the Bin  I felt like if I was the Owner I would have told her to find another job right then and there. This is my last time to visit Bin 702 when I can walk 50 ft away to the next bar and get better service without attitude. Thanks A.G.M..im sure if the owners knew that you didn't care about ""their"" customers I'm sure you would have another job.

The accompaniments were great. Crisp bread, olives, house spiced mixed nuts & homemade dried cranberries or raisins. Great honey. Apricot jam. Everything tasted great in different mixes, the cheeses were complimented very well. 

I enjoyed the ambiance and our server was attentive. 

Tried the Dolcetta, tasted fruit-juicey, to me. Too light. Ordered the Cabernet- it was good with the cheese platter. Would love more selection of bold wines, they have a great beer menu, 7 whites and 5 reds to choose from. Maybe due to space concerns? Looking for a big bold wine was my main concern for 4 stars instead of 5. They had a broader white wine menu for those white wine lovers out there. I imagine with Summer around the corner, the red wine menu will stay put.

I can see how it would get crowded quickly here, but we had no problem around 2pm on a weekday.

If it was crowded in bin 702 I wouldn't sit down for a nice little meal and glass of wine, as that is an experience that I want to enjoy without rush.  I would grab a cheaper beer and set off to enjoy the life and sounds at the park. 

All in all, they did a good job, respectable craftsmanship, creative menu and I left happy.  I hope these businesses stay busy, the DCP is a great refuge in Vegas and I hope it thrives.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,2,1,4,voL7EwpzhLrCTxcLc-N-TA

Firstly, the container park idea is cool in itself. Secondly, the server Taryn, who was also the bartender, cook and apparently has a beer in her honor was super sweet. She fulfilled drink orders, including mine, made my sandwich and everything by herself. She was literally the only person working at the time. Awesome. Lastly, but certainly not least, the sandwich. Delicious!!! I'm not really a huge fan of smoked gouda and wish it were a different cheese (maybe Meunster) but honestly, I didn't care. It was good enough. The Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich is absolutely incredible! I was torn between picking this place or Evel pie. I'm not saying Evel pie is bad because I didn't try it, but it would have to be some truly epic pizza to top what I had. I also had a cider beer (Seattle Cider) which was ok but as someone who's tried quite a few cider beers (which I like way better than regular beer now) it wasn't at the top of the list.

The last visit sealed my review because I now realise it is so inconsistent that I would rather not suggest bin 702 if I were to meet a group. if I was with one other person and we were passing and it was not busy then great.

First of all, it is really small, it is in a container so there is not a lot of space inside. The other night it was in the 40's and cold, there were no outside heaters so that was not an option. We went inside and there was a place to sit however both bartenders were with a group of 8, we sat at a table and waited for them to be served. Another group came in, and again both bartenders went to work on their order. It was disappointing not to be acknowledged but to be entirely overlooked, not good.

I have had wine there in the Spring and sat outside it was a complete delight. There were $7 dollar glasses available and that is fair,however the plastic cups are not my favorite and need to go if I am paying $10.

Walking around Container Park one evening, we came upon bin 702. I can't comment on the food though, because we just  stopped by for a drink. At the time, they were offering holiday inspired drinks, including their take on Spiced Cider.

It was also kinda nippy out, so that spiced cider sounded great! The taste as pretty good, but after my first sip, I had a little coughing spell from the kick of cayenne pepper. Man, was it strong! That definitely put the spice in spiced cider!

This quaint little side bar is located inside the infamous Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas.

To accompany your libations, there are montaditos, soups, salads, and charcuterie to enjoy. They smell divine from afar, but I'm certain their charcuterie is not made in-house. 

The unhappy woman server with the lip ring and hooded sweatshirt seems to continue her mundane tasks of cloth-drying the cups as the flies enter the facility because the air curtain is off. Overall, this restaurant seems to not hold up to the standard that their rhetoric actually portrays.

It's 11:35am.

As I stroll through Container Park on a beautiful Halloween weekend morning, eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to permanently scar my body with a nerd alert, I see the sign: hot Jameson mulled apple cider. With no voice and really nothing to lose, I saunter over to bin 702 and do it!

Curiosity gets the best of me with the montaditos (mini wiches). Although the kind server tells me the Cuban is of course very popular, I've had Cuban sandwiches a bit too commonly in order for me to pass up some of the other, more 'exotic' offerings. I choose the bresaola with gorgonzola (ughhhhh such a blue cheese sluuuut) and honey; she chooses the cab mushrooms.

Opting to sit outside and soak in the shaded sunshine, I recognize that bin 702 is indeed a hipster's paradise: craft cocktails, AMAZING beer selection, limited menu surrounding meat and cheese and small charcuterie platters, peppered with interest-piquing artistic expressions and deliberately mismatched outdoor furniture. I love it. I'm too old to give any f's about what is considered ""cool"" by the kids these days. It's comfy, homely, friendly, and now that my order is out, it's also yummy!

Though the sandwiches could use *slightly* more seasoning across the board, WHAT ADORABLE LITTLE FINGER WICHES!!! Smoked gouda is perfection with the mushrooms, and whoever first paired gorgonzola with honey definitely also knows where a woman's g-spot is. And that cider! Truly did help cure my missing voice and sore throat.

I do understand that in Container Park the establishments are made out of shipping containers, giving business owners the challenge of designing with limited room. However, there are many other businesses on property that do a better job of utilizing the small space.

We sat at the bar, and although we were very conscious of the space around us, there was hardly room behind us and the front door for the servers to squeeze through. It was awkward and annoying being continually bombarded by elbows and purses. It was difficult to enjoy ourselves. We ended up giving up on this and getting our drinks to go. Paying $8 for a Brooklyn Lager, I'd like to be able to get away from the foot traffic outside and sit at the bar for more than a couple minutes. 

I found the bartenders and servers to be completely apathetic about the customers. They served us, but I can't quite say whether they were happy or mad about that.

The Venue is geared for 21 older guest (probably because of all the alcohol options) So while my son played in the park with my husband, I decided to venture inside to check out there menu, since I am not much of a Day time drinker I decided on settling on just grabbing a bite to eat.  The inside is pretty small and quaint and very limited on seating, but luckily there is seats outside on their front porch and if that's taken there is more scattered around the area.  What really made me lean on eating here was the menu, I saw a lobster roll as an option, after seeing how big they were and all the other options they had, I wanted to try everything. So I decided on the minis, I choose the Cuban, Lobster and Flaming hot Cheetos.  They were all good, but were to small to enjoy and purchasing the minis meant changing the bread. I think next time I will have to try the actually Paini sandwich and opt for the more intense grilled cheese style.

Right in the center of the container park, it's the perfect place to relax and grab a drink and a delicious little snack. 

Happy Hour is every day 3-6, with $5 beers, $6 spirits and $7 wines. This is the perfect time to come since the weather in Vegas is so nice right now and you can actually enjoy sitting outside.

We also ordered a cheese plate as well as 6 different mini sandwiches (montaditos) for $13.50.  The bread was so good. You can choose whatever 6 or 12 sandwiches you want. We ordered a lobster, the hot cheeto, a Brie and apple, mushroom, Gorgonzola, and a cuban. All delicious and perfect for sharing.

The grilled cheese with flaming hot Cheeto spread is one of my favorites. I was also a big fan of a hot apple cider whiskey thing they had over the winter.  The bartenders have always been sassy but in a fun enlightening way that makes them enjoyable to chat with.

There isn't a lot to be said. The menu is fairly basic and the focus is on premium grilled cheese sandwiches. There are a few other options like salad and cheese and meat boards.

I did a salad, a mini Cuban, and a mini Flamin Hot Cheetos sandwich. Also got a beer. The food was pretty good and our bartender was awesome! She was really nice and seemed fully engaged with every person who comes in.",z6C4omh8GlgJCvQB08PNrA,0,0,4,Fe9sPP_V71qlFIv_DI24rA

5782540,2014-01-31,4,NCR20zyNvXPb3gYpZqAvbQ,"Really? You all love this place THAT much?? Why? Because you want to pretend you're classy and such seasoned 'wine connoisseurs' while you watch 85 strollers walk by? As you eat your overpriced, shitty sandwich inside the steel walls of a glorified outdoor mall, remember that this is where you are: in a glorified, outdoor strip mall on land that used to be pissed and shit on by all the meth addicts who are currently not even allowed inside the premises. Oh, okay. Makes sense then.

This is not a place for locals. Locals cannot afford to spend $14 on a SANDWICH that doesn't come with anything. Come on. I know you're anticipating this place becoming 'hip and happening' but it's not there yet! I guess with prices like these, though, they are striving for only one kind of clientele. 

I ordered and paid $8 for a grilled cheese. Bread, and cheese, heated in probably a toaster over. Hello, I just moved from NEW YORK CITY, and if I were to get a sandwich for $8, I CAN ASSURE YOU, it would be more than just two pieces of bread and some cheese. 

Actually, at the 24-hour deli down the block from my last apartment, here is what I got for $7: sopressata (and a retarded amount of it), provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo, onions, pickles, salt, pepper, oregano, and TOASTED on a HERO ROLL they made there, FRESH, BY THEIR OWN HANDS. any time of day. for $7!! and it's always so damn big that I save half for later cuz - seriously - it's that damn big. This is pretty much a standard anywhere in Brooklyn. I will take a picture next time and edit this post with it.

One would think, at BIN 702, they'd at least put a tomato on it, or some lettuce, or some SPICES??? Or SOMETHING to give it some flavor. Carmelized onions? Hell, I'd even take some raw red onions. Or chopped up raw garlic. Just do something to pizzazz it for THAT price. That would probably cause it to be an extra $5 for those ingredients. I am still in disbelief I paid for this, if you couldn't tell. And this happened a few weeks ago.

(For reference - this is what I can expect for **$7** - IN MANHATTAN, in the LOWER EAST SIDE, one of NYC's most expensive neighborhoods, at a grilled cheese-specific restaurant called, ""Little Muenster.""

THE WORLD'S BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH
Crispy Pork Belly/Soft Omelette/Gruyere/Gouda/Kewpie/Amy's Roll. 

AND BREAD FROM AMY'S. I rest my case.)

If you don't believe me, here is an example: http://littlemuenster.com/menu/

Las Vegas - you will never be NYC. Or San Francisco. Not even Chicago, no matter how hard you try. So please, stop trying with your ""artisanal wine tastings"" and just be your damn self. 

And, if you *DO* want to be like NYC or SF or, hell, even Chicago, start modeling yourself after their politics when it comes to catering to locals.",1Z2EUwsPYln7O_C0ev9n4g,4,1,1,4qBA8SnCWBIOWwWkB8-QzA

5841582,2017-09-06,0,NCR20zyNvXPb3gYpZqAvbQ,"A fantastic little find in Downtown Las Vegas. We were on a whirlwind tour of downtown which had our group of 10 on a hop of bars, restaurants, casinos and museums on Saturday afternoon/night. We started at Atomic Liquors for drinks, proceeded to Bin 702 in the Container Park, then the El Cortez, and culminating with a nighttime tour of the Las Vegas Neon Museum boneyard. So, Bin 702. A local--a waiter in one of our breakfast joints--recommended we try something in the Downtown Container Park. Everybody in our group was willing to try something different, and Bin 702 was not a conventional restaurant. I contacted them to see if they could accommodate our large-ish party, and Taryn quickly returned my email request to say they could accommodate us. Bin 702 is located in two connected shipping containers. The menu consists of small plates options, charcuteries and cheese boards, and montaditos (mini sandwiches). We had a fantastic variety of each as well as an excellent selection of craft beers and inventive cocktails. We started with two charcuterie boards which offered 4 meats, and two cheese boards, offering 4 cheeses. The menu described these boards as such: ""Artisan cheese and curated meat beautifully presented. All served with fig jam, honeycomb, whole grain mustard, olives, almonds and dried cherries."" Forgive me for not remembering the specific meats and cheeses on these boards, suffice it to say EVERYTHING was delectable, especially when paired with the fig jam and mustard! Next we split three montaditos samplers which included the following: Flamin' Hot Cheeto - house spread, white cheddar; Bresaola - St. André, Brie - Apple, almond, honey; Turkey - Fig jam, smoked gouda; Sopressata - whole grain mustard; and Lobster. The Turkey and Brie were so good we ordered another serving of 6 sandwiches of just those two options. Everything was prepared with care and wonderfully presented. Speaking of my drink option, I had the local craft brew, Big Dog Las Vegas Lager, which paired really well with all of the food I ate. As if the food and drink were not enough, our server, Naomi was FANTASTIC, happily engaging with our group throughout the evening. I'd recommend Bin 702 based on the food alone, but I heartily recommend Bin 702 for its atmosphere as well. In all, a wonderful experience. I'd definitely return when I'm next in Las Vegas.",cdg72MCLRH3tertErCusJA,0,0,4,NwggkwfyhZfAbRkWUwzBVQ

The line at the bar kept getting longer, so this was welcome! 

I loved the charcuterie, it was a large portion and had a great variety to sample! The cheese was very good, and I'd recommend this to share with a few others. The lobster sandwich was OK, it really had too much other stuff that overpowers the lobster. There are quite a few other types of sandwiches to choose from as well. As the name Container Park implies, the restaurant is smallish. Although, there was more room inside than I had imagined.

I love lobster sandwiches, so I went to this place induced by some good reviews about their lobster sandwich.  Not only their lobster sandwich was terrible, but so was the attitude of one of the servers, a lady with one of the sides of her hair shaved.  Although the lobster portion was generous, the lobster was cold, totally tasteless, and bad quality bread. I had read the sandwich came with Greek salad.  The so called ""salad"" was just a few pieces of cheap lettuce, without dressing, without nothing.  They carry no Coke or Pepsi, in fact, when I ordered my soda, one of the servers told me that Coke was not good for me.  Since when does a server have to be critical of a customer's beverage preference?   Then they wanted to sell me a Cola, a brand I had never seen before.  I ended up having a glass of water.

On the menu the lobster sandwich was $12, but they charged me $15.  After I disputed the charge, the same lady that criticized my Coke drinking habit refunded me not without adding more inappropriate comments.  She needs to learn the basics of customer service and business etiquette working at a food place.  First and last visit.",avis77imGr5t1EyCdppxUQ,2,1,1,4BSySBDTOujmL22MhYTLwQ
