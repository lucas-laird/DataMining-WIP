The staff is friendly and helpful. Grilled peppers and onions are spicy but oh so good. Went there twice and it was a great experience both times.",hQ_XC3ZUeS0BzmKWyQMAmg,0,0,5,85POXKkJSzIO2DflU2OP1g

I was a bit concerned dining here midweek around 6:30pm and being the only person in the joint. The ambiance is pretty nice for a taco shop. Very clean, very new - it used to be a Jersey Mikes Subs which usually has decent decor. 

I took advantage of their $.99 bean & cheese burrito special and it was definitely good. My wife had the enchilada w/ rice & beans and that was below average. I'd definitely give Rosa's another shot, specifically for the burrito (which btw, was huge) but definitely concerned that we were the only people in there before eating, during eating, and after eating. In Spanish they would say that's no bueno.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,2,1,3,f59AbC7Cch8wvi-lXkMbsQ

My husband loved his tacos!  He said he will be back, and he can't wait to try her burritios!

I got the rolled taco's and they reminded me of my childhood. It tasted like the shells were made from scratch.  The meat was a little to chunky, but other than that I really enjoyed the tacos.  The rice was pretty good too.  I'm sure I will be back.",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,0,0,4,rQiwNvT_iK9gqDfNn51Dng

Delicious!! And it was a healthy portion. Torta bread, which ruins a lot of Torta sandwiches if not good, was warm, soft, toasted, and moist. I would definitely eat again and recommend for anyone looking to have a good Torta.",LExKqFQSCV989IhHr08z8g,0,0,4,hW3I7gANrH4J6iMjrPfNNw
