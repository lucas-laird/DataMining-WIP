Going to miss Long John Silvers and A&W in Las Vegas. No more locations :(. They shut down a whole bunch of Long John Silver's across the country and no reason has been given.

Does anyone know why? 


Always enjoyed going there. Shame that it has to go and will not longer be in Vegas.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,1,0,5,MfZmc_FRD5FMTb4JNwmcOw

Whatever; I ordered my L1 combo: 2fish/6shrimp.  Proceed over to get my beverage.  The condiment stand was filthy, the cocktail sauce pump and napkin dispensers were removed, leaving large holes.  The soda machine was out of diet root beer.  This is an A&W/mixed use venue...root beer is their trademark!  It was orange coming out and tasted like the orange soda.  I informed the cashier as he was handing me my order.  He said ""no, it's just out"".  So since I absolutely hate and cringe over diet Pepsi (the worst flavor in the world) I asked for some sweet & low packets for some fresh brewed iced tea...even pointing at the tea urns on the front counter.  He returns with Sweet & Sour packets.  I had to explain that I wanted the small pink paper packets of sugar-free sugar to sweeten up iced tea.  He responded with ""OH, yeah, sorry, we're out of that too"".  Upon seating at my table I noticed that my plate only had 1 piece of fish and the 6 shrimp.  Honestly, at this point I didn't even go back up since the math of counting up to 2 must be eluding them.  This was just a terrible visit.  I have been here several times before...never had a ""great"" visit...they are either mediocre or something such as this (this is my 3rd terrible encounter).",naZhgyS1OJFvHhGUYQh9fQ,0,0,1,VZn-EoFiZsPIgCStNvS2CQ
1588363,2014-03-29,3,4V_EncSagOpI_0IuS7vURw,"Ordered the cheese curds ($2) and the five piece dipping fish strips ($3) and somehow got a total of $7 with no explanation- and, after a ten minute wait during 5:00 rush, NO SAUCES with my order. 
That's right: no ketchup, no tartar sauce, nothing. 
All of this while the manager was standing by the register watching his staff working and chatting with them, but obviously not helping or correcting their mistakes.

Ate the curds and hated myself for it- they were super greasy and half of them were more crunch than cheese. Tried to eat a strip without any dipping sauces (seriously, how did NO ONE in the kitchen notice this?!), and gave up, tossing the order.

Never again. Grab chicken strips next door at Cain's, they have their act together even at midnight. And their sauce is delish.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,1,1,EEPOyqns8TAr3gwXlBiexg
1901034,2015-07-01,0,4V_EncSagOpI_0IuS7vURw,The sewer smell can make you lose your appetite but the food and people are great. I came first thing they open and where I am sitting my daughter saw a cock roach and the flour was not swept from the night before. It's a great location but it looks like night crew are not cleaning up to well.,ukzNe3_mibAD89zvEp_vrw,0,0,3,s5k31ytYv894fc_BZpFSGw
1911754,2014-03-09,0,4V_EncSagOpI_0IuS7vURw,"What are the chances of getting my money back?  I wanted to try your restaurant out for the first time. I had the 2 fish, 6 shrimp platter with rice. And the lobster bites. The lobster bites, fish, and shrimp were bland and greasy.  My fingers were literary greasy after picking up the food. The rice had zero flavor. The hush puppies were the most disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth. Whatever fake butter that is used is horrible. It tasted like they were soaked in butter and then fried. The tarter sauce is sweet and the cocktail sauce has no kick to it. About 10 min after I had a few bites of each thing I literally vomited from all the grease and fake butter. I'm not sure why anyone would actually continue to eat this food. I would love to get my hard earned money back!",ujjfKh6HrLSXIbOcdywxaA,1,0,1,sj5bEZIuhoAZs2OIpAHKCQ
2268711,2013-10-24,0,4V_EncSagOpI_0IuS7vURw,"Typical Long John Silver's fried chicken and seafood, but since it's attached to A&W, you can also get some root beer while you're here. Everything is fried in the LJS batter including the onion rings, which made them a little too salty for my taste. Service is fast here and my order was ready before I could finish filling up my drink. Only real downside was that a hobo walked in while I was there, asked for a drink cup and sat down mumbling to himself and sleeping at a booth...not sure why this was tolerated by the staff or allowed.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,3,klW56Prhc9ZmsbHZzIm31Q

2519923,2014-04-02,0,4V_EncSagOpI_0IuS7vURw,The fish is decent but the inside is very dirty and disgusting. When you come go drive thru and eat in the car it will be much better due to how dirty the place is. I will never eat inside again.

The inside isn't that clean and the staff isn't very professional. The food from here is fresh most of the time, however you can sometimes taste the old grease. They need to change that stuff occasionally.",U_xPSiusfTDi4QALaTr2uQ,0,0,3,qvs9TwWJs-fKW-OZdzohHA

Some of the items on the menu are ok, but most of time I leave disappointed. They do have a jukebox and lots of comfy boothes but its still fast food & its fish & burgers. Not the best but if your intoxicated it'll do.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,4,4,2,mZb9EN1-K4QL4j7xERm4xw

The dining room is dirty and there's no napkins or lids for the drinks.  The only way this place is open it's because the food is good the rest of the staff is lousy the dining room is lousy and everything else is dirty!,bnKo6L4MgcUbLZH7fmnkrA,0,0,2,_NarXWKNmuKFelOB1ngxTQ
5772531,2012-10-15,0,4V_EncSagOpI_0IuS7vURw,"My husband & I placed an order at the drive up window at Long John Silvers / A & W at 732 N Nellis Blvd.  We had to repeat the order over and over.  Jennifer finally said just drive up to the window which we did.  We ordered a large root beer freeze, an oreo swirl & onion rings. She kept asking us how many hush puppies we wanted.  We would tell her ""no hush puppies"" and she would say ""WHAT""  We gave her our order three times.  When she handed us the polar swirl, the cup was 2/3 full with a large swirl hole in the middle.  My husband showed this to her and asked her to fill the cup up.  She said that is the amount we were suppose to get,  that usuall they are in a small glass mug.  We asked her if they gave glass mugs away at the drive thru, she kept saying, ""WHAT""  We finally gave up and drove home.  I called the number on the ticket and asked to speak to the manager, after a pause a woman answered and said, ""this is Jennifer.""  It's hard to believe such an incompetent  employee would be able to keep a job let alone be a manager. I'm doubtful anything will be done concerning this until enough customers complain.",xqYpVi1CqGKLGyv7Ez1ZyA,0,0,1,AhL3eX4rKURlzFptAeJw4Q
