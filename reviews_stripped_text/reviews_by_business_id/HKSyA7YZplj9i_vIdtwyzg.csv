I drove all the way back & got no apology and was told to wait in the drive through line again. Which took another 15 minutes. Never coming back. I'd rather drive to Henderson to get good service.

Today was simply sloppily, hurried work. No excuses for it. My Big Mac was put together wrong, the bottom bun was in the middle, the middle was on the bottom.  Which meant the whole thing was a mess to eat. At first I thought the bun had been flipped over but after a few slippery bites I learned differently. It was an over sauced disaster. Maybe an afternoon of re-training is necessary for the entire store. The sweet tea was sour AGAIN and there was so little ice it barely qualified as ice tea.

There are 3 of them.  They are:

1. Manager GIA!
2. Manager GIA!
3. Manager GIA!

I had a very minor problem on May 8, 2018 with my drive-thru order, so I came back on May 9, 2018 to mention it and get it corrected.

Ms. GIA came out to my car (I'm crippled-up a bit),  I explained what happened and she went WAY ""above & beyond"" to apologize for the error, and guaranteed that in the future, I will go ONLY to her place, if I'm anywhere in the Las Vegas Valley.

Not only THAT, but WHEN I win the lottery, I will definitely share some of it with HER, and that is NO JOKE!

What makes me a customer-for-life is NOT the food or the prices:  It is the staff (like GIA) and as long as she works there, I will be a frequent visitor.

BET ON IT!
