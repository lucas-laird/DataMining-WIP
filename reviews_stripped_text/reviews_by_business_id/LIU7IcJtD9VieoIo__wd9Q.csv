867189,2015-05-24,0,LIU7IcJtD9VieoIo__wd9Q,"First off, this place defines the phrase ""hole in the wall"". There are only 3 tables with 2 chairs each, so it's mostly for takeout. We ate there and the service was fine although the TV on what appeared to be an endless loop travelogue for Morocco was strange.

Now for the food, which is what we really care about, right? In a word, awesome.

 We had Pad Kee Mao with chicken, which is a standard for me. Even though we ordered it medium it was still pretty spicy. But perfectly executed with lots of veggies which was a bonus. And under the ""Vegetables"" section we got the dish called Tarzan. It was described as a list of veggies in a green curry. We ordered that medium too but it wasn't spicy at all. It was chock full of vegetables beautifully prepared and the green curry broth was light and flavorful which was super because I feared it might be heavy and thick. Served with steamed rice, we didn't even miss meat.

The only clunker was the scallion pancake appetizer. We ordered it because I had never seen it on a Thai menu before. It was more deep fried than the scallion pancakes I have had at Chinese Restaurants. It was served with peanut sauce, which was it's only saving grace, because let's face it, I could eat a napkin if it had enough peanut sauce. Wouldn't order it again but it also wouldn't keep me from eating there again because the rest of the food was phenomenal and while the pancake was fine, it just wasn't my cup of tea.

The portion sizes were generous, we were both full when we left and we have enough leftover for lunch today. (I call dibs!) and the price for everything was just $22.

So if you want great Thai at great prices, order Thai Pan. They will be my new go to takeout!",CjTgCaIc__WF6MoPGCbQqA,1,0,5,ty9KLNCx9CDnRDcRuI7d6w

I just ""discovered"" this place while heading towards ""home"" down Alta. 

I grabbed a carryout of Red Curry and Pad Ka Pharo. Those who know me know I can eat my weight in rice noodles so I'm not sure why I didn't choose two noodle selections. Oh well that's next time!

I asked for medium spice and I personally think it was mild. Maybe they held back? 

The Red Curry was flavorful and had tons of veggies thanks to the veggie option I chose. The spicy basil was good but I would like it even spicier :) the tofu was cut into the right size too. Very vegan and veggie friendly place. They even offer almond milk for their drinks.

Both my selections were from the Lunch menu and came with a sesame oil dressing salad and a fried ?spring roll? Both I personally don't care for so I will just order from the regular menu next time. But if you like those items, get the lunch option because it's a ton of food for the low price. 

I will be back!

A terrific family-run place, the service is friendly, as well as helpful in suggesting items to eat. They can also adjust the spiciness to your desired level.

Of particular note is their papaya salad. Every Thai place has a papaya salad, but not every place gets it right. Flavorful, tart, spicy and fresh, it's an indicator of the great food to come later in your meal.

Space is more modern and welcoming, menu has traditional rice, noodle, and soup staples along with specialties like khao soi- which is what I went in for, as it's an amazing  dish only available a couple places in town.

Soup was pretty good, with a rich and slightly spicy broth and a hard boiled egg, topped with crispy noodles and an entire chicken leg. I paired this with the curry puffs from my last visit and was happy to see they're still awesome. This is a meal I'd totally come back for, but I wouldn't do it during lunch hours- small space is packed and the kitchen and staff were clearly overwhelmed, and the half-hour wait for food is a bit much for a lunch break visit.

I consulted Kara, who was very sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. (Oh and found out after that her parents run the place and cooked my food! Support local family restaurants?? Absolutely!!!) I ordered a Northern Thai style papaya salad which was sweeter, pleasantly funky and loaded with vegetables. I had to try their tom kah koong, and that soup was the best I've had in Vegas.

We got curry puffs, pad Thai, green curry, and spicy green beans with chicken.

I think they put pork in our green beans instead of chicken...no bother, we eat everything! They were seasoned with tom yum koong paste I think. Super good but a little weird...

The curry puffs were good...like Thai samosas in a flakier dough.

The pad Thai was good but I'm never truly impressed with pad Thai.

Green curry here was good to me. Hubby says it needs to be sweeter for him but I'm not a sweet curry person.

The rice served with everything was on the dry side :(

Not sure I would come here again bc of all the bomb places to eat in Vegas but we were starving after our car ride and it did its job.

The green onions crisp amd with a taste good enough to let you know they were fresh; the bean sprouts juicy and the stringed carrots too.

2095995,2017-02-21,0,LIU7IcJtD9VieoIo__wd9Q,"First of all, STOP reading this review and GET IN YOUR CAR NOW and drive to this incredible little restaurant.  Do it NOW, or at least between the hours of 11 am and 10 pm, Monday - Saturday.

I absolutely adore Thai food and Hubby adores me, so he's game to eat Thai now and then.  My adoration stems from the delicious Thai food I was accustomed to eating in upstate NY, where I lived before I moved to Vegas 2 years ago, and I've been quite disappointed in most of the Thai food here in Vegas due to the lack of authentic flavor, the steep price, or a combo of both of these.  Hubby also is quite hesitant to go for Thai as much as I would like because of these reasons.  Well, gentle readers, these reasons were all completely blown out of the water tonight by this delightful hole-in-the-wall!

I foolishly didn't take any photos of all the delicious dishes we tried because I was too busy happily stuffing my face, but I am including pics of the menu.  You can find all your classic Thai favorites along with chef specialties that neither of us has ever heard of but can't wait to try in the future!

This is a very small family-run establishment with Dad and Auntie cooking in the kitchen and the son Bank (so sorry if I'm butchering the spelling) serving us tonight.  He was incredibly delightful and friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed his helpful suggestions and descriptions of every dish.

We started with 2 Thai iced teas (both free with our Yelp check-ins!), a large Tom Yum Soup with shrimp (enough to feed 4 people since we each ate 2 full bowls), and the Chicken Satay.  The homemade peanut sauce and sweet pickles accompanying the satay were exactly as I recall from NY and the chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked.

Next, we had the Thai-style Papaya Salad medium spicy (I added a bit of extra chili oil to mine to make it a bit hotter like I prefer), which was, of course, perfect.  I really enjoyed the addition of yellow cherry tomatoes to the usual large, sliced red tomatoes and felt the extra color added a beautiful visual touch to an already delicious dish.

For entrees, we ordered the Jungle Curry with chicken and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice.  

The Jungle Curry is the only curry they make without coconut milk, but, trust me, the complexity of spices that are used is an absolute symphony in your mouth!   The small springs of young white peppercorns in the dish add a particular perfume of flavor and I really enjoyed separating the little peppercorns off the sprig and distributing them throughout the serving on my plate so each mouthful was perfectly delightful.  The Curry was also chock full of various veggies; the Thai eggplant was particularly enjoyable.

The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was easily one of the best we've ever had and we eat tons of Asian food all over the country.  The BBQ pork was legit the BEST: large slices of perfectly juicy and sweet meat.  The dish was also packed with delicious veggies.

Our intention was to only eat half the food, but it was so delicious that we ate about 3/4 of it and were forced to order the Panang Curry with chicken to-go (yeah, yeah poor pitifully gluttonous us!) so we would have enough leftovers to feed us tomorrow for lunch.

We were already completely stuffed from everything we'd so thoroughly enjoyed, but when I saw Mango Sticky Rice on the menu (one of my all-time fav Thai desserts), I couldn't resist.....Hot, sweet with the perfect hint salty, coconuty, buttery, ricey goodness with juicy ripe slices of fresh mango....you are everything I remember and more!  Shockingly, this was Hubby's first time with this dessert, but it certainly won't be his last!

I think I've probably exhausted my positive food adjectives at this point, but I'm just so thrilled to have FINALLY found a place to satisfy my Thai cravings without breaking the bank!  SEVEN different dishes were only a total of $55.70 plus tax!

I'm almost hesitant to write this review because I'm afraid the intimacy and at-home sense of hospitality of this place will be ruined when they are forced to move to a larger location when Vegas discovers what an incredible gem they have here, but this family deserves every shred success they will no doubt gain!

The Cream Cheese wontons and Pad Thai were very bland though. The CC Wontons didn't have scallions, and I'm pretty certain didn't have seasonings or Worcestershire sauce. It was really just the cream cheese. So they were very bland. The pad Thai was even more disappointing, I tried putting lemon, chili paste and soy sauce in it, but it just wasn't the same as a nice flavorful pad thai. I never think of Thai food as bland, but this really was. If I had been in the restaurant, I would have sent it back. So far I think Sun's Thai is my favorite.",0CiUNjNlq4EfycFBxLN5IA,0,0,2,29bKaMa7XIDX8lJLapu50Q

Their restaurant is super tiny, only four tables inside.  I like the restaurant sign behind the register.

We knew it was going to be good when we came in and saw Thai customers at the tables, Thai people coming and going, and a very pretty Thai waitress who had all the manners and graciousness of a fancy place in this family restaurant.

Its not big, pretty, or decorated much. Its the kind of place you might eat at if you were walking through a market district in Thailand, only very clean yet simple and all about the food.

The restroom is in the back, I suggest using it even if you don't need to. Why? Because as this is a family down-home kind of place you walk to it by going through the kitchen. You'll see people making everything by hand, the way it should be. Vegetables being chopped, meats grilling, noodles being made. It was all very authentic. The kitchen staff was friendly and I got the feeling I could have walked up to any of them and asked them to show me what they were doing and they would have been happy to do so. I regret not doing that and when we go back next time I will!

Our waitress had the traditional Thai meekness yet friendly and helpful. Each engagement with her ended in a slight bow. She was polite and friendly. being young it was also fun to watch an young Thai teenager, or maybe in his early twenties flirt with her and both were cute and bashful about it yet she was never unprofessional.

Yes this is a  whole in the wall in a less than nice neighborhood of not particular value or attraction. I gave it a high rating for its authenticity, friendliness, and low price for really good food.

Once we got home, we were surprised at how big their portions were. The tom yum soup is absolutely great. We loved that it was more sour than sweet like it's supposed to be. Both the pad Thai and pad see ew had a perfect balance of sauce. It wasn't too saucy or bland.

Yes like other yelpers said it's easily missed from the road & very small inside with only 4 small tables but sometimes its this type of restaurant that ends up being the yummiest! Luckily we were the only ones dining however no sooner a family came in with loud kids & a crying baby & it was at that very moment that being in a tiny restaurant like this totally sucked! Anyways on to the food..... My Shrimp Pad Thai that I was so eager to try was not very exciting. They forgot to put peanuts which was fine with me as I only really use a little of it. The waitress noticed & asked me if I wanted peanuts added but that was half way through our meal already. The dish lacked the orange/red coloring that you would expect the dish to have. This normally flavorful dish wasn't very flavorful. Ok on to what I became very excited for when I spotted it on  the menu -Mango Curry!!! I love Mango therefore I wanted this dish. It came and I instantly tasted the broth. Meh. It was very soupy, not thick at all & lacked that sweetness that you would expect from a Thai Curry. I sent that dish back because I thought by adding some coconut milk it would improve the dish. Well it did somewhat, the waitress told me that if I wanted it sweeter they could add sugar. Nah, I'm good. I was also disappointed by the amount of Mango or lack there of. Come on guys, be skimpy with your shrimp or steak but Mango? Load up on the Mango it doesnt cost that much. I'm also am very particular with my rice. After 2 bites of the rice & having the 3rd bite be a clump of hard rice I could go on no longer. The rice didnt taste fresh at all. In the appetizers platter the egg rolls were so tiny and fried extra hard that you couldn't even enjoy the filling of the egg roll. People do seem to like this place, maybe it was an off night for them- But whatever it was I was not impressed one bit especially with having to drive 25 minutes to get there.

4146999,2018-04-06,2,LIU7IcJtD9VieoIo__wd9Q,"A new job means new food options to check out for lunch. I stumbled upon Thai Pan on Google Maps and saw it was close to the office. I wasnt too sure about the area of Decatur and Alta. I was even less sure about the restaurant when I saw the outside. But once I walked in I realized everything was A-OK. 

Thai Pan is a tiny place. A little hole in the wall that seats, by my count, 18 people. It is simply decorated but classy. I was told to sit any where and was brought a menu almost immediately. I had already taken a look at the menu online so I knew what I wanted ahead of time. I went with pad see ew which is on the lunch menu (rare to see in my experience).

For $6.95 I got a small salad with a sesame dressing, a veggie spring roll, and my pad see ew entree. It all came out fast starting with the salad. The hot food came out scorching hot. The spring roll was ridiculously crispy and burned my tongue. It looked to be on the verge of being burnt but was not. The noodles were hot also. And kind if spicy (I ordered medium spice). There was a good amount of chicken, lots of egg, and two kinds of broccoli. It was a healthy portion and left me feeling satisfied and just ever so slightly full. 

When I was finished with my meal the histess came by to take my plate. But then it took nearly 10 minutes to get my bill. I dont know why she kept looking at me but not letting me check out. But she did finally bring my bill and I gave her my debit card to run. Then came the bad news. They have a $15 purchase minimum to run a card. I didnt have the cash to cover so she said she would have to charge an extra $1 to run the card. Fine. What choice did I have? She took my card back to the register and came back asking if this was my first visit. I said it was so she waived the $1 fee since I was unaware. That was sweet of her. I appreciate that kind of service. I don't very much like when places have minimums like this but for the to work with me like they did goes a long way. I enjoyed my meal and the small setting so I have every intention of coming back.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,4,2,4,Qcmh1V_nqiTQEDDK0EJjKQ

The Thai tea @ $2.00 is authentic and sweet, perfect to reset your pallet during your meal (free Thai tea when you order over $20 to go). The mango sticky rice was a perfect end to a perfect meal. Nice and warm with fresh mangoes.

It can be a little hard to find, so I seek it out when I travel, and the version I had here last night might have been the best I've ever had, anywhere.

I got it with seafood ($12), and it came with fish (cod?), mussels, shrimp, squid, and fake crab. There was a hearty assortment of vegetables, as is the norm, and the broth was exceptional! It's a good thing it was a spicy as it was, otherwise I would've eaten it way too quickly.

It's not in an upscale neighborhood, and we were actually accosted by a vagrant who was loitering in the Walgreens parking lot next door.  The place is cozy (tiny), not flashy, and as a result isn't prentnetious or annoyingly austantatious. 

We started with the curry puffs.  That was a great decision.  Crispy, well seasoned, and with some peanut sauce, freaking outstanding.  We also split the pad see yu, and chicken curry, both did not disappoint.  My friend and I are hefty Midwesterners, and sharing an appetizer and two entrees we were stuffed to the gills, which means that averaged sized people can probably cut out an entree.

Took about 10 minutes, and when I took it home was floored by how heavy the to go boxes were. very good amount of food for the price. Also got one of the drinks in the cooler, only 1$ for orange juice. It ended up being 20$ for both entrees and the drink.

It's definitely a bit hidden and only seats about 15 people, don't let this stop you from trying it.  It's a family ran business.  Cara is super sweet and always remembers my family and all of our ""special"" requests.  To get to the restroom you need to walk through the kitchen which I like because you get to see just how clean and fresh everything is.  Plus they are always super friendly with us and our huge family!

On to the food... The papaya salad is the best in town!  My kids who are super picky eaters and don't like to try new things have been converted as well.  They love their fried rice dishes.  Our go to's are the fried rice, pad Thai, appetizer sampler, spring rolls, papaya salad, basil chicken, and Tom yum soup... oh and if you dine in you must try their crispy banana w/ice cream dessert.

Enjoy!!!",sNwSq3avy-4bfLJrmPs1kw,0,0,5,GR1bnfwsjCmw4Qk043btpw

My husband just paid 27 dollars for a fried rice, wonton soup and a beef and broccoli. The container the beef and broccoli came in is so small that it looks like a kids menu entree. They should really start changing prices. Or at least give you what you payed for.  I don't think I will be coming back which is a shame",zyYbxZi5ptX3PZegTRwyRg,0,0,2,UBoQP5hZ5iu-iYqSy9KExQ

The food is reasonably priced and really flavorful, but not overly salty or oily! I loved the chicken pad see yew and my boyfriend loved the thai fried rice with chicken. We got mango and sticky rice for dessert and that was soon good.

Service was also really great here too! The waiter (I forgot his name sadly :( ) is really nice and attentive. He's actually from my hometown!

Their Tom Ka soup is to die for, and their mango curry is pretty good although it tasted a bit bland for what it was. They have an extensive menu, so I am sure you can find something you like. 

I gave it 4 stars because of the service. Although the server was attentive, she seemed a bit uninterested in checking in with us and refilling our drinks often. Being the only table there, I thought we would get a bit more/better service.

Kara was a sweetheart that served us with a smile that the Thai folks are known for. I helped translate for Chinese tourists and Bank the owner came to personally thank me.
