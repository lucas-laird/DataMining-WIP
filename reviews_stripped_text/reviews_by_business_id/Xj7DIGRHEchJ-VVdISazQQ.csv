The service is always on par and the everything on the menu is great but I'm a creature of habit. If there was a negative on this place it's that it's a tad on the expensive side.

29080,2012-11-22,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I love mexican food. I also love good prices and good quality (home made flavour) so this review is based in my perspective.....

We made reservations (for two) got there on time, we were seated rigth away.
Waiters were all friendly and fast.

Food was good i got the carnitas its served with rice, beans,salsa,tortillas,guacamole. Since its a fancy restaurant ($$) u get ur plate n everything is looking cute,pretty n smaller proportion, (im more the type of big portions served all over the plate lol)  
Taste: carnitas were soft n moist, falling off the bone. Beans tasted homemade. Guacamole was good. Salsa was ok. 

So we asked for the house spicier salsa if they had one n they did! and i mean spicy homemade salsa, (u only get it if u order it)  it was really good habanero salsa, do not order unless u like it super spicy .... otherwise stick with :it says hot in the bottle but its really not : cholula.

Javiers margarita was 15 bucks, pricey for a drink.... It was ok 

Dessert: fried icecream, it was vanilla icecream on top of a mexican bunuelo  ( fried dough with cinammon n sugar) it was tasty.

Restaurant itself: this was the reason why we decide to dine here, the decor looks so cool n unique, comfy chairs.

So overall food is good - no complaints there, but pricey. It was round 100 bucks for our dinner, kinda pricey for me,  but if you like mexican food, good service and fancy ambient come here.",YuUAyQ-wNrW5z4wrU_QwvQ,0,0,3,apXPcmaNwKIlKBC7f8PjWw

AJ, our server was terrible. Nowhere to be found. Only came when someone else had to tell him that I was not happy with the food.

We were so excited to get the full flavor one typically associates with carne asada with a traditional steak....well forgive the Vegas pun, no dice. See what I did there? 

I ordered medium well, both steaks came out bloody, as in medium rare. We had waited almost an hour, I wasn't about to send it back and wait even longer. This is a 50 dollar meal per person for an improperly prepared, tough, flavorless steak. I have had much better prepared and flavorful steaks from outback. 

Side note to the servers, give a steak knife when serving steak. This way when you serve tough steaks, your patrons fingers won't hurt when trying to cut their food. 

Had the food been incredible, I would have said well worth the money. Food sucked, service not that much better. I would AVOID!",340xX1QyXpoSDcR4ab1Wmg,5,0,1,7QrvPFn-29uUYfkFqjxi5w

I ordered the seafood plate with a  little of everything.  It had an enchilada, a fish taco & a chili relleno.  It was a lot of food, but we all managed to finish.  I also ordered one of the specialty martini's.  It was pretty good, but I hadn't realized it was $17!  That's the most I've ever paid for a drink, ever!

The seafood inside the enchilada and the stuffed pepper was so overcooked it was rubber.  However, there was a seafood taco that came with my meal that was delicious.  Someone else in our party ordered the tabli, which is a large butcher block full of different kinds of meat.  The beef was delicious; however the pork and chicken were both very dry, tough and hard to eat.  The refried beans were absolutely disgusting and inedible.  I don't understand how this restaurant can get beans wrong.  

Unbeknownst to me, my husband ordered bottled waters for the table.  I made a comment that it tasted like the tap water at our home, and he told it was bottled.  BEWARE!  The bottled waters they brought were bottles that were being refilled from a tap.  They were not labeled and were not opened in front of us (I'm sure that's because they are reusing the bottles).  The small bottles were 10$ each!  I don't know exactly what they are doing, but I highly suspect that it's some sort of scam.  I asked the waiter to bring me regular water so that I could see the difference, and the regular water actually tasted better!  hmmmmm.....

The music was so loud that it is very difficult to have a conversation with someone accross the table.  Definitely not the place for a date.  It was my daughter's last night before she left back for college and it was extremely frustrating not to be able to have a nice conversation over our last meal together.

There were 4 of us, had a Sunday 7pm reservation before a show. We were greeted & seated promptly. Great atmosphere, very busy & good music too.

Immediately had chips (yes, they are THE best) & salsa & our drink order taken: Cucumber, Tamarindo, Jalapeño Margaritas. All delicious, I tried them all. With a very generous amount of tequila in each one. 

We shared: Ceviche de pescado, Carnitas, Cabo Azul & Carne Tampiquena. Plenty of food for the 4 of us, plus a little left over. 

Everything tasted fresh & absolutely delicious. I also noticed that nothing was greasy & prepared with only the finest ingredients.

For dessert we had 1 of each of the offered desserts: fried ice cream & FLAN. I am a HUGE fan of Flan and order it every chance I get, but sometimes I'm disappointed. Not at Javier's, it was THE BEST FLAN I've ever had: not too sweet & the consistency was perfect!

Chris was one of our waiters, made us feel at home. The hospitality & service was out of this world AMAZING!

So if you're looking for a $6 burrito this is NOT the place for you. If you are looking for FINE MEXICAN Food that will be worth every penny, JAVIER'S is it!

508739,2013-01-02,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Zentral auf der Casino-Ebene liegt das offene Javier's-Restaurant. Eines von diversen Restaurants im Aria (http://www.qype.com/place/1621121-Aria-Hotel-Casino-Las-Vegas) Hotel. Als mexikanisches Restaurant bringt es eine südkalifornische Atmosphäre nach Las Vegas. Und das mexikanische Ambiente hat man hier perfekt getroffen.
Das Javier's ist erst vor kurzem eröffnet worden. Bevor wir es getestet haben, waren wir schon mehrfach daran vorbei gegangen und hatten interessiert in das offene Restaurant geblickt. Es sprach uns sofort an. Essen gehen in Las Vegas wird leicht zum finanziellen Risiko, vor allem in den Restaurants der Fünf-Sterne-Hotels. Die mexikanische Küche gibt jedoch Gelegenheit, durch geschickte Bestellung den Geldbeutel bzw. die Kreditkarte ein wenig zu schonen.
Im Javier's wird authentische mexikanische Küche geboten. Das schließt Fisch, Rind, Schwein, Huhn und vegetarische Gerichte ein. Eingebettet ist das alles in einem architektonischen Stil, der der Azteken-Zivilisation nachempfunden ist. Gelungen!
Im Süden der USA gibt es viele Einwanderer aus Mexiko. Spanisch ist daher ein recht geläufige Sprache in dieser Region. Im Javier's ist ein Großteil des Personals südlicher Abstammung und wir konnten uns den ganzen Abend mit unserem Ober Raul auf spanisch unterhalten. Er fand es großartig, dass Deutsche seiner Muttersprache mächtig waren und überschüttete uns mit Komplimenten, Ansprachen, Empfehlungen  ein Wortschwall folgte dem anderen. Das war uns dann doch etwas zu viel der ansonsten gepriesenen amerikanischen Servicekultur.
Grundsätzlich ist das Javier's hochpreisig. Da es aber die mexikanische Küche erlaubt, Fingerfood und kleine Gerichte zu kombinieren, kann man gut und reichlich essen und trotzdem nicht das Gefühl haben, über Gebühr finanziell strapaziert zu werden. 
Trinken tut man am besten ein Bier, das ist nicht nur günstig im Vergleich zu den teuren Weinen, es schmeckt auch und die Auswahl an Marken ist immens. Traditionsbewusst wählten wir ein mexikanisches Bier. Perfekt gekühlt, ohne eiskalt zu sein, wie ansonsten oft in den Staaten.
Tequilas gibt es dutzende verschiedene Marken. Hochwertige Sorten, die selten zu bekommen sind. Eine gute Gelegenheit sie auszuprobieren. Außerdem rühmt sich das Javier's für seine handgeschüttelten Margaritas. Wir haben dies nicht ausprobiert, aber an den Nachbartischen wurden fleißig und akrobatisch die Mixbecher geschüttelt.
Fazit: High-end-cuisine  wirbt das Javier's von sich. Stimmt! Wer einen mexikanisch angehauchten Abend in in authentischer Umgebung verbringen möchte, hier ist man richtig. Tischreservierung abends empfehlenswert. Vier Sterne.",j0rsg8j7TnLjO6pH2jA64w,0,0,4,bWPwruxi1rCpC02LQongQg

624761,2013-04-29,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Ruined my wife's 30th
Food- Tried the ceviche (very good) but nothing else. I will explain. 

We decided to go to Javier's about 2 months before my wife's 30th B day. So I called in to make a reservation for 15, which was taken by the receptionist. Later on we called back and changed the reservation from a Friday to that Saturday. The receptionist accepted the request, so we thought everything was perfect.
So it was time for dinner on Saturday and my wife and I are excited to be eating at a great location like Javier's in the ARIA. I let the receptionist know that we have a reservation at 8 under my wife's name. She tells us there is no such reservation, then she asked if we had a cake delivered, which we did from Jean Philippe (delicious by the way, recommend). We told her yes and she looked like someone just punched her dog. They told us that we need to wait until all the party arrived and they have a banquet room they could open up. We say the banquet room online and new it was beautiful so we got a little more optimistic that the night would not be ruined, we were wrong.
Our party arrives and I let them know we are all here and they sat us down immediately. This was awesome, since there was a 2 hour wait. So we are soooo excited to be eating with friends and family especially because we got to eat in the beautiful banquet room, and we start to order drinks and our food. As we were ordering our food I could see the waiters face expression as to say ""that's all you're going to order"". Most of us liked the appetizer menu (Ceviche was great) and we were still waiting for 6 people that were still coming. The night was young and we had a lot of ordering to do, especially alcoholic beverages (Margaritas were average). 
After the waiter leaves, we receive some of our appetizers and all our drinks, I observe a few guys in suits and ties and our waiter talking while they were pointing to our direction. The Suits started wondering around which for some reason made me wonder what they were doing. I bring it to my wives attention and she jokingly said ""What if they decide to move us"". We both gave a nervous giggle. About five minutes later one of the Suits comes walking up to me and says what we feared. ""We are going to have to move you"". He could have said a few other things after that but I did not hear any of it. I asked him to give us a few minutes and he said yes and walked off.  We were all a little shocked since we were halfway into our B day dinner night. 
We all got up drink in hand and tentatively started to walked over to what we thought was our table, but they sat us down at the bar area to wait for the next available table. Mind you our food was done and ready to be served. My wife and our group were extremely embarrassed. 
My wife was visibly upset so my sister in law decided to talk to the Manager. When they were in discussion the Manager said ""What it comes down to is you were not spending enough money to be in that room"" She came back to tell us what he had said and we were floored. My wife just decided to cut our losses and just leave. When we notified the manager we just wanted to leave because we have never been treated like this at any restaurant and pay for what we consumed he just replied ""OK"". No apologies, Nothing. The icing on the cake (no pun indented) was while this was going on a group of 6 women, yes I said 6, we counted were comfortably sat in the banquet room our party of 9 at the time but soon to be 15 was just exiled from. 
We asked for our cake, paid our bill and walked out. I would never recommend Javier's. They have very, very Bad Management and obviously not very good at making reservations.
We enjoyed my wife's delicious cake from Jean Philippe in the comfort of our room. In my sarcasm voice ""Thanks Javier's""",HCmwcvI0P1v5mslUNyhAMg,2,0,1,xSdcKnK_P1VuBdpWcsVVKA

742084,2014-07-11,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"My wife and I went to try this place recently while we were on vacation during the month of June 2014. I'm a fan of the Jim Rome show and he raved about it on his radio show one recent morning so I figured I'd give it a try since I'd be coming out to Las Vegas.
We ordered guacamole for the appetizer, the ""mole poblano and carne tampiquena"" for dinner. For drinks we had a couple of margaritas. I can't remember the actual name but they were made with some sort of top shelf tequila. 
The ambiance was very dark but classy. It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be so this was nice. It was a Tuesday evening around 9pm when we arrived. The music over head was upbeat in English and Spanish and not to loud so that was a plus. The waiter was very attentive and talkative. He was very personable with us. 
The guacamole appetizer was a decent portion and garnished decoratively with chips. However, it lacked flavor. I'm not a fan of salt but I needed to add some to give it more flavor than the soft avocado taste and light cheese sprinkled on. I must be used to seeing and tasting other spices and things (onion, tomato, cilantro, etc.) on guacamole so not seeing this I was a little surprised. 
The margarita was decent. But not worth the price. I've had better margaritas at half the cost. If you are ever in Stockton Ca you should try Arroyos Cafe. They make good strong and flavorful margaritas.
The mole was really good. The sauce was thick, dark and not runny with very good flavorful spices. It had a good bite in the end. Not spicy. Just made well with a variety of spices to give it that good mole flavor. No salt needed here. Unfortunately the rest of the items that were part of the meal were not so special. They were just ok and are not worthy of a recommendation.
The waiter offered us a complimentary ""flan"" desert for our anniversary so we decided to try it. That too unfortunately lacked flavor. It needed more sauce because it was rather dry and the syrup was not very sweet in flavor. I guess if I had to describe this experience in one word I would have to say ""bland"".
For two people it was $125 including the tip. It's Las Vegas so what do you expect. That's what I figured based on a few reviews I read before coming to dine here. I don't mind paying for a good meal but if Mexican food is what you're craving, I would recommend looking at other options before settling to dine here. If you're ever in Sacramento, I would recommend Zocalo in mid-town Sacramento for Mexican fine dining. 
I read this establishment started in Southern California so if any of my SoCal trips in the future bring me near Javier's in SoCal, I would give it another try just because I want to make sure I give it a fair chance.",MhTGctjVTCKQZPGeHtZ5PA,0,0,3,ecIeaBYuSpvTbJab8wdKDg

763452,2016-08-31,2,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Avoid this place at all costs! The only thing ""upscale"" about this place is the decor and the prices. 

The Food:

When you are in Vegas, it is understood that you pay a premium for good food; but the worst offense is when you pay a premium for bland and mediocre food. I visited this restaurant with 12 other people and we were all less than impressed with flavor and quality of the food.
I got the the two shrimp tacos, with black beans and white rice for $22 and I am lucky if I even got a total of 6 shrimp between the two tiny tacos - but I don't know for sure since the shrimp were all chopped up. The black beans tasted like they were from a can and the white rice had ZERO flavor. I was extremely disappointed since the majority of the reviews rave about the food. I know that everyone has different likes and dislikes, but I have had better food at Taco Cabana.

The Service:

Let me preface this by saying that this place, is absolutely not a good place for groups to dine or celebrate special occasions. We went to Javier's to celebrate two of my friends' birthdays and we left in utter shock of the service we received. The dinner service was ok, nothing special, but I understand that there was a total of 13 of us and the restaurant was busy. The big shock came at the end of the evening when our server brought the check. We indicated to him that we wished to split the check 7 ways, at which point he stated that this is not something he could do. He stated that he was only allowed to split the check between 4 cards. Naturally, we were all annoyed at the situation. At no other point had this been brought to our attention; not when we made the reservation, not when we were seated, not when our orders were taken. We requested to speak with that manager hoping that we could get a better explanation as to why the checks could not be split and see what other options were available. When the manager finally made his way to our table, I was shocked by how unhelpful he was. He indicated that their point of sale system would only allow 4 cards to be processed on the same check and basically told us to figure it out. As someone who has previously worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry, I understand that there are sometimes system limitations. I asked if any of the checks could be transferred to ""open"" tables or ""to-go"" tickets so that they could be processed separately, he stated he could not do that. Again, we asked for any other suggestions and his answer over and over again was ""I don't know."" By this time, we had grown increasingly frustrated and decided that we would all get cash and pay for our checks in cash. At this point, we were still trying to figure out who's was what and trying to add up everyone's individual totals. We asked the manager what the tax rate was so we could try to split the checks up and he didn't even know. He said he would try to find out and come and let us know. 20 minutes later with a pen, paper and a calculator we figured it out and we were able to pay for our bill in cash and get out of that place. The manager never came back by to tell us the tax rate or to apologize. My friends who were celebrating their birthdays left frustrated and embarrassed. Definitely, not how we hoped their dinner would go. 

Being that this restaurant is located in the Aria Hotel we had great expectations when it came to the food and the service and we are sad to say that we were greatly disappointed and we left with a bad taste in our mouth --but maybe that was from the food.",DbSfgXVN3WqlyjEfS_P5oQ,3,0,1,QQIJb-__uuqIvEjhhLC_yQ

I resent being pointed out over an issue I had nothing to do with. People in our group mentioned how weird it was and what a waste it was that water was being poured from freshly opened bottles. So, before anything is ordered, be really clear about what kind of water you want. If you see a bottle and didn't order it, let them know immediately. I have read this is one of the biggest scams in so called up scale restaurants. We got scammed a 130 bucks worth. But, they got no tip on a $1200+ bill. 

Our food was cool and cold for some and my enchiladas were tasteless. No spice or flavor just like the margaritas. I'm not picky unless picky means you want your food to be served the correct temp and your cocktails not to taste like water with lime.

If you read up on the story of the joint -- they're a chain from Orange Co., Calif. that caters to well-heeled diners -- you can see where the attitude comes from.

I asked the hostess and she confirmed it. ALL the waiters are male (oh -- except, of course, for the cocktail waitresses). ALL the hostesses are female. This is a high-end restaurant and tips are normally based on the price of entrees, so the waiters here are doubtless well paid. And those jobs are only open to men. I can't believe this is even legal in this day and age. 

Food? Fantastic. Atmosphere? Romantic and classy. Drinks? I'm told that the Javier margarita is the best margarita in a tri-state area. LOL! So on the whole, I recommend Javier's.

She told me ""WELL NEXT TIME DON'T BE LATE TO YOUR OWN PARTY"" than walked away from me when I was talking. I was livid!!!! I seriously wanted to slap her! I never in my life been treated so badly! So I complain to the Restaurant manager and told him how horrible that assistant manager was treating me, than he tells me the assitant manager was his wife!!!?? What the heck?? So obvi hes not going to reprimand her cause they're married. Total BS. The manager tried to make things right and got me a drink at the bar, but the damage was already done. My party didn't want to wait any longer at another restaurant so we just stayed. By the time we sat and eat we had waited over 2 hours.

1023079,2013-09-04,2,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"The only reason I ended up here on a random adventure is because my pops hit 2k at Aria within the first 5 minutes of being there. Random day indeed, but happy as ever. He treated us all to Javier's because he loves lobsters enchiladas like you wouldn't believe. He indeed had that and he said it was amazing. I cannot attest to that since I do not enjoy seafood much, but I will take his word for it. 

As for me, BEST rice I have ever had thus far in my lifetime. I am a big big fan of (Spanish) rice. Anytime I can get it, I will. Unless I already know it sucks at a certain place, then that is a no go. However, Javier's is delicious, moist, mouth-watering. Whatever positive adjective you can think of, that is what it is. I wish I would have gotten more to go, but I was so full it didn't occur to me until later on when I was craving it. 

The next best thing I had was the chicken enchilada and the crispy chicken taco combo. This is usually on most menus of the Mexican restaurants I go to, but of course I had to compare my favorite. The enchilada was good, but not exploding in my mouth good. The sauce was a bit on the spice side for my taste buds, but not too overpowering where I needed to drench my mouth with water. And the chicken taco was stuffed with crisp bites all the way. Usually tacos just have a little bit of chicken on the bottom and that's it, but this one had chicken with every bite. It was really good. And of course the beans were good, but not as good as the rice my friends! 

Next, I washed it all down with a very delicious, but kind of on the small side, pomegranate margarita. They actually topped the drink with fresh pomegranate. It was very good, but for the price, I was expecting an actual margarita glass and not a rocks glass. Still good though. 

Lastly, and my absolute favorite is the decor and atmosphere of Javier's. It is a dark glamour like feeling when you walk in. There was a lot of tree branch designs coming out of the walls, but my favorite was the one that held multiple bottles of what looked like tequila and other variations of liquor.  It was so pretty, I wish I could have it in my future house. The next best thing was the back wall mural of skulls and skeletons. It was just so mesmerizing to look at. I could stare at it for hours, just examining each piece (4). 

This place is very expensive in some areas of their menu, but not too bad in others. My dish was only 19, not sure how much the drink was. I would save up to come here again for sure. Perfect for a nice date night. They also have a bar in the front. Such a neat place.",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,3,2,4,dVqCCu1fOki80dXg3u-hNg

I'm a local in Vegas and if I'm going out for Mexican food this wont be on my list. For a high end Mexican restaurant this place does not qualify. Save your $$$$$ and go somewhere else. 

My group ordered 2 shrimp taco plates (2 on each plate) and both plates came out cold. We sent them both back and the plates came out cold again. When paying $$$ for 2 shrimp tacos you expect the kitchen to get it right 50% of the time.  Our other dishes came out fine ( quesadilla and enchilada) but even so not outrageously delicious. Our server didn't come check on us as often as one would expect and we were left dry for a fair amount of the time. 

We got the bill and I was more than happy to pay but $181 for cold shrimp tacos, a quesadilla, an enchilada, and 2 rounds of drinks???  I asked to speak with the manager and he kept turning things back on me, like I did something wrong. His name was Omar, completely unprofessional and lacked the maturity of a manager for such a high end restaurant. He asked me if I ate all my cold food, I'm like, ""I was hungry.... I'm not gonna send my food back again and again and again to keep getting a cold dish"". His answer ""I'm not giving you a discount"". I didn't even ask for a discount but since he shoved that in my face instead of asking me ""how can I make your experience more enjoyable"", I said ""Why not?"".  He said ""we ate all our food"".  I'm trying to help you run your business by giving you constructive feedback and letting you know there was obviously something wrong in the kitchen, but he didn't seem, to care. 

I'm done ranting on this place, hope everyone else has a better experience than we did, if this review does not turn you away. Otherwise there are a lot of restaurants in Vegas that give much better service and management actually cares what the customer has to say.",iIi3oSXuZo4Kv0VcvWqp3w,14,1,1,dl526kmt0hblRHL0f1sKLA

The house special La Tablita is a make-your-own-taco platter that ""serves two."" It easily could've served four. We ordered it with steak and carnitas. 

Some of the carnitas were ribs--I've never seen that before--it's usually pork shoulder or butt. I love carnitas, theirs was good, but would've been better if the meat had been broken into chunks before browning. Instead, it was served it in two solid chunks so most of the meat was dry and not crispy from being fried up in oil or fat before serving.

Summary: Really good Mexican at ridiculous Vegas prices. And of course the place is ridiculously loud, like everywhere you go on the wacko Strip.",7ty5SRz0RNulSKPSL1kJrw,0,0,4,kC8D1jI898XppGb-747gDA

The food was GOOD and is consistent with the Cali locations, but the service leaves something to be desired. It was SLOW-EMPTY TABLE AFTER EMPTY TABLE and the server was slow and did not service our table-we ran out of water and had to beg someone to bring the check and then to pick up the payment once it was ready. It took at least 15 minutes for us to get salsa and chips. The staff did not seem to follow the model used in the Cali locations which have IMPECCABLE service and CARE about their customers and the service they receive at Javiers. 

Now, I should say that I eat at Javier's Cali locations monthly and I am negatively affected by the review I have to give their Las Vegas location. 

I called the next day to obtain information about having a party in their private room and was told that either the restaurant manager or the event manager would be able to help me but NEITHER or them was available. REALLY!!!!!! WOW!!! this is an extension of the horrible customer service received the day before expect I  would be spending thousands of dollars for it!!!!!! 

To make matters worse when I went to the Manager the day after to get information about having a party in their private room he was very nonchalant and seemed uncaring about the inquiry. He walked us over to the room and told me to e-mail him to obtain the information about the room in writing. My thought, I am here, so why wouldn't you SEND ME the information since I am here to patronize your restaurant for a special occasion.  AGAIN!!!!!!

The food and drinks were incredible - every enchilada and fajita at our table was delicious and flavorful. But the margaritas were the highlight - from spicy, to fruity, to on the rocks, to frozen, all of them were made to perfection. 

The one downfall was that our waitress was extremely overwhelmed and did not provide the best service - we understood it was packed, but we ordered apps and tequila shots that often never arrived. We had to continually remind her after long lengths of time, and she seemed quite forgetful. That was slightly frustrating at an upscale restaurant.

I bought into the hype and got the jalapeno margarita - It was exquisite! The freshness of the pepper, the underlying heat and the cool of the lime balance perfectly. I wanted to try the cucumber margarita too but I had already fallen for the sweet heat of the pepper. I had the enchiladas suizas (chicken with tomatillo sauce). It was tasty.

My experience with Javier is that the manager named ""Leah"" definitely unexperienced and should not be a manager, she needs to look for a different type of job where she does not give  customer service.

Home to many delicious Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants with gargantuan portions.  None of which have nearly the prices that Javier's holds.  Granted, none are on the ""Strip"" as well.  Nonetheless, I feel that everything on the menu should have a lower price point.

Sure, you're also paying for ambiance and atmosphere.  And in those two areas, they excel.  It's dark, sexy, and high-energy.  It's a place to see and be-seen.  I love these things and I loved being here.

But the service... bleh.  And the food is good, not great.  I have higher expectations when things are more expensive.  Unfortunately this is where there is a disconnect.

We ordered guacamole for the table which was a disappointment.  I ordered the steak fajitas, which I recommend... but unfortunately they didn't blow me away.  I give Javier's four stars.  Price and service kept it from getting a five.

As usual I filled up on chips and salsa by the time we ordered our entrees. As a result I didn't order anything special- just a two taco plate. I tried one chicken and one beef. Chicken was the better of the two. Nice crunchy shells that did not immediately disintegrate with the first bite. The surprise for me was the refried beans. Normally I find them to be awful and an unwelcome sight on my plate but the refried beans here were very good. The Chile Negro looked particularly appetizing.

I took one star off because out of all my reviews & loyalty to Javier's, my Octopus Ceviche as pictured versus the last two times clearly looks horrible.  It also tasted gritty.  The manager was no where to be found & I had to leave.  Mike the bartender is always fantastic.  What's up chef on Thursday 14th at 2:20pm?  Manager?  

Mole Poblano, bone-in chicken, braised in a chocolatey mole w/ arroza, refritos & flour tortillas.  Delish!

Camrones Rancheros .. Wild premium Mexican White prawns sautéed in garlic butter, poblano, chiles, onions & tomato flavored w/ cilantro. 

Trio de enchiladas Del Mar is a beautiful dish of a shrimp enchilada, crab enchilada & lobster enchilada w/ a lite tomatillo sauce that isn't overpowering.  Lite & delish.  

Shredded Beef Enchiladas, Chile Rellenos & Shredded Chicken taco.  It's a combo & they cannot get the tacos right.  I love the grilled steak instead of beef enchiladas cause it has no caramelized veggies, which I hate.

Enchiladas de Mariscos stuffed w/ Dungeness Crab, shrimp, sautéed garlic butter & tomatillo sauce topped w/Monterey Jack Cheese.  

Looking for A Vegan dish?  The Spinach Enchiladas & the Vegetarian Enchiladas are absolutely tasty & filling!

Huge starter that is cheesy & tasty is of course the Nachos de la casa & shredded chicken or beef.  Can't go wrong!  

Add a Jalapeño Margarita, Mumm Rose or a beautiful glass of wine from the awesome wine list.  I've eaten here monthly since they opened, am an excellent critic of Javier's & love certain things.  Today was a bit off.  

It's pricier than Mexican restaurants, but it's inside of Aria.  The food, drinks & ambience are totally different than our regular ma & pa's lovely restaurants.  I have regular favorites at both that I cannot find at either.

Irecommend sitting at Javier's bar or booths.  The chips & tasty salsa are fabulous, I usually ask for the Habanero.  Super HOT!",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,7,5,4,mVnUwHsq3tvIr54dOHmKcA

1340330,2012-11-30,10,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Only if my taste buds were on my eyes.
 The place is astonishing! Love the white walls the dark woods the dark leather and the accent wrought iron. All in a some kind of Moroccan architecture with ogival arches and hanging ropes imitating giant draperies. There's also the largest chainsaw carved piece of art hanging on one of the walls that suppose to tell the history of the Mayans but all I saw was skeletons scattered all over, maybe it tells the Mayan present and not the past. still ....a real feast to my eyes! This is the place where you would probably find the most interesting man in the world having lunch!...... So I ordered a Dos Equis and asked for the menu.

The food.... where do I start? Oh yes! With the chips and salsa of course. The first rule to tell if a restaurant is committed to quality is with the chips. Room temperature chips = corner cutting restaurant. Warm chips = will go the extra mile for you restaurant. Well I'm happy to inform you that the chips were not only warm, they were also crispy and tasty! and that's before adding the salsa!....now to the not so great.

 I was really hoping for something different on the menu since by looking at the place it is obvious that Javier wants to set himself apart from most typical Mexican restaurants but unlike the decor the menu at Javiers was as boring as any taco shop menu in town. To be fair they do serve steaks and some vegetarian items but you'll pay for that!  Yes the prices are a little bit high for a Mexican restaurant.
Carne asada 50.00, filete ladrillo 60.00 filete antiguo 45.00 but like everyone else says...""this is the strip!"".... I don't care, you just don't buy silver and pay for gold! ..oh yes, I've paid more for food before but for stuff that I couldn't pronounce and definitely not in a Mexican restaurant...call me el cheapo but I skipped those items and settled for a taco an enchilada and a chile relleno combo. Food came out kinda warm almost cold even though the plate felt hotter than the food which I didn't understand but I was hungry and it was warm enough and edible so I ate it but shouldn't be acceptable at those prices. 
 Service was kinda slow. I had to wait between beers and to order and the place wasn't busy at that time. I think they were saving their energy for rush hour or something. I didn't mind at the time since I wasn't in a hurry and also it gave me time to take some pictures. but at the end although I think the food is good but nothing that would make me go out of my way to get as if it was something that would go through a rolled one hundred dollar bill. I would probably try it again but only if I'm in the area.

 I do have one complaint.....Javier, what's up with the music? That's the stuff you would listen to at Mariana's supermarket while pushing a shopping cart or at the broad acres swap meet while you bite into an elote. I'm sure you can come up with something a little bit more original. How about some Mana, Sin Banderas, or play some pandora....and get rid of all those eight tracks!
In conclusion. This place gets 3.5 stars in my opinion. The food is decent, the place is beautiful, and so was the staff that was working at that time....if only my taste buds were on my eyes.

The problem however was that the first wave of customers was followed more waves of loud intoxicated foul mouthed folks who were just left to mill around to piss and moan about not having a place to sit. The management had no answer and the mini mob stood about for over half an hour.  Our table was soon eyeballed as part of the solution to managements problem and we were aggressively serviced by table cleaning bus help who hovered close by.

Javier's allure is its atmosphere as much as its convenient location in the svelte Aria.  Everything in Vegas that is worth seeking out is ""through the casino.""  We passed raucous sports bars and slot machine cha-chinging walkups before choosing Javier's for its quieter mood.  It has metal studded ceilings, carved wood banquets, and heavy leather table tops and lounge seating  The piped in music was definitely an amusing background - looping on reggae during our hour's visit.  

We added to the cosmopolitan mix by ordering French martinis - not cheap at $17 each.  A value totally underestimated until we rose to our feet and discovered the liquid power that could have launched us to  the ionosphere.  But since we only hoped to get to the show ""through the casino,""  the libations were perfect rocket boosters.

Food served at the adjoining table showed impressive presentation.  I can only tell you about the chips that were served warm next to attractive cups of red and green salsa.

Speaking of feet.  Yes, see paragraph 3.  My friend was suffering from all those trips Through the Casino.  The kindly waitress dipped into her own purse and presented three bandaids to sooth the blister that surfaced while one toe fought with the other to be first on the escalator, tram, revolving door, taxi, carpet, marble floor, etcetera etcetera...An interesting, very girl-to-girl, hospitable way to earn a well-deserved tip.",MInp33w5vvHeBo68BAPmgw,2,2,5,wkQCFe5C9jaB1I5-Nr_0bA

I live on the strip and am a regular here. The place is definitely five stars for food and atmosphere, zero stars for service, averaging to 2.5 stars overall.

I basically just come here for free water, chips, and salsa. I sit at the counter, and wait ten minutes. If a server acknowledges me within ten minutes, I'll stay for dinner. If they intentionally ignore me and avoid eye contact, I have my fill of chips and walk over to Serrano for dinner. It's about 50/50 odds for either outcome.

At the end of the day, that's  just the nature of this place. If you combine bad management, union employees, a plentiful supply hotel customers who don't know what to expect when coming here, this is pretty much the outcome one would predict. 

All in all, I'm not going to dissuade you from coming here. It's a pretty cool place if you know what you're up against.

Out reservation was at 8:30pm on a Friday, and there was a bit of a wait at the hostess desk. We were seated at about 8:50pm. 

That was a minor inconvenience, but a more pressing inconvenience was the noise level inside the restaurant. The music was almost impossibly loud. I've been in nightclubs with softer music. After the first course, my spouse and I essentially abandoned any attempts to be able to hear each other. 

They have an impressive tequila menu, so connoisseurs will find plenty of options to savor. We tried one of their mezcal cocktails, which was excellent.

For a starter, we shared an order of Totopos (which worked out to be a traditional plate of nachos with shredded chicken); and it was delicious. 

The menu is extensive, and we had a very hard time narrowing down to a final choice. If it had not been so loud, we definitely would have planned a second visit during our stay, to get to try our runner-up choices. 

Ultimately, we settled on Camarones Mojo del Ajo (Mexican white prawns sauteed in butter, garlic, wine) and the Filete Costeno (8 oz. center cut filet mignon, and your choice of crab or lobster enchilada - I chose lobster - and served with two giant chiles stuffed with Cojita and Monterey Jack cheese). 

The food was delicious, but at these prices for Mexican food (nearly $200 for two people - one cocktail each, no dessert), I feel like the meal should have been transcendent. Instead, it was was an excellent Mexican meal.",Mu6MPWFhuZaAMWi0Md0tqA,0,0,4,f7FZYvRoAIqP5dm75QaHew

I noticed this another time. Trey have really cut their portions to the bone. There was literally not even a quarter spoon of meat. I would suggest going to the cafe their quesadillas there are to die for. The tortilla is crunchy with sour cream and lettuce and tomatoes.

I have to admit i had my reservations about coming here at first as i had been burned by other 'Mexican' places out here in vegas. Coming from Los Angeles, i guess I'm a bit of a snob about my Mexican food. But this place did not disappoint, in fact, i was impressed.
First off, hostess and waitress were super friendly, decor is not typical, its very modern. Salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is homemade and a hair spicy, just the way i like it. Menu extensive, which i give bonus points for over MESA GRILL, which has a very limited menu.
I ordered one of the combination plates that comes with an enchilada (chorizo), crispy taco (beef) and chile relleno. I usually hate chile rellenos but have been converted due to Javiers. One thing I've never seen or had is that serve refried white beans. WOW! They're much smoother in taste and texture than pinto or black beans. Super good.
I also ordered a tamarindo (tamarind) margarita. Im a light drinker so if i taste ANY alcohol in my drink, i hate it. This is the smoothest hard drink I've ever had. 
I can go on and on about this place. I want to go try their  seafood now. Hope you guys go try this place out and have as great an experience as i did.

Chips were thin, crispy and fresh and the salsa was absolutely delicious. The margaritas were the best we've ever had. Don't pay $8 for a sugary mess out at the casino bar - come here and spend the extra $ - you won't regret it. 

The atmosphere here is so cool. They have the world's largest wood sculpture on the back wall and it was carved by a chainsaw artist from Oregon. I could stare at it for hours - it was amazing. The servers were also really knowledgable (how we learned about the art) and had a vast knowledge of their tequilas. When we were heading out the waitress asked if we wanted ""roadies"".

Great food; great service.  Pricey but well worth it.  (But not obnoxiously expensive like Nobu, for example)  Fantastic, diverse menu.  I didn't have any alcohol this time but my friends told me the fancy Margaritas they ordered were sublime.

Take your time perusing the menu.  They have a fantastic selection from meats, to seafood, to what I would call ""mexican combo"" plates but that would be a ""misnomer"" from what we are used to at normal tex-mex places.  This is a GREAT date place, too.  But make reservations.  It can get busy on a weekend.  

The decorations are amazing and noteworthy.  The photo of the wood carving I'm attaching supposedly has the owners caricatured in the top right corner.  There is also a glass margarita tree that is part of the decor that looks a little Chihuly'ish, if you know who he is.

I started with a house margarita and it was only $12 which is an amazing deal in Vegas AND it was delicious and strong too. Then I got the queso fundido with chorizo which was savory and spicy. The queso, unlike most, did not solidify immediately and was good for about 15 minutes. Then I got the steak fajitas which was large enough for two people. The beans are made with lard which makes them a little heavier but the taste was fantastic. I used my left over chips and used the beans for a dip, which lightened them up a little bit. Also I was able to get all of that service and food within one hour of sitting down, which is rare if you are in Vegas.

The salsa and chips they served were good. nothing special to write about except they were bottomless so it was a good appetizer. We did order some guac which was nice and smooth texture wise and stated creamy. It was pretty delicious.

A friend and I split / shared an order of shrimp enchiladas and an order of crab enchiladas. They were served wit refried beans, rice, and 2 enchiladas. The portions for rice and beans was small but they tasted just fine. The shrimp and crab meat was delicious but i think what threw me off was the favor of the enchilada sauce. The sauce tasted ""off"" but I can't really pin point what it was about the sauce but it just didn't taste right. 

Comparing this place to almost any hole in the wall taqueria, this place had ok Mexican food but it was no where near the quality of a taqueria but costs double the price. 

Overall, If you really want some mexican food, find a taqueria near by off the strip and you'll be better off. If you're really hungry and you're in the aria, I'd just go over to the aria cafe and order something there. While its not much cheaper, you have better options  for food at the cafe.

Situated off of the casino, you feel like you're worlds away inside the restaurant. Graceful arches punctuate the space while exposed beams and a variety of textures curate a dark and brooding, yet elegant ambiance. I really liked the setting itself, I just wasn't a fan of my entree. 

I ordered, as I always do at Mexican restaurants, the chicken fajitas. The presentation was different from most in that there was no steaming skillet, but rather an artfully arranged mini tower of veggies and chicken on my plate. The chicken was marinated in adobo and tasted more like buffalo chicken than Mexican and was SPICY. I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy and was not a fan. It's also on the higher end for chicken fajitas at $27. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their meals so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The margarita was pretty good and reasonably priced at $12. 

I am a frequent Vegas visitor but I doubt I'll return to Javier's. I think that for $250+ for four people there are a zillion other restaurants in Vegas where you get a lot higher quality food for your money.

The ambiance is an old world Mexican cantina. White plaster walls and iron adorn the restaurant, while a round wooden bar sits well positioned at the entrance. The bathrooms are quite nice and have a rather chatty attendant... who isn't too intrusive but makes his presence known.

Obviously I had to try their margarita, which was great... not the best... but very good, nonetheless. The guacamole was small and perfect for two people to share. It lacked cilantro, which is a must in any guacamole I prepare myself. Good not great.

The chips and salsa were really the highlight. Very reminiscent of my childhood eating in Tex-Mex cantinas with my parents and welcome callback from my past. It's a little sweeter than most salsas, but it tasted quite fresh, I enjoyed it considerably. As I did the chips. They tasted fresh.

I had a taco enchilada platter that was very good. Everything tasted very Tex-Mex. Perfect seasoning, perfect heat, and the taste was very good. 

I had seen reviews before I went that the service was very lacking. The restaurant was probably about a third full (it was early in the evening) and I was quite aware that our service may not be very good. But, I'm quite happy to report that the service was good to great.

I wish I could give it 5 stars... but it's more like a 4.5 star restaurant for me. The ambiance was a little too dark and the walls felt a little too cold and a little too bare for me.

As we approached the restaurant and waited for our table I noticed that it was very ""Vegas"" with fancy decor. I knew it wouldn't be the same as a beachy restaurant in Southern California but it was almost too fancy. 

We were seated inside and I was able to see this beautiful wood carved mural. I tried to get photos of it but there was so much going on that I couldn't get one. 

The restaurant was very very loud.  Maybe it was just the acoustics, there wasn't loud music or anything like that it was just a lot of people talking very loudly and I couldn't hear my boyfriend across the table unless we talked loudly as well.  

We started with the queso fundido. It was delicious, I loved the chorizo in this.  It got cold very quickly and it was difficult to eat but we made it work anyway. 

He ordered the Milanesa de Pollo, and the chicken was very moist and perfectly cooked. My Mole Poblano dish was absolutely perfect. It's really hard to make mole well, and Javier's was excellent. 

My only other complaint about the restaurant besides the loud atmosphere, was the fact that the prices were ridiculous compared to the prices I remember paying in Laguna Beach.

We we're instantly drawn to the decor; a massive thick steeple with dangling ropes mid bar, also noticing the intimate executive personal party room with a beautiful wooden table, the ""tree of life,"" wall decor adorned with so many various bottles of expensive tequilas, and most of all the intricate chainsaw carved wall paneling of purgatory!

Two Empanadas, two small Quesadillas, two Taquitos, two Sopes.

ENCHILADAS DE MARISCOS
Two enchiladas stuffed with shrimp and Dungeness Crab sautéed in butter, garlic, onion and wine, then covered in a tomatillo sauce, melted Monterey Jack cheese and garnished with avocado slices and sour cream. Served with arroz and refritos.

CARNE TAMPIQUEÑA
New York steak #1 prime center cut 6oz grilled, accompanied by a mole chicken enchilada, taquito, and refritos.

Highlights of Javier's has to be their  shockingly authentic Mexican flavors. From the salsa, to the margaritas, beans made with chorizo, authentic Mexican rice, flautas, and killer mole sauce, everything tasted homemade and delicious!

We were expecting a step up from the Mexican food we get locally in the Bay Area, but it was mediocre at best.  The drinks were nice and the queso appetizer was interesting, but our crab and chicken enchiladas were mild in flavor and generic.  I had the crab, which was initially given to my partner, but due to the lack of flavor, it took us a couple bites to realize they messed up the plating. My enchiladas also had a few pieces of shell. 

I still ate everything up as it was edible, but it reminded me of a Mexican restaurant where seniors go to eat because they don't have any taste buds left and it won't upset their stomachs. Except, seniors wouldn't eat here because the food is way too overpriced for what you get. Vegas is expensive and I understand the inflated prices, but I also expect an inflated experience.

The Tres Enchiladas Del Mar came with three seafoods: crab, lobster, and shrimp, under a tasty sauce.

Quesadilla with Grilled Chicken was stuffed and quite filling.

The waiter was attentive and friendly, changing out our silverware as the appetizer plate was switched out for our main courses.

2016055,2014-01-21,23,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's is hit or miss at this location so that's why I gave four stars instead of five. I've been to them all practically, from Cabo, Mexico to Irvine to the one in the airport at John Wayne. Only Javier's I haven't been to is the one at Crystal Cove. 

For whatever reason, sometimes the food at the Aria location tastes consistent with my five star reviews of all their other locations, and sometimes it just tastes off. 

My first experience with this restaurant pissed me off and I almost didn't go back again. I ordered ""enchiladas de mariscos"" which is my favorite dish and what I order at all the other Javier's. I didn't think I even needed to look at the menu because I assumed it was the same as all the other locations, so I never bothered and just ordered away. I guess, in retrospect, I should have double-checked because the waiter brought me out chicken enchiladas instead of what I wanted. The second I tasted it I noticed something was not quite right but it was dark in there and I just assumed since this was a different Javier's and my first time, that maybe their cooks weren't up to speed out here in Vegas yet. The place was still somewhat new at the time. It didn't taste amazing like I was used to so I ate about half of one enchilada and then finally gave up, thinking another one bites the dust! I called the waiter over and told them that I was very disappointed with my dish (which I never do, for the record). I told him he must have brought me the wrong thing or the chef had no clue what was up and then he said, ""No, I brought you what you ordered, enchiladas suizas."" and I said, ""No, I had ordered enchiladas de mariscos!"" So yeah, obvious miscommunication there! That explained the mystery of why it didn't taste right. However, the waiter didn't offer to fix the situation and instead told me not to tip him. No clue what that was all about. Maybe the management takes it out of the waiters' tips if they get the orders wrong. I dunno... I've never had that happen before. Just thought that was the most interesting customer service I had ever received to date, if you even want to call that customer service. So needless to say, I left there unhappy that night. Thank god I complained because had I not, I would have written this place off as a no go. And waiter guy still got a tip even though I shoulda stiffed him! I'm too nice...

Anyway... Note to everyone who is used to calling it Enchiladas de Mariscos: It's actually called ""Seafood Enchiladas"" here and only here. Why my waiter, who spoke Spanish mind you, didn't get this right is beyond me but whatever! Mariscos translates to ""seafood"". What's the problemo, señor? Since the staff doesn't get it, they should be told that at the other locations this particular dish is called something different so technically it has two names. And they should be told what that name is so as to avoid other Javier's professionals, like me, from getting chicken enchiladas when they want seafood. And one more thing, if the waiters get it wrong, they should credit you back the price of your dish or remake your food for you the right way, at least. None of that don't tip me BS because that still doesn't make up for your mistake!

Anywhoooo... hate to admit it but these aholes at Javier's sure make good food (sometimes at this location, not 100% consistent) so that's why I keep coming back and not boycotting, in spite of my bad first impression with this Aria location. And it's not like I'm about to take a four hour drive to Cali just to satisfy my Javier's craving elsewhere. So I guess they have me stuck eating here, from time to time, when my cravings hit.

I absolutely love their organic margaritas (cadillac style). I guess after a few of those I'm willing to accept any of the crap that jerk Javier wishes to dish at me. I'm such a sucker! Their chips and salsa are addictive so be careful. Mustn't be too full for when your entrée arrives! Another thing, the atmosphere here is a 10! I love that dark, Guernica style carving along the back wall. This is a great place to take a date. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Hear that boys?

2032434,2015-11-03,5,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I think I really have some bad luck with this place. I actually wanted to give 1 star.
The food is fine - if and when it ever comes out. The last two times here, I waited 45 minutes for food to come out. I have no idea why it takes so long. I wasn't here on a weekend either. The first time it happened, we just walked out after paying for our drinks. We told the manager and he tried to get us to stay but it felt like it was because he didn't want to throw away the food that was being made. Last night it happened again. I ordered the Chile Colorado which was a thick piece of pork chop. After waiting 40 minutes, we asked our server what was taking so long, and he came back with some excuse that this particular dish takes this long to cook. Five minutes later, our food came out and both of our dishes were almost cold. That just tells me that it's been sitting for a while and it was forgotten. We had the manager come over this time and he apologized and offered us replacement dishes. I wanted to leave, but my friend was hungry so we agreed. Magically, this time it took 7 minutes to come out. Maybe I was still pissed off, but it didn't taste that great after all. At least it was hot.

The reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the manager ended up comping our meal for our bad experience. I still don't know if I want to come back again. At the prices that Javier's charges, I expect nothing short of exceptional service. Not poor excuses.

We split the Cabo Azul which has been what we get each time we visit. This time when the dish arrived it was warm but not hot. I did not complain because I was hungry and it was not cold. My husband took the shrimp taco and I, the enchilada. 

The waitress came by asked how everything was, we responded fine. Then we tried to split the relleno pepper, it was a tough pepper and difficult to cut. It was not thoroughly cooked, it was not soft or grilled as the item normally is nor was their much sauce atop of the dish. We ate a little bit of the inside on  1/2 the pepper. Then I said to myself for $36 this should be better and this dish is a 1/3 of what was ordered. We told our waitress, of our issue and she can also see the pepper and  1/2 the dish untouched. When she brought the bill I noticed there was no discount or any compensation for the bad food. I mentioned this to her and she said didn't my manager come over? We responded no. We waited over 10 minutes and had to tell her twice that no one had come to our table. Finally, 2 managers came by. (Meanwhile the restaurant was pretty full but not packed) We explained our complaint, their response was: We should have checked the pepper before telling our waitress everything was ok and also the waitress said some of the pepper was eaten. I explained I didn't think to try something I wasn't eating first, as I wouldn't want it to get cold and besides who would think it would not be cooked. They said they would make a bill adjustment and return. The bill adjustment was $6.00 off. Give me a break, Our 3 drinks were $48 and the bill still was over $80.00 and we get $6.00 off.  We told them this was our 3rd visit to this location and we've been to Newport Beach and recommended others. I do not think $6.00 off was enough, most companies do far more than what they need in order to make a good impression and have the customer leave with a good taste in their mouth wanting to come back. In Vegas there are choices and a ton of them. I will not give this location another chance, with poor management and handling off the problem they aren't worthy of our business. I understand things go wrong and aren't perfect, it is how someone handles the problem that counts.  Javier's in Vegas fell flat on their face.",3aQHrbFqIU8Fm5dHe1gtqA,0,0,2,o7O2sUrroqdvgjg7cD438g

The food is good but the service made our overall experience extremely negative.  We requested the La Tablita, but were brought the frajitas.  Instead of just correcting the mistake, our waiter brought out the additional items that were not included in the frajitas entree and then had the nerve to up charge us MORE than the original Tablitia order that we didn't receive. We brought it to our waiter's attention and he said he would ask his manager to deduct the incorrect amount...which by the way was only $15.00...so it clearly was not about the money.   The manager, Julie came over and instead of just apologizing for the mistake and deducting the overcharge....problem resolved....she stood at our table for ten minutes and went through our bill line by line (we had drinks, appetizers, main courses..). She actually asked us to count how many shrimps we had on our plate to make sure she wasn't deducting an extra $5.00 from our $150 bill.   She reviewed the bill again and then said she will take off the incorrect overcharge and walked away.  She came back fifteen minutes later and wanted to go over the bill line by line AGAIN and we told her we were not spending another ten minutes with her at our table reviewing our bill.

2168583,2014-10-29,1,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I will echo what many of the other reviewers have said- Javier's is a very solid dining experience. The dark, sultry decor is very inviting and makes a striking initial impression. Seating is a little tighter than I'd prefer, but it was not a major issue (except when the couple next to us overheard some of our conversation and were a bit appalled!)  They've got an interesting mix of music playing (lots of hip hop) At first, I couldn't tell if it was from the casino, but I am pretty sure it was actually from the restaurant. I didn't mind at all, but it was a bit unexpected in a Mexican restaurant. 

The service was fantastic. Our waiter was quite knowledgable about almost everything on the menu, and able to give complete recommendations. He really gushed over how good everything was- and was quite believable! Our water and drinks were replenished frequently, the table side pour of my friend's beer was done with a flourish, and we were checked on periodically without feeling stifled or rushed.

The food was also quite good. I didn't consider the prices exceedingly high, especially for a relatively upscale restaurant on the Strip. Most entrees appeared to range from between $20-$45, although there were some more expensive items as well. 

The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious, as was the guacamole. My strawberry margarita was  also very tasty. It wasn't overly sweet or syrupy, but yet remained flavorful and easy to drink.  

I ordered the quesadilla marisco ($28), and my dining companion ordered the Cabo Azul ($30). They both were great meals, with generous portions. The quesadilla was everything it should be- cheesy and full of seafood. It was served with sour cream and guacamole on the side. The Cabo Azul was indeed a big meal, and well worth the price. It included a shrimp taco, lobster enchilada, beans and rice, and stuffed peppers. I was able to sample the shrimp taco and the enchilada, and thought they were both delicious.

Atmosphere is cool, kinda lounge like, and just overall a good vibe. Decor is updated and when you're in it, you feel like you're in a hip, cool place. This is great for a group, or one on one date, or even dinner w your parents. 

Food & drinks are incredible. THE BEST CHIPS & SALSA EVER! Seriously. I'm a harsh critic and it isn't easy for me to say that. I could eat a basket on my own.
The drinks are good too, they have about a dozen margarita flavors, try the jalapeño! They are a little pricey ($15) and not that big. The food is incredible. It's not your typical Mexican restaurant that basically covers everything in cheese and red sauce. It's light, fresh, and has unique flavors. 

I've been to the Javier's in Newport, Irvine, and now Vegas and I can tell you, they are consistent, delicious, and hands down the best Mexican restaurant. 

Only thing is, be prepared to pay up. The average food plate is about $30-$35, margaritas are $15, and guacamole is $13 (I think), so dinner and some drinks for 2 will easily run $120.

2188188,2015-11-27,2,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's is not ""all fluff with no substance"".  In fact it's quite the opposite when it comes down to it. 

We came as pre-booked large party of 19 of us.  There was some confusion in our reservation and the Manager (I failed to get his name) was a complete gentleman and professional about it, and accommodated us in the large private room without any additional ordering minimums.  AAA++ to the restaurant manager for this.

The food was excellent.  I tend to gravitate away from ""fancy"" Mexcian restaurants because I'm of the garden variety type street food lover.  You know, the whole in the wall type of restaurant that usually gets much acclaim and fanfare for being such?  Well, this place proved me wrong.  In all its glory it's appropriately located in a modern and upbeat Vegas casino in the center-side of the casino floor. 

The warm, thin sliced, house made tortilla chips combined with the fresh made salsa never disappoints with a salt-brimmed margarita, exotic cocktail, or brown bottled Mexican beer.  They're addicting as usual, so don't over eat on first seating.  You'll want to save room for your main course.

A party of 19 will obviously yield many dishes amongst the group.  Everything from dishes of mole, carne asada, dishes of the sea, and your traditional recipes.  It was an overwhelming sentiment of two thumbs up for all the wonderful flavors and dishes. I decided to have the special of the day - the Sea Bass which was the best Sea Bass I've ever had.  Poached? Steamed? I forgot to ask the waiter/chef but it was phenomenal.  Really. 

Service was impeccable for our group.  Attentive, respectful, and the right dose of care.  I'd definitely come back here - for everything -  food/drinks/ambiance/meal.",q6qK_AWI92TobQPyO2kVXQ,4,7,4,t3XtrBGT8nnncQgTjM-o4w

My partner called and made reservations on November 19 at 9pm. 
The hostess was told that it was my birthday dinner and to make sure that the server knew. 
We get to Javier's and not only do they have us waiting 20 minutes after our reservation but the hostess was some snobby girl who barely acknowledge us probably because we are young. 
We get sat and notice that there was a lot of Latin Grammy directors/crew/etc. we were sat right in the middle of the restaurant but the servers seemed so very attentive to the people to the Latin Grammys that they forgot about us. Seriously? 
*IF YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARENT RICH OR YOU ARE YOUNG, THEN mOST LIKELY
YOU WILL GET SHITTY SERVICE* 
we finally get a server to get our drink order, then we have another server bringing our drinks and then had another server take out food order. Like who are we supposed to tip ? 
We continue our ""dining experience"" and hope that the food is at least good considering that it is considered pricey Mexican food . 
My best friend orders a shrimp quesadilla. She looked past the $30 PRICE FOR A QUESADILLA CONSISTING OF ONE LARGE TORTILLA. MONTEREY CHEESE AND RUBBERY SHRIMP. she clearly wasn't happy but didn't make a complain.
I then order an Antojito platter. 
Not only was the server too rushed to tell me what kind of meat the items came with (because the menu doesn't say) but the mini quesadillas CAME WITH SHRIMP!!!!! THE SERVER NEVER TOLD ME AND I ONLY FOUND OUT UNTIL I BIT INTO IT. I AM ALLERGIC TO SHRIMP AND MY LIPS STARTED SWELLING UP . 
we told one of the servers and HE STILL DARED TO ASK ME IF I WAS REALLY ALLERGIC OR I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT. THE NERVE.....
what's the worst was they just brought me a regular quesadilla with less cheese, no apology, no nothing. AND to think I was excited about celery rating my birthday here. 
We finish eating, the food honestly could've been better and tastier from a hole in the wall off the strip or from Cabo wabo cantina at planet Hollywood .
And for a lower, lower price. 
The server didn't ask how everything was, was just pushing more drinks on us and we just wanted to go. 
We got the check, THEY FORGOT IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY (Which we were told they would bring me a little something and sing for me) but nothing. 
He dropped off the check, picked it up and then made a point that how could a beautiful lady like my best friend be paying for me ! 
MAYBE IF YOU WERE REMINDED THAT IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY OR EVEN ACTUALLY BOTHERED READING MY ID WHEN YOU ASK FOR IT ( which clearly you didn't even read how old I was) but YOU WOULDVE KNOWN WHY MY GIRL BESTFRIEND PAYED FOR MY FOOD. 
We left with an unsettled stomach based on the food and the experience. 
And to top it all off. The check came out to about 125 with taxes and we left well above 20% just to laugh at these servers faces who thought we didn't have money. 
I'm sure they need that 25% tip way more than we did. 
Definitely never coming back here and letting all our friends/family know since this was one of my favorite restaurants before .",QReDlmPEH1gpTO-f_FmiNQ,1,1,1,ONNC0uiYuwb3L5-h5t6emA

The food quality was just mind-blowing. The one thing I look for in restaurants is their ability to blow me away in any of several parts of the dining experience. I don't use this term loosely either. 

The drinks (jalapeno margarita and margarita that had chambord and something else in it) were so perfect. The Seafood nachos with shrimp, guacamole, dungeness crab also blew me away. A must have appetizer. My date and I shared the most tender filet and lobster tail marinated in this incredible garlic, poblano, butter sauce that made it worth the $60 it cost us. Together, the bill including gratuity for 2 cost me $210 which was the most expensive dinner I ever had for 2 people..but it was worth it without any hesitation. Props to our server for being so friendly and chatting with us and helping us decide on our selections. I'm pretty sure his name was Juan.

We walked up without a reservation and did not have to wait for a table.  That was great.  We were quickly greeted with water and chips and salsa.  The salsa was so fresh, and delicious my husband did not even mind the cilantro in it (he usually hates cilantro)  The chips were crunchy and seemed freshly made.

Granted the food is a little expensive for Mexican food, but this is not expensive by Las Vegas standards.  I had the enchilada and taco combo, and I was not disappointed.  The food looked so nice on the plate and tasted even better.  The rice and beans were delicious also.  I had a strawberry margarita and was in heaven!

My DH had the combo with an enchilada, taco and chille relleno.  he loved every bite.  he had two margaritas and really enjoyed them.  Apparently the restaurant is known for their margaritas.  The bartenders were busy making them and from what I could tell, the whole restaurant was happy with them!

2226227,2013-11-19,2,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Pricey--more than Cava and Carlitos, fine dining Mexican in Montecito and SB, respectively. 5 bucks for a small diet Coke seems gratuitous.  I think it's overpriced but truly innovative menu with well-executed traditional dishes as well. 

But it's very good. My verde enchiladas were 22 and perfect. I don't think it's any better than Rosa Mexicano, however. And the chicken enchiladas suiza are 16 or 17 there and you get rice and beans on the side. I don't know how prices at the Aria branch compare to the Newport Beach location, but since I avoid the OC like an STD, I will never know. 

I was at Fashion Island this summer and yes, that's a very pretty place to shop. But other than Laguna, I despise the OC except for the secondhand/designer resale which truly is outstanding both in terms of quality and value. 

But I didn't like anything about Newport Beach, not even the beach and couldn't wait to return to WLA and cross the border back from the Orange Curtain back to civilized Los Angeles. 

The spicy red salsa deserves all the praise it has received from Yelpers. 

I didn't get adventurous with cocktails and in fact, didn't even drink wine. But everyone says their specialty cocktails and various margaritas are noteworthy. 

It's wonderful food but you'll spend more than Rosa Mexicano in NYC or LA and, with a few exceptions (the lamb shank over orzo with the best greens you will ever eat), Montecito's Cava. 

Bartender--Tina, I believe but it could be Tara so I apologize if I have gotten it wrong--is not only beautiful but smart and a great bartender with a great personality.",W83aZrDrYKwycCHB_eOYYg,2,1,4,AR2g3b--Ar9JKZZMMesFhQ

Anyways I'm only giving it two stars because the manager changed our seats after we were seated at a table like Cheesecake Factory and you are basically on top of other people .she was very nice to me and my husband but other than that I would give it zero stars. Let  me start by saying the customer service here sucks and is out  the door . We arrived and basically they made us wait and after the hostess tried to seat us down at a table where it was pretty much you are eating with your neighbors. When we complaint about it and ask for her to change us she said that's all they had with an attitude and a poker face . She said we can go seat by the bar that's when I asked her to get the manager and you can read on the top of this review she was very nice and accommodating. Once we were seated at the new table the waiter was a disaster who took forever to get our order and to bring out the food mind you he didn't even checked on us to tell us anything . I ordered the beef tacos but when they came out it was steak beef not ground beef which was basically raw and he didn't say anything before I ordered that it was steak beef not ground beef . The food isn't that great and they act like is high end and is not . Save your self the trip Tijuana flats is cheaper and better .

2290500,2012-10-29,2,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I have been eagerly anticipating trying this new restaurant, as it is open late, at Aria, and I am a big fan of the Mexican restaurants at MGM properties (e.g. Diego, Border Grill) so I had high expectations.

The decor is similar to Lemongrass, with suspended rope effects and lots of wood. The dim atmosphere is very appealing, I prefer dark to light in a restaurant. The skull-themed chainsaw wood carvings on the East wall are a fantastic touch.

And the food? Some of the best fresh tortilla chips I've ever had, thin but not too thin. Perfect house salsa, again thin but not too thin, medium-ish spice. Amazingly, you can polish off this entire basket (it's inevitable) and not feel like you've ruined your appetite. As with other MGM Mexican spots, ask for the secret Habanero Salsa - the one at Javier's is cooked with a hint of butter, served warm and comes out orange.

Guacamole ($10) - a generous portion, and I prefer Javier's kitchen-made guac to others' tableside versions.
Cabo Azul ($28) - Lobster Enchilada, Chile Relleno w/Dungeness Crab and Shrimp, Bonus Ensenada-style Shrimp Taco, Black Bean dip and Rice. Recommended by our server. Delicious and almost overwhelming in terms of deciding where to start and planning my last bite. A fun mini-buffet of Mexican-style seafood. A winner.
Got to taste the Chicken Picado ($22) as well - very tasty char-broiled chicken flavor.

Cesar, our server, was friendly and made some great menu suggestions. All of the server assistants did a superb job at keeping our drinks and chips topped off.

Excited to try the rest of the menu. LOTS of appealing items on it. It would be easy for me to proclaim that this food is 'overpriced' and give it 4 stars instead of 5, but I think if you choose to eat here you know exactly what you're getting into. If you want 'cheap' Mexican food you probably know exactly where to get it. (My 'cheap' Mexican spot is Tacos La Mexicana on Decatur & Twain: $5.49 for 4 Tacos, Rice, Beans and a Drink!)

I ended up ordering an additional crunchy beef taco that was so tough, so I ended eating half of it with a fork. However, we also ordered the skirt steak fajitas that were flavorful and delicious. The menu is lengthy and diverse, but somewhat overwhelming. I would recommend staying away from the tacos and taking advantage of any of their other items which seemed to be better.",F9vObO7mk-dMBu-0ZV4EFA,1,0,3,STxvZcq3gZc9ykBdiOb2Fg

TIPS
Javier's - serve the food hot. All our dishes were cool.
If you are going to pour me a Prosecco because your sweet wines are non-existent, please leave me the little bottle I purchased. About 1/3 of what we paid for went back to the kitchen and maybe someone back there had a toast with it. Weird.
The seafood trip of enchiladas needs help. The crab one was good, the shrimp and scallop one could have been anything, there was no taste.
Our server we had that night needs retraining to be in the people industry.

For the prices, we would choose elsewhere. Just too many other choices in Vegas to settle on barely a 3 star experience.",is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,5,1,3,bsZWkA5Rzn09quNAxB-6sQ

The salsa is fresh, you can taste every ingredient while being in perfect harmony with the others & boasting just the right amount of heat. Really- it's THAT good. Hubby and I ordered the ""Tablita"" (sp?) for two. It's a trio of meats. Carne Assad we both will order again, so flavorful, carnitas, very flavorful but a little dry & chicken that was nothing special. The meal arrives on a plank of wood accompanied with rice (just ok, ho-hum) beans (so good we had to ask the waiter why they were so good), guacamole (yummy & fresh) onions, peppers, carrots etc... The concept is you make your own tacos with the tortillas. Such a quality meal & a value for two people. Plenty for both of us. Hub ordered 3 margarita's.

Our server was very absent minded, she didn't really seem to be actually paying attention when we ordered, looking around the restaurant.

Service was amazing (thank you Olivia) and the quality of great food paired with unique twists on margaritas enjoyed in a beautiful setting was a combination of perfection! Yes, by Mexican standards its a little bit more expensive than a typical restaurant but a solid splurge.
The drinks add up quickly though at $15 each and they're small in size but not lacking in taste or a generous pour.
We had everything! 2 shrimp cocktails (big Mexican reds), guacamole (light and fluffy), quest fundido (a bit to chipotleish for my taste), the Javier chop salad and had ordered the Shrimp ceviche but they were out of (?).
Followed up the plethora of apps with a Bone in Ribeye and a Filet/Lobster combo-all delicious!
You'd think that be it but no! Room to share a fried dulce du leche fried ice cream!
Salsa is the real deal-perfectly balanced!
It was a treat and this with 5 margaritas came to a total of $297 (gratuity exclusive)... With a comp for $300-we did our job maximizing its value!!

BEST dining experience I've had in Vegas thus far.

Ok so this was Thanksgiving weekend so naturally it was super packed and wait was relatively reasonable as such (30+ mins). The front desk ladies were a little snooty but I guess that's natural given the hotel they are located in (perhaps its their assumption of uber-rich people 24-7 and my gf and I weren't exactly dressed-to-impress haha).

After being seated, we were immediately greeted by our waiter. Super friendly guy, great attitude and huge smile. Probably received a huge tip from the previous patrons!  Throughout the entire time, this guy came by and asked how we were doing, how the food came out and was cracking jokes.  Amazingly attentive and great sense of humor!

Ok so in terms of water, they come by plenty to make sure you are sufficiently hydrated.  I love this and always notice it when an establishment fails to provide me a full glass of water on a consistent basis, even to the extent that when I'm eating at a restaurant that does NOT do this well, I always ask for TWO glasses of water when they initially provide it!

As for the food, I had the seafood enchiladas...HOLY SHIT these were good.  I mean, beyond what I thought it would be. One lobster, one crab (I think?) and one shrimp. Whatever the sauce or seasonings used were, they must have been made with unicorn dust or cocaine or both. Even without the sauce, the freshness of ingredients and seasonings brought out the food's natural flavors beyond that of the sauce. A rather natural blend of flavors made for an extremely memorable food experience.

I forget what we had for dessert but it was like some vanilla ice cream with flan?  Something super sugary but equally delightful w.r.t. taste. Again, sprinkled with either unicorn dust, cocaine or both, I just remember it blowing my mind completely.

---Overall---

Service: A+  Our waiter rocked. Service Game on point~

Food: A+ Unicorn Dust and Cocaine I kid you not...

Atmosphere: A. I didn't care for bar atmosphere so much but we were their for dining and the dining area was superb..

Value: A+. Again, BEST dining experience I've had in Vegas thus far. Value exceeds price paid.",-kkq4fbhtnbnYAPpxpnvHg,0,0,5,n9dBfSATf_rKNEnsZcIbiQ

We rolled into Vegas last night without making any prior reservations, but our party of 4 was seated promptly even though it was Christmas night. 

The decorations were very dark featuring chainsaw wooden art in the seating area. Our waiter was very knowledgable and told us about the art's representation of life through the passage of time. Speaking of our waiter, he was very attentive and extremely helpful as their menu selection is great. 

Yes, they're guacamole was awesome but pretty much everything on their menu is just as awesome. I got the chance to try their carnitas - it was slightly crispy on the outside and it was cooked so tenderly. The sauce it was served with was cilantro and limey and on point. Yum!

I ordered the cabo azul which features the star seafood entrees which include the lobster enchilada, crab and shrimp chile relleno, and the shrimp taco. Our waiter advised me to eat the shrimp taco first because of the coleslaw, and I was glad he told me so. It was refreshing and the fried shrimps were succulent and yummy. Lobster enchiladas were covered with this spicy green salsa that paired so nicely with the cool sour cream. The chile relleno was just okay, but I think it's just because chile relleno is generally not my most favorite Mexican option. 

Yes, this place is priced well above traditional Mexican options, but it's Vegas, the food is quality, the service is great, and it's a place worth visiting before your fantastic night out.",2rcsjlkUKJHetytXh8PRdw,0,0,4,taNImNWAZRg-M-c_lHMW6A

Can't stand mexican restaurants that serve non lean meat.  I also tried my friend's skirt steak.  Very tender, almost to the point that it was soft like fast food Chinese beef.  Kinda freaked me out a little, buy hey, what can you do??

As a local, I always seem to have low expectations of strip restaurants.  But, I was totally surprised.  Prices are decent, but they are well below strip prices.  (Minus the carne asada for $50)  I am actually very curious to see what that tastes like.  But I am willing to pay more since the restaurant is so eye catching, yet subtle at the same time.

Top new date spot on the strip!  5 stars all the way.",jX7n6KfNZ22kBh6AHhxRbA,6,3,5,Uz1ns-4kxbXTHbOCwuNsYw

Don't get me wrong - great ambiance. Well executed food. Small portions, and as great as the food is, $27 for a quesadilla still makes no sense to me. 

Coworkers ordered combo plates and I ordered a salad.  

While we all enjoyed our food, we weren't raving about anything we ate except for the cornbread dessert we had. There are so many great restaurants in Vegas...so, I think there are better options if you're gonna throw down $100/person on a meal and drinks.

That said, this is a great place to have some margaritas before dinner.  Sit at the bar...have some chips and salsa and then move to another spot.",cii2zKIwGuKjidepp6bQAg,1,0,3,r6hwrExEzpSlDWD7LJszZA

For vegetarians it is a bit pricey. We eat out a lot, not huge eaters (large portions) but do expect not to leave hungry.

The waiter did suggest veggie fajitas (not on the menu $24) not too bad, great selection of veggies. I would say high end but again my husband eats once a day 6 feet tall, 145 pounds, works out a lot and eats a lot if veggies...had hoped for more.

We did decide to indulge in drinks, I had the St. Francis Merlot ($12) very full bodied and full glass. My husband had the margarita ($12) very full and good tasting.

They offer two desserts:flan and fried ice cream, we did the ice cream. Funny - this was a larger portion, lightly fried (not heavy like some restaurants make) ($8) - fun to share - can share with four people!

My favorite part of the whole evening was the chips and salsa. Damn that salsa was good and it kept getting hotter and hotter each time they brought it out. 

The guacamole was nothing to write home about - bland and tasted like it was just made. My personal preference is guacamole that has had time to let the flavors meld together. My carne asada quesadilla was also bland although the steak was tender. The quesadillas at Taco Bell contain more flavor than this one. The house margarita was eh and it took forever for us to finish our drinks because they just weren't that good. None of us loved our dishes.

Lets start with the good:
- The decor of the place is absolutely stunning. Even considering that it's in Aria, Javier's look and feel of the restaurant is very modern and beautiful. 
- The margaritas are perfect. Made with only top shelf tequila, you can assure that your $15 per drink won't go to waste.

Now to the great:
- The service is on point. Filling my glass and refilling my sauce as soon as it's almost empty, and explained the overwhelming menu very well.
- The sauce is redonkulous! Has a nice kick to it and isn't the ordinary blended sauce you will find in tex-mex establishments. Has a lot of flavor and chunks of great tomatoes in there.

And finally, the awesome:
- My table did a little family style ordeal, so I was able to try a variety of dishes. Lets just say I wasn't disappointed by any of them, and each dish has it's own very authentic flavor. The seafood is very fresh, the meats are cooked perfectly, and there is some sort of latino flair in every dish that really puts it over the top.

Dimly lit and intimate, this restaurant lives up to the hype.  And of course, they have a killer margarita menu full of all kinds of exotic flavors.

Here's what we ordered:
We each had a margarita including one that was laced with jalepenos.  The margaritas are both power packed and unique.  They take some time to create but they are worth the wait.
We started with the ceviche de camaron and of course the complimentary chips and salsa.  The table salsa is delectable and we gobbled it in a hurry with our drinks.  The ceviche is super rich in flavor and chunky.  Very tasty.  The serving size is enough to feed 2-3 people comfortably without being overstuffed.
For dinner, I ordered the Pollo a la Chipotle.  Warning - if you've loaded up on the chips/salsa and anything else to eat before this, you will feel SUPER full.  This entree is delicious but it's seriously filling and rich in flavor.  The sauce is incredibly creamy and there is tons of it to lather the chicken in.

I passed on dessert because I was super full but I wouldn't doubt that it would be tasty!  Bring someone special here, you can enjoy a lovely candlelit dinner and some good eats while you're at it.  Sit near the door/windows and also people watch at the casino.

The beef was amazing and the vegetables were cooked so good! What we also liked here was that the dishes that we ordered contained a little or no cheese so the food was not greasy, heavy, or unhealthy.  Expensive, but I would considered it as a top-level restaurant. Also, the service was very good: clean, attentive, and prompt. One reviewer said he or she was not impressed with the taste, and I am very surprised to see such a review. Perhaps, a person doesn't like the Mexican cuisine, but in my opinion it tasted amazing! Also, this place is reviewed as not kids friendly. We visited the restaurant with our 10-month baby and were given a cozy, quieter place which we enjoyed and had no complaints about. The restaurant warns at the front desk that there is no place to store strollers, so maybe this is the reason why it's considered as a not kids friendly place.

2759681,2015-04-03,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I was in town a night prior to my group arriving and was looking for a ""fun"" environment with some interesting food. I was walking by Javier's and the place just pulled me in.

As I was dining alone, I was more than happy to take a seat at the bar. Unfortunately, the bar was packed, as was the dining room. I told the hostess I would wait for the bar as I did not want to tie up seating. Just as I said this, a server had cleared a small booth and insisted I sit down and enjoy myself.

Kara, my server, immediately came over and offered some chips while I checked out the menu. I asked her for some recommendations and then pondered my choices while she went to retrieve my margarita. The margarita arrived and was exceptional. Kara took my order and I munched on some fresh chips with a refreshing and flavorful homemade salsa.

When Kara came back to take my order, I asked her if it was possible to tweak the Quesadilla de Mariscos. She ran to the kitchen and to my delight, the chef was more than amicable about my request (not exactly common today, especially in a high volume restaurant). The order arrived and it looked and tasted great. The portion was more than enough for one person and could have easily fed a couple ( there was plenty left on my plate, only because I could not eat another bite). Texture was perfect and the flavors were incredible.

I was completely full but not ready to move just yet as I was really enjoying the people watching. I asked my server if she needed the table and she told me to relax and enjoy myself. I ordered another drink and stayed for about 10-15 minutes to enjoy it without any pressure to turn over the table.

Price is a bit expensive for Mexican food, but well worth it, at least in my eyes. I don't mind paying if I am getting exceptional service and food, and both where delivered here.

Just an additional note about my server as I hope management takes the time to read this. Kara truly went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and kept company during my meal since I was dining alone. Her section was packed, but she came over numerous time to ""chat"" with me and make sure I felt comfortable there. Being a former food and beverage director as well as general manager of a restaurant, I know how hard it can be to find ""all stars,"" of which she is truly one.

Just a great overall experience and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Las Vegas that would like to enjoy some serious and inventive Mexican cuisine.",hCRWlhOt3M-qFOAaMn2gFQ,1,0,5,7UGEs2bFqQqkCErCOYUeQQ

This place does not disappoint in that department! Crispy, extra crunchy chips and very flavorful, spicy salsa. 

One meal was seafood nachos, the next seafood quesadillas, and lastly seafood enchilada trio.  Yes, seafood galore, I know. But it's fresh and tasty. The bar location is perfect to grab a bite or sit in the dining area and relax. 

I don't understand why some people think this place is pricey. We pay these prices in Chicago. The portions seemed normal to me, not small. Perhaps it's just various demographics, but I recommended this place to anyone who would listen and even to some who wouldn't!

After waiting over 45 minutes for our dinner entrees and unable to locate our waiter, we approached the  manager, who was extremely rude to ask if there was a problem with our order.

I believe strongly in giving a good tip when it is warranted, but due to the inadequate service provided by our waiter, it should have been our option to decide what amount to give to him.

Our guests were able to pick from a soup or salad, one entree, and choice of flan or fried ice cream for dessert.

Our service was great..... two servers for our group. They were on top of everything, and no one ever felt like they were waiting on something for too long. Drinks were flowing so our guests were extremely happy.

Their drinks are not the same and services staff is horrible.

We ordered a side of the guacamole to go with our chips and salsa which was so fresh and made perfectly. We both ordered the carne fajitas and they were delicious! We've been to the Newport and Irvine location, but our visit at the Vegas location has been, by far, our favorite of the 3. The food at Javiers at all locations have consistently been amazing, but what exceeded our expectations at the Vegas location was the service and the interaction with management. Our server, Ovidio, provided exceptional service. The manager, Charles, also spoke to our table and found out we were in town celebrating my birthday and made sure to send a dessert to our table. Little gestures like that go a long way and leave a lasting impression. We go to Vegas about 1-2 times a year, and are coming back in April.

First impression:  love the booths!  Super comfy.  They have a private dining room that looks like it can seat up to 12...oh my that room looks fancy!   Romantic mood overall.  Good for date night.

Being from San Diego, I have eaten a ton of Mexican food in my life.  Granted, I KNOW I'm on the strip.  I know that for sure.  I hate even mentioning price in reviews (unless it's in a good way) because it's on the strip, so I should know what I'm getting into.  I just think some of the menu was a lot higher than it could have been.  I reiterate, I knew this going into a strip restaurant, so I can't be that booty hurt about it.

The appetizer was just, meh.  We got the sampler plate.  The best part was the shrimp quesadilla.  The empanada was no bueno.  Maybe I'm used to the little old lady in San Diego who makes them in her house and fries them fresh right before we pick up, so honestly it's not even a fair comparison.  

I got a shrimp salad that was very fresh and tasty.  My husband got a $52 carne asada plate.  He LOVED the black beans and roasted pepper.  The chips and salsa were decent.

Margaritas were yummy, but honestly, I don't think I've met a margarita I DIDN'T like (premixed Jose Cuervo included, hahaha).

All in all, great atmosphere and a good choice if you're going to see a show in Aria and want to stay in the same vicinity.  Great for date night.  Would I go out of my way to go here again?  Not sure, maybe just for margaritas and snacks.  But great if you're staying at Aria and don't want to leave property.",W_pPF_bKVNtA8m7lRqdZdw,4,3,4,d_OHmDHivLmwo6sxsTpWIg

Prices are high - and there is an additional fee tacked on (couldn't tell if is was a partial resort fee but definitely and extra tax) and soda is served in small bottles so like every other Vegas restaurant wanting more than one pop costs you. 

I had the 2 shredded beef crispy taco lunch with refried beans (lard is used in them) and rice, with a side of guac (not listed on menu so no idea of price until bill comes) and the husband had chile verde (came with side of rice/beans and his choice of corn or flour tortillas-he chose the latter). My tacos were yummy, the guac was good (not spicy and a good contrast to the spicy salsa that is served with the chips) and the husband enjoyed his meal.  
My taco lunch was $18 and his chile verde was around $24. Each Diet Coke (3 in total I think) were $4 each and then add the guac and service fee and lunch was $75 before tip.

We ordered 
- Jalapeño Margaritas 
- Queso Fundido
- Camarenos Rancheros
- Beef Fajitas

First of all, this margarita was wonderfully spicy, and delicious...if it wasn't mid day, I could have easily had another one...or two. The Queso Fundido is perfectly melted Monterey Jack cheese with sautéed onion, mushroom, and pasilla chile. It is then topped with chorizo and chipotle chile, and corn tortillas to wrap it up...so delicious. The Camarones Rancheros is one of Javier's most popular seafood dishes...there is a creaminess as the prawns are sautéed with garlic butter, but the dish is not at all greasy, it is surprisingly light, well-balanced, and refreshing with tomatos and cilantro. The Beef Fajitas at Javier's are some of the best I have experienced...oh, and the guacamole--so exciting!...tasty, with texture and bite.

All the staff was friendly and kind. I will come back to Javier's soon to taste other options to pair with my Jalapeños Margarita.

Walking through the Aria Hotel & Casino floor to get to Javier's is not a bad experience either. Aria is always well manicured for the seasonal occasions and seems almost smoke-free in the air. 

p.s. I paid $13 to valet with the new fees in effect.

2975995,2015-07-15,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's is one of my favorite restaurants to hit while on the strip!  The ambience of Javier's is classy but at the same time live and full of energy.  This is a great place to go with big group to enjoy a dinner before a night out on the strip.  

Although it is quite expensive for Mexican food, I have never been let down by any dish I have ordered here.  My go to order is La Tablita (para dos personas). Prepare your own tacos with your choice of $50 carne asada, carnitas or grilled natural chicken at your table. Served on a wooden platter with all the condiments: arroz, refritos, jalapenos, salsa fresca, guacamole,
rajas, grilled green onions and your choice of warm tortillas.

This platter is enough to fill up 2 people easily and brings the cost to $25 dollars per person for the main entree.  

I HIGHLY recommend ordering some Ceviche de Ahi and Guacamole as appetizers for the table.  The guacamole is made right in front of you and is absolutely fantastic.  Javier's is known for their notoriously good alcoholic beverages as well.  My favorites on the menu include:  margarita de granada (pomegranate), margarita de pepino (cucumber) and margarita de jalapeno.  You can also order from an assortment of martinis (although I am not a big martini drinker) I hear that they are excellent.  

Be prepared to spend a bit of money if you come to Javier's an are ordering appetizers, an entree and drinks but I assure you, it is well worth it.  I am in love with the food and ambience of this restaurant.",K46q0_b75J_-oJ-wHZ13lQ,3,2,5,d_VhdHmBGU6uSiVOASVigQ

The guacamole was bland, and not made table side a la Dos Caminos, or Rosa Mexicano. $12??? I don't think so.  We waited almost 45 mins for our food, only to have 3 of the 5 meals served. 5 mins later, mine arrived. After mentioning my concerns to two managers (in suits), the 5th and final meal arrived--lukewarm. Sadly we barely received an apology...other than ""the kitchen was behind"". For $30+ entrees, I don't believe anyone would accept this type of service. What made it worse was management didn't offer any type of goodwill gesture despite our gently provided comments.

In depth: Have eaten here twice and both times have been quality. Made a reservation last Wednesday night on the phone for the two of us. Arrive on time and the hostess cannot find a reservation under my name. Apparently the gent that answered the phone never put my reservation in the system. Rather than make us wait they did the right thing and got us sat immediately. 

The service was prompt and they were on top of it. Seriously brought their A-Game and they worked well as a team. One would drop, one would clear, one would check on us etc. Was good to see a team properly trained. Or waiter was very professional and made two great suggestions for us. My lady ordered the Carnitas and I ordered a seafood mix that included crab. We also ordered some guacamole as an appetizer. 

The guacamole was solid. This is a creamy guacamole and they definitely use sour cream in the mix. Could taste it. Was not prepared table side like other high-end restaurants do. Might have been too busy to consider doing that? Was quality though. Kudos. 

The entrees were delivered with perfect timing. the first thing you will say is ""Wow!"" The proportions are massive and the presentation is over the top. They are served on very large plates and quite colorful. Really no complaints on the carnitas. They were amazing and cooked perfectly. My seafood dish was delicious and very filling! 

Was no room for desert. I was in a food coma and struggled to regain my composure as we had to go meet some friends for drinks and table service at a nightclub at the Wynn. My advice, eat here if you know you will have a chance to rest afterwards. Mexican food is heavy and will weigh you down. 

I would have given them 5 stars if not for the reservation hick-up. Love the room and the decor. Has great action at the bar. This is a quality high-end Mexican restaurant and I look forward to going back soon!!",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,0,0,4,CVSaGMxoExz1QtQ8VhXKJw

The vibe is very cool with a very interesting decor. It was dark, not too loud and overall very cozy. 

We chose to sit at the bar and were we greeted and placed our drink orders very quickly. The bartender made our delicious drinks (Javier's Margaritas) right away and took our appetizer order of chips and guacamole. It came out quickly and was delicious.  The chips and salsa with the guacamole is a must order. 

For diner, my wife ordered the carnitas and I ordered the enchiladas with chicken. Both were good but both were served at room temperature. If they would have been hot, we would have no complaints. 

Overall, the drinks, food and service were all good. If you are staying in the Aria or across the street at the Vdara, I recommend giving it a try.",47qilaS4xZ56n088herclA,0,0,4,9o6eL9MHCmGDyUNyQsrlbA
3048949,2014-02-18,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Probably one of the more affordable restaurants in Aria. But with that said, you can expect to spend roughly $40-50 per person if you stick with a main entree and one alcoholic drink. With our $50 beverage and dining credit, I did some Yelpy research and figured that we could make like thieves and get away with an upscale dining experience for 2 for a grand total of $9.

At Javier's, the best meal to get is ""La Tablita"". You won't regret it. It can easily feed three adults, maybe even four. For $46, you get ample servings of rice, beans, rajas (roasted peppers), pico de gallo, guacamole, carnitas, chicken, steak, and tortillas. We knew we did good when we got lots of drooly stares as people passed us and got seated at their tables. 

The carne asada steak was seriously the best steak I've had in my life thus far. Thin and smoky and juicy. The chips and salsa are also complimentary. They don't offer it straight up but ask for the ""green"" salsa (also complimentary). It's a tomatillo salsa - spicy and sour and sweet.

We felt welcomed from the moment we entered and got a huge quiet booth across from the casino floor.  The menu was comprehensive, and included all my favorites.  I only wish I had been hungrier at the time, and I would have gone for the Azul platter, but I chose Shrimp tacos and was rewarded with the some of the best ones I have had.  First though, came a delicious generous Margarita, light and refreshing made with Silver Patron and Grand Marnier, and just a squeeze of lime, no syrupy mix.  My husband got the ribs in mole, and we were informed by the attentive waiter that the ""Mole master"" had made the sauce.  It was rich and subtle, a natural accompaniment to the tender and meaty ribs.  The rice was so good, more like sushi rice than the usual Spanish rice, that we ate it all, and I even devoured the authentic black beans.  Five bus and wait people brought us water, drinks, and food in fast succession.
We also really enjoyed the beautiful wood carving on the wall that tells the story of the Popol Vuh, the Mexican creation myth.  The dark trees and ""Day of the Dead"" skeletons completed the restrained and elegant ambience.  I am looking forward to returning here soon!",ID7ccpPgEZ-BdqO0lSFqnQ,0,0,5,tofxFOhOlgXnaPeYNTjV6w
3129901,2013-11-10,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javiers Mexican Food at: ARIA RESORT

Nice spacious surrounding, modern decor, 
dim lighting for ambience, dark wood and comfy dark brown leather seating areas for an intimate setting, but an extremely noisy environment, it was hard to speak without shouting. They brought out the chips & salsa before filling our water glasses or giving us as much as a single menu.
We asked a server if we could get some water and that's all that we got, not even a single ICE CUBE!
Our waiter came over to take our order and noticed that we didn't even have menu's.  
I asked the waiter and a server twice for some ice for our water before finally receiving any. The margaritas were very small approx. 8oz. after they add a ton of ice (how ironic) and is served in one size only, extremely disappointing for an upscale mexican restaurant, surprisingly my margarita was loaded with ICE CUBES!  The food was good, not great. The best part was the salsa, but make sure you order the ICE water first. 

Overview:
Poor Service, Expensive Food,
small portions, both the food and the size of the 8oz. margaritas.
BYOI- Bring Your Own Ice (unless you order a margarita).
Loud, noisey environment. I wouldn't recommend bringing your date here if you're looking for a little peace & quiet.
Great Chip's & Salsa though...

Bottomline: 
Go to Willy & Jose's over at SAM'S TOWN,  (AYCE) ALL you can eat Taco's and ALL you can drink margaritas for only $10 Sun-Thurs.
YES, I did say ALL YOU CAN DRINK MARGARITAS!

3141349,2018-03-31,4,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Located inside the beautiful Aria Hotel & Casino you will find this fine dining Mexican restaurant Javier's. Last week I had some family in town that was staying at the Vdara hotel which is basically right next door to Aria. Majority of the party all agreed on wanting a good place that offered Mexican food on their last night in Las Vegas. With being so close to Aria I thought to myself well what better opportunity then now to schedule a reservation at Javier's. 

I called into the MLife reservation line and was told that the next available reservation wasn't until 10:30 PM and at the time I called it was only around 8:15PM (ish). That wasn't going to fly with a bunch of hungry people but something told me to just try and do a walk in and yeah they were able to get us seated in not even less than 30 minutes. I thought this was odd especially because you would've thought that they'd offered better service to an MLife member over the phone...  

Upon arrival we were kindly greeted and let the hostess know that we had literally just made reservations and were offered to check out the bar area until the table was ready. Half of our party went to wonder around and gamble and the remaining stayed at got some drinks and little bites to eat. The Jalapeno margarita was highlighted by one of the bartenders as one of their most popular drinks so we started with a round of those and wow they were delicious! In addition to the margaritas we also ordered the ""Trio de Ceviche"" which gives you a choice of either Camaron, Pulpo, Pescado or Ahi.. We selected everything but the Pulpo. Now ceviche is one of my favorite dishes and I have to be honest it was just okay.. I really didn't get that over the top taste and have had it at places a lot less fancier and it was better.. My aunt and uncle also agreed but by this time our table was ready! 

Once we were finally seated our waiter came over who by the way was very nice and did a great job with giving us some recommendations. For me I have been on this Pescatarian diet for almost 6 months so I asked about what were some of the best seafood dishes. I ended up getting the ""Fideo Del Mar"" which is a Seafood linguine with shrimp and Dungeness crab in a spicy tomato cream sauce, topped with a wild Mexican white prawn and a fresh, wild scallop, garnished with Cojita cheese and green onion. I would give the dish 4/5 it was definitely good! 

Overall I would have to say that the experience was great. Customer service can really make or break the experience and so I battled with going with 3 or 4 stars but the service from the hostess to the bartender to our server was all great and the average of 3 stars for the food bumped them up a star. I say an average of 3 stars food wise based of the ""so so"" answers of everybody at the table. We can all agree that it's pretty pricey for what you get in actuality.. However I always have to argue the fact of location location location!! I'm convinced that I should possibly return and give them another try to give me that WOW factor on the food side.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,5,4,4,4puJkoK-xDpcvlvuK4IV5g

The service was giving each other high fives and talking to one another in front of the table. They went to take the food without asking if we were done, I had to stop them and ask for a box. Lastly, the music was so loud! We couldn't talk and hear one another or your own thoughts. When we asked if they could turn down the music the server rudely stated that they don't do that here. When we asked someone else they stated when they are busy they turn the music louder. We were shocked! To top it all off they gave us a pen to sign our checks with a pen from another hotel on the strip not even an MGM property. Shows the attention to detail and the quality of place it is!

#1 best Chips and Salsa in my opinion in Las Vegas period.

I have been to every Mexican Restaurant in town.  Javier's is a little pricier than most Mexican restaurants but in my opinion well worth it.  If you are debating between Mexican Restaurants on the strip it blows Border Grill,and Diablos out of the water on every level.  If you are a Mexican food lover then i will say this is a must for you to try!

I have eaten here many times and have always had excellent professional service and a great experience.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has the nicest mexican ambiance and decor i have seen. 

The Food is excellent and what is really great about this place is that they have a lot of very sophisticated items on the menu that you don't typically find in most Mexican restaurants.   One dish thats different and I make sure somebody orders at the table  is the Camarones al mojo de ajo, or garlic shrimp. Another stand out is the Chile Verde special which is a pork dish and is most excellent.  I actually have them turn this into Chile Verde enchiladas when i go - a modification i highly recommend! :) The best appetizer is the chicken taquitos or the steak nachos.  The main dishes come with rice and beans and you have your choice of black/white refried or regular beans served in a cup.  Both are delicious! ( I prefer the white)

No matter what you select for your meal you will be very pleased.  They use all fresh ingredients and the kitchen definitely knows what they are doing.  Food comes out hot and perfectly cooked every time.

The meats we had were all unique in taste, very good marinades and were cooked to perfection. The beef was perfect, pink in the middle and seared on the outside, pork was perfectly seasoned and crisp on the outside too. The chicken, moist and grilled perfectly.

Make no mistake, Javier's is probably one of the more pricey Mexican restaurants in town. Average plate runs upwards of $30 but don't expect to eat for less at a sit-down restaurant on the strip let alone Aria. The menu is extensive with a large selection of seafood entrees and vegetarian dishes. There really is something for everyone and the combo plates allow you to sample a wide variety of dishes. I recommend the stuffed relleno peppers and guacamole, the lobster enchiladas are also extremely popular. On a side note: no free refills on soft drinks, $6 for a small 11 ounce bottle. SMH!

Rest assured your money is going somewhere: the restaurant. Javier's is gorgeous. Big props to their interior designer. The white stone with dark wood, leather tables,
massive wood carvings and a beautiful bar all come together to make it one of the best looking restaurants on the strip. The restaurant is huge, probably the biggest in City Center and you can see the attention to detail in every square inch.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,4,2,4,NAfiLf5JQ_DF0VB98T7pxw

As soon as we were seated I felt like our waiter didn't have the time of day us. He was rushing us through our meal, even though there was nobody waiting to be seated. In fact at the end of our meal, my husband asked to see the dessert menu and the waiter gave us our bill instead. Then when we asked him for a second time to see the dessert menu, he proceeded to verbally tell us the desserts. Maybe that was his way of telling us not to order dessert because the desserts are terrible. 

For a restaurant of Javier's caliber it was a disappointment to see that they only had two mediocre desserts on their menu; deep fried ice cream and flan. Where were the churros and dulce de leche concoctions? Nonetheless, we shouldn't have ordered dessert because it was awful! Our dessert was described as 'deep fried ice cream covered in corn flakes' and we ended up getting bad quality store bought ice cream covered in corn flakes and plated in a stale deep fried shell. Horrible!

Our entrees were okay. I ended up getting the vegetarian enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and my husband got the cheese enchiladas with adobo sauce. Both were good, but nothing special so I don't see why they were $$$. Also, I don't want to be a prude but in a restaurant that is going to charge so much for a couple of enchiladas I'd expect to see beautifully plated entrees, but instead we were served NFK (nonfunctional garnishes) on our enchiladas in the form of canned olives and slices of red onion. Weird!

Overall, run of the mill Mexican food that can be found elsewhere for half of the price so don't bother dressing up and wasting your time coming to Javier's.",xwIeGfv2NAhq9Kofn5qQmg,2,2,3,lnEb3n2nJJjovpGYEkc_5Q

Highly highly overpriced. You can get better quality, larger quantity servings at any whole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The prices here are reallllly high for Mexican food. And i mean REALLY.  
Other than the prices, we had to wait 2 hours to get seated. Not cool when you are starving. The hostesses were pretty rude when asking them if there is any way we can get seated sooner since we had a party of 11. My brother also burned his hand pretty badly on a hot plate. The servers brought the plates which are really hot, and after my brother grabs it and burns his hand pretty bad the server laughs and says ""oh ya it's a little hot"". He did not take that lightly since he was in pain. Not cool again. The only good thing I can honestly say about this restaurant was the cocktails. Very very good drinks at a decent price. 
Overall, I had a pretty negative experience here from the hostesses, to the servers, to a family member being burned and being highly overcharged for ok food.

3353128,2016-02-06,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Psychedelic decor, strong margaritas, attentive service, and healthy unhealthy food make Javier's a true Strip standout and a place worthy of repeat visits. The Javier's Margarita is strong and tasty - have a few and you just might sleep all the way home on your return flight to wherever you come from. The free chips come with a fresh salsa that packs a punch. The taco, enchilada, and relleno combo manages to be filling but not that ""I can't believe I ate all of that gloppy cheese"" kind of filling. The queso fundido and ceviche are good starters - although the ahi ceviche was a bit bland - and the corn cake with vanilla ice cream is a unique way to close the meal.

Service is attentive and very professional - as it should be for any spendy restaurant where prices far exceed normal Mexican fare. Last, but certainly not least: the restaurant's decor and design are out of this world and worthy of note. The tied rope chandelier (of sorts) over the bar would impress any badge seeking, knot tying Boy Scout, but the real piece de resistance is the intricate/disturbing/amazing wooden full wall installation that seems to be about the perils of colonialism. Edgy in a ""what restaurant would actually take this risk?"" sort of way. The indigenous (Aztec) wooden figures, the Spanish armada ship, the dia de los muertos skulls, it is not for the faint of heart and incredibly intricate and beautiful.

Wait, who am I kidding? it's the margaritas people!

Our 3 visits in a row is certainly a testament to their margaritas. If you're a margarita snob, this place certainly caters to your tastes: 14 different margarita combinations on the menu made with tequilas ranging from the affordable El Jimador to high end Casa Noble and even an organic one called Azunia!

Aiyayay. We just had to try several. The Casa one comes in cheapest at $13 and you can definitely taste the more grassy tones and sourness of the drink. Opt to pay the premium price of $18 for a well made Javier's: Patron Reposado, Grand Marnier and Triple sec. This was a smoother experience overall, but if you've been to Tommy's Mexican restaurant in SF, you'd probably say a margarita with Grand Marnier is essentially not an authentic one. 

They also have fun flavors like the Jalapeno for a spicy kick, the Tamarindo and even a Paloma made with Casa Noble, if you're not in the margarita mood. 

The complimentary crispy chips and red salsa with just enough kick kept my hand busy digging into the chips bowl. I love that I can carry a conversation here without having to scream to my partner and the service is always fantastic whether we sit at the bar or in one of the cozy leather booths.

We made a reservation for Saturday night since we were in Vegas for my bachelorette party. We often eat at the Newport location and we expected to have such a different experience. Our server only checked in with us once after we ordered and the was to tell us that our food was almost ready to come in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later one of our dishes came out. We waited to eat for the rest of my party to get food and ended up waiting 5 more minutes for 2 more plates. The remainder of our food came out 5 minutes after that. To make things worse, the food that was brought out later was cold, almost like it was sitting around waiting to be brought out. I split the La Tableta with another friend and it did taste good, but none of the other 5 girls liked their food. It tasted horrible. The manager came over and apologized but really seemed like he could care less. Later on that night one of my friends got really sick (before we even started drinking) and barely made it to the cab before she threw up her shrimp dish. 

Although I love Javier's in Orange County, I will not be going to the Vegas one again. Do yourself a favor and visit a different restaurant with warmer and better food while in Vegas",eHUcyH8HttMJcO_evYqywA,2,0,1,j4o8uFIX7UZbJz9b64YC4g

Served food at the bar in order to sell more drinks. Have never been so disappointed with customer service, Javier's hospitality is terrible, Staff needs to learn how to treat customers.

3497333,2016-11-30,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I've been here twice and I have to tell you, it just gets better and better with each visit. 

Initially, my mother, sister and I came here about 3 years ago on the recommendation of a friend we made at the pool, who said that this is probably one of the better restaurants in Las Vegas. He was NOT wrong, whatsoever. My mother and I ordered the Tablet, my sister something I can't remember, and it was such a beautiful, delicious experience with great service. Fast forward 3 years later, my group of friends and I were deciding on where to go for our fancy group dinner and I immediately remembered how fantastic Javier's was - they looked it up and agreed. Long story short, EVERYONE was super impressed, but long story is still below for your reading pleasure.

Located inside the newer Aria hotel, Javier's is straight on the first floor, not too deep into the casio. Unassuming from outside, you're greeted by a very kind hostess who takes you to your table. I do really suggest making a reservation, because you will wait, especially on a weekend dinner. We got our table immediately, since we were a larger party, and had a couple moments to really take in the restaurant and see if there was anything we'd like to drink which is always appreciated.

The ambiance of Javier's alone is enough to dine here, even if the food was mediocre (its not). Dim lighting throughout the high, arched ceilings, accentuate the sensual atmosphere. Architecturally, its very Spanish Hacienda with white walls, dark wood furniture, comfy warm leather booths. The bar in the middle is slightly modern, and there is a gorgeous, giant wall - handmade metal art, depicting skulls and a variety of beautiful art. Skim through the photos, it doesn't even do it justice how COOL IT IS. Everyone in our group was marvelling about how beautiful it is.

Service is fabulous as well. Our server was incredibly patient in answering all of our questions, especially with a group of 17. He was never pushy about upselling but did suggest things that could enhance our experience. We received our beverages quickly (considering there were at least 10 cocktails) and our food came out timely as well. Anything that wasn't finished was packed tableside for us. Bathrooms do have attendants; my fiance got me a single stem rose, which was nothing short of a fabulous surprise. 

Drinks were delicious. Some in our group ordered beer or wine, I didn't pay attention to whether or not they liked it, but those of us who ordered cocktails were very pleased by how balanced they were, which is always a struggle. I chose a Prickly Pear Margarita which I do recommend, but if you like spicy, my fiance did love his Jalapeno Margarita. We ordered about two rounds each because it was just so fantastic. 

Food! Where do I start! The guacamole was great, but I don't really remember much other than liking it. What I will talk about is that Tablet! Or whatever its called. You are doing yourself a giant disservice if you don't order that. We got it with Carnitas and Carne Asada and ordered 2 shrimp to go with it and Jesus H. Christ, I dream about that every once in a while. The Carnitas is on the bone, exquisitely crispy on the outside, yet delicious and soft the deeper you get into the bone - some of the best carnitas ever. The Carne Asada was cooked to a MR perfection and thinly sliced; the cut of meat itself was flavorful. The Shrimp were jumbo shrimp that really just tasted like lobster it was great. Everything else on the tablet was delicious as well, but you do get your money's worth. We didnt finish it; in fact, if you have smaller appetites, they say its for 2, but 3 people can easily share that. Get an appetizer if you're not sure how much you can eat, but trust me when I say that it is definitely a good portion of food.

All in all, I really can't wait to go back. It is an absolutely fun experience and you can truly enjoy yourself there with no rush.",bbAz-JYVTBPc2xRUJTUTuA,0,0,5,jt3HmR-pEf5VVoteqQ63FA

We started at the bar. We knew that they dont separate bills so we had to bring cash, but they also do that at the bar. No splitting! Everyone, except me, ordered margaritas, and everyone seemed to enjoy them. 

We had a reservation so we were seated once we had everyone in our party there. The menu was nice, lots of different offerings.

Me and my friend ordered the seafood cocktail to start (shrimp, octopus and a delicious dressing....very tasty!), we also had a cesar salad (ok, nothing special), and our entree was recommended by the bartender. It was a 3 in 1. A lobster enchilada, a shrimp taco and a poblano pepper stuffed with crab and shrimp. Sadly, the lobster enchilada was eh as was the poblano pepper, however, the shrimp taco was FANTASTIC. Absolutely devine. I loved that the best of every single thing I tasted. The flavors were amazing. Wish we would have gotten that only. So so SOOOOOO good.

For dessert, the brought out a flan for Molly with a candle and we sung happy birthday. I wasn't impressed with the flan myself, but others did seem to enjoy.

I'd love to go back and try one of the margaritas that looked delish, and I will definitely get those shrimp tacos. They were GOOOOOOOOOOD!",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,3,0,4,K0CTYVbnY8d8naCw8LVCOA

We were told in advance that they were unable to split the check, which sucks when your going with a group of friends, but we went with it. Most of us had cash and paid accordingly, but there were two that used their cards. For some reason, when the cashier got the bill back she charged one card the entire $433. Completely ignoring the $350 that was in it. I'm unsure what she thought that $350 in cash was for at that point. On top of that, in trying to remedy the problem, they charged her the correct amount and double charged the other friend for her portion of the bill. When called over, the manager was in a word - INEFFECTIVE!! We were told that the $433 hold should drop from my friend's account....we'll see.",aLud1U6pr_mbVaH6OnYUqQ,1,0,2,HbVFVXt5LhCRdqfTmamjlw

After spending the day at the pool, I was totally looking forward to getting the Cabo Azul at Javier's! Make a reservation because the wait is long, but the bar is open seating, and usually pretty empty.

They serve you warm chips and salsa first. Chips were perfect and the salsa was slightly spicy but refreshing. Came with 3 other friends and we all ordered the Cabo Azul! Definitely the best thing on the menu! Lobster enchilada with green sauce and sour cream, rice and refried black beans, crab stuffed green pepper and the best shrimp taco I've ever had. If you're looking for an alternative to a buffet for about the same price, I'd go here, because I was super full! and I didnt even finish everything! Totally worth it for $30, considering the enchilada and peppers were stuffed with seafood. The refried black beans were soft and sweet. I would say the shrimp taco was the best. The fried shrimp was crispy and the tortilla was quite delicious. Perfect bite every time too!

Absolutely ridiculous!!! First of all, how can they not have a soda gun at such a nice hotel? In any other bar on planet earth, I get a mixer with booze for free. Javier's is not owned my Aria, so there was no recourse through the hotel management. The bartenders said, 'sorry...that's just how it it here.'

There was no one in the restaurant, even though it was a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Maybe arrogant service and overcharging explains it. I am writing to the hotel about this.

To sum it up, you could go to your favorite Mexican joint, ask them to cut the serving size by 1/3, double the price, give you yesterday's stale taco shells, and ignore you all night, and you'd have about the experience I did at Javier's. We had to ask three different people to refill our waters, and we waited about 20 minutes for someone to come by after we asked for the check.

While walking through Aria looking for a bar to get a drink at we stumbled upon Javier's. There was plenty of open seats at the bar so we took two of them. The bar itself seems to be the centerpiece of the restaurant with a huge tent-like feel made of ropes. It was pretty cool. We got a drink menu right away and there were at least a dozen different margaritas to choose from. Real margaritas with fresh ingredients, good tequila and on the rocks (the only way). My wife had a pineapple margarita which was very good and not too sweet. I had their house margarita which was very good. The fresh squeezed limed juice gave it a great tangy and refreshing taste. It wasn't sweet at all which I enjoyed. It was just pure awesomeness.

What put this place over the top for me was their amazing chips and salsa. The chips were hot from the fryer (or oven to warm them) and not greasy at all. The salsa was probably the best I've ever had. Spicy, fresh and just chunky enough. It coated the chips perfectly. This is a big deal for me because I live in an area where Mexican food is about as good as you're going to get it outside of Mexico.

I could see how this place would turn into a loud tequila drinking college fest quite quickly late at night. I wouldn't make a trip here during late night hours.",CYs8MNCKgX58xBUm2aAX9Q,2,2,5,J8DvChVQFq_5U1k90cCgkg

Here's why...

ATMOSPHERE/ CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Once you walk into Javiers you actually forget its inside a casino, I went for dinner. It was dark with some Dias De Los Muerto like decor. Very unique and intimate, also a great selection of music. Loved the restaurant set up, I can't remember my waitors name but he was awesome, great attitude and positive vibe. Very much appreciated. 

FOOD:
Man oh man... I started off with the ceviche which I'm very very picky about. Super fresh and tender octopus, shrimp wasn't fishy, and had a nice citrus touch. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and my significant other ordered the carnitas. Both were outstanding. I'm not saying the enchiladas werent delicious but I definitely will be going back for my own carnitas. Cooked to perfection crispy outside and juicy inside, seasoned just right, best carnitas I've ever had in Vegas.

I ordered the TACOS DE CAMARON. Two shrimp tacos prepared Ensenada style in a flour tortilla with salsa fresca, shredded cabbage and a cilantro-jalapeno aioli. Served with black beans and white rice. While the shrimp in these tacos were good, they were not the best tacos I've had. The rice and beans were pretty bland too. I'm mainly giving this place 4 stars for the freakin' chips and salsa. That salsa was so addicting... I also ordered a side of haberno sauce for my tacos and they were SO spicy but SO delicious. Highly recommend getting that.

My friend also ordered the ahi ceviche which came out poke style. This was also good. Generous amounts of fresh fish AND avocados. Yum.

To start, the chips were a tad bit salty and looked like it was fresh out of the bag. The house salsa was awesome with good heat and fresh tomatoes, herbs etc.

Chile Relleno is a must. The batter was very light, cheese soft and pepper was nicely grilled. The enchilada was typical with a good amount of chicken. The soft taco was very soft, and beef was nicely seasoned. Although it sounds like a mouthful, the portion size was perfect. They were half the size of what you'd get at a typical Mexican restaurant, but it was just enough. 

The jalapeño margarita was really refreshing; a bit sweet and spicy. It creeps up on you, so drink lightly. 

The restaurant is located in the Aria. It's accessible from the tram. 

Overall, a nice restaurant. Our waitress was a bit talky with colleagues and other customers. She asked if we wanted dessert after handing over the bill.

Spinach and cheese enchilada with tomatillo sauce, and a bean and cheese enchilada with red sauce. Both were delicious and appeals to a variety of taste buds. Served with a side of rice and beans. The flavors were great and probably the most ""authentic"" Mexican food I've had in Vegas.

It's sad when have your best restaurant visit on your first night in Las Vegas, but such was the case when we visited Javier's. Most would reserve their 5 star ratings for a stuffy, crusty, upscale restaurant - I'm giving my 5 to this one. 

Javier's is located inside the Aria Resort and Casino, which is simply a beautiful property. The restaurant is easy to find, with it's oversize hammock ropes hanging throughout. The resort and casino has kind of a new hip vibe as does the restaurant. The restaurant is slightly dark and rich feeling.

The service was exceptional and the timing was excellent. Our waiter was Orlando, and he was excellent and welcoming.

I started with the ceviche de camarones (shrimp ceviche). I love ceviche and to tell you this was among the best I ever had isn't an understatement. The shrimp were incredibly fresh and the entire mix was on point. The one thing I truly appreciated is while I'm a ceviche fan, I'm not a huge avocado fan. But the avocados were diced into tiny cubes the same size as the other ingredients so, they were easy to eat. 
Main course for me was the carnitas. Fresh pork with refritos and salsa quemada. Simple Mexican, but delicious. Wife had the filete antiguo, which she absolutely loved. Coupled with great service, the great food made the meal excellent. 

As some other reviews likely state, the food is a bit pricey. For Mexican food in fact, it's high. But for the ambiance and the service - not to mention the suspension of judgement since you are in a high-end Las Vegas resort - it's a good deal.

Trust me - skip some of the other high name/high end restaurants and get a meal here. Javier's is the good stuff.",BR3rW0BRLPxzrDnK-IAJwg,0,0,5,nDV1MuvyfU9qlm9KBHq9nQ

My husband was satisfied with his meal, because it tasted like El Cholo back in LA, which is our favorite mexican there. However, this was more pricey than El Cholo, and we expected more from Javier's. 
My fish was overcooked, and under seasoned. Halibut should never taste fishy, but it did. My homemade black beans are way better seasoned, and the veggies were hardly sautéed. Supposedly they came with a light cream sauce but if it was there, it didn't add anything. My husband wanted to send it back but I was so hungry I just doused it in salsa and it was edible, but not worth anywhere near $40. I should've gone with the enchiladas despite the servers fish recommendation.

I wish I could recommend it because it was our first date night out just the 2 of us since we're here filming a movie and his parents are only in town for a couple days to babysit ;-( At least they didn't gluten poison me",NJEbUCbI2z8IABKjDbHCeQ,0,0,3,azngEBlud7eYKlvJBCDMqw

We randomly stumbled in to this place because my girlfriend and her sister were attracted to the restaurant's ambiance and decor. The wide, dark-lit restaurant with the large rounded bar area overlooks the casino area. Even though this place looks all classy and flashy, I don't think I would come here for the food because I've been spoiled with all the great hole-in-the-wall spots in LA and San Diego. Plus, it's also about 4-5 times more expensive than the tacos/burritos I get at Alberto's. We did try the quesadilla though just to snack on, which was very good.

I would definitely come back for the margaritas! I don't drink a lot of margaritas but the ones they serve here are probably the best I've ever had. I like the concoction of the Pepito Cucumber margarita. Top shelf tequila with bits of cucumber mixed in, delish! I also like the Jalapeno margarita.. not spicy but has that kick and flare brought by the jalapeno.

I'll spare the ad nauseam of every last detail, but I had a lunch here for 7 people. For $16, my enchiladas were okay, but not the most fantastic. Everyone else seemed just ""whelmed"" by their meal as well. Service on the slow side as well. 

I would definitely come back to the bar (alone, obviously, or with cash because of their stupid no check splitting policy) for the excellent margaritas. I had the pineapple and the Javier--both were excellent. My friend had jalapeno--also excellent.

So so so.......what to say...I actually enjoyed my meal. Was it tasty? Yes. But was it anything special? Nope! 

Ordered CABO AZUL: Maine lobster with shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab/ COSTILLA DE RES: short ribs Osso Bucco style/ TACOS DE CAMARON: shrimp, duh.

The COSTILLA DE RES marinated in a spicy tomato and serrano chili sauce was super DUPER tender and juicy. Although the meat was perfectly cooked, the ""spicy sauce"" fell short. I was craving for that spicy serrano bite. Still flavorful and enjoyable, but it just needed that ""in your face"" spice.

The CABO AZUL & TACOS DE CAMARON, I thought was deliciously...average. Good quality freshness in the seafood. I just wasn't blown away. 

My $15 cocktail was really good though! Basically a margarita but I requested it with muddled jalapeños. I was really craving some kind of heat with my meal. Finally! I got some spice that lingered happily in my mouth. BOOM!",eObaIE0V1r9wCw_8kTZCOw,1,0,3,lSCtDzE-Ny4OJngvWIwzBQ

As a New Yorker, I totally understand being ripped off for simple things like a martini or mixed drink.  But after asking for a $16+ vodka soda, which I explained to the bartender was flat, and he disagreed stating if he made me a new drink he would need to charge 2x, I was infuriated before I even sat down.

Once at the table, our waiter was much nicer.  However, I asked at length for the salmon to be rare to medium rare that I ordered, and it arrived close to well done.  The waiter also recommended this dish to me, which was disappointing because it lacked flavor and tasted like rubber (and was over $40).  Eventually he removed the salmon from our group's bill, but overall the experience wasn't great.

3849638,2014-10-21,1,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Aria comes through yet again with another reason for me to frequent their property.

I was drawn to Javier's because of my knowledge of the Javier's in Dallas and was pretty convinced that this one in Las Vegas was somehow connected.

When I asked, I was told that they get asked that quite a bit from people in Texas but this particular Javier's is out of California and has no affiliation with the well-respected location in Dallas.

That was the only disappointment about my visit.

THIS Javier's was so enjoyable it somehow strayed me from my plan to go to the Todd English PUB afterwards, which is nearly impossible to do.

The oval-shaped bar is just off the casino floor and has plenty of seating to accomodate what was a very busy crowd, even for my visit on a Monday night.

Dining areas are immediately left, behind and right of this bar and looked intimate and unique.

I was on my own, so the bar was perfect for my needs and I enjoyed the friendly and attentive service from Felipe and Karen, who also has the perfect smile and personality to handle working with all the guys back there. 

Chips and salsa were put in front of me as I ordered my drink and they are complimentary and plentiful. Other Yelpers have said the salsa is some of the best they've had in Vegas and I cannot dispute that. As a matter of fact, my eyes were watering because of the subtle heat that builds up from enjoying it.

While I went with one of their many Mexican style bottled beers, the bar is fully stocked with not only tons of tequilas but an excellent selection of other spirits. (I also appreciate when Johnny Blue is available, even though it probably does not get much action at around $42 a shot)

Thinking I would save room for some Happy Hour munchies at Todd English PUB, I ordered the taquitos appetizer and was offered chicken, beef or a combination. There were three on the plate and I was full by the time I finished them. Sadly, they may have ruined grocer's freezer taquitos for the rest of my life. Yes, that damn good.

Oh, I am not a fan of sour cream, so Felipe kindly removed it from my order which in turn meant that they drizzled even more guacamole on my taquitos. This was even better than I thought, because I could take chips and dip them in the additional guacamole and still have plenty of guac flavor to complement the taquitos.

My eyes were watering, my tummy was full and my respect for the Aria just continues to grow.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,2,1,4,g5uE7cRJZVMgCRWUTFnI9Q

Located at the Aria Hotel in Vegas, it's the perfect place to enjoy a meal and sip on delicious margaritas with an intimate feel. 

In addition to experiencing the ambience, the food here is exceptionally tasteful.  No complaints here. Although eating high priced Mexican food can be questionable in terms of how creative can you get with rice and beans ? Well Javier's demonstrates that.

I dinned here simply because it is Kobe Bryant's favorite restaurant. 
I was impressed with the ominous decor. The leather menu, leather tables, 3D like paintings, and all black everything made this place appealing.

The menu can be overwhelming since there too many items to mention but there is a large Sea Food portion on the menu. I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas and yes it was brilliant. Everything about the taste of the food was fresh and I assume it took time to make. The presentation of the food was ok, nothing to brag about. The portion was perfect and not to skimpy like most bougie restaurants. 

Javier's is also famous for their Guacamole and I can't agree more since I liked it alot ! 

You get what you pay for and the service was excellent !
Please plan and reserve accordingly since this place does get overly booked.

I hyped everyone up and I was pretty hyped myself to have dinner at one of my favs. It started out with dinner reservation that were set for 7:00pm. We arrived at 7:00 and had to wait for 20 mins to be seated as they claimed they had to prepare our table. We got seated at a booth that was way too small for our group size. By the way there were several tables and other booths that were surrounding that one which were empty, so basically not very busy at the time, so not sure why we had to wait the 20 minutes. Because our booth was to small they moved us to another table that was more appropriate for our needs. We then ordered drinks and guacamole. Our drinks came extremely fast, followed by chips and salsa. The waiter came back to get another drink order, so I asked what happened to the guacamole? I'll check on it he said. 10 more minutes goes by and still no guacamole. The waiter comes back and ask if we want more drinks? Still no guacamole, so I ask him to cancel it. I abruptly told him, I can't understand what takes so long to get guacamole. I said you keep bringing out the expensive drinks, why can't you grab the guacamole? He replied with I'm really sorry sir it's my mistake the guacamole is in the back prepared and all someone needed to do was bring it out. He now comes back with drinks and I ask, so why does that table across from us have their food when they ordered 15 minutes after us? He replies with, honestly what you ordered takes longer to prepare. Good answer I guess. So finally our food arrived, but only half our order. He says yours will be out shortly. 3-5 minutes later the rest of the order shows up. Well to my surprise mine, that takes so much longer to prepare is almost ice cold. I'm not sure I understand why considering mine was the reason for the delay. He said I'll tell the manager you are not satisfied. So we all finish our meals and no manager. I had to flag the waiter down to get the check. I'm convinced it was a bad night. However as a consumer I have a choice of where I dine and I most likely will not be dining here soon, if ever again.",XgoufwuTF7Cn0e30TgtFqg,0,0,1,B7kQ8fH1_oePZFZ16VCMdA
3864170,2013-12-21,4,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I'm well versed with Javier's. I spent plenty of nights at the old Laguna Beach location, and when they relocated it to Newport Beach, we used to spend a fair amount of time there as well.  I'm familiar with their food and drinks, so I was expecting the same great menu here.

I was early to meet my party, so I decided to have a cocktail at the bar. I ordered the Jalepeno Margarita, which was excellent by the way. So my drink is $15, I give him a $20, he gives me a $5 bill back (he didn't break the $5 down). Ok, so my next drink is made by a female bartender. She gives me back $3. 78, right down to the pennies. She charged me tax on my drink. WTF? Tax is ALWAYS included. And who gives back dimes, nickles and pennies? Same drink, two different bartenders, two different prices. It was a little annoying.

Onto the meal. Same great food I've had before. I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas, nice pieces of lump crab meat and shrimp in every bite. Light sauce, not too heavy. The beans and rice that come with meal, beans were really good, not greasy at all. Chips & salsa were really good. Salsa is probably some of the freshest I've had. 

Service, we were bombarded by three different people before and during our meal. It was too much. While we are still eating, he would come around and ask if we were done and if he could clear anything. Clearly we still have food on our plates, no we aren't done. I can't stand being rushed when I'm eating. If I want to talk during or after my meal, that's our business! Literally after seeing our plates empty, he came back around, starting clearing our plates and dropped our check off. Didn't offer coffee or dessert, he just made us feel rushed. Not cool. 

Ambiance. I liked the feel, the dark wood, dim lighting, Dia De Los Muertos figurines, I also liked the lounge area near the bar as well. This wouldn't be a date spot like others have suggested, the music was really loud in here and it was a bit dificult to have a conversation with the person next to you.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,7,6,4,RJAOWnhegAYtl_ZSxv0mgA

Javier's is pretty new restaurant in the Aria, and it is absolutely gorgeous.  Think upscale with old macabre carvings, candlelight, and dark wood.  Sit in the horseshoe-shaped booths if you can - very romantic!

They started us out with chips and salsa - the chips were still hot and the salsa was perfection!  You can tell a lot about a place from the salsa.

Chips and salsa + a margarita = just right.  

My man had the Cabo Azul combination plate, and I filched more than a few bites.  Just the right touch with seafood and sauces!  I had the chile relleno with picadillo and that was also delicious.

3954482,2015-05-28,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javiers usually provides a great food experience at thier other locations. In my opinion, don't waste your time even considering the Las Vegas location. It ranks far below the quality and service standards of the other Javiers locations. I've been to several of Javiers locations including Newport Beach, Irvine, and Las Vegas. 

My favorite dishes are the Cabo Azul, and the Mole Poblano. I also usually splurge on a few tamarind margaritas as well.  I have had these dishes often enough to know when they are prepared properly and when the kitchen is cutting corners.

On this visit my wife decided to split the Cabo Azul. It is described as: ""A Maine lobster enchilada in a creamy pasilla sauce, a grilled chile relleno stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab topped with a light relleno sauce, and a shrimp taco on a flour tortilla prepared Ensenada style. Served with refried black beans and white rice.""

When we got the dish, we were starved, even though we stuffed our faces with far too many chips with salsa. The dish was not as hot as it usually is. We just figured it sat under the warming lamps too long as the service was a little slow. We decided I would eat the shrimp taco, her the lobster enchilada and we would split the Chile Relleno. We also had 3 Tamarind Maragaritas at $18 a piece.

While we were eating the waitress came by to see how things were. Even though thedish wasn't as hot as I expected, I was fine with it and gave her an 'it's fine' grunt just wanting her to go away.

I grunted too soon. When my wife and I got to splitting the ""grilled chile relleno stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab topped with a light relleno sauce"" I was immediately disappointed. It was very difficult to cut the chile, as it cold and wasn't cooked at all. I managed to saw off a section and give it a try anyway. There was little to no cheese, the shrimp were no where to be found, the fresh Dungeness crab resembled and tasted like imitation Krab meat, and the sauce tasted like Cambells mushroom soup. I got the impression that they had a pile of ungrilled split Chiles in the kitchen where the chef grabs an icr cream scoop full of Krab filling and flings inside the Chile, spills some muchroom soup over it and trys to pass it off as Cabo Azul. Pure crap. 

We complained to our waitress about that portion of the dish (when in reality it was all pretty much sub-par). She took our plates away, no doubt destroying the evidence. She returned again in a little while with our bill that had no adjustment for the crappy chile relleno. She was suprised that we expected something and meekingly squeaked that she thought the manager had already come by. So she scurried off to get the manager (again). 

We waited what seemed like an eternity until 2 managers came by to set us straight about the order. There was a snooty middle-aged blonde woman and a young concern-feigning hispanic gentleman riding shotgun. She proceeded to scold us over not calling out the problem with the food when the waitress came by the first time (roughly 2 minutes after she set the plates down), and that we had ate some of the meal so it must have been good for us at the time. In her mind we were supposed to inspect and taste each portion of the plate and be ready sign a contract of acceptance moments after being given our meal. When we pointed out that might be a tad unreasonable, the hispanic gentleman explained that he would adjust the bill for that portion of the meal. Lets do some quick math and see what a reasonable person would expect. In Las Vegas the Cabo Azul is $36. Its made up of a Lobster Enchilada, a Dungeness Crab Chile Relleno, and a Shrimp Taco.  I would value them as Lobster: 14, Relleno 12, Taco 10.  They managed to give us a $6 credit.

We've been to this location twice now. Like I said, the others are far superior. There are far too many other places to go to in Las Vegas that take pride in thier meal preparation to ever bother going here again.",gflDgG1DGDvxPGE6SRCn9g,0,0,2,wMRHPNcdqEpDNN7dsv_YSA

I was seated promptly without reservation and I was soon brought water, iced tea, and chips with salsa.  I had a few minutes to study the menu once again--I really didn't have to--when the server came back to take my order.  The chips were warm and the salsa had a good flavor with lots of cilantro flavor and a small amount of bite.

The Cabo azul is a mixed seafood plate with a (1) grilled chile relleno stuffed with Dungeness crab, shrimp, and jack cheese, (2) a lobster enchilada in pasilla sauce, and (3) a shrimp taco served in a soft flour tortilla that's been slightly grilled.  The dish was wonderful!  It's a great selection of seafood.

There was no skimping on any of the fillings.  The enchilada had great tasting lobster.  The crab and shrimp in the chile relleno was plentiful, and the grilled shrimp in the taco were excellent!  The dish also had black beans and rice.  The chile wasn't hot at all.  Although I like hot peppers, I think it would have detracted from the crab and shrimp.  For dessert, I went with their fried ice cream which was standard and good.

Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking, plates were cleared quickly, and a manager came by two times to see how things were and once to chat about the heat or lack of the chile.

The room is really nicely done with different decorations including a wall of carved wood that is quite interesting (see other peoples' photos).  This is a place I'll revisit!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,9,4,ytfXLa0i8wKvXD-RxhblFA

We went to dinner as a group of four and were promptly seated. The ambience wasn't bad, but we all hated how dark it was in the booth area we were in. We are all fairly young (mid-twenties to early thirties), yet felt like we had aged because it was so dark we couldn't read the menus printed on black paper. Turns out we weren't the only ones having issues as we saw other waiters turn on mini flash flights for other patrons to read their menus! Ridiculous. 

We each had different margaritas and didn't think much of them. We didn't bother ordering additional rounds as we had all planned to. Can't remember the specific name of my dish, but the description in the menu sounded great so I ordered it. My friends had the beef fajitas. We got our plates and well... mine looked EXACTLY like theirs with the exception of having a small side of rice. A little frustrating when the descriptions AND prices were different. On top of that, the food was bland. I pretty much just poured the rest of the salsa (from the chips and salsa to start) to have some sort of taste. There was no flavor in anything and the steak pieces were dry and overcooked. It was truly a disappointing meal, especially given the price. 

The only saving grace in this place were the chips and salsa. Those were definitely tasty, but that is not enough to return to this place.",ALB97f3KpBFW1tWJknbL2Q,5,0,2,Bbnop0gz13aiyo_MwUzf0A

4041023,2017-11-04,2,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's was a pleasant surprise amongst the heavy hitters that we lined up for our quarterly foodie trip to Vegas. We actually had Javier's as a 'filler' restaurant since it was at the Aria where we were staying. It turned out to be one of the better experiences we had the entire trip!

It's said that it's difficult to screw up Mexican food - but I disagree. I believe it's difficult to get Mexican food right. Living in Texas, it's difficult to find good Mexican food outside of San Antonio, and even there it's difficult.

Surprisingly, Javier's does it right. This is not a dig on Javier's, but just an expectation to never find good Mexican food outside of Mexico, Baja California, or closer to Nogales, Arizona. Las Vegas was the LAST place I thought we'd find good Mexican food, but we were wrong!

We actually weren't that hungry, but we were thirsty so we started with a house special margarita and a jalapeno margarita. Added some chips, salsa, and guacamole to start. After a short conversation with our very friendly and knowledgeable server, we decided on the Mole Poblano and Steak Picado. It's difficult to judge a restaurant on just two dishes, but if these two were an indicator of the quality of the rest of the menu, we'll be back!

Overall, the food, decor, and service were excellent! Great Mexican food at rather palatable prices for being inside a Vegas hotel.",sRllSaD1Evx4Z8doDDgS0g,2,4,4,Wri9AWMlxaAhqkhP7_3_gQ

We came here 3 times in the weekend that we were here so that says something about our feelings for Javier's. The place has such a cool atmosphere, ropes coming out of the bar, an incredible panel of skulls and all things scary carved out of wood on one side of the restaurant, really a site to see. The place has this intimate dark feel with mexican music always playing, it's like you just want to be there.

Now onto the important stuff, la comida which means food in Spanish. BEST SALSA I have ever had in my life, no seriously, and I'm from Chicago where we have some of the best Mexican restaurants around like Mercadito and Rick Bayless's Frontera Grill, but Javier's salsa and warm chips were just perfection. It was spicy yet flavorful and the chips were thin but not too thin and super crispy and fresh. And it's bottomless so does it get better than that? The one thing we weren't impressed by is the guacamole, it was a tad on the bland side, so if Javier's can kick start it or add some of those salsa ingredients that would be fab-u-lous! Our friends got the seafood quesadillas, nachos, enchiladas and they really enjoyed all.

Now the very best part, the margaritas! Those drinks kept us coming back for more and more, we could not get enough of them. They were the perfect combo of sweet, sour, savory, right amount of tequilla, and they were the regular ones, OH EM GEE, just amazing, I'll be dreaming of them forever. Or I'll go to Cabo as the server recommended to Javier's on the beach. The service isn't the best as I would agree with some of the reviews, but they are definitely sweet people working there.

The staff are hit and miss; some of them are nice and polite. while others are dismissive and not helpful. This includes management. 

The decor is modern but has traditional Mexican elements. I like the design but wished lighting was a bit brighter.

The food: 
Guacamole - the order was like two small scoops of gelato. While it was good, it did not blow me away. 

Queso Fundido - this was cheesy good and I would order it again. I would also ask them to make it spicy somehow. It would have been better with bits of Chorizo in it. 

Octopus and Shrimp Ceviche - Both were fresh and tasted great. Portions again were small. These would be good as tapas style plates. 

Carnitas - The carnitas was surprisingly a larger portion. It came with a couple of medium size pork ribs and a chunk of pork butt. The flavors were good and there was a crunch from the deep-fried pork butt. It came with guacamole, tortillas, salsa, and pureed beans. These were some of the best beans I've had because it was luscious and creamy... I think from either lard or butter. 

Other people on the table had the Camerones Ranchero, Seafood Enchilada, Carne Asada and everyone seemed to like their dishes. 

No desserts because we were too full from everything else. But the server did tell us they has fried bananas and flan.

4139784,2018-05-13,1,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's is centrally located right of the casino floor in Aria. The restaurant's decor is modern Mexican with great use of textures, lighting and artwork. The ambiance is high energy as the casino floor is so close yet the mood is comfortable with low lighting.

The bar greets you with a great selection of tequilas. My biggest complaint was the weak pours in the Margaritas. A couple people in our group complained they were not feeling the buzz after two rounds of margaritas and I agreed. Why be stingy on $18 cocktails?!

The mood and ambiance make this the top high end Mexican eatery on the strip. The food doesn't disappoint. We had table side guacamole, fajitas, enchiladas, tacos and chopped salad. Everything was fresh and delicious.

 The service was friendly but a bit slow. We were trying to make a show and asked for expedited service. They struggled to accommodate and butchered two guests orders. Oops! I personally received a chicken taco when I ordered beef. No biggie it was still good.

Will happily come back as I have already returned several times. Javier's don't be scared to share your tequila, $20 margarita drinkers tend to know their stuff and expect a kick!!",e8zjW3I0d26ZYPL2TT425A,1,1,4,0ZyVCd36rY_VOktqrP0ybw

We arrived around 7:00 on a Thursday night and our party of three was promptly seated even though the restaurant was quite full. 
The dark wooden tables, rope canopy over the bar and metal tree of tequila lends a dark and sexy feel. 
The chips and salsa are amazing, salsa is very hit or miss and this one was a hit. Food ordered was seafood (crap and lobster) enchiladas, one with red sauce, one with verde. Excellent. The chicken fajitas were good, they are not delivered on a sizzling platter as I think standard for fajitas, but whatever, they were still good. The chicken mole was commented as very good, too. Margaritas were bueno. 
The service was great, the server was friendly and he accommodated the no dairy requests, even double checking the order to make sure.

We were seated in a nice section of oversized booths that made it feel nice and private. 
The waiter came and took our drink order and so we both ended up with the organic margarita. Delicious. 
We ordered the shrimp ceviche for our appetizer and I don't really know what to say about it other than it was the worst ceviche I have ever tasted. Or should I say not tasted. It tasted like they just got some frozen precooked shrimp and then cooked them again and then sprinkled a little lime juice on them. It was weird. Then to make it even more weird the server placed a bottle of tapatio next to the dish almost as if he knew it needed some flavor. Yea that tapatio came in handy. 
For dinner I had the mole verde, and it was good. My wife had a filet off the grill with a little chipotle cream on it. It was good too. 
I think the ceviche just threw me so out of sync that the place never really recovered for me.

It's located inside the Aria Casino, and its grand entrance with large ropes hanging over the open bar lure you inside. It's simply stunning! I never thought I would use the word ""pretty"" to describe the interior of a Mexican restaurant since so many are kitschy, but pretty it is.

My husband and I were seated in the bar area for lunch. We had a large rounded booth all to ourselves... in case we wanted to take a siesta after our meal, I suppose. The fresh chips and salsa are so addictive. We went through a basket and a half before our entrees arrived. What can I say? I'm a small girl with a large appetite. 

I ordered three separate items... chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and chicken soft taco. The chile relleno was awesome! It had a crispy coating and a thick cheesy center. It was my favorite of the three, though all were extremely good. My husband ordered chicken mole, which came with flour tortillas and all the fixings. The chicken was still on the bone, but was so moist it just pulled right off. Both meals were served with rice and beans. I normally don't eat the rice and my husband usually doesn't eat the beans. On this occasion, we both cleared our plates. All ingredients were so fresh and the flavors just jumped out at you.

In exchange you get some very swanky places, gourmet food, and world class chefs...but you also get the worst kind of humans.  Javier's balanced all of this perfectly somehow.  

The restaurant is in the Aria and is very sleek and modern.  The music, while a little loud, made the atmosphere upbeat and fun.  The service was solid, the crowd was upscale but not fake and, most importantly, the food was very good.  Now you're still paying $30 for enchiladas but in this setting you'd expect a lot more than $50 a person for dinner and a drink.  The margarita menu is pretty great even at $16-$18 each.

Once we sat, the bartender came over right away to get our drink order.  We ended up asking for his recommendations, and he did not steer us wrong! I ended up with one of the most well-made margaritas I've ever had! Unfortunately, I was not able to order another after that, as the bartender was no where to be found once our order was placed.  There were multiple bartenders running back and forth taking care of guests but none of them stopped to ask if we needed anything and we didn't see the one we had ordered from again.  We ended up having to stop a busser to get us a couple of things once we got our food and had to flag down a nearby bartender when we wanted our check.  The service went from amazing to abysmal very quickly. 

As far as the food goes, we ordered guacamole as an appetizer.  It came out quickly. But I get better guac at Chipotle.  If I were to ever return, I would definitely not waste my money on it. For my entree, I opted for Relleno de Picadillo.  The beef was seasoned well and I did enjoy it.  It was a good size portion and, if my hotel had a fridge, I would've taken the rest to go.

Very intimate and inviting atmosphere. This upscale-ness is certainly reflected in the price with many, entrees wavering around $20-much more than you would expect from a typical Mexican restaurant. 

Free chips and salsa-Salsa was a little hot and that basket of chips was huge!

Didn't get to try any entrees since we were stuffed already from a pre-dinner. But we did get drinks and dessert.

Mango and strawberry margaritas---but their mango margarita was delicious! Blended nomnomness.  

Caesar Salad-Caesar salad dressed up with little tortilla chips...Tiny, tiny portion. Not worth that dough my friends. 

Also tried the flan and the fried ice cream. The flan was good, creamy and not too sweet, but I'm more used to a creamy, coffee flavored Vietnamese flan. The fried ice cream was much different than the tempura kind you find at Japanese joints. Vanilla ice cream covered in some kind of nuts in a fried bowl that was cinammon-sugar dusted. 

Service was EXCELLENT. So kind and attentive. I would come back just for the service.

The bar area is our favorite place to sit because it's a little quieter and brighter than a table in the back of the restaurant itself, and the bartenders and cocktail waitresses always have the best service skills!  The full menu is available in the bar, so you don't miss out on anything and actually get a pretty good view of the Casino to keep you entertained during your meal.

The food is always excellent, and this visit was no exception.  Guacamole was on point - creamy but with a little texture from the fresh tomatoes and onions, a perfect way to start our meal.  It's worth noting that the chips and salsa here are really delicious as well, but you really should try the guacamole if you are a guac fan.  

Margaritas are always good - house on the rocks is a favorite of ours (simple, not too sweet, lots of lime flavor), and the skinny margarita is pretty good as well, but beware - the tequila flavor is strong, so if you need a little sweetness, just go with the house margarita and eat four less chips.  Pineapple margarita and blood orange margarita are our favorite fruit-flavored options, really smooth and packed with fresh fruit flavor.

Pretty much everything on the menu we have had is amazing, and they are happy to customize it however you'd like.  Ceviche on this trip was still fresh, flavorful, and a generous portion for a meal if you add a side of rice or beans with it.  The chicken tacos were light and nicely spiced - with fresh tortillas and some salsa for the top, they are a great lighter option if you are gearing up for a night at the tables.

Overall Javier's never disappoints every time we go.  While it does not have the best views of the Strip, it's definitely worth a visit if you are fan of Mexican food, or just really love a great margarita.

Cheers!",90sTc0TQ7F1Uj5NGiIE30Q,1,1,5,3vfQuF28VolCo5JgLUFxuA

Having been there one time before with some work friends it lived up to the previous experience and then surpassed it.  

Come for the food, and stay for the drinks.  I live in Los Angeles and we have all kinds of Mexican food, and while Javier's was as fresh as the freshest I have experienced there is something unique about the flavors while still satisfying any traditional urges you might have.

I had the carnitas plate and it was hands down the best carnitas I have had anywhere.  This is my favorite dish at most places so I have tried it dozens and dozens of times from many restaurants and it was to die for.  It was cooked perfectly.

We also split the Javier's Ensalada and it was superb, very fresh.

For drinks we tried a few of the Margaritas but our unanimous favorite was the cucumber jalapeño margarita.  The exact name is escaping me but it was very refreshing.

Chef Sosa and his team have found a way to elevate the flavors in Mexican cuisine so that it may suit the palate of any culture and or picky eaters.  Our meal started with a Trio of Ceviches, in which we chose on 2 fish and 1 octopus.  Boy did we regret not getting 2 octopus ceviches instead.  The  fish cevich is made with Halibut and is just amazing, but being Mexican and always eating fish ceviche, you kind of get used to the flavor., but the Octopus Ceviche was just beyond words delicious (hence the reason we regretted not getting 2 Octopus ceviches).  The flavors are distinct and unique but you know you are still having Mexican food.  As I sat there enjoying the Octopus I also worked on trying to figure out the ingredients to recreate at home (in my book, that is the true testament of how delicious food is).  Followed by Crispy Taco plate for my husband, which he raved about and I had the Enchilada Trio, which consisted of 1 shrimp enchilada, 1 crab enchilada, both bathed in a tomatillo sauce, and 1 lobster enchilada bathed in a creamy pasilla sauce.  I was in heaven!  We then ended our meal with one of the creamiest flans we have ever tasted and the absolute best Tres leches I have ever encountered.  We got excited to find out that we can enjoy this meal again out in Irvine, CA which is closer to us then Vegas, so we will definitely be visiting that location as well.  

I must mentioned that I we also received the best service we have ever gotten in Las Vegas from Ivette A.

Even though they were packed, the hosts managed to seat us quickly, although there was some confusion as to who our server was. I got the tamarindo margarita, which was a little sweet for my taste, but it was pretty strong as well. 

Their chips and salsa are freshly made. They do have a habanero salsa if you like things spicy. I am warning you, it is spicy. And I love spicy. So use with caution

Both Jacob and his dad ordered the chile verde which I believed they both loved as they left their plates empty when we left. The food did take around half an hour, but they were really clear about the time it would take. 

I ordered the Cabo Azul and it is absolutely delicious. It is a big portion as it comes with a lobster and shrimp enchilada, lobster stuffed chile relleno, rice, beans and a fish taco.

Starting from their queso dip to their spicy salsa and their tasty enchiladas, all of their dishes were perfectly executed. What is great is you don't have to order an entire plate of enchiladas if you aren't too hungry and can do an a la cart style where you can order one enchilada with sauce. It's a pretty big portion. They have vegan options and gluten free options. The vegan and gluten free enchilada was a spinach, zucchini and corn enchilada with a. True vegan green sauce that doesn't have any animal by product wrapped in a corn tortilla. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in Vegas hands down. The ambiance is electric and eclectic. The dia de las muertes vibe adds a interesting feel to this restaurant.

Our meals were outstanding. I had Carne Asada while my wife had a trio of seafood enchiladas. I would definitely recommend both to anyone. 

Having said this, The icing on the cake for me was the gentleman's restroom attendant. I cannot remember his name; however, he noticeably took pride in what he did. He provided a service that I believe is under appreciated. Soap in my hand, turning the water on for me, and having a towel ready to dry my hands. I know it sounds weird, but it made the experience that much better. My wife and I go to Vegas to ""treat ourselves"" to the luxuries we don't experience in our everyday lives raising three kids.

This is a beautiful restaurant when it comes to decoration. I do personally think the tables are too close to each other, you can literally hear others' conversation even you don't want to by sitting right next to their table and also the booth seating is not facing the casino but rather facing another table. While we were there, we are a party of 3 girls and we had a booth. The whole time the couple, who were at the table right in front of us kept turning their heads to us. It is rather distracting for both tables. The restaurant has dark wood decor and their massive art piece at the very end on the wall. That's made by a famous Mexican Artist on a solid wood piece with a chainsaw. I highly recommend anybody who plans on visiting the restaurant or Aria check out this video : http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2012/10/15/watch-the-worlds-largest-chainsaw-art-being-made.php

When it comes to food, I am a big fan of their appetizers and frenshly made margaritas than their entrees. I ordered Seafood Enchiladas, it is fresh and tastes good but didn't really impress me or give me any wow moment. However, their cocktails are amazing. Between three of us, we had Jalepino Margarita, Cucumber Margarita and Tamary Margarita. They are all delicious. The bartender made them pretty strong too, and of course no complaints on that :-)

The service is the reason I only gave a 3 star for this restaurant. We were here for a work invite. Unlike any other restaurants, from the server, the busser to the manager, nobody knows what to do. The manager didn't come to the table and tried to ""sell"" the restaurant. The server didn't know how to handle the ordering. The busser came by 3 different times asking if we ordered bottle of water or tap water. I am not impressed at all. Another thing that I don't think this restaurant can rate itself as fine dining is that the server didn't bring our food together when serving, and they asked us who ordered what again after he had taken our orders. 

I would come back for the drinks and appetizers for sure.",RfSCladjX660OpmPFxmV7A,1,0,3,cYEv9rrnWRUXdNpRl4IAgw

4642853,2014-12-27,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"We were looking for a place that would be open late around Aria, and this was perfect because it closes at midnight. We literally walked to the hostess at 11:45 p.m. and she was able to seat us. The next night though, we walked by and the restaurant was packed, so it might be wise to make a reservation. The chips and salsa, along with the margarita, were delicious. 

The food here was good, but could have been better if some had not been overcooked. I had two tacos: one shrimp and one carne asada. The shrimp taco was perfectly cooked and really delicious. The carne asada was a pass: the meat was good but it was literally meat, avocado, and a little bit of onion, which made the taco too dry. I did like the sides of rice and beans though. The BF had the lobster enchilada. The lobster was a little dry and overcooked, and it was hard to taste the lobster with everything else going on in the dish. We wouldn't order this again.

Overall, it was a good experience, but too pricey in our opinion. I don't think most people will spend $$$ for tacos and enchiladas. I would only stop by again for drinks and some chips and salsa.",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,1,0,3,1qO5o1cctS_82kgMTlpK9A
4644184,2018-02-08,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I've been here twice. Once, I just sat at the bar for lunch and ordered fajitas. Your mileage may vary, but they use the bottled real sugar Mexican Coca-Cola bottles, and I was only charged for one despite receiving three refills. I'm glad I wasn't charged for the extra bottles, because the one I was billed for was $6. The service and the food were great, although dangerously challenging their value with the high prices for most plates.

The high price issue faded a bit when my fiancee and I returned months later for dinner, where the place was packed and had a really cool social-meets-classy ambiance.

The menu needs SEVERE updating: At that meal, I was feeling like eating light, so I ordered the taquitos, which are billed in the menu as ""Beef or chicken."" It doesn't even say cheese, but every taquito I've ever had in my life is just meat and cheese. When it came, it was covered in slaw, onions, guac and sour cream - things I guess that aren't uncommon in a Mexican restaurant, but things that I'm picky enough of an eater to not want to eat, especially when the menu didn't say that it came with all of that stuff. Fortunately, our server was understanding, took it back, allowed me to select something else from the menu (that still lacked an explanation of its ingredients, but he was able to provide them verbally so that I could be sure of what I was getting this time) and didn't charge me for the taquitos.

I think it's critical that the menu spell out what ingredients are in the item - not only does this usually help you sell the item and keep picky eaters like myself happy, but it also helps those with food allergies avoid certain items without having to pester their server with those types of things.

Considering the menu issue, I'd reduce them to 3 stars, but they recover to 4 on the customer service end on immediately rectifying the issue for me. I just hope they put a more long-term solution in place by rewriting the menu to be more verbose.",rhtps55mnfi2TP6bxn0tIA,0,0,4,nsGAzUpajgJyGHdgjdls5Q

Came here after reading the amazing reviews of this restaurant.  I also saw some tasty-sounding veg options on their menu in the form of enchiladas, salads, and guac!

I ordered (a couple of) the jalapeno margaritas...wow...so delicious. I have had very few of these that have been memorable and the ones at Javier's are spectacular.  My gal pal ordered a martini and enjoyed it as well.

We split the guac and I asked for some spicier salsas with the complimentary chips; I really liked the roasted tomato one that was brought...mmm!

For my main course, I was excited to go with the spinach enchiladas but our server, Andrew, kindly pointed out that if I am a pure vegetarian, the pasilla sauce had some meat stock in it. He offered to have the refried beans (that also had meat stock) to be substituted for the vegetarian black beans (which I thought was a great idea) and he said he could sub out the pasilla sauce for a tomato-based sauce. I asked if the tomatillo sauce that was on the other veg enchilada could be used instead but he said that had meat stock as well.  I trusted his judgment and appreciated being told about the meat stock and him having a plan in place to make sure I could still enjoy; however, when the entree arrived, it was not that great. The sauce was boring (like something I have had at a mediocre fast food joint). I ended up putting the roasted tomato salsa that I received with the chips on it to give more flavor.  I also doused some of our appetizer guac on the enchiladas as well.  Considering my entree was $22 (and our bill, in general, was pricey), I expected true flavor from here.  I was really disappointed in what was brought in front of me for my main course.  I don't blame Andrew at all. I think he was fantastic, but I do think Javier's needs to provide some tasty veg options or at least better veg sauces for the enchilads.  I felt somewhat cheated coming here.  I enjoyed my drink(s), the chips, the guac, and the roasted tomato salsa, but my enchiladas sucked.  I'm glad my gal pal really enjoyed her steak fajitas, though, but I'm not surprised because definitely the restaurant caters to meat-eaters.  

I come to Vegas quite a bit and I love the Aria, but I am not sure if I would come to Javier's again for food... I'm hoping the menu changes to cater to all diets but until that time...I would prolly only come here for the jalapeno margarita and some guac.",P3gYzJ2UxK5mQlcRhQTq3A,3,1,3,DcvHOkMNpKigVlaVQRPK8A

The place was packed, as always, and we found ourselves in the back area considered bar seating since there was a ridiculous line to wait, but totally understandable based on the circumstances. 

Anyways, took like 25 minutes for a cocktail waitress to take our order while another one ignored us. We got jalapeño margs (so good but a little too sweet for me) and shared a seafood quesadilla. Let me tell you - I was so skeptical but that thing was a delicious. Who would think cheese, crab, and shrimp in a quesadilla would be that delicious? I wasn't even hungry! And praise the man who brought us chips, salsa, and water while we waited for the cocktail waitress. He really held us over. Plus he was super sweet and the most attentive to us. 

For two margs and a seafood quesadilla was around $85 after tip. A little pricey but it is the Aria/the strip and it was pretty good. 

To be honest - I will most likely come back to do a full dining experience. It's just always packed and I think it's lame you can't open table a reservation. The enchiladas ordered by a gent at the table next to us looked delicious and there are plenty of items I'd love to try. I will most likely update my review if I ever get a chance to get a damn table in this place. 

In their defense too - I've been on the other side - I've been working when it's super slammed and you're fully in the weeds but our cocktail waitress we ended up with was super nice and the girl she was working with was great at ignoring people and seemed lazy but their managers were busting their butts (very admirable). 

Other than that - food and drinks are great - expensive and worth it. I would come check it out but couldn't give it 4 or 5 stars cause of the service. Hopefully that will change soon though!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,1,1,3,qzGbDM0ID_2B1KHluHIpqA

So we decided to stop by just in case it is  because we love the one in Irvine.  Indeed it was, and boy are we glad we stopped by.  

They have the best spicy salsas in this universe, not to mention, the best carnitas.   The service was on par and the restaurant is immaculate.  Probably the cleanest restroom I've ever seen at a restaurant.  It's a little pricy, but it's worth every penny. 

Yay! One more great place to look forward to dine at whenever we are in Vegas.

I always have to get a shrimp ceviche it's the best ceviche I've ever had and I Live in LA so I've had plenty different varieties of ceviche. I love Javier's because it is fresh , very citrusy, and more meat than liquid. 

Another plus is that their drinks are strong, good strong like I can have one drink and not need a second one where usually I do get 2 at other restaurants. So even though the margarita are 14-16$ it's worth it when you get your money's worth of liquor. These margaritas aren't shy. Neither am I but I've never sent a drink back here.

I immediately let Aria Conceirege know about the level of service being provided at Javier's and they immediately rectified the situation while letting the food and beverage manager know as well. Food was bland and average, nowhere near caliber of original Javier's in so cal.",V2lW5rvlRoXEoFRo_EE1tg,8,0,1,U6D5Uca3K_LP0ahakIB3yw

I went here for the first time last weekend while away for a weekend in Vegas. This place was amazing!! I LOVE me some good margaritas but boy good ones are hard to come by. Usually two sweet for my liking. These were perfect!! I loved the cucumber and the jalapeño margarita! Chips and salsa were out of this world. My hubby & I shared the combo sampler plate (I forgot what it was called) and I wish I was still hungry because I wanted to eat more food but I was so full!! Hands down best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. This prices were a little on the higher side but reasonable in my opinion for the quality you are getting. Our service was absolutely amazing too.

4845266,2016-07-12,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's in The Aria Resort and Casino is a Mexican restaurant that was just slightly above average for us. We dined there our second night in Las Vegas and although the margaritas were very good and the food was pretty good, our experience with our waiter was extremely poor (Unfortunately, I can't remember his name).

We had the ceviche with octopus and shrimp at it was pretty good although it was SWIMMING in lime juice(this was the first time that I have had ceviche, so maybe that is the was it is supposed to be served). My wife had a salad, which was fantastic and I had the seafood enchiladas, which were pretty good as well. 

Our issue with the service was the fact that we were continually rushed through dinner. The entire experience felt like we were being hustled by a used car salesman. We were not impressed. Additionally, our waiter told us that if we were charging the meal to our room, we had to wait for him to come back and get the check so that he could run the charge AND THEN, we could leave. Now, I get the fact that there are ""dine and dashers"" out there, but don't expect me to wait around so that you can verify whatever it is you need to verify. We were staying in a penthouse sky suite at The Aria and charged everything to our room and never once were asked to wait for someone to verify our stay. The entire experience was very weird. I would not recommend Javier's to anyone based on our experience, but it might be worth a shot as long as not all of the wait staff conduct themselves like used car salesmen.

One look at the bottle and I knew I was gonna need a third mortgage to pay for it. I ordered a qusadilla with chicken and a steak salad. Both unimpressive and if I had ordered that at a normal restaurant I would have expected to pay about 15 bucks the bill without tip was 54.00! A complete rip off. It was on a comp but seriously? I want some of what they are smoking. As soon as I mentioned it was a comp my server turned cold..little did she know I tipped 30% because it was a comp. I would never spend MY money in this place. Completely mediocre garbage. Why don't these places bother to put as much into what they serve as they do in the surroundings they are served in? The extra star was for my server she was pretty good until I mentioned it was a comp.

I had only been there for cocktails in the past so I was excited to try the food. Boy was I let down. He ordered the lobster and crab enchiladas and asked for extra lobster and crab on the side, when the waiter brought it out he was wondering where the side of extra meat was. She stated that the cook had put it inside the enchiladas already. He was upset about that. I tasted it and they were extremely bland and underwhelming. The lobster was chewy and over cooked.I didn't have a huge appetite that night so I ordered an appetizer the chicken taquitos. Those were disappointing as well. I've honestly had better rolled tacos at Roberto's which I find odd being that this is an upscale restaurant. I have friends who've dined here a few times and they didnt care for the either.

When visiting Las Vegas we always make a point to stop by Javier's in Aria.  Javier's is THE Mexican restaurant on The Strip!  They offer a huge selection of appetizers, entrees and drinks and we have never had anything but an EXCELLENT experience here at Javier's.

On this trip we had the La Tablita which is a build-your-own soft taco extravaganza for two people!  At first the price of $50 seems shocking, but you get more food than if you each were to order soft tacos on your own.  Plus they will bring out more soft tacos shells when you need them at no additional charge!  We were able to build 12 soft tacos out of all of the meat (chicken, pork and steak) and sautéed vegetables that came with the meal.

This is truly an awesome experience.  Arrive early to get in!",apjVsupSCWD212gt4YuNmw,2,2,5,o-RtxEgn6b6hHiyL7xgtwQ

- Great salsa.  Seriously top notch.  Perfect heat, tomato, and chili combination with just the right consistency
- We had the ceviche trio.  The shrimp ceviche was my favorite, which is rare because most shrimp ceviche has little flavor.  Javier's version was rich, tangy, and spicy
- I had the costilla de res.  It was nice and tender.  The sauce was delicate, which you normally don't find in Mexican fare. I loved it.  Something needs to be done with the potatoes though.  Didn't seem to match well

5009390,2013-12-23,1,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Super Disappointed in Javier's after last night and not sure that we would ever return to the restaurant after the way Guillermo, the manager, handled our situation and treated us while we were there.  
We were a group of 4 (all locals) dining before a show.  Two of us got there early and ordered drinks from the bar.  The bartender, Cara was VERY ACCOMMODATING, really nice and made us martinis that were not on the menu.  She took an idea of the flavors that we were looking for and she made a PERFECT Martini.  The other two in our party arrived, we closed out our tab with Cara ($14 per drink) and we were seated.  
Luis was our waiter during dinner and did a fantastic job.  We ordered food and continued to order the same Martinis at dinner (we told Luis to go to Cara since she had made the original Martinis).  Dinner was good and then we received the bill.  The Martinis were now $17 instead of the $14 that we were charged at the bar.  I questioned Luis and he said that we were charged the wrong price at the bar and that $17 was the new and correct price.  I explained that it wasn't right to charge $14 at the bar and then $17 at dinner.   We thought that they were $14 and happily paid that at the bar and continued to order because we thought that they were $14.   He offered to get the manager, Guillermo.  Guillermo came over and we explained the situation that we had a couple Martinis at the bar for $14 and then at dinner, they were $17.  Guillermo said that $17 was the right and a fair price for the Martinis and that he would not change it.  I explained that it was not our fault if they charged us the wrong price at the bar but since we had already started drinking the Martinis at one price, didn't he think it would be fair THAT NIGHT to let us have the other two that we ordered at the same price.  He said, NO.  We explained that we were locals, frequented the restaurant and were disappointed in the way that he was handling the situation since we were now arguing over $6 and he said that he would not adjust the price for the Martinis, that was their price and it was a fair price for the Martinis.  He then went on to tell us that he would be writing up the bartender who made us the drink and she would be disciplined.  What manager does that?!?!?  Why in the world would he tell us about his disciplinary actions towards his employees!!!????  I made sure to tell them that even though Cara may have made a mistake on the price, she was certainly a very good bartender and she should not be written up.  We then told him that we would never return to that restaurant, and he said that was fine and walked away.  I was astonished that a MANAGER at a restaurant of that caliber would talk to us that way, give us his disciplinary action details and not adjust the price of their Martinis to a price that we had already been paying and argued with us over $6.  Our argument was based solely on principle....when you charge a customer one price for something and then less than one hour later charge them more for the same item, THAT IS WRONG and he could not and would not see that or change it.  What if the difference had been more than $6??  What if it had been food?  I just can't see how you can run a restaurant that way and we were certainly NOT looking for freebies or handouts....we were just looking for a manager to DO WHAT WAS RIGHT!!!  
We asked our waiter, Luis for any other managers names so that we could make a complaint later and he gave us a couple of other names and we paid our bill and were about to leave.  
As we were about to leave, the General Manager, Moises came over and asked what the problem was.  We explained again and he understood and offered us a drink at the bar since we had already paid our bill.  While we were explaining the situation to Moises, the people dining next to us were frustrated too and spoke up....so at that point, I think Javier's had two tables of four people that were not happy at all.  We had to be at the show in 15 minutes and could not accept his offer for a drink, so he gave us his card and said to call him before dining there again.   The problem is that I am not sure that I want to dine there again and I am not sure what he would even do to make this a better experience.   I really have a bad taste in my mouth from the manager, Guillermo and how he handled their customers.   I have NEVER seen a manager handle a situation like that before and was SUPER DISAPPOINTED (and we have all been in the industry in the past as well)!!  In my opinion, I think Guillermo needs some additional training on customer service before they allow him to deal with people in the future!!",E7x6hdEptNRlcTsgFpC5Kw,10,0,1,BWytgDro9CvMwbMSZUNJiw

The thing that really brought this place down to a 2 star restaurant, however, was the service. I asked when the waiter came around if I could had my water refilled. Shouldn't even have to asked, but all right. He heard me and said yes, then disappeared. Then he was helping out other tables. Eventually I asked again, and this time, the same thing.

The hostesses are ALWAYS accommodating with or without a reservation. On the off chance you have to wait a little bit (depending on when you go), the bar usually has ample space. 

The service is spectacular. It honestly feels like the waiters/bus boys are watching your table constantly. I can honestly say they have never let our chip bowl even come close to empty before swapping it out with a fresh bowl...and they are endless. The chips come with salsa which is great, but if you're a regular you know to ask for ALL of their salsa options...they have a VERY spicy habenero and a mild tomatillo. They are also excellent at always making sure your water glasses are always full!

The food is unreal. I have never tried something I did not like. And, if they don't have something you want on the menu, they work with you to create it! My friend said he wanted the picture he saw on the strip which featured the chicken, beef, and veggie enchilada. That is not on the menu as an entree all together, and was only for picture purposes -but they made it happen. I have a few examples of this. If you have food sensitivities, or are gluten free you can easily find something you can eat, and if not, again - they will make it happen!

Some people are not a huge fan of the lighting - but I think the dimness pairs well with the decor and creates a sexy, intimate environment. 

It is a but pricey, but you get what you pay for and it is worth it!

The bathrooms should be a little bigger based on the size of the restaurant, but it is not that big of a deal!

5094860,2016-06-27,15,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"The authentic flavors of Mexico elevated through ingredients to five star status.  Outstanding.

Quality ingredients are key.  From sustainably sourced seafood to USDA Prime beef, to the freshest produce.  It shows clearly in the simple chips and salsa they offer.  The salsa, incredibly fresh, ripe, sweet tomato, prominent flavor of chilies, herbaceous freshness of cilantro and end notes of sulfurous onion.  Made multiple times daily, it shows.

Tip:  Not all dishes are available on the lunch menu.  Ask if your heart is set on a particular dish. They may be able to accommodate you.

Incredible ceviche.  The pulpo (octopus), tender slices, whose gentle sweetness is brought out by the lime juice acidity.  Bright and refreshing.

For mains, the Chile Negro.  Two short ribs, braised until fall apart tender in a chile negro sauce.  The sauce, a complex blend of spices and chilies, permeates the beef to its core.  An acidic zing from tomato paste shines through.  Sweet, earthy, brooding, mind boggling complex.   Outstanding.

Both the mole poblano and mole verde served over bone in chicken breast are excellent.  Incredibly complex, both showing a spice earthiness.  The poblano, a hint of bitterness, and the unmistakable flavor of chilies.  The verde, a more pronounced earthiness and richness of pumpkin seeds with a slightly fresher finish of green chilies.

The top seafood dish remains the Cabo Azul.  The dish is a sampler.  A stunning Maine lobster enchilada (so named because the enchilada is stuffed full with nothing but Maine lobster) in a creamy pasilla sauce that brightens every bite.  A grilled chile relleno stuffed with jack cheese shrimp and a mountain of sweet Dungeness crab topped with a light, earthy relleno sauce.  And third, an ungodly good shrimp taco, the shrimp lightly dusted with flour and fried in clarified butter for an unexpected crispness.  Served in a warm flour tortilla on a simple bed of lettuce with sour cream.  An incredible dish.

Excellent, efficient but patient service.  Servers understand the menu can be both foreign and unfamiliar.  Let them guide you.  Outstanding, friendly and knowledgeable bar tenders.  

Well chosen selection of tequila and mescal including some hard to find, rare gems.  Very well made margaritas.  The name sake Javiar, smooth, refreshing, and plenty strong to cut through any flavor and reset the palate well worth the premium price ($18).

Many repeat visits, always satisfying.

Hate to say it, but my expectations going in were pretty low. The chatter on Javier's was  ""over-priced"" ""not worth it"" ""underwhelming"" ""not real Mexican food."" How else was I to feel? After eating there not just once but three times, I'm happy to say that Javier's isn't so bad.

My Mexican friends are gonna kill me, but I actually like the food here! The selection isn't unique. You've got your usual meats, tacos, enchiladas, etc. Ingredients and recipes aren't creative masterpieces but the menu is easy to navigate and won't confuse you. The food tastes cleaner here--which can be expected. Meats and other ingredients are of a higher calibre and it really shows in the flavor. I can vouch for the Carne Tampiqueña and the Cabo Azul. And since everyone's #1 question is ""is the Carne Asada worth it""... No, it isn't. Not to say it isn't delicious but like kobe beef, I'm 99.9% sure its a gimmick to add intrigue. It worked on 2 of my friends so far!

Total date spot for sure. Its got the expensive, swanky feel without being overdone. The dark woods and leathers add to the luxurious ambiance but still make it warm and comfortable. The bar is under this massive rope chandelier and be sure to check out the world's largest chainsaw sculpture. It's actually pretty cool.

Service is up to fine-dining expectations and the bartenders are excellent. They've got a huge selection of tequila bordering the lines of ridiculousness. Some of them go up to $2,000. Of the ones I've tried, I highly recommend the Clase Azul. Sweet, smooth, and relatively reasonably priced at $20. I don't usually get mixed drinks, but they make a mean margarita.

I love their bottomless chips and salsa (guacamole  is extra ;) )   

I sometimes make a reservations if I know it's a busy night or weekend but it was last minute. They said it would be an hour and some wait for two. We sat at the bar ordered a drink got served chips but as soon as our drinks came out we got called no more than 10 minutes to our table!

It's loud with music like a lounge which makes it difficult to talk but that's the atmosphere, dim lighting so you have to use flash to take pictures. They are very attentive if you're running low on water , chips, and if you're down with your plate. Our waiter was great, and i can't find a bad thing to say about this place.

It's a bit expensive overall, but that's pretty much the only thing I can complain about here!  We received great service, the setting was very dim and romantic, and the food overall was good!

Started off with the Complimentary Chips and Salsa. So easy to get this wrong...but Javier's does it right!   

Ceviche de Camaron ($18). Great ceviche...just spendy. Some of the best ceviche I've had was only $3-5 and served in a plastic cup...this doesn't fare much better esp for the money. 

Shredded Beef Taquitos ($10): Avocado Sauce, Cotija Cheese, Sour Cream, Radish, Onion & Cilantro. There were 3 rolls here...pretty good!  Not sure if I would order them again though.

Eva went with the Cabo Azul ($30): Maine Lobster Enchilada in Creamy Pasilla Sauce, Grilled Chili Relleno with Monterey Jack, Shrimp and Dungeness Crab in Relleno, and Shrimp Taco Ensenada style. Lots going on here...everything was good, but I think the SHRIMP TACO was actually the best choice here.  Surprising I know!

I went with the Carnitas ($25): Michoacan style Pork served with Refritos, Guac, Salsa Quemada, Grilled Green Onions & Cilantro. This was delicious! SUPER flavorful carnitas...I've never had it like this before!  This dish would be highly recommended :P

Easily the most I've spent on Mexican food, but given the location, setting, flavor and service, it is a memorable dinner on the strip!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,1,4,0-E0xoZvHUBLdwVvVn6few

Unfortunately, the food isn't on par with everything else. The chips and salsa is great with the drinks, but the seafood quesadilla that I ordered was quite salty. Some of the standard mexican dishes that other people ordered didn't seem to pop out either.

For an upscale mexican restaurant, I was more than happy with everything but the main entree.

Now, if you are to take this wonderful experience and have admittedly some very nice tables and seating and throw fancy decorations on the wall, with mostly unauthentic servers, and have the same menu items at double or triple what it would normally cost AND your food doesn't taste near as good: that is what I experienced at Javier's.  At the end of the day I want to savor every bite.  I ordered the tampiqueña- a dish I have had before and absolutely loved at a family owned higher end place near Philadelphia, and I can't even compare the two honestly.

The restaurant is expansive, open and sexy, which means it would make a solid date spot. Dark woods and conversation pieces, including an impressive rope centerpiece at the bar and a huge chainsaw carving, make dining here interesting and inviting. I have dined at a table and at the bar, and both spots were comfortable. And, we received great service at both.  

The menu is extensive with options for everyone from a vegetarian to a steak lover to a pescatarian, so I think it will be easy to please everyone in a large party. Each meal starts with delicious chips and salsa, and if you want something with a strong kick, be sure to request the habanero salsa. The guac is not tableside, and it is pretty simple, but we have ordered it both times! As for entrees, my husband ordered the Azul trio which included a lobster enchilada, a relleno stuffed with crab and a shrimp taco. I could spy drool spilling from the corners of his mouth just looking at the plate. I have sampled the Chicken Picado (menu only has steak, but they made chicken by request) and the Mole. Both were fresh, well-prepared and generous.I can't say that the food is conquering new territories of culinary adventure, but they do Mexican well. 

I also spied tables with the tablita, a giant tray for two people to share create your own tacos. Next time, I want to try that. 

I haven't tried a margarita here, but listening to the bartenders, it sounds like they can make a primo one. 

Overall, what really pushes Javier's into a spot worth trying is the amazing ambiance and solid service. If you get there and there is a wait, remember bar seating is all first come, first serve!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,12,4,Dyc24MQk8TdZMhGTFC1Niw

I looked on their website and did not see an option to make a reservation online. They aren't on Open Table either so I called the restaurant to make a reservation since I was trying to squeeze dinner here in between an event and a show I had bought tickets for and knew I would be short on time.

When I got there they didn't have my reservation. It looked like the girl at the front counter was looking at a piece of paper with names printed on it and my name wasn't on her list. I was so bummed, I really wanted to try this place out and called weeks in advance to book a table a the time that I wanted. There was over an hour wait when I got there.

5323138,2014-09-08,1,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I was leery about Javier's at the Aria. It's Orange County namesake is a high-end, luxurious fiesta, and possibly the only Institution in a region bereft of heritage or culture. A high standard indeed, and I was wondering if Javier's had the hubris to compete with the other heavyweights on The Strip. After our huge party that was executed flawlessly by staff & kitchen, Javier's has proven to be beyond competitive, and an instant contender for best restaurant experience in Las Vegas.

We had 12 people, an instant clustermess for any restaurant, and we were seated on time on a Saturday night. The layout was spacious, and the raised ceilings allow for good acoustics, sight lines & style. Our server, Jose Luna, was one of the most efficient, professional servers with whom I've ever had the pleasure of interacting. He paced our table perfectly - no easy task at a rowdy bachelor party - without rushing us, keeping the stream of chips, surprisingly good (and spicy) table salsa, appetizers, meals and desserts at a steady clip. 

Now the food? The food was just shy of excellent. Interesting, unique expressions of standard dishes with an emphasis on seafood, the sauces are a testament to the seriousness which Javier's treats it's cuisine. The Fideo Del Mar was not, as named, a true fideo noodle; that's satisfactory as the linguine was a natural vehicle for the crab, shrimp and scallop in a light tomatillo cream sauce. The carnitas were voluptuous and delicious; the asada juicy and tender with the right amount of char. Both lacked a tad bit of salt, interestingly enough, so they weren't perfect - but definitely tasty. The desserts included a deep, flavorful flan and a wonderful fried ice cream with a frightfully seductive thin layer of shell. 

Worth noting specifically is the ceviche - fine, high-quality cuts of octopus, pescado (fish) and shrimp served in a piercingly acidic brine that highlights the succulence of the chemical-free, in-season seafood.

Really an outstanding meal, and worth every penny of the (relatively) high prices.",riETmgv8NnaNfTWhXc-XDA,3,3,5,x7bTe--ULVMuXHjb9JzCxg

5357405,2017-07-05,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"Javier's is a good Mexican restaurant located inside of Aria Hotel Casino.
Some things to try are the Sabor a Provincia which are two Empanadas, two small Quesadillas, two Taquitos, two Sopes.
Next I like the Nachos de la Casa they are made with Monterey Jack cheese, refritos, guacamole and sour cream, with your choice of shredded chicken, shredded beef or chorizo. Another favorite is the Fajitas you have the choice between Adobo marinated strips of natural chicken or Angus beef steak sautéed with pasilla chile, onion and tomato. Served with refritos, guacamole, sour cream and your choice of warm tortillas. The Enchiladas de Mariscos are also good you get Two enchiladas stuffed with shrimp and Dungeness Crab sautéed in butter, garlic, onion and wine, then covered in a tomatillo sauce, melted Monterey Jack cheese and garnished with avocado slices and sour cream. Served with arroz and refritos. All of the enchiladas are actually delicious but I don't have time to write all of them down for you so I just did one. The Carne Asada is also really good. It's made with New York Steak #1 prime center cut 12oz grilled and served with a grilled pasilla chile stuffed with cotija and Monterey Jack cheese. Served with refried black beans. The restaurant is located right on the casino floor which makes it nice and convenient if you're gambling and want to walk over and grab a bite to eat or  margarita.",tUJJr2fvXDLbo34i3UGAvg,0,0,4,R68yME2fOJadaCMWNojuMA

Totally not worth it and definitely not for more than 2 people. 2 people at our table ordered the same item for dinner and they both came out missing an item. Are you kidding me??

First off, I want to say that the service here was absolutely fantastic.  Our server, whose name escapes me, took great care of us throughout our meal.  I had never had mole sauce, and he brought us all some to try before we ordered.  I was immediately sold on it and ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce.  My wife ordered chicken tacos while my mom ordered the beef tacos.  It was a simple, yet very good lunch.  They give you chips and salsa when you sit down, so be careful not to fill up on those, as it's very good.  Everything here is very fresh and home made.

With super cool decor and some nice mood lighting, that is the first word that comes to my mind when I think of this restaurant.  On both of my visits I was lucky to be seated in a comfy, spacious booth in the back overlooking the whole place and was able to take in the ambiance.  That spot was great for people-watching!

They serve complimentary chips and salsa which taste amazing!  We totally could not stop eating them, even after our entrees came.  The salsa was tasty and the chips so crispy and not too greasy.  Yum!!  So good that we ended up coming back the next night as well!  Sorry, Chevys.  I now have a new favorite place for chips and salsa!   

As for my entrees, the first night I got the combination plate with one cheese enchilada and one crispy chicken taco.  Rice and refried beans came with my meal as well.  I enjoyed the taco but I've had better enchiladas elsewhere, so the next night I ended up getting the taco dinner (crispy chicken tacos again).  To drink that night I ordered a virgin strawberry margarita, which was pricey at $10 but really good.   Other items we tried: their guacamole and fried ice cream.  Their guac was fine though not as tasty as their salsa and not quite up there with Dos Caminos guac.  Their ice cream was ok as well.  I think we just got some to be able to hang out there a little bit longer :p

This place is so much busier than the restaurant that was here before, and with good reason.  Great atmosphere, tacos, virgin margaritas, and chips and salsa = one of my new favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,2,1,5,v1MD68N0t1x6FLBL9fCw8g

For drinks we got a Organica and a Tamarindo Margarita. Both were good as fuck with Organica being pure and el naturale and strong as fuck and the Tamarindo being a citrusy type mah gah ree ta.

Chef brought out the Sabor a Provincia which is two empanadas, two small quesadillas, two taquitos, and two sopes:

Empanadas were overall good

Taquitos were a little bit tooo crispy (if there is such thing) but the meat inside was tender and nice

Sopes were decent with fresh ingredients on top but....

Them Quesadillas were bomb.com....i usually do not care for cooked or hot seafood but these seafood quesadillas were the business. Drunk bougie food that El Chapo probably ate on a daily basis after he got fucked up with his homies...

Honestly you can order that plate as an entree and get full.

We always get seated quickly, EVERY server has been extremely knowledgable and friendly, and the bussers are also very attentive and friendly as well. The chips and salsa are great but we always make sure to get the guacamole. Javier's just does guacamole right! If you like spicy, ask your server for a spicier salsa. They have an orange habanero salsa that we love and it has major KICKKK!!! You can't go wrong here but some of our favorites for entrees are:

- Carnitas (get it with the corn tortillas!)
- Crab Enchiladas
- Filete Costeño (8 oz Filet Mignon #1 Prime Center Cut, with choice of Dungeness crab or Maine lobster enchilada, but we always get it with crab!)
- La Tablita (It's for 2 people per their menu but it's a BIG plate!) Prepare your own tacos with choice of two of the following - Angus Prime Skirt Steak, carnitas or grilled chicken. Served on a wooden platter with arroz, refritos, salsa quemada, guacamole, salsa fresca, jalapeño, grilled Mexican green onions and your choice of corn or flour tortillas.

For desserts, doesn't matter how full we are, we always order the Flan and the Fried Ice Cream! The flan isn't your run of the mill flan. It's hearty, rich, dense, eggy goodness! DO NOT pass this up. You'll thank me later. The fried ice cream isn't actually fried. The cinnamon sugar crust that the cornflake coated ball of ice cream sits in is what's actually fried. We've also tried the Pastel de Guayaba which had really nice authentic guava flavor, Pan de Elote which was moist and tender, and the Pastel Tres Leches (rich, decadent but not overly sweet, so good!)

We had a really disappointing experience at this restaurant. The wait time we were given was 30-45 minutes. It was over an hour. We came right back when they called us. There was a line of people waiting to put their name on the list to get in, so we walked around to the side (where the hostess meets you to walk you to your table) and told them we were back. The woman we had initially talked to was nice to us (seriously, she was the best part of the whole experience), but the woman I encountered when I checked back in with them was really rude. 

It took a long time to get any attention after we were seated, which was obnoxious because we were super hungry after our hour+ wait. The table next to us was seated after us, but got service way before us. On our other side was an 8 top with a bunch of young guys and some women we were pretty sure were escorts. 

Our server wasn't very welcoming, nice, or helpful. He seemed annoyed when we didn't order drinks (they were pretty expensive and we were pretty much over drinking at that point in our trip!)

The guac we got was totally plain and boring. It was literally just smashed avocados and a dash of salt served on a wilted piece of lettuce. 

My meal came out wrong. My enchiladas came out with NO SAUCE on them. They just brought me sauce on the side. I also was served the wrong kind of beans. When I mentioned this there was no apology of offer to correct it. I mentioned it twice and each time the person just said 'ok!' and walked away. I was really confused. 

We got pretty much NO service from our server as he was busy with the 8 top next to us. We couldn't even flag him down. The bus boys were nice, but we still lacked the service and continuity that even a mediocre server gives. 

Service ranked at zero stars, and I'd rate the food really low, too. My food wasn't good, but there were components that were tasty and I suspect that they can crank out some good stuff when they pull it together. Overall, though, the experience was really terrible. It's been a few weeks and I'm still thinking about how lame it was. 

Also, it was super loud. This might be great if you're getting ready to party, but we were already partied out. We wanted to relax and have a good meal and this place was absolutely the wrong choice for that.",WqfKtI-aGMmvbA9pPUxNQQ,5,0,1,oPbusYzqP9PgoVrkB3wgGA

- New York steak #1 prime center cut 6oz grilled, accompanied $34 by a mole chicken enchilada and taquito. Served with guacamole and refritos. The steak was a bit tough but the enchilada and taquito were tasty.

If I had to find one positive, we didn't get sick from the food so I guess that's a win? But the food tasted more like cafeteria slop rather then what we recall from last year.

My friend and I ordered the chicken tacos to share. 
When the food arrived we noticed the tacos had guacamole on them. The menu didn't say that guacamole came on the tacos. My friend I was sharing with is allergic to avocado so we had to send them back. I asked for guacamole on the side since I wanted guacamole on my tacos. Another friend of mine was less than happy with her meal and didn't take more than 2 bits of her meal.  We asked to waitress to talk to the manager. The waitress was sweet but seemed new and didn't know much about the menu.
The manager seemed afraid to come talk to us and didn't want to anything to help us with our issues. The manager, waitress and another man who looked like he may have been another manager stood at the computer for a good 15 minutes just staring and us and the computer. What's so hard about working with a customer who was not impressed with the restaurant at all. By this time we were pretty pissed off. A girlfriend of mine got up and went to talk to them one on one since she worked in the restaurant/nightlife industry. This is not rocket science. By the time we got the check they charged me for my side of guacamole which I was confused because guacamole supposedly came on the tacos.
As we were about to leave a group of guys came over to us and offered to buy us drinks. We got the guys to buy us 2 bottles of Cristal spending well over $2,000 at the restaurant in 10 minutes. I hated to give them that kind of business but hey I guess they should have been thanking us and maybe treated us a little better earlier that night. Next time I'll take my business somewhere else and make them money. 

I do recommend the Javier's in Newport",Ir1y8rz6jHF1fC4YPPNDGg,1,1,2,CZWoFsmzRjjCad9bU_-xFg

My wife and I were kindly seated in one of the cool booths which gave us a great view of those amazing wood carvings of the dead.  I'd love to know how much they actually cost.  

We were in a rush to catch Zarkana so we didn't dilly dally with any appetizers but the salsa that came with the chips was muy delicioso.  My wife ordered the ""Cabo Azul"" which was basically a seafood combo.  The most eyecatching thing in the combo was the lobster enchilada but it turned out to be just OK.  The grilled chile relleno which was really big and stuffed with cheese, shrimp, crab and topped with tomatillo sauce was mouthfuls of awesomeness.  They actually served the shrimp taco on a separate plate and that was very good too.  

I ordered the carnitas based on the waiter recommendation.  I didn't know what to expect since the priciest carnitas I'd ever had before this was $12.  But I was pleasantly surprised when he brought it over.  The plate featured 3 parts of the pig including ribs, tenderloin and shoulder.  SOO good!  The waiter informed me that the pork is marinated for 24 hours, deep fried and then finished in an oven.  If KFC started frying pork, it would kind of taste like this.  The was crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.

That being said, everything else about my dinning experience at Javier's was mediocre.  

We made our journey down to the Aria to eat here specifically on my friends request because it's one of his favorite places to eat in California.

I ordered a chopped salad with chicken at $22 I was expecting one of the best salads I've ever had to come out of the kitchen, not the case.  Lacked dressing, portion was small and no wow factor.  I would have been much better off going to Chipotle and concocting my own salad creation and saving $15 lol.

My friend was saying the Vegas Javier's just isn't as on point as the one in Newport he frequents but he was still happy and really enjoyed his meal, which was a taco combination plate. (Why I gave them 3 stars, otherwise this would of been a solid 2 star experience)

The bartender was very forthcoming in letting me know what his favorite salad was which turned out to be a great recommendation, and he also recommended a reasonably priced aÑejo tequila to sip on, which I appreciated. 

The salad that was recommended was the Ensalada de Salpicon. The ingredients were really simple, and I was afraid perhaps too simple, but when it arrived, it was perfectly seasoned. The chicken was marinated as well as the cabbage itself and shredded, not wedges of cabbage as I was afraid it would be (you know how sometimes presentation is so focused on the aesthetic value that to eat it takes a village - it wasn't the case here). 

The tequila also turned out to be delicious. I asked for a nice, sipping tequila and hoped for one that wouldn't cost me $50, and the Azunia Añejo came highly recommended, and throughout the meal, deeply enjoyed (yes, my feeling about tequila can come off as sexual). 

Even though this was the most expensive $^&%&^$ cabbage I've ever had, I know it's Vegas, and needless to say, I wouldn't expect them to leave money on the table when everyone is charging really expensive prices. That's the only reason they didn't 5 stars (cause they weren't a ""bargain"").

We came here as a small group of four, and right off the bat the staff was welcoming and accommodating.  We came with an open mind, knowing that prices on the strip are much more than similar places off the strip.  It was a night out, so not a big deal.  

We sat under the huge wood piece of the dead, which looks fantastic in a Mexican restaurant!  If it were anywhere else, I'd say let's go someplace else.  I ordered the fajitas de pollo, but it came out as the fajitas de beef.  Still, it was very tasty, so no complaints here.  Not a lot of food for the price, but I ate the hell outta their chips and salsa, so I was none too hungry.  Now I rarely drink, but I had to try their margarita de grenada, the pomegranate one.  For $15, it better have some kick to it.  Someone tell me why it was like drinking generic brand kool-aide?  Really!  It had about as much alcohol content as a bottle of water.  Pathetic.

I've heard many times how amazing Javier's *OC location* is. I even heard it is the best Mexican place around and a friend even boasted that another friend of his that was living in Mexico City would come to town and eat here! Having recently traveled to Mexico City (loved the food) I had to give it a try. 

I was traveling for work and this restaurant is at the Aria, so super convenient.

My chicken polbanas enchilada was on par with my favorite in Santa Fe and the scallops were fresh , seared perfectly and met the exacting standards of my wife, the persnickety Mingster. They charge a good buck for the food, but amazingly it was worth it.

While our first bartender was friendly enough, he went on break shortly after he served our drinks and we didn't see him again. In his place was a surly man that clearly did not want to be there and hates his life. Our food came, and I did not like the dressing that came with my salad. When I asked the surly bartender to swap it out, he literally acted as if I was asking him for one of his kidneys. I asked for one of the other vinaigrettes that I saw came with a different salad, and he claimed it did not exist. He was literally looking at me and my friend as if he hated us, and we are quite pleasant people. Ha! Also, he only gave us the copy to sign when he brought us the bill. When I asked for a copy to take home, again he glared at us. Not a pleasant dining experience at all.

Food wise, my chopped salad likely would have been good if I had had a dressing to go with it. The one that was originally brought to me was way over seasoned with black pepper, so much so that I sneezed when I tasted it. They did include plenty of shrimp, so no complaints there. My friend said his mole chicken was just OK, so wouldn't recommend that. The chips were fresh and the salsa was tasty.

And we wanted a long meal, don't get me wrong, but I had to waive down the staff a number of times to just try to get what you wanted.  So they had a lot of staff working there but our party of 11 or 12 had to kind of keep the staff on their toes to get beers and we had to ask for everything, it wasn't a how's your meal or do you need more water or a drink.

Ceviche was good. Overall a pricey meal but unique enough dinner orders to justify it, thus the four stars.  I'd bet a smaller party would yield better service?",lZ6AwE7nQxRjkxRKenMD7w,0,0,4,M7jRh3sEFqvAi7dbfR8Vmw

The place has a unique but dark decor, dim lighting and is surprisingly quiet for being right in the center of the casino. When looking at the menu, your first thought, might be ""wow this is some overpriced Mexican food"" having eaten at some of my best meals throughout Mexico, I consider myself very selective when it comes to Mexican restaurants. But here at Javier's I was very pleased with my meal. From the start, the service was excellent. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the tequilas and the drink options, which was very helpful in selecting. We started our meal with the Ceviche de Pulpo (octopus) which was very good! The freshness of the ingredients, especially the pulpo, was amazing! Tasted the same as if I was eating it on the beach in Mexico. Our entree's were brought out quickly and the presentation was perfect. It didn't appear there was a single grain of rice out of place. The food was just as delicious as it looked. If I must find a flaw somewhere, my only criticism would be the beans. They were a little too simple and bland for me, but I still happily ate every single one. I am looking forward to returning, but because of the price, this might be more of a special occasion meal than a regular dinning experience and night out for me.",EO4u5xVUf1Bp6hwlTsiDfg,1,0,5,Sc77Nkcj6ghWchd_dXI7sg

We decided to sit at the bar to have some good conversation. The employees here were really friendly. FYI, the chairs at the bar are extremely heavy. Anyhow, we were given some chips and salsa to start. We ordered this seafood ceviche as an appetizer which was decent although the lemon was overpowering. Then, we ordered some drinks and some tacos. At least the tacos were a reasonable size for the amount that you are paying for them. 

Of course after a few drinks, I needed to use the restroom. There is an attendant in the restroom which I suppose in a high end restaurant is expected, although weirded me out initially.

Poor Service: The restaurant was at maybe 10-20% capacity, so a restaurant inside Aria and priced at this level, one would expect decent service, not so. We did not receive a glass of water or cocktails (ordered soon after sitting down) until well after the food had arrived and a complaint was made. After the complaint, the server went to speak with the manager and all we got was a glance, smirk, & no apology or anything to remedy the service

Overpriced Food:  $120 for 2 people including 1 drink each is an expensive Mexican joint. Now don't get me wrong, we were fully aware of the price going in, but when one can get better service & food for $100 less...

Food Quality: All the food came out luke warm, and the chile relleno, undercooked. Actually, the re-fried beans did come out hot, 10 minutes after the rest of the food had already been dropped off. 
Cutting into a chile relleno the consistency of rubber, using a butter knife, does not make for an enjoyable meal. After the waitress dropped off the food, she did not check up on us again until the re-fried beans were dropped off, It was then that she asked if everything was okay, and while we did mention the inedible relleno, we did not feel like waiting for another to arrive. 

By the end of the meal, it was clear both my girlfriend and I were more than disappointed with the overall experience. We thought they may take care of at least the drinks or take a bit off the overall bill...nope, full bill & no apology.",sxUPDcifGilxv8blIMZvWA,2,0,1,GMd5pOhWYhkLrKZUw6uaZw

This place is NOT that at higher prices, this place is a tasty, strong value restaurant in City Center.

We had the chile verde pork, skirt streak, taco/crab enchilada/lobster enchilada combo, skirt steak chopped salad, and ribeye.  All were expertly cooked and prepared. 

Ribeye was medium pink all through. Significantly better than say my experience at CraftSteak.
Pork chunks had a wonderful spicy sauce gravy kick
Chopped salad was a very good blend of dressing, roasted corn, salad and skirt steak
Cabo azul enchilada combo had PACKED lobster and crab, no fillers here.

 It came, but was blander than the regular.  They messed it up or had no idea how to make it.  MINUS  ANOTHER STAR. 

Ordered beans.  Side came: literally two spoons of beans on a small plate.  PATHETIC!  MINUS TWO MORE STARS.  See picture!!!

Beans were $5!   Absurd, for 2-3 ounces!  MINUS ONE STAR. 

Drink was tasty, but extremely sour.  MINUS ONE STAR. 

This place has great tasting food, but due to the above details, I can't give it more than one star.",WFcDOsTSZwOHE77H_bL1fA,1,0,1,PnAY1S39nZC70uxmP90NPw
5899854,2014-07-15,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I really enjoyed our experience here! We were looking for a wonderful last meal in Vegas and this was it. We had guacamole and each had the steak tacos. It was delicious. I had a Cadillac-type margarita. The only thing was that the waitress forgot about my second margarita, which is not a big deal, but then she acted like she just left it on the bar. Lol. I'm not that dense. I wouldn't have minded waiting for a fresh one, not one she took from another order. Despite this, she was mostly sweet and everyone was very friendly. The ambiance was beautiful and it was easy to get a quick reservation, which is nice, because some places in Vegas really make it difficult, so I appreciate the accommodation. We were sat in a large booth that made it seem very intimate which is nice because Vegas can be a little overwhelming so it's nice to have some quiet time. Also, I didn't mind the prices. It was actually cheaper than a lunch we had at the Wynn. However, it's still expensive in terms of Vegas, I just thought it was a slightly better deal and definitely more worth it.  Wish I had room for dessert. Don't miss this spot if you go to Vegas!",lFMzI5MDMmOTZ8qji4TzGA,0,0,5,OsBMeCWdVbZ-lJKbDZ04aQ
5901999,2017-09-20,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"I loved the ambiance and decor in this restaurant. Absolutely stunning. They have a massive hand carved piece towards the back, the rest of the walls throughout looked like salt walls, and the shape of the pillars gave it a cathedral feel. 
Upon arrival (with a reservation) we waited at least 10 minutes. I didn't like how there was no seated waiting area, you're just standing, in the casino. 
The lady who sat us was not friendly, didn't care to engage in any conversation or even give eye contact. Our waiter seemed as if he was sarcastic with us, like he was forcing himself to be nice. There was an incident where he seemed to be agitated that he had to repeat himself. 
For drinks we ordered the signature Javier over ice with a salt rim. That was one strong drink! Very delicious. 
The chips and salsa was also very delicious. I loved that the salsa had a nice garlic taste with a bit of spice. 
For an appetizer we had the shrimp ceviche. It comes on a plate topped with Serrano peppers. It was just okay. It was a little fishier than I expected and the shrimp tasted as if was soaked in salt.
For my main course, we ordered the pollo asado and the Cabo azul. I didn't try the pollo asado so I can't give a review on it, but it came with a side of guac, which was great. Very fresh. My Cabo azul was good. Very unique eating lobster enchiladas, I'd order it again. The shrimp taco had great flavor, the black beans and rice were very authentic also. For dessert we had Pastel De Chocolate. It was very delicious, the cake has a fudge texture. Regular vanilla ice cream inside a churro-like bowl. Overall the expierence was just okay and the food was good, but not stellar.",Mr_rX79FfTdwGqJFJT4Zbg,0,0,3,GhNPcoQH4p-x_Mi-ZNTJKw

Start with one of their signature cocktails and enjoy their chips and salsa. Try the Tablita, a DIY taco platter served on a plank (this is enough for 3-4 to share or two extremely hungry people). You can try a combination of proteins (chicken, steak or pork) as well as corn or flour tortillas (ask for both). All of the flavors are well balanced but you can add jalapeños for that extra kick of spice.

Perhaps like some others have said I'm spoiled with Mexican food back in California but it was simply okay. One person at our table ordered a $20 quesadilla which we assumed would be spectacular for $20... Nope. Just a quesadilla with a small amount of guac and sour cream on the side.

The worst part was the $18 margaritas. They basically tasted like sour mix and weren't large. I might as well have gone into the casino just out the door (remember it's a lounge as much as a restaurant) and gamble away my $18 and gotten a free house margarita with the 1% chance of winning something.

The service was good which was a bummer because I felt compelled to tip well since the expensive crappy food wasn't there fault. Oh the two stars are for the decent unlimited chips and salsa!!",UyKVmpHUcsk_tjcspIWUow,1,0,2,D7FeIxweSN3sw8vQ9eDL_w

5986225,2017-02-23,0,Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,"After having authentic Tex-Mex cuisine in Texas last summer, I thought it was time to have REAL ""Mexican"" food to see if it can be comparable to restaurants such as Anamia's in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.  

That's where Javier's comes in.  I read that there are a couple of Southern California locations in both Irvine and Newport Beach, so Las Vegas shouldn't be any different.  My dad told me that [Javier's]' chips and salsa were to die for, and he was right.  The chips were crisp and hot, and the salsa had that nice ""cantina"" style taste like you would find in any Mexican restaurant.

For the appetizer, we did the Octopus Ceviche, which was GOOD.  The octopus didn't taste chewy, and it also included some scallop bits along with some vegetables such as cucumbers and avocados.  There was also a lemon wedge on the side in case you want a more citrusy taste to the Ceviche.

I ordered the Chili Negro which is a short-rib dish made with a chili negro sauce (hence the dish name ""Chili Negro), and the ribs had a really smoky taste to them, which I loved.  I was a bit disappointed that they didn't put a lot of rice on the dish (seemed like they only put one spoonful of rice on), and the sauce?  It's good, but people really need to know when to not overpowering the dish with such flavor (even though flavor can be a good thing).

Okay, I wouldn't want to fly (or drive, for that matter) all the way to Vegas for Javier's since they have a couple of Southern California locations in Irvine and Newport.  But, I'll definitely return to Javier's for Mexican food (just go to a place that's closer to me).",eGigAKj_thnsmkNXnmjr4A,1,0,4,0fj_R7SoctBaw-SF41xuCQ
