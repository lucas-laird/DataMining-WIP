Prices were very reasonable and there is a unique selection of sodas/drinks.  There's also a bakery/dessert rack at the entrance, so of course we got some of those to go on the way out.  Too stuffed to eat dessert right away.  
If I could do it again, I would order the extra calzone sauce to dip for a $1.

Both my fiancé and I got calzones. There are about 10 seats in the entire place so do not plan on eating there, it was just awkward. I guess they heavily rely on carry out? We ate our calzones at the bar with wooden forks, that's all they offered along with paper straws which do not work well at all. When the calzones came out they had already been cut with the stuff falling out of both of our calzones. They also serve the food on paper so when you cut your calzone, you get pieces of wet paper with your calzone too. The calzones were also really wet themselves. It guess they were not cooked long enough because the insides were wet/gooey. The food wasn't terrible but the flavors were not great it was wasn't good enough to overlook some of the things we experienced.

It's tucked away and would not have found it otherwise (Thanks Yelp!!), a hidden gem! Upon entering my family and I were greeted very warmly. We were asked if we had ever eaten there before and had everything explained to us. They have 30 flavors of Italian sodas to pick from, homemade desserts and by far the BEST calzones I've ever had! Everything is made from natural ingredients. Time for some individual reviews!

Customer service 5/5 They are the very attentive and wanted to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Even waited while we tasted our Italian sodas to make sure we liked them! Top Notch!

Cleanliness 5/5 This place is eat off the table clean. I like the spacious feeling when I walk in. No clutter. Everything is spread out. love it!

Italian Sodas 5/5 My husband had the Cherry flavor and I had Kiwi. DELICIOUS!!!

Calzones 5/5 I had a custom calzone made. Provolone/Mozz/red sauce/chicken/artichoke hearts/spinach. It was the bomb-diggity!! Soft, non-greasy bread (bread is hand-made in restaurant), all the ingredients were fresh!! My husband and daughter loved theirs as well. Husband had the Pesto chicken and Daughter had the Pepperoni. 

Chocolate Des Leches- OMG, we ate this before our calzones came (backwards day) and it was perfect!!!! They give you little wooden sporks to eat it with, very nice touch!

Tips!!!! 
**We received our Chocolate Des Leches for FREE by checking in on Yelp! 

**Also, they give you a cute little stamp card. Every 5 calzones you purchase, you get the 6th free!!

The facility is small which I like and the people who own it are wonderful.  The lady who took my order was very helpful in guiding me through their options.  I opted for her favorite, the Buffalo Chicken.  I didn't consider a Calzone restaurant a bakery until I took my first bite of the Calzone.

It is a casual restaurant located in the northwest part of the valley. Everything is homemade and the results are nothing short of genius. I enjoyed a Canadian bacon and pineapple calzone and my husband had the combo calzone. We also had Italian soda. This was my first one and now I am afraid that I am hooked.

811748,2014-12-20,3,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"Presto was brought to my attention by my son.  As an Elite Yelper, Ty has traveled the foodie superhighway with a turbocharged appetite.  He's been there and done that. And then done it again.  Being that we have similar tastes, I trust his judgement so I was excited to give Presto a try.  However, I'd forgone writing this review after my first visit and have since returned to Presto on multiple occasions.  

I've been in Vegas almost my entire life, so I know what customer service was like in this town 25 years ago, and I know what customer service has become today.  Presto shines like a beacon in the night in the nutritionally desolate Northwest, a testament to superb service and extraordinary eats.

Fresh baked, made-from-scratch calzones, tasty sweets and refreshing, hand crafted Italian sodas are the staples of the menu.  Don't worry if you don't get to try them all on your first visit.  You'll definitely be back.

The calzones are flavorful, robust, and completely satisfying.  The dough is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy.  There is no skimping on the fillings, and the ingredients are very obviously fresh and never frozen.  I would highly recommend the Combo; a delicious mix of veggies and meats packed tightly in a little pocket of bready heaven.  Spring for the marinara and ranch dipping sauces as well, you won't regret it.

The sweets, like the calzones, are also made fresh.  Seasonal cookies, cakes and sweet breads are the common fare, and they are as delicious as they look.  The pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting is my personal favorite; I'll be sad when those disappear after the holidays.

Presto has a smaller dinning room with just a few tables and chairs, but the place is consistently spotless.  The layout has changed a couple of times since my first visit, but that is to be expected with a new business.  

The staff, like the food, is far superior to what we have grown accustomed to in Vegas.  Everyone I have had interaction with at Presto has been professional, courteous, and has treated me as if I was their best customer.  Genuine smiles, helpful suggestions about the menu, and every request met without hesitation is only part of the reason that Presto is quickly climbing the charts as one of my favorite places to eat.

Stop by, pick up a calzone, a cookie, and a soda.  You'll thank me for it.  Just like I thanked my son.",pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,5,3,5,yWWpHA_T26aCKxlRAAFsOQ

Service: +1 

Found this place while in the area. Ordered the combo calzone and it was delicious! Wasn't too doughy nor too cheesy. Upon first look at the calzone, it looked small, but after eating it, I was definitely full. The red sauce was great as well and not as salty as some places make it to be. The wooden spork was a fine little touch. 

Check in for a nice surprise :) Cookie (Marry Me Cookie I think?) was excellent too. Wasn't too hard or soft and wasn't diabetes-causing sweet. In fact, most of the baked desserts I saw looked pretty appetizing...Also got the mango lemonade popsicle, which was alright. Liked the sour kick to it, but it wasn't anything mindblowing. 

Service was excellent. Lady who took the orders explained pretty much everything and then some about the store which was nice. She also checked in mid-meal to see how everything was going, which is always nice, and quickly answered our questions. 

Interior decor: yea it may need a little work I suppose, but I don't mind it at all. It was clean, food was great and that's all that matters.

1389215,2017-01-08,2,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"Presto calzone honestly does have a pretty tasty calzone. I had the buffalo chicken and thought it was pretty good with a side of ranch. My only suggestions would be to make it slightly spicier, make sure the inside is cooked more thoroughly, have more of a blue cheese interior or dipping sauce for this particular calzone, and have metal forks available for use. I also felt like the interior design could use some work for a place that has such high ratings on yelp. My wife also felt like hers was too cheesy, but I'm a cheese lover so I thought it was good. Service was great and I'm honestly only giving it 3 stars to have the yelp stars be more realistic. This is not a 4.5-5 star place, it should be a 3.5 star or around there. 4.5 star places are places you would literally eat 3 times a week. I would eat here monthly at the most. That's just my opinion. 
With all of that being said, I definitely would suggest trying it. I've been told that if you're a calzone lover then this is place to go. Price point is very fair for the amount of food and quality of ingredients.

The young woman at the register noticed the error, called the other customer to inform them of the mixup and apologized to me and informed me this order was on the house. It was probably my 10th or 11th time eating there and the first issue I've ever encountered and they took care of it immediately.

Had a pepperoni calzone. Disappointing.
Tasteless. It was like eating a good sub roll that was hollowed out and someone threw in some mozzarella and pepperoni. 
I should preface I am from East coast so I have different idea of what calzone should taste like. Usually even pepperoni calzones have ricotta cheese in with the meat and mozzarella and more meat. Usually a bit more sauce. Outside is usually brushed with butter/garlic a little salt.
Often the filling is seasoned as well.
Dough is a heavier dough more bread like and a bit thicker than traditional.

Overall, I hope they do well. I will try again to be fair. For now, I recommend adding some flavor at least to the pepperoni and cheese calzone.",yhHsw9Uf24S8G8Gf3MnE_Q,0,0,3,pHpCdW_44ij2tBeQ2AzGHA

The spinach and chicken that wifey got was the bomb. The ingredients and the garlic sauce they use was very flavorful. The crust wasent over done and it was a really good size even for a big guy like me.

The Presto veggie calzone arrived hot, filled with mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, and white sauce (bechamel), and delicious with a side of tomato sauce for dipping. Italian sodas are available from a long list of flavors with or without cream. The hibiscus and melon sodas were both tasty and not too sweet.

The quaint little restaurant only has seating for about 10 people.  The decor is very clean and simple design, from the butcher paper menu roll, to the chalk board dessert menu you can tell that the creativity and individuality is in abundance in this small space. 

On the wall they have the fresh but ready made calzone menu on the wall with the daily features.  Looks like 5 offerings a day stuffed with your favorite pizza combinations like a meat lovers, a combo, a Canadian bacon and pineapple plus   the buffalo chicken and the balsamic.  All ingredient combo's sounded delicious but I went with the Combo which was stuffed with pepperoni, housemade sausage, salami, green pepper, mozzarella cheese, stuffed in side a nice hand tossed dough with a buttery topping and a hint of cornmeal for ease of exit from the oven. A few short moments went by and my calzone was delivered to the table.  At first glance I thought to my self this is going to be amazing just by the look.  Looks were not deceiving here every last bite was amazing including the marinara dipping sauce that accompanied the calzone.  

For my drink I decided on one of the house made Italian sodas with 30 different flavors to choose from.  You can pick more than one if you like and also add some cream for more richness.  I tried Blood Orange with Mango and cream and it was yummy.  The two flavors paired nicely and did not overpower one another. The slightly sour from the blood orange balanced nicely with the sweetness of the mango.  

For dessert I tried one of there housemade apricot popsicles.  These area seasonal offerings so they change flavors often.  Other choices available were spicy pineapple which caught my attention but I was planning on sharing with the little one so that choice was off the table.  You could taste the fresh fruit natural flavor encased inside this frozen block. 

I will be back very soon to Presto Calzone Bakery.  The service was friendly and helpful.  I like the eco-friendly and sustainable wooden utensils and the paper straws.  These people are doing it right.  The ingredients are real and fresh and put together within the four walls of this little space.  I might even go back for seconds tonight for dinner.  It was that good. Presto Calzone also carries take and bake pizza's, and little pies for dessert. Give them a try you will not be disappointed.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,1,0,5,RlxxMU43KTyKEiXIJIsMfg

First, the women working in there were very nice and helpful. Everything seems to be made from scratch, including the ranch and homemade Popsicles. They buy as much as they can locally from Gilcrease Orchard it seems. 
The menu: They had either 7 or 9 (can't remember) calzones that were baked that day, meaning those are the ones you have to choose from if you're dining in. For take and bake you can order any calzone or pizza on the menu, those you take to go and bake at home. You can call ahead as well. There was also a salad on the menu that looked pretty good. They have large homemade cookies and a couple other breads, homemade Popsicles, as mentioned, and Italian sodas (with or without cream). We ordered 3 calzones (choice of ranch or red sauce on the side with each). The crust has a good flavor and I'd be curious to try a pizza, but for me the calzone crust was just too thick, too much dough. In fact, the thickest parts were still just slightly doughy in the center. My husband and I a prefer a much thinner calzone crust. The kids liked it. 
They do have a generous punch card, buy 5 and you get one free. 
I really do hope they succeed. They will need some word of mouth advertising because the location isn't very noticeable. Maybe they're still waiting on signage, but I couldn't find them until I was in front of their door (they are next door to Algobertos tacos). 
Give them a try. We will probably try a take and bake pizza next time.",rdz9QHEPoecQ7DJk49ZI-g,1,0,4,G8hxtwgYjEKvTT_ocvVPsg

We got a free Popsicle with our order for bringing in a flyer we chose a peach greek yogurt Popsicle. I would definitely go back at least just for the Popsicle. But! We also got a free dessert for checking in! We tried the lemon with cheese cake frosting a little dense for cake but still yummy. I like that they grated plenty of lemon peel to put in the cake. We also ordered a bottle of water which brought out total out to 18 bucks for everything we got. Great price for two for all the things we got. They have awesome service they offered us two large cups of ice to go with our water. And the best part is that the calzones are made to order and didn't take that long to cook! And they were cooked great perfect crunchy outside and cheesy goodness and other things inside. I wish I would have ordered the marinara sauce instead of the ranch but it was still good with the ranch. We will definitely be back because we have a punch card now and we need to buy 3 more calzones to get a free one! Can't beat that!,OeSfTJ84q7zOZTXuaSOCpQ,0,0,4,YL_kq8TwuqT1_rqZBDmBBw

Sadly we forgot for a while (it is kinda tucked back in the shopping center). We recently received a flyer for this restaurant and it reminded as we wanted to go back, so we did. 

We just finished eating. The food is amazing! It is very fresh. They have pizzas and calzones. The calzones are their specialty. You can order them to go order them to take home and bake or he them at the restaurant. We got a combination and it was amazing! We ordered a box of 6 calzones to take home with us for the family

They have fresh homemade cookies as well. We got a peanut butter cookie and a ginger doodle. We also got some specialty sodas. I tried the banana cream soda. It was pretty damn good.

Even better than the food is the service. The owner is very sweet and helpful.

Finally I have to mention the added fun details that this place has. They have old fashion paper straws and wooden utensils and paper bags and specialty Italian sodas and a lot of other small details that really make a difference.

3167894,2014-10-15,3,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"Anyone who lives in the Northwest knows that it's slim pickins for quality food spots. It's even more rare for us to see a new restaurant in the area that isn't a chain or franchise. So, when I saw Presto Calzone Bakery set to open their doors, I'll admit I was a little more than excited.

Located in a small center just off Farm & Cimarron, directly next door to Algoberto's, PCB is a family owned and operated ""bakery"" with an entirely new concept, one that I have personally never seen before. Instead of offering a build your own style, like I originally thought it was, Presto actually offers calzones in two ways. Both are technically pre-made, but you have the option to dine-in with your choice of a warmed and ready to eat calzone...or get one to go as a take and bake style. Home baking time recommended is about 7 minutes, and the owners claim these can be frozen for weeks at a time to bake at a later date as well. 

When it comes to the calzones themselves, the dough is definitely a huge part of the success. It's baked fresh everyday and has great consistency. If I had any complaints, it's that one of the calzones we ordered had a slightly crispier exterior, most likely due to sitting in the warmer too long. I prefer a softer, more chewy dough, and the other one we had was exactly like that, so I guess that's more of a personal preference thing. As far as fillings go, there's several different choices depending on if you want it there or to take home. We ended up with the Italian Combo and Pepperoni Combo. And although a little light, the ingredients seemed fresh and at only $6, it's a good deal that should satisfy most appetites. 

One of the most interesting things about PCB is their Italian soda bar. The owners son is a professional bartender/mixologist and has spent hours creating nearly 30 custom flavors. These are completely separate from the bottled & canned sodas in the fridge, and at the time of my visit, a full menu wasn't yet available. I was offered a sample of one flavor called the Southern Seas though, and it was crazy delicious. Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who doesn't drink soda at all. It had several fruits and ginger mixed in making for a very unique flavor that was both refreshing and extremely addicting.

For those looking for something sweeter, they're also baking up several different homemade desserts. Being that it was new, of course we had to get one of everything they currently had. We tried the pumpkin pie w/ cream cheese frosting, the zucchini bread and an apple crumble. Both the cake and bread were some of the moistest I've ever had and the apple crumble was like a fresh baked apple pie, just in mini size. With each one ringing in at under $3, it's a steal.

After speaking with the owner and her aunt and uncle who were helping that night, we learned that she used to sell her calzones in larger quantities to ski lodges in California. When she came to Vegas, she started serving some of her most popular items, but there's a lot more in the works. Not only just savory items, but she's been working on seasonal and dessert calzones. Personally, I would really like to see a build your own type setup, but currently that's not something being considered. Either way, PCB is a hugely welcome addition to the Northwest and I'm pretty excited to see what's in store, and to see them succeed.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,9,6,4,qfRdllzn14hHWbeHb2wuLw

My husband got pepperoni and mozzarella and he loved it (this was the first calzone he has ever had). I got Italian sausage, ricotta, mozzarella and black olives (yummy), it was soooo delicious. The bread is soooo good, and so fresh. 

The only complaint I have (which is why this is 4 stars and not 5) is because you have to pay an extra $1 for marinara dipping sauce. I believe it is pretty customary that calzones come with marinara. I do understand that this isn't typical marinara sauce (it is homemade and very good) but to pay an extra $1 for something that SHOULD come with the item I'm getting is a bit absurd to me. 

With a yelp check on you get a free dessert. I chose the big chocolate cookie. My daughter who is almost 2 LOVED the cookie. My husband who does not like sweets at all devoured most of it. So I would say it was great as well.

3520222,2015-02-04,28,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"Presto Calzone Bakery is a tasty little gem. They offer a variety of calzones, pizzas, baked goods and have a large selection of Italian sodas. After I took a look at the menu, I decided to get some calzones to-go that I could bake at home. You can eat inside, but if you'd rather take your food home, then you can choose to either have them make your food ready to eat and pack it up for you, or they can pack up your order and then you make it at home yourself. The guy who took my order was very confused about the menu, pricing and several other things. He seemed very nice, but definitely confused. When I told him I wanted to order a couple fresh, not yet baked calzones to-go, he said I couldn't do that and that I could only order pizza for take and bake. Huh?? The menu straight up says that you can take the calzones home and bake them yourself. He said he'd ask the lady making the calzones that day if she'd do it. She gladly said she would do it and even said ordering the calzones fresh, not baked or frozen, was her preferred way of having them so that you get the calzone baked fresh and right out of the oven instead of it already being baked and reheated or frozen. Not that those ways aren't good, it's just that they have different options here at Presto Calzone Bakery to try and fit what the customer wants. 

Garlic Parmesan Calzone ($6) - The calzones are made fresh from scratch right onsite. This one has a garlic Parmesan white sauce, mushrooms, spinach and provolone. Since this was a fresh calzone, it had to be baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. They sure didn't skimp on the fillings inside. I cut into the calzone and tons of yummy stuff came oozing out, so delicious looking. I wanted a side of red sauce for an additional $1 charge, but the confused guy who took my order said I wouldn't want it because the calzone I ordered has white sauce in it. Huh? I personally don't mind a bit of both sauces, but just decided to go without since I wanted to take his suggestion. While the calzone was extremely tasty, I was glad that hubby had a goof amount of ranch with the side he got for his calzone and he shared some with me. I'd order it again and would like to try some of the other calzones they have on their menu.

Orange Ricotta Mini Loaf ($2.25) - This was very good! It tasted so fresh, which makes sense because the guy who took my order said they bake all the bakery items from scratch. 

Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25) - This cookie had a fair amount of chocolate chips, but really lacked flavor. It was very soft and the size was nice, just not something I'd personally order again. 

Lemon Cake ($3) - Wow! This tasted great! The cake had just the right amount of lemon flavor and the lemon cream cheese frosting on the top was oh so good. I'd totally order this again. 

When the guy gave me the total, it seemed way off. I asked for a receipt and he said I couldn't have one because I paid in cash and not with a debit or credit card. I thought that was very strange, but just took my order and went home. Once home, I discovered that the chocolate chip cookies I ordered were missing and looking over what I had, there was no way my total was what this guy charged me. I called the store immediately and was impressed to find out they have an option to press for speaking directly to one of the owners. I ended up speaking with one of the owners, Shane. He was near Presto Calzone Bakery, so he said he'd stop by and sort things out. He was extremely bothered by the fact that they hadn't given me my full order, but also overcharged me the amount the amount they did. He offered to drive directly to my house and refund me, but I felt that was too kind and not necessary. He said he didn't want to hold my money, so he'd like to at least meet me half way to correct the issue. I could tell Shane genuinely cared about the situation and wanted to fix it the best way he could. When I met up with Shane a short time later, he was very courteous and explained that I was indeed overcharged and he had a receipt for me with the cash that was to be refunded back to me. He also had the missing chocolate chip cookies packaged for me that was missing from my order. Shane explained that he spoke with the guy who took my order and agreed that he was indeed confused and was truly sorry for the mix-up. I appreciate the effort made by Shane and apology.

3613533,2015-09-02,0,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"Came home from work and found a flyer attached to my front door for this place that freshly makes homemade calzones. Perfect timing! I was starving and didn't feel like cooking dinner and neither did hubby. So, after showing him the flyer, we headed over with our son. 

It's a cute, little place in a strip mall behind the 7-11 on Cimarron and Farm. Had about 3 bar stools at the counter and I think 4 or 5 small tables inside. There is a wall to the left that lists out the available pizzas (which you can take and bake at home), salads and calzones you can order. It wasn't too busy, only 2 customers ahead of us. All of their calzones are hand made and they use non-GMO unbleached Montana wheat, local wild flower honey, sea salt, and olive oil. MMMMM! They also source their fruits and vegetables when they can too which I think is wonderful.

I spotted that you can purchase 6 calzones for $35. Since they are regularly $7/calzone, we figured we'd go for it and save the rest of the calzones for lunch. We ordered 2 pepperoni, 1 ham and pineapple, 1 pesto garlic (veggie), and 2 all meat since they were already available to take home straight away. We would've ended up waiting for 30 minutes to have them fresh baked. The calzones are a pretty good size and the fillings inside generous too...and just the right amount of cheese, which for me is oozing! The fresh-made dough was great too! 

I had the pepperoni (for lunch today) and the ham and pineapple last night and really enjoyed them. Hubs had the pesto garlic. I don't know that he really enjoyed it as much though since it was a veggie calzone and he really wanted a combination one (which was no longer available on the board). So in the interest of time, he took the veggie one. My son also liked his all-meat calzone. We received marinara and ranch sauces with our calzones. The marinara sauce is fantastic.

For dessert, we ordered two monster-sized cookies (oatmeal and choc. chip, peanut butter) that looked delicious and they were!! Hubby and I ordered Italian sodas (raspberry and blackberry) which were also very good. They have about 30 flavors to choose from! 

Because we brought in the flyer, we also got a free popsicle that I think is homemade from fruit from the orchard. We chose the apricot. It looks so fresh and delicious, but I haven't tried it yet. Was too full!

They also had some tasty-looking pumpkin and chocolate cakes in a little stand to the right. Next time I will definitely give those a try and I will also call ahead to order the calzones! They can do custom ones too so if that's what you want and don't want to wait at the store, call ahead and place an order. 

The staff seemed friendly, maybe a tad shy and the person who took our order was pleasant. I think he might've been new since I showed him my Yelp check-in and asked if I can redeem the free dessert. He seemed a little unsure about whether I could or not, but went to check with the owner and all was fine. 

This is a cute, little bakery with tasty calzones and some delicious, diet-busting desserts. I would definitely come back. I hope this place does well! Be sure to get a stamp card from them too!",8dhny_lS11HkqAIXteYjig,1,0,4,PSZdfbEhN9T9p7AOdvjE8w

North West Las Vegas has a new unique family run Calzone bakery that is ready to impress.

Located along the cross streets of farm and Cimarron in the small strip mall behind the gas station 7/11.

After seeing elite yelpers Ty & Lore checking into this new establishment, my desire for calzones for dinner was too much. Being greeted by a trio of owners I had the sense of an already established mom & pop vibe.

After running through the menu of calzones I ended up with the Canadian Bacon with Pineapple and Italian sausage. All were extremely tasty, with the bread seeming fresh. This is hand made calzones, not your frozen late night dinner meals from the grocery store.

Also a great range of Italian soda's is also available.

When reviewing Presto they had only been open less than a week. But with a little help from the yelp crew I believe this is another quality addition to the area.

Overall
Food: 5-5
Drink: 4-5
Service: 5-5

4157859,2014-10-09,10,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"We were excited to find something new on our side of town that wasn't a chain or fast food. We happened upon it one night while visiting algobertos tacos. The place was unfinished but we found a note on the inside of the door of when it was scheduled to open. We went back the day it was supposed to open but no luck. I checked couple days later but still no luck. I had a funny feeling today and swung by after picking up the little one at school. AT LAST!  It was open! 

I ran in to grab a to-go menu but unfortunately they hadn't had any printed yet, so I grabbed a business card and said I'd bring the man of the house back later. 

Ty was delighted when we pulled up to Presto. (shhh don't tell him, it was a secret) He had been dying to try it. He originally thought it would be a build your own type but the Calzones are pre-made. You have the option to eat it there or take and bake. We grabbed two hot ones to eat there ( Italian sausage combo and the pepperoni combo) and she was also gracious enough to offer a take and bake since the flavor I wanted was sold out( the pepperoni and mozzarella) . I couldn't resist trying all three desserts -  spicy zucchini bread, pumpkin cake with cream cheese icing and Apple crumble. She plans on doing desserts based on the season which is A-OK with me. 

The pepperoni combo was delish. Ingredients include pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, onion, bell pepper and a bit of sauce. The Calzone bread was soft and just the right amount of bread to toppings ratio. All three desserts were to die for. Tasted just like my mom or grandma would have made them. I even had Ty get me two zucchini loafs to go. :0

She loves what she does and has many ideas for what she wants to do to keep it unique and delicious. I am looking forward to what the future has in store for Presto Calzone Bakery!",7S2wwOSVSRn4CEZdtQKG_Q,12,13,5,lz-U_9Uluu4MZvLlYPFEYA

However, today I was informed that they no longer do 'build your own' as an option. This is an absolute deal breaker for us. We're vegetarian, there is only one vegetarian option on the menu now and for me, it doesn't have a single thing appealing to it. There's officially nothing left for me to order! It's a damn shame. 

I've never had a calzone before today, I think it will be very difficult for any other restaurant to do it better than Prestos. The fresh ingredients are very noticeable, the atmosphere is cool, and the staff was superb. Brandon the cashier was extremely helpful and knowledgable with his explanations and truly made the experience better.

5012224,2017-04-06,0,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"This was a very interesting take on an old classic.  I wouldn't come to Presto for a traditional Italian calzone, I would come for an entirely reimagined version on one of my favorite foods. 

It's hard to explain exactly what makes this calzone do different.  The dough is very doughy, it's a much thicker type of crusty than I'm used to; but also it has a very different flavor.

While the crust is different, and very good, the sauce is really what made the meal for me.  In fact, the three calzones we ordered had maybe enough sauce to adequately flavor one.  They put maybe a drop of sauce in each one. We ended up getting extra sauces on the side and it totally changed the meal.  We had the marinara and the garlic(ky one.. can't remember the name).  Both sauces were incredible and the main reason I would come back. 

I would DEFINITELY go with an Italian soda, extra sauce on the calzone, and one of the giant fresh baked cookies, and you should love this place. 

Also... just NO on the Buffalo.  It's not hot, it's also not Buffalo.  Just don't do it.",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,1,0,4,LzgsxjHwkY2FRyGuqwB8Ng

I'm only buying calzones from Presto!",PS0efv5ppyUgJkoW3VQf4w,0,1,5,byQo3cW7SFQ7C1-UoTxUTQ

5240524,2016-08-09,0,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,This place is the bomb!! I'd almost drive from Michigan to eat here again. This is the first calzone I've had in years that didn't leave me wishing I had bought a pizza instead. Definitely try it out!!!,9YD1pRfZvpDZ2K9GSgObZg,0,1,5,MQgiOYV5LVfdOHjHNVKc_A
5278369,2015-01-03,5,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"I hate to be the Debbie Downer raining on this parade, but I don't understand the hype surrounding Presto's. The bakery itself is small and bare. There's only 3 tables and a few bar stools inside. I think they're striving to be more to-go based than be a dine-in restaurant (especially with the roll out of their take-home pizza menu). 

Presto's was freezing. The bubbly employee apologized and explained that the heater was broken. After ordering our food, two men stood next to our table discussing the heater problem and fire alarm implications. Kind of awkard. 

As mentioned before in another review, the menu is limited, although it is expanding. Calzones are $6. There's only 2 vegetarian options: 1) a plain 'ol cheese and marinara calzone; 2) the garlic and parmesan calzone, which is filled with mushrooms, spinach, cheese, and white sauce. I wasn't ecstatic with my options, but I went with option #2. I added a side of marinara for an extra buck. 

It took about 20 minutes to get our order. BTW we were the only ones there. As least we got to sip on the best Italian soda ever while we waited. Seriously, Presto's custom made Italian soda deserves a beverage award. The soda was the highlight of our visit. $2 is a bargain for a cup of Presto's magical  soda. And there's 30 flavors to choose from! I went with lime - I'd definitely recommend it.

But I digress. You can't visit a calzone bakery just for the soda. The calzones are small, but for $6, you have to assume they're going to be small. My garlic parmesan calzone was alright, not epic but not horrible either. My favorite part was the crust. To my dismay, there was just the slightest bit of onions in the calzone. There was no mention of onions on the menu, so I didn't expect there to be any in my calzone. Those little crunchy clear bastard onions are the bane of my existence!!

Still hungry, the Mister and I started working on the German chocolate cake we had ordered ($3). The coconut frosting on top lacked the ooey gooey factor and the cake was dry. I wish it was sweeter too. Ugh. We ate about half of it, and called it quits (and it wasn't because we were full!). 

Here's the short and simple version :
Atmosphere : 2
Italian soda : 5+
Customer service : 4
Garlic parmesan calzone : 3.5
German chocolate cake : 1

PRO TIP: They're on restaurant.com!

Worth a return visit? Probably not, at least for now. 
What would make me like Presto's better? A calzone more enticing to vegetarians. Like one with olives, bell peppers, mushrooms, lots of cheese, and marinara sauce.  Basically more veggies. Also, a more decorated and exciting layout would help. With color.

5308704,2017-01-02,0,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,"Everything was really yummy!  I had last minute visitors on New Years Eve and didn't have anything to prepare before they arrived. They had just dropped a menu by a few days before and I had been meaning to try them plus I saw they had a Groupon. I called at 4pm for pickup at 6pm. They were totally able to accomodate that. The menu offers a good variety of calzones but doesn't give descriptions so I asked for recommendations from the staff member taking my order.  She was so friendly and accomodating which is so refreshing after having dealt with the non caring attitudes experienced at so many other places. I ordered the steak, buffalo chicken, pesto chicken and a classic pepperoni.  I also ordered a green salad and a seasonal apple salad.  I arrived to pick my order at 6:15. Greeted by friendly face at counter, I believe she was also the young lady who I'd placed the order with two hours earlier.  I was the only customer there the entire visit, it was strange.  Super clean and bright interior with super cute butcher paper rolls hanging from the ceiling to the floor with the menu whimsically scrolled.  I presented my Groupon and paid it was more than I expected after Groupon deducted but Groupon description was kinda weird too soo...I didn't really know what it should have been.  I'm waiting for the order to get packed up for me I notice the giant house made cookies in giant jars on the counter.  I was just about to order all 4 kinds when a young man came out and said they were giving free cannollis for New Years.  So I ordered just 2 so as not overdue it.  Took about 5 minutes to get it all together.  They labeled the calzones and provided a variety of dipping sauces to try.  

Once I got them home I cut them into smaller finger food sized portions so the four of us could sample every kind.  The salads were made with really fresh romaine and leafy greens.  The seasonal salad had chicken on it, which I didn't order, but it was delicious with vinegrette that was recommended, pear or something.  The green salad had kalamata olives and veggies and was so good with the balsamic vinegrette. The chicken on the salad seemed like a precooked variety, not totally sure, it was tasty though.  All of the calzones were awesome as well as the dipping sauces which tasted like from scratch, I'm guessing they are.  The four of us couldn't finish it all but each made sure to same room for sweets.  Those complimentary cannollis, some of the best I've had, mini and so good.  The cookies, amazing.  So glad I finally tried Presto.  

Couple of suggestions for the owners.  Your menu could be improved by just including a bit more description for calzones.  I'm always comfortable asking servers for recommendations and descriptions and your staff did a great job but I could see other potential customers struggling with this. Also, when I ordered the salads I was asked what kind of dressing I wanted and for calzones what kind of dipping sauce.  They are not shown on your menu so again I had to ask for descriptions.  Just make it easy for people.  That seasonal salad was perfect with the dressing recommended but might not as been as spectacular with another.  Sell your food with the those items that highlight and elevate the flavors.  Don't give people too much freedom to change the product you envisioned. Substitute when requested like I did, pecans for walnuts, but otherwise sell what you know we will love!

Highly recommended!   I will be back!",dR2n7GaWW_9O_UaAmttWqQ,2,1,4,4Sqo8qbxggzYeOdm5troqA

The staff couldn't have been more friendly. Each of the three employees were so helpful and genuinely excited to tell us about their offerings. I was shown the chalk board of what calzones were hot and ready to go as opposed to the made to order ones that can take a 25-30 minute wait. I'll remember to order ahead if I have a specific one in mind next time. My daughter and I both ordered the garlic parm veggie calzone and it was amazing. The fresh mushrooms and spinach with artichoke hearts tasted like they were just picked from the garden. I did notice that Gilcrease orchard was mentioned on the homemade popsicle menu, so maybe the veggies came from there too. Oh and the peach cobbler dessert was spectacular. It made me miss the south, where fresh peach cobbler is a staple in the summertime. The peaches tasted fresh off the tree in this dessert. Oh and for every calzone you buy, you get a stamp on a stamp card that rewards you with a free calzone after purchasing 5. I'll be back to try the Italian sodas next time too. Right now I'm just happy to have a place like this close to home.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,2,5,1lxpuKUudj9_986Q07IL0A

The calzones - so fresh, so yummy. The dough is light, the cheese was gooey, & the fillings tasted really good! Wish I had more sauce for dunking, but next time we will ask for a couple more for sure! 
The cookies - we had a Brookie & a chocolate crinkle (I think). My hubby devoured the Brookie. It was soft and yum! We split the chocolate cookie and it was so good! Great flavor & super soft in the middle, but crispy on the edges. 
The cake - ohhhhh friends, if you do nothing else in life you just have to try the chocolate peanut butter cake. It is better warm. It's the most delicious cake I've ever had; so light, thr gnache was fluffy & thr peanuts gave it such great texture! I broke every diet rule eating this cake & I have no remorse or regrets! 
It's a bit far from us, but definitely worth the drive! You won't be disappointed. Some of the best calzones we've had anywhere!",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,1,1,5,-adn31LXx-Dj6RolK2T4OQ

All of the ingredients are fresh, organic, and gmo free, and the calzones were heaven. The stuff in the middle was perfect with amazing sauce; not too much or too little. The crust was so soft it melted in your mouth. My picky 2 year old ate nearly the whole calzone. I also ordered a peach Italian soda with cream. Unfortunately they were out of cream, but the Italian soda was great even without it. it was so similar in taste to a fresh peach that I thought of peach fuzz. As we were leaving the girl at the counter gave my two year old a sugar cookie which I didn't taste because he devoured it. Because I had the flyer, I got a free dessert, of which I chose the pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting.

We went for the calzones since that is their main thing/focus. WAY too much dough and minimal stuffing ingredients. We ordered 3 calzones and NONE of them had very much in the way of stuffing ingredients. The dough all around was super thick and the ends were an inch and a half of all dough. The flavor was average. 

I was informed that they have pre-measured amounts they are instructed to use for the stuffing. Too bad, we really had high hopes. The cookies were good...",1DH5gbePom-8RMndRnqQ6w,2,1,2,ScdWTkVUWAEWRUYGzvO1LQ

Presto! has a bakery feel to it and it shows in the dough for the calzones, being super soft but crisp enough to handle a red sauce dip; ensuring you leave no crust behind. They also house a few bakery delights such as cookies and seasonal pies if you're craving a little extra for dessert. 

Need to grab something to feed the family? Take and bake pizzas and custom calzones can be called in advance to get something delicious done quick. 

Italian sodas? Check. 30 flavors and you can mix and match, cream also available if you're into that.
