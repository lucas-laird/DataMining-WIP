We sat down at the bar and we were greeted by a wonderfully cantankerous bartender named Kevin. He served us up some wonderful drinks and witty banter. He really makes the place awesome.

We had some wonderful drinks and delicious pizza (white sauce, chicken, and mushrooms...I'm not kidding, you have to try it.yum). And it was VERY reasonably priced during their happy hour. I mean, it was downright cheap.

So why aren't I giving it five stars, you ask? Well, their karaoke wasn't working. And the bar wasn't as hopping as my friend says it usually is during karaoke nights, so we were disappointed. The karaoke lady was still there, attempting to work it out with her iPod and a few friends' phones, but when she said we could sing if we knew the words, she meant we could sing whatever songs she had on their phones. *Shrug*

This is the anti-Vegas. Californians, you've been warned.

I LIVE TO TELL MY ORDEAL:
Came here to celebrate a birthday and the place is clearly geared toward locals and is a divey watering hole. Everyone in the group except myself was a local so I was like, ""Oh HELL no, why here?"" I was in Vegas for business for 2 nights and this is one of the last places I'd go to while in the City of Sin. We had a pretty swell time and the place was dead when we walked in around 9 pm. 

I was unaware that PT's is a chain of bars. It has your typical bar amenities: lounging areas, pool tables, and ESPN blaring throughout the place. Nothing over-the-top and the only remnant of Vegas is the gambling screens surrounding the bar area.

Their beers and other poisons are great as well as their appetizers; I had a bowl of cheese fries, which were very crispy and very cheesy, just the way I like 'em :-) They even have great steaks and sliders to cheer you up 'cause you'd rather be on the strip (I was suffocating and we didn't leave until 4 am, Jesus Christ).

Our server was an ANGEL! Wish I remembered her name. Prompt and friendly service, complete with a genuine smile (it was in her eyes too).

I'm sure locals sick of the strip would dig this place (my group did).
Food, beer, and service was great!! Atmosphere was boring as fuck, unless you really love pool, which was the only thing keeping patrons entertained.

It had been someone's birthday and the Decatur & Hacienda PT's was the de facto meet up place for after-shift celebrations. But everyone else had long gone home and we were in there talking at the bar, the last ones to leave, as the sun started to rise outside. 

At some point the jukebox starting playing ""The Lumberjack"" by Jackyl and I started making fun of it because, let's be honest, any song that has a chainsaw solo is required to be mocked. 

Well, this must have been one of the bartender's favorite songs or maybe his cousin was in the band or something because he came over to us, looked at me like I just insulted his mother and said ""So what do you listen to, Yanni or some bullshit?""

The question put me off balance. I wasn't expecting such a passionate defense of ""The Lumberjack"" from our bartender (or from anybody else on the planet for that matter) and I was dumbfounded at the egregious fallacy of logic by which he implied that, because I don't like my music to feature power tools, l must be some kind of New Age candy-ass.

Apart from that, it's a PT's. If you've been to one before you know what to expect. Probably got more amenities than most. They got plenty of room and a lot of pool tables and a dartboard and a Golden Tee I think.

Eh, compromise, we'd all go out for drinks and do bowling another time. I went here with 3 of my coworkers, Tasia, Antonio & Tony and Tasia's bf Cody and his friend, James, this morning (midnight ish) 4/13/11.

Thanks to Industrial Road being closed, we had to go a roundabout way and I was about ready to just go home when my coworker, Antonio, who I was following, finally found the place. My coworker Tasia was already there and apparently knows the manager. The bartender knew her by name. I guess it's just that sort of place.

After midnight, drinks and pizza are half off. Between my two Guinesses at the CMYE the day before and my pina colada that morning, I thought I should slow down and order my staple - water. We ordered a half pepperoni half cheese pizza. It was $7 something thanks to the after midnight special. There's not a chance in hell that it's worth $14. It's a super thin crust thin pizza that 6 of us split. It was decent but nothing mind blowing.

I wanted to try the lasagna, but I needed less carbs so I ordered the chopped cobb salad for $8.99 with blue cheese dressing. It was okay - not the best, but it was definitely edible. At some points, the dressing sort of tasted like bleach, which is not a  good sign.

Cody ordered himself a bucket of mild hot wings and fries. He and Antonio were dying over how spicy they were... James and I agreed that they smelled faintly of Tobasco. Crybabies.

One cool feature of PT's is that you can buy juke box credits and order the next song directly from your smartphone. Cody was basically in charge of the playlist the entire time we were there. 

Another thing this place needs is seating for large groups. The tables only seat 4, and are attached to the wall. We had to pull up two barstools and cram around the table to fit all 6 of us, to share the pizza.
