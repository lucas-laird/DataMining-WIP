63695,2014-01-02,0,QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw,"I ordered delivery for my order. I ordered Chicken Satay, Drunken Noodle w/chicken, Fried Tofu w/mushrooms, and the Crispy Duck Dinner. 

The food smelled amazing when it was delivered, and this was my first time trying Thai BBQ. Sadly, it was a mixed bag when it came too living up to the smell. 

If by Crispy Duck they mean over cooked, with the only flavor being one of stale or mishandled meat. I could not eat the duck at all. 

Chicken Satay is usually one of my favorite Thai dishes, but this chicken somehow managed to be both tough and undercooked. Not sure how they managed that. 

The saving graces for Thai BBQ were the Drunken Noodle w/chicken, which was delicious and flavorful, as was the Fried Tofu w/mushrooms. 

If I ever order from Thai BBQ again, I think I'll stick to the BBQ chicken everyone raves about, and the dishes I just mentioned. No more expensive experimentation for me.",LkTOA0rFhRo483qPFOmGBw,1,0,2,8glN9hHncvFkDTsSqSE2Bw

I'm not going to blame the business for anything I just need to know because I've never been allergic to anything.

On one of our trip to Vegas last year, we decided to give it a try and see if he's coworker's review lives up to our expectation. 

Our first impression was ok, there are ppl inside, mostly Filipino nurses. We both ordered Thai Tea, which tasted the same from other Thai restaurants we've been too. Except for the Thai Tea we had @ Thailand. 

Michael, ordered their special house chicken over rice and like always, I ordered pad thai. 

Our orders came and they looked good, which was a good sign to us. First bit, we were fans and can't wait to come back for more. 
Bf's chicken was flavorful and moist. He didn't even need to use the sauce that came with his rice plate. 
As for my pad thai, it was good also and it wasn't dry nor sweet. It was the right amount of flavor. 

Before we left to come back home, we made sure to return here again and enjoy the flavor of their good food. 

I can't wait to go back to Vegas and return here.",_gXpxST-xxFPx408bmZmzQ,3,1,4,Z_3q64-wvtmYtz6feOpsfA

839111,2011-08-05,0,QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw,"I have been going to this place since I moved to Vegas five years ago. However, I have been a eating of Thai Original BBQ since before I could eat solid food on my own. 

I absolutely love this place! They have several locations in California as well as this location and each place is consistent in their preparation of the food. The atmosphere is very calm and soothing. It is not ever too busy, the service is great, and it is great for group outings. When you decided to stop by this place, make sure you grab some of my favorite and most delicious items on the menu. 

First, I would recommend the Tom Yum Goong (Spicy Shrimp Soup). It is a warm, citrus based, and soothing serving of soup. It does not have any cream, it's more of a shrimp broth, so it's not as heavy as their coconut milk based soups. 

For the main dishes, I would choose S1 BBQ Chicken or S8 Chicken or Beef Satay (chicken or beef shish kabobs). The BBQ chicken is moist with a lightly crisped skin coated in a sweet honey sauce served with their shrimp fried rice. I believe the rice is cooked with cocunut milk instead of water and adds a creamy, slightly sweet flavor to it. The S8 is your choice of chicken or beek sticks. I personally get the beef sticks. They are a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They also have a slightly sweet taste , possibly marinated in coconut milk, and this dish is also served with their delicious fried rice. This dish comes with a pint size cucumber salad and an amazing peanut sauce.

As far as drinks go, I would stick with their Thai Tea. Thai Tea here is sweet and creamy. If you have never tried it, I would definitely recommend theirs. It tastes like an iced tea latte.",-r5AZLrUomVkcM6i3eO2HQ,0,0,5,ozlqp8e7-lNka58EqJzBaw

Service was good, everyone was polite. Ordering and receiving our food/drinks was timely, and our drinks were kept full. We were checked on regularly and empty plates were cleared. 

It was president's day (a holiday), so we're unable to order from their regular lunch specialty and had to order from their regular menu. 

So, I was hesitant to come here after reading several Yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered their BBQ chicken which came with some (red) fried rice. The chicken was very tender and came off the bone easily. The sweet dipping sauce it came with was a nice compliment. I didn't really taste any specific flavor from the fried rice (it was probably overpowered by everything else), but it wasn't oily or greasy at all. Some other things I tried... BBQ spareribs- also tender with a good amount of meat and nicely flavored. Phad Thai- yumMy! Subtle sweet peanut flavor with nice chewy texture. Panang curry- cuts of boneless chicken and potato in a curry soup/sauce. Good flavor and the chicken was tender.

We opted for delivery since we were staying on the strip and didn't have a car. After we placed our order we were called minutes later that they ran out of wings of angel so we got calamari instead. 5 minutes later we were called again and were told that they ran out of crispy duck and we were mad that even on a weekday night they ran out of the items we wanted. When the food came, it was so average Thai food. The Phad Thai was so bland, it needed lime. We also specifically asked to substitute the shrimp for chicken and we still got shrimp. We had leftovers but we're not compelled it to it again for leftovers. I'd only recommend this place if you really wanted delivered Thai food.",GCLl6W2v0FGsbG8fEpvXQg,0,0,3,hPLT5mp1VgNkniNSMFqt3w

We ordered appetizers:  

Stuffed Chicken wings (stuffed with a sort of pork/seafood meatball)...not my fav...too much protein in one bite for me  

Chicken Satay - typical and many pieces..but just okay in flavor

Clear Noodle Salad - was good...I would have liked it spicier and with more peanuts, but I helped to finish it off.

Pork/Shrimp Egg Rolls - these were standard and again just okay.  I would order them again though, as they did the job an egg roll needs to do for me. (some meat, noodles, and cabbage...with decent dipping sauce)

I also ordered a Thai Tea and it was the best part of the meal...was high end of yummy to me...AND...the waiter brought a free refill without even asking me...I was pleasantly surprised I didn't have to pay for 2.

Our waiter was nice...although he failed to bring us the fried shrimp we ordered...but he didn't charge us either, so it was no stress and we had enough food as it was so did not bother to alert him to this fact.

At Thai Original BBQ I'm a big fan of their lunch specials. You get a great little side salad, then your main course for less than $9, not a bad deal.

So my staple item at this location is good ol' #1, the BBQ Chicken with Fried Rice. 90% of the time the chicken is moist, the skin has great flavor, and it's cooked to perfection. Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side. Periodically I'll go off the deep end and get the Pad Thai, which is decent, but I'm quickly reminded that nothing beats the BBQ chicken.

Thai Original BBQ

We walk in and the restaurant is empty minus one patron in the corner. We smile at each other. I scope out her plate and to not seem like an obvious food whore my eyes slowly move up the wall above her head to the vent. All I could think of was The Ring when the black stuff starts growing on the wall and than it's a girl's hair and it's really scary.... Judge for yourself. 

We will call this Exhibit A or Black Wall Fuzz

This vent was right above the lady eating...Ewww. The picture doesn't begin to describe the amount of blackness there was. It was on a third of the wall Then the drinks came. I have water and my boss goes with Diet Coke....or so we thought. 

Exhibit B- Hell No It's Not Diet

What is that white residue? Did I mention my boss almost spit this Not Diet Coke in my face? She was scared to try another beverage after that first sip. Smart girl. 

On to the food. My boss ordered a beautiful Teriyaki Chicken plate complete with broccoli and a giant's fist of white rice. Delicious. I ordered the Panang Beef no giant's fist of anything. What I received was questionable to say the least. It was Panang FAT and resembled anything, but beef. Seriously.

Here's the best part. It was a Wednesday and all I kept thinking was the Health Department should shut this place down. As we are leaving I start looking for the Rating that by law is suppose to be posted in an obvious spot. WRONG. It was conspicuously hidden behind the tinted glass at the very bottom left of the door!

Way way back in the day, this place was my first ever Thai restaurant experience and the gateway to my Thai cuisine craving taste buds. Although the location leaves much to be desired, the food has remained pretty solid overall. I still believe they have one of the best yellow curries -- creamier consistency plus they serve it with ACTUAL chicken portions (not the rubbery pieces some places use). In their pad see ewe the chicken is smoked, which gives it a slight bbq taste, different than most. Food is served hot and promptly. Pricing is average. Service depends on waiter/waitress. We've never had the auto gratuity attached to our bill. 

My only gripe is that through the years, this restaurant has never really attempted to renovate much. The bathrooms are a prime example. Every time I use the ladies room, I feel like I'm in a scary movie. It's dark and dingy, sometimes dirty. It's concerning to think that both customers and the employees use the same facilities.

I come here because it's never packed the food is good, they used to do free refills on thai iced tea, but now it's a 1 refill limit. The fried tofu is cubed perfectly bite sized and thoroughly fried, the sauce very good. The calamari sauce seems like it's just honey, but the strips are large and not chewy for something that large. I would like the tofu sauce and usually get a 2nd. 

S-8 half/half and the pad se eew. The rice is fluffy and consistent, not sticky or clumping. Nice bright flavor, not over infused like Spanish rice or red rice. The cucumber, pepper slaw could be much larger, but the shrimp are percetly done and the trick to the S8 is to de-skewer before eating. The peanut sauce could be thicker, but next time I'll ask for a fried egg. I love egg yolk in my rice, heck if they could I'd get a poached egg on there. Pad Se Eew chicken is more flavorful as a dish than with the beef. The beef is overpowering. I have tried a few other things on the menu, but when your party of 9 orders 9 S8's your doing something right.",864nL0po2ldN8TPgbSiwOQ,1,1,4,RUqAyZpmlsaylQazNyq1NA

Appetizers/Curry
Rice dishes

Their name sake, Thai BBQ chicken, is delicious. I've been eating it since I was younger. It is a half chicken served with shrimp fried rice and sweet chili sauce.

-Fresh Summer Rolls: I prefer to get it with no mint and even then, it's still so refreshing! The dipping sauce is great and you get a good amount of shrimp and meat. 
-Thai BBQ Spare Ribs: fall off the bone great
-Shrimp Fried Rice: can literally eat this on its own! Very sweet and moist 
-Pad Thai: hits the spot with great consistency with the texture of the noodles and the its flavor

The portions are all HUGE. Personally I would think that it's more family style versus for one person to eat so it's perfect for sharing. What I like most about all the dishes is that they're all simple but so flavorful!

4259837,2012-01-16,0,QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw,"This place reminded me of why I miss having thai food (my husband just loves chinese food so much, but I really didn't want that this time). The 1st house special on the menu- BBQ chicken plate, served with sweet sauce came with shrimp fried rice for $8.99- is a steal. This is what the both of us ordered. I've been coming to these restaurants for years (my favorite one was the one on Flamingo/Jones). So, when we were unsure of what to have on saturday night for dinner, I suggested this place (it'd been quite some time since our last visit). Yeah, we were supposed to go to the Vegas Streats festival, but my husband doesn't like large crowds with limited parking, so we had to switch gears (will just have to catch the slider truck some other time). Also, there are quite a few Thai restaurants in the area (Commercial Center) but the prices are a tad higher there.  

This restaurant is pretty close to our home, in the Smith's shopping center, on the opposite corner facing Maryland Parkway. The place was pretty empty; there was another party there besides us. The server was a little preoccupied in deep conversation with another patron (had to be a regular). The cashier brought us our menus. We were waiting for a few minutes, and my husband was starting to get annoyed with lack of service. The football games were on tv. I noticed that all three cooks sat down and took a break. Another party entered the restaurant. I liked the two large aquariums giving the diners some privacy and some separation (adding ambiance), in the restaurant. Seating was mostly tables and chairs, and some booths along the wall. 

Back to the food; dinner came pretty fast. The amount of food for $8.95 was pretty impressive (didn't finish my rice, the two shrimp were pretty big, not the small salad shrimp size, and the BBQ chicken was tasty, especially with the sweet sauce). My husband dug in, using his fingers, but I didn't want to get messy, so I used my fork and knife. It was really good, but I thought that some of my chicken was at the point of just being overdone. My husband really enjoyed his meal, so I didn't tell him about some of my chicken, because I didn't want to ruin it for him. I should mention that the service got better as we were eating- we were checked on several times and the server came around to refill drinks. 

So, why the 4 stars? Well, I've always been a fan for years now, so I am basing it on all my collective experiences as well, plus the house special is just a really excellent value overall. I'm sure we will be visiting again soon.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,PmeUq75IEj-71tUeU9M8PQ

Food: 3/5 To be honest their Thai food is okay for a chain restaurant. You don't find that too often. Usually when restaurants become chains they loose quality. This place has awesome fried rice, when you order a dinner entree of Satay beef it comes with a side of fried rice, appetizer cucumbers in rice vinegar, and peanut sauce. Super delicious rice, the satay is a little on the sweet side for me and sometimes a little over cooked. Guess it depends who's working but the fried rice is always on point. My recent go I order the ""kha tew"" which is like the Authentic Ramen or Pho of Thai people. Super delicious Not sure if they knew what I was attempting to order because the waitress (that was also Thai) had no idea what I was order nor describing even though I said it in Thai and she understood me perfectly. Well somehow they threw something together and it tasted decent, I would've loved more meat balls but hey couldn't complain. My table also order the lab pork, which is like spicy grounded pork with lettuce wraps. Honestly these were delicious. I was very surprised how close it came to my own mothers. 

Price: 4/5 3 entree's, 1 appetizer, 2 beers, and 2 wines. Not sure what the bill was but each entree was about $8.95 and you got a good amount too. So I would say the value was there. But from a past frequent diner there prices have gone up, and the quality of food has come down. 

Atmosphere: 2/5 People who love to come here, trust me don't come for the atmosphere. This place needs some serious updating. Once you walk in you feel like your in an old Chinese restaurant. With cracked leather booths, and a fish tank. This place doesn't even look like a Thai restaurant.",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,3,1,3,SCw_Vu4Q7lukUIOQ9BcFsA

1.) Thom Yum Kai- Hot and Sour Lemongrass soup with chicken, cilantro and other Thai spices. This soup can clear my sinuses and helps me feel better when I am feeling sick.

2.) Beef Salad- A colorful, tangy salad that brings out the best in Thai cuisine and spices. Along with tender thinly sliced pieces of beef, this dish is a must have!

3.) Chicken Padt Thai- Made with soaked dried rice noodles, stir-fried with eggs and chopped chicken, and flavored with tamarind pulp, fish sauce, garlic or shallots, red chili pepper and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges and often chopped roast peanuts.

Mango with Sticky rice. No words can describe how amazing the combination of sweet sticky rice and mango is. You have to experience the amazingness yourself and order it!

...and he's right. The food is incredible. The summer rolls are huge, and really yummy. I could have ordered those alone and been full.

I got the drunken noodles, spice level 6 with pork. Seasoning was perfect. Serving plentiful. Only complaint is the overabundance of bell peppers, but that's a personal preference. I hate peppers cooked with anything because they take over the flavor. Don't understand why chefs insist on putting them in otherwise amazing dishes, ""Oh, this tastes great! I think I'll add an overwhelming flavor to completely mask that."" I picked them all out and enjoyed the broccoli, noodles, and tender pork.

Had a bite of hubby's teriyaki beef. Excellent. They weren't as generous with his portion as they were with mine, or I would have stolen more. His was a lunch special, I guess mine was a full entree.

Super good & I can't say enough good things about them. Also! They have great condiments at no additional cost. Love love love them",c1kDy8FRVleg7VOO1AbZMw,1,0,5,-V51U5W2CDIH1pOHo5fbCg
5738286,2018-06-23,0,QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw,Love the summer rolls with peanut sauce and pad Thai with tofu.  We brought the food to a friend's house for potluck and everyone was asking where the food came from. We have only done take out so far but seems like a very nice place to one with the family.,0gbCkW3gMrZut2Zm5WTi6Q,0,0,5,locU4EHCZSmwOShkGQ-rBQ

I can, however, only review the dishes I have tasted.  Before I do, I just want to say that their service is very good.  They are attentive and friendly.  I think they are really striving to improve their rating.

As for the food, we had the following at least once, most twice:

Pad Thai: very tasty and good consistency of flavor and noodles
Pad Kee Mao: love the taste of the basil and mint leaves (5/10 spiciness is just right)
Pad See Ew:  With shrimp makes it so much better.  It has american broccoli, which is different from what I have had before, but it makes it delicious and adds to the texture.
Chicken Noodles:  Light in color with a hint of sweetness.  so good!
Shrimp dish (S-3):  Very generous with nice sized shrimps.  The sauce is awesome.
BBQ Chicken:  No need to dip it in honey.  The chicken is tender and very tasty.  The fried rice is simple and a great compliment to the strong flavor of the chicken.
Green Curry w/ Beef:  I love their curries!  Green curry is lighter on flavor compared to red and panang curry.  This dish specifically has bamboo shoots which makes it so much better. 
Panang w/ Beef:  A stronger flavored curry because, like all panangs, it has peanut sauce.  The flavor is very strong but delicious.  You might have to order extra rice to compensate for the strong flavor.  It may be a bit oily for many.  It has big chunks of beef which is great but a little tough to chew.

All in all, I'm a fan of this restaurant and will continue to eat here every time we're in Vegas.  It is a great way to take a break from the ocean of buffets.",V7GuMxOo_RF39_MRKYoL5Q,1,0,4,AE4i4L-p14Ebm0rUC3TkIw
