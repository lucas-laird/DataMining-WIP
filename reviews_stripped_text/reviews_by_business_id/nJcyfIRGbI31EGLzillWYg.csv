We were hungry. So, we went to there for lunch. Friend and I ordered 2 burgers. One was with fried egg sunny side up, and the other was plain. Both were ordered medium. We had to wait 5 minutes until a server can get our drink order. Another long wait for 2 waters and sodas. And, another long wait until she can get our food order. After a long wait for our food, we thought it might be tasty. Mine was ok. But, the other burger was crap. The egg was not sunny side up, it was fried. The burger meat was rare and cold. When we notified our server after another long wait, the server argued with us that is how medium is done at their place. After this argument, they gave us replacement burger, the patty was at medium. But, the egg was not sunny side up again. How can they screw up an egg order, I don't know. The price is not worth the crap service and crap food. Avoid this place. Better bet is MCD in circus circus.",4Rna3C50a5NlWml13bb_FA,0,0,1,Bf1stfYOgbVYTssiw-SOOQ

142077,2015-09-04,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"The only thing good about this place is the sweet 80's decor! So here goes my rant! I am a server and I hate to say it, but I expect decent service! I'm not asking anyone to bend over backwards or anything, but the least you could do is ask me how my food is! When I first got there my son and I waited about 5 minutes, there was no host in sight and I didn't see a sign, so I assumed it was maybe seat yourself! After 3 people passed us and after about 10minutes, I finally stopped someone and asked if there was a host and they said yes! So I apologized for seating myself and they got me a menu! When I asked what beers they had on tap the guy had no idea and had to look! So I asked what beer the mad dog was! I was told its a black ipa and then a black lager! When it came, it was just a plain lager and it wasn't very good (I am kinda a beer snob tho, I'm from Oregon)! Lol! That not there fault, but the fact he didn't know what he was talking about at all was kinda a bad sign! At the same time I ordered my beer, I also ordered my sons grilled chz! I got my beer and waited over 5 minutes before they came back to take my order! After putting in my order, we waited about 20 more minutes for our food! This restaurant was not busy at all, maybe 1/4 full! After a good 20 minutes, finally my sons (who is super hungry) grilled chz came out! Really over 20 minutes for grilled chz! The plate was way to hot for a small child, but the chz on the inside was cold! That can only mean one thing....,it sat in the window the whole time! Keep in mind I ordered it early so I could feed my child before my food came! Then just a couple minutes later here comes my burger! The burger was ok, not worth what I paid for and the grilled chz was ok, 2 thick pieces of bread with maybe 2 thin slices of cheese! As we were sitting there waiting for our food, I was digging all the 80s music and the videos they had to go along with it! Then all of a sudden the music switched to this remixed new aged 80s crap, but the videos stayed the same! So the music didn't line up with the videos anymore! I was pissed at that point and ready to leave! We went there for the love of the 80s, not new aged mixed 80s crap!!! So we ate our food and no one asked us how it was, as I finished my burger I saw our server eating! I guess I hope his food was good! I guess I should have served him and asked! I had to ask the bartender for a box and a different server for the check! We never saw our original server again! It really sucked! I strongly don't recommend eating here!

208105,2016-03-31,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"Used a Groupon steak dinner for two with a bottle of wine. We ordered the rockin' nachos for an appetizer and were pleased with the portion size and the taste. Almost a meal in itself. The steak (NY strip) was decent, nothing like you'd expect at a steak house but better than average. The plate came with steak fries and sauteed zucchini as sides. Delish. The wine was a bottle of Tisdale that you can find locally for $3.99. We had the cremé brulee for dessert. It was nothing special as it was served warm with a center that was still cold and solid like custard, which let us know that these desserts are kept in the fridge and microwaved when ordered. Overall we thought the food and the wine were a good value even for the regular price. The food and service is the reason for 3 stars. Otherwise it would be less because of how our Vince Neil expectations devolved.

Being a big Crüe fan, I was glad to see 80's hair band rock videos being played when we walked in at 3:15pm. With Skid Row's 18 and life on the screen I knew I was in the right joint. Rock memorabilia on the walls added to the flavor and decor. However our rock experience took a huge detour at 4pm. That's when country music hit the big screen. We thought maybe it was just part of the random music selection, but after the 3rd video in a row from the same group we asked the waiter what happened to the rock videos. He proceeded to tell us that the videos were being played by the manager because that's the music SHE likes. We said YIKES!  We asked him to ask her to change it and he said he would tell her, but what followed was 3 more videos of the same band (a total of 6 in a row) and a continuing onslaught of country crap until we left just before 5pm!! We couldn't get out of there fast enough. Our ears were bleeding with songs about dogs and trucks and broken heart twang. There's plenty of country bar and grills in this town, Vince Neil's Tatuado doesn't need to be one of them. Go for the food but leave before 4pm, at least on Wednesdays. Don't think we'll be back.

219826,2017-06-29,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"We stopped by for a quick hand of blackjack and a drink-or-two. Tatuado has two casino adjacent bars, neither of which was filled with customers, notwithstanding a moderately-sized gaming customer crowd (on a Wednesday!)

We stopped by the u-shaped bar and ordered a near beer and a vodka cranberry.  I'm pretty certain that the near beer had more alcohol than the vodka cranberry.  The waitress looked bored to death and barely could muster the energy or enthusiasm to take our order or serve our drinks. After plunking down our drinks and refusing to engage us in any conversation beyond taking the order, the waitress wandered away to her cash register.

We decided to have a second drink (hopefully with some actual booze!) at the second bar just off the mid-stakes table games section. The bar tender was a muscle-bound meathead who was in deep conversation with some multi-color-haired skank, and we assumed that he'd break off trying to make time with the skank to pour us a few.  Nope.

We waited for about a minute-or-so, but the bar tender didn't break conversation with the skank, so we walked away. You'd think that someone working for tips would keep at least 1 eye on his bar, but this fellow had his back to us the entire time we were seated waiting for a little Las Vegas hospitality.  He wasn't even behind his counter, so it's no wonder he had no idea we were there.

While the $11 steak and potatoes breakfast seems like a great deal, I don't think I'll ever get around to taking advantage of that bargain. Who knows if the waitstaff would notice if I was there?

For the wine we chose a Riesling that was great as well...chilled nicely in an ice bucket (we didn't want any wine that was not chilled because of the heat). Overall I have to say that the service alone is very hard to beat and the food followed through. Will return on my next trip!,rvK6bfOgiorjPGYkFK7MUg,0,0,5,koTMF86yR3E1yRp7SFm5zw

Since we got it for 4 people - they came up to a total one entree per person and 2 cheese cakes and 2 bottles of wine for the table. The steak wasn't bad, but wasn't great. I asked for rare and I got what looked like medium. Whereas my friends who asked for medium looked like they got rare. The fries and veggies are average tasting. The portion sizes are kind of small. The cheesecake was huge and tasted pretty good though! The wine you could choose between red or white - and was just a cheap bottle (probably around $10-$15). Overall, it was a pretty average meal. 

Price: The Groupon was I think around $70 and I got it with a Groupon deal of $5 off food / drink deals, so in the end, it totaled to about $11-12 per person - which you will never find such a cheap steak deal. Ever. For the price, we got the steak, dessert, and wine. So although the food was subpar, the deal was really quite great.

Service: Service was mediocre - nothing special or exceptional. Everyone was relatively friendly. They didn't really waste time talking to us or explaining the menu. When we sat down and told them we had the groupon, they basically just asked how we wanted our steak and what kind of wine we wanted and that was it. The server even brought our meal to the wrong table and then brought it to ours afterwards...

When we first walked in we were takin in right away but then put at a booth that was absolutely not ready for new guest with left over BBQ sauce and other leftovers on the table. After we sat down it took forever for our server to greet us and then for us to tell the server to clean the table. As we were greeted which was not even a greet more like a what do you want. We told the server which was Brian we have a groupon and without anything else said he asked for the groupon number and left. We did not get asked for drinks nor if we would have liked anything else for tonight seriously it was absolutely the worst customer service experience. On top of that we were switched out with a new server without even knowing with a server named JP. Granted the groupon was worth the price but not worth the time to come down to circus circus to be mistreated with horrible customer service at Vince Neil Tatuado.

Located in the Circus Jerkus casino which I would normally avoid but here we were. We Lyfted it over around 8pm or so and the place was pretty hopping. A number of families with little kids were seated near us so I guess you can so it's ok for families. Motley Crue gold records and guitars on the wall so it's like a Hard Rock Cafe centered around Motley Crue. A couple of the items are named after Motley Crue songs - Mac & Cheese Feelgoods Delight and Wild Side BBQ Bacon. I had the Wild Side BBQ Bacon. It was alright. I was starving. They had Lagunitas on draft of which I partook but their beer selection was rather limited. The karaoke host that night was very animated - not sure if I ever saw a host so full of energy. He would put on wigs and rock out with a blow-up guitar standing along the singer whenever they were singing a rock and roll type song. Either that or he would do a dance. Also he would give away prizes and keep the audience engaged with various tricks and audience participation games. The karaoke is done on a big stage and there is a little screen right in the middle where the lyrics get displayed. The microphone is even on a big microphone stand if you ever wanted to play rock star and channel your inner Steven Tyler or Vince Neil and do microphone stand tricks. Food was ok. Karaoke show was a bigger plus in my book. Disappointed that more menu items weren't named after Motley Crue songs. Here's a few suggestions: ""Droppin' Like"" Fries, Shout at the Devil Quesadilla, Smoke the Sky Salmon, Kickstart My Hearty Chili, Grilled, Grilled, Grilled Steak, Hammered Shrimp, Live Wire Burger, Knock 'Em Dead, Dip, Sticky Sweet Creme Brulee. Ok. I'll stop before someone gets violent. Extra point for karaoke good times otherwise the food and our kinda rude waiter would rate just a three.

I had ordered a medium well steak but I got a fairly rare steak. my boyfriend had ordered a medium rare steak and his steak came out to be well done, it was really tough and dry. The burger my brother in law had ordered was not what was described in the menu. Honestly you could get a better burger else where, like In-N-Out. the food is SO NOT worth the price. In my opinion, I feel like the quality and taste of the food is less than mediocre. Not to mention I have asthma and the smoke from the cigarettes that people smoke in the casino is so overwhelming and you can still smell it strongly in the restaurant.

We ordered our food - and 20 minutes later another waitress brought our food. Mind you, we still hadn't gotten any drinks we ordered. I can understand that picking up 1 water and 1 soda can be quite difficult - so someone else had to bring our drinks. The steak I ordered was disgusting- tough and full of fat. I tried to get our waitress but she was very rude. Finally I asked for the manager, who came about 10 minutes later. We talked to him about the food and the service. He apologized and said he would try to fix it. So he brought our check and said he was going to take off a whole 6.99!!! Woo hoo! Are you kidding?!?! I told him I thought he should comp my whole dinner, not the price of something I didn't order, but he wouldn't do it.

It taste like thick sweet cinnamon toast crunch milk. I never thought to batter anything with it. This is what made me order this late night breakfast style dish for morning breakfast. So first the chili was great very hearty and not too beanee the bell peppers gave it a Mexican flavor like that Pato sauce my mom uses. In a way it taste like what my dad calls a revuelto (a mix of what ever cans he finds of vegetables and ground beef.) all that was missing was the old green beans to make it take like my dad experiments.

I've kept hoping this place would make improvements to the menu, not so much as of yet. 

As a former GM in the industry customer experience should be paramount for repeat business. 

There is a entire population of potential customers not being served because there is no accommodation for people with dietary needs such as sugar, or salt restrictions. The food is generally over salted on nearly every item due to marinades, but the excess occurs in the kitchen. Taste the food prior to service!!!!

I have no idea how involved ownership is, but much more is necessary. 

My last order was ridiculously over salted, and fortunately the Manager on duty today made things right.

He was nice. He did mention we had to wait for our bar drinks for ""when the bartender gets back""... he seemed almost confused as to where the bartender went. But overall, we didn't wait too long for our drinks. 

Our actual waitress, she basically talked to us in passing without stopping, never even got her name and it took her forever to run our payment and bring back our card. No smile, no thank you, no nothing from her. She either seemed like she was overworked with too many tables or was perhaps new to her job? Overwhelmed I guess. 

As we were walking out, walked right past a woman at the hostess station, she completely ignored us. A ""have a good night"" or ""thank you"" would have been a much better way to treat your customers with customer service.

Went in and asked the person seating is if we could sit away from the stage because it was so loud and he said it's going to be just as loud there. Then proceeded to sit us a few tables back from the stage. Then he came back, tossed the menu on the table and walked away.
After waiting twenty minutes without being acknowledged - no water, no one bothering to take an order, I got up and left.

Their water tasted like I was drinking sand. Super gritty and just disgusting. I had to order a bottle of water!! Which is listed for $2.50 on their menu but we were charged $3.50, we saw on the bill.

Our waitress, Elizabeth, gave us our menus and got us our waters. Then she disappeared for awhile and a different waitress, w/ black hair pulled into a tight ponytail, came and took our orders and told us she'd be helping Elizabeth with our table. 

We ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip for our appetizer. It took awhile to come out and wasn't that awesome. It had way huge artichoke hearts and barely any to dip!

I ordered the Wild Side BBQ bacon burger and my boyfriend ordered the Ulcerator burger. It came out like right, right after our appetizer. Annoying.

I asked for my Wild Side BBQ bacon burger with no cheese. And it came out with absolutely nothing on it???  Just a plain burger... not even BBQ sauce or bacon... just plain!! The food runner just dropped our food off and walked away so I didn't even have time to tell him that it was wrong. We waited around looking for at least one of our waitresses and we couldn't find her. A nice lady sitting at a table next to us asked me what was wrong and I told her and she even tried to help us flag down a waitress. Finally, a hostess or something went to get Elizabeth. I told Elizabeth that it wasn't what I had ordered. I told her I wanted the Wild Side BBQ burger w/ everything else just no cheese! She took my burger, that had just been sitting on my table, untouched, as I waited around for someone I could inform about the mistake. 

She came back out in literally 2 seconds with some old and stale bacon, a mess of old onion strings, cold BBQ sauce, and said ""for some reason they thought you wanted nothing on the burger"" ... now why in the world would I order the Wild Side BBQ burger if I wanted nothing on it??? 

I took a few bites, I already knew I hated it on the first bite but I wanted to eat, I was so hungry. After the 3rd bite I had to put it down. It tasted like I was eating a cube of ice. Everything was so hard and cold... 

Again... Elizabeth was nowhere to be found. A busser noticed we were unhappy and he asked me what was wrong. I told him and he went to grab our waitress with the black ponytail. She came back and was super apologetic, she asked if I wanted something else but I just wanted my money back because I didn't want to wait for another shitty meal from here. After she took my plate away, Elizabeth comes by and asks ""so the burger still wasn't what you wanted?"" & I tell her ""it's what I wanted, it was just really nasty"" & she rolled her eyes, shrugged her shoulders, and just WALKED AWAY! Wow, right? No apologies, nothing. 

We RARELY ever complain or ask for refunds but this time, I HAD to. 

The manager also came and asked if we'd like to replace our entree or remove it from the bill. I told him remove it from the bill.

My boyfriend's Ulcerator burger came out correctly the first time. But, they were super skimpy on fries, less than 10 fries came on the plate!! I personally didn't like this burger either, it looked and sounded like it should have been packed with flavor but it just wasn't. It just tasted like ham and dry meat. 

At least they refunded me. I'm really glad the girl with the black ponytail was helping Elizabeth because if she had been our only waitress, I'm sure we wouldn't have gotten any service at all. I wish I remembered the other girl's name because she really was wonderful.

I was still hungry but scared of the restaurants and deli in Circus Circus but I knew Auntie Anne's wouldn't let me down so for dinner, I wanted to try this place but instead I ate a PRETZEL from Auntie Anne's on the way out from this place! 

Worst service and even worse food here at Vince Neil's!! If I could give it 0 stars I would have.

We really didn't know what to expect and thought we might have to eat Mc Ds, or cafeteria food, ugh! To our surprise there was this very cool full on restaurant in the casino! I guess parents have to eat too. So the food...was sort of a mixed bag. I loved my wedge salad. Perfect amount of dressing and bacon! The adult pizza however was a little strange. It was sauce, pepperoni and cheese on a large hot dog type bun?! Not great. The burgers were good, and our 93 year old grandmother was so happy to see soup on the menu. The menu...was very extensive. Great selection, so there are bound to be some good, some not so much. Overall it was a good experience. They might want to have their music videos digitally remastered or something.

It's hard to talk bad about the food. It's safe, but it doesn't wow. It simply served the purpose of being edible and filling me up.. 
All in all, the only thing more depressing than the lack of an atmosphere and the worst margarita in the history of alcohol itself were the looks of self-deprivation on each of the employees faces.

Tatuado is a crazy fun spot to do it all.  We came here for a birthday dinner but stayed for the show.  The menu is great - all sort of options to choose from - appetizers all the way through to dessert.  
We started with nacho appetizers and they didn't disappoint.  A huge portion with all the toppings and the meat/chili sauce on it was insane good. For dinner I went with the Hombre Burger - a chorizo/beef mixture with guacamole, cheese and these weird little chip strips that gave it a nice crunch.  But the bun.  Oh that bun!  It was this soft bun with melted cheese and jalapenos on top.  To be honest?  I could have just eaten the bun and been totally satisfied.  I kid you not, rock star!
At 7pm the party really starts.  Karaoke, anyone?  There's a big stage on one side of the restaurant and tables and booths surround it.  The karaoke master (I just made that title up but it's super appropriate) is a way talented dude who can belt out almost any genre and make it entertaining.  He was funny, engaging and even on a Sunday night didn't have to beg people to participate.  
The restaurant is full of rock and roll memorabilia with tons of photo ops.  My particular favorite was the outfit displays and in particular, the one with the photo of 2 adult entertainers and the words ""I love single moms"" emblazoned across it.  Well, this is Motley Crue, guys!  
I'm hoping this place does well.  It's got all the right features - good food, decent prices (slightly more expensive than a neighborhood restaurant but much less than most LV Blvd spots), a fun atmosphere and karaoke!

Over the years, I have watched Circus and the venues within evolve and change. The one constant, is the remaining staff whom I consider long term friends. Three years ago, I decided to move back home to Vegas, and I still visit Circus regularly when able. I return because of the friendly staff, good food, low prices, good gaming, but mostly because I love the atmosphere. It reminds me of old Vegas and it never lost its charm. Without DJ Miguel, DJ DJ, the flair bartenders (too many to mention however, Vince Neil's lost some of the BEST in the city to competition) Susie (cocktail) Bob (the pit), MANY employees in the West Deli...

3305043,2013-11-11,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"Came here yesterday with my friends and didn't even know that it was the opening night. The restaurant is located in Circus, Circus. Its got a real edgy rocker decor as it should. There's also lots of cool pics on the wall of other rockers and a cool display of clothing in the back along with an art gallery of rock and roll themed art. Its noisy but its a party atmosphere and the t.v.'s play motley crue videos. 

As far as the food and drinks, they are priced decently, nothing too expensive. For my drink, I ordered ""the groupie"" which is made with a bubblegum flavored vodka. I didn't care for it too much because it was way to sweet and loaded with syrup, my friend also complained of his drink being the same way. For food, I had the Bang, Bang Shrimp. On the menu, it was described as shrimp dusted with some kind of seasoning and spice with bacon, sliced carrots, zucchini and squash with a scoop of jasmine rice. What I got was soggy vegetables, barely any bacon, 5 pieces of shrimp and rice that wasn't jasmine swimming in a bath of spicy creme sauce. It wasn't what I was expecting when I read the description of the dish. I ate as much of it as I could, plus the rice was a little undercooked. Next time I come back, I won't get this again.

Aside from the food, we all had a great time and as an added bonus, Vince Neil was actually there! He came over to our table and took a pic with our friends who were big fans. It was super cool of him to do that. It was opening night, so there is still time for the place to work out the kinks in the food department, but other than that, we did eat, drink and party.",-vSvy4g-UQe5Qwwrp9ci-g,0,1,3,WkdWDY4ckewz9BCjRwyD2w

We ordered the nachos for an appetizer and it was not appetizing at all. It reminded me of a sloppy Tex mex meets ""I'm trying to be healthier"" nachos. The nachos was heavily smothered in watery chili (no meat sauce), red beans, tons of jalapeños, olives and what seemed like nuked shredded cheese on top of the chips. I don't recommend it but to each is own. 

My better half ordered the All American Burger and I ordered the Egg You Burger. 
The burgers looked good when they arrived at our table and tasted delicious at 1st bite. 

Our ghost waited never came to ask us how we were doing until towards the end of our meal. Napkins were needed and so was a glass of water. I asked for a to go cup to take my ice tea with me and he ignored that request and brought us the bill instead.

This was a close your eyes and hope for the best type situation.  If it wasn't for the $7.77 breakfast, it would have been extremely overpriced breakfast and food options.  Seeing what everyone at my table got, the food is way over priced for the quality of what you get.  The coffee tastes like something you get at the tire shop while your waiting to get a flat repaired. And the jelly packets tastes like  they are at least a few years old as they are aluminum tasting.  Not to mention the fake butter packets....first ingredient vegetable oil.  Yum!!!!  Just like grandma use to make.  They didn't even make the rubber pancakes taste better.  

Sadly a wasted meal experience in Vegas.  Words of advice.  Do not eat here.  Denny's would be a better option and that's terribly sad.  In general eat before you come to circus circus unless you want to be stuck with cafeteria food like options which will have you regretting it later.  

Luckily our slow service allowed for some reflection time (one waitress for 9 tables).  When on vacation I will never sacrifice another meal in Las Vegas.

This is what we ordered...........

Pina Colada... it was all pina colada syrup with a spit full of alcohol and no ice. It tasted like cheap pina colada. 

Mac and Cheese... My daughter is a mac and cheese fanatic she didn't like it at all. It came with fries. Fries were actually really good. 

Shrimp tacos....The shrimp were grilled from one side only. It was just ok. The pico de gallo was to die for. That was the best pico de gallo I have ever tasted. Vince Neal needs to have his own pico de gallo brand. It came with chips and salsa. I ate 2 tacos and destroyed the 3rd one. Did not eat the chips and salsa. 

Spaghetti... It had the smallest meatballs I have ever seen. I did not tried it but he said it wasn't good at all. He said it was bland and needed seasoning. He did not get garlic bread or anything to go with his spaghetti. 

Cheesecake... It was not good at all!! 

Everything came to $60 including tip. My daughters meal was free with a coupon they were giving away at the casino. We left hungry and very disappointed.

1. The food is mediocre at best.  The menu items sound good, but they all lacked in follow through.  I had a burger and I think I would have rather gone to a fast food place instead and would have been happier.  My daughter had pancakes and they were blah, IHOP has better ones and for cheaper too.

2. The hot mess that was the kitchen.  I have no idea what was going on, but it was bad.  We got there on a Tuesday afternoon just after 12pm.  There were only 3 tables sat when we walked in.  Our server was great and super fast.  We ordered and then the wait started.  It was over 40 minutes before our food came out.  We kept asking if they had an ETA and they just kept saying it was coming.  When the food did come out, the plates were super hot but the food was warm at best.  My daughter's pancakes were rubbery and cold on a scalding hot plate. The only food that came out at the right temp was the scrambled eggs on a different plate.  Complete disappointment across the board.

Also, but this time, most of the tables were sat and no one was getting their food at all, so it was a whole kitchen issue.  There were plenty of servers who were doing great.

My dad wanted to just leave, but there really wasn't anywhere else to eat in the place that wasn't fast food or a buffet, and we needed to be on property for other commitments. 

It's hard to even write this review because I love me some Vince Neil and Motley Crue, but something needs to be fixed ASAP.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,14,13,1,XypkPqWWAuSpxM0JTqqecg

we also got 2 margaritas. the bartender hooked us up with a lot of tequila gold. the drinks were too strong for our liking. I felt like we were drinking tequila straight and it's suppose to be a strawberry margarita. lol for some people they would like it that way.

4733790,2017-06-10,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"Okay so this was one of those things where we gambled and we won. We bought a Groupon for the restaurant for two steak dinners, a bottle of wine, and cheesecake for $30-something. We were so apprehensive about the place after we bought the Groupon and did some research, and that feeling remained until we actually sat down and started having a great time. This was probably our favorite dining experience we had all trip.

Pros:
-Of course the playlist was amazing. They played a lot of 2000's alternative, so we sang along to virtually everything that came on (H.I.M. was played. When was the last time you heard them playing overhead anywhere?) They also have nightly karaoke
-The steak was well seasoned, and the menu covered a lot of different types of food, so there's something for everyone. The cheesecake was vacuumed up in about two seconds, and the wine was a better quality than we thought it'd be.
-The service was exceptional. Our waiter was great, and the GM came out to introduce himself to us.


Cons:
-The restaurant is in Circus Circus and has a separate bar that you find before the restaurant. We saw the bar area first thinking it was the whole establishment and kind of internally freaked out because it was not at all the kind of place we wanted to eat. Thankfully, the bartender told us there was a sit down section, and things picked up from there. Circus Circus should have better signs for it.
-We ordered our steaks medium and they came out done, so just make sure to order one temp down. 
-The price without a Groupon is steep. We paid $36 for everything which is pretty cheap normally, but without the Groupon our dinner would have been about $100.

I'd probably come back with another deal or if I was in Vegas with a rock fan who would enjoy the atmosphere.",HcgQ39CwzqEuZ8q5Vp2CRw,4,0,4,iqDW-BxaYp03THhj9nnHHg

That is not the case at ViNCE NEiL'S. Looking for breakfast at Circus Circus, we found that many restaurants are only open until later. The Buffet? Maybe, but $13.95 for all I can eat? Which isn't all that much. A donut and coffee at Krispy Kreme isn't nutritious at all. So, I saw that Vince Neil's Tatuado (English translation - ""Tattooed"") was open for breakfast. They are tucked away in a far corner of the main level, far away from the front lobby and past the main casino. The place has somewhat of an ""industrial"" ambiance, said to be ""reminiscent of Sunset Strip rock clubs."" Pictures of rock stars are all around and it does have a cool vibe.

There are several choices for breakfast plates, and they provide an abundance of food. I chose my favorite - chicken-fried steak, country style hash-browns and eggs. And toast. The steak was huge, nice and crisp, and covered in sausage gravy. Yum! My wife had French toast with strawberries and confectioners sugar along with two eggs. She said the strawberries were frozen, not fresh; a bit of a let-down. The others in our party had eggs with big sausage patties and pancakes, and an omelet. 

The good part is that the coupon book provided by the hotel had a coupon good for $2 off each order, which saved us $8.00 - a very good deal. The food was good, more than some of us could eat, and a better deal than the buffet. You can't go wrong here.",2BCuFxAkQD9PFobJOKhcLQ,1,0,4,G2DzguM6tAPVS7NIPgI_WA

4960363,2015-04-06,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"Finally got around to eating here when I had a friend in town that was curious about the place. As a die-hard rock and roll fan I had been curious about this place for quite some time.

Vince Neil is quite the businessman away from the music world as well, having run bars, strip clubs, concert venues, marketed his own alcohol, and now this restaurant in Circus Circus. I have noticed a lot of negative reviews, and while I would not go out of my way to dine here again, if I ever found myself in Circus Circus, I would definitely return.

I am a rock and roll fan and an author of concert and album reviews, plus self published books of classic rock/hard rock bands, so the decor on the walls of this place instantly won me over. Posters of album covers, guitars, vintage stage outfits, vintage Mark Weiss photographs; the decor and photos alike make this place a rock fan's dream come true. I had to get out of my seat twice just to walk around and take it all in!

When I first arrived there was no host(ess) at the booth, but a man dressed in a suit and tie (presumably a manager) seated us within two minutes of arriving at the door. This guy treated us well, checked up on us often, and definitely deserves credit for his efforts. Sadly, the restaurant was short staffed and we did not see many other employees around for most of the dining experience. The few people we dealt with treated us well, but even when it was time to get the bill I had to get up and actually ask someone to bring it.

The biggest issue I had with dining here was that, upon being given the menu, the server told us ""the entrees are not available at lunch."" So in other words, the good majority of the ""major"" menu items, including several I wanted to try, were not available. Not only would having more of these items available have made for a better dining experience; they also would have gotten more money from me! But seriously, how hard would it be to make a separate lunch menu that at least has SOME of the entree choices?

Music was playing on the speakers/televisions throughout the meal, and not just the hard rock you would expect; there were vintage pop songs as well (Beatles, Michael Jackson, etc.) The manager guy said that the heavier stuff plays later in the evening, and that is understandable enough. There was also a live stage set up, though no live entertainment was playing at the time of our visit.

Contrary to what other reviews have stated, I had no problem with the food whatsoever. I got an order of chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were meaty and crispy, and had no tough meat whatsoever. The fries were very crispy and cooked well. Everything I ate in here was delicious, though I would liked to have been able to taste one of the entrees that are supposedly only available come dinner time.

Overall, my visit to Vince Neil's restaurant was a good one, just not a great one. I am not going to park in the parking garage at Circus Circus and fight my way through the casino again for the purpose of eating here, but if I am in the casino again for any reason, I would be willing to dine their again. If you are visiting Circus Circus or the area anyway, I recommend dining here, just keep your expectations in check. Overall I can give Tatuado a modest recommendation.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,3,3iax1rrbh5PS2UaMN3d1cQ

Then put some of the slushee, and more of the cheap booze on top. VOM (vomit). Even when we mixed it up it was absolutely disgusting, and not wanting to waste our money, had to force ourselves, like pinch our noses from tasting it, to get it down. Once we got halfway down and could mix it up more, the drink was finally okay to drink and gave us each a very nice buzz. We were starving and asked if we could have some food. ""Yeah sure!"" the bartender responded and as excitedly combed the menu. The options looked crazy, wanted to try the Krispy Kreme burger or the mac and cheese . After 10 minutes of excitedly looking and reaching a decision, the bartender tells us he's sorry, but the kitchen is closed. I do want to try their burgers, but this place skeeves me out.

5326844,2018-06-09,9,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"After settling into our room at Circus Circus, the hubby and I agreed somewhere nearby for dinner would be best with our two toddlers.

Vince Neil's Tatuado seemed promising. This large restaurant is not terribly far from the West Tower where we were especially considering the ultra fast elevators.

On a Sunday evening, this place is not crowded at all.

A single guy with limited karaoke experience decided to sing just before we left. A country song no less. A Brooks & Dunn hit at that. Very strange choice if you saw this man. How I wish my ears could unhear it all. But one of our daughters is just like her grandmother and we end up waiting for her for everything. The Fart Around Queen, we call her. So of course we had to stay and listen to him then con her out of there by mentioning the Midway (arcade and circus acts) a floor above us.

FOOD
- Bloody Mary ($9.75) was different. It had a fair amount of alcohol, but there was too much of something in it and I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Not my fav.
- Iceberg Wedge Salad ($10.99) - very fresh. Good amount of bleu cheese dressing. But it wasn't just a wedge - it was the whole head of iceberg lettuce. Ha! Topped with diced tomatoes and bacon bits.

SERVICE
I was a bit disappointed that our server, Martha, did not automatically know the soup of the day. Service was good other than that.

ENVIRONMENT
The place could use a deep cleaning and some repairs (like our booth was off-kilter and a sharp edge was revealed). There is a nice large bar. Tables and booth seating. A separate nicer booth for Vince Neil and his entourage. And as alluded to earlier, karaoke.

PRICE
Look, I'm grateful they even have a kid's menu, but $7.99 per entrée plus an additional $2.95 for fountain drinks was a bit steep. Then my husband had a $15.98 bacon cheeseburger. He didn't comment on it so that usually indicates that it was a regular run-of-the-mill burger.

Overall, it's decent if you have a family to re-energize and don't want to wait very long on a Sunday night.

Service was horrible, he played hide and seek through our horrible experience.  I asked him about if the bartender can make me a drink not on their horrible alcohol list and he went so far in left field that I was embarrassed of what came out of his mouth. I'd ask if they can make a Mojito and he said he thinks he can, that's made with Orange juice right? He say's and I was like, are you kidding me? No it doesn't. So he said he was going to ask the bartender after he took the rest of our parties drink and I over heard him asking the bartender if he can make a Mojito and it looked by his face that he was being spoke in a foreign language he couldn't understand, then said I don't know how to.  Well my friend, I can see you probably won't move up from this place not knowing a generic drink as the Mojito is. 
Well enough of that horrible scene to the food; the food was overcooked and was just horrible. We had the chicken burrito which was prepared to make you sick. Our party also ordered three burgers, which were overcooked and bad.  Then finally we had fried chicken and that was actually decent.

5389105,2016-01-17,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,"Perhaps I set my expectations a bit too high for Vegas hotel eateries, or perhaps this place just sucks. A friend and I were visiting Vegas and staying at the Circus Circus hotel when our dinner plans suddenly cancelled. Hungry and tired of searching, we settled on just eating at the hotel. First, there was live music, which is to be expected at a Motley Crue restaurant. What was not to be expected was a man in leather chaps and a cowboy hat belting out country music. I'm sure many patrons would love this setup, however, my friend and I despise country music, so this was equivalent to sitting right at the gates of hell. Seeing as it was pretty late, we anticipated we wouldn't be there long so we stuck it out. I got the Mac and cheese, which took waaaaay too long to come out. We waited a while for the server to even come to the table so we were able to order immediately when he first arrived, then waited an additional 45 minutes for our food. The bacon in the Mac and cheese was way too salty, the plate was hot as if it were just thrown in the microwave, and the cheese looked like it had been sitting out a while. Not appetizing at all. We had a total of three encounters with the server: once to order, when he brought our food, and when we asked for the check.

We went last night prior to fright dome and all I can say is that I make better food at home! That is not good! 
We ordered a large 6 to 8 person appetizer platter that was supposed to be loaded with nachos, quesadillas, a spinach dip with chips, mozzarella sticks, barbecue spareribs, and a few other items. The platter came and it was loaded with all of these things, all of which tasted like food that was taken from a package from the freezer that was bought at Albertson's! To add to that,it also tasted like that same food was leftovers from another party. It was disgusting and we only touched 10% of it. The platter cost $40 and we all agreed that we threw $40 down the drain. 
The drinks were average but that is not what we came here. We were literally hungry and we left hungry!
Simply put, we are not even going to try to go back here again. This place needs to have new management or a better chef or something. Hands-down, one of the five worst 'restaurants' I have been to in Las Vegas.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,2,0,1,h4uu7TP-pQlw6wdIL3K1LQ

Our waitress was just as awful and rude.  We eat out a lot and this was the worst service ever.  
Her attitude wasn't professional or pleasant at all.

The only employee that we did encounter that was nice and friendly was the hostess and she is actually the person that brought our food out to us. 
Maybe the the manager might think about moving her to the floor to wait tables, she was the only person that asked if we were doing well, asked if we needed anything else and legitimately cared.

5901805,2016-07-28,0,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the steak was so tough! It had great flavor and was prepared correctly but I spit out more than I ate! We had sirloin with mash potatoes which were delicious and the ribs and fries...those were good. It did seem to take a while for us to get our food being that it wasn't busy. The waiters were friendly and DJ Miguel was great keeping the audience interacting with the karaoke singers. The restaurant is mostly family friendly however music videos are playing constantly and there were some really provocative that some parents may feel uncomfortable exposing their children to.#RoadtripUSA,ME-NQxchxceHzbT5vPaXpw,0,0,4,dMyBriob6BWD4nZqhNs_OA

I got their signature burger shown on all the posters, and it was pretty good.  Service was fast too.  This is the best restaurant at Circus Circus with the exception of The Steak House (which is about as pricey as a Ruth's Chris).",HagDE6gB6MJ4mcDyBkIDFQ,0,0,4,DNP1jRglK8U1U5WKrUmm6w
5912071,2014-11-15,3,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,The entire circus circus casino is in need of cleaning.    There is no pride in the employees.   Dirty uniforms hygiene and facilities.   Comps are non existent and the general feeling is that nobody cares.  Hesitate to even give one star,uxlVKI_tSA-yMNDfffngJw,2,1,1,D8dL6PItFZP5DwD5KspR5Q
5947725,2015-10-11,1,nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg,I was deeply disappointed. I'm shocked Vince Neil would allow his name to be on here. Several drinks were not offered that were on the menu. No IPA. And the house wine was one step above Mad Dog 20/20. Service was disappointing and it wasn't even busy. And what restaraunt /bar on the strip doesnt have Bacardi???,E1FnwYRHoRQKdmenGGlpGg,2,1,1,2gZr4GkZtSpTRz5qq_GDSQ

The food offerings are generally American - burgers, salads, sandwiches, and there are a few Mexican options (tacos and burritos).  I had the shrimp tacos and I recommend it.  A tad spicy, as there are pieces of jalapenos or peppers hiding under the cabbage and salsa.  There is a fair amount of shrimp in each taco, not just two pieces.  The sauce is zesty, so additional sauce isn't necessary. You get three in an order.  I also tried some of my bf's avocado cheeseburger - juicy and huge.  Those fries are something else!  I'm not sure what it is, but the coating, shape and crunch are not like typical French fries (they kind of remind me of churros - they are dark and shaped more round with sharp edges than square).

This place is loud, with TVs playing music videos from the past, which is kind of neat (you don't see 80's or 90's music videos at restaurants many places nowadays) and nostalgic.  Decor here is Motley Crue instruments, awards and wardrobes, so that's the theme - hair/rock bands.  It looks like there is a stage in the center of the restaurant, so I assume a band or DJ plays/spins on weekend evenings.  Staff is friendly and quick to seat you.  Food is ready fairly quickly and our server, Windy, was attentive to our table.",xhoo5RxotqYBIQGzmwvVPw,3,2,4,wH5Ufq0SBkzwO6GxhPdlQw
