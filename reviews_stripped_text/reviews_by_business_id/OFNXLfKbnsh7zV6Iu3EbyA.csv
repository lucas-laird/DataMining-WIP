I order my food and then proceed to pay,  then the girl working there takes my phone from me and redeems my Groupon,  then goes off and tells me that she has to push the redeem button herself because her boss looks at the camera and if I do it the Groupon won't be honored.  Anyways I order my food mozzarella sticks,  order of shrimp, 2 sodas, and 2 orders of chicken fettuccine alfredo and the Cashier proceeds to tell the cook my order laughing telling her they ordered your favorite food and then hear the cook complain about it. Mind you this place is so small me and my mom can hear everything they say. Then while we wait for our food the pizza delivery guy comes in and the Cashier,  cook, and him have a full blown conversation both cursing and taking really loud about beating their kids ass if the misbehave, i don't know if it's just me but this is just horrible customer service.  When I finally get my food 30 minutes later I'm waiting for my garlic bread and sodas.  I ask where my bread is and I see that the cook realizes she burned my bread(it was bound to happen with them talking)  and then say it will be right out (10 minutes later I get them) Then I ask about my sodas and the Cashier says she never charged me for them,  which was a lie because I saw her write it down when taking my order and charging me,  but since I had no receipt because they didn't give me any and it was her word against mine, I had to buy 2 more sodas which was $3.50!! So I start eating my chicken fettuccine alfredo and the food couldn't have tasted any planner,  it honestly had no flavor whatsoever.  My mom who eats almost anything didn't even like it!!... I'm writing this review to warn people not to go here. Save your money and go somewhere else.  Horrible customer service and horrible food was all I got when I came here..

158189,2017-11-12,0,OFNXLfKbnsh7zV6Iu3EbyA,Ordered pizza and they called back and said it would be delivered 1.5 hours later.  It did arrive and it was cold.  I ordered a 2 Liter Coke and sausage and pepperoni.  They delivered 4 twelve ounce cans of coke and a cheese pizza.  2 liters of coke is equivalent to 5.6 cans of coke.  How convenient for them.  I called them and reported it and they said they would call me back and then never did.  The pizza was so bad I couldn't eat it.  I put the pizza and soda back into a bag and then  I delivered it back to their store which had a sign on the door which said it was under remodel.  Anyway I was able to get someone to the door.  I gave them back their pizza and soda and told them that they needed to credit back my money.  They just yessed me and no intention of making good on it.  I will help them by calling the credit card company.  Afterall I didn't sign anything so they have no proof of delivery.  Stay away from these scammers.  It is obvious that they are just taking advantage of tourists so they can provide lousy service since they are not counting on a repeat business.

I kept it with me just in case and I'm glad I did.  After a day club on Friday, we took a long nap and were too tired to go to a sushi restaurant as we originally planned. So I decided to give this place a try (I didn't check Yelp reviews).

I was told that the delivery time was anywhere between an hour and an hour and 30 minutes.

The food arrived right on time. We ordered chicken wings, one Hawaiian pizza, and one Flamingo Deluxe with two additional toppings (pineapples and jalapenos). The food was good. The Flamingo Deluxe with pineapples and jalapenos was so good that I wish I ordered two of them instead of one and Hawaiian. The order also came with two small containers of Ranch dressing.

Although the food was good and it arrived right on time, I'm giving this place 3 stars because I had to go down to the lobby to grab my order. The delivery guy called me upon arrival and asked me to come meet him at the lobby to pick up the order. Ummmm...this wasn't my first time ordering pizzas for delivery and I've never ever had to get out of my house (or hotel room in this case) to pick up my order.

I asked him ""what happens now?"" and he said to call the shop back and sort it out with them. And so I did. I explained to them that their driver had broke down on his way and they said they'd call him to figure out what to do. I then explained that the driver just told me to call THEM. Ok, so the guy at the shop said they'd get another driver to deliver my pizza. No apology, no discount offer, no time estimate.

8:45 PM: A half hour later the shop called me again just to tell me that another driver was on his way. They never told me if this was the original pizza or a freshly baked one.

9:12 PM: Two hours after my original phone call, another delivery guy arrived with a cold pizza. After expressing my dissatisfaction with their service (and assuring him it was nothing personal), he suggested that I call the shop for a discount. They offered 4 dollars off of a $22 bill. I told him to take $10 or they can have the order back. The guy on the phone originally declined (are you kidding me??) but the classy delivery convinced them to agree. He didn't even want a tip. Nice delivery guy, but 90-minute old, room temperature pizza, douchebag staff. And it gave me the runs in the morning. Won't be ordering again. Won't be changing this review. Don't even ask me.

1355869,2017-06-06,1,OFNXLfKbnsh7zV6Iu3EbyA,"This place is shady, please don't get scammed and think twice before giving this place your business. My review isn't the first with this story, I actually just read one below with the exact same circumstance, and now I'm thinking this happens a lot. 

Short version: driver went to the wrong hotel, half my order was missing, called and said they'd deliver it, never came, called for a refund....twice, haven't been refunded and, after reading other reviews, I'm not expecting to be. 

Ordering was easy and I anticipated a heavy wait time considering it was dinner time, but I was pleasantly surprised when my driver quickly called to say he was down the street and would arrive any minute. I went downstairs and waited, no one there yet, but I figured there must be some traffic. I got a call from the driver and he was actually at a totally different hotel on the opposite end of the strip from where I was staying. Not sure what happened there, but the driver said he'd be at my hotel in about 20 minutes. He got there probably closer to 30-45 minutes later and apologized profusely. If that were the end of the problems I'd be ok with it. 

But, after receiving my order, I walked over to a bench nearby to make sure everything was there and realized half was missing just as the driver sped away. I called the restaurant immediately to let them know and they said that they'd get the other half right out to me. After waiting a couple of hours, it never arrived so I called and asked for a refund and they said they could do that and put me on hold. When they came back they said that they'd give the manager my phone number and they'd call me to issue the refund. 

That was on a Thursday. 

After not hearing back for three days, I called the following Monday morning and asked to speak to the manager. I was told he wasn't in. I asked when he might be back and they said he comes in at random times and no one really knows when he'll be back (as mentioned in another review)--MAJOR RED FLAG. He asked if he could help so I explained the situation and he seemed genuinely upset that this wasn't taken care of, saying he knew the person who was on when I placed my order, they'd get right on it, it's good I paid with a card and not cash because that's so simple, bla bla bla. I was feeling slightly optimistic until the guy was ready to hang up and I had to ask him if he needed my phone number, because how else was the manager supposed to find my order and call me back to issue the refund? Red flag #2. 

I'm still waiting for that phone call and a refund. Not going to hold my breath. This place is shady as hell. They're scamming customers. Please don't give them your money, they'll probably scam you like they did to myself and others.",Jmmsuc4ptDZ1eOILGvY6nQ,6,1,1,Cfq3PtXTWjP2LBwxfUslsQ

Ordered takeout wings for a VGK game night and they were dry - both in terms of being overcooked and barely sauced. 

I recently purchased a Groupon to use on a future visit but luckily saw some posted signage that basically invalidated the deal- Groupon is for takeout but they require that you be there in person to place your order (rather than by phone) with at least two people present, regardless of how many people you are ordering for or how much you spend. Who even does that? I figured a business with zero customers on a weekend with low ratings couldn't possibly be in a position to turn away business, but a staff member clarified that they would rather I get a refund from Groupon (and not come back at all) than come back and try to use it without following their arbitrary rules that contradict both the fine print AND common sense.

The driver was the rudest person ever... personally called me and told me I did not tip him enough and demanded me to come down and give him more money. The only other cash I had was $100 bill and he told me to give him my card number so he can get more money and cussed me out as well. I was in tears...Half of the order was incorrect as well. I spent almost $75 for my order.

1925988,2016-02-12,0,OFNXLfKbnsh7zV6Iu3EbyA,"After my first review, I was contacted by the new owners via a Yelp message. They read my ""unsatisfied"" review and asked me to stop by and pick up a free 16"" pizza, on them.

I called in to confirm this deal and was assisted by Jade. She is the wife of the owner, Fatih; she helps him with the online reviews. She told me to come by and was very friendly. We headed over to Chinatown; the shop is located at the edge of one of the big plazas off of Wynn. 

The shop is quaint; the paint was fresh and everything was clean for the most part. The owner came out to meet me and shook my hand. Jade also greeted me with a handshake and a smile. He immediately began to express his apology and he seemed truly genuine. He explained that he took over the shop about 5 months ago and they are still getting some of the logistics in order. I mentioned the confusion with their websites, and he explained that they are working with Google to get everything fixed. The previous owner must have dropped everything in their lap, with them to sort through the confusion. 

They offered me my pizza, it was hot and fresh. (I made sure to try it in the car while it was still fresh so I could get a better idea about the quality and flavors.) The crust was soft and fluffy. There were even some seasonings added - like basil and oregano - for increased taste. Overall, the ingredients were fresh. I am a pizza fanatic, so I will not say it was the BEST pizza in the whole WORLD. But I will say that for less than $10 in Chinatown, it is actually a very good deal. 

I recommend that you carry-out if you live far or if you think it will be a busy night - the pizza is best hot. I haven't tried the wings again; they were big, so that is a plus. 

Look, the truth is, this is a mom and pop place with new owners. It isn't perfect, and I think they are still working out the kinks. But if they are willing to reach out and make things better, they deserve the opportunity of your business. Very few places respond to Google or Yelp reviews, let alone offering to replace your meal or a free pie.",NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q,0,0,4,E1HkzGbvy1vMwBz_ooVEvQ

2118391,2018-01-30,1,OFNXLfKbnsh7zV6Iu3EbyA,"Looks like most of the newest reviews match my review right now.

Don't order from this place.

I ordered a double cheeseburger with a side of fries.

I ended up ordering the same, with two extra sides of fries (I like fries, what can I say?), and when they told me their minimum delivery order was $15, I added a can of soda.

Two hours later (and an hour after being told my order was being cooked), I got what I ordered.

The fries were pretty good, and the burger was actually good.

But, looking at their website in hindsight, their posted minimum delivery order is $10.  So, my burger and a soda would have met that requirement.

So, I spent $25 for something that I'd have spent $20 at my hotel for.

Not to mention, just like previous reviews... somehow, they find ways to slip their fliers underneath room doors they shouldn't even have access to (I've already sent an email to the hotel I stayed at this weekend with suggestions on how to prevent this in the future, since their front desk confirmed that they didn't put them under my door).

Needless to say... since I was literally about to order UberEats when this order arrived, and I didn't want to be a jerk about the whole thing, I accepted it, tipped, and moved on with my life... until reading these reviews and noticing how close they were to my own experience.

I'm a patient woman, so when I placed an order on a Saturday night, I knew it was going to take a while.  1.5 hours is nbd.  But two minutes past the ""latest they'll get there"", when I hadn't heard anything, I called to check on my order and it was ""on the way""  It did indeed arrive a few minutes later.  

Half of my order was missing - and because it was already so late and the poor delivery driver was clearly very busy (and polite!) I declined his offer to go back and get my missing items.  I decided to call for a refund.  

When I called the person promised she would put a note on the manager's desk to refund my items that I didn't receive.  I also let her know that one of my pizza that did arrive had ONE CUT into the pizza that only went halfway through.  i.e. it wasn't sliced.  Literally, there was 1 cut halfway through the pizza and that's it.  Absurd!

After 10 business days, when I didn't see a refund, I called the business, and the real shenanigans started.  I have called 6 times since then, each time, they tell me to call at a different time because the manager isn't in.  I've called at 11 am, at 8 pm, at 5 pm, all times that the person on the phone recommended because the ""manager is only in when we open"" or ""the manager only comes in at 8 to pick up the money bag.""  RIDICULOUS.  It is a month and a half later, I Don't have my refund, and the only way I can get it...per the suggestion of an employee, is to dispute the charge with my bank.  Same employee also suggested I ""swoop in"" between 11 and 2 when the managers are there so they can't dodge me anymore.  That is CRAZY that I would have to do that.  

To top it all off...the pizza isn't very good.  Pizza Hut was 100% better in all ways than this business run by jerkwads.  I will never recommend them, I will post this review everywhere, and I will tell all my coworkers on business travel to avoid this place at all costs.",uYYfk-SL-9zb5Jvj-rncNg,5,2,1,z0sSdzSIi-q_JapgOO0vUw

First of all, parking at this place is horrible especially on a Friday night.  The Groupon was dine-in only, we walk in to see a total of 6 tables, 4 that seated 2 people and 2 that seated 4 people, obviously this place doesn't get a lot of dine-in customers! We were there on a fairly cool night in Vegas, in one corner of the ""dining area"" the front door was propped open & in the other corner, a large utility fan was running at full blast....how inviting! We were quickly told that anything that said special on the menu could not be purchased with the Groupon, no problem. We ordered a pizza with extra cheese, mozzarella sticks, a Diet Coke and a water. While we were waiting, the conversation between the staff was completely unsavory, every other word was the 4 letter f-bomb, I'm fairly open minded, but wow! Once the Lord's name was taken in vain, I about jumped out of my skin! Okay to the food, we got a can of Diet Coke, it had dirt & what appeared to be cigarette ashes on the top, a bottle of water & our mozzarella sticks with some cheap paper plates. The sticks were good. Then comes the pizza..... they seriously set the pizza box on your little 2 seater table & walk away! The crust was the equivalent of copy paper.  Obviously, the ovens are not balanced because one side was done & the other was still gooey & raw, pretty difficult with that thin of crust! It was okay, but by the time we got it my blood was boiling due to the horrible atmosphere, constant swearing & freezing from the air blowing in.

I was a little upset that the item doesn't mention everything that it came with, so I ended up having 2 orders of French fries.

For the food itself, the chicken had a nice taste to it, but it was a little overcooked. The baked beans were good, you get about 2 tablespoons of baked beans, and the 2 pieces of garlic bread were really just 2 pieces of sub bread with some garlic butter spread. The bread would've been better, if it was toasted after the spread was put on, instead of being soft and almost soggy. I give this a 4 star review, due to the combo, the taste and the availabity.

After reading some of these reviews posted on Yelp I am convinced that they were left by friends or family of existing employees. It is a pizza place in the middle of a  Chinatown, that should have been my first clue. Nevertheless I am curious and exploring new options I went there ordered 16 inch pizza with 20 wings. 

The price was bad at $29.99, keep in mind when I looked at my pizza it seemed like they were short on pepperoni and used an excessive amount of dough. I ordered mild and hot wings they look like they were almost plain they were stingy on the sauce I guess. I also ordered two sides of ranch that were the smallest cups I have ever seen I was very disappointed they charged me $0.50 for each one. Even knowing that I was unsure of my purchase before I paid I still continued what's the worst that could happen. 

After being dissatisfied when eating the pizza I said I will never go there again. Hour and a half later feeling a terrible stomach pain beginning to think this place was a bad choice once again. Just warning you guys who are curious and exploring new places this place is not a New York style pizza like other fake reviews claim. This is one of the lowest quality pizzas I have ever tasted. 

People you have been warned.....

Ps. To the staff that will hopefully read this review. Please step up the quality of your dough remember that less cheese and less pepperoni doesn't  mean savings, it means crappy Pizza.",PNW38K8wE6b6d7pTBckj4g,0,0,1,oub2TpXwMYE-2Np6_LePVg

Very easy place to access on the corner in chinatown, although parking is limited on a Friday night. You might want to park in the other side by 99 ranch. 
When we first entered there was no greeting with the four workers behind the counter. The menu by the counter just showed pictures with no sizing or prices listed. Only once we tried to seat ourselves did some guy with glasses yelled ""hey you ready to order?!"" I had to grab a menu off the tables to see what exactly they offered. Between ordering I wanted to check in on yelp and I was offered a free soda, but the guy didn't believe me and wanted me to leave a review before getting my free soda. Then the lady yells my name is Irene like I'm suppose to give her a nice review when she didn't even acknowledge or bother to help in the first place.
You could tell this place was struggling by the calzone tasting like a plain hot sandwich with no sauce according to my dinner date, he had to ask for marinara sauce and suggested he minus well just go to subway.

I bought a Groupon and when I tried to use it they charged me from a different menu that isn't posted anywhere (higher prices than online and their carry out menus) so it came out to no discount at all it was $29 total for a 12 inch pizza and 5 mozzarella sticks.

When she read me back my number back I noticed that she got it wrong and tried to correct it but was hung up on. So then I called back to confirm my number to which she then rushed me off the phone while assuring me that she had my number. Keep that in mind.
So not only did my food come an hour and twenty minutes late when I tried to cancel prior to getting my food when it was just  an hour late the rude operator hung up on me twice without giving me my refund. She said I'd be charged anyway for their terrible service effectively stealing my money. The icing on the cake is that the delivery women finally called me after being an hour and twenty minutes late and told me that she didn't have the right number. Then when I got downstairs the food was ice cold. The delivery woman knew she was an hour late and still expected a tip. Them was mad when I rightfully refused to do so. I should have expected that beforehand because by then I already knew I was dealing with an unprofessional establishment. 
Do not, I repeat DO NOT, order from the horrific establishment. They are frauds and thieves who operate without knowing the meaning of the word costumer service and do not deserve anyone's patronage. And apparently most of the other yelpers who have encountered these charlatans agree with me.

I bought a Groupon online for this restaurant, and when I called to make an order the restaurant said that in order for me to use the groupon I would have to come in with the 4 people I was ordering for (even though that is not what the groupon requirements were). When we got to the restaurant my first opinion was how it didn't look too appealing, but hey some hole-in-the-walls are secretly the best, right? Well not this one!! Anyway, we waited almost 10 minutes while the workers occasionally stared at us but did not say anything. There were 2 people in the back making food, and 2 who were answering phones. Finally one of the workers, a lady with two tear drops tattooed on her face, asked me what I wanted to order. After I ordered my pizza and I began to get the payment together the lady answered the ringing phone again and walked away leaving me standing for at least 20 minutes before I decided that the food wasn't worth the disrespect and the time wasted. To say the least, we didn't even get the chance to try the food, but we can agree that this was the worst customer service experience that we have received from any company.

Then, an hour and 10 minutes pass so we decide to call and see whats going on. Someone answers and right away tells us to hold. This time 15 minutes pass so we hang up. We decide to call once more, this time they answer and ask what we want (the lady had a very bad attitude). We tell them we've been waiting for an hour and a half for our food. She says it will be deliver in 10 minutes. Now we're getting a little frustrated. We could've gone to the mcdonalds down the street and ate by now.

Lastly, we wait 20 minutes and the delivery guy finally calls and tells us to meet him at the regristration desk in the front of the hotel.
You're kidding right? They asked for our room number and we gave it to them. Why couldnt they deliver to the room? What is the point of delivery if I still have to get off my comfy bed and walk half a mile to get my food? We paid $5 for delivery. The food was fair at best, rather cold and stale. 

Pathetic.",6CaNY-CjKX-nOoMFHeaKDw,3,0,1,od3U-5vh476Nm8lbt1Jtbg

Would highly appreciate it if they weren't rude over the phone. We ordered the large pizza and it came out to be about $18+. We were recommended by a friend about this place saying they had very cheap pizza. We gave them a call saying we want a large pepperoni pizza for takeout. The lady didn't tell us our total, and sounded like she was being rushed then hung up. Well of course it's our mistake as well not asking what's our total but a common courtesy for them to tell us a total over the phone without asking would be nice. Came in got our pizza, was shock on the total but we didn't want to make a fuss about it then left.

The pizza we ordered was good, had the thin crust style. Was served ready and hot when we picked it up. No complains about the pizza just the service could use some good phone etiquette.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,4,0,3,juL3OlukqNrZ75QP9NDaNQ

The gyro meat is lean yet hearty and the pizza is made with dough and cheese and sauce (nice!).

I am often reminded of orcish warfare when eating hoagies a.k.a. Grinders a.k.a. Subs and the pasta is good too.

Pizza delivered to my hotel lobby at 3AM is a necessity. I can get two 18"" one topping pizzas (always mushrooms and pepperoni) in under an hour and for roughly $30 (including tip). They deliver to the entire Strip but can only go as far as the hotel lobby, but do you really want a stranger knocking on your hotel room door at 3AM? Their pizza is super tasty by the way. I must've killed half of one pizza laying in my bed watching The Walking Dead reruns after a longass night of clubbing. Never tried anything but their pizza, but if you're going to call a pizza store and order a burger or a Philly cheesesteak and then complain about it, you really need to take a good close look at yourself in the mirror.

I ordered a margarita pizza, raviolis with a salad and garlic bread and a two liter of soda. The Margarita Pizza had sauce on it. Margarita pizzas aren't supposed to have sauce. The raviolis were drowned in sauce and there were only 5 raviolis in the dish. I included a picture. The Margarita Pizza wasn't cooked and the salad dressing they delivered was the wrong salad dressing. The menu stated Diet Coke so I ordered a Diet Coke and they sent a Diet Pepsi. When the driver arrived he called me and said I needed to come down and pick it up. I explained to him that I was in my pajamas and I couldn't walk cuz I had blisters on my feet. If I could walk I would have eaten at one of the other 1 million restaurants that were in the lobby of my hotel. Money wasn't an issue I just had a hard time walking and wanted to stay off my feet. It feels like a mile from my hotel room to the lobby. He argued with me extensively and I cut him off and said, ""Why was I even asked what my hotel room number was if I was going to have to go to the lobby and pick up my food? They should have explained that on the phone."" He said he couldn't leave his car. Last night, when I came back from my conference, I saw a driver putting menus under the doors of all the hotel rooms on my floor. If in fact it's true that the drivers aren't allowed to leave their cars and deliver food to the hotel rooms then why did I see a guy delivering food and putting menus underneath the doors? Hands down, of all the places I've ever eaten at, this is the worst restaurant I have ever witnessed in my life!!!

The pizza shop has a new owner as of a month ago and a new menu too! So it's under new management and improved! 

Street parking infront. Great customer service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Very clean. 

I tried their pesto chicken pizza, white pizza with basil, bacon cheeseburger and fries and chicken Caesar salad. They have sooo much variety on the menu. 

They deliver and open till 4am during the weekdays and 530am during the weekend. Which is great for late night eats and an alternative to other asian options in Chinatown . Very close to the strip if you're looking for cheap and yummy eats after partying and they can even deliver to you!

Since I skipped dinner and breakfast, I opted to find a new place to try without going over $20.

So I searched which Groupon I still have to use before they expired and also browsed what good deals they might have. Ultimately decided on getting a new Group promo on Flamingo Pizza, since it is only a slight detour and a new place To try (even in spite of the low ratings).

The place was emptied when I first arrived, but after the lady greeted me the phone calls started coming in for delivery orders, which was fine since I was still looking over their menu.  I decided to order the 18"" Flamingo Deluxe pizza since it will use up the full value of the Groupon plus another $4.  

The pizza is the thinner crusted variety. The dough is made fresh, not the best I have ever had, but also not oily like Pizza Hut's pizzas. The toppings used are also fresh, just seemed a bit light compared to other photos uploaded on their Yelp page.  

If you plan to have pizzas made at Flamingo Pizza, I recommend having it on premise. Nothing beats freshly baked pizzas just a minute or two after coming out of the oven.  It is still good after you personally take it home, leaving the takeout box not completely closed, since I can see it gets soggy if the trip home takes more than 20-30 minutes (one of the main complaints of delivery orders that takes over an hour).

So if you work or live in the vicinity of Las Vegas's Chinatown Plaza and bored of the many good Chinese, some Japanese and Korean and even Thai restaurants menu offerings, maybe pizza or calzones within walking distance will the perfect cure.  

They open really late, 4am most nights and 5am on weekends. Viable option for those late night pizza cravings when your freezer is out of stock of Red Barron's frozen pizza pie.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,7,3,AOxTESTztHbyILAshPwMcA
