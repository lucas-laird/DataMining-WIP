It gets very busy but worth the wait.  The price of the combos are also very reasonable.",TuP8ovZUL3kXtJnE2B71bA,1,0,4,tMPFQZEADs1YoLoL7auVCw

Price was right and I even had enough food to share. People beg when they smell good food!",mMdQvwWGrNeqPs3xARHezQ,3,2,5,Dv9kd3Oe-nvTQ57nEYAWjQ

Yes it's not in the best area but in Las Vegas what is a good neighborhood. I walked in on a Saturday and the place was packed. It  and  menu is full of traditional Southern Foods, Fried Chicken, Catfish, Bar b Que and other items that they will cook to order-can you imagine some fancy strip or downtown restaurant doing that?",RQeZciALMVyTXbaLp4Jh3g,4,3,5,V-6MUCnT7bygbtQ_v3cxUg
