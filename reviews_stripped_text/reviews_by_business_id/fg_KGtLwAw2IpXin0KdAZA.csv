At times it can seem a little ghetto but you have to take the location in consideration.  Staff is always friendly and it appears to be clean all the time I go in there.  No complaints from me.  I just get my meal and keep it moving",_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,4,4,4,6WWWepSg-bnhZjg-WDAbqw

This place is really ghetto, and there's always a bunch of annoying kids loitering and taking up the available tables.  I guess it's OK if you want to grab a soda on a hot day or a snack to munch on while walking around, but again, it's not very good... for your health or for taste.  I say, exert some self-discipline, buy something worthwhile in Walmart's grocery section, then go home and prepare something worth eating.",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,0,0,1,smfb9yM1YG5n56Fwbz7BRg

It's not like this is a odd order since we have ordered it several times , and 9 out of 10 times they look at us like we have 3 heads or something. If you can't understand what we are saying then keep your butt off the register. I am so sick of this . Going to keep complaining until someone with a brain learns how to take orders correctly.",cMTyN2F2zm3jAflW12Wiig,0,1,2,jD7UwO9UjNbLtMyxwmmGeA
5780991,2011-03-14,0,fg_KGtLwAw2IpXin0KdAZA,I went to get some food for my wife and I at 11pm. This place is in a hotel so you think they would have staffing. Nope! They had 2 people working and were running out of food as they were taking orders. No planning ahead here. There were almost 20 people in line and took over half an hour to get my food. It was ridiculous.,dQN6blWCKaxIvVE9Lha0vw,0,0,1,iYPnHo2Ev16iz02e2l1Q8g

But they have made several changes to their staff and thank God. It makes a world of a difference when you have customer service oriented employees. 

Some days it is still crowded and the service should be a little faster. It is FAST food. However, there have been several improvements and we have little to no problems now.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,9,7,3,Hdd0RrB_KgWGuqo7qX98rQ
