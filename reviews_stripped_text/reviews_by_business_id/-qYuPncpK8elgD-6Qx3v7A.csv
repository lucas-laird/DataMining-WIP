One of the most trendy, delicious, down to earth, unique restaurants in the Downtown area. Right when we walked in we were given a warming welcome! Even after we moved tables 3 different times to find good lighting for pictures, they continued to ask if they could do anything to help! 

We finalized our seat at the bar! We had spectacular service from the bartender (his names Jose, and he deserves his own rating! I give him a 5/5)! He helped point out the proper direction to go with our entrees and recommended great drinks!

I have been here for lunch and dinner. I really enjoy lunch here and they have great chicken lunch plates. My favorite is the half hanoi chicken with rice. The plate comes with specialty sauces. I always ask for sriracha sauce on the side and that helps kick things up a bit.

The location is easy. I don't like to spend a lot of time downtown, but since the restaurant is at The Ogden, it's an easy exit from the 95.

We sat at the bar and then later at a table. We were the only people at a table for awhile, yet our wine and food took a super long time to come out. Our waiter and the bartender were competent and friendly enough, but both had this weird kind of vibe like they thought they were super cool, like being a little mean was endearing. It wasn't. 

The worst part of the experience was that they brought the bill over to be paid on an ipad and the waiter just stood there holding it. We were two couples, and hadn't figured out beforehand if this was a split the bill or someone just getting the whole thing kind of night. We also didn't have a chance to review it to make sure everything was correct. I asked if he could leave it with us to review and he made a comment like, ""wouldn't you like that,"" as if some POS iPad was a big prize we were itching to sneak out in our pockets. I asked for a printed version of the bill and he haughtily replied that we'd get one after we paid the bill. I found it obnoxious. 

If they fix the service snafu's and general attitude, this could be a fantastic place. But for now, take out is the way to go.",WBn3bJsv9nuTMIR6LiYb4Q,2,0,4,FXApbV6x13SQGZ_w3qfSBQ

1666426,2018-01-11,1,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"This place was such a disappointment! My husband and I had a list of restaurants to hit while in Vegas, and this was at the very top. Our experience was a dumpster fire at best.

We waited 10 minutes without anyone coming to our table (there were literally only two tables sat in the place), so I finally flagged a busser down and asked if he could have the server, who I can see rolling silverware 5 feet away, come by. A few minutes later we are finally greeted by our server who says ""Do you guys know what you want to order?"" No mention of cocktails, no menu tour, nothing. The whole reason we came was to order the ""Son-in-law Deviled Eggs,"" so we ordered those to start. I kid you not, TWENTY MINUTES later the server shuffled over to tell us they were out of eggs. How is it possible in a restaurant with two tables that it took that long to tell us they have no eggs? By this point we had been seated for over 30 minutes and still had no cocktails or food. 

I was genuinely ready to leave at this point, but we were starving and decided to stick it out. Here's what we ordered:

Milk Tea Cocktail- interesting flavors and great presentation. Only con was the paper straw that gets soggy and gross as you drink.

Kaya Toast + Foie Gras ($20): the brioche was burnt to a crisp on the first piece that came out, so we had to reorder a new one. The egg on the second one was completely cooked through. It has the potential to be a great dish, but they just couldn't execute. 

Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice ($15): I don't get the hype. Cold chicken with white rice and dipping sauces. 

While waiting for our food, we heard the only other table in the restaurant send back all of their food for not coming out correctly, so it wasn't just us that had a rough meal. The server offered 10% off at the end, but I would've rather saved the $4 and had the experience we had hoped for. A waste of a meal in a city with a million amazing restaurants.",yTSqig9_dK80tzjgeWW08Q,7,0,2,udyYaiVsEO8pj0P5FeTG0w
1694619,2018-02-08,2,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"My party last week was told to wait at opening because, ""we aren't set up yet."" When seated, my eyes fell upon the dirty spoon, pictured. And the most flavorful item of our two plates this visit was the rice. 
That's hardly a ringing endorsement in light of all the other glowing reviews. 

The above spoon encounter was my first impression before even ordering, including that our waiter didn't know what the daily specials were (i.e., vegetables). Isn't this what you do when you come into work: find out what the specials are, and know what's in stock and not? To the spoon, when you're sitting their folding that utensil/napkin/plate display, don't you notice that there's cleaning residue on the reflective face? It was the FIRST thing I saw, before my cheeks even hit the seat. 

Second-most flavorful was the side of Chinese sausage, but that's a compliment to the fabricator, not the chef, unless they're making their own sausage in-house. If that's the case, bravo.  

Finally, they use a tablet to deliver your bill, and to receive your gratuity and signature. This would be acceptable if the tablet was left at your table, but it's presented to you by waitstaff--as if it were a bottle of wine whose label you were checking--so that you can make your tip selection. For all to see. 
No discreetness available. 
No ""take your time,"" thank you, and appreciation for coming. In fact, we were asked if we were going to stay awhile longer to hang out, though there were plenty of empty tables and no line of customers flocking.

It's a social-pressure game, and I don't like it. 

Kudos to the food runner, however, who was sociable, affable, and who noticed I left my computer bag before I'd walked out the door. Dude's got attention to detail and to people's customer experience.

So all in all, and price-point aside, the quality was lackluster. I have had better. But throw in the pricing of these plates, and the sad state of service and basic silverware presentation?  I have no interest in returning.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,11,1,2,G5trKhkwKoxXvWmoIDZGsw
1749092,2018-03-07,0,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"Mixed reviews with this place.   The food was good.   The service was good.  The prices were high for what you got, I had read reviews that even with a limited menu they are always out of menu items and yes, they were out of the fries.  Fries.  And with a limited menu that threw off my order.  I was going to order the wings and fries as my entree and the husband ordering the Hainon chicken number one.  

As for the house specialty, while the waiter did say the chicken would be served room temperature, it was served cold and that made the blandness stand out even more.  Otherwise, the meal was good, but still felt something was missing.  My husband ended up ordering a side of the veggies after seeing another customers even though he ordered the one hour egg and sausage as recommended.  

My wings were very tasty, but I had to add a cup of the egg soup for $6 to make a meal.   And we both went home feeling we did not have a complete meal and were hungry an hour later.  

My husband did rave about the hot tea and again, the service was excellent and the management greeted us throughout.  

Not a fan of the swiping my credit card into an iPad. Pet peeve that will also make me uncomfortable and not enjoy my experience.",WIu4IqktLQ6Qm46L5r5Baw,0,0,3,bzYHuFTxk-w46Ur6KQv0TA
1772319,2018-06-04,1,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"We often have to look for a place to grab a bite before going to the Smith Center on a Sunday night. We never want anything too fancy since the meal is not our evenings entertainment. But we want good food, an interesting menu, and attentive service. Flock &  Fowl had it all. Stephanie, our server, was at our table shortly after we sat down to get our drink orders. I was disappointed that they have no draft beers. And the beer I ordered, 21st amendment IPA, only came in a can. I was pleasantly surprised that the beer was actually good and was a nice start to the meal.  We tried the chicken wings, hummus, and baos for our app (you get a free bao with your yelp check-in). The wings came with two dipping sauces, spicy and sweet. I would recommend getting one of each because both were quite good (and spicy was not too spicy for a gringo pallet). The bao was good. It would've been even better if it came with a sweet sauce or something else to moisten it a bit. The hummus was just OK. As an entrée we got the roasted chicken ($15). That was really outstanding. We got sausage and veggies has the side dishes. I like both a lot. We definitely will be coming back.

1781275,2018-05-04,8,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"F&F Sahara and F&F DTLV are distinctly different- I find that I prefer the other location and am anxiously awaiting it's reopening. I've been to this location a couple of times and I'm happy to have it available and it's been great to try an expanded menu of dishes, but the quality of food and service have not been on par with the original. 

FOOD PROS: First timers definitely have to get the classic Hainese chicken and rice. That glutenous rice is one of my favorite things in life, it is so flavorful. Add on the Chinese sausage. Most recently, the bang bang noodles were a hit dish recommended by our server- would totally get these again! I love khao soi and the chicken laksa is a similar dish that was decent but not excellent, great for cooler days. 

FOOD CONS: Menu was recently changed up, so the son in law eggs I wanted to get are gone and they added a ""black garlic hummus"" that didn't really work with a strange texture but great scallion pancakes. The chicken wings were disappointing for a place named for their chicken- bland in flavor, thick batter, sauces just okay.  Dessert offerings have been expanded but remain underwhelming- overly sweet skillet cookie, average cheesecake, not their forte so get an extra app instead. 

SERVICE/LOCATION: Hit or miss across the board. Twice we started with a great server and were later passed off to someone else who was less competent. First visit, no one knew what the daily vegetable was, then what we were served wasn't what we were told, and it was never addressed. However, most recently, Gino was great with a friendly attitude and several suggestions. Payment is by ipad, with someone watching you like a hawk as you key in the tip. Expect paid parking. Focus of menu and service on most recent visit seems to be on bar and I'm not a drinker so maybe I'm just not the target audience?

I'm more likely to return to the Sahara location over this one but am optimistic that things may improve, especially given their seasonal menu changes and a rumor that bao will be back soon. When the food is great, it's exceptional, but the expanded menu has too many misses for me.

at the sahara location, my hubby and i walked in and we were the only ones there.  being our first time, we ordered everything on the menu which at the time was only 5 items.  shortly after we placed our order, a few more people came in the restaurant and ordered.  in about 10 mins, the small restaurant was full.  when the food started coming out of the kitchen, we noticed others receiving the food that we ordered.  after all of the other tables received food except for us, i brought it to the server's attention.  she said our food was coming out soon but i pointed out to her that all of our food did already come out and that she gave it to other tables.  she seemed appalled by what she had done so she went into the kitchen and we could hear her telling chef sheridan about it and then we heard them yelling at each other about it.  our food did eventually come out.  it was mildly tasty but nothing too exciting.  we also didn't receive any recompense for waiting almost 45 mins for our food except an honest apology.

recently, i went to the new flock & fowl with a friend.  she isn't big on hainan chicken so she decided to order the chicken sandwich.  however, on the website it states that the chicken is thigh meat but at the restaurant it doesn't specify.  so, we asked the server, and he also didn't know so had to go ask.  he was really nice but i have to say, when there are less than 10 items on the menu, i feel the servers should know the menu front and back without having to ask.  the food was less than average.  my hainan chicken was barely at room temp but the slaw was hot.  the mustard greens were definitely from a package.  the chicken in my dish and my friend's sandwich were both dry.  the fries were soggy.  

0 for 2 so i won't be returning.  which i'm sure is neither here nor there to this restaurant who gets more than enough free advertising from all of the instagrammers and yelpers who think this place is the best.  all i know is that you can't keep a business running if your clients are a small group of people.  you have to be able to cater to everyone and always serve the best food with the best service.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,6,2,2,JIVMJ29nYE-hhHdGA_clXQ

I started dinner off with a Le Grand, with vodka, honey, lime, Le Grand Courtage, and Australian bitters - so good!! 

We ordered some wings, edamame (loved the sweet chili on these!) and I went with the burger l for my entree. How good is a burger at a place known for chicken? Really, really good. The buns are made locally, just for F&F, and the texture is somewhere between brioche and bao. Soooo good! 

Chef sent out  a couple of desserts, their Kaya Toast, and one I hadn't had before - a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and miso caramel.

2334574,2018-01-25,0,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"I have traveled to Singapore many times and one of my must have dishes when I visit is chicken rice. A staple of Singaporean culture of poached chicken, flavorful rice, and your staple of 3 sauces: ginger & scallion, soy sauce blend, and chili sauce.

Obviously nothing can beat the authentic dish but born and raised in LA, I understand how close the dish can come to the original. Now that I have been living in Vegas for the past few years and after trying out a variety of places that offer hainan chicken (most of them are located in Chinatown), I  now know who sets the bar and it is Flock & Fowl.

This is their second location which is much bigger to cater to the very high demand they have. The space is more than twice the original location in the Ogden near Fremont.

When you first walk in, you would notice that this is a cashless restaurant. Credit card payments accepted only. First of its kind that I've seen in Vegas which I am all for.

The servers are the same friendly faces from the first location. They are having all their staff working in their second location to ensure everything is running well while the first location on Sahara is closed for a short while. 

I always recommend the #1 Poached Chicken with an 1 hour egg (aka onsen tamago), and you can't go wrong with the Chinese sausage or the broth. Their chicken is organic which is a must for this dish. The laksa is another Singaporean dish with a broth that consists of coconut milk/curry base and rice noodle. Something great if you want to try something different. Very hard to find this dish in Vegas.

You will have to pay for street parking at $2 an hour if you park right in front the restaurant. Definitely one of the must try hidden restaurants in Las Vegas.",96PVE3aTDezLjpUaArSzRg,0,0,5,dvU7c8ZCon56sxYKWBeB2w

To get to the restaurant, you park downtown (near Fremont) which is great because after dinner you can work off dessert by walking around and people watching! There are multiple pay-to-park lots and we had no trouble finding parking. 

We were seated at our reserved table right away for our 6pm reservation. The restaurant wasn't terribly busy at all at that time, but more people arrived as the night progressed. Our great waiter, Larry, acquainted us with the menu and gave us some suggestions after we had asked. We ordered wings with angry sauce and honey butter, the #1 with a fried egg and Chinese sausage, and the laksa. The wings were perfectly cooked and had exactly the right amount of sauce; not too dry at all! When ordering, Larry warned that our poached chicken would arrive room temperature, so we were not surprised when it was. I understand how some people may find the temperature off-putting, but it was delicious. We especially enjoyed the rice + egg and although I had never had Chinese sausage before it was my favorite component of the dish! The laksa had full flavor and I loved the thickness of the broth/base- each part of that dish was cooked well, too. I had never tried laksa before, but I'm a fan now! Finally, to end our evening, we enjoyed the cookie. What can I say about a fresh, warm cookie that would surprise you? It was delicious and comforting; we loved it. 

On an unrelated note, it's 2018 and I'm not 80 years old. I find it laughable that people complained in their reviews that they had to pay via iPad; I'd rather pay immediately and not have to wait for the server to perform the rigmarole of dropping off the bill, collecting it, and returning my card/change.

Urban chic design and hip-hop soundtrack lends itself well to an informal experience but simultaneously the high level of organization, exceptional attention to steps of service and cleanliness speak to a high level of training and awareness. 
Highlights were of course the chicken & rice, we tried the poached version (impeccable) with sides of Chinese sausage and roasted vegetables. 
The market salad featured 4 types of pickled and fresh fruits and vegetables over mixture of different greens, definitely a great item for a lite lunch. 
Quinoa & broccoli with tofu and sesame dressing was lite and fluffy, barely seasoned it really speaks to the texture of the ingredients. 
But the show stopper is the Laksa, lite coconut and curry noodles with tofu and micro herbs comes together in a synergy not frequently found. There is a shuttle ethereal sweetness that permeates and the texture of the broth coats the noodles just right. I'll be coming back again for this soon.

The restaurant is very hip. I liked the atmosphere right when I stepped in. The staff was friendly and greeted us right away. The restaurant isn't big at all maximum capacity is 79 people. It has a intimate dining setting which I enjoyed.

Our waiter was Troy and he was super duper nice! He provided excellent service and took the time to explain the dishes. He gave great recommendations on what to add to our dishes which made it amazing. 

The food was awesome! I had the Bacon Cheese burger and added egg as well as Foie Gras. The burger was cooked perfectly at medium rare! The patty was so juicy and soft omg it melted in my mouth. Egg and Foie Gras was recommended by our waiter Troy and that's the only way I think you should order this burger. Pop that egg and smear that Foie Gras and it was to die for! We also tried appetizers such as their crispy chicken wings, flock frites which is their version of curly fries, and the son in law which is deviled eggs in a Tamarind sauce. All tasted great. 

Only thing I was disappointed at was that their sodas was in cans. No bottomless drinks there which is a bummer since you pay such a high price for a can soda. 

We were too full to try any desert but maybe next time we will save some space for it.

First my husband came in last week and he had the chicken and rice, he said it was good not great and the portions small, the broth was cold. We go to Singapore every year and we've eaten plenty of laksa, chicken and rice from all the Hawker Stalls to the fancy restaurants in SNG, I think we can compare. So the day my husband went in, maybe that was just a one off. So we come back again and I ordered Laksa and he ordered egg drop soup bowl, easy stuff. We weren't too hungry lol.

When our food came out, the egg drop soup was cold and kind of bland but love the mushrooms there was plenty. My laksa came out pipping hot, very little broth which is odd and small portion. They did say I can ask for more noodles and broth but wasn't sure if that's extra plus I wasn't that hungry. Anyway, the laksa was salty, I really couldn't taste anything but salt not fish sauce salty but salt salty. It looked delicious though but I didn't eat it after three bites, I just couldn't. 

I've also noticed that they let the food sit on the counter for a while before they serve it. Counter meaning where the cooks put the plated food for the servers to take. Lol Granted there was only one server and a busser working but the kitchen looked confused as well. It was weird to watch them asking who's food goes to what table while one person is looking through all the receipts and then giving it to the chef to look as well. But maybe just maybe it's because they're still working out the kinks, I mean they just opened and I want them to keep the doors open. Service was good and very friendly.

The price is around 14.99 per combo with the chicken rice and 2 other sides.  The Vietnamese coffee is a bit of a miss cuz the way they make it. I guess it is because it was pre brewed and not enough condense milk. The waitress took the coffee charge of the bill once she learnt I was not exactly a big fan.

The Lychee's Knees is a great cocktail. It's very well-crafted. One of those types of cocktails where you can kind of taste the alcohol but not really, and after you have 2, you feel like you've had 4!

I also had a cocktail that had tajin in it that was fabulous. Good choice for anyone who likes a little heat/spiciness in their drink.

Hainan Chicken Rice, great of course! I will admit that I like the chicken rice from the original location a bit more, but they had that process down there like a well-oiled machine. I expect the same from the DTLV location in the months to come. Can't get enough of their house-made ginger scallion and sambal.

Laksa: love the texture of the noodles and the broth is so hearty and flavorful! The prawn is huge and super juicy. Highly recommend this dish.

Shrimp rolls: delicious and so crunchy! Be careful, these come out HOT!

Kaya Toast: so great with the egg on top! They were out of foie gras when I went so I'll have to come back and try it with that.

The atmosphere is very...downtown-y if you know what I mean. It takes a little away from the authenticity but the food more than makes up for it. We ordered the Son in Law Deviled Eggs to start. The combo of flavors on this was incredible. They were very lightly fried and the outsides become sort of tough and rubbery which is a nice contrast to the soft insides. I wish there was just a liiitle bit more of the tamarind glaze because the eggs are a little dry without it but no matter. This is a must order for sure. 

For the main course I got the Hainanese Chicken poached of course with sides of daily veggies (edamame and daikon that day) and chicken bone broth. The chicken was incredibly juicy and well flavored even though you can't see any seasoning. My favorite of the dipping sauces was actually the soy. It went really well with the rice. I also loved the pickled vegetables (takana!) and would have glady had extra pickled instead of the vegetables. I enjoyed the chicken bone broth, it was nice to sip on between bites. This meal felt really clean and healthy and I would definitely come back and get the exact same thing again. My boyfriend ordered the laksa, which the waiter described as a ""ramen"" but I think that's a little deceiving. The noodles are more like a thinner udon in a curry broth that's dangerously yellow and easy to splatter on your clothes. The tofu in it was so so good though, soft and silky inside and chewy on the outside. My boyfriend wasn't very full afterwards though so maybe order something else if you're super hungry. 

My only requests for Flock and Fowl are in the utensil/dishware department. We tried to get chopsticks with our meal and they said they ran out. I also think knives could be useful, since even though the chicken was pre sliced, some of the slices I didn't want to eat in one bite. Lastly, the dish the Hainanese Chicken is served on rotates about the middle and proves a bit difficult when you're trying to dip your chicken in the sauces. Other than these minor details the meal was fabulous and it was fun dining downtown. I've been thinking about that chicken for two days now so yeah...

The chicken is organic and free range, and it is ridiculously soft and tender. The chicken fat rice is so flavorful, and the dipping sauces are the game changers, especially their house made chili sauce. I also got the Chinese sausage as one of my sides, and it complemented this dish very well. 

Another one of Chef Sheridan's dishes you do not wanna miss out on is the Kaya Toast with foie gras. Served on a brioche toast which is made locally, it is topped with seared foie gras, a fried egg, and coconut egg jam. The dish is also decorated with their house sweet soy glaze and flowers, and it's just so pretty to look at! One bite of this, and I was in a state of pure bliss. So good! 

The chicken wings (humongous) with honey butter and angry sauce were also really good, very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The angry sauce reminded me of Korean chicken wings with a gochujang glaze. The Son-In-Law Deviled eggs with the tamarind glaze was bomb as well!

Service was amazing! The entire staff is so friendly and attentive. They also have a full bar now and are open for dinner.

3332802,2018-03-13,0,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Food was very good.  Have never had a good hainan chicken in Vegas besides the original Flock and Fowl.  Their new location may top that, making it more of an entree rather than a small lunch portion.  The hainan came with a seasonal veggie, fried egg on the rice, and a few dipping sauces.  The chili was probably the standout, but none of the sauces were must have.  We also had the laksa which was really a phenomenal dish. Everything about it was good.  Hearty portion, full prawn, thick noodles, interesting sweet flavor, and perfectly cooked chicken.  Finally, we had a few wings that we ordered extra extra spicy.  This was my one complaint as far as food went during our visit.  We ordered extra spicy for the laksa snd the wings and were left pretty unimpressed.  The wings tasted like sriracha and the laksa didn't have any extra spice.  Flock and Fowl has the food, but don't expect to sweat. 
 This place has an interesting cocktail menu and about 10 beers. Seemed like a full bar as well with a few wine options.  Prices are typical of the area with all around $8-11. 

Service was al over the place.  We had at least 4 servers total and they had no idea what was going on from the dishes on the menu, to what the restaurant specialized in, to the drinks behind the bar.  We ordered chicken wings to come out first as an appetizer and inevitably they came out last.  We ordered extra spicy and they at first came out half soy glaze half spicy, having to return and recook them.  After the hectic meal where we waited for 3/4 of the meal before eating, we ended up being comped a cheesecake that we didn't want.  Nice that they want to make it up, but erasing an appetizer price is a much easier and better gesture for us.  

In all, Flock and Fowl is a mainstay and great destination for food in Vegas.  Good for a dinner before Fremont, but service could use an upgrade.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,O6xP-0ioJOqMY-YBSrLCog

We also ordered the Chicken Wings (Angry Sauce and Honey Butter) and  Son In Law Eggs to share with the table. For the wings, I like the flavor of both sauces but if I had to choose, I would choose the honey butter. The crispy skin was awesome and the chicken was still juicy. The presentation was also clean and simple. The Son In Law Eggs were disappointed. It expected the shell to be crispier with maybe some type of panko breading and the flavor to be stronger but the eggs just tasted like eggs and it tasted like the sauces were non-existent. Finally the Hainan Chicken Rice. First, it took over an hour to get the chicken rice. We assumed the kitchen was just giving us time to finish up our apps before bringing us our entrees but we were well done with our apps and our entrees were nowhere to be seen until we asked the waiter to check on it. Once we got them, the sides that I have chosen were not given. He was willing to switch it up for me though. As for the taste, the chicken and rice were both decent but nothing to rave about. The sauces were also ok but they felt one dimensional. The sides were strange in IMO. The daily veg was corn in what tasted like a smashed black bean sauce. The one hour egg was OK and the Chinese Sausage was probably one of the worst Chinese sausages I have ever had. In addition to all of this, the entire dish was lukewarm at best. For something like this, the dish should come out piping hot. Overall, I was once again let down by Flock & Fowl.

Everything was great! Everything!

I got the check in special of fried chicken bao. It was delicious! Perfectly fried, soy sauce and sprouts in the bun, really good.

I got the Hainenese chicken special, cooked traditionally, and my partner got it with the roasted chicken. It comes with two sides. I chose the Chinese sausage (I *love* Chinese sausages!) and the bone broth. I mixed it all together, and it brought me back to my Vietnamese mom's chicken soup. Real comfort food. However, my partner's roasted chicken might have been the taste winner. Very flavorful. He also had the vegetables which he said were very good with the rice and chicken.

We didn't really have room for dessert but were offered a piece of ricotta toast. I don't even know how to explain it. It's not something you bite into and think, ""deelicious!""; It's an experience. It has the non-flavor of bread and ricotta but then a sweet; but now savory; but that sweet bit again; but now some salty in that part of my mouth! If you like interesting food, absolutely do not pass this up if offered! 

I'm terrible with names, as you may know, so I missed our server's name, though I know she told us. She is very new to the restaurant and the city, but she was so sweet and attentive, and I think besides her just being that way it also has to do with the work environment, which brings me to Jenny. As soon as we sat down, I noticed her seeming to have her kitchen on lockdown, excellent communication with everyone, including us regarding when our for would be out.

It just seems there is a lot of respect between everyone and her command of her environment is such that if she would have handed me a bin and told me to bus a table, I totally would have  I had asked the server about someone who I thought worked there, and Jenny had come over to chat (kindly) about him.

From worst to best, the deviled eggs were just ok. I liked the texture contrast with the fried outer coating, toasted puffs and fried shallots. The flavor was just okay, however and nothing I would crave again.

The kaya toast was very good with just the right balance of sweet and salty. The brioche toast was interesting but I missed the crispy contrast of a more toasted bread.

I REALLY enjoyed their egg drop soup. The broth had a complex flavor and I liked the mushroom in it.

Of course the star was the hainan chicken. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the rice had a ton of flavor. It comes with 3 dipping sauces, a ginger scallion, chili sauce, and soy sauce. The soy sauce was too salty and the green sauce had an after taste which I did not like. I liked their chili sauce but not enough to buy it (they sell it separately). The egg was awesome and added a silky texture to the rice.

Also, I should note their excellent tea selection (I recommend their smoky black tea) and a great cocktail selection (although I just had their yuzu beer - which was refreshing).

Tingling peanuts: these are great, no complaints.

Kaya toast: egg was slightly under cooked, the soy sauce balanced out the sweetness nicely. It lacked something, couldn't put my finger on it.

Deviled eggs: these are awful. the textures combined ... not good. There's a hard to chew fried skin on the outside of the egg... meh. It was a boiled egg cut in half with some stuff sprinkled on it. This shouldn't be called a deviled egg. Honestly the worst thing we had. 

Chicken rice: this was tasty, I don't really understand the choice for the chicken and the rice to be room temperature, but that didn't take much from the dish. The egg served with it was nice and the chicken broth honestly ended up being the highlight. 

Laksa: not enough salt and not enough acid. I'd call this dish mediocre at best. It was acceptable but just nothing special about it.

Overall this was a pretty disappointing experience, I probably won't return here. The service was prompt and friendly but the food.. so bland.",LyY_x_w1SLCyI0dTyX9ATg,0,0,3,uXt__QNzlWKAEheH7jvf8w

When I saw the menu I was a bit hesitant since there didn't seem to be a lot of options and I thought the plates would be small but no ...the small plates were shareable and the meal in itself was delicious.  The drinks were strong and delicious given that we tried a few different cocktails and the price was just right.  

The restaurant itself was open and cozy and where we were seated we could see into the semi open kitchen.  We had gone in on a rainy day so there was not a lot of dinner traffic so our server had time and was very attentive - making sure he offered a drink as we got to the last sip, replenishing water and just appearing like a magician.  

For the food we tried a few things at the table but I shared the Flock Frites ..yummy!  They were crispy and soft and just delicious.  The chicken wings were next and they were perfectly done and delicious.  One of my absolute favorites was the Kaya Toast and we did add foie gras to that.  The foie was a healthy portion and we gobbled up that toast as soon as it hit the table.  We finished our appetizers off with the son in law deviled eggs.  I loved this as much as I enjoyed the toast because why not a fried deviled egg with peanut sauce.  

For my main I really wanted the sea bass but they had sold all that out during their lunch rush so I settled for the signature hainanese chicken with a side of the chicken bone broth and root vegetables.  I'd say the bone broth was one of my favorite items on the plate and I could have been satisfied with a full bowl of that and some of the toast.  The chicken was good and nothing to complain about but I was still thinking of the bass.  The root vegetable I ate but I'm not generally a fan of some of the vegetables so I'd say in my entire meal that's the only thing I didn't like because of my own personal preferences.

My friend and I were excited to come try out this restaurant, the menu looked great. We ordered and waited, and waited and waited and waited. Almost an hour had gone by and we hadn't even gotten our food. The table who sat after us with 3 more people had food before us. I didn't understand because it was a quiet and empty Sunday evening at the restaurant. 

I looked up and saw my food sitting waiting to be served for about 20 min. I guess they were waiting for my friends dish to be ready so they could bring it out at the same time. But when his dish was finally ready and they brought our food out, it was stone cold. I've never ever had to return something for being cold before. I called the waitress over and before I even opened my mouth to tell her if she could return because it was cold she already knew why, she said ""cold? Yea they don't have their timing down."" If she knew why didn't she ask them to make it again before serving me cold food? By the time I got my food back my friend was done with his and I was light headed from being so hungry. I was ready to eat just about anything that was put in front of me. So I got my food and thank goodness it was actually hot but the downside was that it was sooooooo salty I could barely swallow. I'm not picky at all but it really felt like they way over salted it, maybe because they were in a rush from having to redo my dish? Who knows.

Looking for dinner after a show in Las Vegas can be stressful. Luckily, we got a list of food places to go to from our friends, Mel and Terri!

Flock and Fowl is located in Downtown Las Vegas.  We got free street parking right in the front because it was so late - about 10pm.  The crowd had already come and gone, so we were seated immediately. 

Imortant Tip: get the Son-in-law eggs!  Even though it had a small dollop of spicy sauce on the top, the lightly breaded egg was perfectly prepared to encompass a mouthful of brilliant textures!  Delicious!

I went to the kitchen prep area to read my menu  because the light was better.  The chef asked if I needed help and recommended the Bacon Cheeseburger... so I got it... nom nom!  The handmade, thick, patty was very filling and flavorful!  Before we left, Chef stopped by our table and chatted with us - nice touch!

Dear Daniel had their specialty... Hainan Chicken.  He enjoyed it!  Minky and I got a taste and agreed that the chicken was tender and moist.  The broth added good flavor to it! 

If you're looking for a new place to dine in Downtown Las Vegas, check this place out!  The ambiance is dark and classy.  The service is helpful and friendly!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,36,32,4,xyCrj5tGS9QoHLQ72-LM5A

The hainanese chicken was good. I like that the chicken isn't ""hard poached"", they get it just a wee bit under so the chicken is juicier. It comes with three sauces, a chili sambal, soy sauce and a green onion ginger sauce that's commonly served with cold ginger chicken. The dish comes with two sides - I picked Chinese sausage (lup cheong, a slightly sweet, dried sausage that has bits of fat in it) and chicken broth. The broth was too salty and it hadn't been properly skimmed. Next time, I'll go for the 1 hr egg. Oh, but the rice that was served with the hainanese chicken was delicious!!! I would say it was the star of the plate! It's one of the best chicken rice I've had!

If you aren't blessed with an Asian cooking mama, Flock & Fowl is your best bet. Vegas is lucky to have a restaurant that serves this simple dish well. 

The flock frites were some of the best curly fries I've had, and I've lived decades eating curly fries. That fry sauce served with it is addictive. 

The service, from the hostess to the waiter, were welcoming, friendly and kind. They made the experience all the more enjoyable. The restaurant itself is nice, decked out with sleek black walls.

We ordered the following dishes with their menu descriptions:

Kaya toast--SE Asian coconut egg jam, brioche, fried egg, house sweet soy
Flock frites--curly fries, parmesan, Flock Sauce, herbs
Quinoa salad with fried cauliflower (added Chinese sausage)--almonds, crispy tofu, sesame vinaigrette
Fried chicken bao--steamed bun slider with chicken
Buttermilk fried chicken Benedict--poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce
Cast iron chocolate chip cookie--freshly baked, vanilla ice cream, miso caramel sauce

If you go here for brunch, you must try the fried chicken Benedict.  Perfectly cooked poached eggs with excellent Hollandaise.  Another complete winner is the Flock frites.  The sauce is very good and the fries are addictive.  Take a friend or two with you because the serving is very large.  

The sesame vinaigrette on the quinoa salad was perfect.  The light flavoring allowed the flavors of the quinoa, tofu, and sausage to shine.

For dessert, the cast iron chocolate chip cookie is a great choice.  The pan was almost clean when we were done!

The only downside can be parking.  There is plenty there but you have to pay unless you park away and walk.  That's not the fault of Flock & Fowl but the city getting parking revenue from the growing DTLV scene.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,10,4,mlBq6LN8UlSo12nZ05rwUg

How do I even think about giving Flock & Fowl DTLV less than 5 Stars?  First of all, Jenny Wong and Chef Su are the best.  Second, the Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice is awesome.  And third, this new location is open later and a lot more spacious. 

I grew up eating Hainanese chicken and white rice.  I have also tried Hainanese Chicken at other establishments across the West Coast.  Bar none, Flock & Fowl is the best.  I love my pops aka Mel C Sr.  But sorry dad, Flock & Fowl's Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice is second to none. I think that the secret to this dish is the chicken fat rice.  Maybe it's the free-range chicken?  Or, is it the organic fried egg?  Actually, I don't know what the secret is, and it really doesn't matter at this point.  I'll continue to get this dish no matter what.  I prefer the Signature with the Chinese sausage and the perfectly round organic fried egg every single time.  I'll take the entire dish, scramble it together, and deMELish it.  Every bite is heaven.  This dish is perfection and if you have never tried it before, then you're missing out.  By the way, how the heck does Flock & Fowl always serve a perfectly round and photogenic fried egg every single time?  The rest of the menu is the same as the original location, but with a few creative and unique items added. Alcohol is also served at this location.  I am a huge fan of the original location, but will start going to this location more often.  The new location is a lot larger, is open at night (when the cravings hit), and is only 15 minutes from my house.  It's a no brainer.  Flock & Fowl DTLV will be seeing me A LOT.

*Son-in-Law Deviled Eggs
*Egg Drop Soup
*Honey Butter Chicken Wings
*Flock on Flock Chicken Sando.  I need to try the burger soon.

Hainan Chicken Rice

Precaution: this is going to be a major hit or miss as the whole restaurant concept is to push this one dish as THE main dish. Everything else is just a supporting side dish.

Classic Hainan gingery green-oniony chicken oil noise presentation. A saltiness with the creaminess of lean chicken oil in the rice. A rice is a tad salty for my palate. Delicately subtle and balance. No fishiness. Texture is plummy. Perfect. Not easy to get a chicken this level of delicacy in the US.

All of the nose and palate sensations are enforced with the minced ginger green-onion chicken-oil condiment. Pickled cucumber and mustard green needs to give a sourness counterbalance instead of just saltiness. Chili sauce has a garlicky sweet note and soy sauce gives saltiness compliment as needed.

Tip: eat with all 3 condiments together.

Ordered with
(Organic) over-easy egg and 1 hour egg. One hour egg is a poached-like steamed whole egg. A hint of salt and black pepper with a velvety texture. Beautiful!

Flock & Fowl's downtown Las Vegas location is the newest venture by Chef Sheridan Su and Jenny Wong, the power couple behind such successful business ventures as Fat Choy and the original location of Flock & Fowl. They've taken over a relatively cavernous space at the Ogden which was formerly inhabited by the not-so-interesting Itsy Bitsy Ramen & Whisky.

Parking isn't great unless you pay for it, wait until 10pm and get lucky enough to find a free spot on the street, or leave your car far enough away while walking away your calories in advance. But when you do get here, you can post up at the bar on the lower ""floor"" or get seated upstairs in the main section. I would've much preferred a well-lit spot at the counter, but my friends and I sat by the window. At night. With that unfortunate dim lighting favored by so many restaurants.

Thankfully, the food was awesome enough that I didn't have to worry about not seeing it vividly. We started off with a plate of 8 chicken wings ($11.99), which our server helpfully presented with a sampler of sauces on the side instead of coating said wings. This let me experience how awesome the wings were with only salt and pepper, and proper battering and frying. They're as good as any which I've had if not better.

Let's get to the sauces too. The honey butter was the only actual dressing listed on the menu, and it was underwhelming for me. The honey and butter both weren't that pronounced. The gochujang was the not-so-spicy base of the Angry Sauce and was about as good as you'll find, give or take lack of spiciness. The tamarind caramel, which I believe is the accompaniment of the Son in Law Deviled Eggs, was also very enjoyable, but I prefer the original Flock & Fowl's Thai Caramel.

Let's get to my main course though: the Laksa ($16.99). I saw it on Chef Sheridan's Instagram a couple of weeks ago and have been eager to try it ever since then, so this was truly the only entree option which I was ready to entertain. The soup is reasonably sized, more of a ramen than a pho. The curry broth was really amazing and not too spicy for me. Egg noodles and chicken soaked up that broth, and the poached egg enriched it. Pretty much everything was awesome except for the slightly empty shrimp head, which ended up being more troublesome due to dispersed hard shells and legs than it was worth the added flavor.

Couple notes on nibbles from my friends' plates: the vegetable hash, featuring tofu, corn, chili peppers, and some other bits, was a work of art in balance of flavors and textures. The fried chicken skins, topped with an aioli that perhaps had rosemary in it, were excellent, as I'd anticipated after trying the wings. The curly fries were fairly standard but had the right textures and seasoning, and the truffle aioli on the side of that was beautiful.

I mostly stuck to water because it was the end of the night, but I tried a bit of my friends' libations. The Mezcal Milk Tea was nice in theory but the oolong was overpowered by the Mezcal. As for the Hitachino Dai Dai, I haven't seen that brewery's products around town so I appreciated the effort by the restaurant to procure it. I did enjoy it as nice red ale, but I didn't understand at all why it was labeled an IPA. There wasn't much hoppiness in it.

Flock & Fowl has successfully made the leap to an awesome downtown Las Vegas space and revamped its menu enough to justify the new prices. I will definitely come back during the day for some better lighting and at night if I find myself in the area for other reasons again.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,6,5,0LyrjkD_NJcpINzdcKGrrw

It was a relaxed environment and we were quickly greeted by friendly staff members. This restaurant is paperless, so cash is not accepted. I ordered a coffee infused manhattan which I enjoyed. It was evenly mixed and the bourbon was delightful.

We decided to order an appetizer and went for the chicken wings. We decided on an eight piece and were able to try two flavors (honey butter and salt & pepper). The wings had delicious flavor and the skin was very crispy. Even the honey butter wings had a crispy skin with the sauce smothered on the outside. Honey butter was a sweet and spicy flavor, with just enough heat to know it was there. Not over bearing at all.

For entrees we selected the Laksa and the Hainanese Chicken rice. The chicken was fried and the sides were fried egg and market veggies. Food arrived quickly and was everything we had hoped for. It was my first time trying Laksa and the depth of flavor was amazing. Chicken and tofu went together nicely and had amazing flavor. The preparation of the tofu was so good that even the pickiest eater would enjoy it.

As for the Hainanese Chicken, it arrived with three distinct sauces on the side. Skin was crispy much like the wings from the appetizer. The rice stole the show on the plate. I'm not sure how the rice was prepared, but it is some of the best rice I have ever had. Vegetables were carrots and mixed greens. They complimented the dish well.

The dining experience was pleasant and the staff were attentive to customer needs. Again it is a paperless restaurant so no cash is accepted. I would recommend trying the chicken wings when dining here and the laksa.",YTBdDMZIHpqLsx2I5pgy_w,0,0,4,LiBNLIXkTHP7wt1_4k64LQ

4174316,2018-04-05,12,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"My continual quest to recreate some of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice dishes I had during my month long vacation in Asia in 2017, brought me to Flock & Fowl.  Every chicken and rice dish I had in Singapore (my all-time favorite), Thailand, Hong Kong, and Vietnam were fondly memorable, all with its own unique twists, representative of their countries of origin.  Unfortunately, Flock & Fowl came nowhere close to bringing back those fond sensories I long for.  

Interestingly, Flock & Fowl does attempt to create its own take on its signature Hainanese Chicken Rice ($14.99).  It's more of an nontraditional, but nouveau take on a traditional beloved Asian dish.  Everything is made in house, from the ginger and scallion sauce, the pickled vegetables, the chile sauce, and down to even the soy sauce.  However, maybe they should continue retooling these recipes a bit before actually serving them.  The ginger and scallion sauce, which is often made by home cooks, including myself, was downright bland.  Adding some sea salt and more scallions really would've given it the needed oomph. Conversely, their in-house made soy sauce had a distinct medicinal flavor, that reminded me of the potent Chinese herbal medicinal soups my Mom forced down my brother and I when we were little.  Any Chinese kid who has experienced this, knows that it's definitely not something you'd want to serve at a restaurant, unless you're trying to sway off customers from ever returning.  And why would you want to dip your perfectly poached Hainanese Chicken into something like that?  

Now, the all-white Hainanese chicken, served with skin on, was very nicely done.  Perfectly moist, though small in portion size, given the price.  No complaints here. I also liked the perfectly prepared one hour egg, made in the sous vide. 

The rice, which was made from the chicken schmaltz, also tasted bland, as did the watered down tasting bone broth.  Typically the broth that accompanies this dish is very flavorful, but again, maybe they need to go back to the drawing board on these two items as well.

Wasn't a fan of the ambiance so much.  The dining area was somewhat small and long.  It's perfectly fine for a simple lunch if you work downtown, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for dinner here. I came from Summerlin, and frankly, was disappointed I made the trip across town.

Oddly, they did something annoying that I've never seen at a restaurant before.  When you're seated, you can't help but to see a large bottle of Vero water placed on each of the tables.  They look appealing when you're thirsty, as they're in a nice frosty bottle, that look like they may already be chilled.  However, I was immediately asked upon being seated if I wanted regular tap water, or if I'd like to purchase the bottle for $4.00.  I passed on $4.00 for water, and the waitress quickly snatched up the bottle. **IMO, this was some strange greedy, passive aggressive ""sales technique"" contrived by the owners to accost an additional $4.00 or more from every table**! I have no problem at all with offering bottled water, as many restaurants commonly do, but I really don't care for that sort of annoying tacky approach of displaying your goods for sale, right on top the table!! 

Apparently, the chef here was a James Beard Award Semifinalist.  Note, not a winner but semifinalist.  Regardless, it says little about the final product served day in and day out.  Numerous low-keyed restaurants all over serve phenomenal food in great settings, but never get the recognition and awards because they aren't versed in pumping up the public relations (usually paid for), and playing the political games necessary to ""achieve"" these kinds of accolades.  

All that being said, if you're in downtown and craving Hainanese Chicken Rice, then this may be your only option.  Beggars can't be choosers. Personally, if given a choice, I'd opt instead for Spring Mountain any day, or somewhere in Chinatown, where the options are plentiful, much better tasting, authentic, and better priced.

Do yourself the flavor and when they recommend the chocolate chip cookie, get it put in ASAP. They bake them fresh on the spot in a mini cast iron skillet and it takes about 10 mins. There's ice cream, there's a miso caramel sauce. You won't regret it at all. There's actually no pic of it because we devoured it before I could even think to take one!

Signature Hainanese Chicken rice ($14.99) with the choice of two sides.
They use good quality chicken, the meat is dense and the skin is without excess fat. The rice is also perfectly cooked like they did pay attention to details. I have to say their flavor is like 95% similar to what I used to have daily in Thailand with much better quality. 

The choices of the sides:
1 hour egg (poached egg) is the way to go. 
Chinese sausage is a bit salty to my like but it's what it is. (I quit preserved food for a long tim). Daily vegetables (bowl of corn for that day, I don't like it much and didn't get the flavor either, I prefer just some simple freshly cooked vegetables instead).

Broccoli and Quinoa Salad $8.99
if you like broccoli and quinoa it's a perfect combination, flavorful but so light . The slightly crspy tofu is enjoyable. I can see myself eating this dish daily.

Farmer Market Salad
I got it complimentary from the chef, he told me all the ingredients were from downtwon farmer market, the vegetables taste wild with the amazing natural sweetness. I love this dish! 

Laksa (coconut curry noodle)$16.99
too salty for me and not the kind of noodle I was expecting even though menu said egg noodle (also too soggy ). 

Son in Law Deviled Eggs $8.99
I never had Devil's egg so I can't compare it with normal version. The flavor is too mixed to me which I prefer food just to it's simplest taste at best. Well prepared though. 

Cookie A La Mode $7
if you like American kind sweetness, the flavor is actually rich with the crunch texture around the hot cast iron. Too sweet for me and it's also too much for just one person to consume. 

They got quite busy during lunch hours but slow during the dinner hours. I'd really enjoy the quiet evening there with my favorite food. This place now ranked #1 as my favorite restaurant in DTLV.",w9OZUPIoweoUYVbl1RwCMQ,44,45,4,JA6yxhlaL0P59QYpAu-RGw

So, unfortunately, I expect a lot from a chicken place. It's hard to compete with Mom's chicken. Flock & Fowl just knocks it out of the park in that regard. 

Whenever I'm here, I feel like I'm getting a home-cooked meal by Mom, if Mom also just won MasterChef America. It's comfort food, but it's creative and thoughtful, too. It's awesome seeing my favorite foods from childhood get some elevated treatment like this. 
 
Hainan Chicken Rice: Light, simple, but soooo good. The chicken is moist and tender, but the secret here is the rice. Perfectly seasoned and super satisfying. I like the traditional style + egg on the side. Perfect for me, but maybe a little too light for some folks? If it sounds too light, I'd go with the roasted style chicken rice or... 

Chicken Wings (Salt & Pepper) and/or the Fried Chicken Skins: Salty, crunchy, and full of flavor. Hard to go wrong on these... soooo good.  

Any salad on the menu: You wouldn't expect a chicken place to have good salad, but they make seriously good salad. Perfectly balanced with just the right dressing and combination of ingredients. You can taste the quality of the ingredients here (and in all the dishes, really).

The bone soup tasted a little like packet ramen soup base. The veggie spring rolls were crispy but bland. I've had frozen ones that tasted better.
I had dried rice stuck to the bottom of my water glass. 
They have a spoon and fork on the table set but I think a knife and fork would be better to cut my chicken and help push my rice onto my fork.
The good:
The burger was delicious. The seasonal veggie side for the chicken was excellent. The server was nice. The fries were okay.  The sauces were excellent.

I travelled from Summerlin to eat here because I heard great things about the restaurant and the chef, but I was soooo disappointed overall. There is a new Hainan chicken place that just opened on Durango and I thought they were better.

I'm a yuge fan of the salt and pepper wings.  Yuge.  No matter what else is being ordered I always get an order of those wings.  The chicken rice is fantastic.  The flavor and texture on the rice is out of this world and the bone broth, the bone broth is sublime.  Extremely flavorful and creamy and everything you'd want in a broth.  Truly satisfying.

The Kaya toast is, with or without the foie, a real treat.  I'm not a big fan of sweet flavors, but the kaya toast has a savory element to it as well with the egg, soy and foie that works really well.  This is definitely a staple for me when I go in.

4918516,2018-02-17,1,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"Overall, a four-star restaurant in the aspects of food, service, and environment. 

I'm a huge fan of pork belly buns and hainan chicken rice. I was definitely grateful when chef Su opened up FatChoy five years ago and then followed by Flock and Fowl on Sahara. I think all three locations are all very unique and definitely worth local's attention. 

With the newest Flock and Fowl in Ogden under his portfolio, I'm intrigued to see what will be next. Flock and Fowl in downtown has more upscale and trendy vibes compared to the other two business. I was surprised to see how spacious it was compared to Flock and Fowl on Sahara. 

The service was decent during our visit. Nothing more or less to notate for. 

Onto the food items that we've tried. 

1. Son in law ""Deviled Eggs"" (5/5): not your traditional deviled eggs. They are much better! It was fried along with tamarind sauce and fried shallot. Definitely getting this again. 

2. Broccoli and Quinoa Salad (4/5): it was light and fresh. Not the best Quinoa I've had but I enjoyed it with fried tofu. 

3. Laksa noodle (3/5): I like lasksa curry a lot. You don't find this dish easily. I was excited to try chef Su's version. It wasn't what I was expected. The sauce for the noodle was great for maybe like dipping type of noodle instead of noodle soup. It was too thick to drink the broth. Also the tofu puffs was soaked in the soup too long that it did not even taste like fried tofu. 

4. Hainan Chicken Rice (5/5): I've been to several Hainan chicken places including Savoy and Nong's Khal Man Gao and some other places. Savoy and flock and fowl are still two of my favorites. They each have their own mastery on either sauce, rice or chicken. I'm glad this dish tasted the same as the one in Sahara location. You can taste the quality of their chicken. The only difference between two locations is that in DTLV location, the dish came with two sides and priced higher at $14.99. In Sahara location, you can just get naked Hainan chicken for $9.99 and add on additional sides for $1.99 each. It is essentially the same price but a dollar more than Sahara location. I think it is fairly priced considering the setup compared to Sahara. I also like the sauce even more now compared to when they first opened Sahara location. 

5. The cookie (1/5): I wouldn't order it again. It was overly sweet like I'm going to get a cavity after eating that lol. Didn't think dessert would be the focus here anyway. Hopefully they can design a more Asian fusion dessert menu in the future. 

In all, I highly suggest all locals to check out this place or the one on Sahara if you are a Hainan Chicken Rice fan. However, if you are one of those eaters who enjoy your free range chicken that runs 10 miles a day in results of tighten and tough breast, this is not the place for you. I enjoy my chicken on the tender side and Flocks and Fowl is perfect for me.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,2,2,4,EljUa_oOpomng7RLRsBdIw

Located in the old Itsy Bitsy Ramen space in the Ogden, the restaurant from a purely aesthetic feel seemed little changed from its previous tenant.  I liked Itsy Bitsy a lot, however, from a food and drink perspective, Flock and Fowl was definite step up for downtown.  

I started off with a cocktail while I looked over the menu.  I had a Notorious P.I.G. ($16) made with Whistle Pig 10-year Rye, barrel-aged maple syrup, lemon, and served up in a coupe rimmed with Applewood-smoked sea salt.  While it was on the pricey end of cocktails to be found downtown, it was clearly reflective of its choice of base spirit, Whistle Pig, and I felt still a reasonable value for what I received.  It was a very tasty cocktail.  For my food, I had their signature Hainanese Chicken Rice ($14.99).  It came with two sides.  Our personable server made the sage recommendation that I should go with the 1-hour egg and chicken bone broth.  He wasn't wrong.  The dish was simple in concept, hearty, generous portions, and delicious.  The slow-poached egg offered up a nice yolky goodness to the rice, which nicely complemented the moist, flavorful chicken.  Until I had Flock & Fowl's chicken bone broth, I never understood the whole bone broth trend, which seemed to just be bland, bone-infused water, devoid of any flavor.  Flock & Fowl's had flavor, actually tons of flavor, which was unmistakably chicken.  It was perfectly seasoned and surprisingly hearty even though it was only a broth.  

All in all, it was a very satisfying experience on all counts, food, drink, and service.  I can see why the locals seem to love both it and the original Flock & Fowl location.  It was definitely worth getting away from the Strip to try something new and different.  I hope this place has staying power in the Ogden because I definitely want to come back for more the next time I'm in town.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,7,3,4,VpjeOrltN2dHAyDltRL8Lw

Originally we were hoping to dine at the location next to the Lucky Dragon hotel, but we quickly discovered this location was temporarily closed. Luckily, the location in dtlv was open and headed there on Saturday for lunch. Drawback with this place is that there's only limited free parking and metered street and lots. IIRC an hour on the street was $2 vs. $3 inside the lot. Do watch the time as there were meter maids cruising around in bikes.

Arrived to a packed restaurant and were told that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes for a table (our party had 5). We ended up only waiting 15 minutes for our table which wasn't bad. Seemed as if we just had bad timing. We ended up ordering a laksa, kaya toast, poached hainan chicken rice, fried chicken and the roasted game hen. Next we opted for Chinese sausages, fried egg, veggies, and their soft boiled egg. The most important part of dish is the rice for me. Though the flavor of the rice was more fragrant than Savoy, it just doesn't compare to what one would find in Singapore or even up here at cluck2go in Pasadena. Out of all the different varieties of chicken, I thought the roasted cornish game hen was the most moist and flavorful. Second best would have been the fried chicken and lastly the poached. However, one can definitely taste the quality of chicken used here. The most disappointing part of the meal was when I requested more ginger sauce. What was brought out looked like a greenish-yellow phlegm that one would cough up when you have the flu. It looked like nothing what we initially had. I wish I took a pic of the sauce. 

The laksa was decent but thought it a lacked flavor but that could be due to design. An authentic laksa in Singapore may be too strong for American taste buds and most would find too fishy. The kaya toast was ok but once again wasn't very authentic. 

Wasn't a memorable meal and definitely didn't live up to the expectations I had.  Loved the decor and the waiters were friendly. Not sure I would go out of my way to dine here again.",w-hrD3-YJXbDUlvBwrpWtA,10,7,3,Ds2VjK4Rii6vr1r_vGTCuA

Chicken rice, the national dish of Singapore and since 2015, in their tiny eatery on Sahara, they did it up right proper.  Fast forward to today, in their industrial digs in DTLV, same great heavenly pok pok.  Can you tell I've been a longtime fan?

Note:  This isn't social dining like other DTLV hot spots.  With few exceptions, dishes are NOT meant to be shared.
 
The chicken, free range, organic and chickeny as it should be.  Poached in a mother stock of chickeny goodness, it's uber tender flesh is sliced and served along side a pile of rice cooked in the thick, fatty, collagen charged poaching liquid.  A brooding, earthy, slightly sweet dark soy and bright, spicy sambal, the traditional and perfect accompaniments.  Be sure to get the one broth as a side.  Basically the cooking liquid to complete the authentic dish.  Chickeny goodness piled atop chickeny infused goodness, served with side of liquid chickeny goodness; get the picture?  

Note:  The dish can be ordered with either a fried or roasted chicken.  sampled from fellow diner's plates but it won't beat the traditional.

Sadly the other two Singapore dishes pale in comparison and lack authenticity.  The laksa is missing many of the herbs (laksa leaves, galangal) usually associated with the soup.  Noodles are UNDERCOOKED, al dente when they should be extremely soft and yielding, and there is too much ""stuff"" that result in competing flavors.  Fried tofu, shrimp, micro greens, chicken, egg.  The kaya toast; I won't bother.  So incorrectly made, just skip this.

If available, the chicken skin is a must.  Deep fried, aggressively seasoned, the perfect cracker.

Service is local friendly and efficient.

OK craft cocktail program and short but well selected list of beers all fairly priced.

Just steps away from Fremont Street inside the Ogden Condo High Rise, parking options are fair, with free curb parking a short walk away if you look a bit further out.

A couple outstanding notes to mention :

Start off with the Flock Frites (6.99): Curly Fries, Parmesan,Truffle Schmaltz Mayo & Herbs. EXCELLENT truffle aioli. Very fragrant and refreshing with a ranch-like consistency....the sauce was the highlight of the meal for me!! I could seriously pour it on anything and everything....you'll want to do the same!

Since the menu is Poultry forward, I will suggest the chicken items most enjoyed :

Flock on Flock Chicken Sando ($13.99): Buttermilk Fried Chicken Thigh, Egg Salad Aioli, Preserved Mustard Greens, Cabbage on Local Bread. Juicy chicken, great sandwich!

Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice: Mary's Free Range Chicken, Roasted Cornish Hen, Fried Chicken Thigh, Fried Chicken Skins, Chicken Fat Rice w/ Organic Fried Egg. Excellent feast to try a bit of everything served here, executed perfectly. We also tried the Boiled Chicken here, much better than the average Chinatown rendition.

Curry Laksa ($16.99): Curry Coconut Noodle Soup, Large Prawn, Tofu Puffs, Pulled Mary's Chicken, 1 Hour Egg, Herbs & Lime. Light curry, coming together nicely with the herbs and citrus, good portion.

And don't forget to try a side of the Chicken Bone Broth!! So flavorful, rich soup that you will want to drink straight out of the cup!

5279208,2018-06-26,1,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"Visited once at its prior location and recently featured as part of a #supportlocal catering initiative it was finally on Saturday that Flock & Fowl Downtown proved convenient, the newly launched Brunch offering daytime hours inside a beautiful space at The Ogden.

Just recently celebrating six months feeding DTLV, Chef Sheridan Su's acclaim continuing to grow with a James Beard Foundation Semi-Finalist Nod in 2018, guests entering the doors of 150 North Las Vegas Boulevard will quickly find themselves met by ornate wallpaper and a well-stocked Bar, Chef Su's Wife Jenny present and smiling as she guides guests to their seats and checks in frequently throughout the meal.

Lengthy but not wide with a view across Ogden Avenue not as interesting as the room's décor, a gentle soundtrack full on this day with the likes of Tame Impala, it was with a frequent tablemate already present sipping Iced Tea that Water was offered, no ""tap"" suggested but instead a Charcoal filtered product from Vero not infrequently seen in fine dining that carries an unannounced charge of $2 per person.

Placing the new Brunch menu atop Flock & Fowl's daily options, the words ""Brunch without booze is just a sad, late Breakfast"" falling on deaf ears with both diners and their waitress also missing the ""Choice of a side"" that was neither offered nor served despite small print below attempted cleverness, it was in five items that appetites were invested, Chef Su briefly present but the majority of cooking left in Michael Robert Rizzo's capable hands.

Slightly less than 1/3 full just past noon, Bartender Adam Rains arriving later and enjoying thick-cut French Toast with his daughter at a nearby table, it was with order deferred to one of two waitresses that Kaya Toast first came out, the rarely seen specialty featuring buttery Toast made by Douglas Taylor at Jerry's Nugget impressing by way of creamy Coconut Jam and a Sunnyside Egg plus reduced Soy though the decision to add Foie Gras was eschewed as it seems like an unnecessary, though fairly priced, up-sell.

Next served a sharable portion of Flock Frites, their omission from catering perhaps fortuitous as an on-site order straight from the fryer proved crisp and oilless with a great blend of Herbs and salinity even before adding umami via Flock Sauce, it was in follow-up that the unassuming Quinoa Salad quickly proved to be a highlight with Grains nicely cooked and slightly tangy while Cauliflower, Almonds, fried Tofu and $3-worth of additional Chinese  Sausage provided heterogeneity that never got boring.

Using a Yelp! check-in for one Bao each, the item's presence on Flock & Fowl Downtown's menu a reminder of the Su's start serving Buns at a beauty salon, it was with three great bites of Fried Chicken quickly devoured that more arrived in the hands of a younger waitress inquiring ""is this table two?"" after previously mis-delivering another plate, the golden organic Bird this time atop two brightly colored Biscuits and sautéed Greens with perfectly poached Eggs and vibrant Citrus Hollandaise.

Offering only two Desserts, though one might consider the French Toast as such during Brunch, it was with fond memories of the Cheesecake from catering still lingering that guests waited fifteen minutes for Flock & Fowl's Cast Iron Chocolate Chip Cookie, another recipe from Chef Taylor that is served gooey and thick with a big scoop Vanilla Ice Cream and delightfully complex Miso Caramel Sauce.

FOUR STARS:  Virtually faultless in terms of Food, the fact that Garlic Hummus was announced as unavailable at the start of the meal in addition to the forgotten Brunch side dish and small service errors another reminder that even a great Chef can be held-back by his staff, it would take little more than a bit of additional training and professionalism for Flock & Fowl to fly alongside Carson Kitchen, Esther's and Atomic as a true downtown dining destination.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,4,pT8Eqr1YPrAmBglqc6iHhQ

Miso Black Garlic Hummus - Sounded interesting but after trying it, nothing special.

Chicken Wings - Half of the order was Angry Sauce which tasted like Szechuan spices and Sriracha and the other half was Honey Butter which was a mild sweet and savory flavor. Both were executed well.

Quinoa Salad w/ Fried Cauliflower & Tofu - Done really well and was a cold refreshing dish on a hot sunny day. Subtle flavors but the fried cauliflower was good

Kaya Toast - It was French Toast's sister for sure. This dish was bomb and I could only imagine what it would be like with the Foie Gras (which we didn't order -_-)....

The Butcher's Steak - I don't know if it's because they ordered it well-done (I don't know whyyyyyyyy) but it looked like a very sad dish. Curly frites was similar to Jack in the Crack's curly fries...a little thickness to the fries could give it more of a premium feel...

The Hot Flock Sando - Again maybe because it was sitting under the heat lamp for a long time but this chicken was dry and bread was borderline firm and hard on the outside...I can see this being really good but this attempt left it very underwhelming...

Bang Bang Chicken Noodle Salad - Not the greatest fan of cold noodle dishes but the flavor was good...reminded me of a south east asian hiyashi chuka....

Hainanese Chicken Rice - Not as good as the first time I had it and the chicken had some chewy cartilage bits that I am not a fan of....I felt the house soy was a little different...and the 1-hour egg is bomb....might have to try it again a third time...

They didn't come back for quite some time at the host podium but it turned out they were preparing a table for us in the back which was obscured by the bar.  

For food we ordered their Signature Hainanese Rice with a 1/2 roasted Cornish game hen that came with 2 sides where we selected: 1 Hour egg, daily veggie and ordered a snack of 8 pc chicken wings half honey butter and half angry sauce. 

Chicken Wings: delicious!  The angry sauce wasn't very spicy.  The honey butter wings are highly recommended!

The Hainanese rice wasn't the Singaporean style I was expecting but was more a fusion play on an asian classic which I feel they did it justice.  Chicken was delicious and juicy! The sauces for dipping were not the traditional ones so it wasn't to my liking.  That doesn't mean it would not work for others!

The staff was well coordinated and nice.  I'd come back and eat here again.

I am a huge fan of the Hainan Chicken Rice at Flock & Fowl. I could really eat it every day if I had to; it's the perfect combo of tasty protein and carbs for me. If there's another restaurant in Las Vegas that's making this dish this good, I haven't heard about it.  The only drawback with the first location of Flock and Fowl is that it is not open for dinner.  That is no longer an issue with the opening of Flock & Fowl #2 located in downtown Las Vegas in the Ogden building. Same great chicken rice and service, but at night time!

Troi, our server, was excellent and so was the rest of the staff.  As Norm K. mentioned in his review, Chef Su and wife Jenny were on hand to greet us and Jenny checked on us more than once.  FF #2 is a wonderful addition to Downtown Las Vegas and I know that we'll be back for more.

5625057,2018-02-25,0,-qYuPncpK8elgD-6Qx3v7A,"I adore the original Flock & Fowl on Sahara. It truly is one of the most special and unique restaurants in Las Vegas. The menu items are small and simple, but exquisite. So needless to say, I was pumped when I heard they were bringing a new and bigger version to Downtown Las Vegas.

However, I think the new location is just that - too new and too big. While the Signature Hainanese Chicken is still on the menu, the price is raised to $14.99 with two ad-ons. Please don't miss out on the Chinese sausage - it'll change your life. The quality of the food is still wonderful and I enjoyed my meal thoroughly.

Another differentiating factor is an extensive cocktail menu. While all of the drinks sounded enchanting, I had to try the Mezcal Milk Tea. The cocktail presented was gorgeous and the flavors were complex. However, the cocktail was 90 percent ice and served with a flimsy paper straw that made it impossible to drink. I was definitely a little irked that I spent $11 on a cocktail that was so watered down and challenging to consume.

The service at Flock & Fowl has some room for improvement. While everyone was nice, attentive and eager-to-please, it took awhile for our drinks to get to us, and then my friend ordered deviled eggs which never arrived before our entrees, so she just canceled the order. Then they committed my least favorite 21st century restaurant move and made us pay and tip for everything on an iPad...while the server stood over us and watched. This is a bit uncomfortable and led me to tip higher than I probably would have based on our experience. 

Do I still love Flock & Fowl? Of course. Does the DTLV location still need a bit of work before it reaches the quaint, intimate nature of the Sahara spot? Definitely.",TA1PfPUiDDgnMBZU1T6L8Q,2,0,3,QHXR9B9MlPqS2w3_l5B02w

The space and the service were excellent, so there is nothing much more to say about that. The things that didn't blow me away was the food.

In all the photos on Yelp, the food looks absolutely fantastic. Excellent presentation, mouth-watering color palate. My eyes were definitely happy, but the taste just didn't follow suit.

The wings weren't very sweet and otherwise bland. We had to use the hot sauce from my Hainanese chicken rice dish just to get it to decent. The Son in Law eggs were also a bit of a miss. Felt just like eggs with some stuff on top. I did like my Hainanese chicken rice dish, though. The sides of Chinese sausage and sauteed vegetables were nice.

There is much better food to be had in LV. I'd flock somewhere else if you had a limited number of meals in town.",rFW49mBxj7tnt2y-2Exb8w,1,0,3,AqIkrwf-o63LzqzwoV6fVw

Service was excellent; my server,  busboy, and the manager(I think) were very attentive and friendly. The menu was pretty small which I'm fine with. We ordered the wings and had the the angry sauce and honey butter. Angry sauce was really good not too spicy but very flavorful; the honey butter just okay, a lot of butter and very little honey. For entree we had two orders of Hainanese chicken, originally the plan was to order one Laksa and one chicken rice to share but they ran out the Laksa by around 9pm. I was a little disappointed but the chicken didn't disappoint; very tender and tasty. We had the bone broth, one hour egg, and veggie for side dishes. All of them were fine, the bone broth was just little too salty for my taste. Another hiccup was the ginger and scallion sauce it had a bitter aftertaste; we brought it to the manager's attention and she told us that the chef was trying something new but would switch back since other customers had the same issue. And we finished our meal with the cast iron chocolate chips cookie. The miso caramel actually worked great on the cookie. We enjoyed our meal and only thing we wish they had dark meat for the Hainanese  Chicken which I prefer. Definitely will come back.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,0,4,nQ7ZaFEhxiqhCtrZhUA1UA

There's some interesting and different dishes, which is nice. We had the spring rolls and edamame (not so different) for appetizers. We had 6 people at the table and they brought us 10 rolls. Edamame was dressed with a sweet tangy sauce. 

I was the only person at the table that did not get the signature dish. Both people sitting to my left and to my right both wanted to try my sandwich and they too liked it better than their meal. Fries and side sauce come with the sandwich. The side sauce was just alright, very creamy and what tasted like mayonnaise.

My experience with this restaurant was not unpleasant but it was slightly disappointing.  The setting is nice.  Definitely belongs in the new flashy/trendy/almost hipster Downtown.  Cool decorations, a snazzy bartender wearing an apron...

The service was good.  Our server was super nice and courteous and patient.  It took a hot second for us to be seen in the first place but once we were he came by to check on us a good amount of times.

Now to the all important food....  We got the deviled eggs.  Are they supposed to be hot or cold?  Because these were lukewarm, room temperature eggs.  Not appetizing.  We also got the Kaya toast with foie gras.  While the foie was cooked superbly the toast seemed to be missing the jam.   I hadn't noticed until the next day when I opened my Instagram and saw someone else's posting.  Now to the chicken... We got both the poached and the fried.  Utter disappointment.  No balance of flavor.  All of the sauces were lackluster, most of them just being bitter.

It seems like it could be a great place and maybe we were here in an off night?",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,3,Qmd8FUuQ89DgBDJ4Oe8D_g

First of all their milk tea was all watered down and tasted more like water. Ordered their famous chicken and rice. And was told that they just ran out of rice and we would have to wait for a few minutes. How can you run out of rice when you are supposedly known for your chicken and rice? Shouldn't it be a staple? They gave us some complimentary appetizers to eat while we waited. After about 30 minutes, which surprise is how long it takes for the rice to cook, our meals came out.

Th chicken was good, very tender and not dry at all. The rice was so so, not too flavorful. The sauces were not too great or appealing either.

And off that beaten path you will stumble upon Flock and Fowl. Grab yourself a seat and enjoy! Joel at the bar will walk you through the menu with all it's Asian flavors. Then quench your thirst with one of his signature cocktails or perhaps your looking for an old favorite with a new spirit currently only available in Nevada.  Don't drink? No problem they have a great selection of teas. My favorite, chrysanthemum, the delicate white flowers create a naturally sweet mild tea. Sooo good. Want something stronger? Againnnn No Problem their Green Teas or Oblong selection  can match the request.
The food is wonderful. All the flavors blending spectacularly to awake your tastebuds to familiar spices with new twist. 
Try: .... ummm EVERYTHING... We tasted most of the menu and it was all amazing!! We didn't want to stop eating!! 
You could find yourself in a lively conversation at the bar or participating in one of their special events and toasting with new friends. This spot is Amazing!!

We ordered their fries and eggrop soup as an appetizer.  Fries were good, they were season curly fries style with a special mayo dipping. 

The egg drop soup was super salty but our awesome server Troy gave us plain chicken broth to dilute the saltiness and helped reheat the soup.

We had the regular poached hainan chicken and the fried hainan chicken.  I still prefer the regular poached. The fried one was good but batter is pretty thick, and fried heavy.
