867009,2015-04-19,0,FbpAg7_qZ6gUpcPLvFyZRw,Worst food ever. Wings had too much Sauce. Cheese fries  too much cheese and the pizza was overcook and dry  can't expect much for a sports bar,rM5f_LkhjEDWnkcWHQI1cg,0,0,1,8AqrggIP3cfWYDcb4ERzyA

Recommended for ppl with low blood pressure and no taste  buds.

Not edible!

Zero stars should be an option but one star for nice servers.",ICZXFdqwr2b7StFHxxaSIQ,0,0,1,sTUSR7F1Jj5piOwF-9ll7Q
2872031,2015-05-19,0,FbpAg7_qZ6gUpcPLvFyZRw,We stopped in for a quick bite and were really pleased; We got slices of pizza and chili fries.  Both were fantastic and we didn't think they were too overpriced.  I'd definitely go there again.,nA4A0xEQlHW_fclKpPBTgQ,0,0,4,2ZaZCJswz2975eFMgseJ_g

I would definitely recommend this place for a quick bite, good quality pizza and an ice cold beer! Good service and reasonable pricing for a casino restaurant!

3667573,2015-10-24,1,FbpAg7_qZ6gUpcPLvFyZRw,"Bottom line is its a sports bar. Don't expect it to blow your tits back. 

The sliders were actually really good and they have a good setup to watch the games without a doubt. The wings were below average. 

Service was fine. We had a table of 10 and they auto gratuity us which no other place had done while we were there and was a bigger mistake on their end since we generally throw down 20-25%. But nobody was drinking so maybe they were nervous. Who knows. 

Just an average place. Maybe watching the Giants get murdered by the Eagles just set a bad tone. Probably not that much better or worse than other sports bars.",Oq4_pN7h_pqg5Y8TCR8itA,0,0,3,UEyfu5yjGXi-7U_YUxDfgA
3932069,2016-01-22,0,FbpAg7_qZ6gUpcPLvFyZRw,"One disappointing experience! Had appetizers the night before and they were mediocre. Decided to take a break from gambling the next afternoon and saw it was reletively empty. We had seated ourselves the night before without issue, today we did the same. We were told to get up and go to the hostess....which was invisible i guess because we didn't even see her on the way out. My husband said we just wanted drinks so she said to go ahead and set at the bar. We apologized and set at the bar. We waited for 10 minutes while 2 bartenders wiped down counters right in front of us and refused to acknowledge we were even sitting at the bar. No , ""hello"" from any staff member. We walked out and went to the extra lounge where they have been gracious and friendly from day one.",OLMjJbcyhZxR41b-WVOizw,0,0,1,fWmejRG--Y0W6gO54RJClw

Easy wagering from inside and just outside the doors. 
Generous distribution of drink tickets with bets. 
Most bartenders are friendly, attentive, and efficient. 
Waitresses helpful if you can find one.",x451nTrnX9Uo1kXC198ZcA,3,3,3,CFp6m-A7tsRKcTtZv89Krg
4282638,2018-04-22,0,FbpAg7_qZ6gUpcPLvFyZRw,"I joined my husband here to enjoy some wings and place some bets.  It's a typical sports bar located in Planet Hollywood and there isn't really anything outstanding about it.  

At first glance the menu items sound interesting.  I decided to try the buffalo chicken waffle fries.  It's exactly what it sounds like chopped buffalo chicken tenders sprinkled on top of waffle fries, drizzled with buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles, served with a side of ketchup.  

The chicken tenders were okay; I think I got mostly just the ends and the crispy skin - there was barely any actual chicken meat.  The waffle fries were bland and the bottoms ones were cold.  Nothing spectacular.

My husband ordered a slice of cheese pizza that was enormous.  It was your average cheese pizza; might have been better if it had come a little faster to the table.  

Service was okay.  Our server took a while to bring our order, didn't ask if we wanted refills and didn't clear our table of our empty baskets.  

I'm sure there are plenty of other places to go to watch the games and place bets.  I wouldn't put this place on the top of that list.",PNL42A7gZFDFG1ShSSfYxw,0,0,3,_z4IwGcGJre7ZVJqBooQGA

We were lucky enough to dine at their mock opening this past Friday and we were very pleased. The wings, sliders, criss cut fires, and pizza were tasty and delish!! And we were comped, yay! Not to mention the wait staff were friendly and gorgeous! 

Cute theme, great sauce choices, and perfect for watching the games. As it is a sportsbook/bar/restaurant. And they also offer signature drinks. 

Kudos and best of luck!! We will definitely be back!!",JBCk2YsWc6rY7tN7uWsaqg,0,0,4,diDWigUkiIORtPXoHpdLTQ

We were there for 2 hours and half of that time was waiting to eat and the other half getting our checks. Food was ok, nothing special. Pizza slices were from Pin Up Pizza and they were pretty big, but I still like Bananos pizza better. Probably won't be back anytime soon.I would rather go to Twin Peaks.",82Q9vX7KBbovF4IP4NYT6w,1,0,2,btaUnmLSxxZqQmZkkHBsvg
