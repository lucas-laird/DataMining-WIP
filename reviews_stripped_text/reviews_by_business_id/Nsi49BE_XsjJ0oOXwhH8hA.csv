Its messy and the restaurant is unkept. I cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like. They do have an ""A"" rating but that food is just plain bad! We used to go here years ago when it had the same reputation and quality as Asia Buffet. The place now is like the haven of people who just need something to fill their stomachs for cheap. No quality, no taste kind of food and cheap. It is sad to see what happened to the quality of this restaurant. I will never go back there unless it is a no choice kind of situation. Do yourself a favor and drive down to Asia Buffet. A few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money. There are also some very seedy characters in the resto.

Yes, the selections are not as much as other places, but for the price, what are you complaining about. Just like other buffet, there are some good food, and there are some bad food. And from what I remember, this place was not bad at all. If I had gone back three times for more servings of food, then it must be good. So if you want good deal when it comes to food, then this is the place.

143775,2017-07-23,0,Nsi49BE_XsjJ0oOXwhH8hA,So disappointed at China Star Buffet today! Since it is one of the most affordable n closes to where I live. I do enjoy eating here many times before until today. The lousy service at Asian restaurants r never a bother to me. I found it to be unique n part of its charm. But until today! I feel disgust n ashamed at what the waitress there said about locals. I know China Star Buffet gets alot of tourist business by the bus load daily! Like most Asian buffet in the LV area. They mostly depend on these tourists to keep their business afloat. But talking negative about your royal local customers is a no no. The waitress was telling one of the tourists in Mandarin to sit with his group. She said most locals will not paid for their meal n pretend to be part of the tourist group. It is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. But of hearing her saying it in my face is an insult to us local patrons. I've heard of some Asian buffets do not serve locals when they have truck loads of tourists coming in. But having such crazy accusations about your local patrons is harsh n unappreciative! I will just take my hard earn dollars somewhere else from now on!,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,0,1,Lrmt5eYzN4K1NWMiKqG1Tg

The food is GREASY dripping GREASY! The waiter dropped the food left on the table onto the floor then swept it up. 

I was so upset I asked for the owner supposedly he wasn't there. I made sure I pointed out the filth throughout the restaurant to the man I spoke with. He profusely apologized and said they would try to solve the problems. I said, I would never find out because I will NEVER return! BTW..never did it cross his mind to take a meal off our bill (which I didn't except).

If the filth is where the public can see it, I can't imagine how the kitchen is. 

BTW..I looked at the pictures for the restaurant and the owner who 'wasn't there' is the man I spoke with the same shirt. He refused to admit he was the owner! How sad!

I went to get the lunch entrees and my date just got a piece of shrimp from the dinner entree and we didn't think that they were going to charge us for that, and so the waiter came to give us the check and we were charged for just lunch. When I was paying up front, the manager or the owner said that the waiter made a mistake and instead charged me for the dinner.

Layout was a little strange, as were some of the selections: salad bar was in the back row, along with the dessert, and in addition to Asian appearing dishes were pizza, french fries, garlic bread, palmieres, cheese-baked mussels, onion rings - you get the drift. Maybe not authentic Cantonese, but something familiar to please timid palates like your kids and whiny sister-in-law.

As for the ""authentic"" stuff, the noodles looked swollen and mushy, but the fried rice was fine, orange chicken was comparable to Panda Express, for what that's worth,and they had fried shrimp and even crabs, although they looked too puny to bother with. I don't like working that hard for my food. 

For some reason, Babygirl and I were both craving broccoli (probably because I haven't cooked anything in ages that didn't involve melted cheese and the deep fryer), so we both actually picked around the meat and took all the vegetables, which were cooked pretty nicely.

Still, it might have been a two star experience, but, the staff was pleasant, it was less than 10 bucks (well, not including drinks), and, can you say ""All the cream cheese rangoons you can eat?"" Believe me, we got our money's worth!

Truer words have never been spoken! 

A little backstory: I saw this place while I was shopping at the beauty warehouse in the same parking lot, and the big sign that said ""Lunch Buffett $5.99"" caught my eye..Chinese buffets are usually pretty affordable for lunch, so I didn't think the price was any indicator of the quality of the buffet. 


WRONG! 

This is the first time since 2007 that I've tried a new restaurant without reviewing yelp first. Why oh why didn't I check the reviews? 


Perhaps the ""air conditioner stolen"" sign (see photo) should have been an indicator of something. My ""buffet preview"" revealed a semi-decent selection, but the food was greasy, old, cold, greasy, disgusting, oh and did I mention GREASY? 

I picked up several ""clean"" plates that had food debris all over them. The food wasn't labeled correctly, and it just looked sad.

Speaking of sad, I learned a valuable lesson: before deciding to eat at an establishment, I will ALWAYS check the expressions of the patrons. Everyone dining there looked depressed to say the least. I felt the same way after dining there. They should be handing out Prozac with the fortune cookies.

My dining partner ""paid"" for the meal shortly thereafter in the bathroom across the street.  My goodness! Save your money and your appetite.",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,2,1,1,L3-vwvvdqm7WvTyyaqAKOw

BTW:  I told the owner that today was my Mom's birthday (6/27), so he sang a birthday song to my Mom and danced a jig for my Mom, too:

I do not even know how to explain this place. I came here with my mother (whom she insisted to eat here by her suggestion) during lunch special. The deal was great and affordable however, the buffet layout and food was a tall tale for me. 

The layout of the buffet was minimal and were VERY adjacent to each other. It may look like it doesn't serve that many choices and to the eyes of the buffet veteran, this may be some joke. lol when passing around, you can barely fit two people in between two buffet serving stands. I had to literally stand outside of it until it cleared before I went in and quickly grab what I needed. 

The food: by the gods of food and wine, I have never been so disappointed. Probably the most cheapest and generic things I ever seen. Some of the food were so stale, especially the meat dishes, it's a disaster. I seen a ""chow mein"" dish and it was basically cheap, flimsy, almost-mushy, waxy ramen noodles sauté in yellow curry powder. How is that chow mein? And I seen labels that were marked ""dinner only"" for dishes that were not meant to be touched. 

Really? I do not know. This place confuse me so much, I don't know whether the cooks were actually robots with no heart to put love into cooking. I asked my mother why this place, she agreed, I'll be making the choices on what places to eat. Lol  the eating experience wasn't worth my time. Cheap, flimsy food. 

Overall, customer service was perhaps the only thing that saved this review from having a half star. The waiter and front desk were sweet people. However, food wise, I shall not recommend this to my friends or even my dear enemies.",TyeU40zAsjgRR7wIjvzsFg,1,0,2,NAmGGLgrqdyi2BV0msgycw
