249288,2016-04-26,0,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,THIS PLACE IS AMAZEBALLS ! I was on my way to Starbucks when I passed by & the name just caught my attention . I went back after grabbing my coffee & the staff were so kind . I got two orders one Asian fusion carnitas I believe & the second was the mexipanese which has tuna & carne asada but I had the spicy salmon added to the mix . ahhh it was so delicious . I recommend this place .,7e5yZry-d99iF6KQTLpQ2w,2,0,5,FolmxE7-Pj7Z1dtp7Yab8Q
493549,2016-02-19,0,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,Liked this place a lot. I saw the sushi burrito sign and was so excited as this type of Asian fusion has been in the news lately. It's not exactly what I was expecting  but it was very good. The menu is a bit confusing but I'm sure it will get easier in time. The mango chili sauce is fantastic.,LjNxxzu4C0Xxt2AqdFbcNg,1,0,4,9R3aT6MgZTqXjrYuYo4cxw

The joke may be on me because this place is absolutely amazing.  We've only been once so far (and hoping to go back very soon) but it far surpassed expectations.  What could have easily been a mess of combined flavors and clashing cultural cuisines was a strikingly piquant meal.

The pricing was good, especially for the amount of food you get.  We went with the Bowl format, which was great.  I can't wait to try their other options.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,4,2,5,ZqsFNsuI8wnSf9CBRu5wrg

Get your butt Downtown to Mexipanese, order one if their sushi burritos and it'll make you happy.   To be perfectly honest with you, when I first saw that their signature Mexipanese burrito had carne asada style brisket and ahi in it I thought WTF?!?!  That's so weird!  I took the leap, gave it a try and was like DAMN - that's a good burrito!  The flavors blend beautifully, the ingredients are fresh and the sauces are carefully crafted, unique and tasty.  I really like that they have some sauces available for you to take a lil extra to put on the side too.  Great service and a super friendly staff.  Tip - go early!  It gets busy there during the lunch hour, but, well worth the wait.  The only bummer is it's closed on weekends (because that part of Downtown goes dead).  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu!!!!",EBHIvVPSqe2cK4EWKbkQkg,1,0,5,29VssnV-GnX68182eeTpTQ

1999477,2016-07-15,5,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,"Fusion confusion- restaurant name seems to be going for Mexican mixed with Japanese, but signage emphasizes that they offer soups, salads, and sandwiches. The menu has a few seafood-based sushiburritos, wraps, and salads, alongside more traditional deli sandwiches and salads. 

Opted for the Triple Pacific (salmon, tuna, and tempura shrimp) as a salad- kale, fish, salsas, edamame, and an odd purple ""seaweed salad"" and a few sauce drizzles. Wasn't a huge fan of the teriyaki-style sauce but overall, the dish was really fresh, and a large portion for the price ($10). 

Service was quick, easy to grab and go if you work in the area. Staff could be more helpful about suggesting dishes for first time visitors, as the menu is a bit confusing. Location is clean, take your food out to the patio to eat- it's shaded, so you can eat there even on hot days.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,7,4,_RGiNt6M5rv3SIeWAKOYuw

Unfortunately I am giving this place a one star due to the rude employee, Christina, who works here. Approaching the order window I was trying to explain to my friends who I brought here to try the place and she said ""may I help you"" three times in a short period as a way to tell me to hurry up and order. Ordered my food, and half way eating it my rice didn't have anymore sauce, and wanted a little more teriyaki sauce, so I politely ask for a little more sauce and she poured so much it was a teriyaki soup. Needless to say I couldn't finish my lunch since it was doused with teriyaki sauce. When she walked by while cleaning the area, I mentioned to her that I couldn't eat my lunch anymore since it was soaked with teriyaki sauce, she asked ""do you want more rice?"" without making any eye contact and continue to wipe around the drinking fountain area. I told her ""no thank you, you were rude."" She said ""not really"". Then I explained the above on why she was rude, and she didn't say anything. 

I regret recommending this place to other people and for them to encounter such an unpleasant service as well.",TPFGII-HmGWALmiSMbHoqA,6,1,1,R3dHkVrw39ZtyvRaxsdWTQ
2958895,2017-01-03,0,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,"Went to Mexipanese today for lunch, as I have a coworker who goes there quite often. Sadly, I wasn't a fan. When I walked in, I went to the side of the place where you are supposed to order, and stood there for about 5 minutes before I finally walked up to the cash register side to get noticed. A gentleman came out and took my order. I wanted a burrito, but they were out of  tortillas, which isn't a big deal, but I was a little bummed by that. I got the teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice. The rice was TERRIBLE. I am glad he put that in the bowl first, because I just picked around it, and avoided the rice as much as I could. It was difficult to chew, and was very hard. Super disappointed. I spent $13 on salad, a drink and chips. Even the chips tasted off. :/ Only enjoyable thing was my drink. Will not be returning here.

***Also, when I called to state my issues with my meal, I was told this was the wrong number...can't seem to find the number anywhere...***

3416193,2016-03-29,0,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,"Definitely caught my eye when I read SUSHI, ASIAN FUSION so I had to check it out. 

I LOVE sushi and I'm always hoping for a place near the court house that's walkable distance.  I could have easily ordered a regular sushi roll that would have satisfied my sushi craving but I wasn't paying attention to the menu and the only thing I could do was ask what was popular.  One of the things the server listed was the Mexipanese (Carne Asada & Tuna) so I went with it.  What do you think of that mix?  Very diverse combination.  She recommended it bowl style so I went along with that too.  

The mixture was very different, but all the ingredients of the rice, black beans, asada, tuna, slaw, nori with a terichipotle sauce was very good.  For me, my bowl, I felt like there wasn't enough rice.  I felt like my bowl was overwhelmed with black beans, but all the other ingredients were perfectly proportionate to the entire bowl.  Don't get me wrong, the beans are tasteful, very good, but I think it was just too much for my liking.  I could probably do without the beans.  The bean and rice portion was either too much or not enough.  The terichipotle sauce has a slight kick to it.  I think if you mix Mexican and Japanese together, try not to overwhelm the mix with too much of the other ingredients.  Keep it simple.   

Overall, I would give this place another shot.",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,2,3,CzntnPuYR3kX1QnGaK_FTg

I got the signature Mexipanese salad (mix of carne asada and tuna poke) Like next door, you have your choice salad, burrito, tacos or bowl. The salad mix was romaine, spinach and kale and super fresh! See photo. 

Service was spot on and food was tasty. (The dragon fire sauce is not spicy, but easily fixed with siracha) I'll definitely return to try other options. 

I got lucky since I missed the 12 pm lunch rush and got my order pretty fast. They missed my added guacamole but that was fixed immediately. Owner was onsite and open to suggestions. Thumbs up!",sqTII6BKq2ouY1-SRNs_nA,3,2,5,zCxapdt3eHgOpnFQFnou0w

The poke tuna salad I ordered didn't really seem to blend the two cultures of food together well. It just came off to me as very bland and any flavors that were present were overpowered by kale.

I got a taste of the Triple Pacific Burrito and that was much better, although I think Sushirrito has the fusion down better.

Nice service here, but I probably wouldn't stop by again.",FAGaTA3XlDzKwA3uxt-7Xg,1,1,2,XmZyE2A1A-dkMzisYb5hCw

5658118,2017-01-10,1,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,"I want to like this place. The food is relatively good - when you can get what you ask for.

I always ask for rice, shrimp tempura, edamame, and dragonfire sauce. No frills, not hard, and pretty straightforward, right? Maybe not so much...

The last time I dined here, the attendant became very angry with me for not wanting chicken on my rice bowl. I did not want any teriyaki chicken - I don't like it. How is that hard??? She became so angry, that she took several pieces of shrimp tempura out of my bowl, and THREW THEM across the food-prep area. Like, from the area with the register to the area with the employee access door to the back room. I'm sorry, WHAT???

She became so angry that she flung my bowl on the counter and contents spilled from it. I promptly paid, and left. I'm sorry - I hate leaving bad reviews, and I know everyone has a bad day here and there, but this was completely uncalled for and unwarranted.

Negative ten stars for an employee temper tantrum. One star here for the food that I wish I had received.

5761041,2016-03-29,0,mS_dBSMFiDJn4UVc0iv6Hg,"okay. So i have been eyeing this place since it opened. I love japanese food, to the point that i make sushi during my lunch break.  Initially, I was excited about anything japanese and the suggestion that there was raw fish involved - super excited.  But upon review of the menu, I had many criticisms - the price was high for lunch - most people who work in the area are public employees, not high paid attorneys - $12 for lunch was too high.  - since then, the price has gone down a couple dollars and makes it better the large portion you can somewhat share with a co-worker with something else brought from home. It's now about $8-$10.  

ALSO there is a new menu which takes out the weird combinations that did not seem appealing like suggesting meat and raw fish in a burrito and everything was mixed.  So I looked at a new menu and using my culinary side, developed a dish that would work well.

Suggestions: cucumbers, chopsticks, have the shredded daikon by itself - sometimes simple is better, SOY PAPER - the sushi ""burrito"" now on japanese menus uses soy paper, not tortillas.. 

criticisms:  Kimchi slaw did not taste like kimchi, you should use napa cabbage instead,  SUSHI is fish and rice together, it does not mean fish so your menu should say fish and you should denote whether it is raw or not with an asterix.  Also, poke is Hawaiian - not japanese.

Japanese - rice bowl, whatever fish combination (i chose spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and shrimp tempura) NO edamame or beans, both asian and kimchi slaw, dragon fire sauce, and teriyaki chipotle.

All in all, i took my food back to my office and rolled it up in pieces of nori to make hand rolls.  

Praise: Loved the moist towelettes it came with, pickled ginger and wasabi in the back condiment station, free green tea mochi this month, and as usual a wonderful and courteous staff - which i know the owner realizes is essential here! , made my experience delightful. 

frightfully though, i hope this stays in business.  the menu change was one thing, but i think you need better advertising and overall branding to really make this place a must go and an everyday lunch destination.  i will continue going and posting and sharing my combinations to do my best to help it along.  #cheerstosmallbusinesses and more power!

ADVICE IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY THIS:
stick to one cuisine.  if you r feeling mexican food, do mexican and the toppings.  if you want japanese with raw fish, stick to rice NOT even salad.  The chicken teriyaki is an in-between you could certainly make this a ""wrap"" not really a burrito though. if you want some suggestions, go ahead and comment and i would be happy to reply. happy eating!",nIeGWrm3KIrU4W_T6yCcgg,1,0,4,NISg4rbtTvZarxuPSzLLTw
