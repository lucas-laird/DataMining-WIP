And filet mignon!  Him and his buddy were in lobster-dipped- in- butter- heaven; the filet mignon could be cut with a fork he said.  This is a restaurant for special occasions and entertaining clients...excellent service. Next time I'm going with him & I'm going eat some lobster...and get a rose (they give all the women roses after your meal).",mN0jo3BTdivjQW-CB5qX5w,0,0,5,llMSsthRQTqh12e6IPFkgQ

The prices are a little high but it's worth it. Great place for romantic dinners. Do your taste buds a favor and dine at the Rosewood Grille.

I was lucky enough to have visited Rosewood Grille last July, and let me tell you, this place did not disappoint in food and most certainly not in service.

Service was impeccable.  Even though this was a fine dining institution and the waitstaff was dressed to the nine, this didn't mean you had to be, and you would still be treated like royalty.  Simone, John, and Jose were like long lost friends - they were jolly, patient, and knowledgeable.  And just thinking about all the food induces salavation.  We ordered the calamari, crab cakes, steak, and two 4lb lobsters, one boiled and one, per Simone's recommendation, broiled, was simply delicious, mouth watering, finger licking delicious.

The meal definitely cost a pretty penny (thanks J & Y for treating!!), but it was well deserved.  What a shame that the downtrending economy led to the downfall of Rosewood Grille.  You shall be sorely missed.",5HetlMApWFa9j4JHspEzHw,17,7,5,M4Aj95cgDwhO-FzkUnfMJg

Now, the food here is definitely good.  I had the crab legs and, my goodness, they were absolutely spectacular.  Large, plump and meaty, they slid right out of the shell.  Absolutely devoon.  He had a ginormous lobster.  That, too, was just delicious.  However, I didn't feel the dining experience itself lent itself to warrant the price tag of it all.  It's not the most expensive place by any means, but I didn't feel the ambiance or service was special enough to shell out a few hundred bucks for.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,0,3,WvJvVGpSTP1yNlOleJ-SMA

3009027,2007-01-02,6,mlNHAQR3UhowDDYdJF5w9w,"Monstrous lobsters. Some close to 16lbs and the dimensions of a small child.

Location is weird-- across the street from the Monte Carlo and behind the Walgreens. However, the interior is surprisingly cozy and classy!

Lobsters are sold by the pound (typically $20-$35) and served with salad, bread, and a twice baked potato. Let me tell you, it is WORK getting through a lobster.. my date and I split a 6 pounder. I was dying towards the end. I left a small clump of lobster meat on my plate. For this, I think I'm going to hell.

You will be sweating lobster juice and drawn butter for hours after. I think I woke up in the middle of the night thinking the tables had turned and I was being steamed alive by a giant lobster.",F8_jeICkvrkLNPdfRYO_5g,1,0,4,GnDeNRahVOi0zDTpJk2Vag
3021404,2009-01-09,11,mlNHAQR3UhowDDYdJF5w9w,"This place says they sell more lobster than all of Las Vegas combined.  I give it 4-stars - partially for history, a bit for ambiance & service... but mostly for 'BART'.

BART?
BART was my lobster friend.  

YOU NAMED YOUR LOBSTER?
You'd name him too if you met him.  BART was a gorgeous, bright red 4 lb monstrosity with claws the size of Oprah.  I've met bouncers at the Rhino less intimidating than BART.

OKAY, I TAKE IT YOU LIKED YOUR LOBSTER?
Hell yeah.  Delicious as all f@#$.  And please...  he has name, y'know.  

UH... RIGHT.  SO WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR LOBS---- I MEAN, 'BART'.
Besides the fact that he was a chunk of seafood the size of a small child?

1) HOT
It was served right out of the kitchen.  Of course a lot of this has to do with the speed of service but I give credit to the whole restaurant's smoothness of operation for this.  Not to mention the candle-warmed melted butter that is provided before you to ensure your new best friend is munch-able with as much amber liquid-y goodness as possible.

2) SOFT & JUICY
I remember a chef at Rosewood Grille coming out to see me many years ago.  He said that any lobster - no matter how large - could be prepared soft, succulent, & delicious, & he scoffed at cooks that inferred that bigger lobsters were tougher.  He brought me a small sampler from two tails - one from a 2lb & one from the 6 lb our table was sharing.  They tasted equally good.  And notorious for their gluttonous 18-22 lb lobsters (viewable in the tank near the entrance), I would assume that Rosewood Grille would know how to prepare beasts like BART.  It's all in the prep.

3) SWEET
BART was somewhat sweet tasting.  Now I have had lobsters before that weren't but again, I think it has to do with how much of the lobster's natural juices escape the shell before it lands on your plate.  Suffice it to say, they got that problem solved this evening.

4) WELL-PREPARED
Here's a trick:  Ask the chef to prepare your lobster for easy eatin'.  The head will be removed, the tail will be split right down the center into 2 pieces, & the claws & legs will be pre-cracked so the meat will just fall out.  Almost no cracker was necessary to get any of the meat out of the lobster.  This was the easiest lobster I've ever eaten. 
...How easy?  Remember how I said that BART was 4 lb lobster?  Everything in my meal was ordered & consumed in 25 minutes - from being seated to getting the check.  Got that?  UNDER 25 MINUTES.  When I said eating the lobster was easy - I frickin' meant it.

5) THE BIB
Any joint that has to do things like prepare bibs for its patrons or lay down plastic on the tables to prevent seepage, (like 'Hot & Juicy Crawfish') is my kind of joint.  Simone brought out the bib and before I knew it, had wrapped it around my neck in preparation for what was coming moments later.

SO, THAT'S ALL YOU ATE?
No, silly.  There was other stuff.  The bread was fresh-based and came with soft-heated butter for spreading - just the way I like it.  The clam chowder was the black sheep of the dinner being a little bit salty and less robust in substance than I'm used to.  The twice-baked potato was unattractive but tasty having had both butter, chives, and sour cream baked into it.  And of course, we're already discussed BART, the ""Wonder Lobster (TM)"".
- Bread:  4/5
- Clam Chowder:  2/5
- Baked Potato:  4/5
- BART:  5/5

ANYTHING ELSE?
Well, there's a good chance your cabbie won't know where it is.  It's across the street from the Monte Carlo in an alley behind a Walgreens and next door to Alan Albert's.  
...SERVICE:  The service from Simone, a decade long veteran waiter of the Rosewood Grille, back when it was located next door to the Venetian, was fantastic and was full of stories from the real hey days of ""Convention Town"" Vegas & the ""COMDEX"" years.  
...LOCATION: The dining room is decorated nearly identically to the original restaurant, decked out in dark woods, canopies, and nautical/shipyard paraphernalia. 
...PRICE:  The cost should have been something like $120, at 4 lbs but I think but I got BART for $90.  This pricing for lobster is par for the course.


CONCLUSION
Great meal.  Gets stars for providing a unique product - huge lobsters - only available at Rosewood.  Gets stars for providing high quality.  Mind you this is pricey but it goes both ways:  I don't give 5-stars to super cheap restaurants that provide food that's only 4-star quality.  The only reason I can't push this up to the 5-star, ""OMFG-must-go-to-every-trip"" level is... well... because I really can't imagine hitting this every trip with all the other amazing restaurants available.  Every OTHER trip... that's more likely.  

4-stars.  

(Now stop talking about BART.  Get your own BART.  This one was [burp] mine.)

I would never judge a restaurant based on its advertising or it's exterior, lest I be judged on the size of my gut or the thickness of my wallet.",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,7,9,4,j-cJTGFbYQobDeExqupbMA
3302728,2008-09-16,0,mlNHAQR3UhowDDYdJF5w9w,"Sooooo I went to Las Vegas for my 21st birthday with my momz and auntie. We went to the Rosewood Grille Saturday night before going to Poetry. Man'O'Man! First off let me say, I loooove seafood! esp. crab and lobster. I guess the Rosewood Grille was formally the Lobster House and that is why I pick it.(because of tha name duh) Anyway, so we went there for dinner. It was only a few ppl there (our reservations were at 7pm) The wait staff was very nice and attentive and the food was WONDERFUL!!! We receive hot bread when we arrived and fast service. My mom and I had the whole lobster which came with a twice baked potato and house salad and my aunt had a pound of crab legs,salad and a potato as well (it was bout 6 big ass crab legs, which were also good..I had a lil taste) 

OMG! It was a feast! My mom is very picky when it comes to other ppls cooking, BUT Rosewood grille was on hit!!!(her words) Meaning it has to be good. I was so full I had to take home my claws and didn't even eat it until Sunday evening about 6pm...(I was full all night and the following day. I was so full, I couldn't even have a drink or two at the club that night cuz my stomach was hurting like crazy with all that yummyness I had jus consumed). Overall, our bill was like 268 which included the meals listed above,a long island ice tea for my auntie and sprite for me and my mom. Its expensive BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! I would def. recommend this joint. Its wonderful! I'm goin back when I go to Las Vegas!!!!

P.S. For my birthday, they gave all of us roses and let me take a pic with a 11lb lobster! and YES it was alive!!!",oZb2wijVK27NeSbBoy_oFQ,0,0,5,b3DTN4mz9B-0v095lsCcJA

Almost 20 years ago, I met a group of friends for a super-lush dinner when in Vegas and we went for the lobster.

Go hungry.  My little guy was about a 3lb. and I did not even finish it!  The most lobster I have ever had by far.  You also get soup (clam chowder) and twice baked potato.  I enjoyed my dinner, but my hubby and dad steaks were ok, so 3 stars.  It's kind off back off in an alley behind Fatburger, but the inside was very nice.  Very quiet with dim lighting if that is what you are looking for.  BTW price was about $20+ per pound. (or something like that)",5nx6NaAdV9-w5AEfzFAFbA,0,0,3,GsPSag5LfSglPIlhb3TWDQ

i've been here a few times now and the food has been really awesome. of course you're suppose to go there for their lobster, but their steaks are well executed and is of good quality, too...just in case you prefer to eat a land animal as oppose to a seafaring one.  i also like their scallops and crab cakes. they have a good wine selection and at the end of your meal, every lady at your table will get a red rose. cute touch. good eats.",JJcWtRu2Gg-LeOsKBQZqDA,1,1,5,mqqH7SeJlnSl7qpG3-VtDg
