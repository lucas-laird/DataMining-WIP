2876406,2018-06-23,0,ARGQeEn17fhIdfij07FwNw,"Hungry on the East side past 10 pm when everything seemed to be closed, my stomach was pointing me towards a personal guilty pleasure: fast Mexican. Fast Mexican joints are arguably the best thing this world has to offer. They're open late, fill you up for cheap, and the food always tastes amazing. 

This place has a menu full of classics. But carne asada fries seem to be their specialty as they've earned a rightful spot at the center of the menu board, and that's what I ordered. We waited a while for the food but were kept busy by the steamy novela playing on the TV. The lady who took our order rushed over to apologize for our food being late and then brought it to our table minutes later along with a free drink. Great service for a fast food place!

The fries came PACKED in its takeout box- it was heavy!! But quality was not sacrificed for quantity as it was mindblowingly good. The beautiful cubes of steak were cooked to perfection- so tender and juicy, melted in my mouth like butter. The fries were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and were made even better by the cheese and sour cream. These carne fries are also available with added shrimp for a few extra bucks. 

Also tried their rolled tacos. To my surprise they were stuffed with quality shredded beef instead of sketchy ground beef. Served with cheese, guac, and a generous helping of lettuce and pico. Even with added yummy yellow salsa they were kinda bland, but at only $4 can you really ask for much? 

Viva el Taco Express is dang near perfect besides the below average rolled tacos. Mind blowing carne asada fries, good service, unbelievably clean space (spotless dining area and even the restrooms smell great!), and open almost all day from 7 AM til midnight. 5/5!",4ywoghefRTsbi1SzkR-fcA,1,0,5,zeVszTYaxH83eWjnU40H2A

My order came out quickly and I topped my food with salsa at a small salsa bar at the counter.  The food was good and the salsa was good enough to make my eyes water.

4039946,2018-06-02,2,ARGQeEn17fhIdfij07FwNw,"Growing up in Vegas I feel like Mexican places that serve plate meals are engraved in my veins. I grew up on Roberto's, but now only have it when I'm drunk or hung over. I usually get my Mexican food fix from my best friend's family nowadays. 

Viva El Taco has the same concept of a Roberto's but it just taste better in my opinion. They have all your tacos, burritos, and plate combos. Viva also has some of the most solid street tacos in Vegas. When I say solid I am referring to their consistency and ability to satisfy a taco craving lol The Freshness, flavor, and convenience factors are there. They even ask if you want your tripas crispy or soft which is my gold standard of taco eating lol Their tripas and tongue are my recommendations for tacos.

I'm all for waiting for good food, but It's seriously so nice being up the street from a good taco place where I don't have to wait in a huge line. Their salsa bar is also always cleaned, stocked, and looking fresh and full. I also dig that their staff is pleasant and actually look happy to be at work. Given their quick service, affordable prices, and store upkeep I don't have any criticism. Just a solid little Mexican joint.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,2,4,M84CP5hNZYzpZb7qTKH_kw
4395468,2018-04-14,9,ARGQeEn17fhIdfij07FwNw,"Viva El Taco Express comes in for the win! I was ecstatic to see a new Mexican restaurant pop up near my house. 

First impressions, the restaurant is very clean! The countertops are glistening and decor is vibrant yet sleek. 

The first time I came here, I got the tostada de ceviche and was blown away by the flavor and portion. For under $5 it's huge! The ceviche is sandwiched between 2 tostadas. Each bite gives you that crunch from the tostada, freshness of the shrimp, nice acidity from the lime, and light creaminess from the sliced avocados. Heaven in my mouth! 

My most recent trip, I ordered the 3 rolled up tacos with guacamole and cheese. I wasn't expecting a taquito to be so delicious. If you've ever had an elote, the flavor is uniquely similar to that. They slab on delicious guacamole, shredded cheese, and I think cotija cheese on top. I added some pickled onions and salsa from the salsa bar and it really elevated the whole thing. The pickled onions are one of my favorite condiments at the salsa bar. It's tangy and spicy, and best of all - free! 

The salsa is also amazing on its own. They recently added the medium roasted salsa during my last visit. I can honestly say they are all worth trying. I can't pick a favorite, so I end up rotating between the 3 salsas after each bite of my taquito topped with pickled onion.

They also offer agua frescas.  They've included pineapple, jamaica (hibsicus), horchata, and Pepino Limon (cucumber/lemon). I tried the pepino limon and it was quite refreshing. It didn't taste like cucumber lemon to me though, it tastes like it had a hint of honeydew. Either way, it was good for these hot Vegas days that are soon upon us. 

This place is so good, I came for lunch and shared some rolled tacos with my mom as a light snack. After grocery shopping, we came home and talked about how good the rolled tacos were, we went back and got 2 more order of it!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,15,16,5,BE7BPglHW9U_ootQfFXNvw
