The service was what you'd expect but I felt that the wine list needed to be upgraded.",MU18LuTIhGETBXMpRq4AJw,0,0,3,ptwih-ZW5QGHzTecExD3yg

Don't waist one of your Vegas meals at this place. 
Subpar at best.",ZN4zwo_M71eOrl-tSskZJA,2,0,2,ZSWoAf-WBnbcX67mX29UZg

Told the waitress we were trying to get in & out in 40 min to catch our flight and it wasn't a problem, even though the place was packed. Service was very good actually. She was fast, but attentive.

I got a bagel with salmon & cream cheese.  Very nice presentation and fresh salmon.  I was very happy.  Hubby and the little guy had pancakes and waffles, which were both good too.",cgPS-sS4P2sGmVZbx6J5rQ,1,0,4,xX2p2S0jPce9iFsstGTncw

In New York, New York in the miniature city section, it was just what we were looking for. We sat at the bar, had one of the best Bloody Marys I've ever had and a good breakfast. Nothing is cheap in Vegas, would have been cheaper at home but who cares?",juPjEdGalERhRelV3T20Sw,0,0,4,k3tk9VfZ1Vpjhr220bSpBQ
