13554,2016-09-08,1,RU3PsG2y_eGBFi_8jDqyQA,Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The chicken is not grilled it's more like boiled soft. True teriyaki chicken is supposed to be grilled. The chow mein noodles are big and fat kind of reminds me of fettuccine pasta.. If you already have a favorite Chinese place in town trust me and stick to what u know. Don't try this place you will not like it at all.,prVO37jsZd7BOgh0HacprQ,1,0,1,JIrnVJH8u1eFoS0Ot9W0Ag

I ordered chicken/shrimp Pad Thai, the flavor was just not there. The chicken was yellow and did not look or smell appetizing. My husband ordered ""the spiciest"" item on the menu, spicy chicken, which was not spicy at all and also lacked flavor. 
Then, sushi. We ordered the crispy rice?(don't remember the name) roll and it was the worst roll I've ever had. It had no flavor at all. The man who brought it over didn't bother to give us ginger nor wasabi.

2962266,2017-09-20,1,RU3PsG2y_eGBFi_8jDqyQA,"A basic but solid Chinese food joint. Clean, quick and super friendly staff. I called in a to go order and was surprised when I was told I could pick it up in 5 minutes. Whoa there, girl! 5 minutes? I can't even get out to my car and down the street in 5 minutes! I asked her if they could have it ready in 30 minutes instead. She obliged. 
I showed up 30 minutes later and the food was packed up and ready to go. I decided on the personal dinner and chose sesame chicken as my entree and chow mein for the side. The dinner also comes with soup, a crab rangoon and an egg roll. It's a ton of food for just $10. 
I didn't even get into the soup (think I'll save that for lunch tomorrow). The food was decent-not spectacular but good enough. The crab rangoon was the best part-of course how can you go wrong with crab and cream cheese? The egg roll wasn't my favorite-that's all I'll say about that. The chow mein was simple-noodles, bean sprouts, onions and carrots. The flavor was good. The sesame chicken wasn't too bad. I have a sneaking suspicion that although I asked for the food to be ready in a half hour, they may have stuck to the 5 minute time frame cause the entire meal just tasted kind of-older. 
The menu is extensive and has all the usual Chinese choices along with a couple Thai options. The restaurant is in kind of a dying shopping center but it's easy to find and there are quite a few tables if you want to eat there. 
I'll be back to dine inside-the food will be fresher that way, I'm sure. With the lack of decent Chinese food restaurants on this side of town, China a Go Go is a welcome addition. Good food, great prices and super friendly staff.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,3,cKgXDJ2orCOPVMp1RD30yg

This is the final time I think if I pay for something we should get what we paid for also it took the driver over an hour to deliver the incorrect wrong order further while talking to the lady on the phone she gave me someone else's address saying it was mine then had the nerve to ask me if I'm sure I believe I know my own address I had to tell her your wrong I don't care what shows up from my number im not the first person to have a cell number.
