The rice and red beans was really good and I enjoyed the flour thick tortilla. The coleslaw was tasteless and I could have done without it. The papusa was good although other than a bit of cheese pretty similar to the tortilla. The grilled plantain tasted good but was dry. The pilesener beer hit the spot though. Chips were standard, salsa was bland but overall cannot complain for an $8.99 dinner and $3 beers. 

The inside although reminiscent of a old drug store, and probably was at some point had nicer table and chairs than I expected taking into account the location on Main St. and the scary little motel parking lot where it was situated.

I recommend trying this if you have never has this type of cuisine before because it's really delicious. Other items include burritos, empanadas, and even breakfast items like huevos rancheros. Everything I've tried has been good. 

On Tuesdays and Thursdays the mixed pupusas are $1 each, down from $1.75 regularly. Occasionally we stock up on 10-15 and take em to go, so we end up with a few meals worth. The pupusas come with a salsa and a Salvadoran slaw called curtido. It's a mixture of pickled cabbage, onions, carrots and spices that when eaten with the pupusa tastes great.

2469789,2014-04-09,0,ydUk0peVAOgiYq1l3U5SaQ,"Let me start this off by saying that I have spent the last three years living in Los Angeles, spending  a lot of time particularly near MacArthur Park and my lovely girlfriend was born and raised in Santa Ana, El Salvador. This review is based on my experiences with numerous restaurantes salvadore√±os and not to mention her home cooked pupusas. 

I first tried this place after being let down a few times here in Las Vegas. My friend and I went here mostly because it was filmed in Casino. Some of you might remember the scene where Rosenthal had Geri's ex boyfriend/sancho beat up in his Cadillac. We weren't expecting a whole lot. As I explained to him, Salvadoran food just isn't as good here as it was in LA. I don't know why but if any place is going to be good, this was it. We started off our order with two Pilseners (a nice touch since Salvadoran Beer is so hard to find and even harder in Las Vegas) and contemplated the kolashampan. We decided to stick to the cervezas but would later order a bottle to go, since they did have the legit Kolashampan from El Salvador.

After a little wait, the waitress served our pupusas revueltas and I was in heaven! It took me right back to MacArthur Park! This is as real as you'd get anywhere in Los Angeles. I highly recommend this place and can't praise it enough. 

We ended up capping the trip off with a nice plate of platanos fritos con frijoles y crema and we split a Cerveza Regia and we bought some pupusas to go, the Kolashampan and some car banners, so yes, I am the tall white guy in the black Chevy with a Salvadoran flag hanging from my turn signal now. Lol

Wondering if this was some king of freak accident, I took my grandma here today and we had the same great food, same cold beer and same wonderful service. This place gets an A+ in my book",uu-QoIJ8HBVLbSBY8YIo1g,0,0,5,clzhTI1GOGUrWZYLsn047w

I was glad he suggested it. We've been coming here for 10+ years now.
The current interior is more of a restaurant than the previous decor which was very eclectic, they had murals painted on the walls, lattice partitions, fishnet hammocks strung up giving it a very ""backyard of someones home"" feel. A few years ago, the motel attached decided to renovate the exterior, and the owners of Salvadoreno took the opportunity to update their interior, now its tables and chairs, brown tones.
The food has remained consistently delicious. Everything is fresh made. They have a variety of pupusas, filled corn tortilla pattys, from beans and cheese, loroco (native sprout), and the revuelta which is refried beans, cheese, and ground shredded pork (known as chicharron). The Plato Tipico is the Salvadoran typical plate, it combines a mix of the staples, a pice of grilled steak (carne asada), fried sweet plantain, a drier cheese similar to feta, a small lettuce tomato salad, and my favorite, casamiento, which is a rice and bean combo that is cooked together and is so tasty!
Also on the menu are pollo asado, taquitos, carne asada plate, steak encebollado (with onions), seafood cocktails (coctel mariscos) and fresh drinks (aguas frescas) such as horchata (a rice water drink, with the addition of ground pumpkin seeds, ensalada, a chopped fruit punch drink, and various drinks on roatation. A variety of latin beers are also offered.
