The smoothies are just okay; the one I got tasted like they filled the blender with ice and tossed in a couple of strawberries. Not bad, but unexciting.",ea8tiHl8nYqVTLK_srP79A,0,0,4,B_rSH9YHk9i-duJH7pvwbg

I tried having a friendly conversation with him and he just gave me a dirty look, then I ordered and he was texting on his phone the whole time. Then he made my smoothie and it was the worst tasting smoothie of my life. Overall this guy hates his job and shows it too well, jobs are privileges and he doesn't deserve it",m9ePwsss20TaI3v75UT-qw,1,0,1,IVMQUlAmcMATPJiAQMZ2Ww
1668344,2013-02-18,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,The chicken salad sandwich was great!  I could have done without the smoothie.  I expected it to be better since smoothie is in the name.  I had the Mango magic and couldn't taste any of the mango.  This is located in the Excalibur food court and a good alternative to the fast food places on either side.,aqc3CnsHVD177hfh3QE3kg,0,0,3,mqjdygcV89lCfXCeqgBU7A
1730807,2018-05-20,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,I waited 30 minutes for a shake. This is ridiculous. The staff are understaffed and don't have the tools to make things on time. Horrible experience. I will be telling people I know not to come here.,iHKFcTBv02hES04yVdw1tA,0,0,1,N3tPMidDSbpA21orccbOOw
1866541,2018-04-04,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,I ordered a half sandwich and a smoothie ... the smoothie was ok but the sandwich was bs !! They gave me a qt of a half sandwich,VGd4dMHQ80lMFutH0a2hGg,0,0,1,OcCzZWmThIKjRJi5BbG8Qg
2522132,2013-12-13,2,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,First meal coming to Vegas and I was craving a smoothie and decided to stop by here To grab a quick meal. Realizing that was one of the biggest regrets of my trip. Ordered a smoothie and Jamaican bowl. The Jamaican bowl was disgusting. Bland chicken with sauce that didn't taste like anything thing like Jamaican food. The smoothie tasted like a slurpee from 7/11 only 3x the price.,8C2D0VLMbi0ju2yVba5FaA,1,2,1,bKOxKhqdwdd7qMgZNRHkNQ
3043158,2016-07-15,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,"LOVE this place! I'm pretty picky with my green smoothies, but decided to go with the Island Green (spinach, kale, pineapple, mango, and banana). One of the best ones I've had especially for a reasonable price of around $7 including tax AND for a 20 oz. I promise you you can't taste the greens at all since the fruit takes over the flavor. Would definitely recommend.",w-SC_4mlcf3BFM41VfwyvA,0,0,5,iW63sOaq9fgKUPhTIXqgug
4054610,2013-01-18,1,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,"Just okay for Tropical Smoothie, but when you're in the Excalibur and looking for something quick, you're left with fast food choices.  This location is upstairs with the rest of their fast food restaurants.  I am a fan of the Tropical Smoothie chain.  My order is the same almost everytime...their Pesto Chicken Flatbread.  Service at this location is not bad, especially since most people up here are hitting up the McDonalds or Krispy Kremes.

One plus...they are either open 24 hours or stay open really late.  I've been here after midnight and they are still open.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,2,4,5chgmFA-LjHidYQh1Plj9w
4772445,2018-03-10,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,"I think this was one of the worst smoothies of my life. I got the green detox smoothie and I'm pretty sure there was half a bag of poorly chopped up ginger, it just tasted so horrible my mouth was actually stinging. My sister got the blueberry bliss and it was just blended blueberries and water. It legit tasted like blueberry flavored water with dyed sawdust to give some texture. I would never come here again and I hope they go out of business because no one deserves to taste what I have tasted not even the devil himself.",Xi-YXB80gtGbgbwGc8kVqw,0,0,1,AJVPCXRyn28t6O1WWyQLAg
4926982,2017-11-11,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,I was super hungry and saw that the line was short at the Tropical Smoothie Cafe so I decided to go and get a salad from them. I waited over 10 minutes like an idiot at the front while the guy kept telling to wait a second meanwhile he was getting all the food ready. He put out a total of three orders then went to the back after having me wait forever. I'm soooo annoyed so I decided to go to the Popeyes next door as soon as I go to the Popeyes someone else goes to the Tropical Smoothie and the same gentlemen with the neck tattoo that had me waiting forever  immediately greets this customer and takes his order. Maybe it's because I look young or maybe it's because of my ethnicity but this is ridiculous! I wish a manager or supervisor was on duty so I could bring this up to their attention. If this is the type of customer services you're promoting I doubt you'll have a successful business in the future.,jXyuoPNBP9F_pNuHBPtbzQ,1,0,1,GZqOPMtEgdhWkmIk0kxZ2A
5877547,2018-06-13,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,"Great place to get a quick, healthy, and affordable meal on the Strip. You can add a smoothie to any meal for $3.50. I had the jerk chicken wrap and an acai smoothie, both very tasty. The whole order cost me about $12, which is an absolute bargain in the Strip. Much healthier option than the rest of the restaurants in that food court.",MKEYo0Suwq58zdar-tl81w,0,0,5,107n94Y1esR2eUnXwsrFQg
5926359,2017-03-29,0,5ZyF-uAb4RVN05THprS3IQ,"Pretty impressed. It was a 40 minute walk from my hotel and I was quite glad I did it. I got the pesto chicken flatbread sandwich and a 'kiwi quencher' (strawberry kiwi with yogurt) smoothie. 

I was mega impressed with the sandwich. It was so good how hot it came out and the pesto quality was quite up there. They didn't skimp out on adding the pesto either and the cheese and chicken were both nice. Reasonable value for it at $5.99 too. 

I got the smoothie added which made my bill ~$11.50 (tax included). The smoothie was huge! (Though I'm told portions are usually bigger in the US?) I missed seeing I could add health boosters for 99cents a pop and might have done that. The smoothie was on the sweet side but not too sweet. It was also nice that the kiwi and strawberry flavours were well balanced.",xa0JIU4bhz44zXh9H2BmsA,0,0,4,67MMOq6pXGKhBUuoWqkyHw
