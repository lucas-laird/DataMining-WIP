Our server made a small snafu with our salad (unordered). It could've been our fault.
Out come the head hostess or manager with a slight European accent. She offered a complimentary dish. It wasn't necessary.  I just hate to waste food.

This location however has let me down time and time again this time was the last time I ever visit this location. SERVICE IS ALWAYS HORRIBLE HERE!!!! I can't even stretch this enough! It took him 45 minutes to realize he never put our order in then he wasn't even the one that brought our food out and we asked the two people that did bring out our food for things and no one ever got us anything. At the very end the manager finally came to check on us but by that time the ice in the drink was practically melted!! I will not be returning  don't go to this location I don't know if they are short staffed or what but it's been like this every time I go!,54K-qagWyy2P97LCgRZ5AA,0,0,1,OZ-6nKei4Bc8vymMlfyA4Q

I ordered car side to go last week and even told them I would go inside to pay because I know the girl is a little slow with bringing it out and noticing that the customers there. After standing at the to go desk for 10 minutes looking at my order I had to find the manager at the hostess desk to bring him over to pay.

No hostess and had to wait almost 10 minutes to get seated in a restaurant with 8 people total! Then after getting seated our server showed up took our drink order and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We placed our appetizer and entrée order. 15 minutes later our entrées showed up before our appetizers.  My burger was over cooked and fries were stale like they had been sitting.

The food was awful. I had the Orange Chicken bowl. I'm pretty sure they used sawdust to batter the chicken before they fried it. It was really poor. 

The music was loud and obnoxious. A complete mismatch with the octogenarians that filled the place. Mercifully for them, their hearing was probably dulled with the passing years. Sadly, mine has not. Also, I don't think most of them were particularly interested in the UFC review that was on the three or four TVs tuned to Spike TV.

 A bad apple spoils the bunch. Well, at this apple we had a great lunch!
  Seems that a lot of people think that the quality of the food at applebee's is not as good as other restaurants to the point that when they're reviewing a restaurants they didn't like, they  always say that the quality of the food was as bad as that of an applebees....STOP THAT! LEAVE APPLEBEE'S ALONE! Well, not really; You have to try the asiago pepper  corn  sirloin steak Served with steamed Herb potatoes and vegetables. wow! Is as good as any Delmonico's steak! ( :-) ) also you should try the grilled Dijon chicken & portobellos!  Mmmm as good as Mon Ami Gabi ( :-) ) ....I know; apples and oranges but that's my point.
  service was great, waiter (Alex) was friendly and food brought to us in a timely manner. Drink refilled constantly and waiter checked on us one too many times.
  This is a family restaurant but it has a full bar and they show most of the games, we got to watch soccer when I was there, couldn't be at a better timing! The place is very spacious and very clean, good for big families. And the best part! You pay Applebee's prices for (your favorite restaurant here) quality food. Usually you get what you pay for, but in this case you'll get more apples per pound. They also have the meal deal for two for twenty dollars! Wow! you can't even find that at your local supermarket. 
                                                                                                                    Now you know!",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,2,1,5,YMr49mWQMf9JG4VXXb1S6A

2268714,2014-08-19,3,8bYXg27QEoAx7us15eIL5g,"Stopped by for lunch yesterday because I heard they were doing AYCE crosscut ribs to promote the new menu item. The ribs could be ordered as a single order for $11.99 or AYCE for $13.99 so it's a no brainer which one I picked. Before showing up I was a little unsure what crosscut ribs were exactly...apparently they are a rack of ribs that have been sliced...which means the bones are flat shaped. There are 3 different sauces to choose from: Asian sweet chili, smokey chipotle and honey BBQ. They all sounded good so I was sure to try all 3 of them. The orders come with a full order of fries each time although the amount of ribs you get is less each time. The ribs were a lot more tender than I had imagined and they're definitely not as dry and chewy as rib tips or riblets at most other places.

Service was mediocre, mainly because I was seated at a table in the bar area so the lone bartender had to run around serving everyone. It took a while to get the server's attention each time but when I finally did, my refills and food orders came out pretty quickly. The manager saw that I was having the new ribs and stopped by to chat and see how I liked them

The restaurant overall was fairly clean and quiet, which is different than locations I've gone to in other cities.

So I gave her my order and we never saw her again. 25 minutes went by and we started to wonder where our food was, let alone our drinks. After about 30 minutes, possibly more, the manager came over to our table and explained to my boyfriend that they were out of the pulled pork they use on the burger he had ordered, and offered to use brisket instead. My boyfriend said that didn't sound satisfying and wasn't sure about that idea. The man insisted it would taste great, and described the brisket. My boyfriend explained that we were on a time limit as he had to leave for work, and how we really didn't have much time to spare as we planned to be close to done by then. The man said he would have the burger done right away. He decided to accept the offer, and the manager left us. We decided we did not want to wait for our food any longer, as it shouldn't take over 30 minutes to inform us that they are out of meat for an entree... So I tried to locate our waitress to cancel the order, and I found her standing behind a wall talking with other employees out of view. I guess those drink orders or vital information weren't really that important to her. I told her to cancel the order and why and she didn't apologize, she just said ""ok.""

When we walked in the place was practically empty, which was perfectly fine; that only means our food would come out faster haha. Now I have not been to an Applebees in quite some time, and from the looks of it, their game has been stepped up a notch, menu-wise.

I ordered the ""Build your own Sampler,"" you can pick any two for $9.50 or pick 3 for $12.50. I decided to get the ""Pick two,"" and ordered the Pot Stickers, and French Onion Soup. It was pretty good and satisfying.

We arrive around 7:45 PM on a Thrusday. The place was empty except for about 4 tables. We were greeted and seated quickly. It took the waitress approximately 10 minutes to finally come over and take our order. She was friendly and polite. She took our drink orders (there were 6 of us; 3 adults and 3 kids) which were pretty simple and we ordered our food (2 appetizer samplers and 2 kids meals) shortly thereafter. This puts us at about... I'll be generous and say 8:15. Then we waited about 30 minutes when finally I watched the table in front of me who was seated AFTER we had arrived get their meals and I finally said something. The waitress forgot to place our order! A man (Not sure who he was or what he had to do with the restaurant) brought us chips and salsa which weren't too bad and the bar tender brought one of us a free drink. Unfortunately, my kids and I waited 45 minutes until they finally brought our order and by that time we were very hungry. The food was decent (I mean... It's bar food). We eat it and we're finally finished. It's approximately 9:20 by now. I want to pay and go home but I can't because the pad at the table isn't working! The manager brings a paper bill with an appetizer sampler and one kids meal comped.. still with everything added up it was $55. Way too expensive and I guarantee I will never be back simply due to the fact their food is not worth $55. Then the table in front of us went berserk. They started yelling at one of the employees for having an attitude and talking about them and as the manager comes out, she thinks it's a good idea to sit down with this disgruntled and beligerant diner RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR TABLE. Isn't there a better place to meet for that? Like... Oh I dunno.... The CLOSED portion of your restaurant? Forget this place.

Came in was greeted by David who took our drink order. We asked what they had on draft but he did not know what was on draft so he had to go look at the bar area and came back. He came back 5 minutes after taking our drink order because he forgot what kind of beer we had ordered. When he brought our drinks we asked about the advertisement that they had on the table which stated that if the server did not offer a margarita you would get free churro. We mentioned this to him because he did not mention the margaritas and he claimed that he had mentioned them?? 
Hmm seriously? We let it go and continued to wait for our food.

20 minutes later the manager ""Deb"" came over and told us that the sandwich we had ordered couldn't be brought out because they didn't have enough meat for it but whatever we ordered instead would be on the house. Ok so we ordered something else and waited again.

10 minutes later some of the food arrived. One of the things that arrived wasn't what we had ordered, 2 of the other entrees didn't have both of the sides and we were waiting for the last 2 entrees. 

The remaining of the food FINALLY arrived and it did not look appetizing at all. We told the manager about our complains and she got defensive and told us that the entrees only come with 2 sides... But we only had one side and were missing the other one. She did not apologize or seem to care. Customer service was not there at all!!

Then we finally sit down and the server is polite and we order. Food comes out fast so we thought everything was better. Then we ordered dessert on a separate bill. Left the server a nice tip even though she hardly came around and drinks were left empty for a while with no checking up on us. 25 minutes later after flagging down a different busser we get the desert and ice cream is melted. We flagged down a different busser again to show him and waited again for ice cream. 10 minutes later we walked up to the bar to get the manager and the busser ran to us with the ice cream apologizing saying he had to do it himself. What happened to the server? She got a good tip for bad service. We were so annoyed we left. Sad considering we give them a lot of business and purchase gift cards with them and now I'm going to have to consider my other ootions.

The service varies from time to time. I have been where it was an empty restaurant and waited for 45 minutes before someone asked us for drinks and another 15 before we got up and left because the drinks never came...

I have also been where the service is great. We have a party of 20+ people at times and get excellent service.

I was shocked by the behavior of the blonde server named Erica. She was in a hurry for us to finish and leave. She stated that she gave us a side order of mac and cheese by mistake. I was done with my main entree and veggies and I  was really to stick my fork in the mac and cheese, she took the food right off my table and ignored me when I calmly asked ""Excuse me miss "". I went up front to pay as she ignored us after her taking food I was just about to taste.  I asked the dark skinned waitress to speak to a manager. Erica came by and said You are trying to make a scene.  I told the manager that this tattooed blond girl had three uncomfortable confrontations with me. Never apologized and was proud of her rude disgusting behavior. 

I had just had coffee and I am a cancer survivor that just went through a severe illness and I had to have an embarrassing confrontation with her and Jamie her manger. They acted the way they did as we were two disabled customers and they feel they can treat anyone different thus way.  It really gave me anxiety and a bad feeling for this holiday season. 

I would like a refund for her upsetting me.  I will a speak to corporate tomorrow morning 

The food was fine but nothing special.",-xv6AtkDv8zH3TD5FHh9sg,0,0,1,G8lE9ylBnXT4v73uR0s98Q

We had to wait 5-6 minutes for her to bring out a kids apple juice. 
Did not receive straws 
Received no plates for our appetizer, she walked past all three of us sharing boneless wings off of a small tin tray. 
Had to ask the host to get us ranch, plates and a straws after waiting  forever. 
I ordered a medium rare steak as my entree I received a near well done steak I sent the steak back and by the time I received my steak both of my sides had got very cold and everyone else was finished eating and had lost my appetite by that time. 
She checked on us a total of 3 times during the whole 1 hour and 30 minutes we dined in. 
She did not bring a printed receipt 
Half way through the meal our drinks were empty  
She did not offer a refill once. 
This was the most absolute worst experience I have ever had dining in 
Especially since I work at a Applebee's here local, serving. 
She did not follow the Correct procedures when it comes to greeting a table & getting drinks to the table in a certain  time frame. 
You are also suppose to refill drinks before the meal comes out 
FYI 
If it wasn't for the ted machine I wouldn't of known she charged full price for a kids 99 cent meal Tuesday.

The food though, it's Applebee's - expect mediocrity and you won't be disappointed. However, sometimes, they still manage to disappoint. 

Their fish and chips is nearly $13.00 for three small chunks of fish and a small order of fries. Not worth it at all. The steak was a bit tough and not that flavorful. 

For pre-prepared food, heated to order, it isn't horrible, but not really good either.
