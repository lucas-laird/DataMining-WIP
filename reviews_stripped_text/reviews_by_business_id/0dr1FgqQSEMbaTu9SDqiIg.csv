55108,2016-06-20,0,0dr1FgqQSEMbaTu9SDqiIg,"This was my first time eating from this establishment. I ordered Combo Fried Rice & Chinese Chicken Salad.  Below is the content of the email I sent them after partially consuming the Combo Fried Rice, the remainder of which went in the garbage. I don't know about the salad because I was not able to eat after the rice.   

Initially, I thought anyone could have a bad day and that I would not post a review, but contact them by email to state my dissatisfaction and follow up with a phone call so they could discontinue serving that rank pork.  However, when I called the gentleman who took my call blamed me because I ordered it at 11:30, but was calling 2 hours later.  I explained to him that the food was not delivered until 12:30 (as stated 40- 55 min for delivery) so he could just stop it because we know that it did not go bad in 1 hr. or 2 hrs. for that matter.  He then went on to tell me how fresh the food was etc...  I explained that I was not calling to get anything from them, but just asking that they do not give that meat to anyone else.  The guy wanted to continue the debate and I expressed to him that I had initially decided not to post the review, but since he did not think it was necessary to do anything about the bad meat that I felt obligated to post the review.  So here you have it:
    
The pork in the Combo Fried Rice was old and should have been thrown away.  I am sick and tired of restaurants that chance getting people sick just to save a nickel or dime, especially in delivery orders that are not likely to be returned.  Guess what?  You save nothing if people are afraid to eat there.  Not that it matters to you, but now I have to try and make it through the remainder of my work day with a stomachache.  In the future I'll stick to Panda Express.  People say it is not authentic, but I prefer that to ptomaine or botulism.  Throw the old stuff away.  It is not worth someone getting sick",krzvjngykSZlMGPtVzDT5A,0,0,1,t57o0iZoE24npjiIYzQjwA

We ordered the Family Dinner B for $28. Only $2 more than the Family Dinner A, but you get a much better selection of entrees, plus two fried shrimp. If you are into seafood and want some variety, definitely go that route.

For our appetizers, we got 2 egg rolls, 2 crab rangoon, and 2 fried shrimp. Nothing special, but they held up well after the delivery. For the entrees, we had shrimp with snow peas and Kung Pao combination (chicken, beef, and shrimp) with fried rice. The rice was undercooked and a bit bland, but the entrees were both really good, although they both needed salt. And, oh yes, did I mention the soup?

By far the best part of the meal was the soup. We ordered the wonton (the other choice was corn egg flower). As the menu describes it: ""Chicken wontons with vegetables, chicken, BBQ pork, and shrimp served in light house broth."" As  I describe it: ""One of the best soups I have ever had. No lie!"" This was more like a stew than a soup. It was so hearty that after eating our appetizers and polishing off the soup, we couldn't even crack into the entrees and had to save them for the next day!

So, overall, for $28 (plus a hefty delivery charge), we each got one excellent meal and two pretty good ones. If you dine in, you can save the delivery charge. But if you order Family Dinner B like we did (and I heartily suggest it), be prepared to bring home a lot of leftovers. And make sure to order that wonton soup. I promise you will not leave hungry--or unhappy!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,gl8gugBb70HoQYcTzBUrFA

I haven't ordered the nice looking stuff but my body was feening for Eggplant. Well, Lo and Behold, they had eggplant and tofu on their spicy menu. Eggplant in real life it looks disgusting, I gotta admit it's not the greatest presentation. It even feels disgusting in your mouth because it's slimy. But if you close your eyes and imagine that you are in heaven, you will find that Eggplant tastes amazing. Of course the secret is getting rid of the bitterness by adding salt and letting it sit so that the bitterness comes outside.

Back to the review, this dish is off the friggin chain. For 9 bucks you get something healthy and your body feels refreshed the next day. Tofu was a bit small compared to the eggplant but no big deal. 

I totally recommend this dish for those that want something different from your regular Chinese Veges..

Beware of eating the red peppers though. Tread lightly if you aren't a fan of spicy.",LkhRU5nX6i4CSjVpyZZM3A,0,0,4,8J7JOM6H_7X6h5vzSo6sMQ

1. Fried rice: There's a reason why this is first, I LOVE their fried rice. I sometimes order a whole pan. Reason mostly for the four stars.

4. Orange chicken: Family favorite. Great orange flavor. 
5. Chow Mein: Who gets bored eating this? Not us!
6. Crab Rangoon: Needs more cream cheese
7. Wor Wonton Soup: The wonton is always the first to go, the rest are left overs so I only order this occasionally.

They had obviously had shellfish near my food or used the same wok after cooking shellfish. Once I got home I called them to tell them about my experience. Their response was ""you're the first person this has happened to. We use one pan for all dishes but we clean it and there's a big fire"" . That's when I knew I was right! I told the manager he needed to add a disclaimer for those with allergies on the site because I figured if i wrote no shellfish in my order twice, that would be accommodated. He jumped around that suggestion and offered me a credit and to put ""is really allergic to shellfish"" under my phone number. Because I obviously want to go back to the hospital....

I gave 2 stars because the service was fast and pleasant.  Panda Express would be considered ""gourmet"" compared to what I got.",NXaIkd4sEMDiXlfHOJkO8Q,0,0,2,Jhz_s9iySchOX83TrZyx8w

Ordered food tonight with my Man at 8:49pm hence they close at 9:30pm. So,we made sure it was okay to order food given the time.
 The guy on the phone said it is still okay to place order for delivery  -we were quoted 15 minutes after placing the order.  We waited outside for the delivery- it didn't come. We called them at 9:25 getting concerned about the closing time. They said wait 10 more minutes. We waited and by 9:45pm we called back and got an answering machine. We decided to head over there. We caught 2 of them leaving the shop at 10:00pm. We told them that they were not very honest with us and that they better be sure to refund the debit transaction that they hit us up for and that we will eat dinner elsewhere. We do not trust that the food was even safe to eat. Did they spit in it and screw us over and make us wait an hour and ten minutes because they don't give a shit about the business they work for and the customers? How can we trust them??
The delivery guy was calling my cell phone at 10:02 while we were actually at China A Go Go, He was claiming he was at our home-but we were not trusting that he was truly at the house since they gave us the run around already with the time frame and lack of communication & lack of accuracy on delivery time that we were quoted. We are very disappointed in this bad service and will reach out to the owners to inform them of what happened. We came home to the food on the porch after we ate at Taco Bell. WHAT THE HECK???

3701304,2018-04-22,0,0dr1FgqQSEMbaTu9SDqiIg,"First time ordering delivery from here through EAT24.

The lunch specials on the EAT24 site clearly says it comes with ""a choice of rice AND chow mein"". When you click on the lunch special, it gives you an option of choosing between steamed rice and fried rice. Based on common knowledge of the English language, that means you get to pick the type of rice you want AND you will also get a standard chow mein.

The food did not come with chow mien. Called the store to correct it, the lady said it was MY FAULT since the order said rice only. You programmed your menu on this site and advertised that the dish comes with both rice AND chow mein. How is it my fault that the program only prompts the choice of rice?? Was I supposed to add the note ""Hey, I'd really like to have the chow mein that already comes with your lunch special with the rice choice you also offered.""?? The receipt clearly shows the word ""lunch"" at the end of the item, you'd think they would know what comes with their own lunch special.

She refused to do anything to correct the error and stood firm that it was my fault that my receipt didn't say chow mien under the lunch special items. HA! What a joke.

The food itself was another experience. Corn egg flower soup was so bland, it was practically just water and cornstarch warmed up. Never had dry orange chicken until now.

Not ordering again from this shady business who won't deliver what they advertise. Awful customer service and sub par food. Thanks. For. Nothing.",7QLwWlojfQP0KUZrRRJwlw,1,0,1,RPrW51yvFeNY6pC61K9cSA

The food was very... meh. Both chicken entrees were dry and the Chicken Teriyaki was swimming in watered down sauce. The pot stickers were okay, big but not a lot of taste. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was just okay too, it to didn't have a lot of taste and it was more breading than shrimp.

The delivery took an hour and the food wasn't piping hot or even mediumly warm upon arrival. 

We received a couple of forks and some napkins, no soy sauce and no spicy mustard. I have never seen a Chinese delivery service not send soy sauce or at least one packet of spicy mustard. If I was to reorder, which I'm sure I won't you have to spell it out if you want any standard extra items. I will be on the look out for a better delivery Chinese place. This was bland, luke warm and totally tasteless. If the food had been hot the crab rangoons weren't bad, nor were the egg rolls.

Now, I know that they're are a lot of good reviews for this place, but just like every other cuisine you may try, individuals get a taste for how certain things are best tasting to themselves. My fried rice was rather bland from what I've come to expect from fried rice. The Cashew Chicken would've been really bomb, but they put a lot of ginger in the dish, and I just don't care for the overpowering taste of that root. The star of the meal was the noodles. Perfectly cooked and garlicky, they had the perfect balance, and I finished those before I was halfway done with the Chicken or the rice. 
It was nice and clean inside, the wait was short, and the people working there were very friendly.

I ordered Kung Pao Shrimp and added mushrooms, medium spice level, brown rice, a side of egg rolls and pot stickers. My family used to own a Chinese restaurant back in the Midwest for 25 years, Chinese takeout in Vegas has been very disappointing, so this is based on that. The veggies were fresh, shrimp was large and fresh as well! Pot stickers were seemingly homemade - which I enjoyed and for the long wait time, the egg rolls were surprisingly crisp. As for the flavor, the pot stickers and the egg rolls were pretty good, the Kung Pao Shrimp was a little lack luster on depth, a bit greasy, & what I would consider a little too spicy for a diner's ""regular"" palate - I can handle spice though. Added some soy sauce and a bit of salt/MSG to waken up the flavor and it was okay... :/ The sides were tasty, and the visual appeal of the Kung Pao Shrimp was exciting...so I was disappointed by the sauce in this dish.

I'm from New York, and this is as close to ""New York style"" Chinese food as I've found here. They also appear to have New York style ""chow mein"" (which, in New York, consists of some either shrimp, chicken, or some other meat, with vegetables in a gooey white sauce...not a noodle dish).

The wait staff was friendly and super attentive. They frequently came over to make sure everything was okay.

The only down side to this place is the lack of a vestibule (set of inner and outer doors) to provide a buffer from the elements. When the doors open in the winter, you get a blast of cold air, and when they open in the summer, you get a blast of hot air. So, the restaurant can have uneven temperatures, necessitating the use of a jacket or sweater in the winter.
