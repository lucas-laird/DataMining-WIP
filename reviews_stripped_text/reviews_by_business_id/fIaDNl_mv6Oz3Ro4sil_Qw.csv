but all my coworkers rave about it, I prefer there chicken burrito instead. I love how they make there burrito here with rice, beans, pico degallo, and cilantro. Every time I order I usually request for extra cilantro and less on the rice and it comes out perfect. 

    There papusa is good here also, I like the cheese filling but the other variety are good as well. Make sure you order 2 atleast cause the portion is small, I could probably eat 5 of the papusa alone but I wont lolz, it's hella greasy. The only complaint I have here is the location, horrible parking especially during afternoon. But if you work in this area, el steak burrito is worth the visit. Good food and good service.",L37Sl7MNYnyugc-682LQwA,3,0,4,WyONVgjEpKlt_h9MVyWF9A

1993546,2014-11-05,5,fIaDNl_mv6Oz3Ro4sil_Qw,"Homestyle Mexican food- the only thing Americanized about their namesake steak burrito is the flour tortilla. It's packed with a bit of Spanish rice, a not-overwhelming amount of beans, a good portion of slightly-charred steak, and a handful of cilantro and onions. They also offer tacos and a breakfast menu.

The other star here is the pupusas! Window art states they were once voted best pupusas in the city-I've only tried the revueltas, but they're spot on. Thick and filled without being skimpy or overpriced (about $2/each), good-sized and not too greasy. Several varieties to choose from, too.

Service is adequate- wait might be a bit longer than you're used to, but they make their pupusas fresh which is way better than any other option that may save you a few minutes. Dining room looks like it's furnished with the tables and chairs from someone's own dining room, which gives it an oddly homey feeling.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,5,3,-D2vZKoRt-UBfhQGD31Nvg

I ordered an asada burrito with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. All the ingredients tasted nice and fresh without being greasy.  They also use arrachera asada instead of the cheap card board asada stuff you get at most places. Will eat here again next time I need to meet my personal burrito quota.",sxUny2uxvw95VbUpm1YVSQ,2,0,5,MBjjPg0C8fsvo6RKoxn2tw

5698137,2018-01-19,0,fIaDNl_mv6Oz3Ro4sil_Qw,"What can I say about El Steak Burrito? Well, this place is a family institution that has been around forever (I believe it was sold to a different family). I used to come here with my dad in the early 90's, we always came in the mornings for their breakfast burritos. They used to only be open till around 2pm, now they are open later I think till 8pm. I don't know if just the nostalgia of the place for me but their burritos are amazing, something about the steak just makes it feel like it was cooked in my Mexican step grandmas kitchen, as well as the rice! The rice is moist and fresh and has a consistency that just fills the burrito perfectly. Now, one thing I miss is that the salsa changed, I think this is due to the newer family that owns it, though it is pretty close it's not the same salsa I remember as a kid.
