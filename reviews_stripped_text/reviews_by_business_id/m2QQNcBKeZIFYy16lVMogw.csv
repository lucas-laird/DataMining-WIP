Went through the drive thru... said specifically as follows... 1 six finger combo with canes sauce and honey mustard, was told it only comes with 2 sauces and others would be additional, said ok and said 2 additional honey mustard. 

Then wanted a 3 finger combo with canes sauce and honey mustard. 

Got the order and only had 2 honey mustard sauces.

The girl working there whose name was ""Craig"" said she only charged for 2... and we said we had asked for 4. We'll we had said the order correctly.. then we were charged $1.07, had to take out our canes order, returned one of the canes sauces and got another honey mustard.

2676042,2017-03-08,1,m2QQNcBKeZIFYy16lVMogw,"Came here on Sunday because it was close to where my daughter's soccer tourney was. A menu of nothing but chicken fingers sounds pretty simple right? It is, until you have a giant menu full of chicken finger combos with different amounts of fingers to choose from. Luckily, a young man by the name of Johnny must've noticed the deer in the headlights look we had when staring at the menu, and he pretty much broke it down ""Barney style"" a la ""Ordering Chicken Fingers for Dummies"" and helped us survive the whole ordering process. LOL. For that, I am grateful, because Johnny's customer service skills were on point, and for that reason alone, I'd come back to this location should I be in the area next time I'm in town.

So the chicken fingers on this particular day were perfectly breaded and didn't need any seasoning, especially when paired with their ""Cane Sauce"". Not sure if they're all the same or if there's different, but ours were white meat (chicken tenderloin). Chicken was moist and not dry at all. The crinkle cut fries weren't anything special in the sense that they did something different to them to give them some kind of OMG wow factor, but they were crispy and perfectly salted. Garlic bread wasn't very garlicky, but not too shabby either. My favorite side was the coleslaw, which pushed the limits on the amount of mayo in it without overpowering it.  

The four of us decided on sharing our combos, so we got The Box Combo, which is 4 chicken strips, texas toast, coleslaw, fries and a drink, and The Caniac combo which is six strips and it wasn't enough food for a growing boy, a soccer player and a daddy with a bigger appetite. If you don't eat like a bird, I'd recommend getting The Caniac on your own.",eJBDhJRZhuL49rCNh_QnMQ,1,1,4,solc0iEy2qQ0IJoOxr9RHw

The fingers were good, larger than the ones at Guthrie's. The fries were good, the toast was so-so, coleslaw (I don't like coleslaw, so I'm not one to judge, my coworkers say it's good)

The staff was great, I actually thought they were overstaffed (it's hard to tell, the kitchen was full of people, but they do catering, so some of the people might be there to support that). Anyway, it made for a great customer experience. They greeted me when I arrived. The girl who took my order, delivered my food to the table when it was ready and asked if I needed anything. The other counter girl was out cleaning tables, stopped by my table, asked how everything was, we talked a bit, she offered to refill my drink. Again, the staff here was great.

I typically don't give 4 stars to fast food, the service here was over the top, they deserve it. I will definitely go there again.

I can't believe the difference in customer service, between two stores of the same business. By comparison, the Cane's at Decatur and Charleston, act as though they are doing you a favor to take your order, yell your name when it's ready, so you can go and get it and I have never had anyone ask if everything is alright, let alone offer to refill my drink.

That being said, we decided to stop by this location on Sat May 21st after our kids' football game, around 6:30pm. My stepson loves Cane's and has had it several times in the past. He ordered the 3 finger meal and he was the only one in the family who ordered food from there. Around 10pm he started vomiting multiple times within a very short period, followed by pretty severe GI issues. I think you know what I'm referring to. Poor guy was miserable all night and was in bed most of Sunday and had to miss school today. 
When I called on Sunday the girl who answered the phone was very sweet, apologized and asked if I wanted to speak to the GM, so I said sure. I prefaced the conversation by saying that I was not looking for compensation I just wanted to let them know in case they needed to do something procedural on their end, i.e. overseeing food handling practices, etc. The GM was polite but when I told him I didn't want anything just wanted to let them know, I got the impression by his tone that he didn't understand why I was calling and that he did not believe my stepson had gotten sick from there. I asked if they prepare all the food there and he said yes, and that it is ""delivered fresh."" ""Delivered fresh?"" Oh so you don't order from the salmonella farm? Ok, good to know. Look dude, I don't think anything was done on purpose but my kid did get sick from your chicken, just wanted to let you know so you can step up your practices so someone else doesn't get sick. He offered no apology but asked if I wanted him to notify corporate. If I wanted that I would have contacted them myself. 
We will continue to go to Cane's because all of our other experiences have been positive, we just won't go to this one. I've read other reviews on this store and it sounds like they need to step up their quality of food and customer service.",XvU92R-Er-5MwzpSgQEeSw,2,0,1,iOtv42VT43fSJ8ziSB0rKA

The chicken fingers here are fresh, never frozen. I ordered the ""3 Finger Combo"" priced at $5.99 and it included 3 chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, cane's sauce and a drink. The fingers had a great flavor and paired well with the cane's sauce. The texas toast was delicious and tasted great in the cane's sauce too! The fries were not that great. I'm not usually a fan of crinkle-cut fries anyway however these were kind of too crunchy outside and too dry inside. My hubby had the ""Sandwich Combo"" also priced at $5.99 that came with 3 chicken fingers, lettuce, fries, cane's sauce, a kaiser roll and drink. He assembled the sandwich to his liking and said he really enjoyed it, but he wasn't a fan of the fries either. One thing I wonder is why there isn't an option for spicy chicken fingers on the menu? Maybe one day I hope! For my drink I had the sweet tea and let me tell you... it's addicting! The sweet tea is brewed fresh and goes so nicely with the chicken!

As with most Raising Cane's in town, the drive-thru can be long. It's basically similar to waiting in a In-N-Out Burger drive-thru. Since they are making everything fresh, I don't mind waiting. The cashier was very friendly and told me about the Caniac Club where you can earn rewards with each visit. Next time you are at a Raising Cane's just ask for a card! Once you have your card, go online and register it and get a free ""Box Combo"" just for signing up! The box combo includes everything I had in my 3 finger combo, but you get the addition of 1 more chicken finger and a side of coleslaw. Score! They also offer a kids meal as well ""Tailgates"" which are party packs of either 25, 50, 75 or 100 chicken fingers that come with sauce.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,26,22,4,lEGdgTgrCT2wsAz_2fGdAQ

This Raising Cane's is about the same distance in the opposite direction as the one we usually go to from our house.  Funny enough, this one is right near an In-N-Out too!  Smart real estate I say, place yourself near an establishment that has a guaranteed customer base!  If you like burgers and fries, you might like fingers and fries as well!

This location is pretty consistent with any other Raising Cane's I've visited.  Same type of building, same type of décor, lots of red, lots of memorabilia, and lots of pics of dogs!  Although at the one we frequent more I do enjoy that Chuck Norris poster, always gives me a chuckle.  Come on, when Chuck Norris does a push up...he's actually pushing the earth down??  Yeah, very Zen!

Food, at least in my experience is consistent as well.  I usually stick with the Caniac Combo to share with the wifey - sub out coleslaw with an extra Texas Toast.  Six chicken fingers, large fries, toast, two Cane's Sauce, and a large drink?  Not much color for your diet, but damn near finger lickin' good!  The best way to enjoy Raising Cane's is dining in.  You can tell if you get the freshest food made in the freshest oil.  Fingers and fries will be crisp but not greasy, and the Texas Toast will have a nice crunchy crust.  Dip all this goodness in Cane's Sauce and hot sauce!  If you take Cane's to go you can sometimes get disappointed because the steam in your box can cause the fingers and fries to go soggy, and get your toast wet.  I've had it before to go and it's just not the same!  If possible do dine in!

Gotta love a place that serves Coca-Cola.  But even better, sweet tea!  Raising Cane's makes some decent non-alcoholic southern comfort in a cup.  I like to mix half sweet tea with half unsweet tea.  Not too sweet, and also saves on some empty calories.  Because when eating at Raising Cane's we all should be watching our figure!

Service was speedy and polite.  Our order was done and ready in about five minutes.  I'll be back as long as they keep up the quality of food, service, and of course the Coca-Cola!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,2,4,U4m5opsGllWdZLP24efauA

The chicken is great, which is good because that's what Cane's is known for. The sauce is pretty good too. And I do enjoy the ""toast"" (half of a New England style hotdog bun), when it's warm. 
The Negatives:
The fries are soggy, ergo under cooked. 
The slaw is runny, and as another Yelper stated, bland as hell. And it seems to be the only available side other than the aforementioned soggy fries. 
The fact that you have to pay extra for those sauce is ridiculous. I'm buying a meal, gimme some extra sauce for pity's sake, what does it cost? Pennies? 

In short, go there for the chicken, that's it. Maybe the toast of you hit them in a good day...but pass on everything else.",gyXhihy6SoaAIQr49MEUsA,2,1,3,fBLX5a2VrZ_u6oucMZOPUA

Watching for about 15-20 mins while I ate it became apparent that the loudness comes from 1-2 of the people.

Today was the grand opening for this location.  I have been counting down the days to the opening for about a month now.  I swung by today to check it out and I was pleasantly surprised.  The building itself is beautiful.  Well designed and makes the neighboring places look old in comparison.  The inside is the usual motif of all of the other Raising Cane's and looks great.

Now the important part!  The food!  I got The Box Combo and was happy as usual with my lovely lunch.  Everything tasted great and was up to the normal standards of the other Cane's I have visited.  Nothing super special, but exactly what you want when you go to Cane's.

The staff was also great as well.  Everyone was super happy and welcoming.  Everyone seemed to still be figuring out running the place, but they made up for it by being so pleasant to talk to and deal with.

The sauce is even better.  The cole slaw is a classic style creamy slaw.  The sweet tea is the best this side of the Mississppi.  The texas toast is light and fluffy with the perfect buttery toast marks.  You really can't go wrong.  I usally get a Box Combo which is four fingers, cole slaw, fries, toast and a drink.  It is just the right amount of food and an OK price.  Maybe a little much when you consider it is just simple finger food but still worth it once you taste everything.  As a little tip, try the sauce on the fries.  I think that is even better than the sauce on the fingers.

An interesting little note, Cane's is a strong supporter of the community.  As I understand it, each store has a charity they donate too.  Some times even an entire days profit.  That is pretty cool.  As if their food wasn't good enough they give you this reason to support them as they support so many others.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,2,4,qSLP-YJ5Ckekn9s5zOhLLg

I can guarantee this though, from now on when the employee tells me to pull up front to wait, I will put my car in park right there and then and see if they like making ANYONE behind me wait for ""Hot & Fresh"" fast food!

This review is more for a server (than the food or general service) because I am getting really tired of inattentive clerks.

I had to give my order to Marco three times because he just wasn't paying attention:  two 3-finger combos to go, no drinks.  First got kids meals, after that correction, got the bill with beverages, then eat-in and, FINALLY: two 3-finger combos to go, no drinks.

This happens so often that a clerk is supposed to be serving you and they are talking to others, not listening to what you say, etc.

PLEASE, employers, train your staff to give their customer their undivided attention, it is part of what we pay for and it is annoying to have to give an order 3 times because the server isn't listening.

5260162,2013-10-31,0,m2QQNcBKeZIFYy16lVMogw,"OK. Raising Cane's is just about one of my favorite places to eat at. Way back, years ago when I lived in TN, there was a place called Sawyer's. The owners readily admitted that they were blatantly ripping-off another restaurant (from FL, I believe). I think they were talking about Zaxby's, but having never eaten at one, I can't be certain. But the point is, copycat or not, they had insanely good, near-addictive food. Then, after it was sold off, the quality took an immediate nosedive and Sawyer's closed down. A place called Wishbone's stepped-in, opening several locations within a couple of years. I also knew the guys who owned this place and they also readily admitted to copying Sawyer's, right down to the dipping sauce, but these guys were kind of the slimy, slumlord types and, while pretty good at first, their corner-cutting and blasé attitude quickly manifested itself in pretty crappy food and I couldn't bring myself to eat there anymore. Then, I moved to ATL and found a burger joint called Canyons that also, while not what they were trying to be known for, had amazing (fresh, hand-breaded) chicken fingers, crinkle fries and that awesome sauce on their menu. The burgers were quite good, but they just couldn't compare to that chicken. Then I was banished to Carson City for far too long and nearly forgot how (if done properly) wonderful something as simple as fried chicken fingers could be. Then, I moved to Las Vegas and discovered Raising Cane's! Hallelujah! This place does it just right, freshly-made chicken, crisp, hot crinkle fries, that delicious dipping sauce and a glorious side of Texas toast! (Like with the other places, they also serve cole slaw, but that's just not my thing.) Everything is so simple, but so perfect. I'd eat here everyday if I could. The food is unfalteringly-fresh and tasty and the staff have always been extremely friendly to us. Yeah, maybe it's just fast-food fried chicken, but it is really, really good fast-food fried chicken...and exactly what I've been looking for for a long, long time now.

5956982,2015-06-09,0,m2QQNcBKeZIFYy16lVMogw,I received service for Dylan W. He was very helpful and very nice working the window! I ordered the Caniac box and substituted the slaw for extra canes sauce with no problem. All around the food is really really good. Little on the unhealthy side but I love it! Good place to goto with friends! I had trouble on the website on how to activate my canes card for points. Definitely going back.,5MBLtbM6maAUdth1ape-OA,0,0,4,9ZJvDsqbN4P5ySsjvwrrAw

Waiting quite a while in line and this very energetic fellow (Nathan) took my order. When I got to the window, the girl was very dry and lacked personality. Ordered 2 sprites to go with, got sprite and coke even after correcting them 3 times. 
Service was slow, food was dry and didn't taste that great, bread was soggy. Sorry Caines, you don't get my recommendation. I'll give you guys a second chance sometime, but it'll be a while.",sNxhoIvKgkq72y1D8ZFnbA,0,0,2,aTg8_HYKfVSVEguJXACh3A
