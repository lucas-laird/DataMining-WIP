If you eat outside, you are right there and can see all the action which can be very entertaining. I had no complaints about the food or the service. They of course had a mechanical bull and it was fun to watch people attempting to ride it. My favorite part though, had to be the beer pong tables that you could play on. You could buy a pitcher of beer and play right there in the restaurant. No need of trying to find a way to play in your hotel room.

I don't think I have ever had such a sorry excuse for food in my life. The menu is pretty common, simple stuff, burgers, salads, sandwiches, aps. My boyfriend got the SIGNATURE burger and I got a quesadilla. Both were inedible. The burger was dry, bacon was tasteless cardboard. Even the fries unseasoned. My quesadilla was a hard crisp tortilla with unrecognizable meat. Even when I asked for ranch and hot sauce I was unable to eat my food.

The crowd ranges from college kids to midlife crisis OC moms and dads. Very diverse but everyone seemed to get along and do their own thing. We were pretty much there to pregame and replenish spending about an hour there. The open bar was from 9-1 with re-entry. A good idea is to drink at PBR and club upstairs at the Gallery if you're looking to dance or listen to music with a legit sound system.

However the manager was a dick the night of the Super Bowl that I highly recommend people go elsewhere unless they like being treated like shit.

After a great day/night of drinking and meeting new friends, my girl and I left with some ""to go"" food we ordered earlier that day. We spent $500 for an open bar, food and tip with $100 of that going to food. Since we couldn't physically eat that much food, we order food to go. It wasn't until we got home that we realized that some food was missing so we called the place back and spoke with the worst manager. He refused to give us his name so unfortunately we can't call him out. 

Essentially this guy told us to come back to the bar to pick up the food they forgot to give us (which was a good 20 min cab ride away) or too bad. After trying to be reasonable to ask them to deliver the food we just paid for, he apparently didn't want to talk any longer and hung up on us.

320010,2012-02-14,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"DO NOT GO IN THIS PLACE!!! I made a yelp account just to write this review for this horrid place.

I never knew I could get the WORST POSSIBLE SERVICE EVER, especially in Las Vegas. 

If you're thinking bout eating in here, TURN AROUND and go to Pinks just outside or Lobster me next to fat tuesday.

I ate here with my friends Friday 2/10/12 for breakfast and we were sure in for a treat. We got seated right away and asked for orange juices all around. 5 minutes later someone comes to take our order: 2 Classic Breakfasts, Sausage Biscuits, Bucket of Wings, Steak & Eggs, and Breakfast Skins (Potato Skins). Waiter comes back with waters all around, still no orange juice. 15 min later.. Bucket of wings come out; pretty good, not the best but still somewhat satisfying. (Still no orange juice)

20 minutes have gone by no orange juice and still no food at our table. We're getting restless and impatient. Since no one bothered to ask us for refills we asked one of the waiters passing by to see if our food was ready. Another 5 minutes later, our food has arrived. 

Classic breakfast - Eggs were cold. Not hot. Not warm. Cold. Tater tots cold. Bacon was the only thing even close to warm.

Sausage biscuits - You can tell by the look of congealed formation of skin on the gravy on the biscuits that it was only possible to achieve this look from sitting around too long. Not to mention that the biscuits were getting harder by the second. Hopefully they think twice before putting their biscuits in the microwave. 

Breakfast skins - Looks nice. No sour cream?? Potato skins were not even baked long enough, no crisp whatsoever. 

Steak & Eggs - Asked for medium rare, came out well done.

After all our food was delivered, we had to ask for our orange juices. We couldn't even finish our food because of the low quality of food and service. I don't understand how you can eat at a restaurant and not even get asked ""how's everything tasting?"" ""would you like refills?"" ""everything come out ok?"" not once. 

After we asked for the check the busboy had was cleaning the table, literally everything while we were still sitting down. Picking up silverware, napkins, dishes, and even wiping it down while we were trying to pay. Couldn't it have waited till after we left? 

I would never come back to this God-forsaken place. Worst quality of food. Worst possible customer service. Worst lack of integrity for a restaurant. 

Save yourself the time and eat at pinks 2 min away or lobster me down the walkway, you won't regret it.",Q6d8Tm4a2uaE42070aGFSA,1,0,1,2wfTRXK6hPgeEcUho2CyNA

We were staying at the Elara so the ease of  getting to PBR was easy. We just wanted a quick bite close to our hotel as we stopped mid getting ready to eat and didn't want to go far and take too much time out of our getting ready/pre game time. My friend and I both ordered half a rack of ribs with a side of fries and coleslaw. 

The reason why I've given this review 4/5 is because the food was delicious and it came out to us very quickly, the ribs were so meaty and tender. However, the general service was not very good. Our waitress was fairly grumpy, we straight away asked for ketchup and an extra plate to put the rib bones on. She brought them over about 3 mouthfuls before we finished our food. By that point I had already asked someone else. She never came over to ask if everything was ok. 

When it came to getting the cheque, I had to ask her twice because after asking her once she said yes sure and disappeared for 20 minutes! I would definitely return because the atmosphere was good, food was delicious and reasonably priced, but I won't expect outstanding service and I wouldn't return if I know I'm in a rush or have somewhere to be. If the service had been good, I would have given 5/5. The poor service definitely reflected in the tip I gave her!",hoEKniLqOqAMMF7fEiaT3Q,2,0,4,m1U1JolXbgrrqgJxr_L6Kw

I'm not  fan of cherry tomatoes and they happily replaced them with celery, upon my request, with no drama whatsoever. As for dessert, I don't do a lot of dessert, but I had to taste my dining companion's warm cookie with ice cream. Wow!  Fun atmosphere, too, and clever promotions - like Twitter Thursday.

What is up with breakfast being over at 11AM everywhere?  Anywho, we were told to come here for breakfast since they serve it all day.  The prices are high and breakfast was frankly pretty terrible.  The one saving grace from my $12 Country Scramble were the tater tots.  Tater tots instead of breakfast potatoes at first didn't sound too great but they were the best thing on there.  Really crunchy and actually tasted like potato instead of nasty powdered potato.  Boyfriend's french toast with strawberries was okay.  The $4 coffees seemed pretty steep, but it was coffee and it was good.  Overall, pretty pricey for bland, tasteless bar breakfast.

We went to this place since it served breakfast all day and was conveniently located. We ordered our food and awaited what we thought to be a great breakfast. Oh were we wrong. First off, I had a basic breakfast with eggs, bacon, toast and tater tots. The eggs were decent at best,nit sure if they were real eggs. The bacon had no flavor whatsoever and the tots were fried to a crisp. I had to eat them with my hands since I tried to use my fork and a few almost flew off my plate. Toast was the only thing on my plate that was good. I was starving so I ate most of it. My friend only touched his plate. When I told him to hurry and eat so we can start drinking he said the same exact thing I did. He ordered the Lumber Jack Scrambler and it had no taste whatsoever. Everything on his plate was bland as well with the exception of toast. Not much of a complainer but this pissed me off. Not off to a great start.",NaOqPbuzwLKYPyBs5U9BTg,0,0,1,-ipqAKeyEEKJQL0au88uEA

When I first reached out to group res for PBR the communication was mediocre, but at least constant. After about two weeks the communication became horrible. It would take me 3 or 4 emails for Regina to reply to me. When I would finally call she'd have no idea what I was talking about and it was a huge mess. When I finally got her to send over the CC authorization form she told me the prices went up. It took another two weeks for her to get back to me saying she'd honor the pricing I was sent. All the way up to the day before the event I was trying (sending multiple of the same email even from different emails) to contact her. 

The actual bar wasn't bad. Our day of contact/manager was Megan and she wasn't overly friendly nor was she rude. The only times I saw her was when we first went in and when she brought over the remainder of the balance. We had it from 7:30 to 9:30 and until 9 it wasn't very lively, everyone was sitting around and all of a sudden the lights went down and they started playing Rap/Hip Hop and it became PACKED. They opened the door from the main entry area and when we went to the bathroom the guy wasn't going to let us back in. He said our party was over and we needed to go get a stamp. He was rather rude about it. We had two bartenders; one was amazing! She never let my cup go empty and her attitude was great.",wKqAY23v7Lb3oatJfRW3Vw,1,0,3,BKdrFiPPIpzjD-V8FNh-Mg

My problem with PBR was the food and service...which is too bad given those are sort of biggies at a restaurant.

Sat outside in the lovely little patio right next to the entrance to the Miracle Mile Shops...great people watching.  Got a table quickly and all was well.

Server wasn't unfriendly, you could just tell he didn't care, at all.  We all have bad days, but the indifference was almost insulting.

Out of three meals, one was good (chicken and waffles), one was meh but okay (chipotle chicken sandwich), and one was awful (chicken mac and cheese)...it was a big bowl of mac and cheese soup...so watery my poor wife needed a spoon.  It's dishes like that which make you question if whoever is in the kitchen really cares.

PBR has the total right to serve that nonsense, but we for sure have the right to choose to not come back.

We looked over the menu and got started with their pepper poppers. They looked unappealing, and they were very greasy. The pepper was very tough, when you tried to cut into it, the filling spilled out.

Next, came our entrees the Big Bossman salad and the Bloomin' Onion burger. The burger is topped with cheese and fried, and then served with grilled onions, tomato and bacon. It was dry, dry, dry. How can that be? After the peppers the grease was too much to bear so I switched with my hubby a few bites in. The salad was wilted. It seemed like a bowl of mush. I was not a fan. The husband asked for their house cornbread muffins. The texture was off, but the flavor was decent, I liked addition of diced jalapeno. They were the highlight of the meal.

Service was average, and overall the place had an odd vibe. It's a great place to watch games, lots of nice TVs, but stick to drinks because the food is weak. PBR makes you think country, but much of the music was rock. I suppose it is a rock bar, but then they threw in pop like Katy Perry. Not sure how that fits.

Brought my five friends here for a going away party. Our first two servers were wonderful, friendly, and helpful. Our third server was a nightmare.

Most of us had the $10 open bar which was a good deal for the ones who were drinking. We shared an order of sweet potato tots that were really awesome and the chocolate chip cookie skillet which was great too. My friend chicken was dry and bland but I didn't mind so much. 

By the time we were ready to go it took about 15-20 minutes to flag down our server for the bills. It wasn't particularly busy either. When we got the bills a few things had been charged twice. Took another 5-10 minutes to flag down our server to fix this. She stomped away. Got the bill back again and divided it from there. We even wrote out the last four digits of each credit card number and the amount to charge to make it easier. 

When we got back our bills I find that mine has been charged a bit more than I expected. When adding it all up later in the evening (wish I had done it right there) I find it was charged an extra $15. Wouldn't be such an issue if that wasn't about 50% more than what I should have been charged. Not sure if there was an auto gratuity added onto just MY bill but if that was the case I should have been informed. Granted I probably should have figured this out before we left but by then we had waited over 30 minutes to pay and leave. We mostly just wanted to get out of there and I seriously doubted the server's competence in fixing the bill (even after a third try). 

I also come home to find an e-mail stating that they cancelled my reservation for no reason even though I showed up. Funny, I could swear the hostess had checked me in but apparently they cancelled me. How odd.

In search of a late night snack, we found ourselves at the PBR and somehow convinced ourselves that we needed to get a large portion of the Doritoes Mac & Cheese with a large side of fries.

The fries were not out of this world & soggy by the time we got them into our hotel (not even 10 minutes?). The servers weren't particularly attentive which was supremely odd because the bar/grill area was pretty empty (on a Thursday night?!).

OK we were doing the VEGAS thing so we decided to buy some of those HUGE drinks , 100oz or something like that. We had been Bar hopping for a few hours already and we came across PBR.. Went in and had a few drinks. On our way out one of the girls from our party eye balled the big drink she went up to the Bartender and asked if they were available; Rudely she answer, "" If they are there, then we obviously we have them."" Really lady, she was asking because you might be out of them, which by the way some other bar was. Anyway that's not the worst of it, we still ended up buying 3 of those things and the Girl from the bar asked if we wanted some extra shots for a few extra dollars, I asked how much alcohol the drink had already and she said "" not much maybe like 8%,"" For me that would be too low but for the 3 girls who bought the drinks they thought it would be ok so we did not pay extra for shots..... Wells Guess what???? The freaking drinks came with no alcohol to begin with, she sold us Virgin Drinks ad alcohol beverages. She is lucky we didn't find this out until we were long gone. Anyways PBR should had reimbursed us for those drinks, but I didn't feel like being an A-hole and getting the girl fired, because in my book that is consider STEALING........ and we tipped her SMH.

I ended up ordering a PBR Burger with french fries and my boyfriend ordered chicken fingers. After seeing the chicken fingers, I kind of regretted getting a burger. The burger was vooked as requested, but it just wasn't what I was desiring. The chicken fingers appeared to be panko breaded. My boyfriend also got the Doritos mac and cheese which really was just average mac and cheese with crunched Doritos on top... don't let your curiosity get the best of you here...the mac and cheese is not all that great. 

Honestly, the best part of my meal was the french fries. They were so crunchy and golden, just like I prefer them.

GOOD: Three eggs (not just your usual two) cooked overeasy and thcik cut baked cooked just right are perfect for offsetting last night's booze.  

BAD: The service here was pretty slow - seriously, how long does it take to make eggs and bacon and fry tater tots?  Also, there' s not choice of bacon or sausage just bacon.

UGLY: They were blaring rap and R&B before noon.  Isn't this supposed to be a country joint?!  Gimme my George Strait.",Fr_rLfBcfvVVXkLTanrkvA,0,0,3,c2ltN5XGhrbR-t9Ug2uoGg

Food was not only NOT good...  It was way overpriced and came out ice cold.

We both ordered the $25 combo plates w Mac n cheese and fries as side. Dorito crusted Mac n cheese would have been better if they'd used kraft out of the box. Gross.   The ribs and brisket were both very subpar. Friend got the chicken that was dry and cold.

We had tempura pickles (fried pickles) as an appetizer and they were great! So were the chips that came with it! The buffalo chicken flatbread was great, more than enough for one person! My parents had burgers and they said they were fantastic!

1555365,2012-02-20,2,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"Roaming down the strip with drink in hand - my roomie & i went all the way from TI/Mirage to PH/Aria. Naturally, parts of it were a blur, but all I can distinctively remember is my Napolean Dynamite-intense craving for tater tots. In my desperation, I practically asked every restaurant on the side of the strip if they served tater tots. 

But, we finally meandered our way to PH and found the ROCK BAR. My roomie knew of this place because she likes that the alcoholic slushies in the guitar/bud light containers. But, we didn't know they had food. Asked if they had tater tots, answered yes, & we were SOLD - or at least I was. 

And from my fuzzy memory, I recall a giant glorious basket of deep fried golden-brown perfection. I really don't think anyone should have that much starch + deep fried food in a 15 minute window. But, I snarfed those puppies down (smothered in ketchup of course) with the utmost satisfaction.

1625679,2016-04-29,2,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"My boyfriend was craving a breakfast sandwich and I suggested checking out the Earl of Sandwich. Since we had already spent quite a bit on lunch the previous day, we were looking for a more affordable option. When we discovered that the Earl quit serving breakfast at noon (and it was 1 PM), we ended up across the way at PBR Rock Bar. Stumbling upon this ended up being a pretty good Vegas find. 

I figured that I had already eaten enough junk for a week in my first day at Vegas so I decided to be good and order a salad. As soon as I noticed that PBR offered half salad orders, I was completely sold. Thank you for offering an option for lighter eaters! I can never finish a full restaurant salad and not only do they not typically hold well as leftovers but many Vegas hotels don't offer refrigerators to store leftovers either. Finally, I can confidently order a salad and know that I won't be wasting half of it. Also, by ordering a half salad, my Country Fried Salad decreased from a ridiculous $17 to a much less intimidating $10. The salad is topped with chicken tenders, tomatoes and cheese and I asked for the cucumbers and bacon to be removed. I also asked for a side of ranch instead of having the salad tossed in honey mustard. I'm not a fan of pre-tossed salads as they tend to get soggy. Although I thought the ranch was quite good at first, it lost some of its appeal throughout the meal so I know it wasn't quite the normal restaurant quality ranch that I love. Even at a half size, I could still barely finish it and I can't imagine what a full-sized salad would look like. 

The Tex-Mex Scramble ended up catching my boyfriend's eye and he chose that over the intended breakfast sandwich. The eggs with pepper jack cheese were served with tater tots and toast and it seemed to hit the spot for him as a great hangover food option. 

I noticed when I checked in that they were offering a Yelp special of buy one, get one drinks. Since my boyfriend claims that beer helps him get over a hangover, he was more than happy to partake in this deal. 

Our waiter was a little odd and very chatty but I think he meant well. He seemed like the type to get nervous, such as when our food was taking awhile to come out, and then talk to much to overcompensate. 

We also had a photographer stop by our table to take pictures and then, of course, try to sell them to us. At first, she offered them for $20 for two framed photos. When we said no, she then offered just the photos for $10. Normally, I'd still say no but the photos were quite good and it was a vacation so I ended up taking her up on the deal and finding my own Vegas frame in the Miracle Mile Shops.

Overall, I was very pleased to find a spot on the Strip with at least some more affordable food options and I'd definitely considering returning on a future trip.",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,6,7,4,gF1mBnAVbX61flqkZjGVqg

My boyfriend had the Fried pickle burger. I had a bite of his and liked it, but he wasnt crazy about it. Our waitress was extremely nice though [forgot her name, but a very tall blonde]. She brought him 2 kinds of BBQ sauce, both of which he wasnt crazy about though. [Hes a chef and very picky!] All in all, a good experience though!

We were greeted and seated immediately.  Kevin, our waiter, was over in a flash to get our drink order.  Let me just say that Kevin was an amazing waiter.  He was so attentive and friendly.  Our drinks were never empty and he was pleasant the entire time.   

Our food choices landed on the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Bucking Bull Fries.  We've previously had the pizza before and wanted to see if it was still to our liking.   Since the last visit, they changed it a little bit by sprinkling the blue cheese crumbles on top instead of the blue cheese sauce.  It wasn't as good as before but still ok.  The pizza itself is huge and can easily be spilt between two people... maybe even three.   We also split the fries which were completely covered by sautéed onions, bacon, cheddar cheese sauce and buffalo hot sauce.  Delicious!  Very messy but we just ate them with forks.  Overall the food was still good enough to dine again.

Dinner and a show?  There is a mechanical bull in the restaurant.  It's free to ride with your paid receipt.  Would I try it?  Probably not but there are plenty of others who aren't afraid to!  We even witnessed a girl in a skirt ride the bull.  It is Vegas right?  This is so entertaining watching people attempt this craziness!  Plus there are tv's everywhere in the restaurant.

Besides taking forever to receive our food, it wasn't correct when it came out. I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and was delivered a cheese pizza with pieces of chicken on it. After waiting 15 minutes to flag down my waitress and tell her it was the wrong order I was finally able to send it back to the kitchen for a new one. The server came back 10 minutes later with the SAME pizza and a side of buffalo sauce. I told him this pizza had tomato sauce on it and the one I ordered did not, it had buffalo sauce. Despite showing him the menu, he said the chef wouldn't make a different one. I was going to just suck it up and eat the pizza until I tried a bite of it and it was terrible. 

At that point I knew I didn't want it so I then had to wait another 15 minutes for the waitress to finally come back and tell her that I never got the right pizza. She agreed and I ordered a salad instead. Finally got the salad, and by that point my wife was completely done with her meal... which she thought was pretty terrible too.

1725697,2013-08-19,3,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"I would love to give this place fewer stars, but I can't... because of an amazing bartender named Emanuel. 

We started outside and the outdoor bar, but it started to rain, so we went inside. At the indoor bar, we were ignored for a good 30 minutes. All the while, we were attempting to capture the bartender's attention like we were drowning and she had the life preserver. Nothing. She was literally 2 feet from us and would turn her back to us to serve brand new walk-ups. 

After 30 minutes of neglect, we went back to the outdoor bar, despite the rain. I have a feeling it was because we had all-you-can-drink wristbands, but it doesn't matter. As we were walking out, the manager said, ""Thank you, ladies!"" (Thinking we were leaving.) I stopped and said, ""We're not leaving. We just can't get served in there, so we're going outside."" 

Here's what had me most taken aback - she ROLLED her eyes at me and walked away! No, ""I apologize. What can I get for you?..."" or anything of the sort. Must be nice to be in a position where you can afford to be blatantly rude to customers!

The experience outside was completely different. The bartenders were far busier outside, but they were conscious, attentive and friendly. The only reason I'm giving a decent rating to this place is because of our experience outside, especially with Emanuel. 

Bottom line is we drank 35 drinks between us and tipped more than average per drink, then left an extra larger bill for him at the end. 

I'm not even going to blame the indoor bartender because she's obviously being managed by someone with a horrible attitude and zero clue about customer service.

Thank you, Emanuel, for turning our experience around so quickly and for making my birthday VERY special!!!",KLX6I1nObmgkex8pbVMhEQ,6,6,4,lqQteS4oGYhZpwHG68ZF7Q

Thursday, April 14, 2017 They ate at their first American restaurant in Las Vegas which was PBR because they had a meal with a show offer.

They were told they could not order their food until 5 pm even though the show started at 7pm. The food came out late, it tasted ok and they ended up having to miss their desserts because they had to leave for the show. My sister in law (who is visiting the U.S) realized she had left her phone at the restaurant and was panicked and relieved to see that it was turned in at the hostess front area. As we got the phone, the waitress came us up at the front and told us we had an extra $6.00 charge after we paid our bill and gave her a proper tip even though the service as not good! Nasty surprise for us seeing as how she wasn't considered about the situation, only that we needed to pay 6.00 dollars. We gave her the cash and left.

We were taken there by my stepson and his friend who had eaten there before and honestly if we go back we WILL go again and will take whoever we are with!  We had dinner one night, and before we left Vegas we went back for breakfast.

So let me tell you about my two favorites there.  First off I think they are called Bucking Bronco Fries or something like that.  French fries, smothered in nacho cheese sauce, topped with bacon, onions, and of course a drizzle of buffalo wing sauce..OMG!!! I am going to attempt to make these, but I can't imagine I can make them like this!  Very large portions on everything!  Second I am a big omelet person, and so the first time we went for breakfast I didn't see one so we went elsewhere.  Finally I went, my husband wanted the fries again, and so I tried the breakfast burrito..AMAZING!  First off it is huge and PACKED with the fillings, I could not finish this.  The green sauce they put on top is simply the best and I would love to buy a freakin jar full of it!!!

I don't know how to review this place. I came here over the weekend, on Friday, and we came at like.... 12:30pm- maybe closer to 1pm.

We (really meaning I) were super hungover and ready to grub on some excellent food. Going against my better judgment, and my trusty yelp, we decided to go here instead of LaSalsas, mostly because we didn't wanna walk anymore.

We sat down outside; it was pretty cool actually. They have benches for larger groups and you are allowed to smoke on the patio. There is a huge bar in the middle of the patio with plenty of chairs around it. There were a bunch of TVs outside as well as inside, so I could see how this place would be a fun bar/restaurant  to go to when there is a big game or fight on.
 
The last time I came here, however, the service was shitty. They sat us down and we waited, and waited, and waited... and waited some more, and no one ever came to check on us. We finally went up to the front and had to beg the hostess to get us a waiter. She said she would work on it, but a waiter never came! So we left.

So, this is why I say, against my better judgment I went here again on Friday.
The service was BETTER, but not great. However, I will give our waitress the benefit of the doubt, and a cut her a little slack, because we did notice she was the only waitress working the patio that day.

That being said, the food... was... OK. It wasn't good. It wasn't bad. It was just OK. I got the breakfast burrito. It's drenched in a green-tasteless-trying-to-be-something-its-not sauce. It almost looked like enchilada sauce but it just wasn't. They have the option of adding meat, so maybe I should've done that, but I didn't and I was stuck with a pretty boring burrito.

I think that if I came back to this place, it'd be at night time, or for a game. But otherwise, I just can't do it captain.",Ker7FQc1DW3RK_WnqfwFBw,0,0,3,XLhrKUGMIn3SGPxGg-t_2Q

I had a salad, and he had the Mac n cheese. It hit the spot, but by 5-6am my stomach was blown up- most uncomfortable gas & digestion and we had to get up and go to catch our flight home. I forgot that in 2013 my girlfriends and I went there for an early dinner of apps & drinks during a girls weekend. We went about 5-6pm and literally right after eating, I was so uncomfortable after eating there, I had to go lie down for about 3 hours. We were to eat, go back get ready & go out.

My waitress was extremely slow and would rush us when asked questions about the menu. Once we received our food we never saw her again and had to go looking for her to get out check. I got the club sandwich and it was very poorly put together. There was hardly any of the mayo sauce and it was just in the middle of the bread and the rest of the. Read was dry. They chose large presentation over making a quality sandwich. It was below average. The views are awesome as the location is right in the center of the Las Vegas strip. If your not gonna sit outside and enjoy the views then there is no point in eating here in my opinion.

But the hostesses, oh my god, a total disaster, that is the young ladies that greet you at the entrances lacked intelligence, were rude, slow, unaware, condescending, argumentative, inefficient, unprofessional and hostile.

I came to the restaurant at 7:30 on July 9th. I was given one price for entry by the outside hostess but at the main entrance I was greeted with outright hostility and condescension by another two hostesses and was told the price was higher and was accused of lying.

Another hostess accused me of inappropriately touching her when my shirt cuff accidentally brushed against her. Finally once inside another hostess wanted to make sure we knew the people we were sitting with and stopped to make sure we weren't lying about knowing our table mates.

I am happy to provide a more detailed account to any member of the management team should they want to contact me. 

In conclusion, a decent spot to watch a fight with food and drinks that are not disappointing. But the staff that manages the entrances should not be working in the service industry and are hurting this business with their lack of aptitude, intelligence and basic host skills.",cDPE7YUODlv0na2-IJOh4g,2,0,1,YK8y-98pE5v44xn8nuj-hQ

2013240,2013-03-26,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"I stopped into the PBR Rock Bar on Sunday late afternoon to catch a hockey game and a bite to eat before making the drive back to LA.  I got there around 5 and found a seat at the bar in front of a TV that was playing the local news.  The two bartenders basically ignored me for a good 5-7 minutes.  They both seemed pretty bored and miserable, but at least one of them was hustling, so I respected that at least.  When one finally came over, I asked if they would turn the game on, because I did not want to order anything if they could not.  She said 'sure let me find out'.  A few minutes later the other bartender noticed me, and asked if she could 'help me'.  I said that I was waiting to see if I would be able to get the hockey game on.  She replied with ""no we can't do that.""  I was up and out of my chair, and it is a good thing the manager showed up then to turn the game on for me, otherwise I was gone and this review would have been much worse.  The manager accommodated me, but also seemed like she did not want to be bothered. 

The food was typical and pretty unmemorable.  I was debating between the buffalo chicken sandwich and the BBQ Cheddar Chicken Sandwich, so I asked the bartenders opinion (as usual), and she recommended the former, so I gave it a shot.  I had finally gotten her to lighten up and be a little friendly by this point by being the nice affable guy I am.  The sandwich consisted of frozen chicken dropped in a deep fryer and coated in buffalo sauce with toppings.  It arrived with the chicken half off of the bun with everything falling off of it.  It was not the most appetizing. I fixed it the best I could and some bites were pretty good with the crumbled bleu cheese nicely complimenting the buffalo sauce.  Mostly though, I was unimpressed.

The mechanical bull looked fun, but I was honestly a little turned off by the initial service and food. 
The patio looked pretty cool though and I would return for drinks and to hang out there if people were staying at Planet Hollywood, but I would not go out of my way to come back.",tAtq4BcRDyX3adjAdb2miQ,0,0,2,P565VpDvINyu0Rp6vPQRnA

We approached the waitress at the main restaurant and said we wished to get an order of wings to go. She said we could do that through the nearby Daiquiri Bar. What kind of restaurant doesn't allow the hostesses to place orders to go?! Ridiculous.

We sauntered down to the bar (a mere 5 feet away) and placed our order. When the server (Alisha H.) handed me my receipt, I asked about my change and she said that they don't give change and she assumed the dollar I'd mistakenly overpaid was a tip.

I'm not sure what kind of policies the PBR Rock Bar has implemented when the staff is stealing your money to get tips-- This is the direct reason for the one-star rating.

I've also e-mailed their GM and I've received no response yet in 24 hours. Honestly, with the treatment we received, I'm not expecting a response.

PBR also has live music, which can be loud and makes it difficult to have a conversation,but that's  a duh with any venue that has live bands. The service was slow that evening as it was difficult to get refills or order additional food/ alcohol. For my entree, I ordered the Baked Ziti which comes with bread. The portion size was decent, and the pasta was so-so. I also enjoyed an Angry Orchard Rose which is definitely a sweet drink.

I had the brisket sandwich which was quite terrible but would've gotten 3 stars if it weren't for Heather who tipped herself 20% even though her service was a 15% at best. The bottom of the receipt already has the calculated tips and she wrote in pen a total that gave her the 20% suggestion and circled the ""total"" which also incidentally nearly blacked out the actual printed total pre-tip. We gave her our two cards and told her $69 on one and $23 on the other. Not only was she incompetent and switched the cards (they're not even the same colors) but she charged extra to the one that was supposed to be $23 so that she bumped herself up from a 17% back to 20%. 

It wasn't that much of a difference at all, but it's the principle. Especially because she had me reiterate how much each card was supposed to charged. Besides the fact that she forced us to give her a 20%, she was rude to us from the start when taking our orders practically spewing venom. She was clearly having a bad day but geez if you're going to give yourself 20% you can at least be fake nice / pleasant or at a bare minimum indifferent.",0NCuqKZq3fFVRVDg98kK9w,2,0,1,AdhJNpLGq3Gti5upVI4wJA

For a whole pitcher of PBR, cups, and 2 pong balls costs $23; kinda pricey but it's okay! We had a fun time playing beer pong that afternoon. Also other people playing beer pong near us were fun and also helped us whenever we dropped the pong ball. After 2 games, we were just so done and tired. So much alcohol was consumed that afternoon.

2204944,2015-09-16,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"I'm torn between a 3 and 4, but I'll go with 3 because the food is average. 

I've been here a few times and the food and drinks have been fine. I would say come here to watch sports, have some drinks, and eat some bar food. 

When I've come here, I've ordered really strange combinations - mainly because I've felt like death from lack of sleep, loss of money, and nights of free booze. 

That being said, the best thing I've ordered there is the chicken noodle soup. Strange, I know, but it's really tasty and comes with grilled cornbread. The coffee is also good. 

I ordered the taco pizza this trip - soggy and lacked flavor. Don't get it. I also got a pb&j during a weird breakfast. The Texas toast isn't toasted and is giant so it doesn't allow for the gooey deliciousness that is a pb&j, plus they use raspberry jelly. It should be grape at any respectable establishment. Slightly kidding. 

The wings are pretty good. You can get some of those and not be disappointed. Oh, and the Bloody Mary is also enjoyable. 

Shots here are huge if you're looking for drinks. Just huge. Dangerously so. Shooters appear tiny next to a shot, but they're the right size. 

The staff is friendly and attentive. It's a fun environment. They've got beer pong and bull riding. You'll need to eat when you're partying and this place is just as good as any other bar you could stumble into.",IeWFnxmk344iIbl5-M5RPw,0,0,3,cljKNfrSSM6DwrXKHzkvIw

I'd had my first full day in Vegas and was craving a spot to eat that wasn't inside under a fake sky. We wandered down the strip, my feet getting sorer and sorer in heels, and we spotted the PBR Rock Bar & Grill. I thought there's a patio, I can hear some good music and there are empty tables, DONE! We sat and waited, waited, waited... no service. So my mother pops up and goes to the bar, thinking she'd order us a couple of drinks and some water (we were real thirsty, 24 hours of air travel the day before will do that). They told her that she had to sit down and wait for a server. We could actually see people going up to the bar and being served, but apparently we were in a service area. So we kept waiting. Still nothing. At this point I was close to hysteria. I'd had about 10 hours sleep in the last three days and I was hungry and thirsty, these things are not a good combination. She went up again and was told ""Ma'am please do not come to the bar again, someone will come to serve you."" We were almost ready to walk about when a young guy came buy, bringing out someone else's food. We dragged him over and begged him to take our order. He said that he couldn't but thankfully he sent someone right over. FINALLY. Normally I'm pretty relaxed about this kind of thing, people are busy, they're doing the best they can, bar girl was just following the rules blah blah blah, but it should not be that hard to get a glass of water?

We couldn't decide on entrees so ordered a bunch of sides, the corn was awful, but the macaroni and cheese with doritos was super delicious, mashed potato wasn't hot enough, coleslaw was just coleslaw from a packet. Beers were big and well priced.

A couple of bars in the dancing area with the dj and karaoke which make getting a beer or drink easier to access. There's also a completely separate bar that is more of a cowboy bar than the other so as to not disappoint the sound of the name. I personally know the dj so I stayed in the dance area but more was going on there anyways. DJ Sally keeps that place hopping. The karaoke is fun for everyone. One guest did a jodeci song and the next did an Elvis song and everyone enjoyed. The stage for karaoke makes it a pro feel to it. Having to get up on an elevated stage with lights in your face gives it a more star feel to singing in front of everyone which is cool. It's a step up. Adequate space throughout. I did not spend much time in the other side except to use the restroom which is on that side.

Back in October 2012, I visited the outside bar for their Friday happy hour from 3-6pm and I really enjoyed it.

This past weekend I was able to experienced their bar/club area on a Thursday Night and Saturday night. Both nights it was with a group of people. 

We arrived to Vegas on Thursday around 8pm and started walking the strip around 10pm in search of a bar with cheap drinks and some good music. We were approached by a promoter for the bar and go us in for free. Music was great it was a mix of Hip-Hop & Top-40. Drinks were decently priced ($7 for well). 

Saturday Night we didn't want to do the whole club scene at a premier club so we end up contacting the same promoter who end up giving us his info on Thursday night. He got us in for only $25 which included open bar all night. Again the music was pretty much the same as Thursday. 

Overall, it was a great bar/club. If you are simply looking to grab cheap drinks, dance and have fun without all the premier glam, this is the spot. No waiting to get a drink, no bumping into people and ladies no long lines to use the restroom.",x6PgDHOyXb8PGOfBTPlbeg,1,1,4,Wk_wreWzAVsZ6GBUCAZZZw

(Again- it's the strip, I'm compromising)  Their patio is right on Vegas blvd across from the Cosmo, so that's a redeeming quality.  In general I think Planet Hollywood has some of the weakest restaurants/beers on the Strip.  Miracle Mile is the only reason I go there.  I'd say if you're at Planet Hollywood and you want to drink beers on the patio and eat below-average bar food then give it a go.

During a busy 6:00PM Friday evening dinner rush, we were seated promptly and our server was quick to address our table, even though NFL wild card weekend was in full swing. Located in the middle of the strip next to Planet Hollywood this eatery had just what we were in need of, some quality noshing food, served up quickly. 
What an asset to PBR Rock Bar, our server was. 
Joe recommended just what this hungry trio needed with no up-sells, expedient in all facets of serving and with a sense of humor and a smile all servers could learn valuable lessons from.
The Chicken Quesadilla had serious amounts of shredded/pulled chicken, pepper jack cheese and decoratively topped with sour cream and pico de gallo.

The House Green Salad was average and pricey for what we were served, so if you are going to go with some greens you may want to avoid that menu item.

The half order of the House Made Chili totally nailed it as one of our finicky and modest eaters did not come up for air from his cup. Another stellar recommendation, in that the cup was more than enough to satisfy in our servers opinion and he was spot on. For 4.95 you will be hard pressed to find a much more filling and hearty meal. (Thanks for offering a taste buddy, no I did not want to try it--sarcasm)

As a pizza traditionalist, I was not about to order a Buffalo Chicken Pizza, what happened to the old staples of meatball, sausage, anchovies, yet PBR does offer a pepperoni pizza. Well you can teach an old dog new tricks or serve him up a perfectly cooked, hand tossed dough with chunks of chicken, heap on the mozzarella and hit it with crumbled blue cheese.",2oNfIz8SOcUIclduAKXlwA,0,0,4,cZyCxfcn-iJTIeIvDUuvzg

To be honest, the only reason I darkened their door in the first place was that the nearby ""Earl of Sandwich"" line was about a quarter mile long and I was starving. My companion and I headed in and bee-lined for the large comfortable bar area where we were immediately greeted by one of the many very attractive bartenders who work here. Drinks came immediately and we received only light-hearted ribbing for ordering sodas instead of cocktails or beer. Hey, I know it's Vegas, but at 11:30am, I'm still trying to regroup from the previous night's activities that concluded just hours earlier. Anyhoo, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and (I believe) a country chicken salad served as a wrap. The food came out quickly and astounded us both in presentation, flavor and sheer portion size. I guess a restaurant with a ""Professional Bull Riding"" theme needs to serve a hearty entree and they certainly delivered. We left very full and very satisfied. In fact, when it came time for brunch the next day, we found ourselves right back at the bar at PBR. This time I ordered a breakfast omelette that featured beef brisket among a savory medley of cheese, onions, peppers and potatoes. This thing was the size of a newborn, I swear. I stuffed myself and made it through just over half of the thing. So good, though. My dining companion ordered the country chicken salad wrap AGAIN and loved it for a second day straight.

Outside, we were offered 2 for 1 drink coupons so we came inside and were seated to a small empty bar on the left. Not being happy with the vibe and wanting something a little more lively we moved to the other side of the restaurant and took a seat at an inside picnic bench. 

Our waiter quickly arrive and took our orders and advised that the drink coupons were only good on the other side of the bar. We ended up just sticking with water. 

There were 6 of us ordering various things. I ordered the ribs and brisket combo with fries.  The ribs were okay but the brisket was disgusting , it was shaved and didn't taste like it was smoked. It seemed more like it was boiled and they just poured sauce on it without even letting it caramelize. So I didn't eat it, I also let someone else in my party try it to make sure it wasn't just me and they also found it uneatable. 

The waiter was very good and attentive, so at some point he came by and asked how everything was, so I told him I didn't care for the brisket. He offered to bring something else to replace it, which  I appreciated  it but by that point I was just over it and said no thank you. I also said, I was more than happy to pay for the meal and wasn't expecting a discount or anything , I was just giving feed back because he asked.

Before the bill came, the waiter brought a manger over and he apologized; and asked what was wrong with it ( I didn't think he was challenging my opinion, I think he just wanted feed back on how they could have done it differently) .

I told him that I just thought it tasted gross- and fatty; and again I said I wasn't expecting anything as the service and the rest of the food was good. 

When the bill came, they took my entire meal off the menu..which I didn't expect but I think it says a lot about them. They tried to make it right by offering something else..then giving me way more than I asked for (especially because I didn't really ask for anything)  

So because all the other food was good, the service was fantastic and they tried to make the customer happy, I am giving them 4 stars. I would eat here again because the over all experience was good.",mJzztnGLEShYA_0iSpTBpw,0,0,4,2u4XXaG8JkNOd82FJkvSdQ

I would like to say that this place was fun and tasty, but it honestly wasn't.  We went in there around 10 at night and just wanted to something to munch on b/c we had not eaten dinner and no one seemed hungry enough to sit down somewhere and order a late night dinner.  So, the 5 of us decided to order about 4 different appetizers including the fried pickles, potato skins, buffalo wings, and buffalo fingers.  

My first experience with fried pickles was a bust and I had high hopes.  There was way too much cornmeal involved.  While I did actually like the buffalo fingers and potato skins...all of that went out the window because of the honest to goodness douchetard waiter we had.

I'd like to say I remember his name, but all I remember was his purposefully lopsided mohawk and his disgustingly rude attitude.  Granted, we came in and just ordered appetizers and my friends had ordered their huge yard drink before we came in.  But was it really necessary for him to tell us how annoyed he was about these things?  He was a jerk and told us he would shoot himself in the head if we wanted to separate our checks at the end of our meal.  And no...he was not joking.",_CDP0zqXE3iqMYGitD_NjA,0,0,2,xM3gkQPOf5H08nqsFvw7zA

We were seated at a table then waited around for approx 15minutes while the table next to us was served. The waitress didn't even make eye contact with us or say hello...doesn't make sense because I don't know how you miss a table of 6 people in a nearly empty restaurant. 

Still waiting around with no service we decided to go to the bar while my husband waited at the table. 3 of the 4 were able to get drinks while I waited around and got nothing. Yay me! 

Hubby waited at the table and got nothing but irritable so needless to say we left and went straight to Pink's and tore it up.

The previous restaurant in this space had a serious issue with quality of service. The servers at the now defunct 'Hawaiian Tropic' were unattentive, ditzy, and downright stupid. Absolutely no concept of customer service, even though their food was pretty impressive. This low quality of service was the same up the food chain with idiotic, condescending, douchebag managerial staff. The bus boy ended up getting us our drinks for goodness sake.

But enough of my rant on the Hawaiian Fail-Tropic. That ship has sailed, giving rise to the wonderful PBR Rock Bar & Grill. Food seems expensive right off the bat, but this is a misleading thing--the portions are ENORMOUS, and delicious!

She had a chili dog and fries and I had the pulled pork sandwich and chips. I could not finish the pulled pork sandwich. And it was AMAZING.

2525797,2012-03-08,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. So many problems, no redeeming qualities. I'll do it in list form.
1. We put our name down with a group of 12, they gave us a buzzer and told us 30 min. When we came back after 20 min to check on the status of our table they said oops, someone came up and said they were you so we gave your table away. Our buzzer didn't even go off. We didn't want to wait any longer so we split into 2 groups.
2. One girl in our group had celiac (gluten intolerant) so she asked the waitress if a menu item was gluten free. The waitress didn't know so my friend asked if she could check with the cook, and she said she would. My friend forgot to double check that she had asked the cook, but the waitress clearly did not check, and my friend was in bed with a horrible stomach ache all day long.
3. I ordered grits (because that's what I like when I'm hung over) which were $3, I asked for cheese on top. The cheese on top was an additional $3. $3 for cheese??? That's f&%king ridiculous.
4. Out of 6 people at our table, the waitress forgot to put in 2 of the orders. How do you forget 1/3 of the orders?? So they came out like 20 min after the others. Granted, we weren't charged for them but by that time we just wanted to get the hell out.
5. No one liked their meals that much, food was just blah. Go to earl of sandwich across the way, sandwiches are better and your expectations for service are lower so you aren't disappointed.",0_WXxcHPrq5zxvpSZDv6DA,3,0,1,tp4dBbXd82Q7-7IrfOMWTA

2574060,2014-06-08,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"A friend and I have been here today since 5pm to watch the Martinez vs Cotto fight, since they were advertising it for free we thought it would be fun to go out and watch the fight (we normally order PPV at home). When we arrived around 5pm we asked where te fight would be showing inside or outside the bar, and the two staff members at the entry said both inside and out, we asked if we needed to seat ourselves or if they seated us they told us to help ourselves, but let us know there are no tables and there is only standing room. When we walked inside they were playing hockey on every single tv except the small 20"" one in the corner by the entrance. All but 4 tables were full and the four open tables had reservation signs on them. So we walked back to the front and asked if we could reserve a table for the fight and they said they are not taking reservations, I asked why they have reserved tables then and they said people reserved those online, and suggested us grab a table as it opened up. About 30-40min later two spots at the bar opened up and there was a tv screen displaying Martinez vs Cotto on the picture and we asked the bartender when they were going to turn on the fight, the bartender said she didn't know and would ask, about 10 minutes later she comes back and says they are ably playing the fight inside, irritated we go and ask the guy who originally told us it was playing both inside and out and he said due to us having the fight for free and the high demand of people asking they have decided to charge people to enter to watch the fight and it's only playing inside. We were like okay so now we have to go try to find a spot inside? I asked if we. Plus pay to reserve a table and he said no they are not doing that just making people pay to walk in and stand. We went back inside and searched for a table, all of them were full except for the reserved ones in the middle of the bar. We wended up making friends and sharing a table, they were here to watch hockey and planned on leaving when it was over. We orders fries and a Caesar chicken wrap, both were absolutely disgusting. The fries were soggy nearly dripping in grease and the wraps had mostly lettuce and the small amount of chicken was soggy as well. Our waitress was very nice, busy with so many people in the bar. I had to ask several times for someone to turn the fight on at least one of the TVs near me, After about 2 1/2 hrs at our table enjoying our new friends and watching the prelims of the fight another waitress walks up and asks one of the people at our table if they were here to watch the fight or just hockey and that she was just wondering the guy let her know he was here for the hockey. I looked over and said I bet they are gonna try to give away our table after the hockey game! everyone at the table laughed. Literally like 15 minutes later another waitress walks up and is trying to put a reserved sign in the middle of our table, I said wait a minute, we are hear to watch the fight? She said we would have to leave because someone reserved the table. I then started getting mad! I was like NO I've been here since 5PM trying to get a table and some service so we can sit and watch the fight I told her I tried paying for a table hours ago and you guys said your not taking reservations! She the. Went and got the girl who asked one of the guys at the table if he were just watching hockey or the fight and I looked at her and said, you asked him not us! We have been here for hours. She then began to argue with me about speaking up next time if we were planning to watch the fight! I told her that she specifically said she was just wondering not that she had planned on giving our table away!! She just took the reserved sign off out table and walked away, didn't even apologize or anything.. I would say the food is gross, and over priced for the quality of food. this place is poorly managed, every single staff member said something different about what was going on several times and they probably shouldn't have false advertisement outside the bar about showing a PPV fight for free if they were charging people and kicking people out who didn't pay for a table to watch the fight.

We were a little confused and didn't realize my friends were in same bar, just on patio overlooking Strip. The view was nice and misters kept things cool. What was not cool was the fact that different barkeeps charged $8-$11 for a whiskey neat. Pisses me off. Had this not occurred, it would be a 3* experience. 

The company was great, watching fools ride the bull was fun...but the ""I'll choose how much to charge"" pricing left me feeling taken advantage of.

The bar also has a main room and then a side room so in total, I count 4 bars.

I ordered the chicken fingers and they were relatively greasy but decent. They do in fact have decent happy hour prices during the afternoons.

We checked to the menu at PBR and it seemed to have a few interesting items that seemed right up our alley for this night.  We were asked inside if we could sit outside and so they told us that would be fine and we walked to the outside area overlooking the strip.  We found another hostess outside so we asked for a table for two.  She didn't have any at the time, but found us a nice spot at the railing overlooking the strip.  The area itself was clean, high chairs which I prefer but a very small space to put buckets of beers or food.  We checked out the menu and waited for our waiter Paul.  He didn't come over until after we had to wave down another employee 10 minutes later.  At this point we were a little frustrated but decided to stay and make the best of it.  The bucket of beer prices for five 16 oz domestic beers wasn't bad for the strip, $18.00.  We ordered our drinks and a small appetizer.  Well, it took another seven to eight minutes to get the drinks and another fifteen minutes to get our appetizer.  When we received the appetizer it was brought out by one of the cooks, who was very grumpy and tapped me on the shoulder to give it to me.  When I turned to take it from him he threw it in front of me with a disgruntled attitude.  At this point we started eating the appetizer, when during the middle of eating it our waiter Paul came up and took our menus without asking if we wanted to place any more orders (which we still did).  We ate about half the appetizer which was a salty mess.  The appetizer was the tater invader which was a mix of tator tots, fries, chilli and chives.  After the appetizer we decided to leave and took four of our five beers with us.  We spoke to the manager at the end of the meal and he seemed as if he was not surprised by who gave us the bad service.  The manager did not try to make it up to us in any way.

Potato Skins - 6 on a plate, crispy skin, good amount of cheddar and bacon.

Memphis Style BBQ Pork Burger - the burger was huge. LOTS of meat, but a little too salty, we downed alot of water eating this.

Dorito Crusted Mac & Cheese - we got lured in by the name, the mac & cheese was tasteless, and by ""Dorito crusted"" it means they crush a handful of Doritos and layer it on the mac & cheese. I can make a better version of it myself.",EhBSpcrb_td3l8TjqdiQDA,0,0,3,Sc9mDodV8Gvh4JF4_-po0g

2714355,2012-01-19,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"My husband had read about this restaurant in his Las Vegas newsletter prior to our trip.  He also looked at the menu on their website which indicated they might have some pretty awesome food . We are self-proclaimed foodies and enjoy trying different restaurants ,splurging and not being calorie conscious when we vacation.
We arrived on Sunday morning January 15th and the restaurant was busy  We were told there were only high tables available which we reluctantly agreed to.  Then the hostess attempted to seat us at a 2 person table with a beam right beside us which blocked most of views.  She reluctantly sat us at a 4 person table where we did have great views of all TV's which my husband enjoyed.  Although we noticed there were two regular tables after being seated that were empty, maybe you can reserve those??? Our server came to the table fairly quickly but needless to say she was not very personable.  I realize people have bad days but come on put on a smile & act like you enjoy working there, it really will effect your tip!  I was shocked  when within 2 minutes after we placed our order the table of young men who were sat right before us started receiving their food.  Our food arrived within no less than 10 minutes....to me that is a sign that food is not cooked fresh to order and when I am paying $40 for lunch I expect fresh food.  My husband ordered hot wings with blue cheese dressing. Our server forgot the blue cheese dressing so we had to flag down another server to bring him some.  The wing meat was dry & overcooked which again leads me to believe they were pre-cooked & just reheated.  (Wonder if they have a trillion microwaves running in the kitchen)  He ordered cheesy fries which were hot on top because of the melted cheese but underneath the fries were cold.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a spicy remoulade sauce which got lost in all the lettuce.  The meat was lukewarm which again leads me to believe we are just reheating in the kitchen and not doing a very good job of that.  I don't believe in sending my food back to any kitchen after watching TV shows where chefs get upset when customers send back food and so they do something atrocious to the food before sending it back out to the unsuspecting customer.  I only gave this restaurant one star because I could not give it zero.  We had planned to take a large party of people to this restaurant when we go back to celebrate our anniversary in March but after our experience there I think not!  This was the most expensive meal we ate the entire weekend and the worst meal....if you want food don't go to this restaurant.

The PBR Rock Bar and Grill is outside of the Planet Hollywood Casino. We sat outside watching the end of the Rock and Roll Marathon as the runners were finishing up. Las Vegas Boulevard was closed and thousands of runners had taken control.

The menu is large, and there were a few things that caught my eye. On the suggestion of the server I got the 1/2 rack of ribs. The air was a little cold and there were lots of gas heaters around. There was actually one right over our table, but it had been disconnected because they put a TV too close to it and it was a fire hazard. So, we stayed cold.

Service was great, our waiter was excellent ( sorry didn't get his name). We ordered some wings ( the lime/tapatio highly recommend) and burgers. Everything was very delicious expecially the fries. Everything was going great, everyone was happy smiling having a great time when suddenly the people next to us started to get loud. As always I try not to stare or be noisy but my husband was closer and had a better view. Well looks like a female that was waiting was looking at the game when a male that was on that direction started telling her ""what are you looking at"" confused the girl apologized and said she was looking at the game.  Well I guess it wasn't enough for the male that he started to cuss her out, to the point were she started to cry. Some not sure if it was a waiter or manager went to the male and his party and was talking to them but it was not good enough. The male was still being loud, so the couple left. As the couple was leaving the females male components was trying to tell the hosstage that that party were being very rude. Well the male in the group started to use fowl language to a point that my family and I also had to leave. 
I don't think we will be returning not because of the food, food was excellent but because I think that this place didn't do the right thing, they let the wrong person leave and didn't do much to ask the problem causers  to leave.

3104028,2011-08-23,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"Let me just start by saying it's pretty tough for me to give a one star review, because I always find something I like about a place, whether it be pretty waitresses, or the fries were nice and crunchy, or the price was low enough to make it seem reasonable.  I seem to be an optimist when it comes to dining out and going to new places when I review them.

However, this place can s*** it. Horrible service was the number 1 factor, pretty crappy food in my opinion, and they sat us outside on a saturday at lunch when it was over 100 degrees already. The shade sails they have set up don't even cover up the two big tables they have out there. 

The scene: Bachelor party, 10 guys, needing some comfort food after a night of drinking into the wee hours of the morning..... Earl of Sandwich just across the hall was our #1 choice, but the line was about 60-70 people long down the hall. Our first clue this place sucked was the fact there was no line, when across the hall the line was over an hour long. DUH to me, my mistake. We sat down, and it took about 15 minutes to even be noticed by a server, and the place was NOT AT ALL busy. We ordered a bunch of waters, and a couple bloody mary's. 15 minutes later, we still didn't have anything to drink. Finally we went up to the bartender and asked for our waters. Then, we all ordered our food, which included a few burgers, a half rack of ribs, a steak and egg breakfast burrito, a couple club sandwiches, and a pepperoni pizza. 20 minutes later we finally got some food out to us, they cleared the trays and took off. Guess what, they didn't have the pepperoni pizza on the tray. The runners took off without asking if we had everything, and if we needed anything else (like ketchup, hot sauce, more water, etc)

So, we all realize that our boy didn't get his pizza. 5 minutes later the server came back and we brought to her attention the pizza didn't come out. She went to check on it and we saw her punching buttons on her screen, then start walking back to us, thinking she was gonna tell us it was on the way, or that she forgot to put it in the system......but nothing, she didnt' even stop by to say sorry or that it would be out in a few minutes. She just walked right on by our table to help somebody else. Now we're really starting to get pissed!!! How rude!!! What kind of service is that????

10 minutes go by and we're pretty much all done eating our food, and still no pizza. The pizza orderer said screw this and went to the server and told her not to bring it out, cancel the order, and that he doesn't even want it anymore, and to take it off the bill. 

The service was horrendous when it was even there in the room, the food was way below average (the burger had no flavor and the potato salad was not cold or tasty, and I was told the fries were soft and not cooked well), especially for the price, and the drinks were expensive, even for being on the strip at a casual restaurant (why do you think we didn't order drinks at a bachelor party???)

I was really excited because my husband and I went to the rockhouse over at the palazzo and had such a good time and I thought this would be the same because they are technically owned by the same person. 

I was 100times wrong! We walked in to redeem our groupon and you can only do it at the small rockhouse bar on the left side of the restaurant. We walked up and the bartender was so rude! I wish I had her name cuz I'd call her out but she was a skinny blonde chick with a thigh tattoo. She practically rolled her eyes every time we asked her for a drink and she told another girl to get us wristbands and the other girl seemed so annoyed that she had to do that for us because they were groupons. Ok. We get it. 3/4 of us are servers and we don't like to do stupid sales but it's part of your job. At least be nice about it. I didn't even want to go back and ask her for anything because she had her nose in the air the whole time so I asked my husband to get us drinks. 

I eventually went over there to get drinks and the whole time she was making my drinks she was talking to some guys at the bar and saying profanities like it was normal to do that in front of customers. No, it's not. That's nasty and rude. It makes the establishment look so unprofessional. We sat at a table a little ways from the bar and had ordered some food. She didn't come pick up the plates or trays until we were leaving like an hour later and didn't even come over to check on us or offer us condiments or napkins! I had to go up to the bar and get napkins myself. Mind you, this was a TUESDAY AFTERNOON. NO ONE WAS EVEN THERE! She was not busy and could have done so much better. 

This place is only getting one star because the food was decent. But service was so awful! I would never recommend getting this groupon. I would however recommend getting the one for the rockhouse at the palazzo.

3198106,2014-03-04,1,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"In the day, PBR Rock Bar & Grill is a restaurant in Planet Hollywood. At night it turns into a club. At the restaurant I showed up around 2pm on a Sunday looking for some breakfast after having a late night at their club. I was glad to see breakfast was served all day. There was no wait to be seated which was great as every other place our group of 4 seemed to look into was packed. I ordered the Country Scramble which was basically scrambled eggs with mushrooms, tomato's and ham with gravy on top. It came with toast and tater tots which I love. I also tried the Breakfast Skins which are pretty standard potato skins but add egg. Those were good as well. I probably sound like all I do is eat, but I also tried the Grilled Cheese B.E.T. which is an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich and also liked that. Definitely no complaints with the food. It came probably 10 minutes after we ordered. The atmosphere is also great as there are TV's everywhere with different sports on. Great for someone like me who can't get enough of sports. The bathrooms are labeled ""The Can"" and have an attendant working in them at all times. It's nice to tip I suppose, but call me crazy... I'm not into tipping guys that drop soap on my hands and hand me a towel. The guy was just as nice to me even when he realized he wasn't getting a tip. The only kind of annoying thing was our server asked if we were ok probably 25 times during our meal... which I find a little excessive. I'd rather have them come around too much than not at all though. Oh ya... this place has a mechanical bull in the restaurant which provides a little entertainment if anyone feels the need to show off their 8 second ride during the day. 
The night before, I visited the club at PBR Rock Bar & Grill because my group just had to play some beer pong. There is typically a cover, but we got in for free since it was my girlfriends birthday and we each got buy one get one free vouchers for drinks. Nice to see they cater to birthdays. They had a DJ mixing and a dance floor with a cage you could climb in for you ladies who wanna get freaky. We got some drinks and headed over to the beer pong tables to battle it out. They had 3 tables which all weren't in use, but shortly after we started playing, 2 other groups started using the other tables. It was a nice mix to the bar scene. The thing I found interesting was this place didn't play any country music, and this is the same place which had the mechanical bull. However the bull is outside of the bar section so it seems to only be a day time event. Overall this is a great place if you want something a little more low-key than a club and is open till 3am for you that go to bed when the sun rises.",OqPgIdARuBZdUjwG4WYcQA,0,0,4,eltgG7qUerH7u7GCzUgnYQ

3321937,2015-07-30,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"So it's my first night in Vegas and I had a hankering for a burger. The boyfriend and I stopped here on a Thursday night and it really wasn't crowded at all. The first thing I noticed was the inconsistency of the style of the bar with the design, music, posters, etc. For one thing it's trying to play that cozy country bar attitude, but it has faux leather booth seats as if you're sitting at an Applebee's and the music really leaves a lot to be desired. (2000's pop music, totally not the vibe they were going for) The wait staff was nice and friendly but also didn't go out of her way to make sure our drinks were refilled on time and we had to wait.

Now I can totally overlook the feel and music, and uncomfortable seating IF the food is good.
Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here. For the appetizer, we ordered the chili cheese taters. The taters were fresh and hot but totally buried under way too much cheese and even more chili. I usually like chili, but this wasn't a homey comfort food chili, it was more like 90% out of a can chili.

For dinner, I got a BBQ burger which is usually a go-to for me because I love BBQ sauce. The burger was falling apart, and not in a good way. And it definitely wasn't cooked medium, it was well done. Also a big no-no for me is if food doesn't have any flavor. There was really no taste except the toppings and the ground beef. If I took ground beef with no seasoning and cooked it well done at home, it most likely would've tasted better than what I got. So it looks like I won't be coming back here.

If you want a good burger, try Burger Brasserie! That place was surprisingly awesome!! After coming here, I was pretty nervous to try burgers anywhere in Vegas, but wasn't disappointed.",2hTp0sjO9ugflayPIUut3A,0,0,2,-4cwlA0DolPCFzEBCFTkhw

We ordered the bucking bull frys. They were good not as hot or spicy as I was expecting. The chili cheese taters on the other hand were actually spicier than the bull frys.

There are enough for at least two adults to share easy. 

The BBQ hamburger was cooked very well. Served with a perfect medium pink through out. It was a good meal even for bar food. My co-workers had various foods they all enjoyed including potato salad, other burgers, and chicken sandwiches.

The location is loud for sure its a country bar so understand that up front. We sat in the restaurant area to eat. There is a bar side with karaoke and open floor area were people danced.

I don't know what else you can ask for at a bar on the Strip.  Rock climbing wall, beer pong, and a full bar.  It's not gonna blow you away with the quality of the drinks, the selection, or the prices, but overall it's a nice spot if you're looking for somewhere to drink.  They have a solid Happy Hour and they have  an outside area to strip people watch if the weather is right.  It has a similar vibe to any of the other chain bars, but the ideal location on this side of the strip knocks it up a peg.  There are definitely better places to go if you're looking for a quality drink or an upscale clientele.

Have you ever had an entire yard of strawberry daiquiri? Yeah, entirely too sweet. But, also delicious. PBR rock bar, with an outside bar at the bottom/outside of Planet Hollywood hotel, has many sizes to buy of frozen cocktails.  A few things to note, however.

1) The tables are if you are eating only
2) Get a yard, super yard, Bull, Boot, Guitar, whatever and take it to go and walk the strip with it
3) Go inside, just past the hostess stand for more drink options - the bar only has two drink choices - inside there are 6 or 7
4) You can get additional shots added for cheap

The service at the outside bar was painfully slow - we waited an eternity to find out that they did not have the guitar we wanted, but we should go inside. But I went ahead and ordered since they had a purple yard for me. Little did I know they had better flavors inside.  Lesson learned.

So after I got my drink and went inside to find my friend, I realized the additional flavors. The staff was friendly and happy to offer additional shots to the guitar - 5 for $10, we think? Anyway, we declined and off we went with the guitar full of frozen goodness. 88 ounces is a LOT of sugary drink, but it certainly caused a lot of people to stop us along the strip.",hTEKSL52x8cUUlHpUEx4lw,5,5,4,qS_jJ0vXjpzWQeJtJ_rl4Q

The first drink was just ok, and the second round tasted like vomit, umm pass. Probably would have tasted better if I was already drunk, but vomit flavored is very hard to ignore. There were some guys there playing beer pong, and they had the ball flying all over the damn place. A few times the ball was on the floor in the corner where the ""VIP"" couch and main window/wall is, if you look on the ground and see the filth build-up smh, I was thinking these MF'ers are gonna have Hepatitis A by the end of the night. Beer or alcohol doesn't kill everything, but good luck guys! What I was really surprised about was the music though. With the name of it being PBR Rockbar I expected to hear mostly Country or Rock, but they had a mix of Hip-Hop playing, old Hip-Hop but still. Anyway this wasn't a great experience for me and I don't feel like this is my type of bar anyway, so more than likely I would personally not come back here to spend money.",ytVf6Ar_QwqFiL08plIfOQ,8,7,2,6NRNoIkY67fJsQLx--f4Zg

I know you can do better as you have!  The original time I went here was a year ago for my Sister's 21st bday.  We sat in the outside patio area and had a blast!  The waitress was awesome, drink specials were decent and the atmosphere was great.  So when we were in Vegas for 4th of July weekend this year, again celebrating a 21st bday this time for my cousin, we were super excited to go back here.  It was a Sunday and they had all these advertisements for something like $10 all you can drink from 9pm-1am.  As it was almost 9pm we asked one of the hype women standing out front of the outside bar that was yelling about the special.   (I call them hype women as I don't think they were waitresses and they didn't know enough information to be a hostess.) They said yes come back at 9pm and for $10 we could drink until 1am.  PERFECT!  So we came back around 915pm and grabbed a seat at the outdoor bar.  Once we sat down the waitress came up and we inquired about the special.  This is where it went downhill, FAST!  She told us that the special wasn't for the outside bar it was only for inside.  Umm OK?!  So we went inside and asked the snotty hostess there about it.  She said she had no clue what were talking about to which we pointed to the sign right next to her stating the special.  She pointed us down the hall and said to ask down there.  We walked a few feet to another entrance.  Upon entering this rundown, hole-in-the-wall looking area we saw an empty bar to our right and a couple beer pong tables to our left and another bar behind them.  There was an employee moving tables and cleaning floors and then a few couples playing beer pong - no one else.  A waitress finally walked up to us to see if we needed help and we again brought up the promotion, which we found was Twitter driven so you had to become their Twitter fan in order to partake.  Side note here: I have done this type of promotion in Vegas before and they ALWAYS SUCK!  You will get every line in the book about why you aren't applicable - ""we ran out,"" ""We served all we can on that promotion,"" "" where did you see that at?"" etc, etc - it's only to get you in the door and they figure since you are there you will spend money!  Ok back to the terrible service at PBR - so the waitress gets the GM/Promoter of this special to help us.  This guy walks up to us doesn't introduce himself and is as cold as can be.  He asks what we need and we AGAIN repeat why we are there.  He asks if we all have a Twitter and we say yes and that we understand the promotion.  Then he looks to my cousin who is wearing a tank top and asks if he has another shirt to put on.  Now keep in mind it's July, in Vegas, and 120 degrees outside.  No my cousin says to him and the guys says Oh well then we can't serve you.  We inquire about the three guys playing beer pong ALL in tank tops and he says that they aren't here for that promotion.  WTF?! What do you have to wear a suit now to a rinky dink, drab bar in order to pay $10 to drink all  you want of their watered down well drinks?!  That was the last straw - we left all quite irritated.  If he didn't want to make the $50 he could have off of us and if he wanted to lessen the servers/bartenders tip money that night so be it.  If he is the person running this place I honestly want to have nothing to do with it.  Word of mouth travels fast and I've already recommended a few good places (AHEM Peppermill) to friends on their way to Vegas this Summer and rest assured PBR Rock Bar is NOT one of them.",SuZbA_3ZYTr8JS_W2ja8nA,1,0,1,G_kddUAmvtsEyNWTrB2igw

3558788,2016-11-17,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"Just to give you some perspective, I had to create a yelp account just to write this.

This was my first time in Vegas so I was your typical tourist walking up and down the strip looking for a place to grab a drink. It was 5:00 PM so I was looking for a place to cash in on a happy hour deal and watch some sports. 

Since this was a Wednesday night in November there were little options for sporting events. However, the Penguins were playing the Capitals, which if you know anything about hockey you should know that's worth throwing on one of the 50 tvs they have. Instead they had replays of MAC football games and the NFL network on (remember this is a Wednesday).  So ok, they made a mistake. As the only person at the bar I kindly asked them to turn on the hockey game. The sweet bartender said she will find a manager who has permission to do so(which she did). However the manager (who seemed like a real douche) couldn't complete this simple task. Therefore, I was forced to be that guy who asked them to turn on the game three times. 

On top of this, their fire alarm came on and everyone on their staff just continued on working. I asked the bartender if we should be concerned and evacuate, in which she replied, ""no, this happens all the time"". 

The game eventually came on and I was already face deep into buy one get one gin & tonics plus happy hour food specials so I stayed. Moral of the story, you can certainly find a better place to get some food and enjoy a drink. They are awarded one star for their kind bartender and cheap deals (compared to other places on the strip).",Gxv0gIGCJWdGmNtb8FTPFA,2,0,1,4Vdp5cNTiPlcC_IbhcPIlg

3621466,2015-03-09,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"I really wanted to like this place. Prior to my recent trip to Vegas, I had come across quite a bit of information regarding PBR. All of the photos and information made it seem like a fun, interesting place.

A few of us needed a quick bite after a long walk perusing the strip. Of the choices around Miracle Mile, I opted for PBR based on the above. We entered where a sign said ""entrance"", but had to ask a server if we were to seat ourselves only to be shown the hostess stand opposite of the ""entrance"" sign. Not a big deal, but a little confusing (saw others do the same as we did). 

We were seated outside, and opted to order appetizers as we wanted to get back to our adventures on the strip. I ordered a drink that claimed to have a favorite rum of mine in it, and a side of fries. The drink was good enough, but I'm not sure it contained any alcohol as I certainly could not taste even a hint of the rum. The fries were edible, but I wouldn't care to pay for them again - reminiscent of Burger King fries and were lukewarm at best. Another I was with ordered the Bucking Bull Fries, and was equally displeased, as was the one who ordered the Signature Wings.

The server was pleasant, but she disappeared for a long time halfway through our quick stop (went on break?) -- halfway really being about the time we were ready to leave. Our quick stop turned into being there for almost an hour. A couple of us even left as we waited for the server to return to take payment. (We were told that she claimed to have had most of the tables due to it being really busy and apparently short-handed - the patio was not even half-full and the inside area was maybe half-full -- if that is really busy, then I would hate to see the service when the tables are actually filled).

I also couldn't tolerate the music that was played outside, which seemed to be mostly a hip-hop type - more club-esque than what I'd expect at a ""rock bar & grill"". The music being played indoors seemed a lot better, and I wish we had been given an option of whether we had wanted a table indoors or out.

The only pro was the people watching, but I would have much preferred doing this as I spent my time enjoying Vegas and not unnecessarily waiting around while being subjected to bad music.

We made a point of visiting PBR while NASCAR was in town (March 9-11, 2012) only because of their PBR promotional flyers & website ads which read: Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.

I was in charge of picking the bar to enjoy the Saturday (Nationwide) race. Out of all the sports bars (or bars for that matter) in Las Vegas, I brought our group of five to PBR because of the promotion. We planned on eating and drinking for two hours and then enjoy the free drinks an hour after the race and then take 10% off the dining portion of our bill. Unfortunately things did not go that way.

I made a reservation via OpenTable for five, and when we arrived I asked for the hostess to seat us so we had a tv with a view of the race. She replied, ""we have tvs everywhere, I'm sure you'll see the race."" She proceeded to sit us at a booth that fit five people comfortably, yet NOT ONE TV HAD THE RACE ON - all were on college basketball. Before the hostess left I said to her, ""can we change a tv to the race?"" She replied, ""only the manager can change the channels - I'll have him come over.""

The manager does not arrive, but our waitress does. She gives us menus and takes our drink order. I tell her our predicament and she replied she'd send the manager over. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we still hadn't seen the manager and were missing our sporting event. Our waitress apologized profusely and said she didn't know what more to do - she had asked the manager to come over multiple times and change the channel for us. Just to be clear, no one was watching the tv we wanted changed. 

Upset I was being ignored and missing the race, I got up, took my bucket of beers and walked over to a table near the bar which had a view of three tvs showing the race. Next a bus boy walks up to our table and says, ""you can't sit here - that table has been assigned to someone else already. You need to visit the hostess to get a table."" I replied to him, ""No, I am sitting here because I asked to be seated in an area with the race and was not, and your manager is too busy to come and change a damn channel for us - so I am sitting here."" Of course he didn't like my answer and went to the hostess. Now the hostess comes to our table and says, ""you can't sit here I have this table booked for another party."" Not only did I repeat my comment, but my husband was even louder. She turned and walked away.

Our first waitress came over to our table and introduced us to our new waiter. In front of us she explained our predicament and told us the bucket of beer would be moved over to a new ticket and apologized she couldn't get the manager to change a channel for us. We told her it wasn't her fault and we would be happy now that we could see the race. She was not upset and our new waiter was happy to serve us. We thought all was on the right track.

Well, we won our bet on the race (YEAH!) but as soon as they waved the checkered flag we asked for our free drinks per the promotion. Our waiter told us the only beer selections were Bud or Bud Light. We don't drink Bud or Bud Light - so we had a well drink. It was healthy and we were happy. As soon as we finished the first drink was asked for a second. Again, we figured since the promotion was an open bar for one hour - the service would be slow and we would get at most three free drinks. Well get this: upon ordering our second well drink our waiter tells us, ""oh, it's just ONE free drink."" And I said, ""WHAT?!""

Again, promotion read:  Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, ***as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.*** Where does that say ONE DRINK? BULLSH*T!

At that point I ask for the check because I was through with crappy establishment. And when I asked for the bill I reminded them of the 10% dining discount. This time our waiter said, ""Oh, that discount is if you don't get a free drink - it's either one or the other."" My husband came unglued! I think I cursed. Our waiter said, ""Let me check though, you are my first customers asking for the discount.""'

Fuming, I sat at the table thinking about all the other bars we could've enjoyed the race as well as spent our out of town dollar...the food was barely average (I had a salad and my husband had a burger) and the service was horrible from the hostess & manager (waitstaff worked very hard). Our waiter returned and said, ""Sorry, I was wrong, you do get 10% off your dining portion"" as we all made some sort of comment about actually doing what your promotion says.

In an attempt to maximize our time in the sun on our late fall trip, we wandered down to PBR Rock Bar's patio after the pool at our hotel had shaded over. Situated right on the Strip, we thought it'd be the perfect spot to people watch. Side Note: People watching in Las Vegas is everything you thought it would be. Bring eye drops because they will dry out from staring so hard. 

Anyway, back to PBR. As I said, we sat outside where half the tables were full of pretty chill groups of older people having drinks and appetizers. Our waitress hated everyone. At least, she hated us and the people next to us, and the people next to those people, and the people in front of us. Yep that was everyone. Asking for menus and what brands of vodka was totally unacceptable. The scowls turned to full-on eyerolls when we wanted to order food with our drinks. How dare us. And when we asked to split the check? She nearly punched holes into the computer as she rang us up. 

Everyone has a bad day, totally get it. But go punch a bag of flour in the kitchen and suck it up like everyone else. If your day is really THAT bad, stay home. You aren't doing yourself any favors or your tables by being the witch of Vegas. And you certainly aren't receiving any great tips either, ours was below average and came with a note explaining why we undertipped. Personally I can't bring myself to do that... but my dining companions sure could, and did.",XtKwxbdNIHjEM3ajUoX9OQ,5,6,2,nRB4mCIlwq0d4Hl4RvKhtg

We came here ONLY because ""Fat Tuesdays"" at the Miracle Mile Shops was closed for a few hours due to some troubles w/their machines. 

What a rip off! We all got the 32 oz slushy drink for $18.( I think someone posted a picture) That thing had about 1 1/2 shots of alcohol (W E A K). I didn't even drink the entire thing, I threw it out and got a refill @ Fat Tuesdays in Cesar's Palace. 

Lesson learned.

Earlier in the day we were approached by a promoter for 2 for 1 drinks. We were actually looking for a place to eat at the time so we decided to try this place. When we sat down the table had a promotional flyer on the table. It was happy hour!! It was great, they half off draft and 2 for 1 drinks too. We all decided to get the 2 for 1 drinks. We also ordered their tailgater special. It was a bunch of appetizers for approx $50. It said it fed 4-6 people. It sounded like a great deal. Here is where it all went downhill. 
The food was cold! It tasted good but it seemed to have been sitting for a while before it got to the table. When they arrived it seemed like smaller portions. Half a pretzel? Really!? 
Then, the bill arrived and all of a sudden it wasn't 2 for 1 drinks anymore. They FAILED to tell us that on ""game day"" the drink specials aren't valid.

Wir kehrten hier spontan ein, da die Fotos der Burger einfach verlocken aussahen.
Ein Tisch wurde uns schnell zugewiesen und die Damen im Service war auch schon da. Freundlich und aufgedreht, wie man es in den USA gewohnt ist.
Die Musik im Laden war etwas laut, so dass man sie nur schwer verstand, aber nun gut. ;-)

Die Karte ist sehr umfangreich und bietet für jeden Geschmack und Hunger etwas. Von kleinen bis riesigen Gerichten. Schnell viel der Blick auf den Double Trouble, angeblich einer der größten Burger der USA, laut USA Today.
Der Kampf wurde aufgenommen und der Burger geordert. 

Das Restaurant an sich ist modern eingerichtet und erinnert etwas an das Hard Rock Café, inklusive der Musik.

Als der Burger an den Tisch kam, waren die Augen schon groß. Das war schon ein Geschoss, den man im Ganzen gar nicht essen konnte. Also musste er abgebaut und schichtweise gegessen werden.
Geschmacklich gut. Fleisch saftig, obwohl ich den Burger well done bestellt hatte. Also rundum gut. Aber auch massig und ganz schön sättigend. 
Gerade ebenso und kurz vor dem Platzen, schaffte ich das Monster. Nachtisch ging nicht mehr rein.

Nach dem Bezahlen rollte ich aus dem Laden, anders konnte ich mich nicht mehr bewegen.
Es war lecker, aber dann auch die einzige und letzte Mahlzeit für diesen Tag.

Overall the atmosphere is relaxed/country.  We had wanted to sit in a booth, but were told they were all closed because they were going to be removing a speaker from the ceiling in that area.

I ordered the hot wings as well and I was really shocked at how great they were! They had a crisp outside but not to much and lots of sauce. They weren't spicy enough though could have been hotter. My husband had the burger and he really enjoyed it and the serving size was huge! I hat a couple Hat benders which is an alcoholic beverage and I liked it.

Beer in a bucket was the special -- $20 for 5 bottles domestic of your choice.  Not too bad . . . don't order draft, those are something like $8/ea and after a bucket's worth, that gets a little pricey for football watching.

4389594,2012-07-06,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"Let me first start off by saying, I started this Yelp account solely on the experience here. 

Let's see, where shall I begin....before even going in, we were looking at the menu on the outside at which one of the hostess gave us a 10% off if we decided to eat there. We saw some entrees we would eat on the menu so we went in. First, the waiter was very friendly. We went during lunch. It wasn't busy at all. It apparently was happy hour but they said you had to go to a separate bar however, no one was at that bar. 

Once we were ready, we ordered our drinks, appetizer and food. Our lunch came out before our appetizer. When the waiter realized it, my husband refused it at that point but the manager came out and said she would comp it so we agreed to take it, even though it was late and pointless. 

The food was average. The sweet tea was delish though!! 

While waiting to receive our bill, one of those outside camera ladies came up and asked if we would like our picture taken. She had a very strong accent so it was really hard to understand her but just said ""sure"" anyway. When she came back after developing the photos and showing us the cost, we refused and she was a bit annoyed and rude about it. Whatever.

Once we got our bill, we noticed the appetizer was not comped. We didn't say anything cause we figured if we got comped for the appetizer, we wouldn't use the 10% off. Then the waiter noticed we had the 10% off so he said ""oh, I didn't see that, I will adjust the bill."" When he came back, the amount wasn't even touched. We paid for the appetizer we didn't want since it was late but agreed to take cause we were told it would be comped AND we didn't even get the 10% off they gave us at the door.

Food was pretty good. It's Just your typical, American food joint. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of fresh fruit. There was a generous portion of pork and it was tender and juicy. It definitely tasted mass produced though. No worries, that's probably why the food comes out so quickly. The bar area/décor is pretty cool. There's lots of TVs, so this place could potentially be a great spot to eat/drink and watch some games. Very fair food prices. They also got a mechanical bull there, which probably equals wardrobe malfunctions and fun times. 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes.

We had a reservation and they seemed to not be able to find it, but got is up pretty quickly. The host were friendly, asked how our bachelorette party was going so far and were very helpful. 

Once we were sat the next half hour SUCKED. I don't want my rant to be the firsxt thing you read so if you'd like to hear about our shitty server read about him at the end. 

After 45 mins, barely getting our water, going to the manager 2 times already.....I go to the manager once more....I feel like a bitch but come on. The manager says he (Kim) and the other manager (Josh) will go ahead and take care of our table personally. By the time I get back to our table Josh is handing out our shots he said he wanted to compliment us. This got our mood going back in the right direction and our order was placed and we were on our way to an awesome dinner. The food was amazing, I had The Boss Salad, and the fried pickles and jalapeno poppers were great. The other girls loved their food as well. The managers both checked on us ever couple mins, filled waters, cleared plates, go utensils, and brought everything we needed. The manager Josh looked like Clark Kent and one of our girls even told him so, he took it with a chuckle but didn't open his shirt, so who knows, he might be! The bussers were very helpful along side the managers, and definitely saved the day! 

Thanks Josh and Kim for making it up and turning a disaster around! Josh even brought us bull riding tickets and we got our bride up on that bull! If it hadn't been for the dick server, this would have gotten 5 stars. Loved the food, environment, host, bussers, bull, and of course the managers. Say hi to Josh and Kim if you go by and let them know you heard about them on Yelp.

The bad parts of dinner:
Our server took a few mins to approach us, and said he'd get us a round of waters, while he was there a host came up saying they could hook us up for a better table outside. We said that sounded great and would wait to order our food until we got out there. We waited 10 mins, no water, busser came by with water and the server sent him away with our water saying we were moving. (maybe he didn't want to carry our water outside?) Waited 10 mins, no water. I mentioned it to our server again and jokingly said maybe we should be given shots since we've been waiting so long for water. Waited 10 more mins, still no water. I'm at this point thirsty and annoyed and all the girls are talking about how long it's been. I go to the host, ask for a manager, explain what's going on, and they said they'd tell the manager. We have a manager stop by, I explain what's going on, and he said he'd get us a round of shots. 

We see the manager by the back talking to the server and look at us, so I know he's talking about us. Waited 10 more mins, still no water, and we haven't seen our server. We grab a busser and ask for water and have it within 2 mins. I go to the host stand again and this time a new manager is walking up and I explain our situation. I couldn't believe we had been there so long and had barely gotten our water. The manager says he'll take care of it and we see both managers then talking to the server. I think the servers name was Tony? Not sure he even told us. He then comes to our table, confronts us by starting with, ""What's the problem here, I got you your water, I thought you were moving, it's not my fault"". He then asks us if we want a new server and as everyone is just looking down because they can't believe we're being confronted, I blurt out a yes please and he turns around and storms away. This server is going to lose the restaurant business. How ballsy for him to confront his table like that.",aUhtAtZbzB80bJJyIeGyCQ,2,0,4,ee75TW9C8Ra8nFVU4wJxjg

4415585,2016-05-05,6,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"We had a Groupon for $40 of food and drinks...  Located in the Planet Hollywood casino, this is an all-around OK place for a casual meal or bar snacks. Along with some entertainment.  

If you have a Groupon, they REQUIRE you make a reservation.  This isn't exactly a reservation type place, but you must do it.  When you call, they will ask you if you want ""outside or inside"".  The correct answer to that question is going to be ""inside"" --  unless it's December.  This place gets some direct sunlight and it is smoking hot on that patio - sit inside with the AC. 

I had an order of potato skins (wasn't that hungry...  we ate all the way to Vegas!) and she had a pizza.  My potato skins were OK... very standard.  Could have been frozen.  But not objectionable.  Her pizza was as big as a coffee table and also just OK.  The crust was a little over-done, but again it was certainly edible.  

If you're lucky, free entertainment will present itself with brave (or drunk) people riding the mechanical bull.  The service was surprisingly friendly and efficient.  Better than expected.

If you get a Groupon for this place, it's a pretty decent deal for grabbing a snack and a few drinks.  And maybe a show too.",0x9xu_b0Ct_6hG6jaxpztw,6,7,3,J3HU7pcdbImkrXTnGWXyRw

4456913,2016-08-08,2,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"This was horrible!  There is not a nice or diplomatic way to put it.  So disappointed it is unreal.  First, we ordered show tickets through LasVegas.com and the dinner package included the tickets to the PBR Rock Bar and Grill.  We were able to walk right up and be seated right away. Great, looks good.  Then the hostess gives us this ""special"" menu.  Limited menu is what it should say. I mean...you get no choice for an appetizer...really it was not even an appetizer, it was the house salad...just a plain green salad.  No choice of salad dressing.  Just that is that and no substitutions.  Mind you, the PBR Rock Bar and Grill has a pretty decent sized menu.  I had looked it up online and was wanting the California Chicken Sandwich all day!  Nope, not gonna happen.   The entrée consisted of 5 choices.  Two of them were salads, macaroni and cheese, vegetable fajitas (who wants that!) and then ribs.   So pretty much the only decent choice was ribs!  Why not cut out the salad and dessert and just let someone order what they want to eat.  Seriously...the salad and dessert were not wanted and wouldn't have been ordered.  We sat there looking at our pathetic menu for 25 minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge that we were there.  Seriously, 25 minutes and for an already irritated person, this was like an hour.  Our waiter finally showed up.  We ordered our drinks...a beer and a soda as well as the food for dinner and the dessert, they had us order it all at once.   I ordered Mac and Cheese and other half ordered ribs.  Drinks took another 15 minutes and mine was diet...I did not order diet.  Nasty.  Seriously waited another 20 minutes to tell the waiter that it was the incorrect soda.  The bus boy brought salads.  Green salad with a couple croutons and pieces of radishes.  Ranch was the dressing served...Gross.  I was so hungry, ate mine.  Other half does not like ranch dressing so he didn't even eat his.  Another 25-30 minutes and our food comes out.   The ribs looked decent, but it was just like 4 ribs covered in BBQ sauce on a piece of bread??  Side of regular mac and cheese with it.  Mine was the PBR mac and cheese.  NASTY!  It was disgusting.  Cold and watery.  I cannot believe they serve this to people.  Just horrible.  I ate a few bites and watched my other half finish his ribs.  I mean, this was bad, not good in any way.  I couldn't even complain because the waiter didnt come back.  If you are going to serve of a minimal menu then at least make the food good.  Seriously.  This was a joke. How do you mess up Mac and cheese.  Then there was a dessert that came with dinner.  You got a choice of strawberry shortcake or root beer float.  I wanted neither, but when we ordered our food we had to place our dessert order as well.  Weird!  Annoyed to say the very least.  So we just said one of each when we ordered.  (Mind you, I would not have ordered any of these options if I had been able to order off the regular menu...none of these...not one!)
Strawberry shortcake was a cold, hard, non iced donut with whipped cream and some strawberries.  Not good... It was not restaurant quality.  It was, yeah I got some left over four day old plain Krispy Kremes and a can of whipped cream...grrrr.    No, never mind.   Four day old Krispy Kremes would probably still taste good. Grrrrr. Then his float was just a scoop of ice cream and a bottle of root beer with it on the side.  Not prepared.  Just a glass, scoop inside and a bottle served with it.  This whole night was terrible.  I honestly have not had such a bad experience in a restaurant in years.  The food was bad, service was bad, the place was not full, so there was just no excuse.  It was just ridiculous all the way around.   Over an hour of waiting for horrible bar food.  The only thing that saved this night was that the show we went to was great.  This place I would avoid like the plague!  Not a good restaurant at all.
The cost of the tickets and the show package should have allowed a decent menu or allow someone to choose from the regular menu and nix the salad and dessert that we didn't want anyway. This was not a deal at all.   We would have much rather just bought the show tickets and then bought dinner some where else...McDonald's would have been a thousand times better.  This place really didn't deserve any stars but that was not an option for me.
My advice to LasVegas.com... There are many other restaurants to choose from for packages.   Pfftt..",2_JQ0h10-Aj_Bu9GbtzJ9Q,6,0,1,Artgo7PKt_sZSGBYpk6Z3g

My beef is with the hostess - we were seated right away (we had a reservation), but as soon as we were seated, we noticed the table was uneven.  Not the legs are off/stuff napkins under one side kind of uneven, but the top of the table coming off the supporting column. 

We mentioned this to our server (Crissy), who immediately volunteered to fix, then after realizing the issue, went to get us a new table.  The hostess came over, angry, and said there were no other tables right now - because this was our fault?  There was a high-top, which we took, but it was completely the wrong attitude.  And no one else ever came and apologized, checked on us, etc. - we also moved ourselves.

And the PBR Rock Bar & Grill is a great place for that.  You see, they have a large bar inside and a decent sized bar outside.  Happy Hour provides good drinking for cheap. (for Vegas)  Then, when it starts raining and you go inside, and the girls you're failing so miserably to pick up sit at the counter ouside of the mechanical bull, you HAVE to ride the thing to impress them.  I've ridden one before...in khakis and boxers.  Big mistake.  Anyway, you basically just get to junk punch yourself over and over until you have the worst sideache ever, or you actually fall off.  I fell off after two junk punches.  But then something funny happened.  Two shots and two beers later, I magically could feel my testicles again, and felt I needed to show off for the two girls one last time.  Plus, my friend got there and said he needed video of me junk punching myself since he wasn't there the first time.  So, back on it and this time I said, ""Take the pain!  Take the pain!""  And I did...for far too long, until I got 360'd at a very high rate of speed and flew 20 feet.

There were several choices for us on the fixed price menu and we both ended up choosing the pulled pork sandwich. I was originally going to try the chicken pasta dinner but our server said it is so super spicy that he always steers people away from it. I like a little spice but not too much so I appreciated that advice. He also let me know that the menu was outdated and the dessert choice of the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was much smaller than before and only had one scoop of ice cream. That was fine and I was thankful for the heads up. The food was good but we were traveling and attending the show right after so we were not able to take our leftovers home. There were a couple of drawbacks to our experience. The music was super loud and we were not able to really talk to each other.

We were exhausted, didn't care to walk much, & hangry on Sunday night of a holiday weekend when we found ourselves at Miracle Mile. We chose this spot off the directory not wanting greasy fast food but also wanting a decent meal in a casual atmosphere. 

We were seated immediately next to the bar area and behind some retail racks which was cool - we could people watch the foot traffic entering Miracle Mile from the strip and also could listen to the DJ & MC while watching the numerous drunk brides-to-be ride the bull as they mimicked riding their man only to be thrown face first from the bull - it was loud but some good entertainment!! And the music wasn't country either, for which I was pleasantly surprised. We also enjoyed watching the DJ pretend he was working hard mixing the music when the pop music playing was just the straight tracks LOL

Our party of 3 ordered ribs, a sandwich, & the ribeye. The food was good but the ribeye, although tasty, was surprisingly a bit tough (probably the worst ribeye had in a long time). We enjoyed the free glasses for ordering a particular size brew and shake - & took advantage leaving with our souvenirs. 

Service was good.  I rarely pay so IDK about value of our meal but the shake in souvenir glass was $14.95 O_O. The Nutella shake was good & even came with a full size sprinkled donut adorning the straw, but $14.95?  A lil pricey if you ask me. Oh, & there's only 4 shake flavors, not the long list as displayed on the menu at the front near the hostess (disappointing).

All in all it was a good, entertaining choice & worth the experience.  If we ever go back, we'll just have to step it up and ride that bull ;D",GDJ8uj6-s0PFRMC1uTVPzQ,0,0,3,cqq7yfdcUxEFxEU9QerfPg

4655024,2014-06-24,8,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"There is no guarantee of tomorrow. It is so important to make the most of each day and night. My dear friend Christie and I made the most of last Friday night when we met her lifelong friends at PBR Rock Bar.

   From a local's perspective, driving to PBR Rock Bar is a nightmare. It is not like the Voodoo Lounge or Level 107 Lounge where you pull in from a 4-lane arterial into a well designed parking garage. The local has to maneuver through the mayham of the Strip area traffic. The worst part is maneuvering through the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile parking garage. It is a poorly designed parking lot without notice that the motorist is driving the wrong way. Once the local finds the parking spot, it is a walk through the corridors of Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood to reach PBR Rock Bar where the mall touches the Las Vegas Strip. Now, If your vacationing on the Strip, PBR Bar is a short walk off the sidewalk.

  PBR Rock Bar is really two different bars under one business. You have the indoor bar and nightclub overlooking the mall and the outdoor bar and nightclub patio overlooking the mid Strip. This is where the high energy is. When you look up you could see the Cosmopolitan tower, when you look straight you see a Las Vegas Strip bordered by Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan. In the near distance the intermittent Bellagio Fountains dance and the Eiffel Tower stands tall. In the near distance, the sidewalks are prime people watching. Looking into the bar, there stands the mechanical bull. The mechanical bull is really a symbol of their business practice. They really take the customer for a ride by charging different prices for the exact beverage. That is bull!  In hindsight I regret not riding the mechanical bull. I think it would of been a lot of fun. In reality, my eyes and attention were on my company. The volume of the music was at a decibel where we could hear one another. Christie and I started out in the indoor bar. When you arrive from the Planet Hollywood parking garage, you enter through the indoor bar. From this angle, the outdoor patio is camouflaged by a wall and dim interior. After Christie's friends called her we'd find our way to the outdoor patio. This is where we'd spend around 3 hours of our lives.

    There is an admission price for guys. Even guys who drink girl drinks :-). The admission is $10. But it includes a drink. For the Las Vegas Strip this is a decent deal. The average drink on the Las Vegas Strip is $12. And if I'm not mistaken, a 22 ounce beer upstairs in Twin Peaks is $10. Once your in the bar, a click on the Yelp application illuminates the buy one get one free drink check-in. The average drink is around $12. By the conclusion of the 3 drinks, people ought to be up in Space Mountain-a state of a nice relaxing buzz.

    By the time I drank the three drinks, I was up in Space Mountain enjoying a nice relaxing buzz. I enjoyed two Blue Hawaiins and a Bahamas Mama. Supposedly they are girl drinks. But I got to be a man and tell the truth. They were delicious but nothing spectacular. The bartenders didn't even bother to add a maraschino cherry. They came in a plastic cup. They were a delicious route to get to Space Mountain. They taste like fruit punch with alcohol. Now high up in Space Mountain,  I thought I was being funny and managed to drink Christie's Whiskey Neat. I am no connoisseur on whiskey, but it was decent and put me to the summit of Space Mountain. When I brought Christie, a replacement Whiskey Neat I was incognizent to the idea that the bartender charged different prices for the exact drink. I'd end the night with the least expensive beer. It was PBR. Although I was in no state to keep track of the price, I think it was $5.

  Now back to Earth and off Space Mountain,  when I reflect on PBR Rock Bar, I see 3 stars. I dislike the inconsistency in price. However, there is a high energy level to the place. Its setting on the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of the Cosmopolitan Tower and in the sightlines of The Bellagio Fountains and Eiffel Tower is high energy. $25 for a nice buzz is a good deal. Most of all I enjoy the memories of spending three hours here with my friend and her friends.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,9,8,3,0E3KiXivmKCgBYjqHZPUCA

I was traveling from out of town with a group of about 25 people to Las Vegas from Southern California. We visit Vegas twice a year as a group and wanted to change up our normal routines to something different. We were excited to give this place a try. About half of our group arrived early and was greeted at the door by someone with wristbands for $5 drinks and free mechanical bull ride with receipt of your first drink. Awesome right? We thought so... so we all get our wristbands, buy a round of drinks and settle in to this completely empty bar looking forward to the night ahead. After about 10 minutes in the bar changed bartenders, we went up for drinks and the bartender informed us that our wristbands were no good and that it was only for women. No problem, this wasn't going to ruin our night. So one of the girls in the group goes to buy a drink as well as a round for her boyfriend. The bartender notices that she's buying a drink for herself and for one of the men and immediately becomes confrontational with the female. She then proceeds to slam the register drawer shut and toss the pen on to the bar. At this point we request the manager who comes out to try and calm the situation down and explains that there was a mix up and they would not be honoring the wristbands for the men but would honor it for the women. 

Moments later, the bartender becomes confrontational with one of the women again and then begins using outrageous and unprofessional language at the group. We obviously at this point decided to leave, so we briefly waited outside in the main hall for the rest of the group to arrive as well as for food that had been ordered. A security guard is then sent to the door and enters the hallway where he says that we will have to move on somewhere else.

I can't even say enough bad things about this place and our experience here. Was literally the worst half hour we have ever had in Las Vegas and I'm still in disbelief at how disrespected a group of 25 paying customers would be treated, especially considering the whole problem was originally stemmed from their own mistake.

The food was delicious! I had the chicken nachos and most of our party head the steak and eggs! It was all great food and service. We had a blast and I'm so glad we came here!!

I would recommend you use more logical decision making when choosing a place to eat!  The hostesses at the hostess stand inside had no clue.  The first one told us there was no open seating outside.  The second one said she didn't handle outside seating and there was a different hostess outside we needed to see.  We went outside and were seated next to one of the long fire pits, which was nice since it was a little chilly.  Service was pretty bad, we had to flag someone down after 8 minutes or so to get our food ordered.  I ordered the blackened chicken fettucine and the bf ordered the chili cheese dog.  

Shortly after we ordered, they had an issue with the fire pits and had to keep lighting and relighting them, leaning over various customers and their tables.  Our food took a little long to come out, but was right when it did.  It was average tasting, nothing worth coming back for.  The blackened chicken fettucine was spicy, as promised by the menu.  The chili dog was huge!  My two cents are to try someplace of which you might have higher expectations.",GirnBbJXyYfEfLD2ksZ1ww,4,3,2,s1_YklIPFJd770Fu0K2Huw

On the outside they sell tall cups and novelty drink holders filled with some kind of alcoholic slurpy. The most expensive thing is the guitar which was $40 if memory serves right, and the smallest cup was something between $10-$16. I don't know exactly how many ounces is in each one of those but I can tell you it's a lot. Throw in a couple of extra shots in each and it'll mess even some heavy weights. 

We went in and tried a bunch of different foods. The food was pretty good, although we were all pretty hammered so there's a high probability it's a lot worse than how I remember it.

The outdoor seating was appealing, and we were just looking for an easy lunch.  There were a few tables visibly available, but there was the hostess had no idea what was going on.  We stood there for 10 minutes, but it was clear this place was so unorganized. I wish we turned  back at that point.  

A server didn't approach us for at least 20 minutes. When she did, she didn't apologize for the wait, and was quite rude. The four of us each got a beer, and ordered immediately because it had taken so long already. She forgot half our drinks, which literally took another 20 minutes.

The food took 40 minutes to come out.  Of course, my plate had a 6-inch black curly hair on half of my plate, which was the icing on the plate.  The waitress saw me look in disgust, and it was impossible to miss as it was on top of my eggs/bacon.  I normally don't send back, but I really wanted to.  However, I did not because we would have still been there. So I took one for the team, kept my plate, and ate about 2 bites as I instantly lost my appetite even though I was ravenous.

White as if they had but it in a pot and boiled it! It didn't look like it was bbq at all. I got the manager, and he said it looked like that because he ran out of hickory wood chips.!!!!! I guess he thought we couldn't tell the difference between a BBQ rib and a one that was boiled. Then after all that complaining, we look over and that empty booth was being occupied by..... You guessed it, a party of 4! Well I guess if we would of been any blacker, we would had to eat by the dumpster...... I sat in disbelief to see a waiter walk buy with.......... Ooooohhhhh yeah, you guessed it. A BBQ rib that was cooked the right way. You know, that wasn't boiled and didn't gave the same complexion as Michael Jackson.

I cannot emphasize enough how fast the service is here. We received our food about 15 minutes after ordering.

I ordered the Triple Turkey Club which was incredible. I have never had a sandwich with so much flavor. The turkey tasted as though it was just carved and it was so flavorful. I ordered fries with a side of cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was so creamy and flavorful as well.

My husband ordered the California Club and a side of Mac n' Cheese. He loved his dish as well. The portions are large, so we were really stuffed.

We ordered drinks, a few appetizers and an entree. I got the hot wings which had a nice kick to them. Nothing much to complain on the food, it was satisfying. Drinks were good, shots were nearly doubles. If you're feeling whimsical, check out their specialty drinks. My cousin tried the Hat Bender and it tasted like a watermelon Jolly Rancher. :)

This place was pretty chill when we went. I'm sure if there were games playing this would be bumpin'. There's also a mechanical bull controlled by an employee.

Rock bar, bull ride, beer pong & flip cup, sounded like our kind of place & we intended to hang out there a bit. Unfortunately we didn't quite have as much free time as anticipated on our holiday as Vegas just seems to eat the hours away.

We did get in there for a bite to eat one day though. It's one of the few places we came across with free wifi for customers which was a massive plus for us since we hadn't been in touch with anyone online all week. The other thing they did, which I really liked, is when we ordered one meal & asked to split it, they actually cut the burger in half & brought it out on two separate plates. Maybe this is an american thing but I had never seen this before so it really impressed me.

It wasn't the best burger I had in the week I was in Vegas & it also wasn't the best pulled pork I've ever had (hence the 3 stars).

The girls that work here seem disinterested in their job and life in general. They have that ""FML"" look. We grabbed a few drinks here after dinner and watched basketball. The margaritas were ok. I wanted something strawberry so I ordered a strawberry daiquiri which our server told me not to get since it's like ""drinking a Slurpee"" - we had been drinking and I just want strawberry anything - can I just have whatever I want to drink? I got my daiquiri, it was just as sugary as what I was expecting and I was ok with that.

From the patio area, we moved inside when the mechanical bull caught our attention. Our server may have thought we were trying to take off without paying...by going inside? WTH? That woman had issues.

We were watching and laughing at people riding the bull - guys, girls, a bride, bridesmaids. I've never been on a mechanical bull. Somehow, I ended up riding it myself and surprisingly enough, I stayed on for 20 seconds despite wearing a dress. I had fun and wanted to do it again...until I saw the bruises on my inner thighs.

Welcome to the PBR Rock Bar & Grill!
Contrary to popular belief, PBR does not stand for what most would assume. It actually stands for Professional Bull Riding. However, for you Whiskey Tango brown-baggers, they DO have Pabst Blue Ribbon on tap.
Although this place was packed with the Saturday lunch NFL playoff crowd, our wait was less than the 20 minutes the hostess suggested it would be.
There is absolutely no shortage of flat-screens. No matter where I faced, I was watching THE game. $7 pint imports & $12 pulled-pork sandwich on what seems to be a Big Mac sesame seed hamburger bun is what I received for lunch. The pulled pork was tasty with their signature root beer BBQ sauce & topped off with a tangy slaw. However, I like pulled pork a little more ""pulled"" as I was extracting big chunks with every other bite & that weak bun was just not holding up the task at hand. But now I'm just nitpicking. It was still a pretty good sandwich.
If you're that girl who loves being the center of attention, there's a bull-ridin' machine that has your name on it...but wait! All you guys can get on that bull as well...and unless you're an actual cowboy, your friends will get a gut-busting laugh as you hang on for dear life.
Our server, Christina, (as busy as she was) was really on top of things & very accommodating, never leaving us wanting or parched. Even my wife liked her...and that's sayin' a lot!
With the variety of eateries here at the Miracle Mile, I think our taste buds made the right choice.

01.08.12
We stopped in for Steelers/Bronco game & bellied up to the bar.
I have only great things to say about our bartender, Courtney. She really rocked the time we spent here.

Solid 3 stars for the food. 
I'm adding an additional star because Christina & Courtney really went above and beyond to make our experience at PBR enjoyable.

May your eats always be tasty & your drinking glass never go empty.
I'm out. Peace!",U0vzuP_b7vwX8OnLkXaQFQ,14,9,4,ShaBAwSmwx12vG5qZ3Nbxw

My fiance and I went it to watch two football games (his Niners and my Broncos) and we found a comfortable seat at a big table, which multiple groups where sharing. We were so excited to watch our games, have some food, and drink some beers. 

After about five minutes, a server came up to us and took our drink orders, as well as an appetizer to share. 

About five minutes after that (still no drinks), a hostess came up and said that we needed to move, because this table was reserved. Huh? There were no signs, the waitress already took our order, and we had been sitting there for 10 minutes! We went back and forth with her for a bit, and she was completely rude about it. 

But here's the kicker...she then said she would put us on the waiting list and we could be seated in 20 - 30 minutes. You've got to be kidding me. We had already ordered our friggen food!

We then talked to another hostess, who would barely look us in the face. She said she could take us to the back corner of the bar (barely any TVs), otherwise it would be 20 - 30 minutes. And all the while she was rolling her eyes at us and interrupting us, not considering our side of the story. Pretty sure that ""reserved"" table was just going to a group of her friends who wanted it last minute. 

Needless to say we left, but I was blown away. Obviously, this restaurant is doing well if they support turning away paying customers like this. More power to them.",-cpAPafcna82eeeQjD9JpA,5,1,1,y65xtraRNGCg3JeH1v9fKA

1) Drinks are weak, overpriced and the staff, not the friendliest.

Second time, I had soco and pepsi and just a pepsi and the price was $14.00.

2) The food is mediocre (read ""Meh"") at best.  The pizzas were soggy with apparently freeze dried ingredients.

3) If you want to play beer pong, they have a few tables here however they are very crowded so I am sure it turns into a fraternity atmosphere as more people fill in.

I highly recommend the frozen daquiris here, especially the strawberry margarita flavor. You can get frozen daiquiris all over Vegas though so I don't know if these are necessarily better than others. I had two meals here and both were above average but still bar food. It's worth having breakfast here as it's pretty tasty and low cost. The burger was good although nothing that stands out. My only complaint is that there is a Yelp check-in offer of ""buy one drink get one free"" and they refused to allow it to count for non-alcoholic beverages. That's a bit unfair for those that aren't drinking because two non-alcoholic drinks end up costing more than two alcoholic drinks with the deal. They should consider respecting those that aren't drinking or who can't drink and offer something with the Yelp check-in.",olAtH4EB3WUyKUsil0yU6g,1,1,4,qIGys2Upj9C69iAB1KRWUA

I didn't get a chance to eat here because they ran out of the normal, lower dining tables and only had seating at the bar or one of those high top / bar tables. This is NOT good for a person in a wheelchair like myself. I was informed by a hostess that a month ago management decided to remove 1/2 of the dining tables and replace them with the high tops... thus becoming way less wheelchair friendly. I don't want to eat when I can't see my food because the plate would be at eye level or worse depending on the height of one's wheelchair. This is just WRONG. 

For just drinking purposes, I suppose it would do. 
But , I definitely think they need to do something about this little bit of discrimination and use a little common sense. How can I eat from a high top table when I can barely see what I would be eating? I'd get more ON me than IN me.

I was really looking forward to eating at this place too.

We stopped for the hell of it on our way back from morning shopping for lunch. We intended to get lunch, a couple beers, and then head back to our hotel to rest up for the evening. Four hours later we left.

We sat outside at the bar on the patio. I thought it was perfect. It was noon on a weekday and not very crowded. The bartenders were friendly and the service was fine.

I had a turkey sandwich. I wish I could remember more. I remember that the cole slaw was a bit spicy. My guess is the turkey sandwich was average. We didn't want to eat a ton because we were going to go to a buffet for dinner. I have no recollection of what my husband had, unfortunately.

If you make any sort of purchase, you get to ride the bull for free. I'm hoping my husband accidentally deleted the video of me attempting to do that.

so our 2 friends went in before us and asked for a table for 6..
we were nearby at another store and our friends called and said we got a table but we have to come asap. so we ran over... (maybs ~5 mins) and when we got there they were sitting at this smallll table for 2 and they told us the hostess gave the booth away and we have to go up to the hostess and get in line all over again. so i went to the hostess and she had a major attitute she was like you guys weren't here so you have to go to the back of the line so we'll get seated after everyone else there (there's like 3 parties).. I was fine with that since we were late and it's pretty busy today so we went back to the small table to wait but within 5 minutes we got asked to move because we were standing over the table.... (we were by the wall so it wasn't like we were blocking anything) AND THIS IS A BAR!!! there's a mechanical bull behind us which made me think this was a casual place... but apparently not... so we moved outside (we considered leaving but it was dinner time and our friends wanted to watch the game so we just stuck around) finally all the parites got seated and then I saw a party leave from the booth so I went to the hostess and asked if we can take that table. she said it was okay. the place was really crowded so we just went over to the table and hooovered around it. soon this waitress came over and was like this table is not cleaned yet you guys need to step outside. she had a REALLY nasty attitude and she even went to the hostess to tell on us. I told the hostess oh I thought you said we can have the table so we just walked over to wait... (we've already waited like 45 mins by now) and we wanted to watch the game and we can't if we're standing outside. (plus there was someone riding the bull and we wanted to watch that too)... but we were like fine... so we stepped out and we were watching the table to see when it'll get cleaned so we Patiently waited.... and then BAM! i see another party walk in and sat on the table. I was like WTF?? so i went to the waitress that told us to leave and I was like i thought u guys said you can't sit down until it was cleaned? these people just walked in and sat down.... at our table.... and the waitress was like OH this isn't my job, you'll have ot ask the hostess (again.. very nasty attitude) I was like so you tell us to leave and then when another party comes in that you like you let them sit (she was their waitress... so obviously she just didn't want to serve us so she made us leave with this bullshit excuses) (also note... they DID NOT clean the table until after those people sat down)... really wanted to leave right about now but my friends already got drinks from the bar and they had money betting on the game and it was mid-quarter so they werent about to leave. FINALLY... we got seated... Our waiter was really nice and the food was good too. I had the chicken and waffle...
other than the rocky start... the rest of the experience was good. the game went well and my friends won money from it. the mechanical bull was fun to watch. overall environment and vibe at the bar was casual and fun. food was okay but just your typical bar food.

My friends and I were walking by on Saturday night when a club promoter stopped us and gave my friend and I free entry to their club and a buy one/get one drink coupon. So we said why not, let the guys walk off, and went inside.

The club part is this little squared off section partitioned from the actual restaurant by sound proof black walls, but they're technically connected. And while the restaurant has all the trappings of a country bar (with a mechanical bull and country music playing) the club side is GHETTO. I'd feel safer at a dive bar just off the strip than in there. It's loud and gross, cups and garbage everywhere and there's not a lot of space. Most of the dance floor is taken up by a metal cage you can dance in, but there were mostly drunk girls barely hanging on to the poles and twerking to crappy music. It was nothing even decent to dance to.

3 beer pong tables are squished across from the club's bar. Nobody regulates them and I'm pretty sure nobody has cleaned the tables or cups in days. The bar itself.o .. I have NEVER had such bad service. Two female bartenders (wearing just a bra I might add) were talking sh*t and goofing off, not paying attention to customers. My friend and I sat there for more than 5 minutes waiting for service while nobody else was even at the bar... I'M SERIOUS. I practically had to wave my credit card in their faces, and finally they deigned to look at me.

So I showed the girl our drink coupons (buy one/get one for well drinks or beers on tap) and asked for whiskey. She grabs Crown Royal off the top shelf and starts pouring without asking!!!

Crown. Royal. When clearly the drink coupon is for well, and I didn't ask for any name brand. I had to yell at her to stop and give me a well brand, and she got pissed and threw the Crown away and then poured me a 1/4 shot of whiskey and charged me $7 for it.

1/4 shot. For $7. After trying to scam me for Crown Royal.

Who wouldn't like 1000 flatscreen TV's and a mechanical bull.  These created a fun an lively atmosphere, but unfortunately it ends there.

As a bonus, you get a free drink when you check in, which comes in handy when a Margarita costs $12.  I ordered a cup of chilli to start and was asked if I'd like it before my meal, to which I said yes.  My chilli arrived and was great.  It is served with a piece of corn bread.  Very hearty, this can almost be a meal all by itself.  The problem started when my meal arrived one minute after I got my chilli.  I initially ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with the Doritos Mac n Cheese.  As soon as I sampled a rib, I realized why it came out so fast.  The meat was clearly pre-cooked and wasn't sufficiently reheated.  My ribs were actually cold.

We also ordered the Chicken Mac n Cheese and a BLT.  The Chicken Mac n Cheese did not have any desirable taste.  After a lot of salt, pepper and hot sause, a decision was made to give up trying to improve on this disaster.  The BLT comes on a very large piece of bread, but lacks the BLT to compliment the size of the bread.  Ultimately we decided to send back the ribs and mac n cheese and opted for burgers.

The burgers were just OK.  They clearly don't know how to cook them to the appropriate temperatures requested.  Finally our waiter forgot to discount our coupon as well.

While dining a woman came over to take our picture, which we gladly posed for.  While we were trying to eat a second woman, who was extremely rude came over to try to sell us the picture.

I won't be going back to this place.  Service was great, but the food is nothing to write home about. There are a lot more places on the strip that are 10 times better.",Nui0hQjJltTphRSdJDLfxw,0,0,2,ZSMblNlH5PFzeZ8XhHPemQ

PBR Rock Bar & Grill is located at the Miracle Mile Shops inside Planet Hollywood, directly on the Las Vegas Strip. My buddies and I originally wanted to check out Pink's Hot Dogs, but the line was way too long for us to wait. We decided to give PBR Rock Bar & Grill a try since there was no wait and we saw all the LCD screens on the walls. There must be more than 40+ screens spanning the whole establishment. That was pretty crazy.

For my order I tried the Memphis Style BBQ Pork sandwich that came with a sesame seed bun and fire crack coleslaw for $10. I was thinking about ordering the coleslaw as my side, but then I noticed it already came with it in my sandwich. I ended up picking Fries as my side. The other side selections available include:

Fries, Potato Salad, BBQ Baked Beans, or Fire Cracker Coleslaw 

The sandwich was very mediocre. The bun was not even toasted and it got soggy fast from the coleslaw. The pork was not flavored very well and was pretty bland. Half way through eating my meal I had to just eat the pork and coleslaw filling because the bun was just that unappetizing.

I might have just picked the wrong dish at PBR, but my friends said their dishes were also 'eh, so-so'.

I think I'll only come back to PBR to try riding their mechanical bull, not their food.",6Ct6xwJt7AJD9amnMkNckA,0,0,2,NRLu0X9ChCUgsfJUtJrAOg
5887608,2015-07-26,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"In town for a company retreat and a party of 11, we walked in excited for lots of drinks and some much needed food. We sat down at the table that was set up for us in the center of the floor and waited for our server. After about 10 minutes of waiting (it was slow) and no water, she came over for drink orders. We put in an order for 6-7 different appetizers and proceeded to make her aware of our Yelp discounts for buy one get one. At this point she directs us to the bar to order our drinks, ""that will take me 20 minutes, you'll need to make your order at the bar and show them your voucher and stormed off. I don't know about you, but it seems a tad unrealistic for 11 people to make their way to the bar to place a drink order. Hence, the reservation. I'd a also like to point out we were not splitting the bill, this would all be on one check.  Seems like a good opportunity for some $$$$, right?

The owner of our company made his way to the front to speak with a manager. He had to wait behind another very unsatisfied customer who was speaking with the manager about the service received. (Bad sign eh?) 

He came back to the table, we waited for 5 minutes and no one addressed our concerns or apologized. 

Our group of 11 stood up and made our way to Cabo Wabo. Needless to say this was a very poor experience, I would not recommend it (especially to a group).",WiX-z39HRThSQmfQBW-UQA,0,0,1,ZI6O5dyYHznlXOMwDRzocA

Better than your average restaurant/bar food for sure. I noticed some healthy options on there as well but who buys healthy in Vegas! I had a jalapeño burger with sweet potato tater tots. It was so good, I ate the entire . Atmosphere was fun- we got to watch the drunk girls rip their pants and fly off the mechanical bull. The waiter split our checks for us (how annoying that is, very nice of him) and I loved the location. We sat outside (Right near the strip where you can watch everything and everybody go by).

5897785,2014-09-22,0,BORPULADzZV6_LJZzcsywQ,"This place is A-Ok. It is certainly in a prime area in Las Vegas. The location is right on the strip and is within the Planet Hollywood building.  I love the fact that this bar has an outdoor seating area equipped with misters. It wasn't especially hot the day I was there, but the misters were very refreshing. 

Our server was very quick with service and took good care of us. There were lots of TV's to watch football. It was fun to see so many different teams represented. 

The menu was a little confusing, but had a lot of options. There are large, fish bowl type drinks, a couple beers on tap, a cider, and bottles. Not a great selection. I know it's a PBR bar but nothing they had really appealed to me. I considered a mixed drink, but all it showed on the menu was their $45 fish bowls. Another comment on the menu, it was grossly sticky and worn down. When it's just a paper menu, it gives a bad first impression that they're used 500,000 times before you get it. I didn't quite understand why there were fries and such included, but then a list of items on the side. 

Now for the food. I ordered the fajita's. They came quickly and were delicious. The food tasted fresh and was worth the $15. The only problem was that there were only 4 corn tortillas and enough food for 9 tortillas. 

The overall feel of the place was nice, but a little dirty. They could use a little more attention to detail and new menus and this place could easily be 4-5 star rating.",L1dxlir4m_yyBJhmA7kO4w,2,0,3,Vw6z6146uij8EK-B9E0HqQ

Caprese salad: The grilled chicken was extremely moist and delicious, and the vegetables were fresh. My only gripe is that it was overdressed, making the salad mix limp and overly soggy. 

Sweet potato tots: I don't see this very often, so I just had to try it! Definitely an experience...I think I like sweet potato fries better, but this was a neat way to munch on somethin' sweet--especially since they give you maple syrup on the side!

Firecracker cole slaw: My buddy and I both expected something hot and spicy, but there were poprocks inside the slaw! Interesting concept, though it wasn't to my liking. 

Brisket: Yummm...fall apart tender with a good BBQ sauce on top. It wasn't the best brisket I've had, but this isn't exactly a BBQ joint made JUST for BBQ...so it's A-OKAY in my book!

My friends also got chicken and waffles (he DEVOURED it...must've been good) and Doritos Mac N' Cheese, which was also pretty good and unique. Overall, I'd say to grab some grub over here if  you can't figure out what to eat, but want to watch the game.

I had the nacho chips and a bacon wrapped hot dog. I know I am a fatty :P 

The nacho chips are really good. I think it was the cheese sauce! Either way, I highly suggest it! The hot dog on the other hand was okay, Nothing like the hot dogs you get in the streets of LA after a night of clubbing. Then again, I might just be to drunk to notice that they taste horrible. LoL. 

Over all the food here is good. You really can't go wrong with anything...

REALLY BAD. I don't know who to blame. The manager for only having 2 waiters for all of the patio area or the 2 waiters. I am leaning towards the manager O_o.  

Who honestly schedules 2 waiters on the 4th of July for all of the patio area? I honestly felt bad for the guy. 



--[ Conclusion ]--

We came here on 4th of July because we were assured by the staff at PBR that we would get the best seats to see the fireworks outside.

I'm not much of a ""clubber"" so this place really fits the bill when I've had too much casino and need an enjoyable way to spend the night. The food here is alright; the bucket of wings and tater tots are pretty good as far as finger foods go and reasonably priced considering the prime location.

However, what really appeals to me about PBR Rock Bar are the drink specials, which in my experience are unparalleled on the Strip. They have a different special every night, but I think your best bet is to try and get there for an open bar. Wednesday is open bar for college students (although I think you can still do it for a slightly higher price if you're not a college student) and Sunday night is $10 open bar just for following them on Twitter. You can't beat it!

Even the bartender Cara told him a few times not to be nosy because he even asked my buddy who happens to work for the same company how much he makes.

We were not asked any questions by Jeffery but told we were cut off (btw my buddy had not has a alcoholic drink at all). I asked why and Jeffery said because he had a complaint.  If the bartender Cara's only concern is tips then you should not be allowed to over serve a regular then take shots with them. I asked for the General managers card and the Gil and Jeffery would not give it to me it was not until I had to reenter to have one of the other personnel give me Matt Aldrich's card.
