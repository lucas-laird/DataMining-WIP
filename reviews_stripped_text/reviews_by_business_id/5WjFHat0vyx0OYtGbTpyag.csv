The long John that I order from Vons tastes better then that, the custard in their long john was like straight from the can then tried our friends Katsu curry and that didn't even have taste it was so plain and even their mac salad.

I ordered a scoop of Mac salad, one spam masubi, one bbq chicken skewer, and the poke bowl. I could have ate an entire bowl of the Mac salad, it was delicious! The spam masubi didn't disappoint either. The skewer was cooked perfectly. Not dry and full of flavor. 

Now, I don't remember what poke I got, it was one with onions, and they were REALLY STRONG. I took them out and the rest of the bowl was ok, but I mean they aren't really known for their poke, so it wasn't  a huge deal to me.

2079702,2018-03-29,0,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"I don't know about this place.... I mean, we went just specifically to taste the food. So we ordered the J's bento, Pacific bento and side pork hash as well as a long john. I can always tell when my husband doesn't like his food, he'll get quiet and he won't eat it all. He's the type to never waste food, but he didn't like the battered fish and kalbi and he tried the pork hash and said it was hard. He ate some katsu and left the rest. As for my bento... I hate when people make LOTS of food that doesn't taste that good. I don't care how much food you give me, if it doesn't taste good, I'm not coming back and I'll let my friends know it's not good. I was waiting at least for a little crunch to the mochiko chicken and it was just fried and plain and just sweet, unlike the kind I've had all my life in Hawaii. I was wondering about their batter or lack of. The pork hash that we heard was so famous, was a disappointment... like big for nothing. This is why I say big food isn't always the greatest food. Like my hubby said, it was hard and was a big blob of pork and some simple flavoring, I almost felt like they skimped out on ingredients and opted instead to make it bigger than the normal pork hash, but really  the size just diverts from the lack of visual appeal and taste. The chow fun was meh at best, although I did like that it actually had vegetables in there. I tried the teriyaki meat and it was hard, I didn't care for the flavor. So the only thing I ate was some noodles and a couple pieces of mochiko chicken and a bite of hot dog and rice, really you can't screw that one up. Finally the long john... again I think the theme here is ""go big or go home"" it's a good size, but my husband didn't like it, he thought it was doughy. We didn't want to be rude because the owner's wife was right there talking to other people, so we wrapped up our food and took it home only to be thrown away the next day. Goes to show, looks and size isn't everything especially for food. I'd much rather have less food but delicious. Taste is the reason I would go back for more, but I don't think we'll attempt this place again.",vJ2yKaZXzhF_0gFBkOAq2A,0,0,2,lObju_D4Pq8IYQyJ4KjwyQ

I asked it was confirmed. They cant advertise it as such because of legal issues but they can re sell.

This place is clean and again folks are nice.

what can they do better:
tell folks its Zippy's chili
add more mayo to your mac salad
its so dry and that's not local style.

3236209,2018-05-19,0,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"I noticed this place a few months ago and made it a point to one day check it out, today was that day.

I walked in and immediately could hear Hawaiian music playing over head, already giving me the feeling of nostalgia of being back home in Hawaii at a local Mom & pop restaurant which is very much like being back in the islands.

The restaurant is small with a few tables, aloha shoyu can be seen on all the tables, another detail to make a Hawaiian like me feel at home.

I perused the menu & ordered the large fried plate, 15 pieces of pork hash, & J's bento.

The cashier will make you feel like family & the wait for the food wasn't very long though they did have quite a few patrons.

I have to say the food is very good.

J's bento includes chow fun (very local to Chinese food in Hawaii), Redondo's hot dog, mochiko chicken, and teri beef, all sitting on a huge portion of rice.

The fried rice has all my favorite things, char sui, egg, spam, etc...if your one person, perhaps you should consider the smaller portion as the large is perfect for two people.

15 pieces of pork hash. Traditionally, pork hash (a type of potsticker) are usually in small bit s size pieces- but these are huge in portions. If your ever having a Hawaiian potluck, this would be my recommendation!

I'm excited to try other dishes on the menu.

It's not a big menu with tons of selections, I like that they are keeping it simple without so much confusion.

Poke, cone sushi, long johns, Kalbi, teri beef, & island style chicken is also available.

If your in the area & craving some Hawaiian fare, I would recommend this place!

I will be ordering from them again in the near future. Perhaps you may also!

This place is definitely filled with Aloha Spirit.  Great Aloha service each time I've gone in.

A few things I've tried here is their J's Bento Box:  Rice, Fried Mochiko Chicken, Teriyaki Beef, Chow Fun Noodle, 100% Beef Hotdog & 1 Pork Hash.  Excellent to my liking's.  

The Chow Fun on my next visit was nice and still piping hot when I got home.  The order was plenty for a small order which I like.  The flavor of the chow fun each time I got it was different but still good.

The pork hash here is always good.  Brings me back to when I was younger and the manapua truck that came around after school with pork hash.  Glad this place is near my work.  Not a far place to get my island fix during the week.

3433021,2018-02-14,0,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"Over the weekend, we had family visiting which means we ate a lot of food, specifically Hawaiian-style food.  Once they left, all I really wanted was a salad, until I saw Pacific Island Taste's business page come up on my Facebook feed.

So off to Charleston and Maryland Pkwy on Sunday, patiently sitting through traffic on the 15-N while I drove to keep my husband from complaining.

I pulled into the small parking lot for the little strip mall that Pacific Island Taste is located. It was strange for me because I felt like I pulled into the parking lot of a similar strip mall back in Kalihi!!!  To say the least, I was feeling nostalgic.

We walked in and up to the counter to order. I was ready because I've been craving pork hash (pork shumai), manapua (steamed pork bun) and chow fun.  While waiting for the counter help to take our order, my husband and I couldn't help but oooh and aaaah over the large sized pork hash that walked by us along with J's bento plate.  So although I thought my husband was going to get the bento, he ended up getting a chili frank plate.  And of course, we can't forget the ahi limu poke.  Per the counter help, limu is flown in from HI!!

My bill came out to $58. Don't be upset and think they are over priced.  On the contrary, I believe they are reasonably priced. My husband posted on FB about Pacific Island Taste. Today, my husband's friend commented that he went today and spent over $60. These Hawaiian's are homesick for food that takes them back to a simpler place and time.  Therefore, we are willing to splurge and enjoy the leftovers.

15-piece pork hash is priced at $11.88.  One size of their pork hash is 3 pork hash from Royal Kitchen in downtown Honolulu, or so it seems. But it's big.

I ordered a plate of chow fun at $12.99.  Again, the portions are large so not only did I have a fourth of it for lunch, my husband and I had 2/3 of it for dinner and I had the rest for my breakfast.

The manapua, because it is steamed and not baked had more mana than pua'a. And I believe this is what filled me up during lunch that I wasn't able to eat as much chow fun as I would have liked. Hopefully, they'll introduce baked manapua to their menu.

I was able to taste my husband's chili plate. Although it isn't zippy's chili, it sure is close to it. It was so good, my husband had chili mustache :D

And the poke with limu...so so so ONO!

The restaurant does have a small baked goods section.  But even at 12 pm on Sunday, all that was left was an empty tray of powdered sugar outline of a large eclair :(  We were told that only six dozen are made per day.  If you want some, you have to call ahead of time to reserve. 

Service was great. Super nice people.  For me, it is apparent that these are humble beginnings for them and they are willing to work very hard for you and I. 

The restaurant is clean.  The restaurant is on the smaller side with four tables allowing seating of 16 people only. However, with the amount of people coming in, ordering and having to take out because of the lack of seating, I hope they are so successful that they can move to a centralized location that is larger and can accommodate their fans.

The Kalbi was cooked to perfection and the sauce that was marinated with was absolutely delicious. My bf loved the Kalua Pork. The portions were big and we had lots of leftover.

The mahi was cooked perfectly. Pork hash is a winner. She gave us a sample to try. The long johns were to die for. The only negative is that the fried rice was a little to greasy, but the favor was good. Although it is a small place, it is filled with lots of Aloha.

4621707,2018-03-27,3,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"Small, but spacious family owned spot with 4 tables inside. 

Portions are good for what you pay for. 

Ordered the Katsu Curry Loco Moco under breakfast & the fried mochiko chicken. 

Katsu Loco Moco comes with chicken catsu drenched in curry gravy over 2 scoops of rice & 2 eggs. Not a fan of curry, but you can smell the spices within the dish. My boyfriend said he'd rather have Japanese curry (irrelevant lmao). 

The mochiko chicken comes over cabbage along with rice & a side of Mac salad. It was pretty good & crispy, BUT. I feel like it was missing something. My suggestion would be to include a side of teriyaki sauce or other sauce to go with the plate. The chicken was somewhat plain (not bad though). I decided to dip it into sriracha, which made it better.

They have a water dispenser for self serving. 

Service is great. Since Vegas is a tourist spot, they ask you where you're from, why you're visiting, etc. They offer suggestions on the menu & tell you what's most popular. I would come again to try other items on the menu.",FOy0Qrkw54VKDEWIw7T-jw,5,6,4,Cou9XdhuLAveJmq1Jiha2g

Upon arriving, I realized this is a restaurant that fits the stereotype of being located at Charleston and Maryland. Don't come to Pacific Island Taste looking for a fancy dining experience. 

I ordered the J's Bento Box because I wanted to try the fried Mochiko chicken. It comes with fried Mochiko chicken, teriyaki beef, chow fun, Redondo hot dog, pork hash, and rice. It's a ton of food, but I was disappointed. The chow fun was extremely greasy and the teriyaki beef was overly sweet. On the plus side, the Mochiko chicken was delicious.

4676838,2018-06-24,0,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"First time here on a Saturday evening. The place is in a tiny strip mall. A few tips, there's no fountain drinks also no outside food or drinks. Staff was super friendly, they have breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have a small selection of pastries including long johns which are my fave. If you don't know what those are, they're basically powdered donuts that are filled with custard or vanilla pudding that are long in shape. 
We got the J's bento box, pork hash, side of fries, ahi limu poke and chow fun. I think the chow fun noodles were a little too soft, basically over cooked. The pork hash pi was a little over cooked too. So why 5 stars? Well, when comparing this place to other Hawaiian food places in Vegas, the taste of the food comes pretty close to the real stuff. I appreciate the prices too, the pork hash were pretty big! 
I'd definitely visit this little hole in the wall again. It was clean, and the restroom was decent too.",9VljRRFnivDCtc2gDaJsNg,0,0,5,kvu25GQE3D_9V1r8GVbVtw

5158575,2018-06-14,1,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"A solid 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up . 

We came in for lunch and dined in. It's clean and comfortable in a small, family-owned kind of way, which is exactly what it is. I'm big on supporting small, local businesses and food is no exception. 

I came here per recommendation of a friend. Service was friendly and prompt. We ordered a Keiki Bento and an Ahi limu poke bowl. I got the J's bento to go for JD.

The Keiki bento comes with a spam musubi, fries and mochiko chicken. It was hot and freshly fried! I had to snag a couple bites before T hoarded it all to himself. The fries and chicken were fried to perfection. My one complaint is that the pieces of chicken were pretty small and I thought the portion size could have been a little bigger. But frankly, it's a great deal coming in at $5.99. 

My poke bowl... WHEW! I can't believe I'd find a place to give Poke Express a run for their money, but dang. The ahi came in huge chunks on a bed of furikake rice. Nothing was over seasoned or salty. It's on special right now, but I'm REALLY hoping they keep it! I eat pretty clean most of the time and would come back on the regular just for that. I HIGHLY recommend you try it! 

The J's bento was for JD and I didn't see it myself because we dropped it off to him at work. Reportedly, he thought it was great but too much rice and not as much meat as he thought there was by the weight of the box. He seemed a bit disappointed in that respect, which I think is understandable. 

Collectively, we all agreed that we'd be revisiting this hidden gem. Authentic Hawaiian is hard to come by in this city that's filled with L&L's and other places of the like. I'm grateful to have been turned on to this spot!

The teriyaki beef was insanely good! The teri sauce wasn't the typical thick sauce you get at most places. It seemed more shoyu based but still had the sweetness of a teri sauce. The pieces of beef were incredibly tender and they used real steak, I think it was rib eye? So good. My BF got the poke bowl and he said it was pretty good. The pork hash was seasoned really well and were huge. The manapua was ok. It was a little dry, maybe from being frozen (not sure if they freeze them but I've had frozen siopao/manapua before and it had the same texture) and the filling was a little bland. Finally, the Long John! It's like a donut bar filled with custard and topped with tons of powdered sugar. You'd think it'd be overly sweet but it wasn't. The custard was thick and rich, the donut part was light and fluffy, and the powdered sugar added just the right amount of sweetness. I'd go back just for these bad boys. 

Staff was friendly and service was quick. They have tons of options I'd be interested in trying so I'm sure I'll be back again.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,2,1,4,hpsNkUYR7DqVIEJBxuYMWQ

I LOVE PORK HASH...and this is one of the few Hawaiian spots that sell it in town.  These pork has are humongous ....$.99 each or $11.99 for 15.  I always opt for the 15 and freeze some for later =).  These remind of the ones they sell at 7 eleven in Oahu.  The other stand out item is mochiko chicken,  the coating is the perfect sweet, savory, crunchy.

5583813,2018-01-27,0,5WjFHat0vyx0OYtGbTpyag,"My family and friends have been supporters of the business as long as I can remember. I was extremely excited when the owners decided to open a location near Maryland Prkwy and Charleston since it was a bit of a distance before. My mother and I decided to visit the location the other day since coming across an uploaded post of their chicken katsu curry while scrolling on FB. The location is very accessible, however during extremely busy business hours, parking can be a bit of a challenge along with the fact that there is also other businesses nearby. That day however, we arrived during almost late afternoon and there was a lot of parking. Amidst entering the restaurant, the atmosphere is very simple and we were warmly greeted by Violet. TBH, while going through their menu, it was a fairly difficult decision to decide on what to order, but as stated earlier, we choose to get the chicken katsu curry and a side order of a 1/2LBS of poke to go. 

Pros: The food was absolutely delicious; the chicken katsu curry was crisp and seasoned well with no bites of undercooked chicken or batter, while the sauce was perfect. The poke on the other hand was fresh made to order and didn't have any fishy aroma. 

Cons: The wait time for our food was a bit tiresome, but knowing chicken takes longer to cook was understandable. In my opinion, I think they focus more on phone and take out orders rather then their dine in customers. The only reason why I state that fact is for those people who happen to stop by and don't have the time to wait. I was a little disappointed in the portion size and the lack of curry sauce along with hoping I could of gotten a side of Mac salad.
