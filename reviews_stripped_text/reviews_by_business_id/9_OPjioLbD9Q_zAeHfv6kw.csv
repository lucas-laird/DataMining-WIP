773424,2016-12-22,1,9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw,"I had to hit up an AYCE hotpot place to break up the monotony of Vegas buffets (don't kill me). My family and I came here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night for early dinner/first meal of the day. You know how we do.

They originally seated us by a dirty dish cart, but they happily moved us into another section when we asked. They told us that they had a promotion going on for 15% off dinner on Saturday night, drinks not included. We ordered the Spicy Mongolian and Mushroom (nonspicy) broths. I love yin-yang pots because you can have the best of two worlds. The consensus at our table was that the Spicy Mongolian broth wasn't spicy enough and the Mushroom broth tasted kind of plain.

Of the food, I loved that the meat was wrapped individually in portions. That preserved freshness of the meat and made it more appealing to me as a diner. The seafood, all in all, was good. The oysters had little grains of sand or something, though, which you could taste after cooking them (I don't recommend eating these oysters raw). Some other things didn't look very fresh - the wood ear mushrooms, pig ear (cold appetizer), and some vegetables. But, in general, I thought it was all good. I also liked that it was pretty much well-stocked every time I went up there. The sauce bar was totally legit - they had more options than a lot of other places do.

Service was okay, but not great. They only came by to clear our plates twice: once on their own and once when we had to go up and ask. Eventually, we just walked our own dirty plates to the cart. Oddly enough, they did come by to refill our soft drinks even though it was self-serve by the fruit.

Overall, a decent experience and some decent food. I would probably want to try other hotpot places before coming back to The Red Pot, but I would also love to come back here.",NXwCnNHTI4kEQQTgXry5Xw,2,1,3,EPpS23nGUoorWHcZvBbFCg

After you order your broth, you can immediately go grab food from the shelves. They have a large selection of seafood and fish balls. Their meat and vegetable selections were decent as well. You make your own sauce. I always put in red chili sauce, siracha, extra cilantro, garlic, ponzu, and sesame sauce. In addition, you can ask for rice that is included in AYCE. 

We ordered the spicy Chinese herb soup (I forgot the exact name) and the Japanese miso. The spicy broth definitely has a strong flavor to it. It is my favorite. It's not very spicy IMO, but then again I love spicy food. If you don't want spicy, try the Japanese miso. The broths are pretty bland when you get them. The broth will develop more depth and flavor once you start cooking the food. 

Verdict: I'm definitely coming back here when we go to Vegas. Only drawback is the price. I think it's slightly expensive for hot pot, but I ate till the spandex on my leggings were hurting my stomach so.... I guess it's okay. Haha",ED6VtjBAKnHBDxBw2yZ8sQ,0,0,4,4mI_xYJlsq8UkPs858slPA

The ambience is fair, I like the option of having two kind/type of broth to boil my selected seafood. The broth was tasty and well seasoned. 
For the service... there's not much to comment as they only appear to get your pot started and provide you the drinks you order. I order some sort of tea... it was serve in a nice tall glass with a straw. Well, I'm not sure if I'm just too short for the chair but I felt like a toddler needing a booster seat  to enjoy that drink. I wish they will consider reducing the height of the table or increasing the height of the chair and/bench. I will Truly enjoy my meal much better if I can see what I'm scooping out of the pot and to let my glass remain on the table instead of me holding it so my mouth can reach the rim of the glass.

We were surprised by their prices.  $30 per person for all you can eat.  But in reality, you're drinking one hot pot soup so think of it as $30 for one hot pot soup.  The first red flag was when the waiter came by and described the soups but then wouldn't let us try so we knew what we were in for.  If you have so many options, at least give us a spoonful to try.  Next, the produce and meats weren't fresh and were terrible quality.  The soup was also not that great.

Throughout our time there, the whole waiting staff was giving us attitude, wouldn't bring items or had attitude about it and would only come by every 20 mins.  Terrible service.  Nevertheless, we will not be going back for $30 hot pot.  Oh and not to mention, we were there for dinner on Friday and the place was D-E-A-D.  We saw two other tables of two people and that was it for the whole night!

At first, the concept is overwhelming. The choices of ingredients is massive with meats, seafood, and vegetables. The meat & seafood wall ranges from your typical beef, chicken & lamb to frog legs, shrimp, mussels, oysters, crab, fish, tofu, octopus and calamari...to name a few. Then another wall is loaded with veggies that would resemble an international produce market. They also provide 2 bars loaded with sauces...too many to name, of which you can create your own favorites.
Their soup menu is varied but beware...the spicy broths are very spicy. Fortunately, you get 2 broth choices so we ordered one spicy & one not. We know now to stick with non-spicy & add our own from the sauce bar. They also offer fresh fruit & macaroons for dessert.
The dinner price is $35 per person BUT it's all you can eat and they gave us a 20% discount automatically. Not sure if it was a promotion or not. But for 3 of us, it came to $95 which included a $4 drink & tax.
We were very impressed not only with the food, but the concept and the decor. We will return the next time we're in Vegas.",GSxRrtQP5X0JHWT4gkwpXw,3,1,4,v5YhbYliSZ-Nved2nPYFeg

Also the setup for the different meats, noodles and veggies was unique.  You have an option to pick one or two broths for cooking.  I chose Spicy Mongolian Herb and the Premium Seaweed.  The quality of the food was similiar to your regular Chinese buffet.  However this place had various types of veggies like lotus root, black fungus, and bamboo.  As far as meats go there was octopus, filet of sole, salmon, mussels, clams and lamb shoulder.  The broth was decent but not mindblowing.  I did inform the server that I was dining there for the first time.  Despite giving me a discount for trying them out, they charged me $5 extra since I was eating there alone.  The Red Pot also offers free unlimited soda refills on those thirsty days.  The Red Pot is a hit or miss even for locals.

This is the kind of place where you tell them what kind broth you want.  It's up to you to decide what choices of meats, vegetable, and/or seafood you want to cook yourself in the broth that is brought to your table.

I would've given this place 5 stars.  Unfortunately, my friend had decided to cook some crab in his broth (separate from mine).  After his crab was cooked, there was a VERY strong odor of ammonia coming from it.  Luckily, this was towards the end of our meal.  More lucky that he smelled it before he ate it, otherwise, it would've made for a long night in the local ER.  When we brought up the issue with our waiter, he informed us he would get the manager on duty.  The manager took quite a while to get to us.  There seemed to be tons of excuses.  We were sitting there thinking to ourselves quit wasting time with your excuses and correct the issue before someone gets seriously ill.  We were not looking for compensation.  We were simply bringing attention to a very dangerous situation.

Had the manager responded more quickly and appropriately to this situation, I would definitely be giving 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I'm only giving this place 3 stars due to what seemed like his lack of concern.

On a positive note, he did remove the rest of the crab in question that was sitting in the chillers for the public to get a hold of.  Too bad this wasn't his action immediately after being informed of the situation.",QEHoYKMynY7LaAnzsVXR-w,2,0,3,ZZc6IOB0T2RU_UUR5ilLHw

The location is good, the restaurant is very clean and modern, and the selection of food at lunch is great. It is a good mix of seafood, meats, and vegetables. We liked that the vegetable selection is so wide and varied. 

Maybe as it was a weekday and the restaurant was not so busy that we did not experience the subpar service that others have mentioned. 

We did not know how to mix the sauces so maybe a couple of premixed ones to help novices like us would be great. Still, that is not enough to warrant a negative. It was nice that there were many options when it comes to sauces as well.

First of all, we went for lunch, which is around $22 but we used the 20% winter special so it went down to $18 per person. The place looks really nice. It's spacious and well ventilated. We picked the spicy Mongolian herb (mild) and mushroom soup base based on our waitress's recommendation and what I read on yelp. We were all pleasantly surprised to find that they actually did use herbs and mushrooms for the soup instead instant powder. We did prefer the spicy mongolian herb more than the mushroom. The flavor was too mild for the mushroom soup. 

As for the food itself, there are a lot of vegetables and different mushrooms for you to pick out. They even have some noodles if you really wanted some (udon, vermicilli, glass noodle, ramen). The meat selection included generous portions beef, lamb, chicken, and pork on a little platter you can take back to your table. If you can't finish all the meat, the waitress there assured us that it was fine. They were all thinly sliced, like what you would see at a Korean bbq. It also tasted like the meat you would find in a Korean bbq = not tender. That was disappointing because as a Chinese restaurant, we expected something different. 

I was actually really excited for the seafood portion. I know there are tons more options during dinner time but I was looking forward to the mussel and clams. But when I went there to select what I want, they were already cooked. I can understand why it was cooked but at the same time, it means that it's not fresh and the hot pot is only used to warm it up. There were also fish and octopus for you to choose from. Also, a lot of different types of fishballs. I think we ate a lot of those. There were a lot of other different things you could eat such as cow tripe, etc. Mostly my parents ate that. 

The sauce bar was really interesting. There was a lot of different sauces and condiments to choose from. My mom had fun experimenting with it. 

All in all, my entire family agreed that it would have been worth it, if we had more fresh food, seafood or otherwise, because we did think that some items probably sat there for a while. The selection here isn't something you can easily replicate at home since it'll take a lot of work. However, for the same price point, I would rather go eat an acye sushi. I don't know about dinner. It might be a different experience since there are a lot more selection. At the same time, it's $35 without any discounts.",Md4Yb113ykjPasmWeg6r_A,3,1,3,PgrpoT-W3BM7yROEQ_u40g

I didn't really care for the Mongolian herb soup on its own as it was too ""herby"" for me, but it did lend good flavor to the items we put in the pot. The Tom yum was ok, however, the flavor of the soup improved after we boiled some seafood in it. This one was good for slurping. 

They had a large selection of seafood, meatballs, dumplings, etc. on ice under plastic containers. Everything looked pretty clean and organized. Being a shorty, I did have a harder time reaching the items on the top shelf. For the most part the seafood items were ok quality; some were pre-cooked. I liked the fish roe dumplings and quail eggs. I was looking for the scallops mentioned in some other reviews, but there were none.

There were platters of thinly sliced lamb shoulder, beef pork and chicken available. We had the lamb, beef, and pork. I would say they were the best items, but since they were frozen, it was a pain to pry the slices off the plate. 

There was also a large assortment of vegetables and noodles. Didn't really partake in much from this area besides the enoki mushrooms (yum). 

Small dessert area with some coconut cookies and fruit, pretty forgettable and seemed like an afterthought. Didn't bother me though, as I was more than stuffed already.

Strongly recommend the spicy mongolian herbal broth if you like spicy food. Alcohol was also reasonably priced here (4 dollars for a beer). The dinner is on the pricey side ($28 per person after the discount), but given what you are eating and that you can easily consume $30 worth of seafood in one sitting without even trying, I can't really complain too much about the price.

As she went to get our soup she told my husband and I to go ahead and pick out our selections to cook. They have a lot to choose from. I mainly did seafood and my husband got seafood & some lamb. As we were going back to our table we noticed a server had seated another party at our table. The hostess was no where to be found because she had gone to the kitchen to get our soups. My husband and I waited at the sauce bar to catch the hostess. But we didn't have to inform her of the situation because once she saw that another party was seated at our table she informed the server of her mistake and moved the party to another table.

We got to the car and realized we were short so my bf went in and without hesitation she took a $20 that was part of another table payment and gave it to him. ( Things that make you want to go hmmmm) She did not retrace the transaction or question if he was sure she gave the wrong change.

I've tried four broths and all of them tasted authentic.  Shabu grill (a different ayce hot pot) has very vague broths, and this place blows them out of the water.  I tried the miso, Mongolian, tom yum, and tomato.  All of them were amazing.  They tasted how you imagine them tasting like. 
The food is frozen, but once you cook them you can tell they are frozen fresh.  They give you good portions of meat.  The one complaint I have is the lack of choices with their meats.  They only have three different meats beef, pork, and lamb.  I would love to see different cuts of each animal and from different places on the body.  
They have an immense vegetable and seafood selection, which I love about this place.  It makes the $35 a dinner worth it to me.  
I dont understand the complaints about the waitresses because I'm always checked up on and have my drinks refilled. I mean, it IS a self serve type of restaurant so what do you expect? Her to hold your hand and help you pick your veggies? Grow up.

This is not a place that I would have gone if it were just my husband and I. Thank goodness we went with two other couples experiencing this for the first time. So we were hesitant but open minded at the same time.

Let me just make this clear, this isn't shabu shabu. I totally suck at shabu shabu, but that's another story. In short, shabu shabu is Japanese SOUP that you cook; you add the flavor for your broth, your meats and vegetables. Hot Pot is Chinese (not sure which part of China) and is a STEW that you add your ingredients to including,thin cut meats, vegetables and seafood.

At Red Pot, the very large bowl is split in two. You pick a regular and spicy stew broth. My husband and I went with mixed mushroom and yellow curry.

While waiting for the stew to come out, we went to get our stew contents.

Because we sat at a table that fits six, our table had three burners, one for each couple.  When the broth came, the burners were turned on for us.

This is an all you can eat Hot Pot. Because the pots are large and there's some much broth, you can go back and try all the different produce they have. The meats are cut thin, so it takes less than a minute for it to cook, which the waitress showed us how to cook our meat. Our waitress recommended the lamb.

They even have different types of noodles in case you want to make a noodle soup. I would suggest going with the thin noodles because the thicker noodles takes too long to cook.

There is no dessert but they do offer fruit. After eating so much and with the different flavors, it is refreshing to follow up the meal with fruit.

As for drinks, I got my favorite, a tall glass of lychee iced green tea.

I know people that just love shabu shabu. Hot pot is more my style. However, if you've never done this, I recommend doing both.

What stood out to me the most when first walking in is the lavish decorations. The restaurant looks very upscale and clean. The sauce bar is fairly extensive as well.

There are A LOT of hot pot items to cook, and they are all of decent quality (though not exceptional). You also have a good number of broths to choose from, and they have the split pots so you can pick two for one pot. I also like how large the pots are, it makes cooking easier.

Service isn't amazing but I didn't find it terrible either.

We ordered the Spicy Mongolian Herbal(delicious) and the Mushroom Broth(pretty much just tasted like mushroom water, it deff needs the additions of meats, veggies, and sauces to taste good). Selections of meats & veggies were many, but not everything was tasty. The Seafoods & veggies were not labeled, so we ended up selecting a few things we really didn't like.(trial & error). Pretty much every fish ball they had tasted the same with something funny tasting about them.(Why have different things that taste exactly the same?!!). Beef & pork were yummy. Love the diff types of noodles. Some of the veggies looked questionable, I'm guessing it's because they prob just throw everything back in the freezer every night. Bok Choy tonight were mostly wilted and looked a few days old. I must say though, their seafood selections are pretty great. The crab, oysters, and shrimp make it worth the price. 

The service on the other hand was very lacking. The servers were nice enough, but their tending to the tables sucked. I had to keep asking for a refills, then napkins, the check too. I literally watched all 3 servers walk by and take our empty plates(right next to my empty cup) and walk away. Being in Las Vegas, little things like that while you're dining makes all the difference if you want locals to eat there regularly! Then to top it off, the servers all kept their attention on the tables near us, I'm guessing they're all friends/coworkers because there was constant talking and hanging out. Hanging out is all good & dandy, but you gotta be on top of your work! 

By the end of the meal, I let one of our servers know we were done. She said ok. As time goes on, she still hasn't returned with our check. The same 3 servers rotate through our section, I finally get attention of one after she finishes her conversation with her friends again, to ask for our check since telling the other girl we were done did nothing.  It's not like they were busy either, there were 3 parties on our section!

Management, you need to talk with your serving staff about their service and attention to customers. I would love to talk up this place right now to friends n family, but I'm not and that's sad. This place could be great.",SvSctkkriCsxOHW1KvBPBA,0,0,2,0tOaSuSFljUJR6G9DJBm7w

First off, this place is big, I thought there might be a wait at 730 pm on a Saturday night but I didn't have to worry. I think part of it is that the place is not in Chinatown so they have the benefit of space. The waitress suggested two broths the Spicy Mongolian Herbal and Japanese Miso. I didn't find the spicy one spicy, and couldn't really taste the miso, but I tend to use the broth for cooking not drinking. There was a modest selection on meats, I would have liked to see different cuts of beef or even beef tendon (not beef ball tendon - which I didn't understand). There was a good selection of seafood, and there were even frog legs. On the veg side, a good amount of options, I like the tofu skins, cloud ear fungus, baby corn, bok choy, shiitake, etc. There were all kinds of noodles to cook too if you wanted to load up on carbs. The sauce bar had a really good variety of ingredients, but I would have liked to have suggestions in how to mix them up.

The service was good, but I'm sure it depends on who you have and the busyness level. Our waitress filled our drinks on a regular basis and took the plates at a decent interval. She filled the broth as we needed it. She did a great job of taking care of the table.

Here you don't have to wait for food, you just get up and get it when you want it. Then you can get the amount of food you want and can try many different things. 

For newbies as I was, there is an island near the meat section that has extra plates, sauce bowls, and utensils. 

I'm not sure if I would be back, as I would have like more meat options, but really for the price, currently $35 for dinner plus 15% off, it's a decent deal for all you can eat. Give the place a try at least once, and it's always better with friends as you can have a lot of fun cooking together.",VwjalVuMTfQcmSoUhZ2vyw,2,0,4,UyOLCNgarXkYBytY-SnKJg

Food: you start off with choosing two broths that are set up ying-yang style at your table. I highly recommend the sour tomato because it's flavorful enough to eat with your food and drink with your noodles, yet not overpowering. We also got the  Mongolian herbal broth but that was way too plain, it tasted like water soaked in some of the basic veggies from the fridge. Red Pot offers a vast variety of seafood (from clams to fish balls), pork/lamb shoulder/beef/chicken slices in the freezer, and vegetables (from bamboo to bok choy). Plus, two counters worth of sauces to mix a concoction to your taste. 

Price: my parents and I were so impressed with how cheap it was because we definitely ate our money's worth and more. It's $22 per person for lunch and 10% off for checking in Yelp. Dinner is $35 per person and 15% off discount with Yelp. If you think AYCE sushi or kbbq is great, TRY HOT POT! 

Service: the service was mediocre. I had to ask for my drink to be refilled twice, and they never check on us; keep in mind, only four other tables were occupied besides us and my group came right at 11 AM. Luckily, the food in the fridges/freezers were always stocked, and everything seemed clean and not cluttered --so that's a plus!

Overall: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Now that the weather is getting colder, hot pot is the best way to enjoy a meal with family and friends. It's affordable, delicious, and a fun hands-on lunch or dinner experience. I'm taking 1 star away because some of their items were super frozen and not the freshest, and their soup choices are disappointing.",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,37,22,4,R60-QcJi6RWhOQ9kFZaZlw

To begin with, I am not a fan of paying for a meal that I cook myself be it shabu shabu, hot pot like this, Korean BBQ, or some of the steakhouses that bring you a super heated stone on which you grill your own steak.

We chose a spicy red curry broth and a mild broth.  The server brought the ying-yang pot while we were picking the food we were going to cook.  She had also told us that she would answer any questions we had but I didn't see her again until we were ready to leave.

The area with the noodles, mushrooms, and vegetables is easy to know what you're getting.  The meats are marked.  There was a whole section of small frozen items.  I had no idea what any of that was because there were no signs.  I picked up a couple of things there and then returned to the table.

The pot was bubbling away nicely and I started putting different items in the broth.  Since some of the items are frozen to maintain freshness, you need to let it cook in the broth for a fair amount of time.  My favorite items were the enoki mushrooms, the lotus root, and the tofu.  We both skipped the meats and had a vegan lunch.

I did not go back for a second plate of food.  After the amount shown in my photo, I was done and didn't want any more.

Only draw back is a lot of stuff weren't labeled, such as in vegie and seafood section...so we had to do a lot of guessing what we grabbed....there are plenty of meat in one plate, since it was frozen so it's a bit hard to get it out of the plate, there are so many selections and I was pretty impressed on how many selections they have.

It may seem overwhelming with food but it's not very much. They dont refill the foods right away so you have to pick the left overs to eat. Not worth the uber there and back from the strip.

Broths tasted okay and minimal options were a let down. There were so many different types of balls, you basically had no idea what you were eating. There was one that tasted good but when you went back for more you cant tell which one is which.

You'll need it - it's $35pp.   For an AYCE, it's priced similar to Todai, Rama, and a few other places, but cheaper than beef radizio Texas De Brazil,etc.  
So, picked the mushroom broth and spicy curry combo for the pot.  To get eat $35 of boiled seafood, you might pick the crab, shrimp, or other, but eating hot boiled or overboiled crab was not my pleasure.   For the curry side, I picked chunks of whitefish, salmon, shrimp for flavor, and calamari rings with a few scallops.  Green onion, garlic and soy for garnish.  
For the mushroom side, bok choy, udon, and some chinese parsley garnished sliced chicken.  I think it needed more spices, which were readily available, but didn't know the other person's flavor limits.  
My dinner partner enjoyed the noodles, but for $35, we could have gone somewhere else for a lot less.  We both enjoyed the fresh (farm?) salmon we ate like sashimi with soy sauce.  

It would be nice to have a recipe suggestion list for curry or other broths,  so its not so hit-and-miss.   Like miso? try a, b, c, with veggies d, e, f.   Like curry?  Try blah, blah blah with seafood items.

Induction cooktops on every table with huge ying-yang pots on top. (Basically a pot with 2 chambers so you can have two different broths to cook your food in)

If you've never had hot pot before, you basically pick your proteins, vegetables, etc and throw them in the pot of broth that's boiling. It's not your typical Chinese fare, so don't expect a bowl of rice or anything stir fried - your food is literally boiled and cooked in a soup base. The meats are generally sliced so thin that it cooks almost instantly when you dunk it in the broth. The meat and seafood variety at this place is huge, I wish I could have tried everything but it's just not possible.

You then dip your cooked food into a sauce that you make yourself. There's a plethora of sauces and ingredients in a separate area that you can make yourself - I personally like to use a mix of soy sauce and satay.  Towards the end of the meal if you need a carb fix, you can throw some udon or ramen noodles in there (I'm usually too full by that time) and it'll soak up all the amazing flavors that have been cooking in the broth.

Quality and selection of ingredients here is excellent, but do understand that there may be some items that sit there a long time and you may want to observe for yourself on the freshness.

Dessert? Um.. it's pretty non existent. There were a couple fruits and a few almond cookies but that's literally it. Don't set your expeditions high in this area. 

Service? They basically sit you down, get you set up and your first round of drinks.. and you don't really see anyone come by anymore. But you serve yourself here mostly anyway. Don't be afraid to flag them down if you need plates cleared or drinks refilled. Basically this is one of those places where if you don't speak up, they're going to assume you're doing ok.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,0,2,4,pbqZAp_rG-YPrri2Re2ztw

But later, WE FOUND MOLD IN THE FOOD (some sort of tofu). And this was not just a little mold, this mold looks like it's been growing on the food & has been sitting in the same place for WEEKS. It was about 2 INCHES HIGH!!! I wish I was exaggerating! And it wasn't just one piece, once we started looking through the tray there were multiple pieces like that. Made us wonder how long all of the food has been sitting out!! I wish we would've taken a picture for proof but honestly my family and I were too grossed out. 

We complained to our waitress, a few minutes later another waitress came over and stated, ""they asked me to check up on you..."" as if no one wanted to discuss our concerns or make us comfortable. In addition, we asked to speak to a manager to professionally address the situation but we were told they didn't have anyone currently there. We left with a discounted bill we had to fight for, hungry, and disgusted. I'm really not one to complain or make it my mission to write bad reviews.

It's a brand new restaurant, and the inside looks very clean and bright. The price is usually $35pp for dinner, but they were running a promotion for 20% off. So that was a pleasant surprise.

You get to choose 2 broths in one large divided pot for every 2 people. They have spicy and non-spicy flavors. The sauce bar was well-stocked with more than enough choices and had everything that I wanted. There are several types of meats arranged nicely on pre-packaged plates in a large fridge which makes it easy to just pick up and take back to the table. There were a ton of different seafood and meat options, including crab, crawfish, lobster, squid, octopus, shrimp, fish balls, and many more options. There is also vegetable options with plenty to choose from. All the types of food I've had in the past were there, along with more that I hadn't tried in a hot pot before.

The broth flavors tasted great. You can control the temperature at the table. The waiter will add more hot water when the water level is low. He was good about clearing away dirty dishes quickly. All the food was well-stocked for the most part. The only one that wasn't was the lobster which was understandable as it was very high in demand. As soon as they brought out a new plate, it would be gone within seconds. There's also fruit for dessert, which wasn't as well-stocked. But they brought fresh watermelon out just as I got there, and it tasted great. I definitely stuffed myself to the max.

4401382,2016-01-26,4,9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw,"I really enjoy eating hot pot, especially in the winters. I've always eaten it at home but my family decided to try Chinese hot pot outside the home for once. 

You are given two choices of sauce in a cute little yin and yang style pot. We ended up getting seaweed (white) and herbal spice (red). The herbal spice ended up being too spicy for almost everyone.

The Red Pot is an AYCE ""grab it yourself"" style restaurant. They have all kinds of food -- frozen, of course, or keep chilled so you can cook it. 

You even make your own dipping sauce, which is awesome! They offer so many things so you really can get your creative juices flowing. First time here and don't know where to start? Try my recipe: sesame sauce, a pinch of red tofu sauce, a pinch of the greenish sauce next to it (didnt see the name), and a bit of sesame oil. Then I went over to the other side and added cilantro, green onion, a dash of soy sauce, and a wee bit of garlic. Mix together thoroughly and taste. I found that this was too salty for my taste, so I added some water. This also helped the texture become less pasty. 

Other than that, here's what I had and my thoughts:
- Lobster rolls: YUMM! 
- Corn: mediocre... it was so bland, not sweet, tasted old?
- Scallop: yum!
- Masaigo balls: YUMMMM!!!
- Imitation crab: yum
- shrimp: yum

I had some other fish balls that I cant remember the name of, but I didn't particularly like it.

It was extremely slow in there. I think there were maybe 3 other tables in the restaurant, and the staff were all very attentive in refilling the waters and changing plates.

When we got to the end, we went to the back to look for fruits. They had watermelon, lychee, oranges, pineapples, but it seemed to be sitting out all day so we didn't touch it.

The price wasn't worth it, IMHO. It was $35 before the 20% winter discount was applied, which in my opinion was too expensive despite the AYCE concept. Basically, I would have much rather buy my own food at the local market. From now on, hot pot at home!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,8,7,3,9GkmpFjd4-VqoJYrCi4BEQ

Went to Vegas, arrived late (when I visit other places I always look for dining options I don't have at home) My husband and I were hungry, I got on yelp and started looking for Chow Fun, it was 12:15, Chin Chin right across the street, decided to walk, well barely made it before close and all they were serving was Sushi, so back to yelp, decided to try the Red Pot, when we arrived  @ 2 am, nearly EVERY table in the place was littered with wasted food, our waiter (the only employee we ever saw) asked us if we knew how the menu worked and we said no, he responded and pretty much all we understood was we picked 2 soup flavors, it was all you can eat and $49 per person, drinks not included. I said but it is too hot for soup, my husband guessed 2 flavors and we grabbed a couple things that we were not sure what we were going to do with and brought them back, one of those things was beef, it was obviously uncooked, so my husband put it in the boiling pot on the table and I said, lol, have you ever eaten boiled beef? Apparently, he didn;t think so but I pretty much guarantee, he won't be doing it again anytime soon. my husband ate a piece of corn and said it was really good corn.
So I had this seafood dumpling kind of thing that I was hoping was cooked enough, I sunk my teeth into it a bit, I got a hint of the flavor, removed my teeth from the thing, placed it back on my plate and I was done, so was my husband, we drank our sodas and left, it was the worst waste of $100 I ever spent. It certainly was not somewhere that should pop up in a search for Chow Fun, yes they have stuff there that appears to be rice noodles but I have never seen rice noodles that look like clear rubber with air bubbles in it and basically the same texture. We did not bring hardly any stuff to our table to try to begin with, the tables around us had at least 3x the food left on them from customers that already ate and left  We really should only have been charged for our drinks, at the very most 1 person but full price for both of us? Seriously?? I have waited tables for many years in my lifetime and I know how it works generally but I am not one to complain and make a stink so though, dumbfounded we left and went to bed hungry.

Honestly, Hot Pot is something I have NEVER heard of and I highly suspect I will not be trying again, EVER as I highly doubt I would like it no matter who made it judging by the reviews on here, this place is considered pretty good, so it must be me. well actually, me and my husband.

I highly suspect that the particular part of Asia this originates from is Korea, (though I could be wrong) I love Chinese and Japanese food but Korean is a different story, the spices are STRONG and very different  from anything else in my experience and usually strong in odor, WOW ,  odor alone is too much for me to get near it, I did not smell it here but when I bit into that dumpling, to me that is all that hit me was I tasting those spices that cause that odor usually (my son get's some kind of Korean Ramen stuff now and then and I just can't believe he eats anything that smells like that) 

So anyway, if you like Hot Pot, give it a try I guess, if you don't like Hot Pot, I don't think this place is going to be a life changing experience if you don't know if you like hot pot, I suggest  not spending $50 a person to figure it out unless $50 is easy for you to blow on a piece of corn and a glass of soda feeling like you got your money's worth,",RGlVNOfVAzICfCaQT9fpgQ,1,0,1,hkrFPUBr-SZ4nDhvpp6WrQ

Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is our standard, so we've been trying to find a broth as flavorful, and with meat as great as theirs. The Red Pot comes the closest in regards to the broth. The restaurant is gorgeous, modern, well-ventilated, and clean.

What Red Pot has an edge over Little Sheep is their hugeeee variety of seafood, veggies, noodles, soups, and sauces! I usually go for the meats at a hot pot place, and Red Pot lacks in different cuts of meat. I guess what they lack for in meat, they make up for in other food choices. I think they only had 3 choices of meat. The meat does not taste as high quality as Little Sheep, but it still tastes great with the broth nonetheless. 

The sauce bar is huge! The sauce bar is actually back to back. My go-to sauce is always the satay sauce with cilantro but it kind of lacked flavor. The herbal soup is good, but it was a little too mild in flavor to make it great. They also have tea eggs YUMMM!!! I also loaded up on the quail eggs too. The husband loaded up on the seafood section. 

Our waitress was great. We never went empty with our waters, and our dishes were always cleared off the table. We also had our broth refilled when she saw it getting low.

The Red Pot is the most authentic-tasting hot pot you will probably find in Vegas in comparison to others. It's $35 a person, but with the 20% off, it brings you to $28. Try it at least once!",ycaTwX_sMuuryxsuITB-GA,0,0,3,xZMiEU38pnr1cGW2k2LaJQ

However, upon inspecting all the foods closely, I noticed a huge problem. The only foods that were labeled were the meats! None of the vegetables had labels, nor did any of the seafood. The selection of meats were very limited, and I had to guess which fish balls I was getting because none of them were labeled. Secondly, I had ordered a spicy soup base, and the only thing spicy about it was a bit of spicy oil that was in the soup! Lastly, but the biggest problem, is that I got food poisoning from eating here. I talked to some of my friends, and at least three other groups of people that ate here got diarrhea.

Service: my only issue was with the service was that we asked for water and it took quiet a while to get it. And when we asked our server for it, he only gave us ONE WATER. Am I supposed to share this with my boyfriend? Plus we were never checked on. The only up side, they took our dirty plate away. But we never got refills on our water. 

Food: VERY mediocre. The soup lacked flavor and was very bland. Not much meat choices but their seafood choices are a lot.",M4tyqwsqBRXKAasRrFAD7w,2,0,2,d97-cv5bip4jfoewXekOkg

You can pretty much pick any type of broth as your base and go pick any type of seafood, type of meat, type of vegetables, type of noodles. Anything you name it you pretty much can find it The location is near Maryland near UNLV. The reason I gave this place at 3-star is because the food is not as fresh as I thought it could be. The service is slow so pretty much it's like a self serve and the only positive thing there is just a lot of food but not as much quality as I was expecting.

Incredible comforting Mongolian herbal broth made a wonderful savory base for our lamb, beef, crab legs, rice cakes, udon and ramen noodles, a slew of mushroom varieties, greens, and fun fish balls and dumplings. 

So much variety to choose from and no wait since you get to ""shop"" the food yourself.  This was a true hole-in-the-wall gem and I am so glad a friend recommended it to me. Will be my go-to place next time I am looking for ""Vegas buffet"" that won't make me feel gross afterwards.  Really healthy way to get your fill!

Make sure you check the hours before you come in because they are closed between 3-5 as they switch from lunch to dinner.

My only minor complaint is there is no default signature sauce and as someone who doesn't know how to cook it was really hard to figure out the right combination. Maybe instructions or a container with a signature sauce would help!",MLtqthEQFmoYTgRq11VPvg,1,1,5,T5RKvHaHmN_XCE-V2jhVsw

The food options were ok. They had a range of vegetables and a small selection of meats. They also had a small section with sauces and spices. Their dessert area is very limited with just about 2 options and some canned fruit.

I love that you can grab all your sauces, meats and veggies all yourself. We ordered the Tom yum broth and Mongolian herbal. I wish the Tom yum had more flavor and the Mongolian herbal had a bitter taste that I was not a fan. When she added more broth to our pot the bitterness went away, but there was still a slight tint in it. The meats were frozen, so when we tried cooking them in the broth it just didn't taste right. Although, after I let the pork thaw out more it tasted a lot better. If you take a look in my attached photo you'll see the yellow and white swirly roe ball. I highly recommend that as well as the yellow thing next to it which has cheese inside. A lot of their meatballs have filling inside and I wasn't a fan of the brown one that is with the pink ones. It was very gross. I always love getting fish at hot pot and theirs was very good. My friend and I had to spit it out. Our server barely checked up on us.

This place has a good idea. And it would be awesome, if there were more options for people who don't necessarily want beef or seafood. They do have chicken, but I was advised that it is only on certain days.

We ordered the spicy Mongolian broth on one side, and the Tom Kha on the other. Neither was spicy, or had any flavor really. The Tom Kha didn't have the Limey-Coconutty flavor that I love. We used several things in our broth; quail eggs, shrimp, squid, vegetables. Unfortunately, none of the items added good flavor to the broth, or were provided any flavor by the broth.

On the plus side the service was great and the staff were attentive! I would definitely try this place again, but only if they get their broth-game on point.",ShPNNs-sbMvrjTT0BuPvcA,0,0,3,c931O90b1TPrJEBF3D0S8g
5679754,2017-04-23,0,9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw,I love this place. I have been here a dozen times.  The all you can eat seafood is amazing. I grab trays of their crab legs and feast on that. They have very traditional Taiwanese/Chinese vegetables and a huge variety of seafood/meats. The broths are extremely flavorful. The restaurant is very clean.  Unlike some hot places that have a horrible stench--this one does not. I love making my own sauce. This is a great place to eat.

5690476,2017-03-24,3,9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw,"I came here for dinner a week ago and for the price of 35 it wasn't bad you got two different kinds of crab, two different kinds of clams, alaskan crab legs, crawfish , shrimp, frog legs , salmon, tilapia and baby octopus, squid.  You also get a nice selection of veggies.  Dessert you had a choice of different fruits.  The service is horrendous now i see why they automatically charge 18percent for gratuity for parties of 6 or more you wouldn't tip them that much.  Fast forward to today and we went for lunch.  NO crabs of any kind, No fish, No crawfish, No clams, No frog legs.  The only thing they had was shrimp, baby octopus, imitation crab even then they wouldn't bring out more even though there was only 5 little pieces left.  Little bit of fish balls.  The waiter who was so bad that when we ordered 3 drinks he would only bring out 1 had to be told that there was more than 1.  When told need more soup for the pot he was to ignorant to understand to bring out more the girl had to tell him.  And the kicker for me is he kept on telling me that they were going to charge 18 percent for gratuity how many times do you need to remind me. So for the price of 22 it's definitely not worth it and to be charge for gratuity when there is no customer service isn't right.  Ownership should stop charging the guest for gratuity when your employees don't do anything to deserve it.  So if you don't mind automatically tipping for non service then it's not a bad place to go for dinner stay away for lunch and if you get the boy server ask for a different server.",2-01LlVLrCujcL1kT2Xchw,0,0,1,Hwth2TTujaru1-9QUaXsHg

Fans of hotpot will be at home as they will be able to take advantage of the extensive selection of foods to cook. Might be good to have someone who knows of hotpot otherwise, as people who aren't accustomed to hotpot can be overwhelmed. Really good atmosphere to the location. While sometimes there can be a few mishaps on presentations and there may be a few waiters on staff, my experience with the location is pretty responsive service.",4LHNxFSdWZG_fXpm_V4yEA,2,1,4,6bZ5xZSrdxVRazXPehTPXw

How pleasantly surprised I was to be able to experience such an interactive dinner and casual but elegant ambiance. Simply amazing.

My dearest most wonderful friend invited me to dinner on Sunday night July 9, 2016. He had told me about the restaurant and said I would love it. And, yes I sure did.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the warm hostess and seated right away. We arrived around 8pm, and it wasn't too busy. The decor is elegant yet simple. Almost a little to perfect, like out of a magazine. So pretty and romantic.

The soup bowl for two, was huge!  I had no idea just how big this soup bowl actually was!

There were many flavors to choose from for your base broth, I chose the spicy yellow curry and he had the standard non spicy white broth.
The selection of seafood, meat, tofu, veggies and sauces seemed endless.
I love shell fish, so I had a combination of snow crab, blue crab, stone crab, prawns and craw-fish for my soup. And he had a combination of meat, chicken and shellfish for his side of the soup.

All I can say is that I was in 'Heaven'
Love Love Love it all!

Dinner took about 2.5 hours, as cracking and shelling the crab took quite a bit of time. That's why i say it is an 'experience' rather than just a dinner being set in front of you.

The staff is very attentive and quite quiet as they refill your drinks and add more soup to your bowl. Very enjoyable to be able to play a little with your food and enjoy all the different flavors happening in your bowl and mouth. 

Its ALL YOU CAN EAT! No doggy bags though, Be sure to check in and receive 20% off your bill. There's even a sign in the front window that says they LOVE YELP! Great way to welcome your guests.

I believe the bill was around 56.00 for two people. Worth every minute. Be sure to go with someone that you enjoy being with and can laugh with, cause it does and can get a bit messy. I'm very grateful to have been able to enjoy such a pleasant and delicious meal with my favorite person!

I must say it was quite an experience.  We picked 2 types of soups and it was served in a ying-yang metal bowl.  The 2 soups are Mongolia Herb and Seaweed.  While the soups were boiling away, there were lots of fridges/freezers to ""shop"" for your hot pot items like fish balls, cuttle fish balls, pork balls, all kinds of different seafood balls, frog legs, fish fillets, shrimp, tofu, all kinds of vegetables, all kinds of mushrooms, noodles of all kinds,  beef, lamb, chicken and pork.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the sauce bar where you can mix up whatever sauce you want.  There's also seaweed salad (like the Japanese kind) in the fridge that you can eat as an appy. 

Make sure you have some soup after boiling all your items as all the flavours go into the soup.   Most delicious.  Also, rice is included if you some.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,0,0,4,10uf9Hqlk-uE0iWZPhQcug

For the money, it should be a lot better.... this is not up to par with the typical all you can eat hotpot you find in LA. Skip it... or you are better off going somewhere else. Also their site says they are open late, but we went on friday night and they were closed already.... came back the next day because I was craving hot pot bad and we ate a few bites and left.... it was just not fresh and I did not want to sit there and force myself to eat.

This place is near the UNLV college.. the location seems okay.. but when we got there.. the parking lot was plentiful.. barely any cars there.. i was starting to think they were closed early.. but when i checked it was open. Just not many customers in there. I believe we got there an hour and half before they closed. 

So the place is huge with many seatings! 
everything is kinda self serve.. except you have a waiter that comes by with the big hot pot.. and providing water and such. He was hardly around and I literally had to get up from my table several times to find him to ask for things I needed like extra napkins and such. 
Anyways... the place has 2 isles of open food! one isle full of meats and seafoods.. the other isle full of veggies, tofu, noodles etc. the selections were so many options!!! so awesome to see. you basically pick out what kind of things you wanted on a plate and bring it back to your table. Oh yeah theres a condiment bar as well... but not too much choices for sauces. 

Overall I would say for under $30 all you can eat hot pot is not bad... but you tend to eat so much that your belly feels super full! its great for big eaters !! but when you're little like me.. i can't eat too much and get full fast. I try not to do hot pot so much except during cold seasons. the price plus tip sets you off about $35 or so...",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,0,1,3,ETZHA_72dzWel9XAWgSREQ

Since it was the holiday season, we paid $35/person during lunch for dinner selections.

Great selection of seafood, well-portioned meats and a huge variety of vegetables were at our disposal. My only issue was that a few of the seafood options didn't look as fresh and the meats were a tad bit too frozen. Thongs were missing, etc. Not bad, but not perfect. Great broth options and a lot of sauces too.

What the heck - they even had instant ramen? Crazy.

I don't know how new this place was, but the facility was super clean and immaculate.
