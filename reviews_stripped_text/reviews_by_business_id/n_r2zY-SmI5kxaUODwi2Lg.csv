It's a bar, so yeah.

The burger I got was pretty good, but there was something strange about the way it tasted. Can't quite put my finger on it, but I think it was something in the buns they used. I may have to go back to try again with a different type of bun (if possible) to see if that alleviates the issue.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,0,0,3,cyED45XEuQbe2my7LdYwFQ

Also gone was most of the appetizers, and only a minimal menu. Gone was the lobster quesedillas, and the lobster potato skins.  The waitress let us know that they were trying to revamp the place and cutting back to focus more on the regulars. The other location (blue diamond) still has some of the menu, and still has happy hour, so I'll check them out instead.

The place still has nice wait staff, and nice regulars. But I'm disappointed, and won't be back to this location.",7O46UnK4oysvRA0oopZqDQ,2,0,2,Eo_JfbARcCeAIA8XHl7DyA
471221,2009-06-24,0,n_r2zY-SmI5kxaUODwi2Lg,"Simply put - I love this place.  It's one of the few true neighborhood bars in Las Vegas (almost all the customers live in Mountain's Edge), and the bartenders and servers are some of the nicest I've ever met (my first time there, the bartender greeted me with ""Welcome Home"" and has called me by name ever since.)

The food is a tiny step up from your ""standard"" pub food, with slightly more diverse options, although some of the dishes are absolutely superb (I can't have enough of the Crispy Ranch Salad).

But what I like most about it, is that it's not your ""standard"" Vegas-style pub where nobody knows each other and puts their head down for the night playing video poker - everyone is talking to the bartenders, dancing to the music, playing darts or Golden Tee and generally having a great time.  As much as I hate to say it, it's a place where ""everybody knows your name.""",dN3b9g8axT5BnQAp4u-rhA,0,0,5,5dw1Sa-n8SIG9Q56aCirRQ

Green chile verde has a nice kick, but the pork belly tacos- meat didnt seem like pork belly but just marinated pork. Spinach artichoke dip was good, just need fresher tasting chips.

We have been going in every weekend for the past 6 months for breakfast. Unfortunately, they have a very, very limited menu. You have three choices....eggs, eggs, and more eggs. No pancakes, no French toast, waffles. We have pleaded with Crystal to inform the owner to change the menu. The other location has extensive menu in Henderson....I guess they cater to zip codes.

2497472,2011-09-21,0,n_r2zY-SmI5kxaUODwi2Lg,"I stopped in here after trivia at the Freaking Frog to take advantage of their $50 birthday match play. This is a great birthday promotion. You just put $50 in the video poker machine and rounders will match it. Once you run through the $100 whatever is left is yours to keep. I cashed out for $80, got to drink for free while I played and made a $30 profit. Pretty good deal and even if you're not a gambler the rounder's pints are only $2.

The kitchen closes at 9 so we were too late to eat but I have had lunch here before and they serve a pretty good turkey burger with chipotle mayo. It comes on a pretzel bun that I absolutely love. 

Craig was our bartender and he was very personable and kept the beers flowing. I told him I was going to give him a good review on yelp and he said ""What's that?"" :) Despite that minor glitch, he was awesome. The only reason I didn't give Rounders more stars was the smoking. I hate it. Always have always will. It wasn't bad while we were there. It was Monday night and they were pretty slow but I imagine it can get nasty when this place is busy.",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,2,0,3,go1OjpLh_tt7J8CmRRx8JA

We went to watch Thursday Night Football and they had great happy hour specials with $2 beers and half off a decent list of items including chicken wings, tri tip quesadilla and lobster quesadilla, chicken bbq pizza, tx chili, and many more items.  The lobster quesadilla was quite decent while the chili was awful but take this from a chili snob from TX.

The tv setup is not as good but if i lived in the area i may frequent b/c of proximity.

It's a decent spot.  I probably won't be back but if you go during happy hour they have decent deals.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,2,1,3,hPcRMLyiIbFoy1aDbDCeqA

   We stopped by for martini specials. They have a huge sign $5 martinis, $2 draft beers. Service was good. Food was good as well. Drinks ok. We ordered from the martinis special list and two draft beers. As we were ready to pay and check was not as we thought it was going to be. Martinis $7.50 and $5.00 beers, WTF??? I asked the bartender why are martinis $7.50, he says because ""specialty"" martinis are not included on the special. But, they were made with 3 olives, which was the happy hour vodka special.  WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME THAT BEFORE? I am not cheap, but i hate when businesses try to take advantage of people. I guess my 40% tip on food wasn't good enough!!!

5373068,2012-06-01,0,n_r2zY-SmI5kxaUODwi2Lg,"Sound the alarms: HAPPY HOUR ALERT! Not all Rounders are created equal because this location does not believe in the regular 2-3 hour special. Instead they run a 2pm-2am happy hour with $2 Rounders' draft, $3 well drinks, $4 wines, $5 Three Olives martinis, and half off food. 

A couple of friends and I had just finished playing tennis and was looking for a place that did reverse happy hour. When we called to see if they had one, the woman who picked up the phone sounded really confused and didn't know what that was. If I had to work at a place that had happy hour for half the day, I would be confused too. 

We ended up getting the sliders trio; a combination of a pulled pork, beef in a green chili sauce, and a buffalo chicken mini sandwich. All three was good, but sliders are sliders. The seared ahi stackers with the Asian slaw was amazing for a bar. The chili con queso was a soup. It lacked the consistency of a dip, but as it cooled down it got thicker. The lobster quesadilla is no joke. The folded cheese tortilla was stuffed full of luscious lobster meat. Smear some guacamole and spoon on that pico and I went to town. This is one of the best bar experiences I have experienced. Three drinks and four appetizers between three people came out to $32 before tip. That is a steal and their serving size is no joke either. This will not be a late night spot because I already see the aftermath. At least I know I will not have to rush here to catch the tail end of a happy hour.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,1,5,PYeLguQ-XdFdrLM-P1UKYA

5893052,2017-03-17,1,n_r2zY-SmI5kxaUODwi2Lg,"This poker bar has potential to be a fun hangout spot, but a few roadblocks are in place. I went on a Thursday evening to meet a few friends and redeem a text club promo for $40 play to bring a new slot club member. The location is not ideal, with what appears to be a vacant office building behind the building where Rounders is. There was a person sleeping in the alcove close to the Rounders entrance, and I was curious to see what was going on behind the building, but thought better of it. Getting into the complex from Buffalo is a pain too, although there's another entrance from Peace. Their sign is pretty cool- it changes colors. 

There were a few customers at the bar when I arrived, and other than our party of 3, it wasn't busy while we were there.  A few more people came in as we were about to leave. I couldn't miss the (multiple) security monitors in full sight of my seat at the bar. Not sure what to make of that! The food is better than decent, and the chicken fingers and fries I tasted were excellent. My friend had chicken sliders and said they were also pretty good. This is annoying- they have different people dealing with food orders and beverage orders. When only 2 customers in the entire place are eating, I don't get it. I didn't order food, and probably wouldn't have if I was hungry but had to deal with that! 

For you gaming enthusiasts, their comp policy is available right at the bar! I was intrigued, to say the least. Surprisingly, it doesn't state that one drink per $20 will be comped, as is the norm at many poker bars. It does state that continuous play is required for comped drinks. Fair enough! I posted a pic of the policy with my review. I took advantage of the card of the day promo for hitting a 4 of a kind in 10s, and received $10 to use instantly in my account. Another wacky thing here is the freestanding poker machines. They have about 6 of them and I didn't play those but am a fan of having that option! 
All in all, I walked out a winner, as did both my friends, so that part of the visit was a success!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,1,3,RLxfvQi0Uqsm6blWiu1RuQ
