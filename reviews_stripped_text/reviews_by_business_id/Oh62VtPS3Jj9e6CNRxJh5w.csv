66108,2013-08-25,0,Oh62VtPS3Jj9e6CNRxJh5w,"My friends and I, 8 people in total, went to Banana Leaf since we were already in the Riviera.  Big, big mistake.  I have never experienced such terrible service, a sentiment that was shared by everyone in our group.

Where to begin...

We were seated right away, which wasn't much of an accomplishment considering we were the only ones there.  Nearly 15 minutes after we had sat down someone finally noticed us flagging them down and we got our orders in.  15 minutes later 1 of the 2 guys in our group got the soup they had ordered as an appetizer (the 2nd person never got his), but due to an odd choice of ingredients and a complete lack of flavor he couldn't eat it.  We told them what was wrong and their solution was to bring another order, scooped out of the same pot.  Brilliant!

Eventually, 45 minutes after sitting down, the first person in our group got their meal.  At that point we were all starving and thirsty (requested drink refills never came) so we were glad food was finally showing up.  Nope...again we were disappointed.  Our food came out over a span of 30 minutes, one plate at a time, usually passed to someone over someone else.  One guy had a plate of plain rice in front of him for nearly 10 minutes while he waited on his curry chicken.  Another guy had to wait over 10 minutes for all his side-dishes to arrive, including a plate of steamed veggies which ended up being just steamed lettuce.  He complained about that and eventually was given a plate of cold broccoli.  Two orders vaguely resembled what the menu described, but only barely.  

The worst offenders were the caesar salad and the orange chicken.  The ceasar salad took over an hour to come out (it was the last item) and was literally a plate of plain lettuce with cold bits of chicken on top.  Later on they brought out a small cup of ranch dressing.  When we told them that that was NOT a ceasar salad we were told they were out of all the other ingredients that come with it so lettuce and chicken was all they could give us.  Wonderful!  As for the orange chicken?  The poor guy that ordered that was in and out of the restroom the rest of the night.

I mentioned we complained about our food as it was coming, something we don't normally do, but in the end the service and food was so terrible we had to speak to the manager.  No apology ever came, but we got a ton of excuses.  ""We cook tickets one at a time, even for a group"", ""We have a huge backlog of take out orders"", ""We have a new cook"", etc.

Obviously very unhappy being at work! We were still hungry when we left. Would have ordered something else but I think she would have been really upset!

I stood by the podium waiting for someone to seat me, which I realized after a good 5 minutes wasn't going to happen. I got the bartenders attention and asked if I should seat myself, to which she replied that she would seat me. 

After being seated and looking at the menu, I wasn't impressed. Prices were somewhat high for what was being offered. I went with a classic steak and eggs, listed at 13.99, and ordered with the waiter who did seem prompt and attentive. 

The steak was grizzly, the eggs seemed ""watery"", the potatoes were good, sure do wish it came with some toast or something to soak up the egg yoke though. 

Here's where things got interesting/frustrating/irritating. I got my check when I was finished. Realizing I left my room without my wallet, being in a hurry so housekeeping could do ""their thing"", I figured not a big deal, I'll bill it to my room. WOW, was I mistaken!

I told the waiter to bill it to the room, he told me they can't, the system is down. He went to get a woman whom I assume is the manager, I told her I'd like to bill it to my room, she responded ""absolutely!"", then back tracked saying also the system was down. I told her my money is in the room, can she just bill it to the room after the system goes back up, she replied NO!

luckily another patron heard what was going on and stepped in, covering me so I could get back up to the room. I have never in my life been so embarrassed and felt so humiliated!

I will never return to this place and would not recommend it to even the homeless people along the strip! They need to seriously work on their customer service!",fe5IomPoEZpO02NGTyD-GQ,1,0,1,Ydazm4X_H1ZtQAFGVSwx3g
184432,2013-03-29,0,Oh62VtPS3Jj9e6CNRxJh5w,"Located deep, deeeep inside the Riviera. I met someone for lunch on a Wednesday around noon. The joint was the perfect amount of busy, but the restaurant was out of a few items I was interested in (I was looking forward to the cold spring rolls and a coffee--? breakfast for me--it happens, but running out of an item at noon when you open at 11 is rough!). Banana Leaf has a pretty far-ranging menu that had the potential to be a disaster:  Asian fusion, Malaysian, Thai, .... right next to American Diner breakfast foods like eggs and hash browns and a big old hamburger on their menu cover. Lol. I am charmed.

However, they did a great job with everything I ate! very well done. I ended up getting an amazing BLT (it is hard for a BLT to be amazing) and fries and a thousand cups of coffee. This food sounds better to me than to you because I was on true Vegas time and had been awake and working since 2am and hadn't eaten or had coffee until noon. And the lunch was also a job interview, so no pressure there! The waiter was kind enough to back off and silently refill coffees so we could get on with our talk about  Princess Culture, the 1990s, Sassy magazine, and rhetorical theory. So my perceptions may have been a bit skewed. Whatever; I would go back!

I think this place attests to the dynamics of Vegas by having a somewhat crazy menu available all the time for their guests, good, fast service, and low prices. I ate for around $11 + a $3 tip. That can't be beat. If I had had my cold spring rolls on top of my sandwich and coffee, it would have been more stars.",grWJaTRJuLk-ZFvX2iHU0w,7,2,3,ksGIsX-YcPvIytefgfnMKQ

The Shrimp and Lobster sauce dish was Horrible it had several nice sized shrimp with almost raw carrots (yes raw) and a ton of barely blanched Green Peppers in a mountain of unappealing lobster sauce. the seafood dish was similar, except the squid was so tough it was difficult to cut with the knife provided - an Axe would have been my choice. A small dish of sticky rice was provided to be shared for both dishes. Drinks were not refilled. I just needed to get out of there and get a real meal.

Then when it came to ordering they weren't serving sushi, I get that it was one o clock, I understand the sushi chef may only come in at night. I settled for a Cobb salad, and a buddy had the all American burger. His came out after twenty minutes, my salad came out twenty minutes after. I asked for Italian dressing, they said they were out. I asked for red wine vinegar, they were out.  After finally getting the salad there was no tomatoes on it, I asked for some, they said they were out, yet my buddy had some on his burger.

1736491,2012-09-03,0,Oh62VtPS3Jj9e6CNRxJh5w,"It's a standard Chinese food restaurant with extra effort for sit down window dressing.

The food was okay.  As a choice between this and the food court, we tried to step it up thought we couldn't leave the Riviera.

Long story short.  Attended the ""resort"" for a conference, visiting the Banana Leaf twice.

First time - we didn't eat dinner because we (a long with several other tables) gave up waiting for service.  We asked where best to sit, changed tables, and checked in with the server but we hadn't received menu or water after 30 minutes (can you tell we were desperate?).

2nd time - Giving them the benefit of the doubt of having a bad night (last minute call out or something, we try this again for breakfast). We were seated with menus (significantly more progress than last time). However, the length of time between seating, drink order, drinks, food, bill, etc. was ridiculous. It's breakfast! The order was off the 1 page breakfast menu and the restaurant wasn't even half full. Where is everybody? We were trying to pay anyone at one point because we had to go.

Considering I was part of a 2 week long conference that took over the hotel. Staffing needs should've been no surprise. Negative word got out quickly.  Throughout my travels passing by, the spot remained pretty empty for the remainder of our stay.

In case of emergency, go to the strip or grab some food court to go and find a seat amongst the slots for a free drink.

1-the breakfast -ham, bacon, toast and potatoes were good, especially the potatoes. They are not oily/greasy and they have nice crunch.

OK, so, this isn't some fancy hip cool kind of place.  Just like the old Riv, the restaurant looks like it has seen better days.  But thank goodness, no roaches showed up uninvited ad the other Yelper had.

Well, service was adequate, kind of friendly in a clunky non-assuming way, just decent regular diner kind of service.

But the food, believe it or not was really very good and seemed to us quite authentic.  Too often what we find is Chinese that is too greasy or just unappetizing, but this food reminded us of the really, really good Chinese cafe's in Vancouver, BC, where the Chinese food is really good..

We had lots of stuff and lots of things that were quite good, hot and tasty.  I am sure glad I didn't have the others experiences, but over all we were very pleased and wouldn't hesitate to return.  Now, if I'd found a roach, yuck, there is no way I'd return, but I thankfully didn't and I can give a thumbs up to the Banana Leaf for good Chinese diner kind of food.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,8,0,3,qSl-YYO1Ug2tD8D_9AaNWw

Checking the reviews online here were all on their bad customer service and not so pleasing food. Only part correct about that review was possibly the slow customer service. Upon sitting down, it took the waitress close to 20-30 mins before she took my order and drinks. No water was served before that mind you. Food took maybe 5-10 mins to come out. And the waitress was not prompt on refilling my soda I had ordered. The food was cooked to perfection and the portions were good.

I did my usual check in with yelp when we got to the restaurant, and to my surprise I got a check in offer! Free order of spring rolls with a purchase of an entree. Perfect! So I show our waiter and he said that the last time he asked the manager about this offer she refused to honor it. When businesses decide to do check in offers you would think they would be excited to honor it knowing that this is a review website. All managers and staff should be knowledgeable about any and all offers that their guest bring to the table. 
The next point I want to make is that we ordered steak medium well and it came out well done. Last but not least I want to mention that the price is too expensive for the poor quality of food you get. I would have enjoyed going to Denny's more.",Wx7P56_1Xl-BdKMBMkC0lA,0,0,2,DwYdAEjW1D4jP8Qwqp3Crg

Lav Azza coffee from Italy. $3.19 plus tax for a small 16oz cup. The coffee was nice and strong, the way I like most things in my life. Creamer and sweetners were offered to the side for personal taste. They also offered Italian sweetners to add to custom drinks.

4 Stars for the coffee only. I didnt eat anything, exept an almond cookie, but their pasteries looked good. But all I need is just my coffee to start my day off right.

5224385,2012-06-26,1,Oh62VtPS3Jj9e6CNRxJh5w,"If I could give this god-forsaken place a half a star, I would. But, alas, I don't want to ruin its self-esteem.

Now, I am not the kind of guy who eats somewhere once and automatically writes a review. I understand restaurants have good and bad days, and so I like to eat at a place at least twice. I ate here three times, and so my verdict is fair. 

My first time eating there was at around 4 a.m. - and although the wait staff was extraordinary gracious - I think Monica served me - the food left little to be desired. I ordered the chicken and rice - and a half a chicken came out about ten minutes later with some weird sauces. Now, I grew up in an Asian family. If I don't know what the sauce is, it is probably no good ... and it wasn't. The chicken was bony and made me just want to pick up the individual pieces and just chomp down, but there were some beautiful women sitting at the table next to me, so I controlled myself. 

Verdict: (out of 10) food 2, service 8

My second time there was for breakfast a few days later. I was late for a poker tournament but decided I needed something in my stomach  - you know, discipline and all. To be quick, I ordered the balls of shrimp and a nice little wonton soup. Ten minutes - nothing, Let's give it another five minutes - good food takes time. As I sat there, twiddling my thumb, wondering how the poker tournament is getting along, nothing came. Nearly half an hour passed before the food arrived - along with water that tasted like - forgive me, piss. 

The manager came out to apologize, saying they had to boil water. What the hell? How does it take half an hour to boil water in a restaurant? So, I wolfed down my meal and left. 

As for the food, by that point, I didn't care. But just one sentence: bland and boring. 

Verdict: food 2, service 2.

Third time's a charm, right? Nope! Not here. Drunk on one of my last nights in Vegas, I decided to give this place another try. This time, I ordered the Pho - it's a Vietnamese noddle soup that often comes with various cuts of beef - but what do you know, here, it only had beef balls in it. The soup was bland and the meatballs were chewy - and on top of it all, no condiments. What the hell kind of restaurants are these people running?

As for the wait staff - while I did have one nice experience with Monica (in the restaurant only!), the rest of the time, it was crap. The woman who took my order was slow - intellectually that is, and couldn't tell me which was which on the menu. Don't get me wrong - I have a lot of empathy and understanding for wait staffs - I understand they work long hours and do not get properly compensated, but Jesus Christ, can a paying customer get some goddamn competence?

Lastly, the waiter, who was different than the woman who took my order, for some odd reason, kept on calling me ""man."" It's, like, ""dude, I am a paying customer. We're not pals. I don't expect 'sir,' but I certainly don't want to be called, 'man,' either."" 

Verdict: food 2, service 2.

My point: you're in Vegas, if you're going to spend money, go elsewhere. If this place can't do better to earn your business, you've got other choices. Walk down to the Wynn and go to Red 8. More professional staffs and most certainly better food.",gocMs2a7VKculVGTwpay1A,1,1,1,ysKBkNKBgYiRLF51SI9DTA
