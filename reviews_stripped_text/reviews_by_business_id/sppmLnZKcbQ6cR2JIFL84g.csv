2299465,2018-05-20,0,sppmLnZKcbQ6cR2JIFL84g,"Pretty bad food in general. It feels like they didn't even TRY to cook chinese food.

Drunk and tired, wanted to get something to fill the stomach. Went here because it beat Johnny Rockets.

We ordered two plates, of two entree meals. Each meal was about $12 for a small plate of food. 

One plate was fried rice (bits of egg, brown rice, Lima beans), veggies (squash, baby corn, broccoli, carrots) and sweet and sour pork (deep fried pork bits with onions and peppers stir fried). The food was all flavorless, the fried rice was dry, the pork was sweet but Lots of batter, and the portions were small. 

Second plate was chow mein noodles (bland noodles with, celery) orange chicken (lots of breading but sweetness was good) and ginger chicken and mushroom ( not enough flavor and minced/shredded chicken). Not much food and very bland. 

I get they're trying to make back their money they probably invested initially... But at least TRY to make your food decent... Even compared to panda express it was bad... And I very much dislike P. E.",gwMG6Cv7K_Dq-7lJW5l1bQ,1,0,1,SYNEven-86Sa5ldWXisxgw

2797482,2015-06-09,11,sppmLnZKcbQ6cR2JIFL84g,"NO. Just NO. They dont even deserve 1 star.

Located in the food court inside Mandalay Bay, I went here for lunch on a tuesday after going to Shark Reef in the morning. There was a convention so the food court was packed. All the food stands had long lines while Pan Asian Express only had a couple people in it. I didnt want to wait so Chinese food it was. 

I got the 2 entree meal which came with a side. I got Orange Chicken and Sweet n Sour Pork.  The side was the fried rice.

Oh man. Where do I start. I guess there was a reason why there were only two people in line. This place sucks! The Orange Chicken tasted more like pink chicken meaning that I dont think it was cooked all the way. The tempura breading was a bit thick. Maybe thats why it didnt cook all the way. The Sweet n Sour Pork tasted more like chicken than pork. Again it had a thicker than normal tempura batter and the meat inside was tiny. The Fried Rice was way too salty. I think they put too much soy sauce or something. 

I ended up eating only a quarter of my food and just threw the rest away. I didnt even want to bother with returning it and getting a refund although I should have. Total I paid was 12 bucks and change which included a soda with no refill. The soda was the only thing that allowed me to wash down any traces of horrible crap that I ate. As im doing this review, im happy to report that I didnt get food poisioning. I wouldnt be surprised if my fortune cookie said ""That was not chicken"".

Service was decent. I got my food and paid. The lady that attended to me was nice. Its just that the food was atrocious. I hope these guys are not affiliated with the actual Pan Asian restaurant located off of Durango Dr in the Lakes area.

In closing, DO NOT EAT HERE! If you are going to pay for overpriced food, go to any of the other food stands. Im sure pizza, subs, and burgers will taste way better at those venues.

Thank goodness I was sober enough to realize so I could spit out the gross pink goo before I swallowed. I've been vegetarian for over 10 years. It was horrible!!! Even if I ate meat it I wouldn't recommend whatever was inside that thing- it was gooey, pink and unrecognizable. Totally gross.",b2iqRI9wvAzwejRS-g0Qsg,0,0,1,9qncZqhvBIBDaDc7h3_0xA

3449266,2017-01-09,1,sppmLnZKcbQ6cR2JIFL84g,"1 item veggie with steamed rice, $9.98 before tax. Wasn't sure if the dude was trying to rip me off. Price didn't match what was posted on the menu board. 

Too tired to argue. Broccoli was rancid. Was yellow and tasted bitter. The canned veggies which were a part of the mix, the baby corn, chestnuts, and bamboo were edible. Rice had too much water. Ate some threw out the rest. Consistent with the other reviews. Not all the orders are completely edible. Very greasy. Too much oil. They don't have enough training or consistency in the cooking process to manage this. 

Food quality not consistent. Americanized Chinese food. There isn't constant supervision here from somebody who cares or has good enough English to run the operation consistently. Some orders are good, some are inedible. Crap shoot if you have a good experience or not. Matches the overall management quality of the other restaurants in Ballys. They pay low and manage the expenses from there with accountants.",J9AINj-EMP8lOdZlIzCBEg,1,1,1,8OYnx2wNIa_qA8qrkaaZYw

Our meals were way better than we expected, my chicken was all good (no chewy pieces) fresh and the orange flavor was really good, the rice was also good. My friend really liked her meal as well.  We also had a coupon and USED it. and the lady who waited on us was very nice. 

Im not sure what other people are complaining about?? Especially the price, it says it RIGHT there in FRONT of you BEFORE you order! LOL - like they are getting a surprise, yes if you order A LOT its going to cost A LOT!!!   Its VEGAS! and HELLO they give you coupons EVERY time you eat in the food court right ON the trays! they are Buy One get the other 1/2 OFF. - USE THEM. really not sure why folks are thinking they are getting GOURMET Asian food, in a FOOD COURT, in LAS VEGAS???   WTF back at y'all. 

Glad I didn't read the reviews before we ate here, it was one of the better things we ate, and the complainers would have turned me off.
