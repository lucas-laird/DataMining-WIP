1234497,2018-03-05,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,Had a veg thali for lunch and it was quick and delicious. The location was very close to our room at the Aria. Service was also nice with the two gentlemen at the counter who were friendly. I'll have to come back and try more,PHlseUVBOH7jN7ufyhHybg,0,0,5,fXGxULXgqx2puHrf_UnZFA
1400498,2018-04-24,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,Not the best Indian food but ok for Vegas Strip. They don't serve Naan instead give 2 Kulcha. Entrees are too buttery and less tasteful because of min use of Spice.,XOD3GGxDbXTOuM4HnfVBMA,0,0,3,lyl9ahQEvPf7HhiNUZObEg
2153063,2018-04-02,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,"Note that I am vegetarian and didn't have any of the chicken dishes. I got the veggie Thali. 
Pros: fast, lost of seating and of course the central location. Not many healthy quick options on the strip.
Cons: pretty over priced and the food is just ok. A bit tasteless. Also not many vegan options.
Conclusion: meh.",ForRKi6DtJByVKXKQJnPtA,2,2,3,Evp_NRp2sNu0kv6r-TxUfQ
2367700,2018-06-05,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,"The is located right at the strip and very accessible. It provides a nice shade, a much needed respite from the Vegas heat. There is a pizza shop too inside the same cover.
I tired the Samosa chat and mango lassi for a quick snack. The lassi tasted good but felt a little watery, nonetheless, was happy to find it in Vegas strip. The samosa chaat was good and spicy but felt like couple of spoonfuls less for the price.
They have thalis and other quick bites too. If you are in the area, give it a try if you are looking for some Indian bites.",uGVNNa8gmniGY7WkhT3lcA,0,0,3,mrlni-H8WqBrzObcC-Rz2Q
2992138,2018-06-03,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,Food took more than half an hour to be ready. Plus the naan doesn't look like it. I'm not Indian but I know little about indian food. If you are so hungry dont come here expecting that food will be ready.,v3wd4Lsw4ZQ49LT7YlRcQQ,0,0,1,XqiMRr6tfwrRo-wiLFlNVg

I never i expected to find such phenomenal, flavorful Indian food on the strip. Honestly, the pictures don't do this place justice. You need to try their food as soon as possible! It'll more than satisfy your Indian food craving! I'll definitely be back when I'm back in Vegas! I miss the chicken tikka Masala!",fJIH83RIJY0DGmb_vOYAHA,1,1,5,aV_QuEEn8QiymBiTmfB1sg

Even though the restaurant is new the staff's service was stellar. They were quick and on point and the food was piping hot, as it should be. Every time I visit Vegas, I'll definitely hit this gem up.",nw-3o8U7kXt1GxxrjntNZA,1,1,5,IVhKuhWaV-NSSoCdHlDgtw
4499822,2018-03-18,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,"I am so impressed! I didn't actually get to see the interior, but my friend who ordered takeout described it as a fast food type restaurant. The quality of the food was amazing! I had been craving Indian food our entire trip in Vegas because we kept noticing the Masala Express sign near the entrance to Fatburger as we walked back to our hotel. (The restaurant is conveniently located ON THE STRIP! Near M&M and Coca Cola gift stores.)

We ordered 1) butter chicken entree and 1) chana masala entree and both were super delicious! My friend had to have ordered around 10PM (they are open 24 hours) and the food surprisingly still tasted so fresh and was the perfect temperature. The butter chicken had just the right amount of kick to it, and the chana masala paired so perfectly with the warm naan bread. The servings were HUGE! We had plenty of yummy leftovers, so so happy we tried this place out. 

I'm removing one star because I bit into a clove/nut/seed/spice of some sort from the basmati rice. Whatever it was- was hard and I literally heard it crack between my teeth. It was edible but was definitely unpleasant. 

All in all, who would have thought this little Indian Express restaurant would serve the most delicious food & satisfy my Indian craving! Hope this place is still around on our next visit.",Iqd0GKA08bBtn_2gI331Lw,2,0,4,1ImPzcpKzbSxLn5eioF24w
4604387,2018-04-07,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,I had a take out of biriyani and chicken tikka Masala . It's the worst biriyani have had in my life and make things worse they use Indian lemon pickle with lemon seeds in biriyani which made me puke . The butter nan was puny and it's definitely not nan . Chicken tikka Masala was average . Avoid this place and save your money.,DriIka1GJ4wxMUZiYUwW0g,0,0,1,mPm0wFpnPRsHi6wGy7NyGg
4798435,2018-05-11,0,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,"Noticed this place on my way from the Linq to MGM Grand. I was craving Indian while in Vegas so seeing their sign, I knew I had to try it!

It is located on the Strip, there's also a Mexican place, a pizza joint and a don't shop in the same building. 

Ordered the Paneer Butter Masala, and the samosa.  Both were good, although the samosas were a bit dry. What I didn't like are their flimsy, thin plates, I had to ask them 3 times to give me an extra one or a tray so my food doesn't just spill.

If you need a fix of Indian food while you're staying somewhere in the strip, definitely try it out! A few other great things about it are outdoor sitting with mist sprays, and that it's open 24/7.",IU0MJTZHXDKdobNm5u-xvQ,0,0,4,A4_Kqw65XIo917vz38q0IA
5171651,2018-04-15,1,RsrVsDtlaFw96UAoWj0HWA,Do not order food early in the morning. We made that mistake and got stale food. The chutney had turned bitter. Sambar was just reheated. The idly was hard. I have eaten bad Indian food at other places but never thought someone could go wrong with idly-chutney so badly,bXSbd7aDchW0xLKp6FPDmQ,0,0,1,O_CvCBiY3t_ZmYbNbwHf6A

The verity of different types of food in this plaza makes it great for other people to find exactly what they want or mix it up!
