818407,2016-02-07,0,iovb0ZOssmF1mftOgBGFIA,I had the Busby Siegle (beef aujus)  roast beef was slice thin and tasteless maybe If I had order aujus on the side it would have taste better.  Good thing I had salt an pepper to help the bland taste. Also a over flow of spicy mustard on roll.,BP6bi5gbK_JNSp3bWFM5qA,0,0,2,XLJJNgKjERsF-utlVT2PVg

Great value!  The hot dog was delicious and was only $2.99-3.99!

Apparently a hot dog store from Detroit.",PYRIiQilTl1rkx83hm8ttA,2,1,5,IpLeALAaZaZlai7OlZoQTQ

The two things I didn't like is that you can't do your own condiments and the fries aren't listed separately so I didn't even see them until we were leaving because they are listed in the middle of the entire menu.

I got the hot link and it was really good but I didn't like the chopped onions or relish. My son liked his regular hot dog but I wasn't impressed with the bite I tried.

My mom and  my sister didn't really like their items (polish and a chili dog).",VMB2Q7zGzuoi1RDTa8xuWw,1,0,3,W4NejTmg1lzmj1wz8UGfRQ

He did it to a couple people in front of me and did it to a old man and his wife for over $7. Total dick",LNNgboBVQy0ANSr1MMxNEA,3,0,1,9_8yuBfqm93sNjZW5RNd8Q
