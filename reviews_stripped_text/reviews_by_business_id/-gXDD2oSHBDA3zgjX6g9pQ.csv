My friend ordered the roasted chicken, it was canned chicken! He had to smoother it in canned gravy and cranberry sauce to make it edible. Two others had nachos that were not good and my husbands sloppy joe had corn in it and it said it came with cheese but there wasn't any on it. I think the only items with no major complaints were the wings and tuna melt. If you are just going for the beer then this is a good place to go.",uQP6jYg3qQMIvD3fm6V_mA,0,0,2,Zod34P0IHsRXKQRSDHgGXQ

I ordered a spinach and artichoke dip, it was delicious.  The bartenders were friendly and handled a busy bar well.  The owners are very welcoming.  Always saying hello to their guests and making an effort to let us know they appreciate our patronage.  I will definitely be back!!!",I9-L5ggTEueyhO0jwTlzsw,0,0,5,-a_9aipMvJfwoav5SzM24w

Its a great place to relax and have a few drinks after work...but they need to find a new band for Friday nights. The band they've has been tolerable until tonight. I'm open to many different types of music but I don't go to a bar to listen to opera. It has its place in the music world, but a bar on Friday nights is not it. I like to go here to relax, not fall asleep. I will return on Friday nights, but if they start singing opera, I'm headed home.",UedZb3eZUPN1QqX0kcIxxQ,0,0,3,3MQXl-eXtO2PG_WTpn_qvA

I like going on the nights they have curio key. The bartender is always very kind to.

All apps are half priced after midnight, this actually is great news, unfortunately for me i get off the bus at 11 PM so i miss it but that much hopefully they'll make an exception since I'm a local and come often, otherwise it's an amazing deal! dont know how i got charged $15 in the past when the regular price is 12.00 and half off is $7.00. Great food, good drinks, and relaxing environment. Check out The Plate for yourself :)",L0r9LBWM96q-cssoR5rBhA,0,0,4,eBa6T5qEcg4eJ9lAeq9Pvg

4654195,2017-03-28,0,-gXDD2oSHBDA3zgjX6g9pQ,"Not sure how to rate this bar?
#1 NO dart board and only one pool table. 
#2 NO draft beer.
The bartender was totally absent from his duties and he walked by me twice when I had an empty beer in front of me. As I cashed out from my michene and waited the bartender was sitting at a machine himself at the far end of the bar oblivious to anything but the game he was playing and I had to call out to get his attention.
I overheard one Patron saying to another that the food there was good but I didn't order anything to eat so I cannot comment on the menu.
As far as I'm concerned,no dartboard, no draft beer and inattentive service is a no-go for me.",QxPOcYiscssFOX4oKCQ_IA,1,0,2,B7SRfyLcSWUnQ5yeb89fnQ

We ran across this joint on recommendation from a friend.  We ended up there 5-6 times.  Food is great.  We had breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Awesome burgers even at wee hours of the morning. Many includes apps, salads, burgers, lasagne, roast chicken dinner and much more.  Many menu items. 

 The staff i remember the names of Rachel, Laurie, Josh, Kelly, Johnny, Oh and Bonnie Beverage we all great fun.  I will make this a destination during my next trip to Vegas. 

Oh they have Karaoke on Saturdays.  There was a great band that got a lot of people dancing one night.  They are staring a car cruise in on Saturdays that i am disappointed I could not stay  in town for.  Will be there for that and the Friday Fish Fry next trip",uiqO0tMVL1XPuspt_rxkJQ,0,0,5,OAybdzeBy8hx5qnwFHVjNA

Cook needs to attend culinary school.

The owners, and staff are awesome and all around good company.
This is truly a home away from home, but without the drama. I would definitely recommend coming in and checking this bar out, if you having already! 
Plus, they are always doing bingo nights, raffle drawings, karaoke, and other fun stuff. Definitely a 5 star rating!",wVMWjhPJIN4XnZntMjR0Hw,0,0,5,b0ILuYTwR7VX-nmgJd1G-w
5892135,2018-06-03,0,-gXDD2oSHBDA3zgjX6g9pQ,"Only when truly deserved do I take the time to lambast a really sorry establishment. The Plate fully qualifies for failing to meet even minimal standards. When a $15.99 prime rib dinner is being ordered, the obvious first inquiry from order taker would be as to how you would like it: rare, medium, or well done. Shane, the inept bartender, fails to even bother with that rudimentary step. When presented with the order, I noticed that the garlic toast and dessert were missing. Shane informs that they have no garlic toast and that strawberry jello is available, if desired, as they are out of cheesecake! Obviously, any normal kitchen can prepare garlic toast in minutes unless they have no bread - his excuse is so disingenuous as to be ludicrous. If something on the joint's menu white board signage is not going to be included for whatever reason, management (competent management that is) would simply remove the item with the wipe of a finger. Not these darlings. When my bill came to $22.80, I asked how much was the beer I had while waiting. Reply was, $4.50 plus a take out charge. The meat was gifted to a neighbor who has a big dog. I strongly suggest avoiding this dump at all cost.",oVRLlrG37sYRZlo_NgF3_A,0,0,1,N1oxXuNhRzJAgnDIfapGqQ
