300102,2012-03-14,0,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,"So terrible I sought out this website to warn others off! I ordered take-out Kung Pao Chicken and got a soupy mess, with a handful of burnt chilis thrown on top destroying any flavor? with spicy burnt chili flavor.  Inedible disgusting food I would not serve my worst enemy.  The deliver person was very friendly and the food showed up quickly but I would've been better off licking the crud off the bottom of my refrigerator.  Not Japanese.  Not even Asian.  Dis. Gust. Ting.  Also my soda was completely flat and my egg rolls had no taste at all but burnt brown things on the wrapper and some sort of mystery meat inside - and not in a tasty chinese-food mystery meat kind of way - a tasteless, has anyone seen the cat? type mystery meat",wWNqHv7ewywmFqeH5cGN3w,0,0,1,P8biFWq-5aY0hTXS89GnPg
523547,2010-07-15,1,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,"Tried out Teriyaki III at there new location. 2585 E. Flamingo Rd. Suite 16, Las Vegas NV, 89121.

Had the teriyaki chicken bowl with Brown rice.   It did not dissapoint, the sauce wasn't too sweet and the brown rice was moist.   Great Service as well.

My only grip is that there new location only has two tables inside for diners.  From what I can figure out, it's because there is no public bathroom for customers so there's a limitation on In-house dining.",J2v086DdcJQ7UduCLggpBw,1,0,3,IAoGrMVk6qEe5WfqEkDVRw

2421700,2011-09-13,0,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,"Went with my spouse today to use a Groupon Now voucher we got. I'm a vegetarian and ordered the House Special To Fu and crab ragoon (which doesn't actually contain crab), and my spouse got the orange chicken.

Both came with fried rice, which was delicious. The tofu I ordered was really good, and I loved all the veggies and sauce that came with it. My spouse enjoyed the orange chicken. The portions were huge, and an incredible deal for the price.

I see that a review below says that they only have two tables. This must have changed recently as they had ten tables and a sign pointing to the restroom in the back.",Hmjo4sLUIHpuBs5aenOT7w,2,0,5,JN936sAnI0pcHPfyJURq5g
2533832,2007-04-05,0,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,"When I first started at my job, a co-worker of mine told me I should go pick him and myself up some teriyaki bowls form here.  He swore they were good.  I went around the corner and ordered, brought them back, opened my bowl and stared in horror at what lay before me.  Various pieces of chicken - none of them identifiable as pieces of chicken.  It was mostly fat.  They were encased in a sticky, thick almost black sauce that I'm sure at one point may have resembled teriyaki before it was boiled down for hours.  I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites, and I'll eat almost anything.  

I stared in even more horror as my co-worker devoured every bit.  I guess some people like this place.  Definitely not me.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,1,0,1,ieBr38hNtO-dD1jsurp95A
3100571,2011-10-18,0,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,"Worst mongolian beef, beef broccoli, lo mein, white rice & fried rice, teriyaki chicken, ever. DO NOT EAT HERE. The food is ROTTEN. They douse it with so much sauce to hide it. I thought I was gonna die that day. I only found out the food was rotten when bit half a large piece and then forced myself to vomit to prevent my death lmao.

The fried rice and white rice have obviously been in a fridge in that same takeout box for at least 2-3 weeks and they still served it!? It was so gummy and stunk horribly when I slid the food onto a plate!!!

What a disgrace to Asian cuisine! How dare they! Freaking pathetic.",7lXJ1xfcuVNk-i1B48oGvA,1,0,1,WPrUI3RcmQHxK-6aSf-Ceg

4940261,2007-09-22,0,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,Not bad for a strip mall restaurant - visiting family in town that are on that side of town.  Talk about cheap food - we tried the combo meal combo chow mein and the saipan noodle soup - enjoyed it a lot.  the inside is so different from the last review - anyways - enjoyed it - the food is freshly cooked - will definitely come back.,Xlq5p3QsroF4p2t928Hzeg,0,1,4,aIG-KhdGb1E8evF-cjK3DA
5884780,2012-01-22,0,MrU-vfQCbSUCroFbxk5p4A,"I had a chicken Teri bowl for $3.79. I thought is was absolutely amazing! The rice was moist and fresh! The chicken was  moist and had the right amount of sauce. It also had steamed veggies of cabbage, carrot, and broccoli. They were slightly steamed which was great. The veggies were fresh and not wilted. I really thought that I should have been charged more for the food. Will definitely be back for more!",c22DWKlOM-fzHggyG_NxFQ,1,0,5,nnf_5w1sX6k6H_o5_NJzhA
