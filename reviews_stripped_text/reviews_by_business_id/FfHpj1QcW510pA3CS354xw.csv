Service was a bit slow but that's because they had a skeleton crew and it was 4 am in the morning. Wished they served Pho around the clock though.

257492,2010-02-03,0,FfHpj1QcW510pA3CS354xw,"Disclaimer: I have only eaten here during the wee hours of the morning (think 5~6am) as an attempt to somewhat sober up before heading up to my room so I'm giving this place one more star than I normally would have. 

What we've ordered: 
**bacon, cheddar broccoli omelet - lots of ingredients, the bacon overload makes it slightly salty.. perhaps a little too salty
**mushroom, swiss cheese omelet - i'd say this is your best bet if you're okay with mushrooms 
**chicken fingers - steer clear, there's not much chicken in the chicken fingers, just really thick breading 

Cons: Prices are steep for Denny's caliber food, about $14-15 for an omelet but portions are generous so they can be split (unless you're a lumber jack).

Bottom line: Would I ever eat here completely sober? No. Is this a good place to get your grub on after a night of crazy partying and drunken debauchery? Absolutely!",ju_noqGoCkcyc_2JzZtODw,0,0,3,nB3Mu-IIuHSZgAb4znmStQ

404098,2015-07-15,0,FfHpj1QcW510pA3CS354xw,"First let me start out by letting you, the reader, know my qualifications and why i never write review on servers or service professionals. 
I have owned my own business and managed others. 
I have worked in the food industry many times over the years. Both as a bartender and waiter. 
I have plenty of certifications to do other things but my current job is wonderful and it's why I love being a waiter now at this point in my life. 
We serve 25-35 people all at once during a 2 hr window prior to a show at one of the top fine dining dinner theaters in the world. 
I've also waited tables at quick dining and fine dining  restaurants where people come in and eat and they leave. 
Which is why I understand the issues behind dealing with shitty customers who don't tip, are obnoxious, unrealistic, bitchy, demanding, and downright rude mother fracking cheapskates. 18-20% people. That's what you need to tip. 
Waiters remember the assholes they serve. If you don't tip they remember you and trust waiters give a shit who you are when you come in every time every day or once a year. 
We always remember. 
And don't give us a damn religious pamphlet because you're cheap and WONT tip. (Not cant but WONT).
-----------
Now. 
I sat at THE COFFEE SHOP/PHO RESTAURANT for 15 minutes before I was asked for something to drink. 
Then it took the waiter another 20 minutes, (yes) I watched my phone timer, to come up to my table, open his book and stand there without saying anything as if I'm supposed to read his mind so I just started giving him my order and then he simply walked away. 
It took another 25 minutes for the food. 
The place is worn out, the booths are hard as a rock and the cushions on both booths I tried out were so bad the springs could be felt when sitting. 
At least I hope it was that or it was a dead animal. 
-----------
It made me itch just being there. 
The walls and ledges are dusty and dirty they look like they get cleaned about 2x a Month. 
----------
The food is amazing. 
Huge portions. 
The Chicken Pho soup is fantastic. 
Great portions of chicken, noodles and pea pods. 
The Club sandwich is absolutely the biggest club and fry platter I've ever seen. 
Amazing turkey and tomato and bacon flavor. 
Unbelievable. 
Love the food. 
But the staff...
The staff is unfriendly, unhappy, rude, not welcoming, and they DO NOT SMILE. 
There is NO WAY I would EVER allow anyone to work the floor 
if they can't even smile and act as if I'm the first table of their day and I happen to be their best friend. 
These people all over the casino need a lesson in customer service. 
Treat us like gold or you'll lose a lot of money. 
Food-fabulous, 4 stars. 
Staff in restaurants. Rude.
Staff in shops and pool area.
Super friendly and fabulous. 
I'd love to help and do more to change this because I love this Hotel and would love to call it home someday. 
It's just too dry in Vegas for me to live there right now.

My wife said the pho was okay, but she loves that watery crap, no matter how it tastes. They didn't seem very busy, but the service was really slow.

Service 


Server very and friendly however on seeing my almost full plate of the left over food she did not question as to why or ask if I wanted something else.
My thoughts were perhaps  she was used to people leaving full plates of food which is very worrying and disgraceful for a coffee place/restaurant in a hotel.

Food

Ordered the Qusedillas which came with Pico De Gio and Sour Cream. 
I asked for no sour cream.
When It arrived it was poorly plated, soggy and tasteless. It was not at all crispy or fresh tasting.
The chicken was hard to find and what was in it was stringy and there was lots of onions and what i thought might be stringy green pepper stuck on the cheese.

WORST place I've ever been to in Vegas, right when we walked in we were VERY rudely greeted, lady right away told me that because our group was large if we don't split up we'd be charge a 18% tip, (which I appreciate her telling me) but I was caught off guard and I said excuse me could you repeat that? she rolled her eyes at me and repeated herself.. okay whatever hoe, I let it go.

We were sat fairly quickly, my group was a table of 4 at a booth, I was on the outer side, I'm a decently tall guy (about 6 feet) so when you sit me in a booth the size meant for midgets my legs will stick out a bit on the edge, the server came by and kicked my foot.. ""HEY MOVE YOUR FOOT INSIDE"" I obeyed her orders, a bit shocked but whatever YOLO HO, so I did. after she walked away I discussed it with my friends we agreed that maybe English wasn't her first language so just to let it go. 

but of course my leg slipped out a bit again, she walked to our table and kicked my foot again- ""REALLY? AGAIN? YOU REALLY PUT YOUR FOOT OUT AGAIN?"" I replied that I'm a bigger guy and I can't keep my leg inside completely under the table (mind you I wasn't STICKING IT OUT, and nobody was going to trip over my food) then she starts to lash out at me about how I can't keep my foot inside, so I finally got fed up and said ""YOU REALLY ARE GOING TO KICK ME AND YELL AT ME?!!?"" she said ""YOU KICKED ME, YOU JUST KICKED ME"" wtf r u serious?!?!?!?! I wasn't even moving my foot the whole time we were talking, she accused me of kicking her when my foot wasn't even moving?! go lick a nut lady, you're effin crazy!!! 

I made it a point to her that I wasn't going to take her yelling at me and she replied ""OHH I'M JUST TEASING YOUUUU"" then walked away, yea no lady, this shit ain't going to fly in my house. I'm usually VERY courteous to my servers and I know they have a tough job, but when you're going to YELL AT ME?! and accuse me of doing something I didn't do you can suck it.

However, the server forgot to put in one of our orders (there were only 6 of us), and then my other friend's food was cold, and so she asked to have it heated. The server left to do something and forgot about her. The next time she saw her, the server remembered, and took it to get it reheated (finally). The place was dead at this time, by the way. So with both of those incidents that were the fault of the server, it would have been nice to be offered a discount, free dessert, something, but we got none of that. Overall I think we were all fairly satisfied with the food (though mine was a little too oily). My friend had a breakfast sandwich at Denny's the night before that she thought was DISGUSTING, and the one at The Coffee Shop made up for it. The server, while slow, was very nice.

Well, I already wanted to kiss this place because of their coffee.

Seriously, we REALLY needed the caffeine! But, they don't stop there. We ordered their Italian omelette, and this was served to us in large portions, with a side of hash browns and generously buttered, toasted wheat bread. I knew we didn't have to eat anything else until dinner. The food was delicious too! Not to mention they had Tapatio sauce! My friend introduced this to me recently, and I got hooked. It's similar to Frank's red hot sauce, except it's spicier. I doused my entire omelette and hash browns with Tapatio sauce! Heaven! Surprisingly, their diner also served Pho and other Vietnamese dishes. So, if you'd rather eat this the morning after too much drinking, then by all means! Next time, we'll definitely give this part of the menu a go.

She never apologized for not refilling his coke sooner, just acted flustered when my husband asked for it. Btw, this was not a busy Monday night. When she came back, she refilled his coke and put the check on the table. And the coke was flat. Like it literally tasted like watered down syrup. I thought for sure she would have taken the coke off the bill, but she didn't. AND the coke was $3.75!!! I feel like we would have had better food and service for a cheaper price at Denny's!

In Vegas, I was getting over some mild food poisoning from a different restaurant and my bf had a cold so our bodies couldn't really handle going out anywhere too fancy or even out of the hotel.  We definitely did not want buffet food and had already tried the pho in the hotel so we decided to give the coffee shop in Treasure Island a try for some simple food.  

My appetite was coming back so I decided to get the fried chicken dinner.  it came with a choice of soup or salad - I opted for the French onion soup (which was a $1.50 extra).  The bf ordered spaghetti with meatballs with the chicken noodle soup.

The spaghetti was edible - nothing terrible but nothing spectacular either but I never find spaghetti spectacular anyway.  The meatballs were very large and it was plenty of food to eat.  The chicken noodle soup was not good though - very cold and salty.  My fried chicken dinner was yummy!  It came with four pieces of chicken, fried sort of southern style.  It also had mashed potatoes and veggies.  The potatoes were yummy..veggies were ok.  The chicken was really flavorful and juicy though.  I saw a lot of other tables also order this and everyone seemed happy.  I could only eat about half of that plate, so maybe the $18 price tag was almost acceptable.  The French onion soup I also ordered was delicious!  A little salty but I'd rather this soup be more salty than sweet.  It was really savory & I finished that bowl clean!

Food is decent here but sometimes you'll wait a long time.  Plus, prices are expensive for the food you're getting but I guess since it's open 24 hours that makes it's better than nothing.  I'd eat here again if I didn't want to leave the hotel.",GVYg18F-Rkuk63hvtHoG5Q,1,1,3,4A2rk8nhN1d7r1GwfvWo-A

This is where things go bad.  
1. The service was not as good as we expected for an eatery in Vegas.  The server was a little impolite as he gave us our menus.  The waitress came and gave us so-so service.  She was not nice when I asked her questions about the menu.  She didn't want to help me make a decision.  Instead, she seemed annoyed of my questions.  If I had paid the bill, there would be little to zero tip.

2. The food was not bad, but it was not as spectacular as posted in front of the cafe and in some yelp reviews.  It was a little more expensive than I expected for the food they served us.  My omelet was pretty good.  The size was worth the price, but I expected a bit more.  It being a Vegas restaurant, but maybe, I had expected too much.  That was probably more my fault; if anything.  However, my wife's waffles were not good at all.  This dish was definitely not worth the price.  Too dry and I believe my wife complained about the overly sweetness of the food.  

3. The coffee SHOULD be better.  If coffee is in the title, the customer would probably think that the coffee is superb.  However, the coffee was not as good as the stuff I make at home.  Sure, I have both 100% Kona, Ka`u, and darker Italian roasts at home to spoil my tastebuds.  However, I expected a good cup of joe to start off my honeymoon with a soothing bang, but the old grinds the coffee tasted was from, ruined that morning until we went out for dinner later on that night.  

Las Vegas restaurants should be more up to par.  However, some places I will never patronize again due to these bad experiences which I have encountered during this trip.  Cheers to you all yelpers.  Have a good one!",X4CZvuUzU32JgDbKCfbpQQ,3,2,3,SXG2iGJWVjBRYXf5rcpjig

i ordered the french toast (which is something i don't order too often) and i must say that it was freaking delicious.  melt in your mouth type french toast that just mad hit the spot.  they actually give you three generous slices of some sort of thick bread.  i'm not sure if it's the same as the toast that comes w/ other meals, but it's freaking good.

i tasted the french onion soup and true to form it was a bit too salty for my palate.  my bro seemed to enjoy it though.  he also ordered a mushroom omelet.  the other sibs got the eggs, bacon and hash.  oh and it wasn't the measly two strips of bacon.  it was more like a pile of bacon.  from what i heard....it was quite tasty.  

so all in all.  we had a nice late night meal after a night of gambling.  the coffee shop was definitely a nice finish to it.  oh and the service was good.  very attentive and helpful....even went to the kitchen to figure out what kind of syrup was provided with the french toast.  that's what i call a good server.

Food was decent, I don't think you can screw up eggs scramble or over easy.  Grandma didn't like the steak; she felt that it was over cooked and to me it looked like cheap meat.  I couldn't go wrong with the all american, but I do wish that they would give me 2 sasuage and 2 bacon instead of one or the other.  Seriously, for over $10 and you can give me both?  Uncle made a poor choice on getting the philly.  Just looked like stir fried beef, onions, and bell pepper on bread.  Nothing special.  Gf didn't even finish her club, enough said.

I was seated right next to a bussing station, so there were always people walking by.  It took me 10 minutes to get a simple glass of water, and a bus boy brought it to me.  It was a full 15 minutes before I even ordered; the corn beef hash, eggs, hash browns, and toast.

The food was only mediocre, at best.  The toast was burnt, the hash had too many red-peppers to the point it was over-powering.

So we took the tram-thing over to The Coffee Shop next to Pho in TI and the menu was just like what we were looking for. Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Potato, Toast, Pancake.

But then a quick breakfast pit stop became a LONG and drawn out morning with minimal and very poor service by ladies in a very bad mood. It was not even that early! Like, 9am! Come on! They were so bitchy and unfriendly and had the most sour looks ever! I know this is not Disney Land, but do you have to make it a bitchfest so early in the morning???

People came into the cafe and then people who came in AFTER us started to get their food BEFORE us. It was not complicated food we had ordered. And Egg is and Egg really. You just crack it into a pan and watch it fry up and throw the hashbrowns onto the oil and whatever.

The bitchfest was contagious and we started to get bitchy and restless too, starting to join the mood of our servers. When the table that had the baby at it got their food at the same time as us - but had come in the restaurant an HOUR after us -- that was THE LAST STRAW.

We ate in bitchy silence fuming, having waited like 2 hours for a simple meal of Eggs. And the hashbrowns were tasteless and limp. Even I can make better hashbrowns than that.

To top it all off, the waitress LIED on the bill about what time we actually came in the restaurant, putting down a time, like, 45 minutes later.

I exited to the casino (and got hit on by a disgusting drunk man) while my friend bitched it up to the manager.

MGM Mirage casinos are notorious for being un-user friendly when trying to redeem your points.

When we dined on the Asian side, I ordered chicken pho.  It was okay to good.  The vietnamese coffee was excellent, but the only way you can screw this up is if you get the coffee grounds in it or if there's not enough sweetened condensed milk.

On the American side (as I call them for easier reference), the menu is quite large!!!  The prices are moderate to high for the type of food you are ordering.  For instance, I think the 2 egg breakfast w/bacon is around $10.  You can go to a ""local"" diner and get the same thing for $6.  Anyway, the breakfasts look great!  The eggs are done to perfection and taste as good.  The breakfast potatoes need a little help and I would say they are bland and mediocre.   On another trip, I got a dinner salad which was very good!  All of the ingredients looked and tasted fresh.  I asked for some things to be omitted on my salad and the server got my order correct!  Kudos to her (I really thought she'd eff it up)!  Though I did not ever try the burgers, fries, waffles, or pancakes, they all looked scrumptious (I was admiring them from afar).  The service on this side of The Coffee Shop is in need of some serious help.  They seem to have enough people working, however, the staff need a bit more direction.

The Coffee Shop offers decent drunk/hangover food at high prices. We came here after a night at the clubs and had ""hungry eyes"". We were seated quickly and I had my mind on one thing - a sandwich and fries. 

Their late night menu had some good options but the prices were ridiculous. $14.95 for a club sandwich and fries?! That's a little much don't ya think? Anyway, it did the job and soaked up all the alcohol from the night. The boy and I shared and the sandwich itself was actually pretty good, but the fries could have been better. I would have much preferred McDonald's fries! 

My friends had the french toast and the BLT sandwich with fries and they both said it was good for what it is. 

My only real complaint, aside from the prices, was the service. Now, I know at 4 a.m. the last thing anyone wants to do is deal with drunk people, but none of us were obnoxious, belligerent or puking everywhere, so what's with the sass?!

We had to wait a bit for a table but the more annoying part was after we were seated we waited forever for our waitress.  I understand she was swamped but argh.  I guess it would have been less annoying if we weren't in a rush...but we were.  Ha.  

I ate my weight in pancakes.  And I am a big girl.  So that's a lot of pancakes.  I ordered some pancake stack that also came with sausage, bacon AND eggs.  Yep.  And I ate it all.  I swear.  Okay, I am lying, I shared the sausage with my boyfriend, but only because he always shares his with me *eyebrow raise*. 

I got my own pot of coffee which was a nice touch.  Kind of dangerous because I have this well documented problem where if a drink is in front of me, I can't help but drink it.  Quickly.  I drive servers crazy with how many times they have to refill my water glass.  And so it went with the coffee.  I was so obsessed with drinking as much of it as possible (the goal was ALL of it but that was unattainable) that I used up all of my (and most of my boyfriend's) ice cubes trying to cool it down.  That's how they trick you! They make it so hot that you can't chug it.  But I got around that! Joke's on them!

Someone may scoldingly ask you if you're VIP and when you say ""no."" They'll make you stand in the other line - even if you're the only one up there.  It didn't happen to us, but my BF and I were sitting right by the entrance area and I saw it happen.

Anyway, we ate here twice, during our stay.  The first time, was on our first day - I had the Lox and Bagel, which was very good - the smoked salmon was cut pretty thick and there was more than enough cream cheese for my bagel.  My BF had some sort of fritata thing that was pretty good.

Our second meal here was a shared clubhouse sandwich which was very much needed after a night at PURE. It was good, or we were drunk - but we ate it up!

We also ordered room service twice, which is where the food comes from.  We had to get room service, after arriving back from our overnighter to Disneyland and the lines for both the Coffee Shop and the buffet were crazy long.  BF got the Prime Rib (whaaaaaat?!) and I got a Veggie Burger, mainly because it had avocado on it!

Location (4): This restaurant locates inside Treasure Island. It's right by the path to the lobby and concierge. The restaurant is spacious because it's a joint restaurant between the Coffee Shop with American cuisine and the Pho shop with Vietnamese cuisine. However, the Pho menu isn't available until 11am. This restaurant is the only restaurant on the strip that serves a full menu of Vietnamese food. If you want to have pho at a buffet, I know the Bacchanal has it! 

Service (2): If you stay at Treasure Island, you can order food from this restaurant and they would charge some fees for it.

She walked away with a bad attitude and never came back to help the guests clean... I was lucky that I was not that girl who had to go through this.
Precaution: If you want to have hot tea, they will only serve one teapot per person and give you an attitude if you ask for an extra cup to share with your loved ones. Who does that!? Well, they do :(

Food (2.5): Since the restaurant offers two menus, you can order whatever. For breakfast, we ordered the chicken wonton soup from the Coffee shop menu since pho isn't offered until 11am. Overall, it's edible. For dinner, we tried the beef noodle, rice dishes and the chicken curry noodle. The beef noodle was the ONLY legitimate dish out of all the dishes we tried. Cos they charge around $13/beef pho, the size was HUGE! You can easily share among two people. With the rice dish, their marinated pork chop is not very good...

Anyways, my boss and I stopped in for breakfast before checking out on our last morning.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The portions were big, but not outrageously so. Good value (of course). Not too greasy. Above average diner food. 

The boss had french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast came with all the fixings - powdered sugar, syrup and butter.  Boss-lady enjoyed her morning heart attack meal.  The waitress only flinched once when she asked for MORE powdered sugar to accompany the already powder-white french toast.  

I had a standard 2-eggs, bacon, hash brown and toast meal.  Everything was pretty good for what it is. It was surprisingly (pleasantly so) not overly greasy. I was pleased to find my scrambled eggs were fluffy and not over-cooked, and not covered in grease. The bacon was also crispy and not too greasy (I wonder if they are actually cooking their bacon in the oven and letting the fat drip off).  Toast was standard. Nothing was overcooked which is surprising in this day and age of hypochondriacs and under-developed food palettes. The coffee was a tinge stronger than one would expect.

Prices were fair (although my boss did complain that her side of bacon was about $8...but she did get like 6 or 7 pieces of bacon with that order...which seems fair since most places charge $2-3 for a side of bacon with 2 pcs).

The service was good. We never had to ask for coffee refills. Out waitress was nice enough.  She wasn't speedy but wasn't slow either. No complaints here.

We stopped in to order some coffee and what I got was something that taste like instant coffee. It was so weak I asked the waiter if I could get a fresh cup. He said it was fresh and that if I wanted something stronger I should order the expresso. I kindly agreed to the expresso and after a few minutes he came out with a cup. He was very nice and waited for me to taste it before he left. But in reality, even the expresso was very weak. It wasn't that dark color nor was it in a small expresso cup that you normally would get when ordering expresso. It was again weak, more like a tad bit stronger coffee and in a normal coffee cup size. So I kindly nodded a ""no"" with the waiter and he told me he'll be right back with a double shot. Once he returned with another coffee cup sized expresso, a little stronger than last but yet not expresso. I just kindly nodded a ""yes"" to him and we both smiled.

A blueberry muffin and granola/yogurt/berry parfait, me a mushroom and Gruyere omelette (asked for half the cheese) were fine. I appreciated the never-ending pot of coffee on the table. 

For dinner two nights before, Cantonese classics: sweet and sour pork and honey walnut shrimp.

Breakfast and dinner were neither bad nor excellent. They were all okay dishes, mostly for their convenience and that they were served hot.

All in all, good place to grab some late night food, but it is on the pricier side.

They were decent, not really worth the $$ but still ok. We got pho with tendon, meatballs, and beef, which was awesome. Really pretty good food, with lots of basil and fresh jalapeño.

This wasn't a gin joint, but a coffee shop.  THE Coffee Shop.  Kudos to TI for coming up with an interesting, creative, and artistic name for their joint.  Of course, if they knew what a coffee shop was in Amsterdam, they might have re-thunk it.

Having skipped dinner before going to the 9:30 Mystere show, it was bordering on 11:30 when we got out of the theater, and this Cinderella was hungry.  Not wanting to wait any longer, we learned that our choices at TI were pretty much limited to a hot dog place or the coffee shop.  With a heavy heart, we chose the latter.

I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't too disappointed, but sticker-shocked at the prices compared to our locals casinos.  And we were elated, yet wary, when we were seated and handed the regular menu along with a Pho/Cantonese one.  (Should that be faux Cantonese?  You decide).

Prince Charming and I both opted for Asian.  He chose a pho, thinking it came with shredded chicken.  But when it was delivered, it was filled with pieces of chicken on the bone, which he detests.  Our server, Phyllis, explained that he had confused the chicken in the pho with the one in the noodle dish, and cheerfully offered to have it redone with shredded chicken.

I ordered the noodle dish with beef.  I was expecting a nice, hot dish to stop me from shivering under the blasting a/c all over the restaurant, which was 20 degrees colder than the casino.  But what was served was cold noodles over a bed of lettuce, with room-temp beef.  Does the Board of Health know about their beef temperature?  Once again, Phyllis came to the rescue, offering to bring me a bowl of hot broth to dump my dish into.  That helped warm me up, but it wasn't until I stole the basil, bean sprouts, and lime from my husband's pho, and added a spoonful of the nam plak that came with my dish, that it had enough flavor to satisfy.

The Coffee Shop served its purpose.  The service was terrific.  It isn't terrible, just the equivalent of ""any port in a storm.""",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,8,3,5mfb_FtCFTBBlKSObe63hw

While waiting we tried to talk to a manager who said it would be right out even though at that point we just wanted to cancel the order.he basically ignored us.Next we tried explain that situation to a waitress who promptly ignored everything I said and walked away.

I order the Downtown Breakfast Sandwich every time - I think the sandwich was personally designed for my taste buds, and I highly recommend it. My husband likes the Tower of French Toast, as it has different fruit varieties. They also have very inexpensive but heavily alcohol filled Mimomas.

We would never come to The Coffee Shop for anything other than breakfast because truthfully they offer standard sandwich and chicken tender type foods that we can find at home for a third the price, and there isn't anything memorable about the restaurant - it's very bare bones and diner-y.

We were all having a good time, excited that we would get protein and I was going to get pancakes as well. Imagine, pancakes after south beach. I was working hard so this utlra-non food was going to be perfect to a day of lounging followed by crazy walking up and down the strip. 

We started noticing that 3 tables who came later than us (way later, like after we had long placed our orders) were getting their food and exiting!

The server who gave us the liquids changed to another lady who seemed strung out and over worked but seriously, who complains before getting the food unless you're okay with spit and bodily fluids not from your own body. She had a stack of bills in her hands and were inputting info into the computer. We doubted that she even entered our order at one point. 

Another lady from the counter got up to complain and it was obvious that we weren't the only ones fuming with empty stomachs.

To be honest, the food was pretty good except I recall someone complaining about some processed cheese but I was in already in food-coma to pay attention. After we ate, I was ready to complain. Two people of our party quickly made their exit but come on, I wasn't going to make a scene.

I found a manager who looked like she had something going on upstairs and explained all the facts. The waitress came over and confessed that she was having a hard time with ONE (1) customer (at the counter) and hence, she was slow in filling orders. ONE customer caused this.

The manager was only able to comp us 50% but that was good enough since our belly was filled.
