1044,2010-05-13,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Tommy Bahamas is great.  I have eaten at their restaurants in Maui, Palm Desert, and here in Vegas- they are all consistently fabulous.  Service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar (there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar).  Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,5,zmVpf7r00n7zNvZ-htWvVg

We sat at the bar and our server was extremely kind and attentive.  We had the poke appi and shared a fried fish sandwich (not quite Florida Keys Greg's Restaurant with the fried grouper sandwich), but oh so close.  The key lime pie was fantastic coupled with a hot cup o'joe.

Our waitress was very attentive and was full of suggestions. there was a 3 course for $33 per person menu which wasn't bad at all we had a goat cheese appetizer, the ""famous"" coconut shrimp which were huge (delicious) and split a small Caesar salad. for an entrée we both had the island cowboy medallions.... they were cooked to perfections and were so juicy the mashed potatoes were run of the mill and the asparagus weren't tough at all... for desert i had the key lime pie which i thought was way too bitter and the coconut cake my girl had was sweet and not overrun with coconut taste.... the mai tai i had was done pretty well and the drink my girl was recommended was super strong.... only downside of the evening outside the key lime pie was we had to ask for water it wasn't just brought out with meal and the bread (which was hot and (tasty) was accompanied with apple butter we both thought that with all the sweet notes we ordered a salty one would have worked better but all in all i loved that place and i will return again",M6tSmOu1SD-TqcjVbJPdzg,0,0,4,fVaRWzrVR0cyJQQ9xwtGcA

124295,2012-07-24,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"With burgers being such a polarizing topic, everyone seems to think they know they best around. So naturally everyone I know constantly recommends another place in town, half of which I dismiss because they just sound awful. Such is the case with Tommy Bahama when a contractor named David I'm working with in town mentioned it. Out of all the places people throw out there, a clothing store has not been one of them and instantly sounded awful. After much persuasion, and perhaps the offer of a free meal, I caved and went with him to check it out. Could a chain known for its clothes also sport a restaurant with a VBB-worthy burger?

The restaurant is located in Town Square which can be a pain to visit at times, but also offers great people watching in the right spots.  And Tommy's definitely has a great patio outside to do just that. The inside of the restaurant looks a lot like their clothing stores with muted colors, decorative ceiling fans and pendant lights with sea shells on them. There's also a decent sized bar which is a quick way to drop in and out for a bite even when they're busy.

I can't speak much to the menu based on my visit as David knew exactly what we were ordering and placed it right away. It is available online though, and has quite a few options. The burger selected for me was the Smokehouse Angus Burger: prime Angus, toasted brioche, roasted garlic aioli, sharp white cheddar, red onion and Nueske's bacon. Upon first bite I noticed instantly that the bun was great, almost challah-like. It was soft on the outside, grilled and crispy on the inside. The top bun had a sweet ketchup spread on it, the bottom had the garlic aioli. Both spreads were minimal and just enough for flavor without being overpowering or messy. The meat had great flavor and was cooked close to my medium-rare that was ordered. The onions were fresh and not overpowering, but I still took some off as to not hijack too much of the overall flavor. The star of this burger by far was the bacon; it was crunchy, thick and had terrific flavor.

The fries weren't awful; they had good flavor and weren't oily or stale as they have often been around town lately. I wished for a bit more, but they didn't detract from the meal as a few have. As a whole I was definitely impressed with this burger, I really wasn't expecting much coming into it and got way more than expected. And although I didn't pay for this meal (thanks David!), I would say that the $13.50 menu price might be a bit steep for this. I don't know if I would include it in my Vegas 'must have' list as this is still a bit of a chain, but if you're in Town Square and looking for a good burger you should definitely stop by.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,0,4,MYz3OmG35sx1EbEkBck4iQ

The bar was pretty empty for a Tuesday at 12:30ish. Julian the bartender was very funny & informative. After a quick peruse of the menu I decided on the HOUSE ROASTED PORK SANDWICH (bbq pulled pork) and I was quoted 10 minutes...let the timer begin!

My order arrived within the time quoted and after a 15 minutes drive to the office my lunch was still piping hot. AND DELISH!!  I've never had a piled high pulled pork as good as this one. I didn't even need to add bbq sauce as the flavor without stood on its own. Totally impressed & well worth the $13.50!

I arrived back at work on time.

The reviews prompted me to give the TB restaurant a try for my bday dinner in Vegas. We were tempted to go to some well known places on the strip but opted for TB, due to time constraints and proximity. Boy oh boy, we were so not disappointed!!!! From the first greeting to the bread to the meal, everything was fabulous. The bread with cinnamon butter was melt in your mouth yummy and the drinks were worth it. My hubs devoured the truffle-thyme salmon, I indulged in the macadamia but crusted snapper served with almond rice & asparagus, and my toddler enjoyed the chicken tenders (they were crunchy and light goodness). The servers were friendly and attentive, as my water glass never went empty. It seemed like she had a magic button on the glass or something. To top it off we even received a birthday dessert on the house!!!!  That was a complete surprise and oh so appreciated. The piña colada cake did not disappoint. It was like a melt in your mouth cake, which my hubs compared to cotton candy. The slice is so enormous that we couldn't even finish it. The linen type napkins were also an added plus along with the breath taking plantation decor & ambiance. Thank you, TB Restaurant for making my bday experience a great one.

Unfortunately after our appetizers we waited almost another 30 minutes before our meal came out. When it did arrive, my steak and potatoes was cold. It was obvious the steak had been sitting in the window- it was sliced, dried out and almost medium well ( I ordered it medium). I have never had cold mashed potatoes at a restaurant before- I was pretty shocked. My fiancés fish was cooked perfectly and was warm, no complaints on his dish. It was more disappointing because the restaurant was not busy. 

When our server came over to collect our dirty dishes she asked if we were ready for her to put our dessert order in which explained why our dinner had come out so long after our appetizers! She didn't even ring our meals in until we were done with our appetizers! Overall our meal took two hours because of poor judgement and timing by our server.

The Mai Tai drinks were phenomenal - not too sweet, the right amount of rums (perfect dark rum float), completely refreshing.

The food was very good.  Hubby had House Roasted Pork Sandwich - a huge helping of pulled pork in a blackberry brandy bbq sauce (so delicious!) on top of fresh crunchy slaw with skinny crispy fried onions piled on a toasted bun.  It was served with some of the best fries around.

I had a cup of the crab bisque, which was very tasty but really thick in consistency.  Too thick for my preference.  The Bungalow Salad, however, was fantastic.

First the crab cakes they were two about 2oz ea.. it was on an asian cole slaw which sat in a pool of sweet chile sauce and olive oil.
          The slaw was good but the sweet chile sauce was way too sweet, the crab cakes were meaty not to much filler and were good.
        The big island goat cheese with mac nuts and a sweet soy sauce glaze was pretty good but did not care for the island bread that came with it , more like a cracker.
          We both ordered the cuban sandwich it came with fried yucca. The sandwich was very good . It was pressed nicely so it had a nice crispness to it. The ham and roast pork was a decent amount. Everything was nicely balanced. The fried yucca was intresting it had a crisp crust and a creamy texture in the middle not much flavor like a potato. I kinda got used to it ,wife did not like it.

922917,2014-05-01,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"We recently celebrated your 25th wedding anniversary at Tommy's in the Town Square. 

Our friends and family come from all over so our guests decided that our celebration would take place in Las Vegas. What better choice than the Marriage Capital of the World. Everything else was easy once the destination was selected. We immediately knew we were going to Tommy Bahamas.

We have been Tommy Bahama fans (both restaurant and retail) for a number of years.  We have always found the food, drinks, atmosphere and service exceptional based on our experiences in Orlando, Palm Springs, Scottsdale, Myrtle Beach and Las Vegas.   

Kaaren provided suggestions or assisted with coordinating a myriad of details including decorations, flowers, live music, menu, beverage and signature drinks, snacks, favours, and ensuring taxi services were available.

Finally our big day arrived.  We renewed our vows in the Bahama Room; adjourned to the Garden Room for champagne and hors d'oeuvres and then returned to the Bahama Room for dining and live music.

We could not have been more pleased with the success of the day.  Our guests attended from Bermuda, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Arizona and Nevada.  All of the guests commented on the wonderful venue and ambience.

We are already planning a return trip to Tommy Bahamas Las Vegas to celebrate our 26th anniversary, but on a much smaller scale. 

We hope to visit, have a Dark and Stormy and enjoy a dining experience at each and every Tommy Bahama restaurant location as part of ""Living The Life"".

Our sincere thanks for a fabulous day.

Till next time,",AvVXXI0DRgZfUFNWU7JWSw,0,0,5,TLyKevd6KNz-pGn9LglRQg

It appears as though they changed up their menu a bit. Ordered the chicken lollipops (I think that's what it was called) for an appetizer and they were good. Wouldn't order again, too sweet for my liking. For my entree I had the kona coffee crusted ribeye. So good! (No taste of coffee whatsoever). Dish came with cauliflower mash and lemon arugula. The flavor was amazing! I recommend it. For dessert, I ordered their pineapple creme brûlée. Very pretty dessert & tasty! Only bad thing about lunch was I wanted a lemonade and the server said they were all out! Smh disappointed but ok...he didn't recommend anything else to drink either.

To start, we ordered 2 pitchers of fall sangria and goat cheese for appetizers. In addition, the chef gave us a lil amuse-bouche of chicken and potatoes as complimentary for visiting for the first time! For entrée, we shared the fish&chips, steak salad, and pork chop special. We couldn't get any desserts because we were full but our server (he was Asian but I cannot remember his name) and manager (I remember her name-- it was Emily) were both super friendly and very accommodating. I remember Emily's name because she gave us a free dessert card to use in NY!

The 1PM show got moved to somewhere around 3PM or 4PM. Throughout the afternoon it was pretty hard to get any accurate info on the exact when and where of anything and where to wait, etc. Not even the band had the info to give us since the restaurant hadn't figured out all the kinks yet. We were all starving and got take out from inside the restaurant. The food was pretty good. We got a variety of items and everything tasted awesome.

I also had the pork sandwich with blackberry brandy barbeque sauce.  It's basically a pulled pork sandwich with onion straws, and it was very good, as were the crispy fries.    The only reason that they didn't get 5 stars was due to the timing of my food.   The sandwich came out before the appetizer, so I had to ask to see if they forgot this item.   A minor issue, since this was ordered at the bar, and I'd expect table servers to be more on their game.

Relaxing, but vibrant. We grabbed a table outside as it was close to the entrance because my Mom can't walk far. Our bullish choice may have been an inconvenient location for the waitstaff. The waitress was friendly and smart but we saw her very infrequently. Not sure, but she may have been a manager picking up slack. She told us what was especially popular on the menu, but we didn't take any of her recommendations. In hindsight, I think she was steering us toward the tastier items on the menu and away from the so-so items. She mentioned that they had fresh baked bread and we told her that would be great, but it never arrived and we didn't remind her. She seemed like she was playing catch-up on those occasions when we did see her. Kindly, she did make change for a dollar as the local parking meters there only take coins and we knew right off the bat they weren't going to be able to serve us our meal within an hour. We got the coconut shrimp appetizer and it was good, but not close to the best in town. Not the largest shrimp either. One of the four was much smaller than the others. The entrees took a long time. My Mom ordered a burger and for her taste, the bun was far too soggy. It was almost wet. She would have liked it to have been toasted. I can't see how that could have been eaten without silverware. We had to ask for salt, pepper and mustard as there wasn't any available on the table. Those items came quickly though. The french fries were kind of airy and relatively free of grease. I ordered the blackberry baby back ribs and they were okay, but nothing I would order twice. It was only a half rack, which was fine, but I think the item cost about $19, which for my experience, normally gets you a full rack. There were a few birds in the area begging for food and the people seated next to us fed them a full roll on the floor near our table.

We were here during happy hour, so we enjoyed several different appetizers and drinks that were on the happy hour menu! The drinks were delicious, and the food was great! My favorite were the blackened fish tacos.

They only honor the happy hour menu in the bar (which there wasn't enough seats for our large group) and on the patio outside. It was a nice evening in Vegas, however it was very windy! We all decided to sit outside because we wanted to take part in happy hour. The large umbrellas they had outside to give us shade were blowing everywhere, and one even fell on my friend causing her drink to spill all over her. It was a little weird because the waiter turned it on us saying that ""they usually don't seat people outside when it's windy, but that they made an exception for us"". Mind you, there were many other parties sitting outside at that point so it wasn't just us. The manager never came out to apologize and even if they made an exception for us, the manager still should have apologized for the incident and made sure my friend was ok. We weren't even asking for a free drink or food, just a sincere apology would have been nice! I wouldn't mind coming back here again because the food was great, but I will definitely keep the experience I had in mind next time.",mu4XvWvJOb3XpG1C_CHCWA,3,3,3,yNy9_pDDhnUqtF6oSf2vCA

1488544,2017-06-23,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Overall, pretty good experience. Food was a little too sweet or salty for my taste but good nonetheless. 

I tried their prix fixe menu for Restaurant Week and got the Mahi mahi. It was a little too sweet for me - too much vinaigrette type sauce... added some lemon and it was good to go. I tried my friend's filet mignon and that was definitely good.

The peanut butter pie was like a giant reese's peanut butter cup. It was good for the first few bites but definitely too much for a full dessert. 

The service was a bit slow and probably was due to the dinner rush. I don't know if it'd be a good place to come when you're super hungry. Seating was ample though. 

Definitely worth another visit.

* update *
Just returned for a second run of their Restaurant Week deal. What I said before stands. Food tends to run a little sweet and salty. The chicken lollipop was good BUT REALLLLLY sweet/overpowered by the sauce. The filet mignon was well seasoned, but a little on the salty side. 

The food is pretty solid... and you can't really go wrong. The service this time was superb and on point. Overall win in my book.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,1,1,4,DU1db_DcvtOF-Y475buuHg

The wait staff is generally friendly and the food displaying a good spectrum of flavor. For Date Night, my wife decided to hit them up. The restaurant was dead as it was happy hour so what business there was had migrated to the Bar area with the live (but mellow) music. The Happy Hour menu is discounted, in some cases by five or six bucks, but pretty limited and with the appetizers being very scaled down versions (getting what you pay for).  Luckily, the few drinks offered are still very good. Try the ""Crazy Cuban"" and the ""Coconut Cloud"" for a sweet, boozy flavor profile! The portion sizes still waver between high-end snooty and fairly worth it though the food itself is hardly lacking. Though they no longer carry ""Blackbeard's pudding"", the dessert offerings are still quite delicious.

If you like sandwiches, the cuban sandwich is very rich and tasty.  I also recommend the Grilled bbq spare ribs.  Decadent.  Chicken Tortilla soup is also very tasty

If you are looking to lose or maintain weight, they have a pretty decent salad selection.  Ahi tuna with Kale and mushrooms is pretty solid.  So is the grilled chicken salad.

I'll admit that walking in the place, I was a little dubious.  The restaurant houses one side of the building and the other side of the building sells tacky J. Crew-style Caribbean clothing.  Doesn't really sound like the best place to find a meal.  But after a few dishes, I was won over.  

The tortilla soup was a huge winner with bright, fresh flavors and a nice spice.  Not over-the-top spiciness, but just enough to bring out the chicken and tomato flavors.

Coconut shrimp came across as fairly standard.  Not a real stand out dish, but I was impressed with the freshness of the shrimp.  

Also had the Jerk Chicken.  To put it simply, it was perfectly cooked, tender, and nice balance of sweet and tangy.

They immediately brought my kiddo a kids menu with crayons and a working high chair! Our server Pascha was very friendly. We both ordered drinks from the bar and then looked over the menu. We chose this spot because they had two lunch menus, a $20 and a $30 with 3 courses; appetizer, soup/salad, and entree.

I went with the $20 menu and got the grilled artichoke, caesar salad and cuban sandwich. I had a hard time choosing between the sandwich or the tacos so I asked Pascha to surprise me. I really thought he would bring the tacos, especially since I over heard him tell another table they are a best selling item, but whatever. The grilled artichoke was delicious. It was grilled and had garlic butter and parmesan cheese on it, and it came with a yummy lemon tarragon aioli dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again. The salad was your typical ceasar salad, except instead of chopped lettuce it was lettuce leafs. The Cuban sandwich was okay, but really I think I would have preferred the tacos. It came with their island coleslaw and jerk yucca fries which were spicy! To drink I had the Kona Brewing Hula Hefewiezen which was yummy. Tasted a bit like Blue Moon but not as fruity. We also were brought warm bread and honey butter with our meals.

Finally it was time for desert. This was not included with the restaurant week special but it was $5 and I can't ever pass up dessert. I chose the pb pie and it was delicious! The crust was salted pretzel - yum. The pie tasted like a salty peanut butter cup. 

I have to mention I ordered my son the $7 chicken fingers with fruit and asked for ranch instead of honey mustard and the waiter said they don't have ranch. What?!!? I've never heard of such a thing. So fellow ranch lovers, take note! The chicken fingers were crispy and yummy and came with a side of fresh fruit. The boy was very happy as he gobbled most of it up.

He had very specific parameters within which to work: 1) the restaurant had to be close to UNLV because I had to get back that night for a rehearsal, 2) the restaurant had to have good yelp reviews!, and 3) the restaurant HAD to have chocolate cake on the dessert menu (because I like cake and because it's my birthday!).  He found Tommy Bahama's, made a reservation just in case, and picked me up at the uni.  

What a lovely dinner!  The food was FANTASTIC.  Service was almost flawless; waitstaff forgot to bring our grilled artichoke appetizer before our main dishes.....BUT they comped the appetizer to make up for that oversight and gave me 3 free desserts because it was my birthday!  

Our dinner began with the bread basket and honey/cinnamon/garlic butter.  Warm, soft, crusty bread with sweet butter.  What's not to like?  The grilled artichoke was decadent and delicious.  For our mains, we both ordered fish: I had the the seared ahi tuna (YUM) and hubby had the black cod (again, YUM).  Portions were not huge; rather, they were ""normal"" sized and allowed us the stomach space to have a multi-course meal.  Desserts were perfect.  The chocolate cake was rich and velvety and indulgent, the key lime pie featured fabulous bright flavours that contrasted with the graham crust, and the pina colada cake was just plain good.  The waitstaff even sang ""Happy Birthday"" to me whilst bringing out my desserts.  How cute!

The perfect weather did make such the difference. We had a table for 5 outside and it was perfect! The drink and menu options are great!  A small menu but a very good mix if things.

First round of drinks I had the sangria which the flower in it just gave it that little extra something to make you feel like you were on a tropical island somewhere...it's the little things!  2nd round was the basil martini which was delicious.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  I would have had more if I wasn't driving :)

Food was really good! My favorite was the macadamia goat cheese! Fish tacos and plantain chips were yummy too. I plan to go back and get the poke and the sliders, which others in my party said the sliders were really good, I was just too full! But always have room for dessert and when they brought out the dessert tray, had to try the creme brûlée in the pineapple.  Not only was it pretty and tropical looking but was amazing!  Never had that mix, glad we did and will definitely get it again!  We scraped the bottom!

I wouldn't have minded sitting inside because the guitar player Justin is amazing! I didn't realize he played there but saw him one day when I was passing through the restaurant.  He happen to be the musician I got to play at my sisters wedding. I saw him at a friends wedding and had to book him.  So glad I know where I can catch him play!

Our waiter was really sweet - we got several wait staff helping us throughout our meal, actually. Some things took awhile like our waters and my coffee but overall, I liked our experience.

My friend had ordered an appie and a main and I knew that would be a lot for me for lunch but what the hell - I also got the blackened fish tacos. They were good - of course they do not compare to say, some you would get in Hawaii but they were quite tasty. I could only eat 1 out of 3 of them. Also on the side of the plate in addition to a lime, you get a little pineapple yogurt type dessert in a taco shell with beautifully fried plantains on top. OMG, I left full and of course I took my tacos with me!
My friend loved her lobster bisque as well as her chicken tacos and she too had a to-go bag!
My one comment would be that we had asked for all the dishes to come at one time but my soup came first and nothing else. Not even my friend's soup came so I felt a bit bad eating alone for a bit. But we said nothing and tipped very well.

We are big, BIG Tommy Bahama fans.  We have a house on Maui with lots of Tommy barware.  My husband owns tons of Tommy's Hawaiian shirts.  We were really looking forward to eating here after standing in line for an iPhone 3G for three hours.  (At least we finally got one.)  

We were seated promptly and taken our drink orders with dispatch.  That was almost the last we saw of our waiter without tripping him (and even that didn't always work).  We got water.  We were told there was no bread yet.  For appetizers I had the crab soup (OK, but not memorable) and my husband had the coconut crusted crab cakes (terrific, terrific Asian slaw with them).  Eventually we got bread, but it was so sweet (and so was the non-butter spread) that neither of us had more than a bite.  Does sweet bread make up for the bitter drinks?  The bar was backed up, so we had finished our appetizers before we got our drinks.  Maybe their Mai Tai mix had fermented.  Whatever, it was pretty ghastly and I didn't even finish it.  My husband had the Pelican Punch (Fruit Punch with not enough rum to speak of).  

My husband's main course was the Seared Ahi Salad (too much wasibi sauce on it for me) and I had the Chicken Salad Junkanoo.  What kitchen of any quality would send out a mess like this?  Consider some underripe grapes and unsweet orange slices surrounding a thick slice of toasted wonder bread (supposed to be Sourdough) with a couple of table spoons of watery chicken salad on top.  No wonder they had bread underneath the salad!  Something needed to act like a sponge for the dripping greens.  There was even an unappetizing piece of chicken skin in the salad.  My husband did want to try the Pina Colada cake that he saw on the dessert tray on the way inside, but after two tries to get more water (he got ice, no water), we paid in cash and escaped.  I don't think Tommy had this in mind for ""making your escape"".  Maybe other instances of this chain are better, but this was a disaster.",M1CwX0U13SHlSBeHd5DSkw,0,1,1,ZUdGWvROtsGn2Aga_jOXhQ

My experience was not all that enjoyable; while nothing was horrible, nothing was great either. We went at about 6:30PM on a Friday night and to our surprise, there was no wait. The hostess took her time and was in no rush to seat us - but she was nice. Once seated, the waiter had the same 'no rush' attitude and took his time greeting us.

We finally placed our order (I ordered the Cuban Sandwich w/ fries and my girlfriend ordered the Gluten-Free scallops). I was very surprised at the low-price of the scallops and couldn't wrap my head around the reasoning - until they arrived. First of all, the food was delicious. The portion size of the scallop dish was very small (2 scallops on some sort of salad). 

Our waiter spent very little time on us and it was very hard to get anything - and once the group of women arrived at the table next to us: that's all she wrote.

For drinks my friend got a Grapefruit Basil Martini and I chose the Coconut Cloud Martini.  We shared the duo of chips.  I thought they came with plantain chips but they were just regular tortilla.  I ordered the HH fish tacos and my friend ordered the HH ahi poke and HH pork belly sliders.  We were happy with our food and service was sufficient.  This isn't my favorite happy hour in Town Square but a solid choice especially on a weekend where happy hours are limited.",XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ,3,3,4,MP47UIzEv7LnzrGOhkN7XA

At any rate we were there for a private bday dinner for my mother in law and I have to say  that they made her day. The service was attentive, the food was actually good, and the sangrias were delic (maybe that's why the food tasted so good??). They also let her bring her own bottles of wine for the 30+guests there and had a wonderful huge coconut cake with candles for dessert. She was beaming the entire night and we all had a great time.

Semi quiet setting with dimmed lighting with a single candle lit on your dining table. This is definitely the opposite of say, Yard House on the opposite side of this restaurant.

Besides their regular menu, they got a small selection of daily specials too. We started off with a small cup of crab bisque. That was on the daily special. If I wasn't so body conscious, I would have ordered a bigger bowl!!! O_O lol! This was delicious! Very flavorful and creamy. Perfect for a cool, autumn evening. 

For entrees, my boyfriend got the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus) and I got the Crab Stuffed Shrimp (with Sautéed Spinach, Almond Rice, Thai Chili Sauce). See pics attached. We both enjoyed our dish a lot and would order this again. Good portion controls too.

We finished with the Sanibel chicken, short rib dish and the blackened fish tacos. Each dish had a world of flavors and I would order each again and that's not the alcohol talking.

Grilled fish tacos and macadamia goat cheese were great, ahi poke and pulled pork quesadilla ok. I had a Mai Tai and a margy. Mai Tai was far too sweet, and the margarita just the opposite, far too tart. Next time I might stick to beer.

The decor is interesting, reminding me of a repurposed Ralph Lauren with monkey murals. It was very comfortable but I didn't get the island time feeling. For that I guess I'll go to Frankie's Tiki Room.",KvdIMR884kQmkzFSvNZjBg,0,0,4,aa4hBTV2e5Ceu4D53-QijA

2729723,2016-04-16,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Okay so I'm a pretty big rum guy and well after finding out that almost no place in Vegas stocks Kraken Black Rum I was on the lookout for a cool hangout but not a bar that did. Well i found this place online listed as one of the best places to hang out, eat, shop, and get your rum fix of course!!!! So Tommy Bahama boasts a whopping selection of over 200 rums from all over the world and even has 2 bottles that are the only known bottles in existence so when they're gone they're gone.  I came in during happy hour (which is the best time to come by the way) to grab a nice Kraken and Coke and a bite to eat.  The place was pretty much empty save for a couple of groups of people so it was pretty quiet for the most part. The lady working the bar was immensely sweet and beautiful and she showed me the happy hour menu and gave me a few tips on how to save some money while eating.  
   I had both the burger sliders and the pork quesadilla and both were amazingly good. The burger sliders were a tad small but they were well cooked and flavorful.  The only issue with the sliders was the price differentiation from the quesadilla. The sliders were 7 dollars and you got less food while the quesadilla is 6 bucks. The pork quesadilla was recommended by the bartender and boy was I glad I took her advice. The quesadilla was  really well made and a pretty big meal considering it's very reasonable price (6 bucks like I said!). The quesadilla is served with a nice heaping side of mango salsa and is topped with goat cheese and beautifully cooked pork.  The happy hour was a highlight and I honestly will be coming back for the food and whenever I really crave some good rum. A word of advice though for any rum fans. So because they have over 200 different selections of rum, prices will vary depending on what you get. Cheaper rums (Captain Morgan, Bacardi, Sailor Jerry, etc) are right behind her on ground level while the really expensive stuff is above her with the whiskeys.  My Kraken Black Rum and Coke ended up costing 8 dollars which honestly wasn't bad at all and was pretty reasonable since it didn't tie into the Happy Hour. The only real con about the whole experience but not enough to deduct a star was the Happy Hour drink selection. Happy Hour really only covers a few wine selections, some rum concoctions, and really basic island drinks like a Mai Tai or Margarita. 
   All in all I really enjoyed my experience and the prices were not that bad. To show you how reasonable the prices were i'm a full time college student who is almost always broke due to tuition and I was able to eat at Tommy Bahamas lol. I was a bit afraid of the price because of the Town Square location but Tommy Bahamas offers really good food and drinks at a very reasonable price!  I definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes island style restaurants without the touristy feel that some of them have and also to people who want good food without the strip prices. This was a great experience and I will certainly be coming back.",S9dDf0JqSMAvusp5f-9bGw,0,0,5,AZiGfelX-LKwtCkOMPNRvg

Our server, Carrie M., was great and she gave extra attention to the dietary restrictions of our table mates.
The food was ok. The scallop sliders had too much bun for the thin scallops and the ""chips"" in the Fish and Chips we're loaded with pepper, effectively killing any flavor.

And I'm so glad we went on this culinary adventure. I can not seriously think of a single complaint about my dining experience here... except that it might be a little pricey, but I definitely didn't mind as soon as I took a bite of the food!

Crab Bisque soup- Bring me a whole bucket of this soup because it is CRAZY good!! Super rich in flavor with lumps of crab- just the perfect way to start the meal. It was worth the $1.50 upgrade to get it.

Salmon salad- salmon crusted in panko on a salad with mango salsa all tied together with a Hoisin vinaigrette. WOW! This salad was light and refreshing. The vinaigrette was just perfect to balance the sweetness of the mangoes. And the salmon was so juicy and tender with the perfect crunch from the panko crust. It's seriously the perfect lunch dish!

Service:  5/5 stars.  Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the food runner was on point, professional and efficient.  You can tell that the company cares about quality service and hires and trains the right kind of people to work here.

Food: 4/5 stars.  Don't let that reduction of one star discourage you.  That's reserved for knock your socks off kind of quality. This place is damn near close.  I had the crab bisque as I always do if it's on the menu.  The bisque was very tasty and was paired well with their fresh baked loaf of bread.  I'd prefer a little more ""meat"" in there just to make me feel better about the purchase; otherwise it was really good.  My main entree was the blackened fish tacos.  High quality white fish spread amongst three heaping tacos.  The meal was delicious once I scraped off the majority of the lime sour cream which the chef was a little over zealous with.

LOVE, LOVE their coconut shrimp.  Not bready at all.  Big juicy shrimp, butterflyed and coated with coconut shreds... lightly fried ....NOT greasy at all.

They have a number of grea fish entrees so if you would like a nice fish dinner... head here.  (However, it's NOT cheap... so plan on paying a few bucks.)

Ambiance is tropically but not ""beachy""... it feels like a nice resort.
They do have patio seating so if it's nice outside definitely try to get an outside seat so you can people watch.

Also, if you are looking for a place to host a party like birthday, retirement, baby shower, bridal shower, etc.... ask about their back room.  It's behind the bar and totally private.  TB does a really nice job with private parties so I recommend it.  (Just attended a baby shower there and it was beautiful!)

Desserts.... ALL of their desserts are decadent.  I particularly like their coconut-pineapple cake.... light and heavenly ...  am hoping it doesn't stay on the hips too long.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,0,4,_NGuoaOcKv8S4_WXn6mtLA

I love the openness of the place and the decor is so light and airy. I almost felt like I was somewhere tropical.

A separate bar area to keep those rowdy sports fans under control. :) The patio would be an awesome place to dine during pleasant weather. Service was friendly and attentive. I felt like our server Brandon was really happy helping us with our meal. I even got a candle in my pineapple creme brûlée which was nice.

We walked in and the place reeked of pineapples, more than likely to set that tropical mood.  FYI: islands don't smell like pineapples, but whatever.

We were seated in a booth, which was nice, and our server took our drink orders right away.  We threw in some appetizers and 10 minutes went by before they come out luke warm.  The plantain chips, which I expected to be fresh from the fryer, were ice cold.  Oh well.

The food itself took 20 minutes to come out, which is way too long, even with refills of the bread basket.  By the time the food came out, I was full, but I tried it anyway.  The cuban is good, not great, and the other items my friends' bought: pork sandwich and jerk chicken were disgusting.  I don't eat things that look as if someone chewed it up and spat it out.  Presentation wasn't there, but it's not a 5 star restaurant.  All I ask for is good food, and the stuff they use in their sandwiches for the pork's bbq sauce and the jerk seasoning was too sweet and tasted very commercial.  Not for me, or them.

Overall, nice place to spend 12-15 bucks on a sandwich, but not worth the price tag.  I'll never eat here again, no matter how decent the appetizers were.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,2,olJsk_V6PWMkSxcHuSV8ig

LIFE IS ONE LONG WEEKEND

**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #1**

The way to start a new year is by thinking of how you ended the year before.

I will start off by saying that I can FINALLY write a review for this darn restaurant now that I no longer am employeed by them. I have dedicated 5 years of my youth to this place & it has been the most AWSOME years of friendship w/ co-workers along w/ life long regulars who have become my friends. 

The atmosphere for this place is very mellow & relaxing. They have live performers from Tuesday- Saturday during dinner time. You get the whole Caribbean vibe starting from the bamboo host stand to the sea shell ceiling lamps. BEST time to go eat & really enjoy your RELAXATION time is during the spring when all the SLIDING doors open up & make you feel like you are dining outdoors whether you sit inside or outside.

FOOD is always the best of quality & if not the best to your standards... they do their very BEST to make you HAPPY even if they know you are wrong... they want to make your experience the best they can. I guess that is the power of a CORPORATION. The MONTHLY SPECIALS are seriously a HIGH recommendation as they are created by the ACTUAL executives chefs on site & not by the corporate Chef Don Donly ( don't get me wrong... he busts out some awesome dishes) but the point is that the menu will ALWAYS be there but the specials will never be seen again typically. 

The service is great, each individual server has their own style of serving but they all do the basics. So if one server isn't your fit, then just nicely ask for a different style of server. I BELIEVE this is kind of true throughout the restaurant industry but if you want fast cocktails.... eat at the bar.... if you want to wine & dine & have someone manage your meal for you so you don't have to think much after a hard day's work... then sit in the dining area. 

ALL in ALL this place is like your second kitchen. Fresh food so you can take leftovers & reheat it & it still tastes good. You can pretty much eat this place everyday & probably not get sick of it since I did it for 5 years.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,6,6,5,ITHe9Tx-Ph4iXrhpftK1Nw
3212165,2012-07-02,10,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"OUTSTANDING VEGGIE BURGER. They make them fresh daily. Packed with beans, rice, corn and spices. It was so delicious I had to write a review ASAP. I think it was $12.99 and included a side of fruit and either a simple salad or cup of soup. Not cheap, but worth every dollar. Everyone knows how hard it is to find a decent veggie burger that's not just a frozen patty.

The service was meh. He redeemed himself towards the end, but gosh it was awkward when our server took our food orders and then messed up the drinks. Maybe he had a hangover or a hemorrhoid flare-up. Got me. 

FYI- If you carry a purse bring a purse hook. The chairs are rounded at the top so you cannot hang your purse. Regretfully I had to put my nice purse on the ground because I didn't want to eat with it on my lap. This was annoying. 

FYI Take Two- Be careful of the palm tree outside the door. I swear it jumped out and stabbed my boob when no one was looking. Glad it wasn't my eye, but still not the kind of physical relationship I want to have with a palm tree. Like ever.

3219301,2018-05-04,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Saw a sign last time we were in advertising a ""Chef's Table"" night, so we decided to try it out this week.  First the servers, and chefs were awesome!   
   Food wise,
       We started with a Scallop Appetizer with lobster succotash, Corn, and edible flowers.  This was insanely good, and really really beautiful.  I would order this if it was on the menu. 
       Next course was a Crab and Shrimp Salad with citrus sesame dressing.  This had tomatoes, avocados, shaved asparagus, and HONEYDEW.   I actually thought it was apples instead, But either way, EVERYTHING on this dish played an amazing part.  The sesame was perfect, the creamy avocados, the shrimp cooked just right and the right size, and the honeydew added a perfect sweet bite to balance it all.  It was amazing.
    Entre Course was a Filet Oscar.  This was my least favorite item.  The quality of the filet seemed lower quality, and mine was overcooked.  My wife's was cooked better, and she enjoyed it slightly more.  I have had better Demi Glaze. and Bearnaise. 
    Dessert.  This was not great.  There was pineapple that was too hard to cut without a knife(and we didn't have knives for this course). and the tarts were overcooked(Hard) and not real flavorful.  I am guessing that none of the chefs focus on pastry.  I would recommend instead of doing 4 items mediocre, to focus on one GREAT tart, maybe a chocolate tart with raspberry sauce and some fresh quality RUM macerated fruit(Sticking with the theme!).  But just do this one item perfect!  Especially since you leave people with this last taste, it needs to shine as good, if not better than the rest of the meal.

Food-wise, My Biggest criticism is that every bite of crab I had all night, which was on the first 3 items, had shell in it, and the steak being lower quality meat.  I personally would have been happier to pay $20 more and had slightly higher quality ingredients for these few items.

Drinks- First, they start you with a Rum Drink that was awesome.. even if you don't buy any drink pairings, this is included in your meal and was really great.  Then they pair either wine or Rum drinks to your meal.  I got Rum and it was well worth it.  I liked some, didn't like other, but it was matched well and I enjoyed that aspect of the meal.

Value-I felt this meal was excellent value.  I do think I'd pay more for slightly better, but understand why some people would be turned off to pay more, so I understand there is a marketing spin there. 

Then I leave it with the people.  We met some great people and had some excellent conversation all night and till we essentially got booted out, but it was the cherry on top.  Really enjoyed our time and cannot wait to do it again!",pBhaCEcdbdDv76kMwm8Nng,4,1,5,xIn1ZK_YQEu3FCunQxta9A

3248205,2011-04-03,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Tommy Bahama at Town Square provided us with a really surprising and fun dining experience.

We were looking for somewhere new to eat and decided to give this place a try. The giant billboard featuring a mouth-watering slice of key lime pie had been calling me for well over a year now, so tonight was the night to finally make the short drive to Town Square.

Upon arrival at the restaurant I was immediately struck by how friendly the staff were. I didn't get the name of the girl who greeted us, but she was extremely welcoming and let us know that our server, appropriately named ""Tommy"", was excellent. She was certainly right. Tommy was friendly, sharp, congenial, accommodating - everything you want from a waiter. He gave us lots of good advice and engaged us in conversation about the food, ranging from the bread with honey-cinnamon butter, to the excellent lemonade we ordered. He really seemed to have a passion for the menu items and did a great job of at least appearing to delight in our enjoyment of them.

I ordered the Sanibel Stuffed Chicken and my wife got the Antigua Quesadillas appetizer and a variety of sides to share with me. We both loved our food and were particularly taken by one of the sides, the enormous basket of plantain chips, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and served with a black bean, charred corn salsa with lime sour cream.

Around halfway through our meal the idea of eating the key lime pie that had lured us there in the first place began to look like a bit of a pipe dream - but we were so happy we decided, what the heck. Two slices to go.

Overall our experience here was wonderful, particularly helped by the pleasant outdoor dining section and the lovely early April weather. My only minor criticism of the place is the lack of any real vegetarian ""main"" option for my wife. She was more than happy with what she had, but a little variety would call us back all the more often. That tiny gripe aside, Tommy Bahama was the complete dining experience for me and everything that is good about a meal out. We will be back.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,1,1,5,lTz38ERFo3l_0abgAVEGJA

Sure, it's kind of cheesy and it's attached to the Tommy Bahama store which has stuff I'd never wear (at least not for the next 25 years). But, I've been here a couple times now and everything I've tried has been tasty. 

During my last visit we got the scallop sliders ($11.50). There were 2 scallops in each slider, with a good bit of spice from the chipotle aioli. They've not your typical slider, but tasty nonetheless.

The Saba steak salad ($17.50) was also delicious. Plenty of tender, well seasoned steak over a salad large enough for two. It also had some grilled slices of potatoes, tomatoes, and a tamarind vinaigrette.

They also have a kids menu. My son is so predictable. He always goes for the chicken tenders. They're lightly breaded and the skinny fries are excellent

With drinks it came out to about $60. Yeah, a little pricey for lunch. From what I hear they have one of the biggest collections of rum around. So, if that's your vice stop by to check it out.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,4,4,BF2g8rcd8rG7lKqdy2xzXA

The bar was super crowded and it's easy to see why. We tried a few appetizers such as their ahi poke, chimichurri sliders, calamari noodles and fish tacos. Everything was delicious! My favorites were the sliders and fish tacos. Portions are rather small - the ahi poke was like amuse bouche - but the quality of the food made up for it.

Man..their main courses are of wwwaaayyy better quality than their happy hour. Now, I'm a big fan of Brio's happy hour so when participating on a happy hour I expect the same quality. 

I ordered the blackened fish tacos for $6.00 and a slice of my faovrite Pina Colada cake for $6.00. Not only was the fish dry, but the size of the fish in the taco was about the size of my pinky finger. The seasoning was of a likeable taste, but it was drowning under a big mound of coleslaw. Definitely not a happy hour item I would recommend.

The macadamia nut goat cheese for $5.00 was pretty good. It is a small portion (like a small scoop portion) garnished with a sweet mango salsa. It was had a nice sweet flavor with a good macadamia crunch! 

I also tried the lobster bisque which was good too. A good cream density with a great sweet bisque flavor. It had very subtle pieces of lobster in their, but it was still a good eat! 

The desserts as usual are on point! As always I chose the Pina Colada cake which is my favorite cake of all time. It never fails. However, I did come across a new infatuation with the pineapple creme bruelee. So sue me for being super overly excited that it's serve in a pineapple dish! Don't start worrying that maybe with the nice presentation that they may hold out on the pineapple chunks. The creme brulee has two layers of pineapple in it, and then the actual brulee on top of it. Oh it was such a good combination. Who knew that pineapple and creme brulee would taste so good!

If the happy hour doesn't improve in quality, I do hope they bring back their 3 course menu special. (Hint. Hint. Tommy!)",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,1,3,uNIVGzBRSreEbJBsr4nLAg

I would have eaten the entire thing if I didn't need to lose a few pounds! :) The Jerk Yucca Fries on the side were just Yuck-A, in my opinion. Definitely an acquired taste, so I gladly gave them to a friend I was having lunch with and she enjoyed them. Let's not waste!

This would be a three star review if not for the outstanding service we received.  This was an afterthought when I was looking at the RW offerings.  I decided it was wife friendly (it's difficult to get her to try different things).  

We came here in the late afternoon.  I had checked the times online and the Tommy Bahama website said dinner was from 4 on.   We were there at 4:30 and got the lunch RW menu and were told that dinner service begins at 5 PM.  That's where our server, Naomi, showed us what the service would be like.  She went to the kitchen and then came back.  After collecting our lunch menus, she went to the stand and brought back the dinner menus.

I started with the coconut shrimp with an Asian slaw.  The shrimp were resting on a mango-papaya chutney.  My wife had the classic Caesar--romaine leaves with Grana Padano cheese and garlic croutons.  Both were good starters.  My shrimp  had little coconut flavor.

During our starters, Naomi brought some hot bread from the kitchen.  They serve the bread with a cinnamon butter which is quite good.  I thought it was odd that they had no bread plates.  I happened to have my starter plater so I could use that.

For the main courses, I got the pork loin and my wife got the parmesan crusted Sanibel chicken breast--a selection not shown on their online RW menu but a good choice.  Naomi asked how I liked the pork--medium and I said rare to medium-rare.  I didn't want the meat too dead.  It was cooked too much and it wasn't a bit juicy.  It was a huge loin--almost like they took a loin and cut it in half.  It was served with asparagus and 6 silver dollar size sweet potato pancakes.  The sides were very good!  My wife's chicken was good.  Her chicken came on a bed of garlic mashed and some broccolini.  

For dessert, I got the piña colada cake and my wife got the four layer triple chocolate cake.  Excellent and once again, a large portion.

Iced tea was refilled promptly without asking.  Naomi was always around without being intrusive and she had a sparkling personality!  She makes this a 4 star review.

""Sure.. wait what??""

Yea, Tommy Bahama's is not just a clothing store, they serve Hawaiian type food.  My friend ordered stuff to go for us since she had a visitor at her house:

Loki-Loki Tuna Poke: Tuna w/ capers soy and sesame oil served with guacamole and 6 strips of chips.  It was ok.  Good filler but not worth $16.50. 

Little Cayman Lollipops: 6 drumettes grilled, smoked with a mango BBQ sauce glazed. Comes with a dipping sauce, but i had no idea what it was.  Very tasty treats.  My tongue was very please to meet these bad boys, but for $9.50 per an order.. Eek! 

Saba Steak Salad: Marinated, char-grilled tenderloin medallions, grilled potatoes, roman tomatoes, shiitake chips, garlic aioli & tamarind vinaigrette.  Steak was really tender and satisfying.  The vinaigrette was quite addicting too.

My buddy ate two salad, Tahitian Tuna Salad ($17.50 )and I think the St. Croix Salad ($16.50).  It still amazed me how much this tiny girl can eat.  She was pretty quiet the whole time munching on her greens, so i guess that's a good thing. 

Overall I was very astonished that the food came out positive for the most part, but it's just a little controversial since the price was a bit steep.  Service was wonderful though.  We ordered to go from the bartender and she was very easy going and helpful.

She was right on. It was delicious. She then proceeded to tell us about their mind blowing Happy Hour and all the different appetizers they offered.

Located in Town Square, this Business is one of those two tone or two ideas rolled into one. Retail and Restaurant rolled into one symbiotic relationship.

I'll start by saying Australia does have Tommy Bahamas, but to tell the truth you would never really know they were there. Most are located in very high volume tourist areas that locals never swing by. So my general experiences have been from this location.

Strolling through the retail section I would say that maybe some of the gear isn't in my age bracket just yet. That's not to say older fashion beach and boating wear isn't cool. ""Bow ties are cool"" so who am I to judge.

Now for the few happy hours that I been to here. Id like to say I was impressed with the menu and range they had. Sitting out on the patio we grabbed the sliders, seafood tacos
And a Mai Tai.

All were great, the sliders had a great tasting  bun which I was informed was Hawaiian bread. The tacos had a slight spice kick to them with half decent Mai tai that to be honest didn't really hit the mark.

The service wasn't too bad, seating and the server both were prompt delivering dishes and clearing tables with smile. High chairs and a kids menu are also provided but the menu is full of deep fried stuff which I'm not a huge fan of..

Drinks: 2-5
Food: 3-5

-Kobe burger: sautéed mushrooms, garlic aioli, grilled onions on a brioche bun and yummy skinny fries on the side.

-Blackened fish tacos (3  to an order): basa fish, chipotle aioli, shredded lettuce, cilantro & pico de gallo. Came with a side of fried plantains in a creamy coconut sauce.

WOWWEEE!!! So we always share dishes when we go eat and we weren't short of impressed or felt jipped by the fairly expensive dishes we ordered. The tacos were a prefect blend of tanginess & juiciness. The white flakey fish was amazing & aioli and pico de gallo, refreshing.

I've been to Tommy's for dinner before which I thought was good, but pricey. Anyhow, back to the bar.

We decided to stop by for HH, the bar was packed. We decided to come back after walking around. We were just in luck, there were 2 seats open at the bar. The bar was clearing out as HH had just ended, but we didn't mind, because I JUST had to try this martini. We sat there for about 10 minutes and finally a bartender came up to us and we asked for their drink menu. As I had stated before the bar was emptying out and by that time the bar was only half full. There were seats next to us that were now empty. One guy came and sat in the seat next to us. The bartender gave him a drink menu right away. Another 10 minutes passed and no one has come by and asked if we liked to order anything. (It didn't seem like they were too busy as the bartenders were chatting with people and to each other).

4352956,2017-06-29,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"I decided to swing by Tommy Bahamas for restaurant week because the menu they had looked promising. We picked the 30 dollar option and from it we both got the crab bisque and coconut shrimp,  then differed on the entree where I got the ribs and he got the fish and chips. For dessert I added on the key lime pie. 

I was surprised how fast service was,  after each course they soon brought over the next,  and our waitress was super attentive.   I was happy to see they carried beer from kona  brewing company.   I appreciate the unique floral notes it tends to posses,  but I I was unsure which one I wanted.  She brought me samples of the two I was contemplating so I could easily decide. 

So down to the food.   The crab bisque was creamy, flavorful,  and had nice pieces of crab inside.  It went great with the heavenly bread they supply the table.  So hot and buttery mmmm  I'm having a moment just thinking about it. 

The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and coated, golden and juicy on a mango dipping sauce,  with a savory jicima slaw. The best coconut shrimp I have ever had.  

The ribs were where they lost me a bit.   They had this blackberry sauce which was OK,  but the ribs had to many dry hard areas.  It had the same great jicima slaw, which seems to be a common side with many items,  and the cauliflower mash was great.  However, since the star of the dish was the ribs it failed to continue the joyful momentum I had started to feel from the former dishes. 

My boyfriend got the fish and chips and the spin on the dish was the chips were made of yucca instead of potatoes.  The fish was battered well, not the best fish and chips I have ever had, but solid still.  It also had the jicima slaw, which they call island slaw actually. 

After all this food I was exploding so I asked them to switch my pie, which for restaurant week was only a 5 dollar addition, to a to go order. It ended up being delicious.  Great tart to sweet ratio,  solid crust, and lovely whipped topping. 

This was the first time besides happy hour I had dined at this establishment,  and over all I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner again...especially for those shrimp.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,2,0,4,FlGAKx2DZ2enSOY6Si6ILw

Doug came out with a whole tray of their desserts they have available and believe me there was no way you could say no! Everything on that tray looked fresh and delicious!

The fries are top notch also. My big mistake was eating too much bread at the beginning of the meal. By coincidence, we stumbled upon a side of fried plantains that was divine. Similarly to the Brazilian steak houses, the plantains is cleansing to the palate but also delicious as a desert.

Regardless....the clothing line is by all means for individuals well into the 40s+.  Although it's the not the clothing line I am reviewing, but felt it was necessary to share.  

From Scottsdale to Maui and now my experience in Las Vegas, I have to say it is a chain that has yet to disappoint.  The service has always been top notch,  the food is fantastic and the prices are on the edge of being overpriced, but the price point works for me.  

Portion sizes are usually enough to share so getting a couple apps, an entree which allows drinking during and dessert at the end has been the way I usually do it.  Do not think they are oversized because they are not.  Each entree is sized to be filling....I'm just saying that the appetizers are too good to not order more than one.  Which ones do I recommend?  All of them....seriously.  

We were on the patio at night and wasn't crazy about the in ground spot lights that was kind of blinding at times....nice for ambiance, but wasn't a fan at my table.

4436353,2017-05-02,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Went here for lunch and I must say that place is nothing more than a glorified Chilis that specilaizes in fusion American/Hawaiian food. Mainly it taste like any other average American restaurant that happens to have Ahi tuna in a large number of their dishes. Despite my own inclination not to go with the special for lunch, I decided to go against my gut and get the ""Tuna Melt"" for lunch. I mean who doesn't want beer-battered avocado slices in their sandwich? Before any of you get on me, if you saw the menu, you'd see for yourself for the lack of eye catching items minus the fish tacos. Anyways, the food gets there and it looks like sandwich that came from Denny's. I must have not payed attention because the sandwich also came with two slices of thick bacon. Never have been a real fan of bacon and I have noticed in my foodie experience that places generally add bacon to dishes that lack any real flavor. Surprise, surprise: the sandwich tasted like nothing. The tuna was very fishy and was obviously not the freshest cut of fish available. It tasted like a very fishy chicken salad sandwich and also looked like one. If you are a huge fan of the aforementioned, you'd be in love. However, if the thought of a chicken salad sandwich ellicits a emesis response from your dopamine receptors like mine, then you will hate it. Fries...how can you mess this up. Shockingly, my fries were stale and cold and had something that resembled and tasted like Italian seasoning on it. Service, I wish I could say was on point, but our server looked pretty busy. No real rapport established besides for taking the order and refilling our waters. No recommendations. No small talk. Like dining at a  tropical themed McDonalds. The only great part of this experience was their Creme Brûlée which housed in a pineapple. I could have eaten four of those. In summary, I would not recommend this place besides for the desserts and will not willingly go back here again. I've heard their happy hour is great so maybe I'll try that out in the future. *Mic drop.",sug9eFew8VE66wxc4OzbVA,0,0,2,DOooC30AK6eZn7TRnwdwNw
4451595,2011-06-11,1,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"While heading to Tommy Bahama I was perplexed talking to my friend over the phone who had discovered they were offering a happy hour on a Thursday night. 

""What? You mean the place that sells the Hawaiian shirts?""

Well yes, they do, but this one has a restaurant/bar attached to it. And they DO have a very wonderful happy hour menu. I started off with a Chardonnay ($6) and then moved on to their Mai Tai ($6). I wish I had had two Mai Tai's! It was delicious and it packed a punch! I was feeling a little tipsy. The presentation was nice too. 

I had the fish tacos off the happy hour menu. The tastes were delectable and even though they were tiny little tacos there was plenty of grilled fish in them. I love grilled fish tacos and I hate fried fish tacos, bleck. However they were a bit on the cool side. I think they may have been sitting for a few moments too long before being brought out. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying them.

So, those are all the good things. Here are some not-so-good things. First off there was a guy there ""playing"" guitar. I use quotations because half the time he was not actually playing his guitar, but instead messing around with his Mac Book which was playing his music for him? Eh, lame. Next off when I was drinking my wine the bartender swooped up the little decanter she had given me along with the wine glass, well there was still wine in it! My jaw literally dropped and I stared at her in disbelief. She quickly deposited it back in front of me and I snatched it up and poured the rest of the wine in my glass quickly. I don't know if it was an accident, but either way it was incredibly awkward. Lastly, the bartender also dropped off the incorrect check for my friend and I (and then we never saw her again). A new bartender arrived who prodded us into purchasing more drinks, but then left us and never returned to see if we actually wanted more drinks.

Luckily another bartender finally noticed our displeasure because I'm assuming it was radiating from us after being given a check that was #1 not ours and #2 WAY more expensive than our actual check. This bartender was very nice and quick to fix the mix up though.

I started with the Crab Bisque . It had little bits of blue crab, sherry, cream and crushed croutons. It had a light sweet taste with a pinch of saltiness. It was crabtastic! I think this has a slightly better taste then Texas De Brazil 's Lobster Bisque. 

I ordered the Thai Shrimp and Scallops as my main entree. I was hesitant at first because some places under cook the scallops where they taste a little too chewy . They cooked the scallops perfect! I expect scallop to be flaky and not gooey. The curry taste was mild which I prefer. I liked that the coconut/ curry taste  didn't over power each other. 

We ended the meal with the Pina Colada cake. My husband and my brother wanted something chocolaty but I had way too much chocolate for Valentine's day  so we ordered the cake. Everyone at the table liked it because it was nice and moist and the frosting wasn't heavy or overly sweet.

With the weather being beautiful out, we sat at a perfectly shaded outdoor patio table and wasted no time in ordering our RW items. My selections were:

* World Famous Coconut Shrimp, Papaya-Mango Chutney, Asian Slaw
* Grilled Chicken & Mango Salad, Toasted Almonds & Macadamia Nuts, Dried Cranberries, Feta, Pepitas, Vine-Ripe Tomatoes, Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette
* Key Lime Pie, Graham Cracker Crust, White Chocolate Mousse

Not knowing much about the brand, I wasn't sure what kind of restaurant Tommy Bahama is supposed to be. Clearly, the store and restaurant have that tropical kind of feel. Everything I sampled today embodied that atmosphere. The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and the slaw and the salad tasted fresh and refreshing. I could totally imagine myself eating those items on a tropical island beach. The chicken could have been more tender and succulent, but the salad more than made up for that shortcoming. As for the key lime pie, it was indeed excellent. The texture was impeccably creamy and it wasn't overly sweet.

This time around, things tanked. A friend and I came for ""Island Time,"" their spin on happy hour. Let me tell you, the service was waaaaay behind island time and that's saying something coming from a local Hawaii girl.

We were waited on almost immediately which was great, especially considering it was NOT busy. But after all our food and drinks came, NO ONE checked on us or cleared our empty dishes or refilled water. The guy who initially waited on us disappeared. I literally had to search for someone to get a refill of water. And even after that it took another 15-20 minutes for someone to check on us.

I love planning lunches here with girlfriends, intimate dinners with my fiancé, or happy hour after a day of shopping. It's always wonderful.

I haven't had a meal that I've disliked, but of course there are stand-out dishes. I really enjoyed the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus), Rustic Chicken Pasta (Whole Wheat Spaghettini, Grape Tomatoes, Spinach, Cippolinis, White Wine Broth), and Seared Ahi Tuna & Kale Salad (Lemongrass Crust, Edamame, Corn, Hearts of Palm, Mushrooms, Pine Nuts, Tahini Miso Dressing). I have enjoyed the other dishes as well, but these I would order again and again. 

During happy hour, I really like the Blackened Fish Tacos (Tomato Relish, Chipotle Aïoli, Lime Sour Cream, Asian Slaw) and Jerk Chicken Lollipops (Macadamia Nuts, Jerk Remoulade). The World Famous Coconut Shrimp (served with Papaya-Mango Chutney and Asian Slaw) make a tasty appetizer and their desserts are crazy good! My favorites are the Piña Colada Cake (Vanilla Cake, Myers Dark Rum, Diced Pineapple, White Chocolate Mousse,Toasted Coconut) and the Pineapple Creme Brûlée (Tahitian Vanilla Bean, White Chocolate Mousse). Seriously make room for these desserts and you won't regret it!

I love the island-themed cocktails - they're potent while tasty. The Pineapple Plantation (Van Gogh Pineapple, Honey, Muddled Pineapple, Lemon) and their Classic Mojito (Cruzan Citrus, Cane Syrup, Mint, Hand-Pressed Lime, Soda) are great! They're also usually $11-12, but just $6-7 during Happy Hour!!

Overall, they have great seafood and wonderful flavors. The service has been great every time I've dined as well. Keep in the mind that Happy Hour (4-7pm daily with a good selection) is only offered at the bar, but there are tables surrounding it as well! They also take Open Table reservations for dining in.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,2,5,VP__eFXh5szS3r4_5FRJ3w

Others offer it in their menu like the nearby Bahama Breeze, but it doesn't compare.

When we arrived, the restaurant was virtually empty. This all seemed very strange given the location and the reviews. We were seated on the patio and the weather was beautiful. Service was somewhat slow but eventually arrived. Drinks were OK. We requested 1800 tequila but they didn't have it. We shared a salad and it was excellent. We had to wait on bread as it was being baked and they ran out. It arrived after the meal was almost over.  My wife ordered the fillet and it was OK but cold. The side vegetable offerings are limited. I ordered the almond crusted snapper. After I ordered they came said that they were out of snapper and would substitute Barramundi. This was a strange substitute. The fish was subsequently delivered and was tasteless and cold. Service was glacially slow. Ultimately, we did not eat the entrées and we left. We were offered a coupon for free appetizer but we left it on the table. Now we know why the restaurant was empty on Friday night.",Imt_GOGlrtBhzjTkbEfnbA,0,0,2,bkvl3f1I1ZWNWe8GO-xE5g

There was a singer performing some laid back well-known songs.  It was quite empty so we had the place to ourselves.  

We ordered ahi tuna tacos, a crab cake and shared a large filet mignon.  I ordered a martini with cantaloupe (can't remember the name).  EVERYTHING was delicious.  They even brought us our steak already split up onto two plates for us with our own sides on each plate, without us even asking.  Now THAT'S what I call customer service.

I can't wait to go back and eat more food off the menu.  They are a bit pricey but the food is worth it.

4934508,2012-07-09,1,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"I like this place!  I was looking for something outside my normal Brio's and decided to try Tommy Bahama and I enjoyed this place.

1.  Style - The food is American and Hawaiian Fusion, which is a nice blend of Asian flavors more suited to the American Palate.  

2.  Ambiance - Very nice, relaxing setting, almost like resort style, with nice window views to the outside areas in Town Square. Very urban like.

3.  Service - Excellent! From the reception desk to the server, I found the service to be fun, relaxing, engaging, all at the right tempo / amount!

4.  Food - 

Appetizers - 

Had the Chicken Lollipop and this was pretty tasty with the Macadamia Nut and the Jerk dressing, although I am not a huge fan of the Jerk taste.  It is not as subtle to me in general. I love having the little drumstick lollipop style which is when they push the meat from the bottom to the top over the bone and it looks like a tootsie pop instead of a chicken drumette.  

Also had the Coconut Shrimp and this was very tasty, tender and very nice sizes as well.  

Seems that with all the appetizers, you can order in an entree size as well!

Food- 

Thai Shrimp and Scallops - Very light flavoring of Curry, with shrimp and scallops over a small bed of rice. The scallops were amazing and the shrimp was fine, it was way overshadowed by the amazingly tender and succulent pieces of scallop....

Lemongrass Ahi Tuna - The tuna was very lightly seared and very raw, which made for a really nice delicate taste / flavor.  Served on a bed of rice with Bok Choy Vegetables. The Bok Choy was nearly perfect, just a bit under cooked for my taste.  However, I do prefer slightly under cooked to overcooked, so this was acceptable to me

5.  They also have private dining area and plenty of space to handle most requirements.  Could be great for business meetings, rent the whole restaurant and etc.  I like it.

Anyway Mo totally turned this into a memorable experience so if you're heading to Tommy Bahama during lunch time ask for Mo he's awesome :) he didn't make us feel rushed and aligned and related while making awesome food recommendations and being friendly and genuine ...

Their seasonal menu was out and Mo showcased the different items that could be tasty .. My Mom and I could not decide so we shared one 702 Tenderloin burger meal and one Cuban Sandwich..

While waiting they brought out a little complimentary bite of seafood ceviche that was delicious 

The 702  tenderloin burger is like this ciabatta bacon jam burger which was cooked medium well since it's filet the meat was totally juicy and they make the burgers fresh and I was impressed with the bacon jam was yummy not overpowering .. the garlic fries were delicious too 


The Cuban came out and I admit usually I only go with that if my Mom is around cause she's so picky but honestly this was one that tasted fresh and authentic and the little potato fry things it comes with I don't know the name were delicious and the food filled us up so much ...



I plan to come back for dessert but we went home with Togo boxes ... this is not a cheap place but considering the service we received for the quality of food I definitely feel it's worth checking out if you're looking for a comfy place to feel like you're taking a trip with quality food while at town square ..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,4,3,5,3Vgv_T0idSYoyBNpcVyFug

Neither my wife nor I had eaten there, so we gave it a shot.  Very glad we did.  We arrived at 11:30 and there were only a couple of tables.  Nearly an hour later the place was 75% full, and this was a Tuesday.  This is typically a good sign.    

To start, I had the crab bisque.  This was textbook bisque to me.  Velvety smooth with the cream, and the sherry flavor came through.  It had crab throughout, even a couple of chunks.  A couple of grinds of black pepper and this was excellent.  I would definitely order this soup again.

I had the chicken sandwich with French fries, rather than the yucca fries it is usually served with.  This sandwich was enormous, I was surprised how large it was.  The chicken was grilled perfectly, they pulled it at just the right time so it retained its maximum juices.  It has lots of fried onions, which are always welcome, as well as jack cheese, garlic mayo, and a jerk sauce.  I could have used more sauce, as it provided a well needed kick.  The soft bun kept it all together.  The sandwich was fantastic, but the fries were not.  They were void of seasoning, and tasted like they have been sitting at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.  Some were nearly cold, and none were hot.  This is the only reason I can't give Tommy Bahama 5 stars.

The wife had the special, a grilled cheese sandwich with everything under the sun and tomato soup with some sort of chiles.  We can't recall, it may have been poblanos.  Whatever it was, it was good.  The grilled cheese had blue cheese, bacon, and some sort of jam.  It was on the requisite crispy bread and was fantastic when dipped in the soup, which had a bit of heat from the chiles.  This was a fantastic version of a classic (and overdone) dish, one I hope they add to the menu.

For dessert, we ordered the side dish of fried plantains.  This comes with a yogurt sauce with bits of pineapple that was fantastic.  It was a great way to end the meal, a dessert that was unique but not that sweet.  Like the rest of the meal, I would order this again.

4974469,2009-07-10,6,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"After filling our tummies with HH food specials from Brio, Tommy Bahama's Tropical Cafe was next on our happy hour tour along Town Square.

They offer happy hour daily from 4 pm to 7 pm.

They do offer quite a few drinks and food items such as small plate appetizers for $5 and drinks ranging from $3-$7.  (Beer $3, Martinis $7)  We only stuck to the drink menu this time around.

I started off with: 

* Coconut Cloud Martini ""Tommy Bahama White Sand Rum, Stoli Vanil vodka, Cruzan Coconut rum, cream of coconut, shaken, strained and sprinkled with toasted coconut."" - A smooth drink of coconut goodness that has you transporting to the islands soon!  Their touch of toasted coconut on top really brings the drink together and gives it a nice crunch and aftertaste.  

Next up: 

* Kohala Coladas ""Bacardi Superior rum and cream of coconut added to your favorite flavor - Mango, Key Lime and Pina Colada - blended with ice and topped with a dark rum float.""  I went with mango for mine and you really can't go wrong with a colada here.  A piece of pineapple and an umbrella tops it off.

The Husband isn't usually one for 'fruity' drinks, but the lure of banana and coconut had him downing a few of these babies:

* The BBC ""Bailey's and Emmet's Irish Cremes, fresh banana and cream of coconut, blended with ice."" - What can I say but damn, this is good. It tastes like a coconut and banana smoothie.  At first you can't even taste the alcohol, which of course has you wondering if there's really any in it.  But once you get up, you'll feel it.  There's good stuff in there!

It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon, compared to the other neighboring restaurants running happy hour.  I think it's because their bar is all inside and you do have a ""Tommy Bahama"" type crowd if that makes any sense.  Our bartenders were pleasant and drinks arrived quickly, so we had no problems with service here at all.  And there's live music too - someone playing a few cover songs is an added bonus.

Overall, Tommy Bahama's is a more laid back place to be when you want to sip some umbrella drinks, feel like you're on vacation, and not get mixed up in the dress to impress crowd.  And plus, their drinks are yummy good and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,10,8,4,GNSjduwurRPf8RvZl22xMQ

This mid-Dec evening, our party of three came for both happy hour AND dinner, and had a wonderful experience! We'll be back!


YELPY DETAILS you could Skip

On this cool, mid-Dec evening, our party of 3 came for the happy hour first in its spacious, stylish lounge with a classy bar. Although the bar counter was large, it was more than half full around 5. Our nice hostess placed us at a comfy corner table. 

We ordered our rounds of red wine (Penfolds Rawson's Retreat Cabernet, $5; BR Cohn Retreat Cab Sauvingnon, $7). Both wines were smooth and tasty. For munchies, we shared several small plates (pull pork quesadilla, 3 per order;  $5; Angus sliders, 2 per order $6; Jerk Chicken Lollipops, $5). All of them were quite flavorful.This evening, they also had a young man (Joe) with a pleasant, mellow voice singing and playing his guiter! We all warmed up to him quickly by his nice performance! 
- He even took requests from audience, and did an excellent rendition of ""On the Road Again""! 

At dinner time, the hostess led us to our table by the window facing the beautiful park with a gorgeous, gigantic Christmas Tree! Our sweet waitress, Joni, helped us select our entrée: 2 Ribeye with a side of potatoes ($39@), and Crabmeat stuffed shrimps with a side of spinach, $30. The shrimps were crunch, fresh and delicious. The ribeye steak, medium rare was juicy, tender and full of flavor. My ribeye order, cooked to MEDIUM, was a bit too dry, though still tasty - my own mistake for ordering it MEDIUM! The potatoes and spinach were excellent. 

Over dinner, we were entertained by the view of the beautiful Christmas Tree in the park with its lights changing colors over music, and occasionally peppered by falling (faux) snow flakes! What a wonderful holiday treat it was!

We were too stuffed to try their tempting deserts, but did enjoy a hot cup of coffee for good measure. The attentive service of Joni and her wait crew, and the tasty dishes...made our dinner another memorable experience! We'll be back for more, perhaps, even sample their deserts!

5029394,2013-04-22,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,What a wonderful surprise!  I highly recommend the Seared Ahi Tuna & Kale Salad because it was generous and very well made.  I didn't order a cocktail but I witnessed some other patrons sipping on drinks and they looked extremely delicious.  I also love sitting outside on a warm day and people watching.  This is a part of Vegas that is not geared towards tourists but I find it to be a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the strip.,xxB5F6TJ4J1MlNufCdqz2Q,0,0,5,WHKsH5K3nHa0foygeJwLdQ

DO NOT order the crab bisque! Was not a soup but more like a sauce.. Was way too heavy and rich. I had several spoonfuls of it and even my date said he was burping it up after. 
I had it worse. I ended up throwing it all up outside the restaurant around the corner by the perfectly, trimmed and manicured green bushes.

They have an awesome happy hour menu with $6 glasses of wine, $5 well drinks, and discounted fish tacos, coconut shrimp and more of their favorites!

Personally, I always love the coconut shrimp, the tangy slaw that comes with them is the perfect accompaniment for the shrimp and the remoulade they sit on! I also love the blackened fish tacos entree, especially the sweet plantains and pudding that come as a side! 

If I am feeling like eating healthy, I also really enjoy the Grilled Chicken and Mango salad that comes with tomatoes, toasted macadamia nuts, dried blueberries and feta. The chicken is always sooo moist and cooked perfectly, probably one of the best pieces of grilled chicken I can recall having consistently at any restaurant!

Finally, what a fun signature touch to provide a complimentary post card when the bill is presented. You can fill out the post card to mail to anyone and they will take care of the postage and mail it out!!",76CP9Yw-34M_rNnOcwXzkw,1,1,5,pnMB3KRXsRLvZrLtj-xoSA

So we've been wanting to try this place out because we heard good things about it. So the place as far as decor was awesome it felt really high end. Now when i looked at the menu the items they had were very simple and stuff that had their own twist on it. 

Our server recommended that i try their vegas burger and my wife had the filet mignon and we had the Ahi Poke Napoleon*. Now the bill i think was the most outrageous part of this meal because for that a couple drinks and a dessert the meal was like $100. 

Ahi Poke napoleon (3/5 stars)- just your typical raw tuna dressed with sesame oil and on top of avocado came with some chips to eat with

Vegas Burger (3/5 stars)- It had alot of ingredients. Cheese, bacon, egg, and this pineapple glaze on a toasted egg bun. the burger was good but it was the pineapple glaze that totally threw it off.if they were to put some ranch and a little it of that glaze on the patty it might have tasted better

Filet MIgnon (1/5 stars)- being that i just went to Mastros to eat i think my expectations were that it was going to be a good steak but nope..overpriced and not well prepared

Overall i love the service and love the restaurant but if i eat here again i will probably order something else..Tommy Bahamas you owe me one!!!",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,1,1,2,Kes2M5nnfZqFBaN9owtzpg

5210210,2009-06-29,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Wow, what a difference over the course of a year.  I reviewed Tommmy Bahama's almost a year ago, and I thought it was great.  The steaks were great, and even the sweet potatoes, which I normally don't like, were great.  

We have been going to Tommy Bahama's about twice per month since then, and each time has been good, with the exception of this last time.  

Things started off okay, we got our table, got our appetizers, and all was good.  But then the steak came.  My girlfriend just thinks it was overcooked, but it tasted like much cheaper meat to me.  The filet was bland and stringy.  And the sweet potatoes were actually the same, tasteless and stringy.  Odd, but true.  The whole meal was sort of so-so.  

The service was okay, but there was something not quite right.  The staff seemed on edge.  It was a weird feeling, like they were just not happy to be there.  And then the topper; my girlfriend put some sweet potato on a smaller plate to try them out, and some women came by and snatched her plate of food away.  She still had her food on it, and the woman never asked if we wanted it taken away.  The woman was wearing a pink polo shirt, so she looked more like one of the managers than a server.  We thought about complaining, but it just felt like maybe it wasn't worth it.  

Not to look to much into this, but I wonder if the place is having financial issues, so the food is not as good and the people are on edge.  Either way, it's a shame because this was a regular place for us to hang out for a nice dinner out, and we would usually grab some stuff from the store after the meal.  We may give it once last chance, maybe this was an off night, but it feels like the magic might be gone from this one.",JOR6G--IM6p9ltgyU25gWg,1,0,1,DRb4B4w-iC_F_aAdl9ilcQ

Drinks:
*The ones with banana were too overpowering for us. I hate that they put sprite in a mojito. It's simple syrup + club soda idiots! The sangria is decent but has lots of brandy, so make sure you're ok with that before ordering. The favorite was the mai thai - still super sweet like the other drinks, but at least had some nice tart citrus to balance it out. Honestly the drinks are relatively disappointing - I would expect perfect fruity drinks from a place inspired by Tommy Bahama's. Drinks average ~$6 during happy hour

Food (All of these are $5 during HH)

*Coconut Shrimp -while it only comes with 3 shrimp, they were amazing! My fiance is a coconut shrimp freak and declared these the best he'd ever eaten. We ordered a 2nd order of these as soon as we tasted them. The papaya mango sauce they are sitting in is awesome too. 
*Pork sliders - we found the pork dried out and over cooked. Fail. 
*Cheeseburgers - could use more cheese, and they were overcooked, but otherwise these are pretty damn tasty. I'd get them again. 
*Quesadilla - Yum! Lots of chicken and deliciousness inside. Decent portion, etc. Recommended.

5279080,2017-11-14,5,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"It seems hard to believe that any of the four founders of Tommy Bahama could have realized just how big their brand would grow back in 1993, but having since merged with a larger company the store has nevertheless grown into a worldwide enterprise focused on ""island-style living,"" over 150 stores and counting with several harboring their own Restaurant and the company even manufacturing their own label of Rum.

Known for their love of khaki and Hawaiian button-ups with leisurewear bleeding over to a whole line of home décor, nothing in particular suggesting the desert but still sold in five retail outlets plus department stores throughout Sin City, it was during a recent trip to Town Square that the decision was made to investigate Lunch on the patio adjacent a recently erected Christmas Tree, the breezy environment befitting the concept without feeling overly ""themed.""  

Toqued by Chef Ruben Vasquez Cruz and second-in-command Armando Vargas, the much-talked about Happy Hour, fresh Fish ""flown in daily"" and a substantial Cocktail list forming the backbone of a menu expectedly intended to please a broad audience, it was mere moments after checking in at the hostess stand that a four-top under umbrellas was offered on the restaurant's patio, a list of daily Chef's specials offered in addition to the typical bill of fare with most of the choices centered around Fresh Seafood.

Apologetic up front when stating that both service and the kitchen were understaffed on this particular afternoon, a rush of traffic completely filling outdoor seating with several additional groups and families sat in the spacious dining room or around a bar area displaying NCAA Football, it was still with relative efficiency that a middle-aged man from Florida took orders for drinks while additionally keeping up with refills of Water, first taste offered in the form of a foamy Pina Colada entitled ""Coconut Cloud"" alongside the refreshing Cucumber Smash and a ""No Proof"" Martini that tasted like Cuban Café con Leche with a gentle Citrus note.

Ready to place an order fairly quickly, the aforementioned staffing situation delaying the arrival of a warm basket of Rolls with Honey Butter until later, it was as the group watched several folks posing around the tree that six jumbo shrimp dipped in shredded Coconut Batter arrived alongside a Half-Rack of Ribs for the youngster, the ""World Famous"" item par for the course atop a dollop of tropical Chutney while the slab of Pork was tender and moist beneath sweet glaze, the sugar outweighing any suggestion of ""spice"" a theme that would be repeated throughout the meal.

Offering several menu items including daily specials in two sizes, the smaller suggested as an ""appetizer"" but equally appropriate as an entree for those with modest appetites, it was alongside a sharable bowl of Fish Soup that had unfortunately boiled too long that a $15 Flatbread arrived, the unannounced pile of Arugula seemingly unnecessary at first but presumably added to balance the Honey-soaked Onions that would have otherwise overwhelmed everything including the texturally pleasing Mushrooms and medium rare Beef. 

Rounding out entrees with a three-piece order of Jumbo Prawns, their snappy flesh and a bit of smoke from the grill a vast improvement from the rubbery Scallop or Shrimp from the Soup, Chefs Cruz and Vargas showed a deft hand when preparing Pearl Cous Cous with fresh Vegetables and light Cream plus tender Mushrooms, the quality of each ingredient as well as the preparation as a whole on par with what one might find further up the Strip for at least $10 more.

Told to ""save room for Dessert,"" a mock-display near the front door brought tableside to assure a sale that was already guaranteed, it was alongside a Double Espresso poured over Ice that three of the Tommy Bahama's signatures were selected, the Peanut Butter Pie eaily the richest with a thick and creamy base balanced by finishing salt as well as the pulverized Pretzel Crust while two tropical choices proved even better, the Pina Colada Cake fragrant and moist without being too dense while the Crème Brulee made from caramelized Pulp and Vanilla Custard re-inserted into the hollowed Rind may just be the best version served in Las Vegas.

***1/2 Dollar for dollar and plate for plate Tommy Bahama Restaurant and Bar occupies a position somewhere between the likes of Cheesecake Factory or Elephant Bar and places like Joe's Stone Crab or Aquanox on The Strip, certainly not ""destination"" dining but at the same time far better than it needs to be for an upscale dining option in an shopping mall.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,4,mQpL9fM35ZE3v_ONnYLbUg

I've purchased clothing from here in the past and some of the clothing is great quality. I love the swimsuits! My husband gets a lot of wears out of his stuff and I notice that some of his shirts pill and come apart after a lot of washes and wears in a shorter period of time. Maybe he's too rough on his clothing but so many of his shirts have pulls and loose threads. I do not expect this from such pricey apparel. 

The customer service here is good. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. Sometimes a little too much so. I'm the type who likes to browse without being bothered. A simple, ""let me know if I can help with anything,"" and then walk away is completely my style. The ""what can I help you find, what are you shopping for, blah blah"" approach is too much for me.

I started with a Millionaires Mai Tai, which was very good, so I ended up getting a 2nd during dinner. I ordered a bowl of Crab Bisque, for the price (9.50) seemed like a small amount but it's very rich and think, so a cup would've been a better choice for me. It was very smooth and creamy, with a hint of crab taste. It was good but I don't think I'd get it again. For my meal I opted for the ""World Famous Coconut Shrimp""(16.50) not sure why it's famous, I've had coconut shrimp elsewhere many times and this wasn't the best by far.The shrimp was cooked well, not greasy or anything, it was just not anything special, and the papaya mango chutney seemed too sweet to dip the shrimp in.  On a good not, My husband got the Cuban Sandwich (13.50)...wow! I would've never thought to order a Cuban somewhere like this, it was very good, a little messy but lots of flavor. We both agree we'd go back just for that!
The staff was nice enough to let us bring our own cake, they cut it and served it as well. 
Everyone had a good time, we sang Happy Birthday, ate cake and enjoyed good conversation in a pleasant setting.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,1,1,3,iO6xs5C2qqz8ZwTN2C0ABQ

When the food was being brought to the table half of a salad was brought out and our entire table laughed bc it looked so small.  Natalie then replies to our cackle by saying ""what?... I couldn't bring both salads out""  rolls eyes and walks off.  She left us at the table stunned, we became more stunned as were were informed she was the manager of the establishment.  What nerve for a woman who is clearly dressed inappropriately (wearing a sleeveless shirt without the body to go with this type of top). 

 I yelped this as promised, and if it werent for the cool server the tip would have almost been non existent.  Natalie, if you dont like your job quit.  Its a waste of your time and patrons when you take your unhappiness out on us.

We've had the ""real thing"", island cuisine that is, so we were a bit shy at trying anything that might be a knock off, but I actually enjoyed it. 

We were seated right away, the bar had cozy booths that were available, and our server was also the bar keep. She took our drink and appetizers order right away, and the food was swift to come our way. 

We had the crab cakes, which had a very beautiful presentation. The green and red sauces were sweet chili sauce and olive oil. Then on top of that was cole slaw with a vinegar dressing. Then two golden brown crab cakes stacked on that. I thought the crab cake was really good, I had big bites of crab which I love, and the sweet chili sauce made it zesty. I don't think my husband cared for this dish, his comments were ""it's too sweet"". 

We also tried the fried goat cheese, with macadamia nuts and soy sauce glaze. I love the bold flavors. It was served over a bed of diced mango's. The cracker served with it was a little thin, since the goat cheese has pretty strong flavor a thicker wafer would be better. 

We both tried the Cuban sandwich with fried yucca. The sandwich came cut on the diagonal and it was difficult to eat, as each bit I lost a little bit of the insides, the meat and pickles kept sliding off. The yucca fries were light golden brown, and had a very different texture, it looked like fries, but it was very soft when biting into the wedge. The texture was too much for me, so I gave most of my fries to my husband. 

I did enjoy the meal, I thought the flavors were good, the service was excellent, as our server took good care of us, but I did feel it was a bit pricey.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,4,i5E5AUNLguosD0iDzQLcOw

We came for Happy Hour (which is from 4-7 pm) and ordered the Bahia Sangria, Mojito, Duo Dip of Chips, Sliders, Blackened Fish Tacos, and Pork Rib Entree. My sangria came out with a pretty flower and it was strong enough to do the job. The waitress told us that everything they serve is fresh and cooked in house - which was apparent when we saw tasted the food.

The Duo Dip of Chips are just chips with fresh guacamole and zesty cheese. I was surprised at how well the cheese came out! I never had that type before and that's certainly not the last time. The Sliders are the miniature versions of their real burgers and come with BBQ sauce, bacon, onion, tomato and lettuce. The Blackened Fish Tacos were amazing!! They gave us quite a bit of high quality fish! The Pork Rib entree gives you about 6 ribs with mashed potatoes and asian cole slaw. The ribs were cooked tenderly and the sauce was spot-on. I would recommend all of these items! The happy hour items were very affordable - about $5-8 each. The entrees are more expensive as expected, ranging around $18-30. 

Since it was Valentine's Day weekend as well, they also offered a trio of desserts for $10 that included strawberry panna cotta, chocolate cake with oreos, and red velvet cake. The panna cotta was my least favorite - I think the strawberry made it more tart than I'm used to. I definitely over-indulged with the rest of the cakes though! :) 

My waitress offered amazing service and was very friendly. The only downside about the whole night wasn't due to the food or even my own waitress but was because another waitress rudely refused to take a picture for us.

5530693,2017-05-05,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"We never come to Las Vegas without stopping here.  If a restaurant can be a vacation unto itself, this is the place. 
MAIN COURSES These are huge and delicious (notably the fish tacos, crispy fish sandwich and macadamia nut crusted salmon to name the ones I've tried.)
APPETIZERS Instead of the large entrees, I prefer to order an appetizer (such as the Ahi tuna tacos or Ahi poki Napoleon) and salad (the bungalow salad sounds simple, but it's SO delicious!) so I have more room for the so amazing cocktails and dessert--more on those later.  My husband adores the chicken tortilla soup and the seared scallop sliders.  And we always order the macadamia crusted goat cheese, even though we have the cookbook and make it at home from time to time. 
I should mention that I'm allergic to shellfish, so I can't eat shrimp, scallops, crab, lobster, etc., but I never feel deprived here, even though TB Café places a strong emphasis on seafood in general.  THANK YOU!
COCKTAILS  These are heaven.  Like vacation in a glass.  Best pina colada anywhere.  Yummy mojitos.  A key lime martini to die for.  Blood orange margarita--yes, please.  My husband ordered none of these, but was very happy with his order.  (Hmm, memory of beverages consumed is a little foggy, wonder why?)
DESSERT:  I keep trying to resist the key lime pie to try something different, but I can't do it.  My husband has ordered the pina colada cake and loved it, but his current favorite is the pineapple creme brulee served in a thick slice of carmelized pineapple.  I would love to try the malted chocolate pie or the peanut butter pie, but the key lime pie has a hold on me...
SERVICE:  So warm, welcoming & attentive without being overly familiar.  They're happy to carry on a conversation about food if you engage them, or they'll drop off your cocktail & appetizer and just keep an eye out for when your head pops up or your drink gets low.  My understanding is that a lot of the staff has been here since they opened (close to 10 years ago) and that tells me they treat their staff well, and their staff is loyal to them.  With plenty of other restaurants & bars in the LV area, that's saying something impressive.  I believe our server's name was Matt, and he was perfect.
DECOR:  I'm not exaggerating when I say we have seriously investigated decorating our home in a similar style.  Love the tropical wallpaper, the combination of dark and painted-white woods, the floral pillows in the wooden booths, etc.  It's a relaxing color palette with colors of sand, golden pineapple, and shades of green, much like resorts we've visited in Hawaii and Florida.
MANAGEMENT:  We met the sales manager Kaaren Kragerud for the first time during this last visit, and she's the real deal.  She spent quite a bit of time chatting with us about the offerings at the restaurant and at the store, and overall put a friendly human touch on an already great experience.  She's amazing, and we'll ask if she's in when we visit from now on.

I remember it being amazing pasta, I was quite surprise that pasta could be this good at Tommy Bahama's, after all they just sell clothes. Anyway...I ordered the Rustic Pasta for myself this time. I was quite disappointed with the dish this time around. They had changed the whole dish! It was basically a sour soup with tomatoes and pasta. Ew. My friend ordered the same thing and was quite disappointed too.

We called the server over to politely ask if there was a reason why the pasta tasted the way it did, and why it had changed from before. The server, also named Tommy did not hesitate to give us the menu to change our order. I ordered the special, Parm crusted mahi mahi and green beans and lemon infused rice. 

By the time the second dish came out it had two hours since we sat down...I was starving. I tool a bit of the fish and it was meh, I took a bit of the lemon infused rice and it tasted like soap. I swear if the establishment isn't Indian or Asian-decent they EFF the rice up!! I swear. I decided just eat the mediocre fish and green beans off my plate and call it a day.

The food was to die for!! The Ahi Tuna Tacos were yummy, in crunchy wonton shells with some asian slaw and wasabi-lime avocados. The scallop sliders were my favorite because they were good sized scallops that were juicy and seemed to melt in my mouth. The crispy onions that were with it gave it a tasty crunch. Oh and the Mushroom & Kobe Burger was amazing, and I'm not a big burger fan. That was a whole lot of food for just the 2 of us but we pretty much polished it off (except for the salad) and had no room for dessert.

I really wanted a mojito but it wasn't on the drink menu. So I asked our waiter if there was any possibility that the bartender could make one for me and sure enough they did! I was very satisfied and had a second one. ;)

He played alternative, rock, and pop music.  Things that people could sing along to.  I really liked him.  I ordered a Mojito which was soooo delicious.  Bartenders usually don't know how to make a good tasting Mojito. This lady did!   Anyways, our table was ready within 5 minutes. They sat us down by an open door. It was, of course, nice outside.  

I ordered a salad and within 15 minutes it came out. Honestly this had to be the best salad I've ever had.  It had steak and some potato and whatever dressing they used was to die for. I wasn't  that hungry coming in, but after my first bite I couldn't stop myself. I wanted more! I couldn't  allow myself to order dessert knowing I'd devour it.   Who knew the original clothing store could create an amazing restaurant. They need more of these in Chicago!  

Well next time I'm back in Vegas Im definitely stopping by Tommy's.  I want more salad and I want it now!",qjZstWM3LnEq6JisTCiW_w,1,1,5,XR80NA-BFGrWriLm_ZQxZw

Got the goat cheese appetizer, I didn't care for it due to some odd after taste. Hubby enjoyed & finished it. The complimentary bread & cinnamon butter was good. Crab bisque soup was good, very rich. Coconut shrimp appetizer was good too but not sure what's ""world famous"" about em. Hubby said the philly steak tacos were just ok as well. He only finished 2/3 which is rare for him.

I saw the menu beforehand to try and prepare my choice but once we got there and ordered some appetizers it was difficult. Everything looked so good! I didn't order the appetizers so I'm not sure exactly what they were called but they were coconut shrimp, some sort of chicken drumstick, a quesadilla, and a flatbread with pear and cheese. All of them were amazing but the coconut shrimp was the clear winner. I ordered the seared ahi with succotash and my husband ordered the fish and chips. The crust on the ahi was chili and brown sugar which was amazing and I loved the veggies. He loved the fish but the ""chips"" left something to be desired. For dessert I ordered the pineapple creme brûlée and he ordered a chocolate tart. Both were amazing but the chocolate one was so rich we had to bring it home for the next day.

Water, check, bread basket, yummy, check, attentive service, check, great drinks, check...

JB ordered the special, some kind of creole Mahi Mahi which he found excellent. (I don't eat fish, but it was beautifully presented) and a caesar salad, which was the real deal.

A friend and I'd had a late lunch so we shared a basket of fries (nice fresh cut fries) and I ordered the Tortola Tortilla Soup, wonderfully filling, very generous bowl, savory and our friend ordered the Cooper Island Crab Bisque, which she thoroughly enjoyed.

It's a bit pricey, but worth an occasional splurge.  Live steel drum music, and I was transported to an island or the Florida Keys... aaaahhhhhhhh!  Lovely.",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,0,0,5,Td5gHCx06mR-XFIJpCZRBg

5792545,2012-09-15,1,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Before I get into my review, I just want to preface that this rating is for happy hour.

Happy hour is from 4-7p all day errrday, which is pretty convenient.

I ordered the smoked salmon, fish tacos, ahi poke, crab bisque soup, chick lollipop, and the crab cake.  I had the sangria and cantaloupe martini to drink.

The food was just ok.  I didn't fall in love with any of the dishes we had, and thought that it was still too pricey for what it was.  I can't imagine paying full price for any of those dishes.

The lollipop chicken was dry, sauce was ok, mango salad it came with was good.
Ahi poke and smoked salmon dishes were ok, but I didn't like the chips they came with.  Plantain chips would've been a better choice to serve with.  I thought the fish tacos lacked seasoning, flavor, sauce;  all I tasted was the flour tortilla.  Crab cake had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much sweet chili sauce.  It over powered the crab cake, which was too salty anyway.  Lastly, the crab bisque!  Disgusting.  I tried this cause it seemed to be a favorite dish on yelp reviews.  It was really difficult for me to eat because they went wayyyyy to heavy on the cream.  I really felt like puking after.  I would not recommend this dish.  The drinks were ok.  Sangria wasn't really a sangria.  No fruit, just cheap red wine mixed with fruit juice and water I suppose.  Cantaloupe martini was good, but way to sweet.  I think they should've held back on some of the melon liqueur.  Probably would've tasted better if they used real cantaloupe juice.

Service was friendly, but slightly inattentive.  No big deal cause he had the whole bar to take care of, plus the tables.  Didn't bring us the bread in the beginning, but did offer it half way through the meal.  I told him i'd like some, but he never brought it.  Asked for it after our meal was done, cause I wanted to taste the apple butter.  Had to flag someone else down for our check.

Overall, I will probably not come back because I didn't care for the food we had.  I tried to sample as much as I could from the HH and appetizer list.  Based on what I had and the price, there are other restaurants in Vegas I'd rather spend my money on.  That's it.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,1,1,2,16Jh6QHw4_41hOPX_iN3sg
5793396,2014-12-21,0,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,"Dropping my review down to a single star. Here's why: 

Came here at my suggestion for a good friend's birthday dinner last week. Her salmon dinner was ridiculously under cooked. We sent it back and another was brought out, but this should've never happened, let alone on her birthday. It was never mentioned or offered to be refunded. 

Tonight I dined with my children, and my daughter was halfway through her burger when I noticed it too was severely undercooked. We ordered a medium burger, and it was very RAW. I felt bad that I hadn't noticed it earlier, but again: it should've never been served this raw. My son ordered the same burger and it too was raw. Our waitress did remove one burger from our bill, but why not both? Both burgers were undercooked! She didn't even pretend to care. We had a horrible, neglected dinner. I guess we weren't worthy enough to offer the dessert tray to either. I didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I did leave a crappy one. Very disappointed, because I come here often and these back to back poor experiences just left me angry. 

I don't know what the hell happened to this place. But two visits in one week and awful food is unacceptable. Where is the accountability in the kitchen?!?! Stop sending out under-cooked food! 

Love the rum drinks here, but we won't be back. Just rotten.  :-(",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,0,0,1,0bUJo1GIYeAvmM1GnS5WvA

When a restaurant changes the way I shop and eat, this is a 5 star all the way. This was a life changer. I never gave much thought to butter and bread. Then I was surprised! Wow, I enjoyed Cinnamon Honey Butter a lot. I need to up my butter game.

The food was good. Considering how pricey Vegas is, I am so grateful for keeping the food prices reasonable. The gambling life can be hard on people especially when you get a bad beat. I ordered the burger w/ french fries. The burger was made medium rare. There were plenty of beef on the burger and everything tasted great.

The manager stepped in and was extremely accommodating (I didn't catch her name) and sent Adam to be our server for the evening. Adam was WONDERFUL and he really turned the experience around for us. I appreciated him taking on our group, especially knowing that we were a bit upset, and he treated us so kindly and was very attentive. We have dined here before and will definitely continue to in the future...requesting Adam, of course! He helped to make our evening special along with the management and that meant a lot to us.

Happy hour is only available on the patio or at the bar. It was a little chilly so we asked for a heater which he said was no problem. 

Joni was our server and quickly arrived to take our drink orders. There are several HH drinks available, everything from beer, wine and cocktails. We chose the sangria and coconut cloud martini. The coconut cloud was SOOO GOOD. Ron Matusalem Platino, Vanilla Stoli, Coconut rum, cream of coconut and toasted coconut on top. I could have drank about 6 of these! 

We perused the HH small plates and decided on the following:

Coconut shrimp- 4/5. 3 large shrimp covered in coconut. For $8 was hoping for at least 4.
Blackened fish tacos- 4/5. 2 tacos with cabbage and lime sour cream. Very good. 
Roasted pork quesadilla 4/5. About 6 pieces (1/2 a regular one?) loaded with delicious pork and cheese. 
Macadamia crusted goat cheese- 5/5. This was really good, loved the flavor combinations. Ended up ordering a second one. 
Ahi Poke napoleon- 5/5. Fresh Ahi tuna on avocado, delicious. Again we ordered a second one it was so good. 

Ended with the pina colada cake- 3/5. Didn't live up to its description. Lacked any Myers Rum flavor. All the food came out fast and our service throughout was pretty good. The first heater only lasted 5 minutes. The couple next to us asked for another one which they brought out. That one lasted about another 5 minutes as well. No one ever came to try and fix it or try a third one.
