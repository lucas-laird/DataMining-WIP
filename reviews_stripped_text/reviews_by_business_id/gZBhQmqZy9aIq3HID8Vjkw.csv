The cheese and meat plates had great variety and I particularly liked the cherry sauce and apricots that came with the cheese. The verdure was farro, roasted beets with saba, and an eggplant caponata. All three had good flavor and texture, nice balance of flavors. The arancine and frittelle di proscuitto were good, but the fried cauliflower was excellent even though it sounds plain. I'm not a huge fan of raddiccio, but it was served grilled with smoked mozzarella and it was fabulous. The biscotti was also pretty good.

The wines were great, although I can't remember all of their names. They paired wonderfully with the food. The house made amaro was great with the biscotti.

Tip: ask for olive oil with your bread. it's from italy and it tastes amazing - very fruity and fresh. It was also nice to eat the meal and enjoy the opera show and the string quartet provided by the hotel since we ate in the courtyard area.",UQQIreSRT-DCqhPubwaDvQ,0,0,5,oZhY_oWjKEt8sKCPf9jOQQ

First I have to say, I am not an Italian foodie. I generally will skip Italian if I have a choice. But I thought, hell...I'm in Vegas, and all the restaurants immediately in the Palazzo are the Iron Chefs signature restaurants. 

So I picked Mario Batalis OTTO Enoteca Pizzeria

Had the Caprese salad, slightly different variation then what I am used to. The tomatoes are roasted and then chilled, the cheese is a Burratta instead of young Mozza, and the pesto is kinda just piled on top with pine nuts.

Beautifully presented in that kinda pretentious giant plate little portion way. (Still pretty, and tasty)

Spaghetti and Meatballs. Just enough to call yourself happily full. Pretty tasty.

Topped the whole thing off with Gelato Sunday, Pistachio, Vanilla and Chocolate in a waffle bowl.

YUM!

Would I go back,  maybe. It just wasn't really my thing. But I was open to the experience.

I will say everything was delicious, presented excellently and serving staff were on point.

If Italian (Red sauces, Red Wines, if it's Red it's probably here) are your thing, then GO!

Dear god - The bufala mozzarella melts in your mouth. The basil and olive oil...just get it and you will know the deliciousness.

Besides that fantastic pizza: 
the cheese tastings are very fun and are a great way to sample cheeses that are otherwise too expensive or  not available for most people.

The waiter was very knowledgeable and was very friendly. 

We've tried other dishes that were all good, but nothing came even close to the Margherita pizza. I can seldom say that the food at nicer restaurants is worth the money, but this pizza is (i cannot say that about the other dishes i have tried at this restaurant and most other fancy places)

I ordered the lamb pasta ($20), which tasted not too bad at first. The flavor was all right, and the pasta was cooked nicely (it had a bit of a chew to it, which I like).

Rarely am I disappointed eating at an Italian restaurant of any caliber.  Sadly, this ""Enoteca"" failed to deliver.  I split the special salad with my fellow diner, which was grilled radicchio with mozzarella melted on top.  The waiter gushed about it as if this salad, conceptually, had changed the culinary arts forever.  What we received was chopped grilled radicchio smothered in about twice as much cheese as was necessary and drizzled with some balsamic.  It was tasty but sloppily executed.  The pasta dish we ordered, Bucatini all'Amatriciana, was about 1/4lb of pasta with a light tomato sauce and (no joke) 3 tiny pieces of cured pork and 4 tiny pieces of chopped onion on it.  It was as tasty as any pasta you would order at Olive Garden, and vastly overpriced.

environment/service: one star (*)
This service was some of the worst I have ever received at a restaurant of this caliber.  We waited for our table, were seated and left out to dry for 10 minutes.  Finally, a waiter dropped off some bread and bread sticks encased in paper, with nothing to put on it (butter, olive oil).  Eventually our main waiter came to the table, where I had to ask to have him bring olive oil, vinegar and salt and pepper to the table.  We ordered, and that was the last we saw him until I had to flag him down to get our check.  Nobody, from him, to the wine opener, to the other servers who delivered our plates, was friendly or passionate about their jobs.  Dirty plates sat on the table after eating for about 15 minutes.  The fact that they added a 20% ""service"" charge onto the bill was offensive.  The environment, a cliche Venetian ""plaza,"" was pure Vegas--all style and no substance.

value: one star (*)
Any pasta dish priced above $18 (especially for 1/4lb of pasta) better be pretty damn good.  This wasn't.  It was obscenely overpriced, like much of the food in Vegas.  The salad was about $15, which was high for one chopped vegetable with cheese melted on top.  The 20% service charge was the last straw, especially given the abysmal service.

The menu had to be explained by our waitress - it is a little confusing. But it seems that we got it right - we ordered the two best entrees, according to the host!! 

We started with Arugula and Shaved Parmigiano Salad - the cheese was melted over the greens and was really special. We also order 3 vegetables as an appetiser - Brussel Sprouts & Pecorino, Cauli-flower ""Siciliana"" and Squash Agro Dolce. The brussel sprouts were chopped, raw sprouts mixed with cheese and were spectacular!! 

Our two best-of-the-house entrees were the Braised Pork Shoulder, very tender and juicy, and the Marinated Chicken Paillard, also tasty and moist. The only hitch in the evening was when our entrees came out before we had finished our appetisers - our waitress promptly sent them back, and had them re-cooked at the proper time.

We had lunch at Enoteca San Marco on Saturday.  The food was fine, above average, even.  However, the experience was nothing spectacular.

The location in the Canal Shoppes area of the Venetian lent something of a shopping mall / food court feeling to the place.

Moreover, we had a reservation, and despite being some of the only people there as early as we were, they did not have a table already prepared for us.

Furthermore, the bread service left much to be desired.  The bread came out individually wrapped, and it was prone to leaving crumbs all over the place, particularly given the way the waiter was picking up the bread wrappings.

The BF and I were in Las Vegas for the BF's brother's birthday and we needed a place for lunch. We decided on Enoteca San Marco before I realized it was a Mario Batali place. As we walked in, I saw an autographed pair of Batali's trademark day-glo orange Crocs ON THE FOOD COUNTER. The Crocs were obviously too small to support Batali's rotund frame, but it was gross to see shoes on the food counter. Given the amount of Asian business that Vegas gets these days, Batali should be aware that putting shoes on the food prep counter is a tremendous offense in Japan. Bobby Flay found that out on Iron Chef. 

Anyway, the food is okay. It's a small plates concept and you'll spend $30 - $60 per person for lunch before you get enough to eat. This is nothing like eating in Italy, but it's passable. The gelato was good and they had interesting flavors like blood orange and grapefruit. 

The faux Venetian atmosphere adds a bit, but it is quickly offset by the ""free"" singing that occurs hourly. You get to endure costumed shrieking for up to 20 minutes each hour. It really detracts from the dining experience and heightens the fakery of the setting.

Enoteca is a bit more casual and low key than Carne and offers pastas, pizzas and a small variety of entrees. 

Our group started with a selection of cheeses, Prosciutto di Parma and fried squash blossoms. Not being a cheese fan I passed on the cheese and sampled the prosciutto and blossoms. YUM! The Prosciutto was delicate, just a bit salty and a nice light beginning to the meal. The squash blossoms were filled with some sort of cheese mixture, lightly battered and deep fried. And though fried they were still very light and airy. DELISH! I've never had squash blossoms but this app made me a fan! 

For dinner I had the the Marinated Chicken Paillard. WOW! What a serving! The dish ""base"" was a large slice of deep fried eggplant topped with ricotta cheese, three chicken breast pieces, spicy arugula and a light almost tangy green sauce. So Good and a very generous serving of food! I was able to finish the eggplant, arugula and two pieces of chicken, but left one last piece....just too full. I also have to mention the Braised Pork Shoulder which two members of our party ordered. I was told was delicious and literally fell apart it was so tender. They didn't even need a knife to slice the meat, it just pulled part with a fork! Good stuff.

For dessert we did a sampling of two gelatos and one sorbet. We had the chocolate gelato with hazelnuts, a black cherry gelato and a strawberry sorbet. All were the perfect ending to the meal. Cool, light, clean, refreshing and delicious!

The service was prompt, timely, friendly and efficient. Our server checked on us regularly even though the place was packed!

Lissa G's review guided me to the Mortadello, which we tried as an appetizer and that was amazing.  I loved the Prosciutto as well and only regret that I didn't get to try the other meats.  This is a must-order.

I really enjoyed the antipasto offerings where we ordered an item or two from all but the salad section.  The risotta balls from the Fritti (fried) section were delicious.  On the cured meats, I loved the proscuitto but the pancetta was too fatty for my taste.  The cheese plate we ordered - 3 for $15 I think - was very good and nicely accompanied by brandy-soaked cherries, spiced apricots, and honey w/ truffles.  We also enjoyed the surprisingly spicy Bitter Broccoli with Spicy Lemon Oil and Lentils w/ Salami from the Vegetables section.

Given the mildish prices (for Vegas) and the quality of the antipasto, I was considering 5 stars....

Until the pizza.  Huge disappointment considering Batali's reputation and the great things I've heard about the pizza at Mozza in LA.  The crust on our pie was thin but chewy in a frozen pizza way.  The flavors of the cheese. sauce, and toppings were just ok.

I tried my friend's veal and ricotta meatballs (off the entree menu) and these were quite good.  I'd recommend those or one of the pastas and to skip the pizza altogether.

As for wine, nice selection available by the bottle or in 250 ml pourings (about a glass and a half).  I had a $16 Montepulciano that was nice.  Recommend the wine over mixed drinks as our whole table complained the drinks were poorly mixed (too strong).

1317795,2010-08-20,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"Sorry, Mario Batali. I did not really like your restaurant or my experience here.

First of all, let me be clear. The following review is MAINLY based on the service my friends and I received when we dined here last weekend, not so much on the food, but you'll see.

There were 11 of us who decided to come here last Friday. Since we were staying at the Palazzo and did not feel like having a buffet dinner after a heavy buffet lunch, Enoteca San Marco seemed like a good choice. Not to mention the fact that with the promo code we used when we booked the suites at the Palazzo, it also gave us a 15% discount at this place. So good reviews on Yelp + Convenience + a 15% discount in combination is what ultimately brought us here.

Our reservation was at 8:30pm but we did not arrive until closer to 8:50pm. We called at 8:20pm to let the restaurant know that we were running late, they said ""No problem.""

Upon our arrival, they promptly seated us. That should be a good thing, right? Well, it could have been, except for where they seated us. Our table was all the way on the far right hand side of the restaurant, conveniently located by the escalators. Yes, it was a Friday night, and yes, the restaurant was busy, but couldn't they have seated us in the middle or something, if we had called ahead to make a reservation and also called to inform them that we were running late? Guess not...

After we got seated, we asked the server if we could move to a different table, and he said he'd check w/ the manager. We proceeded by asking the server if he could please take our 15% off coupon since on the back of the coupon, it said that we needed to inform our server right when we're seated. We were then told by the server that the only way they could honor the 15% discount is if we charge it to the suite. But we had a total of 3 suites AND there were a total of 11 of us....so by charging it to the room it just means more trouble and hassel for everyone. Not to mention the fact that NO WHERE on the coupon did it mention about the room charge. I told the server that we could NOT charge it to our room because we had told the front desk at check in to not allow room charges. So whatever, the server apologized and left; by this point, my group and I had begun a series of discussion about the sevice being received, blah blah blah. A few minutes later, an Asian guy (who I assume is the manager) arrived and told us he could not find a different table for us because they were really busy..etc. He did apologize more than a few times and I felt a little bit better about the service because at least they tried. I decided to ask him again about the 15% discount, and he said he'd honor it by saying how the other server was probably just confused. 

Now onto the food...

The server brought over some bread sticks for us to eat before our meals were served; the bread sticks came in thin plastic bags, which I thought were a little strange and not very classy of the restaurant. Couldn't they have opened the bread sticks and placed them in a tray or something?

Anyways. I shared a pasta plate (Veal Bolognese) with one of my girlfriends. The pasta tasted good, but a little salty. My other friend ordered the cheese plate w/ wine, but they did not bring any cracker or bread to pair her cheese with, until she asked for them 1/2 way thru her plate. My boyfriend ordered two glasses of beer and it turned out it's $9 a beer! (we could not find beer on the menu, so did not know about the price) Now, that's expensive!

I am not sure the message Enoteca San Marco is trying to send by charging a lot for its food w/o delivering good tasting food or service. Is this supposed to be a high end restaurant, or not? I'm still confused. The restaurant needs to rethink about the brand image it is trying to deliver, and perhaps rebrand itself. I did not think I'd ever dislike a restaurant that is owned and operated by such a famous chef like Mario Batali, but the whole presentation with the bread sticks, the table location, the coupon mixup, and salty food...etc have all made me raise my eyebrows and have second thoughts about ever returning...

No...I'm not typically one to order a cheese plate, unless all I am planning on for my meal is wine and cheese, but here I must have a cheese plate for the table.  Not only do they select great cheeses for the table dependent upon what your cheese tastes are, but when they arrive they are accompanied by black truffle honey, brandied cherries, and apricots in a thick syrup - which are all absolutely divine when accompanying the cheese.  It actually takes me about 45 minutes to eat a piece of cheese here because I am savoring all the flavors excessively and consuming tiny pieces to make the glory last as long as possible.  
Moving on from the cheese, I must say I am a big fan of the Penne ala Norma.  In fact, after having this treat I went out and bought Batali's cookbook just so we could prepare the pasta at home.  Mine is never as good as his, but it will do since I don't get to Vegas as often as I would like.  
I got so busy salivating over memories of the food that I forgot to mention that the location is stunning too.  On my first trip here I was recently back from a trip to Venice and was really amused and blown away by the attempt to recapture the winding streets and open squares of Venice inside the Venetian Canal shops.

As for the rest of the food...  The beard was nicely packaged, but tough.  They have a limited wine selection per glass, but the bottles are reasonably priced to counter the difference.  The entrees are fair; you may consider them as large portions for one, medium portions for two, or great for sampling with groups.

Thought this was a nice place to relax and people watch in the artificial twilight of the Venetian's ""St. Mark's Square"".  Had some good, simple food and experienced sharp, friendly service.  Also, just based on a quick scan of the offerings in this square / upscale food court, it seemed to have the best range of vegetarian options.

Highlights / Lowlights:

What was great - 

- Food.  The somewhat inventive take on caprese salad (see photo) was both visually interesting and tasty.  Then the simple pasta dish I had with black pepper and pecorino cheese was understated excellence.  

- Service.  I experienced team table service, which when done poorly can be chaotic.    But everyone here was on their game - a nice balance of friendly and professional.

- Wine.  They offer a nice sampling of regional Italian wines, including a nice example of one of my sentimental favorites - Morellino di Scansanso.

What wasn't so great -

- No complaints, really.  Maybe it was just the fact that I sorely needed some relative quiet and escape after a day at CES, but I enjoyed a nice simple solo dinner here. 

Would I eat here again? 
With everything there is to try in Vegas I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to get here, but if I'm at the Venetian again, yes, I'd definitely eat here.

Did it seem like a good value?
One app, one entree, some Pellegrino and a glass of wine for $56 before tip.  Not a bargain, but what is in Vegas?

1470330,2009-12-29,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"I love coming to Enoteca San Marco! When I first stumbled upon Enoteca San Marco, I had dinner at Mario Batali's other restaurant B&B Ristorante during a previous trip and the food was so great there that I had to check his other restaurant out. The food is always wonderful here and it has the best value for your money without losing any of that unbelievable taste. Now this is my second time here and I love that the menu changes based on the seasonality of the food. Its a nice way to get people coming back as their menu does change every few months.

Some people might think the location can be a negative, but I happen to like being next to the canals on the second floor of the Venetian. Although it is a poor substitute for being in Italy, it puts you in the mood and it ads to over all experience. You get to see all the people walking through and over the canal bridges. Its kinda cool.

Anywho, lets get to the food! We ended up ordering the Cauliflower Frittelle (breaded and fried cauliflower), Prosciutto di Parma, and Eggplant Caponata. One thing I enjoy about the appetizers (and main dishes) here is how simple the food is but how wonderful it tastes. I have no doubt it isn't as simple to make as they make it appear.

For our main dishes, we ended up just kinda sharing a few dishes because we all wanted to try as much as we could on the menu. We ended up getting:
1) the Lingueine con Le Cozze (which is fresh Lingueine with Mussles). This was very tasty. You think it is going to be simple pasta you find at the Olive Garden or something and then you taste it.... its on a whole different playing field.
2) Margherita Pizza which is a high end very very thin crust pizza. Not like your normal pizza!
3) Prosciutto Arugula. Another pizza that is great.

The only negative thing I can say about Enoteca San Marco is they didn't have these fried squash blossoms this time. =( I guess they aren't in season, but man I would drive back up to Vegas just to have that for dinner one night.

If you are looking to make reservations for dinner, I would highly recommend going online and using Open Table. Its fast, easy and they always respect the reservations made through them. A 5 out of 5!",cTf5rrUd253mkJtUW0DYKQ,2,0,5,esrdKfFSm9g18yCIu3KunQ

It's a shame because I really like Mario Batali, but I would not come back here, nor was I really overwhelmed with my meal. I do have one recommendation, however:

GET THE CHEESE PLATE! This was a hit. There are three options, 3 for $7, 5 for $14, and 7 for $21. We got the 7 choices and split between 4 people. The cheese plate also comes with a variety of sides, which we weren't too sure if you were supposed to dip the cheese in, however they were a nice addition, but we weren't overly impressed with them. It came with cherrys soaked in cognac (tasty), honey with black truffle (eh), and some sort of apricot marmalade with chili pepper (not a fan). Don't worry about those though, the cheese was EXCELLENT, and there's about 12-14 for you to choose from. We all agreed it should have come with crackers, though.  

Other than that, my meal tasted ok, but if I did go back there, I would not order it. I've had way better seafood (or meals for that matter) at much less expensive places. BTW, if you don't eat meat, good luck. I at least eat seafood, and there were two options. I opted for the marked fish ""Livornese"". The market fish was Ahi Tuna, cooked ok, but wasn't a fan of the sauce. As far as my friends, I think they mildly enjoyed their meals. Also, the bread is not fresh- it comes wrapped in paper (thought this was very strange for what was supposedly a '5-star' restaurant- and the crust was burnt. 

The setting is however very nice, it is inside of the Venetian, and it really does look like you are outside sitting in some Venetian plaza. I thought the Pope might have come out at any moment. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly which was a major plus, but that's not going to get me to go back to any restaurant, especially one where I'm spending over $20 on my meal.",iGV7_O_FnNZ8km2K_BexfQ,0,0,2,0-eEnpmdRAT4HxZJzLWMwQ

This Italian place is a typical semi high-end restaurant. The service is fantastic and classy. The menu isn't gigantic but the quality of each food is prepared with exquisite taste and thought. The food is very good but a bit on the pricier end. Your definitely paying more because it's Vegas and it's a famous chef's restaurant.

They also have an array of gelato's to try with some pretty unique flavors. I will have to come back just for that alone.

1671957,2010-08-30,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"We visited Enoteca San Marco again this weekend and enjoyed another 3-hour foodie feast!  We started with a glass of Prosecco, proscuitto di parma, lonza, and 3 cheeses accompanied by the apricots, honey with truffles, and liquid cherry gold.  Love the blue cheese swirled in their brandied cherry juice - it's a party in your mouth!  I noticed another review was unhappy that her cheese did not include crackers or bread and she had to ask for it 1/2way through.  It's too bad about the confusion - the cheese plate does not come with crackers or bread, although the waiter will happily provide some if asked.  The cheese is paired with three different sweet flavors - the cherries are very expensive and they provide one per person along with some of the awesome cherry juice.  Amazing flavor!

For our next course we tried the Bavette Cartierra - if you like simple foods made with the freshest ingredients, locavore style, then this is for you.  Fresh cherry tomatoes from Molto Mario's Farmer's Market, cooked until they pop.  The juice from these fresh tomatoes is what makes the sauce for this pasta dish along with thin slices of garlic.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.

I should mention that Luke made a phenomenal wine suggestion:  2003 Nino Negri sfursat.  We've been dying to try this grape - it's made like an amarone but with the nebbiolo grape instead.  Enjoying good wine is one of my most favorite things to do - and this was one of those eyes closed, savor the moments kind of wine.  Thanks Luke!

The wine paired beautifully with the braised pork shoulder with an apple reduction served with cucumbers.  Cucumbers?!?!  Who would've thought, but they were a really nice accompaniment!

We finished with two digestiv that were perfect and then the olive oil gelato.  Mmmmm....

There are a few reviews that were disappointed this wasn't a fancier restaurant.  An enoteca is a casual place - just as this is.  There is seating inside, but the patio seating is fun and great for people watching.  If you're looking for good quality, fresh ingredients, then try it!

We actually had to push our reservation back by an hour because we were delayed in AZ and they were more than happy to do that for us.  We also arrived before two of the members of our party and they were happy to seat us at our table.  

We ordered drinks to start and our friends arrived.  At this point it seemed as if we had several servers, which I normally don't mind- in fact I rather enjoy it, but there was no flow with these servers.  Nobody really knew what anyone was doing until we finally were able to mention to the one server we preferred him.  They took away our bread plates before we even had a chance to have bread and we asked for them back and they told us we didn't need them because the salads were coming right out.  Um, oookkkk.  For the record, the salads took a while.  (But were very good.)

The service picked got better as the night went on but I have to say I was really unimpressed.  It was definitely an inexpensive option (Dinner for 5 with two bottles of wine came to $262) but it was not fast (we were there for almost three hours) and not necessarily savory.

The part that made me give this start a four star rating was the bread they gave us. The bread was individually wrapped and burnt. Also, they gave bread sticks which created unnecessary mess on the table. I was hoping for an explanation but that is still yet to be discovered. 
My friends and I started off with 7 cheeses which were phenomenal with the black truffle honey, black cherry sauce, and apricot they offered to pair with the cheese. I would highly suggest getting cheese if you love it at all. 
As entrees I had the Braised Pork Shoulder which seems to be his specialty in this restaurant.  It was very tender and the cucumbers pair amazingly well with the pork. My friends also got Lamb Ribs which were also great. The Radicchio and balsamic that went with this dish was amazing and Veal and Ricotta Meatballs which tasted mediocre and were just three huge meatballs.

1822327,2008-06-19,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"I have thought long and hard about what to say about this place and I believe that I can offer something of a fair assessment of what happened when my wife and I stopped in for an early dinner on our anniversary.

I am familiar with Batalli and his restaurants, and I knew going in that this was not supposed to be fine dining.  The dress code of business casual is not enforced at all and most Burger Kings are quieter but I expected a lively ambiance.  What I did not expect was rude and nasty service.

We walked in after calling and asking if they were taking walk-ins.  It was a nice table, we were pleased it was well out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the canal.  Our server was prompt at getting our drinks going, then all hell broke loose.

The loud and pushy manager suggested that I let him order our appetizers because I was taking my time and considering pairings with wine.  He made a suggestion that seemed reasonable, we ordered three cheeses and three meats and they were brought to the table promptly with the packaged breads and wine.  We were enjoying our appetizers when the server reappeared and said, ""we need to clear this table by 5:30, weren't you told that?""  She then pressured us to get our entree orders in right away.  I reluctantly but very angrily ordered and then the manager had the gall to reappear and ask about wines with our entrees!  I told him that I was not in any mood since I had been told I had 20 more minutes at my table.  He said loudly, ""SIR, I rearranged some of our reservations, it is fine!""  Note: He never apologized for the mistake, got loud with me when confronted with HIS mistake, then continued to try to up-sell the check by adding the wines!  This idiot is relentless.  I calmed down, ate my dinner, did order wine, and deserts and held the table for another hour and 20 minutes.  However, the experience was marred by the cattle herd mentality, rude treatment and openly pushy ""manager"" who clearly doesn't care about the dining experience.  All of this from an ""Italian"" restaurant.  If you want to rush people in and out, change the name to McDonald's. 

This place was a disappointing joke.  Chef Batalli, take your good name off of this trough.  Tourists, locals, don't reward them with your business.  Canaletto is right next door and we were treated very warmly there last time.",76w75fdI3vBfp2XUVpYqXg,0,0,1,m1TNtgBhJN-pZmBNPwK74w

Having been blessed with all of the Bay Area-n goodness that abounds - from the doorways of well traveled North Beach cafes to tiny tables in hidden neighborhood trattorias - Enoteca San Marco just didn't really stand out.   I had the Bucatini All'Amatriciana which was good, a little salty, but good.  The Gnocco Fritto - as much as I heart all things fried, these little doughy snake-shaped fried breads were a little much - after two or three, I was pretty much done. Very rich and filling. Perhaps the best part of the meal was a bite of the caramel gelato that came out for my bestie's birthday(not compliments of the house, but candlelit nevertheless).  The gelato was velvety and smooth, not overly sweet.  Skip the cinnamon gelato, it reminded me of what the milk tastes like after finishing up some Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal (unless you like that).  

Our waiter was slow and inattentive.  The other people (guy bringing us water, other people's waiters) seemed to be more concerned with our dining experience than our waiter. 

Ambience - I like the simplicity of the restaurant, but the overwhelming glare of Las Vegas tends to flood the 'outdoor' seating area.

1883579,2009-10-19,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"Wow.  I was SO disappointed in this experience.  I watch Iron Chef fairly religiously and had always thought Batali and Morimoto were the chefs to beat, and was totally looking forward to eating at a Batali restaurant while in Vegas.  So as I checked the reviews of all three of his places I noticed two were $$$$ and this one was $$ but they all got similar reviews.  Similar in that there were more dissatisfied customers than I was comfortable with.  So we decided to play it safe and test out ESM for lunch, and if it was good, check out one of the others for dinner another day.  Needless to say, this was our only Batali experience.

Our service from the hostess was great, she sat my husband and I at a four person table so we could both sit on one side and watch the ""street show"" in St. Mark's square.  One star for that.  But sadly, good service then came to a screeching halt.  We saw very little of our server throughout the rest of the meal.   He dropped off the boring cold bread and took our orders, and we didn't see him again until after our food had been removed from the table and he came back for our dessert order.  And after that was done, it took him forever again for the check.

We ordered the balsamic marinated figs to start, the gemeli pasta with house sausage and broccoli rabe as our first course, the pork shoulder as our main course, and the cactus pear sorbet and goat cheese gelato for dessert.   I absolutely LOVE figs and enjoyed this first dish very much although it wasn't particularly unique or difficult to prepare.  Half a star for the figs.  The pasta was disgusting.  I agree with everyone else who says he gives ""al dente"" a new meaning--the pasta was not cooked enough at all for my liking.  The sausage was completely flavorless, and the bitterness of the broccoli rabe completely dominated everything.  If our waiter had come back to check on us, we would have told him so.  The pork shoulder WAS good, I'll give them that, but I make an equally delicious pork shoulder in my crockpot at home for MUCH cheaper.  Another half star for the pork.  By this time my husband was trying to convince me that we didn't need to spend any more money here on dessert, but I was determined to give it one last chance.  I saw the goat cheese gelato on the menu and since I LOVE goat cheese, I figured it had to be money.  Sadly no, this dish was as bad as the pasta one.  The cactus pear sorbet was saccharine sweet and the goat cheese gelato tasted nothing like goat cheese...and they were even worse when eaten together.  We ended up eating only three or four bites of our $12 dessert.  

I am sure we must have just had horrible luck on the dishes we ordered because I am having a really hard time believing that this food was representative of Mario Batali's cooking, but I'm pretty sure everyone in the restaurant the day we were there (and we would notice whenever we passed by throughout our visit) was also receiving horrid service.  So many bored, hungry looking people straining their necks to find their server.  Inexcusable.

I wish I could say the food was actually as good as it sounded on the menu. The restaurant itself is very nice, it is located inside the Venetian and I loved the setting, the lighting, the decor and even the plating. Foodwise, I ordered the friday special of braised beef panini. It was disappointing because it was dry and the pork was rather hard. It didn't seem fresh but rather as if it was frozen and just heated up and served. I also got the three cheese platter of goat cheese, mozzarella and parmesan. This was delicious, it was served with cherries, apricot and honey and the cheese and the sweet fruits and honey went along perfectly. Sadly, the cheese plate was the only good thing from dinner.

The cute cheesy setting with its fake sky and numerous indoor street performers was entertaining, and I don't believe I've ever met a Mario Batali joint I didn't love.

I came for a leisurely lunch with my family and a few family friends, and we sat on the pseudo-patio.  Men in full make-up and stilts traipsed by, and tourists looked on amused.  For our direct appreciation, Enoteca San Marco provided paper placemats that taught us how to pick up a stranger at a Vegas club and make obscene hand signs, both in Italian.  Service was accordingly casual and friendly.

We were provided with breadsticks and a spongey herb focaccia when we sat down.  Our table then shared the caprese with burrata as well as the ""verdure grande"" for starters.  The caprese was excellent, composed of oozy cheese and bright refreshing tomatoes, topped with pine nuts and a light green dressing.  The verdure grande consisted of seven vegetable dishes in circular yellow jars for $28 - if you've ever been to Otto in New York, you've had them before.  The vegetables rotate, but on our visit we got lentils ""alla Toscana,"" roasted beets with saba, corn and tomatoes, radish in bagna cauda, marinated zucchine, eggplant caponata, and farro with pine nuts and feta.  Not every dish was spectacular, but all were decent, and I loved the lentils, beets, and corn.  The variety and freshness of the ingredients made the verdure grande worth getting.

For my entree, I couldn't pass up the cavatappi with lamb ragu, mint, and tomato.  The al dente corkscrew pasta was great, and the lamb ragu was on point, tender, well-seasoned, and meaty.  The tomato sauce was hearty and the mint added an accent of coolness that enhanced the warm flavors.  My mom's linguine con le cozze, a linguini with mussels, saffron, and marjoram, was another winning pasta.  It was very salty, but in a good way.  The pasta ended up being flavorful with minimal embellishment, and the saffron was pleasantly pronounced.  My brother's spaghettini with mushrooms, thyme, and garlic was also quite flavorful, lightly sauced but with a richness that came from the robust fragrant mushrooms.  Also good were my dad's veal and ricotta meatballs.  I love carbs, but it's hard to argue with lush, soft, juicy meatballs paired with nothing more than herbs and tomato sauce.  The only entree I didn't adore was my little brother's pizza with sausage and red peppers.  Even this was good, with zesty flavors and a thin crust, but the last time I had had Batali's pizza was at Mozza - the man sets his own bar.

For dessert, our table split two copettas, a fancy word for sundaes.  The espresso copetta came with espresso gelato, blackberry sorbetto, and fresh blackberries.  I wouldn't have thought to pair coffee and blackberries but this sundae was fantastic.  The flavors worked, and I liked that the espresso gelato had a bit of a coffee bean crunch.  The olive oil copetta was even better, boasting olive oil gelato with melon sorbetto and melon salad.  The sweet melon and the mellow salty olive oil were perfect together.  The melon salad added more ripe sugar as well as toothsome texture, and I doubt that the sundae could have been better.

I rolled out of Enoteca San Marco in the early afternoon and didn't have another full meal until the next morning.  I gambled like a fiend all night and didn't feel particularly hungry.  I love Mario for enabling both my gluttony and my extended hours spent at poker tables.  Viva Las Vegas, I say.",WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,3,2,5,noyzYn5E30ezmhJs0IVrSQ

Again, this is my second visit but my first review. Party of 4- we started with meats, cheeses, olives and bread- all was very good- especially with the marinated cherries(brandy), truffle honey and apricots. great add to the cheese selection! Especially the cherries!!! Ordered a sausage and pepper pizza to split. All good to this point. Pizza comes and Hesch grabs a piece immediately....never mind there was a lady at the table who should have been served first...luckily the hungry lady (we will call her fozzie) told Hal to stop eating the pizza. She then preceded to pull an EARRING out of the pizza! Not a simple diamond or loop- a fish hook looking spear which who knows what was pierced with that thing! Waitress is mortified when we call her over and she sees- off the table goes the pizza and in comes the train of apologetic managers....ok, a little freaked, but also a little drunk at this point as well so we carry on...new pizza comes out, jewelry free and we end evening with meatballs to split. Manager comes over with a ""complimentary"" after dinner digestive- which we all drink to be polite. Here comes the check.....with NO comp for even the pizza! Are you f'ing kidding me? Someones nose, ear, I don't want to know, piercing is in our pizza.....and you buy me a shot of shit to compensate! 

Now you see my dilemma- food was 3.5 stars and management was a 1.0- (FYI- if you read my CarneVino review- what I didn't mention was that the same group manages all of Batalli spots in Vegas- we told them story while waiting for table and they actually comp'd us 2 desserts there).",JaCV04DUXSypm571sEQRUg,0,0,3,SFuSYGyh1cTZAnCaXmAFyw

We went to Enoteca San Marco to try some of our favorite Mario Batali creations. We wanted the Cafe/Bistro experience rather than the dinner house confines. We were seated on the patio and watched the good times roll.

The wine list is amazing! While Mario features many of the well know vintners of the various Italian wine regions, he also offers his own unique blends and interpretations of classic reds and whites. If you want to pair your own pours with each course, Enoteca offers 2, 4 and 8 oz glasses so that you can determine what amount will satisfy your thirst.

The salad variations are spectacular. I had the Vinegar Maker's salad featuring prosciutto and 25 year old balsamic vinegar. The greens were bitter (in a good way) and the pine nuts and Romano cheese tied everything together.

My main course star was a braised pork shoulder with cucumbers and peppers. The meat was fork tender and the balance of cooling cucumber with spicy red peppers and crusty caramelized pork made for a perfect dish.

Dessert was a dark chocolate malt gelato that was made by the dessert devil himself. The the intensity of the bittersweet chocolate with the malted cream was frozen perfection. Add a double espresso with a hint of lemon and you will find yourself in a state of bliss that is unlike any experience I've had before.

There is so much to try at Enoteca, I can hardly wait to return. I vow to leave no carb unsampled at this little slice of Italian heaven in the Desert.",QFt2UseFdbkrmQYxLQrqlw,0,0,5,Z8kX4XKi_L-TvTDXWQlsRg

Per the instructions on the gift certificate, we presented it to the hostess.  Unfortunately, my birthday happened to fall on a holiday weekend, so she didn't think they would be able to honor our gift certificate.  However, she did go and ask, and came back with who I assume was the manager.  She was very nice, asked if we were locals, and said while they don't usually accept gift certificates on holidays, they would make an exception.  The manager then promptly led us to a table in their wine cellar.  Upon her complimenting me on my dress and inquiring as to our plans for the evening, my husband informed her that it was my birthday.

The wine cellar is a much better dining option than the too-popular ""patio"" (which is basically just the part that overlooks the fake outside that is the inside of the Venetian). More secluded, more romantic, and just fancier.

Our server was outstanding.  Very polite, very knowledgeable, and very prompt.

The pancetta and goat cheese pizza we ordered was insanely delicious.  Hands-down one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  I can't remember which pasta dish it was that we ordered, but it was great.

When I ordered gelato for dessert, it came served in a martini glass on a small plate, with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate sauce on the plate.  I was thoroughly impressed as the only person who was told it was my birthday was the manager.  It was a nice touch.

Overall, I was very happy with our dining experience and will be sure to be back.  This is a great alternative to the fancier and pricier other Batali restaurants.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,2,0,4,olwhNW8BLl4XJiC_PVxhAg

Well, this weekend we stayed at the newly opened Palazzo Hotel and ventured to find a place to eat when alas, we found this place. Ahh... we were so excited! We were speaking with the lukewarm hostess who told us the wait would be about 10 minutes (in her terms, this means 30 minutes) and that Mario himself was eating here today. She pointed him out and sure enough he was sitting with another guest, in all his spendar eating at his restaurant noted as lighter Italian cuisine. Well, we were hooked! We are foodtv followers and how great would it be to once again eat with another Iron Chef! So we get our table, and wait. First the water comes pretty quickly and so does bread wrapped in paper and the breadsticks they give us all over Italy. It's not bad, but with no oil or vinegar, it gets bland fast. Hummm... well, maybe they are going for the very casual, stand at the street corner eating type of thing here. Well, it takes another 15 minutes to get our menus from a very cold server. We could see that she was having a bad experience with several tables and we were concerned. After another 20 plus minutes, the bartender notices or is told to take out order. He is friendly and we thought we had been saved. He however, was just helping her out, she was going to come back. We ordered Processo and their signature Bellini drink and that took another 20 minutes to show up. After asking for oil and vinegar 3 times and then finally standing up and waving our arms at our server, she finally brought it out as if she had done us a grave favor. The food came and the flavors were truly excellent in every way - reminded us of Babbo, but the noodles were undercooked and thus the food was not Babbo.... I would certainly go back to that restaurant if they improve on their service. The service was just so horrible, probably the worst we have ever experienced at any restaurant in the US and out. I'm talking SO BAD! It's so sad because for a $80 lunch, it should have been so much better. We wanted to go over to Mario and tell him, but of course we didn't.

Well, when we finally found it, it turned out to be a juice bar for the spa (pretty deceptive Yelp), and so we were forced to wander about aimlessly for a while to decide on something.  Group decisions + empty tummies = lunch delays.

Finally we came to the town square and were presented with a few different options.  I quickly Yelped and came across the results of the options nearby and we chose Enoteca.

It's essentially a European style cafe with pseudo-outdoor seating (because we were actually inside, but it looked like outside on a patio).  We were seated at a table and I ordered a Peroni (one of the two beers available there, the other being Stone IPA oddly enough) while my friends and wife looked through the wine list.  The wines were pretty much all Italian and were available in 2, 4, and 8 oz pours.  They had a wine tap machine so it's easy for them to give you very accurate pours on the quick.  Unfortunately, all of the prices were ridiculously high for the wines and they were all unknown to us (being Italian wines).  Oh well.

We each ordered something for lunch as well as a cheese plate appetizer.  Here were the general thoughts:

4 cheese pizza - Tasty and more like an American pizza

Saturday special pizza - Topped with large slices of prosciutto I believe.  No tomato sauce.  Lots of cheese.  More like Italian pizza

The pasta with green beans and potatoes in a pesto sauce - Actually really good, albeit somewhat small

I know someone ordered some pasta with a red sauce of some sort and another pizza with a variety of meats and toppings was picked, too, but I don't remember the details.

Summary: The food is good but somewhat overpriced.  The wines are ridiculously overpriced.  The service is good and friendly.  You can to watch the town square performers sing opera and walk on stilts from afar.  The total for 7 people at lunch was $330 with a built in 20% gratuity (um, BS).

They brought apricots to add on and made it extra tasty.  Also had a margherita pizza and a pennette pasta with eggplant.  All quite good.  For dessert, try the salted caramel gelato...after the strange initial salt burst, it's a nice taste (if you can get past salt on gelato).

In fact I have all of Mario Batali's cookbooks and have made some of his dishes which were much better then what was going on here.

The spicy spaghetti (and what the heck about those meatballs? those are child's size!) was way salty. My grilled albacore was way overcooked and salty. But the seafood pasta was super bland.

Stop killing trees unnecessarily in an attempt to look cool...oooh unwrap your break like a gift. No thank you. 2. Don't be so stingy with the bread.

Well, every time I romp off to Vegas for the weekend, I make it a habit to stop off for a drink in the Venitian square...I love it there.  So, I heard that one of my favorite food network chefs opened a restaurant there, and so off I went....

Well, the setting was beautiful, and amusing...watching fellow tourists mosey about with gelato, live Venitan statues, and shotgun weddings.  We joined the hungry and waited for our table.  We sat by the bar and talked to a friendly bartender.  My friend and I drink different wines, so we were surprised to find such a small selection of wines by the glass.  I was in an Italian restaurant and couldn't so much as get a Pinot Grigio by the glass.  Well, the friendly bartender made some suggestions, and we were pleased with our glasses.  Further conversation found that they have an issure with attaching our bar tab with our dinner tab...seriously...we close out a tab enough in Vegas...really, twice for one dinner?

We were taken to our table and forever passed before a server appeared.  Finally, a buser came by with water and two slices of bread wrapped in paper as well as a small packaqge of dried bread sticks arrived on our table.  We did not eat as there was no butter or dipping oil.  Our waiter stopped by, busily and quickly asking, ""Have you decided yet?""  He was not concerned if we needed more to drink, needed any butter or needed any questions answered. We asked for oil and parmasean for the bread and ordered a few dishes.  When the waiter was asked to discuss the items in more detail, he did.

Now the highlight....the food was delicious!  The grilled radiccio and mozzerella salad had a sweet flavor due to the balsamic maranade.  The coliflower puree was spicey and the pasta was cooked perfectly.

My friends and I (all in our early twenties) were staying at the Venetian and after seeing this place during our walk through the Canal Shoppes and through advertisements all over the hotel/casino, we decided to check it out for dinner. I got a bad vibe when we first got there due to the fact that half the restaurant was empty and we got seated in a back corner next to the kitchen and restrooms. Maybe it was because of our age and they were saving the better seating for patrons they thought would spend/tip more? Whatever the reason, we felt completely shafted and it all went downhill from here. 

To put things in perspective, let me walk you through our dining experience. The service was downright the most negligent I've ever witness. Any request we made, not only took an extremely long time to fulfil, but we had to ask at least 3 or 4 different people each time. It was so ridiculous that I had half a mind to just do it myself. When they actually decided to grace us with their presence and do their job, the outright disrespect and apathy was palpable. Our appetizers came out AFTER our entrees did (I hate it when you get your appetizers with the meal or after because I feel as if they're trying to rush you out and/or you can't take time to enjoy yourself.). Service aside, the food itself wasn't too shabby. The entrees we ordered consisted of pork shoulder, veal meatballs, pork chops, and a pasta dish I can't remember. Nothing to write home about but ok for the most part. 

At the end of the meal, a service card came with the check and I wrote down the complaints we had. Usually I let sub par service slide because 1) I'm not bitchy enough to do anything about it and 2) it never seems worth the while. It could have been the wine that helped make this once in a lifetime complaint happen, but regardless- it was necessary. To cap the whole ordeal off, when I went to turn in the card on our way out, not only was I barely acknowledged but the card itself was merely tossed aside. I was already pretty pissed off at this point but that pushed it over the top. I called into the restaurant and filed a complaint with the manager. My friends were completely appalled at the way we were treated here and have made note to not come back for our next Vegas trip.

You can't help but love the San Marco square area within the Venetian Grand Canal shops... man-made beautiful blue skies no matter what time of day outside - it could be midnight and you would still think it's 4pm outside. Beautiful Italian architecture all around with fancy shops and restaurants with tons of outdoor seating populating this busy square. Awesome place just to be with a date or significant other. 

Enoteca is one of the restaurants where you can eat outside and dine under this cool atmosphere and people watch. (The other restaurants in this square are Canaletto and Postrio.) We decided to try this place since it is a Mario Batali place but wanted something more casual than B&B. At around 10pm on a Sat night, the square and restaurants were still bustling. We had a 20 min wait for a table but even got a nice table seated right along the edge of the eating area so it was a fantastic view of the square.

The menu is definitely more of a casual Italian bistro menu - there isn't an extensive menu - just about 8 diff pastas, a bunch of pizzas, some entrees, and numerous appetizers. (But good list of various Italian wines.)  It didn't have some of the standard Italian restaurant choices like linguine with clams, lasagna, etc but did have some more original offerings. We got the baby pasta tubes with eggplant  in tomato sauce (~$14) and that looked very simple but so tasty. Similarly the large rigatoni tubes with only cauliflower puree and chili flakes (~$14) was very simple but so tasty with a nice kick from the chili flakes. Portions were definitely modest and could leave a very hungry person unsatisfied. However, I guess Batali really believes in simplicity and not huge portions. BTW, the bread was very crusty and came with excellent extra virgin olive oil for dipping.

Service was very good overall, spotty at times. We did like to attention to detail when we got some wine and the waitress looked at one of our wine glasses and decided to replace it since it was not perfectly shiny (looked fine to me).

One of my friends chose the restaurant because she wanted Italian at a moderate price. In those two regards, Enoteca San Marco met our expectations, but in terms of amazing service or quality of food, I was totally let down. Sure the food was fresh, but it didn't have any wow factor at all.

First, you have multiple servers throughout the meal (I think we had about five during our meal) - I much prefer having only one or two servers that I can build a relationship with throughout the course of the meal. My group started with a cheese plate (burrata, fontina, and parmigiano reggiano) which came with three different items for us to dip the cheese in (the group's favorite was the honey). For my dinner, I had the Bavette Cacio e Pepe, which is really just pasta with black pepper and cheese in olive oil. It was very basic, but the pasta was very fresh. Two of my dining companions had the spaghetti and meatball special, which they both loved especially because the meatballs were spicy; another friend had the spaghetti and zucchini in olive oil special which she said was very fresh; and my other friend had the butternut squash and braised pork shoulder. While we all enjoyed our meals, we were not wowed at all. However, our dessert did have us raving - we shared cream puffs and each of the three had a gelato flavor of our choosing. The almond gelato cream puff was by far our favorite.

While my portion of the wine and meal after trip was $48 which I didn't think was that bad, I can't say I was very impressed with Mario Batali after visiting Enoteca San Marco and I am not running to go visit another of his restaurants anytime in the near future.

The cheese platters come with three sauces, chili flakes with tangerine almost like a jelly, black cherries in a brandy infused sauce and black truffle infused honey. I know....the combinations sound strange but they are sooooo good and work very well with the cheese. After coming here a year ago, I usually eat brie with honey but its just not the same. 

This restaurant is located in the plaza area of the shopping row in the Venetian so it is in an open atmosphere. It reminded me of the little eateries in Rome. I haven't had anything else at this restaurant except the cheese platter so my review is very limiting.

wifey started off with a drink made from fresh strawberries and raspberries, a splash of sparkling water, and grappa.  YUMMY!!!  it was very refreshing and perfect for a lunchtime beverage.

we started off by ordering a cheese platter consisting of 3 different types...instead of choosing, we asked our server to pick out her top 3.  i have no clue what they're called...but all 3 were awesome!  we were also served focaccia bread with 3 sides...brandied cherries, truffled honey, and dried apricots with chile.  the truffled honey was my absolute favorite!  i wanted to order a carne platter also...but that would just be too much food for us...i couldn't help but stare at the other tables around us that did order the variety of meats...and i loved how the workers in the middle of the restaurant were slicing cheeses and meats right in front of us.  that definitely made it a very personalized experience!

so we decided to order one pasta platter...and one meat platter.  we ordered the veal bolognese which was the special of the day...and i'm such a sucker for meatballs...so we ordered the veal meatballs also.  my goodness, the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente...olive garden, macaroni grill, and all those other chain pasta restaurants need to learn exactly what al dente is...mario's definitely mastered the art of cooking the perfect pasta.  the sauce that came along with it was perfect...light, simple, and flavorful...pretty dang close to what they serve in italy.  the veal meatballs were the best meatballs i have ever had!!!  they were moist, seasoned perfectly, and the duo of sauces on the plate complemented them perfectly.  gosh. everything was so yummy.  

for dessert, we ordered the china ranch date...tempura dates, vanilla bean gelato, and local honey.  i've never had fried dates before...and i was sooooo sad when we ran out!  the gelato is made fresh at the restaurant...perfect consistency...

the service was perfect.  our server had personality, suave, and was definitely on top of things.  kudos to her.

One of my dinner companions ordered the Penne Alla Norma and of course the penne pasta was perfectly al dente as well.  The sauce was balanced perfectly and the eggplant gave a burst of flavor.

The spaghettini was also very good with the mushrooms giving a burst of flavor to each bite.

We were seated almost immediately, love that it gives the illusion of outside seating, and you get to enjoy the hotel performances while there. 
You also have the option of seating at the ""bar"", which also gives you view to the performances. 
They start by bringing you some cracker/bread sticks & water. Then comes your server to get your drink order and let you know about the day's specials. Wine list is extensive and some are even serve starting at 2oz in case you want to do a sampling... 
Then a bread basket is brought to the table, and let me tell you, you will have to apply a lot of self control to only have one. It's warm, fool of flavor and it complements anything you order perfectly. 

We all ordered something different so we could try more things. I had the Gemelli and it was good, LOVED that it had spinach and broccoli mixed in with the pasta. But the best one I would have to say was the Penne alla Norma, if I'm ever back (and I wish I am) I'll order this.

We followed with two classic Italian pasta dishes. Cacio e Pepe and

- Caprese salad: just ok, but the pesto was tasty.
- Pancetta and goat cheese pizza: good pizza. You can't go wrong w/ pancetta, goat cheese and carmelized onions.

The setting is gorgeous: a faux Piazza San Marco that is always sunny, but not hot, and only one well behaved pigeon. The cafe, itself is charming with faux outdoor seating and a magnificent refrigerated tower for cheese and salumi. If only the food and service matched this santized version of Venice, we would be singing its praises.

The service is the poster child for LVSS (Las Vegas Service Syndrome -- ""I will never see you again, so you are just an annoyance that must be dealt with"" -- they do not rely upon regulars like most restaurants). The hostess exuded boredom as we approached her station. Our server was sluggish, coughed incessantly, was unfamiliar with the cheeses, and generally could care less. Being in the industry, we were appalled. We tried being extra nice, but no amount of warmth could encourage a glint of caring.

The food is pretty good. They use quality ingredients, but again, no one really cares or has passion for food. The pizza is OK, but not wood fired. The pasta (I had the bucatini) was good but nothing exciting. We ordered a portion of wine listed as 250ml which is about 8oz and it was not even close.

I am so disappointed. My husband and I were in Vegas for the weekend, and for our eating out pleasure, he picked Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and I chose your Enoteca San Marco. In the Iron Chef of our dining choices, you got whupped. I mean, sure, if someone parked a boatload of money outside of my house, I'd let them slap my name and picture on whatever they wanted. But I had expected more of you.

The food was, at best, so-so. Incredibly salty (I am speaking especially of the prosciutto balls and the lentils), not exactly attractively presented, and accompanied by the worse bread I have ever had the misfortune of being insulted with. I felt like Oliver twist, trying to break off a cold hunk of charred dough to eat, plain, until I could flag  down our waiter for some olive oil.

Oh, and in the past, on the rare occasion when the wine I select is unavailable, I've always been offered the closest similar bottle at the same price (if it was more expensive). You should think about this if your wine list isn't going to be current.

I don't have unreasonable expectations for this sort of casual dining, and I know you are an awesome chef, Mario, but this place is an embarrassment to your good name.",qrvWjg7rWZsA4j0eju6w_A,2,0,2,mM45ovQz7a9eoLWbzjoJ2g

3700300,2011-01-18,1,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"First time eating at a Mario Batali restaurant, and I was not disappointed.  What made the dishes so great were the quality of the ingredients and the care and attention to perfectly seasoning each dish.  All the dishes were simple and fresh.  We got some Italian breadsticks to begin with, service was fast and helpful, and ambience wonderful since you're sitting outside in the St. Mark's square of the Venetian.
 
Here's what we got:
3 cheeses- Burrata, Mozzarella di Bufalo, Parmesana Reggiano- cheeses were good, not the best I've had but good enough.  What made this appetizer amazing was the condiments that accompany the cheese and bread- 3 small dishes of black truffle honey (amazingggg), candied apricot (with chili flakes) and candied dark cherries (SO fresh, dark and sweet, it just popped and zinged in your mouth, like someone hand-picked and pitted cherries that are all the same size).  Honey was really good with the burrata, cherries were good with the parmesan.
 
Margherite pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil- I don't know how they got the crust so crispy especially when served right out of the oven and onto a plate, but the crust stayed crispy throughout our entire meal, with a thin layer of flavorful, ripened tomato sauce and large chunks of melted fresh mozzarella cheese and a fresh, good-sized basil leaf to bring the flavors together so nicely.
 
Rigatoni with pork belly and swiss chard- The rigatoni was perfectly al dente, soft with a nice chewy finish and the pork belly sauce was really good.  It was shredded pork belly simmered in its own sauce with a nice blend of the chard.  It was a tad bit salty but overall very good.
 
Roasted cauliflower side dish- I love, love love roasted cauliflower so when I saw it on the menu, I had to get it!!  It was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of olive oil so it wasn't swimming in it (which is normally what you get when you order roasted vegetables).  You could taste the freshly cracked black pepper, and it was topped with freshly chopped basil and roasted hazelnuts, which gave the dish a nice crunchy, nutty flavor.
 
Blueberry Coppette- Blueberry sorbetto, cinnamon gelato, oatmeal cookie crisp and sliced blueberries on top, all made in-house.  I was impressed with how fresh, smooth and full of flavor the gelato/sorbetto was- not a single icy granule or dull bite!!
 
I can't wait to go to Vegas again to order the same exact meal.  I wouldn't change anything I got except maybe to order more (the Rigatoni with roasted cauliflower on the table next to us looked amazing, and the guy eating it commented on how it must have been made with some expensive, extra gourmet cheese!).  I think anything you get on the menu is going to be good.

On her suggestion. I ordered the Arancine which was tasty, nothing spectacular and a bit greasy.  For my salad (again as suggested), I ordered the Coppa with pear and arugula. The Coppa (dried pork shoulder) was way too chewy and really did not mix well with the sliced pear and apples. It was just ok and overpriced at $14 for a salad.

My entree was a braised pork shoulder that although extremely fatty, it was tasty and done well. My issue with the entree is that the table server (not my waitress) brought it out while I was still eating my salad. I was told that the kitchen is way ahead because it was slow, no excuse!

No dessert, just the check please.  Grand total, $90 with tax and tip. Way overpriced even for Mario Batali. High praise for my waitress, so-so on the food, a bit overpriced.  The setting is very nice as you sit in the main square and get to watch the mime and several other shows.

I was really hungry at the time and I decided to pig out on some pizza.  Since I had a $10 restaurant.com coupon here that required a minimum order of 2 pizzas, I figured it would be a nice option for dinner.

I decided on ordering the Prosciutto and Arugala Pizza ($19) and the Roasted Pepper and House Sausage Pizza ($20).  I've seen pics of these two pizzas on yelp and wanted to give them a try.

Sadly, my dinner was interrupted when I started to have a bloody nose shortly after they brought my pizzas to my table.  One of them I noticed was the wrong pizza, instead of the Prosciutto and Arugala Pizza they gave me their Pancetta and Goat Cheese Pizza which I had before and wasn't too thrilled about it.  I scrambled to their washroom and spent about 15 mins in there waiting for the bleeding to stop.  So the by the time I got back to my table, my pizzas were cold.

I asked the waiter to make sure that I was given the right pizza and then he said that it was the Prosciutto and Arugala Pizza with Mozzarella Cheese.  I took a bite into the pizza and it was definitely Goat Cheese.  The waiter was totally off on that one.  Then another waiter came up to me to check on me since I was having a bloody nose earlier.  I then asked her about the pizza and then she assured me that it was the Pancetta and Goat Cheese pizza.  I told her I was brought the wrong pizza so I had to wait another 15 mins to bring out the correct pizza.  Which was fine since I already had the Roasted Pepper and House Sausage Pizza to work on (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=hdaDDC6i58soUOfNb2cz5w).

Despite being cold, the Roasted Pepper and House Sausage Pizza was still pretty good.  I already knew the Sausage would be good as I had it on a pasta dish during my last visit.  On a pizza it was just as good.  It was definitely the better of the two pizzas.  The Prosciutto and Arugala Pizza looked good when they finally brought it out (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=P8m1uIhmDN9A9hEvWnP9Tw), but it was really salty compared to the other pizza.  Unfortunately, I wasn't really blown away by both pizzas.

Otto this time was a very awkward experience.  I can't blame them for the bloody nose, but the Pizza mix-up was inexcusable.  This mistake however won't prevent me from coming back here again.

We each ordered something different and a cheese tasting plate to start. I had a fresh berry drink and white wine was served to my friends for dinner. Because the server did not come back to pour, he gave my friends the bottle for free. Manners are everything and never taken for granted.

Our server soon noticed the lack of music, and the Cure started playing just loud enough to make the 6 of us need to raise our voices to communicate.  We were promised focaccia bread before our wine order, and my mother in law was served 125ml of wine, though assured a new bottle would be opened and she'd receive the other 125ml.  After placing our salad and dinner order, we had to remind our server to bring both, which he eventually did.

I had the braised pork shoulder and my father had the chicken paillard, which were both excellent.  The pasta was fresh, though my wife found hers to be a bit bland and heavier than she's used to.  My father in law's pizza was ok.

About half way through dinner, I would have liked another glass of wine, but no one had come around in a while.  By the end of the meal, I really would have liked more water, too.

Our server magically reappeared to take dessert orders, with which we all ordered coffee.  I was certain by then that he had noticed the lack of water and I would be replenished.  It is the desert.

Desert came, all good gelati and sorbets.  I asked for water.  As we finished, the manager(?) brought us the bill.  I do not know where our waiter went or why we hadn't gotten our coffee or a single refill on water.  He came back and said there was a glitch and comped our coffees.  I asked for water again, which eventually arrived with the coffee.  Since we were a party of 6, there was an automatic 20% gratuity.

The food was good, but it could not outshine the lack of service.  I usually discount poor service reviews, as I think it's a pretty individualized experience.  But, as someone who has worked in all types of restaurants, I find it telling that multiple staff members need to be reminded several times to bring bread, water, coffee, and the remainder of what was ordered.  Our server absolutely disappeared for all intents and purposes.  So why am I paying 20%, which is a pretty good tip? If we had been a smaller group and gotten this kind of service, he'd be lucky to get 10%.

Save your money.  There are a lot of restaurants here that would like your business and can provide equally good food, like Rosemary's.  We will not return to San Marco.",8TK02Ohjhgm6pPrVLQICXw,0,0,2,ZEdyYBk9glVrB1Ca9bzlCQ

It would would have been even more exciting if Mario himself was there doing the cooking.  But nonetheless, we enjoyed a nice meal before catching our 10:30PM show of ""O"". 

I had the linguine with mussels, seasoned with saffron and marjoram.  The risotto balls. 

Couldn't resist the fresh gelato for dessert, so we ordered 3 flavors: vanilla bean, the very rich, chocolaty chocolate, and apple basil (!). I'd recommend NOT to try apple basil, unless you're very curious, as the basil was a too overpowering. I normally love cooking with herbs, but a herb flavored ice cream?......not so great.

The food was wowza, off the charts. We started with a 3 cheese tray that consisted of Fontina, Parmesan and something else... it comes with honey, spicy apricots and brandied cherries. (No, they won't let you drink the brandy out of the jar, damnit!) Cheese was awesome. I don't think we even touched the bread, once the cheese came out. I don't know about all the bread complaints. Despite the fact that it had a very dark, well-done crust, I think it's a stretch to call it burned. Probably think your glass is half-empty if you call the bread burned. I had some sort of pizza. It was on the back of their menu, where they have their pasta and pizza of-the-day selection, below the cheeses. Other person in my party had the carbonara. My pizza had some sort of ham-thickness meat, arugula and tepanade. It was an thin crust pizza, that was more than large enough for one person. I wasn't too hot on the carbonara, but it was still quite good. I'd probably try other items, myself. I didn't like the fact that they have small, expensive wine pours. Their wine list's cheapest bottle is $32, average around $90, up to $400. Ok, I don't have a problem buying a $32 bottle of wine. But if I buy the cheapest bottle, I look like the cheapest patron. Anyway, I'd appreciate cheaper drinks. Other than the goofy wine list, I found it to be just awesome. In fact, I plan on visiting again. Maybe they can start charging a corkage fee for my 40 oz'rs. Staff was also great. They were very friendly and actually kept a good pace with the food and drinks coming out. I really appreciate that, especially at a nice location like this.

The Venetian is designed all funky, so the buildings aren't in your standard square blocks. They could be around nooks and crannies. I m glad we finally found Entoeca, because its exactly the carbs we needed to fill up on. 

I came across this place via Restaurants.com's 80% coupon discount and thought it would be a decent spot to check out. We got here around 4pm, which was the perfect time to find a seat being that its neither lunch or dinner. The server was very friendly, and she even took her sweet time explaining the menu items. It was written in Italian and hard to figure out. So we ended up ordering a Monte Cresto, a full sized Margaretta Pizza, Risotto and a dish of spaghetti. Believe it or not, we did not have any left overs. 

Enoteca isn't your typical Italian restaurant, it features food from the Mediterranean. So from what I can tell it did have a unique taste in all their ingredients. I love the atmosphere of sitting out in the courtyard areas of the Venetian. It made me feel like we were actually on the streets of Italy... but not really.

After feeling like a million bucks from playing a heater at craps, we all decided to go for a nicer dinner in the Venetian. We settled on this restaurant because the prices were decent for the variety of food they offered. I was never a big fan of Mario Batali, but when I do think of him, I think that he would (should) know Italian food. We were quickly seated at a round table enough to fit a large group, which was nice. The service was top notch as we were quickly given paper-wrapped bread (nice and soft) and some thin bread sticks. The waiter was also very enthusiastic to help us take a picture. My sights quickly turned to the menu, but I didn't really see anything stand out so I settled on something that I know and love - pizza. 

All the other pizzas were your standard so I decided to try something different - clams. What came out was extremely disappointing. I can't believe they would offer a pizza that tasted like this at this type of restaurant. The cheese was very rubbery and the clams were still in their shells (probably for presentation, but not very practical at all). The clams were tiny and didn't provide the pizza with any flavor. All I tasted was extreme saltiness. The clams were not even cleaned because I felt gritty sand between my teeth, which is one of the worst feelings to have when eating. I didn't even taste the chili that was supposed to be on the pizza. Overall, it lacked substance and flavor. I tried some other pizzas including the prosciutto arugula and the margherita both of which were better. I think my favorite was the margherita with the basil.

3966043,2009-08-04,1,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"Oooh my very first Mario Batali restaurant! I actually wanted to try his B&B Ristorante, but we were going for something casual and quick that afternoon. Located in the piazza of The Venetian sits Enoteca San Marco. The wait was a bit long even with reservations, so we ended up sitting at the ""bar."" We were able to watch them prepare the sliced cured meats and the vegetables.

The waiter suggested the fried cauliflower appetizer. I'm not a fan of cauliflower but what they hey. I've only known him for 10 seconds but I trust the dude. We went with a zucchini pasta which I don't see on their online menu.

While waiting for your food to come out, they give you two types of breads. Bread sticks and two slices of cut bread. I only tried the cut bread. Super soft like marshmallows. None of them were seasoned or flavored. It didn't even come with olive oil. Just butter. The bread wasn't even hot enough to melt the butter.

I was able to try the fried zucchini appetizer and the smashed fried potatoes. I'm not sure how I feel about the fried zucchini. It came in sliced strips, but the batter just wasn't tickling me happy. It was indeed nuked, but it didn't leave a heavy feeling in my stomach. There wasn't much taste to it, tasted like zucchini and batter. No flavor! The smashed fried potatoes were delicious. They were red potatoes in what tasted like were oven roasted, sprinkled with olive oil, thyme, and salt. They looked hard but I was able to easily smash them in my mouth.

When the fried cauliflower came out I first thought, ""Aww how cute! Mini fried cauliflowers!"" Then I remembered how grosse I thought cauliflower was. I went in with an open mind and took my first bite. Eyes closed. To my surprise, it was actually REALLY good. It was a light batter, and it seemed as though it had a very thin slice of onion wrapped around it. Inside was the super soft cauliflower and what tasted like herb flavored mushy cheese. Alright so my description might not make it sound good, but it was definitely finger-licking good. I wish I took a picture, but I finished them off before I remembered to get my camera.

Oh yeah. We had the best experience with the violinists playing behind us by the shops. It calmed our moods as we were eating on a time crunch. The soft music just made us relax and slowed us down so we could enjoy our meal.

Our zucchini pasta finally came out. I hate not having the actual name of these dishes. It doesn't sound as appetizing. Unfortunately, having the actual name of this dish might not help anything. My friend said the pasta was so dry. It didn't have any sauce. It was spaghetti, tomatoes, and sliced zucchini. The tomatoes were probably the best part of this dish. They were salty and full of flavor. I wish the pasta had more of it. The portions are already small but between a friend and I, we still had leftovers. We even offered it to our friends but they didn't want it.

This place is a great place to grab a quick bite. Prices are very affordable. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't all that spectacular or memorable. I'm still willing to try out his other restaurants. Hopefully we'll have better results.",yhJ1SVBSjC_R2viEh5AbUA,1,1,3,I_evAoGKwJ1S035M4TUa5w

We called ahead for reservations and were seated inside of ten minutes after arriving, and soon after were greeted by our supposed waiter, ""Rafael"" [1], who placed a dry, paper-wrapped piece of bread on the table, along with a store-bought pack of dry bread sticks - the thin, cracker kind. Unopened. In the pack. I hope they kept the receipt. 

The bread was accompanied by zero condiments. No butter. No olive oil. Only after flagging someone down and asking were we brought olive oil and balsamic - by a completely different server, by the way. From this server we ordered the most bland three-cheese plate we've ever tried. Three completely boring and uninspired  wedges that basically served as nothing more than vehicles to get the (admittedly good) ""local"" honey into my mouth. From yet another server, we ordered our dinner. Crispy duck for me, and a prosciutto and arugala flatbread pizza for my guest. While we waited (and waited...) with *zero* attention, the table next to us, having been seated afterwards and full of young women, was being attended to by our original waiter with frequency. If our table had been traded away to another server, we certainly were not notified.

My duck was alright - I'm guessing it was simply deep fried and thrown on my plate, as creativity was lacking. The flatbread was the worst we've ever had. Arugala and prosciutto can be a very interesting and strong-tasting combination. Not this one. I'm not sure where they get their meats, but this was about as bland as I've ever tasted. 

We were through with this place, and just wanted to go. Not *once* did our server come over since seating us (and yes, he was our waiter, not just a captain). We then proceeded to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes, clearly finished with our meals. We were seriously considering just leaving, that's how insulted we were by the lack of attention. Especially given that the table right next to us was getting tons of it from our waiter, and we sat, ready for our check, ignored. Finally, we were able to flag our waiter down (after multiple tries with him nearly running past us) and asked for our check. I'm typically a very generous tipper. This tip? $0. Noted as such on the check: ""A tip requires service."" An absolute joke of a restaurant, especially if Batali is attaching his name to it. 

[1] Rafael my butt. Giving your waiter an Italian sounding name doesn't give you authenticity or class. Or good service, for that matter. No doubt his real name was Joe.",pFCrJCfkexBRyceQVwLNdA,4,1,1,jtFkUsoInnCe8FJcZWc_6g

I usually start with the soup, which of course varies by day but always tastes fabulous. For my main course I nearly always get the Quattro Formaggi Pizza. It's a four cheese Margherita style pizza that will easily fill one person up. Our last time at Enoteca San Marco we enjoyed a bottle of 2008 Casmatta Toscana Indicazione. It was a rather inexpensive Chianti but paired extremely well with the pizza. Last but certainly not least is the fresh homemade Gelato. There are always standard flavors but each night there is also a ""special choice flavor"".

One of my favorite aspects of eating at Enoteca San Marco is the atmosphere. The ""open air"" patio stays in a perpetual state of evening so even when I've dined there right before closing it still feels like it's 5:00pm. During the day and early evening the small performance space next to the restaurant is alive with music, theater and sideshows. Speaking as someone who has been to Venice and loves Venice, this plaza is the closest thing I can find without getting to Italy. The Venetian really seems to go out of it's way to make your experience a good one.

Once I have finished eating at Enoteca San Marco, I am always pleased to find myself full and in the middle a wonderful shopping mall. The shopping area is quite expansive and allows me to ""walk off the calories"" I just enjoyed.

Once again, if you are looking for a delicious dining experience in the heart of Las Vegas, Enoteca San Marco is the place to be!",TaMcyPWOZ1L8odTq0p7srg,0,1,5,6qD162Owr7hhTHXt-Y4QXw

The waiters, managers, and host staff here are attentive and delightful.  But the prices and food do not warrant more than two stars.  

I've been to the Batali-Bastianich mecca known as Babbo in NYC, but I completely cannot and will not compare the two restaurants.  Batali definitely has a way with pastas, and they do shine here at ESM, but it's not enough.  The prices are ridiculous for the amount of food you are given.  Even with a $18 plate of pasta, it cannot possibly be shared unless you're a size 0 model who doesn't mind just nibbling on the plated parsley.  This is all so ironic seeing as how Batali's appetite is so...ahem...bountiful.

Final word:  If you want to be full and not feel completely robbed, walk across the way to Postrio and refuel there for your Vegas excursion.",9evBY29V9r-5bL7868v8JQ,0,0,3,-cBG2UL_4wcJvYZKuOltdw

Breadsticks & bread while we were waiting were good and as expected.

Appetizer: We tried the fried calzone and prosciutto balls.  The calzone wasn't as expected.  It didn't have any marinara sauce inside, but just a bunch of ricotta cheese.  It wasn't fried very well either.  Too oily.  The proscuitto balls were fried well, but wayy too salty.

Entrees:
*Bucatini pasta with tomato/cured pork/onion - sauce is tasty.  pasta is cooked very al dente, and is extremely good.  small portion, but good!
*Braised pork shoulder with apple reduction and cucumber - large entree with tons of pork shoulder.  inconsistency in the tenderness of the pork though.  some pieces were very tender and tasted great, others were pretty dry and harder to eat.  the outside glaze on the pork was good.  plan on sharing this dish, unless you love tons of pork!

The bread was quite tasty ~ yes it's free and you can get more. Overall the prices weren't that bad. The scene was nice and calm with lots of people around. They do have a huge wine selection, which is great!

The cured meats, o dear it was delicious as well. I def suggest you trying that as well as their wine. 

The water, they have different kids, tap, sparkling, spring, etc. Comes in a cool bottle, sorry you can't take it home, but it tastes really fresh like Voss water. 

I made reservations ahead of time, this place can definitely get paid because it's by all the shopping stores, and it's quite nice to look up to see the painted clouds.

Sitting ""outside"" in the Canal area at the Venetian is beautiful, the people watching and the performers are fun too.  

To start off they gave us this bread but it was burnt?? The waiter tells us that ""the crust is suppose to be that way."" hmmm?? okay? I didn't get it, it tasted like burnt bread to me. 

We ordered an Insalate- grilled radicchio with smoked mozzarella. This was good the cheese was baked on top with the crispy radicchio at the bottom. Yummy!

As the main entrees we had the Gemelli - house sausage and broccoli rabe. I love the gemelli noodles they were cooked perfectly, texture was just right and they had a unique shape. The other dish was the Bavette Cacio e Pepe- black pepper and percorino. A very simple dish however, full a flavor you can really taste the noodles but it was a salty. 

The portions seem small when you look at them compared to how much pasta you get at other restaurants but, I was stuffed by the end of lunch. And you should be with a $50 lunch tab.

In fact, if I focus on this, I can almost forget the taste of smoke in my mouth, the toothless guy with the cracked hands that kept grabbing my arm, and the horrendousness of my off-the-strip suite in hell.  

I loved the feel of sitting on the ""patio"" in the square. I loved the fried squash blossoms - the bit of ricotta was completely unexpected and delicious and I can't wait to have it again.

The blood orange cosmo was divine, not at all syrupy like other cosmos, and it lacked the bitter after taste I sometimes get with cosmos made with orange vodka. 

And then there's the pizza. I'm giving up pizza for a month because the Pancetta with carmelized onions and goat cheese was as good as pizza gets. The tomato sauce was fantastic, a little tangy, which I adored. The goat cheese wasn't too earthy like goat cheese sometimes is, and well, how can you go wrong with pancetta and onions? The crispy thin crust was still chewy, too. Hooray! 

Seriously, when in the Venetian, head down here in the afternoon, ideally just before the mimes start a performance (ask for a seat that allows a view) and order yourself a glass or two of Prosecco or some blood orange cosmos. Order the pizza (any will do) and try yourself some fried squash blossoms...you'll thank me.

Another tip: Don't go to any off-the-strip buffets, even if 16 of your friends are going there for dinner. You'll regret everything about that decision.",kvHG1dMAoLivEfXs10YA9w,3,1,4,nVsQjKSKMLG1UR_3hy-h_Q

I thought.. if he's the chef with the highest winning record on Iron Chef, he's got to be awesome.  So sure.. I'll shell out the Las Vegas prices and try his amazing Italian food.

I went here because B&B was closed.  It is in a cute setting.. you feel like you're in Italy sitting in a square.  The menu is overpriced.  I think it was like $3 for a slice of carpaccio.. seriously?

Bread wasn't even fresh and warm.. it was pre wrapped and burnt (well the first one was).  And you have to ask for olive oil and cheese.  Why does this not come standard?

We ordered the braised pork shoulder which is the staff's favorite (according to our waiter) and the carbonera (daily special for pasta).  The braised pork shoulder was okay.. not really tender and not really uniform in tenderness.  Some really tough parts and some not.. and a little too sweet.  The cucumbers that came with it were good.  

And the pasta.. was okay.  $25 for a small plate of pasta?  Really?  And it wasn't even meaty or amazing.  That cost about $1 to make and they made $25 from it.

4884733,2010-10-11,3,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"Enoteca got very close to getting a 2-star rating, but I hate to rate a place with good quality food with such a low rating.  The food at Enoteca is very good, but the pricing and portions are just ridiculous.  The service is usually pretty good, although I have had a couple bad service experiences here.  I have been to Enoteca over 10 times, but it's primarily because I would be visiting friends who want to eat somewhere in Venetian.

The food at Enoteca is very good.  Their Pork Shoulder is one of their best dishes, and is very flavorful.  The salumi's are all made and cured in house, and you can tell when you eat them.  The pasta's all have great flavor, and are relatively affordable.  The main complaint I have here is portion size.  Now I'm not the type that goes to a three-star michelin rated restaurant and gets mad because I only have two shrimp in one of my courses, but when I go to a casual, laid back Italian restaurant, and am paying $18 for a bowl of pasta, I expect the bowl to be at least half-way full.  One of my favorite pasta dishes is spaghetti with olive oil, garlic, red chile flakes, and pecorino cheese.  They have this dish on the menu for $18, which is a very pricey for this dish, but I love the flavors so I got it.  The bowl had one small pile of noodles in the middle of the bowl, I would guess about a 4 oz. serving of pasta.  This isn't just one dish, either.  Everything is under-portioned and overpriced.  

There is also another thing that bothers me about Enoteca.  No Corkage allowed.  You could be on your deathbed and only want ONE wine to eat with your last meal at Enoteca, and if they don't have it on the menu, you can't drink it.  To a person who drinks a lot of wine like me, this is an insult to the customer.  Mario Batali claims, ""my restaurants have wine in every price range"".  But this is a bullshit excuse because, as a wine drinker, I want certain wines with certain meals, and will base my meal around my wine a lot of the time.  I am extremely disappointed in Mario Batali for not allowing a corkage fee, but love good food too much to stop going to his restaurants.  

This being said, I wouldn't suggest Enoteca unless you are trying to spend a little less, but still get a good meal.  Just don't expect to bring your own wine!",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,2,2,3,CgtOc8jy6GyjAwDsTNF15w

I wanted to like this place. I really did. The wine was fantastic, the service was fabulous. Wish I could say the same about the food. 

They don't seat people early. So we were seated a few minutes after 8. No problem, we were hanging out at the bar anyways. 

We were greeted with a smile and individually packed crunchy bread sticks. Awesome. 

We ordered a cheese plate with five varieties. It came with three dipping sauces. I prefer the cheese without the sauce. Maybe that's just me. 

We've heard great things about the prosciutto balls. An order comes with six. It's salty. Very salty. Didn't go down well at all. 

Then we had the crispy duck. More like burnt, overcooked duck with no flavor except charred meat. And there was barely any meat.

Ordered a bottle of the Bastianich 2004 ""Joe's Rosso"" because for $35, who can refuse? Plus, I'd heard about the label, and it turned out that old Joe did not disappoint.

I had arrived at The Venetian to see my lady pal perform some neosoul flavored jazz at the V Bar, but I was starving! My game plan was to run inside Grand Lux and grab a salad, but the place was slammed. MAGIC is in town, and Chinese New Year is in full swing, so the town is busy (Go Las Vegas!), but that means big restaurant crowds. I started wandering about hoping to forage some greens. I stopped by the hostess stand at David Burke's to ask where a lady could find a nice salad. I felt a tad guilty about asking them to send me somewhere else, but Mr. Burke only offered me a Caesars. They suggested San Marco or Postrio. 

Forward to me at the bar at San Marco with my $14 Acetaia ""Vinegar Maker's Salad"". A solid, but not too creative, salad. As salads go, it got the job done of giving me my daily dose of greens, and I really liked the dressing. Brilliant tartness. I declined the ham, which normally comes on the salad, but I imagine that would be quite good if you ate pigs. The salad is supposed to be an Italian chef salad, so it also had chopped eggs and cucumbers. Interesting note: The outdoor bar seats actually surround the salad prep, so you get to see all of the salads being made, but you don't get to order your liquor from a friendly bartender.

It was good, but of course one has to wonder about a $14 salad. If I had other dishes, I might be prompted to go up or down a star, but I was very satisfied with the quality of the food and the Vegas ambiance. Service was pleasant. I did see a lady a couple of seats down send a dish back with apologies from the waiter, but the businessmen next to me seemed very pleased with their meals, although they seemed suspicious as to why I was there eating a salad by myself.

5279922,2009-10-11,1,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"See Blog for full review:  

Arriving first, my contorti dish consisted of 8 large figs ""agrodolce"" cured in balsamic vinegar - at only $6 the dish was a steal and tasted wonderful with the sweetness of the figs proving a substantial match for the sour and acidic vinegar.  No pits, no stems, soft flesh and crispness to the skin - all told, excellent.

Waiting only a short time my next arrival was the salad - or at least the dish listed as a salad.  Entitled Due Uova the plate was certainly overpriced at $14 but the taste/flavor certainly made up for it.  Featuring a creamy and rich risotto cake flash fried and filled with cheese the dish was next topped with a farm fresh hen-egg served sunny side and then accented with an ample portion of mullet bottarga - hence the ""two eggs.""  Textural and rich the dish shined despite its price tag and once again showed off Batali's skill with eggs.

Arriving next was my pizza and fried item.  First off, Zucchini Blossoms with Picorino Fritti consisted of five flavorful and lightly fried blossoms loaded with a zesty pecorino that melted just enough to give contrast.  Light and sweet to complement the savory cheese, the blossoms were actually more fragrant that I was used to and had a great ""aftertaste"" that lingered on the palate.

Finishing the blossoms I suddenly realized just how large the pizzas were and knowing I A) needed to spend $50 to use my certificate, B) wanted dessert, and C) had the previously mentioned dinner in a few hours I decided to only eat half the pizza - a half that turned into 4/6 of the pizza plus all of the toppings from the remaining slices after a couple bites.  Featuring a perfect and buttery cracker crust topped with pulled Ham hock, braised Endive, ricotta, and mozzarella the pizza was stated to be a daily special and it was incredible - possibly the best pizza I've had in a couple of years.  Smoky and savory yet sweet the ham was wonderfully tender while the crispy endive proved a nice foil with its mildly pungent tones.  The blend of cheeses worked well to accent the toppings without overwhelming, something I've found Batali's team particularly skilled at in past experiences.

Allowing my servers to clear the table (at this point inexplicably still holding the plates of every dish I'd consumed) and to finally refill my water (only 1 refill during the 70 minute meal) I watched the ""Street performers"" while awaiting my dessert.  Feeling somewhat full I decided against the ""dessert du jour"" - profiteroles, and instead opted for one of Enoteca's signature gelato sundaes - Concord Grape Sorbetto, Peanut Butter Gelato, Peanut Butter Cookie, frozen Concord Grapes.  Presented beautifully with a small gelato trowel I proceeded to crumble up the cookie and take a taste.  First impressed by the incredibly ""grape-like"" flavor of the sorbet and its tart almost wine-like aroma I next took a bite of the smooth and creamy gelato - literally like a blend of butter and peanut butter but cold.  Finally, mixing the two - heaven - like the best peanut butter and jelly you've never had.  

When it was all said and done my total bill came out to $57, or $35ish including my certificate - quite frankly, a steal for a Batali meal and especially in such a unique setting.  While clearly not as ""refined"" as Babbo or Mozza, I actually liked the atmosphere and food at Enoteca much more than that at Otto - I also didn't have to wait for 2 hours for a seat.  While service could have been better and prices perhaps slightly lower on the due uova, nothing was out of line and I'd certainly consider returning to Enoteca San Marco for a casual lunch on future visits to Vegas.  Say what you will about Mario - the man does great things with cheese, pork, and eggs",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,1,4,NRbi6dZeWA7k10t4VKQ2PQ

He immediately came to the table, took our drink order and informed us of how long dishes took once ordered so we could time our meal properly. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the Arancine (fried risotto balls) which were quite yummy. They were a bit salty, but nothing that a glass of wine couldn't help. Then we had the three cheese sampler which came with these 3 fabulous sauces to taste the cheese with. Of the 3, the black truffle honey was by far our favorite. Mmmmmm...

I thought this was supposed to be his casual dining establishment, but the prices were so high I felt like my appendix burst after eating a light lunch here.  I've had offensively high-priced food in this town but the food at this restaurant did not warrant the prices.

A light lunch for 3 people set us back for almost 100 dollars.  My husband had the Quattro Formaggi pizza, and he hated it.  He said the sauce was like bland tomato paste and he hated the riccota cheese on the pizza.  All he could taste was riccota, and it overwhelmed the pizza.  My father had the Romana pizza and also was not crazy about it.  He nibbled on the anchovy and caper toppings and barely finished the rest.  I had the spaghetti and spicey meatballs special, thinking that Mario's version of italian comfort food would be a good choice.  I actually enjoyed it, except the portion size was so tiny I barely got a chance to taste it.  I was completely offended by the small size of the portion and the $22 price tag to go along with it.   I could have gone to Don Vito's at South Point for the seafood pasta for only $24 and it was far superior to this.

I will never go here again except to use a few restaurant.com certificates I have lying around that i want to get rid of that I still need to use.

He is far too busy with having a restaurant empire and being pretty much a badass to come deal with his Las Vegas outposts.  That being said, the food here was very good.  I think too many people who come here just walk in from walking around 'fake Venice' and don't know what to get really.  Having read a number of Italian cookbooks (Batali's and others) I had a good idea of what to expect from each dish and what would best suit my desires for that evening.  I started out by ordering wine (by the quartino; about 2-3 glasses of wine), and the Barbera I ordered was quite excellent and perfect for the meal that I ordered.  Let me also just say that the waiter was very helpful, as I asked him about ordering from the 'Fritti' section of the menu and he suggested the Arancine (fried rissoto balls).  We ordered those and the fried anchovy/mozzarella sandwiches and both were outstanding.  The risotto balls were fried lightly and were not in the least bit greasy.  They were rich on the inside as the risotto was cooked perfectly al dente.  There was also a delicious cheesiness to the arancine.  Moving on, I got the braised pork shoulder.  It should be well-known that Batali loves working with tougher, cheaper cuts of meat that take a lot of love and patience to make tender and delicious.  The pork shoulder is no exception.  Out came this huge hunk of pork shoulder, served very hot with sliced cucumbers and thin slices of red chile on top.  The pork was perfectly seasoned and the sauce was the perfect interplay of salty, sweet, spicy, and sour.  Truly, for the price, a special dish.  I also tried my father's pesce livornese, which was made with fresh tuna and served in a livornese tomato sauce with huge caper berries.  Outstanding stuff!  I know Batali wasn't back in the kitchen cooking, but I appreciate the talent and intuition it takes to conceive of these dishes.

I've found my new favorite restaurant to dine in when in Vegas!  Loved the atmosphere- very  casual with a splash of class with the outdoor dining.  Went with a group of friends so I got to taste a bit of everything so here's my 2 cents:  actually, I'm not gonna waste time talking about other dishes...

Cut to the chase- here's what to order:  Fried Pizza Dough, Caprese Salad, Braised Pork Shoulder with Smashed Fried Potatoes and Sauteed Squash.

Pizza Dough:  Curiously shaped these strips of fried dough have the perfect chewy texture and is topped with shaved cheese and pepper flakes.  Simple yet addicting =)

Caprese Salad:  Yummy tomato slices with this soft gooey mozzarella like cheese on top!  It was so good I would play bloody knuckles for the last slice =)

Braised Pork Shoulder:  Huge, thick piece of pork meat that's so tender and soft that is glazed with this delicious apple reduction and cucumber slices.  Honestly, the pork was so good I didn't even realize there were cucumbers on that pig!  

The sides were AMAZING:  Fried Smashed Potatoes were something new that I'm a fan of....little red potatoes baked soft but the outside is lightly fried and crispy with this incredible salty slightly spicy kick!  Zucchinis were sauteed in butter and garlic- enough said!

What NOT to order:  Pizza (why waste $ on something you can everyday?!), Butternut Squash appetizer (tasted flowery), pasta margherita DOC (it was too salty).

My friend had a bite of my pork and said, ""Ohhh, the chef made love to that dish!"" and my reply was, ""If that's the case this pork had some multiple O's!""  Seriously guys, it was TOO GOOD!

*sigh*  Now I'm sad....talking about this restaurant and being 3 hours away sucks.

It takes a lot for me to say that.  First of all, we stumbled upon this restaurant not knowing it existed, and were hesitant to try it.  It wasn't very busy, therefore in my mind, not very good.  Damn, I am so freaking judgmental.  Where else but vegas is it okay to have such big judgy pants on?

We sat at the bar, which was a perfect choice.  We had a couple glasses of wine, and felt right at home with tremendous atmosphere.  3 cheeses were ordered, and I cannot believe how amazing honey and black truffle flakes can be.  The boy had a pizza, and I had an arugula salad.  

The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is due to the crutch known as salt that this restaurant was strongly holding onto.  There was no need for so much salt.  I even went as far as to pour my water into my salad plate just to wash the salt off.  Epic fail.

Our waitress was nice, and prompt, the staff was very attentive, and the atmosphere was perfect for the Venetian.  Sitting up at the bar was a fantastic choice as we were able to see a lot further, and enjoy when the performers came out to sing, puppet, etc... the tables looked uncomfortable.  At the bar you can watch them make the salads too.  Which I kind of like.  Its fun to see kitchen techniques, and how fast things come together for these chefs.

We had dinner al fresco, well not really it was on the ""patio"" with the fake outdoor scenery but it was really nice.  The food was delicious and everything was reasonably priced.  The restaurant has a very reminiscent casual, Italian dining feel.  There was a large group of us that night and I think everyone was thoroughly pleased with their meals.  We had a variety of dishes from pastas to pizzas, everything was tasty.  We chose out some various cheeses for appetizers and it was great, especially paired with great red wine and dried fruits and honey.   I will have to give this place only 4 stars though because they were a little slow on the service and when we first sat down no one came to greet us or take drink orders.  Instead we had to call the host to find us a server.  But I would go back here again for some good, authentic Italian food.  Mario Batali's new restaurant definitely lives up to his reputation.",qwKbrVLWJcrfmD9R1pHRqw,2,1,4,QYwcMR17WBsEGAUK19TXnQ

5806996,2007-10-12,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"This is the less formal of Mario Batali's restaurants located in The Venetian (the more formal is B&B Ristorante). Both lunch and dinner are served.

**The Menu
Full meals are available, but the emphasis is on antipasti: cured meats, bits of seafood, vegetables, cheeses, and more. Wine is featured, not only by the glass by by the quartino (just over 8 ounces). There are a number of desserts, with most involving gelato in one way or another.

**The Atmosphere
Located in the Venetian's shopping arcade, in the Piazza San Marco section, Enoteca consists of a food bar and a number of small tables, all in the pseudo open air of the arcade. There may tables inside, but I never checked.  Because of the arcade, there's a fair amount of background noise. It's usually not horribly loud - until performers in the plaza start belting out some old chestnut.

**Meal #1
OK, not exactly a meal. I stopped by just for its gelato, about which I had read good things. I chose three flavors:
    * Salted caramel. Sounds terrible, doesn't it? Maybe so, but it was great - by far my favorite flavor. The salt crystals added both crunch and flavor. If you order this, don't let it sit around too long, as the salt will dissolve when the ice cream starts to melt. However, even when the salt has dissolved, it's still very, very good.
    * Espresso. It wasn't too sweet, but the coffee flavor could have been a little stronger. Still, very good.
    * Pistachio. Made with two kinds of pistachio nuts: American pistachios were used in the base, with Italian pistachios sprinkled on top. The gelato had a strong nut flavor, with just a hint of peanut butter (odd but good). The pistachios on top were especially good.
Memory can be a tricky thing, but I can't recall ever having had better gelato. Better ice cream once or twice, but never better gelato.

**Meal #2
I selected four antipasti as my meal:
    * Finocchiona. Dried sausage flavored with fennel and black peppercorns. Served as very thin slices about one and one half inches in diameter. The flavor was strong if eaten on its own, but was very good when eaten with the vegetables I ordered.
    * Prosciutto. Fatty dried pork leg. I enjoyed this a lot, especially since it wasn't nearly as salty as I feared it might be.
    * Cauliflower Sicilian. Marinated cauliflower with black olives. Fairly bland, but a good foil to the cured meats.
    * Roasted Eggplant and Peppers. Blackened and marinated. I like eggplant prepared this way. I love peppers prepared this way.
Accompanying all this were some breadsticks - good to eat while waiting for the food - and some crusty bread - just right with the antipasti.

I even managed to find room for dessert: a Pick Me Up. It consisted of espresso gelato, mascarpone, chocolate sauce and crunchies. The gelato was again excellent.

**Summary
I liked my meal at Enoteca. I loved their gelato. This is a required stop on future trips.

**The Bill
My meal was $40, plus drinks, tax and tip. When I stopped just for dessert, gelato was $9, plus $9 for a glass of dessert wine.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,3,1,4,lkqGRaCWKV8Ri2KzVu0o3g
5839872,2010-04-08,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"We were in a city surrounded by all kinds of fancy restaurants yet my husband wanted nothing but a simple pizza.  We went to the Venetian, figured its Italian theme would lead us to some simulacrum of pizzeria.  

Passing a few gondolas we were at the ""plaza"" where Wolfgang Puck's Postrio and Mario Batali's Enoteca San Marco were next to each other.  As far as we know, Batali is Italian and Puck is not.  That was an easy decision.

We had a nice seat where we could easily hear the ""street performance"".  The bread, unlike most restaurants, came in a bag instead of a basket.  The olive oil was better than the bread, and the breadsticks imported from Italy were nothing special.  After studying the menu, my husband got a sausage pizza and I was attracted to the unusual mozzarella-and-clam pizza; we also decided to share a duel appetizer: butternut squash fries and prostitute fritter.  The food was served promptly: the deep fried appetizer was interesting but a little bit greasy and salty to my taste; the clams on my pizza were rubbery, the pizza itself was dry and did not have much flavor (except for one clam tasted funny); luckily, the fat and salt in the sausage made his pizza quite tasty-- also made him extremely thirsty.

It was an ok lunch, and the price seemed to be somewhat reasonable for Las Vegas.  Will we spend a hundred dollars on a ""simple"" pizza lunch there again?  Probably not.",rYduaRSe23tF3_LvSYc0lA,0,0,3,M4XZInm-TXFAYB8EXvyh8g
5878071,2007-11-23,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"A coworker picked Enoteca San Marco for our leadership lunch while at our convention in Vegas.  It's a Mario Batali restaurant.  Can't go wrong with that, right?  Not quite.

I don't know if it was an off day or typical, but I wasn't all that impressed.  First, we had to wait until our entire party arrived to be seated (really?  5 out of 6 isn't good enough? Especially when we wanted to order a bottle of wine straight off?).  Second, our server was spacey and unattentive.  Our lunch went on way longer than it really should have, simply because he would disappear for long periods of time.  Third, we were seated ""outside"" in St. Mark's Square and it was so loud with singing minstrels and whatnot that we literally couldn't have a conversation.  When we asked if we could be seated inside we were definitively told ""no.""  with no other explanation.  So the first part of our meal was spent looking at each other while listening to screeching minstrels.

Once we were seated, we got like three lousy pieces of bread to share among 7 people.  No butter or olive oil or anything.  So, we ordered an appetizer.  Some kind of platter thing to share that had olives, beets, broccolini, and other items in it.  Not bad - I especially liked the olives.

For lunch, the entrees were really tiny for the price.  Now I'm certainly not a fan of the ""14 meals in one dish"" kind of portions, but what we were served was ridiculous.  I had the cauliflower rigatoni and I swear, I had a total of 10 rigatonis on my plate.  And the pasta itself was WAY too salty.  The cauliflower mash was delicious, but totally overpowered by the salty pasta.  Others had bucatini, pizza and some kind of italian sausage penne.  I didn't really hear oohs and ahs.  

A few of us ordered dessert.  Nowhere on the dessert list does it say that all of the desserts are actually ice cream sundae creations to taste like other desserts.  Now I like ice cream as much as anyone, but when I ordered Tiramisu, I was not expecting ice cream, with coffee fudge sauce and two sorry lady fingers sticking out of it.  I was expecting Tiramisu.  One of my dining companions ordered the baked banana expecting it to be (shocker) a baked banana.  In reality, it was banana ice cream with caramel sauce.  

All in all, this place turned out to be just another meal for a large price tag.  Not the quality I was expecting from Mario Batali.",wPif9x51jxzO8DS6h-ZY4g,2,0,2,U06HD0b6e_uU5vPw-7MRJg
5888528,2010-01-20,1,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"Returned to Enoteca on my most recent visit to Vegas and I have to say that they did not disappoint. Efficient and friendly service, consistently good food, pleasant atmosphere...

We had eaten at Spago a couple of days earlier and by far, the pizza at Enoteca outshines Wolfgang Puck's pizza... 

The pastas we ordered were all phenomenal. Bucatini all'amatriciana - the tomato sauce is so simple yet so flavorful and the pasta is perfectly al dente. my favorite was my friend's roasted cauliflower ragu rigatoni with rosemary, red pepper flakes and romano cheese. So creamy and flavorful. I wish I could find the recipe even though I doubt I could ever replicate it..  

If you are eating at 1pm, you can watch the little show that gets put on in the square where there's some singing, juggling and other acts. Kind of neat.

My only complaint? They need to get new plates. They are VERY worn and scratched up and at first I thought my plate was dirty before realizing it was just really old and needs replacing... Not very pleasant.  Maybe they're going for the rustic look, but it's not working - they just look like they're being cheap and refusing to change out the plates.",2jfyZY-lBmQNfPVlatDt_Q,1,1,4,oN22iPXvCi7qWs9bhSs3gQ

5932902,2010-02-23,0,gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw,"Rating this place is difficult as there are such wide variances of the food and service. First the bad....The service was absolutely atrocious...after the initial good start when our waiter explained the menu, it went downhill very quick...they never made wine suggestions , never once came by to see how the meal was and I felt like we needed to flag someone down for any type of service at all....this made me extremely angry no matter how good the food was.

The food overall was up and down...We ordered 2 fried appetizers...the Arancine and the Frittelle di Prosciutto...both were a bit salty and were tiny! For $16 we received 4 of each but they were each a little larger than a quarter....the Arancine we liked better but would not order either again. The dinners were good...The braised pork shoulder was delicious but the Pasta Norma (Pasta, Ricotta and Eggplant) was good but it contained very little Eggplant but had a nice flavor.
The bread was pretty good but again, our servers did not offer any olive oil or other condiments to go with it, as I guess you need to know to ask for that. 
So I had to rate this 2 stars due to the extremely poor service and would not consider returning. We are in Vegas quite often and have eaten at most of the Venetian Restaurants but this would NOT be one that I could recommend.",FbwMU7GiN8uPhk5BvP4M9A,0,0,2,OxCWn3jJNDnuBoMqJIAkZw
