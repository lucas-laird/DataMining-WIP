128951,2016-10-28,1,IBSePQdC8MwoWdMmoyegnw,"I've been going to this location for over a year now, usually get the same bartenders, Kaleb and/or Patty. For some reason, tonight was a completely different story on the bar tab. I'm not a big player by any means, but I do play the ENTIRE time I'm there. I usually come with about 2-3 friends and we all order and gamble for HOURS! Tonight, I ordered 3 beers and a $3 order of tator tots.  I gambled for over 2 hours at the bar and WASN'T EVEN COMPED ONE BEER! NOT COOL!! No warning, just an ""F*#K You"" tab when I was ready to go. The excuse I got was, ""the manager controls things now and there's nothing I can do"". WOW! Really? You can't even comp me ONE beer for the time and money I have put into this place?!? 

Me and my friends won't be coming back here EVER! A simple warning would have been nice, but to just keep serving us like you always do and then bring a ridiculous tab without a real explanation, NOT OK! 

I cut up my player's card and will NOT be coming back! 

Apparently, you shouldn't waste your time gambling here since they are not going to comp any drinks for you and guest service is not their priority! When $20 can't even get you ONE FREE beer, it's definitely time to move on!

Your loss Five Star!!!! I will take this as a hint to spend my money elsewhere! Peace Out!",Ih5VQu-GpZ3ldm1PEeY0UQ,2,0,1,s5lMoTw9_pXBpGxz2-Msxg

The food was awesome. There is a large selection of foods for all appetites. I had the Potato soup and a burger, that were both fantastic.

The club sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs, hot dogs, and pork sliders are very good.  Pool table is in fairly good shape, and the televisions are nice and big.  I would have given them 5 stars, but we had issues at the other Five Star on North Rancho with the owners/managers being inattentive with customer service issues.

I came back a second time I had the same bartender Cassandra, same thing great customer service. The next time I came in I had a different bartender and I told her about how great the customer service. She laughed and said I must have caught Cassandra on a good day, I didn't  appreciate her humor. Turns out they let Cassandra go. I have been in here 3 times now and the customer service is horrible I walked out waiting for someone to take my food order last time and it looks like I am going to do it again. Looks like they let the wrong bartender go. If you can live with poor customer service, the food is good here. I recommend the blue cheese burger or the blue cheese steak.",oAM9h5osdVF4H2gZwagN-w,1,0,1,083-7Wi0x8mRPnefuGTQEA

1906112,2013-05-31,0,IBSePQdC8MwoWdMmoyegnw,"This place was formerly known as, ""The Junction"" and has recently been changed to ""Five Star Tavern"". Anyway, been here twice already and figured I'd write a short review.

This place is definitely a lot bigger than it looks. Very spacious inside with a 360 bar with gambling machines on them. There are two pool tables on the western side of the venue right when you walk in. They look like they're in pretty good condition too. The times I've been here, they have been renovating and it keeps looking better and better everytime I go in here. It's a cool place to chill and watch some sports while drinking some cheap beer. You also get a complimentary drink if you're gambling which is quite nice.
The kitchen is not yet ready from what the bartender told me but will be open in about a week's time. I will definitely be back here. It's been kind of dead both times I've been but I expect that to change once the word gets out about this place. 

Gripe 1: I wish they turned up the volume on the T.Vs whenever the game is playing because it's definitely too quiet in there sometimes. Plus I love it when I can hear the game(even if it's on low volume). 

Gripe 2: No top or medium shelp liquor. No Crown, Jack, Ciroc, Patron, Don Julio. This actually made me really sad :(

All in all though, I can't complain too much about this place and I will be back! If I know I am going to go to a place more than just a couple times, then it's gotta qualify for at least 4 stars :D",hv5YOkgbipxKQuqd_lmnjQ,1,0,4,rrcbH9UJl7gjhYdyvUZPAw

3116051,2014-06-14,2,IBSePQdC8MwoWdMmoyegnw,"Time to ditch this place. Came for a late bite last night 6/14 and had the worst service in my multiple visits here. 

My boyfriend had 20 minute wait for another drink, our food came out and sat by the wait staff for 10 minutes getting cold, until WE went and grabbed it. My boyfriend also got the completely WRONG food. He wasn't acknowledged after 10 minutes of trying to get someone's attention. 

Watching the bartenders chit chat while we sat neglected was not my idea of a good atmosphere. I guess this is a place where if you are not a regular you get treated to poor service.",m1IVpXClMox1VGw5hO2LhQ,2,1,1,GR-ZAJpCER4a-eZHXOx0cg

3137967,2018-02-24,0,IBSePQdC8MwoWdMmoyegnw,"While the staff I've met at this location and the Craig and Rancho location have all been friendly and very responsive, this has to be the most badly managed bar I've been to period. They never carry the most popular liquors, the bartenders are unable to make most popular drinks. This location doesn't even have Red Bull behind the bar. However, they DO have a machine you can buy it from and bring it to the bartender. They advertise beers and alcohols they don't actually carry. They do have a decent food menu. But they rarely have the items in their kitchen. They don't have any cable channels on the several TVs they have. So don't expect to be able to watch a game. It seems to be a wine bar, but the neighborhood doesn't seem to be the right area. To sum up, this bar is anything but a ""5 star"" rating. If you want good customer service, great place. It's the only thing this bar offers.",7biaXKypQ8FuA8sqq0E2gg,0,0,1,wjsK-regeueWYSv7FRGG2g

Turkey burger was one of the best we've had in the city. Thanks for a boatload of tater tots too. Vodka & soda $4.50. Very nice. Also have Labatt Blue on tap. Yum Yum. A great spot to watch sports with some of the biggest TVs at a bar you'll find in Vegas. Don't judge the book by its cover.

4526551,2014-06-25,0,IBSePQdC8MwoWdMmoyegnw,We randomly went into Five Star Tavern Saturday because we were looking for a place to play pool.  YAY for cheap pool tables.  $1 for one game or I think it was $2 for 3 games.  It was quiet.  Several people at the bar and a larger party at a table in the dining area.  Everyone was eating but I didn't stare their food down so not sure if it looked great but it did smell good.  Very quaint place.  The bartender was friendly.  Ordered 2 Bud Lights on tap...$5.00 YAY again.  Decent atmosphere and cheap drinks in Vegas are a rare commodity.

Durring my meak I was constantly playing max bet on a penny keno machine. I ordered another beer and life was good and so were the nachos. I asked for my bill and was given the check for 2 beers and my food. When asked why the beer she said ....um well how much did you play? 
she saw me put in a 20 and obviously did not cash out at all. I was playing the entire time. I spent less than 30 min there start to finish.

5127616,2014-03-19,1,IBSePQdC8MwoWdMmoyegnw,"Tonight I dined and drank at Five Star having their chicken nachos and 2 Boston Lagers. I put $100 in the machine and played Black Jack for an hour. I was comped for my 2 Boston Lagers by Shantelle and then left the bar after paying $8.50 and a tip to Shantelle. My fiancé came 20-30 minutes later. He also drank and dined. He was advised by Shantelle that due to her comping my drinks earlier in the evening she could not comp any of his drinks. We played on separate player's club cards and weren't in the bar at the same time. We missed each other by 30 minutes. 

I am appalled and disgusted by the way my fiancé was treated by the bar staff and making an excuse that they couldn't comp his drinks due to my previous comps. We don't have the same last name and we play on separate cards. I have since written Five Star's corporate email and hope to hear back from them. 

I have been a loyal patron and have never received such poor, disinterested service from both Shantelle and the other bartender an Asian lady that I have no idea what here name is. This will be my final visit to Five Star. I will speak with my feet and take my business elsewhere.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,4,1,1,-MKzYdQfMiFsgfvsT5SY-A
