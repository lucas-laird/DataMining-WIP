FOR HER:
- TRIPLE S (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, red onion, jalapeno, cucumber, tempura crunch, sweet chipotle mayo & unagi sauce). No jalapenos for me though! 
FOR HIM: 
- TWIN DRAGON (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, cucumber, guacamole, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo, unagi sauce). No cucumbers for him.

Everything was 100% satisfactory. Ingredients are fresh, flavor is on point, and no complaints whatsoever. The taro chips are coated in a sweet layer of furikake that pairs so well with it too!

Anyways, I wanted to try this place because a lot of sushi burrito places/poke places have been opening lately & this one was down the road. I like Jaburritos and this one had the same concept (chipotle style).

You choose from a menu for a signature burrito/bowl or you can B.Y.O. (build your own). I chose to build my own and my BF chose a twin dragon burrito.

I chose to build a bowl w/ shrimp tempura, spicy tuna & yellowtail on sushi rice.

For my sauces I put chipotle mayo, sesame soy & Unagi sauce 

The service was 7/10. It was really hard to hear the workers who took your order. They need to speak up because I couldn't hear them thru the glass and it just sounded like they were mumbling to me.

Chef John has designed a restaurant with excellent food, super affordable menu items, with excellent customer service from staff. I've been going to his Sahara location for a year and I love the new menu items at this location. (My favorite is the ginger beef bowl). 

I expect to eat here 3-4 times a week because the food is great (Chef John told me his fish is imported from the same supplier as the casinos on the strip). They also have excellent food handling consistency. Out of the hundreds of times I've eaten at the Sahara locations, I can only remember once or twice when the brown rice was a little under cooked, but everything is generally perfect. 

Consistency, excellent customer service, low price point, huge selection of food items? I don't think I need to cook for a Looooong time.

I ordered their steak roll... And I added jalapenos and it was delicious!!! Service was dead on as well. The staff was young but totally all over it. 

I like how you can customize it to either get the sea weed paper or the soy paper... Brown rice... White rice or sushi rice.

Compared to jaburrito I prefer this place if I'm in the mood for a sushirito. I like their menu options as they have better tasting options (in my opinion) and the portions seem to be bigger. If you're not in the mood for fish or don't eat raw stuff you can get your GAINZ on and get steak! Like other places you can build your own sushi burrito! Price range is usually $8-$11 per order! You can also get a poke bowl! Like the sushi burrito, they have premade options or you can build your own bowl. Prices for bowls are cheaper as they range from $6.50-$8. The only reason why I didn't rate it a 5 is that the bowls tasted kinda bland to me and lacked a little more flavor. It's not bad if you're looking for something simple. Besides that everything else was good! It's a bit small inside, but it's usually clean and the employees are friendly! They take the time to explain their options.",F7V-J4rJjWGwtLOcl6hFFA,1,0,4,maR3B1ECxCS51nEoGAXM-A

I got soft she'll crab and tuna with avocado, seaweed salad and masago along with the free toppings.

2071900,2017-03-08,1,eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA,"This place is ridiculously close to my job, so I've been eating here a lot. They are known for their sushi burritos, but they also have poke bowls, teriyaki bowls and unique sides. The burritos are pretty small though so I usually make my own poke bowl. I find that they are much larger and use more protein than competitors. They use a small scoop, but give you three of those per protein. So if you chose 3 proteins you get 9 scoops! Plus a generous helping of white, brown or sushi rice. That's a lot of food ya'll. 

They have basic sides like edamame and miso soup, but they also have these delicious taro chips that you can get flavored in furikake, cheddar, and sour cream and onion. The chips are tasty and they come with a nacho cheese sauce for dipping. If you add a drink you can get the combo price which saves a few $$$.

This place does charge for extra protein and premium toppings though, but since they are so generous with portions, it's not a deal breaker for me.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,2,4,Cu7Rvg2lB3twBbsHjTJRXQ

I notice from another yelper (thank you yelp check in feed! lol)) about another Poke Bowl one that really close too my house. The name SOHO immediately thought of the restaurant. I have never been but after coming here just might have go check it out. The same owners also own this place Soho Sushi Burrito. It was while ago but still remember the first time heard of sushi burrito concept was the same guys had location on Sahara. Or not?? In any case the one thing I do know is the Poke Bowl are Da Bomb. The Poke Bowl section of the menu they have five different ones they came up with and also B,Y,O (build your own) section. Teriyaki Bowls. So there really is some Bowl here to please everyone. I went with the Lahaina Bowl. I loved everything about it! I was in spicy tuna kind of mood so figure start my check list off. I really enjoy the way all the ingredients in the bowl complimented each other. The dressing or main sauce the sweet chipotle mayo was solid. The topping most of them are free but just FYI not all of them are free. I just added cucumbers, and corn to my bowl. Really you can create your own master piece with every bowl. The starch you get choose from white or brown rice or even have nice organic mix salad greens for the base. I went with white rice. The fish quality was awesome. REALLY if the fish not fresh then why even call it Poke anything. The truth. Soho Sushi Bowlrrrito freshness is five star no doubt. The portion you get for the price is steal of deal. I know came here for recovery meal after long training session. Hit the spot. Fresh Tuna, Fresh Toppings, and Carbs. Healthy at its best my friends..

The place is small so just might have wait find spot sit down. I came lunch time line but thankfully by the time got up front couple seats open on the counter area soon as you walk in. You can tell the place just open because they have full crew working the line. They literally had six workers building either sushi burritos or bowls. It made the line go by at nice pace so even if busy not going take that long. The best part about the whole concept is both burrito or bowls easy take it home too eat or wherever. Patience will be rewarded.

The sushi burrito am sure is the da bomb. They use the same fish for both. The options for the burritos are the same like the bowls. Lot of great options and really something for everyone. The staff was awesome. Every one along the line was friendly, high energy, and lots of smiles around.

2333619,2016-08-06,8,eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA,"So these Chipotle style sushi ""poke"" bowl and burrito places are popping up around Vegas like crazy. There must've been like 100 or so similar places around the area that just opened up within the last year. Ok I exaggerated. Well it surely aint the same kind of ""poke"" I've known but I'm kind of use to it since everytime I've ordered poke at any sushi bar in Vegas it's always been in a similar form of some raw seafood and fillers like veggies. I guess I never had real poke until I came to the mainland. FML. Ok I think I'm done. On to the rest of my review.

You see my picture of the Waikiki ""poke"" bowl? Yea it looks pretty plain. It tasted pretty plain too and it wasn't even the cheapest bowl on the menu. Zero or little flavor to whatever it suppose to be. It was some ahi tuna, green onion, red onion, sesame soy, seaweed, and furikake. Added jalape√±o and cucumber. Kept those fillers to a minimum. It really needed salt or soy sauce. Customer service was fast but maybe too fast cause when I told the 2nd guy in their assembly line it was my 1st time and what do people usually put on it he shrugged his shoulders as if he couldn't care less and continued on. It didnt get busy until after I sat and already had my food. Yea others pics look good and I was hoping maybe to try it as what they were. So maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'd suggest talking to customers who seem like they know how to order.

On a positive note their taro chips were pretty good. Choice of cheese as a dipping sauce meh. Ahh their little tables, limited seating, and 1st experience probably got me at not returning anytime soon. Take your food to go. Enjoy.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,15,6,2,k7TYubb5GxZL20O_93VtBQ

I couldn't eat more than 2 chips never mind dipping into the jalapeno cheese sauce. Nice idea, but not gettng those when I come back. Despite this, I'd still come back here for the poke alone. Maybe try and burrito next time. This place has earned a spot on my to visit list while in town",3JIfGet5Unjgg6JztF8vXA,1,0,5,bRnDL8TlJkSwrVQbR7IXtw

The food is fresh, tasty, well prepared, and affordable.  The people who work there are well trained, but more importantly they are hospitable and welcoming.

The North Shore bowl is really delicious and refreshing with a mixture of shrimp and scallops and the perfect amount of Sweet Chipotle Mayo to balance the dish. By far my favorite 


Honopu is a delightful choice if you love octopus and Kimchi. I opted to add yellowtail to enhance the flavors. One of the great convenience of ordering from a place that caters to your liking.

Hilo Bowl was so delicious,  there are just no words to describe it. Flavor explosion from the very first bite. Perfect balance of all the ingredients it consists of.

You can either get poke bowls or a sushi burrito. I got a sushi burrito (since I've actually never tried it in California before, so...idk how I'm gonna compare this with anything else).

They have a vast selection of menu items that you can either just order or customize and make your own. You can choose your wrap, it can be soy paper, seaweed paper, or a tortilla. The rice is also customizable. Sushi rice, white rice, brown rice, and I think the other option was like quinoa. I forgot.
I wanted to see if their menu items were good on its own, so I opted for the Tropical Sunset (I added roasted corn). This was definitely a really good burrito. The ratio of rice and toppings they add is mind blowing. Usually when I see pics of sushi burritos in California, they add a large/thick amount of rice. However, over here they add just a thin layer so you can enjoy the flavors more. Plus less carbs equal less sugar so. There's that. I don't think I feel the need to get sushi burritos in Cali anymore after trying this. I'll wait. If you have friends in other places who get the chance to visit Las Vegas, you should take them here. They will thank you.

Plus the workers here are super nice. They're very patient and cool so you don't feel uncomfortable ordering and feeling judgement like at other restaurants.

It's pretty spacious, I think it can seat around 10 people? Maybe more actually I'm just estimating.

TL;DR
Sushi burritos/poke bowls here are really good~
Come here and try all the different flavors.
They have a ginger and wasabi station nearby the cashier so you can add it to your food.
They have exotic Asian sodas.",QKeh6GUPHetOl7gLdgXhNQ,0,0,5,Cp7czYvEI75t9Ox0X93r0Q

You get to see them make the burrito too, and they pack them full and tight!!  Love this stuff! 

They also sell burrito bowls too, but when I'm at a burrito place, I gotta get the burrito :). Yum!!

So this is basically a huge fat sushi roll, not sliced up. And I think the burrito is better than a sushi roll, in my opinion, because you get fatter stuff in the seaweed wrap and you have more ingredients inside. 

Also they have taro chips too - in 3 different flavors. They give samples too if you're not sure. 

Service was great here too.

After hearing numerous rave reviews about Soho, I decided to skip my go-to spot for poke and give them a try. Sadly, I was not overly impressed with my visit or with my bowl.

Soho is fairly small, in a shopping center that doesn't have a lot of nearby parking. When I arrived around 11:30 am, there was a line of people waiting to order as well as a cluster of people near the register trying to pay and/or pick up to go orders. 

Service was friendly, but three employees making bowls and burritos and only one cashier to ring customers up, answer the phone and assist the pushy Uber Eats driver did not seem sufficient. 

My bowl contained a nice sized portion of protein. I would like to see a wider variety of sauces and more traditional toppings. I got white rice for my base and was disappointed to find golf ball sized clumps under the protein and other toppings. Also, if you are going to charge extra to add avocado, it should be pristine and not browning.

Lately I have been trying to give places multiple tries before I review them, but with so many options for poke bowls in the area, I don't see myself returning to Soho Sushi Bowlritto anytime soon.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,3,3,3,dDjsNE-58J2HBx_2FvLDVA
4107010,2016-10-17,7,eJPckkV1k7gn0V2awA1pzA,"I first visited a John Chien Lee sushi burrito restaurant when he was in the Jaburritos business partnership a year ago. I finally went back to another one today.

Soho Sushi Bowlrrito is a more recently opened variant of this concept that's just one street removed from the Rainbow Blvd hotbed of similar restaurants. This place runs pretty much the same menu as now-a-separate-brand Jaburritos and the original Soho Sushi Burrito except for the addition of poke bowl options, and it looks like a cozier (read: smaller interior) version of the original restaurant.

If you're unfamiliar with this trendy genre of restaurants, they run a model that resembles Chipotle or Subway. There is an assembly line, lay out all the proteins and veggies, and let you choose what you want starting with the form (sushi bowl, sushi burrito, or poke bowl) and base (sushi rice for everything except poke bowls, white rice, brown rice, or mixed greens). They do provide a big menu to guide you, but they ask you whether you want to add more toppings (some free, others premium) - and unlike my friend and I, you should definitely not hesitate to add more of the free ones, including a sauce or two.

I got the Triple ""S"" ($10.50) sushi burrito w/ soy paper first to confirm that it was the same thing as the equivalent menu item from the other restaurant. I think they may have forgotten to add the unagi sauce, but despite that omission, the mix of proteins (surimi, spicy tuna, soft shell crab tempura) and the crunchy texture of the veggies more than satisfied me. It's superior to another sushi burrito that I recently tried from a newer restaurant.

I also had a Hilo poke bowl ($8.50) with sushi rice, which is a yellowtail-focused recipe. First impression: huge portion, including ample fish. This hamachi was as great as the stuff that they serve at the actual Soho restaurant. I didn't realize that I'd be getting flatter seaweed a la miso soup instead of the typically delicious stringy seaweed (which I did see behind the glass), but the other default toppings of black pepper, green and red onion, and sesame soy were almost enough on their own to complement this protein. A healthy dose of soy sauce from the sauce bar sealed the deal, although I'll have to consider adding a sweet sauce next time. Only real issue: no sushi rice for this menu, just plain white rice.

Finally, I also checked out the taro chips ($2.49, or a small combo discount that was 50 cents for the drink I chose), choosing the original furikake after the cashier thoughtfully provided samples; I decided that cheddar seasoning and jalape√±o sour cream obscured the taro flavor too much. The chips are a great crunchy side to add texture to your food, and the complimentary cheese sauce complements the chips as a solo snack. I also really appreciate that they use a paper bag with a closing/sealing mechanism, which allowed me to keep it fresh to enjoy with my leftovers.

Soho Sushi Bowlrrito isn't perfect, but they're my favorite (and my wallet's favorite) take on customizable sushi burritos and poke bowls so far. They're very good for a casual or quick meal, which is a different niche than a premium meal (for which you should probably consider OG Soho) or an AYCE sushi place (for truly ravenous eaters).",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,11,7,4,wOfH52SgWBMBUIfvjKy2Ww

I love how they expanded on the concept of sushi burritos to bowls. They listened to what the customers had to say and studied what they were ordering. They realized that they had an opportunity to grow their fan base so they capitalized and executed successfully.

I love that when you order the poke bowls, they mix everything into a bowl with the sauces, vegetables and protein before putting it back on the rice instead of just plopping each ingredient onto the rice right away. This gives a more thorough flavor for what they are trying to achieve with the pre-made menu or by building your own. They also brought over their burrito menu from the Sahara location so I can continue ordering my burritos double decker style ;)

They have also added grilled chicken, ginger beef chashu pork belly, grilled steak, grilled salmon and grilled shrimp to the menu if you want to skip the fish and try a teriyaki bowl instead. I don't know when I'll ever end up trying these since I love their fresh fish so damn much but one of these days I'll probably just order multiple items.",bRzr5YuEIncFzG6_vYSwcw,8,3,5,oPm6Kc5de5Ll96e3CYvzpw

They have an assortment of sides to choose from also: edamame, soup, etc. as well as fountain and bottled drinks. For such a small place, the food and drink selection was incredible!

Friendly workers that has smiles on their faces as first timers like me & my homies browsed their menu that's posted on the board. I opted to build my own sushi burrito by combining 2 scoops of Grilled Chicken Breast strips & a scoop of Surimi Crab. Weird combination, huh? Then chose seaweed paper & brown rice for the ""tortilla"" part. Hence, they also have poke bowls if you're into that! Then I was asked for which ingredients, sauces & toppings to be put in the sushi burrito. Opted for a lot of veggies to pack a healthy punch - including seaweed, avocado, lettuce, green & red onions, a tiny scoop of pico de gallo, with a mixture of both Spicy Miso Aioli & Sesase Soy sauce dressings! It may be weird, but in order for you to try it, you gotta be creative AND experiment! First bite into the sushiritto was heaven! No regrets in combining chicken & crab, and it had A LOT of veggies, which is a huge plus! My other friends got a Teriyaki Bowl & a Lion King Roll.

The staff here is no different - quick and courteous. The girl that made my bowl still referred to the recipe, but she put the ingredients together very quickly. She reminds me of Jessica Sanchez...

Anyway, I ordered the Hilo Poke Bowl with white rice, since it sounded like it came with basic, traditional toppings. If you're like me and don't care for crazy toppings, you will enjoy the Hilo poke bowl. It's made with yellowtail, green onions, red onion, black pepper, sesame soy sauce, and mixed seaweed (unique blend... I think I saw ogo in there). I didn't add anything else, and it doesn't need anything else!

They don't skimp out on the amount of fish, although they are cut into much smaller pieces, which you may or may not like. Personally, I like bigger pieces since you get more of the fish flavor and texture, but smaller pieces also mean they won't easily fall out of your sushi burrito.

My sister ordered her usual ""Lion King"" burrito, which flavorwise was the same but significantly smaller. I'm guessing since the rolls are hand rolls it's harder to have more stuffing. 
My fianc√© and I decided to try out the poke bowls, which looked nothing like the photos we'd seen previously. Fianc√© got the Lahaina bowl with white rice, which he enjoyed the taste but felt something was missing. I got the Waikiki bowl with mixed greens. If I had left it as is I would have been very disappointed, luckily I had the foresight to add cucumber and tempura crunch along with additional sauce. In comparison to other poke bowl places, Soho lacks presentation and customization options. 
If I'm really hankering for a sushi burrito and don't feel like driving to Sahara then I'll go here. But I'd suggest sticking with the Sahara location.",U-lHUPZbG8R7Bqxzq8X_lQ,0,0,3,jhOad8AcnafP0AXwzjddkA

The saddest day was when the Soho Japanese Restaurant went to dinner only. I was thrilled to learn that Soho SushiBOWLrrito opened this past weekend and it's just down the street.

The location is just near the Starbucks (perfect) and right off the 215 and Jones.
My coworkers and I picked up an order to go - and we all got the Twin Dragon and a side of seaweed salad.

The staff was friendly and attentive!  The store was spotless! Everything looked amazing.
The food was what dreams are made of. Do you ever get full but you keep eating anyway because it tastes SO good? Well, I do and I did. Everything was so fresh, so delicious - and the flavor combinations - PERFECT. I would like to bathe in the guacamole that was in my sushiburrito. I  promised myself that I would try the twin dragon next time as a bowl with some taro chips but I also want to try every signature roll on the menu.

This location also has Poke and Teriyaki bowls as well so there's lots for everyone. 
I LOVED the seaweed salad - it could not have been any better - it was refreshing and clean. When something so simple can be so perfect - this is a MUST TRY! Thank me later.

I look forward to my next visit which I'm sure will be sometime this week. 
So bookmark it, tell your friends, tell you everyone you know - Soho SushiBowlrrito is the BEST (other than Soho Japanese Restaurant).",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,6,2,5,iX1nnGFpq5v1Jcd-JIlCvw

First trip to Soho Sushi Burrito and I chose the 3 Amigos burrito with brown rice.  Server packed it with plenty of salmon, yellowtail and tuna plus the rest of the fixings.  Very delicious sushi burrito and the perfect portion for my hunger.  A friend of mine had ordered double protein before and wouldn't recommend it since it requires another piece of seaweed and makes the burrito difficult to eat.  Second trip to Soho Sushi Burrito I tried the twin dragon roll but didn't enjoy it as much as the 3 Amigos, probably due to the shrimp tempura and imitation crab mixture.  I prefer the fresh sushi taste in every bite of a sushi burrito.  I happened to be on a diet my third trip to Soho Sushi Burrito and did a 3 Amigos bowl/salad and it was a very delicious low carb alternative to the burritos.
