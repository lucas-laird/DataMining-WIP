However, for being a breakfast place, they need to step up their coffee game. This is some of the weakest and worst coffee I've ever had and that alone makes me not want to come back with so many options nearby.",P0jepoKSYHs9DpUKxc_Klw,0,0,2,nBLoV0U15sT8FuVENPyxOQ

I will NEVER eat here again. On my first visit I ordered the chicken and waffles. The service was GREAT and the food was awesome. I was so excited, I told everyone! I took my husband just a few days later and the experience was night and day! 
 I've tried it four times since then and the service has been AWFUL. Most recently, I found HAIR IN MY FOOD!! 
 The cashier, who identified herself as ""Lace"" was RUDE! 
 I am so disappointed because I thought that this would be my new breakfast spot. It WON'T! 
Small businesses really need to be careful who they let operate their establishment. I've seen so many good places driven into the ground because of people like ""LACE"". .",oOlzp2cnVaDzRDazuSYPPg,1,0,1,N9GYcydZy_cMP2EBx7SVWQ

Atmosphere is meh - formerly a Joe's Crab Shack. Large patio is great though, and the place is huge so you should be able to get seated fairly quickly. Lavazza coffee...brewed OR French Press sooo good. Server kept it topped off (thanks G, we thought you were amazing!) Turkey kielbasa v. good, frosted flake banana pancake is worth a try at least once - one pancake and it's huge. Eggs cooked to perfection. The chicken fried steak on a scale of 1 - 10 was a 6, was as big as the plate but a bit on the tough dry side. Going back to try a few other dishes. I'm on the fence with this place for now, am a devout breakfast person!

Update...went back, french toast stuffed with the eggs n bacon - a delicious original. OJ was watery and too tangy...the server warned us though, as the oranges they had were out iof season. Classic pancakes - 2 huge hotcakes so plan to share. Syrup was warmed - nice! They were wearing their PJ'S on Sunday morning...fun idea!

207846,2015-10-26,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"I should start this review by stating the Rise N Shine WAS one of my favorite places to eat. The food WAS great and the staff WAS amazing. This time was much different. My parents and I decided to enjoy this beautiful fall day and have a great lunch outside. When we arrive at the flamingo and 215 location, we were informed the outside was closed to clean. We informed the hostess we were going somewhere else to eat outside and it was only then that she reluctantly stated ""if that is what it takes to get you to stay, you can eat the outside"".  We were seated outside and our server Corey attempted to take great care of us. My mother and I both ordered the patty melt which was spot on in the past but not today. My father ordered the corned beef hash which also was usually great. After waiting an inordinate amount of time, which we would allow for perfect food, we received our orders. My mom and I fought our way through half of our patty melts.  The reason it was such a fight was do to the unbelievably salty over seasoning. When we informed our server, he said that since we ate half he would see what he could do. He came back and said he would give us a 15% family and friends discount. That was better than nothing but not appropriate. No manager came to speak with us even though I know that is the way any restaurant should respond to complaints. We do not fault our server because we know he was trying his best under less than ideal conditions. My father who white knuckled his way through his corned beef hash exclaimed after the fact mentioned his meal was way too greasy and below standards. I am sad to say that we will not be dining at Rise N Shine again unless they can repair their now broken systems. Please fix it so I can return.",9c0JcWAQUpTWlpcdTWc4Pw,0,0,2,XCIA8DFmrtDIjTsuoXUjug

240559,2015-05-10,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"I will never patronize this restaurant again.  I went to Rise and Shine on Flamingo with three of my friends and arrived at 10:30 a.m.  we were told it would be a 45 minute wait.  After an hour I went to the hostess stand and she said 5 minutes more we were next in line.  There were empty tables on the patio and in the restaurant.  15 minutes later I was still waiting.  I went to ask for the manager and a young girl said I am the manager.  I asked her name and she refused to give it to me.  I asked what the problem was and she said the kitchen is backed up, we have just opened and we have problems.  I asked since we were next on the list could we at least sit down and have a cup of coffee.  She said no and that if we don't like waiting we could leave.  I asked for the name of the owners and she said we are a family business and I don't give this information out.  she then proceeded to cross our name off the list and I asked if she was refusing to serve us.  She said oh I assume since you are not happy that you are leaving.  My friend said this is not the way you treat customers who are asking you a question and she said Oh Well you don't like it leave.  She said this in front of all of the customers who were also leaving.  In the parking lot all the customers leaving were telling people who where arriving not to both because management is rude and the wait is now over two hours.  There are many restaurants in Las Vegas and when you are treated rudely by managers there is no reason to return and give them hard earned money.  We left and went to I Hop on Tropicana; we were greeted by the manager who was friendly, the waitress was delightful and the food was delicious.  Plus we got to use our 2-1 coupons found online.  What a difference.  The owners of this restaurant need to go in and see what is going on.  I am the manager of a restaurant and if I found any of my team speaking to customers in such a manner they would not even see the door on the way out.",xVjv--oY-UUUwm-vdxgorw,0,0,1,Mnz6uyTScIBP4dppi7XJHQ

The place is decorated cutely and the food was okay. However the service was so bad, it was almost comical. My food and my children's food came out but we weren't given any utensils or syrup. Our server never came by so we had to get up and ask someone else for help. They told us we couldn't have utensils until they were wrapped in napkins. We again asked politely for at least 2 forks for the kids. We were told no so we simply took the forks ourselves (about 10 minutes later someone brought us over utensils wrapped in napkins). We never got syrup so we had to ask the booth behind us if we could use theirs. My mom's food came out a few minutes later, but her side never came. When we got the receipt her side was still on there so we got them to take it off & mentioned our bad experience...they gave us 10% off but really a few dollars off didn't make us feel better about the situation. As we were talking and standing up to leave another family heard us and said ""you didn't get any utensils either?"" 

The food is not bad so if you don't mind waiting forever for everything and having to hassle everyone for things then don't let my review discourage you.

As for the highly publicized Pot of Bread, it's actually just a small cinnamon roll that, while warm and flaky, severely lacked sweetness.

Service: Dreadful. The initial wait was 35 minutes for a table of six, but hey, understandable for a new breakfast joint on a Saturday morning.

358626,2016-03-20,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Two months ago this was one of my favorite places for breakfast but like typical Vegas, service and quality are gone.  Before we ordered we asked the waitress if we could split the bill between 5 of us.  She said the menu said it could only be split by two but since we told her early enough she could do it.  She put it all on one bill.  Two of us ordered the Nutella Cappuccinos which are $4+.  The waitress came by to offer us refills of regular coffee; she filled my cup up half way.  What she didn't tell us was that there was an additional $2.95 charge for the refill, two months ago, there was not. I ordered a Loco Mocco, it was terrible.  So salty, the eggs were under cooked and the burger was burned (I ordered medium).  When we checked out, the girl at the counter asked how it was. As we started telling her about the coffee charge she really didn't want to hear it so she walked away and asked someone else to deal with us.  We explained the coffee refill and service issues with her but she just wanted to argue saying that it's the owner's rules to charge for refills.  Again, I explained we were offered refills but never told we would be charged for them.  If this is policy, you should at least let the guest know.  A simple ""I'm sorry"" was all we needed.  She offered to take off the charge for the coffee but again let us know it was their policy.  She missed the whole point, we told her we would never come back but at this point she didn't want to listen, she told us we could just leave, there was no charge.  We weren't complaining to get free food; we were trying to let them know they had a customer service issue they needed to fix.

474779,2015-09-30,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"What a great place for breakfast! I went there two days in a row, and the hostess remembered me!

The first time I went I ordered the ultimate steak and egg breakfast. The steak is a ribeye, a bit thin, but was delicious. It took up a big portion of my plate. The eggs are cooked perfectly and the hashbrowns are large shreds instead of small shreds nice and crispy on the outside tender on the inside.

The second time I went, I had the buffalo chicken with eggs breakfast. Now buffalo sauce for breakfast didn't sound great to me, so I asked for gravy instead. The size of the piece of chicken fried chicken I received was huge. It overtook my plate. I could only eat about a third. The batter was wonderful! I think this is the best fry batter I have ever had. It was light and crispy, not oily or greasy at all.   It had a little little flavoring of the buffalo sauce and the better, and that was just right. I think I might order it the next time as presented on the menu.

They have a lot of nice things on the menu, including a many different kinds of pancakes (mmmm..chocolate chip!), original omelettes such as lox and cream cheese, or you can make your own. They also have French toast and The  normal breakfast fair.  They offer a different variety of sausages for your choosing. Not just the patty or regular pork sausage. They offer chicken sausage and another type that unfortunately I can't remember! If you have a chance, get online and look at the menu. There's just so much there I can't describe it all!

The servers are all dressed in pajamas, so you can tell who is a server and who is the patron. The service was great by the way.

They offer French pressed coffee which I ordered the second day, and let seep a  little too long. It was very strong. They give you three timers, so you can decide whether you want it mild medium or strong. I normally like very strong coffee so I went for it.  Next time, I will choose a different timer. 

There are lots and lots of breakfast places here in Las Vegas, for me to go to the same place two days in a row, that pretty much says it all. I love to eat breakfast out and plan to try just about everything on the menu there.",2qG875EzMfFMDcqaDvIjkw,1,1,5,PPTP4yKwSwWGcZ6d6CpY1A
479370,2015-08-01,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Delicious food. Good variations on standard breakfast items and the waitresses are attentive and friendly.

The one big issue I saw (and one that almost had us walking out in the first 5 minutes) was the young blonde hostess. What a disaster. We get there with children in tow at 10am on a Friday morning (not even a weekend) and we were immediately greeted by someone who seemed frazzled and a bit stand-offish when asked the wait time by saying ""I know that I have a ton of tables open but I don't want to slam the kitchen so I need you to wait up here for 10-15 minutes"". You clearly had the staff and the tables free yet she was ill-equipped either by training or lack of common sense to seat us immediately. Then she begrudgingly seats us and then asks if we need a booster seat. We say yes and she says ""Can you wait here at the table and I will be back in a few minutes as I need to cash these people(who just walked up) out"". So I got my own damn booster seat and we sat down instead of waiting for her to bring us one from across the restaurant. A horrible impression.

The young lady is not hostess material and she certainly is not a good first line for your restaurant. She is better suited for the tanning place next door.

The food was great. I had the Salmon Benedict and everything was very tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant. Overall a good experience until we go to pay the check. The hostess asks if we want to add a tip electronically and we say yes and the amount and then she prints us out a bill with $0 added to the tip. Again, might be a serious lack of training or she might not be a good fit but the coming and leaving from your restaurant was unpleasant at best.",xfroZRY_A2JNekRkTh4tIA,0,0,3,7-jWBWSxzTEzG9okLhg0Mg

We ordered an iced coffee for $4, which we won't order again. Received the coffee to find out it was coffee, chocolate syrup, and nesquick powder and a ton of ice. Would have been good except they didn't stir the powder and with the shape of the glass and amount of ice they used, it makes it almost impossible to stir, so you get big globs of powder.

I was given the cinnamon stick infused bottle of maple syrup, and my friend was impressed by the way the Cinnamon Toast Crunch (the graham crackers on her s'mores waffles) were baked into the waffle. The marshmallows were toasted, much to her delight, and the chocolate chips were infused into the batter of the waffle. 

My chicken was fried exactly as it should be. No extra grease dripping off of it. The waffle was baked and crispy, I was very impressed. The maple syrup was good, although while infused with real cinnamon stick I couldn't really tell much of a difference.

The waitress we had was excellent, and while not so friendly, was a perfect server. I personally don't want conversation and strangers pretending they're my friends at breakfast, so this was perfect for me, although lonely hearts that need serving staff to be their new buddies will be disheartened. Be wary if you're a Millenial that needs everyone to be approving of their alternate lifestyle and requires everyone to care about it.

We'll  be back to b2b since we got a Groupon. It was busy here but not bad like the others previously mentioned. The place was really big, especially in comparison to the others and that's why we decided to go here. We came in and it took a little while for the people ahead of us to be seated and when they were the maitre d took a phone call instead and tried to help someone with a misplaced bracelet? Now, why do some  establishments preference people who call to someone who is either next in line or already being helped? I'll never get it. A good business would put the caller on hold. We decided to to sit down at the waiting area because I thought this might be the proper way to get help and plus my arms were getting tired of holding the baby in her car seat. But as you would've guessed, as soon as i sit down a couple comes in and gets help right away. It's s good thing they wanted to sit at the bar, so it didn't take long for me to be seated when I stepped back to the line.

My server was just ok nothing above average. Didn't ask if we wanted more to drink from our skinny glasses of juice and smoothies, which I do have to commend them for their taste. The ribeye was supposed to be medium but seemed dry at the same time, maybe it was because of the sear. I would recommend medium rare if you like medium. The chilequilas were good and tasty. The salmon on the benedict was too salty but the poached eggs were done just right, especially the yoke. Not too dry and not too runny. And the pot bread is always good.

This Sunday, I actually had a good server, which Is why I waited to do a review. I wanted to request to no be sat in a certain persons section since the last 3 times I have gone here, I've sat in his section. I got a new guy this time and wish I remembered his name. He was attentive and did his job properly and they were moderately busy. 

The ""other"" server, in the past has been outright rude. Not the best way to start a morning. We sat outside, waited about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. By then we were ready to order food and our drinks. While I was giving my food order, he was texting on his phone and missed my order. I had to do I again, then the meal was wrong. I got a rude look as he took my plate back instead of just fixing the one wrong item. So I sat with no food for about 10-15 minutes while the amazing cooks replaced the meal. 

The next time I had this server, it was barely busy, but apparently 2 servers called in sick, it was a holiday weekend. Waited over 45 minutes for our food, this same server never came to the table to fill drinks or explain. I walked to the kitchen to get my own coffee where he grabbed the cups from my hands to fill it. Also, greeted with an attitude. When I was asked by the manager how my meal was, I said ""food was great, service and server were terrible. "" she replied simply ""oh"".  I think the service here needs to be put on attention.

I arrived with my group around 10:00 AM on a Saturday and waited inside with the 35 other people waiting for their tables. Since it was pouring rain and there wasn't anywhere to stand everyone was packed like sardines inside the waiting area (which wasn't a problem, as no one can control the weather.). I was quietly chatting with my group and was rudely told to ""move away from the counter so people can pay"" by the cashier Braden. We ignored this comment and went on with our meal. Food was great and our waiter was awesome, I believe his name was Roy. He is the reason this review is getting 2 stars instead of one. When we finished our meal we met again with Braden to pay for our bill. He rudely told us he would not split our check and then went on to embarrass us as we tried to figure out the situation by shouting to the entire line of people behind us that he would ""be right with them after us."". We paid for everything and left quickly to get out of the awkward situation.

Unfortunately he ruined our experience and we will not be returning because we don't feel very welcome. He seemed to be training possibly but was left to handle a busy Saturday morning by himself without a manager and didn't do well at all. I am disappointed in the way he handled our situation and the way he embarrassed us. He should not be handling cashier if he doesn't have the people skills to keep a situation under control without publicly embarrassing an entire family. Hopefully he will continue to learn and will hopefully not do this to anyone else who visits.

Breakfast for 2 set us back $50+ with tip.  So, we decided to keep it as a special occassion, not an eating out frequently ( as we do) kinda place. Ironically, our waitress told us prices were set to go up soon.  I inquired if we could purchase 6 of the pot of bread to carry out.  She checked and told me $1.75 each, which seemed reasonable.

Yesterday, I invited a friend out for lunch, raving about how great it was.  We arrived, and the first thing I noticed was how empty the place was...I ordered the 3 eggs on top of corned beef hash dish.  I chose this over 2 other selections, located in the same area in the menu, because it included that delicious pot of bread...after asking the waitress how much it would be to order  separately...$3.50! (after being quoted $1.75 few weeks before.)  That was kind of a turn off.  My friend ordered a banana parfait, (for $9.50) it looked, and she said tasted delicious, however I noticed that the cook threw a couple of sliced banana at the bottem of the glass, no pudding, just 2 lonely banana slices at the bottem, and pudding at the top, no layering of the pudding.  It looked skimpy.

My corned beef dish arrived.  Again, skimpy portion, and no sliced potatos, just chipped beef and onions, I asked the waitress and she had no clue or offer to remedy the problem.  Only that thats the recipe, they make in-house.  The flavors were not what I expected, alot of sage, very disappointing.  Oh, and yes, they did raise their prices.

We were so excited for a new place to go and relax, and to take our friends to, and, unfortunately, their clever touches are not enough for us to go back again.  They had a good thing going, but have lost us as customers, greedy pricing, and shorting of food does not keep diners.",JVisuqf-sAYzlkwm5RAznA,0,0,2,zDhlCseHYiQgRdvsJwqr4w

I put him on the diaper changer and notice it kind of jerked out from the wall and seemed unstable, I finished the diaper change and realize that the four bolts that hold it into the wall were completely stripped and the whole changer was pulling out of the wall. This is obviously completely unsafe, and to me, an emergency, considering that this charger is over 3 feet off the ground, an infant could easily fracture their skull should they fall onto tile from that height. I immediately informed management of the problem, and instead the manager made up a flimsy excuse about teenagers breaking the diaper changer.

About 3 months later we decided to try again, changer was half fixed, the screws in the top had been replaced, but the bottom screws were still pulling out of the wall, I mean, you can literally pull the changer away from the wall, which of course will eventually cause the top screws to pull out again.

I mentioned it to a different manager and she took the opportunity to tell me how awful and crazy the old manager was, instead of just fixing the changer. She did then tell me that it was okay because two of the screws were in. I nicely explained that those changers are supposed to be installed correctly, using all four bolts, so that they are safe, and can hold the weight posted. She ensured me it would be fixed.

Guess what? Three months later, still not fixed. Still pulling out of the wall. Rise and shine complete lack of care for infant and child safety makes me question what other things they do that are less than safe.

We will never, ever be back, as I have given management almost a year to correct this extremely unsafe situation, and unfortunately it's going to take someone's infant getting injured or worse before they take this seriously. If you aren't going to fix it, at least remove the changer all together, instead of risking the safety of every child placed on that changer, whose parent may not notice the loose bolts.

Shame on you rise and shine! I will encourage all my friends and family with small children to avoid your restaurants now, and in the future.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,3,0,1,cCmgjWcHx9izbkqVDsrKPg

Love the decor & colorful upside down umbrellas & humorous other knick knack (socks, pix).  Every meal we past was fried or covered in whipped cream.  Possible that's what they are known for & why they got so many stars.

As we were seated, I had to grab a napkin to wipe off my seat, which I hate to have to do.  It has become a pet peev of mine.  I do like that as a breakfast place they have the jelly, hot sauce & sugar on the table.  

Collin our server was very nice & quick.  He also had recommendations when we asked what to drink & about their specialty 'pot of bread.'  I was not impressed w/ the taste of the pot of bread, but the presentation was very cute.  It tasted like bread w/ a slight hint of cinnamon, nothing special.  

My friend usually gets iced tea so is a great critic of it so when I saw his face after the first dirst drink I knew it wasn't good.  He described it as iced tea made w/ regular tap water.  Gross!  Collin recommended the Watermelon Strawberry juice, which was probably the best part of Jeffs meal.  He got the Bangers Omelette & I did the Lox Omelette, which I perfect at home.  My omelette was ok.  It was unevenly filled.  One bite was cream cheese, one salmon, on capers & horrible onions that I picked out.  They serve Lavazza coffee which is ok.  

I will give this place one more shot.  My dad loved the Loco Moco & I see its w/ beef & spam so dad needs to try it!  Also, next time I'll try something fried like the country fried steak.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,8,7,3,qvl4QLUqpjXR3lzeWT1GlQ

Last Friday my mom was in town and we decided to come here for breakfast before going to do some touristy stuff. My mom ordered the carrot apple juice. When the server, Freddy or Frankie? brought out the drinks he dumped her juice as well as my orange juice all over us. My mom was wearing a white shirt and I light shoes. He was very apologetic and came back with a busboy and cleaned up. However when we got our bill all that was applied was a friend's and family discount which came to about $8. My mom's shirt was ruined, my white sneakers were ruined, and we had to go home and change which messed up our plans. 
We understand accidents happen but no manager came out and when we told the girl at checkout what happened and that we'd like more of a discount she initially did not want to help at all. She ended up giving an additional $20 off but did not seem concerned when we showed her our clothing. This was not enough to replace the stained clothes and shoes and even after several washes they're ruined. Disappointed in how this was handled.

My favorite things to order here is the French press coffee and the pot of bread. What's a pot of bread you ask? It's pure heaven in a little ceramic cut. Similar to a cinnamon roll but no icing.

Absolutely in point, it was so good a tear almost came down my eye from the party in my mouth , the gravy was flavorful with a mild kick. My other half had the chicken and waffles and let me tell you that waffle was crack, the syrup dispenser had cinnamon sticks in there which added another dimension of lip-smacking flavor I didn't want to end. The portions are HUGE so good luck finishing the entire plate. It was our first visit and our server Samantha was very helpful and nice ( nice smile )since the menu is big and my wife is finicky.

Instantly fell in love with this place. The ambience is super cute and the employees all seem upbeat and in a good mood. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning.

First things first - they were ON TOP of the coffee game, yo. I rarely had to wait for a coffee refill, it just kept coming around.

My second fave thing about my experience, was that I told my server about my ""dilemma"" - that I really wanted a steak but that I REALLY wanted an omelet too (fat kid probs) and she said oh yeah, just order the steak and eggs, and we can make the eggs into an omelet for ya, and you can just pay 50 cents per each veggie you want to add. Wow! Super awesome. So it stands, I had a steak cooked medium with a 3-egg omelet with veggies. It also came with a side of toast, and of course, potatoes.

This wasn't a huge deal as we were in no rush however the server NEVER checked in on us or offered anything while we were waiting. Zero acknowledgment that the food was very very late. We were so happy when it finally arrived as we were starving and it looked really good! Looks can be deceiving. I ordered the eggs Benedict and the sauce was awful! It tasted like it was a mix, which I think is super sad at a breakfast restaurant, also one of my eggs was hard! My husband had the steak omelette and he barely touched it. The icing on the cake was when we went to pay we asked for change and our server never returned or acknowledged us again even though we sat there waiting for almost 10 minutes! He stole his tip that's for sure! Overall very very disappointing as the location and restaurant style were perfect.

The menu had numerous selections for breakfast, steaks, ham steaks, chicken fried steaks, rib eye steaks, omletes, traditional bacon and eggs.  We had the rib eye and eggs, comes with hash browns and toast however they have an item called ""bread in the pot"" it's a small hot cinnamon roll in a small cup with butter it was hot and delicious.  Our servings were nice large portions with 3 eggs.

My wife who is a coffee lover, said that their coffee was Outstanding.  They offer French Pressed Coffee too, somewhat of a nice different approach and they have a juice bar and all the juices are made right at the bar...the juice bar also makes smoothies to order.  

Breakfast is breakfast... there are numerous places to eat in this area, I would highly recommend try this one and compare to the others, this will be on the top of your list. The staff was very friendly and very attentive to our needs and well versed on all the items on the menu.

So we sat and waited. People came and also waited. After 25 minutes, we were going to inquire about the wait when another gentleman very politely spoke with the ""hostess"" to inquire about why no one was being seated when there were plenty of tables both inside and out that were available. The ""hostess"" stated that no one was being seated until all the tickets were cleared in the kitchen. While we were sitting waiting, the wait time increased significantly for newcomers. Some times were quoted at 45+ minutes. We felt this was unacceptable as we were never informed of what was happening and were not offered anything to drink, perhaps a discount for the long the wait or at the very least an apology. The gentleman asked to speak with the manager to which the ""hostess"" stated the manager had told her 10 minutes previously not to seat anyone. She apologized however she would not make eye contact when the apology was given. In fact, she completely looked the other way when she apologized not once, but twice. We ended up leaving. We advised the other patrons that were also waiting inside and out what had transpired and they left as well. The ""hostess"" had no business being in a hostess position as she had absolutely NO customer service skills. The manager should have come out and advised us what was happening and she never did. In fact, she never made eye contact to any of us. There needs to be more training or more staff. I had been there once before on a weekday morning and had a pleasant experience (other than the fact we paid almost $30 for a party of 2). Hence the reason I recommended to my family we should go.

2001418,2016-09-29,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,Been here multiple times and I've had good experiences with them. Since it is a popular breakfast spot expect it to be busy during the weekend. I hardly have to wait for a seat because I usually go with just my girlfriend. If you have a bigger party you might have to wait. If there's one thing I would suggest you try here... it's the chicken and waffles! They use chicken breast and it always comes out amazing for me. I love how it's crispy and goes well with the waffles. Their syrup is really good and they try to keep it warm at all times. As far as pricing goes it's your usual $10+ price range for almost any breakfast spot. The staff is super friendly and the establishment is clean.

The name reveals that they specialize in steak and egg dishes, and I have never been much of a fan... partially because I didn't realize how many different variations there were of this dish.

SPICE RUBBED RIB EYE WITH CHILAQUILES: This was incredible. Steak was nicely seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a huge portion of tortilla chips, beans, and cheese, along with avocado, salsa, and sour cream to doctor it to your liking. Portion is enough for two, or one, if you don't plan on eating til dinner.
CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS: HUGE steak, crunchy exterior, perfectly seasoned country gravy. This is the South on a plate. Side it with a biscuit and gravy for the full effect. It's a super-heavy dish though, consider yourself warned.
STEAK AND EGGS: The classic dish was also done well. Table agreed the steak on this plate was the best, but the hashbrown potatoes left something to be desired. Would sub for another side next time. 
DRINKS: The French press coffee and the fresh-squeezed juices are good choices, the Green Go Go juice in particular (kale, cucumber, melon, parsley).

Service was friendly, love how some of the servers are in PJs. I hear they get busy on weekends, but the food is certainly worth the wait and way better than that other nearby breakfast spot.

It was simply delicious! I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. I was excited to be having this plate since it is one of my favorite dishes but I really didn't like my plate. The chicken was bland and my waffle was extremely soggy. Needless to say I was disappointed with my dish. Now with this in mind, I was wondering if I'd give this place another shot. Let's just say if it wasn't for my husband's dish, my answer would've been no.

After 45 minutes, we checked on the status. The hostess said there was one group ahead of us and she would come outside and call. They weren't calling anyone, we saw her come outside maybe once. 

Finally, after an hour, I went back in. Our name was crossed off and the hostess tried to tell me that that wasn't us, it was a different party. Funny though, that's where I remember her writing us down and our name wasn't anywhere else on the list. 

She did not apologize or own up to their mistake, and this is what bothers me the most. I wasn't angry about the situation until she did that, if she had apologized and owned up to their error I would have happily accepted the table that they rushed to set up for us.

Instead, we left. I will never eat here on the basis of that alone, as clearly the staff isn't trained with good customer service skills and would sooner lie to a guest than remedy the situation appropriately.",D5ireMnMg23_SFecSFZ90A,2,0,1,9N_U1G9srnkCltS7OK4n4Q

The dish should come with pot of bread, biscuit or toast. He immediately came when he saw us asked for the menu again and apologized but he said this is because the iPad doesn't have an option for it. Hello. You're a waiter. You should know the menu like the back of your hand. It's your job, buddy. Not owning the mistake and quick saying no to a customer is a BAD customer service. Btw.

Btw the banana foster waffle that I ordered was okay. Good toppings but the batter was so cake-y. Not like waffle.

2167243,2017-01-17,1,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"There are two main reasons im giving this place such a low rating. 1. Being the food/prices &  2. Being the service. 

I was very excited to try this place as I had seen it frequently on my drive to work. 

Lets start off, I came here for the first time this past weekend. As soon as we were seated in our booth our waitress came to take our drink order, then headed off to get them, I ordered the watermelon strawberry juice, my sister got a Pepsi, and my mom orders the Green Juice. 10 minutes pass by and she is no where to be found, she finally comes with the Pepsi and 3 waters. My mom inquired about the juices and the waitress very rudely replies with ""Yeah i dont know whats taking them so long"" as she gestures towards the juice bar. So i asked her if she could go check for us if they were ready, and she gave me the death stare of a life time and replied with ""UM YEAH I GUESS"". She brings back the juices which are deceiving in picture on the menu, 5.25 for 8 oz of juice in a tall glass; what a rip off. After we got all our drinks it was time to order the food.  

Im a sucker for Eggs Benedict, I ordered the Steak and Eggs Benedict bagel. When our food got to the table my Benedict sauce was coagulating and separating, and my moms sourdough toast was cold and stale as a brick. So I asked if I could have them bring me new sauce on the side, and new toast, the waiter rudely informed me that I would have to pay 2.95 for a tiny size of extra sauce. I tried to explain to him that it was already cold and separated, and he spoke over me saying ""I cant control the temperature in here"". Obviously that is not what I was trying to get through to him, so I just ordered the extra sauce and left it at that I was too hungry to go around in circles with him. 

To say the least the quality of food was poor for the prices they were asking. The Benedict sauce was cheesy tasting and tasted as if it was out of a package. The eggs were snotty and slimy, poached eggs are supposed to have fully cooked whites and a runny center. The steak was charred to a crisp and when I brought it to the waitresses attention she said that it was because the base for their season steak rub is coffee grounds so it gives it a smokey flavor. This was not a smoky flavor this was completely burnt ash, and 40% of my steak was fat and gristle.  The french press coffee was bitter and gritty and tasted like nothing more than Folgers.  

Asking for anything was like pulling teeth, both waiter and waitress gave us major attitude and made it known that we were an inconvenience to them. When it came time to pay up at the front the receptionist asked how our meal was and we were honest. She said ""I appreciate your honesty and I will relay your feedback to the chef and the manager"", in the most fake tone ive ever heard, and as soon as we started to turn our backs I saw her roll her eyes and shake her head towards our waitress like we had just been ridiculous and rude. Which we were not, we were very nice about everything. 

I usually try to give places a second chance before i rate them but I dont think i will be returning. I dont like paying to be treated poorly when I ask for wrongs to be made right.

When my wife had mentioned it to a co worker they said ""oh the one on flamingo, we live that place"" what!!!! There is one close to me. 
So as the weekend neared I was pretty stocked to ride over. All I could think of is ultimate ribeye and eggs. 
So as my wife and I was seated I was ready to order. I glanced at the menu and was ready as my iced tea showed up. 
I put a little spin on my ultimate ribeye. I wanted a little spice so I had them add it and ordered my eggs over medium and extra crispy hash browns. The best part is the bread (toast, biscuit, or a cup of bread) I haven't ate any bread in weeks. So the cup of bread was a hit. Five stars for the cup of bread. 

It's a pretty nice size place. Use to be a Joes Crab Shack. They have spinning umbrella lights. Waitress wear pajamas and the bus boys wear a shirt that says ""spooning leads to forking, so don't forget to use the condiments""

2196391,2017-03-07,2,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"I debated between a 3 and 4 star review for this breakfast restaurant. The food itself was decent, but the overall experience.. I'm kinda meh on it. 

Of course, I expect pretty much any breakfast/brunch restaurant to have a wait at around 11a on a Sunday, and Rise & Shine was no exception. The wait was about 30 minutes, which wasn't terrible, but I was ready to eat by the time we were seated.

Our server, while.. serviceable, had a distinct lack of warmth. She took our orders, came back to check on us, filled our water and coffee, but it all felt very robotic, almost like we were a bother. She never cracked a smile until she handed us the bill. O-Kay.... is it chilly in here? 

The food itself was good, though. I really enjoyed my French toast crunch (I don't think that's what it was really called). The bread was just thick enough, the batter yummy, and it had just enough crunch to it. The turkey kilbasa was alright- pretty much a hot dog. The eggs were fine- although be forewarned, if you order scrambled eggs, they aren't actually scrambled. They're fried eggs mixed up in a pan. My dining companion had a real problem with this! 

I sampled a bite of the amazingly HUGE pancakes. They were good, very dense and fluffy. 

So remember the wait to get seated? Well, the wait to pay our bill was almost as long! Checkout was at the register up front, which is fine, but we stood in line at least 15 minutes in order to pay. They definitely need a better system here.

The two meals and 1 cup of coffee ended up coming to $35... a smidge over what I prefer to spend on breakfast, but oh well. 

Rise & Shine.. not bad, but I won't go out of my way to return. Shine on!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,4,3,3,IPzV75HsHYdGQVRJ23vf3w

Love it!!  We were a party of five and all of us ordered something just a bit different.  Myself, I ordered the kids + seniors special, 3 pancakes with two strips of crispy bacon and one scrambled egg. Such a deal!!! Wouldn't find this deal where I live.  The pancakes were amazing and the bacon yummy and cooked perfect.  Even my scrambled egg was cooked perfect.  My DH ordered the same, but upgraded his pancakes to the velvet pancakes for an extra dollar.  Omg they were sooooo tastey!  For coffee they even serve ""French Press"" coffee if you prefer.  Wow!  In my town, this is only served at the finer restaurants, not a breakfast spot.  When the waitress brought the carafe to the table she also brought a three sand timer so I could time and choose my own strength of coffee.

2230317,2015-08-30,1,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Food was a 4. 
Not allergen friendly AT ALL. Hashbrowns are not GF. I don't understand since Hashbrowns are literally just shredded potatoes and maybe some seasonings or veggies. $1.95 for a fruit plate. It at least was a decent size rather than a cup of fruit you would get elsewhere. I had the steak and eggs w/fruit instead of potatoes, no toast due to allergy. I made note that my daughter and I would be sharing and we both have a dairy allergy, please use no milk or butter. I ended up having a mild reaction, so that made me unhappy. Otherwise, it's kind of hard to screw up steak and eggs- one of the more simple dishes. Husband had ham & egg Benny. He said it was good and the vinaigrette was unexpected but unnecessary (hollandaise and vinaigrette was overkill sauce wise ). He said Hashbrowns were burned on the top layer and not cooked through the middle.
Service was a 2. 
I wanted to like this place. I wanted to LOVE it. I did not. Our server couldnt have acted like she cared less that we were there. We sat for probably 7-9 minutes before coffee was brought out. Never were given water. Had to ask for extra utensils. She brought out coffee once right before our food was dropped and there was no refill. Never an ask if we wanted anything else (more coffee, to go cups). It was full but there were several servers on and it wasn't insanely busy. 

It wasn't a spectacular experience. I don't expect much from breakfast joints- you go to breakfast out of convenience or leisure, not to really be wowed. I can just say that this place is probably not for me.
Might try once more and hope for a better outcome.",w3UMfW-XuIyKkgXEvK8N8g,0,0,3,UMJ7YDizGoqtUDGhlG4khg

It seems that the front  (and only visible)  entrance is up hill from the parking lot. I did not have my walker with me so was unable to walk that far unassisted. It would be nice if you posted a sign in the parking lot showing where the front entrance is.  To just walk around the building looking for a way in is very difficult on those with difficulty ambulating.

That says a whole lot about the establishment....it must be good food and greatly staffed. So my fav is the Chicken n Waffles, it's by far the best in town!! 2nd in line is the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles, it amazingly hits my palette in every way possible and never lets me down! 3rd choice would have to be my honey's fav, the New York Steak Spinach & Benedict Bagel, he can't go to this place without ordering this plate every time, it makes your tummy smile. The plates I've just mentioned are all crowd pleaders, decisions, decisions!! So my recommendation is to you I would definitely come in and checkout this breakfast joint out, even if it's for the Belgian Waffles, they won't ever come out cold. This place is all made to order. So if you are looking for a fast food place this thankfully is not a fly by the seat of your pants, kind of thing! It's a very warm and cozy spot that you can hang with all your BFF's and loved ones.

It was very busy during our visit and everyone seemed to b loving it. Our waiter was fantastic, friendly and quick.
Unfortunately my tea tasted like toilet water. It was so horrible that I had to order a new drink after one sip. I had an omelet with wheat toast. The toast was simultaneously burnt and cold. My omelet was fine.
 
(Seat check) we had to clean old food from our own seats before sitting down.

They have no breakfast sausage at all. They only offer banger sausage which is more like a bratwurst. I thought this was really weird. 

The very appealing looking pot of bread was described to us as a cinabun mixed with fresh baked bread. We're not fans. It tastes like regular bread with a hint of cinnamon.

Although the food was very underwhelming I will probably give them one more chance in the future. The problem is there are 4 or 5 fantastic breakfast places near me who always get it right.",1st2ltGKJ00ZcRsev-Ieew,1,1,3,_NlXpj6eIjCcW_v_qxumhQ

Depending on where in the lot you park, it may be challenging to find the front door, but there is a side door.

ATMOSPHERE- Its a bright inviting place, the decor was very winsome and perhaps enchanting especially the large flower decorations hanging from the ceiling.

SERVICE- Service was very attentive, and i suppose that's much better than wondering where your server is. Everything was done expeditiously. 

FOOD- The food was presented very neatly and in an appealing manner -a professional plating presentation indeed. The food tasted fresh and seemed to be up to today's standard. The OJ was freshly squeezed juice and not that syrupy stuff out of a commercial grade machine btw.

All in all it was a good breakfast, but nothing spectacular or to write home about, besides the decor and employees pajama theme (which was unique and inviting) it was a pretty basic experience and the prices were a touch higher then i'd have liked....but after some other breakfast experiences at other joints in town i wouldn't write this one off as this is a pretty good option",fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA,0,0,3,6f4sb0vw4uoAmXZB27IfEQ

Brought my brother and sister in law to this spot while they were visiting and I was really disappointed I did. They were busy so granted the wait was inevitable, not a big deal but when we were called we followed our hostess half way as she POINTED to where our table was. The menus were already placed so she didn't have to hand them to us but she couldn't even walk us to our table yet stop half way then point us in the right direction. Uhh what the heck?!

Next, our server says hello and then repeatedly asks if we want water, a couple of us said yes while the others said no. Then as she's about to leave (after only taking our drink order) she asks again if we want water because apparently ""its just a lot easier if I get you all water now rather than later"" (verbatim). First, I wasn't aware getting a glass of water was so difficult. From that point on, the service was pretty downhill since we (as the customers) were super uncomfortable asking her for anything. Not that she checked on us to see how we were doing except at the end to drop the check.

2336733,2016-07-14,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"They asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar or wait 10-15 minutes. I chose to wait for a myriad of reasons, the most prominent being that I don't like sitting by the kitchen it makes it impossible to talk. Being seated by the kitchen is the worst seat in almost any usual restaurant, so whenever a place sits me near it I tend to not come back. So we wait our time and they sit me, literally, in the table that is the absolute closest to the kitchen without being the bar. Needless to say, I started off my meal highly irritated. Worse than this, the lighting in the area I was in was horrid. I like to take pictures of my food and even my selfie ring light was not fighting the backlight from the windows. I really wish they had more inside lighting, 

However, despite my minor complaints with being seated and the lighting, I will give Rise & Shine another shot. The other features of this experience won me back over in time. Our waitress was nice, our food was good (and in some cases exceptional) and I felt really special getting to drink french press coffee. That's a nice touch! 

I had the french toast with bacon and egg in the middle and my boyfriend had a fancy steak omelette. The steak on his omelette was surprisingly good. I would even call it great. It was soft, tender, buttery, delicious - everything a steak should be. I don't like their pot-of-bread and wouldn't get it again. If you wanna try some pot-of-bread, do yourself a favor and hit up Jamms!

Coming back for the food, hoping for a slightly better atmosphere. But even if the atmosphere is the same and this doesn't end up being my cup-of-tea for a peaceful breakfast - it would make a STELLAR family option.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,1,2,4,MHfObuKkUH5kB1sB3qO5RA

My potatoes were like hay, super dry! Never got my toast. Finally after having my food for about 15-20 minutes my server checks on me....
She asks if everything is ok? I say no, my beef is still mooing. She says oh no, let me get you a new steak. She takes the steak and returns with my same steak!!!!

Hostess was prompt.

Server (Ashley) was an A+ - I'm a bit hard of hearing and she was very patient and helpful with me. I never felt unattended or rushed to get ""the table turned"". She's a keeper!!

Rib-eye, eggs, hash-browns - also an A+ - I really don't know how I could suggest any improvements to them.

Water - I choose to drink water with my meals and yours was a real disappointment compared to other restaurants in the area (Fuddruckers, Roadhouse, Famous Daves, etc). It just tasted ""off with a metal flavor"" Let's go with a D on this one.

Sourdough Toast - I guess I'd give it a C... but compared to rest of the meal it was a distraction.

Price / Value - Let's go with a B on this one.... as a consumer I'd have been blown away had it only been $10.95 (not that I suggest this is reasonable!) and I would have been disappointed had it been $18.95. Your current pricing will encourage me to return and bring others with me.

The decor, the menus, and the servers outfits all make the ambiance of the restaurant very fun and inviting and remind you of just waking up and rolling out of bed to have breakfast at a friend's cabin.

The one think you have to order is the pot of bread. It's not really a pot, it's like a cinnamon roll made in an espresso cup and comes to you warm and gooey. They also serve it with homemade cream cheese sauce to dip it in and that is one step away from heavenly goodness! So yummy, don't miss it!!

We ordered chilaquiles and chicken and waffles and we really only needed to order one or the other. The portions are incredibly large so be prepared and come with your appetite.

The other thing they do that goes above and beyond the norm, they warm their maple syrup up!!! Oh yes, you read that correctly -- warm maple syrup...it changes everything!!

Oh and if you're new to the restaurant, the server will take you on a tour of the menu!!! How adorable is that!?!?!?

The decor has a farm-country like atmosphere with bright colors and pictures of cows everywhere, can't miss any of them.

It took quite a while to get our order and I got my steak medium rare, was about 25 minutes. My steak was awesome, very little fat and tender. My eggs were over poached, I like to break it over my potatoes and couldn't quite do that because the yolk was hard. Generally when you go to breakfast places its intact and still runny. 

Aside from the wait and the eggs everything else was OK. Our waitress gave us good service, she checked on us twice after we got our food. The meal was very reasonable under $30 for me and wifey.

Ultimate
Chicken & waffle
Chilaquiles 
Banana foster waffle
Country fried steak

Cup of bread is really good when served warm!!! The first time we ordered some it was a bit cold and unenjoyable but the times when it was warm it was amazing...!! The red velvet pancakes I could go without it was like eating a whole thing of cake and that's not what I expected, but I'm sure other people would enjoy it!! It is literally 4x the size of my hand and was spilling out of the plate! Good to share with 3-4 people! Ultimate was pretty good! The steak was pretty decent, if you want medium rare I definitely recommend asking for rare instead since it continues cooking as they serve it. The eggs the first time we ordered this tasted like they had been cooked in the steal far and sauces and it was absolutely divine!! The other instances weren't the case and was lackluster. The hashbrowns are wonderful...!!! The sausages are pretty good! But not that amazing. The banana foster waffles ARE SO GOOD.... ordered it twice!! The rest weren't particularly noteworthy to be honest! 

The ambiance is great, the service is sweet and they also have cute socks for sale. It's cozy and we returned twice within our week and a half trip to LV so we definitely enjoyed our stay!",ah2yP2L78Gs0dP4IRhwdfA,1,0,5,y7LUsutryW017Knq10JvTg

2716991,2015-07-17,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Wow!  The name says ""a Steak & Egg Place"" and it's legit.  This is how you do steak and eggs, and how you create a place to enjoy eating.

Let's start with the service:  the hostess greeted my wife and I as we walked in and had us seated immediately, offering us a choice of seats:  booth, table, outdoor.  Our waitress (Chelsea) was right there with us but never in the way or overbearing.  Drinks were ordered and delivered quickly and we were given time to look over the menu--the pretty large menu!  All the usual breakfast options were there, along with a real variety of steak options.

I had the Steakhouse Omelet and was pleased when Chelsea asked me how I wanted my steak cooked.  I've had steak and eggs in a number of places over the years, but it's oddly uncommon that you get a say in how the meat is prepared.  I ordered medium and it came out perfect.  (The picture I posted didn't really do it justice).  The omelet was fluffy and full of generous amounts of everything the menu said would be in there.  My wife had the ""Two-Fisted Bagel& Egg Sandwich"" and it was put together and presented just as well as my order.  Be warned though, you might want to eat this breakfast sandwich with a fork and knife.  You can pick it up with two fists, but there might be spillage.

A few of the little things that make a nice place even better:  the cream for your coffee is fresh and comes out in a creamer rather than the more common bowl of plastic half & half containers just sitting on the table.  Water and other beverages are served in glasses, made of glass.  Each table also has a tray with salt and pepper, and a solid assortment of the more popular condiments and sauces that go well with steaks and eggs.

The restaurant interior is cool too.  Umbrellas for light fixtures, a sort of at-home feel to the tables and chairs, and a waitstaff that serves you in their pajamas.  I originally thought it might be little awkward, but it actually works to set a very comfortable environment.

Keep in mind, it's been our experience that it's hard to get in without a long wait during peak breakfast/brunch hours on the weekends.  That's because it's that good.  But if you're able, head over on a weekday and treat yourself without the wait.

Finally, ample outdoor seating and a military discount (present your ID when you pay) locks in my high score for this fine addition to the local breakfast scene on the westside.  Go and enjoy.  Your mouth will be happy!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,4,1,5,FKlNSsOnIzICXf45IOSO0Q

2853639,2017-10-20,3,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"New breakfast place! Heard about this place from a coworker. It's a bit of a drive from us but we made it after seeing the delicious Yelp photos. When I first saw it, I was thinking how big of a place it was. After we finally figured out how to get in, the decor was something else. The staff wore pajamas, there were rotating flowers hanging from the ceiling, there were paintings of farm animals. It was very interesting. 

Talk about the portions! I ordered Chicken Avocado Bacon sandwich. Price was about $9 and it was so big. The chicken comes grilled or crispy. I decided on crispy and it definitely had a kick to it. It was spicy but the right amount of spice. Comes with skinny fries, my favorite. 

The beau got the ultimate steak and eggs. Comes with 3 eggs (or you can order it with 2), hash browns and a large portion steak. The beau really loved the flavor. It tasted like it was cooked in the grill at a BBQ. The toast was even so good and it came out with whipped butter! Bomb! 

We ordered iced Italian roast coffee. It was pretty good but I think next time I'm going to get caramel roast coffee. 

Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu. This place looks promising!",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,6,3,5,sSxNcv7Zps8na81UyJA6Qg

The second time we came in on a weekday morning and it took about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at the door and get a seat. Once seated it took about 35 minutes for us to get our food. We also noticed that a few tables around us were getting impatient as well with the flow of food/service. The family sitting next to us ended up getting their whole check comped due to having to send their food back twice because of the temperature of their food. We assumed that maybe this second visit was just a bad day/one off. The third time in, my father ordered coffee and his first creamer cup showed up super dirty and he had it sent back. The second creamer was dirty as well and cracked on the inside of the spout. When we touched it part of the porcelain came off. If that had been in his coffee then we would have had a serious issue.

3157552,2017-11-05,1,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Rise & Shine is a very good American breakfast place. Me and my beautiful wife arrived there on a Sunday morning after having a terrible experience trying to grab some crepes at a small restaurant. The little restaurant got invaded by a large group of cyclists . Let me tell you about that first:

The cyclists were everywhere, I mean everywhere!!!! Sticking out of the restaurant in a large line; mostly speaking Chinese with a bunch of cameras  hanging in their neck. They had their bikes  standing all over the place and could not decide what they wanted to order. After standing at the door  letting them in and out because the line was so long, while that restaurant had only one guy cooking crepes, we decided to move on to our next bookmarked restaurant.

So, that's how we ended up at Rise & Shine! At first we were really mad about the cyclist group, but then we were glad they were there. Otherwise we would not be here at Rise & Shine right now. As we arrived in the restaurant we were welcomed by a wonderful hostess that took us to a nice table right the way. The only downside I feel about the restaurant is that the main room is very large and noisy. Besides that, this place is perfect.

They have really good and healthy food , which is our main concern as we millennials and we love an extremely healthy life style. So, lucky you for reading this review because I'm going to tell you we ordered and why it was so amazing. First of all, their portions are huge, I mean, we both do #crossfit and we eat a lot, yet still we were able to split the Ribeye breakfast dish... it was really cheap if you take in consideration that it came with two eggs, a large piece of meat  and chips with salsa avocado and beans. We also ordered two fresh juices, check my pictures of you don't believe it!!!

Rise & Shine is a must go if you are looking for a place that will fit your entire family in one large room with very large portions, cheap prices and the best quality of all: HEALTHY!!! We were pleasured to be serve by AMBER, who recommended the Ribs dish, and confirmed that the juices were made from fresh fruit . Thank you Amber, thank you Rose & Shine  for the amazing experience. Ah, one more thing, thank you Chinese  cyclists  for taking over the little crepes restaurant ;)",J4sI9iOi0ZmB7Q1t1vSqPA,0,0,5,wzSGJIvehTHJTjqkDD9uPQ
3165362,2015-05-17,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"My wife and I paid a visit for the first time on weekday just after the lunch hour. First off--great chicken fried steak. Made on premises which is a rare thing indeed. Most places use the frozen ready to cook version. I'd give it a perfect 10 except that it was a bit to 'spicy' for my personal taste (cayenne pepper?)...but very close. The gravy was also excellent.  Very good potatoes. Waiter was a good guy and attentive enough. What really surprised and disappointed me was how messy the whole place was. I am far from a 'neat-freak' but  I couldn't help but notice how dirty the men's bathroom was -- sinks filthy, toilets dirty and trash overflowing onto the floor. The main floors in the restaurant had lots of bits of food and other 'droppings' visible. I realize it was after the lunch rush but there were more employees milling around than there were customers in the place. It would seem to be a simple management decision to have someone begin an effort to clean up. Which brings me to a strange moment. When my wife and I arrived she went to the restroom while I was being seated. As I mention, the place during this time of day was far from busy and there were plenty of open tables and booths. I requested to the hostess the we be seated at a table rather than a booth. She proceeds to lead me to a table right in front of the kitchen which is a location I am usually not a snob about...however there were two workers mopping the floor in the area between the table and the kitchen entrance. I stood there kind of waiting for the mopping to get done thinking to myself ""why, in this sea of empty tables, would she interrupt these guys and want to sit us here?"" I was getting ready to nicely ask for another table when a management-type lady came over and whispered into the ear of the hostess....who then picked up our menus off the table and said to me...""oh, lets move you...I didn't realize they were mopping""?!?!?!? Wow.

So..overall a very good review for the food (other than the surprisingly dry and boring wheat toast). My wife ordered a salad and gave it a solid ""A"".   Pretty sure we'll be back -- seems like a great place to bring out-of-town guests. I am going to assume the cleanliness issues were a fluke (again, lots of various level employees milling around and not one of them cleaning -- other than our two moppers at the kitchen entrance who weren't observed doing any other cleaning up during our one hour there) rather than poor management.  This would have been a four-star review rather than a three -- and as I said -- I am NOT a clean-freak so the condition of the facility was enough to garner my attention.",xIFQ-658Sn6U1htgbLo6_w,0,1,3,-VoKlm0CbPI0yRn0eUDQrw

Still in the soft opening phase but things were running fairly well. I got my breakfast, side of fruit and toast in 3 separate deliveries for example. Not too much delay and the food came out hot so not a big deal. One minor snafu as I asked for no onions and had to send it back. Normally that would annoy me but the waitress was sweet and understanding about it and I got a new omelet quick. May not sound like it bit I felt the service was good and will only improve.

So the food. I ordered the fancy steak omelet and it was delicious. Steak was perfectly medium rare and the omelet was well prepared. Side of bernaise sauce was delicious and a great compliment. Lots of fruit as a side and the hash browns have great flavor. One pet peeve I have to mention. I hate when places don't butter your toast! Haha silly to some but I want it buttered right out of the toaster so it melts into the toast.

If rick is your server, he might not even pay attention to you. The smoothies were pretty good! I got the rib eye steak and eggs which was okay, but pretty salty.

I got sat facing the open kitchen which for me ( picky about the way the food is handled & who is preparing it ) was not off putting. The fun thing is that the servers wear pajamas. Pricing is consistent with similar restaurants, but the food I think was quite a bit better. Asked for my steak well done and unlike a lot of well done steaks I have received this one had a great char on the outside but was still tender enough on the outside ( no hockey puck here ).

On my third and last visit which also happened to be my birthday we did not even make it through coffee before a handful of issues came up.  Even something as simple as creamer for my coffee was a task proven to be challenging.  Upon checkout I had no intention of any sort of complaint - I just simply wanted to pay our tab and be on our way until I was questioned on why we were leaving without eating so, of course, I was willing to offer my feedback only to receive a very rude, defensive response from the Rise & Shine employee.

One of their highlights I would say is their pot of bread. It's almost like a cinnamon roll, and especially when you dip it into their cream cheese icing (or whatever the deliciousness is), it takes just like one. Since they have a full breakfast menu, you can get a variety of items. One of my favorites are the chilaquiles with the ribeye steak.

As we enter, at first glance I see this location is very spacious. Tables are evenly separated. The decor is bright and whimsical. Then I crowd check, not bad. There are enough guests to say ""this place is a crowd pleaser"". 
Lucky me, no waiting. We are greeted and seated rather instantly.  Waitress is very friendly and professional. 
I ordered the chilaquiles with a hard fried egg Hubby had biscuits n gravy and we split 2 pancakes. 
Inquired about the coffee, a fine Italian Import. Hubby was given a sample and really liked the 
Rich strong flavor, so he ordered a cup. 

The GM was on the floor, checking in on guests. It was so nice chatting with her. Can't wait for their new location to open.

First off, we went at 10:30 on a Sunday. Obviously, we are expecting a wait. We were told 25 minutes and they sat us pretty close to that time frame. We got a nice booth by a window. That was a pleasant surprise. One thing I noticed while waiting was the fresh juice station. That was a really neat touch and something you don't see often. It also helps swallow the $3.25 for a glass of apple juice. 

So things were starting out pretty well. The menu is expansive. Lots of options. My dad ordered ham and eggs and my boyfriend and I ordered The Ultimate Steak and Eggs. We also ordered a stack of pancakes for all of us to share. Then, we waited. And waited. And waited. Again, understandable since we could see it was busy. Still waiting. At least 30+ minutes went by. Finally our server, Brody, came up to us and said, ""Sorry for the wait on your meals but there was some confusion in the kitchen with your ticket."" I can't stand this excuse. All that means to me is that our server forgot to ring in our food, our ticket was lost, or the kitchen messed something up. But please don't say that to me like we don't know what's going on. The best way to handle that situation is to say, ""I'm sorry about the wait on your meals. I've notified a manager of the situation and we are working hard to get your good here as soon as possible. Let me grab your pancakes so you all have something to munch on."" We were brought our bread. About 10 minutes later, our food arrived. One of us missing toast. And of course, not a pancake in sight. And no mention of them coming. So I told him to forget the pancakes. The hash browns were good. The steak was okay. None of it was stand out. I feel like I could have gotten this meal anywhere. 

When we went to pay, we mentioned our disappointment to the cashier who also did nothing to try to remedy the situation. No manager came by to check on us. 40 minutes or more waiting for food is ridiculous. Even when you're busy. Most entrees come to your table within 20 minutes. The only reason I know any of this is because I've worked as a server in restaurants for over 5 years. This just wasn't a great experience because of the service.

The food does not stand out to me, but it is of good quality. I have yet to try their steak and eggs, but the pancakes, the french toast, the eggs, the eggs benedict, the hash browns, and the bacon are on par with most breakfast places. Edible, but nothing I am scrambling to come back for. Portions are typical of a standard breakfast place.

The service, however, was not good. I have been to this place three times, and every time the service has been severely lacking. Don't get within an hour of them closing, as the ambiance drops as employees begin mopping and cleaning next to you while you eat, and the servers stop caring whether you need more coffee or anything. Each time I have been it had taken a good 5 plus minutes or more before even being acknowledged after being sat. Make sure you ask for everything you need when they do talk to you, because that might be the last time someone stops by before your bill. 

Speaking of the bill, this place is pricey, especially for what you get, food and service wise.

They do fresh squeeze their juice, and you will pay for it, but it is very delicious. Consider getting the carafe if more than one person at your table is getting orange juice, it will save you a little bit.

And we're back, it wasn't just me - there are artistic umbrella-like flowers spinning from the ceiling and cute flower pot mosaics. The decor is colorful, farm and garden. And there are pajamas, the servers are actually all wearing pj's... which is encouraging- next time I'll partake and we can all be friends. I'm really enjoying the vibe.

On to the food - the portions are large and the menu has a mix of favorites and lots of mixing-it-up. The egg-in-the-hole bacon French toast sounded creative. However, I went for the Three Pigs bagel sandwich with hash browns. It was huge! The over medium eggs were cooked perfectly - that's a deal breaker, so I was very happy that they were so drippy and messy! The sandwich was a monster; it was ooey, gooey, meaty, cheesy all over the place. The sandwich was good, liked the banger especially & the everything bagel. I was not happy with the soggy hash browns that tasted weirdly burnt and soggy at the same time. The neighbors' fries looked better.  Overall, it's a bright atmosphere, service was good, and the sandwich was good & from what I've seen so far - it's a decent breakfast spot in the area.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,3,2,3,rQLD84PBOCZjx5l8gqEadA

3426806,2016-09-24,2,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"This was my first visit to this location, and unfortunately will be my last.

I made a take out order for the Smoked Salmon and Bacon Bagel, on an everything bagel for myself, then Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes, and the ULTIMATE Steak and Eggs, medium rare, and scrambled for the bf. 

I got home and opened up his steak and eggs, took a look at the steak, and was very disappointed, I had to do a double take. It was burned on the outside, over seasoned and NOT medium rare. He took a bite out of it and immediately gagged, not only was it over-seasoned, but it was spoiled. It was placed on top of the eggs and hash browns, so the taste of the meat ruined everything else in the box. 

We called and spoke to Vanessa, the manager, and expressed our disappointment in the quality of the food. She was immediately apologetic, said it was unacceptable, took our name and ensure that we would be compensated the amount for our next visit. Very well handled and extremely professional. 

We were so sickened that we ended up bringing the food back, only to realize that the location we called was the one in Southern Highlands. I was greeted by the manager Analisa at this location. I apologized for the mix-up, told her what we spoke to Vanessa about, and kindly asked Analisa to please take a moment and speak to the manager at the other store, as we explained the situation to her and she'd be able to confirm our agreement. Her immediate response was ""She's busy."" She didn't even attempt to pick up the phone. 

She looked into my box of food, and asked ""well, what's wrong with it? That's medium rare"" even after I had explained to her that it was burned and over seasoned. 

She looked at me as if I was stupid for asking her to call another location, and started to tell me that she'd comp the order OR have the food made again, but I'd have to still pay. She told me she needed the card if I wanted to be refunded and so I headed back to my car to retrieve my wallet. When I returned she had already told the cooks to start the order again, even though I did not agree to it. Turns out she was actually able to go back and just void the purchase, without the need of a card, but couldn't even provide a copy of the voided transaction at all. She even said, in a really condescending manner, ""You can come back here and try it."" My bf heard that and got upset that she was disrespectful, so he said no, that's fine, let's go, after she wrote ""VOID"" on my crumpled original transaction receipt. I walked out, and went to the car, and saw Analisa following my bf out of the door, yelling at him, in front of many of the guests that were dining on the patio. 

Extremely disappointed in the unprofessionalism of Analisa, and the staff at this location. Will not return.",voYIq2C9eAAeoQZaSyYQ8Q,5,0,1,w5fgCghiYZeaR_h6SnnLug

Two eggs (any way you like it) over easy, was fun to crack and let the yolk ooze over my chicken fried steak which was on top of a layer of shredded hash browned potatoes. The potatoes were still crisp and enjoyable. I'm not a fan of soggy hash browns.

I stopped by the Flamingo location to give their red velvet pancakes a try.
The parking and entrance set up are confusing.  The parking is on the side and behind the building.  There's a sign directing you to a ramp but I found it easier to walk through a section of parking lot.

Once inside, I was seated quickly.  The dining room is spacious and has all kinds of great eye candy hanging inside.  I believe this building used to house Joe's Crab Shack and they've done a great job of making you forget that.  

The menu is huge.  Every breakfast food imaginable is on the menu.

My server (male, forgot his name) was wonderful.  He was busy with many other tables but always kept my drink filled and made sure I was completely happy with my meal.

The red velvet pancakes were monster sized!  I'd guestimate that each piece was easily the size of a frisbee.  There were three pieces.  I wasn't crazy about their cream cheese dressing as it tasted like it had a hint of cinnamon in it.

Otherwise, the food is incredible, the hostesses are awesome, and the atmosphere is nice but they definitely need more help!",XcYOTqbY3Yr678gwWaHTJw,0,0,4,CON2LsUhjbivYG_bT232VQ

I ordered the same Omelette. It was very firm and over cooked. It also seemed to lack flavor so I found myself using half the pepper shaker to make it more palatable. Yes the pot of bread was good but I really wanted a nice omelette. The service was okay except for the cashier, not so friendly. The restaurant itself has a charming atmosphere and is decorated lovely. But if you want better prepared food then I would take the drive to their Southern Highlands location- your food will likely be much better. Or try The Original Pancake House.

I learned immediately that there was no wi-fi network available, which I find slightly ridiculous in 2018. I had my meal which was pretty boring and fairly tasteless. Upon finishing my meal, I needed to leave and asked the waitress for my part of the check to be split off so I could pay. She refused, and told me the machine could only split the check two ways (there was 6 of us). Now, I'm no genius here... But I do understand point of sale systems and I do know that they can run multiple transactions and split checks many different ways. This was merely her not wanting to do it, or restaurant policy.

3886870,2016-05-16,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"What is not to love about rise & shine, my husband and I came in on a Sunday morning before church at 9am. No wait, no line, no problems.

We were greeted by a beautiful hostess who had us promptly seated and minutes later we were greeted by our sweet and fun waitress in blue pajamas with white lining on the arms and the ends of her bottoms. (I wish I remembered her name we tipped her extra because she was perfect.) anywho, she got us drinks immediately and helped us to decipher some things on the menu. We went with the pot of bread for each of us. HELLO, so good?!? And my husband had the Italian iced coffee. 

we came with our 5 month old, they didn't have a sling or highchair for her carseat but she slept the entire time and they put her carseat in a chair, we kind of wish she woke up just so she could see the beautiful umbrellas on the ceiling. 

For our entrees I had chicken and waffles - well seasoned, slightly spicy, too much breading but so delicious... and my husband had the ultimate steak and eggs, he was so wowed by the flavor of everything on his plate he asked if we could come back with our whole family for Father's Day. 

We asked to book a table a whole month in advance for Father's Day and were told that Sunday mornings we probably shouldn't have a problem but to call ahead to get a time estimate, the manager was awesome and so was our hostess. 

Now here comes the con. - I won't mark the restaurant 4 stars just because the cashier ruined my morning so... 
We rated our visit a 15 until it was time to checkout. We approached the check out and had to check out with the woman in the front... She was happy to take my money but angry and pissed to take my virtual stamp card. As a matter of fact, she wanted me to step to the side and figure out how to make it work while she checked other people out and then when I did she gave me credit for one thing when essentially I was owed credit for the coffee, and both entrees. Makes me sad that on every table they hype up the app and if everyone gets that same push back j don't care how beautiful your establishment is, how great your food is, and how amazing your management and waitress staff is, the cashier needs an attitude adjustment. She set a bad tone for my Sunday, which was also my birthday weekend. Let her know we appreciate what help we got. So be warned, unless you've used ""epoxy"" the app before, don't ask questions when you check out.",tmhB1S_Docgp7iwugjYOsA,0,1,5,c_025gn2OWY9gqvMaiyrww

3898218,2015-08-24,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"As an avid bruncher and vegas native, I like to think I know a thing or two about local breakfast eateries. Been meaning to try this spot for a few months now as its within a few miles from home and could easily become the go to location. Made plans ahead of time with another couple who hadn't tried this spot either but was interested. 
Arrived around 11am on a Sunday to a 30 min wait. Not surprising and expected for time and day. What was surprising was how slow service seemed to move with how big the restaurant was. I've worked in the restaurant industry in the past so it didn't take long to notice where the bottleneck issues were coming from. Regardless, I wasn't too annoyed as it was still Sunday and brunchday afterall. Our servers name was Chelsea, she was super friendly and welcoming within a few seconds of seating. They have a nice looking beverage bar in the corner but not an elaborate beverage list to match. Fresh squeezed OG is available. Ambience is fun and fresh and the Jammie's are a kitchy touch. The menu has a nice variety of choices which is great but nothing signature. Chelsea informed us that the waffle iron was not working at the moment which was off to me they only had one waffle machine and cut a chunk of the menu options right away. Our table ordered a Loco Moco, Chilaquiles, chicken fried steak, and house pancakes. Drinks were quick and coffee was hot and fresh. Time seemed to have dragged on by the time our plates arrived ( We had three cups of coffee. ) Chelsea was very attentive and reassuring our order was on its way. When our food arrived it was dropped off by one staff member who could only carry 3/4 of the dishes. No biggie but she didn't acknowledge the lack of complete order and left. Pancakes arrived not too long after. These cakes were massive. I was pumped. The syrup is served warm which is great. 
FOOD QUALITY AND TASTE- the massive pancakes are a dense heavy cake and very sweet. Not fluffy like I envisioned. Too dry to eat on their own but overkill sweet with syrup. Seemed like a waffle dough/batter to me. My co-eater did eat a share as I could barely make a dent. The chilaquiles looked the part but was off in traditional red sauce flavor but not a bad try. The loco Moco comes with a teriyaki gravy poured over the dish and would have preferred it on the side. The sweet/salty flavor was overkill and ruined the dish. The spam was also on the burned side so another intense flavor added to the teriyaki gravy profile. Hard pass. The chicken fried steak was a success as were all the eggs at the table.  We didn't linger after completing our meal and walked out of there about 2 hours and $75 later. Chelsea saved the experience for us but an overall opinion of the meal won't make us regulars but worth another try.",9_4e8X1JufYQn4m0Ibx_1w,0,0,2,QF4APdGnnKQsTOckah8JCA

3974448,2015-05-19,10,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"During my Sunday morning bike rides, I had seen that Rise & Shine was opening a new location close to where I live.  I had been to the original one and I wanted to try this.  I was going to stop the week before but remembering it was Mother's Day and I knew the place would be slammed, I waited a week to go.

I went inside and had my name put on the list and requested a patio table.  When I was taken outside, I was told to pick any place I wanted.  I chose a two top in the sun. 

I was left a menu and as I looked at it, my server stopped by and asked about coffee.  I ordered the French press coffee which says 2 cups.  It yielded three plus.

I ordered the S'mores waffle.  It was a waffle with some marshmallow fluff, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and some Chex cereal for the graham cracker.  With the waffle I was served warm maple syrup with some cinnamon sticks infusing the syrup and two small cups of soft butter.

The waffle was good but I was expecting more marshmallow and less whipped cream, and Chex cereal is not really a good replacement for graham cracker.  Some squares of real graham cracker would have been better.

Service was good but I must note that I don't understand the seating problem this place seems to have.  Evidently, one person write names down, where the person requests to sit, and then hands off the person with a menu to one person who seats people coming in.  The patio was 1/3 full, the interior was about the same, and yet I waited for about 5 minutes before being shown outside.  It just seems like an inefficient system and when they're busy, I can understand the reason for the backup.

One note, if you ride here on your bike--yeah, I know, few of you will--you can lock it up using the boards on the ramp going to the entrance as the anchor for your cable and lock.

UPON ARRIVAL: Every time we've been here there has been a wait (not long) but that's a good thing-it means people like it!  They have always been very quick to seat people as soon as a table opens. 

SERVICE:  This is a big one for me,  as i work in the hospitality industry (bartender). Every time we have visited, we have received AMAZING service from EVERYONE; from the hostess,  to the server, to the food runner. 

FOOD/MENU:  Not an overly large menu but i was very pleased at the vegetable options (as I'm a vegetarian). Food is outstanding,  as everything we've ever ordered has been delicious and sizable. If you're a coffee drinker,  order the French press.. it's enough for 2 and is very tasty.  They even give you a timer so you can have it as weak or as strong as you like.

AMBIANCE/DECOR:  It is spacious enough that you don't feel like you're sitting on someone else's lap, like in other smaller breakfast places. Colorful, upside down umbrellas grace the ceiling and is very cute. The floorplan is very open, and you don't feel like you are boxed in. Restrooms are always clean.

I went up to 4 because the atmosphere, service, and portions were great. The food was pricey and it tasted okay, but not great. I had the three little piggies bagel sandwich. The concept is great: eggs, cheese, bacon, ham, and a banger sausage on a bagel. In reality, the sandwich was hard to manage. It was impossible to pick up - big, bulky, and the bottom bagel was slippery and soggy. Each element tasted good, but I didn't get to take that big bite that would meld all the elements together. The fries that came on the side were super yummy though. My honey had the chicken fried steak with country gravy, eggs, and hash browns. He said it was okay, but he wasn't really fond of the breading on the steak. All in all it was a fun experience nut the food was only okay.

The gravy was so good, perfect consistency, the biscuits were awesome, eggs - perfect! It must have come with bacon (or I stole it from someone elses's plate) but it was good! The Mister had some big breakfast with ham (I think), don't really remember, but it looked good and he was VERY happy with our meal. Our son had the philly chessesteak omelet (again, I think), and he loved it. The prices were great, too! All three of us had a wonderful meal and it was under $50! Service was amazing! From the guy who seated us, to our server, to the cashier, they were all great! The only downside was the wait - took almost an hour to get seated outside, but it could have been because there were numerous sports tournaments in the area and the place was packed. We will definitely make this place a breakfast stop-off during all of our Vegas trips!",6p36W9GQAoKUMGlnkJaotQ,0,0,5,JDjQDV2Rb9WB_tcVb-MxSA
4055125,2017-01-28,6,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place

What came first, the chicken or the egg?  

It really doesn't matter because I'm going to eat both.  Rise & Shine is known for great breakfast steaks and of course, their eggs. I've had their steaks once and have to agree with most of the Yelpers that it's pretty good, priced just right, and always perfect for breakfast.  By the way, they use only USDA prime meats here.  Lately, I have been on an egg kick.  I love eggs and can even notice the quality of them.  Here at Rise & Shine, the eggs seemed to taste a whole lot better than everyone else's.  I have no idea where Rise & Shine gets their eggs, but it's good, thick, and very fluffy when scrambled.  I'll keep my meal small with just 3 scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, 4 slices of bacon, and a chicken breast.  I call this meal the EBC for Egg, Bacon, and Chicken.  The bacon is okay, the chicken breast is flavorful, but the eggs...phenomenal.  

Prices for their set meals is about average compared to the other breakfast joints in town.  An omelet made with 3 eggs with all the carbs cost around $10.  Their steak and eggs breakfast is roughly $15. My meal is usually a little more since I am getting different proteins a la carte. The restaurant is pretty big and very popular during the weekend mornings.  As for their service, it's as good as it gets. I appreciate the fact that they're always willing to substitute items or add extra proteins for me.

The manager came out and was very nice but she then said she 100% guarantees no one on her staff would of took them, not sure how someone could make a statement like that.

For a family of 3 we spent $50 before tip ordering two of the ultimate steak and eggs and silver dollar pancakes for our child and orange juices. Second trip- Vanilla latte was great! 

They offer a potted bread which is a cinnamon bun in a cup with butter and icing on the side which I was thrilled about! Ask for the icing though. It was delicious!!

I wasn't a fan of the hash browns, a little underdone with no taste I suggest offering a substitute other than tomato and avocado. Our steaks were fantastic and flavoring was great. 

They offer freshly squeezed orange juice which is good but not worth the $5 and NO refills with a tall skinny glass. My kid had more orange juice than I did with her plastic cup so I highly suggest that be changed. 

There's no changing table in the restroom so I had to change my infant on the seat next to me. I'd certainly suggest installing that right away.",XdLQep9R3V7EHwW2fjgK-g,1,1,3,PXeBMw8__sCXotsDKvi8UQ

One of the bread options is bread in a cup, which is pretty much a cinnamon roll in a cup.  It was unique, soft, and hot.  If you like cinnamon rolls you should probably choose that as your choice of bread.  The ambiance had a bit of a whimisical feel.  There were spinning umbrellas, and the colors in the restaurant were vibrant.  They also sell silly socks and reataurant apparel and items at the front counter.  The servers also wear pajamas.

This place has some of the largest portions of food I've seen yet. As far as breakfast goes, I only know of one other place that comes close. You need to come to this restaurant prepared for a feast. It surely won't disappoint. 

My boyfriend and I came here hungry on a Sunday. We had never been. There was many people waiting in the lobby area. It took us maybe 20-30 minutes to get seated during mid-morning rush hours. They seemed like they were able to accommodate large parties. So, that's good to know. 

Our server was dressed in a llama pajama outfit. It was AWESOME. She was friendly and attentive, even though they were very busy. She made recommendations about her favorite food. My only slight annoyance was that she didn't tell us that we were ordering WAY, WAY too much food. However, that's still okay. It was worth trying all of it.

We ordered the Country Friend New York Steak & Eggs, Buffalo-Style Crispy Chicken Breasts & Eggs, and Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes. For two of us. 

All of it was fantastic. Again, if I have not made it clear enough, the portions were massively colossal to epic proportions. Yes, too much food. It was all very tasty though. We didn't want to stop eating, even though there was no dent made in the food. Hashtag, leftovers...

Overall, super awesome breakfast joint. The only possible set back is that it did take awhile to get our food once ordered. I would say 20-30 minutes, but if you're not in a rush, it is definitely worth the wait. Super happy customer here! And, again, HUGE portions.

Now the cons.  The eggs were overcooked on my benedict.  I am not a breakfast snob, but I do expect a breakfast restaurant to be able to properly cook eggs.  My husband ordered a specialty frozen/iced coffee drink, which was the worst frozen coffee ever.  Tasted like watered down hot chocolate.  No flavor.  Our server was very nice but was slow, and the check was wrong.  But the worst of it was paying.  You have to pay at the register, and we waited 20 minutes in line just to pay our check (there were only 2 parties paying ahead of us).  Not sure why it took so long, but it definitely sealed the deal on our decision never to return.  Worst dining experience in a long time.

But the HASH BROWNS... they're HORRIBLE!! I don't get it! It's like they're marinated in dish soap or something. Every single time we've been here (seriously, the streak is crazy good), we've hoped the hash browns have changed. Nope. I don't know what they use to flavor it, but food goes to waste every time. 
They're so.... weird. And leave a weird aftertaste.

It's Memorial Day weekend, and instead of a long slumber, your SO drags you out of bed promising a delicious brunch. As I reluctantly got dressed this morning, I will say I had lofty expectations for this restaurant hoping they would fill my belly without leaving my wallet empty. 

We arrived around noon on a Saturday and were seated within just a few (maybe 3-5) minutes. What awaited us at the table was a sizeable menu with the everyday breakfast items and a few curious twists. I decided on the bananas foster waffle: a delectable waffle topped with cinnamon, brown sugar bananas, orange zest, whipped cream and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Now, I know what you must be thinking. Is it breakfast? Is it lunch? Is it a shareable dessert? (Quite possibly all of the above???)

Ten minutes later, I'm staring down this beast only armed with a fork and knife. One bite in, and I'm ready to come back next weekend! This delectable treat is sure to make you reconsider stopping at a Denny's or IHOP ever again! The combo with scrambled eggs and crispy bacon (how I requested it cooked) were absolute perfection.

The ham was on the large side, cooked nicely with grill marks on the meat. The ""Cup-o-Bread"" was a soft cinnamon roll type bread baked in a small cup and was served with a small cup of something similar to the icing found on a cinnamon roll. A filling breakfast.

The hostess sat us within seconds of stepping inside and I was delighted by the decor. The waiters and waitresses get to wear pajamas which is ADORABLE and they seem so happy like they are enjoying their job. How could you not? Your in jammies! 

We ordered Steak and Eggs and coffee in a coffee press but first let me tell you about this bread in a crock the serve first. Holy man....it is all things good in this world. It is baked in this crock or dish served to you warm with cinnamon butter frosting stuff. It is delicious. As if that isn't enough goodness along came our breakfast. The steaks were cooked just as we ordered them and seasoned perfectly with this coffee rub, eggs were spot on and the hash browns crispy. Portions were perfect not overly huge and I left satisfied and not uncomfortably stuffed. 

Our server was so pleasant and had time to engage in conversation which was so nice and made us felt welcome. She didn't hover over us and wasn't intrusive she simple was genuinely a happy person I wish I had gotten her name so I could give her a shout out or so you could request her. 

They also have a cute section where they sell shirts and other gift shop type items too. 

In warmer months they have a nice size patio for outdoor dining that I can't wait to enjoy too. 

I highly recommend giving them a try and I know I will be back for sure.",Ct25jCAjdFEaq_uzgZ_M6A,1,1,5,OmiQk7T8n6lLpn898bKwBw

They do not have the banana foster waffles at the southern highland location which is a bummer because it's a closer drive.

The pancakes are favorite though. They are huge so get a half order but they are soft in the middle and have crispy edges and they're not too thick. These people know how to make it. Only issue is that I got orange juice and it was almost 6 bucks for a small glass, which is kind of overpriced in my opinion, but overall a great establishment.",nUh6FAu1TJqC6tZQPiPBmw,0,1,4,nsmLrUtTlsVGYBCsevcmlQ

I did not understand having steak for breakfast until recently trying chicken fried steak for the first time. I now get the magical combination of eggs and steak, especially if the steak is dressed in crispy batter and smothered in delicious gravy :)
That is what I had here. The country fried steak with eggs and hash, pancake, cup of bread, and fresh carrot-green apple juice. Sounds like a lot? It definitively was! I was full for the entire day AND had half left for breakfast the next day. I don't think any chicken friend steak  will be as good as the first one I had but at Rise & Shine it came pretty darn close. I enjoyed the sausage gravy and appreciate being served two cups of it, one is never enough. The potato hash was nice and crispy on the outside and eggs were made as I wanted them, over easy. 
My honey wanted the Ultimate steak and egg breakfast but with New York cut instead of ribeye. Accommodating his request, presented no problem and he loved his meal. He also had an everything bagel on the side (greedy!) that was fresh and yummy.
We shared an old fashion pancake, large enough to have as a breakfast on it's own, moist and fluffy - really delicious. I also really enjoyed the cup of bread, it's kind of like a cinnamon roll in a cup with warm cream cheese frosting on the side. Really yum. The fresh squeezed juice paired perfectly with glorious breakfast we had. 
Aside from great food, our server was sweet and accommodating. I appreciate the ability to customize and add what ever you want. The restaurant has a charming decor, with flowers everywhere. Wonderful, care free experience at Rise & Shine.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,6,6,5,bPMyr9BpSnjBESmYp0DkWQ

But, there were a few things that it didn't make 5 stars: They served this cinnamon covered roll in a little metal cup. The dough was completely raw inside the cup and inedible. This is supposed to be one of their signature items. The coffee was tasteless It's supposed to be Lavazza, if it was, someone didn't know how to brew it and they charged you extra for the coffee, Maybe it's a LV thing?

First time we came here, around 10 am, it was PACKED. Literally not a seat in the house. The staff still managed to seat us promptly and deliver our food in less time than I've waited at some Chipotle's. They were even apologetic about both the wait to be seated and the wait for food, which really wasn't long compared so other popular breakfast joints in town.

I'm a big fan of their fresh pressed juice, especially the strawberry watermelon one. TRY IT! I tend to do breakfast a bit on the healthy side, so I'm always the one ordering the egg white omelette with all sorts of substitutions. Even so, their hash browns are THE BEST. They slice the potatoes nice and thin so that they come out crispy...hopefully the way everyone likes them. That's how I like them! No soggy or greasy hash browns here!

Each time I've come in the staff has been dressed up, once for Halloween and once they were all wearing pajamas. It def gives a different vibe to your weekend breakfast routine. I love it!",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,2,2,5,sKyoSSia7_V1kKchJIrX4A

My husband had the rib eye with eggs and I got the country fried steak and eggs. Both were hearty portions and tasted great! We ended our meal with the Pot o bread. We had Chelsea as our server and service was great!

I called ahead to verify wait time and if we could bring our Frenchie. For a 70 degree Saturday morning, there was no wait for patio seating. If you do bring a pup, I recommend bringing a caribiner to hook their leash to one of the wooden poles- especially if your dog is an explorer like mine. There's also an Astro turfed area where I am assuming you can ""walk"" your dog although I wouldn't since it is so close to dining. I also fed my dog the orange garnishes that came on the plates.

1. Environment: The environment is wonderful and pretty. Very roomy and spacious with a great outdoor area with pretty flowers in the ceiling. Great for brunches and breakfast dates. 

2. Service: Since I tried this place during it's ""soft opening"" I don't think it would be fair for me to give an evaluation on it yet. But the staff was knowledgeable of the menu and gave me a great recommendation.

3. Food: O M G! I know Rise & Shine is a Steak & Egg Place but for someone that's on food rehab you can't always indulge in pancake and eggs.

The item I ordered was the Salad (with bacon, avocado, and chicken) and it was *aaaammmmmmzing* I mean, a salad is a salad, but their ingredients are fresh and the bacon is to-die-for; perfectly crispy, not too greasy, oh so nummy, f*** food rehab.

4452856,2017-08-13,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Sadly, bad experience twice in a row at Rise & Shine.   We ordered a standard breakfast that took a LONG time.  Certainly things can and do take time to prepare.  What is highly irritating is to watch several tables seated AFTER us, get their food BEFORE and LEAVE the restaurant and we STILL don't have our food.   WHAT?  We asked our server where our food was.  She came back and said that the kitchen was working on getting the poached eggs. When it was finally delivered, she was told by her manager (then told us)  poached eggs take 10 minutes.  A poached egg takes 3-4 minutes tops, not 10. 

Regardless of the preparation time,  the kitchen needs to plan accordingly to get food out in a timely manner and in order received,  not based on how long things take which is the explanation we were given.  If something does take longer, make sure your customer knows that.  But, eggs take longer?  I would assume a large portion of their items contain eggs. What about simply acknowledging the error, apologizing and making it right?    Excuses add fuel to the fire.  

The bill had coffee removed and we were given a $5.00 coupon toward our next visit.  While that was kind, management needs to fix a problem when it occurs, not wait until ""next time."" The manager also should have been proactive in coming to our table to discuss.  Our server was kind and the food good ~ none of this was her issue.   Want a happy customer? Make it a great experience!  This was not the experience we were looking for.

The restaurant was a former Joe's Crab Shack so it is pretty big inside which means if there is a wait it goes by pretty quickly. 

I ordered the Bacon & Egg in the Hole French Toast ($11.95). You can typically get half orders of the pancakes and French Toast . The one I ordered only comes in a full size because it is a specialized dish. There is a hole in the middle of the French Toast with an over hard egg in the middle. They also put bacon strips in it. This was the first time I had something like this but I really liked it. I also had a side of hashbrowns and bangers ( English Sausage). The bangers were also another first they tasted less salty then your normal sausage which is a plus for me because I hate salty foods and they hate me too! 

This is a breakfast place that is also great for groups since there is a lot of seating with big booths and tables .

In a nutshell:

Possibly the worst hollandaise I've had in ... well, ever. 

My guest had ordered the smoked salmon benedict and had the same reaction. It lacked all the classic hollandaise flavor notes, almost as if the sauce broke and they opted to serve it anyways. 

Cloying balsamic reduction drizzled all over my steak wasn't listed in the menu description and muted an otherwise perfectly cooked, well seasoned New York Steak. 

Spinach wasn't cooked for some reason, not even blanched a bit. 

My other guest was also straddling the fence on his dish. He had perfectly cooked eggs with his giant bone-in country ham steak breakfast. Our eyes lit up when the ham arrived with those beautiful cross hatch char marks from the grill. But the cost of those char marks was a very dry piece of meat that he ultimately left behind. 

On the plus side, damn amazing pancakes. Fluffy in height yet dense with flavor, spiced with cinnamon and topped with a cinnamon syrup. It was a good thing I saved it for last so I could end on a high note. Honestly, if I came back I'd be all over the griddle menu.

The hostess seemed to be in training. We followed her to our table and the entire time, she kept looking at someone else to make sure she picked the right table. I would've appreciated a more personal greeting and some eye contact. The server was better, refilling coffee every few minutes and checking to see if everything was okay. 

The menu was very confusing. I expected to see STEAK & EGGS, yet the first thing I noticed was an entire column dedicated to freshly squeezed juices. What? Apparently they have a full service juice bar in the corner. Graphically, the menu itself uses a hundred of different fonts and it just makes things look busy; nothing really leads your eye to their very small selection of actual steak & eggs.

I opted for the loco moco. I always like to try loco moco from places because there is usually a unique spin on it. I know what the traditional loco moco tastes like, so trying something new is always fun. What this place does is they use a ribeye patty and a ""gravy-yaki"" gravy. IMHO, I am not a fan of the gravy. I like regular brown gravy and teriyaki sauce separately, but in this attempt at combining the two just totally took away from the overall simplicity of what a loco moco ""should"" be. In terms of taste, it's almost there, but not quite. I think it needs another pop of flavor to tie everything together. The ribeye patty, on the other hand, was cooked to medium-rare perfection. Props to the chef in that regard!

The payment process was such a mess. It's awkward enough that they verbally ask you how much you'd like to tip on the card, but the way the girl handled the receipts and not being sure which receipt to hang on to and such just put the cherry on top of an overall, awkward experience.",0nDeoyxAaWHcihihxiIa3A,2,1,3,MIUz23QgSd0-hm7H9OHLCA

The service from her was really textbook and straight to the script which would have been fine if she wasn't actually having interactions with the other tables in our sections, maybe it was because we are a 22 year old couple with a 7 month old baby and so we seem unapproachable? Or maybe it was because we weren't an elderly couple talking about juicing. Either way it was pretty off putting on a service aspect. Anyway I ordered the loco moco medium rare and ended up with a crispy on the outside almost raw on the inside burger which was fine until my garbage disposal method of eating started to slow and I actually tasted the consistency and temperature difference of the outside and inside of the meat and felt kind of sick (it didn't actually make me sick) also kind of found it irritating that the hostess had tables waiting when there were tons of open tables.

She thought I would love it. I decided to give it a shot today since I was in the area...I can see why she recommended it.

It's a cute place that is spacious, the decor is happy, the people are all pleasant (who wouldn't be happy wearing pj's at work?!) & then the food...it's really good.

This morning I ordered:

-latte w/Nutella & whipped cream
-build your own omelette (I chose cheddar, spinach & avocado w/ the pot of bread as my side choice)
-strawberry watermelon juice

The latte was ok. Tasted more like a hot cocoa & wasn't hot enough for me. I felt like I had to drink it quick so I wouldn't lose the heat. Next time I'll opt for the French press coffee.

The omelette was pretty darn good. The egg portion was fluffy & the ingredients I added were fresh & tasty. My favorite part of the plate? The hash browns. Holy cow were those good. They are thick cut strips of real potatoes that were the perfect combo of crispy & seasoned with some softer pieces underneath. I want to high five the chef for the perfect grilling of this deliciousness on my plate.
The pot of bread that I chose was amazing too. It came out hot with a side of butter and cream cheese sauce. When I removed the bread from the pot, I found that there were swirls of cinnamon throughout it. I dipped it in the cream cheese & to my delight, I realized it was like a cinnamon roll. So so good.

The waiter recommended their fresh squeezed juices that are squeezed fresh on site. I decided I wanted something else after the quick latte so I ordered the strawberry watermelon juice. It was ok. Definitely fresh. The flavor was more watermelon than strawberry & it was sweet but had a bit of a bitter aftertaste like I had just bitten into the white/green part of the melon. I think I'll try a different flavor next time.

The service was good. I had a waiter named Roy who was patient & friendly. He was as quick as he could be. 

Overall I'm happy with the experience & will definitely come back!",vb4Y_Kw9JGS6DKgSQE_XrQ,0,0,4,0AOLX91tOXKINpYCjBAHaQ

It took 45 minutes to get our food.  Waitress was nice but 45 minutes isn't a ""little"" wait. Service was good and food was good. I was disappointed when I received my pancakes but didn't say anything to the waitress because I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for a redo. My pancakes had banana foster style bananas on too , brown sugar & pecans everywhere, whipped cream with frosted flakes on top of that. I can't have dairy so that ruined my frosted flakes. I don't like bananas foster style cooked bananas. I assumed they would be sliced and inside the pancakes, but they weren't. The menu didn't mention anything. After a few bites I started feeling very sick; I realized they must add a lot if milk to their batter (which has never happened to me before)Also the bill came to $45.

I'm a total coffee snob, so the fact they have French Press coffee is reason enough for me to go back.  I love that they bring over this little timer for you to use and decide how strong you want your coffee.  

I will also go on to say that I'm basically a retired red meat eater, so it's very rare(no pun intended) that I decide to eat a steak.  I woke up today fiending for some red meat, but I'm mulling over whether or not I want to break my meat eating for a breakfast place.  Breakfast places, even good ones, are never really known for quality steak.  

I'm glad I chose this place!  There are so many amazing options on the menu to choose from, my decision was hard, but I figured I might as well try the restaurant's namesake and I'm glad I did.  

I got the ""The Ultimate"" which was a spice-rubbed thin cut rib eye steak, potatoes, eggs and a choice of bread.  I opted for the biscuit.  

The Steak:  Juicy, full of flavor, tender and effin delicious!  Seriously, better than some middle of the road steak houses I've been to in vegas.  

The Eggs:  Eggs were eggs. They were good.

The Potatoes:  Loved them!  Kind of like wide cut hashbrowns, but better.  

The Biscuit:  Dense, soft, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  They were delicious! 

The Service: Great!  Attentive, friendly and fast. 

It will be a while before I eat red meat again, but it won't be a while before I go back.  So many other things I want to try!",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,0,0,5,mXXUDxgGhNA8dxoVppMtvg

We ended up getting the Classic Ribeye and eggs along with the country fried steak. Although the service was 5/5 food got 4/5. The Ribeye was a bit over cooked but had a great taste with the espresso seasoning. The CFS on the other hand had no taste what so ever. The batter was eh and gravy barely had any sausage and was very bland. It was fine after a little doctoring up. A bit over priced for what you get and not a lot of flavor.

He said sorry & a couple of minutes later we finally got the pot of bread. Minutes later waiter returned to say sorry for the delay for the food but there were ""issues in the kitchen."" As we are getting our food the waiter comes by & says sorry but the chef won't make my omelette with regular eggs because it's on the menu with egg whites then quickly asked if I wanted to order something else from the menu and by this time we've been waiting like 25 mins for our food. But the other waitress handing us our food says of course you can get what you order which was an omelette with regular eggs. Then the waiter says oh I didn't know that. He then says I must of not put in the order correctly. He only admitted his mistake because the other waitress said it in front of him. So first he lied by blaming the chef that the order would not be done by the chef then when he got caught he said oh yeah I must not have put the order in right. So I asked to speak with the manager, Casey, & she was amazing. She apologized & said the waiter was new and there was no excuse for waiting until the wrong order was cooked & brought it to the table. It seemed he had done this to other tables as well because the table behind us was also having issues with their order from our same waiter. Casey took care of our entire meal. I told her I wasn't looking for anything free, just making her aware of the situation but she still took care of everything. So my upsetting late late breakfast was better thanks to Casey.

Saw this place on las vegas weekly so I figured why not give it a try!
I am guessing their theme is like being in a ""farm"". There's three different doors you can enter in this place ha! As soon as you enter you'll see these umbrellas with flower print in them, some moves some doesn't. Can you imagine staring at them if everything moves? LOL. Oh and there's a big cow ""poster"" on the wall!

Loco mock - You can't expect this to be 100% good because we all know that's Hawaiian food. I ordered medium well on my patty, it's okay. I also didn't like how much gravy they put, its almost like a soup!!! Not enough rice for how big the patty is and like I said how much gravy is in it!
Chocolate milk - A place that uses milk with their powdered cocoa! I hate when places uses water with this!

The register is a step away from the hostess so you have no idea which line unless you ask. But all in all I liked it and I'll give it a second try maybe third :P",Ov2nQOBdmRMJsQVYXJAJZQ,1,1,4,4xQ5d-zfgdkIv8Gvk2poaA

I'll start by saying the place itself looks really cool! 
The vibe is super chill, big space, and all those fans on the ceiling add a unique spirit to the place. 

The food (breakfast burrito, hash brown, chikilitas and more) was good! The right combination between breakfast and brunch place with a touch of Mexican flame to it. 

The one thing I didn't like, and most likely will make me not come back will be the service. Not that it was bad, it was ok, but honestly I expect more than just ok from a place like this. Bottom line it seemed like the servers (all of them) give you the feeling like they're doing you a favor. The servers dress in Pajamas which is a cool concept, but honestly I didn't appreciate their moody tone of voice like they just got out of bed.

You read that right, they make a pancake with Bananas and Frosted Flakes in them, they also put some pecans in their for a little extra treat. I truly believe that when God created the pancake his eventual goal was the Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes. These were freaking awesome! Did I mention they were huge. A normal person needs to just ask for the to go box when the food comes out, I did. Oh and I enjoyed me some Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes the next two mornings on what I put in that to go box.

The waitstaff in pajamas is a wonderful touch and the adorable floral umbrellas overhead really brightened my day.

We came here for a very late brunch last Saturday, around 1:30-2pm? The menu was full of delicious sweet and savory things that just looked decadent and to die for. I have a hard time eating heavy food early in my day (yes, I'd slept in on a weekend in Vegas, sue me :P) so I opted for something a little fresher than the pancakes and country fried steak fare - a NY strip steak Caesar salad (dressing on the side like always). I ordered my steak rare and WAS IT EVER RARE. I love my steaks borderline mooing and this was beautiful. It was really thinly cut and just melted in my mouth. The romaine of the salad was crunchy and really fresh, and the bite to the Caesar dressing was a great complement to the steak.

I had a few sips of a friend's banana-berry-other-things smoothie and wished I'd ordered one myself. It was a little seedy but the flavor was on point.

I was, like always bummed to hear ""Is pepsi okay?"" when asking for a diet coke, and I wish I'd gotten a sierra mist or something instead of the minute maid pink lemonade that's just kinda sweet and tasteless. Oh well.

My friends were all taken aback by how delicious their meals were. I stole some fries from one and they were skinny, crunchy yet fluffy, and seasoned beautifully with a little garlic and herbs I think?

I'd love to come back here, maybe on a day when I've somehow gotten an early start (or maybe come in on a morning flight so I'm ready to stuff my face upon arrival) so that I can try some of the more luxurious things. But I'd love to come back!!",C153mp-HHFvf5G9LetRaTg,2,1,4,x8On1VHYkP8Nr8HTxeBJ9Q

I say that because I always find the smaller restaurants have the best breakfast food. I wanted to have breakfast somewhere new today on this beautiful sunny Presidents Day. I decided to come here based off Yelp (of course, duh) and hence the weather I wanted to eat outside on their patio. 

Fortunately, unlike most of you there was no wait today. The server was prompt once we were seated. The menu was overwhelming because everything looked so great. The only serve half & half and milk for creamer to your coffee. Personal preference: When you drink coffee every morning before leaving to work at home flavored creamer is just as addicting as the coffee itself. I felt obligated to order steak and eggs because that's what they're known for so there I was ordering ""The Ultimate"". I really wanted to try the bagel sandwiches but I stuck to my basic grounds for my first visit. I give my entree a 3/5 because one star for the amazing hash browns, 1 star for my eggs being over medium like I asked them to be and 1 star for my steak having the right amount of pink your average medium steak should be. The minus 2 stars for my overly seasoned steak. Did the cook accidentally smother my steak with black pepper or is this how they prep their steaks. On a higher note, my breakfast date had the three little pigs bagel entrees and her rating was a 5/5! Is noted they use high quality bacon instead of those measly small slices they serve else where. I knew I should've got the damn bagel entree to begin with, lol. 

The highlight of our visit was the pot of bread who the kind server recommended. It's a dinner roll wrapped in a cinnamon roll with a side of homemade icing. You can substitute it for your toast with your entrees. Another highlight was the MILITARY DISCOUNT WITH YOUR ID OF COURSE! I'm not military but my friend was and I feel like this discount speaks volumes.

I arrived at 2pm on a Sunday (they close at 3pm) & was seated right away. Service was excellent. I think my server's name was Roy. I love the spinning upside down umbrella decor & that all the servers wear pjs. The only thing I would recommend is to ask for the eggs benadict without the balsamic drizzle. The sweetness just doesn't compliment the hollandaise sauce. Also, the size of the pot of bread in the photos is a little misleading. It's served in a tiny espresso size cup, not a regular size coffee mug. However, it is the perfect size for a one person side dish so it didn't really bother me. I'd definitely get it again....& again.",xYHa40uGDRd1l0FR9QexyA,0,0,5,gagnH8M6MaT9oibx9joapg

The location is great and very convenient.  Just off the 215 and Flamingo.  It's in the old Joe's Crab Shack building.  The ambiance is bright and the building is huge so lots of comfortable space.  We sat inside at a 4 top table but noticed the awesome outdoor dining once we had already ordered.  

I never ever order chicken fried steak!  However, after seeing the incredible pictures posted by my fellow yeeps I took the plunge!  I orders that which I never order and I liked it! I'm sure my hips will appreciate it too.  My meal came with a choice of eggs and bread.  It was also served with the home fries that were truly amazing! I just may swing by for an order of these yummy little carbs all by themselves! They are that good!  Anyway I selected scrambled eggs and to my disappointment they were from a carton, not fresh scrambled eggs!  When your at a restaurant that specializes in breakfast one would expect fresh cracked eggs.  I opted for the biscuit as my bread choice.  It was just ok. The gravy that came with my chicken fried steak tasted homemade.  I really enjoyed it.  

On a side note, it was really nice having all the sauces on the table so I didn't have to ask.  Not only was that convenient they also had cholula!  So many times places only have tobasco! YUCK!  There was also ketchup and a-1 steak sauce.

The service was efficient yet our waitress didn't seem ""happy"".  She was ok but did not give us the feeling that she enjoyed her job. I do feel it took a long time for our meal to come out (25 minutes) however my husband did order a steak with his eggs that were over cooked.  He did mention that the steak was great!  I felt comfortable as the staff was wearing their PJ's.  Pretty cool concept!  

I opted for the 4 star rating as all in all the meal was quite good.  If I could have done 3.5 I would have.  Would have preferred fresh cracked eggs.  I will be back for some of their coffee and those damned potatoes! I'm still thinking about them!",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,23,25,4,jLb5NxDxnqWvSoCKM8QSCw
5217939,2017-10-31,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"We walked in and were told the wait would be about 10-20 mins, no problem, we looked around and read some of the funny quotes on the t-shirts , some very comical, we enjoyed the cute flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, seemed cozy and we were eager to see how the food was going to be.

We actually were seated only 10 mins of waiting, nice surprise and were sat near the fresh juice drink bar, and had to order the Watermelon juice and a fresh squeezed orange juice , yes the watermelon was fresh and not imitation, it was so refreshingly delicious, and pretty much the most flavorful item I ordered.

We came during Halloween weekend and all the staff were dressed in costumes which added to the fun environment... ""Harry Potter"" served us and he was great and knew the menu very well.

The unfortunate reason for the 3 stars was the food, although looking good, we found for some reason the eggs were a little rubbery and we had to keep adding salt...
As per recommendation of ""Harry"" as to get either the Banger sausage, the kielbasa or bacon, he raved about the bacon especially if ordered extra crispy... 
So I ordered the classic which included 2 eggs, bacon (extra crispy) and hash browns with choice of bread and of course the cinnamon pot of bread (you must try the pot of bread if you dine here a positive plug and reward for the meal). 
When the meal arrived, the bacon was barely past pink and did not stand up to attention by any means, sad...
I was only able to eat a few bites of the eggs , and no it wasn't a picky morning, just an unfortunate meal for me.
My friends got a classic with 3 egg whites and one yolk, avocado and hash browns, she also had the same problem with her eggs being rubbery and tasting like they came from a carton not a fresh egg.
And chicken fried steak and gravy 
The hash browns were almost done well enough, a bit of bite it took to eat and the steak my friend said was dry but edible.

I think something must have been wrong with the coffee machine because it tasted burnt but was cold...

So to sum up, we might give it another shot and try completely different meals but will make sure to order the watermelon juice and pot of bread for sure.

I ordered chilaquiles which is a dish i have prepared before. It contains chile sauce and is usually seved with sour cream on the side or on top with fried eggs and beans. 

On the menu it says that it is served with refried beans, sauce, cheddar cheese, sour cream, salsa, and two eggs.

What i got was basically nachos chips with NO sauce and beans under all the chips and when i asked for a little bit of sauce they took my plate and re did the whole thing which was nice of them. But when i got my plate back the plate was drenched in an exaggerated amount of sauce. It literally spilled off my plate as i put my fork in it..

And they forgot the beans. 

So i asked for a side of beans and i was so over the fact that i couldnt eat my food without spilling sauce everywhere. 

So i had about 3 bites before i pushed my plate away and just asked them to take it back. At that point i wasnt going to have them bring back a third plate. 

The manager was nice enough to take it off out bill but gave zero fucks that it even happened. But at least out server was nice.

5481344,2017-08-28,1,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"Wednesday morning in Las Vegas... normally tourists are usually heading to bed and sleeping off a hangover, or possibly donning sunglasses and lounging poolside.  But not this tourist; with family living in town, we left the air-conditioned confines of our hotel on the Strip and ventured into Spring Valley to meet my in-laws here.  Even though we were strong in numbers (7 total), we had the run of the place at 10:00 AM (which is more like 2:00 PM anywhere else in the world).

A bunch of folks ordered coffee in a French Press (which they were VERY excited about), though I abstained for java and got a glass of watermelon & strawberry juice.  After perusing the menu, I decided on the Ultimate Steak & Egg Breakfast, with 3 scrambled eggs and a ""pot of bread"" (looks like they bake the bread dough in a small coffee cup).

The food was very hearty (definitely needed in this town); my steak was perfectly medium-rare and the pot of bread was served with a sweet buttery dipping sauce.  My wife ordered the corned beef hash and was very satisfied with her selection.  Everyone in my party was pleased with their meal, and we (eventually) ventured back into the heat after breakfast.

The service was excellent... our server was very patient with us, answering all our (inane) questions about the menu.

5521107,2016-10-29,1,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 5/5
The exterior of the building is a mix between champagne mango and mustard yellow with a macaroni and cheese colored roof top. There is an outdoor patio with seating available and a small grass area circled with a fence behind it. Overall, it gives a sort of ""barn-like"" feeling. This ties in with Rise & Shine being a ""steak and eggs place"", so you think of cows and chickens. 

Inside the restaurant is spacious, tables not too close that you would feel harassed while having a conversation or intruding someone else's. Rise & Shine has floral umbrellas hanging upside from the ceiling, which are absolutely adorable. Overall, the decor is witty and gives a diner feeling. 

The waiters and waitresses are all dressed in pajamas which is a quirky plus that I found was not only cute, but suitable to market the brand of the business. 

FOOD: 4.5/5
I had brought a friend along and she ordered the fried buffalo chicken breast with hash browns and scrambled eggs, with the pot of bread. The sauce did not soak through the batter rendering the crispness to be soggy, which is a plus because many of the restaurants I go to unfortunately do this. The eggs were fresh, and the potatoes were hot, crisp on the outside, with a soft tenderness within. 

I am not a first time customer and ordered my usual: the New York strip steak spinach Benedict on an everything bagel. The taste was replicated as my prior visits, however I found that the cut of steak was much smaller this time around with the amount of spinach being quite sparse as well. But overall, the bagel was toasted perfectly leaving the inner bread tender but the exterior nice and crunchy. I asked for a medium rare steak and my expectations were met. 

SERVICE: 5/5
Typically Rise & Shine has great service, and I had that experience today as well. Our waitress constantly checked up on us to assure that my friend and I were satisfied and had everything we needed. From refills to containers for packing, she made sure to even bring along the check right away. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4.7/5
Breakfast is essentially easy when it comes to appeasing a large audience, at least when it comes down to average food, service, or visuals. To exceed expectations, niches are required, right?

The reason my review is lacking one star is because every time we are finished eating, our server disappears! Three time I've been here, we've needed boxes. They usually drop off the check for you to pay up front. The restaurant is hardly busy when we go (around 11am), so where do our servers disappear to?? 

Other than that, delicious food! Will be back.",-IM1qwYck6nqKizjCzR_ww,2,0,4,cf6ljOd8NEZK7-5yxzXXvQ

I was really excited to try this place because it caught my eye as I drove by and I'm always open to trying a cute new breakfast spot in Vegas. 

The wait was really long. That's our own fault though for deciding to wait. It was a beautiful day and patio was closed. A lot of empty tables inside. 

Food was good and presentation of the food was nice. Sadly, for all the time waiting, I was kind of just ready to move on with my day at that point. 

On the check, the server wrote in what 18% percent gratuity would be and added it in and circled the total with the 18%. Kind of tacky.

It's located on West Flamingo in the old Joe's Crab Shack. Arrived at 11am and waited 15 minutes for a table. By the end of our meal, it was actually pretty empty. 

Menu has lots of good options, it took awhile to decide what I wanted to eat as there seemed to be lots of delicious breakfast items to choose from. I finally opted for the Ultimate Steak and eggs, while my friend went with the Smoked Salmon benedict. We each ordered a juice (orange for him, strawberry watermelon for me) $4.95 each....ouch. Served in a 12 oz glass.

I ordered steak medium rare and eggs over medium. Eggs were perfect but steak was overcooked. Nice pot o bread and crispy potatoes on the side. Steak was nicely seasoned and still tender even if overcooked to medium well. My friend said the smoked salmon was really good with plenty of salmon and the hollandaise sauce seemed homemade instead of out of a can. I'll try that next time.

Service was just ok, nothing great about it. It took a good 20 minutes from order to receiving food, and then an extra 10 minutes after completing meal to get the check. 

I'll come back as many of the meals on other people's plates looked good. Chicken fried steak, and the pancakes looked delicious.

5843596,2015-07-09,0,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"I've eaten at Rise & Shine four times. Might go back just because good breakfast isn't easy to find in Vegas. Sure hotels have the $75 for two thing that could be decent but I can't find a consistent thing.

So, the reason I've been there 4 times was that #1 was pretty good. Egg white omelet that was nice and moist, not fluffed up like styrofoam and cheese melted nicely throughout. Yes the toast didn't arrive with breakfast and when it finally came it wasn't warm. Cold and bland. But OJ was great and so was the coffee even though the server asked if I wanted cream, which is odd, and didn't bring it anyway and I had to ask and wait while the coffee lost its edge. The place was crowded and we noticed the quirky umbrellas on the ceiling were for sale at $45 a pop. Being from NYC, the umbrella-on-the-go capital of the world, these seem cheap like that. You read it right. $45 clams. IN THE DESERT!!!!. The servers where pajamas and most have gray ones and you don't notice that's what they're wearing. It looks sloppy. Not really amused by it. They sell them too. Something like 25-35 clams for those. There's nothing great about them. It seemed greedy.

All in all trip #1 was decent. Trip #2 started going downhill fast. Same issue with the cream for coffee and the cold toast late with the omelet. It seemed like this is planned or something. OJ-great but this time asked twice. Egg white omelet was nothing like the first time. It was fluffed up and dry. So so but with cold toast it wasn't that good. We did try the pancakes, they were very good flavor, but arrived 5 minutes after the rest of the food. I'm pretty sure, based on when I asked, that it was a kitchen error, not server. Cause it came out right then.

I have no idea why we came a fourth time because, oh yeah, because our new favorite place across the parking lot didn't open until 7 so we drove over here, parked walked the 150 feet around the building to find they opened at 7 too. But #3 was a doosie. Yes. Had to double ask for cream for coffee. Got the late cold toast with the overcooked omelet, but the icing on the cake was the pancakes. I told the waitress we were going to take the pancakes to go. I just wanted a fork full-very good. She brought a box. I paid, we got up to go, walked out without the pancakes, got half-way around the building and ran back for them. Table was still as we left it, not cleared, but the cakes were gone. I asked and she said, well we threw them out, they couldn't leave food around, even though my unfinished omelet was still on a plate waiting for a busser. No joke. No one ran us down to say ""hey you forgot your cakes!!"" Nope. Gone. 

Never in my life have I seen this and I'm from NYC not small town America. 

So 86 Rise & Shine and their $45 dollar dopey umbrellas. The Crab Shack before it was bad too and a coat of Sesame Street yellow paint ain't changing anything.",EOCXnCvVK5pYjy1PqBffiQ,0,0,2,3dCtPzRNwquo4JG78x6qrQ

As you enter the decor is inviting with giant upside-down umbrellas painted like flowers spinning from the ceiling.  We were greeted by the holidays who sat us next to the kitchen, even though the restaurant was practically empty. There are some terms on the menu that were unfamiliar, like ""pot of bread"". We had to all and we're told that it is a lightly sweet cinnamon roll with no frosting baked in a tea cup.  I tried that ad my bread option with the 2 egg breakfast. The eggs were done as I asked and treated fine.  My husband ordered the steak and chilaquiles.  We're surprised that the chilaquiles were made with doritos chips. The steal looked like someone reused another steak and shaved it in half. When we asked for a box the server was not even curious about why my husband ate so little. The bill was $35 before tip.

The decor was nice and colorful. There was a small area that had merchandise to buy. it looked mostly like socks.  The place was big, spacious, and looked clean and organized. It looks like it would be able to host a big group.

Our waiter was wearing nursing scrubs (or I thought they were). I figured that he either got off a late shift from the previous job or was about to go to his second job. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a waitress not in working uniform either. Then it hit me.. Rise & Shine... breakfast... pajamas.. Pajamas = working uniform - haha clever.

There were so many things on the menu that I kind of got hit with analysis paralysis. I ended up settling for my safe pick, chicken and waffles, which did not disappoint me. I liked that the chicken was flattened, it makes it easier to eat it sandwich style. I like to eat my chicken and waffles with syrup and hot sauce so I was happy to see it already on the table. My friend got the steak and eggs which looked really good as well.

Unique style, big and spacious, good food, friendly staff. No complaints.",d2-084oRPaJdVZxQrwEovQ,1,1,4,KNsn89aUGCd0hkXzNakgQw

The food was ok. The idea of all fresh ingredients is great but the execution was mediocre! I have been here several times now and the last visit I ordered Chiliquillas it was as if it sat in the window waiting for the rest of the food to arrive.

I'm soo glad I wore stretchy pants coz my belly is 9 months preggo of waffles, egg, sausage and potatoes. The French press coffee was impressive. 5 minute press was stronger than my partner's farts but in a good way! Let see, what else? Our server Madison was very attentive and pleasant. She's got really nice teeth too. And quite pretty, even in her pajamas! Over all, good freaking job rise n shine. You're 5 stars in our book. We will be back as soon as we're out of our comas. K? K!

5922550,2015-06-15,2,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"I finally found a new breakfast joint! Yay! 

Came here with the bf and his parents around 11:30 on a Sunday. The wait was already 45mins and blazing hot outside. They have a small seating area inside while you wait but it was already crowded. The decor and atmosphere was bright and fun. Staff was very attentive and friendly from beginning to end. 

Now for the food! What an extensive menu! Cold pressed juices? Loco moco? Steak? Eggs? Rice? It has everything an indecisive diner could want! We ordered a chilaquiles, a Belgian waffle with all the fruit, steak and eggs and the red velvet pancakes. Oh my gosh the portions and tastes! Not as obnoxiously big as Hash House but still enough for two meals per plate. Not bad since the average price is $12 per dish. I can honestly say this is the first place I've really liked their scrambled eggs. Not underdone and seems way more than two eggs(but I'll take that!) I wish the pancakes were fluffier. And the pots of breads if you order a la carte seem small for $3+ but it all still tasted great. I also ordered the green apple carrot juice. My bf's dad was having trouble getting refills on his coffee. The server meant well and did everything he could while juggling several other tables. All good. I was happy. I'll definitely be back.

Went back there today and ordered the same thing the ribeye steak and eggs.  The steak was probably the cheapest cut of steak I've ever had.  In my picture you can see it's all fat barely edible!  The potatoes which were so amazing last time today were so overcooked and greasy.  My friends breakfast was equally disappointing.  The waitress was so annoying she was rushing us along I was halfway through my plate and put my fourth down for a minute and she tried to take my plate away?  Oh well it's a shame the food got so bad so quick.  Probably won't be back here anytime soon.,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,1,0,1,X2HO_KNmbxeDxaBRMabuig

Waited about 10 minutes because it was a pretty busy time at 11:20 but as soon as we sat the place started to clear out. Our server was very friendly and offered to review the menu since it's a little overwhelming. The three plates we had were all very large ports and I couldn't even finish my eggs and bacon.

However, based on the size of the portions versus the price charged, I feel that they were a little on the pricey side. Would I come back?  Definitely.

5960279,2015-04-19,6,698nukvxe7mq2Fra5vDikQ,"My family and I walked in around 1pm a few days after they opened and we were seated promptly. 

The restaurant is very large, unlike many other breakfast spots in town, so I was already pleasantly surprised. The decor is fun with spinning flowers dangling above the dining area and fun pictures to admire on the walls.

For my entree I decided on the fried chicken breast and waffles while my mom and fella both opted for different versions of the chilaquiles. As a last minute decision we ordered a pot o bread when we saw a bunch of them come out of the kitchen for another table, tempting us. 

Service was slow to start, but I cut them some slack since they just opened and are finding their groove. It got better and more attentive as the meal progressed. 

Our food came out and the portions were enormous, making me wish we had shared. My chicken breast eclipsed my waffle on my plate and I wish they had not places the chicken on top of the waffle since the heat seemed to make the waffle limp and a little mushy. The flavor of the waffle was good but the chicken wasn't as good as I expected. It was cooked well but the flavor of the batter seemed off. It had a spicy kick but still seemed very bland and had a starchy aftertaste that I didn't care for.

My mom and fella raved about their chilaquiles and after sampling them I can't say I agree. The temperature seemed a bit on the colder side and the cheese wasn't entirely melted. The steak that came with my fella's meal was a little over cooked and the seasoning was a bit overdone. He loved his dish, so I guess that's all that matters. The pot of bread was awful, I don't recommend this at all. It was dry and flavorless. I took a bite and left it alone. 

Overall, the service was good and the food was hit and miss. My family loved the meal so we will likely be back, but I will be sure to sample a different dish next time and hope for the best.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,14,7,2,sUzPqM8nSg7EYJJ5Y5JhSQ
