I was so glad I didn't join the Starbucks long line and really don't know why I did that for so many years. Way better drinks, very friendly staff and better price. Almost no waiting time for a drink. 

Jolly beans will the new spot for my drinks for sure.",BnHq-inVgTG5f-hHBnGsGA,4,4,5,PPpCLpDvj8nWuauWfSn5dQ

The seating is spacious but I could tell it was from a fast food restaurant setting turning into a cafe, well,it doesn't bother me. The environment was quiet with some music so I would bring my book or laptop to sit and chill.",1FSRjBgPDtWCweRl3haBuw,0,0,5,myH02u1nVGL7eyYlBoP5Ag
1920805,2016-07-03,10,_Aj02-sb1QDNIVXK64qTVw,"When I found Jolly Beans Inspirada, I loved it- my only complaint was the location. Now, they've brought their coffee to my side of town in the old Camille by Manon location!

 Location is clean and modern, with tons of windows and sunshine. Drinks include iced and hot coffees and teas, as well as smoothies (mango is my favorite!) and boba. Currently they have lunch wraps and salads available but rumor has it they're bringing their vegan menu, too- for now I'll just keep eating their buffalo chicken salad. 

Interior has a lot of seating, service is fast and friendly. They have a drive thru if you're in a hurry and they offer a happy hour with drink discounts. Hoping they make more fresh pastries as they settle in, as this location seems to have a larger kitchen.

TIP: Take advantage of their buy-one-get-one-25%-off discount for their soft opening (through July 6).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,17,4,Q24Y0Rhu6YXI1v9PM8iB6A

Mocha frappe: great flavor, sweet and caffeinated. Their coffees 'may' be the only thing that will bring me back.

Buffalo chicken wrap: no stars per my tastebuds and strange gurgles per my stomach. Buffalo flavor was too sour for my preference. It left a lingering distasteful blah on my tongue. Didn't finish it.

Coffee selection is immense!  Many syrups and styles to choose from.  Candy toppings as well for the coffee.  I stuck with a vanilla latte on cashier's suggestion, to experience the coffee a bit more.  The prices are a bit cheaper than the Seattle based competition the next street over.

Friendly staff.  They brought the food and drink over to me, see picture below.  Breakfast burrito with egg, cheese, bell pepper (mainly yellow) onion, on a Spinach Tortilla.  Pretty tasty.  Overall menu selection is limited food wise but should find something if you are hungry.  There are also a couple of vegan options and a few more if you are vegetarian.

Repainted and decorated the lobby.  Modern rustic is definitely attempted well here.  Music is easy going pop.  There are electronic outlets at the bar for those wanting it.  Overall, it is clean and kept place that can seat 50 though me and one other were the only foot traffic.  

It'll be interesting to see how they do with more people.",yIQZ6tcNsacLOyTbZJN6bQ,0,0,5,es49PRAJ7R3tKYJESJnGVQ

Mocha is a bit sweet for my taste, just tastes very sugary. The Americano I ordered today was actually pretty watery, considering I got with an extra shot. I went back and the guy working there remade it for me and it was perfect. He actually made an iced coffee with espresso, Red eye, but had that rich taste which was great. It reminded me of Americano still I've had other places.  I still think their coffee needs work, and opening up next to a starbucks maybe wasn't the best idea; But hey, maybe it will be a huge success. Good service, especially after today, I'll be back to try some food and get that Red eye again.",LnGDsxHFPhoCKT8sFGaViA,1,2,4,umR4h7iKbboOrx0vggFNCA

The coffee was good but my food was a little underwhelming. The Bagel sandwich was on a store bought bagel and didn't 'wow' me. If I'm in the neighborhood again, I might stop for coffee, so I'm not supporting the mermaid from Seattle coffee place.",SbdPXd0U-dr-S6qQwej74w,0,0,3,FNJOVnF6ZXUiVeB3aADl3Q
