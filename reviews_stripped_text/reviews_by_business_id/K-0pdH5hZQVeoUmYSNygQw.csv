I hear the shrimp is good, but I always get the carne asada burrito. It's big, full of flavor, and hard to beat. My friend got the Carne asada enchiladas. I had a taste and YUMMY! I might get them next time. I'd like to see  carnitas on their menu, but it's ok that they aren't as that would just be another temptation.
I would say you should go and try it. you WILL return.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,1,1,5,tBeeFPiHB9judj2IiefCbA

3886403,2015-05-15,0,K-0pdH5hZQVeoUmYSNygQw,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside it has a cute diner feel to it. The staff is pleasant. They have 2 TVs on opposite sides of the room tuned to the same Spanish show. They also have a jukebox and occasionally play music. They have a nice variety of meals to choose from including meals designed for 2.
  They have horchatas (no refills- waitress gave me a look when I asked for no ice- I hate paying for a glass half full of ice), which in my opinion every Mexican restaurant should offer- I love cinnamon  :)  They also have some really big margaritas. Bf loves the different types of salted rims they have- he gets Modelo with a spicy rimmed glass.
  This was our second time. Both times he ordered green chilaquiles, and he says they're good, score 8/10. Last time I ordered the chicken burrito- very good. This time I tried to order chicken tamales, but all they had was pork. So I got the chicken enchiladas plate. I usually like enchiladas, but I don't usually rhapsodize about them. However, these were so good that I actually cleaned my plate! I can't remember the last time I ate the entire portion a restaurant gave me, and I wasn't starving, but these were really good 
  Looking forward to our next trip. Thanks El Ausente  :)",nr2QuEyY_ZKicxnF4eCmLQ,0,0,4,RkA0ogBokGloCHw5hP7xhA

Now, onto the important stuff: the food. 

The salsa that accompanies the chips is fresh and flavorful. I ordered the shredded beef enchiladas. They were stuffed! The rice and beans were tasty too! I polished off the plate in about 5 minutes. 

This isn't a fancy spot. This is a place where you come with friends/family members to escape the strip and have some really good, authentic Mexican food. Everything tastes homemade and fresh!

But before I came in I could see a man in the dark dressed in black with a gun holster and then I saw a gun? Well turned out it was a security officer? Weird, and not good. Then what I ordered is easily pretty delicious anywhere in Vegas, a chicken quesadilla? But from the first bite I could taste an old greese taste..OK yukk! I was so hungry from driving around looking for where to eat..Then half way thru the meal, I had to pick the large clumps of chicken out on top of that it had almost no cheese? ..It was torturous! Then I gladly left finally..and all I could smell was from the smoke emitting from the kitchen were of the permiating old greese on the way to.my car! Ohh..never again! The waitress was pretty nice.

We have very high standards for Mexican -- after spending time there and living in the Southwest. The Chile Verde was just right and the verde sauce fresh and excellent. Corn tortillas fresh off the press. Chicken/cheese enchiladas maybe a bit too cheesy, but delicious. Even the rice and beans were outstanding. Hubby started with ceviche pulpo and it was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is indicative of the location and authenticity -- simple, but clean and the service very friendly.
