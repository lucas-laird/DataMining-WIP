Soggy egg rolls
Flavorless and mushy Won Ton Soup
Cold filling for chicken wraps, soggy rice noodles
Hard steamed rice.

Last time I was there, it was decent, hadn't been there for 2 years and thought I'd try it again. Yuck - complete bummer. Have had 3 misses so it's off our dining radar for good.

Sunday afternoon. Lot appeared to be full but when we walked in we were immediately greeted by the nicest hostess I've met. We were seated promptly and soon greeted by our server. 

I won't go into details of every little thing...but the service we received is what I expect whenever I go out for a meal. I walked in with very low expectations and left thoroughly pleased. 

While I forget his name, our server was very on top of everything & was attentive to our needs. We never had to ask for anything. His tip reflected how appreciative I was of the service he provided.

It honestly looked as if she would serve other tables and avoid eye contact at our table and pretend we weren't calling her just so she could go to the kitchen.

My husband and I eat here often because I'm gluten free and this is my only safe choice for gluten free Chinese food, but also because we're addicted to the Singapore Street Noodles. My non gluten free hubby loves the gluten free version more than the regular version. PF Changs uses different plates for gluten free dishes, they are round and have PF Changs China Bistro printed on them, this is to guarantee that gluten free orders are in fact delivered to the right people. I appreciate the extra step big time!

We always get a bowl of egg drop soup to share, my husband orders the Northern Style Ribs (not gf because they are marinated in regular soy sauce although they offer a gluten free version of the soy sauce they don't do the ribs that way), then we get the Singapore Street Noodles and Combo (chicken and pork) gluten free fried rice. Service is always good at this location and for the last 4 years we've almost always had the same server if we go in at dinner time. We always do call ahead for seating, unless you go in at lunch I strongly recommend it.

I have been frequenting this specific PF Changs for over ten years, but after tonight, I will never go again. I've been a huge fan since I was 12, and unfortunately tonight ruined it for me for the rest of my life. I went in for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend, whereupon we checked in with the two smug looking hostesses who didn't seem thrilled with their jobs.We watched as countless parties were seated before us as well as another party of three which was waiting since before we arrived. A gentleman from said party of three grew frustrated and went up to smug hostess number one and asked why some of these tables were sat before him, to which she explained the first table had a reservation, and he had overheard that the second table (a party of 4) did not have a reservation when they checked in but were still seated before him. He asked why and she didn't seem to have any answer but apologized lightly, he then resumed his seat and my boyfriend and I watched smug hostess number one look around for hostess number two, or any other employee for that matter, to make extra smug eye contact with as if to communicate her irritation with this group, though she was wrong. STRIKE ONE. Once my boyfriend and I were finally seated, a nice server came to help us. We both ordered ice waters without lemon. When the water arrived and I plunged my straw into said water, I was astonished to see a cloud of murk emerge from the depths of my cup. It looked like random white floaty shreds of gunk. I don't know what this unknown substance was, but needless to say, I lost my appetite. STRIKE TWO. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire establishment, and it made me feel dirty and I honestly can say I won't be going back ever. I'm sad about this because I love the garlic noodles here, but I will have to live without them for fear of eating from dirty dishes. It's disgusting.

It's been a few months that we've eaten here so we decided to take out dinner on our last visit it's a shame to say it was the WORST It was about an hour before closing that We had ordered our food for take out, we ordered the Chicken lettuce wraps , Crispy green beans , Changs spicy chicken, and an order of chicken and egg fried rice with no veggies (made that very clear)  ..... What we got? I honestly couldn't even tell you. We live no more then 5 minutes from this place they told us about 25 min it would be ready , when we open our food the green beans were cold and soggy like they picked them off someone's plate that left an hour ago the rice was hard and stuck together like it's been under the heat lamp with vegetables in it no taste what so ever. The changs spicy chicken was bland and the lettuce wraps lets just say I'm not ordering them any more! We called after our pick up and spoke to Erin the manager I told her I will gladly bring the food back we didn't even really touch anything . she apologized and because their kitchen was unfortunately closing and the restaurant was closing as well she could refund our money back onto a Pf Changs gift card ... I was very appreciative but that's not a chance I want to even take going back. So we had picked up a Thai chicken salad from tropical smoothie that was 10x better then what we were served!

They do have some dishes that are not that great, and if that was all I had ever ordered there, I would certainly give them a worse rating.  I do not recommend their salads, for example.

1130831,2018-04-04,0,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"What a huge disappointment this local Las Vegas Boca Park branch of PF Chang has turned out to be! PF Chang used to be one of my favorites. Even though it was always a bit more pricey than most other Asian cuisine-based restaurants, it usually seemed well worth the extra cost. This is no longer even remotely the case. 
This evening I ordered three entrees and a soup for takeout: the Mongolian beef, a chicken pad Thai, PF Chang's spicy chicken signature dish, and a large order of egg drop soup.
The soup was fine. 
The spicy ""signature"" chicken dish that was recommended by the staff tasted exactly like sweet and sour chicken and was over-cooked and mediocre at best. 
However the colossal, unforgivable failures of the evening were both the Mongolian beef and the chicken pad Thai.
The Mongolian beef was, in a word, inedible: it was tough, overcooked, way too chewy to even attempt to swallow, and beyond dry. There was absolutely no liquid, sauce or any moisture to be found in this dish. There were about eight to ten small pieces of steak in the container, which, when pro-rated at the ridiculous price of $18.50, was a serious ripoff. It was unceremoniously garnished with a few wilted green onion stalks. 
The chicken pad Thai was completely inedible as well. The rice noodles were severely undercooked and hard. Preparing rice noodles is not exactly rocket science, and yet, somehow this restaurant managed to mess them up. There was no sauce in the dish or any pad Thai sauce coating the noodles at all, making it pitifully dry and bland, had anyone been motivated to actually chew and swallow it.  No one was able to eat this dinner, except for the soup. 
The pad Thai, along with the Mongolian beef, will be brought back to the restaurant in the morning. This meal cost an astounding $63.76, and was a distasteful mistake I will not be making ever again. Shame on you, PF Chang. I won't be back.",nRX7VdpVfLcZhODN3FEEcw,1,0,1,dHsKEvX0jOpJ3rWY606ERA

The review will be focused specifically on the unique qualities of this location, although it's notable that the quality, variety, and overall enjoyability of the food are all excellent. 

For this location, I knocked one star off because on a few occasions we've had an exorbitant wait, or had mistakes with our food. The staff is always polite and considerate, and even on a weekend night they (usually) being the food without too much of a wait. 

I really enjoy the layout of this restaurant. There's no awkward corner tables where you're hidden and forgotten about, and it doesn't feel overly crowded even with a full house. There's plenty of bar seating, and the decorations are tasteful and lovely. They do a good job of keeping the sun and bright light from being overly intrusive with shades on the windows and tinted doors, which I appreciate. It keeps the restaurant open and well lit without being super annoying or sitting in an unfortunate spot where you're blinded.

Being newly vegan, my husband & I are limited on our options.  We were seated in about 1/2 the time we were told which was super and when I explained my food restrictions the waitress was very sweet and went back to grab a special list of food items.  Instead of her bringing out the list the manager Todd came out to us and went over options and even assured us they would cook our food in a fresh pan with new oil etc - which we thought was pretty great!  Our order of vegan choices were delicious...however, accidentally the waitress brought out shrimp dumplings instead of our vegetable dumplings and it wasn't discovered until I ate one and was halfway through the second one which might explain why it was extra delicious....(I AM SO SORRY SHRIMP FAMILY -- truly it was an accident)

The waitress felt so bad and apologized for the mistake - I am sure this will never happen again...she saw how choked up I was about it - as I was crying for the shrimp a little....but she was so empathetic and took full responsibility for the error and of course later a woman from the back (chef maybe?) came out to also apologize and made us a vegetable batch at no charge...At the end of the dinner, believe me the food for us was great, even for the two at our table that are carnivores they loved their chicken and enjoyed our vegan choices as well.  By the time we were done packing up our left overs - Todd came over again and had told us he had taken care of our dinner as well as gave us a card to come back again and try the vegan dishes all over again.  We couldn't have been more grateful for the AMAZING service from him as well as the wonderful people that he has on his team.  They may not be vegan now...but with that kind of care & compassion...it might be in their future one day.

I've always appreciated that this is one of the healthier restaurant chains.  There's a heavy emphasis on fresh veggies, but as long as it includes their NOTORIOUSLY addictive crispy green beans, I don't mind one bit.

So it's kind of strange that we actually didn't have the green beans on this trip. Probably because for me, at least, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps took precedence over everything. It's always been my go-to here to help me with my 'crunchy' fix. 

We also decided to chow down with Cecelia's Pork Dumplings, the Chicken AND the Pork Egg Rolls.  There were multiple orders of everything - yes, we (make that I) went a little nuts, but it wasn't a bad thing.  Paired with drinks, our ""app dinner"" was so satisfying, that we really didn't need dessert...I know that sounds like we had a choice, but we were so stuffed that we didn't.

The service was excellent as always. Not really a mystery why we hadn't been back in so long, since there are so many great places to eat in the Valley now, so that you never have to go to the Strip if you don't want to.

I'll need to leave a reminder for myself sometime, to come back to Chang's every few weeks, so I won't need the excuse of a gift card...",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,1,0,4,KScoyfFKeDet_dR1Hu6g_w

We stopped by for a quick late lunch at around 4 pm on Wednesday afternoon. As we were walking towards the host stand, one of the two hostesses (she looked middle aged, dark hair), stared at us with her mouth hanging open and then said, ""can I help you."" Asked for a table for two. ""Ummmmm, are you guys here for happy hour or no"" I say no, just lunch. She looked down for the rest of the conversation and said, ""K, this table here okay"" And points to the first booth closest to the host stand. We said sure, it was a nice table. ""K. Sit and I'll bring your menus in a sec"". We sat and a minute later, she brings our menus while looking at the bar area the whole time and walked away without saying a word. No ""enjoy your meal"", no ""enjoy"", nothing. Throughout our meal, she walked across our table talking loudly to the other employees, and once even yelling across the room to say something to a server right in front of our table. I didn't see a single smile or politeness from her to us or any other guests.

I ordered Mongolian  beef with the excitement of putting the white rice  in it to soak up all of the juicy sweet sauce and was bummed to find that the rice was laying in a deserted sea of just beef  and green onions. I can only imagine the rice's disappointment that it would not live up to its full potential of soaking up deliciousness. Instead the rice was pushed to the side like an unwanted one night stand.
The shrimp  fried rice tasted like it had seen better times but was forced to hang out in the red light district (heat lamp) before being reheated and deviously pawned off as new. There is no way that was fresh fried rice. 

I also ordered Kung Pao Chicken for my husband who can be somewhat of a Changs hater so I don't always trust his opinion but today he was right. Never a fun moment for a wife to admit that her husband is right. I took a bite and it too was dry and devoid of any sauce.

That in itself would probably rank itself in a 4 star category if you're not going down to Chinatown for the real thang.

However, the one star deduction came from the terrible misplacement of their Curb-side service.  First, curb-side usually designates that someone will probably come out to take your order or what not.   Instead, this location decided to place the signage out behind their dumpster area.  And there's no video camera or anything so no one comes out to meet you or bring your food.  You still have to head over to the front entrance and get your food from the bar area.

Second, they blocked off the sidewalk with their outdoor patio gate.  So you'll walk the long way around to get to-go food.  It's not only an afterthought for curb-side service, it's a terrible location and there's not a dedicated area for it.  If you're going to do it, do it right.  I'd probably take pointers from Darden's (Outback/Carrabba's) who's had a pickup window/door for a while and they even re-implemented their areas in older venues.

I would probably suggest that they re-do this with the parking that's facing the entrance to make this a more viable solution.  Picking up to-go food at the bar is so 1990s.",cviyGIyg_hAa8_BZ9FIFRw,1,0,3,n_9r_Ut-EecDqxAREgxTqg

The spicy tuna roll was not very good (rice was hard), lettuce wraps were what I remembered them to be, but the wings were pretty flavorful. I also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the crispy honey shrimp (which was recommended by our waitress), but other than that, all the food was saltier than the Dead Sea. Expect your blood pressure to rise sharply after eating here. 

Despite the mediocre food, the service was some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. I wish I got our waitress' name (reddish-brown hair), because she at least deserves a shoutout here. She was very friendly and accommodating, and our drinks were never empty. It got fairly busy throughout the night as well, but she consistently checked in on us. Thank you for making our dining experience much more enjoyable. 

I'm not sure if I'll be back here anytime soon unless I have a gift card that I need to use, but please give the waitress a raise because she was the star of the night.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,9,5,3,Q34h2GygxVcKbu8Px7ep4A

The Korean bbq was a first for me. I would definitely order it again. The only real complaint I have is the cleanliness of the table we were seated at. The soy sauce bottle was stuck to the table. I tried with some force to free the bottle with no success. We both laughed about it and I gave it a quick karate chop to free it from the table. There was quite a ring of stickiness left on the table once the bottle had been displaced.  Overall very pleased with the meal and the service!

The wait for me in the past has been up to a 2 hour wait so I always call ahead of time to make sure I wont have to wait too long when getting there. Parking is another thing the lot can be pretty full at times but, when people know where good food is they tend to gather!

We like getting the ""Four-Course Meal For Two For $39.99"". You get your choice of 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 small desserts. For $1.95-$3.95 you can upgrade to 1 larger dessert but for us we like choosing our own smaller ones that are included in the price already. 

I love their ""Egg Drop Soup"". It is some of the best I have ever had. I usually always start out with ""Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps"". The lettuce is always so fresh and crisp and the chicken tastes so darn good. I just can't get enough of the lettuce wraps! We also got ""Pork Fried Dumplings"". These are chocked full of delicious flavored pork. If you like dumplings then these are a must and they have veggie too. For my main meal I usually get ""Crispy Honey Chicken"". The chicken comes with crispy rice sticks under the chicken and u tell them to leave that off so I can mix my white rice with the chicken, yum! For the dessert menu I would eat one of everything it all sounds good! The dessert I did choose this time was ""Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake"". Sounds good right? It was just so-so. I wasn't upset at all it was perfectly edible the flavor just didn't add up to the name so I will try a different one next time.

I had a ""Strawberry Daiquiri"" that was $6.50 and delicious.

There is a outdoor patio if you want to eat outside.

Check out their website. They have a ""Warrior Rewards"" that gives you freebies from time to time. Just for signing up you get a free order of lettuce wraps!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,8,7,5,uwe7FpdP4tCepIM9jF3MpQ

My mom got the moo goo gai pan (sorry if misspelled and butchered) and it literally had no flavor, it was so bland that my mom had to ask for salt (which is very rare for her to ask of that which meant it seriously had no taste). My mom's friend got shrimp fried rice and their version of orange chicken which was not much different that panda express to me, just a bit better in taste.

We ordered the Tofu Lettuce Wraps and Crispy Green Beans to get the night started.  Both were awesome as usual.  One thing about PFC is that they rarely screw up the appetizers.....I can always count on a solid appetizer.

Their entrees however are going downhill.  One of my favorite dishes is the Dali Chicken, which is their spiciest Chicken dish.  When it came out, it looked dry and tough.....and it was.  You can almost see how dry it is from the picture I took.

We only ate a little bit at the restaurant because we didn't like any of our dishes and packed most of it for home...got my surprise when I ate my fried rice the next day.

First of all-If people think that going here would call itself as 'having Chinese food'. It could be farther fetched. It is Chinese-fusion at best...but that isn't even good.

Food dishes were ok. Not really any Asian flare, besides using some Asian vegetables. we had the lemon chicken, crab wontons, beef and broccoli and beef fried rice. All were just blah- the lower end Chinese take-out places are tastier than this. To top if off my fried rice had a quarter size egg shell in it...if it was like a 1/4inch piece...ok shit. An happen. But that thing was a size of a quarter...can't fish that out???? How did you not notice it fell in it.

Only 1 star for ambience. Interior is nice, semi circular bar is ok. But overall I will not go back here no recommend this place. I can get better Chinese food at China-a-go-go....and that means a lot. For the same  value at PF Chang I could get like twice the items and at least have more flavorful food.

We recently called to get an order for take out. It was a special occasion for my bf an I an wanted a nice romantic dinner at home. We called an ordered 3 appetizers an 3 main course meals. When we got the food home I couldn't believe how awful it was a the portions were barely enough. The crab won tons were burnt an the shrimp pan fried dumplings the northern style ribs were ok but not as good as when we eat in. The entree portion of Mongolian beef, honey crispy chicken were so little we could hardly share. The only entree that was a little better was the ginger chicken. It was like they had given food for maybe 1 person. It was very disappointing. I will never get take home again. Going in an eating is definitely better.

I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, and not a huge fan of chains, so though I have lived near other locations in many cities, it has never been high on my list of places to try!

I was actually pleasantly surprised. I had wonton soup, steamed pork dumplings, and the chopped chicken salad. You get a choice of dressing with the salad - ginger or sesame. I had the sesame and it was to die for! I am going to check whether they sell this by the jar, and if so, I'll definitely buy some. The food wasn't anything amazing (I thought it was the same quality you get at any generic Chinese place), but perfectly fine.

I probably wouldn't go back and eat in the actual restaurant, just because of the generic chain feel of the place. But the pick-up at the bar was easy, the staff was friendly, and it was pretty decent Chinese takeout. I'll definitely do it again!",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,1,1,3,nJZx2zrItrKVI6dQV0OH-w

They are always so busy, it takes forever to get a table.
But what really upset me is the time I called in a to-go order on a Sun night around 7 pm. When I called in the order, they said it would take 25 min. 
So when I arrived at the restaurant 25 min later, (btw I waited by the to-go register for at least 5 min without even being acknowledge by any of the staff) I was told that the order just went in and it would take another 40 min. So I just cancelled my order and walked out.
If they would've just told me on the phone when I called in order that it would take an hour, I would've been ok with that. I could've waited at home for an hour doing something worthwhile instead of wasting my time waiting at the restaurant. But they lied and said it would only take 25 min.

Service was very strange and awkward. Walked in and got a strange vibe. Barely friendly, very much to the point. ""Have you picked the entrees you want?""  Our server had lots of facial hair and we would watch him touch his beard and put chapstick on in the back, but never saw him wash his hands. That grossed us out.

The food wasn't bad, we both ended up full but it's definitely not authentic chinese. I remember coming here after a trip to China and having been disappointed I never came back. Either way it filled us up but it wasn't anything special.

I feel like this place tries so hard to pass off as elegant and what not, but I just wasn't getting that from this experience. Hardly friendly people, without good sanitation practices, with over priced entrees that you could somewhere else with larger portions for a cheaper price.

They have the a/c going like the fridge is full and we need to keep some beef from spoiling that is outside of the freezer.  This is not a one-time experience but almost every time (during summer months that is).

The food - Well, they rotate a few things in and out on the menu but usually they are introducing things that are a complimentary item to the taste buds.  My wife gets garlic snap peas which I don't believe are currently on the menu as one of the available items, but they make it for her anyway.  I always enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps (and I think this is the place that really made them popular) and like their more recent additions of the sushi rolls as well.  In addition, the Kung Pao Chicken is delightful.  I always try to enjoy the egg drop soup but they are not consistent with the viscosity of the soup and sometimes it gets more like pudding than soup and when it gets like that, you can put green dye in it and it's the same as the kids toy ""slime"".  However, that's not all the time and for the most part - I like the food.

The Staff - Most of the time, they are great and no complaints there.

To Sum up - I like the food and the staff.  However, the place is busy at times and to get a seat where you freeze your butt off after waiting a while, that sucks (and no one does anything if you mention it).  If their sister company (Pei Wei) was closer to the house, I'd bypass going inside to dine altogether and just get the food there or to go as it's just as tasty in my opinion but obviously has a more limited menu selection.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,1,3,kTY9kEfvXL0ZkfyIsuFZfQ

My meal came out fast, hot and fresh. The chicken was tender and the brocolli still slightly crisp. Mixing the sauce and the brown rice was a good way to go. The egg flower soup at the beginning of the meal was good in its own right but had a flavor I am not used to.  I ordered hot green tea. They were out of the regular organic and so they brought me tropical green tea instead. It was a little sweeter and fruitier than the tea I really wanted but it was still good. I had that pot empty by the end of my meal. To finish off my meal I ordered tiramisu for dessert. This was the only disappointing part of the meal. The taste was good but it was frozen. I've never had frozen tiramisu before. Perhaps I was just there too early and it had not defrosted yet. Whatever the case my overall experience was favorable.

4259851,2017-07-31,1,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"Pleasantly surprised it was not a busier time for lunch on a sunday (yesterday). But maybe sunday's chill time, because some people have church, maybe more people go out for breakfast vs. lunch, maybe there are a lot of other dining choices on the area (Summerlin's growing). Well, it was nice, to get seated right away, so no complaints here. (Maybe I'm comparing it to the touristy one on Paradise and Flamingo, which was always jam-packed, in previous visits over the years.) 

We (my husband, our son, me, my Mother-In-Law and her husband) had a bunch of different things, family style. The food: Chang's Lettuce Wraps (a classic PF Chang's favorite; always yummy!), Hokkien Street Noodles- combo (new recipe, curry), Sesame Chicken (broccoli and peppers- crisp), Mongolian Beef (tender flank steak with garlic, green onion; one of their best dishes, not spicy), Chicken Fried Rice (egg, carrots, bean sprouts, green onion; cooked perfectly), and, later, Signature Lo Mein (egg noddle, mushrooms, asian vegetables; excellent taste!). Everything was delicious, except the new recipe Hokkien Street Noodles (thin rice noodles, curry sauce, chicken, shrimp, egg, onion, julienned vegetables)---this was terrible. So we sent it back. I am not a fan of curry unless it is Thai curry. I don't even like the smell of the other curry, either. Sorry, just being honest.   

The menu is pretty varied, not just Chinese, but explore flavors of Asia; there is something for everyone- Chinese (dim sum), Vietnamese (lava cake), Japanese (sushi). The following menu types are: street fare, dim sum, salads, sushi, market sides, soups, main entrees: chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian, noodles & rice. There are also gluten-free selections, kids menu (desserts too), beverage, & daily squeeze, and desserts. Weekday Lunch pairings (just to name a few, ahi poke bowl, chang's lettuce wraps, with soup, salad, or spring rolls; $10.95- $12.50) and wok classics (sesame chicken, miso glazed salmon, beef with broccoli, just to name a few) are for monday through friday, until 4 pm (pricing ranges from $9.50 to $12.50). Also does takeout, BTW. I got a menu for when we get the hankering. 

The food philosophy is Farm to Wok. The food is cooked fresh (made to order). I also like the fact that all the meat (including seafood) sources are USA-based, as well, as the white rice and brown rice (in light of ""plastic rice"", I'm sure you can appreciate this too).   

The service was excellent, from the hostess (very nice), to our server (she was also patient, when we were all looking at the menu, trying to figure out what we all wanted), to the exit (we were thanked for coming in and received goodbye greetings). Our server was apologetic when we didn't like the Hokkien Street Noodles (all it took was one bite for me to agree that it was not good), and she was very attentive- filling up our waters without us asking and she checked on us several times to see how we were doing. She packed up all the leftovers for us too, complete with a bag.   

The ambiance was very nice. It's elegant. There are a couple statues in the lobby, where there is also seating should there be a wait. Plush booth seating (near the window) and tables/ chairs. Not your typical Asian eatery. I'm not saying that all the restaurants in China Town are dumps, I'm just saying, that this one's slightly elevated than the typical norm. Sometimes, you visit small restaurants, local ones near your home, and sometimes, you also want to enjoy the atmosphere, too. Isn't variety the spice of life?   

Join the club, get points to get started, earn freebies. Just give your server your telephone number. Not sure if there is an expiration date to collecting the points (some clubs have one).",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,5,kAP7kghjTaHR-2rS_J5prA

What I really like is their outside seating area. When it's winter time, they have heaters and clear covers in the patio area so that there's less cold air coming into the seating area. There was a large group of high school kids getting ready for homing coming that sitting across from us, a group of about 20, so if you're the type that likes to dine with a gigantic group, they have the capability to accommodate you, I'm sure they need notice for a group that large though. 

I liked their food, it's basically over priced Chinese food with modernized, Chinese looking decor in the restaurant. Honestly, I'd rather go to some place in China Town. The only reason why we end up going to any PF Chang's is because we have a gift card. But, it does the job.

I know it's embarrassing for an Asian guy like me to enjoy dining at P.F Chang. Paul Fleming Chang that is! That's as authentic as it gets. 

There's really nothing you can complain about, the service here is top notch. Food comes out like a well orchestrated symphony. There's only 2 things I order here and highly recommend. Ma Po Tofu and Kung Pao Shrimp. Both highly addictive items! I'm not sure if it's the saltiness, or the crunchiness or the combination of both.  The Tofu comes with crispy steamed broccoli to make you feel better about yourself for the meal.",PAzgMhSXGokkOw2CMZUI1w,2,1,4,-M1ogMTlDreQr9tJ_Q_5sg

I always get the same thing when I go to PF Changs - Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Double Pan Fried Beef Noodles. 
However, they are now offering a Pre-Fix menu for 2 for $39.99 and my noodles were not on the menu.  I decided to be brave, and try something new.

Our waiter and I had already created a rapport over my indecision on my drink choice, so I when I asked him about my meal choice he told me to try the Mongolian beef instead while my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Chicken.  He said that I would never want my pan fried noodles again after the Mongolian Beef....so I took his word and tried something new.  He apparently told the cook to make mine extra crispy without asking my preference first - little did he know, I LOVE crispy grilled beef bits. I char my Korean BBQ because I love those burned edges so much (even though I order steaks med rare) so when a full plate of little sweet charred pieced of beef came to my table with a thick sauce I was in heaven.

Our waiter (Nicholas) even suggested next time how I order the Mongolian beef a bit spicier with asparagus to really fit in with my preferences and he was spot on about how I had told my boyfriend how I would like it a bit spicier next time and came with beans instead of 
shallots.  It was like he read my mind!",P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,1,1,5,HwM0Eb3mWV0a_JZLuoz6Pw

4484632,2011-10-16,1,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"I usually run the other way when it comes to chain restaurants, but we've had a $50 gift card for P.F. Chang's that was given to us about six months ago and finally decided to bite the bullet.  I've been to the one on the Strip twice, but that was a long time ago, my only memory being grease, and more grease.  So I wasn't particularly looking forward to dinner tonight.  But 50 bucks is 50 bucks, so...

The economy must have gotten to PFC:  Saturday night and no wait for a table at 9:00 pm.  I settled on a glass of white zin (yeah, I know, Kool-Aid), and hubby ordered a Newcastle on draft.  I see-sawed between ordering a la carte, since the Spiced Lamb sounded interesting, and the 39.99 Four-Course dinner, until the waitress said that the Sesame Chicken on the dinner was really, really good.  So we went for it.

I was totally surprised.  The Hot & Sour Soup, while not overwhelmingly spicy, was delicious, not overly glutinous, and had a generous helping of both pork and tofu.  

The lettuce wraps were very good, and we were offered a second helping of lettuce, since the first batch didn't make a dent in the large portion of chicken and crispy rice noodles.  

By that time we were pretty full, so dinner tomorrow night will be our leftovers:  that excellent Sesame Chicken, and the Kung Pao Shrimp, which was terrific, but would have been even better if I ever could remember to have the kitchen NOT add any additional salt.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't like shrimp!!  Best of all was the absence of the pools of grease that I remember from the Strip location.  There was even a lot less oil than we get at our usual New York Chinese Restaurant go-to, and the ambience is a lot nicer.

The Prix Fixe includes two desserts, and there are eight mini desserts to choose from, all served in shooter glasses.  I had the Lemon Tres Leche [sic], which didn't taste at all like the usual Tres Leches dessert, but was astoundingly good, so much so that the little shooter seemed much more dessert than I should be eating.  Hubby had the Apple Pie, and liked it a lot.  But mine was better!!

Our server, Nancy, was outstanding - everything a server should be:  friendly, helpful, patient, efficient, and accommodating.  

All in all, we had a terrific meal in an attractive place, and would have enjoyed it just as much if we actually had to pay for it!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,2,4,fSxWtsdtcUq9TmoIk5-N-A

Me nor my children(4) had ever eaten there before but my husband had but not the location on Rampart and not in the last 5 1/2yrs.  We arrived on a Saturday without reservations (they take and plz make reservations before hand) a little 5:30pm.  The hostess greeted us and advised us of a 40-60 minute wait.  We were in no rush. We waited all of 40 minutes , despite some ppl walked in with no reservation or in parties of 2 or 3 were seated in booths large enough to accommodate 6ppl 2 adults and 4 kids. I was highly dissatisfied where they seated us and requested a manager. Dave the manager listened and re-sat us, not to mention he sent over lettuce wraps which were  phenomenal! David our server who I planned on tipping only 15% because i was livid, earned every bit of the 22% tip. David the server was versed in menu items, drinks, and was so personable we enjoyed ourselves!  Dave the manager was equally as knowledgeable if not more and earned our returned business.

I asked if we could have another complete set.  No apology what so ever.  I had to ask twice for a refill of my soda.  My wife asked how long for a couple spring rolls.  He said 5 min.  15 min later he asks if we were ready for desert.  No egg rolls had arrived yet!  He went to get them.  We waited another 15 min for the check.  Keep in mind all our dishes were picked up.  Finally it came and again no apology for any part of the poor service.  I placed my cc'd down and waited..... And waited..... And then some more.  My wife and I gave up and came up with the cash between both of us.  I did have to go to the bar and ask for change.  That part was fast and efficient!

I took my 15 year old nephew here for his birthday and it was his first time eating at PFC. We had been shopping and running around all day so we were starving.  He asked me too order for him cause he didn't know what to get. 

So I got the chicken lettuce wraps, fried rice, orange chicken, edamame, and a sushi roll. 

They brought the lettuce wraps out with the Fried rice and orange chicken. My nephew and I both made a wrap and devoured it. My last bite of the wrap I noticed something strange as I'm chewing; In my head im thinking is this a mushroom or maybe tofu and then start to realize something isn't right!?!? I spit it out on my side plate and it was a huge chunk of RAW CHICKEN! I started digging through the dish and almost the entire dish was raw. I almost puked. 

I called the waitress over to the table and brought it to her attention. Mind you the restaurant was full and I'm trying my hardest to not make a scene but guests around me can hear the waitress and I talking about it and they proceed to start digging through their dishes.

The waitress took the plate away and grabbed the manager. I do want to say that the waitress was extremely nice and very helpful however embarrassed.

The manager comes over to my table and expresses her disappointment and said she will fix it immediately. Keep in mind the rest of my food came out at the same exact time as the lettuce wraps and during this whole ordeal it's sitting there getting cold. 

I could keep going on and on about my experience but long story short they did nothing but take off the lettuce wraps off of the bill. The least they could have done was comp the measly $50 bill.

4565888,2011-01-27,0,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"I gotta say, I have been a fan of PF Changs for some time as a go to option for ""higher end"" Asian food. I was let down this time though . Granted we stopped in during several of the largest trade shows in Las Vegas, so the restaurant was PACKED, but it just didn't seem like anyone was on their game. My friend and I (no, it's not what you think!) stopped in to get looking for some decent, non casino food and we left really wanting. This is one of the ""smaller"" locations it seemed in both parking lot and restaurant size, so that probably magnified the difficulties they had. Our experience started off when we pulled in to the parking lot and were greeted by the valet telling us the only option, other than across the street was to valet our ""big ole truck"". This wasn't a big deal as we didn't want to walk anyways. However, we were a bit irked when the valet told us we needed to get out car, or at least the key within the next hour and a half as they would be closing at 10ish, valet included. I almost voiced an opposition to continuing in as I did not want to be rushed in what already seemed like a packed restaurant...This is VEGAS for crying out loud!
No worries. We did get seated pretty fast as there was only two of us. The waiter definitely got this place an additional star as he was attentive and informative. He got out orders in and going in great order and stopped by several times to refill us on drinks. We ordered a few standbys, Kung Pow chicken and Crispy beef. What a let down! The chicken appeared to be sautéed chicken and peanuts with a little sauce, and my beef was too chewy for my liking. Both made us think that perhaps we had gotten the PF Changs frozen entrée's they now sell in the supermarkets? The highlight for me was the house ginger beer. I must have had three of these damn things. I enjoy a good, unique beer and this was killer! This was a light tasting heff type unfiltered beer with a fantastic sweet/spicy aftertaste of genuine ginger. I might hit up the local PF Change to see if they have this on it's own.
I guess we went in hoping for average to above average and left feeling we got below average from a restaurant chain that makes it's reputation on being above average. I'll give them a second chance, but in a town with almost as many eating options as ways to loose your money, why try again?",Im_pTCVCm-xCvvim1JtdPg,0,0,2,aT21BD5W-6z2jHVIAYG30w

The one item on the menu really worthy of praise is the Oolong marinated Sea Bass. When prepared properly it's delicious, but even this dish can be hit or miss. The first few times I tried it the fish was perfectly seared, crispy on the outside and buttery soft in the center. The last time I ordered the Sea Bass, it tasted so different... almost like it was steamed instead of seared. Not crisp, just sort of mushy. 

The rest of the menu items I have tried have just been alright, not bad but not great. Lettuce wraps were a bit bland, spare ribs were rubbery, egg rolls were mediocre.

The servers mixing up their own style of sauce can be fun, the new mini desserts are a nice touch, there's a full bar. The Vietnamese crab salad is good, I think it is a seasonal irem.

the other night i got together  with some good friends and we ate here since i had a giftcard. we started off with the vegetarian letttuce cups and i give those 4 stars. it has the same flavor as the chicken but they cut up the tofu so small you cant tell that it isn't meat. i might actually prefer this version since you don't get as full. 

i ordered chang's spicy chicken.. which honestly was like orange chicken from panda. lol. nothing wrong with that but the chicken wasn't crispy so it was a little disappointing. there was no spice at all.. 

my friend ordered the honey chicken and i tried a piece. it was really good. i knew i had ordered the wrong thing when i tried hers. lol she also wished that the chicken was crispy. the description says ""crispy"" but the sauce they use makes everything a little soggy. and FYI as leftovers my food was not good at all :(

We had a gift card that we had to use up, so we figure we're in the Summerlin area and we may as well grab lunch.  There was easily no wait on a weekend afternoon, although we were told all the outside tables were taken.

They had about 9 offerings of lunch bowls that are served daily until 4 pm that include your entree being served on a bed of rice, and a cup of either Egg Drop or Hot & Sour soup.

They bring to your table a bunch of dipping sauces, about six of them that include soy sauce, hot chili sauce, vinegar, hot yellow mustard, hot chili oil, and one other thing.

My choice: 
* Egg Drop Soup ""A classic starter"" - It was piping hot when it arrived and with a bit of heat added to it, it wasn't too bad.  I was starving and drank it all up.  It was a bit darker than what I expected it to be though.

* Buddha's Feast ""Veggies with five-spice tofu served steamed or stir-fried"" - I liked the fact that you can have brown or white rice, which is a nice perk you don't typically find at Chinese restaurants, but then again, this isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  It's a generous portion for one, and I like their choice of veggies.  It had broccoli, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, and tofu all in my dish.  So, it's definitely a hearty dose of the good green veggies.  I definitely needed to add some heat to my dish and eventually added enough chili oil that my rice was swimming in it.

* Hot & Soup ""Either by the cup or bowl, this will warm your soul"" - I guess it was okay, and he did drink it up.  I don't ever order this, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.

* Sesame Chicken ""Back by popular demand...love the ginger, chili paste and garlic"" - He asked the waiter if they could make it extra spicy, which he said of course too.  Except that when the order arrived, the Husband said it tasted like they didn't put any hot spices in there.  He wasn't particularly fond of the sauce of the dish, but beyond the chicken was onions, broccoli, and bell peppers with black sesame seeds tossed in there.

They were offering 'mini' desserts that arrived in shot classes, which was a sampling for about $2/each.  We went for two kinds:

* S'mores - The Husband thought this was too sweet for him, and it really was crushed graham crackers, a very sweet marshmallow creme, and chocolate sauce.

* Strawberry Cheesecake - The Husband enjoyed this more, and all it really consisted of was crushed graham crackers, strawberry preserves, and white cream.  

(They reminded me of something you could easily do at home, but I guess it satisfies your sweet tooth with having to purchase one of their bigger desserts.)

Overall, the food was decent, and the portions were pretty generous for the price.  It'd be different to go for dinner and do family style though.  We noticed mostly everyone had to go boxes with them, although I found it weird how the staff would hold the to go box against their stomach and shovel the food into it.  (Sure, it works, but it looks not so nice.)

Side note: They offer a chef's table that allows you to eat inside the kitchen as you can watch them cook.  Pretty cool!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,3,3,pukA2o8k07vzX9rNuNCmVg

Sure I like the Lettuce Wraps and the Spare Ribs but I have always felt it was overpriced, overcrowded and pretentious.  I tend to avoid places where you have to wait in line for the privilege of dropping a C-note on dinner and drinks for 2 and the food isn't even real chinese.

And then, as if drawn by oriental mystery, I found myself with my lovely wife who is a PF Changs fan hearing myself say  hmm, Lettuce Wraps sound good, surprised it came out of my mouth.  

So off to Rampart we go.  Past the wild rearing horses greeting us and reminding me that this might not be my best choice.  Until.....................

Dinner for 2 for $40.00.  I know I know, many other chains are offering similar or even better priced bargin dinners.  And the old saying you get what you pay for usually holds true.  I thought, ok. It is a trick, small portions, limited menu choices but I will give it a try, for my wife. Well this may be the exception.   The popular items are on the 2 for $40 menu.  Lettuce Wraps, Orange Chicken etc.  Not everything but enough choices to make it worth it.  

You start with soup, we upgrade to the Wonton for some yummy starts.  Then you get 1 appetizer (Lettuce Wraps are a staple.) 2 entrees and either 3 mini deserts or one large piece of cake for a slight upgrade price.

The bowl of soup is huge and we have always ended up taking some home.  The portions appear the same size as the regular dining and of course the same great taste.  The Mongolian Beef is one of our favorites and the Crispy Honey Shrimp and Chicken are awesome.

Unless you are super hungry, there will be enough leftovers for 1-2 lunches.  Make yourself the envy of your lunch crowd at work by enjoying a chinese feast the next day.

I have now become a fan of PF Changs and give them a resounding Xie xie or M goi.  Not to mention the service was fantastic.  We had an amazing server who has been there 7 years.  I hope the restaurant appreciates what they have in this girl.

The only think keeping this from a 5 star rating is that I am from the East Coast where corner store chinese food is better than anything you can find in Vegas and half the price.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,0,4,ADVDy1H1H5t2LtcL8uhDgQ

5659394,2011-03-18,0,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"So yesterday, 3/16/11, my best friend's roommate, Lawrence T. asked me out; unsure of where we should go for the meal part, I suggested ""the Chinese restaurant by your house."" I meant the Pearl Wok To Go http://www.yelp.com/biz/pearl-wok-to-go-las-vegas#hrid:jcxX6SDXMY-AXrGCElXEYQ (which I had back on Christmas Eve.) While driving around I spotted it and he said, ""really? I wanted to take you to a real restaurant, not fast food. Let's just go to P.F. Chang's."" 

Anyway, we head on over and walk right in. It was stuffy and loud inside so we jumped at the opportunity to sit out on the patio. It was nice outside and the weather was gorgeous. There was a little boy that spent the entire time dancing and jumping around an empty table and waiving at cars. That was pretty entertaining. 

We ordered - he had orange peel chicken and an iced tea, I had Mongolian beef... but with lamb instead, with extra chili pods, and water. The orange peel chicken was just okay, and my dish came with a canapy of green onions and not too much meat, although it was delicious. The ""mild sauce"" that our waitress, Ashley, made was, according to Lawrence, ""tasteless."" Ashley was a little... eh. My water glass was empty most of the meal, and that drives me crazy. 

For $35 + $10 tip, the food is just not worth the price. PF Chang's has definitely gone down hill. Although I had a great time with Lawrence, we could have had just as good a time at a cheaper restaurant.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,0,3,7k8KQTT7TYDZ7OBrYjAlWw

5691686,2014-08-17,1,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"Eh. What a complete letdown. And honestly, waste of money.

First things first, the positives. The service was great. Our server was super nice and patient with us. The owner (I'm assuming) went around the restaurant, making sure everyone was happy and was served. The space itself was nice and spacious.

Aaand on to the not so good. Mainly the food. I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but you know, at least decent food. This was not decent. The family and I got: calamari, Singaporean street noodles, Buddha's Feast, and the Chino-Latino Pineapple pork. The calamari was alright, bland and wasn't crispy. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the calamari at all. It almost overpowered it. The Singaporean noodles had potential, but it was wayy too salty. I ordered the Buddha's Feast, expecting it to be like a Buddha's delight sort of thing: veggies with brown sauce. What I got: steamed vegetables with some pieces of tofu. NO SAUCE. Like, wtf? I wouldn't have gotten that if I knew I was only getting steamed vegetables. I just doused it with some soy sauce because I needed some kind of flavor. The Chino-Latino pineapple pork wasn't bad at all actually. It the pork was a bit crisp, and the pineapple salsa ish topping was good. Also, my sister ordered this coconut refresher (can't remember the exact name) and it was just like coconut milk out of the can with a shitton of sugar. Not good.

With the quality of the food being not good, the price they charge is not worth it. At all. You're pretty much paying for the ~ambiance~. All four of us were disappointed by the end of the meal, and it was a consensus that we could get much better Chinese food at any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. My brother even said that Panda Express food is better. And I agreed. It was that bad.

So overall, not good, not worth it, just go to Chinatown.",4qXKIOzrynmX-hSOox0PdA,4,1,2,EV495BRhaaSrfDhaOhJ1NQ

XXX is how.  Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.  In fact, it was this location on RAMPART that I first held and caressed these ribs, and it's very memorable.

Order ""off the menu"":
-- The ""real"" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good.
-- The ""Stir-fried Eggplant"" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!

I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.

No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.

5928871,2013-10-30,2,T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw,"All P.F. Changs are pretty much the same: good food, but slow and/or retarded service.

First, the food. I honestly didn't like the food when I tried it years ago for the first time. Then I discovered that at this restaurant, you really have to order different dishes on every visit to break down what you like and don't like. My favorites are the Crispy Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. Shockingly, I don't eat green beans, but I do like the Crispy Green Beans appetizer. Everything is better when fried! Also, brown rice is an option without an extra charge, yay!

As I mentioned, service is slow. If you plan to dine in, be prepared to stay for like an hour and a half. If you need to get in and out quick, you MIGHT have better luck with take out/curbside pickup. Remember, I said MIGHT. This location can get pretty crowded for dinner on a weekday. We came here during the middle of the week. The parking lot was packed and although there were many people waiting to get a table, we were seated within a few minutes.

What really annoyed me was my last visit. I called in my order for curbside pickup. 30 minutes later, I parked in one of the curbside parking stalls. I waited about 5 minutes before an employee ran to my car. She greeted me, repeated my order back to me, I confirmed it, and gave her my debit card. A few minutes later, I got my food and started to drive back home. As I was at a red light, I peeked in the brown paper bag and noticed that they forgot to give me my 2 boxes of white rice. Grrr! Pulled a U-Turn and drove back. Luckily, I wasn't too far away at the time. When I got there, I didn't see any employees in the curbside area, so I called the restaurant. Hey, they are the ones that forgot my rice, so I wasn't going to get out of my car! The first person I talked to transferred me to the hostess. The hostess then transferred me to take out. Then take out transferred me to curbside. WTF? I told the last guy on the phone that I was missing my 2 boxes of white rice, I drove back and was parked in a curbside stall and asked if someone could run it to my car. He said ""Let me see what my manager can do for you"" and put me on hold. A few minutes later, dial tone. Really?? Right when that happened, the curbside employee who helped me earlier came to my window and said ""Was something wrong, ma'am?"" I told her I was missing my rice, she apologized, and  finally gave it to me. 

Lesson learned. Always check your bag before you leave. But still. This isn't McDonalds for crying out loud! Its their job to make sure all the orders are correct! I did call back later that night to speak with a manager about how unorganized they were and how much of my time they wasted because they couldn't do something simple as double checking the orders. She apologized and did send me a $10 gift card in the mail, which was nice of her. I do like the food here so I will be back.
