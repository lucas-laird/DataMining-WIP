7470,2015-07-15,0,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,Always a great steak but tonight I'm having the burger and onion bloom. With a cold beer of course.  I got the app 365 on my phone so Tuesdays free onion bloom....or whatever they call it.  Very attentive staff so far.  Really tasty onion.

8619,2015-09-02,0,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,"NOT the best experience.  Food was not bad and came out quick but felt very tooken advantage on their new steak and unlimited shrimp deal.  The server Mike F gave me options on everything else we ordered that had an option, down to the lemonade but when I told him and I pointed to the steak and shrimp unlimited deal, he did not ask did I want a filet or sirloin, which I guess the sirloin was the deal, which is what I wanted for $15.99 but he in fact took it upon himself to order me the filet and then bring a bill where it showed they were $28.99 a piece.  Bad thing is that even on this add online, it is very misleading and that is probably why their servers try to get over on their guests as well as the establishment.  Awful advertisement, use better ways to get people in the door and be direct on your promos. I wish I would have asked to speak to a manager but I was trying not to make a seen and in all I  was upset at the server and took it out off his tip.  He definitely should have opted me which steak, I work with servers that do this sort of thing, so I'm very aware. I'm in the industry and this should not have happened.",7o4auNykkJi_2DjnkXWluw,0,0,1,2S9Z-ogc1P_eLaxHr6v63w

84723,2014-06-16,0,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,"Went on Father's day. I will preface this review with that yes I know that Father's Day is probably one of their busiest days of the year. I will also say that I don't blame our server for the slow service we received, I think it was management's lack of having the store being properly staffed for the day. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides and salad were good. So on those merits I will give three stars. But the speed of things left a lot to be desired. 

We were seated immediately, but didn't get greeted or have our drink orders taken for 15 minutes. The waiter kept trying to make it to our table to get our order but kept getting short-stopped by impatient people at other tables. He obviously was getting overwhelmed. After our drinks finally arrived 15 minutes later he took our order. Then finally after an hour after being seated we got our entrees. 

I should have taken the hint when the waiter did that thing where they just throw the check on your table without asking if you want desert, but we ordered desert anyway, which turned into a half hour ordeal after first placing the order. Then my daughter received the  wrong item and we had wait another 15 minutes for them to fix it. So almost two hours after being seated we finally left.

Luckily I had really good company, and overall had a great tasting meal. It is just that it was at the speed of some french restaurant where you get the table for the entire night.",B6CP8YfIzuKnvSZ_4U1zOw,0,0,3,2bPr602N_3ZDM28BVYiydQ

Being a worldwide traveling ""foodie"", it is rare for an owner of a ""chain"" restaurant to treat his customers like they were his personal guests. This owner appears to, as does his staff. My steak and lobster were created just to my specifications and my waiter was attentive without being a nuisance.  Also, it is a known local place on the strip but not ""on the strip"" that has a genuine reputation for local Vegas celebrity sightings. I saw a few, who also appeared to be enjoying themselves.

120670,2014-07-08,0,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,"Was looking for a steakhouse which wouldn't break the bank like the majority of high end steakhouses in the casinos. Ventured down the strip and stumbled upon outback.

We went quite early (approx 5pm) and as such the restaurant was very quiet. Our waitress was fantastic, consistently checking to see if everything was ok and refilling our drinks. 

Went for the signature sirloin (12oz) which included 2 sides (creamy mash potato and a chicken tortilla soup) all for just $21! The steak was ordered medium rare and was very tasty...if there were to be any criticism at all it would be that the steak perhaps may have been on the rare side a bit too much, but with it being such a thick cut I have little complaints. The soup was brilliant, as was the mash.

410502,2013-07-16,0,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,"Excellent food, and very willing to cater to special requirements.  Gluten free? Not a problem. Want just carrots instead of the mixed veggies? Ok!  Salad with extra cucumbers and no tomatos, np.  Their croutons are made there, and a bit spicy.

Mmm, delicious.  I love Outback.

Today I had a crispy chicken sandwich, a baked potato, and a house salad.  I'm a supertaster (basically 1/3 of the population can taste Prop, a bitter flavor in many vegetables) and their salad is rarely overly bitter, which really makes me feel ""normal"" when I can enjoy a salad.

The baked potato, as always, was properly cooked, which is rare in restaurants to be able to get a baked potato that is actually cooked all the way through (Not sure how people can enjoy jason's deli or memphis bbq potatoes where they're actually still hard).  Butter, bacon, and cheese.  No extra upcharge for the bacon and cheese.

The crispy chicken sandwich was a nice surprise.  Its on their new brioche bun which was amazing, it had folds, a good flavor, soft on the top, and was properly crisped on the grill.  You know the bun is right when after you pick it up to take a bit and put it down, your hand has ""impressed"" on the bun changing its shape.

The aroma told it all though, it was a real buffalo sauce!  Not Frank's red hot sauce, which is a fine hot sauce, but isn't buffalo sauce at all. This was a mixture of butter and hot sauce, and was delicious.  So delicious. :)

Here is a tip, instead of ordering the cheese fries you can't finish, just get french frys and add cheese and bacon for a buck more.  They'll even give you the same ranch sauce!",02sxoqCJ_1lbk_t2GCLxQQ,0,0,5,PlasHo-QkOEfvZIpIP1OXg

427359,2016-11-26,0,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,"This review was for last nights meal. Our server was Anthony and he was very attentive and helpful. The reason for the three star review was the quality and portion size of the food. My husband ordered the ribs and chicken plate. This is where the food portions became comical, he ordered a wedge salad, it was large and seemed  proportional. Then the main course came out. The chicken breast was the size of a child's fist and the ribs consisted a 5 very small ribs. This cost of this meal was $16.49 plus a $1.00 upgrade charge for the salad. The server who brought our food even made a comment to how small the food looked on the plate. The cost of this meal for three people was over $100.00. One was a kid. We felt sad as we left and not happy. 
The prices were not in line with the size and quality of the food.

I'll start instead by commenting on one of the managers who visitted the lobby to offer bite-sized samples of the Victoria's filet to patiently waiting guests. I enjoyed both the class of his guesture and the tasty bite. On this visit,  there were remodeling renovations underway, but the 35minute wait seemed less onerous after the filet sample!
   When we were seated, we ordered  our 'usuals' for drinks and a bloomin' onion app. (We order more apps now that Outback offers the smaller ""petals"" portion.) I always enjoy the spicy sauce that onion's served with.--and tonight was no exception.
  Our 8 year old orders an adult 1/2 rack of ribs now that she's in a growth spurt; and my wife always enjoys the Alice Springs chicken. (Note, I lived in Australia,  visitted the Alice, and there's no such thing on the menu there! )  This time around,  I got the new chicken tacos,  which had great portions of chicken and toppings to add on. My only issue was how tough tortillas get under a warmer while waiting for the rest of the meals. 
  Despite the construction and Saturday night bustle, everything was very satisfying, including the wait staff catching kitchen mixups Before they arrived at our table! I say great job everyone and thanks for a good dining experience.",hhYOs0L2G6AUq_HwXQEDPg,0,0,4,oaVXK2Weme1dnbs_UuRUtw

The last trip we had there was so disappointing, service was only fair, our dirty dishes from salad just sat and sat, it used to be if ANY server saw dirty dishes, they would grab them on their way past, even the manager stood there and asked us how everything was, and left without picking up one dish, very disappointing.

One of the best parts of coming here is, the servers, their attentiveness, clean restaurant, and by far the best steaks for the price.

So, with no apologies or admittance from the manager we choose to leave. I'm disgusted at that whole ordeal. So for anyone reading this.... know your cuts of meat or they will try and pass off a cheaper meat but, charge you for the 30 dollar filet. She didn't even say it was a fillet either. The only reason is that they were serving sirlion trying to pass it off as fillets! So if someone just wants a steak and really doesn't know cuts of meat...then they got you!

Met my wife's family at this Outback location.
Topic of conversation this night 9/6, Hurricane Irma.
Her aunt and uncle were flying back to TPA 9/7.
I'm writing this review on 9/12.
All is well with her family as of this writing.
Ok, so it was a Wednesday night at the Outback.
Ordered the 6oz sirloin w/sweet potato for $10.99,
also came with a 8oz (wow) beer.
Then I saw an ad for a lobster tail@$9.99
Damn it! Had to have it!
The steak tasted great and sweet potato never disappoints.
Lobster - NO BUENO! 
Presentation was nice but then I took the meat off the shell and . . . Well, look at the pic I took.
Size of a crawfish tail, well maybe an inch bigger.
I was able to cut it in 3 pieces.
Ate TEN DOLLARS in less than 5 minutes.
Come to think of it, I loss the same amount in 5 minutes gambling too.
If ever I return, it'll just be to meet others that wanted to eat here.

Couldn't tell what it was, kangaroo, koala or koyote, all I know is that it was bloody and I was starving, I couldn't pass it by, I picked it up and......ok, I'm kidding, I went into the outback steakhouse and ordered a steak, I took my knife and cut it into pieces, as I took my first bite my taste buds screamed with joy and the juices of the steak  ran through my veins like heroin on a drug addict two minutes after being released from rehab.

She tries to be sweet in your face by calling you ""Honey, Sweetie, etc"" but she is really in the wrong industry. She snaps and has an attitude without listening first. The bar was full the night we came in but seriously not our problem and when she makes mistakes and has to call for a manager she makes comments and tells her bar back to call the manager because ""she's not going to call the manager again"" (her words). I mean she is the one making a mistake and has the nerve to have an attitude about fixing it. We eat out often and we like to tip well- I did give her our regular tipping because I do understand that this is a livelihood and it was the holidays but her arrogance still bothers me. I don't want to go in full detail because it does get my blood boiling and don't want to re-live this night but I do have to mention one more thing- when you go for happy hour, their menu is not updated so when you ask for a drink and she has to fix it, she has attitude and instead of apologizing for not having accurate pricing or menus she tells me to ""remember for next time"". So if I come in 2 months from now I need to memorize their specials instead of going off their happy hour menu. Its the stupidest thing a bartender has ever told me. She should know her stuff but if not (we're all human) just fix it without making it seem like we're the dumb ones asking for the correct price. Thanks Outback for hiring an employee that makes us feel stupid for asking for the happy hour prices during happy hour. This was only a couple things that happened throughout the dinner.

Outback is far and above our favorite restaurant, with us visiting about once a month.  Recently, this restaurant relocated.  I agree with the new location in its ease of access and improved parking. It is understandable that the new location has produced a major bump in business however, there has been a large and negative impact on regular customers.    Our wait times have gone from 20-30 minutes to over 90 minutes, call ahead seating has no value in that there is still no reduction in wait times (average 90 minutes), the new staff display a shocking lack of familiarity with the menu,  and the front end staff (understandably overwhelmed) have become curt and indifferent.  As a result, our dining experience has deteriorated dramatically, and has had an impact on our decision as to whether or not to visit Outback for dinner.

Anyhow, I was craving a nice juicy steak but I didn't want to shell out $$$$$ on a steak on the strip somewhere. I wanted a steak that wasn't going to break the bank and Outback came to mind... And it had been years since I've been to one but my vague old memories were of steaks that were decent for a decent price. So here I went! :)

We got seated after waiting for about 15 minutes which was cool since they had actually quoted us a 20 minute wait. We got a cozy 2 person booth by the entrance to the kitchen so occasionally all we could hear was ""corner"" being yelled out by the staff as they were walking around the corner... But it wasn't too bad.  Ambiance decent...4/5

The BF was starving and so we got a sampler. It came with Mac n cheese balls, Aussie fries and bloomin onion petals. The portion size was decent for the price. The mac n cheese was very very cheesy which in my book always equal DELICIOUS! :D~ The Aussie fries had a good account of cheese and bacon bits on it... The bf scarfed it down... And the bloomin onion petals were so crunchy and battered perfectly. All of them could have been really greasy but they weren't. We pretty much cleared the plate. We had to wait a bit for our food but the server came and let us know that the food would be out shortly. Our server was actually really great. She touched our table a few times to refill our drinks and to see how we were doing.  When our food finally came out... My ribeye was way overcooked. I requested medium and the steak came out well-done. Eeeewwwww! I pointed it out and they whisked it away and left me my steamed broccoli and baked sweet potato to eat while they recooked my steak. I was just expecting my steak back but no they brought me a whole new plate! Which in my book was a very nice touch. The manager came by and talked to us twice just to make sure that we were happy. And honestly, I was not all that annoyed that my steak was overcooked since my bf's steak was perfect and he was the one that was starving. Lol They salvaged a below par experience and totally made it a great night by exceeding my expectations. And the steak was cooked to perfection. It was medium leaning towards the med rare side which is how I like it. Ribeye was tender with a good amount of fat running through it and the seasoning on it was perfect. The sweet potato was baked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed to oh dare I say it again... Yup it was steamed to perfection. Still a bright green with a small bite so that it wasn't total mush.  Flavor 5/5

Yes my experience could have been totally ruined but they cared enough to make sure that my ribeye was cooked to my standards.

Will I return... Yup! I will. :) Does it compare to the dry aged ribeye at CarneVino? No it didn't but then again it also didn't break the bank. For the price, Outback is totally worth it. When I'm craving steak... I'll be back! :)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,1,2,5,ztwvnSw9pfZKG_ApHltHaA

It arrived barely warm and our server quickly walked away. We wanted a side of ranch to accompany our appetizer, there were no servers in sight. Keep in mind we were here at 4pm, there were maybe 2 other tables in the whole bar area. I had to ask the bartender to get someone who could give us some ranch before our food got cold. As far as the flatbread, unappetizing.

2052197,2013-06-26,1,8Yz1eFsaUy-ny3B6YZDOrg,"Pretty good steakhouse. I ordered a sirloin, well-done. Had baked potato side, but nothing else offered with it. My plate appeared a little empty and my steak looked like a kid's size steak; also, it could have been a little more cooked as I ordered it well-done. My boyfriend had a larger cut of meat and he regretted ordering it medium rare because it tasted under-cooked to him. He had a side of mashed potatoes and a salad which he liked. Bread to start our meal was good, though we could have used a bit more butter for it (they seem to be stingy about sauces and butter here). 

We also ordered two appetizers. Crab-stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good, but a very small extra container of 'wild mushroom' sauce cost $3 - that seemed a little silly to us both. We're guests at their restaurant, so why not try to make us happy? The other appetizer was the onion sticks. Basically, glorified onion rings, and the onions were rather mushy.... the batter makes that appetizer - would never order it again, though.  Drinks were not brought out right away, so we had to sit there thirsty (it's 100 degrees outside today here in Vegas). Timely refills on drinks.

Desserts and special drinks looked nice, but we passed on them. The salt and pepper grinders are nice. Steakhouse 'feel' with much dark-wood paneling throughout the restaurant. Service fair to good. OK price, probably a good deal less expensive than expected, about $10 to $15 less. My boyfriend and I would return here sometime. Recommended.",IduEiOzDSIMlAGnOMPfSvw,2,2,3,jFVxVss9ulAZoXNMvIC2xA

As if that wasn't enough, it took another 20 for our main dishes to get to the table.  I guess the server saw us getting annoyed and gave us a weird excuse that their computer went down.  That is such a bunch of bull because the people that got seated AFTER us got their orders no problem.  I would rather her to have told the truth rather than making a BS excuse that didn't make any lick of sense.

He says when he's not in the mood for a full steak at Outback he gets the filet foccacia and I can see why.

We also got the seared Ahi tuna appetizer.  That was also fantastic, especially with the wasabi sauce Outback makes.

The next day before my flight out I was craving the same sandwich so I swung by Outback just a couple hours before my flight.  I went in the bar area this time and ordered the same thing.

They brought my sandwich and salad out in record time!  And I didn't even ask them to hurry it, they just went ahead and did so.  And as previously, the waitress was super friendly.

My wife, daughter and I went the other day.  We usually eat here every once and while.  It is close to the house and my wife likes the coconut shrimp.  I usually just order the sirloin steak special they have.  The reason I gave this particular Outback 4 stars is because they are very consistent.  Like I mentioned this place isn't special and it's not Morton's but the cooks get it right most of the time.  I can't remember leaving here and saying man they never cook my steak how I want it.  So, kudos to the cooks for knowing how to cook a piece of meat all while be employed at a steakhouse where that's what you cook 90% of the time.  I also want to add that most of time the wait staff is generally friendly.  Let me also add that this particular Outback gets pretty busy because it's in a tourist area by the outlet mall.  The one service I really enjoy that any restaurant offers is the ability to put your name on the list as you are getting ready to drive over the place.  This is something they let you do and I highly recommend it unless you really like sitting on those awesome padded benches!  Cheers!",3eUPfBdVr1BexmC0bGgCvQ,1,0,4,F-rogGdp184sfa0Yg4Igxw

Outback is our 'go-to' when we want to eat well in our PJs.  Its unpretentiousness, inexpensiveness, and tastiness are what keep us coming back for more salads and filet mignon.  

Just a little note, the Queensland Salad comes with chicken salad on top of the salad.  You are able to substitute this with their wonderfully seasoned grilled chicken breast.  Not only are the salads fresh and delicious alone but the dressings...oh the dressings... All of their salad dressings are made fresh everyday!  My favorites being the 1000 Island and Ranch (for dipping the Aussie Fries into).

The steaks are comparable to some of the Strip's top steakhouse restaurants, for a fraction of the price.  PERIOD.

Never had any room left over for dessert, so that's a strike for me.

You can always count on great comfort food here, and the service is equally good...quick and responsive.  

The quality is not comparable to say, Hanks or Morton's, but they have a full service bar and plenty of offerings that will make the most picky eater happy with their choice.

Even the filet.       So we hardly ever go anymore.   Decided to just have drinks and 2 appetizers.   No more expensive tough steak for us.   Well the blooming onion was greasy and not even cut thru.     We had to try and hack thru with knives to rip off the blooms.   That resulted in the batter in our hands and the onion still attached.    The quesadillas were awful .   Rubbery and tough.    Our bill was over 30 dollars.   We keep saying we aren't going back but we mean it this time !!!   Also prices have gone up at an astonishing amount.     Certainly not worth it.     Too bad.

Used to be that if you ordered a steak it came with choice of soup or salad and a side like baked potato, veggies or something else.

The service has always been okay. Have seen they've remodeled the place inside and out, though mostly on the outside.  
This time out, it took forever to try and get seated and even though they had 4 people working the front entrance to sit people down, they were non-communicative and non-attentive. You could tell they were young and not well versed in hospitality. Though we were a larger group of 7, and they were quite busy during dinner time, the wait was over 45 mins. While they told us 30-45 mins., I had to go to them for updates every 10 mins. as my elderly parents and young nieces were very hungry. And to top it all off, it was my brother-in-law's birthday and he chose Outback by name to celebrate his birthday. The front staff acted as if they could care less if we patronized--continued to patronize their establishment or not. As we saw many and all other customers get seated as the waiting area with the covered benches were empty, we and especially my bro-in-law grew sick of waiting though a table was finally almost available, we just left. It was his call, but I felt so bad for him since it was supposed to be his birthday dinner. The front staff made no effort to offer us to stay or even apologized for the long wait.

Dude, you manage an outback, your job really is not that difficult. Our waitress was alright, I suppose... Forgetful but alright. She tried her best. A for effort.

So they started walking outside, for a smoke, the dumbass at the podium said ""if you go out, you can't come back in, company policy"" when they told me that, I was livid. I told her, I'm gonna have a smoke, and get my wallet unless you don't want me paying for this dinner. Honestly, it's pretty bad if you start craving a cig in between apps and entree. Anyways, steaks came out... Warm. Ordered medium rare, my steak nearly gave me lock jaw from chewing it so much. We should've saved this horrible experience by eating at the damn chili's next door. I swear, a blind, tasteless person could've cooked a better steak than the chefs in charge of this joint. Sorry to be so harsh, but this is seriously the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I want this meal comped, and matter of fact, I'd like to be reimbursed for my time wasted in this restaurant.

We've been to this specific location a handful of times because we're local and live nearby. Normally on a Sat, just like all other restaurants, the wait is about 40-50mins long and that's what is expected but this review was based on a Sunday night. We arrived Sunday night around 7:40pm and when we walked in, there was about 4 people ahead of us and was told the wait was about 15 mins. We told the host this was a party of four adults and two kids so we needed two high chairs. Another party came in after us and was maybe a party of 5 and they were seated ahead of us! They were seated on the North end of the restaurant which had plenty of tables that would have fit 4 adults and 2 high chairs! Not only it took 45 mins to seat only 4 adults and two kids with only 4 people ahead of us on a slow Sunday night and seated a party as big as us ahead of us, but after 30 mins checking in they asked us about our high chair situations. They asked us like they didn't know! 5 more mins we would have walked out and they deserve 1 Star. 

Finally being seated they seated us in a more busy area which was on the South side of the restaurant and we couldn't get the 2 high chairs we requested 45 mins ago on a slow Sunday night! Not only that, there was a free table that could have fit all of us but instead we were put in booth that forced us to only have one booster. This was a very disappointing experience before we even had a chance to order water.

I was already annoyed of the seating situation so considering that the waiter did a good job.

After taking our name and providing us with a buzzer, the hostess directed us to some nearby benches to wait. There were small tables with menus for us to peruse, there was upbeat country music playing, and a young female server was going around the waiting area with a tray full of fried shrimp for us to sample. The wait was very pleasant for a wait and we only ended up waiting 15 minutes or so. Once we were seated, our server came by almost immediately with fresh bread. She took our drink and appetizer order and had both out almost instantaneously. Everything was piping hot, flavorful, and delicious. Our server was so sweet and checked in at least every fifteen minutes. The manager, Michael, checked in too and made sure we were happy. Overall, we were very impressed with our meal and definitely found a new favorite restaurant. The only downside is it is a bit pricey.",sgTRJRhaGL__BsJcWaE3qQ,0,0,4,JWD02woWW5DlMKPJpN2LbQ

I point out that my name is not April and he then apologizes and gives me a bag that had been sitting there for 10 minutes.... I'm sorry but if I did that I would have said how sorry I was and offered something to make up for it- like a coupon or something but the kid just turned around and left.

For starters, we seemed to have four servers who did not communicate with each other. It was bizarre! We had 4 different people ask for our drink order, 3 of them came back to ask about appetizers etc. I appreciate that they were asking us, but it got to be a little redundant and annoying as we were trying to talk and got interrupted every 2 minutes with the same questions. Next, when we very first sat down, I told the first server that it was my husband's birthday while he was in the restroom, hoping that someone would at least tell him happy birthday! Not a word the entire meal. Third, my meal came out extremely burned. Not overcooked, burned to the point that it tasted burned and inedible. I sent it back and it took forever to replace. My husband was 90% done with his meal by the time I got mine! A female manager did come to bring the new plate and said she'd be back in a few minutes to make sure it was ok this time. She never returned. Such a letdown for a birthday meal!",trYWqx01V0iwRV6Jn4mhxg,0,0,2,fR8wk9ZHWxyMPDrWjQMINQ

The new ordering system of me having to order an appetizer or desert through a touch screen! Give me a break you are a full service restaurant charging more than a lot of others. This isn't McDonalds but now is to me. 

Outback you really need to rethink this! I also was told by my waiter tonight that a lot of people had quit over it, but he is happy as he is getting a bunch of hours.

The Blue Cheese Wedge Salad is delicious. The lettuce is crisp, the dressing is flavorful and not heavy, and all the toppings enhance the flavor. 

Filet mignon is juicy and perfect. Plain and simple.

Baked potato is classic, soft, and hearty.

Key Lime Pie Martini rimmed with the Graham Cracker Crust is sweet buy not overly. I don't like my drinks too sweet and this one was balanced just right. Make sure they put the graham cracker crust because without it it's still good, but not as great. I went 2 times and they ran out of the graham cracker crust.

This location is near many businesses so they are great at accommodating a lunch hour. Seating was prompt and the waitress was quick to get orders taken. The food is pretty quick and check out is efficient with no problem in getting split checks. 

I'm currently counting calories so I studied the menu well the day before eating here. Outback posts their nutrition facts on their website for those that are interested. I found out that Victoria's 6 ounce filet with mixed vegetables and asparagus would fell within the calorie range I had allotted for lunch. The only downside is that the filet isn't an item on the lunch menu so my meal was more expensive than what I would normally spend for a quick weekday lunch. I didn't see anything on the lunch menu that I recognized as a low calorie option from the website. 

The Victoria's filet was pretty tasty and it was prepared as requested. The seasoning was pretty good, but probably high in sodium. The veggie sides were very good for vegetables. The size of the meal was satisfying without being a heavy meal. My coworker ordered Ahi Tuna as an appetizer and insisted that I try it.

Finally after 10 minutes of waiting someone comes up and seats us down, that person who sat us down was also our server - who btw, never even greeted us.
After 10 minutes he comes back and asks us what we'd like to drink, my sister wanted a midori sour, he looks at her with attitude and asks, what kind? First of all, my sister doesn't really drink and doesn't know anything so she was confused and didn't understand why he asked ""what kind"" of midori sour she wanted. So he sighs really loud and says hold on let me go see what that is. At this point, we definitely didn't like the way he was treating us or his attitude for that matter. After another ten minutes he comes back and was like ""I don't know what you mean by midori sour but this is what the bartender gave me"" and he puts it down on our table and just leaves without even asking if we were ready to order or not. She tried the drink and definitely did not know what she drank, I tried it myself and spat it out instantly, it was definitely not midori sour. What I don't understand is, every single bar I've ever been to, knows exactly what a midori sour is and what really confused me, is the fact that he came to our table and still gave us a drink when he said he didn't know what a midori sour was! When he came back, we told him to take it back because this isn't what we wanted and FINALLY, he asked for our order.
Forty minutes later, our food finally comes out. A half hour for just appetizers??? Are you kidding me? And on top of that our waiter just dumped our dishes down on the table and left, didn't even ask if we needed anything. 
At this point, we were pissed off and flagged down a different waiter and asked for to-go boxes because of how badly our service was, he apologized.

The hostess was very friendly and and pointed out there was self serve water while we waited. We had reservation and was seated a bit before our actual time which was nice. Our waitress was a bit over the top. She was trying way to hard to be friendly and prompted that she pretty much was like a fly that wouldn't leave. She took our drink order and then as soon as she placed our drinks asked what we wanted for our meals. We kindly said we needed a few more minutes to decide. I kid you not, she walked about 10 feet from us turned around and asked we where ready. This is how the whole night went.. She would not stop asking us if things where alright, if we needed anything and so on.. I mean yeah its nice not to have to want but there is a limit.. But in turn we never had to ask for any refills on our drinks. 

    Now our meals, they came out promptly and hot. But the portions have reduced a lot. Almost to the point I would say half the size as I remember them being. I ordered the chicken breast and all you can eat shrimp. The breast was a filet and still looked like it come off a Cornish game hen. As I looked around at everyone's plates it was pretty much the same story. I know cost of food goes up, but come on do not raise the prices and cut the size too.. i felt like I was in a old Wendy's commercial ( where's the beef ). The all you can eat shrimp helped my shock over the prices but the shrimp was buffet quality at best, and a bit tough.

Every time I'm there, I get the Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail.  I am never disappointed with the meal.  As they are usually on a wait, I opt to sit at the bar for dinner.  Bartenders are always friendly and knowledgeable.  The mixed drinks are good, but consist mostly of ice.

As for cleanliness, I am relatively satisfied.  I've never seen anything unreasonable, but one sink in the men's room sprays water in every which direction, and has been like this for quite some time.

We ordered the cheese fries which were sooo delish, the blooming petal which was tasty and the mac n cheese balls that looked, smelled and seemed wonderful but had a hint if sweetness I didn't care for. I mentioned this to our server and as she was apologizing the manager came by and apologized then promptly took away the funky tasting balls and said he would take it off for us. He was very nice and courteous and we ordered a piece of carrot cake that was soo moist and scrumptious. The manager definitely saved our visit.

But then they started to go down-hill.   The food was cutting it anymore and the service wasn't as great as I remembered it to be.  So, I stopped going to outback for about three years.

BUT now, wow they changed their menu and added/removed a few items as well.  I was impressed!  They no longer have my favorite sinful sydney sundae, but they added milkshakes. Oh man was that AMAZING. I ordered the cappuccino milkshake, it is my new favorite dessert! It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't too powerful with the cappuccino.  It was just perfect. I am craving it as I am typing this review.

The entree was good, I ordered the half-order of baby back ribs.  It was tender and juicy.  I did not like the fries that much, but I was already full from the two complimentary breads that I ate and an appetizer. 

Appetizer, we ordered the steak nachos thing, it was interesting. The nachos or ""chips"" was really good, but I feel like they didn't add enough steak on it.

We made our way there on foot and went up a stairwell to the restaurant which seems like a rather obscure location

The place was definitely not clean and had a funky smell.

We were seated in a booth in the back.

I said what's the best steak you have and please instruct the chef to prepare it with a garlic infusion with a medium rare temperature.

The chef came out with the largest porterhouse steak I may have ever seen and he himself said it on the table along with a ribeye and a fillet mignon for my guests.

This quite possibly without any second thought could pass as or could be the best steak I ever had in my life. 

I was truly shocked that out of this crappy Las Vegas strip dirt hole of a restaurant could come such an amazing steak prepared by an awesome chef!

Just ask for the best steak in the house prepared with a garlic infusion... 

Give it a shot you can't lose and to top it all off the steak was so cheap I couldn't believe it.

However, we were able to get a table quickly and had a server named Heather.   From the time we sat down and throughout our meal Heather always had a smile on her face, continuously attentive to us and was always checking if we need anything else.  My fiancé decided to order something we don't normally pick, the philly cheesesteak and unfortunately he was unhappy with it, but Heather said no problem, let's get you something you like and substituted it.  Shortly after, the Manager Michael came by and apologized for the inconvenience and said our meal would be out shortly.   Honestly, it wasn't his fault, we should've ordered what we enjoy.  Quickly thereafter, our meal came.
 
The Manager Michael and Heather came back on separate occasions and multiple times to check on us to make sure everything was ok, which we were all happy.   At one point, our daughter asked if we personally knew them and I explained to her, No, they're just really friendly and amazing here.  
 
Working in a customer service setting, I know how extremely hard it is when it's busy and you are doing your best to make customers happy.  I saw Heather running around helping serve tables around us and she was always so friendly and smiling.   At the end of our meal, I told her thank you for being so friendly and her customer service was amazing.   She said ""I try my best to make you have a great dining experience so you can just sit and enjoy your food and not have to worry about anything else.""  Well definitely mission accomplished.

The recent remodel is very nice and the addition of comfortable patio furniture outside for those times when you have to wait for a table is appreciated. Not sure if you can bring a drink from the bar outside, but it's a pleasant enough area regardless. We like to go for the Wednesday 3-Course Menu special that seems to be a regular promotion now. There are also three different price points offering at least different menu items each, including soup or salad, a side, and a dessert. I always order the French Onion soup. It is always piping hot and a rather generous serving considering it's part of the meal. I believe it's $1 extra, but so worth it. Just the right amount of cheese on top, that you get a bite with every spoonful. Recently we also noticed the portions of sides seemed to have gotten larger. I'm not complaining. Finally, the carrot cake is the best, but we end taking it home to enjoy later after filling ourselves on the main course.

Unfortunately, their beef quality has declined over the years.  Their beef is too lean.  With steak, fat is flavor.  Without the fat, even a perfectly cooked med-rare steak will be dry and tough. 

Since we keep returning, I keep hoping that it's just a consistency problem.  Sadly, it's consistent low quality.

Other times, you might have to flag down the waiter or they might be too slow to come and greet us, but like I said, we came here so often and the good outweighs the bad.

I typically get the baked potato soup without bacon. It's one of my favorite dishes, and the broccoli here is amazing. If you're a vegetarian/vegan, do not get the broccoli!! We were informed that the butter used contains chicken brother. Just an FYI. 

The last time we came, which was yesterday, our server was Trent. Trent was very patient and friendly. He came back to give us bread several times, and didn't seem bothered at our modifications for food. He's very nice and wouldn't mind having him again. There was a moment where he was coughing and excused himself, and came back a few seconds later, which we all laughed about together. Great experience!",vZp-loGRkht7npWKOwo7Ug,0,0,4,wI7K-0ti-UnEr9XH6rNl9Q

Hubby is a chef & hates cooking when he comes home, so we've eaten at quite a number of restaurants. 

That said, this place has 1 of the best managers we've ever encountered.

Managers (the good ones, at least) are supposed to welcome patrons & stop by their table at least once: this was what the manager here did when we had dinner here a few months ago. And the food was as fantastic as the service.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,3,3,5,LXlqjBmR4p7NxqcYDG_jag

My coworker was raving about the blue cheese wedge for days and she convinced me I need to try it. Well, I didn't order the wedge, but I did try the blue cheese chopped salad instead. I don't know why I'm so averse to chopping up my own wedge, hah. I have to admit the salad was great. The blue cheese was tangier than most, which I love. Nothing better than blue cheese. 

My salad came with a half sandwich. I chose the prime rib dip, but I was a little disappointed that it was served on a focaccia bread instead of french bread. The meat was pretty good, but I just wasn't a fan of the bread and decided to eat around it. My coworker was just as thrilled about her wedge as before. A winner in her book again.

The service was fast and friendly and definitely a great place for a quick bite when you're limited on time. The meals were very reasonably priced as well. The lunch specials come with a soft drink and are incredibly filling for the price.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,2,3,WfoHss1yBx7ezVnopGSlrw

My fish was lacking in taste, and my friend's chicken was terrible.  I know they can do better and maybe we were just unlucky.  Regardless, I won't be hitting up this location again.",S-oatbN-h7SKiWwkTWw5QA,1,0,2,WvZD1Km80AYWJuGydFVvTw

Comes in a loaf not round. This place is awesome! Has the best wedge salad EVER, very tasty with the mix of ingredients they put in.... sweet a bit, Roma tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, blue cheese, red onion, etc....and good size portion. I was able to ask it be a side order instead of ala cart. All the steaks come with two sides. And I love how the menu shows the different cuts of steak and how it is cooked. But mostly our server made it very very pleasant! I'll have to go back and try their desert to next time!",TXbIl_9ogHdALGlqYl3NvA,0,0,5,4YwpQWgJhBImdGbM76dQBQ
