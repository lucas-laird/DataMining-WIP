230956,2016-09-24,8,KPPjKg1kV2nzLidTXljQZA,"ATTENTION CUSTOMERS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORN DOWN CLUB WITH 60YR OLD CRACK HEAD DANCERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! So if you are looking for ""old"" worn out crackhead dancers who spend every $1 they make into the video poker machine, this is the place to come to. There are dancers by the name of Flawless, Jasmine, Zamora and Stephanie who i heard one night all begging a customer to get them more cocaine. Amazing! I met the owner of the club Bob just once(the one time my friend took me to this club he introduced me to Bob). Bob seems like a nice guy but one of my friends that is a regular of that club(he mainly goes there 3days a week to gamble and not to buy dances) said Bob doesn't mind (and knows) that they are crack heads considering he knows they are worn out dancers that put every dollar they make into the machine since Bob caters to old worn out dancers(no wonder why there are no pretty young dancers who work here). If you are looking for more younger/prettier dancers, stick to Spearmint Rhino. So my friend who is a regular customer knows the names of the crackhead dancers so here goes the list... 1.Zamora(ugly black crackhead dancer that can never afford her buy in). 2. Flawless(fat light skinned dancer on crack).3. Jasmine(65yr old white/spanish dancer with wrinkles).4. Stephanie(68yr old white dancer crackhead with wrinkles). 5. Sintel or Cintel(60yr old crackhead dancer with blond hair and wrinkles with old lady eye makeup).6. Annabelle(Asian crackhead who is 45yrs old). The police need to raid this club. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! I'M ONLY GIVING ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAVE TO AND BECAUSE I LOVE THE BEER THEY HAVE THERE",E3-RZJr1XJ76vJ4jMZO1SQ,1,0,1,GD6BFRJSfGTKyrcrru0kSw

I was like like no way I'm a local I'm not paying to get in. So after that argument we walk in and it was so dark and smelt terrible. It was was like no other smell I had smelt before. Then it came to me cigarette smoke and the smell of a mortuary. Sad to say it but Play it Again Sams is the death row for pimped out strippers.,y7cK59fUYc0OTegqqXd97g,1,0,1,oph0IexOf8wLoij1sqqGEg
500731,2014-01-10,1,KPPjKg1kV2nzLidTXljQZA,"Love this place. Its definitely NOT your cheesy megaclub with 100+ girls that swarm you & hound you all night. It's the perfect combination of gentlemen's club meets little local bar. The staff is friendly & the atmosphere is relaxed.  There's a good variety of beautiful dancers: from straight-out-of-a-magazine model types to the curvier girl next door look. Another nice thing about the dancers is they aren't all bleached blonde, big fake boob valley girls: they have redheads, brunettes, blondes, white girls, black girls, Hispanic girls, Asian girls, etc. 

Sam's is off the strip, across from Chinatown. They have video gaming at the bar. Happy hour drink prices from 7a-7p. Free entry for locals. They don't serve food, but you can ask the waitress or door girl for a menu to have food delivered from one of the nearby restaurants. (Flamingo pizza seems to be a big hit lol) 

The stage is kind of cool because it has 2 poles. (Some of the girls are pretty good on the pole too). In addition to the couches for lap dances, they have VIP & fantasy room dances too. 

If you're looking for an off the strip local's-spot type gentlemen's club, definitely check it out.",LTA6P5uEbK7s0cTcNIPy-w,5,1,5,L6n6H8u1PBOlxzvRcaTdaA

First of all, the music was all over the place, and DJ sounded like a total novice, very unprofessional. Most of the girls are 'older' and overweight (but pretty nice though). The few younger, sexier ones are seriously stuck-up b****s. My friend got a dance from a fat girl named Zamora and her friend Anabel. They ended up being rude as hell. Now we're both dealing with bedbug problems at home. Never going back again. We heard this was a decent place, but gosh, it's a shady dive. Seems like all the girls who work here are either past their prime, or stripper-wannabe's, or can't find work in other clubs because they were banned for being total b****'s to the customers.

This place is a total shithole.....Reminds me of The wild wild west casino on Tropicana. ..
""Whoever is running this place should be arrested"" for being a complete ""pimp"" this is a 24 hour hoe house pretty much....
The bartenders ""kevin"" ""bruce"" and ""hunter""(hopefully I didn't slaughter spelling on any of there names) are very nice nd pleasant to talk too....

""You know a Strip club sucks when u enjoy the company of male Bartenders and Boyd gaming more then the dancers"".....smdh....!

The only reason I ever ended up in a world class dump like this is because A friend of mine told me to ""Go in Sams"" I can get a cheap drink and a pretty decent blow job for a very ""efficient price"".....Wrong....!
I should have knew that wasnt gonna be a good idea with the words ""Cheap and ""efficient"" together.....

There IS not tht many woman under 40 there....
Ex:
*The doorwoman (can't call her doorgirl she is the same age as my grandma)
*The dancers (3 under 45)
*The waitresses (they have big tits but are a 101 years old between the two of them)

A Word of advice go somewhere else....
 this place should be shutdown and turnt into something useful....

The best time to come is during happy Hour where all drinks are half off ($3.50 beer) from 7am to 7pm. No cover charge and usually a nice bartender on hand as well. Yes the attractiveness of the women are not Rhino quality, but lately the crop of talent has been quite good. IT's been around for years and is one of only two or three strip joints where you can gamble. Most of the time, the girls aren't hovering around you like the Big Boys, but you can actually have a conversation and not be pressured to purchase a $20 dance (most of the time). The kitchen closed a few years ago and the Monday Night Football buffet usually leaves a bit to be desired, but overall this is a solid local strip joint with friendly dancers and a cool attitude and vibe to match. Last night there were about six or seven dancers and several of them had some crazy great moves on the pole and others had great moves in general.

Did not have to pay a cover and no one mentioned a drink requirement. Also wanted to add in, this club was very couples friendly. Had no problem bringing my wife here.

What made me stop in was the amount of cars in the parking lot. Ok so locals are free. That's a plus...Drinks are cheap. Another Plus....I had Belvedere rocks for 6 somethin? That's not bad.
There is gaming. However, service kinda sucked. I spent about sixty bucks in the video poker and 1 comped drink because the bartender is SSsssllooowww. What is he looking at too much ass? Because there's not a lot in there. Ok so I liked 4 of the girls there. Well plus the nerdy goth waitress....hehehe whatever...she wants some big Myke. Mwahaha....But no I didn't give it up. It's actually a cool locals joint - mostly people were there drinking and eating, chillin and talking. Not a bad place. I had to knock it for service and quality of girls. But then again. I don't think it's that kind of club. 
There are some perks. I mean it's not completely dark. Which is good - so the lapdances you're getting you can at least tell if it's Chewbacca or a random MAN. At least when you're getting a dance you're not like ""oh your boobs on my face feel nice"" er...""no that's my elbow you're feeling""

So, I withdrew a hundred dollars after Tiki Bar. It was Christmas Eve, and I was giving myself that one present you get to open that night.
     I paid a ten dollar cover charge, and walked in. The place was dark, neon, mirrorey, and fairly empty, but it was open. Even in the dim lighting, I could see a handful of girls working the customers at the bar. To my left, the stage, and all the seats near it were empty, and I decided the safest (and cheapest) place to sit would be right by it. I sat down, ordered a cold bud light. (another ten dollars) Almost in response to my sitting down, an announcer called a girl to the stage. It was there I met Valentina. 
     She was nice, she was kind. She was showing most of what she had up on stage. She danced. I gave her money. After she danced on stage for a few songs, she came and chatted with me. She took me to the back area where we could chill and chat....and I also gave her more money for private dances. Eventually, I did run out of my allotted stripper money. I thanked her, wished her a Merry Christmas, and then left the place.
