The drinks are so delicious. I initially thought it was going to be like Sonic, where you just squirt any flavor into a soda. But there are so many different complex options and the staff is super helpful. They have a 100% drink guarantee which they constantly reassured us with.

I wouldn't think a soda shop would be a marvelous business idea but dangit if this place didn't amaze me anyway. Think Sonic's customized soda creations, but take out the shakes and add on cookies and other snacks, and you've got Fiiz drinks. They also have that pebble ice that people go wild for.

I rarely drink soda in the first place, but Dr. Pepper is my jam when I do- try the Berry Good Doctor for a pimped out version with strawberry puree, vanilla, coconut, and cream. I hear the owner likes his with raspberry instead, so I'll have to try that next time. 

Bring your kids for a special treat, this place is super family-friendly and the kid drinks are the cutest- fun colors plus cute garnishes like peeps and gummy worms! Bonus points for having a drive-thru lane to grab and go.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,19,4,0M6ZagjsPGx0TjELYquVzg

Well, you're in luck for the good timing of Fiiz Drinks opening! Now you don't have to run into your neighborhood gas station or feel weird going to a fast food joint just for a beverage!

I walked in here thinking they were open, when it was really their soft opening, so I won't comment too much on pace/service quality/etc. The owners were there.. training the staff and getting the hang of their drive through (yes drive through for hot days you don't want to get out of the car). They were Super helpful with great suggestions on the menu!

This is a soda bar (a franchise chain specifically and primarily in Utah). It's as classic as it can be with a modern flair. Their product of choice is the Coca Cola line and their menu is Exxxtennnnsive! Anything from dark mixers to light mixers to chocolate to shakes to Monster Energy mocktails.

It places a cool twist on a typical soda. I tried their Sprite/Pineapple/Coconut beverage and it was delicious! Tasted just like a refreshing pina colada minus the hangover. 

They serve snacks you can munch on like chips and cookies. They have a large bar to hang out at and tables to do some work on their wi fi. Their kids drinks looked good as did their options for shakes.

It's an interesting concept and they are in talks to open 3 more locations across the valley. I'd be interested to further patronize this establishment especially when you just need that good cheat day soda!",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,5,3,4,LOIl7IJfYCxKGx53K5uB9A

My first time here was just thru the drive thru with a friend and I tried the butterbeer flavored icee type drink and it was delicious ..  since I could see how cool it was inside from checking it out on Yelp I decided to bring my daughter here for her bday back on Oct 21..

I opted to go with the red devil with extra cinnamon syrup and the barqs red soda cause I sampled some of my friends on my first visit and it was delicious so this time around I went for it and loved it ! Tastes like a red hot candy !

Because I am a glutton I also got some hot cocoa which was good but I say the soda and slush type things are way better

My daughter got a candy corn drink that she liked a lot and my mom got some stuff too and there are pictures attached but essentially this is an awesome family friendly soda shop that has board games and a really welcome vibe ..

I recommend it as a fun place to enjoy some soda treats and relax with family and even the first time getting it via drive thru was good but they sometimes can be slow at recalling and getting your order right ..

They also have a rewards card so be sure to get one and if you get a drink and don't like it my friend said it happened to him and they swapped it out so I'm behind any business that guarantees their stuff",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,5,4,5,PRPIidTGF9S7Q8jEG4h_JQ

Aside from the interior, the menu is extremely OVERWHELMING! But you can simply narrow it down to what soda base you like most, but even after that is still difficult with so many different options and possibilities! They have colorful kids' drinks in clear cups with pictures to give you an idea of what they would look like as opposed to the extensive normal menu in opaque styrofoam cups. Having no idea where to even begin eyeballing up and down, left and right, I asked the very nice worker what her favorites were just to get an insiders tip on what they personally like. She mentioned strawberry shortcake off the sprite side and my interest shot up! I didn't even see that on the menu and seeing that right at the top, I definitely wanted to try now that--just knowing it's a choice has already knocked all the other choices out of the way with my tunnel vision. Eye. On. The. Prize. 
Got it. Drank it. Loved it. It has a creamy taste to it which I'm guessing is from mixing in whip cream with the sprite and strawberry syrup? Prices are reasonable if you stick to the sodas. 16 oz all the way to 44 oz. How nifty that they also have a drive thru!

It was busy! We sat at the bar. I ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate (favorite) and the Mean Chick. The drinks were complete in a few minutes, and they were delicious! Will definitely be coming back. They have a drive-thru as well if you're not in the mood to get out of the car!",-IM1qwYck6nqKizjCzR_ww,3,1,5,ff0OEKJzVEWxaGrHqI3aEw

The Yowza was my first fave, but the professor is an awesome choice it's like a tropical Dr Pepper. Mango Dew is delicious and the Captain Jack Sparrow is another fave. Come check them out you won't be disappointed and there is literally a choice for everyone.",SSb7p_67xcD8ZTCHYmWRUg,1,0,5,_iM-cvUID3sAjJA9okkwAw
