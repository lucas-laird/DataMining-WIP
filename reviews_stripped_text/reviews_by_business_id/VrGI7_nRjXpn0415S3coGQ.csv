Highly recommended is the PAD THAI -- and the PINEAPPLE RICE -- i asked them to add the Chinese sausage --  very flavorful -- texture of the noodles just right -- springy -- they don't break up -- they say a good test of a rice noodle dish  is whether the noodles break off or not, if they do, then they are missing a huge component of making the dish right.  The dishes are authentic and flavorful,  and they will ask what heat scale you would like each dish on a scale of 1-10.  No Watered down version here.

Food: Almost everything I have tried is really good. I highly recommend the Basil fried rice, the panang curry and the Pad see-ew.

Service: It's fair. If you're a regular, they take care of you. If you come in large groups they give you more food. I suggest going in between the rushes.

Pad see-eu with beef was great, I added the bright red chili sauce to light it up. Kids had Khua Kai noodle and bbq pork with Chinese sausage fried rice, both very mild and kid friendly. The salmon avocado curry was really good, bright orange curry with coconut milk and tiny shreds of kaffir lime leaf, and just a bit of heat. My fault for not ordering the hot stuff, but what we had was fresh and tasty. 

Wait staff was friendly and helpful, water glasses filled often and plates cleared timely. 

The men's bathroom, however, was another story. The grime covering the light switch and the door was worthy of the worst gas station bathroom, a foot above and below the knob it was black with grime. I mean black!  The vent fan had so much dust on it you could not see the grate. And it needed a coat of paint. With that lack of cleaning in the bathroom, it makes me wonder about the kitchen. I've been to many hole in the walls with run-down bathrooms, but this was just plain filthy. So I had to deduct a star.  So really, this is about a 3.5 star review, as the place is not really a 5-star.

I always order the Thai noodle soup with flat noodle (it's number 33 I even remember ha). They use Tomyum as the soup base which they barely dilute it for the noodle soup. Unlike other places where they always dilute the soup base and you don't even taste any favor, you are almost having a real Tomyum soup here. It comes with dinced pork, fish ball, shrimp, and fish cake etc. They were all perfectly cooked! 

This time we also ordered the dumplings as an appetizer. They were ordinary but delicious! They put a bit of spicy mayonnaise on top (most likely siracha mixed with mayo) and that gives the perfect kick to the dish.

Took the #203 bus at the corner of Neiman Marcus on Sands Ave, and within 5 minutes we were there.  Let me tell you, it was worth the trip.  

We ordered the Thai Coffee; Fish cakes; Spicy noodle soup; and Green Curry with Tofu; and Mango with Coconut Sticky rice.  YUMMO as Rachel Ray would say.  The bill came out to be $30.  Pretty cheap for Vegas dining.  

High recommend when you are all-buffet-out and want to eat good but cheap.  Good quality and great service.

I can't say I would have ever tried this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  It's tucked away from the main road and is just a tiny little space with only a few tables.  And, let's face it, Chinatown isn't exactly vegetarian-friendly.  Luckily I have Yelp to fill me in - not only is this place good but it has a separate vegetarian menu as well! With a ton of items to pick from!! 

I really enjoy the Panang Curry but I have a spot in my heart for Spicy String Beans.  I don't know why I love it so much and I'm starting to question if they load it with nicotine before they give it to me.  It has a lot of flavor and the veggies are always fresh.  My husband switches between Yellow Curry, Spicy Noodles, and Thai Fried Rice and loves them all.  We've also had the Tom Kha soup and Vegetarian Dumplings and they were great as well.  Don't worry, my non-vegetarian friends, there are plenty of choices for you and everyone I've seen dining at the restaurant seems to enjoy their meals.

Things to keep in mind: The place is very small so expect a wait during lunch and dinner rush.  Also, the tables can be a little tight so if you don't like eating close to strangers you may want to come at an off-time.  Finally, and most importantly, they are not joking around with the spice here.  I usually order a ""medium"" everywhere I go and am fine with it and can usually go spicier.  Here, I get a 3 out of 10.  And there have been a handful of times where it was still too spicy for me.  I say to err on the side of caution- you can always add more chili to your food later.

So, vegetarians, rejoice!  There is another restaurant for you to add to your arsenal.  Just make sure to specify ""no fish sauce.""  While they are usually good about it without needing to say anything, we did have one experience where fish sauce added to our meals.

If you ever find yourself in Chinatown looking for a new place to try, get your butt on over to Thai Style.  Just don't be hogging my table during the lunch rush!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,10,9,5,boFaDBARCkDDHjizDcMoDA

What's nice about the noodles is that you get to choose the type of Noodle you want. Whether you want the fat noodles, small rice noodles, vermicelli noodles, or egg noodles. My fiance ordered their beef Thai fried rice and it wasn't too bad. It's not like the Thai fried rice we have had at other Thai restaurants. Everything on their menu sounds appetizing! What's best is that because it's so small... you know they're making it when you place the order. 

This is a small family owned business and the service they provide is pretty amazing. They don't check on you to see if there's anything else you need but they're attentive when you're looking for someone to assist you or need something. 

Their price point is pretty affordable. Obviously comparing the price with Thai restaurants on the strip is pretty outrageous but compared to Thai town in Hollywood, CA it's pretty inexpensive.

I will dare say that this place is the next best thing to eating in Thailand, & I know because I have been there more than a few times ;) 

I had the chicken noodle soup with a combo of flat & egg noodles, which is just as good as you can get from the best street vendors in Thailand! The broth was definitely very flavorful & they give you all the great condiments to go with it. The sliced peppers in vinegar are awesome! However, it could have used a little more sprouts, cilantro & green onions in the soup. That would be my only request :) 

That is the best part about the street vendors, everything on their carts are fresh & plentiful & you can add as much & whatever you like & as many noodle combinations as you want in your soup. 

My date du jour had the pineapple fried rice & from the look on her face & her comments, she really enjoyed it. After we finished the main course, we decided to split the fried bananas with ice cream & drizzled with honey. WOW!! That delicious little dish is what earned that 5th star :D 

I also ordered some pork chow mein to take home with me, cuz I gots to have my noodles! I F**K's with them noodles! I F**K's with them hard!! I have to say, it wasn't bad. 

Overall, I would totally recommend this place. The seating is pretty limited & close enough quarters that you can hear every ones conversations :P The decor is almost nonexistent, but who cares, it's a great little spot to enjoy some great food. The wait staff is outstanding in my opinion, very pleasant & helpful. I will definitely be a regular at this place & will not mind the 15-20 minute drive whatsoever ;)",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,4,4,5,sjbMV8wmoYmktYd7_6RSnw

We ordered:
1) Duck Fried Rice--It was so salty! I felt like they poured in a cup of soy sauce and spoonfuls of msg into that dish. Don't get me wrong, our tastebuds were overjoyed from all the flavor. But is all that flavoring really necessary? I guess that's how some people like their food cooked though; it's just not for us. I think it would've been perfect had they just cut back on all the oil and soy sauce and even left out the msg.

2) Vegetable Stir-fry--Half of our stir-fry dish was made up with rice. They gave us the tiniest portion of vegetables. Like the fried rice, I felt like the stir-fry was just cooked in a ton of hoisin sauce/msg/soy sauce/salt.

3) Thai Iced Coffee--Too sweet! I think they added sugar on top of the condensed milk because that was the sweetest iced coffee I have ever had.

Service was decent. Even though we came at a busy hour, the waitresses were still attentive to us and quick with our orders.

Service is good. I had the Panang salmon avocado which came with rice, I think it was around $10. Ordered it medium spicy, which was really not spicy for me, but it was delicious. I wouldn't initially think hot avocado as something I would like but it works really well in this dish.  I love that they give you a lot of sauce to because I like soaking the sauce up with the rice. Also, the salmon was a pretty decent size, 3 pieces maybe 1 1/2 inches by 3 inches or so, I was very full by the time we were done. We also had the combo appetizer platter, the satay was good and the food on the app was tasty but most of it was fried so I probably would opt for the pot stickers next time.

Took my friend who was visiting from Cali here for a quick bite, since I thought the food quality would be the same but I guess I was wrong. I ordered the BBQ pork wonton soup and the wontons had a sour taste to them which were not mild, and made me think they may be expired. Broth was extremely red, probably due to the BBQ pork coloring, but at the other locations the broth is always brown and if anything, a hint of red; never would the entire soup be overpowered with a red color...In addition, the papaya salad was made with ripened papaya. When I say this, I mean that the papaya salad came out orange, instead of the bright green color. No it was not from the fish sauce, or because it may have been made laos style, it was because the papaya was ripe. It made the salad have a different soft texture and also added a sweet flavor to it which was not like the usual Thai style green papaya salad. Only time the waiter came by was to take our order, drop the food off, and give the check. No water refills or checking to see how the food was, probably because they didn't care and I could see it in the quality of the dishes.",UM4WR_-RwRTrRm2PLcxdQQ,1,0,2,11hiWY86bNgxZKKAnW90FA

Well, our experience was truly horrible. The server that we had was not the one we were used to. Initially, she was helpful despite the language barrier. When our dishes arrived, it was not what my mother indicated to her. She then became defensive and stated that it wasn't her fault that my mother did not accurately specify what she wanted. 

Mom sent back the soup which she never touched and the server gave her a hard time. The server never came back afterwards to ask us if everything was okay. In fact, it was the crew member who brought my mother the redone soup and gave us the same ""it's not our fault speech"" when we asked her questions. Mom told me that the soup did not taste like what she had the last time that she went. She suspects that it was the same soup with different garnishes.

The salad that I ordered tasted fresh and fine, but was missing ingredients that I am used to seeing such as galangal, lemongrass and thai chilies. Instead, I got a sliver of jalapeno pepper and saw that they use bottled lemon juice in the kitchen. In other words, they are charging the same prices, while shortchanging the customer on authenticity. FYI, they do not make their curries in house; they use a curry mix as per their own admission.

I was going to order dessert, but changed my mind after the latter. When it came time to check out, the server ignored me refused to give me the ticket. As a matter of fact, she looked angry and had a stone face while looking sideways. The crew member was the one who checked us out and tried to diffuse the tension. We did nothing to deserve such undignified treatment.

This time we had Three Companion (grilled chicken with sticky rice and papaya salad on the side), and fried chicken over fried rice, and more pad thai.  I didn't care for the sticky rice, but the grilled chicken was delicious.  High marks for the fried chicken over fried rice as well.  As a bonus, on the to-go menu, there is a coupon for free appetizer combo (egg rolls, fried wonton, and fried tofu) for purchase over $20.  They are not very good, but hey... they are free!

Now, I also stopped by to order a Shrimp Fried Rice togo and I was disappointed to open the box that wasn't even half full.....I paid full price for not even half a dish. Not only was it half empty, but there was only 4 shrimps.

She told me that she doesn't do that here. I was confused and asked why and showed her that there was barely any broth and she didn't care and walked away.

Our Lyft driver asked what Thai restaurant we were going to and I mentioned Thai Style and he gave us the thumbs up. If it's good enough for locals, you know it's gotta be good!

The spiciness level is on a scale of 1 - 10 and let me tell you, I can take a lot of heat, and my mouth was tingling at 6. Heed caution when choosing your level of spice!

We ordered the following:
Vegetarian Egg Rolls           $4.95
Papaya Salad                      $6.50
Fried Chicken over Fried Rice   $6.95
Chicken Pad Thai                $6.95 
2x Thai Ice Tea                   $1.95 each

I've never heard of Fried Chicken of fried rice but this dish was simply exceptional! Seasoned, lean cutlets of chicken breast lightly deep fried, had a crisp crunchy outer shell. The fried rice was well seasoned all around, had bits of carrots, onions, peas, green onions, and scrambled eggs. The Pad Thai was delicious, a generous plateful of slippery rice noodles with the perfect blend of sauce and heat. I really appreciated the large side of bean sprouts, so that you can add as much and as little as you like.

It's a very family run place, the tables were all full during lunch service on a Wednesday, with a heavy flow of take-out orders.

They had some specials on their board that I definitely have to try for the next time, the one that comes to mind is Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli :oP

2. BBQ Pork Wonton Soup - Very tasty, surprisingly our favorite. 
3. Mongolian Beef - Good, sauce was a little runny and light flavor, but essentially good. 
4. Orange Chicken - flavor good, but more batter than chicken, although it is really cheap so we really can't complain too much. 
5. Spicy Basil Leaf - This is a version of my favorite dish, called other places Chili Mint chicken. At first it was so salty I couldn't eat it, but then I poured 1/2 a cup of the broth from our soup over the dish and it was perfect!! 
6. Fried Banana's and vanilla ice cream - very yummy. 

So all of this food plus 3 Sprites cost us a whopping $44.00, and mind you the dish sizes were huge, most of the plates were still full.

Had ground pork and shrimp mixed with romain lettuce, shredded carrots, red onions all mixed in the Thai lime juice.  A very colorful dish.  Lastly the pork and fish ball soup was very simple.

Pad thai was pretty good, a little sticky. All the noodles got stuck together, but that shows the noodle was not cooked with two cups of oil.

Green curry was only reason I deduct a star from the rating. It was a little salty and I did not find it tasty at all. I mean, curry should taste complex and rich, but this one did not have either character.

Papaya salad, shrimp pad Thai, Tom yum Seafood noodle soup. Everything was overly salty and maybe that was the biggest problem. I couldn't really taste anything but salt.

My family and I were on a trip to the Grand Canyon and decided to make a pit stop in Vegas (it just seemed like the sensible thing to do, of course). Having been on the road for 5 hours that day, we refused to settle for any Chipotle or other fast-food restaurant, but we weren't in the mood to drop big bucks at a Vegas buffet. Yelp came to the rescue, and we found this gem of a restaurant in Chinatown! First of all - SO MANY OPTIONS! It took us a while to figure out what we wanted. We decided on the the yellow curry, green curry friend rice, thai spice noodles, and red curry, all of which were exquisite! It was truly addicting, with not a spice out of place. The hospitality was great, and our waiter was keen to give her recommendations and craft her suggestions based on our dietary restrictions.

The one on Jones & Warm Springs or the Fort Apache location does not even compare to this one (since this one is the original location). 

I ALWAYS get the duck fried rice. It's my favorite dish here. I recommend ordering their chicken satay (sooo good with the peanut sauce and cucumbers , you can always ask for extra of those) , dumplings , and papaya salad for appetizers. Their Thai iced tea is pretty good , it's not too sweet and comes in a large mug just for 2$. I have to also mention that the prices here are very reasonable compared to the portion sizes. The entrees (7-9$) are shareable & enough for two. Probably the only thing I don't like is that food isn't spicy enough. Their spicy level is 1-10 , and whenever I come here I always order a 10 & it's not spicy enough :( You have to add side spices to make it actually spicy. Also , I'm not really a fan of their angel hair noodles they use in their Pad Thai. Pad Thai is usually bigger in size. Their pad see ew is really good though , they use big flat rice noodles and it's cooked to perfection with Chinese broccoli , egg and choice of meat. I like getting chicken and/or tofu with mine.

You can order most of the items on the menu vegetarian or vegan :) AND they have brown rice available. My vegan friend really liked the Tom kha (Thai spicy and sour hot soup with coconut milk).",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,4,5,4,FwCoZ6xNIJJwTSN02dQCOg

Thai Style Noodle House was our first stop. 

The restaurant is small and we filled up half the restaurant with our table of 8. 

The first thing I noticed was the crazy mural on the wall... I didn't like the Vegas motif mixed with Thai gods. 

But the second thing I noticed, which I was very happy about, was how well priced everything was. 

All their items sounded really good. I was naturally gravitated towards the duck dishes because I rarely see duck on menus. I had one of my friends share with me so I could try more than one item. 
We got a fried flat noodle dish and the duck curry.

Both dishes came out with big portions but more so for the duck curry. It came in a bigger bowl than the other curry dishes. 

This part of the review is very IMPORTANT! 
Do yourself a favor and skip the Thai Tea... Sure it's good and all but you got to order the Coconut Juice. It might just be the most refreshing drink you ever had. 

I ordered a Thai Tea but when I tried my friend's Coconut Juice, I asked one of my friends on the other far end of the table to take it off my hands so I can order the coconut juice.

Started looking at the Trifold menu...and my sillyass spread my arms out wide, put my hands across everyones menu's n was like....I don't care what we get...DUDE!!!...whats the name of the cocunut spicy soup cuz we are SO getting that!!!...(Tom Kha)...Mmmmmm!!!

Between the 3 of us we had a Huge Bowl of Tom Kha (medium), Duck Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Mongolian Beef w/ Rice... (all for $35 w/ tip mind you!!!....)

Before I start all I am going to caveat with is the fact that we ate around 6...it is 1am and I just woke from my Food Coma!!!

Portions were Big!!!  Usually I like everything spicy spicy!...we order the Tom Kha medium, and it was a perfect blend of keeping all the flavor without being overpowered...Medium is a good hoice is someone can't handle spicy well as was in our case, De-Ri-Cious!!!
The Duck Fried rice was over the top...again great portion size and you could see the large cuts of duck in there, YUMMM!!!
Pad Thai (combo)...portion size was a lil smaller then the previous 2 but totally adequete...great taste
Not gonna lie, Mongolian Beef was tasty, but nothing to rave about like the previous ones...

The roasted duck noodle was quite good and tasted different than other broths. I like different things so this was a very nice change of pace for me. 
The chicken noodle soups are so perfect for combating a cold. You get a good amount of food for a decent price, which makes it an excellent value. 
It's somewhat small inside, so be ready for that. Maybe avoid peak hours. And if it matters, there are actual Thai people working here. For some reason I like watching them take down my order in Thai.

It took a while to get my order in as the waitress was busy socializing with her fellow co workers. Ummm, not okay.
I ordered vegan potstickers (which came out with mayo all over them), sent them back to get another order which was dry outside and greasy inside, and the silver noodle salad. The salad was decent, but not worth the high volume noise of

We were hungry, so we quickly figured it out! My friend had the duck fried rice, I had seafood pad thai, and we had calamari as an appetizer. I liked the calamari, it was meaty and piping hot, but didn't have a lot of spice or kick to it. A little sauce fixed that up, though.

My friend's duck fried rice was delicious! I had food envy for sure, but restricted myself to only one bite. If I go back, I'll definitely get more of that! My seafood pad thai was also good, but again, not much kick. That was my fault for not ordering higher on the spice level.

He's addicted to the beef noodle soup, so naturally, I had to try it out as well. The first thing I noticed about this little place was the Tshirts pinned to the wall, so cheesy and SO THAI! Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them.
There were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you).
I noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness.
My noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right.

The place always has people inside and the aroma as you walk up to the door is enough to make your mouth water.

My favorite dish would definitely have to be the Thai fried rice with chicken. The dish has the perfect amount of onions and chicken and rice and seasonings. This dish is enough for two people or two meals for one (which is what I do).

I would also recommend #38, which is sorta like pan fried noodles with bean sprouts and a sweet/spicy sauce.

I've never had the Thai iced tea but it's a nice orange color and from what I hear, it's pretty good if you're looking for a cool refreshing drink.

Maybe the restaurant was just a cover for a massage parlor or high stakes poker game. The available tables were sloppy, and greasy -with dirty dishes everywhere. Not a good first impression to say the least.....

After looking over the menu, we decided to give it a shot. My wife ordered 2 entrees (she is not fat I swear). First, she ordered the beef Thai noodle soup. The broth was fantastic, however the beef was fatty --EWWWW. 

Her second entree was the cashew chicken. Not bad, but we have had much better versions of this dish in the Las Vegas area. I decided on the chicken basil fried rice-level 5. The rice was a little greasy, but very good. I am glad I didn't go over a 5 on it-- it had some heat!  Our total bill with soft drinks came out to about $25.00.

Beware of the spiciness level. 1-10, we got a 6 and it was pretty spicy, and I can usually handle spicy.

Papaya salad: sooo good, one of the best papaya salads I've ever eaten. Very refreshing, and the level 6 spiciness was just enough kick.

Duck fried rice: another 5 star dish, highly recommended

Tom Yum Noodle Soup: deliciousness continues, the soup base is perfect.

Panang Avocado: this is the only dish I didn't really like. We requested salmon and shrimp, but only got shrimp, they forgot the salmon.

VERY AFFORDABLE. Cheap and delicious food, what more can I ask for

Prices are really decent and food here is very good.  I ordered their yellow curry with chicken. I was very pleased as they used white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat, which I dislike.  Portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.  A great deal especially since it was only $6.75 for my meal.   Some of the other members of my party ordered their duck soup and said it was delicious. Pad thai and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.  

My hubby and I use to dine at Archie's off Flamingo as they have pretty good food too, but in comparison to this place, their prices are higher and portions not as generous.  

TIP:  Skip the overpriced Thai/Asian Restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.  Food is just ehh and not to mention, they hurt the pocket.

He told me that he wanted to take me to his secret Thai restaurant that he thinks is bombb, but doesn't know the name of it because it doesn't have a sign on the door.

First off, I recall people mentioning that they may not give lunch menus unless you ask, so we sat down & searched for the lunch menu, but it was nowhere to be found. I ask the waitress & boom, out comes the lunch menu. I think it's $5.50 for 1 entree & $7.something for 2. 

When my friend orders, she asked him what level spiciness 1-10, but I was still debating if I should go healthy and get a salad or order some yummy lunch specials. It took me awhile to order & the waitress asked me instead if I want mild, medium, or hot for my spicy eggplant with beef and green curry with chicken. I thought that was weird, but I got hot (whatever that means). Lunch specials also come with a choice of eggroll or fried tofu & a little salad. We got home & dug in. The spicy eggplant was nothing special and the green curry was not as basil-y as others I've tried. The vegetables in the green curry were kind of funky, as in, they weren't very bountiful or filling and I have no idea what anything else was other than the green beans (even those I'm uncertain of). Anyway, my other complaint is that ""hot"" was not hot. My 2 year old was digging in, and she's not one for super spicy foods. Overall, I'd say lunch specials are fair and the food was alright.

I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.

I was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there. 

But all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. 

Their food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience.",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,10,8,5,_zoCRh7lagzJI0SQ5UuqFw

This Thai-ny restaurant may be petite but they pack huge flavor into their dishes. They have multiple locations, however, the chef at this location is our favorite! The portions are generous and the flavor is always on point. The ambiance is dive-y and at times the service may seem scattered, but this place stays busy since the food is En-Thai-cing! For lazy weekend nights, we always order take-out from this place without a second thought. The Appe-Thai-zing food keeps us coming back!

Items we tried:

* Beef pad see ew $6.95 - Really juicy! We order this dish every single time we dine here and it's always delicious! They're very generous with the wide noodles. The sauce is an explosion of flavor, mixed with lots of Chinese broccoli, fluffy egg soaked in all of that tasty sauce and nice amount of tender beef. Everything is cooked expertly! Rated: 5/5

* Green curry chicken fried rice $7.95 - This is another dish we can't get enough of! A flavor bomb of deliciousness! The spices and green curry flavor comes through strong, very aromatic. There are long beans added for texture, bamboo shoots, basil, carrots and green bell pepper. We're always satisfied with the flavor of this dish! Rated: 5/5

* Panang avocado $8.95 - This is my first time trying avocado in of a warm curry and let me tell you, it works, very well! The perfectly ripe avocado is added like a garnish at the very end when serving, so it doesn't really get cooked. It adds such a wonderful silky and buttery texture to the curry! I'm a huge fan! Rated: 5/5
 
* Combo Appetizer sampler $8.95 - It comes with 1 eggroll, 2 crab Rangoon, 2 fried shrimp, 2 fried wonton, 2 chicken satay, 2 fried tofu. It's a good-sized starter for 2 people, maybe 3. I enjoy the Rangoon and also the fried tofu is fried to crispy perfection. I love their house made sauces that's served with the appetizer, there's a peanut and a sweet and sour sauce one; I want to dip everything in them! Rated: 3/5

* Papaya salad $6.50 - It's a traditional spicy and sour salad made from shredded unripe papaya mixed with long beans, tomato, toasted and crushed peanuts and served with a side of cabbage. You can pick your spice level when you order. The flavor was balanced and the spice level was perfect. I really loved their version, but I felt the portion was small. Rated: 4/5

* Pad ped snapper $8.95 (Thai curry stir fried with crispy red snapper mixed with bamboo, bell, young pepper seed, basil and baby corn) - The red snapper filets weren't too crispy and might be from the frozen section of the market, but the sauce is where it's at! The caramel sauce was packed with deep flavor, it was hard not to like this dish. I just wish they were more generous with the sauce, pouring it over rice was awesome! Rated: 3/5

* Pad Thai $6.95 - Their version here will do just fine, but it's not my favorite. I feel that the sauce is lacking much needed, bold tamarind flavor. Usually it tastes like it's missing something. Rated: 3/5

* S11 guay-teaiw-loard $8.25 (Chicken, shrimp, squid, tofu, mushroom, with black soy sauce served over steamed flat noodle and bean sprouts)  - The wide noodles are always a favorite, but the salty and sweet soy gravy was very potent and almost killed the palate. There was a prominent ginger aroma and flavor throughout the dish. However, the overwhelming amount of bean sprouts and the protein was unidentifiable, making this dish unexciting. Rated: 2/5

*PRO TIP* add fried or soft tofu to any of these dishes to add some more protein and another dimension of texture! So good!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,79,77,5,2OuomHHFJ2ZvgRJUtScMiQ

We ordered three dishes for the four of us: chicken pad thai, beef noodle soup, and a dish with thick, flat noodles with eggs, meat and a little bit of veggies.

I requested the chicken pad thai to be spicy. She asked me ""how spicy on a scale of 1-10?"" I said 7. Fast forward 8 minutes later, my pad thai was NOT spicy AT ALL. =/ What the.... hmmm. So either they completely forgot about adding any spiciness to my dish OR a 7 is considered mild. Can someone clarify how this whole spicy rating works???? Is 1 super spicy or vice versa?

If I go to any thai restaurant, I gotta order either a thai iced tea or a thai iced coffee. My sister and I ordered a iced tea and iced coffee respectively.

Prices were pretty good. Our dishes were between $6-8 and our drinks were about $1.75 each.

Read that they had a Vegan/vegetarian menu and decided to try it out. Arrived just past noon on a Saturday and there were a few tables open. We were seated immediately, and I asked for the Vegan/Vegetarian menu. After much deliberation, I ordered the Veggie potstickers and the Pad See Eu with mixed tofu and veggies.

Veggie potstickers: When ordering, I confirmed with the waiter that these were vegan without dairy and egg products. He assured me they were. When they arrived, they had a creamy sauce on it, so I asked him what it was. He said it was mayo (which I already assumed) and I proceeded to tell him that mayo is NOT vegan. He said he didn't know that, which was alarming to me, because how can you advertise a vegan menu without knowing what things are/are not vegan? He took back the potstickers and brought back another order without the mayo. He assured me that the potstickers themselves were vegan. I ate one carefully and it was okay. Nothing to call home about. 

Pad See Eu (veggie) with tofu and mixed veggies: really flavorful and filling. The portion size was huge and I got lots of big chunks of tofu. I am very pleased with how this dish came out. It was only $6.95, too! Totally worth it. 

Overall, I would come again for the main dishes but not the apps. The potstickers were just okay and I'm disappointed that they were not actually vegan and that the waiter didn't know that they weren't. I'm giving 4 stars because of the potsticker mishap.

Once we found the place we weren't exactly too sure if we were in the right place because all it said was noodle house but once we got inside the full restaurant name was painted on the left with a cool mural as well. The mural looked like a hole in the wall, which is exactly what the restaurant is. We were seated very quickly and you can easily tell how busy they were.

On to the food, my boyfriend and I ordered the pad see ew, bbq over fried rice and the Tom yum soup with the think noodles. Sorry no pictures cause we ate it too quickly! The food came out very quick considering a huge family was still waiting for theirs. A little bit of background, my boyfriend is thai and his mom is also a retired Thai chef and we've visited Thailand together twice. So trust that we know good Thai food, and trust that the food here is amazing. The pad see ew tasted just like how his mom makes it. Savory but sweet and with a large portion as well. The bbq chicken over fried rice was my favorite though. The fried rice was really yummy and the bbq chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce that you can dip it in. The Tom yum soup was an okay dish to me, Thai people love their lemongrass and it was a little bit too much for me. We got a level 8 spicy but if you're not used to Thai spicy the level 5 is spicy for Americans. Don't test yourself or try to act cool and get 10... You'll die so don't think about it. The waitresses were very nice and no matter how busy they were they took their time with each customer and checked to see if there was anything else needed.

I also ordered papaya salad heat level 8 and they barely made it a 1, they handed me sambel olek to make spicier! Rude right? We all know you need to use Thai chili peppers and remix the salad to give it that fire spicy kick.

Everyone loves the noodle soup for a good reason, it's probably the best and cheapest you'll get in Vegas.

I'm sure there are things Lotus doesn't do as well as Thai Style.  Oh, am I defending my mistress over my wife?  I'm sorry, sometimes I can't control myself.

Well, there's another thing with my mistress.  She surprises me with how thoughtful she can be.  There's a waitress at Thai Style that has an amazing memory.

Thai Style Noodle House is small and can only sit a very limited amount of people. This is not the best place for a party greater than 4-6 people. The table are usually set for two people and if a table with 4 shows they will combine a table for you. They only have two racks of hot sauce  holders which you must share with all the table in the restaurant. 

My table of two ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Chu Chee Salmon, and Duck Fried Rice. I also had the Thai Style Ice Tea. 

The place would have received four stars but some error occurred on the waitress side. I placed an order for Thai Style Ice Tea in the beginning when they ask for drinks. She returns with water for my guest and nothing for me. She places our three orders and I start to wait. Once the chicken pad thai and duck fried rice has arrived I informed her about my miss drink. She recalls and bring me the Thai Style Ice Tea. I highly recommend the pad thai because it was delicious and the thai style ice tea. I was a little disappointed in the duck fried rice since it seem to have more pork than duck. We informed the waitress that we have not gotten the Chu Chee Salmon and she informed us it was coming. By the time we finish the pad thai and was almost done with the duck fried rice the Chu Chee Salmon has arrived. I am guess she has forgot about the order until the reminder.

For starters I have been recommended this place plenty of times and finally decided last week to give them a try. Really been craving Thai food these past few weeks so I thought why not?! My co-worker and I took our lunch break together after an appointment with a client and just so happens she loves Thai food as well.

When we walked in, there really wasn't anybody working but the kitchen people. Finally after just guessing to just seat ourselves that's exactly what we did. Maybe 5 minutes later a lady from the back came out and gave us menus. We inquired about them having any kind of lunch specials and was shut down really quick like ""No! No lunch specials here.. we too small for that"" I'm like huh?! okay girl whatever tell us what's good here then... She then said ""Other location have lunch special we don't"" Okay.. we get it no lunch special that's fine so tell us what's good here.. She was clueless I was already starving and this encounter was getting me even more irritated than I already was. Time was being wasted and we had to get back to work. 

Finally we ordered.. Egg rolls... Yellow Shrimp Curry & Shrimp Pad Thai. Entire meal was just like huh is this really what people are raving about? Our first batch of egg rolls came out and they were burnt, sent those back and by the time the new ones came the actual entree's were also ready. My co worker and I both agreed that the shrimp that was in both of our dishes was way too fishy and I just can't eat seafood when it has that particular taste. I eat plenty shrimp and I know it's not suppose to taste like that.. When we brought it to the severs attention she could careless. I didn't make a big deal about it because it just wasn't worth it.. I just won't be back it's that simple.. I hear the other location is better but I'm even questioning wanting to try that one out...",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,0,1,X6ipOvzDy5PGRMf9n11UjA

Thus if you have a rather large group there could be a problem, also if you have small rambunctious rug rats there isn't a whole lot of room and things for them to do. The food has always been excellent. I recommend the chicken noodle soup with thin noodles or the chicken pad thai.

THE MOST ANNOYING thing of this particular restaurant is that they have a Lunch SPECIALS MENU but never say anything and don't tell you about it. They keep it hidden and you have to ask for it every time and when you do they seem upset you asked. It's as if they make commission on lunch sales or something. It make me feel like they would rather have you pay full price for your meal.

Grossed out and not wanting to eat any longer, we notified the lead server and showed them my little hitchhiker roach and even though they apologized for the incident we decided to leave.  

In retrospect, I'm glad I fished the little roach out before I got more than three spoonfuls of soup down.  The soup is a dark brown broth.

3318293,2013-10-23,0,VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ,"One thing I will give this place is the prices of their food. Their normal entrees of Thai staples like fried rice, pad thai, and pad see ew were pretty decently priced. For the price, the portions weren't too bad at all. For the taste and the service, it's a little bit iffy.

When I received my order of pad thai, the thing I noticed was a good third of my plate was occupied by bean sprouts and the rest of noodles. They have this illusion that you got a lot of food, when all you got was an average amount. I did not really like how they did that, but it was $6.95, what's there to complain about? The taste of the pad thai was how you expect it to taste, so nothing funky there. When the pad see ew came, a lot more food looked present than in the pad thai. That was a very good sign to me! But the bad thing was that it had a funky after taste that I'm not use to. It's not the typical taste that I have had at other places, and the aftertaste wasn't a good aftertaste either. I don't know if that's how they normally make it or it was just that day, but I didn't like it too much. The fried rice that my friends ordered though, especially the fried chicken fried rice looked pretty epic... I should have gotten that, had I known how much they would give for that. Well, their portions were good, but it didn't really make up for the service that bothered me a little bit. 

The waitresses were nice and served us appropriately. They took our orders in a timely fashion and refilled our waters before it hit the bottom of the glass, but the thing that bothered me was that they rushed our party a little bit toward the end of our meal. This particular location is a little small, and so larger parties are going to have a hard time being seated. My party consisted of 6 and we had a little trouble being seated. When another party came in that was 6 as well, they kind if made it a point they wanted us out to sit the next people. I understand it's a business and they want to make money, but you shouldn't shoo away the customers that you have for the next set. That's fairly rude if you ask me. So after a bit, my friends finished eating and we headed out. 

I won't be coming back here under my own choosing. I'm not really big on the service, or the taste of the Thai food, but it's decently cheap for the portions they give you and so if you want value, I will recommend this place, but not so much on taste & service.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,4,0,2,6vLJxur2uPQBnOIrlEv2CA

3345507,2014-08-25,0,VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ,"So I called this place for delivery while I was staying at the Rio. 

I had visited Hoover Dam, had ziplined from the rooftops of the Rio, bought a wedding dress, and had been walking around and my feet hurt. Once I got to my room at 9:00pm, the last thing I wanted to do was go back to the valet to get my car, or walk around the strip to find a place to eat because that would have taken time and I would have been hungry, cranky, starving and grumpy at 10:00pm while walking/driving around aimlessly trying to find a restaurant.

Here comes yelp to save the day. At this point, I don't care who brings me food. There were some bad reviews but like I said, at this point in the evening, with hungry kids in the hotel room, who cares. So we placed our order over the phone and waited...

They only deliver to the front valet drop-off area probably because they don't want to take the time to park and navigate the hotel to find your room. That's understandable. The delivery guy called when he was 5 minutes away. We were already waiting downstairs but that was a nice gesture to make things run as efficiently as possible. We expected a guy to roll up and toss us the food through the window but he didn't do that. We were focused on the cars and didn't even spot him until we realized there's a guy standing on the sidewalk across from us holding bags of food. 

We ordered the fried calamari, orange chicken with sauce on the side, wonton soup, wonton noodle soup, pad Thai, panang beef, crab fried rice, and extra steamed rice. The portions were generous, prices were reasonable, quality and taste were average. It was exactly an hour when the food arrived. I timed the exact moment we called in the order. I think that was pretty quick considering they had to make the food, package it, and drive it to us, all within that time frame. We forgot to ask for plates and they didn't ask us either. The only disappointment is that I expected lots of crab meat in the crab fried rice similar to OSHA Thai or at least some lump crab pieces but instead it was just fried rice topped with a scrambled egg/crab mixture.

Even though the prices are a lot cheaper than the rest of the Thai places, the quality was a bit disappointing. I ordered Papaya Salad, Pad See Ew, and Chicken Tom Yum. Papaya Salad was average, if not satisfactory. I did like the Tom Yum although it was a bit too sweet. The disappointment finally came when I tried the Pad See Ew. It was too salty, no real sauce flavor and pretty boring. 

For the price of around 6-7, you can't really complain, but when it comes to my beloved Thai food, I'm willing to pay a few bucks more for better taste....",p5YSVJLB3NGmFhiYf2HXSw,0,0,3,svyy-72NDB2537G8Z5jtCA

The other half got there before us and ordered a whole bunch of appetizers. We then ordered some entrees and everything was good! I ordered the Beef Pad Thai, my friend got the Yellow Curry Chicken and Pineapple Fried Rice and Maribel T. ordered fried pork. Everything was Yummy! I was surprised with myself that I actually liked the curry as I am not really into curry. I'm either getting use to it, or their curry wasn't too curry for me, it was just right.  The prices are also reasonable, I think our tab was around $125 which was about 9 different entrees and quite a few orders of appetizers.

Maribel T. told me they have good papaya salad from Yelp reviews. I usually go on Yelp before trying out a new restaurant, but I didn't go it this time. I should have gone with my gut feeling in ordering papaya salad...I ended up craving it later one...Ha! a reason to go back here :)

Why 4 stars, instead of 5 stars? A little hard to find and I didn't like that the waitresses kept looking at our table to see if we were done eating, instead of coming up to our table and ask if we were done, give us our check or ask us if we needed boxes.

Such a hidden location, and so quaint! But man, the food here is GOOD. 

DAY 1:

2 BIG mugs of Thai Iced Tea :)
i especially love the huge beer mug they serve it in.

Combo Appetizer
Love the chicken satay! Mmm... and the onions and cucumbers in the small bowl! Everything else was pretty good. A nice way to start.

Duck Fried Rice
duuuuude, seriously, this was the hook once I opened up that tri-fold menu! It was deeeelicious, and I could not stop raving about how big the pieces of duck were in it!

#S11
The name of the actual dish slips my mind, but my boyfriend and I ordered it medium-spicy thinking it was going to be okay, but IT WAS HOT but not so hot to mask the actual food! I am not used to spice, but I ate it as fast as I could, still enjoying the dish, so as not to torture my inexperienced taste buds.

DAY 2:

Just ONE big mug of Thai Iced Tea

Thai Style Noodle House Pot Stickers
You get 6 of them! They are deep fried and have 3 different sauces on them, something like a sweet mayo, then a teriyaki, and some sriracha all across the tops! Our waitress actually informed us it was the most popular appetizer ordered. Sold. It was a good mixture of sauces! Thought it would be too much, but it was great together.

Seafood Rad-Na with Wonton
Saw this cute little dish hand-drawn/written on a piece of paper on the wall near us! Couldn't resist. This dish was decent, but still enjoyed it!

Three Companions (Pork)
The pork is soft! It's marinated I believe, and the papaya salad and sticky rice it comes with were all good!

Then, a Thai Iced Tea to go.

Okay, so all in all, both days, both bills were under $35! The portions were large! The service is off the hook! And the environment is so friendly! The waitress with the glasses is wonderful! She remembered us from the previous day! The bathrooms are clean, both boys and girls, and we were always checked up on!

Thai Style Noodle House will definitely be a stop for me while in China Town. I do plan on returning to try the noodle soups, as I had seen several HUGE bowls of soup being served, and at reasonable prices! Forget my Pho during the winter!

The tables can be very close so it is not the place for an intimate conversation, and close enough where I become friends with a neighboring diner!!!

I love their noodle dishes, however at the suggestion of a young Thai woman (my neighbor dining friend"" suggested I try the Salmon Avocado Panang Curry with a heat of 8 and I am in LOVE!

We entered the restaurant and it was exactly as I expected. T shirts on the wall, a couple of small pictures hanging up, old tables and chairs. The 2 waitresses for the night were having their own dinner in the corner but they were quick to give us the menus and take our drink order. I appreciated that. While we looked at the menu, the waitress was kind enough to ask us if we were meat-challenged and then whipped out a vegetarian menu for us to order from. Yay! 

Our order tonight:

Papaya Salad : Green Beans, slivered raw papaya, tomatoes in a tangy, sweet dressing with just a hint of spice after every mouthful. I was licking the plate clean. I thoroughly enjoyed this salad

Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu : My husband's order. I ended up eating lots of it. The fried tofu tasted divine. Honestly, there wasn't much of the basil flavoring in the rice but I still thought it was tasty. My husband wasn't a big fan as he thought it didn't really taste like how it was supposed to (he swears by Komol's Basil Fried Rice)

Green Beans and Tofu in a Red Curry Paste : This was my least favorite of the 3 dishes we ordered. It tasted sort of strange...and very much like the red curry paste was processed. My husband actually quite enjoyed it and said there was a lemongrass taste to it that was pleasant but I have to differ on his opinion. 

Our total bill (including a 15% tip) came up to 25 bucks. This cannot be beat. Period.

Yes, the portions can't feed 16 people and the restaurant might need some interior decorating intervention but I thought the taste of the food was good, the menu interesting, the service friendly and fast and the price very reasonable. 

I will definitely be back...maybe for a lunch special or the Khua Kai Noodles which sound so interesting. Komol still ranks my Number 1 in Thai favs but this little treasure has definitely earned a place in my go-to restaurants.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,8,5,4,awtZe9PtGV95F_SHVCFfXA

I don't think it was a good combination with this type of soup.  So I guess I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I also tried to order their duck fried rice, but to my dismay, they ran out of duck, so I had to settle for the crab fried rice instead.  The fried rice did have real crab meat in it, but there weren't that many pieces and the flavour of the crab was not infused into the fried rice, so again I was disappointed.  But then I saw the table next to me was eating the rad na with what looked like wonton noodles and it looked good.  So on a separate occasion, I ordered the rad na to take out.

I first discovered this place getting food for my wife and I one night at the Palms.  We ordered the Tom Yum Kai w/chicken.  The noodle soup was fabulous!  The amazing flavor combination of the soup was intense.  One can taste the sour, sweet, tangy and a bit of heat all in one taste.  The flavors are intense.

I then tried the duck fried rice and I was hooked!  The sweetness of the duck, combined with the heat and flavors of the rice was a perfect combination.  I love the way they put the dish together.  I've also tried the Spicy Thai noodles, Pad Thai and Pad See Eww.  All were great with a bounty of flavors.  Nothing over $10!!!

The fried chicken on fried rice is easily one of the top 5 dishes I've had in Las Vegas.  It's exactly what it sounds like, served with a small cup of sweet & sour sauce on the side.  I've uploaded a pic of it and you can see how massive it is.  Probably a good 3-4 cups of fried rice and 2 large pieces of excellent quality chicken, and just for $7.  It's also really good reheated, provided you throw the chicken in a pan to get the right level of crispiness.  

I've also had a pork panang, and once again asked for it as hot as possible and even said ""way above 10"".  After the meal I asked the server and she said she had actually given me an 8 or 9, which I felt was more like a 5 or 6.  Meh, we'll get there one of these days.

I had my first Thai iced tea here and it was awesome.  Can't really compare it to any other place, but as someone who pretty much only likes sickeningly sweet southern iced tea, that should give you an idea where I'm coming from.  Even as picky of an eater as I am, there's so much I want to try on the menu and I plan on probably going back a dozen or more times in the next month for sure.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,4,4,5,KGAp4z3Hul8GOMWl0062tw

Walking into the Thai Style Noodle House, I knew I was about to sacrifice one of my favorite things about the ""new dining experience"". That is, I love asking the server to make recommendations, you can learn a lot about a place from this simple question. But I know from experience that Chinatown servers are not into recommendations, at least not to a 'pale-white farm boy', other than boring, ordinary, tasteless, ""American Style"" dishes that are sure not to offend any taste buds. Of course, I always have Yelp to guide me to something on the menu that is likely to please.

As I expected, when I ordered the Noodle House Tom Yum Noodle Soup (fat noodles with a 7 on the spice range), I got a series of questions from the server, all apparently designed to discourage me from my order: ""It's sour."" she says. ""Sure you want soup?"" she asks, ""That's very hot."" came her final plea, with a combined look of confusion and compassion (the later to be served after diner).

The fat noodles were a perfect compliment to the hot and sour soup and a 7 on the spice level sat just perfect with me. A great big thank you to the Yelpers out there, who provided the ammunition I needed to complete my order without the assistance (or even approval) of the server. Don't get me wrong, she did a splendid job and was very attentive to my water glass (Misty and I are simpatico on this matter), she just looked frightened that I would have a coronary and she'd have to cover my tab out of her tips.

There is a sister restaurant out in my neck of the woods that I will be making regular visits to as I learn more about this Thai food craze everyone's going on about - :). 

I figure I got a good ten years left before I have fully traversed the culinary landscape that is Chinatown alone, so many wonderful new flavors for the tongue. The Noodle House is definitely going to become one of my new standards, even if they never stop looking terrified of my menu selctions.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,8,5,4,SA5N8cybe29JjrniPlgAEQ

I've been here before... Had a very decent papaya salad that time and was craving Mongolian beef today. So badly. Tender, juicy, saucy beef. I ordered with extra veggies and no rice. 

What I got was the TOUGHEST chunks of old beef and 2 pieces of small broccoli plus a ton of onions. I guess those are my ""extra veggies"" instead of rice. The beef is so disgusting and old. It tasted OLD and it is extremely chewy. 

I cannot believe that this is ok to sell to people. This kind of beef cut is intended for long, 12 hr stews, not flash fry.

3634660,2011-01-29,4,VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ,"I have had this place bookmarked for my last three trip to Vegas and I finally got here.  It is hard to find in the dark, even harder to park as it is on the street at the end of an industrial complex.  It is right across to the East from Chinatown Mall which also has parking problems during prime eating hours.

My initial attraction to this place was from reviews by a few of my friends.  When I checked in I was impressed to find Misti, the Vegas CM, is the Duchess of this place.

I chose a Thai iced tea to drink.  Even in my limited experience it was only OK but not great.  It got better from there.  As an appetizer I ordered shrimp rolls ($5.95) which were 6 large shrimp in a roll and deep fried with a peanut sauce.  For my entree I chose Rad-na with chicken.  It was very good but I feel I cheated myself of some flavor by ordering it mild rather than 3 or 4 on the spice scale.

It is definitely a hole in the wall with basic decor.  The service was really great and the two young women were on top of their game while still being able to kid around with the regulars, it is a very comfortable place to visit.   While I was there both a sit down customer and a take out customer mentioned they had driven past the second location to go there because they did not like the food there as well.  I am sure by the comments that they are trying very hard to make them indistinguishable,

I get salmon chu-chee off the specials. It's fucking amazing.

Their spice level is... Thai. Their ""5"" is an American ""10"" which means their spices are double compared to ours. 

Didn't have a problem with this place other than that the place is tiny and the kitchen is pretty much in the dining area. So it's kinda loud if you get seated near the kitchen (you can hear the pots and pans rattling as well as the dishes being cleaned) but that's just the venue.

Service is pretty much good and have been consistent especially how busy they can get. However, the food here is really good and the price point makes this place a good value for authentic Thai food in the vicinity. Some of the dishes that I personally love is the Panang Curry, coconut based curry sauce with a spicy and tangy taste paired well with rice. Another dish worth mentioning is the Pad See Ew, soy sauce based with flat rice noodles with the option of your choice of protein. On cold nights, their Tom Yum soup with seafood is spot on delicious and flavorful with your choice of noodles. 

Pro-Tip, many of the dishes are for individual serving but you can opt to have a la carte for a more sizable and family style portion to share in your group. Overall, a great place to have homestyle Thai food in the Chinatown area!

We originally were headed to Palms for their buffet, but since it was Father's Day and a Sunday, they only offered a pricy brunch at $22.99 each. Thus, Thai food it was.

Location: Turn on Wynn and look out for the ""Noodle House"" sign. Parking is located along all the other strip mall restaurants on the main road. The inside of the restaurant is very small; you can see all the tables once you walk into the place. Luckily, we arrived a little before the lunch rush, at 11:30, so we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 5. The two servers were excellent at clearing tables and getting people seated, so turnaround was very quick.

Food: We decided to order family style, so we shared the #41 shrimp pad thai, #42 pad see ew w/ chicken, thai fried rice w/ shrimp, #4 special deep fried snapper w/ ginger. The noodle dishes came out in a short amount of time, and they were fantastic! I particularly liked the pad see eww with the delicious flat noodles and the tasty sauce. The snapper was part of a sauce dish (not just deep fried and on a plate like we expected), but it was also delicious, as was the other two dishes.

It was a lenten friday on our vacation, so we were on the search for some seafood.  We didn't feel like paying $30 for a buffet or eating some fried fish sandwich from a fast food joint, so one of us came up with the great idea to have some Thai food.  Yelp to the rescue!

We were about a mile from this place, and a 4.5 star average?  We can't lose.  And we definitely did not.  We started off by sharing the seafood tom yum soup, which was delicious.  It had shrimps, mussels, squid, and fish balls.  We ordered it medium, but would have definitely been ok with mild, as we were all dripping in sweat by the time we took our 2nd and 3rd bites.  For my entree, I went with the green curry with shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp, but the food itself was very well prepared and tasted great.  

Other entrees on my table were pad thai, 5 spiced (?) salmon, and some other fried red curry salmon.  It was meat-less friday remember?  haha  All of us had nothing but positives to say about our dishes.  And, all the dishes were less than $10.  Score!

The service here is excellent as well.  Seeing our sweat soaked faces, the waitresses were quick to refill our waters and even put the fan next to us.  Lol.  I have never been anywhere that would actually do that for you.  haha

Parking is a bit weird here.  I did not see a parking lot, except for the one across the street, so we had to play frogger in Las Vegas chinatown, which was another adventure in itself.

I had no qualms about the service.  We were seated right away (5).  They checked in often and our cups never went empty.  

So, the two stars is strictly for the food.  What we had:

- pot stickers - The sauce (mayo mix and something else) was sweet.  I'm not a girl that like sweet sauces on her pot stickers.  I like a little tang to it.
- beef noodle soup - I thought this had a bit of a sweet flavoring to it as well.  It was merely ok.
- duck fried rice with pineapples - ok
- pork fried rice with Chinese sausage - I've never had Chinese sausage before so I wasn't expecting the sweetness.
- chopped chicken w/sticky rice and papaya salad - rice was hard and papaya salad's fish sauce was a little too much for me
- chicken satay on a stick - ok

I'm not a girl that likes her meats or soups sweet.  So, forgive me if these dishes are supposed to be that way.  This place wasn't my cup of tea.

I'll try to fit in all I can muster about my favorite China Town area restaurant.

My mom's Thai and a really good home cook. But since we're all grown now, she doesn't make huge family style meals anymore. So. This is my go to Thai restaurant.


It's not fancy, it's not over priced, it's not a new take on Thai. It's pretty much the classics done simply and executed well. Plus the price is definitely right. I'm pretty sure nothing is over $10..I think.. Well..  maybe! If you do seafood it might be.

My favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers:

Noodle house style pot stickers are always a good start.

Noodle house Tom yum soup with choice of noodles which I get the fat noodles- spice a 10.

My favorites include: Roasted duck curry 75% of the time, duck Fried rice(ask for chili in it and it makes it even better), the roasted duck soup with egg noodles, fried chicken over fried rice, BBQ park and Chinese sausage fried rice, lad nah, grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice, their version of pho lol, Tom kah kai, and pretty much everything on their menu.

It's all really good.

My only let down was the pork wonton soup I got tonight with egg noodles. Fresh, but a  pretty bland broth.

A huge plus is they can make their papaya salad LAOS style, which I prefer, and it's actually really good :] 

With Ling Ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment, this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me. 

Idk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet. If I don't finish something for ANY reason I.e. Being full or saving for later.. The Ling Ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if I need it replaced if I may not have liked it. So nice :]

It's tiny so expect a tiny wait at times, the food is worth it, and try not to sit in that center table when it's sunny..

Random thought:

My favorite thing about eating a Thai meal is that it's usually family style. I wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes.. If that makes any sense :] but I'm sure there's a reason they dont offer that. Limited table space..?",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,5,5,pAd5oQxJRyylXCU715ALAw

I enjoyed a late dinner at Thai Style Noodle House tonight with a group of 7. We actually had a ~10 minute wait, which turned out to be a good omen (as it usually is). We ate family-style and were keen on trying a lot of different dishes, including the mythical duck fried rice that my friend had recommended. Unfortunately, they had ran out of duck, which was quite disappointing at the time. After making some substitutions, we got to work on the meal.

Pad thai w/ shrimp ($7.95): it's pretty similar to every other good pad thai that I've had. It's savory and sweet. There are a lot of bean sprouts on the side.

Pad see-eu w/ combination meat ($8.95): as good as any pad see-eu (spelling variations included), with a few different meats that were all tasty, and a nice Chinese broccoli.

Three flavor grill salmon ($8.95): I haven't seen this before, but it's surprisingly good. There's also ground meat and shrimp with this, and it's largely savory. It's served with rice to help soak up all the great sauce.

BBQ pork & Chinese sausages fried rice ($7.25): another delicious order. Heavily Chinese-influenced, especially in the featured meats.

Tom yum soup w/ seafood ($7.95): not as sour as some versions that I've had, which I appreciate. Various seafood items, mushroom, tomatoes, and veggies fill the bowl. It is possibly a feat for one person even at a moderately sour level, but it is definitely a treat for a group to share.

Panang curry w/ chicken ($6.95): despite being ordered as a 3, it seemed more like a 4 or 5 to me. Maybe the inclusion of the spicy peppers did it. It's a rich curry that's maybe just a tad salty, but the rice helped to moderate that flavor.

I really couldn't find any fault with the food, and the service was solid too. The only real annoyance (aside from the 86'd duck) tonight was the smell of dishwashing. I probably sat the closest to the back area, and it was a bit annoying. Luckily, it went away before our food arrived, but it could've been worse.

There might be another hot Thai restaurant around the corner (almost literally), but Thai Style Noodle House hit the spot for me and my group.

- Curry - traditional and new wave selections, and very good!
- Thai Iced Tea - not only is it very good, but they offer an XL size for the inner fat kid.

I dunno - food was delish and warm. Kind of like a warm, nurturing hug after wild nights tearing up Vegas. Such greatness.",SCPgLdL2hoeP3Plnc0dkzg,2,2,5,EOm-cIiMgV3_efQjIMZL4g

*Duck pad thai: this looked yummy when it arrived and was even better than it looked!! how is it that just in look it was more authentic than any other pad thai i've ever had?! So much flavor and a LOT of duck.  So GOOD!
*Pad See Ew: fiance loves this dish so he wanted to try it here.  WIN! he LOVED it!  he's a big eater and yet there was still leftovers, insane!
*Cant remember the name of this dish...It was Hoy something...Mussel and seafood pancake: this thing was ENORMOUS!! we almost ordered 2 since the pic didnt look that big but we figured we'll get 1 and just try it out first.  It came out and wow, HUGE!  Crispy outside, doughy goodness inside with lots of mussels and seafood.  This was a hit with our entire table.  Absolutely worth the guilt of eating something fried that's this big, but mmmm DELICIOUS.

The food itself always reminds me of food my mother makes and it's great to a place that isn't too costly and gives great sized portions. 

Anyway, on October 15, 2016 I went to the establishment with my girlfriend, her father and her little brother for dinner. 

The food was wonderful as always, but toward the end of our meal I had ordered a to-go order of Pad See Ew and Chicken Larb at 7:45pm. 

Right before I put in that order a party of 9 had just arrived arrived. I ordered my food before they even sat down. 

At 8:05pm I ask the lady how much longer for my food, and she had said it's on its way. 

8:15am comes around and I ask her again, and while walking away from me she says ""it's coming"" 

To me, I was just wondering why a basic two dish to-go order was already taking up-wards of 30 minutes to come. 

8:20pm comes along and they bring out two items to the party of 9. At that point I had asked the lady one more time and she flat out walked away from me and had not given me an answer. This whole time I was keeping my cool, but at this moment I couldn't take it any longer. 

So I stand up and wait right where the cash register is. And finally at 8:25pm they finally arrive with my food. And she just hands it to me and doesn't say anything like sorry for the wait or have a good night or anything. 

To me it was an absolute pathetic display of costumer service. Waiting 40 minutes for two simple items. Love this place but that left a bad taste in my mouth.",B99p1hnRMogBVRFNdSxf8g,0,1,1,Ia0yA7nzxnVU2aBAneyrFA

Cheap and delicious, with arguably the best curry I've ever tasted (and I've been to Thailand). THIS IS THE BRANCH TO GO TO-- DO NOT GO TO THE ONE ON FORT APACHE. While the one on Fort Apache is the same owner, it's not the same chef and the food DOES NOT taste the same. This is the original branch and the cooking is SUPERIOR.

This is a hole in the wall Thai restaurant that's authentic to the point you can see a Thai grandma in the kitchen whipping up your dishes. Everything is so frigging cheap ($5-7 a plate) so I recommend you come with friends so you can eat family style and try a little bit of everything. 

The interior of the restaurant is ghetto, so ghetto that I have to warn people ahead of time and assure them that the food is worth it. This is a place you come strictly for flavor.

Things to order:
Duck curry - slices of duck in a red curry served with a side of white rice. Delicious. Amazing. This dish makes me so sad I live in Los Angeles. The curry is rich and flavorful, the slices of duck are juicy and tender, and it all just melts so well in your mouth. It's a mouthgasm.

The pineapple fried rice- HUGE chunks of pineapple and whatever meat you choose (I like chicken with this dish). It's prepared correctly in that the rice isn't dry. This dish has nuts in it so if you're allergic, beware.

The pad see ew - It's a bit sweeter here than in other places, but I prefer that. I choose beef. Once again, it's done well.

The pad thai - Delicious.

Get my drift? Parking is plentiful, and the service is just fine (cute thai ladies who can't speak English well)

We ordered, ate and paid in about 35- 40 minutes and the restaurant was full at the time. Can't wait to come back, this restaurant is surely a new favorite.

Buffets are great for dinner or breakfast, but for that other meal of the day or when you are worn out from exclusively eating the priciest food items to recoup buffet cost, this is the place to hit up.

Finding the location is a little tough and parking can be even tougher during noon time, so aim to eat a little off the rush time. The parking lot on that strip is also rather cut throat, so expect some near misses. The seating is also limited so expect to stand outside if you have a large party or during a meal rush. The interior is not lavish by any means, but it seemed to be somewhat upgraded the last time I went. 

Our favorites include the green papaya salad, tom yum soup, duck noodle soup, and any of the noodle dishes. One fun highlight is that noodle dishes can be made with duck meat, which is not a feature you'll find at many other places. The restaurant leery Chinese in-laws manage to down a large quantity of food here, which says a lot. As others have advised, this place takes requests for the food to be spicy seriously. If you are borderline in how much you enjoy mouth burning, go down one level from what you would request at other places for your first visit. 

There are Chinese menu items, but we haven't tried any of them. Really I don't see a need for these items since the Thai is so good, but they might make someone who is Thai averse comfortable eating here. 

As a side tip, for Vegas people on a budget, after eating here walk down the strip and you'll find a bakery to buy Asian style breakfast buns for the next day.",_6NrKgCZbJ0LBKw5-ukgDA,2,1,5,rBPNqliTISi0SRx7SYPMQw

Like anyone who likes thai food and is rather basic lol, I always get the pad thai with steamed tofu. Prices are super reasonable (entrees ranging from $6.95-8.95) and portion sizes are big as well. Their serving sizes can feed about two people but I definitely recommend doing family style and just ordering a lot of entrees and sharing. There's so much to order so you can't go wrong there. Other than pad thai, I usually get their green and yellow curry with either chicken or pork and brown rice. Most of their dishes give you the option of your choice of protein which can range from shrimp, chicken, pork, steamed/fried tofu, beef. I like their pad see ew but it can be a little too salty but it's been different everytime I've ordered it. If you're sick, I definitely recommend their Tom Kha or their silver noodle soup which is a bit simpler but still good. Their thai tea isn't overbearing (too sweet) compared to boba shops. 


Only huge downside to this place is that the workers here can be pretty rude or come off really cold and mean. It's honestly just a hit or miss though. A couple ladies that work there have been sweet and provide really good service but most of the time, they are pretty rude and give you attitude. I wasn't sure if I was the only one who noticed it but a couple of my friends who ordered pick up and dined in found the workers to be rude too. That's the only downside I can think of. It's not something they can exactly control but it sort of just kills the mood when you're trying to enjoy the food and ruins the atmosphere a little.

My new favorite place to eat there is the discreet Thai Style Noodle House located adjacent to the large Chinatown plaza on Wynn Road (a second location on Ft. Apache and Trop opened last year). Not only does it offer some of the best Thai food in Vegas, but the prices are unbeatable.

There isn't much of an ambience, but I like that quality in my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants. And hole in the wall this is. They aren't bringing in drive by traffic, the signage isn't great, and you park in the delivery alley, but the crowd packed in (and sometimes waiting) at lunch speaks volumes of the food and value.

The chicken larb, my husband's favorite, is top notch ($6.95). It wan't served traditionally with a cabbage wedge, but rather with chopped iceberg. Though this is a little unconventional, I liked the salad quality of the dish. The green curry fried rice ($7.95) is filled with fresh veggies and tender slices of pork, and has a slightly creamy quality. If there was risotto in Thailand, this would be it. I also enjoyed the Choo Chee Shrimp ($8.95) and Spicy Green Beans with silky chicken ($6.75). The Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) had an exotic favor sweetened by spices, though the beef itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked.

Everything on the menu is so inexpensive you won't worry about looking at the lunch special menu, but if you are dining alone or just not a ""sharing"" kind of eater, these options will allow you to try several different item combinations for under $7.

Downside: If the place is very busy, it takes awhile to get your food. The servers are attentive and polite, however, so there is comfort in knowing it isn't taking forever because the staff is slacking off.

It was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.

We ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.  

The chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested ""medium"" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food. 

My bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they ""flavor"" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.

I ordered yellow curry with Tofu (you can choose fried or steamed) and the waiter asked me if I wanted fish sauce which I really appreciate since I am vegan. Also he asked me how spicy I wanted it , from 1-10, I said ZERO Lol and it still was a little too spicy for me, but nothing crazy. Other than that, food was delicious! My bf ordered green curry with shrimp, and he said it was delicious also. I liked that they don't charge extra for shrimp like other places. Price was very fair, $17 for 2 people.

Cons:
I tried #16 grilled Chicken or Beef salad with lime dressing...it was tasty but way too salty BOTh times! Pad thai..well...what can I say, I've had better..but it was decent.  

Overall, it was okay.  I would come eat here again if friends want but when i think of Thai food, I don't think of this place.  That says a lot unfortunately.

This restaurant is in an awkward corner behind a long strip mall. Parking is widely available during lunch time.

We were seated immediately and ordered the recommended Duck Fried Rice and also a dish called Khua-kai (pan fried rice noodles). The Duck Fried Rice had great flavor but the rice was too soft for fried rice. Fried rice should be cooked with leftover drive that has been partially dried out. I believe they used new rice, and that caused the entire dish to be a bit too soft for my liking. The Khua-kai was dry and bland, and I didn't really understand the concept or purpose of that dish.

I think that it has gone down over the times I've gone there (maybe 5-6 times already).

spicy basil fried rice is super yummy, i got it with chicken.
i also got a spicy rice noodle plate that is similar to the pad kee mao, which is usually my favorite thai noodle dish, and it was alright...could be spicier.

their spice level ranges from 1-10 and i order a 7 for everything.

their thai tea is probably the most amazing thai tea i have ever had, they give you a HUGE cup if you order a large. (feeds probably three people but i am a fatass)

Important note: do no use google maps to find this place, because you will end up at a XXX bookstore.  Which is cool if you need some porn to read over lunch, I guess, but annoying if you're just hungry.  The map shown here is correct (why didn't I just trust Yelp??) - it's two doors down from Veggie Delight.

So, yes, they are very accommodating with the vegetarian/vegan requests and happy to oblige.  I went at lunch, but ordered off the dinner menu.  Now, this may have been a mistake simply because they have an awesome lunch special! You can choose an appetizer (fried tofu, soup, or spring roll, I believe - the fried tofu looked awesome!) and one entree (~$5.45) or two (~$7.25).  That's a lot of food for cheap!

We shared a papaya salad, green curry with tofu and vegetables, and chili basil fried rice with tofu and veg.  We ordered everything a 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was perfect (I do like pretty spicy food!).  First, let me give these folks some love for NOT putting the much-maligned baby corn in any of our food.  The mere appearance of those mutants is always a buzzkill when I'm about to dig into a dish.  Second, the portions were very generous.  I'm a hearty eater as is my friend, and we had enough leftovers for at least one of us to stuff ourselves again.  Third, everything was very tasty.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but delicious enough for me to eat til I hurt.  Four, the prices! Cheeeeeaaaaaaaap! $6.95 for a huge entree? yes please!

I looked all over for my review of the place confirming whether or not I had been, and lo and behold, I find it in my ""Unfinished Reviews"" section.  So, here it is...finally.

Thai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.

* Beef / Pork Jerky ""Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried"" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)

* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad ""Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing."" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.

* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup ""Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth."" ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.

* Pad See-eu ""Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce."" ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.

* Red Curry ""Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice."" ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.

We also had Thai iced teas all around.

* Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)

* Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.

Things I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.

Service - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.

3.5 stars

(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.  But since I've been having them at their Fort Apache location, I can definitely say their curries are yum!)",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,15,12,4,RRU7qFLdX73K897TWpeiEA

I think that their dishes are very homestyle:  The Panang and Veggie green curries are reminiscent of that from a can that I can make at home.  Their soup that comes with the lunch special however, is spectacular- No MSG and sweet from overloading of chicken and veggies.

It was small and pretty busy when we walked in. The people there were pretty friendly and I tried to order what got the most press on Yelp.

My wife thought the pad thai was pretty good, but I got the crab fried rice and it lacked a bit of taste. I put a ton of hot sauce on it and it killed my appetite because I was starving, but I wasn't impressed. 

The mango sticky rice was pretty good. The rice was salty and the mango was sweet. This was the request of my wife's so I honored it. It wasn't bad and the prices were decent based on what you got, but I can't give it 4 stars because of taste.

It is a good find and maybe if I got something else I would be happier. They feature the hot soup, but when it's 115 degrees outside soup is the last thing you want.",Rjd9Td7yYOqu0A1e2KDAyA,1,0,3,qI1-BXcLrvTB5NVt-B4VQA

However, the food was outstanding! I ordered the Tom Yum with the assortment of meats. I was asked how hot I would like it between 1-10. I said 6 because I didn't want anything too powerful, but I am one who usually doesn't shy away from spicy. It was maybe a notch below where I'd like it, but after eating all the soup it was certainly enough.

I haven't been here in years. There's other Thai in the area I usually hit up and if I want to eat at TSNH, there are other locations closer to home. It seemed they painted and it looks cleaner in here than what I remember. 

We started with a appetizer of potstickers. It's standard potstickers, but good. They do a trio of sauces swirled on it, not the typical soy based sauce. 

I got a rice plate of spicy thai basil with pork at a 6 level which wasn't that spicy so I doused it with hot sauce. I like my spicy, Thai level spicy and since I haven't been here in a while, I wanted to go middle of the road to gauge it. Still the flavor of it was good though.

Scott got red curry I believe with chicken and I took a bite and it was rather good. It was oddly more spicy than mine even though he got less spice level.

Service was decent enough. My water was refilled which is appreciated in this crazy heatwave. 

For a appetizer, 2 entrees and a drink for $22, this is some cheap eats. Definitely the prices are great since most is about $7. I don't think the quality suffers from it either as both entrees had food flavor and a decent amount of food.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,5,4,-stXLgbqD1t8Kr0jyOckNA

Komol: Homey, good for dinner with friends, nice atmosphere
Archi's: Americanized style stuff
Thai Style Noodle House: The perfect affordable lunch spot
Lotus of Siam: Gourmet all the way !!

Comparing this place to Lotus is comparing apples to oranges. Ok, so they are both Thai but this is like comparing In n Out to the $20 ribeye burger at Bradley Ogden. For some of the best Thai food in the United States - try Lotus (think James Beard nomination! If you don't know what James Beard is, don't waste the time/money to dine at Lotus). For a great hole in the wall spot that won't let you down, Thai Noodle House is fabulous !

Thai Iced Tea : The best rendition I've ever had. At $1.99, a killer deal.

Duck Curry: A bit thin for my taste, but the duck was high quality and really yummy !!

Fried rice with Chinese Sausage + bbq pork: well I guess this is more Chinese (they do call themselves Thai + Chinese after all), but regardless, it was delish

PANANG CURRY WITH AVOCADO: This probably isn't authentic.. at all.. but WOW best curry I've had in my life. Honestly. I would put this up against tri color curry from mix zone any day. I will eat here over and over again for this freaking magical stuff ! Creamy, thick, delicious. Now that I've had it I think all curry should come with avocado!!

Average: 3 stars. Seems a little unfair because I loved the food that I got here! The law of small numbers sucks and that's math for you.

Okay so upon walking in, you can see clearly that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it.

 I had the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup, my friends had a Combo Beef Noodle Soup and Chicken and Shrimp Silver Noodles.  For an appetizer we had Fried Tofu and we each had Iced Coffee.  The Iced Coffee was probably the best part of the meal (unfortunately).  The Fried Tofu was just ok...had much better from other places,  It was a little hard and not smooth and soft.  My Roasted Duck Noodle Soup was ok...tasted like it had a lot of MSG in it though.  My other friend said his Combo Beef Noodle Soup was ok, but it didn't have enough beef.  And my second friend was a bit disappointed with his meal...the chicken was kind of bland and the dish itself wasn't too flavorful.

We ordered a papaya salad, pad Thai, pad see ew, and beef jerky. The papaya salad had all the flavors I love - fish sauce, lime, chili, etc. and had just the slightest bit of a kick to it. It paired really well with the beef jerky, which was a mix of sweet and salty with just the right amount of chewiness. Both dipping sauces for the beef jerky were good, too. The pad see ew was one of the best I've ever had. The beef was tender, the broccoli still had some crunch, noodles were nice and chewy like they should be and the sauce had a nice balance of the sweet and salty, too. The pad Thai was delicious. The sauce was tangy and flavorful and there was plenty of it so the noodles weren't dry. A must order!

The place was pretty stuffy inside and the smell of the chili's cooking made its way out to the dining area, which made a few folks (and staff) cough a bit. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Would come back again.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,0,0,4,eULMWa5oBqp4ilodZMBMPg

Last week I decided to give it another shot and ordered two other Yelp review favorites, the Papaya Salad and Duck Fried Rice.  My thought was I'd counter the unhealthy fried rice with the papaya salad and maybe eat half of each.   The best laid plans of mice and fat men....

Went and picked them up (service both times seemed a little rushed, but not unfriendly).   Prices are pretty standard. 

 Upon getting back to my office I went for the salad first.  I thought it looked really nice, but I didn't enjoy the flavor at all.  Now it must be said for the 50th time how much I typically do not like salad so maybe it's personal, but I found the bean sprouts in particular to have that dirt taste that they sometimes get.   Or is this the way bean sprouts are supposed to taste?  I love them cooked usually, but maybe raw they taste like dirt.  I didn't get any sweetness from the papaya and I ordered a 7/10 and wasn't getting much spice either.  Maybe I was eating it wrong.  Either way, YELP YOU FAILED ME ON THIS ONE.

But redemption comes in the form of Duck Fried Rice.  Holy Moly.  Toss that silly salad aside and dig in.  Now it doesnt seem too complicated:  take greasy fried rice, add a healthy amount of unhealthy, fatty duck and voila!  A star is born and a salad is forgotten.   Yeah that half and half plan earlier?  Chucked it in the trash along with the salad, and devoured the entire box of fried rice.  Cancel Dr's appointment for tomorrow and call it a day.

Duck fried rice - 5 stars.  Papaya salad - 1 star.   5+1/2 = 3.   I can do Arithmetic like Bill Clinton.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,0,0,3,vI2ma_FZ27C2NlKqohGETg

However, I have to say it's probably some of the worst Thai food I've had.  Maybe I just ordered wrong, I dunno.

Considering how many other Thai places are here in Vegas... more than you could shake a stick at.  I don't know what kind of metric that is really, is that like 15 Thai places?  I don't know how many places the average person could shake a stick at in, say, an evening..

But anyway,  I tried the Tom Yum that people have been raving about and I couldn't even eat it, I thought it was awful.  The Won Ton soup was also weak but I at least could deal with it. 

I got some noodles too and they were decent, but the Pad Thai was pretty lame too.

All told, I may very well order again because it's so cheap and convenient for delivery, but I'd rather go elsewhere. :/",jJ_H9Hdw_Ao4OpDLNAG7Ig,0,0,2,4SN_D0nNdkff9CVelaDT-Q

But my Rad-Na had no meat at all.  I called the restaurant and told them I had no meat in my order.

We got there and it is busy as usual since it was lunch time. Servers seemed stressed and distracted, but I won't rail them for that. We sat down and got our menus and it took forever to take our order (10-15 min). We ordered a Tom yum noodle soup and sticky rice. Note that we came in first and got our order down first in front of three other groups who sat down after us, yet they got their food first and ours arrived last after 10-15 min. Maybe they treat their regulars or Thai people better??? 

So my Tom yum noodle soup was just what I expected, but the sticky rice was horrible. First of all sticky rice should be soft and easily chewable, but our sticky rice was hard to chew and majority of it still had rice uncooked!! Raw rice in our dessert? Wtf! So my gf went to the cashier to ask about it, and her response was ""no that's how it is supposed to be"" in a rude tone. I'm sorry, but we have had sticky rice from many Thai places and I have friends who are Thai that I have asked and they all say that it is not supposed to be raw!

Tom Young Soup: Not a big fan, but friend said it was very good! I tried a taste of it for the first time and it wasn't for me. It did have a good balance of sour and not sour though.

Spicy Flat Noodles: It was I expected, but very good! Flat noodles are by far my favorite kind of noodle.

Duck Fried Rice: I wanted to soooo badly love this dish, but it was just too sweet for me. It was cooked with pineapple, and the duck they added was fatty. By no means does fatty mean bad, but it's not for everyone. Wouldn't order this one again.

We initially went to Pam Real Thai just a mile over based on the review.  Looked really interesting, but alas, it was closed because they were only open for dinner.  So we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to head over.  First impression good, there were a couple of party waiting outside for a table for this small joint.  About 100 degrees outside so not too pleasant, but looking forward to the food.  We put our name in for 2, but there was a party of 9 in front that they said would need to be seated first.  No problem.  We wait about 10 minutes, and the big party goes in to get seated.  In the meantime there were a couple other small parties that came around, but we didn't pay attention too much.  Another big party of 8 comes, puts their name in, and waits.  10 minutes or so later, the party of 8 goes in!  I go inside to check out what's going on, and the small parties that came after us are also seated already!  So I go over to the counter and ask them when we were going to get seated, they look at the ""wait list"" and our name is still on it, with people below us crossed out!  What the heck?  They realize, say ""oh"", and says, ""sit over there"" and points to the empty table.  No apologies, just a point of a finger.  Man, food must be really good here to tolerate this, I thought.  We later witness that there is another party getting a similar treatment so notching this one as an inefficient system that has got to get fixed.

Service does not improve as the meal goes on, however.  We flag the server down to order our drinks and food, never got served water, and they never checked up on us for the meal.  Onto the meal.  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee (no difference as Vietnamese one), Yellow Curry, and Spicy Fried Rice.  In general, everything was good.  But both the curry and rice was too salty.  The dishes were plain, no garnishments, and smaller in size to justify the cheaper price.  So not necessarily a bargain.  Tea was good, no complaints, coffee was typical.  So overall 3-stars for the meal.  If it wasn't so salty, the curry would have been great.

So throughout the meal, the servers never approached us, we called them EVERY TIME.  To order, to ask for anything, to ask for the check.  That gets a zero in my book and I let the tip speak for that.  I pay for the food, I tip for the service.  Servers should always remember that, I don't care what you get paid.

I'm always searching for new hot spots. I was craving pad thai... my new found love... and came across TSNH.

First off... I love the location since I live right up the road and it's in between my commute to work and home. 
I'm all about reasonable prices! My meal was under $10. 
The portions were big... I ended up taking home half of my meal.
I went around 9pm and my fellow yelp las vegas elite/friend and we were the only ones there... so seating and waiting for our order wasn't an issue.

Cute hole in the wall... casual indoor seating.

Only thing I wasn't a fan about was their angel hair noodles. Pad thai noodles are usually bigger in size. Taste was decent but I've had better pad thai here in Vegas.

Would I come back? sure! If not for the pad thai... I wanna try their thai fried rice with chicken (since pad thai and fried rice with chicken are my only thai things I like).

The one star is for the poor customer service, the food is nothing exceptional. The first thing you notice when you walk in us that is smells like bad breath! Eeeew! Should have been our first red flag!

We were a party of four on a Thursday afternoon and the place is small and crowded. Waited for a hostess to seat us and was told 10 minutes to wait for a table when they clearly had a clean table for four ready in the back corner. It was very awkward standing in the doorway as people came in and others left. A waitress gave us menus to look at while we stood in the entry way. About the same time a single man (who came in after us) was seated at the table for four that I mentioned earlier. WTF. Really?!?! 

We waited and were finally seated. The menu was greasy and had lots of misprints and old prices scribbled out with new prices written in. Not very professional or appetizing. 

The waitress was rude, slow and acted like our request for a side dish and chop sticks was a big inconvenience. The food was basic and boring. No real flavor. Who the hell serves mayonnaise on potstickers??? The Pad Thai was a small portion and half of my plate was just a huge handful of bean sprouts. The dish does not come with rice here, like it does in every other Thai restaurant in the world. Skimpy. 

I do not recommend this place to anyone based off of my experience today. We won't be back. So many other places nearby that truly respect their customers and deserve repeat business! Yuck!",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,0,1,1,GHZQo5-Xx3G9IM8dCZfAAA

Came here after a long day of hiking, and boy did the food really hit the spot as far as healthy and energizing goes! Their menu is colorful with a lot of variety of foods that are vegan/vegetarian friendly, or otherwise tasty and nutritious in its own way.

Heed warning to the level of spiciness they ask you (which can be found throughout many other reviews here too!) I learned my lesson with the papaya salad that medium is blazing hot in Thailand's culture. Despite how delicious the papaya salad was prepared, not even halfway through my taste buds were on fire and my lips were feeling like they were seared off! Lesson learned with that, but the papaya salad was still fabulous, as well as the pot-stickers (the sauces really compliment the appetizer just right!)

My favorites were the Red Curry Chicken and the Thai Tea. The Thai Tea is a MONSTER, they serve it to you in a huge mug and if your food has a little kick, the Thai Tea is actually a good remedy to cool down your taste buds!

I'm totally down with any restaurant that has an extra complete vegan/vegetarian menu, so they get an extra star just for that. 

I got the spicy thai basil and asked for extra carrots and it didn't seem to have much more, but the dish was good nonetheless. Yummy sauce.

My bf got the jung pao tofu and the sauce was incredible. Luckily he doesn't like onions so I ate them all and even snuck in a piece of tofu that was really yummy. 

For dessert I usually get mangoes with sticky rice, but this time we went for the fried bananas; a little too greasy for my taste, but wonderfully paired with the ice cream and honey.

This is a no frills Thai food restaurant, that is decorated with t-shirts sold to tourists visiting Thailand.

The food served here is not refined, but is delicious and comforting. I would describe it as the food one might expect to be served, when tagging along with their new college freshmen best dorm buddy (who is Thai, instead of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese ones I actually met back in college) going home for the weekend, with or without the nearly obligatory 2-weeks worth of laundry for mommy to wash.

The service here is excellent when we visited this past Sunday.  It wasn't too busy when we arrived, and the waitress took her time to recommend the various dishes in each section of the menu to try, plus the specials they have posted on the wall by the t-shirts.  I opted for the Chicken Khua-Kai Rice Noodles (even though I really wanted to try their Pad Se Ew) and the portion was decent, and it hits the spot. My friend ordered the Yellow Curry (I like the flavor of the curry and it wasn't too spicy and will probably try it on my own in a future visit).  We also shared the Fried Shrimp Rolls appetizer, that came out piping hot with the Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce, I didn't really care for this appetizer and will probably not try it again in the future.

Price-wise I was expecting it to be a little less, but I am sure their rent is not cheap, and they must charge enough to make it worthwhile to stay and run their business and continue to serve comforting Thai family cooking to locals and out of town guests.

My rating thus far is 3.6 stars (rounding up to a 4).

P.S.  Now that it is summer, I wonder if they have the traditional sticky rice with mango dessert?  Man I love those!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,5,4,h2-eEaMnkZJPVof5ZPBPcw

stumbled on this place quite by accident. (kind of. used yelp to find it after realizing a place my friend wanted to go was closed.)

ATMOSPHERE. it's kind of hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. passed right by it because it's on the side of the strip mall. once inside, expect -super cramped- quarters. basically, you might be bumping elbows maneuvering your chopsticks with the patron next to you. hope you showered today.

CUISINE. hella goodness. hella goodness. i've only been once and didn't try to cram my face full of everything. everything we had was good though. when they say thai hot, they mean thai hot. it goes on a scale of 1-10. i imagine 10 means it chemically removes the roof of your mouth since 7 was so hot my friend was pouring out electrolytes.

PRICE. woah. it's unbelievably affordable. two dishes and a drink -- with a generous tip = $20. you can tell it's affordable. there are like... broke kids in there on dates -- not dutch either.

SERVICE. since the place has limited seating, the service is actually quite good. they're fast. you order; it shows up. you're practically sitting in the kitchen so they don't have far to go.
