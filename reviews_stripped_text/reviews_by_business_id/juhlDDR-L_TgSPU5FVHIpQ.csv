The food, while authentic, was atrocious.  

Both the chicken and beef dishes had a very heavy, less-than-fresh odor and taste to them.  These were not meats they should have been serving.   

As I said initially, the service was excellent.  It's definitely a family run joint, and they were so kind that we didn't have the heart to tell them the food was rank.  We politely pretended we were stuffed and asked them to box the rest of our food to-go.   And promptly ditched it in the trash can once we were out the door.

I would have loved to recommend this place, as Las Vegas is definitely in need of some genuine, authentic middle eastern cuisine -- but do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.",1i8fCfSTGfvZeWdz03-CQQ,2,0,1,X6PIxl7TpgqSuK-dtGIHQg

The location is across the street of the W. Charleston campus. They replaced the Brazilian BBQ Grill place that had horrible customer service which prompted me not to eat there.

Combo Kebab Plate:
Beef, Chicken, & Beef Lule served on a bed of rice with side salad and some kind of seasoned thinly sliced onions

There's an option to get either rice of burgul pilaf. The chef gave me a sample of the pilaf and...WOW that was different. The best way i can describe it is: Bomb Ass Brown Rice. The seasonings used were overwhelming enough to mask the brown rice taste but mind enough to not be overwhelming. There were also some noodle things i couldnt identify, they could have been noodles but what ever this stuff was gooooooooddddddddd.

The chicken and the beef could have been marinated longer and could have been a bit more juicy but i'm not going to hold it against them. They just opened and their target market are college students. Seeing as the semester hasnt started yet and they're still in the planning phase.

The Beef Lule (they call 'em 'Lula' @ Shish Kebab House) was something else. They are the complete polar opposite of Shish Kebab House. Where as SKH is a bit bland and is too soft with almost no texture, Joseph's is full of herbs and has a noticeable flavor as well as a chewy meaty texture from not being too ground.

There are a few things they need to do to attract more business.

The first being to beef up the lunch specials. Right now there's only 4 specials, 8 if you count the different types of meats you can get. 

The second is taking the frequent diner card back to the drawing board. You get a punch for every 10 dollars you spend and after 10 punches (100+ dollars sent) you get 10 dollars off your next meal. This seems alright but not everyone at CSN can afford 10 bucks for lunch sometimes. The lunch specials are 6.99 and you get a free soda but that's not gonna cut the 10 dollar mark to get a punch. Perhaps a 6 or 7 times and get a meal half off or buy one meal and get the second half off. Having a 10 dollar minimum when the specials dont meet it isnt exactly the best way to guarantee return customers

The third would be the prices. Everything is priced properly for a proper fine dining experience. The location and the targeted clientele arent going to frequent this place for fine dining but tasty fast food in between classes. Prices need to be rethought to fit their target market and situation.

Hopefully this place will last longer and have more business than the Brazilian place it replaced. 

Most likely i'll return when the semester starts as well as go here during peak lunch hours and see if the quality is consistent when the demand is more fast paced.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,2,0,4,m2H7Gi3zLoMvK7vOaX7Xdw

We just had one of the $7.99 combo plates- it was so much food and very satisfying! I love their gyro plate so far, I am a fan of cracked wheat rice! With the nice student discount I'd be happy to eat here whenever classes are done for the day!",a7Oby4yiZ8wHKvu2zhoC5Q,2,0,5,MRLGQsohWTFEyQCrlg19kA

It is a Mediterranean spot, and their website and menu showcase Greek, Lebanese, and Armenian. 

We had $30 to spend, so we ended up with quite the feast: falafel plate, a large sampler that included falafel, sarma (stuffed grape leaves), boreg (fried cheese), hummus, muhammara (walnut and red pepper dip), a chicken gyro and a mini kebab wrap. Needless to say we had more than enough to eat and didn't need dinner!

The environment is sparse, think high school cafeteria. Given the environment, the prices are a bit more than I expected. They have $7.99 lunch specials that include a drink, but the meal you get is a smaller version of the regular menu item. The service was kind. It appears as if it is a dad and his children running the show. There was an issue regarding our use of the Yelp Deal (but we resolved it), and we think they miscalculated our total, but when we informed him, he simply said, ""It's what the cash register said."" We just let it go. 

The falafel were fresh and crunchy, but I wasn't a fan of the flavor. I probably wouldn't order them again. However, everything else was tasty. I generally don't enjoy grape leaves, but these had a wonderful flavor. Our favorite was the chicken gyro, which was actually gyro-style chicken in thin slices. The helping of chicken was very generous, and the seasoning of the meat kept us chomping along happily. We would go back for that! And, they have some amazing pickles!

We wanted to try the soups, but they are not making the soups during the summer.

The menu is big and has a lot of dishes I haven't seen elsewhere in Vegas. I would say it's worth a nibble if you are in the area!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,5,3,1pRsvZWQjUWJ7KzF-13-2A
