As we walked to the front counter the manager started to talk to the girl behind the counter about something that had gone wrong and how everyone who worked there was going to pay for it. At this time we're ready to order, but the manager takes the girl behind a wall just so we barely can't see them anymore and continues to yell and curse at her. We decided to eat at the place next door. And as we're opening the door from the other business he comes running out of the door asking us if we were sure we didn't want anything to eat there. He knew we were there, he held the door open when we first came in, so he should have taken care of his customers and then dealt with the issue. His customer service skills were awful and his management skills were far less than professional.",kZPqmJobpP0YDXAMEMhjtQ,1,0,1,43heltYDhqaE7-4nyGAObg

I ordered my food, made small talk with the young man working the cashier, and noticed a few of the staff handling the food with no gloves, touching their hair, scratching their arms, and one was even picking his nose (EW). I observed to see if he'd wash his hands afterwards but he proceeded to wrap food up and hand it to the customers. Anyways, I mention to this to the young man taking my order, and quietly asked him to inform his coworker about changing his sanitary habits. He sighed at me and brought over the manager, who was asking me all kinds of questions about what I saw. I guess the owner happened to be in the store, so the manager brought him over and immediately he started talking down to me. I purposely stayed quiet when I first confronted the cashier to avoid embarrassing the staff member who was picking his nose. The owner told his employee to go wash his hands and then proceeded to raise his voice at me for ""complaining for no reason.""
When I got my food, there was a huge black hair in the hot dog. I ended up complaining about it because I wasn't going to eat from there, I just wanted my money back to go eat elsewhere. The owner came back out, and gave me the hardest time trying to get my money back, so I ended up just leaving, without my money. Horrible, HORRIBLE experience. I don't expect much from fast food, but I definitely do not think that gives fast food workers and owners an excuse to treat their customers like sh*t.",3Q88t3pgsqUcw2wXlJJneQ,2,0,1,6x3lG0-HhdTfliPLtYq5vw

last visit though after ordering I had to answer a phone call so was at the booth on the phone while waiting for the food.  the manager (who took my order) brought my food out to the table, didn't expect that.  it's a fast food restaurant, so little things like that go the extra mile!

2033376,2015-04-09,0,Z4TFS7pnp1p2zExT-uq9AA,"Ah, Wienerschnitzel. You are neither bad nor good. You fit the a-ok category perfectly. I love me some hot dogs. These are a-ok cheap hot dogs. The Angus beef ones are, of course, better than the regular ones. They cost about $0.80 more and are worth the upgrade. You can also upgrade, for about $0.60, to a pretzel bun. The ingredients aren't exactly fresh, so you are better off sticking to the chili cheese dogs than trying to get a Chicago dog or something. Their chili is nothing to write home about, but it's decent hot dog type chili. And really, how can you go wrong with covering like everything in chili and cheese? Hint: Sign up for their email list on their website and get a free chili dog. Their 5 for $5.99 deal is pretty good and will easily fill up a few people. And their new multitude of chili cheese fries are pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the buffalo bacon ones. Plus, they have Tastee Freeze. And they offer Mountain Dew. All in all, it's not a great hot dog. But it's not bad either. This will definitely hit the spot when craving chili cheese dogs. This particular location almost never has a wait at the drive thru.

2547110,2017-08-24,0,Z4TFS7pnp1p2zExT-uq9AA,"I don't know how this place stays open for business. Seriously, my order was simple: two hot dogs, fries, and a Cinnabon dessert. How much trouble can this order be?

The fries had an opaque, raw-potato color, with no ""golden brown and delicious"" look at all. If fact, the fries looked as though they had absorbed the cooking oil, which gave them a glossy look. When you grab some fries to dip them in ketchup, your fingers get covered in cold grease and the fries droop and hang limp from your finger, like an al dente pasta noodle. The fries taste and feel like they were swirled around in two-week-old lukewarm oil to make them hotter than room temperature and ready to serve. Holy smokes! How unappetizing! When I asked my 27yo daughter to try the fries, she said no, the fries are always served like that and she never orders/eats them. Unreal. The hot dogs were generally uneventful, so, we move on to dessert.

The Cinnabon (normally) is a delightful, fluffy little baked treat. The Cinnabon served at this place would probably be fluffy and delicious IF THEY ACTUALLY COOKED THE THING! The dough hadn't even risen, yet. Sitting under the plastic cover of the dish were small lumps of indescribable food stuff covered with cinnamon and liquid sugar - inedible. I would LOVE to meet the owner of this insult to the consumer, so that I might explain what a JOKE the manager of this dump really is. There is no oversight to the production in this place. 

Dessert was not at all dessert, in fact, it was a godsend. This dessert moved me to take the loss and rather than express my disappointment to management, I will simply never return to this disgrace of a restaurant...E.V.E.R!",7tQrgYMNF9wkLEeZZ8r5CA,0,0,1,St5Ep0nut5fX9pC8fhJeog

3059743,2013-11-02,0,Z4TFS7pnp1p2zExT-uq9AA,"I got something from the menu I had never eaten from Wienerschnitzel. A pastrami sandwich. It was not good. I went thru the drive-thru, then got a parking spot to munch down a much needed lunch. 

The first thing I noticed is that it didn't look anything like the photo but what food ever does so I took a bite and said ummmmm in a questioning tone not yummmm in a 'this is delish' tone. I took it back in the store and asked for a refund. The manager was livid. He began to tell me that if everyone brought their food back, that wouldn't be good for his store. I told him that I wasn't going to pay for something that was nasty and that I didn't care about what other people did. He gave me a hard time a few times which was really uncomfortable but  finally gave me back my little $4.31. 

Seriously! Maybe he should have asked if they could make me something else but he chose to take it personal. Oh well. I won't ever be back to this one or any Wienerschnitzel's. I don't spend my money at places that have a problem with refunds. I will be 100% satisfied with ANY and ALL my purchases, or it's going back. Simple as that!

For some reason the transition to cold weather from Hawaii makes me want to eat lots of food probably to add fat for hibernation similar to bears. Anyway, this is another random snack place we decided to eat at.

Drove through and ordered me a chili cheese dog, a chili dog and chili fries for the hubs, and another dog for my mama. How the heck did I not see the 3 chili dogs deal for $3.00?!? I cut my mama off when she mentioned the deal and that's what I get. Brought it home and had a taste of that sodium and fat enriched goodness. Again, I inhaled my chili cheese dog in a couple minutes and tried to picture how it will be when I get back to working out when my vacation's over. Who cares.

This location is by far the best of all the great sanctuaries of the soul we know as ""Weinerschnitzel.""  I've never had a bad visit here, never. And as my waistline can attest there are frequent visits.

The food is always fresh. Frequently I unwrap chili-cheese dogs and have to hold them by the AC vent because it's so hot and fresh.  The drive through service is always awesome. Never a problem, fast and very courteous. GREAT JOB GUYS!

Some people complain about a few of the specialty items. To me this is a non issue because I come here for the dogs, and they are delish! Corn dogs, chili dogs and just plain old dogs... this is my favorite place for them all. And the prices are good too.

There are seriously not enough locations! Get with it, Wienerschnitzel!

My Mom really wanted a polish sandwich (a polish hot dog halved and on rye bread with cheese and a pickel), and luckily I remembered the location on Serene, which isn't TOO far away from us.

They have lots of great specials - cheap chili dogs, corn dogs, family meal deals, etc.  And this location is also a Tastee Freeze, which is cool to know.

The drive thru staff was super friendly.  Also, the car in front of us seemed to be taking awhile to get their food, so the window attendant exited the store to come take our payment.  I thought this was really efficient, so when we got to the window, we could just get our food and go.

The food was delicious, and something different for a change.  I had a corn dog, which was cooked perfectly, and my Mom of course had her desired polish sandwich.

It's a bit out of the way, but when Mom is craving it again, I will be the stellar daughter I am and drive her to get her fix! :)",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,4,ZnGzNljzeHwkOqZdTmXHNw

This has been my go-to hot dog place since college. Their Chili Cheese Dog is, I must confess, an obsession. However, today's experience was dismal. Six cars in the drive through; seven people in line inside; height of lunch hour, and whoever the manager/owner is, they had chosen to schedule only two employees to handle everything. On Labor Day. Working as hard and fast as they could, it still took those two poor kids nearly 20 min to deliver my order. Perhaps management needs to revisit the issue of customer attrition -vs- money saved with a small staff ratios. I guarantee that there was a restaurant full of very unhappy customers today.",XfW_g_DZnOwaJperZXeaag,0,0,2,JtFR_MDEMG02QJ51JjHhKw
