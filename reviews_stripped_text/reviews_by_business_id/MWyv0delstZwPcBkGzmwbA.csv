I tend to judge a bar by it's chicken wings, and they were really good here. The sauces were great (medium was the best) and the portions were generous. The husband loved the chicken tenders. The folks working there were super to us. This little bar also offers live music, karaoke, pool tables and darts. We will be going back without question.",gDk4t78yptRaTsAc1c2_ew,1,1,5,nCwMzUaIPnNXK5IEXpXc6Q

771352,2014-08-23,4,MWyv0delstZwPcBkGzmwbA,"Service was terrible.  I went in tonight to watch a preseason football game. Now for those that may not know, a preseason game doesn't count--which meant that the crowd was small. I sat down at a counter right in front of the biggest TV in the place--which also meant that I was very visible. No servers came by. After about ten minutes, I then walked up to the bar, where two ladies were. I made eye contact, but NEITHER OF THEM EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED ME, much less asked for my order. I then walked back to my spot, and watched the first half. NOT ONE TIME did any server ask for my order the ENTIRE TIME I was watching the game. INEXCUSABLE...I will never return. 

And the ONLY reason I'm giving a 1 star rating is because I have to give at least one.",jvmKUjbMarAMRFoxousQAQ,3,2,1,yfF40pD6EXVI7M4YseJ9BQ

It's very clean and very open. They have a couple pool tables, classic video games, new dart boards, gaming machines on the bar and a stage for live music. They have Karaoke on Thursday nights, live bands on the weekends. The Staff is awesome!! They are great people and super friendly. This is the best spot I found that you can just chill and have fun. Drinks are very reasonable. Bucket of 5 beers for $8, they have some draft beers and great selection of mixed drinks. They had a great food place that closed. They did reopen it and run it themselves now. The menu is simple but very good. That is definitely getting better day by day. This is a must try place. You won't be disappointed. Till next time...Let's Eat!!",sX_PPJHVCo6P0Jbm7jxd6A,3,2,5,7-7pW0HBJrNr9rlKhOR34g

Last Sunday I was at the 100th show celebration for the band Kold Kats, and I had a great time listening to the band and their friends who joined them onstage play some great live music. I look forward to going back on Sunday nights and hearing them play again.",4f5TFZqP0J364MYn8mj9Fg,0,1,5,7MKIycw84OxL2UYyQ0U1Ag

Sure, the portions are huge, but I can't really justify paying that much money for such low quality ingredients and poorly seasoned food.",r-WN5j1_aDk3t1eONH2fGQ,2,1,1,jlFSTyAXT_r8bkqXpHIEVg
3186219,2017-09-25,3,MWyv0delstZwPcBkGzmwbA,"This bar offered a karaoke competition that was in my view, very unfair, prejudiced and biased hosted by Brandi Morales. The only reason it is receiving one star is because zero stars are not offered. The bar needs to support their local patrons. I would like to speak to the manager or the owner about Brandi Morales and her karaoke competition.  She allowed a karaoke jockey (Frankie) a KJ that works part-time at Champagnes Cafe on Maryland Parkway, that has been a professional singer win top prize.  She allowed another man about 3 hours late for the competition to compete even after the judging was closed. Yes, that person also won a top spot.  I need to speak to a manager or owner of this bar.  They need to make it right with their loyal customers that participated.",-K3I3SCFvPS_Aw8B4gBtVQ,0,0,1,Br4-8t_u-mmGWg6hea5u3g

3611299,2013-10-20,0,MWyv0delstZwPcBkGzmwbA,"Interior was revamped ok, nothing spectacular. Bands setup offset, facing away from the bar. This is good and bad, keeping a majority of the loudness away from the Gamers, yet making it tough for most of the bar to see the band.

Very good Domestic Beer prices at $2.50, but the Liquor is another story, with Fireball Shots at $4.50. Higher than probably every bar within 5 miles. Most bars in the SouthEast are prices $3.00-$4.00.

Food is nothing spectacular, mostly frozen/fried appetizers. Jalapenos are fresh but flavor leaves a lot to be desired and with 6 halves on a plate, very over-priced.

Burgers are very small and not even close to worth the $7.00 charged. A $5.00 Burger at best. 

Nachos are typical for a bar and way over-priced at $7.00

Make sure to lock your cars/trucks. Bikers, take your helmets inside as they have been stolen on each of multiple previous visits for multiple friends.",XxyyTYuL7KrrBFg8a14bEA,3,0,3,D5wuIW6byMvsWvEVLmaRxw
3781412,2016-01-31,0,MWyv0delstZwPcBkGzmwbA,"I'm a fan of any dive bar (usually) and this one is no exception. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, I will say that, but once inside, it's all good. Alcohol pricing isn't too bad, pretty typical for a bar of this type. 5 domestic beer bucket is $12, imports were $14, mixed drinks were like $6. A 16 ounce draft beer $3.50. They have some dart boards (not the good kind unfortunately, these are the plastic ones), a few pool tables and live music, which in my book is always worth an extra star. Support local musicians! I didn't eat here so no comment on the food. Staff was a little busy, so a bit of a wait for beer on the night I went. Friendly though, met some cool local yocals. Another plus in my book, although smoking is allowed, it didn't seem smokey nor did I smell like an ashtray when I left.  I'd come back if I had a reason too (like a good band).",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,1,2,4,UUQ-R8DDQd950u9rlJGVmw

Everyone here is so laid back and it totally has that neighborhood bar type of feel. The patrons all the way down to the bartenders are really cool and are like your friends from jump street which makes this place really easy to consider your second home after just your first visit.

They have live music, a jukebox and I am told they have karaoke Thursdays. Don't want to just chill at the bar and drink while shooting the shhhhh, they have two pool tables, a Ms. Pac Man/Galaga machine and this really cool punching bag game! Great way to let out some steam after a long day at work!! Beers are pretty darn cheap in here too, so that's an added plus! I believe they have PBR on tap during Happy Hour for just a buck!!

Make sure you come down and check this place out. It's a pretty mid class place with dive bar prices.....and I love dive bars!!",dnv5UpldAE6UITDcMleLVA,4,3,5,sG-0SAFRwOLo4EYRuXW01g

The both displayed great customer service.  this place when down hill fast and its sad  i hope the owners wake up and see this before its just another failed bar on boulder highway!!!,SxNimvWt08SaUYUTMKZ5cg,0,0,2,g0z_eZtivkxHyrC0NTPpZA

The people are friendly,they have good live music{I saw a now favorite local rock cover band there Friday nite},they have a jukebox and decent prices on mixed drinks. I had some apple martinis. The bartenders are also friendly. I will just say that the older male bartender gave a better price on my apple martinis than a female bartender gave when we went back the second time. But maybe he used cheaper vodka than she did. I would make this a regular stop. I also like the tapestries on the wall behind the stage. They also have some pics of bands on the wall. They have karaoke on Saturday nights,too. We will check that out.",ld0VngIrULSUAuD2D7phAA,1,1,5,ETaUMX4BdYdSFyIrsadrig

Everything was outstanding!  The music was awesome, the drinks were great, the food was great (we had chicken fingers, wings and burgers)  The bartender worked her butt off and always was smiling and pleasant no matter how busy she got.
If you haven't heard of AKA DANGER, the music is all original rock. Edgy lyrics. Great instrumentals.  We saw them at Tommy Rockers a few years ago, when they were called Resurrection LV - they said there was a band name change when they replaced the drummer and bass player.
We've been to Legends before but its been a few years and there have been some improvements.
And one of our friends hit Keno for $200!

These neighborhood bars are usually all the same, gaming and no ambiance. Legends is a different story......You walk in and right away you get treated like family. Within minutes I had an awesome plate of spicy chicken wings in front of my poker machine. The bar tenders really know their drinks too. Just ask for the Cable Car and you'll know what I mean.

Luckily all was good when we left.  The bar itself is a typical dive bar you would expect.  Service is not exceptional.  If you want something go to the bar.  Good was so so.  Ordered the nachos, they were plain nachos nothing to talk about.  They did have pinball and skeeball which was a plus.  Of course classic darts and a pool table.
