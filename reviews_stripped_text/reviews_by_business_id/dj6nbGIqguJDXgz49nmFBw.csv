I've ordered from this location on numerous occasions for delivery and carry out and normally don't have any issues worth mentioning. However, today was different. I used the app to place an order for delivery today around 5pm. The confirmation stated my order should be delivered by 5:40pm. By 6pm, I was still waiting on my delivery. I called the location to check the status and was told the driver left at 5:23 and should be at my place by now or soon. I live very close to this location(4 minute drive according to the Maps App). The delivery guy arrived at 6:10pm with only HALF of my order, which was barely warm at this point. He apologized and said that he would return to the store and have my missing food remade and deliver it fresh, but I never saw him again. I paid for a product that I didn't receive, and the store did not try to correct it. I contacted Pizza Hut's corporate customer service hotline and was only offered vouchers (to be delivered by regular mail) for a free pizza to try to compensate for the error. This was a huge customer service fail. I won't be ordering from this location or possibly any Pizza Hut location anymore.",u3d7tqiK2VHAhXlmO_cVig,0,0,1,92qpgLYNAmGaaYL_erQveg

I chose to order a stuffed crust pizza so it added $2 to my order and my total came out to $9.99. When I went to checkout it said that I couldn't order for delivery because the minimum is $10 and I was a penny short. 

I called the store and at first they said I couldn't order a speciality like stuffed crust and I had to do either pan or hand tossed. That made no sense because my order total would have been even cheaper but I tried anyways and guess what? Same error saying I needed a $10 minimum. Then the person I was speaking to, Agusto, said it was their policy that it had to be $10 for delivery. 

I asked to speak to the assistant manager, Nicole, and she told me the same thing that it was their policy. I asked her why that special was even available online if I couldn't use it and she just kept saying that it was their policy that it had to be $10. I told her if they could deliver I would give her the extra penny to make it $10 but she refused, said I had to order more food, and then hung up on me. She was extremely rude and unprofessional and I sincerely hope she gets reprimanded by the store manager. The funny thing is that this same thing happened once in the past and when I called they promptly said they would deliver and then add the extra penny.

Remember when Pizza Hut was decent? It arrived on time, with a crisp (non-soggy) and tasty crust. The toppings were actually all the way on the pizza and it looked like a human made it. Well, that's not what you get when you order delivery from this location. 

Crust...soggy all the way through and almost burnt on top. (How do you even
do that?!)
Toppings: only 2/3s of the way on the pizza...the other 1/3 was raised, tasteless bread with no texture, no cheese, a little sauce.
Service: hit and miss...at least the drivers are always polite (that's the 1-star)

The sad thing is, when I feel like pizza, I tend to want Pizza Hut (like it used to be)...pan crust, crispy and delicious, flavorful sauce, fresh (non-greasy) toppings...not this gross saturated cardboard you get now.

Second, why is Pizza Hut trying to market this place as a separate entity?  I mean they share the same location, phone number, and workers.  There's no need for the charade.

But the thing is the wings here are pretty good.  I don't know what exactly made them so tasty (I may have been half starved or buzzed or both) but I'll give it to them.  You got your pizza, your brew, and must have the wings to complete the third tier of the ultimate greasy diet. 
Mmmmm grease.

I am not a huge Pizza Hut fan, but it is pretty cheap. After having Rosati's a lot lately, we decided just to throw something different in the mix. A large pizza was less than $10, which was substantially cheaper than the Rosatis's equivalent (as much as I love it).

We ordered online and the pizza was ready right when it was scheduled to be picked up. When I went to pick up the order, the lady working the counter was polite and friendly. I honestly can't believe this is that same place that earned all these scathing reviews! 

As for the pie its self, well, it's a Pizza Hut pizza. It is what it is. It's doughy and thick and always seems to be a bit too greasy. It was alright for a quick fix for our little party for the night. One thing I will give them is that there were copious amounts of toppings on the pie. No skimping out there!

I was undecided between 2 or 3 stars for this review, but for what it is, Pizza Hut is okay. Don't expect to be blown away, but it is cheap pizza.

This can't hold a candle to some of the other Pizza places in the area (Grimaldi's, Rosati's, etc), but it is serviceable for a chain pizza. Honestly I don't see this being a regular destination for me.

I ordered the two medium deal, along with an order of fries and brownies. I am highly disappointed in the quality and appearance of the pizzas I received today. It seems the cheese on my cheese and pepperoni pizzas migrated to the middle of the pie, leaving both pizzas nearly naked of cheese except at the tips of each slice. Is there no quality check before delivery? Should I have to inspect each item before letting the driver out of my site?My 3 young children were eager to dig in as soon as it arrived, so I couldn't return the pizzas or have the driver come back with replacements, without at least one child having a melt down. As such, they all just had to suck it up and eat what was in front of them, no matter how pitiful its appearance. So sad!!! I only hope that you'll reconsider having food delivered by this location...unless naked pizza is your thing.

Later I place an order, go in, and even present the email confirmation for the previous order that was undercooked, and the manager makes the brilliant decision not to honor the credit, saying it was too long ago and they have no record of it.
Of course I walk away without wasting any money on the new order that night.  
I would hope the manager had the brains to know no one in their right mind would patronize a restaurant that serves bloody chicken and then flat out lies about crediting money back.

4538447,2015-09-08,3,dj6nbGIqguJDXgz49nmFBw,"I placed an online order at 11:33am. I ordered a large pizza, pasta, bread sticks, boneless wings, 1 ranch, 1 garlic, and 1 marinara (they NEVER bring marinara for the breaf sticks with the pasta). My total was $30.33 and the email said it would take 30 minutes. 12:03 came and went at 12:26pm (23 minutes late) the driver said he had to go to Rhodes Ranch, but he was on his way to my place. 12:33pm, 30 minutes late passed. At 12:40 I get the knock. The driver was nice and apologetic, heck he threw in 2 additional sides of ranch because I waited so long! 

I regret not canceling my order. But I had 4 starving people waiting! So we sit down at our table and start serving. First thing I notice is the crust is pale, I take a bite, it's cold and mushy. I take a look at the crust and it looks so underdone! So not a single person ate enough for one person. It pisses me off that I'm stuck with $30.33 of trash, literally inedible crap. So I look at my reciept, it says my pizza was delivered at 12:12pm....uh no, the driver called 14 minutes after that. So I start piecing the puzzle together. The driver drove all the way to Rhodes Ranch first before coming the .5 mile to my home. You know, it makes sense in my mind that going the shorter distance first to deliver hot food is more practical then driving my food around in your car for more than 20 minutes before bringing it to me. 

The reciept specifically says call the store with issues, so basically don't go and call corporate or post a 1 star review on Yelp without giving them a chance to handle it! Ok, I called. A girl answered the phone, I asked for a manager and was put on hold. Same girl (I think, of course MANAGERS never introduce themselves) answers the phone saying she was the manager. I explained my food was cold and inedible. She took my number and put me on hold. My signal failed. I called right back and a gentlemen answered the phone. I explained that my signal failed and that I was on hold for a manager. He said, HE was the manager (maybe everyone is a manager) and that he took the food out of the hot box himself and sent it with the driver, so unfortunately there is nothing he can do. I simply say okay and hung up. He didn't ask me any questions or even had a gentle tone. He was a douchebag, very smug.  Now I am stuck making CEREAL for my son till I'm able to go to the store. Thankfully I'm moving!!
