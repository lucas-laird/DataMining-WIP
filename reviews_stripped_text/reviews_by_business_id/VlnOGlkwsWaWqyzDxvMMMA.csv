369721,2012-04-07,1,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"The chicken was good. All pieces were moist and the breading stayed on instead of all coming off in one piece. The actual meat on the chicken was pretty skimpy though. They must buy there chickens from the skinny, baby chicken farm. The shrimp was cooked well, but the batter was flavorless. Fries were cold, coleslaw was good, mac and cheese needed to have a cheesier flavor and be warmer (but I enjoyed the addition of pepper to it), and the sweet potatoes were good but had way TOO MUCH nutmeg (again, should have been warmer, as well). 

They were out of lemonade, and since I can't have caffeine, my only available option was tap water. Anyone from Vegas knows that is the last thing you want to drink.

I give this place 2 stars, because there are just as good, if not better places to go for fried chicken all over town. You'll get better sides somewhere else, and you won't get dirty looks from the neighboring stores/restaurant as you head into Flavor Flav's House of Flavor.",qa_OFSHNoPJHbGwKLHH8Tw,1,0,2,QZlY1ZEL06VXmPkz-wa_9Q

Tastes like something I could've made at home but because it was Flava Flav why not try it once. Thanks for the book and the memory.

449100,2012-04-23,6,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"Yeahhhh booooiiiii, this place wasn't worth the hype and the price. Honestly for the price you pay for small portions, you're better off getting a complete meal at Smiths and you would be enjoy the same exact meal for a whole lot cheaper and more flavor. Now don't get me wrong, the chicken had flavor but here were my issues with my experience:

1) Always fresh chicken so you have to wait anywhere from 15-45 mins. Um seemed like I got the chicken from the previous day. That sucker was so dry I thought I was gnawing on a dog bone. So please explain to me why I waited so long for dried up chicken bones?

2) Purchased 8 pcs to find the smallest pieces of chicken ever. Um are these special chickens that need to be priced that much? Looks like they paid the cheapest price from their distributor and got midget chickens to overcharge the avg consumer. 

3) Asked the cashier about side portion sizes and thought we were getting a good deal for two regular size sides. Come to find out, we paid to have sides that fit in your avg Styrofoam container. Seriously? The cashier had no idea what she was talking about! How was this seriously going to serve 2 people? Psshh

4) I swear they purchased their Mac & Cheese from Smith's deli, it taste exactly the same.

5) Staff - I'm sorry but I felt like I was on some hidden camera show. Please don't ask them to explain the nondescript menu as they will give you attitude and ask what you don't understand about the menu. Also, it's always reassuring when you have your management staff talking about deals gone bad and next time they see *****, there's going to be trouble. Is this for real? Am I getting Punk'd? Where's Ashton Kutcher hiding? Think of it as the movie Friday meets Waiting.

So was it worth the hype? Nahhh boiiii. I rather spend that much at Smith's or Albertson's knowing that the food and service is better.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,7,0,2,4Uu2bjCIXMGpz3IhGQO_sQ
488559,2012-04-14,1,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"I felt robbed! Not only was the chicken super salty but I paid $15 for  a two piece over cooked plate with super salty mac n cheese and DRY chicken breasts, a 4 piece strip meal that the fires tasted the best. I had the greens as a second side on the 2 piece meal and it was ok, but tasted like it was from a can. I was soooo disappointed! After all that I realized I should have received a drink with my 2 piece meal. For the wait and the quality of food I was better off doing it myself or going to Church's. At least I know that I would have received my drink and really needed the handful of napkins for my fingers...Sorry Flav....but either it was the wrong time of day or some people dont have taste buds. My blood pressure was off the charts after your food and it was from more than the salt additve I ingested. Dont buy into the hype folks. I was really suprised after looking at some of the photos posted of their meals because my meal didnt look nothing like what was posted.

The cashier told me it would be about a 35 min. wait for the waffles. I waited since I wasn't in a rush. People complained about the wait. One lady said she had driven across town and they had waited 45 min. she requested her money back. Another guy said he had gotten there at 130 and at 245 he was just leaving. 

Finally my order was ready, the waffles were good although they only had red velvet. The chicken was seasoned good but you can tell it sat for awhile because it was hard. 

The staff were really nice and worked hard. I may go back in a few months once they get a few kinks worked out.",6v4Mb2bKRY-FKr5so9ORhw,3,1,3,M0ZS65UmdzIoaKwSJdO6yw

816403,2012-03-23,1,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I decided to check it out. First of all, this a take out place only. No tables, just a few seats to sit while waiting for your order. Location is difficult to find and is not in an attractive location. My first impression from the outside is that it looked like a ""dive"". 

I picked up a few plates for lunch. The menu was very limited; only chicken, no other items. Sides were limited to Mac & cheese and potato salad. No cole slaw or bread at lunch? Very disappointing.

Food is too expensive. $7.99 for 2 pieces of chicken and 2 sides is not a good value. Chicken was mediocre at best, a bit salty, nothing special. I had better chicken at some of the local grocery stores. Wait time was about 10 minutes.

Overall, I would not recommend this place.  It is overrated and there are far better values in town.",GhhqtTGzDJZpMR63WW7WyQ,7,0,1,PlLxei4MTszrcATJNUcQVw
829256,2012-05-21,2,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"After a night on the strip I was starving and the hotel gave me the number to the House of Flavor. I was really excited, because I really wanted to try the food anyways while on my vacation to Las Vegas. 

I put in my order for delivery. FYI, there is a $20 minimum for delivery, which was fine with me. I ordered my food and the guy on the phone said it'd be 45 minutes...I said that was no problem. I was happy they could deliver, since it was really, really late. 

I waited 45 minutes, and after an hour, no food. I called the restaurant and was told again that they only had the 1 driver and she had 2 other orders ahead of me and she'd be there in 5 minutes. 

I continued to wait and it was somewhere between 1 and a half hours and 1 hour and 45 minutes after placing my order that the food was finally delivered. At this point, I was exhausted, so I didn't even get to enjoy the food right away...which was fine, because it was cold by then and I didn't have access to the microwave.

The red velvet waffles lacked flavor...the only thing red velvet about them was the color. They even seemed a bit dry, but of course, I didn't get to enjoy them while they were fresh. 

I'll have to go back when I can and try the food again...I feel like I can't give a fair review because I didn't get to enjoy the food when it was fresh and warm.

If I hadn't of enjoyed so much liquor, I would have just went there, but I had to have it delivered, so from my experience--beware the delivery. It was DESPERATELY lacking.",B0OJcrTGwlXGkixKqNp9jA,5,2,2,WGU79M9K1FkR_Zmv7KxLvA

I got the 8 piece meal and it smelled rancid.  So bad my husband wouldn't let me eat it and threw it all out.. I ate one piece ( a thigh ) and the meat was dry and the skin was oozing grease.

1340285,2012-03-21,7,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"Oops, I did it again, got caught in the hype I followed the crowd. Flavor fav underestimated his popularity or the power of yelp whatever it was this place wasn't ready to serve the masses, more than an hour of  wait for two pieces of chicken is ridiculous. I ordered breast which they were out of so I settled for what they had. When I was asked to pick two sides from Mac & cheese, fries or Cole slaw I opted for the Cole slaw only to be told they were out of it. ( dear cashier, if you get to pick two choices out of three, and you are out of one item, then there are no choices) Corn bread? We're out. Smile? We're out! We're out! But that's understandable the situation was very frustrating and hard to keep a smile, some people got tired of waiting and asked for their money back. I had already waited 30 minutes, what's a couple minutes more.10 min 20 min...30 minutes more.
Finally they called my name, woohoo! my turn to pick up the chicken! 
  "" Leo!!? Would you mind chicken wings? or would you rather wait few more minutes?"" ( few minutes = one hour) no, I'll take what you got. 
       At this point I'll take anything... I took my wings and flew outta there.
  Got home, changed my clothes, (I smelled like I had spent an hour in a kitchen frying chicken), and tried the much coveted piece of fried chicken..........(=.=).........
  KFC, I will never astray or cheat on you again! It was not worth the hour wait, as a matter of fact it was not worth the first ten minutes of waiting, maybe I was expecting too much, maybe I had raised my expectations too high, so high that the wings did not take me there. I'm sure flavor flav will get better once they get their sh*t together.... and then maybe not, I'll never find out, all I know is that because of his popularity, time is on his side ( or on his neck) to fix things up, but for now if you looking for flavor, you will not find it here. Flavor has just left the building.

1543820,2012-03-20,2,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"Okay, I feel like a total hypocrite writing this review, because I'm not a fan of Flava Flav, his music, his personal sense of ""style"", or even of fried chicken.   Then again, I'm a middle-aged white yankee woman.

But.. I have a Southern-Fried husband who wanted to try it and we were in the neighborhood after getting my car checked at the shop.. pulled into the strip mall where House of Flavor is located and there weren't any lines... a good sign, in my opinion.  To me, it meant that Flava wasn't in the house so we could actually just get the food and not be involved in any celebrity-worshipping circus.  

I'll admit, I was a bit dubious when a man unlocked the door to let us in, then locked the door behind us.  He was the ""doorman"" for a take-out chicken joint?  Just what were they worried about keeping out of there? 

We were third in line for ordering, and the menu is limited for their grand opening.. I got the small fried chicken meal (2 pieces, 2 sides, 1 drink) and hubby got the large meal (4 pieces, 2 sides, 1 drink).  It took a while for our food to be ready and, when our order was up, we were asked if all white meat was fine.  It wasn't, but I wasn't about to wait any longer (I kept eyeing the large windows and the locked door with unease).  We had to drive quite a distance to get home, but we brought our food in and ate our lukewarm lunch.

Can I say ""Wow"" without being a hypocrite?  Nope.. but I'm saying it anyway.  The chicken was fantastic - very flavorful and moist, and not greasy at all.  Whenever hubby hauls me out for fried chicken, I eat one piece of it (at most) and that's under duress.  This, I'll travel back across town for again.  I ate both of my pieces of chicken and might have eaten more if it had been there!

The sides we both got were cole slaw and the mac & cheese.  The cole slaw was initially boring, I thought it could have used some vinegar.. but it oddly grew on me after I ate more of it and, by the end, I really liked it.  The mac & cheese was too cold for me, so it's in the fridge for reheating later.  We both got sweet tea for our drinks because hubby loves the stuff, he drank both of them up and said it was pretty good.. I'll take his word on that one without verifying.

So, I have a grudging bit of respect for Flava Flav now.. because his chicken is amazing.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,5,1,5,79hvMQjA-2Dq4TKKNgSF1Q

1909248,2012-05-09,1,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"Really good fried chicken , Yeahhh Boyyy in a positive way. If you have never waited 15-20 minutes for takeout fried chicken in your life (like I have in the South), then you haven't had good chicken yet. On my initial visit today, I sauntered inside about 2pm to purposley miss the crowds and it worked to perfection, except that they were out of the Greens. Guy at the cashier was helpful about side choices and always kept the customers who were waiting informed that the chicken was almost ready.  (I was the first of six orders who walked in after me). Twenty minutes of staring out the window later, my 2 piece (all white - 2 Breasts ($1.50 extra) arrived, along with my sides of Sweet Potato Fries and Potato salad and a roll. Potato salad had a great flavor (relish maybe?) and the Fries could have been crisper, but they were thick cut, with a bold taste and kinda different than the usual matchstick variety. Roll was just a dinner roll.
Ok, the Fried Chicken won't crack my top 5, but I was impressed by the crust and nice size breasts offered. Personally, I don't mind if it's a bit dry, so I was actually able to ert this whoile thing without using a fork and very little to no grease. Easy to bite and tear, this chicken lives up to the pomp and circumstances.

1953196,2012-07-29,0,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"My very first yelp...and I had been sitting on a groupon for an 8 piece chicken & waffles for sometime...we had just returned recently from Disneyland and had been eating some pretty good chicken & waffles :) 

I read lots of the mixed reviews online -- so wasn't sure what to expect.  This looked like a little hole in the wall place with a mom & pop type shop -- we went on a Saturday night around 7ish and there was only one couple eating there at the time, and they really enjoyed their fried chicken so I was hopeful. 

After reading the reviews on how long it takes to get your order and on the mobile app ordering online says something crazy like up to 120 minutes...I was a bit nervous as my husband can be a bit impatient and considering we live across town in NLV waiting for chicken & waffles might not be a good idea after a long vacation. 

I asked the cashier how long it would take and he said about 10 minutes so I wasn't too worried. 

After 10-15 minutes the chicken was ready and we had to wait another 5-8 minutes for the waffles as another person was making that...we had 1 regular & 1 red velvet.  Since we had a long trek across town to make it home I'm sure the food sitting in the bag for 30 minutes wasn't helping much. 

The flavor of the fried chicken was great! The only downside was for our taste we found it to be more salty then we would like...but I'm sure lots of others love that about fried chicken...even with that we did enjoy it and appreciated the crispy coating & flavor and of course we always worry anytime we eat meat that its throroughly cooked - which here was not a problem.  It was fried to golden perfection and we are dark meat fans so happy to have more dark than white meat in our 8 piece mix. 

The waffles looked delicious they were HUGE and thick waffles and I was eagerly looking to try them once we got home.  On the downside like I said - after 30 min in the car they were no longer crispy and more soft/cake like by the time we got home but flavor wise we liked them! 

This morning I took the leftover waffles & threw them in the toaster oven to try to get a bit of crisp back into them and added the butter & syrup & they were wonderful! I was very happy with them - even more than last night! 

All in all - we would go back again, the food was great for our taste and I loved the waffles!  I would hope that in the future they maybe expand it a bit more to have more than on cash register & waffle maker but I do know that our food like the sign said is freshly made every time. 

The only other note is in that complex we noticed flies outside therefore flies also get inside -- not sure how they can combat that issue given the fact the door is constantly opening and closing with guests.  The cashier was kind enough to put our chicken in the bag before any unwanted winged guests tried to taste it before we did.   We did also get the wrong side dish which was a bummer but we were satisfied with the chicken & waffles we didn't really care. 

If I was an investor I would probably consider a franchise - tweak the salt levels add a bit more commercial appeal and of course the ability to quickly tend to each order with more equipment -- and of course make it cooler in there for the employees...the chicken is pretty good so  I would expect to have a lot of repeat customers.",sxS7AX38FpMqQhKfj51DMA,0,0,4,AZQrA0XCwnICCby_3acsRg
1983040,2012-03-17,2,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"Yes, we know what time it is. It's time to get the best fried chicken in your life.

On a spur of the moment adventure, we decided to go to Flavor Flav's House of Flavor on opening night. Part of the review won't apply to the future as Flav won't always be cooking in the kitchen. But he was that night...

What an incredibly nice person. He took time to take photos with everyone. His employees were tired (as they didn't expect the large turnout - I guess) but they were all very nice. So extra kudos to them. You can't keep from being tired at work but you can act how you want. They all chose to act friendly and that was awesome. Cheers to professionalism. 

So, what about the food? We'll I'm a former Southern Girl and one of the staples of good southern cookin' is of course fried chicken. Flav might be from New York (I think) but he makes the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. It kicks the Colonel off the plantation, tears Popeyes from Olive Oil's arms, and gives Churches a crisis of faith.

It's the best fried chicken period. Nicely fried with no burned areas, a nice  covering of batter with an almost second layer underneath or perhaps a batter that cooks crispy to slightly chewy (NOT Under-cooked). I don't know but it adds to the Flavor. There's an ingredient I can't place but it sure does make the chicken great. 

Besides chicken the sides are awesome as well. The guy knows his Mac and Cheese. Even the french fries were good.  The cornbread was very good. One could describe it as almost cake-like. Not too sweet where it feels like you're eating pastry but I nice middle ground between bread and cake. My fiancé who doesn't care for cornbread at all loved it. So that should tell you something.

Since it was opening night, most of the menu wasn't available but I plan on going back for the velvet waffles and other items. Everything I tried was good so I have no reason the same won't be true for the other items.

So what about the price? Vegas is full of places that up the price to give the perception of value. Thankfully, Flavor Flav's House of Flavor isn't such a place. Everything's nicely priced. It's comparable to the fast food chicken places. It may even be lower. I honestly can't remember with clarity but you won't feel cheated.

On a side note, kudos to Flav for working in the kitchen to make sure people got their food quicker. Many celebrities would have left after a few hours but he was there working past midnight and always gracious with the people.

To recap (or for people that glaze though reviews), it's the best fried chicken in my life Boyeeeeeeeee (It's mandatory to say Boyeeeeeeeee).",Gcx8OEYpT85qddaoiFw3Gw,3,3,5,yLG36P85pYlaNzBC9VJ2NA

I am really wondering about the rave reviews for this chicken and can only account for it being, people who have never had good chicken. It was greasy and there was no exceptional flavor to it just salt and pepper and it was very greasy (I fry my home chicken better than this stuff). The macaroni and cheese was just macaroni with a cheese sauce on it, the fries were good but how hard is it to fry fries? Can't rate the other sides since we were told they were working on the cole slaw. For the price I expected better. I was also really upset that they told us they had wings and drums and upon driving off didn't realize until too late that they gave us only drums (look out for that bait and switch). I really wanted to be supportive too of a black business but if Flava Flav doesn't get in there and make sure they are cooking that chicken right, this business will close with a swiftness like his other place did. To be fair I'll check Yelp again and I might give it a try again, I will improve my opinion only if that chicken improves.

No cole slaw or corn bread, and  ""that's the breaks for me"".   If they gave me those items; maybe I would have Grandmaster flash a four star rating for the House of Flavor. 

There was no Public enemy guards at the entrances, and everyone had to chill  20 minutes for their order.  It's was pretty cool seeing Flavor kicking it at the deep fryer, and unlike saying ""Don't believe in the hype"",  Flavor's Chicken meets the hype for his chicken, but none for his sides.     It would  ""take a nation of millions to hold us back"" from following the "" white lines"" back to this place.....during the day, and ordering a 8 pieces to go.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,3,4,2,riIDQ0SYqvvI46Y1jvrA_w

The chicken was pretty good although it's probably only good when its served hot and fresh.  It is a little on the salty side as some reviews have pointed out.  I enjoyed the hot sauce alot.  

The lady there was really nice and gave us a free 2 liter of soda and 4 extra pieces of chicken bc they were cleaning up and we weren't able to sit at the counter.  

They didnt have any of their red velvet pancakes which seems common among these reviews but no worries as I have a 2nd groupon to redeem.

Funny thing I read about Flavor Flav's failed restaurant in Clinton, Iowa just a year ago.  Hopefully this location will fare better over time.

We all know the ladies don't be fallin in love with Flav' for his good looks or his grill, but they do be fallin in love. I figured it out today. It's his mutha fuckin chicken. Hot damn it was so good!!! 

 Not many people can say that the first time in their white girl life they had fried chicken it was made by Flavor Flav on his 127th birthday. No, but this white girl can! He cooked it up real good and I think he used his flavor of love, too. As a matter of fact I might be pregnant with his 42nd baby just from being exposed to that love. Oh, it was so good. The side dishes absolutely need work so for right now you just spend your money on the chicken. I got a breast and it had to be a size DDD cause it was voluptuous and scrumptious. The seasoning is DYNO-MITE!! Super crispy, too. Hint: I didn't peep any hot sauce so bring your own.

The spot itself is take out only for now, which is all good to me. It's not really the kinda place I need to be hanging around at waiting for Bubbles to stumble by with his shopping cart full of t.p. and hats. It's small inside, but he's got a huge UNLV Rebels banner (GO REBS!) and also a wall of pictures of himself with other celebrities. I didn't notice any signature clock around his neck or on the wall for that matter. Regardless, it has charm.

The service was welcoming and not fast, but I didn't think it would be since they've been open for like 12 hours. The prices were cheap. Flav' was doing all the cooking and all I've got to say is that if eating fried chicken will help you live to be 127 AND give you the energy that man has I just might have to come back for more. There was a woman in there that had ankles the size of my face so I better not come back too much. 

Flav'-  Thank you for cooking for me on YOUR birthday. Welcome to the neighborhood boyeeeee! Hope you stick around awhile.",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,21,25,4,hYST3dXwyq7X4obDxPSXgQ

It is what i expected it to look like for a small take out chicken joint. It could of had some more fun Flavor Flav customizations to make it look better..but it is what it is. 
Now on to my gripes - The menu is over priced and to top it off, the chicken wasn't even worth it! My bf and I paid $15 for an 8 piece and it was so freakin salty! Like so damn salty, i don't even know what to compare it to! I guess if you just swallowed a tablespoon of salt....it was just THAT salty. Like OMG! Even eating it with ketchup and hot sauce didn't help! I had 1 piece and that was all the salt i could endure. I just feel sorry for my boyfriend who had to eat the other 7 pieces. In the end..i am really disappointed. I thought it would be a banging chicken joint, but for me it wasn't. I will stick to KFC or Popeyes, or Harold's Chicken Shack, if that is still open.

We used the groupon deal and found it annoying we couldn't call our order in ahead of time.

Chicken:
-seemed like it had been sitting a while
-texture was decent, flavor was lacking, hot sauce helped but shouldn't have to

Red velvet waffles: soggy and flavorless

This place is way out of the way and not worth the trip.  The little counter where you could eat wasn't too welcoming and it was super hot in the restaurant.  I think the chicken would have suffered from a long car ride to be eaten elsewhere.

One week later, there are no crowds outside...

No bouncers/security at the door...

Flav wasn't there, but businesss partner/co-owner (I THINK) Farrah Gray(Self made millionaire who got his start selling PET ROCKS AS BOOKENDS!) was holding it down, and the kitchen has seemed to gotten their groove back.

Hour+ waits have been narrowed to minutes(45 minutes for our order) still, totally worth the wait, and the sides have improved.

Still, there are Shaniquas, and Ray-Rays who can't comprehend that this is NOT Church's or Popeye's

They need to stock up on chicken thighs, they're always out...also keep a steady supply of sweet tea and lemonade...none of that the last time either...

Unfortunately I don't have a cool story with Flavor Flav like everyone else, I didn't see him in the kitchen during my visit. Since it just recently opened, I guess a lot of other people can't ""fight the power"" and not come down to the house of flavooooor. There was a doorman controlling the masses, kind of like a club... Club Flavor.. YEAAAA BOYYYY. 

Menu is pretty simple, the ""Semi-hungry"" ($7.99), 2 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, and a drink. The ""Hungry"" was ($11.99) and comes with 4 pieces of chicken instead of 2. Sides include mac & cheese, fries, or cole slaw. You can get all white meat for another $1.50, but when I was there they gave it to me for free, guess they ran out of dark meat. There are other options for you to order more sides or up to 24 pieces of chicken. 

The chicken verdict... its juicy, succulent, crispy, and wasn't raw. You can't really ask for more than that lol. Comparing it to KFC, Church's, or Popeye's.. well it is gonna start a ""revolverlution""! The sides could use work, but they aren't the star anyways.

The mac n cheese was ok: a little runny but flavorful. And the fries were much better than average.

Lunchtime, mid-day on a Thursday. Joint had 3 people waiting, so not overly busy. Went in with my Groupon for 8 pieces mixed order and 2 waffles. I ordered two regular waffles since I'm not a Red Velvet fan. I also ordered a regular side of Mac-N-Cheese and a drink. After 25 minutes of waiting, the gal says they need to make fresh waffle batter and it will be another 10 minutes or so. Not like I got a lot of choice in waiting. 2 people ordered after me and left before me, so almost like Groupon orders are slighted anyway. Staff was nice and even gave me a copy of Flav's book for waiting, they were best part of visit.

40 minutes after walking in, I am walking out with what should be a fairly simple order and head back to work. Get there to find only 7 pieces of chicken and no Mac-N-Cheese. Waffle was tasty, but nothing special. Chicken has good flavor, but is TOO salty and that overpowers the flavor after a few bites.

Overall, poorly managed, mediocre food and OK service. People say it's worth the wait, but that isn't even close to true. I wouldn't go back...or recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't even buy another Groupon. I'd be surprised if it lasts very long here in town at all.",2E4NBQv6G8UhQfhlMNAg1g,4,1,1,KcfOcJgcCCKQdL6yXTOw4Q

Flav is obviously trying to make a buck off of his name because the food just is not worth it.

This place is unsanitary. The cooks both walked in and out of the restaurant several times (why?!) only to come back in and begin cooking food without washing their hands. Flavor? Is this the added FLAVOR you were referring to? Bacteria? Methinks this is NOT OKAY.

First I'd like to say that the chicken does deserve the 5 stars everyone has been giving it, so definitely give it a try. It had the perfect amount of spices and juicyness to make me want to eat more. 

Now the reason I'm only giving this place 3 stars is because of service. Service is the most important thing to me when eating at any restaurant.  Upon arriving there, there was a sign stating that it would be open at 1 pm. It was already 1:15, and it still wasn't open. The management was still a bit rocky since it was the first week, but I decided to stick it out because of the amazing chicken smell that would seep through every time the door opened. Flav wanted to be there to serve and cook our chicken for us, which I thought was very nice of him. However, it did take about an hour and a half for him to arrive. They gave us all books and he signed them and took pictures with the crowd, which was really cool. 

When we finally got to ordering, I ordered the semi-hungry meal which consists of 2 pieces of chicken, two sides, and a drink for about $7.50. I am not a big fan of dark meat, so I opted to spend an extra $1.50 to make my meal just white meat. After I placed the order I had to wait about 20 to 30 more minutes for my order to arrive. I took the order home and when I bit into the chicken, I saw it was all dark meat. 

I know it's just $1.50, but I was hoping to get my order correctly after waiting for so long. The chicken was still delicious, and the sides (mac and cheese and french fries) were good. However, I recommend letting this place get settled down for a couple weeks before trying it out.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured ""Why not"", and bit into it.

People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  ""If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken"", he said, ""you can come up and punch me in the face.""

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a ""bucket list"" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,28,32,5,-oyfbBn1zXg6xQoT3Wblng

BUT the chicken golden crust looked like it was be tasty. BUT it was not! It had no flavor, where's the flavor flav??? I was told i could come back for the waffles but it would not be worth the drive back over there. Groupon and all, it was a bust!",LSw5J-mDFXr75jmYmRnWow,1,1,2,ihkba1WwXNenwwKwqDr6xg
5735715,2012-05-26,0,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"My co worker and I were starving the other day and heard that this place had really good fried chicken, so we were inclined to give it a shot. We ordered:

-Fried shrimp semi hungry meal with potato salad, mac n cheese, and dr. pepper $9.99

-Fried chicken mini meal with mac n cheese, coleslaw, and a dr. pepper $6.99-$7.99

The shrimp tasted terrible. For a place called house of flavor, I was missing it in the breading of those little guys. Also the shrimp was really close to being undercooked. The texture was really off and i just stopped eating it after the third piece. They also did not have any sauce for the shrimp and were out of ranch (wth?!). The mac n cheese was the BEST part of the meal. It was cooked perfectly, tasted well, and had bacon pieces in it. Yum! The potato salad and coleslaw were just average, comparable to what you can buy at Albertson's or WinCo. My co worker had the same flavor issue with her chicken. It lacked a whole lot. We grew up around all of the dishes served here and knew how they should tasted and were just disappointed. We were expecting some down home Southern style fried goods so good that'd it made you wanna slap somebody. I was still hungry since all I really ate was 3 flavorless semi undercooked shrimp and a scoop of mac n cheese, so I went somewhere else.
Overall, it's just not worth it to go here for sub par food marketed under the name ""Flava Flav"".",6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,4,2,2,IC6jL8Q0IBzYHFjUZIr40Q
5765572,2012-03-16,1,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"Ok, I was hangin' with a Missy Elite Yelper and we conquered Flav's birthday inaugural lunch.  In fact, we were the very first official lunch recipients of food.

We got there at 11:50am and there were about 8 people in line already.  By the time we left with our food 45 minutes later, there were probably 50 orders taken.

GREAT CHICKEN flavor!  The sides were blah but hey, you  come here for the chicken not the cole slaw.

Flavor Flav's enjoyed all the birthday/new restaurant well wishers as all the camera phones came out and snapped it up.  Unless there is some extreme $$ mismanagement, this place will need a larger location within a year.",BzEf4f8nNYz3SCb_qA66DA,1,2,4,zY-eZypV_u33cAja57wwFQ
5880647,2012-06-27,0,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"So I was in the neighborhood at the hospital and decided to stop by with my daughter. We both talked about trying this place out. We love fried chicken and I grew up liking Flavor Flav. 
We ordered an 8 piece and 2 sides (sweet potatoes and greens) to go because the place is too small to stay and eat.  I expected to wait a long time because that's what I read in some reviews. It only took about 15-20 mins. We had about a 25 min drive home. By the time we got home the chicken and sides were still warm enough to eat. 
Delish!  They weren't lying, it was full of flavor. (I read some people complain that it was salty.) I didn't think it was salty at all. They didn't skimp on the seasonings though. The sweet potatoes were very good. And the greens were cooked properly and tasted good as well.
Better than that Harold's place and KFC.

The only complaint I have is that I feel that the sides are too small and the place was too small. Hopefully one day he can expand. It would be nice to have more space for people to sit and eat during their lunch hour. 
 I plan on stopping by every time I have an appointment. :)",aEv2W5IQrIMOFKviqtEzXQ,1,1,4,29eF5EYS9ep00X-xr-kJjA
5916307,2015-03-28,0,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"I was in Vegas for Spring Break and thought my daughter and I would try it. The wait was a bit long. 20 minutes for chicken but I guess that's because it's made fresh every time. No Flav in the house. I expected more from the decor, but I was there for the chicken. The chicken was good, but I come from a family of fantastic southern cooks so it wasn't better than my own. Greens were over seasoned and overcooked. Mac and cheese was box style. No cheese and mo flavor. Actually I was surprised the sides weren't good. The prices are outrageous. 10.35 for 2 pieces of white meat, 2 sides and a drink? Not worth the money. I like Flav so I am glad I supported him. I won't be back ever again",cV8ncSF64YSfDI3wyrgFeA,0,0,1,CSpUfhPRWK65EzL0eXbEtQ
5959618,2012-06-20,4,VlnOGlkwsWaWqyzDxvMMMA,"I purchased the Groupon for Flavor Flav's about a month ago and finally got a chance to come by and try them out. I had heard from previous reviewers that the wait for chicken was quite long, so I thought I'd be extra smart and place my order over the phone in advance. We put our order in about 40 minutes before arriving at the restaurant. My fella called in and had the store on speaker while he ordered so I heard both sides of the conversation. He ordered the chicken and told them we would be by in about 30-40 minutes to pick up our order and that we had a Groupon to redeem. The girl on the phone kept saying ""ok, ok"" and even took down my fella's name, never once indicating they might have a problem having our order ready when we get there. 

40 minutes later, we arrive at Flavor Flav's and tell the guy at the counter that we put in a phone order and that we had a Groupon. The guy then referred us to the girl behind the counter who I assume is the one who took our phone order. She explained that they have had problems with people ordering over the phone in the past with a Groupon and showing up and not actually having a Groupon to redeem that they refuse to start cooking orders for customers with Groupons until customers show up. I can understand this as a problem, but I don't really understand why she couldn't have explained any of this to us over the phone when we put our order in. There were several other customers who had this precise problem that walked in after us and they were quite peeved as well. We put in our order at the counter and 45 frustrating minutes later we received our chicken and waffles (minus the red velvet, since they were out of batter). By this time, my fella was quite thirsty and asked for something to drink. They offered us a free two liter for our trouble and to be fair the staff was quite friendly to all that were waiting for their chicken, giving us updates as to how much longer we would have to wait and offering us beverages while we stood around. They could avoid all hostility with customers if they just explained their stance on phone orders in advance instead of having people come all the way in only to find out they have to order again in person and wait.

The food was really good, probably 4 stars if I was rating the food alone. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the waffles were probably my favorite thing we had. I only wish they had given us more than one small container of syrup for the three large waffles.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,16,6,2,aSRZaxisl40xjVWMhC9sog
