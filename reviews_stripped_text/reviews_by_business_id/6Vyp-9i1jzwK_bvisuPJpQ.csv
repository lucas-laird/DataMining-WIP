Yes it's lobster but just consider that the lobster rolls contains claw meat, not the premium tail meat that we are all familiar with and enjoy and the medium sandwich is relatively small and did not meet our expectations, my suggestion, go to Costco and buy a couple nice tails, a couple nice steaks, have a nice meal.",sD-5oVw2Ue1MJTxNq2z_fw,3,0,3,ig1ouTwEf8AKCdo3egekig

My cousins and I were walking the mall and I noticed the words Lobster ice cream free sample. So hey why not take a crazy chance and try something different. We ended up ordering it and we all shared. Of course it was $8.50 for a small ice cream but it was worth the try. 

The second time I came was to try the food; my bf and I decided to get the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Lobster Bisque. Yum! The Lobster Mac n Cheese was not bad it could use a little bit more sauce. The Lobster Bisque was delicious especially in a bread bowl.

I'd say it's higher end fast food -- you order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table. It's more expensive then your usual fast food but is much cheaper than a sit down restaurant on the Strip. I had a lobster roll for about $13 and a Lobster Mary for $14. We shared a lobster bisque for $9. 

The lobster roll was so so, the bread seemed like a folded piece of Texas toast rather than an actual roll. The lobster meat also didn't have a lot of flavor. The Lobster Mary was fun because it's served with a piece of claw meat as garnish. The lobster bisque was blah. It was too salty and oily for my taste.

130002,2017-12-19,0,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"Got the Lobster ME Signature Roll and the Maryland Blue Crab (lettuce wrapped). 

Lobster ME Signature Roll
The bread they use is excellent for the lobster but there was a great lack of care when it came to how they cut the roll.  It was cut at a diagonal and nowhere near down the center.  Having the roll cut at a diagonal meant way too little lobster for the amount paid.  The table next to us in the open seating area had the same roll, but appeared to have a better hand dealt to them in terms of amount of lobster in the roll.  I've had about 15 different lobster po-boys in my life and this place takes last (in terms of price and amount of lobster).

Maryland Blue Crab 
The mixture (similar to a tuna salad mix), was decent.  The Blue Crab was definitely present in the mix, but it has a strong fishy smell you get when crab has sat  for a while. 

We came here after going to Jaburrito the night before and used the 10% off coupon they gave us.   Jaburrito was excellent compared to Lobster Me (different type of food but I'd expect the same quality as Jaburrito).",llH1fYjmmItyjt9euCss8g,0,0,2,lc930n-DcyOiUdUiVaXAiQ

I'm a big fan of lobster rolls and have had my share. The best is still at the Lobster Roll (Lunch) out in Amagansett, NY.

The lobster itself was good, not great.They serve it with cole slaw on the side which it added to the roll. It needed something more with some crunch and the cole slaw helped.

376509,2017-07-29,0,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"Lobster ""M E"" = Manipulated Expectation. First off, I will say, I give this place 2 stars vs. 1 since the food was not of poor quality and the service was fine. The value however, was way off. Looking back I have only myself to blame, but I hope my post will dissuade other big hungry guys or perhaps their wife will read and warn them. DO NOT expect a sandwich from this. Despite the fact you are paying more than a filet minion, the sandwich is not a sandwich as many lobster roll joints have come to be known for providing over the past few years, but in fact an old school 5"" bread roll. 

Here is where you ""Lobster-Lost Me"" folks: 

If you were charging $5 to $7 for a 4 to 5 inch old school lobster roll (or even $10 to $12 in Vegas), that would be OK. However, when you charge $27 bucks, you better damn well slap that sucker in a hoagie bun and fill it up as I and every real American man expects it! 

The giant ""sandwich"" photos at the booth at first glance look like normal sandwich rolls (AKA Hoagie Rolls for our East Coast Friends). Here is where I goofed. If you look closely at one photo, you can see wedges of avocado on the top. If I were smart and not hungry, I would have realized the roll was only slightly larger than these wedges. What these are is in fact, a bread roll and not a sandwich roll. At the price charged, the roll needs to be at LEAST 8 inches long and still contain sufficient lobster to spill out of the edges to the point of being nearly impossible to consume. Alternatively, Lobster ME may cut their prices down to $6 per roll. 

I am doubtful either will happen. As such, hungry men everywhere, unite! Demand value and say ""NO!"" with me to this cruel and unusual punishment of our wallets and our appetites!",YAwxFb09bSeHq7dWQUnDrw,0,0,2,zkb-91LWHy5Vn_Z95hlitw

The Bloody Mary was great, if you're a fan of Bloody Marys. It wasn't a cocktail made from scratch as I expected, but rather made with store-bought Bloody Mary mix. But hey, it was great!

Having won free tickets to the Beatleshow! (which is a really fun show btw) and with a half-hour to kill before we had to line up,  we found ourselves wandering the Miracle Mile and happened  upon Lobster Me. As we perused the menus, written on chalk blackboards (yes there is the obligatory nautical theme here, but you're ordering and picking up at a counter and eating at a random table set not quite in the pedestrian walkway so there's not much in the way of what I'd call ""ambience"" - hence the 4 not 5 stars) --- anyhow as we were standing there we were approached by a very friendly gentleman who explained the offerings and offered us samples - of which my husband gladly partook. Alas, they were out of lobster ice cream, but we promised to return to sample the cuisine after the show.  True to our word, we returned and ordered the lobster roll (save your money and do not order the extra large -- for 6 more dollars you're only getting about an inch more of roll and maybe one or two extra lobster pieces) and the lobster bisque in a bread bowl.  Aaaaaah the lobster bisque!!!  Served in a delicious sourdough bowl, it was piping hot - just the right temperature, with a lobster garnish and my oh my! it was so buttery and creamy and oh so chock full of lobster chunks!!! i really couldn't believe I was having this in Vegas!!!! And the lobster roll (for 3 more dollars you can get fries and a drink - it's worth it) -- was superb!! Yes I am a lobster roll purist - my benchmarks are Woods Seafood and Lobster Hut in Plymouth, MA -- and I never thought anything, especially out here, would come close. But OH!!! this succulent lobster was dressed perfectly and the roll was grilled just the way it would be back East!!  What a wonderful find!!

We ordered the lobster roll ( medium - $18), Lobster Grilled cheese ( I believe it was $13 ) and lobster mac n cheese ( dang, I was tired - I forget the price but I'm guessing $15 )

Glad I bought a large can of Corona ( $10 )  - I just about killed the can before the food showed up.

The verdict - not bad.  The roll was very basic - grilled roll and chunks of lobster saturated in butter.  Decent serving size.  Lobster was tender.

Lobster mac n cheese - I liked it;  gf didn't.  She felt the lobster should have been cooked into the mac n cheese.  my response, "" Why?""  I've commented on other reviews I question the combination of mac n cheese and lobster ( I feel the lobster gets "" lost "" in the cheese ) but I felt this serving was decent.  I do agree with the gf that the mac n cheese probably would have been better with a sharp cheese, but again, this will probably result in the lobster getting lost in the shuffle.

The lobster grilled cheese , well.... same principles as the lobster mac n cheese - too much cheese means less lobster flavor so why bother.  Still, not a bad sammie.

Not sure I will eat there again if so, i'll stick with the lobster roll.

My wife and I ordered the lobster mac 'n cheese, a traditional lobster roll, salt and vinegar fries, and a drink. With a $4 online coupon, we got all that for $32. And after a solid afternoon of dodging drunk idiots on the Strip, we found our previously empty stomachs delightfully filled.

Both the roll and the mac had a good amount of lobster chunks. Again, I say that these were CHUNKS. It was not flaky, or fakey. Straight up lobster chunks from a real lobster. The mac was not huge, but it would definitely satisfy your average hunger strike if supplemented with a small side (like fries) and a drink. The roll was smaller (as lobster rolls are supposed to be), but still on the larger side of ones I've eaten in the past. The roll itself was like a buttered and grilled Texas Toast. It was probably about 5"" long and completely stuffed with lobster meat.

The fries were only lightly drizzled with vinegar to avoid an overpowering taste. The salt level was good.

I didn't order them since I was set on the Maine style which was recommended to me by a couple friends.  The Maine style roll comes with chives and mayo on a warm soft delicious roll.  The roll is loaded with a good amount of lobster for what you pay for in Vegas so that's a good deal.  The chips that come with the roll unfortunately are a different story... they don't have any flavor and they're very dry.  It honestly tasted like cardboard box! I had a couple bites and just couldn't with the chips.

The lobster sandwiches are also for the post bariatric surgery patient with a belly the size of a orange.  The lobster chunks were good but for $17 I would expect more than 3 bites folded in 1 slice of regular bread.

I spent $30 for a lobster roll and lobster mac and cheese. The lobster roll mostly consisted of split top bun, which I guess is good if you're really into eating buns. The pictures of a lobster roll overflowing from top to bottom with lobster and giant claw meat on top isn't remotely close to what I received. There was a minimal amount of lobster in my sandwich, and 2 or 3 small pieces of claw meat that in no way covered the top. The flavor wasn't anything remarkable. I was so bummed when I received/tried my food. 

The (lobster) mac and cheese was bland. I ate most of the lobster off the top and threw the rest of the dish in the trash. The dish is just mac and cheese with browned breadcrumbs and then lobster sprinkled on top after the mac and cheese has been cooked/heated up.  Kraft mac and cheese has more character and flavor.  I'm still surprised that they don't incorporate the lobster into the mac and cheese. I was expecting a creamy, savory concoction that featured or highlighted the lobster, and that is not what they have going on.

--------------------

- Cajun Lobster Roll (cajun spices, lemon, butter, and seasoned mayo) - I ordered this one because I wanted something spicy! I made a great  choice because I really liked the spice and the seasoned mayo, but the lobster meat was a bit dry... The size of the lobster roll isn't something to rave about!

- Original Lobster Roll (Mayo and lemon with their house spice blend) - My friend ordered this. I tried and it was just OKAY!

- Garlic Fries - VERY GOOD AND TASTY! It's really worth it!

- Lobster Bisque - We ordered this for our friend, and she said it was good!


Overall, Lobster ME is GOOD. I don't think it's worth $18/roll but I'm just glad I crossed it off my list. It's not something I'd eat every time I'm in Vegas!

We went on a friday night which was probably a bad idea. The place was pretty packed. We actually didn't have any place to sit when we first put in our order. We got lucky though and snagged two tables later on. Just so everyone is aware this place has very little seating. What is frustrating is you'll see one person sitting at a table not even eating and the only thing you're thinking about is where the fuck am I gonna eat this lol. I gave two stars for the food which isn't bad. I ordered the lobster and chips and I got the lobsicle. I didnt return the food because I was so hungry I just ate it. I was pretty disappointed that they screwed up my order. They don't give you many french fries so if you order anything with fries they really skimp on them. I ate my meal and I was still hungry. Luckily my sister inlaw gave me some of her lobster mac and cheese which was just ok. This place isn't cheap. The meal's dont come with drinks. I ordered a Sprite and they charged me $3.00 plus tax and it was a small cup. It's not a bad place if you happen to be at Planet Hollywood and you want to get your Lobster on but I would'nt make a special trip.

While on vacation, my sisters boyfriend was tasked with showing me some of the local eats, at least something that you can find during late hours. I haven't been to the Miracle Mile Shops, but essentially, it's a mall that includes night life and eating places.

After traveling towards the center of the place, you can find Lobster Me, located right next to a Fat Tuesday, if you want one of those big margarita drinks that everyone walks around with. The place itself is only a usual mall-foodcourt type of storefront, so it's a free-for-all on seating, which isn't much in the direct area. It might be hard to find seating, especially if you're with a group, because there are a lot of people bumbling around, especially at night.

There were a lot of things that I wanted to try on the menu, but there lies a small endeavor, everything is crazy expensive. I know that it's seafood, lobster to be specific, but it was a bit expensive in my opinion. Expect to spend around $8-15 for most stuff on the menu.

I had the Lobster & Chips (you know, fish and chips, but lobster). I also upgraded my fries to calamari fries. I originally was just aiming for the regular clam chowder fries as my only dish, but I had some leeway on my budget, so I spent a little more. The lobster nuggets were pretty good, and the cam chowder fries helped round off the meal. I've had calamari fries at other places, but this one is just as good.

The menu of lobster roll is simple but offers good varieties. My favorites are the Maine Lobster and Cajun lobster roll. There are generous portion of lobster meat inside each roll and the bun is super soft and served warm. Standard lobster rolls come with coleslaw as well.

As for prices, lobster roll is around $19 each, which is OK considering it is Vegas. I find one lobster roll may not be filling enough for dinner and you may need to supplement the meal with fruits/salad/soup to feel full.

The people working there were nice, but I still wouldn't return for the quality of food for the price (and in Vegas, you can definitely do a lot better).",gWqPJhU3_s7hTQKfv6HVKw,0,0,2,gFiOl4YKLHt8Qu4trp4UyQ

Lobster ME doesn't have vending machines, but they do have lobster rolls- stick to the classic Original Maine style with a touch of mayo and spices, or dare to try the new Beltway version with Old Bay, shallots, chives, and breadcrumbs. Anything else is blasphemous. 

If you're really feeling daring, add on the chowder fries and a drink for an extra $6- they're like chili cheese fries, but with chowder instead of chili, plus green onions and bacon bits. They're downright intoxicating, if you have the calories to spare.

Bonus star for quick service and 20% off local discount- it's a smallish (hot-dog sized) but meaty roll for $17, which is actually on par with pricing in other landlocked states (so minimal Strip markup?), but the discount makes it especially nice. A $20 lunch, which is pretty much the minimum for the Strip, and the quality is actually really good for a food court-style setting.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,8,4,lmP43bTABsAgN3HLPp4afA

Connecticut Style Lobster Roll $17
(warm lobster meat tossed in butter)

The lobster rolls here are AMAZING. Lobster tastes fresh and chunky. The bread is fat , soft on the inside, slightly crispy on the outside, and drenched in butter goodness. Only downfall is that all the lobster rolls here are very small. Even though it is served with a complimentary small salad on the side, do expect to still be hungry!

Original Maine Style Lobster Roll $17
(chilled lobster with mayo and spices)

This lobster roll equally had fresh chunky lobster. The flavorings tasted simply like lemon and pepper. Still good, but I prefer mines warm.

Clam Chowder +$4
The clam chowder was good. The soup was not gelatinous but was smooth. It had good chunks of potatoes and other good stuff.

Blueberry Lemonade $4
This drink was really good. Not too sour. Not too sweet. Just perfect.

Apple Cider $4
This drink is really unique. It doesn't have a strong apple flavor, but more of a orange spiced apple.

This is Vegas and can they ship fresh lobster to the desert?

The menu consists of your classic rolls, soups, fried lobster and even breakfast items. I was tempted to try the lobster waffles. Unfortunately it isn't baked in, but covering the top. I like my sweet and savory combos though. My friends and I decide on the lobster mac and cheese ($9). It comes out, relatively fresh, creamy and definitely very rich. The cheese taste sharp and not too salty. The lobster is lathered on top. And I do find little chunks of lobster spread into the pasta on the bottom. Verdict: okay. I wouldn't have it just by itself because it is way too rich. And I probably wouldn't order it again because I think the ice cream caught my eye. =)

I live in California and my mother lives in Las Vegas. I wanted to arrange to have a nice lobster dinner delivered to my mother for Mother's Day. Earlier in the week, I sent an email to Lobster Me to inquire about the options and obtain some recommendations. Kevin, the general manager was quick to respond and over the course of several days, he answered all of my numerous questions and made some excellent recommendations. I ordered the following:

Lobster Roll - Connecticut Style
Lobsicle - Grilled
Lobster Mac & Cheese
Chowder
Shrimp Cocktail
Old Bay Fries

When I attempted to have the order delivered using the Postmates app, I encountered a problem. I was in panic mode and I immediately contacted Kevin. Not only did Kevin resolve the issue but he truly went above and beyond to personally make this delivery happen. The level of service that I received from Kevin was absolutely outstanding. He treated me like a Vegas VIP!!!

After my mother devoured her lobster meal she called me and she was so incredibly happy that she was almost speechless. She is a major foodie and she has impeccable taste and a very discerning palate. She told me the lobster roll was not only the most delicious lobster she has ever had, she further stated that it was one of the top two dishes she has had in her entire life!!! She said if there is food in heaven, the Lobster Me lobster roll would be there. My mom also loved the lobster mac and cheese and the seafood bacon chowder! She was too full to try the shrimp or the fries, however she indicated they looked very, very good.

For my money it would be a 3.5 rather than a three.  I'm taking off a half a star because while the food is very tasty, the portions are small and even for Las Vegas, I thought $17 for the size lobster roll was steep.  For an additional $4 you can have a drink and fries instead of home made chips.  The fries were good, obviously home made and not out of a package, but again, small portions.  Potatoes are cheap folks.  If you aren't going to fill the guest up with a huge sandwich and a very tiny portion of cole slaw, then at least pile on the fries.  

It's very casual, in a food court in the Venetian which is fine when you just want a quick bite.  Young people waiting on the customers were very pleasant and plenty of tables around to sit or you can take the sandwich out.  Plenty of folks partaking of the sandwiches.  Didn't hear any conversation so have no idea what others thought.

The lobster roll here left much to be desired. For $18, you get a 3-4 inch bread roll stuffed with lobster.

Let me say, it was extremely underwhelming. The lobster seemed -- literally -- like they were scrapping the bottom of the barrel for lobster pieces. And it was dry, not moist & tender as it should be. I probably should be giving this place one star, not two, but am trying to be generous. And the woman who took my order was nice.

But for $17, I expect good tasting lobster. This was just incredibly meh.

As I have SlapFish here a big difference in LobsterMe is the quantity of the lobster given and the overall taste of the meat as well..For the prices charged for some items you should reward your guests rather then essentially punish them for wanting some great lobster at a great price..The portion size was not well proportioned in my view and the meat itself could've had a little more fresher feeling to it..I guess you can say I know by now what great lobster is and why lower the bar if I'm left feeling like I ran into the bar instead?

I decided on the lobster mac and cheese partnered with the chowder fries..As I did like the mac and cheese with both tender pasta and delectable cheese sauce the lobster was scarce overall (hence the comments above)..The chowder fries were a roller coaster for me..I did find the fries the perfect consistency (not too hard not too soft), but the tomatoes that were partnered with the chowder I felt caused it to be soggy overall

All in all it was a good find, but not a great find..I will most likely give it another shot as there was their lobsicle which was calling my name, but trial and error has shown me what to omit for sure from my palette.",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,1,1,3,fgeTAyeoW42kC-Uztynx5w

Quality was not necessarily bad but cashier was slow and not paying attention. I ordered a roll plus soup and drink. When she asked my order, I said, Cajun with bisque and Dr pepper. I had to repeat myself 3 times and it wasn't because I wasn't clear or loud enough. Not to mention that only 2 customers in front of me took an agonizingly long time to stand in line while people are weaving in and out around me. Annoying and then to have the cashier not even able to take an order. Then the roll was only about 3 bites. Half of it was bread. For $25, I could've sat down at a restaurant. Soda had so much ice that a few long sips and it was gone. Soup is advertised being in a bread bowl but upon getting my soup, I asked and the girl said they changed the menu just today. Lucky me. Not really. Quality was ok but portion ratio to price was ridiculous and added that employees are not the brightest bulb on the tree, will not be back.

I also found out that being a local, I'm supposed to get 20% off plus I checked in and I'm supposed to get free combo upgrade. I believe that's what the hold up was with the guy in front. They didn't know how to use the yelp coupon which seems to me to be an easy cop out because so many places do the same thing.

My friend and I got the Maine Lobster Roll and the Cajun Lobster Roll. Split it so we could taste both flavors. Unanimous decision that the Cajun tasted better since it was more flavorful.

Everything about the roll was just meh to okay. Also, the rolls were really greasy, enough to be cringe worthy. I hate the feeling of excess grease on my finger tips, gahhh.

2341151,2012-02-26,3,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"I was trying to be ""good"" on my trip to Vegas this time...trying to eat well and not go overboard...exercise daily...all that went out the window when at 10pm I turned the corner in the Miracle Mile and like a shining beacon from Heaven saw the words ""LOBSTER ME"" (I do believe I heard angels singing...)

I wanted it all...I wanted to try EVERYTHING...my head was spinning with Lobster combinations that I had never had before...but I settled for a single Lobsicle.  After all, I was trying to be ""good"" wasn't I?  I figured a Lobsicle's portability could assist in my noble attempt to stay on my ""diet"" since I could easily eat it while walking the mall for 3 miles...I'd just call it a ""push.""  Riiiiiiiiight...

I walked around gnawing that thing and must have been stopped by 10 people asking me ""what IS that?"" - I pointed behind me in the direction of the pearly gates and said ""Lobster Me!"" - run, run while it's still open!!!

Needless to say...I gave in to temptation, which is not hard to do in Vegas.  I went back in the morning for the Lobster & Waffles...and the Lobster Wontons, and the Grilled Cheese, and the bisque, and the ice cream...and another Lobsicle.  Ok, ok, I admit it...I have a problem.  A serious lobster problem.  The only thing that could have made any of this any better would have been bacon...

Seriously, the people who DIDN'T give this 5 stars are all on crack...yes, it's expensive people...it's REAL LOBSTER!!!!  It's not langoustines, not crawfish, not any other stupid thing cheap restaurants try to pass off as real lobster...this is the REAL THING!!!  It is from New England and sweet and succulent and AWESOME!!!!  This food could easily be served in a fancy restaurant for more money!!

Lobster rolls - no filler, just a soft, sweet brioche-type bun with delicious seasoned lobster and more lobster...we could all argue until the cows come home over what makes a good roll, a bunch of mayo & celery or just seasoned lobster on a roll, but this roll is for purists...not people looking for a hot dog bun with lobster salad plopped in it.

Lobster Wontons - the filling is some kind of curried lobster mix and delicious, served with a side of sweet chili sauce.

Lobster Grilled Cheese - almost like a creamy cheese & lobster panini but softly toasted bread and creamy yummy cheese inside.  To die for!!!

Lobster Mac & Cheese - yes, it's on the ""drier"" side of the Mac & Cheese gamut, but that's what makes it so perfect.  Just lobster, cheese, breadcrumbs and YUM!  This is NOT your Kraft Mac & Cheese, it is not your mom's ooey-gooey runny cheese type Mac & Cheese.  It is like the kind you get in an upscale restaurant that only needs a few ingredients to make it good.  I have tried every Lobster Mac & Cheese I have ever seen, and this one is definitely one of the best!

Lobster on a stick (called a ""Lobsicle"") - ok, who is the friggin' GENIUS who invented THIS???  Let's put a Lobster Tail on a stick, deep fat fry it, and serve it with a slice of lemon and a bucket of butter...this is so much better than the crap-on-a-stick you get at the fair!!!  I picture this to be the fair food of the Rich & Famous...like there is a little Lobster stand at the Beach near the Hamptons where Muffy & Biff can stop and pick up a few Lobsicles to eat as they stroll the beach in their white tennis outfits?

Lobster Bisque - not the best I've ever had (that was the Clubhouse at South Coast Plaza - RIP) but it is a really REALLY good knock-off!!!  I am a HUGE Lobster Bisque snob...I like my bisque more on the creamy sherry side & not the tomato fishy side.  This was a perfect creamy sherry laced tasting bisque with a huge dollop of chopped lobster bits thrown in - all served hot & fresh in a yummy sourdough bowl.  I could have eaten 3 more of these...

Lobster Ice Cream - I know, it sounds gross...but it is AWESOME!!!!  Vanilla-based ice cream with chunks of lobster throughout.  Not sure if they soak the lobster in sugar or if it really is just that sweet to begin with, but this is one special taste you need to try!!!  They will let you have a small taste if you ask for it- try it!!!

Lobster Waffles - Now, let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of bacon & syrup together...I went ape-sh*t when Denny's had ""Baconalia"" and made the maple syrup bacon sundae.  If you like sweet & salty things, you will LOVE these Lobster Waffles.  Like in the Lobster ice cream, the lobster they use is the sweet New England kind, so it blends perfectly with the Belgian-style waffle & maple syrup.  The chunks of Lobster are tempura-battered and tossed on top of the waffle.  I cut mine up so I could savor a bite of everything each time...and used the extra side of syrup provided (of course!)

I ordered the lobster roll with panko or bread crumbs on it. I was expecting chunks of lobster and a couple of claws as stated by other Yelp reviewers. 

My lobster roll consisted of shredded lobster than didn't even fill the ends. It could of used a little more mayo on it, it just seemed lacking a little. The meat was tasty, but for the price, it wasn't quite there. 

I've had some pretty good lobster rolls at other restaurants, this one came up short. My friend had the same sediments as me. He also got the chowder and said it was really runny. 

If the price was less, then what we got for our buck would had been great, but for the price, it needs to stand out more.

Is it pretty outstanding considering it's in a mall in Vegas? Absolutely. 

I've had the lobster roll and the lobster grilled cheese and both are just wonderful. In my opinion, there's too much lemon and spices on the roll, but otherwise it's perfect-big chunks of lobster tossed in mayonnaise on a hot buttered bun. The lobster grilled cheese is also excellent-hot, steamy lobster in gooey melted cheese between two buttery, toasty slices of white bread. Yum!

I did not think much of it at the time, but, fast forward to a year later, my husband and I were going to be in town again and I decided to take them up on the offer. Why not? 

Okay, so I think the new menu is awesome and the changes that they have made in the past year are great! The prices have increased, however the rolls are slightly larger, a little more toasted (yum), and there is more lobster !!! The potato chips are gone and the standard fries have been replaced with seasoned waffle fries and they are delicious. 

The lobster mac and cheese was very decadent. 
You can probably check my reviews on Yelp and OpenTable to verify that I don't really hand out five star reviews lightly, but not for nothing, I was super impressed with our meal at Lobster Me today. 

My only suggestion would be to serve the lobster mac and cheese in a more shallow dish as the current serving dish is a little deep and makes it a little awkward to effectively eat the dish, although we easily solved this by pouring it all out into the larger boxy serving container that the mac and cheese came in. 

I often wonder if reviews left on review sites or blogs even make a difference to the companies or if they even bother to read them. I thought it was pretty awesome to see that some of the things that I initially griped about were fixed over the past year and management actually seemed to care that a guest that spent money at their establishment was unhappy and reached out to discuss concerns. That pretty much never happens, anymore. Great to see a company with an open ear for criticism and feedback.

I'm pretty sure they keep it refrigerated after peeling it off the lobster.  I had lobster mac and cheese, 2 lobster rolls and 2 lobster popsicles.  The lobster roll wins hands down. The mac and cheese was good but with very little lobster meat.  The other downside is the quantity of meat.  It's around 5 ounces for a small.

I would give the sandwich a 3.5/5 for taste - I've had better lobster rolls that were very juicy and buttery.

What is a Lobsicle you ask? its basically a lobster tail on a stick. You can order it deep fried or grilled. Neither was as appetizing as it sounded. Think greasy vs bland.

The lobster mac & cheese was watery and lacked any real flavor.  I didn't like any of the flavors here.  The lobster was super tiny and didn't add much to the dish.

The only saving grace was the lobster shooter, which wasn't horrible.  It consisted of a chunk of lobster meat, some ketal one, and some pepper sauce or something (lol, I don't know the exacts... it tasted like a bloody mary to me).

I tried this place last year and haven't shut up about it since.  Was in Vegas last weekend for my birthday and, not gonna lie, totally ate here twice within 24 hours, haha.

I was saving the lobster mac and cheese for my actual birthday, but I had to eat something the night before and since I was staying at the Elara (which is attached) I thought, ""Well, I can have the lobster grilled cheese instead, so it's totally not cheating."" The lady serving was super nice and we chatted for a couple of minutes, then my order was ready so I grabbed the container and headed up to my room to get ready for Chippendales (if you haven't been, GO.)

I sprawl all of my crap all over my room and jump up on the bed and open the container- IT WAS LOBSTER EFFING MAC AND CHEESE BY MISTAKE.

Best. Mistake. Ever. I wasn't even mad- trust.

I inhaled it. And then I went back and got it again the next day on my actual birthday and inhaled it all over again.  No regrets.

It's a little bit pricey - $13 or $14+ per entre, but DAMN, I'm still thinking about it. None of the others I have tried have even compared, honestly.

If it's over 100 degrees outside, it's going to be hard to keep seafood super fresh. When in doubt, stick to non-seafood items in the summer on the strip! The presentation looked great and service was very good here - I think if I visited here in the fall, winter, or spring, I would have felt differently about the product.",cKTA-iJbfrioKWFiDreghw,0,1,2,IrXv8Rs8fiqyyz5rSKftFg

After seeing pictures of the lobster rolls and different lobster menu items I'm convinced that this place has the right idea. The rolls look filled with lobster and nicely garnished with butter and other sauce toppings of your choice. No one wants a dry roll. My lobster bisque was very delicious and had a great amount of lobster mixed in. The only thing I can't understand is why soup is so expensive in Vegas. Literally everywhere you go. The lobster bisque from Cousins Maine is $6 for a cup and $8 for a bowl. I paid $10 for a cup and it was $12 for the bread bowl. 

My friend did get a lobster roll and said she enjoyed it more than the roll from cousins Maine. They are a little pricer with the option to style up the lobster roll. But I wouldn't be opposed to paying a little more knowing there are more options. The Cajun, Sriracha and Baja options are free, but you do have to pay $2 more if you want the Cali and BLT option.

One star for the crushed ice in my Pepsi. As I mentioned above, I only took one bite and pushed it away. Had been by myself, I wouldn't asked for a refund. But, my husband is much nicer than me, so he ate it. I hope I don't have to sit with him in the ER later on tonight :(",R4flrLR17toLlbBhy6IUCQ,1,0,1,1vWMTDV--lIZgh5Di30pmg

Also, if you check in on FourSquare they will give you a discount on your tab! Since I forgot to show them my check-in until after we had paid, they offered to give us something for free, which is how we ended up with the bisque. We tried-

-Lobster Mac n Cheese- Really creamy and rich tasting, but could have used more salt. The lobster pieces are on the smaller side and are sprinkled on top of the mac n cheese.
-Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche- Good, but not the best ceviche you'll have. A decent amount of lobster was in the ceviche, overall the dish is very pricey.
-Lobster Bisque- The best dish that we ordered! The bisque was creamy and delicious, and you can taste the buttery goodness.
-Lobster Ice Cream- We just tried a free sample but wow! It wasn't delicious.. but way better than I expected. The person working there explained that it was a Butter Maple based ice cream (or was it Vanilla Maple.. something along those lines) and they added chunks of lobster to the ice cream. I don't think I would order this, but it was definitely worth trying!

Overall, come to Lobster Me if you're craving lobster. I think we would have been more satisfied if we went with the standard lobster roll. However, this place is on the pricey side for what you get, and there are plenty of other places to eat at in Sin City.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,1,1,3,C2DX7IMw0AP85DYI1aohGQ

I visited here twice during my weekend trip, it was that food.  The lobster roll is really amazing.  For $16 its a small portion, but its delicious, and generally lobster rolls are not cheap!  The lobster mac n cheese was my least favorite.  The cheese they use is way too sharp.  It completely contrasts the delicate flavor of the lobster.  I was really disappointed in that.  I also tried the lobster grilled cheese which was good as well.  Their lobster bisque is extremely rich.  I would recommend taking a sample before buying, it was not for everyone.

A variety of 'World's Best Lobster Rolls' to choose from ranging from spicy, cajun, BLT, lobster with seafood, or the southwestern shrimp roll. The Lobster choices range from 'Large' to 'XL' ( Extra Large). Dish out less than twenty dollars for the 'Large' roll size of more than a pound of lobster meat while dish out over twenty dollars for about two pounds of lobster meat in the 'XL'. The ""Original ME Style Lobster Roll"" is the traditional Maine, New England sandwich. It looked mighty enticing as seen as a sample roll displayed behind the glass-walled food cubicle and so, it beckoned for an order of it. It's about a large lobster claw meat and chunks of lobster meat dressed with a dollop of mayonnaise and lemon in a spicy mixture on a slightly crunchy bread roll. Tasty! hmm,soar to New England! Should try ""The Diablo"" for the spicier tasty roll. aaah, dream of dripping in warm sea water! For soup cravings, there's the ""New England Clam Chowder"" or the ""Lobster Bisque"" soup. Ha, could be listening to ocean waves in the distance. Glancing up to the menu, find a cocktail 'Lobster Shooter' or 'Lobster Shooter with Vodka' or opt for the beer. Okay, so get that little seasick effect. If you are a late morning riser, fret not, because a Breakfast Menu is served as well...lobster with eggs, with waffle, with MEmuffin, with tater tots. That is coool! eat breakfast any time. There's lobster grilled cheese, lobster mac and cheese, lobster and chips, and 'The Lobsicle', that is lobster tail on a stick. Feeling like caught a lobster by a stick spear. Oh, there's salads and, and, ice cream. Yes, ice cream, I scream for it (in my mind, only, as you should know it, can't scare diners away, so can't really scream out aloud), the Lobster Ice Cream is a light creamy, slighlty salty tasting lobster chunkiness swathed in finely iced, milky tasting ice cream. That's it? Must I say any more, what else? but lobster in ice cream!  

As landlocked is Vegas, so it is as seafaring into deep waters for a lobster dish which was just served as fast food. It didn't take me to a breezy, oceany lobster trap...aah, at least just for that moment.",l1CtGHiqB349YrmxjIcgng,3,4,3,4Bgz6aEuuv6i3kc2iVzE6A

It was filled with plenty of lobster but was not tossed in the mayo/scallion mix a Maine lobster roll would have. It seemed to have a vinegar based medley that overwhelmed any on the natural flavors.

Most people will want a combo which will tack on another $4 which includes a small drink and a side of vinegar fries. That brings the total to about $25.00 for a standard meal. Now I know this is lobster and the location is on the strip, but for the portion and amount of flavor you are getting your money is better spent at a sit down.

On our visit we sprung for the Connecticut roll which is supposed to be buttered version of the standard roll however I could hardly tell the difference. After what seemed like 3 bites we were finished with our rolls and still had an appetite which is quite disappointing so we shared a lobsicle ($15). 

It may be because it was deep fried and piping hot but this is the one thing I would recommend if you HAVE to eat here. It has some flavor and the temperature keeps the meat soft. Again, the portion is small but I'm assuming the reason you're here is because you're craving lobster right?

While walking around the mall in Planet Hollywood, we decided to pop by Lobster Me and try out the Cajun lobster roll. We got a combo with French fries and a drink. 

The lobster roll was only okay -- the bun was toasted, which was good, and there wasn't too much mayonnaise but there was a heavy dusting of some Cajun spices and scallions on top of the lobster roll. The meat went from very bland to overspiced from all the spices in two different bites. It was weird. 

The fries were also only okay, but nothing to write home about. 

The drink machine ran out of ice, which happens, but it didn't improve my impressions of this place, because we desperately needed something cool to drink after inhaling all the spices on our lobster roll.

What I ordered:
Cajun Lobster Roll - HOLY MOLY. This roll was worth the $20 (or maybe it was $17). They gives generous amounts of lobster and the spice is just fantastic. So much flavor bursting in my mouth, and it didn't overpower the lobster. Every bite was much too perfect with the buttery bun it comes on... wow. If you think $20 is too expensive for a roll, please keep in mind that IT IS LOBSTER... in a desert :P
Lobster Salad - Nothing to special about this salad. I wanted something healthy, but still try the lobster here. I ended up eating just the lobster and a few bites of salad, ha. Nothing too special about this one.

First off, where do we eat?! Too many patrons, not enough tables! Second, the wait for the food was probably about 20-30 minutes. Kitchen seemed to be a bit unorganized, as I noticed like 10 or so tickets at the window! Now for the important part, the lobster... We ordered an original lobster roll, lobster mac and lobster grilled cheese. Unfortunately, we weren't really impressed! The lobster roll was inconsistent in flavor. Some bites were pretty good, others were eh. It was also pretty small! (should not be called ""large""). The lobster mac was, sad to say... Bland and runny. Couldn't really taste the lobster and it looked like Mac and cheese, but the flavor of the cheese was almost nonexistent. Definitely would like it to be more creamy and rich. Finally, the lobster grilled cheese was actually the best of the three, but was far from phenomenal. The grilled bread was good but was mushy. It didn't have that crisp you expect from a grilled sammy. I told my girl, the best part of my meal was my beer.

I ordered this for kids and they weren't able to get them down. So I had to switch with the $24 lobster roll that I got. The bread bowl was soft and there was sufficient amount of soup. I hate it when there's not a lot of soup in those bread bowls. 
The lobster roll was great as well. Soft sweet roll type of bread and a lot of lobster. However, not worth the price tag. Probably more like an $18 cost would've been better. I paid an extra $2 to upgrade to the lobster bisque. It was good. The broth was not thick, more of a lighter texture. Big chunks of lobster was a bonus. 

The beers on tap were not really cold. I think I would've taken the cans if I had to order again. They charge $0.54 for tap water cups. But she gave us 2 for free. The food came out fairly quickly. We were in a rush to get something in our bellies before a show. And managed to order, eat and get out within 25 minutes. That was with a small line.

 It's located conveniently next door to Fat Tuesdays, so this could be a good place to grab a bite before those icey dranks.

The Seafarer Lobster Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas?select=k8BD5TlnoDu7V5nB5-ra5A#cV_H97p1lnoZOclyl1LJ1g) caught my eye because it had some veggies mixed in with the lobster.  (Lobster and seafood salad with mayo, cucumber, celery and green onion).  I like how the roll is buttered and toasted, but I wish there was more lobster in the roll! I was expecting big chunks of lobster but instead got minced pieces of lobster.  I'll definitely get a bigger roll next and share a few items with some friends.

3970346,2018-06-06,0,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"Let's give this another try. The first time I had Lobster ME, I was not impressed. I tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese and it was horrible!  No flavor and it didn't even taste like Mac and Cheese. I only came back here because Gordon Ramsay Burger was too busy to take carry out orders and I was in a rush to get back to the hotel. 

Lobster ME is located inside of Miracle Shops Mall in the little food area next to Fat Tuesday's. I stood in line for a good 15 minutes before my order was taken and there were nothing but about 4-5 people ahead of me. That is ridiculous! Then I waited another 10 minutes for my food to arrive. So not worth the wait. One star knocked off. 

Instead of the Mac and Cheese, I got a lobster roll which wasn't bad. It was seasoned well and they used big pieces of meat. The problem? The roll was 80% bread and 20% lobster. Lobster rolls are already small, but they cut the tiniest slit into the bread and pretty much just plopped a little lobster on top. Every time I picked it up, all the lobster fell out. Another star gone. 

I would come back here as a last resort if I couldn't get to Luke's Lobster on the other side of the strip outside of Fashion Mall. WAY BETTER service and quality.",8nOAfr6VEl4r77W15RU4AQ,0,0,3,7FYts5akCWZ7IvffBR9hcw

Since the place opened, I've been intrigued by the idea of lobster ice cream so I had to give it a try.  There is one serving size, a dish with vanilla ice cream with mixed in lobster pieces and a larger frozen piece of lobster as a topper.

The ice cream was not very creamy.  It had a crumbly texture.  The lobster flavor was not evident until it warmed a bit--they opened a new 5 gallon container--so it was quite frozen.  Now and then, you get a piece of lobster that has a salty taste.  

In the end, I rate this as just OK.  It's certainly worth a try once.  The prices here are high with the lobster ice cream being just under $10 including tax.  That's a lot of froyo at other places around town.  Considering that the cheapest lobster sandwich is $17, this is the least expensive lobster treat at this place.

There are some round tables and I was able to people watch--one of my favorite hobbies on a Saturday night in Las Vegas.  The number of people buying their frozen yard and 1/2 yard drinks was funny.

I'm sure I won't be back.  This was a one time try.  I'm just glad I was there once when they weren't out.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,2,3,olCthuCp1w7zWUnvVMKTSQ

Tested and Approved:
-Lobster Roll Original:  Had the XL Lobster Original Roll.  Delicious, but expensive for what you get. But what are you to expect for lobster?  Thick pieces of lobster inside a buttery roll.  Perfect lobster claw to top it off.  This is a must try if it's your first time here.

-Lobster Mac N Cheese:  I actually liked this better than their lobster roll.  Not too cheesy with a perfect blend of lobster pieces. 

-Tator Tots:  Mixes well with the Lobster Mac N Cheese. 

-Lobster Ice Cream:  To be honest, doesn't sound pleasing at all.  But not too bad, I just didn't taste any lobster since the pices are frozen.  

I plan on trying other items on their menu.  Once I do, I'm sure to update my review. 

Cons:
-It can be a hassle to come here.  I don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.  But if I'm in Planet Hollywood, Paris, or the Miracle Mile Shops, then it's on. 

-Seating: Tables are litterally the size of the serving trays.

Back in December, I was fortunate enough to win a $10 credit for Lobster ME at a Yelp event (see Yelp Helps: NPO-Yeah! for more info). This made any expenditure at this place a much more tolerable option, although I still anticipated having to shell out something for a Strip location that happened to serve the arguably already overpriced treat known as lobster.

I pretty much went straight to the Original ""Maine Style"" lobster roll. I limited myself to the medium size at $17, rather than go for the large size at $23, the difference being $7 vs. $13 out of pocket for me. This is described as Maine lobster with a touch of mayo, lemon, and a secret spice blend. I didn't taste too much mayo and I am reasonably sure that there's turmeric in the spice mix, but I can't be too sure beyond that.

This roll is pretty good! I definitely enjoyed the buttery, soft roll that still had a nice crunch, the ample chunks of lobster meat and claw, and the aforementioned mayo and spices. I probably would have given them four stars on the spot, but during the drive home I realized that it just didn't strike a memorable enough chord with me. Flavor aside, I'm pretty sure I'm barely over half full from that ""medium' roll, if that.

Overall, I can see this being a convenient luxury food option for somebody with money to burn or for a tourist who feels trapped in Planet Hollywood / the Miracle Mile Shops, but I just wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.

Now for those of us who have pulled our cars over in Maine and ordered a lobster roll from the many roadside eateries, we will understand how WONDERFUL it is to find one that is so spot on and in Western US.  Let alone in the desert.  LOL

The first and foremost thing you need for one of these rolls is the bread.  I promise you, you will not find it out here.  You have to bring it in from the East Coast.  Then you need Maine lobster and Lobster ME has it ALL.  If only I could smell the Atlantic I would have been transported back to beautiful Maine and all the lovely ways they know to prepare lobster.

I have had the traditional roll and the bacon lobster roll, both were excellent.  To be honest I was not crazy about the lobster mac n cheese, but as I have said in other reviews, I make THE best lobster mac n cheese so I am biased.  Having said that, no lobster mac n cheese was left in the dish.

Lobster ME will also give you the option of having your lobster heated up before being placed on your roll.  I prefer mine cold, but if you do not like cold protein go ahead and have them heat it up for you.

4127843,2014-02-13,0,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"This review is for the Lobster Me truck.

The truck has a short menu, with each item priced $12. Lobsicle, Maine roll, cajun roll, lobster mac & cheese, lobster & chips, and a couple others I don't recall. (Clam strips were on the board, crossed out.)

I had a lobsicle and lobster & chips. The dishes are very similar--both come with fries. Lobster & chips has lobster nuggets, while the lobsicle is a solid piece of meat on a skewer (a small whole tail?). The amount of meat is about the same in each dish.

The nuggets were a bit chewy but tasted good. The lobsicle was the clear winner, and came with a tub of melted butter.  I enjoyed the fries--nice crisp outside and fluffy interior, with skin on.

I'd call the portion and price reasonable for lobster. I'd eat there again.

Just wish they had salad on the truck.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,0,1,4,fOFv4wTo9Yaz7xjo_-IW9w

We were super impressed by the flavor, everything was super tasty hot and FRESH. The staff was cool, I was not sure what to order that night and the LobsterME employee had some Awesome suggestions.

I went with the original flavor with a touch of mayo and lemon.  The menu only listed garlic fries but I like tots so I asked for switch-a-roo and asked for my tots to be married with garlic.

4260076,2012-04-15,0,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"This will go down as one of the best splurges ever in our many years of food exploits. I was so curious about trying the lobster roll ever since we noticed this place opening last year (never had one! seen them on the food channel on DDD though, so was familiar). Enter last friday when I was entertaining the idea of places to check out this weekend. I had my mind set on this place. I kept talking to my husband about it and we had a nice build up. I was hoping to have it yesterday, except we had spent some time on the east side with my in-laws (translation: we were out all day), that we decided it would be today. Yes, finally, today. Can you feel my anticipation? 

Lunch was relatively empty for a sunday though there were lots of characters passing by (the people watching). There are about 16 tables about five feet away from the restaurant. You order and pay at the window. Ok, a short feeling of sticker shock, over $50 for two combos, the XL Lobster Roll, fries, and a drink. I inquired about the Lobster Ice Cream and the cashier gave us each a sample. Nice surprise, because we didn't ask, but that was nice of her. It was different (not that bad, actually, though my husband made a face suggesting he didn't like it), and now we can say we've tried it! A short wait later, another nice lady delivers the food to us, and what a picture! The nice server brought us lots of ketchup, napkins, and plastic utensils. She also cleaned up when we were leaving.  

The lobster meat (claws and knuckles) on both sandwiches was very generous, and the mayo was light and the seasonings were just right. The bread was lightly buttered and was toasted enough for a light amount of crustiness. (I hate when the bread is soft and gets squashed up.) Also, the bread was not heavy, making the lobster the main attraction (as it should be!). It was the perfect balance. The lobster meat was sweet and fresh tasting (no smelly fish smells here), there wasn't a whole lot of mayo (hate when it's mayo overload, gross), it was delicious!!! Usually, I eat pretty fast, but I went really slow, because I wanted to savor it. In fact, my husband finished his sandwich before I did. I got a few small pieces of shell, but it really wasn't a big deal. The fries were skin-on, thinly sliced steak fries, seasoned, and crisp. The fries were flavorful, but the portion was very generous, so I didn't finish it. Drinks are free refills until 11 pm. 

We both really enjoyed it. It's such a nice thing when a place lives up to your expectations. Yes, it's not cheap, but it's lobster from Maine, people! And yes, people passing by will stop and stare at your food, but who cares, I was so into the food, I wasn't even noticing them. I was so happy to have finally had a Lobster Roll, it was food bliss. It is worth the $$$. Take a to-go menu (no prices) and plan the next meal here.

Its located in the middle of the Miracle Mile Shops. The staff was friendly and helpful. The prices were high to me, in relation to how you could pay the same amount and go to a buffet with tons of seafood. 

I must say I was disappointed with my meal. I chose a large original lobster roll with fries and a drink which was $21.62. 

I love fries but not these.  The fries tasted more like fried batter than anything else. I opted for the original Maine style lobster roll  which is lobster served with a touch of mayo, lemon and secret spice blend on a 6 in New England style split top bun. The lobster was tasteless to me. I couldn't taste any flavor, not even the mayo. It just tasted like lumps of cold lobster and to me, lobster has to have some sauce or of course butter to enhance the flavor.

If you want to taste lobster by all means get the lobsicle see picture. Small grilled or battered small lobster tail that tastes great and fresh. 
The lobster mini tacos were great tasting too but I could taste the lobster if I looked for that bite. So it is a good plate but doesn't scream lobster flavor.

My first visit to this spot was quite some time ago and I absolutely fell in love with the MAINE roll. Soft rolls and a heaping serving of shredded lobster and a large chunk of a whole single claw I believe. I also ordered the lobster bisque which was to-die-for. Creamy and warm and not too spicy.

My last visit to this spot was just the other day to meet a family member. So I ordered the Maine Roll once again. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster and Chips. We got our order and were SO DISAPPOINTED! I'd received a sad little sandwich. The meat was at least filling. BUT, I advise my average meals are child-size servings, so this was okay for ME but definitely not for the average person. The food was good but I honestly was still starving. My boyfriend Lobster and Chips WERE PATHETIC. I'd never seen a serving of fries look this sad. It looked like they threw 10 fries into the box and maybe 4 SMALL pieces of lobster tots. SUCH a waste of money. I've seen tapas plates more plentiful than this.

Overall, I will NEVER re-order again. The food was good but I spent $32 on 2 items and was not satisfied. I am always willing to spend on quality over quantity, but these items did not make rank.",QZXASwZ2RYTexiY0J0xAcw,3,0,2,n7R19WDEQZGTOR2vcsOKJg

Very generous portion of lobster. The Old Bay roll had shallots, chives , mayo, and seasoning with buttery Panko bread crumbs, again with a generous portion of lobster. 

My favorite was the Old Bay, and the mixture of the panko, butter, and shallots really made this roll for me. Absolute purists should try the Original Maine Style if it it their first time, and then branch out to try the others.

The Connecticut lobster roll isn't on the board anymore but they took our order for it without batting an eyelash.

The wife had the grilled cheese and our soon had the Mac and cheese. As mentioned in previous reviews the Mac and cheese isn't out of a box. It was fresh, hot, and they didn't skimp on the lobster. The grilled cheese was warm and plenty gooey with plenty of lobster as well. I went with the regular size lobster roll combo that included fries and a drink. I most say I was a little surprised at the size of the roll for the price, but the amount of lobster in the salad and the claw meat on top more than made up for it. It was so good that I ordered a second roll. 

For me the only negatives is that you share a common area with the bar next door selling those touristy size drinks in those goofy cups. The music that they had on in that bar wasn't something I wanted to listen to.

What came to us, however, was a little lacking. We found very few lobster pieces, the serving was puny at best (as with everything else on Vegas' strip, super expensive!), and it was dunked in oil, oil, and uh, more oil. I kid you not. Now, don't get me wrong, the flavoring of the mac n cheese, I felt that it was pretty good... in fact, I probably would have given them 3 stars in my review since I loved the sharpness of the cheddar and how it cut into the well cooked, super soft macaroni... however... the price of what we paid vs what we got + the next day, when I heated this up, the amount of GREASE that came out (OMG, artery clogging!) + the pathetic amount of lobsters in this serving of lobster mac n cheese?

Lobster salad - I can make this dish better at home.  Pass on this one. Just salad and topped of with lobster. Nothing crazy.

Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche - The only thing that was decent (along with the Lobster roll), it was fresh and tasty, but TINY.

On our way to getting Fat Tuesdays, we checked out Lobster ME (for Maine duh); I had passed by this spot countless of times but it's mostly been closed. For the weekend we went, we separated our team into two lines: one for the booze, and one for the seafood.

Lobster ME offers plenty of great wholesome foods infused with lobster meat. They've got it all from classic Lobster Rolls to more creative fare such as the Lobster Mac N' Cheese, Crab Nachos, and Lobster Fries. Our group grabbed a bunch of these starchy goodness and everything was pretty good. The mac n' cheese was by far my favorite.

As for me, I ordered the Mexican Cobb Salad ($16) which was topped with lobster meat, black beans, and corn. It was my attempt at being a bit healthy during the weekend, and I felt I succeeded very well in that department. The salad was refreshing and the bits of lobster meat sprinkled on top added a lot to the dish.

First time I went with my bf and a couple friends. My bf orders the Lobsticle (Fried whole lobster tail). It was GOOD. Like, straight up lobster. Especially with the butter, oh man... As for myself, I order the Lobster and chips. It's basically similar to the Lobsticle except smaller pieces. One thing I really enjoyed with both the order was the batter. It was really fresh and wasn't too greasy. 

My second experience was my 3rd day before EDC. I order the Lobster salad because I was craving something fresh and light. I think I made an excellent choice. The lobster and salad worked really well together. On the other hand, my bf orders the Lobster Grilled Cheese. Although I did not take a bite out of his, according to him, he was full after the first half of the sandwich. He was also pretty sick of the taste (too cheesy especially with lobster together). My other friend orders the Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche. The ceviche was pretty small, but for the chips they gave a lot ... 

In conclusion: I really like this place. I was not expecting an actual lobster place in the mall of Planet Hollywood. The price isn't bad considering it's Vegas. The amount of lobster they gave you is enough to compensate for the price. Also, props for this place being right next to Fat Tuesday. I will come here again and again every time I'm at Vegas :)

Be prepared to spend about $20 for a lobster roll and if you have a big appetite the lobster roll will not fill you up.  But you do get a pretty generous portion of lobster on your roll and it is quite tasty.

The lobster roll is mostly the bun that is split open at the top, but isn't open enough for the lobster goodness to be inside the bun.  So the lobster goodness just sits on top of the bun.  So you think you have this deep bun full of lobster goodness, when really you better watch how you're holding that bun otherwise your lobster goodness is going to fall on the floor.

4702295,2014-12-13,1,6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,"DISCLAIMER: The photos are deceiving! The rolls are at least 1/3 smaller and the large generous pieces of lobster meat are non-existent. To add insult, the prices have increased.

It's really a shame. If you look at photos posted just a year ago, the rolls are stuffed with a heaping of lobster meat, even full pieces of claw meat, and looks absolutely tantalizing. The roll we got was small (think a thick slice of bread - like Texas Toast folded in half) and it was barely filled with chopped up lobster meat. So, what happened? I want to know where were my lobster claws and why was I robbed of lobster??

Original Maine Style Lobster Roll ($17): Chilled lobster meat mixed with mayo and spices and served on a toasted, buttered brioche. Accompanied by a side of lightly dressed cole slaw. The bread was soft and flavorful and the lobster meat seemed good. It was nice with the freshly-squeezed lemon. Again, I would have really enjoyed it if there was enough lobster meat. There was too much bread to the amount of lobster and we actually had a couple bites with NO lobster! This was really disappointing for the price.

We opted for the Fries + Drink combo (+$3) and went for Cajun Fries (+$1). The beer-battered fries were crispy and delicious. The Cajun version was well-seasoned and I loved the addition of chopped scallions. FYI: If you choose a fountain drink, it has unlimited refills.

Lobster Mac & Cheese ($12): This was just okay. The pasta was dry with not nearly enough sauce and the lobster meat was, again, skimpy. There was nothing special about this dish as it wasn't flavorful and there wasn't enough lobster to taste it within the dish.

The Lobsicle ($14): Lobster tail on a stick and it's available grilled or fried. I went with fried which has a light coating of their beer batter and it's served with melted butter and lemon wedge. This was absolutely delightful. The lobster was cooked nicely and the batter was crispy. I loved the fresh lemon juice and butter for dipping. 

I really did enjoy the food, however, I don't like feeling cheated, so I can't say I'll return or recommend the ""World's Best Lobster Roll"" (meh).

I told my friend, ""I'm hungry."" (This is a common scenario...)
He said, ""There's Lobster!"" 
I said, ""WHAT?!!#!@$#@! Take me there now!""

We show up and I'm staring at the menu trying to figure out what to do with my life and what to feed my life with. 

FOOD - 3.5 Stars: With much anticipation, I ended up choosing a lobster roll and lobsicle.

Lobster Roll - I was really excited to get this, but kind of let down. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious. However, I was had higher expectations. The bread was toasted really well and buttery. The lobster was good, but instead of having pieces of lobsters, it had what I would call shredded lobster. There was plenty of meat, but shredded meat. *sad face*

Lobsicle - This was a surprising item. You have a choice of getting the Lobsicle either grilled or fried in a tempura batter. I decided to get it fried like the healthy person that I am. When I first got it, I was a bit underwhelmed because 4 ounces of lobster looks relatively small. After the first bite, I was like WHOA! It was so damn good and full of flavor! it was crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside. No shredded lobster pieces here. ;) LOL. I'd definitely get this again. Maybe next time I'll get one grilled and one fried so I can enjoy the goodness of both!

SERVICE - 4 Stars: The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions. Yes, I asked a bunch of questions because I wasn't quite sure what to get. I was finally able to narrow it down and place my order. I grabbed a number and waited for my food to be delivered to our table. The worker even brought us some Tabasco when we asked for some. Overall, really great service.

ATMOSPHERE - 3.5 Stars: There's not really enough seating. It's right next to a Fat Tuesday's, which always has a long line. There's only a few tables unless you want to sit at the counter at Lobster ME. So, it's hard to really enjoy your food. My group was lucky enough to swoop in and grab a table.

RECOMMENDATION: Lobster ME was a surprising find here in Las Vegas. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since it is Las Vegas. I will come back and try other items on the menu. I'd think twice about the Lobster Roll though... I'm hooked on the Lobsicle though... like madly in love. So, check them out!",2WNF5PiFkBmMlKFcxiijZA,14,11,4,WO7NHsVoy8Gh1DcB2R1saw

I am not a slaw eater so can't tell either way. It wasn't soggy or overwhelming. The fries were delicious. I didn't even use ketchup. It's fried golden crisp and had a nice flavor of salt and other ingredients. There are chunks of lobster in there. The sandwich is kind of small for what they are charging. Maybe they can make he roll bigger and add some other filler in it like zucchini or something. It's $21 for the sandwich so it's not cheap when Chipotle is $7.50 for their bowl. Soda will run you a couple bucks but they have free refills. They are busy so you have to wait for them.

I think they should just place it in the front counter and let customers help themselves.

Service is friendly. They bring the food and drink to you even. It's 5 foot away so we could just as well do it ourselves really.

- The Beltway lobster roll (lobster, shallots, chives, panko bread crumbs), 4/5: at first I was sad by how small it was compared to the picture on the menu board but it actually ended up being quite filling/rich. Decent amount of lobster but needed slightly more seasoning. Side chips and coleslaw were meh. 
- Chowder fries (fries covered with clam chowder, cheese sauce, and bacon), 3/5: FYI this was not advertised as having bacon in it, so my vegetarian friend ordered it but then wasn't able to eat it because there were bacon bits mixed in everywhere. Tasted good but nothing extraordinary, although adding Cajun seasoning (you can ask for some) did enhance the flavor.
- Lobster grilled cheese, 3/5: mostly a grilled cheese with tiny-small amount of lobster. As far as grilled cheese goes, it was quite delicious but then again, I wouldn't pay $10 for just a normal grilled cheese.

My wife is allergic to lobster, so I don't get a lot of lobster rolls at home.  Not that I could anyway - we live in San Diego, where good lobster rolls are hard to come by.  That's why I googled away - I had some time, and, having spent some time in Northern New England, I love a good lobster roll.

That's what I first said when I noticed the Lobster ME counter in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. But I don't mind being proven wrong, as the missus (who is always right) will attest.

Lobster ME serves what they bill as the ""world's best"" lobster roll, and having eaten my way through New England with a single-minded focus on that region's delectable seafood, I would say they're pretty darn close.

Their Original Maine Style roll is served on a toasted brioche-style split-top bun packed full of delicious crustacean that is seasoned with just a hint of mayo and lemon, and their mix of spices. The missus had the Cajun version that was seasoned with a blend of Cajun spices and spicy butter. Both made the perfect lunch and were rife with savory but sweet lobster meat, with mammoth claws topping each sandwich.

We elected for the combo that cost just under $20 each and was served with tater tots (or fries) and a soft drink. The tater tots were not spectacular, and were akin to what you might buy in a bag in your grocer's freezer aisle, but they were crisped to crunchy perfection.

I would have tried the lobster ice cream that was also on the menu, but they were unfortunately out of it. I will, however, definitely stop by in the future when I am in need of a quick bite in this area: I would like to sample their lobster mac and cheese, and am somewhat tempted by the ""lobsicle"" (a fried lobster tail on a stick), but their breakfast menu and a promise of lobster and waffles really intrigues me.

Lobster ME is located down the corridor from the Halo Bar towards the mall's south entrance, or just head straight down the south entrance past Earl of Sandwich and the PBR Rock Bar & Grill.

They also offer free wi-fi: just ask them for the password, which they will print out for you on a register receipt.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,0,0,4,RYVE8FI_4KgsT_-ScxvWlw

Was just there with a bigger group that I dragged along. We wanted the Bloody Mary's (obviously) and figured we would give the food a try. In total we ordered the lobster mac and cheese, lobster roll, and chicken fingers and fries (I know but I wasn't in a Lobster mood). The mac and cheese was tasty but a small portion for the price and the lobster roll same thing. The chicken fingers were gross but the fries were good. I asked for ranch when I ordered but they didn't give it to me so I asked again for it and she told me it was a $1.50! Ok..... so she brings it to me and my change (they charge tax so it was $1.63) and it was a tiny cup of bland ranch. Really??? Seems stupid but that totally turned me off.

the lobster is caught in Maine and flown to Canada for deshelling/freezing, then flown to vegas twice a week.  there is currently only one location; however, they will begin to franchise soon.  Lobster ME is due to open in Santa Monica sometime.

i had a discount from the miracle mile coupon book.  buy one large lobster roll and get a 16 oz draft beer free.  the lobster roll that was in the window was an extra large.  it didn't look that big.  so we tried the large lobster roll thinking that we would only get one bite since hubby and i were sharing. 

we were wrong.  there are actually big pieces of lobster tail in the sandwich.  the buttered bread was slightly toasted; lobster was added afterwards.  the lobster was actually not one piece but more like two layers lightly salted and spiced.  you get roughly 1/3 lb of lobster in your large roll.  we enjoyed it very much.

The manager, was very nice I'll add, and offered my man and I, a sampling of the New England Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque Soups. The NYCC, was OVER salty. My gosh. A tad too overpowering, for the basic taste that soup can offer. The Lobster Bisque was good, but not comparable to seafood restaurant quality of course. Both were at the right temperature. 
We decided to split a sandwich and chowder fries. The sandwich had about 5 large pieces of lobster chunks on it and the bread was toasted and seasoned. It just didn't have enough sauce, the lobster could have had some flavoring or be butter-dipped and the fries were just okay, with the sauce/dip kind of thrown atop, but mainly coating just a few of them on top.

I liked the spice on the roll, and it's stuff full, so the amount is not an issue.

The tater tots are okay, better than say, Sonic, but just okay.  The entire meal is $27, which again, I don't think it's worth.

What was even worse were the stupid chips served with the roll.  They were completely stale.  Some tough, some were soggy, but all were downright wrong.  Just give me a freaking bag of Lays already.  At least those would be crispy.  

Service was also a big downer.  The guy at the register was polite, but he kept getting corrected by the rude gal behind him.

There is a decent amount of food court type seating also serving Fat Tuesday, but if it's all taken, you're SOL.

Ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. 

Lobster is good bc nature made a bug stuffed with delicious meat, which makes it even more egregious that it couldn't save the sad, soupy Mac and cheese it topped. An insult to the lobster that gave its life for this!

Maybe it was an off day but the sauce was thin and gritty bc the cheese wasn't fully incorporated into the sauce, nor was there adequate roux, if at all, to start the sauce. 

The result was a mass of bland noodles with the occasional sad speck of coagulated cheese stuff, topped with crunchies and lobster meat. All the flavor ended up in the soup at the bottom of the container. 

For $16, you can do better elsewhere.

I used to love this place and always looked forward to going here when I was on the strip. This is no more. 

This place has progressively gotten worse each time, unfortunately. 

First, they kept changing the sizes of their lobster rolls, then they changed the bread, the seasoning and now the whole thing is just not good. 

There is less lobster and the bread is stale and small. They used to serve awesome lobster claws on top, this is no more. Everything about this roll is screaming ""What did you do to me!!?!?!?"". And I know why it's screaming that. 

Also, their lobster mac and cheese is always super cold. They should mention this to the clients if this is their intention. Even the clam chowder tastes more like it's been preserved and not fresh, also served in a stale bread bowl. I feel bad for talking this place up and sending people here. 
The service is good, and the cleanliness is fine. 

I've been in denial for too long. My love affair in the last year with this place has dissipated. 
This is  no longer my favorite place to go on the strip. :(

It's way overpriced for what they're offering now. When they started, it was worth the price.

I dunno, it wasn't all that. 

Located in the Miracle Mile Shops in planet Hollywood, and open all day.  Claim to have ""the worlds best lobster roll"".  I have to disagree, and this is based on taste, type of meat, and possibly luck.  

Maybe I was unlucky to get an off-night lobster roll.  It was filled with claw meat, didn't get too much tail in my roll.  It's very lightly dressed, and while that may be a ploy to say,""we're not going to hide our fresh lobster taste!"" what it ended up doing was make it painfully obvious that the roll was drenched in butter.  Lobster rolls I'm used to are more like lobster salad on bread.  And when I said filled, I didn't mean filled like bursting at the seams, I just meant that's what thye filled my sandwich with.  The bread to lobster meat ratio was something like 3:1, and it was tourist priced as heck, actually everything is here.

My wife got the lobsicle and the lobster ice cream.  I would describe the lobsicle as a split lobster tail tempura skewered and fried.  And the lobster ice cream was just a mild vanilla-ish ice cream with lobster meat.  It was ridiculous, like $5 for a small.  Don't get me wrong, I like weird Filipino ice cream, with corn and with cheese, but this just wasn't for me.  

I'll eat here again maybe, but I probably won't get the lobster roll.  I'd probably just get the lobster and chips, but more likely, I'd save my appetite and my skrilla for Boiling Crab or Hot n Juicy.",tQOVsJoOYwoPMIGkkPIfDA,1,1,3,HQGUaen_Iw74gKZz0H-Qmw

Lobster ME seemed like a place that would fit our need and requirements perfectly, and I must say, after having experienced it. that it certainly did.

It's an odd concept, to have a Fast Food lobster place.  Fast food and lobster doesn't seem like it should be in the same sentence, but these guys made it work.

After peeking around at the menu and at other people's choice of foods, I decided to try the Lobsicle (lobster tail on a stick) and my husband went for the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  We also ordered a side of cajun garlic fries, just because they sounded exciting .... :)   The price was somewhere around $12 for each lobster dish and $4 for the fries.  Slightly above average when you consider the fact that it's fast food, BUT .... there's lobster involved, so even though it's cheaper than going to a lobster type restaurant, it will still be pricier than your average hot dog stand.

The food came out quickly.  My lobster tail on a stick was battered and deep fried and was served with a cup of butter,  The batter was very tasty, on the sweet side and it complimented the lobster very well.  
The lobster mac and cheese was DA BOMB! I never knew lobster and mac and cheese belonged together in the same bowl, but obviously I'm terribly mistaken because it was a pairing made in heaven!  The sweet lobster, the macaroni and the creamy cheese sauce ..... It was just a very, very good idea!

The cajun garlic fries were tasty BUT ... do not eat if you're looking for a date or looking to score at some point that same day.  Just a word of fair warning.  The cajun spices provided a welcome kick, so we both enjoyed this side dish.  

We'll definitely be back here for more lobster in the future.  It's a convenient and quick lobster fix that can fit in to anybody's budget, and so for what it is, I think it's a great idea and a great place to stop for food.

So I presume you are coming here for Lobster right??  How do the rolls compare to the ones I've tried in Boston/Maine recently?

Here's what I ordered : ""Maine Style"" Lobster Roll ($17): Touch of Mayo, Lemon, and Secret Spice Blend. This is very good! More seasoned than the ones I've had on the East Coast, but very flavorful with sweet and tender Lobster! 

The others I have tried are all pretty simple and plain...just butter and maybe a touch of mayo.  You don't need much more than this to have a great roll!  But Lob ME does a nice spice/rub on their lobster, that adds a great taste to it, without being too distracting.  

I saw they also have a cajun rub, which might be good...gives me a reason to come back and try it!

It might feel a little expensive at first, but these are actually cheaper than most places on the coast (avg was $20-25), even during lobster season!!  The fact that it is located in the center of the strip as well, makes the price seem very fair IMO!

Check it out and see for yourself :)

We got the Connecticut style lobster roll + a cup of clam chowder and a drink for $21+tax. 

The lobster roll was nice and buttery and the bread was nice and toasty, but still soft. I was surprised at the tenderness of the lobster and the subtle sweetness it had. The clam chowder was just aiet. I used to live on the East coast so no clam chowder compares, but it was nice and warm, which really hit the spot.

I've had the experience of having fresh seafood on the East Coast, and nothing on the West will ever compare to what you get in cities like Boston. But, I believe Lobster Me tries hard to make their seafood tasty, and what they do with their seafood works for them. 

Conveniently located in Miracle Mile, I was able to walk here from my hotel room in about 5 minutes. Lobster Me is an order and pay at the counter type place, which worked for me!

All three people in my party who ate here ordered the Original Lobster Roll. This was their no frills roll -- filled only with lobster, a couple of their ""house"" spices and stuffed in a delicious piece of bread. Each roll was $24. Pricey, but you're in Vegas!

Our food came out in about 5 minutes. I really enjoyed my Lobster Roll and thought the lobster was fresh for Western standards and very tasty with all the spices they threw on the meat. But, the two other people that were eating with me were born and raised on the East Coast, and both of them said the lobster was only ""ok"". One of them didn't like the spices that they put on the lobster and she even picked some of the lobster pieces off and didn't eat them. We all agreed that the bread was delicious though.  We also ordered a side of fries and we all really liked the fries as well.

Overall, just your average seafood place. Nothing special, but nothing horrible either. Check it out when you're in Vegas since it's worth at least one visit!

The lobster mac and cheese was a very cheesy dish where you could barely distinguish the lobster on top because the cheese sauce was so sharp.    the lobster and chips had deep fried lobster pieces that were completely dry and chewy from being overcooked.  I did not try their lobster roll but based on the ""specialties"" I can't imagine it being anything special.  according to my car mates the lobster grilled cheese was pretty good and their fries were alright.

The mac & chz itself wasn't all that great either. It tastes like the premed Bob Evans mac & chz you buy at the grocery store that you just pop in the microwave.

My friend got the lobster roll, I forgot which one It was. The roll was literally like 3 inches long. & about 2 oz of lobster chunks. It also came with a side of chips & coleslaw (which she never received).

I stumbled upon Lobster Me while walking through the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood and was craving an open faced lobster sandwich, so I thought why the heck not! The employees taking your order are very friendly, patient, and are very informative about their products. I ordered their large Lobster Roll, my sister ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese, my other sister ordered a Shrimp Sandwich and my mom ordered the Lobster Ceviche. The total was $70 + which is quite expensive, but I guess that the price you have to pay for lobster! 

Lobster Roll on an open faced toasted bun - Good, but definitely not like the ones we have in the Bay Area! The lobster didn't seem as fresh and to be honest, I thought it was sort of dry. I wouldn't skip it and would definitely give it a try if you're craving lobster.

Lobster Mac & Cheese - OMG so good! The dish was perfectly creamy and I was surprised to find a ton of lobster pieces, which was really nice for the price you pay! I could seriously eat this all day.

Shrimp Sandwich - I thought it was going to be fried shrimp, but I was very wrong. The shrimp on an opened faced sandwich was quite disappointing as I found the shrimp to taste frozen and definitely not fresh. Don't quote me on the frozen shrimp, but the shrimp was nowhere near fresh!

I didn't get to try the Lobster Ceviche, but my mom said she hated it. $70 for fast food lobster is no bueno, but it was nice to see a fast food seafood option in the Miracle Mile Shops!

They'll charge you the same price for a lobster roll in New England anyway. $17 for a regular Maine-style lobster roll or $23 for large. But wait, if you're local, you get 20% off!

Seating wise...it is off of the strip and we came in on a Saturday evening (10pm-ish) so it was quite packed which is why we took ours to go.

I ordered a lobster roll that came with fries and coleslaw. Service was pretty slow considering there was one other table of two sitting there waiting. The fries were just ok, coleslaw wasn't very good, and the lobster roll was very bland. Looking back, the guy taking the order asked what sauce I wanted on it and I said I'd just do the butter sauce to keep it traditional and let the lobster shine. Maybe this place's specialty is the fun sauce they top the rolls with because I felt like the roll was lacking in flavor. The lobster tasted fresh, but it really needed the squeeze of lemon to make me want to bother to eat it. Later both my boyfriend and I didn't feel so hot and this was the only thing we ate....so I'm left to assume it was this lobster roll.",gJfMbl0xULJyHl2gJZEyVQ,0,0,2,fKg3kUMMH6Jubo_y1kXCcA

You get what you pay for. The lobster isn't the freshest, but it's not bad at all, and it's a good value for what you pay for.

I didn't opt for the lobster roll, but it looked pretty good.

RANDOM but this place showed the best customer service I had in Vegas this time around. The 2 cashiers we came across were nice and chatty (not invasive and awkward at all!) They must like working here :)
=======

We got:
Lobster bisque ($9) - comes in a sourdoughbread bowl and serves 2. Comes piping hot. Wish there was more lobster flavor, but hey, can't complain for the price. It was a'ight.

Lobster tacos ($14) - meh. I was trying to be a taaaaaaad healthier but regretted it right away. The lobster was kinda dry (I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be fresh.. but still - again, fair for the price) and the tortilla/salsa was pretty whatever. The salsa came in a small serving cup and was probably canned. It comes with chips so it makes it seem like it's a better deal, I didn't have any though. The portion was pretty satisfying.

Chowder fries ($7) - THIS WAS MY FAVORITE THING! It's just chunky fries with cheese and clam chowder, simple but oh, so good (not good FOR you of course..). The fries were big and seemed double-fried so it held up to the chowda and cheese. The flavor was spot-on.

The very mention of such an opportunity will make me pop up like a meerkat, alertly demanding to know the ""Whats"" and ""Wheres"" of such a possibility.  Mind you, I'm not going to eat anything like sour cream and onion flavored crickets (which are quite horrifyingly real, and I saw a pack of some this week), but I'm pretty open.

Cue Lobster Me.

I love seafood quite a bit, and have been wanting to try this for months, but I started normally with their lobster bisque.  Served in a bread bowl, and chock full of yummy lobster meat, I devoured it, and quickly.  It was quite good.

Then came the ""weird"".  Lobster ice cream.  I know.  Fish and ice cream.  It doesn't sound like it would be a good combo.  But it was actually very sweet with just a hint of a salty aftertaste.  And there are decently sized chunks of lobster in the ice cream, but they aren't ""fishy"" or overwhelming in flavor.

Meal selections seem to be about $8-10 an item, so select a choice or two and go (sharing works, too).  I want to try their lobster mac 'n' cheese next, and a few other menu choices.

Not a regular dining selection, but a returnable venue for me.  The concept may not work for everyone, but I had fun trying something that made more than a few friends raise their eyebrows at me.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,5,2,4,4TTL2Ydopdu8YcJ6NgJkXQ

I ordered their classic lobster roll, which was $17 including chips and cole slaw. Expensive by New England standards, but hey, it's Vegas and lobsters don't exactly grow on trees around here. :-)

The sandwich was very tasty, albeit a bit on the small side, again by New England standards, but it was adequate for a meal. The lobster was sweet and tender, and there was quite a lot of meat and just the right amount of seasoning. The chips tasted home made, as did the slaw. Service was fast.

I didn't try the lobsicle, which is one of their featured items (think lobster tail on a stick that you dip in butter) but some people sitting next to me ordered one and it looked yummy. Be aware, however, that it's a really little lobster tail...like 2 or 3 ounces tops.

I came across this place on my last Vegas trip after my friends and I had just finished eating at Earl's. The lobster ice cream sample sort of lured us in, but they didn't have any at the time, so we figured we'd try it next time we were here. So on my most recent Vegas trip this past weekend, my best friend's boyfriend suggested we try this place out.  Lobster ME is located right next to the Fat Tuesday place, so a bit towards the middle of Miracle Mile. There are tables located in front of it, but keep in mind, this area can get packed so be prepared to fight for a table. 

While looking at the menu, I was pretty much drooling - lobster mac and cheese, lobster grilled cheese, lobsticle, different kinds of lobster rolls, and more. No joke, the lobster mac and cheese was pretty much calling out my name and saying ""eat me nowwwwwww."" Couldn't pass that up. I ended up ordering that, along with a side order of tater tots (if you've read my other reviews, you'd know that I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tater tots) and a drink. My total came out to be $17. 

My meal came out about 10 minutes or so later, freshly made, steaming with goodness. The bowl of mac and cheese itself doesn't look like much, since you pay the price of $10, but seeing that it is made with lobster, it's somewhat understandable. The mac and cheese was a bit bland in my opinion - like they should have added more milk or something to it since it tasted a bit watered down. The lobster was good though! No doubt about it. And since I was pretty much starving, I didn't really mind TOO much that it was a bit bland. Tater tots were awesomeeee. Crispy and hot - just the way I like them. 

Service was okay I guess. I mean, you just order and they call you up when your order is ready. Prices are a bit much, but it IS lobster. I was already expecting the prices to be around that much anyways. Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. I probably would come back and try something else.

We were a little disappointed at the size of the lobster on a stick. Pretty small for ~$14 but I think it tasted good? 
Lobster mac n cheeze is huuge for $12. A little too cheezy for me, but I liked the amount of lobster on top. Just couldn't finish it with all the oil and cheese at the bottom. I think this is a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get.

I like how it's a ""fast-food"" seafood joint. Here's the goods and bads:

Lobster grilled cheese was bomb. Totally worth the price it was cheaper than lobster roll. 

Lobster Roll Connecticut style: really good! The lobster meat was chunky and abundant. Heads up this roll is pretty small. Much smaller than the pictures but it's still filling. But if you're a big dude order two. 

Difference between Maine and Connecticut is the Maine is cold lobster and Cont. is warm lobster in butter sauce.

Lobster Mac and Cheese: thick shell pasta, cheesy and delicious! A good amount of lobster meat. 

PASS:  Lobster Bisque: more like Lobster WATER!!! Bisque is usually thicker and have chunks of lobster and veggies but this one here was the opposite. It was straight watery lobster soup. Skip it.

Blueberry lemonade was sweet and yummy!

Tip: if you add a combo you can substitute the drink for a beer for $2 more!

We ordered the Cajun roll after asking the register girl's opinion and it came out to ~$25... Most expensive sandwich I've ever purchased. But my girlfriend reasoned that it WAS lobster so I bit the bullet and waited it out. 

MAJOR disappointment! First off, the large size is only 6 inches. 6 INCHES. I could buy 5 Subway foot-longs with the money I spent on this dinky roll! To be fair, it was absolutely stuffed with lobster meat and 3 claws on top but the meat was COLD. I was appalled. Probably my fault that I didn't ask the waitress if it was going to be a hot or cold sandwich but I didn't know that cold lobster sandwiches were a thing. 

If I were to come here again, I would order a non-roll item like the tater tots or the mac and cheese because the roll was WAY underwhelming and WAY too much for my wallet. 

Side note: A guy fainted face first on the tile floor and banged up his chin while waiting in line behind me. Not sure if it was from the sky-high prices or heat exhaustion and dehydration from his Fat Tuesday. Either way, be sure to mentally prepare yourself for these menu prices!",KjLjePO5TKKhmdo4ZwxKHA,0,0,2,cW77DwW2i-FdEH_WDsvV2w

Hey, I'll make room.

So, walking around Planet Hollywood shops, we stumbled upon Lobster ME (as in abbreviation for Maine), adjacent to a Fat Tuesday. If I recall correctly, this space was previously a Godiva. Front and center, they immediately claimed to have the world's best lobster roll. Oh really. I needed to find out for myself.

They have some other unique items, like lobster and eggs, lobster and waffles, lobster grilled cheese, lobster mac 'n cheese, and the lobsicle (gasp, another lobster-on-a-stick version, similar from the truck I just tried back home in OC). Plus, they have... wait for it... lobster ice cream. But I'll talk about that a bit later.

So with a belly stuffed with Earl of Sandwiches, I managed to make enough room to try their lobster roll for $16 (plus I split with several people). That's for the regular size. If you want a bigger size, it's $22. The lobster roll is pretty decent. I've had my fair share from the East coast, fancy versions from LA restaurants, and plus from an LA-based food truck. So all kinds of lobster rolls.

This lobster roll had a nice and toasty, buttered roll, with a slight crisp. Inside, it was stuffed with plenty of lobster meat from the tail. On the outside, they put the claw meat. This lobster roll isn't mayo-based, but with butter -- just enough so that it's not overpowering the meat. Flavor-wise, I thought it was fine. No need to over-salt, fancy seasonings or sauces.

We tried a small sample of the lobster ice cream. It was pretty disgusting. It was like tasting a mouthful of butter ice cream with little pieces of frozen lobster chunks inside. Intriguing, but just not a good combo -- but it gets people talking about it though.

So 3 stars strictly just for the lobster roll. Everything else on the menu? Eh, not so sure if it's worth trying. But hey, I'm a purist when it comes to lobster. Simplicity is everything. Lobster should be consumed steamed with a subtle touch of butter. You want to taste the meat.

The lobster mac and cheese was alright, but void of any real lobster meat, although it was garnished here and there with some of the same lobster pieces they used in the bisque.  

 I ordered a long island iced tea and the cashier kept trying to push this fishbowl vessel on me.  I'm a local and I will not be seen walking around holding and drinking out of a fishbowl.  The drink was mostly sweet and sour mix  anyway.

The bun was not buttered or toasted and the meat was not seasoned. It was all just so bland and the price was higher than Luke's (although coleslaw and fries are included, whereas with Luke's they are additional) for a fraction of the quality. 

I did like that you had options for you roll ""style"" (Cajun, The Connecticut, The Beltway etc) should you feel like getting creative and you can swap regular waffle fries for crab fries (which I did.) They weren't bad, but the sauce and the meat makes them soggy almost immediately.

We were walking around the food court and I was hankering for some seafood. A lobster place with bad reviews was kind of a dicey choice. But then I took a chance and loved the spice in the Cajun roll. A pretty decent amount of lobster meat and lots of flavor. However, it will only serve as a snack and not an entree. So if you are looking for dinner, skip the place",l1rG-X_xLHo47vB2JHvUpA,0,0,5,XNok0d1wHLuB3txvhV3OxA

LM is the only thing on my brain when I am over at Miracle Mile shops area at Planet Hollywood. 

Mmmm yum yes! Lobster Roll me up baby!

This is the location I frequent the most here in Las Vegas, ok so I was out with a group for dinner and a show, there were five of us at the time. The Staff had no issues getting our big ass order together. (Dan was super cool and patient with us)

We ordered a lot, no holds barred this night.

Lobster Roll
Fish and Chips
Lobster mac and cheese
Lobster grilled cheese sandwich something, it was Amazing!!! 
Chowder bread bowl
Big basket of crunchy fried chips/fries
Slaw 

This visit was crazy but fun, I wish I could eat here every day but I know is not practical. I don't think I could ever get tired of their menu seriously.

I highly encourage ordering my three favorite items, lobster mac and cheese, fish and chips and lobster roll/sandwich.

In my opinion the prices are standard, I mean you get what you pay for, I think the quality is high and worth what you get. This is a specialty meal menu, you can't find Maine style lobster rolls or lobster mac and cheese on every corner.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,9,5,NHglgrYmOWRnJGDh9OxWrA

When I cam back and broke that high-end munchie open... threw the roll in the microwave for a few seconds and put all the ingredients together as instructed. Yes, I had my roll deconstructed so as not to ruin the late night snack attack experience. It was perfectly spiced and the lobster was meaty as well as a really good amount for the price.

My beef with lobster rolls (pardon the pun) across the board is one just isn't enough! They do pack a solid amount of lobster into these rolls. Lobster quality itself was good, but not melt in your mouth exquisite.

I've eaten here several times and I rant and rave about the place but now I'm stuck with my foot in my mouth.
Starting with this soft and soggy grilled cheese that smells like gross ocean, and tastes like a ""old tuna sandwich"" you better not unless you want to be sick. How could you treat your local resi like this.. :(
 I kind of felt like I was sold the left overs! 
The mac and cheese was horrific! Watery, no cheese, ""fishy smelling"" lobster. I was in shock that I was given this CRAP! The macaroni shells and cheese is different. Also there use to be a breaded crust like topping
Lobster roll also had fishy smelling meat on it. In case anyone was wondering, sea food should NOT smell fishy! Weird, yes, but very true.

I digress...

This place is one of the better quick dining options in the Miracle Mile. I hate to call this place fast food but it does Flt the category for a quick lunch.

I have done both the original an Cajun rolls here. My personal favorite is the Cajun. It is just the right amount of spice yin to the sweet lobster meats yang! The original is your basic lobster roll: chilled lobster meat tossed in secret sauce. 

There is a third version on the menu that i am too much of a coward try; it goes by the name of diablo. Call me silly but I want to enjoy the lobster roll and not have it blowtorch my tongue while I'm eating it. 

Lobster rolls are one of my favorite sandwiches but there are not many places in town that do them. So being that said I get my fix here..",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,4,2,4,u33ej2ksVpi5CWLjOh3T-g
