Clean, well stocked and always a friendly crowd. Sean always makes sure to serve us as soon as we walk in and is always charming. Thomas the cook is amazing and takes pride in his food and is super sweet. Thomas also likes to talk sports with my husband which is nice touch. Happy hour is on point and the atmosphere is chill. Overall, this is the coolest PT'S in Vegas just based on chill factor and kindness. This says a lot because we like to drink and we like wings.

1340605,2014-06-20,0,Z8nyLyhdC0Fn5PkOZeDoGg,So we show up here to get something to eat it was nine in the morning door was locked no problem will ring the bell the buzzer to get in ring ring ring ring no answer ring ring ring ring no answer so after waiting a few minutes ring ring ring then the bartender comes on the intercom to say you guys will not be getting n ringing the buzzer like that or reply was like what? We've been sitting here for over 5 minutes is what I said she said no you haven't I been watching you guys so the question is why are you watching this instead of allowing us to come in to eat breakfast definitely bad customer service this bartender should be fired,R9TIWPBlMuzzWgYXZBnAlg,1,0,1,pTOo0TPbPJ7gYw1PG02NDA
1417358,2014-11-07,0,Z8nyLyhdC0Fn5PkOZeDoGg,Low key kind of place. Really good pastrami sandwich with good beer choices. Won $45 on the black jack machine. Pool tables at $5 an hour. Great bartenders. More than you could ask for in a sports bar.,FWKRDexWtT7ucCBvK8L86w,0,0,4,GMX2NSqGLsZ_NpJUryFufQ
1461755,2015-11-17,0,Z8nyLyhdC0Fn5PkOZeDoGg,"I just had lunch at this place and was amazed by the $11 burger that was smaller than my index finger in width!!? Wtf!!! They should call it a overpriced slider..

Then the place has horrible ventilation, smells like a old ash tray. Very dull, non attractive environment and the music is horrific!! I would not recommend and based on the 2 1/2 star rating, I'm guessing that I'm not the only one who is less than amused with this place! 

The food was good but for the portion it was over priced, my burger was the size of a $1.50 cheeseburger from McDonald's! Definitely quality over quantity, which is fine if the environment of the place didn't suck! The place is dead and once again stinks like an ashtray, this place needs better ventilation and music!!!!

Don't believe, just review my pics of the lackluster view of this place and the mini burger!!!",hWY534z1dIo_67ogS0l5hQ,0,0,2,KJZC1dBixjS-BZ2_tVQmvw

1742927,2017-06-17,0,Z8nyLyhdC0Fn5PkOZeDoGg,"My wife and I have been going to the Sahara & Nellis location for years. Always good food, drink, and staff. This recently changed. See about two weeks ago PT's corporate apparently decided that the patrons who come in to eat and drink really don't matter that much. They have cut the food menu by more than half. They no longer have club sandwiches, no chicken fingers, no italian pizza, etc. The PT's food czars have spoken and the public apparently don't matter. Let's only serve the best sellers, not offer a large variety of items to choose from. Still love the staff and bar selection, just don't agree with cutting the food menu to the bare bones. Might have to start looking for another place to eat, drink, and gamble. Rewards customer No. 331502.",IkOZBUV-_FQU77ePUb58vA,0,0,1,Bb-cZNMdRIpxnwz9O3csbA

1860513,2018-06-09,0,Z8nyLyhdC0Fn5PkOZeDoGg,The bartender here I asked for the check he still hasn't brought it. When I asked him for an ipa and asked him for his recommendation he gave me one and said go with that choice cus it doesn't taste like burnt popcorn. Ummm sorry old timer IPA is what the young people drink. Hater. And I asked him where he was from before this rude comment he made he ignored me. Also when I asked for my change at the end he ignored me said nothing and took a long time to go get it.,Y8l4k6oxQuoiKe4O3xEoBQ,0,0,2,ezQshQiLYVgcWOvUdTjqnA

Takes her 10 minutes to get my drink. Another 30 minutes go by and I realized I am really hungry and my burger still hadn't arrived. I get up and she asked to close out my tab. What the heck, tab, you should be paying me for wasting time. Her only reply was ""I don't know what to tell you"". How bout you need to fire yourself but before you do that, have a performer assessment with who ever hired you and tell them you are sorry for your deceitful interview.

Sorry I  don't speak bad bartender Ryan.  Thats what I overheard his name was,  he didn't introduce himself.  Other than my crappy service my food was delish!  The lady that brought me my food was awesome, brought me my sides right away.  It took me 7 minutes to get my check...and that's 7 minutes of me trying to flag him down when he wasn't but 5 ft in front of me.

But as the night progressed his attitude didn't seem to change. It seemed like I was bothering him cause he was hanging out with some friends.
Like excuse me?! Anyways. Besides his service I love pts, doesn't matter which. I just like the happy hour and the pool tables.
I hope I don't get him again next time I go back.
But what can you do. I'll still come back, it's literally right down the street.",G19JJVKk-R2HHjKp9AkoVQ,0,0,2,qqdeV1d8vZ4H03L5985bFA
