From the moment I walked in employees were yelling over counters at each other and one was waving bagels in the air!
 When I went to order it went pretty smoothly, but when I got my bagel it was completely messed up. And the two other people there orders were wrong too. They remade mine and I was in a hurry to get where I was going so I left, just to find out that they made mine incorrectly AGAIN!! I was tired of dealing with these people but even if they didn't get my order wrong two times the service alone was enough for me to not go back.",suPIiDo2pcIdRV1H9nPP6Q,1,0,1,Bv9kLlgrw6da8_kSjzy2yg

I typically can get in and out of these places in about ten minutes tops, but they were slammed this morning. And that's okay! I worked as a breakfast waitress for 3 years, so I more than understand the busy morning struggle in the food service industry. BELIEVE ME people, no one working in a breakfast establishment cares about your petty problems. Ever. I gave them my order and waited about ten minutes before a handsome black guy came out and told me they were out of the bagel i wanted. totally fine. reached a compromise together. waited ten more minutes. I heard the barista call out my name and gave a bag to another lady in line with my same name, even though the lady was -at least- 6 people in line behind me. I continue to wait ten more minutes. As this point I have been waiting in Einstein's bagels for upwards of thirty minutes. When I addressed the issue to the counter, the girl in the hat admitted she must have made a mistake and then walked away. AGAIN, totally fine. it happens. My problem is that the ONLY worker who cared to remedy the situation was the handsome black guy. No one was helping him take the weight off of all his orders he was making.The manager himself didn't even seem to care. My problem was not with the mishap, but with the lack of team work I saw at this location. If the manager or corporate is reading this, please find said handsome black guy and give him a raise or something, because he made my morning so much better.

You people are so nice. AND there is always an issue here.



Because you ""no longer have thin bagels"" you have to cut the big ones down! WHAT?
AND then, the deal is, you run out of Everything bagels in the morning, a ""fresh"" batch comes out and the ""bagels are to soft to cut,"" this was the issue with our breakfast this am.

And then you there at Einstein Eastern, you seem to sell out of bagels when we go at least once a week- YOU SELL OUT OF BAGELS BY 9 AM...? WHY? Isn't this poor planning? WHO BREAKFAST BAGEL PLACE SELLS OUT OF BAGELS FOR BREAKFAST? 

This is getting old Einstein Bagels. 
Why do we keep going? 
My 16 year old loves the thintastic egg white, mushroom and asparagus creation you serve... Plus, the service is lovely, minus the lack of food you run out of. 

You are always apologetic and so kind... It's quite amazing.

I went there for breakfast and after a small debate between my eyes and tummy I ordered The Cheesey Wakin'Bacon and a frozen carmel drink.  The sandwich was good but the bacon seemed a little more fat than meat. It also tasted extra salty but who doesn't love salt?  They were out of the Chessey bagels that normally come with the sandwich so I choose an asiago bagel instead.  It turned out to be a good choice as it quickly settled the debate my eyes and tummy were having and made the rest of me smile too. I wish they had another alternative to real milk and soy milk. Perhaps coconut or almond or hemp milk as a healthier alternative to dairy and soy products.  The staff were friendly and helpful. They did bring our drinks and food to our table.  The store was clean and if they were to add another choice other than milk and soy I would consider eating here again.  If you're looking for the perfect breakfast place in Las Vegas I'm sorry but this place won't sizzle your bacon so keep looking.

We decided to give them a try since it's near my house and when we entered, I noticed that all of the tables had crumbs on them! None of the tables were cleaned while we were there and there were many chairs not pushed in either.
As for service and food, the gentleman helping us was really nice, took our order, rang us up and made our food. He looked like the only worker there at the time so maybe that's why all the tables were left a mess. My boyfriend decided on the Pizza Bagel with Pepperoni on the Six Cheese bagel and I went with the Green Chili Club on the Jalepeno Bagel. Both were perfectly made, really warm and fresh when we got them as well as having a hefty amount of toppings and ingredients. Yum! I'll definitely be back to this location since it's near my place, I just really wish it'd be clean next time. It's kind of unappetizing eating on a dirty table (well I cleaned the one we used) but it's also kind of gross to be eating and looking at messy tables and unswept floors (I noticed lots of crumbs under tables as well).
As for some deals they are offering right now, on Mondays you can get 13 bagels for only $6!

This particular location was either having a bad day or they really need to get their act together. Our order wasn't complicated. Several bagels... Some toasted with regular cream cheese... Some toasted with blueberry cream cheese. Got two coffees as well. Paid for food.... And stood there. The person that took my order was the same person that processed my credit card. She couldn't figure out why I was standing there. I told her it would be nice if I had cups to get my coffee. Keep in mind it had been literally less than a minute since she took my order. Got the cups, got coffee... Sadly it was lukewarm at best. We have ordered in many of the Einstein bagel locations over the years and know how long it takes to get the food out. This place was not busy.... And the food took about 10 minutes to come out. They got the blueberry cream cheese bagels wrong and used regular cream cheese. OK I'm a bit upset now. I go back to the counter and tell them my order is wrong. Another customer with an incorrect order was near me and saw that I was up there for the same reason as her and as we made eye contact, she muttered to me ""good luck with getting that fixed. Clearly she was upset at her order being screwed up too. Anyway... They take it back and say they are very backlogged with orders at the moment. I get the replacement bagels about 5 minutes later.

I seemed to have stumbled upon and found myself in a love affair with another. Two of them in fact, called Einstein Bros. I know they've been around forever, but it wasn't until recently I started making this my morning stop for my caffeine hits and freshly baked fare. 

Their coffee's a nice change. It's self-serve and bottomless. They usually have four different roasts: Neighborhood Blend, Neighborhood Decaf, Vanilla Hazelnut, and Melvyn's Dark Roast, which they also use in their iced coffee option. I'm all about iced coffees, but I prefer to make my own using their Neighborhood Blend. One prominent difference from the green mermaid -- no burnt after-taste and for the budget-minded, it's like $2.15. For the coffee snobs, think of it as two notches above McDonald's coffee. 

**Pro tip: Purchase one of their nifty plastic traveler mugs for $2.99, then subsequent visits for coffee refills is only $1.19-- love it!!**

Sign up for Schmear Society to receive special coupons. My welcoming gift was a free bagel and schmear (with any purchase). My favorite bagel is probably the Asiago, but I also like the Spinach Florentine (which has the consistency of a croissant than a bagel). It's good even without schmear, try it warmed instead of toasted. Everything is baked fresh, not coming from plastic wraps or boxes. 

Additionally, this location is a little better than the Sunset/Stephanie one which is super tiny. There's plenty of seating and is a good alternative spot to study until their closing time, which is around 4pm.

I will yelp that my taste buds cherish a toasted bagel with nova lox spread. When it comes to taste, my taste buds also cherish their bottomless coffee. Einstein Brothers Bagels have always served quality coffee. There are four choices of coffee that are unlimited refills.A nice feature is that the time the coffee was brewed is written by the coffee station.

  The $5.99 lunch special includes any deli sandwich with a medium fountain drink and chips or potato salad. A lack of a side item was a past complaint that I addressed.
