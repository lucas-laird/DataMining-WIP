The JC salad has mixed greens, vinigarette, feta and pine nuts. The fries are fresh. I order the BBQ sauce for dipping even though the fries have such good flavor already. I also really like the chocolate cake. The atmosphere is a little loud and a little dark but overall I will keep eating here.",hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ,0,0,4,-MpQ6FnoNflWNVg1ET7A_g

I read another review stating this and I couldn't agree more, except the waitresses at a real Hooters are usually much more fun.  I live around the corner and yet I rarely go because of this factor.  I've only ever been with my husband and we would both much sooner drive down the road to Red Rock.  

The food is hit or miss.  The drinks are expensive.  I am giving this two stars instead of one because the last time I went the sandwich I ordered was pretty good and the waitress was actually very friendly.  Maybe they're turning things around.",tHStf1qlliRe8iCcxjwK-Q,1,0,2,gK3hmogyYeaQuxK3_fryjg

Only two stars as the service was not good, inattentive and dragged. Server called me (50 year old female) ""hon"" and ""babe"" - gag, I can survive her lack of decorum, no biggie. She also sat at the table to take order.
Really crappy part, this is the second time I've been shorted on change when paying my check. Same waitress, not cool at all. I owned a successful restaurant/bar for 7 1/2 years, I know the business enough.
When you pay run over your check in DETAIL, if paying in cash recount your change. My last visit a $20 for a 5.50 additional tab was returned as $6.00 change - shorted $8.50. When mentioned she brought back $14 so still shorted .50 - whatever, we left.
Comfy neighborhood bar, great bartender, decent kitchen, cool location - owners seriously needs to tighten up service, get a handle on the money situation.",iimX6RwTcZSADAm-J6yPdQ,5,0,2,jB2NEJo2e7N-M81Wl-GnmQ

You can definately see lack of training between servers & there knowledge for food, reflecting the management, server couldn't remember a simpl drink order of 2 iced teas and one cranberry. Its been so many times we got served wrong food to our table in previos several visits, poor service. We watched our food sit in the window when we were the only patrons there. Once our food was delievered the server did not provide the adequate amount of roll ups nor plates (there were only 3 of us). Then the server disappeared and we had to pay our bill with the bartender of whom was on a personal call. Could she have placed them on hold??

service at this place!!!Our neighbor friends agree that it pays off to cross the bridge to go  the Yardhouse or BJs because we know we  will get GREAT service there! But it is such a convenient location for us, that we do stop in there about twice a year only to be painfully reminded why we should never return. If it weren't for the ""Steak Sundays"" and gaming,( which we partake in neither of) this place would  probably collapse. It wouldn't hurt to remove half of those high tables, then burn those stupid dangling plank window treatments that make an otherwise cozy bar feel like a dungeon.

Forget about coming here if you're a woman, the 2 meals I've eaten alone here were the worst. Service sucks in general however I noticed a few of the single men that came in were greeted with giggles and hugs - they sat at the bar. Inside is small, dark and tables are crowded together.  Food is mediocre. Best meal we've had was the Philly cheesesteak; worst was the French toast.

485341,2012-05-27,4,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"Went back to this place because it's close to where I live and tried the ribs that were on special, they were deep fried and AWFUL. Not enough enough meat on the bone, they were terrible. Like I said in my previous review this place is more of a casino than a restaurant, i'm willing to bet they make nearly all of their money on slot machines. There's plenty of loser Summerlin d-bags who drop a c-note in the machine so they can talk to some cute girl they think will might come home with them.

Like I said in my previous review virtually all of the food and drink is overpriced and sub-par. BTW, the owners have sold the restaurant to one of the girls that worked here, maybe it wasn't profitable enough.

I agree with ""Alex N."" in his review where he says ""I am convinced the wait staff at this place collectively share one brain that is meticulously stored in a jar of jager behind the bar counter.""

One of the girls that worked here sent me a message about my last review:

""I have to say reviews are opinions which are here nor there but yours was very disrespectful and hitting the fine line of slander. No employees are under the influence of drugs or alchohal or of any drug. These woman have natural personality and do not need the extra factor you so call speak of. Only one does such activities can accuse others. These women work hard, and do their best at the job. If you have a problem you should maybe not write about on the computer and actually speak to someone about it when you are there.""

I like how she couldn't spell alcohol correctly and didn't make much sense with her grammatical errors. I have actually spoke to someone about a problem here. I saw one of the patrons leave the bar intoxicated, driving dangerously fast almost hitting a man that was working outside late at night, only to swerve at the last minute to avoid hitting him. I couldn't believe what I saw so I mentioned it to the bartender inside, hinting that it's not a great idea to let patrons get so intoxicated that they could kill somebody. She said ""Maybe the guy shouldn't have been standing there"", I couldn't believe her answer.",A2NRQflAR6qPM_pbgAdfIw,3,0,1,yEOpGnpGHpJaCalKuv0h0Q

If you don't make it and you know it takes that long to brew then don't open in the morning. Or offer your customer a concession rather than charging $2.50 for a single cup of coffee because that's how long it took to get it. We aren't at Starbucks!

ATMOSPHERE: It used to be a quaint little place to grab a nice bite to eat in a quiet, relaxed, upscale place. It's gotten really tacky since my last visit. Cheesy decorations everywhere. Terrible hip hop music (which none of the 7 customers seemed to be enjoying). The menu looks like a drunk scrapbooker made it...it used to look a lot more professional. The back page of the menu is dedicated to the ""John Cutter Girls"", full of pictures of what appears to be the all-female staff in John Cutter tank tops. When I said tacky, I wasn't kidding (and I'm a male in my thirties...I'm pretty sure I'm the clientele they're targeting and it was tacky to me). I think maybe the owner of this place is a middle aged, horny guy with no taste. If not, then maybe they're targeting middle aged, horny guys with no taste for customers.

FOOD: The food was still pretty good. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, one of my old favorites. It still tastes great but it's a pizza now, not a flatbread. They should change their menu to reflect that. I probably wouldn't have ordered nachos if I knew the it was a pizza. The nachos were just ok, really sparse toppings. 

I used to think this place was great. I talked it up to my girlfriend before we went. What a letdown. I doubt I'll go back. If this place were to lose the tackiness and go back to being a little more upscale and slick, I think it would be better off. Oh yeah, and I'm pretty sure the bartender was drunk, which just added to the tackiness of the place.",CBhdWytmhNodVRXb_Vaqeg,5,2,2,LIelU1HJll6PWSkewZY3ZQ

It is in the neighborhood and I have been wanting to try it out for a long time.  They have a unique menu and a nice bar environment with a full bar.  There were 2 2 tops when we were there and about 7 people sitting at the bar.  

Food: Wings and Fries from Appetizer menu and A Fat Tire (Beer).
The wings were breaded and we asked for medium bc server said they were hot.  Which they were not.  We added a side of Ranch and Hot Sauce to make them more spicey.  They seemed like they were just re-heated or even pre-made.  I am a wing girl and live for them...was not impressed at all.  The only good thing is they were not small and had more meat on them then most places.  

Service: Forget servers name, its all women staff, she was blond with long hair.  She was really nice, sweet, good looking.  It took us 10 min after ordering our waters to get them.  I ordered my beer after we ordered the water and wings and it came out with my meal.  You can see all the food up (when its ready) and our meal sat there for a good 10 minutes (who is timing anyways).  She did apologize for taking so long bc she was ""cleaning"" at 10pm when the bar closes at 2ish and the happy hour starts at midnight.  Must have been pretty dirty...

Overall I would come with friends if I was staying in the neighborhood and just drinking. I would most likely sit at the bar too, if there is an open spot.  I am not knocking this place completley, I saw they have breakfast on Sat and Sundays so they can possibly redeem themselves.

Since the weather is nice I want to be able to bring the dogs and sit on the patio as well.  Hope the service wont be terrible there too.  If so I have no problem walking up to the barkeep/tender to order drinks.",UZBVDP_JNO-XvcVKoNDA6g,4,1,2,qjT1SNm7F4Jy5-JNsmrwAQ

However ... the front staff is not the greatest when it comes to service.

I pop in at least twice a week because the food is so good and it's conveniently close to home but the staff can't seem to remember my name or even want to take the time to learn it. 

Good food.. no doubt that's what keeps us coming back.

As always... show up for the 1/2 price Steak Sunday ... my friend and I pretty much eat out daily all across the local places in Las Vegas so we know what we are talking about when it comes to local Vegas eats.

Our last trip around we were not drinking too much... switch to water and Iced Tea which pretty much went empty as the waitress was too busy doing who knows what. 

We eat and before we are even done with our steaks, the waitress brings us our bill. No mention of desserts or coffee even offered. Seems as if she was more interested in closing out our bill and having us hit the road then stick around...

Luckily Dunkin Donuts is right next door... 

The last three experiences have been somewhat similar. I could certainly understand the attitude if we did not tip so well.... but we generally always tip well above 20% on every outing.

One last shot next ""Steak"" Sunday and if the service is the same... it may be time to look for other places where the front staff does appreciate us. That's what being local is really all about.

That is until our most recent visit earlier this week. It's been a few months since we stopped in, they've since revamped the menu. 

Krolly sandwich got the boot so my husband tried the chicken sandwich and he ordered dynamite rolls to start. Luckily I was still able to get the Philly.

The rolls weren't exactly dynamite, they were terribly dry on their own. The sauce helped a lot. The chicken sandwich was no better. Dry was the word of the day. He slathered it in ranch dressing to make it edible. Good news is the French fries are still tasty. Bad news is my Philly was a disaster. The meat was tough, the bread was dense and stale; it was dripping with cheez-whiz and it still found a way to be ridiculously dry. The salad used to be a favorite, they had a great champagne vinaigrette. Not no more. It was bland and way under-dressed.

We originally tried it because they are owned/operated by the same company as Sedona - and my mom is a local. 
 
The last time was just plainly ridiculous. JOHN Cutter has an identity problem.  It is a neighborhood bar/restaurant that wants to be a HOOTERS. 

Most of the food is ok (good french toast).   It is the service and atmosphere where John Cutter fails. The bar is too dark and the music is too loud for breakfast or lunch.  To see a family with a bunch of kids or a group of lady golfers come in and then be served by empty headed young women with their breasts literally falling out of their shirts is just embarrassing. 

The worst part is that either management has not defined customer service parameters - or worse, they know what is going on and are ok with it. Fail.  I think that Bill W. is correct.

I would seriously give this place zero stars however the food was OK, so I wanted to give the chef some credit because the food was average.

For anyone interested in a authentic ""Asian Salad"", this place isn't so perfect. However if instead of ""Asian greens"" you would like some ""shredded iceberg lettuce"", and instead of ""crispy asian noodles"" you would like ""dry roasted peanuts from CVS"", then this Asian Salad is a real winner! My fiance and I unfortunately wanted the actual Asian Salad so the iceberg lettuce w/ dry roasted peanuts didn't really hit the spot.

I had a BBQ Chicken sandwich and that was ok, probably the highlight of the meal. With regard to the service, it went from bad, to worse, to embarrassingly bad, to literally the worst experience we've ever had in Las Vegas. For example when we were ordering drinks there was probably a 3-4 second pause while deciding, and the waitress barked, ""so have you made up your mind or do you just want water?!!!"". There were also numerous other comments at the various stages of the meal that were just not what we're accustom to when we go out to dinner. How about a ""please"", a ""thank you"",  an ""is everything ok?"", or a ""do you guys need anything?"", etc, etc. We received none of this,even the check just came flying from out of the corner of my eye as she bolted by before I could order another beer, or we could order dessert!

 It felt like this poor girl was a displaced worker of the night who was really just wasn't happy in the service industry....I mean the ""food service"" industry. Anyway there are 100000001 places to eat in Vegas where you can get a good meal, good drinks, and good service at a good price, no need to go here unless you are too happy and want to get a little depressed over dinner.

If you want to open a restaurant, watch a few episodes of ""master chef"" first. No bueno.

1410914,2015-05-17,2,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"Went for Mother's Day here.  Ordered two steaks and two sides and two beverages.  The Ribeye came out with great flavor and quality for the price.  The filet came rare, when j specifically asked for medium:butterflies.  The waitress was completely incompetent and should be working as a gas station attendant, not as a server. She did not come out one time to check on the meal when it came incorrectly nor did she describe the menu/featured items to me when I told her it was my first time here.  I also had to get up out of my chair to flag her down for assistance when my steak came out prepared incorrectly.  It took over 10/15 minutes for them to reheat the steak (which caused me to eat the rest of my food so it wouldn't get cold).  When the steak came out it was more than well-done.   At this point I just ate it and paid the bill and left 15% gratuity that she didn't even deserve.  Some manager or maybe john cutter himself came to the table to ask how the meal was---I told him what happened and he just said sorry and didn't really care to have the problem addressed.   It would have been nice to have him come after the filet was reheated to ensure we were satisfied---oh well.  I will come back for the quality and price, but may need an extra beer or two to put up with the service.",nLxao0jgwBPuPXHrDriRmQ,2,2,3,RLt9WB9WWLUia4cSBiGSyQ

Greeting was friendly and warm from the bartender. Our server (Blondie) arrived with menus and announced it was Happy Hour, except that Groupon did not cover HH items - fair enough. Hubby ordered the Philly Steak Sandwich (in fairness it could have used more cheese), I got the Wings - hot w/ salad. Both portions more than ample and freshly prepared. I must say I loved my side salad. I really appreciate when a restaurant goes out of their way to make a nice side salad (Spring mix, diced cukes, halved grape tomatoes, pine nuts and feta). I focused on that knowing I could take the wings home. Blondie was very attentive throughout our meal and all of the staff thanked us as we departed. They were decorating for Halloween festivities.There are alot of great choices on the menu, we both agreed - we're looking forward to our next visit. Thank you!!....so funny, I just saw last month a review with said there was too much cheese on the Philly Steak Sandwich, don't listen. Like my husband said.

Ordered steak same way and the steak was wayyyy overdone and didn't taste remotely fresh.  I again told waitress~ to not be acknowledged again!  To me this is terrible customer service!

I must clarify by saying I have only been here on Sunday, which is when they have their all day 1/2 price steak special. 
I am actually on the brink of being a vegetarian, but John Cutters maintains that I never make the actual leap by luring me with its delicious cuts of never frozen meats.
I die a little inside with each bite of my petite medium done steak and whisper it words in romantic Italian. Okay okay, so I also highly recommend the JC salad.
The inside is small and dark with lots of dark wood decor, so keep that in mind when deciding what kind of ambiance you want to have for your meal. If you want something brighter and more cheery you are in luck! Recently they put in an outdoor patio dining area. This place holds lots of potential to be a great date spot, but not on Sundays. It gets pretty busy and you are only able to make reservations for 6 or more.
Drinks are always good, but pricey. Tall cans of PBR are a steal.

They came with fries, carrots and celery. This was the highlight of the meal. The fries were cooked well, seasoned perfectly, and the wings still had some crunch, and the sauce wasn't over done. 

I ordered the Ranch Chicken Sandwich and requested a change of the breaded chicken to grilled, which they accommodated just fine, but the chicken wasn't in one piece.  It was two thin pieces of chicken stacked on top each other, and the one piece was actually two or three laid together. I needed to keep the toothpick in the bun just to keep the sandwich together to try to eat it. Eventually, I gave up on the bun and just started cutting the chicken with a knife and ate it with a fork.

I chose the salad for the side, since we already had fries with our app. I asked for ranch instead of the champagne vinaigrette because I was unsure if it would be too much, but the cooks made it the same as usual out of habit. The salad was overwhelmingly coated in the dressing, and they loaded it with so much feta cheese that the flavor was too much to handle. I would have preferred the spring mix with ranch and nothing else compared to the overloaded and overdone salad that I got. I also noticed that I wasn't the only person that the cooks didn't pay attention to because another patron of the restaurant had to send their side back because they had asked for something else.

The server we had (it said Blondie on the receipt) was excellent. Friendly and cheerful, despite feeling overwhelmed from being the only server in the restaurant.  

The bartender, Renee, on the other hand, should be fired. She had an attitude on the floor and was cursing a lot. I don't care what kind of day you have had, it's inappropriate to act that way while working. You shouldn't be cursing about the guests either, even if they are people you know.

I ordered the carne asada flour tacos with rice and beans, and the whole order came out unusually dry. The cheese on the tacos was already cooled and the meat was hard and dry with no seasoning. The rice and beans were the same...there was a shell of hard crunchy rice, and part of the refried beans were so dried out it crumbled.

Three of us went there on Sunday the 18th for the steak special. We got there about 3:30 and it was about half full. The service was quick and friendly, but the food - Ug. All three of us ordered the bone in Rib Eye, done medium. I used to come here frequently and the steaks were always good. I don't know what grade meat they are buying but all three were full of sinew and gristle. Cutting them was a chore because they were so tough. All three steaks were done to a different level. One was medium, one was medium rare, and one was close to well done. All three of us left almost half of our steaks on the plate rather than fight with them. No comment from the server when picking up the plates. My wife concluded that they may buy a lower quality of meat for the Sunday half price special. $17.50 for a bone in Rib Eye steak is a good deal.

The decor and actual restaurant was nice, but for the place not being all that busy, the service was awful. We were there for over a half hour before they even took our order (2 breakfast burritos with bacon instead of sausage and a side of avocado). It took another 45 minutes for us to get our food and when it arrived my friend's order was incorrect because our waitress apparently had put in 3 burritos, not two, and the first one was missing the sauce it came with and the second one had sausage not bacon. They also forgot the side of avocado and when they finally brought it out it was old and brown. We finished eating and had to ask a different waitress for our check since it was now going on 2 hours and we couldn't find our waitress. When the waitress brought our check, she still had the 3rd breakfast burrito on the check so we had her remove it and when she brought the check back it had said they removed both the avocado and 3rd burrito due to ""customer complaint"" which seemed a little odd and rude, especially since we didn't even order a 3rd burrito.

We were not the only ones struggling with poor service. We witnessed one couple move from their table outside to a table inside and then to the bar after waiting for so long and other couples just left. We also saw someone come in from outside to ask for to-go boxes and their check because they had been waiting so long.

Their steaks are some of the best I've eaten in town.  They don't have a freezer on-site so all the steaks are bought fresh and moved out fast.  On Sundays, all steaks are half off.

I miss eating their steak and eggs breakfast (which is available any day) and going for a hike out at Red Rock.  It's an excellent value for only $11!  They don't give you a shit piece of steak that's paper thin, full of fat & gristle like a lot of the casinos advertising cheap steak and eggs (to get you in the door to gamble.)  

I like the darker interior of the restaurant and the large and somewhat secluded booths.  As for the service, I've never had any issues with any of the servers.  Skinny Jen is my favorite waitress there and has always done a damn fine job!

The only single issue I've ever experienced was one time we decided to sit outside on the patio on the far left side of the restaurant.  We had to move as we could smell the dumpster located in the parking lot due to the wind blowing in between the two buildings.  We were relocated to a different table outside and enjoyed a fantastic meal.",0E2Q9mJsMdQ0hRkKTVWuag,9,8,4,5AOSTc8vA98RYNJQlGx4jQ
2379471,2016-01-25,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"If you're craving steak (especially on a Sunday) this place is a must! I had heard good things about JC over a year ago, but I didn't wanna make the 40 minute drive from Aliante. A girlfriend and I agreed to make the journey over the weekend and boy! So worth the drive!

On Sunday, all steaks are half off. They offer three different varieties: NY, filet or ribeye. We both chose ribeye, which is normally $35. Typically steaks come with fries or a salad, but on Sunday you have to purchase sides separately. We settled on cheesy mashed potatoes and skillet mac and cheese, which were both $7.

The steak was incredible. Tender, juicy and packed with a ton a flavor. Not to mention, it was huge (18 oz). It definitely brought me to a happy place.

The sides are described very well in the menu. When you think cheesy mashed potatoes or skillet mac and cheese, it sounds like you're in for a real treat. Not so much. The cheesiness from the mashed potatoes come from a slice of Kraft poorly melted on the top. Underneath, the bed of mashed potatoes are real potatoes, but they could use seasoning, milk and butter. The mac and cheesy is nothing special. It's tasted better than boxed mac and cheese, but for $7 I expect more.

The service could use some work. I ordered my steak medium well (crime, I know) and it came out close to rare. They put it back on the grill for a bit longer, and it came back well done it most places. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and specifically asked for them to not make it spicy, and it was spicy. I told the waitress, she did nothing. $10 down the toilet.

My wife didn't receive her dinner of steak and potato. Mine and my buddies steak was crisp, and so over cooked it was dry and stiff. Our Lobster tails were extremely small (2oz) and straight up cold and rubbery. We asked for our meals to be redone and our waitress finally sent them back. Meanwhile we sit there and wait. About 10 minutes later we receive our plates back, but no lobster. Just a steak on the plate.  WTH!! This whole time, my wife has NEVER had her meal brought to the table! Complete BS and I told the waitress and she said she couldn't get it from the kitchen?! I'm pissed and told her so. Finally after everyone is almost done, my wife's steak is brought to the table. She liked it and was finally happy. Because the Saturday special of Lobster and steak comes with no sides for $19 I paid that price for just a steak. Once it was brought to the table, yes it was indeed good, but damn! So many missed opportunities to have this a good meal.

2593079,2011-08-13,8,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"OK, so John Cutter is a prime example of ""If you build it, they will come"" logic.  The Vistas sprout up and then this place came along.  Living here, I had long avoided it because of the magnetic pull of the place to SUVs, sloppy cougars, and the men that solicit them.  It just seemed like a place to avoid, which is unfortunate since there are no other real restaurants west of the 215.

Then along came the groupon and I thought, maybe I should try it since it is so close.  These are the things I have learned in doing so:
-The menu is printed in the worst-of-Vegas style with one page of drinks and one of food and 4 pages devoted to the ""servers"" (use of quotation marks definitely meant to imply irony).

-The servers are really only hired on the merits of their cup size or degree of time spent on a hair-and-tan ratio.  They will rarely know what is on the menu, they will put your order in wrong, they will be confused about many things.  It is important to know this going in; Don't even try to place a to go order by phone.  If you can sit at a table covered by the Asian server, do so; she is the only one in a few visits who is always on the ball and gets things correct the first time. I am awarding a star just because she took the hassle level down here big style.

-The bar kind of melts into the four booths that are the restaurant side of the room.  It is a surprisingly small space.  If one person lights up at the bar, the entire place will wreak of smoke.

-The happy hour ends at 6pm which is kind of backwards.  Be aware of this fact.

-DO NOT GO HERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT unless...you are going to sit on the patio and listen to questionable dirty-t-shirt type of live music.  IF you are inside they will simply crank the poorly-curated music to combat this.  The result will be a loss of appetite (why so much Justin Beiber in the rotation, why, for love of all that is good and sacred, why?) and  a loss of hearing.  Everyone indoors will start yelling for their companions to hear them.  It's not a good system...

And now maybe a little bit about the actual food here?  
-Whoever said the food is ""mind-blowing"" needs to get out more.  The food is average, decent for bar food.  Due to the servers' low aptitudes you don't always get things as ordered which is a pain in the ass when you order a burger rare and it comes to you well done.  Or you order dressing on the side and your salad arrives weighed down by it.

-When the food is ordered and delivered correctly it is OK.  But damn if it is INCONSISTENT.  Lunch is your best bet, followed by Monday through Thursday EARLY dinner.  If you go in on a Friday night, the size of the food will be halved and there is no manager to ask about it.  On  the other times, the helpings will be almost double as large.

And last but not least, why this place is actually getting a yelp review from me...the sacrilege that is the Philly cheesesteak items (sandwich and fries).  As a Philly native I know that I am going to be more prone to being offended by these things, but frankly, putting mushrooms into the mix is just sick and wrong.  I love mushrooms, but they have no place in these recipes.  Onions, yes, but you put too little in there.  Peppers, add them please.  I won't even get into how your cheese sauce is so off the mark.  But for the love of all that is right in this world, stop with the mushrooms already.",Wa_dytXjCuUri4CJsKSd3w,8,4,2,XgDD0A4rdNSRcfq_p56i4g

So here we go....we walked in and no hostess was at the door. A server brushed by us and quickly muttered the hostess will seat you momentarily. So we stood there in the doorway waiting. Finally the woman who spoke to us figured out the hostess wasn't coming and sat us herself. 

Next...our server arrived. In unpolished form. Very unprofessional in appearance, speech, and attitude. (perhaps JC should hire on ability and not on whether or not you have breast implants and a mildly cute face)
She then took our orders. 

I joined their text message coupon service and showed the server that we have a coupon for a free drink. (which later when the bill came was not free. She forgot)
We ordered an appetizer. It came rather quickly. That was nice. But alas again. No plates or utensils. 

Food arrived. We had ordered the 18oz ribeye which was huge so we decided to split it. No extra plate to cut it on. Wonderful.

Not sure why they put so much yellow cheese (instead of provolone, etc) and way too much cheese. 

Anyway, I might try this place again since it's close to our house.  I'll review / update after then.",4DY1zLS6qBpBM6EmLOdjwA,0,0,3,8Akj8YyQ9XN7AoGhv8Z0nQ

If it hadn't been for the girl coming on shift I would have given this review 5 stars. A short unattractive black haired mess strolled over to our table looking like she needed more crystal meth and hugged the guy I was with. Fell into his lap and said she needed a ""nappy nap"" 
I walked inside got a manager told him she was strung out and to please get her away from my table. I went to the ladies room and came out to have her glaring at me screaming I would be 86'd and never to come back. 
No. She needs a rehab. Gaming bats are infamous for unsavory situations. 
John Cutters gets an upper class crowd however Mr Corrigan should match the staff. And he should probably drug test them. 
My guy friend went back the other day and told me she was even worse. She is short with short dark hair I wish I knew her name. She is an embarrassment.

So good, it's used in at least four different dishes. It's in their queso; it's in their Philly cheesesteak; it's in their Philly cheese fries; it's in their mac & cheese; and who knows what else. Seriously though, there Philly cheese fries are pretty amazing. Other than that it's pretty standard bar food. So I must complain about their chicken fingers. Disclaimer: I usually don't order chicken fingers anywhere because I think it's a lazy way to feed kids but if in a bar and with kids, and especially with kids who never get chicken fingers when we eat out, I ordered them. Much to my disappointment they were completely overcooked. By the looks of them they were already the frozen variety. So there wasn't much to cooking them except to watch that they don't--I don't know--get overcooked! It was so disappointing. On the rare occasion we actually order these things I want them to be delicious and just like we eat them every other time before which is usually, delicious. They were so bad and dried out that even my kids couldn't finish one. What kid in the history of American food eating has ever not finished a chicken strip. My four-year-old even asked me when the chicken nuggets were showing up. So I had no other option but to complain. The waitress just shrugged and asked if we needed anything else. To add insult to injury, the chicken strips were the only thing we did not finish and yet the most expensive thing we ordered, and we still had to pay for them.

3611687,2013-08-05,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"We often frequent John Cutter after a morning hike out at Red Rock on the weekend because of its convenient location and good food. Okay, okay....I guess you can say that the female servers (the JC Girls) that they have there is another reason why we visit! 

Here are some more thoughts on this local pub/sports bar.....

THE DECOR (3 out of 5)
This tavern is usually dimly lit and has the blinds closed to most likely provide for better viewing of the flat screen TVs. There are a few booths on one wall, a long bar with seating and in the middle are probably at least a dozen or so high tables. Fortunately whenever we've gone there the place hasn't been packed because its a little hard to maneuver through the high tables area when and with a full house I'm sure that would make it even harder to get around. I would think that they should remove one or two of the high tables to provide for a little roomier feel.....instead of being packed like little sardines in a can.

THE FOOD (4 out of 5)
What really has us coming back is the food. They have a good Philly cheesesteak sandwich (including a breakfast version with eggs), and when there are football games playing, they will usually have several specials going on. So it's really worth it if you're there during football season.

THE SERVICE (3 out of 5)
Okay, this is a really hit and miss one with John Cutter. Sometimes the service is great with our server being on the ball to see if we need anything else. However, there are times that we've had to wait several minutes to get refills on our drinks. And no, those haven't been times when the place is packed. I just think that the servers need to walk through the dining area every so often to make sure that you've got everything that you need.

OVERALL (3 out of 5)
John Cutter is still worth stopping by on your next trip out to Red Rock Canyon. But I really think that there are some simple things that they could do to make it a more pleasurable experience.",JDXcf0qEwoeo8fx9TlPMeA,2,1,3,oBye7i_7JxjYzI1QtQQW9g

They have a small out door patio area and we like the fact that they do not allow smoking.  We enjoy gaming and know the ""rules of engagement"" for complimentary beverages; minimum buy in of $20, max coin bet along with continuous play.  We settled in and ordered two appetizers off the menu to share which we both enjoyed.  As the day shift bartender was getting off shift we settled up for our food order and tipped her out before she left.  We continued to play awhile longer on the swing shift.  When we were done playing we got up to leave and the new bartender on shift points out that we have a tab for our beverages.  I have to tell you I was speechless.  We were not ordering doubles, top shelf liquor or team gambling.  My wife had three well cocktails and I had two due to the fact that I was driving.  Granted, I do not consider ourselves to be big time players by any means, but I know we played a hundred dollars between the two of us.

4142783,2013-12-17,4,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"John Cutter is a fun little restaurant! It is totally A-Ok in my book.  Here's why I think it is ok:

1. Decent size menu with a lot of interesting options.  Lots of your traditional stuff with little twists to make them a bit different from the rest.  We went during breakfast, so I will focus on that for now.  A couple of examples of fun food would be the breakfast quesadilla, crunchy french toast, and a breakfast Philly cheese steak. I looked over the lunch/dinner menu and it has a lot of things that looked tasty as well.  It isn't a huge menu, but ok overall.

2. The flavor of the food.  I had the breakfast quesadilla with steak and I was quite pleased.  You get a huge serving because they use the biggest tortillas ever and layer them instead of folding them in half.  The quesadilla was stuffed full of eggs and cheese with an ok share of steak sprinkled throughout.  It could have used a bit more steak, especially for the $5 surcharge to add it, but overall it was pretty good.  The tortillas were crispy and held together nicely, even being stuffed.  My hubby got the crunchy french toast.  It was a fun twist on your average french toast.  It didn't blow my socks off, but it was average.  My hubby really enjoyed it though, for whatever that matters.

3.  The prices.  The prices all seemed to be a $1 or 2 too high on the breakfast menu.  The food was ok and with good sized servings, but it seemed a bit high, especially on the kids menu.  The kid's breakfast is $7 and the lunch/dinner kids menu is $10.  I guess they are going for a more upscale place with the prices, but they just didn't seem to fit.

4. The interior is pretty, especially right now with the Christmas decoration up.  There were big wreaths along the wall, huge snowflakes everywhere, and even some mistletoe!  It had a rustic cantina look mixed with a bit of modern leather accents.  It really was nicely decorated.

5. The service is on the mediocre side.  Everyone we talked too was super friendly and polite.  The problem is they were also absent most of the time and a bit on the ditzy side.  My hubby had a cup of coffee that was never refilled or even offered to get a refill, and the same went for my glass of water.  We were checked on about half way through our meal and when the check arrived, but that was it.  I don't think we are demanding, but a refill every now and then is more than reasonable in my book.

So over all, John Cutter has some good things going for it, but it has some misses as well.  The food is tasty, but a bit pricey.  The interior is lovely, but the service level is hit or miss.  When you average everything out, I think 3 stars is a good average.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,11,6,3,86kO1Ko2Fp4LOYPUJU934g
4175501,2015-02-14,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out because of the cute patio and some of the people's food looked pretty good- especially the fries.  I stood at the podium for almost ten minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge me.  Finally a waitress had to walk outside to check on her tables and she greeted me and gave me two menus.  She ended up giving my friend and I good service but that start almost had me give up and leave.  I wanted iced tea but weirdly they had none made that day.  On a beautiful day out?  Kind of strange.  My friend ordered a chicken wrap that had avocado in it and a side of fries, and I ordered wings and blue cheese that apparently also came with a side of fries or a salad, and I ordered shrimp tacos.  My friend ate all of her wrap and we shared her fries.  I liked the texture of the fries- they weren't too skinny and had some of the potato peel still on them.  The fries were hearty if that helps describe them.  The wings were good but way too salty.  I had to use the blue cheese to help drown out the salty-ness.  The wings actually seemed like they added pepper to try to calm the salt but it just was not working for me.  Don't order the wings here.  I ended up getting salad with the wings and we asked for ranch on the side of the salad.  We ended up getting ranch with the salad at no charge, but the salad came with some kind of house dressing on it.  I didn't complain but I also did not eat the salad.  I didn't particularly care for the dressing or the cheese bits in the salad so I picked at three cucumbers in it and left the rest.  My shrimp tacos was a very large order of three tacos.  I requested avocado in them which I am glad I did.  The sides with the tacos were a pico, a refried bean dip and Spanish rice.  The sides were okay.  The rice was a tad bland but still okay.  The shrimp in my tacos were shriveled (over-cooked) and also very salty.  This place loves salt I guess!  Total bill with 20 percent tip was $50 for two girls (two entrees and one appetizer.)  Not too awful but probably won't go back unless I just want fries.  It just wasn't an impressive place.",vepRbwKOq3KuN7VSB3PEcA,0,0,3,nJHUBI0T_0SMkbItYoh86w

4191676,2010-05-16,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"I've been told about this place for the last year, mainly by my regular cab driver (you can't possibly live in Vegas and think you can have a bloody mary or 3 and then drive home) who drives one of the bartenders from here.  

Having tired of the tasteless food at Red Rock after bingo, we decided to venture over the I-215 bridge and try it out.  

1st: it is NOT fat friendly if you are on the hippy side.  They only have 3 types of seating.  Outside skinny bottomed armed chairs; inside you have your choice of high-boy bar chairs or cramped booths.  So just a bit of a warning before you go.  

While we were seated quite quickly (in the ever shrinking cramped booth) our waitress was very slow getting us drinks..a standard Bloody Mary and a beer.  
We were on the fence about the menu but it was, after all, a bar.  
My dinner companion ordered the surf and turf..surf being 2 large lobster tails and turf being a huge ribeye.  Appx 35.00 for the plate.  It comes with a side salad that our waitress repeated after each entrée order was placed (down to the pine nuts).  I ordered the steak fajita tacos with a side of Mac & Cheese.  My son, who was left at home, called in his order for pork chops which are on the web menu but apparently have been removed from the actual menu.  

Surf & Turf:  I had a piece of the turf (surf allergy) and it was FANTASTIC.  The rib eye was cooked to perfection. Tender Juicy and spiced just right.  

Fajita Tacos:  Even without the standard condiments of salsa/sour cream they were delicious.  The meat was tender, delicious and in abundance topped by just the right combination of onions/peppers.  

Side Mac/Cheese:  light and flavorful.  Not your blue box variety, but a very nice blend of white cheeses in elbow macaroni.  Served in a steel pot.  

If you can squeeze into the booth, don't mind the airheadedness of the wait staff and their continuous need to be posers, the sticker shock of the bill (2 drinks, 3 entrées, no dessert - $120.00), then it is well worth it for the food.  

I will go again but will make it a to-go box while I sip my coffee from the fabulous Dunkin' next door.

Update:  We've been back 3 times since I wrote this.  Got take out for the steaks.  Still no ""regular"" seating outside.  It's sad because we are stuck on steak there and they probably have other good things but until they fix their seating situation my little group will never find out.  Note: you cannot be 6'8"" and sit in the high top chairs.  it just doesn't work.",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,1,1,3,B_TIZBLPelR6rBdRCoRz8A

My husband who likes his well done said even his was tender and juicy even though his was cooked well. I like getting the fully loaded potato with my meal. The potato is huge enough to share but there have been days where we want two sides . We flock to the Mac and cheese as our second choice.

My girlfirend and I do enjoy the 1/2 price steak on sunday, and you get one hell of a baked potato if you choose to order one. We have been here several times and the food has been good. 

Now for the bad. We came in on a sunday about 230, sat at the bar and there was 1 other guest at the bar as well. Our bartender Jenn H. greeted us, took our drink order all the standard gaming bar etiquette. Asked for menus, take time to start gaming, talk for a second, haven't gotten to menu, she comes up 2-3 mins later says "" do you know what you want?""
We say no. Ask her to give us a minute. Comes back, gf orders a steak mid rare, she walks to the terminal, comes back, I remind her she doesn't like the chili oil, back to the terminal, asks me what i'd like, I say same steak, chili oil is fine.... she literally walked back and forth to the terminal to take the order.... Our order was 2 steaks, a salad, and steamed vegggies... rocket science i know. Gf cashes out to move machines, gives us the wrong cash, she throws the wrong amount back at my gf, we say umm still wrong, she says.. ok chill. It goes down hill from here. Shes saying you're trying to punk me, getting aggressive raising her voice... 
short story long, this girl is clearly a pill head, and spun out... manager was soooo busy he couldn't come speak to us. We had to flag him down. He tried to shrug us off... all in all this was one of the worst customer service experiences we've had at any of the local gaming bars.

""Thank you very much for the review. 

It seems we did not meet your expectations at JC. i would like to address some of your comments if i may. I take all comments very seriously and try to address as many as possible personally. 

JC was created as a neighborhood bar with high quality food and beverage in a very casual atmosphere. All of our meat is Certified Angus Beef which is just one step below prime (very expensive) and is never frozen. in fact JC dost even have a freezer. Unfortunately, our prices reflect the cost of our investment and the very high rent for the location. 

I hope you will reconsider your review. 

Thank you.""

I won't change my review, but Yelpers might consider visiting John Cutter after reading this message from their management. When I come visiting my youngest in a couple of weeks, I don't plan on re-visiting...",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0,0,3,seNdgwKhcj_d3LUebxiGeg

The sauce was a little sweet so I didn't finish the ribs but I would get it again with the sauce on the side. The blueberry lemonade was good - they're not skimpy on the liquor which is always a positive. The menu had a lot of nice choices and it looks like a meal with appetizers will run about $30 on an average day. There's a late afternoon and late night happy hour. Nice atmosphere with large bar area and outdoor seating. I'd go back,FxezzTBPCvEZEju5CrNKdw,1,0,3,THsYqqkIRtCJWZtHhHs08Q

4573811,2009-02-28,1,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"I went during their first month a while back and I am still stung over how the prices on my bill did not match the prices on the menu.  Maybe it was just a glitch - but WATCH OUT.  The prices are too high and the quality and service just don't make it worth while.  I had the salmon and it was fishy gross.  I should have sent it back, I should have never gone in the first place.  The other people in my party who ordered the steak also thought the quality was extremely poor.  They are not selling you a good steak here - they are are selling you a poor quality piece of meat for a high quality price.

It's a shame since this restaurant is so close to where I live - and there are a lot of people on this side of town who want quality food - just check out how packed the Italian restaurant in the same shopping center is.  I would go again if they changed their menu and lowered their prices.

Also, I find the new high reviews to be a little sketchy.  The portions are not huge enough to merit the price.  I am always skeptical of yelp reviews where it is the user's ONLY review. *Edited to add: these obvious shill reviews have been removed*

Oh and here's the cherry on top of this whole experience.  The owner decides to insult me via Yelp with the following message:
""It would appear you have five star standards but a budget more suitable for quick service and fast food.  I do hope you choose your future eating establishments more wisely and find a restaurant to your liking.""

This place is pathetic and they have been disappointing everyone I know who has gone there.  Watch out what they charge you!  This place is shady and the food is bad.

2012 UPDATE:  The Owner ""Adam C"" just sent me another petty message via Yelp 3 years after my original review was written.  Too bad he can't spend his time improving his restaurant, because several other people have trashed this place on Yelp.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,2,0,1,WyHLFe8Z0eTs-rfw1FG4fg

As for location and feel, John Cutter's has it right. Easy to access, outdoor patio with occasional live music, and a large, open space inside. But that's where I stopped being impressed.
I was told by a few ""regulars"" of this establishment that the food was mind blowingly good. I always take such statements with a grain of salt, and for good reason... And as I type this, some salt prolly would have helped some of the food a bit. 
I had the Chile Relleno, given that this was a Tex-Mexish menu. My parents got the Lobster and Ribs. My Chile Relleno had about as much flavor as loofa covered in cheese. The Spanish rice was bland at best, the beans were runny and just plain sad. The Chile Relleno it's self was cooked well, but lacked any flavor or kick. It tasted like no one in the kitchen has tasted it in quite some time. I also got to have a rib and some of the lobster. The ""famous"" ribs had a BBQ sauce that massively overpowered the meat. BBQ sauce is good on ribs of course, but the meat should have some kind of flavor! The sauce should be the sidecar to the meat's tender motorcycle, but this was more like a tandem bicycle with two chimps peddling. The lobster was also cooked well, but lacked any wow factor. Even dipped in their butter sauce I still wasn't wowed one bit.
The best thing I actually tried here was one of the salads that had nuts in it. It was well dressed and had great flavors that worked well with each other. But if you pride yourself as a respectable Eatery and your best offering is the salad, something's gotta change.
I give John Cutter's 2 stars, one for having a good IPA beer available, and one for the other 4 pages of the menu.",QIrJKF0cJ04Vasv-rxOQ3Q,1,0,2,bxPT6BBLSVrZnQ5WyrdVcg

...my first experience with this venue was this evening, Sunday, which is 1/2 price steak night.  Understandably, the venue was packed.  NOT understandably was the fact that 2/3 of the food we ordered never came, including one of our steaks! The potatoes arrived after the steaks that did manage to find their way to our table but the salad, along with a steak and the asparagus sadly must have been lost in transit.  When we attempted to voice our concerns to the manager, (after having asked to speak with her multiple times) she finally arrived at our table immediately ordering one of our party to calm down and another to sit down ( he had simply gotten up to go look for her at the same time she was arriving) and advised that she had already heard our complaint from the server and wasn't interested in hearing it again.  She offered to remove the items not received from the bill (seriously? Does this not fall under the category of 'duh'?) and offered a gift certificate for the inconvenience of the inconsistent service. Not surprisingly, we never received the gift certificate. She then attempted to discount the incredibly unacceptable service by indicating a full house and new staff. Young lady, Management 101: YOUR staffing issues are NOT the problem of your patrons; accept accountability and attempt to accommodate your clientele with respect and dignity. The only reason I gave this venue 1 star is so that my review would be posted. If enough patrons complain about the abysmal service this venue obviously considers acceptable, perhaps actual management will review its process and make some adjustments.

What's not understandable...the hostess rolling her eyes and acting as if I'm bothering her when I ask her if there's an eta on when they may take tables...or her annoyance by my suggesting I sit at the bar and have a few drinks while waiting...was told I wasn't gambling so I wasn't allowed to sit there...or at any of the empty tables to again, just have a drink and wait out the kitchen...she rolls her eyes again and tells me no. Who just says no? I get gaming on a normal night but to accommodate the overflow wouldn't you bypass that rule? I never yelp. I'm in the service industry, yelping is for idiots with to much time on their hands generally I feel like. But wow! I have never ever encountered someone so nasty while dining out.

The specials are good when you can catch them. Normally during football season the half off appetizers are good other than that I'd pass on them all.  The definite go to at this establishment for me is the Philly Steak Fries a half order is more than enough to feed a person.

I heard a few people mention this place a while ago and I just happen to see it on Groupon and decided to give it a shot since I live in the neighborhood. You walk in and seat yourself so don't except someone to seat you. This restaurant is open 24 hours which is cool. It's a dark bar but nice. My server was prompt and friendly. I ordered the petite filet and it came with a side salad which was good and cheap even without a Groupon! Only $21 full price. This is not an echo & Rig steak but on point with pricing. They have half off steak on Sundays as well. I'd come back to try other things on the menu for sure. Cool local spot.,fxrQSMhHlBv6eJVRdchG9Q,2,2,4,NDcFQVshkXb5wh8VqdKxAw
5103855,2017-03-20,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"If I could give zero stars I would. I have never been so blatantly lied to before. I understand that on sundays it's a half price steak special and it's a great deal, but when you order a steak and it's completely over cooked it's not out of line to ask for a new one whether you're paying $32 or $16. I ordered a New York steak medium and my girlfriend ordered a filet medium. Her steak came out perfectly pink throughout, mine was grey all the way through. So I told the waitress I ordered it medium and she said ""well I see a little bit of pink so it is medium"". Then the manager came over and said ""you ordered a medium and this is how we do mediums here, and it's 45 min out for a steak"". We told him my girlfriend ordered it cooked the same way and there's a night and day difference between the two, to which he had nothing to say. 
I understand that when it's busy it's inconvenient to cook a new steak, but to lie to my face is very disrespectful. Which I'm sure he realized he knew he was doing when my girlfriend showed him her steak. 
The inconsistency in the kitchen and the disrespectful service from the manager is not worth the savings. Spend the extra money on a restaurant that actually knows how to cook a steak.",rxc3KMX54D8LvvHnr56noA,8,0,1,NE7i8LhvmztHMF0WL0oi7A

Ordered a HUGE burger and a Philly cheesesteak.  Guys, when 2 sandwiches cost $27, I'd expect a really good sandwich.  Burger was big but tasteless, and a Philly cheesesteak has onions, peppers, cheese, and sometimes mushrooms, not a few burned onions and a styrofoam container of runny Velveeta!  Especially for $15!  It's a sandwich of last nights leftovers for goodness sake!
Barmaids were fabulous, bubbly and sweet.
Look, you are not a destination and your prices are WAY high for the quality you are serving.  No one is coming back unless the food is good.  So far, you're 1 for 2 on that score...

I personally love the atmosphere of the place and find it to be a great all around place to go for lunch,dinner or just having drinks at the bar or hangin on the patio.. All the girls that work there are awesome and do their jobs well.. They got a lot of heat for it being all girls that work there but whatever, they make it work well.. Now for the food.. The menu recently changed and i haven't had everything on it yet but what i have had i have enjoyed, the real hallmark of the place is their staeks and on Sunday they have them half price, which is well worth every penny u pay.. The salads are good and i enjoy the caesar there quite often with chicken or without and i have yet to be dissapointed.. On Tuesdays they have huge burgers for half price that come with fries and it is a huge meal and they are very good..!!  The happy hour is better than it used to be and all in all the place is a fun bar/restaraunt with really good food and a great vibe with good people hangin around.. The gambling is good and i see people winning all the time, so do yourself a favor and give this place a try asap..!!!",SJVAfniHY0GXPb4GWu-Htg,0,3,5,q9tgg_MxYv7JqBBMiYbDeg

We ordered our food and it came out in the normal time frame. The burger was cooked as I had asked and was one tasty burger. The missus enjoyed her salad and even got to take some home for a snack later.

This is a place worth the drive out (if you don't live in Summerlin) or stopping by (if you do). Prices are a tick high, but not wallet busting - maybe a buck or two higher. John Cutter is on our list of places we can go to if we're on that side of the valley.

On this visit, the food was good, but the service was the worst I had in a very long time anywhere.  The server came around to take the order, and that was it.  The food runner brought out the food.  The server did not check on us to see if everything was ok, no drink refills, not even a look in our direction.  We had to ask another employee for the check.  Once she brought it, she did not come back around to pick it up.  

We did see her scurrying between her other tables, so I'm not sure it was all her fault.  That leads me to believe that either they were short staffed or there are inefficiencies in they way they handle the tables.  It is quite possible that management is at least partially to blame, but as a server, there are basics that must be done no matter what.

On the small bright side, for the 10 seconds we saw her, she did seem friendly.  

It is really a shame that something as simple as service can ruin what would have been a nice meal.  There are too many other places to go to put up with this lack of service.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,0,0,2,3GIP_a5FPrMu7SBeHAAR0Q
5752334,2018-03-27,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,Wow! What a great place!  We went there on Sunday evening to take advantage of the 1/2 price steak special and loved it. The wait staff was attentive and the food was great!  Two thumbs up!,A7TdRJOfAbQc4re07ivM9Q,0,0,5,tW-V8nKEvGB8j6nGiUeUDQ
5752766,2014-08-06,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"Two trips here in a week, and I will be back for more.  Good beer, good atmosphere, decent food, and fantastic servers make for a great time, especially when it sits across the street from my house!  

First time was with my relative, who was staying at the Red Rock but wanted to see the house so we decided to cross the street and have a couple of beers.  On a Wednesday night they were pretty busy, and despite only wanting to drink and not eat, they were more than happy to have us.  Our server, Elizabeth, was super sweet and super cute.  The beer aren't great bargains ($5/$8 for a typical 12/24oz bottles), but it does get a bit less expensive during happy hour (4-6pm).

Last night, my friends and I decided to head over for some food and drinks, and despite being full and having to find a table for 8, they were very pleasant and speedy.  We ordered a bunch of  Philly Fries and Nachos, with the former being great and the latter pretty good.  Liked the fact that the nachos had real steaks though.  I'd like to try the rest of the menu eventually.  The server (never got her name) was again very awesome, and they are the real reasons I like coming here.  Experience never goes sour when service is great!

Table-for-1 Factor:  It's a bar & grill and they have a large bar area, so I can see myself parking here alone on those nights when I need to catch a game.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,3,0,4,3Kf1hSC82b2bgG7WhQPhdA
5774206,2016-01-19,3,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"Dropped by on Sunday after the hike so I could catch the Panthers vs Seahawks game. At the time it was already 24-0 Carolina (sorry Roger) so I decided to order a Bloody Mary and bacon, eggs, toast breakfast ($8) and watch the end of the first half before heading home.

Sundays are 1/2 off on Steaks. So the Ribeye which normally goes for $35 is $17...that's a good deal. Unfortunately the special didn't apply to the steak and eggs breakfast. 

Place is a bit dark, but it is non-smoking for those that care. They have gaming at the bar. I've been here probably a dozen times over the years. They have several 4 top tables, and booths, and a few larger tables that can seat 8-10 so ok for groups. 

Breakfast was good, nothing too exciting. Only 2 strips of bacon :(   Bloody Mary was tasty and hit the spot perfectly. Service was good. It wasn't too busy which surprised me.

5778133,2015-03-11,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,I might not be the best person to rate and overall John Cutters experience as I've only been here a couple times late at night and each time I ordered the steak wrap or chicken wrap with the steak wrap being the best of the two. Packed to the gills with finely chopped well seasoned steak. Since its been a late night stop its never been crowded so service was good. I like the decor but does seem a bit cramped but this I'm sure to take advantage of a relatively small bar. I guess I need to come on in here and give it a real good test during a busier time and order up a steak and really put John's to the test. But for this review I'd give John Cutters a solid 4 stars for a good late night neighborhood stop.,m-I2uTU5Y1sQIaZ5l8yytQ,1,0,4,2cy0J4NMQVneOVZ3dfkMng

But over the course of our last 5 tries s the food has been horrible. Multiple items returned on multiple trips by multiple people in the group. I mean one night a burger was sent back 3 times from one person. The cooks CAN NOT cook meat. I have yet to receive a properly cooked steak. Medium arrives with no pink. Medium rare arrives rare. I give up. Last night was the end we all agreed cutters is off the routine. 3 of 5 of us are all in the restaurant business and all are pretty accustomed to mistakes. But this is just ridiculous. We can only imagine the food being wasted in this kitchen as we know we are not the only ones sending food back. On several occasions we have seen quiet a few orders headed back.
I'm giving them 2 stars because there servers. Mary, heather, and Taylor. Are great girls with great personalities. But the rest is in need of serious repairs.

5821433,2016-03-15,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"I came here specifically for the $6 burger on Tuesdays. It was a random last-minute visit, and, I'd say that you are getting your bang for the buck because the burger is enormous. So enormous, that you can finish about half of it and be stuffed. I personally wasn't too fond of the burger at all even though it was a good price. 

However, I have been thinking about their Philly cheesesteak fries, and had cravings for it days after my visit. It was sooooooooo good. I was pleasantly surprised at the tender/juicy/fatty quality of the steak that is chopped up on top. The cheese sauce is the nacho cheese type that's melted (which I normally can't stand), but it worked well with this dish, and I really thought it was legit. Unfortunately, that was regular price. I'd for sure come back for those fries though.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,4,2,3,wJmmUNPsreXlg5RuvKZ3GQ

5850648,2015-02-05,0,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"My wife and I went to John Cutter in Summerlin last night as we had a Groupon to use. We'd been there before so we knew what to expect. Except this time they had a singer playing guitar just inside the front door. We hadn't seen that before. In truth this place is too small to have live music. Even if we enjoyed the musician, which we didn't, it would have been too loud to allow reasonable dinner conversation. Given the total lack of attention and applause , it didn't seem like the other patrons appreciated the entertainment either.
The sandwiches we ordered were good and the service was surprisingly good as well which had not been our experience in past visits. Normally you have to set a trap or throw a net to get the waitress's attention to refill an ice tea but last night service was better. You still had to ask for a refill but it actually came quickly after asking.
Given average food, fair service and the new loud live entertainment, we won't be back until outdoor patio dining is appropriate, if then.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,1,2,CNwQ7jWgRSQ98OcjTsrOnA

5866386,2012-05-05,1,H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,"Friday night hike in Vegas heat and it is suggested that we take refreshments at John Cutter, the nearest bar to Red Rock Canyon. I've driven by many times but never been tempted to go in, probably because of the location in a sleepy shopping area anchored by Albertsons.

It's quite cool inside, high tables , lots of tvs and nice moody lighting. I'm fascinated by the staff, I have a vision of an interview process that involves the following conversation:
Q "" Will you wear this very tiny tank top?"" 
A "" it looks very small......but ok""
  ""you're hired""

Yes, it's Hooters in the 'burbs'. A bad thing? Depends.

Anyway, pots of beers and wines, the food , especially the burgers are huge, Michelle Obama would be seriously p&$/:ed. I took a chicken flatbread thing with some feta cheese and tomatoes and it was pretty good. One of the group took some Pot Stickers that looked a little too deeply fried for my liking but she was happy. Other guys took monster burgers and were satisfied.

I don't know what I think......it was ok but we are lucky to live in Vegas with so many choices and a Yelp app, I will try it again.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,0,1,3,srEcJNQnYybHUosfC3yJnw

The loyalty club includes gaming promos and a birthday freebie, so count me in! After the bartender signed me up, she told me $10 play would be available right away after earning 20 points. They have a sign above the bar to join their text club, and I did, getting an offer for $20 match play. I was informed that offer was the same as the $10 for earning 20 points. She told me she would put $10 on my card for next time. I shall return! It would be nice to get both offers cause it's confusing as to if they are one and the same offer..........?????

It's a small place with one big room for dining and gaming/drinking etc. at the bar. Must be nonsmoking, I believe. Outside seating is also available. The menu has many different apps, meals, etc. to choose from and they have a Sunday steak special for 50% off steaks.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,4,2,3,4HF8R2n7HQO8py3FXz0yjw

is cramped, you will always get bumped into by one of their obnoxious ""regulars"". The waitresses will never get your order right unless you just order fries, and even then she will get you the wrong kind of beer. The waitress is more concerned about getting you out of there than trying to up sell on dessert or another round of drinks. Don't bother bringing ANY kind of coupons or gift certificates, the staff will argue with you about accepting them (don't bother telling me that I didn't read the conditions on the coupons, I did read and totally understood that you cannot use coupons during happy hour, we ordered food AFTER happy hour and our coupons were still not accepted). And lastly, I want to add that I worked in a couple local bar/restaurants and currently work as a waitress in a major strip casino, so I am very forgiving with any wait staff that I come across, and already have the mentality that ""the customer is always wrong"", but the staff is horrible and rude.
