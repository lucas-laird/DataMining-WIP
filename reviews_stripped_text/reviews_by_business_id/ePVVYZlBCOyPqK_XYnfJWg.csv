After getting my drink my food was ready didn't feel the buzzer. She took my food put it in the bag shoved it into my hand. Not one time I walked out your restaurant without seeing my food on the plate. If employees have attitude they don't need to work speaking and treating customers that way. and the other employees talking about a African young lady who can back for a churro. They whole crew need a class talking about customers and treating them disrespectful the way your cashier Beatrice did. I ask for her name and cooperate number she laugh. I'm guess she miss treat customers that way and know managers speaks to her about her attitude. I hope action is taking begin treat the way I was are I shall take further actions. What upset me the most she laugh as if nothing will happen to her I'm waste my time send this complaint.",tqKcZQcPFOxdRHy19agRVQ,0,0,3,EJc0lIipwIEDkFkf1bkAQw
1382115,2017-01-13,0,ePVVYZlBCOyPqK_XYnfJWg,OH My so tried giving them a 2nd chance called in a catering order just now with Ariana ordering 60 dinners  and 27 salads I asked her for 1 wing lovers and she says she can't because I was ordering all white meat. So I tell her to mix them dark and light to get 1 wing lovers for the President of the company she still says no. My order would have been more then 400 dollars plus and your telling me you can't make it happen. They should be closed or restaffed they're not interested in making money. WORST El POLLO LOCO EVER. And I've ordered from lots doing catering never had this issue,6EnKTzlensu4lUcijj1rxg,1,0,1,XSKH8G_884nyG8Gs7W2QMQ

Four stars because the lady at front, I asked if I can have a flour tortilla for my taco platter instead of their corn tortilla they usually put and she's like ""it's too big"" says by the kitchen guy, and I'm like how are they too big lol it's not a burrito. But anyway dining area was clean and nice and everything else",V76GC2AkfZCdSMs3pWMOZQ,0,0,4,c_HCqCQrse8603gIfisO5Q

After I pulled off I realized they didn't get my order correct & I had to turn around just to have them fix it & she asks me if I had the receipt. I tell her she didn't give me one & she decided to tell me that she did... When I CLEARLY did not have a receipt in my car & I was literally just in the drive thru... I've worked in the food business before & that's definitely not how you treat customers or talk to them. Right or wrong, you don't argue with the customer.",DK5yIShTedpS7IKr2i3_Tg,0,0,3,yWJQJLV7cYqGh-S0dFpB3g
2086323,2017-12-18,0,ePVVYZlBCOyPqK_XYnfJWg,Almost all pollo loco in Vegas that I've been to have been disappointed but this one has been the far most ordered tacos al carbon came home and tortillas were not even heated/cooked at all they broke into pieces from folding them they didn't even bother heating them up the whole point of ordering out is to not have to come home and still have to reheat/cook the damn food,CZeL9raU71ipE-ikVG3PmA,0,0,1,qAY7H79QpVDJ6NnF-taXXQ
2968882,2018-02-09,0,ePVVYZlBCOyPqK_XYnfJWg,"We decided in work to get a drive thru lunch from El Pollo Loco in this location and it's very disappointing because the staff who prepared our orders doesn't pay attention to our orders, what we paid is not what we got, it's incomplete  and my coworker needs to drive back to get the missing order. The guacamole is not  a guacamole and has a jello like or a greenish abut  we guess. 
Just a note before you leave this place check your orders and  for us, we won't go back to this place . Not worth spending a dollar",-8poh5BcPBUi1PxhyTz0oQ,1,0,1,WYe8kLs1wS8HYGHs2R5pew

4371064,2016-03-30,0,ePVVYZlBCOyPqK_XYnfJWg,Good but some issues but long waits caused by bad parking structure caused me to be late from lunch. Salads always have the center of the head for some reason. Always have to throw lettuce away. If I see another brown avocado I may stop coming,SkUjCvDBA2VNnJWj8DNcdg,0,0,3,Tr1JtgpUmZpQaMh2evymZg

5192142,2017-02-21,0,ePVVYZlBCOyPqK_XYnfJWg,This place consistently gives you sub par food compared to other locations.  I have to travel out of the way to go to El Pollo Loco even though this is the closest location. I gave them multiple chances but the last time they gave me all burnt chicken. No more chances. I'm done.,JUZlOjAtfTK4cIy-dVScVA,0,0,1,bEQqv1-Z05dg1Z3EucKuRw
