11464,2009-03-11,2,W0oH-WXVdQj98XJ9Obn82Q,"My expectations for Fridays are pretty low because it's a chain restaurant.  I don't go in expecting to have the best meal of my life.  I mainly go in expecting to not get food poisoning.  And, in reality, I guess that my expectations were met.

I do, however, expect to have at least semi-decent service.  I'm not saying that you have to take my order immediately after I close my menu; however, I don't think it's an unreasonable expectation to want my Waiter to take my order during my first half hour in a restaurant.  This is especially true when it's in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and the restaurant is hardly at its busiest. 

In addition to expecting my order to arrive on time, it would also be nice if the Waiter didn't practically throw my plate of food at me.  Maybe I expect too much?  Or maybe I was just bitter because I left all my money in a slot machine outside the door?",SuDwtD21LL8tHYu1jmJ1Rw,3,2,1,ODdIGLC-WO56F3kBs8x14w

I didn't care at that point - if you've ever had the Brownie Obsession, you know it's worth the cavity.

Eggs were not scrambled properly. More correctly they were stir fried. Sausages were alright. Bacon was ok too (can't really go too wrong with bacon right?)

The French toast were nothing to wow about. What bugged us most was that our food was served to us at ""room temperature"". Which i felt was a failure on their part since a at minimum you'd expect a restaurant to at least serve hot food.

After our meal was served they seated two girls with a young child behind us, this child was crying to the point he was choking, gurgling and gagging and we lost our appetite.  I asked they please move them since we were in the middle of dinner, nothing was said or done. Another person in my party asked and again nothing was done. I asked for the check and placed it on their table since they ruined our dinner, the ""mother"" finally took the alcoholic beverage out of her mouth and flung the folder at me and started yelling at me. The man at the table behind her then piped up with we looked like we could skip a few meals (pretty ignorant and none of your business to begin with so keep your opinions to yourself)  and the manager asked us to pay the bill and leave!!  We were not happy that we should pay for food we could not eat and to our surprise there were 5 security guards waiting for us.  WOW, really  you let other people in the dining room throw things at us, insult us and ask us to leave. I will never go here again after being treated like this. Security asked which one of us took off our belt and threatened the other table, REALLY and who made up that story, the manager no doubt. We let security know what happened and of course the cameras back up our account that there were no threats made and they were very understanding.  I have complained to the corporate office and I can only hope the other couple dining at the next table who said they were glad we said something because they were about to will speak up as well.

We had just come from the Billboard Awards and we were STARVING. Took a cab over to the Gold Coast and was promptly seated and scarfed the best wings ever! 

No, we weren't drunk. Yes, the cab driver was confused that he was taking us to Friday's for wings instead of Buffalo Wild Wings, but the taste buds want what they want. 

Our server, I hate that his name slips me, was great. He was friendly, funny and helpful. The hostess was so nice and pleasant. Her smile was so warm and inviting. Seriously, either all the stars aligned in the universe that night, or this is easily the best Fridays in the country. Well, at the very least, it's the best Fridays to go to on a Sunday night after hours of waiting and your stomach hurting from laughing at Miguel almost take a few heads off during a failed attempt at stage diving/stage hopping.

However, if you're a sports fan and looking to get away from the craziness and crowds usually found at the strip casino sports books, then this is the place for you. Tucked away in the Gold Coast Casino, TGIFridays provides the perfect sports get away for intense sports fans. My buddies and I came into town for the NCAA tournament and couldn't come close to finding a seat at any of the strip casinos. As a result, we made our way down to Gold Coast's TGIFridays and were able to get four spots right away at the bar. The place has a ton of TVs and cheap big beers. During Happy Hour times (3-7PM) there are goods deals on food and drinks, as well. Since then I've gone back a handful of times to watch games and each time I've been able to get an easy seat and my game on any TV I wanted. The sports book is also right next door if you need to make a quick bet and the gold coast is usually pretty empty so there are no long lines to wait in.

916074,2012-10-02,0,W0oH-WXVdQj98XJ9Obn82Q,"While on a job out in Las Vegas, I ate a couple of times at this TGI Fridays which was in the hotel/casino. I had tried going to vegetarian places around town, but they were either out of business or I couldnt find them among the numerous strip malls ands vast signage that makes up this town.

Fortunately TGI Fridays has a veggie burger that they actually make themselves instead of heating up a frozen store bought garden burger like most mega chains. It is made from black beans, spices, and some other goodies, and will more than likely fall apart while you are trying to eat it, so I suggest having a napkin, fork and knife on stand-bye. 

Since I was in town on my own, and everyone I knew was busy, I decided to take it up to my room. They allow you to purchase beers and take the bottles up with you, which is pretty cool because I didnt feel like hanging out at the bar by myself while I had a beer or two.

Overall I am glad that they are there, but I really wish places would have more selection than one item for vegetarians. Salads dont count, everyone expects vegetarians to eat a salad.",ba-c7ttJeYB7hsIzxzpELg,1,1,3,Yb1qYlXTHiFfgFEUbpwIwA

I rarely leave half my food on the plate even when I am not famished but I just couldn't bring myself to knaw on another bite. The picture in the menu showed two juicy chicken breast filets smothered in garlic and sauce resting on sautéed peppers and melted cheese nestled next to plump shrimp with seasonings and a side of creamy mashed potatoes. What I got was two flat white oblong discs with no seasoning, dry shrimp and two lumps of mashed potatoes that looked like they were right out of an ice cream scoop. Did I mention that there was no sizzle? Nothing, the plate was warm but just enough to keep the cheese from congealing.  The sautéed peppers were ok but the cheese was barely melted and you could plainly see it was a square of processed orange cheese product, not even shredded.

Service is super slow for no apparent reason and the already bad food tends to come out cold. I visited this establishment on two different occasions and ended up with the same disappointing experience. The first time was with some friends who were on a 1-hour dinner break from their WSOP tournament. We notified the server we were on a time crunch and specifically ordered items that we were told would be prepared quickly. Was it quick? No. One of the dishes even came out cold, either from being undercooked or was sitting out for who knows how long while our server was doing who knows what.

The second time I stopped in for a late night meal and again, service was slow when there was almost nobody dining there. My boyfriend and I decided to share the chicken & beef fajitas, which took forever to come out and ended up being cold. The sides (guacamole, salsa, etc) were never served to us nor did we have any utensils. When the server finally came around to our table, the BF was fed up, so he sent it back and asked for a new dish to be made, complete with all the sides and utensils ready. Our server complied, apologized profusely, took the plate back, and eventually brought out a new piping hot sizzling dish. We cautiously picked at our meal, unsure of what may have been in it since you never know what happens behind the kitchen when you send food back -_- But it seemed safe enough so we finished our meal and then asked for the bill. To our surprise, we were charged twice for the fajitas despite our waiter having said before, and I quote, 'that cold dish should've never been brought out for you guys'. After bringing it up to him, he claimed to simply have forgotten to change it. Regardless if it was intentional or not, service here sucks and I'd only come back out of desperation for the spinach & artichoke dip appetizer, which is the only tasty thing I've had here.",G40odYEY9J4iWOZvfRT_xA,2,0,1,98wSKCeUaN6tt3KO8S85Hg

1572952,2010-02-09,0,W0oH-WXVdQj98XJ9Obn82Q,"This is a difficult review to write because I happen to like TGI Friday's. My husband and I started going about once a week when we lived in CA; the food and service was consistently great. However, since moving to Vegas, we have struggled to find a location that makes us happy. The location on Sahara has terrible service, in the Aliante the service is slow even when the restaurant is empty, and at Sam's Town the food was not good. So, we have taken to visiting the location at Gold Coast.

So, here is the review for the TGI Fridays at the Gold Coast.  The food is inconsistent. As a general rule, the items that I order are fine but my husband always orders the macaroni & cheese and it never seems to be the same. Sometimes there is not enough cheese or the chicken has too much fat on it or the breading is burned. Honestly, how hard can it be to bake mac & cheese?

The service is generally horrible. We often visit at odd hours of the day when very few patrons are there and we still cannot get good service. Some of the problems have included the order being wrong, not refilling drinks, and a lack of personality. I rarely fail to tip - even for bad service - but I have started doing this since moving to Vegas simply because of the terrible customer service. 

In addition, on this particular visit, the cashier/hostess was so unprofessional it was just annoying. As she was correcting my check - since the waiter had overcharged me - she was chatting with a waitress, answering the phone, and muttering to herself (loudly). It was amazing.

So, I have a dilemma. The food is fine - better than some, worse than others - but I have their rewards card so I am always receiving coupons. Do I continue to eat there when the service annoys me so just to save money or do I throw in the towel and try to find another restaurant where my husband can eat mac & cheese? I think I just need to keep exploring my Vegas options. It is just that I am tired of paying for bad service and mediocre food. Hmmm.",wt6CYydQUWRR4UQfzdcnuQ,0,0,2,oJvCMJN9ml711Yp5-CajYQ

The burger came out with cheese, so we sent it back. My sandwich came in two halves, one half of the bread was burnt, and the other half had a SLIVER of chicken on it.

I didn't complain about the underwhelming cut of chicken. But then I bit into it and nearly broke a tooth. It was hard as a rock, and beyond overcooked.

Then I sent it back.

A year or two ago they opened a TGI Friday's and I really fell in love with the restaurant.  The food reminds me much of Chili's as their menu is mostly American.  The grilled chicken tacos were tasty and accompanied with pinto beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  

However, on my most recent trip, I wasn't terribly hungry, so I only ordered a small appetizer.  I decided to go with their pot stickers as my friend ordered a large steak, lobster tail, and mashed potatoes.   The waiter was a little rude (or concerned?) when I asked for a Long Island with no sweet and sour.  He kept trying to dissuade me of such a strong drink, but he eventually caved in and brought me my drink.

The food came and my friends entree looked amazing.  The steak looked juicy, tender, and delicious.  He gave me a bite and the steak was amazingly tender and full of flavor with their Jack Daniel's steak sauce.  As for my appetizer, the pot stickers came on a rectangular dish and were nicely presented.  The appetizer included about six or seven pot stickers, which were nicely fried and full of vegetables.  The pot stickers were piping hot, crunchy and tasty.

2267330,2012-10-17,0,W0oH-WXVdQj98XJ9Obn82Q,"This place can be summarized in 4 words:

Great Service, HORRIBLE food.

First off, service: The staff was great and helpful! We were seated, and got our drinks quick. During the entire course of the meal, we were checked upon and had our waters refilled. No complaints about the staff, keep up the good work!

Now, the food:  I went during happy hour, so most appetizers were all $6... My party ordered 4 appetizers and 1 dessert. First off, the Tuscan Spinach Dip: There was spinach, artichoke, cheese, tomatoes, and chips... There was nothing too special about this dish. The taste was just mediocre and bland. I think we were only able to finish half of the dip and chip... Loaded potato skins: about half of the potato skins had a good amount of cheese and bacon, the other half, only one or two pieces of bacon were to be found. In the sour cream and green onion dip, let's just say I could count how many pieces of green onions in that dip with the amount of fingers on one hand. Then we had the jack daniels chicken strips: The strips were small and overcooked, and it just didn't taste right. On the contrary, the dipping sauce was excellent. Finally, we had the Sirloin hibachi skewers. The beef was overcooked, but the sauce and pita bread combo was excellent. We ended up finishing this dish first since it was the best of all the appetizers.  For dessert we had a slice of red velvet cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The color of the red velvet cake indicated that the cake has been sitting there for hours, if not days. It was a dull red, and the taste matched the color. The vanilla ice cream looked 'smooth' and had chunks of ice in it, which was a clear indication of it being completely melted, and refrozen.

I don't think I'll ever be back at this place again. Yes, the wait staff was kind and courteous, but that is not enough to keep me going back to a place with horrible tasting food.",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,1,0,2,Pei2qssN8UTm_ccO6SUpjw

What you order may not be what you get. As an example, I ordered a Cesar Salad and it was served with wilted lettuce, some balsamic/oil dressing, no croutons, no parmesan cheese. I asked if this was the Cesar Salad and they said it was ""their version"" of the salad. 

My goodness, don't advertise something then change it up and call it ""your version"". Are they going to serve a sandwich, call it a hamburger, then call it ""there version"" when you question them about it? 

The food was under cooked, and somewhat cold. I asked if we could just cancel the order, but they said they couldn't and we should have ordered something ""better"" or ""read the menu"". I was upset, but instead of making a scene, I just left.

TGI Fridays it RIGHT next to the elevator that goes up to the rooms so it's really convenient (that's part of why they got two stars instead of one). I ordered the salmon and my b/f ordered the steak and shrimp off of the featured Jack Daniels menu. Here is a quick run through on what was unsatisfactory about the meal itself:
1.) steak was dry and chewy
2.) shrimp were much smaller serving than represented in menu picture
3.) baked potato didn't come w usual toppings, i.e. NO BUTTER
4.) salmon was tough on the bottom side/ overcooked and dry
5.) veggies that came w salmon were soggy and overcooked
My boyfriend was pretty annoyed by the steak being so disappointing, and we weren't expecting much this being a corporate food chain and all. We don't usually go to these places anymore for this very reason. 
So, bottom line is this. If your feeling lazy and are ok with food being ""passable"" then this is the place for you! But you've been warned.

Okay so it wasn't like I planned to go to this TGI Friday's.  We actually went to Gold Coast to enjoy some frugal eats (Steak and Eggs @ the cafe).  It shows how long its been since I've ventured the Gold Coast.  That cafe is long gone and has been replaced by an all too familiar chain.  

Pros:
  Open Late
  Happy hour until 4 am... SCORE !
  Friendly staff (especially the bartender...we sat at the bar)
  You can still enjoy steak and eggs!

Cons:
  You must sit at the bar for the happy hour.  (this is not really a con for me, but it could be for others so i figured I'd mention it).
  Irish Car Bombs are nearly $9.00 a pop!  
  Steak and Eggs for $2.99?  Dream on... more like $13.99!  Funk that!

Verdict:
  Overall, I'd recommend this place.  You really can't go wrong with TGIFridays.  They have a good happy hour (though the old happy hour at TGIFridays was way more bomb!) with cheap drinks and appetizers for $6.
The only thing that could really mess this up is bad service.  I didn't get any of that here.  The bartender actually comped my friend's appetizer since it was his birthday.  That's pretty awesome if you ask me!  That definitely beats having a group of servers gathering to sing you an unsynchronized version of the happy birthday song.  I'd give this location a 5 stars if they offered a steak and egg special for $2.99.  Aside from that though, I'm a fan.  Late night (or early morning..whichever) eats for cheap while intoxicated... I'm easy to please.  If you are anything like me, you won't be disappointed.

Tips:
  Stay away from the drinks not on the happy hour, they'll cost your more than your wings.

  Speaking of wings, try the traditional Jack Daniels BBQ wings.  YUM!

  Sit at the  bar and avoid the line if any.  Plus you get happy hour prices!

  Stay away from their Port Sausage.. doesn't taste good at all.  If you want some Port Sausage, go to a local island joint =)",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,2,4,6uilcreqKAVg07_szyabZw
2873112,2018-03-24,2,W0oH-WXVdQj98XJ9Obn82Q,"Let's s be real, we all know what we are getting ourselves into when going to a TGI Friday's. It's either to get a little toasty or to experience their ridiculous appetizer menu. If you are coming here for a fancy dinner or to celebrate a birthday (other than your 21st), you are in the wrong place.  

The reason for the 4 stars, is simply about the experience my wife and I have had on every occasion that we've been to this Friday's. 

-is the service 100%? No! 

-will you ever see Elvis stop by? (Probably, it's Vegas) 

-will they ever become a Michelin Star rated restaurant? Not in a million years!

-do my wife and I have a grand time every visit and leave TGI with a huge smile and a little more buzzed than when we walked in? Absolutely! And that's the point. 

You see TGI Friday's is meant to be a fun atmosphere restaurant where you can grab a drink and food with friends and have a good time. 

This TGI Friday's has been the place where our trip begins and where we get our Vegas trip started off right. 
It's a place where you can get affordable drinks, delicious appetizers and it's open 24 hours. 

It's conveniently located inside the Gold Coast Casino where gambling is extremely affordable and where your money will go a long way compared to those big time casinos on the strip.

I'm not sure if it was good timing or what because the one at the Orleans almost always has a wait.

Our server was friendly and quick. We received waters right away and pondered the menu. We settled on shrimp cocktail and nachos. After finishing we were still hungry so we got the BBQ chicken flat bread.

The cocktail was served with lemon and lime. I haven't had shrimp cocktail since I was a child and it was so good I'll def order it more.

The nachos were good. The white sauce on it was yummy, wish it had more. Had a good amount of chicken.

To a dirty table with food crumbs and debris.So when the waitress arrived it was pretty apparent that I annoyed her when I asked for it to be re-cleaned after the ""wait help"" or someone attempted to wipe it down - wipes the table then seat then table then other seat. Now WHY would anyone wipe a chair - seat then wipe the table you eat off of ?
She had to redo it and didn't seem to appreciate that extra work.
So we order a couple of things while we waited for the rest of our party. To my surprise when I ordered the VERY small BUCKET of bones AND wings -- I was corrected by our waitress that NO I DID NOT order the wings. I ONLY ordered the bucket with the ribs/wings. Well - with FOUR people there is NO way you can feed them with such a small portion of food with their serving size of the bucket of bones (more like soup bowl).
Then we are contemplating whether we would order dessert or not -- to our surprise this too was an irritant to our server Kirsten.
So we decided not to and just pay our bill. Well damn if i had a comp to ruin her day even more ?!? Excuse me for being a frequent club member at the Gold Coast.

Or was it because we were Asian and she wanted to serve anyone else but us ?!?

Kinda of felt that way if you ask me --
Check your video Ms manager of TGIF.

When she was done chatting she walked away down the long right side of the bar, never even came over to me. 3 gentlemen sat down at the long left side, she walked right up to them all smiles and started helping them. I sat there and stared at her, we can all feel when we're being stared at and we look. Nope not her. Finally another bartender who was going into a cooler looked at me, smiled and asked if I was being helped. Thank you Ashley!!!!! The whole time I was standing there, Shelby never once made eye contact or anything. There were a couple male bartenders who came in after I'd gotten help, they even made the polite eye contact and smiled in acknowledgement of my presence. After I got my item I asked Ashley for the other tenders name and told her what happened.

We sent the potato skins back. They were mushy. No green onions. Just a fried piece of potato with cheese and bacon. Absolutely nothing to make them stand out or even compete with the most basic of potato skins. And they claim they invented these? 

You can tell that nothing is fresh. The ranch is bland. Everything tasted manufactured. 

Not once was my dad ever offered another beverage. And it was a Mai tai. That's such an easy way to get a bill up higher and no one even thought to ask. 

The hostess? Non existent. And when she did make her round to us, there was zero personality or positivity. 

We ordered a couple burgers...fresh baked buns? Maybe one of them because the bun was actually brown in color. The other, was white. 

To top it all off, right as I was about to rate this place 2 stars, the random bad attitude hostess comes to the table and auctions off a ribeye steak.

A couple of years ago, the service was not that good and I stayed away for a while. But, over the last few visits, I have come back to test the waters and it seems to have improved. I think the underlying problem is an inability to have enough people working at this location. I can't imagine the logistics behind running a chain restaurant in a Vegas hotel, but there never seems to be enough people working here at one time. We have gone in for a drink and a snack when there weren't many people in the place, and then crowds of people from the hotel would come in and the staff had a hard time keeping up. 

We had great bartenders this last time and the food we had was pretty good. They pour a good drink here (not a shock for a bar in Vegas), and we were pretty happy with the food. Like I said, I think more wait staff is the key.

When you're paying $25 for each steak meal, you expect it to come the way you ordered it. Instead of cooking the steaks from scratch, they were just sauced and reheated. The sides and dessert were good, but our server forgot our drinks to go with our meal. The place was also pretty dirty. The bus person left water on the table while wiping it, so it was messy.

It looked like there was quite a shortage of staff and our waiter was literally zooming around the restaurant like a ninja, much so that he ended up giving me a glass of ice cold water instead of hot water like I asked. To his dismay, he came over about 10 minutes after he handed the drinks and apologized sincerely for the little mistake, thanked us for our patience and reasoned that it was such a busy day which I totally understood. In fact, I really appreciated the gesture. 

As for the food itself, I'd say average. The burger patties were juicy although the dinner roll bread made it feel more like a sandwich than a burger. The pickles were fashionably placed above of the bread, topped with a cherry tomato and our side order of fries were well, what can I say, some pretty neat fries.

The only problem I have is the food. The appetizers are great but the bigger meals not so much. I once had the fish and chips, and it was greasy. I just went back recently to try something new and had the Gourmet Mac n' Five Cheese. It wasn't what I expected. It was really dry and not very cheesy.

+ it has a huge bar seating area (which we find has superior service).  Jose, Jackie, and Kathy are great, but we especially love the guy called McLovin, a super outgoing and attentive, skinny, bespectacled drama-class nerd. 

+ it's open 24 hours, everyday, NOW, with a great happy hour, and great weekday special

+ and, best of all, with a Bingo receipt: get a free entree with purchase of entree and two drinks, or a free dessert with two drinks.

NO!! that is NOT a dauber in my pocket.

Why not 5 stars? The drinks are not particularly strong, so stick with beer, wine, or shots.

As for the food...
The ribs were excellent.  The lobster tail was small (and a little cold) but still great.
The breakfast skillet is good. The chicken fingers are good.
The ABC (All-American Breakfast Club) is superior.  Get it on Texas toast.
The 1/2 sandwich, (limp) fries, and 1/2 salad were fine, and a good deal.
The strawberry shortcake is kinda gross.

This location is open 24 hours and has an abundance of bar seating, as well as tables located in the bar and restaurant area. The location is pretty central to anywhere you are in the Gold Coast. Second, the food is great if your looking for your usually chain restaurant type food. The temperature is always hot, and comes out in a timely manner. 
They have a great happy hour from 4pm to 7pm and starts back up from 9pm to 6am. Happy hour consists of $6 select appetizers as well as drinks. 
The best thing I would say about this Tgifridays is the staff! The staff really makes the dining experience. Majority of the time I end up in the bar area, so the bartenders really accommodate my friends and I. A big shout out to the staff that make this place run at the craziest of hours. Amber, Jose, Sabrina, Tracy, Selena, and Brandon are great people that always have a smile on their face, even at the most hectic of times.
I would give this location nothing less than 5 stars. Being local and living in Vegas, I have had terrible service at restaurants located on the strip.

We were greeted promptly and drink order fulfilled. TV's had basketball on and no seat at the table was in bad viewing area. Food order placed with specific details that seemed to be pretty easy. No cheese on a burger and different bun....seems easy enough we thought...food is delivered with cheese and wrong bun. We notify the server, he says he will take it back. After 12 mins go by and everyone is done eating we inquire about the entree whereabouts....server says ""it's real busy back in the kitchen""...Sad to hear that... After another 3 minutes go by the burger comes out...wrong bun but at least no cheese. At this point we just wanted to get and go. I could see from this point that the service would go downhill from here. Our ticket arrived I picked up the entire bill and left gratuity. In future when we visit we will look elsewhere as we have many choices in the area.

It was also in bottles so I dk if that made a difference, but we didn't ask for that and I think it was very grimey for her to not have told us that we were paying for each one and to have not brought the soft drink in a cup like she did mine. Terrible. Then when she did bring our food (I ordered the $14 jack daniels platter) she just left it on the table and didn't ask if we needed anything until we were almost half finished with our meals. My bf couldn't eat his wings cause she didn't bring enough bleu cheese and mine was terrible cause all of the yummy dipping sauces for my huge platter were left off the plate.

There were only five other customers at the time and me and my friends (We're young adults) went here to eat instead of lucky penny over at Palms I insisted that we went to Lucky Penny instead of here but ya know they're dumb kids who only believe in what they already tried in... (I mean I even offered to pay too) But they still refused, again dumb kids. (Why would they refuse to a free meal?)

Again I didn't want to eat here but my two friends said they preferred to go here instead of Lucky penny. Oh and boy did they regret not listening to my advice.

So, we were seated immediately which was good and we ordered immediately because we're starving teenagers.

The server came back and apologized to us telling us that we had to wait 10 minutes because the was some technicalities in the kitchen.

At this time a mother and her child arrived and was seated across from us.

She ordered chicken with fries (I don't remember the actual name so i'm going with chicken with fries because it was basically that)

My friend also ordered the same thing but yet somehow she got her order instead of us?????

WHAT???? I DON'T UNDeRSTAND? ARE WE NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE WE'RE CHILDREN?

So we didn't act up or anything we're good kids... So we left after the server said that we had to wait another 10 minutes for our order.

In the end we had to walk another quarter mile back to Palms to go to Lucky Penny and in the end I treated them because i'm a nice guy.

But one of my friends didn't even say thank you to me so... yeah that was a big no no and now in my mind she is a giant doo doo and i'm dropping her butt",vCGiy3kIvgO3T6Q8FfLtVw,0,0,1,4EDhBrg36JnhptY65LHIQA

We came here to celebrate and get the night started. But last night, we were not so happy about the food and drinks and ended up paying for a free birthday dessert.

You see the picture!? Looks good right? Not!
The fries were super salty and stale.
My burger was dry and burnt on one side. 
I asked for medium well, they cooked it extra charred! Ha!
I got it replaced. The second one was good.

The drinks were really watered down and to much ice..
It was a strawberry hurricane and a blue citrus something. I don't think those were the right cups for those kind of drinks.

Now it's dessert time! So we already told the waiter it's our birthday. He said we can get a free dessert. Great! We ordered one vanilla bean cheesecake. We took two bites then asked for a box to take it to go.

We got our check and I was charged for 3 burgers, 2 drinks, and dessert. Now hold on wait a minute! It was 2 burgers and the waiter said we can have a free dessert. When I asked him again he says only the chocolate sundae was free. Wtf! But you said.. you know what nevermind! He didn't even bother to fix it. There goes his tips! $12 tip went down to $1.
