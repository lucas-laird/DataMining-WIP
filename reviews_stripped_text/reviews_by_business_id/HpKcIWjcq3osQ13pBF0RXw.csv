The prices were higher than even the expected high prices of an airport so when our party of five ( all in thr bar industry ourselves) had been ignored long enough we walked to he sub shop brought our drinks and sandwiches back to the bar and sat down and ate them. No one even noticed or cared -they were not even half full and certainly not in the weeds so we should not have gone unnoticed. Bottom line. Can't comment on the food cause we couldn't even order.

I didn't want to be here any longer but figured that we could ""turn his frown upside-down"" somehow. Nope, wrong! We ordered out beers, they only had 4 to choose from. Ugh. We decided to close out even though we had an hour to kill. But we no longer wanted to be in his presence. He continued to saunter around in his Depressing mood. For my Shocktop Belgian Wheat, guess what the price was? $10.17. Lol. A few chairs down from me, a man received his bill. To his dismay it came to $125.23. He got out of his chair and calmly questioned the bartender about the amount. The bartender barked, ""we'll come look at the screen yourself!"" The poor guy didnt realize that it was $10 a beer and on top of that he had ordered a sandwich, chips, and some bottled drinks for his trip. The bartender was indifferent and insensitive. So the man said, ""wow! I didn't realize it was this price! I mean, I have the money but this is highway robbery."" The bartender just scoffed. Ugh.

They did have a limited menu of food.  Another downer was that when we arrived around 7:30pm a waitress told us she was off and if we wanted anything we had to go to the bar.  Needless to say I kept seeing her pass our table for the next 45 min.  Her loss of a tip.  Oh well...  Funny how the signs say tables are for patrons only and it was so hard to get food or drinks.  I really can't complain too much though cuz they didn't kick us out and some of us had food from other places since we couldn't get them to take our order.

While in the airport, I wish not to be delayed through security, I wish for a quiet companion next to me on the flight, and sometimes I wish for a decent fast bar to have a beer while waiting.

The Fox Sports Sky Box Lounge fails on almost all counts. The bar is a fishbowl of smokers with little ventilation and poor housekeeping. The servers are less friendly than airport security on a bad day. The beer selection is domestic and boring.
