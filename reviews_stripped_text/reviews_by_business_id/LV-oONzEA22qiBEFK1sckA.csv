Although pleasant, the servers were slow, and I mean slow, not leisurely.  When our entrees came my plate was apparently delivered to the wrong table or the wrong end of the table, I don't know, but when it was placed in front of me there were 3 1/2 scallops.  You'd think if  someone ate half a scallop on a plate that you gave to the wrong person you would replace the dish. Not so. Nasty!

Some of my favorite meals have been in his restaurants and I was hopeful when we walked in. The environment is nice, the bar is beautiful and it's fun to watch the kitchen. However, the first strike was we were a couple and they put us in a booth. The table was so wide that my wife felt removed from me -- it broke the intimacy and made holding a conversation more difficult.

It took a long time for the sommelier to find our wine and their computer system and their stock were out of sync. We finally had to settle on another wine which the sommelier recommended and we were very happy with the choice.

Our first courses were disappointing. They have several dishes cooked in salt and while these were not salt dished (e.g. raw oysters), they food tasted overly salty -- to the point it was hard to enjoy the various flavors. When I finally ordered a dish that had been cooked in salt, is did not taste salty at all, which is what I had expected so I was pleased.

It's been just over a week since I ate there and the fact that I can barely remember what I ordered tells me how under-whelmed I was. I still remember meals I've had at his restaurant in SF and the Bellagio.",VYY0IJjLhwJlZtODTw8AMA,0,0,3,jyXMunN7lHODOWRJhQBHwg

This trip I was interested in the lion fish on the online American Fish menu as I've never had that. A restaurant reviewer friend suggested the fish at Le Cirque would be better so I made a reservation there but also went to American Fish. The lion fish was the best fish I had on the 7-day plunge into the best seafood in the city. The server said it tasted smoky. You mean it's smoked? I asked. No, it just tastes smoky. As in the best barbequed anything I've ever had. A dark and stormy cocktail, heavy on the ginger, was the perfect accompaniment while they played Gil Scot Heron's Living in a Bottle in the background. I would go back to Vegas just to eat that lionfish again. The monkfish at Le Cirque and it's extraordinary service would be another reason to return, but for sheer originality and getting the most out of each molecule of taste, I'd follow Van Morrison and Listen to the Lion.

After a horrible partial meal at Jaleo, we decided to walk over to the Aria and grab a few drinks. I saw that American Fish had a good happy hour from 5-7 p.m. earlier when I was checking out restaurants. Although we were too late for the happy hour, we decided to go to the lounge since they had some reasonably priced stuff and we had just dropped $100 bucks at Jaleo. 

After a bit of a trek through the Aria, we arrived at American Fish. We didn't have to wait, just went right in and sat at the bar. The atmosphere of this place is just what I like, sophisticated without being outdated and relaxing. We had an amazing bartender named Eric who explained the classic cocktail list to us. He was very friendly without being annoying. 

We decided to order 3 small plates, the fish and chips, the crab with truffle sauce and the shrimp and grits. They are priced as follows: 

1 for $8

2 for $15

3 for $22 

4 for $28

There were several other things on the menu that sounded good as well.  Although the plates were small, the food was absolutely amazing and well-priced. The fish and chips were cooked to perfection, nice and crispy not greasy and flavorful. The shrimp was juicy and delicious and the grits had a nice tangy cheesy flavor. The crab balls were coated in sesame and even though they were small, you could see all the yummy crab and the black truffle sauce was amazing.  We are excited to go back for happy hour when the small plates are $5 and try some more things. 

I also want to try a full meal because the menu looked delicious!",rONMYLVdSph8OQBb27wDKQ,2,2,5,12nMQR5vsprq33gCeBG7pw

231907,2009-12-26,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"The food was good, but not spectacular.  We had recently gone to Michael Mina's restaurant in San Francisco and thought the food and experience was much better albeit more expensive; this place surprisingly did not seem like it had Mina's signature. With our $100 dining credit from the hotel where we were staying, we decided to try this restaurant.

+ Loved that you can see the kitchen action through the floor to ceiling glass panes and you can see how they plate the food (they use All-Clad cookware)
+ Our waitress was absolutely great and friendly and she even came up to talk to us about the restaurant when we went to observe the exposed kitchen after our meal
+ Was running late for our reservation and they were very accommodating
- Fire alarm went off with a flashing strobe light and the staff was unphased... though it didn't seem like the restaurant's fault, no one said anything to us (it seemed like it was a false alarm); all I could think of was... should we be concerned and were we supposed to do something?

Dinner Notables:
+ New England Lobster Roll ($15): very tasty with lobster prepared as a seafood salad and the creamy sauce that came with it was flavorful and delicious that I wanted to keep it for dipping the bread (I'm a big fan of seafood salad in general so I'm not sure about the lobster roll Jessica A. had)
+ Malt Vinegar Fries ($9): reminded me of salt and vinegar chips... if you love them, definitely get it, but dip sparingly into the tartar sauce otherwise it will be overpowering
+ Bread: complimentary toasted ciabatta bread and mini cornbread rounds... the ciabatta bread when drizzled with rosemary olive oil was tasty that we asked for more bread
- Duet of Kurobuta Pork ($29): pork seemed like it had just crossed over to slightly dry though while part of the cubed pork was firm, one end was very tender; three piece portion was smaller than expected
o Big Eye Tuna ($38): wasn't spectacular as tuna wasn't very seasoned 
o Sorbet: trio of persimmon (Hachiya), mandarin, and blood orange sortbet served on top of two pieces of respective small fresh fruit... compared to the sorbet at gourmet restaurants and the gourmet sortbet I've made, this sorbet was unusually more creamy and more like a sherbet consistency

Our first dish came out in 20 minutes after ordering so we did not experience the extremely long wait.",_dqRcJqA2gW3R6Pf5Orexw,1,0,3,SarwCEoo-NqYjxzWo1iNig
269912,2012-05-29,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Michael Mina - as a contemporary chef has created a wonderful menu at the American Fish restaurant in the promenade level of the (new) Aria hotel/casino on the Strip. Although our food met most of our expectations, the overall experience - our server, etc. really made this a Las Vegas restaurant that could have been skipped.
The room is nicely done with a great open kitchen and step-down main dining area with a few booths along the perimeter and reasonably spaced tables. We were sat in an area  just off the host station and gazes into the sterile lobby of the ""upscale food court - far away from the nice vibe that the restaurant establishes. When we asked to be moved (to the many empty tables closer to the kitchen) our host said that this was not possible with no explanation. The evening went down-hill from there. 
The main courses were outstanding - the Blackened Cod being an amazing dish - almost worth the pricing of over $50. The Diver Scallops were among the best we had ever had. The Sommelier was the most service oriented of the team that waited on us - with great suggestions for wine pairings that were worth the steep prices.

For us, it was the indifferent service or attitude towards our evening that made this a poorly memorable evening. I had mentioned that this was a double-birthday celebration when making the reservation and nobody mentioned a thing to us when we were sat or throughout the meal. 

As a 4-Star LV restaurant, American Fish failed to deliver on this occasion to the point where I would strongly recommend one go to Michael Mina's at the Bellagio before venturing into the Aria for this restaurant.",JXATzliHAksGg2c77oaQZA,1,0,2,fdSXa3GRL3HJ916BJYPmnA

Shrimp and grits -- unbelievably flavorful shrimp, paired with perfectly cooked grits
Shabu wagyu and abalone -- a disappointment, do not order. Extremely small portions and nothing particularly impressive.
Chilled shellfish platter -- beautiful, delicious, well-portioned and fresh
Mustard Marinated Black Cod -- MUST ORDER. It is the silkiest, most flavorful fish I've ever eaten. The fish is grilled with a slightly sweet glaze. Amazing.
Horseradish Whipped Potatoes -- It is now my favorite way to eat mashed potatoes. The horseradish is a nice twist that gives boring old potatoes a zing.

515149,2013-09-01,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"This is an upscale seafood restaurant in an upscale hotel (The Aria).  It is located on the Promenade Level along with two other restaurants in a cul de sac, like a classy mini food court.  They share a comfortable waiting area.  The hotel's requisite buffet restaurant (with a long line) is located a short ways down the hall.

We had dinner here at 6:45 on an August Tuesday.  When we walked in the restaurant was about 85% full and the ambiance was noisier than I expected.  I noticed the hardwood floors throughout, wood tables (no tablecloths) and hard walls, all of which probably contributed to the noise level of the dining area.  Perhaps the designers wanted an ""energetic"" ambiance; I prefer a quieter experience when dining at an upscale restaurant.  Conversation was a bit difficult across the table with the ambient noise, but the decor was pleasant.  It got quieter when diners finished their meals and left.

The kitchen is behind a wall of glass, so you can see the chefs preparing your meal and managing the open-flame grills.  I liked this, though I didn't go up to watch them.  The servers offer you an iPad with a list of the various wines and cocktails they have; you touch a wine name or the photo of a cocktail to get more details about the wine or ingredients of the mixed drink.  

My wife and I had different fish entres; she picked a pre fixe dinner from the special Restaurant Week menu that was in effect, and I chose an equivalent from the Dinner and a Show menu (""early diner"") for those going to the Cirque du Soleil show in the hotel.  We enjoyed our dinners immensely, including the desserts, which were artistically presented.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything American Fish offers; the presentation and tastes are excellent.

I was especially impressed with the service by the wait staff.  As a former server, I noticed the little details that they did during their work routines that indicated they were well trained and conscientious about their jobs.  Big pats on the back for everyone who works in this restaurant!  They were quick, quiet, efficient, and informative.

I thought the prices were just a bit on the high side, but given the quality of the food and service, perhaps they are justified.  Overall 5 stars.

We arrived right at 5PM and got seated at a booth by the bar.  Our service (read server) was terrible.  First off they claim the happy hour menu is tapas style and by this they mean two bites of food. We ordered the oysters on the half shell (you only get two small oysters), truffled mac & cheese, and the prime rib sandwich.  Once we realized how small the portions were, we told our server that we would would be having dinner.  She recommended, yellow fin collar as an appetizer (which is not on the menu).  We figured since it was a specialty and was not on the menu it would be out of this world but it was just average.  I ordered a cowboy 18oz ribeye steak and was i disappointed.  I can make better steaks at home.  My wife had the daily shellfish cioppino.  Her face said it all after the first bite.  She gave me the look like this is it, I expected more from a Michael Mina restaurant.  We have enjoyed better cioppino at neighborhood restaurants in the suburbs of Chicago.

After spending 2.5 hours and $230 later, I came to a few realizations.  First, our bartender which was 10 feet away obstructed by tables and a bar was more attentive and had more of a conversation with us than our server.  Second, the best dish I had all night was the truffled mac & cheese.

I've always read good reviews about American Fish on the food boards, so I figured why not?  The kind of cool thing about it too is that they have a great Happy Hour and Lounge menu which fit the bill for our group.  

My one disappointment I have with this restaurant was that when I called to inquire about the lounge area, I specifically asked if we could reserve a certain area that would've been perfect for our group of 10.  I was told that we couldn't reserve an area in the lounge and that it was first come first serve.  No biggie.  When we rolled up right at opening time (5:00pm), we asked to be seated in the area right near the hostess stand.   It was a u shaped area that would've perfectly seated our group of 10 comfortably.  But, the hostess said that area was reserved for a party.  Oh well great, that sucks. They sat us in 2 separate booths next to each other, but they were a little tight and one group couldn't talk to the other since they were side by side.  Kind of a bummer, but oh well.  

Moving forward, the rest of the meal was great.  The service was prompt and courteous.  Not to mention the Happy Hour Lounge menu is a tremendous value......$5 plates!   We tried everything on the menu and they were all great.  I'm not a big fan of raw fish, but my friends loved the texture of the sushi rice cake and tuna tartare.  Everybody loved the richness of the Mac & cheese, especially because it had just the right amount of truffle essence.  The fish and chips were amazingly light and not greasy and the tartar sauce was fresh and clean.   The maine lobster roll was also a bit hit.  Lots of lobster and super fresh.  On a whim, I did try the Heirloom tomato soup with the Lobster grilled cheese.  It was good, but the grilled cheese was a bit greasy and I just wish the soup had a touch of cream or something to give it a little more body.

First, our waiter was, quite knowledgable about everything on the menu, was comfortable making recommendations and quickly alerted those with a need to know about son Dale's shellfish allergy. He went so far as ordering bread grilled separately from the usual bread since shellfish are also prepared on the same grill. Nice touch.

Having mentioned the bread, it was crusty and grilled in butter & olive oil; just right. The corn bread was sweet, moist and didn't cry out for butter; a joy by itself. 

Okay, down to business...my appetizer, Thai Beef Carpaccio. Paper thin, beautifully flavored beef served with bits of Maine Lobster, pine nuts and a whisper of coconut with a spicy sauce; heavenly.

Sue had an exquisite Caesar Salad with crispy, fresh Romaine and highlighted by tangy, white anchovies...this was really a special treat. Order this is you're here.

My entree was a Mediterranean sea bass called Branzino; a flaky white fish baked in sea salt. The fish was adequately prepared and fairly tasty but didn't rise to the level of Sue's Caesar or my Carpaccio; still pretty good. It was served with a pungent squid ink risotto which I loved although it could have been served a little more on the ""wet"" side.

The wine choice, a Willamette Vally Pinot Noir was up to par and we skipped dessert.

Among other items that were gone were tuna tatare and shrimp and grits.  Both delicious and beautifully done.

Now the menu has been changed, with boring and uninspired items such as ""new england lobster roll"" which tastes like shredded imitation crab meat on top of a piece of toast.  And tomato soup is not necessarily something I want to have at happy hour.

The smoked salmon croquettes were good but tiny.  Not worth the money.

Their happy hour was usually a great value, and trust me, we make up for the value in drinks.  Very disappointed in their new bar food menu.  I will be searching for a new happy hour place to go to from now on.",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,3,0,2,LcOT51SSEiSgKLSnY26JNQ
594152,2011-10-18,1,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"My first time at a Michael Mina restaurant, after hearing so many accolades about his restaurants for years, and almost surely my last. The experience I had here was so horrifying, I can't imagine a second chance in the offing.

I was in a party of four. Nicely greeted at the front and seated. That was fine. Waiter introduction. Menus. The usual. Then it goes right downhill. This was after 7 pm on a Tuesday night. Restaurant was about half full. 

Almost right off the bat, the waiter informs us that, while there are tasting menus (five or seven-course), the ""chef's rules"" (his words, I kid you not) are that either the entire group orders tasting menus (and the same course amount) or nobody can. I have been to restaurants twice as expensive to half the price and have never in my LIFE heard of such a policy - especially for a group of this relatively small size. Anyway, we joke about it and give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt (and note - nothing on the tasting menus comprises of any items not on the a la carte menu, which is relatively skimpy if you ask me.) Anyway, after a few minutes of discussion, we all agree to go a la carte. 

We start off with some caesar salad and the dungeoness crab tasting appetizers. The salad was, at best, ordinary and when they call the green part ""little gem lettuce"", I think they should have capitalized ""little"". As for the crab....I'd love to review but this is now six days since I ate there and I'm wondering if it's coming via air mail. How does a finer dining restaurant completely miss a course? Damned if I know. In the meantime, there was also a bread basket. The corn muffins were actually decent so if you want to spend at least 80 bucks a head on a fine corn muffin dinner, you've hit paydirt here. The other bread was toasted sliced foccacia. Three of the five slices were not only over-toasted but were clearly blackened on one side. How nobody in the kitchen picked up on this before service is yet another mystery in this enigma. 

On to the main course. Two share the Salt-baked aged prime rib. Before being cooked, this was fun to look at - a 45 oz. bone-in monster embedded (and removed tableside) in a huge salt block. $170. Waiter asks how it's to be cooked and is told between rare and medium rare. It ends up coming back......medium (and overcooked medium at that.) Waiter comes......says he ""didn't understand"" what my company meant and told the kitchen to make it medium on the outside and medium rare on the inside. Of course, the question as to why a waiter would ""guess"" at how to cook a $170 slab of meat instead of, oh, asking the customers for specific clarification, is a great question. Plus one that didn't get answered because, after that (and offering no solution), we'd never see him again until the check came. 

My wife chose the mixed grill. Tasteless and presented like something out of a New York diner gone bad. A special moment came when she pulled up one of the calamari which, as she explained quite accurately if you ask me, resembled a burnt baby spider. 

I guess I got the ""winner winner chicken dinner"" choice by default - the branzino. I'll accept that it's a more difficult fish to prepare into something good but, for a place like this, I think three pieces of tiny cut and non-special cooked whitefish with squirts of three different non-memorable dipping sauces merits disappointment, no? We also had the horseradish potato as a side. Highly recommended if you're having sinus problems. The horseradish is so overpowering, you really can't taste the potato - and based on the yellow soupish goop it sat in, I'm not sure you could see it either. 

Anyway, while the waiter disappeared, we finally decided to call a manager who, with a nice smile mind you, left this whole mess with ""I'm sorry"" and ""oh nooooooo"" and then proceeded to become the waitress for the rest of the meal. Never even offered coffee, dessert, a suggested solution (particularly with the prime rib). Actually, at the end, MIA waiter, without flinching came back to speak. And he said...........""I guess you'd like the check now?"" I might expect this kind of attitude from a 68 year-old waitress in her 30th year slugging out sandwiches at the old deli institution, but at a premium-price fine dining place from a ""celebrated"" chef? 

I'm still deciding whether I was embarrassed (for choosing the place to begin with) , appalled or downright angered but, no matter what case, I obviously would never recommend this place to anyone even semi-sober. But I'll try to be funny about it. Prior to this on the same trip, I had great experiences at Sensi (at Bellagio, another MGM property) and Alize and a memorably sensational one at BOA. This place? Unless you want to toss down a few at the spacious bar before the Elvis show, I wouldn't just walk by this Michael Mina ""experience""......I'd run.

We had reservations at 8:45 on a Tuesday night.  We didn't wait too long to be seen to our table.  The place was crowded, but not overly so.  After about 20 minutes, someone came over and filled our water glasses, but did not say anything.  After another 20 minutes or so of being completely ignored, my husband flagged down a guy to bring us a bread basket.  About 15 minutes after that, he flagged down the hostess to tell her that no one had been at our table to talk to us yet.  A male server came over a bit later, and said ""Are you ready to order?"".........Nice.  I told him I had questions about the menu, and asked about a drink.  He told me he wasn't familiar with it and left.  A female server than came over and answered my question and took our drink order.  My cocktail was delicious, and was the only redeeming part of the dinner (Clockwork Orange).
We each ordered an entree and a side.  When I ordered my fish, I very clearly explained to the server that I am a vegetarian who only eats seafood and I wanted to ensure that there would be no meat on my plate.  She said of course.  Our food took a very long time to come out.  I expect my food at nice places to take awhile, but this was a verrry long while.  She brought our plates out and was describing them and I noticed MEAT alllllll over my fish.  I asked her what it was, she started explaining to me what prosciutto was when I interrupted and reminded her I had already went over my restrictions with her and I was very upset.  After maybe less than 5 minutes my dinner was replaced and looked completely different than the first one.  I have no idea how it could possibly have been replaced as fast as it had.  My appetite was pretty much gone at this point, and the food was not well prepared.  At all.  Even if there had been no other problems, I would not have been happy with my food.  My husband also did not enjoy his meal.  Also, our sides never arrived.
I could go on,as there were a few other issues (!) but this is already very long.  Basically, I spoke with the manager, in length, and our entire dinner was comped.  As it should have been.  My husband said he was afraid of a server spilling food or wine all over us, as that would be the only thing that didn't happen.",JGpFuFx1WBHEVmWyZhvm_g,1,0,1,twndKRbrqgdv7EuRD95PBg
638998,2012-01-31,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"I returned for a second visit a few months ago, and I regret to say that the quality has slipped a bit. It is still a very good and solid place, but it's missing the magic it had when it opened. 

The menu had changed a little, particularly the side dishes, but we ordered the same dishes as our first visit: the mixed grill and the ocean trout. We decided to splurge on the seafood tower instead of the usual appetizers. 

The seafood tower was great. I am glad to say that the qualify and freshness of the seafood is still exactly the same as our first visit. My ocean trout was exactly the same as I experienced at my previous visit. 

However my husband's mixed grill had an unpleasant creosote-like aftertaste taste from the wood grill. It was like licking an ashtray, and my husband did not eat more than a few bites and complained to the hostess. 

The staff was very apologetic, and discounted my husband's entree from the bill, but we got the impression that they didn't believe there was something wrong with his dish. It was perfectly cooked, but the ashtray aftertaste seemed to be ""open to interpretation"" with the chef, who reported that it might be the resin in the burning wood that didn't appeal to my husband's individual taste. I think the chef executed the dish perfectly, but there was something wrong with that wood grill impregnating the seafood with a sooty flavor- not the chef's fault at all.

The sides were extremely bland, I ordered the truffled mac n cheese but the truffles had since left the building. There were chunks of crimini mushrooms, but oddly there was no mushroom flavor to be found. I've made better mac-n-cheese at home, so I wasn't too pleased with the side dish. If I go out for dinner I do expect to be served something better than what I can prepare for myself. I may be a good cook, but I'm not a culinary school graduate. So when I eat at a restaurant of this price point, I expect the chefs to kick my ass.

The service remained very good, we have no complaints about the staff. If the overall quality of the food remained the same, we'd gladly come back. But for the price point there are better places to dine.",96EBrGCUvmMRh9ihKiLU-A,0,0,3,dmLpxDgtPCad3gj_9PgpGQ
657160,2013-01-28,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"The menu was developed in a creative and fun - yet sometimes unappetizing - way. There are several ways of preparing your dish (poached, griddled in cast iron, baked in sea salt, roasted over wood) and each preparation method has a set of accompaniments. There are three types of food (you pick one) in each preparation style. This is a really neat idea, and I enjoyed how easy it was to quickly eliminate a whole bunch of choices (eg: if you don't like a particular accompaniment or preparation method, you just eliminated 1/4 of the menu options), but several people in my party wanted a specific entree and didn't like the preparation method or side it came with. Overall a fun concept but perhaps not fit for foodies.

Also there was a great happy hour appetizer list and long beer list our waitress didn't offer until it was too late in the meal to order from it.

688106,2011-12-26,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Food service was slow. Many of our dishes came out cold. Some of the fish had a strange texture and taste, as if the filet had been sitting raw soaking in its own juices for awhile (their kitchen is extremely warm as they use multiple open-fire grills along the length of the kitchen....could it be possible fish may be overexposed to warm temps prior to being cooked..). Scallop somewhat undercooked. Portions are on the smaller side, relative to other $$$$ places.

I ordered the mixed grill (a bit of everything: fish, shellfish, etc), fried oyster + pork cheek appetizer (came out cold, pork a bit dry). Others had a variety of fish entrees, foie gras and scallop, and other appetizers. Sad to say, the table bread was probably the highlight for me (grilled to a slight crisp and flavorful). 

For the price paid and the expectation of a Michael Mina restaurant, and although the menu on paper looked inventive and interesting, our party left with an underwhelming impression, both in content and execution. Two fish entrees were sent away in disappointment.

One small observation: if you accept bottled water, be careful as the wait staff seems to have a mission to keep your (rather large) water glasses full at all times by default (not self-serve, bottles on table). One can argue this is attentive service but there is some zealousness here.... At the prices they charge per H2O bottle, you can see where the true motivation may lie (add to that automatic gratuity for large parties...).

Really it's 1.5 for me, pushing 2 stars.... Others may differ, perhaps we went on an off night. Even so, for a top tier restaurant, one would expect more.",EoTFGEAD_oLmZAl4jIEZGQ,0,0,2,ALqM4HUUaJ-GPW3AScPktg

2nd star- the shrimp and grits and kobe beef were delicious and i would definitely order both again.  if that was all i ordered, and i didnt try anything else, i would have given 5 stars for sure.  

3rd star -the portions imo were very generous.  the branzino was three nice cuts of fish, and surf and turf had a good amount of kobe beef and a whole lobster tail, and both came with three sides, which i initially thought would be more of a garnish but were decent-sized sides.  surf and turf had snap peas, good, marble potatoes, also good, and spinach, okay.  the branzino had a take on a ""B.L.T."" as sides, with a little arugula salad, too salty, and accompanying arugula sauce, roasted tomatoes and tomato sauce, tasty, and bacon wrapped fingerlings, good but too much potato per potato imo.  

why only 3 stars? because while the kobe beef was excellent, the ""surf"" part, lobster tail, was overcooked or something and chewy. not good, even with drawn butter.  also, the branzino was bland. of the 3 pieces, i only ate one.  3 other friends also ordered the same thing, they also only ate one piece.  the sides with the branzino, while clever for doing a spin on a blt and really beautifully plated, were not delicious and not enough to redeem the fish, which was supposed to be the star of the show.  also, i didn't really care to dip the fish in the blt sauces.  also, the truffle mac and cheese was okay, but the horseradish mashed potatoes had WAY too much horseradish -- like send-it-back-this-must-be-wrong too much horseradish.

823788,2011-11-26,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Having eaten at Michael Mina's other restaurants; I was somewhat let down for the total experience.  I was there the week of November 8th (2011) and must admit the ambience of the restaurant is five star, and truly creative and inventive with the décor.  The place is pricey (appetizers between $20-55), although I did splurge on the Kobe Beef Shabu appetizer ($52), but you have to splurge once in awhile.

The food was incredible and really lived up to Michael Mina's touch, but I must say if you are going to drop over $100 per plate the service should be much better, hence why this is not a five-star review.  We waited about 15 minutes after being seated in the restaurant prior to seeing any servers, and they did not come back until after we were finished eating courses to see if our food was okay.  The server was friendly, but again, I have had better customer service in much less expensive restaurants.

Having said that, the bar has the best service in the restaurant and each bartender went into detail about drink specialties and even promised us if we were not happy with their concoctions, they would exchange them, so the bar at least understands customer service.

Other good eats were the tomato soup and crab sandwich which was excellent.  Having been so pricey, I am not sure I would go back, as I did experience it, but there are other restaurants to try as well at Aria.",dZc-FKDMHpNMaLOJKFYpUA,3,2,4,DLYEIFa8nMyGtFIhg5BpiQ

In town on biz = expense account so I have thoughts of Robuchon, Guy Savoy, etc.  but he tells me needs to eat early ( 5:30) and limited time. So I change gears and thinking Scarpetta for some top notch pasta - but they don't open until 6.  next thought is a place I've yet to try - I opt for American Fish.

Decent looking restaurant but slight ding that booths  were too open - normally not a big deal but we were seated near a group which had a woman that simply wouldn't shut up ! I wanted to look over to see if they were even there to eat since she literally did not stop talking for 20 minutes.

anyways - start with a bread basket that has corn muffins and grilled bread with olive oil and butter offered.  Muffins were excellent.  The grilled bread decent .

I order foie gras, seared scallop on French toast with black berry.  For main entrée I opt for the charred lion fish with pork belly croutons.  We also order roasted mushrooms as a side.

I LOVE  foie gras yet it's literally been three years since the last time I ate it.  Man oh man - I was very happy with this serving - nice chunk of foie gras, perfectly cooked scallop, the French toast with the blackberry perfect !  This resulted in a ""moment"" - a fond recollection when I first tried Foie Gras - coincidentally, at a Michael Mina restaurant in san Francisco - Acqua - their signature dish was a ""stack"" consisting of a potato cake, greens, seared tuna and foie gras with morels sprinkled on the plate with a pinot reduction... 18 years ago ( wiping tears from eyes ) ahhh the memories !

anyways, a first for me, Lion fish - never heard of it, but after the servers description, I figure heck, let's give it a try.  Though the servers description was inaccurate ( ""similar to swordfish..."" ) it was flavorful enhanced by the charring and the pork belly croutons were a pleasant addition.

The mushrooms were decent though a little heavy on the butter.

We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir from a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Mountain area of California ( name escapes me ) 

Sorry, didn't look at the prices since my brother paid.

It was a little difficult to find as it's not located on the main floor of ARIA and is on the 2nd level across from Sirio and Jean Georges. We were seated right away as the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there because my mom is practicing for her AARP years and wanted to eat dinner at 5. 

I've been trying to get in the habit of turning away the bread basket so I don't fill up on it before dinner, but so glad I forgot to here-they brought out this grilled cibatta that was to die for. WIth or without butter, this bread was carboload heaven and I would come back just to sit in the presence of this bread basket. There was also a delightful cornbread muffin and I think some other bread in there, but the cibatta had my full and complete attention and the only downside to this evening was that my mom got the other piece.

I got the AF caesar which had the most interesting twist which I believe was dehydrated capers? The salad was deconstructed and garnished with anchovy, lemon, and these capers that were crispy, salty and melt in your mouth perfect. I got the branzino for the main course which was cooked perfectly and a great mild white fish. It's a fish that I'd recommend to those who say they don't like fish because it's not at all fishy and very filling. I'd never had it before and was really pleased with the flavor! It was served with bacon wrapped potatoes (can you really go wrong there?) and an heirloom tomato salad, which I really enjoyed as we say good bye to summer, thus heirloom tomatoes. For dessert I had the Valrhona chocolate custard which was  just as rich and decadent as it sounds. It was served thankfully in a reasonably small portion, so with some effort I polished it off. It's a tough job, but someone has to finish the chocolate custard.

Our waiter was so genuinely nice and kind. She checked on us a balanced number of times (not neglectful and not all up in our business either) and answered every question we had wonderfully. The manager was going from table to table, seeing how everyone's dinner was, which was nice to see-you just don't see that everywhere.

Being that it was opening night, we expected that the experience would not be up to par but we never imagined it would be terrible over all. We arrived for our reservation right on time and was sat by a confused hostess in a part of the restaurant that was apart from the dining room. (Mind you there were many empty tables in the dining room at the time). I asked to be moved from our out-of-the-loop ::wobbely;; table and they moved us to the dining room (finally). The waiter was extremely courteous but unfortunately he was not why we were dining there. The kitchen took about 45 min to present us with our appetizer. A crabcake. Literally ONE $18 crabcake. I'd rate it a 6/10 on taste. My poor boyfriend didn't like it....which wouldn't have been too bad if our entrees hadn't taken another 45 minutes. In the meanwhile the manager presented us with an ""on the house"" lobster roll which not only was disgusting but just made us more hungry staring at food we didn't want to eat. Eventually the entrees came. Mine was the sweet shrimp (served with the heads ::vomit::). Supposedly its cooked with some gourmet technique though it was worse than a 5 min marinade I could buy at the grocery store. My boyfriend ordered the pork.  Which was supposedly the ""kobe of pork"". Well they were right is comparison with portions and that's about it. The flavorless dish was smaller than your typical appetizer. They ended up comping our crabcake. Oh. And I forgot...our cauliflower au gratin side dish supposedly fit for two (it was half the size of any side dish I've ever had at any of Mina's restaurant). With that wait u think they would have comped the food we had to wait an hour and a half for! Guess they weren't interested in ours or our friends future business at all. No worries...they wouldn't have gotten it regardless.  Hey Michael Mina...this new venture is a lost cause.

Service overall is good, if a bit pretentious. The sommelier is quite  nice and her large ""silicone pair"" is one of the very few warming features in the place. The huge wine selection leaves you with about 5 crappy choices for around $50. The better stuff starts at over $85, with the bulk priced well over $150. I like to have wine with my dinner, not dinner with my wine, so paying $200+ for a wine to go with a fish tale is not what I consider dinner. If I want an Opus One (over $600) I rather focus on that and let the food be just an accompaniment.
The food was prepared very well, cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, that is the end of the praise. The dishes are truly uninspired. The entire menu and four preparation methods end up, in retrospect, as being just a gimmick. The entrees are described as being presented with stuff like morel mushrooms, artichoke, white asparagus and whole grain mustard. Do not be fooled, that is NOT a side dish. That is decoration on the plate. If you want a side you have to spring for the $12 rice and beans. I had the cornmeal crusted trout. Perfectly cooked but lacking severely in taste, even in salt. It is no more than a cornmeal crusted fish, some micro greens, a few pieces on asparagus and some trace of mushroom and artichoke. The sentence describing the greens is large than the actual thing.
All and all, I felt this place was an overrated, gimmick with few redeeming qualities (the silicone pair notwithstanding). Once is enough for me.",RRAg6LpmDUMq4TFD1Bf5vA,0,0,1,wc_lDyO763rwtbrdESfc3A

apprehensive at first, because i usually yelp new places, i still didn't expect anything of the place until i arrived home and did some post-experience research. it all makes sense now, it's a michael mina product, okay, okay.

seafood may be their forte but we were craving for a good prime rib and the entree ""salt baked prime rib"" piqued our interest (medium rare, warm center of course) when we perused the menu. the presentation was amazing to say the least. the prime rib was first rubbed with egg yolk and then encased in about 3-4 inches of salt. they brought out a white cocoon of an object, split it open, and boom, a prime rib was born!

it was super juicy, tender, and (fill in synonymous words with orgasms and taste buds)

at $85/person, the prime rib was for two. it also included 3 sides: potatoes, some sort of beats/onion side, and creamed spinach. there was also a dalloop of horse raddish cream that complimented the prime rib very nicely- it wasn't too bold or overpowering. house cab made for a good pairing as well.

like i said, it was a quick meal and we wanted to get straight to business so we were a bit sad we skipped on the appetizer and dessert. if i were to guesstimate the prime rib in oz, id say about 45oz +/- so bring an appetite. 

the service was great, from the hostess to the table, to the runners, and everyone in between.

what else to say. im probably still drunk, my wife took a picture of me on the ceramic floor of our hotel room, eating the prime rib at 5am in my boxers. it was the most amazing drunk food in my life.",Zx-d9C6ydLW62pCNU8-lZg,0,0,4,gERffYaZqptdLmY6AyDL4w

Tuna Tartare: extremely fresh tuna mixed with pine nuts, arugula, olives and topped with a side-up quail egg, a very creative presentation. 

Sea Salt baked blue prawns: huge prawns with uni aioli and pickled cucumbers had a hint of oriental cooking, very flavorful. 

Maine Lobster Corndogs: wow, this one is the exception, it has three pieces. Mince lobster meat battered in hot dog shape and deep fried. It is crunchy outside, but tender and juicy inside. And the dipping sauce was very appetizing as well. 

Prime Rib Sandwich: the prime rib sandwich was humongous comparing to other dish/plates! Thin slices of prime ribs were placed on top of a ciabatta topped w/ horseradish, arugula, and tomato. The prime ribs were so tender that they melted in your mouth! 

Fish & Chips: three deep fried fish nuggets with chips. That was definitely the best quality fish & chips we have had. The batter was pretty light so you actually get a good size of the fish meat, even though it was small in size . 

I was debating on what to order for cocktail, and the waitress made a call for me: she strongly recommended Gimlet. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be as good as I expected :(

We ordered a cocktail 10 minutes later and waited, waited, waited, 35 minutes later, I noticed other tables that were seated after us were already finishing their drinks. I asked our server, they apologized & 35 minutes later, we got our drinks. We ordered 3 appetizers, but only 2 arrived. The tuna tartare was incredible and the scallops with foie gras was amazing. My wife ordered the mustard black code (was AMAZING) and I ordered the cowboy rib eye, topped with foie gras.  The seared gras was INCREDIBLE, but the rib eye was fatty.  Not the mouth watering fatty that a nice rib eye is known for (which I was craving), but chewy fatty.  I had to spit out about 5 bites, because I couldn't chew through the fat.  Pretty gross.

1717611,2012-08-12,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Such a lounge-looking restaurant. And I feel like I totally scored with Happy Hour prices on their small tapas and premium drinks.

Happy Hour is everyday 5-7 PM. Making lounge dishes $5 each and cocktails $7 each. 

You can find the restaurant by taking the ARIA elevator towards the Elvis show on the second floor. I didn't really see big signs for the ARIA restaurants, but the security guard was super nice in pointing in the right direction.

The late afternoon snack consisted of:
 FROM THE BAR
* Sidecar / cognac, triple sec, fresh lemon $7 - Delicious. At first it is like drinking juice because you taste the refreshing sweetness of the lemon and triple sec. But it finishes with a smooth cognac ending. It is a wonderful drink. Not too girly, but not too manly. I strongly recommend it. I like how in one sip, you get sweetness and smoothness and cognac, but all at separate points of your sip.   
FROM THE KITCHEN
* oysters on the half shell / mignonette, bloody mary granité (4 of 5) - I am not sure what were the oyster type, but they were fresh and pretty sweet. I liked they had mignonette on the oysters. But I didn't really taste the bloody mary. Pretty normal, but pretty good for $5. 
* maine lobster roll / celery, parker house roll (4 of 5)  - A scoop of lobster meat. It was very refreshing especially with the celery mixed into the lobster meat. However, the bread was a little too thick cut. I had a hard time biting into the lobster and bread without making a mess.
* shrimp & grits / jalapeño, serrano ham (5 of 5) - Delicious. It came with two shrimps, but they were most flavorful. Not only were they delicious shrimps, but they had wonderful flavors. And the grit just melted in the mouth. This dish was surprisingly good, so worth ordering. 
* prime rib sandwich / ciabatta, horseradish (4 of 5) - Really good piece of prime rib and finely sliced. It was very nice quality meat. I couldn't taste the horseradish. Tasted more like butter. I could have handled raw horseradish. 
* tuna tartare / pine nuts, sushi rice cake (5 of 5) - I think this is one of the better plated tuna tartare over anything. The rice cake was fried and strong enough to hold the raw tuna. I have seen a variety of chips plated underneath the tuna tartare, but usually they get soggy. I think the fried rice cake was complimentary in taste and sturdy enough for the tuna tartare. This dish is great in taste and plating.

I really recommend this place for Happy Hour if you are in Vegas and near the City Center. What a great place to sit down and rest your foot and enjoy Michael Mina's creations at an affordable $5/plate. I super recommend this intimate place if there is two of you and trying to get to know each other a little better. I don't recommend the Happy Hour menu for big groups, not enough bites to pass around.",B856VSGCvHAB-mil7JVprA,1,1,4,mBg5yAKEbMNqISZ69CJ5Rw

Spacious table layout and entertaining open kitchen, it has a business-casual atmosphere within it's upscale flair. Very comfortable and unpretentious. 

We started the meal with a dozen fresh oysters as appetizers. They came dressed with this ponzu-ish sauce, fresh and delish! Entrees and plating were mediocre, kind of on the safe side. We had; 

Glazed Cod - great flavor and perfectly cooked. 

Branzino baked in sea salt - This was okay, very bleh. $50 dish? hmm, skip... 

Geoduck clam duet, sashimi and tempura - yummy! Gah, I wish there were more than 5 pieces each (see pic, too tiny!). I love textural food, this crunchy clam 2 ways was very enjoyable. 

Flounder - Another bleh dish, not satisfying to the eyes and not satisfying to the taste buds. 

Truffle Mac & Cheese - *drool* This was one of the best mac & cheese I've had. I normally don't care for truffle, but this cheesy heaven with a hint of ruffle... DAMN! 

Bacon Creamed Corn - Very well balanced with the sweetness of the creamed corn and the savory bacon, tasty. 

Dessert we had the chef's choice which contained 4 different desserts on one plate, they were all okay. Decent, but forgettable.

1807459,2012-09-06,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"I wish I could give zero stars for both the food and service and I wish I was able to read the reviews on Yelp before selecting this restaurant.

I wanted to eat at Michael Mina's namesake restaurant, but after showing my husband the menu online, we thought we should look for a restaurant with more seafood options, so we decided why not try another Michael Mina restaurant, but one that is centered on seafood, hence American Fish by Michael Mina.

Since we live in the Bay and are aware of his reputation here and in Las Vegas, we didn't think we needed to Yelp this restaurant, but again, we wish we had.

First, not all the options are centered around seafood, but this is a seafood restaurant. Puzzling. Second, unlike another restaurant I called ahead to see if they could accommodate celiac disease and was connected directly to the chef; here, my husband was simply told by the hostess that the restaurant was experienced in working with gluten-free patrons and could accommodate any request.

When we got there, we were a little late, but we called to let them know and the table was waiting for us, great, but it took forever for us to get anything in the restaurant, including a menu. What I don't understand is that there are two men in suits who are standing off to the side, laughing, taking with the servers and hostesses, but do no more than circle the restaurant once in a while. However, the service was so slow for our entire meal and we, and everyone else, looked like we were waiting for something.

Our server suggested one of the most expensive items on the menu. Usually I don't mind this, I get it, but I really did not like one of the ingredients, so I declined. I let him do his entire speech and then told him that we had dietary restrictions and he seemed phased, but did not change his recommendations when asked. So we decided to take a closer look at the menu.

When we were ready to order, my husband and I both ordered the poached fish, he the salmon, I the halibut, and the mashed potatoes. My husband said his was fine, but mine tasted like airplane food. When it arrived it was beautiful and the fish was so tender, but bland. There was a little bit of green oil and the bottom and I couldn't get enough. What really phased me was that when I was ordering I asked the server if I could change out the fennel onion rings for something more suitable, but he said they were just a garnish and didn't accommodate my request.

Really? Just a garnish, meaning that the executive chefs at Micheal Mina's restaurant are putting things on the plate that don't matter? I don't think so. Then when I asked for a coke he got one and rudely slammed it on the table. Why do servers get upset when patrons don't order alcohol? It is a religious requirement, get over yourself!

The mashed potatoes had so much horseradish that it burned our tongues like when one eats too much wasabi, yeesh! i have never not liked mashed potatoes until eating at American Fish. Dessert was nothing to rave about ... my husband took one look and commented sarcastically that it looked like they really troubled themselves to put it out.

Our server's arrogance and rudeness really killed the whole experience for us. Our bill came out to 140+ dollars. That is with no alcohol and a coke, dessert and tea. To date, this has been one of the most expensive meals, but also the blandest with the worst service.

1888552,2010-09-20,2,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"I've been wanting to try out any of the 17 Michael Mina restaurants for a while now.  Being in Vegas for a bachelor party and by request of the groom to be for some swanky tasty food Michael Mina naturally came to mind.  Knowing we were going to spend the day at Aria's spa, American Fish was an absolute no brainer.  

Upon arriving we were pleasantly greeted by hosts and were promptly shown to our table.  My first impression of the dining room was that It was quite open.  Its decor had a northwestern American feel.  Woodsy and tranquil are adjectives that first come to mind.  AF also sported an open kitchen which always ups the ante when it comes to restaurant dining experiences.  

The menu here is broken down quite differently than most restaurants and took a bit of at table studying to fully grasp its functionality. Apps and Main Dishes are all grouped together and broken down into 4 respective categories.  For apps: Shellfish, soups and salad, fin fish and surf and turf.  Main dishes were categorized by the cooking technique by which your protein was cooked: poached in ocean water, griddled over cast iron, baked in sea salt, wood-grilled and smoked.  I thought that this was a simple but ingenious way to break down the menu.  The one menu con that jumped out at me was that each cooking preparation was only accompanied by the same garnish.  In simpler words, all poached proteins on the menu were accompanied with shiitake mushrooms, couscous, and a lemon grass broth.  A bit of a cop out in my opinion.  

For dinner we decided to each order oysters for the table, one app, and one entree.  The oysters were okay.  They were actually pre-topped with a red wine mignonette and bloody mary ice.  I am a purest when it comes to oysters and would have much preferred to have straight up oysters on the half shell and topped it off w/ the garnish of my choosing.  

For apps we had the caesar salad, shrimp and grits, and the scallops and foie.  The caesar was pretty spectacular and was plated in quite a unique way.  AF basically quartered a romaine heart, lightly dressed each portion, topped it w/ parm, garnished w/ a sliced crouton that was topped w/ a meyer lemon segment and anchovy.  It was finished off w/ fried capers and olives.  YUM!  Definitely one of the better caesar renditions (taste and visual wise) that I've ever had.  The shrimp and grits was downright tasty goodness.  Fine dining comfort food at its best.  White cheddar grits, jalapeno mousse, crispy serano ham, and perfectly cooked shrimp!  My scallops and foie was absolute foodgasmic.  Three wholesome, fresh, perfectly cooked scallops topped with an almond crumble, and a piece of foie that was entrenched in tiny pieces of peach and red wine reduction!  I am salivating at this very moment just describing it.  Amazing!

For our entrees we each ordered dishes from separate categories: Mixed grill from grilled and smoked, bacon wrapped kurobuta pork from cast iron giddled, and Tasmanian ocean trout from sea salt baked.  The mix grill was a cornucopia of grilled squid, prawns, scallops, and bratwurst.  It was accompanied by grilled peppers, cherry tomatoes, potatoes, grilled lemon, and romesco sauce.  Each and every item was beautifully woody, smokey, and cooked to perfection.  It was a wonderful summer dish at the end of summer.  The Kurobuta pork (which means ""black"" pig in japanese) was quite the tasty artery clogger.  It was comprised of three bacon wrapped pork tenderloins, panzanella salad (tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, pepper), and smoked eggplant puree.  The salad was a nice refreshing accompaniment and the eggplant puree (although not so smoky and super acidic) worked well to cut through the fatty pork.  The salt baked trout was the most splendid, tasty, perfectly seasoned fish I think I have ever had.  Tiny crystallized chunks of the salt crust that it was baked resided on the outer ends of my portion made this particular fish to die for.  Exquisitely cooked to a medium rare, I couldn't have asked for a better.  After experiencing all that the garnishes were second thought.  But, if you must know it came w/ a pea puree, mint, cippolini onions and fried polenta.  

After only 3 courses all of us were absolutely stuffed.  Yet we still had to try a couple desserts.  We all shared the Banana Fritters and an assortment of sorbets (always my perfect/refreshing end to a super heavy meal).  The fritters were yummy.  Fried and crispy on the outside, mushy and soft on the inside.  The rum ice cream (hell yes rum ice cream) caramel, walnuts and banana mousse that was served w/ were beautiful pairings.  For sorbets we chose 3 flavors out of the 6 they had: summer melon, pear/plum, and blood orange.  Super refreshing and tasty.  Perfect end to to the meal!

The 'Blood and Sand' drink (strange name for a seafood restaurant dont ya think?) was very well balanced. For being a cherry brandy based cocktail it was paired with other aromatics that greatly enhanced it's tastes. Quite nice in my opinion. Could drink a bucket of it if it were priced just right.

The lobster roll off the happy hour menu wasnt too bad, kinda like a lobster salad it had nice notes of citrus but wasn't lobstery. The baby cilantro was a very nice touch.

I opted for the shrimp grits. Wanted to try something different. The prawns werent the freshest and one of them was over seasoned and REALLY salty but the star of this dish is that fried thin almost cracker like slice of pork...wow just...WOW that was an AMAZING slice of pork.

We changed to American Fish and were not disappointed.  We asked for a quiet booth and the hostess obliged.  Unfortunately, they then seated a party of 4 young ""hoodlums? behind us that must have come from drinking all day.  Immediately started dropping F bombs, talking in a yell, screaming for the waiter to ""get over here we want drinks"".  Must have been hotel high rollers because I can't imagine why a classy restaurant like this would not put a stop to this.

So we were heading for a 1 star experience until I complained to the manager, who immediately said he understood and allowed us to pick any open table.  We moved far away from the Animal House frat brothers and things got immediately better.

My wife ordered the wood grilled salmon which was simple but delicious.  I ordered the black cod marrinated in mustard and soy.  It was very good although I have had better.  The cod seemed to have been marinated too long and lacked the firm, flakyness I have enjoyed at some better sushi bars.

1990124,2011-12-30,2,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"GREAT experience overall. We had appetizers, an entree, then had a drink at the bar to cap things off. 

Had a 6pm reservation with my lil sis Jenni and although we were late, the hostess was more than welcoming - ""Don't even worry about it, we'll get you seated right away."" We were seated in a beautifully decorated booth, which was roomy and private. LOVED IT. 

Our waiter was very formal, although probably a bit too stiff. However, he probably just took his job really seriously, which is fine by me. He recommended the daily special, which was a Kobe beef surf and turf with 8oz Kobe beef steak and 1/2 a lobster for $86. 

Jenni was considering ordering that, but we each opted for the following:

Appetizers: 
-Nantucket Bay Scallop & Hudson Valley Foie Gras (with honeycrisp apple tarte tatin, macademenia nuts, elderflower gastrique) - $28
-Manhattan Clam Chowder (with oyster crackers and crisped pork belly) - $19

Commentary on appetizers: 
Everything was delicious. Jenni had foie gras for the first time and liked it - glad she had her first experience with such high quality one, as I've definitely had poorly prepared foie gras before that did NOT make it appetizing and would scare any person off. The clam chowder, as simple as it was, was absolutely flawless. Everything was hot and fresh.  

Entrees:
-Cornmeal crusted rainbow trout (comes with eggplant, squash, couscous, lemon caper butter) - $33
-Mixed grill (mix of fish and shellfish - comes with creamed mushrooms, colorful cauliflower salad, marbled baby potatoes) - $41

Commentary on entrees: 
The rainbow trout is their signature dish, and it is beautifully presented. The trout was flavorful, perfectly seasoned, and the lemon caper sauce was SO complementary! The vegetables were beautifully presented and each grilled to perfection. The mixed grill was a hearty serving of fish (looked like Jenni got cod, some shrimp, a few pieces of chorizo, as well as clams and diver scallops), plus three mini bowls for the cauliflower, potatoes, and creamed mushrooms. Everything was grilled beautifully. I appreciate that they took such care to make sure the flavor of all their seafood was highlighted. 

We then paid our bill and decided to get a drink at the bar, then head over to Jean Phillippe for gelato. 

At the bar, we met CHRISTIAN, who is a delight. Jenni asked for a recommendation and he suggested the Bramble, which has lemon juice, gin, sugar, and a touch of creme de cassis. I ordered the dark and stormy (rum, ginger beer), which was so delicious, I drank it way too quickly. Each drink was $10, which was very reasonably priced for a higher end restaurant. Christian, who is amazing, was so friendly and apologized so many times for making us wait (which, honestly, we didn't know was a wait-- amazing service, I tell ya). Loved him, and loved the experience. The water he offered us was no ice, Fiji water, which is exactly how I wanted it.

This was my first MM restaurant and I'm pretty happy about what I ate... the whole experience was just ok.  So, the 4 stars is for the great food.  Minus one for the experience. 

Two weird things happened. 
1) We were seated in that area outside of the main dining room, as Jessica mentioned in her review. That area really sucks. Loud music and feels like your in a cheap cafe. We were sat right in front of the window where the menu was displayed on the outside of the restaurant... people would come by check out the menu, check us out, then our food, then lingered... we felt like zoo animals..this happened several times and I finally had to asked to be reseated in the main dining room. The main dining room was not busy so that was strange that they sat us there. They knew it was a birthday dinner so why the crappy seating? hmp! 

Weird thing 2) The fire alarm went off half way through dinner and the waitstaff acted totally normal as if this super loud alarm wasn't going off. No apologies, no explanations. It went on for 10 mins. I guess it must happen alot...new hotel and all. 

BUT, other than that... we still had a good time and really enjoyed the food. The waiter was excellent and explained their whole kitchen/ cooking process to us. We all ordered fish and every dish was excellent.  Not a dry fish around.

Not up to standards of other Vegas celebrity chef, high end restaurants. Really disappointed. Cost was only 30.00 dollars less then Gordon Ramsay's and no where near the experience.",OdhUSNW6TIeYw9rIM1CDUA,2,0,2,Jd49Utp5eN2n5qY4hIYcNg

The food - fantastic!  Great presentation..flavorful and unique in combination of ingredients.   Why a one star rating?  Service..

Service kills any positive thoughts I had about AF.  With so many choices we have as diners, restaurants should put their best foot forward when it comes to service.  I do not accept restaurants providing excellent food and mediocre service.

We must have had the new server that they just hired away from Applebees.. and let me tell you after spending $300 for two of us I expect better.  He would hardly talk, and when he did, it was mumbled.  Hardly came around to see if we needed anything, was laughing and joking with his other table and barely said two words to us.  

Why the attitude I don't know.  It was that way from the start.  My recommendation is don't use your weakest talent to take care of your strongest customers.  Just doesn't work.   

Even after sending a quick note about out disappointment to their people.. No one seemed to care.  And at this point neither do I - off to new and different restaurants.",JVp-o0SNIW0cyd6Bj1ZhNg,1,0,1,Ocwc33EvOF1NelY6_uVpXQ

To kick off our bad experience, there was a reasonable prix fixe menu in the window which lured us in, but which was not being served that evening (we learned only after we sat down). The actual menu was 2X as expensive as the usual daily fare. There were at least 25 people working the restaurant that evening, including two hostesses on staff, but they didn't bother to update the menu in the front glass, which would have taken less than 2 minutes to do, so I can only conclude that this was an intentional bait-and-switch.  Deciding ""let's give it a shot anyway"", we didn't walk out then and there (but should have).  The food was ""B/B+"" overall, with absolute nose bleed expensive prices with crazy tiny portions (e.g., we ordered a side that was essentially mac and cheese for $12, but it was only about 1 cup in size!).  Worse still, the menu listed accompaniments like ""couscous"" that supposedly came with the entre, but there was literally less than a teaspoon worth of couscous with my dish (a chicken roast). Why bother to claim that 25 grains of couscous is on the plate in the first place?  The wine list is also beyond outrageous.  Then there is the ambience.  It is virtually just a giant room, extremely loud, and difficult to hear.  We live in San Francisco, from whence Michael Mina first built his empire, and sometimes we're slow to connect the dots, but after trying both RN74 in San Francisco, Nob Hill in Vegas, and now American Fish, we will never step foot in another outrageous, pretentious, overpriced and poorly serviced restaurant of Mr. Mina's again.

2166208,2010-02-14,1,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Best meal of the trip, best meal of the year so far.  The place was packed and we planned on waiting an hour or so before being seated so we took ourselves to the bar to have a drink... little did we know that the drinks were going to be amazing fun and we'd each have three and very quickly fill up that hour wait!  The girls behind the bar whipped up and recommended drinks and every single one was amazing, between the two of use we had 5 different cocktails!  The Nevada and Whipple were two of the best cocktails I've ever had in my entire life!  They may look like small cocktails, but they pack a punch, seriously.  Enjoy looking at the bar menu, many of the cocktails come from drink books from years past.  Tom Collins, Gimlets, you name it!  Very cool.

We were then seated at a lovely table by the window and greeted by our very sweet server!  I wish I caught her name, she was very polite and informative.  We started off with the chilled selfish platter.  Extraordinary.  Oysters, crab, lobster, some amazing sashimi with horseradish panna cotta.  I was not a fan of the geoduck, but it was interesting to try!  My ex-husband had the mixed grill and enjoyed every bit of it.  I tried a piece of his calamari and it was outstanding.  I had the big eye tuna and it was incredible.  Perfectly rare, perfectly sauced.  Perfect.  We both ordered from the Wood-fire section of the menu and received the best vegetables we've ever had on a plate of food.  So much fun, mini potatoes, tiny beet chips, orange peppers and more laid on vibrant romesco sauce.  Our plates were visually stunning.  We ended up choosing two sides, which I don't recommend, it's a lot of food, but we wanted to try the whipped potatoes and cauliflower and were not surprised to have been completely thrilled by them!  My husband despises cauliflower, has a very very serious hatred for the lovely veg, so much in fact that he'd really rather I not cook it the house because the smell makes him gag... guess who loved the cauliflower?  That's right, my husband!

The dessert menu looked beautiful but we couldn't fit another crumb in us!  Which reminds me, the blue corn muffins and bread basket were to die for.  The best EVER and I have consumed a lot of corn muffins in my life.  Soft and moist and beautiful.

I ordered the Lobster-Clam Bake for $78, my husband ordered the Bacon Wrapped Kurobuta Pork $34. The lobster and crab were badly over cooked and rubbery. The vegetables in the dish were tasteless and only took up space on the plate.

The pork dish was a mediocre dish. There was nothing exciting about it.

2206223,2010-09-13,2,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"This review pertains to their Happy Hour Menu.

The Skinny: gourmet comfort food at affordable prices (3.5), service: amazing waitress Carmen would take orders at happy hour pricing past the happy hour deadline (5), value - not bad - we ordered 8 items and had 4 items from the tasting dessert menu for $56 (enough for two, no tax or tip) (3).

So we hit up American Fish for their Happy Hour Menu because 1) who can resist the call of foie gras poppers or lobster corn dogs; 2) I passed my driving test!; 3) we were meeting friends for a good bye dinner (for me). 

We were served by our wonderful waitress Carmen who was not only very friendly but was extremely lenient when it came to the Happy Hour policy (she allowed us to order at happy hour pricing despite the fact that it was no longer happy hour). She also seemed interested in our tastes and was well-versed in the menu items. She also caught me admiring the coasters (they're really cute) and gave me a few to take home. Carmen - you're a five star waitress!

During happy hour, the bar/lounge menu is all $5. So we ordered several items: foie gras poppers, fish and chips, yellowtail sashimi, tuna melt, lobster corndogs, smoked salmon blt, truffled mac and cheese, prime rib sandwich. FYI - serving sizes are small so 8 dishes for 2 hungry people is a reasonable expectation.

Foie gras poppers had a nice texture but was really lacking on the foie flavour department. I kind of like to taste that luxurious liver-y aroma but it just wasn't present in this preparation.

Fish and Chips were not great - the batter was too fluffy, and the outer layer not crisp enough. The relatively same complaint goes with the lobster corndogs as well: too much batter, not enough lobster, not crunchy enough on the outside.

Smoked Salmon BLT had issues with seasoning and balance. I found the BLT to be overly salty (perhaps from the caper aioli) and the smoky flavours from the salmon and bacon to be overwhelming.

Tuna melt - the flavours were nice however the bread really didn't hold up to the filling on top. The bread was in that middle place - not toasted but slightly warm - I'm not sure but it just didn't work for me texturally.

Okay now on to the good news.

Truffled Mac and Cheese was delicious and fragrant. Often times, the cheese can be overwhelming and the truffle is often times lost in the mix. Not so here! Wonderfully mild, the cheese paired nicely with the truffle oil. The cheese sauce had a nice consistency as well (not too watery, not too sticky - just right). The addition of peas really livened up the dish, providing that small dash of sweetness to this well balanced preparation.

Yellowtail sashimi was a wonderful pairing of acidity and sweetness. The fish had a nice texture and matched well with the seasoning. My only disappointment was that there were only two small slices of fish on the plate.

Finally, my favourite savoury dish of the the night was the prime rib sandwich. The sweetness of the tomato, the robustness of the beef, the slight acidity from pickled onion - it all went so well together. I'm having dream of it already, lol.This dish rejects the fact that a simple roast beef sammy can be boring.

On to dessert. They now have a new dessert tasting in the bar area which is awesome! We selected 4 desserts for $16: the peach melba, the chocolate custard, the banana fritters, and the marscapone cheesecake.

The banana fritters were instant winners - who can refuse a banana that's been deep-fried? Delicious! Mascarpone cheesecake was light and delicate for the cheesecake. Great flavour and texture makes this dish a winner.

The peach melba was alright however you didn't get as much of the blackberry meringue in it - it just wasn't fabulous as I'd hoped. The choclate custard was good but lacked enough interesting textural contrasts to make this a great dessert.

Overall, the food was about a 3.5 star experience but when you factor in the service, American Fish deserves a 4 star.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,3,4,ceHYuVS3kPQ7eErJAnpLJQ

we came here on christmas day with my mom who was visiting from out of town.
it was just the 3 of us so rather than cooking at home we decided to take her out for a really nice meal on the strip.

our reservation was for 8:00pm and we were seated at exactly that time.
they gave us a nice sized booth, our drink orders were taken and drinks arrived promptly as well as our server who was so friendly and extremely kind.
it was service with a smile the entire time we were there.
in other words, the service here is exceptional!
hence the 2 star review rather than a 1 star review.

now onto the bad.....the food.
it's called american FISH, right?
so, fish is their thing, right?
you put fish in the name, you expect to get the best damn piece of fish you've ever had, right?
WRONG!

i ordered the mustard marinated black cod which was supposed to be smoked and wood fired and cost $55.
it came out on my plate hard as a rock with the fat all gushing out in nasty white pastiness.
disgusting!
our server was mortified and promptly took it away but also notified us that the party at the table next to us had the same issue with their cod...twice!
she gladly replaced my fish with something else.
i believe it was a rainbow trout and it was edible.

my mom had the mixed grille for $45 which consisted of 1 piece of fish about the size of a small post-it note, 1 piece of calamari, 1 clam, 1 mussel, 2 shrimp and 2 small pieces of chorizo (1 of which was so burnt, it was completely black on one side).

my hubby had the new york steak and he said it was decent but not great.

the sides were probably the best part of the meal - broccolini was cooked properly and the truffled mac n cheese was good.
i ordered the lobster bisque and the presentation was fantastic but the soup was less than lukewarm.

the corn muffins are amazingly tasty but also incredibly salty.

in the end, after spending close to $300 with no alcohol, i have to say that i will not return to this restaurant unless someone pays me to.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,10,3,2,LTHw5943X_TXyI2H-dekDg

The wait was not too long, and the experience was worth the wait.

I started with the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado) salad - which was awesome. The thick slices of smokey/ fabulous bacon  (see picture below)  were a great complement to the light and tangy vinaigrette, the crisp iceberg lettuce and the flavorful heirloom tomatoes. 

For dinner, I had the fire grilled salmon, which was incredible. In wondering why the salmon tasted so much better than every other pieces salmon I've ever had, I figured only that the quality of the seafood and the attention to detail in its preparation were the reasons why this dish was so exceptional.  

We also ordered two side dishes for the table; truffle mac & cheese and smoked garlic mushrooms. Both side dishes were generous in their size, and extremely flavorful.

We just missed their happy hour.  What a bummer.  They have a list of about 10 different appetizers to nosh at the bar, all which sound amazing.  We pared it down to 4 items for $28.

I had my heart set on a Dark n' Stormy but they took it off the happy hour menu.  Since it's only $10 regular price, I went ahead and got it.  This version is made with blackstrap rum, lime juice, and ginger beer.  Very, very good!  I love this cocktail!  

Both cocktails were very well made with the appropriate glassware and ice.  I would have come here so much sooner if I knew that their cocktails were so great.

For snacks, we had the foie gras poppers ($5 happy hour) and the Maine lobster corn dogs (also $5 happy hour).  The foie gras poppers are basically 3 tiny circular cut pieces of brioche with foie gras pate on top and a tiny bit of caramelized apple sauce on the plate.

The restaurant is inside the Aria, just past the buffet but before Jean Georges. It's a smaller place with wood planeling and an exposed kitchen which was neat to watch.

I was there the last week of August which happened to be restuarant week. I normally steer clear of restuarant week menus but there were so many tasty things to choose from I couldn't have picked just one off the regular menu. For $90 I definitely got my fill and I did the extra $45 for wine pairing.

Very tasty. Some of my favorites were the tuna tartare, the mustard baked cod (literally melted in my mouth!), a steak dish and on and on. Yummy. My friend got the bacon wrapped trout which she loved. Not to be outdone, we also got the truffle mac and cheese which was surprisingly good and I'm not a mac and cheese fan.

Our server, Shannon, took good care of us and the sommelier was very friendly and helpful. This place is $$$$.

The decor was beautiful to oggle at while sipping on some delicious cocktails and nibbling on small bar bites. We felt underdressed in some t-shirts and shorts but received great service regardless.

Our server was extremely welcoming and informative. Based on her cocktail recommendations, we went with ""Blood & Sand"" (scotch, cherry brandy, sweet vermouth, orange juice) which was sweet and apparently their strongest drink, and the more refreshingly tart ""Dark & Stormy"" (rum with ginger beer). $7 each.

Bar bites ($5 each) were the size of a square coaster so it was perfect for a very light, pre-dinner snack. Some people will complain about the portion size but this is Vegas.  

According to the server, we had chosen the top 3 most popular items:
-Oysters on the half-shell: 2 mid-size oysters topped with some flavored/salted ice. It would've been nice to have some extra mignonette sauce to go with it but they were fresh and meaty.
-Tuffled Mac & cheese: with mushrooms, this was my favorite dish! So flavorful and a little bit on the salty side. The use of white cheddar instead of yellow made it look and taste fancier.
-Lobster roll: lobster meat was pretty flavorful but I feel like this was the most lacking out of all the bites. It was really just a 1-person/1-bite portion and for $5, not worth it.

Main Courses:
Cornmeal Crusted Rainbow Trout: as described, with eggplant, couscous, squash
Mixed Grill: mushrooms, cauliflower, marbled potatoes, with their mix of seafood, I had two shrimps, squid, scallops, and a few other items that I cannot recall

Desserts:

it started with the hostesses when we walked in that were unfriendly and seemed disinterested.  We arrived at 8 pm for our 8 pm reservation and were told it would be a little bit of a wait.  We settle at the bar for about 15 minutes noticing the the restaurant wasn't really that busy, but still was unable to get a drink from the bartender before we were told our table was ready.  We found it somewhat humorous that we were sat at a table that had been empty from the moment we walked in.

We dig into the menu and realized that none of us got the insert for the tasting menu so we ask for one.  And they bring us one for the 4 of us to share.  Despite all these warnings we order the tasting menu with wine pairings.

From there on out the service just continued to be mediocre with some courses coming out with out any description and two wine pairing poured without any explanation.  None of the courses were bad, just none were very good and overall it was just a forgettable tasting menu.

The only highlight of the evening was the wonderful sommelier, who was entertaining and knowledgeable when he came over.  Unfortunately twice he left the responsibility of pouring to other waitstaff which was a mistake as they were just not up to his level.

Overall mediocre food, really loud, horrible service and definitely not worth the price.",7ZModbt0gE3PZi3fwzxF4g,0,0,2,d-Qd-qQ0u9AKjvbqxN1k9Q

This place is both a casual and fine dining location, you will see people in shorts to cocktail dress eating here. So whatever you are wearing, its fine.

I was planning on trying the Tasting Menu, but I needed to pace myself for the week of  grazing, so I went with the regular menu.

GREAT:
* TUNA TARTARE (22): wild arugula, quail egg, pine nuts, castelvetrano olives
   - this is the BEST tuna tartare that I have EVER tasted, it was well seasoned and fresh. I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing because we were sharing dishes so we could sample more items.
* MUSTARD MARINATED BLACK COD (54)
   - was concerned that there was going to be that ""Yellow"" mustard essence, but NOT. It was delicious, tender and buttery smooth when you ate it.

GOOD:
* DAILY SELECTION OF OYSTERS (19): half shell with Bloody Mary & Mignonette sauce
   - the bloody mary and mignonetter sauce have a nice kick to it
   - the oysters were small, but packed with flavor
* GRILLED PRAWNS and FILLET MIGNON: the prawns were grilled which gave it a nice smoky flavor. The mignon was tender, but good have used a little more salt.

I wanted to try the caviar, but at $350 an ounce I could not roll with the big dogs. I guess I will have to just stay with my Ikura to get my fix.",ymXzUYEAVXuF_7jJPSkQAg,0,0,4,zKjPgjH1jsv2rhad17wCVw

The stars of the evening were the Yellowtail sashimi and the Walu baked in sea salt.  Both were absolutely amazing.

The only place I would ding them is for little provenance liberties. For instance, on the evening we were there, they were serving Thai Snapper as a substitute for some regular menu item. While I suppose this fish can be caught off the southern tip of Florida, it's range is predominantly Caribbean & Latin American.  But, I suppose that's no different than offering Hawaiian big eye tuna -- a fish found in Atlantic, Pacific, & Indian oceans.
In addition (and I admit this is nit-picking), for a restaurant with a self-described ""American"" focus, the internationally sourced wine list seemed a little incongruous.  I get it, but it would be cool to see a wholly domestic selection.  Same goes for the cheese selection, only half of which were domestic.

On the other hand, I did love their nod to americanism with the PBR can, served in a foam koozie.  How could I *not* order that?!  That bright orange koozie has become an object of lust at the pool this summer.",aKGBTthIlxC2iJxDUMHs9g,1,0,5,-RVM3MSTKxf-lYVBBgzr0A

Next I ordered the the trout cooked in sea salt well it had no flavor it was very bland to sat the least. My bf ordered the big eye tuna he said it was extremely bland. We ordered three sides the brocollini was by far the best thing in the restaurant . We also hit the horseradish mashed potato was the worst mashed potato ever my little brother can make them better .

Good recommendations:
- The ahi tuna tartare - is a must.  (table side) do not miss out.
- The kale Caesar salad - great.  If you like Caesar, this one is made with kale, white anchovies and the dressing is super tasty.
- The mac and cheese - awesome, so you may have had mac and cheese before, but not like this.

Truffled Mac n Cheese: Macaroni and cheese dressed in truffle sauce cooked to perfection and served in beautiful copper pots. So good you probably won't want to share.

Fish and Chips: Lightly battered cod fried to perfection resting on a warm bed of fries. The best part? They make their own tartar sauce! Each dip will leave you wondering whats in it that makes it taste so good bite after bite.

Prime Rib Sandwich: Don't be afraid of the horse radish. It tastes AMAZING with the prime rib! Leave it on or get it on the side.

Natural elements combined with top notch craftsmanship and design of the highest order makes this place a sight to see in Vegas. Made everything else seem so tacky. I know - not a stretch. 
So - we chose American Fish based on price and the mere fact that we all wanted to fish. The place is bathed in low light with birch trees set behind the bar. Service was top notch from an attentive yet not pushy server. She handed us menus on wood. Yes - wood. So cool...went along with the whole natural elements theme that Aria shared with everything in this space. Started out with cocktails from their very interesting menu. I got a drink that was called ""The Drink With No Name"". All alcohol - drink slow. My fellow diners all enjoyed cocktails as well. I order the poached salmon. Their menu is offered poached, grilled, salt baked and one other but I can't remember. I liked that - interested and varied. So - back to the salmon. Cooked perfectly surrounded by a light saffron broth; not too filling and just the right size. We also ordered sides of cauliflower gratin and pommes frites. Both the perfect accompaniment. Wish I could follow-up with the dessert but we passed a gelato bar on the way in so it was imperative that we saved room. I would come back - absolutely.

Being a salmon connoisseur, I eagerly ordered the ""King Salmon"" on the menu.  When it arrived, it was clear in both appearance, taste, and texture, that it was a farmed raised salmon.  The server and chef insisted it was wild, but it wasn't even close to the meaty Wild Alaskan fish I know and love.  Nothing against farmed salmon, but for $34 a la carte, it better be what the menu says it is.  Nothing annoys me more than a menu that is either lying or ignorant.  The fish was most likely a king salmon from New Zealand (there is no such thing as a wild salmon from NZ, they are all farmed).

I would have given this one star, except that the tuna tartare and my dirty martini were excellent.  The roasted mushrooms were ""meh"", and for $12, they should have been outstanding.

2834400,2010-02-17,3,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"This was seriously sooooo disappointing.  I was responsible for picking this restaurant in the new, gorgeous casino/hotel Aria and I did so based upon Yelp reviews.  You people let me down!!!  

Not only was the food pretty terrible but the service was horrendous.  I booked a reservation (which we clearly didn't need since 9/10ths of the restaurant was empty...not a good sign!) at 7:45pm to make it to a 10pm for the Cirque de Soliel show at Bellagio, ""O"".  Needless to say, we had to run there after the final touch of the bad experience:  the waiter disappeared for about 30 minutes.  

We ordered the shellfish appetizer and both my friend and I specified we wanted it cold.  It arrived hot.  And when we sent it back, the waiter came and told us we ordered it hot.  Um, cardinal rule of serving is that you don't tell your customers they are wrong.  (I'm very new to shellfish and I've only had it cold so there was no memory confusion here, folks.)  

So pretty much that set the tone for the whole meal.  They have a fantastic cocktail menu that he never offered us until I asked...although the cocktails we ordered were far from the best.  

The entrees were disgusting.  I ordered the Salmon with some sort of soup they poured over it which had a predominate taste of salt.  The salmon was very rare--almost sushi.  Bleech.  I can't remember, unfortunately what my friend had but she gave me an ""ick"" face too.  

I should have stopped eating but the portions were so small I wanted dessert...so I ordered chestnut ice cream.  How can you go wrong with ice cream?  Well, it tasted like chalk.  

It ended up being about $125 each...wayyyyy too much for that crappy customer service and that lackluster of food.  There are so many great restaurants in this town...don't let what must be the friends and family of the owners convince you with just a handful of reviews to eat at this place.

I had an excellent experience a few years back at the Chef's other restaurant Nob Hill but Nob Hill is gone now so I thought I'd try American Fish.

One of the things that went wrong was the oil I received with the delicious breads. The oil had a garlic slice that was baked onto the plate so I know it has been threw the dish washer at least once because of how hard it was baked on. We brought this to the attention of our server and he gave us a proper oil with a fresh garlic slice that floated and butter.

Both starters were delicious. I had a Ceaser Salad that was made with Kale. The Kale didn't appear to be massaged but was still easy to eat with the tasty dressing and cheese. They added two breaded fish called smelt fries that were a very tasty treat. My husband had the shrimp and grits and he said it was very good. I enjoyed my salad but I do note the sign outside said it was made with Romaine and not Kale.

We receive our dinners and I notice right away it didn't match the description of the menu I was given inside the restaurant. At this time I didn't realize the menu outside differed from the menu the inside was using because they were VERY SIMILAR MENUS. And then THE BIG ONE HAPPENS my husband pulls a wrinkled piece of PLASTIC WRAP FROM HIS MEAL. So we have to tell the server our meal doesn't match the inside menu and we found plastic wrap in the food. So we eat at this point and honestly my fish had a nice wood smoked taste to it but it was slightly overdone but not enough to complain. My husband said his was very dry on one side but better on the other side. He tasted mine and said mine was better than his. For me I thought the roasted smoked were too smokey but they might be great for most people as I only like mild smoke flavors. The inside menu said that I would be getting Corvina with some sort of English peas but clearly I got smoked vegetables and possibly Sea Bass since the outside sign said sea bass. 

The manager stopped by and apologized about the plastic wrap. He said the fish there isn't wrapped in plastic and he just didn't know how that happened. He offered  my husband another plate of food. My husband declined as he was nearly done.

We received two desserts that came with our meals. Both were delicious and I would recommend either. But since I now know the inside menus differed from the outside menu I can't say for sure what they really were. I don't know if the management didn't change the outside menu to the correct day or if the server just handed me the wrong menu.

When the bill came we were told the manager took off our cocktails.

It's a shame a very nice concept of a restaurant with good recipes.

I would have given 3.5 stars if all went well but based the 3.5 on the preparation of the fish.",V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,3,3,2,rnLwXSEbOOFaZsjD6kLvGA

3014602,2010-01-08,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"American Fish is located in a small wing adjacent to a steakhouse restaurant.  The entrance is casual, with no doors and a simple ramp and stairs leading to the hostess podium.  Despite that, the decor is sophisticated and immerses the guests in a modern forest theme.  The beautiful bar backdrop of trees and mirrors that duplicate it into an entire forest is absolutely gorgeous, and the ceiling mimics a stormy sky with dark clouds, yet the feeling isn't heavy at all.  It's like sitting in a log cabin--a very expensive log cabin.

After being seated, our server was very attentive and timely with everything.  The menu is simple and I love the way it's categorized.  From land, to salt-baked, and the ability to order a seafood appetizer either hot or cold, it's vast but not overwhelming.  We decided to order according to what the server felt was exquisite based on our desires for the evening.  We had the seafood platter (cold), and for our entrees the server suggested kobe ribeye for myself and the Tasmanian fish for my husband.  With complimentary cornbread and sourdough bread (served with an onion and lemongrass olive oil and country butter), our wait for the appetizer passed quickly.

Appetizer: Seafood Platter 
It consisted of quite a few types of seafood, from Oysters to Abalone.  I have to say that the stone crab claw and chilled lobster were absolutely fantastic!  The preserved meyer lemon on the stone crab was to die for, and the only thing I really enjoyed in terms of the sauces with the seafood.  The rest of the platter was typical seafood fare, and not impressive.

Entrees: Kobe Ribeye with fingerling potatoes, sweet potato puree, leeks and crispy mini chips; Tasmanian fish with fingerling potatoes, carrots, and leeks
Overall, the entrees were lovely.  Everything was perfectly cooked to order, and well balanced.  The seasoning was on par, nothing too salty or bland, and the vegetables were adorable and very tasty to say the least.  We ordered a side of truffle cauliflower, which was FABULOUS.  That was the only highlight of the entree experience.  We then ordered the malt french fries because people rave about it, and if you like salt & vinegar chips, you will enjoy the fries.  Stay away from the tartar sauce, though, as it is too rich and doesn't even match the fries.  

Dessert: Coco nib ice cream with chocolate mousse and cake; Blood orange sorbet
The desserts were beautiful and fantastic.  I was amazed at how the coco nib ice cream looked like it would taste of milk chocolate, but was a beautiful dark chocolate on the tongue.  It was silky, as was the mousse and the chocolate cake.  I fell in love with that dessert and would love to eat that again.  With a lovely balance of bitter and sweet chocolates, that one plate took me on a trip around the world of chocolate, teasing my tastebuds from sweet to bitter and back again, and in a very good way.  The blood orange sorbet is one that I would order as a palette cleanser between courses, and had a nice sour to it, but finishes clean and sweet in the back of the tongue.

Overall, the food was good and the only things that I would suggest at this restaurant are the desserts, the stone crab claw with meyer lemon preserve, and the cauliflower side.  If you want a more exciting experience, try a different Aria restaurant.  This one is good, but lacked that ""wow"" factor I was looking for.

I could not vote 4 stars because I am not a fan, but a guest that was appreciative of some parts of the meal. Overall, a beautiful restaurant with fair, expensive food.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,3,Qo0fv5P2gDddjMMeLG1XmA

Since I wasn't that hungry decided to go with two appetizers: caesar salad and a lobster roll. The caesar salad was presented as three stacks about 3"" high of romaine lettuce leaves coated in dressing, each stack was topped with a 1"" anchovy, and a little bit of black olive puree drizzled around the plate for decoration. The caesar dressing was heavy and bland - tasted like mayonnaise out of the jar - and there weren't enough anchovies or olives making this completely tasteless.

Next came the ""lobster roll"" which was three small pieces of bread that had been fried in butter and topped with a lobster salad that was just nasty. The lobster was minced in a (a LOT of) aioli with (a LOT of) celery and tomatoes. Could not taste any lobster whatsoever  and overall was greasy, garlicky, and gross.

Only saving grace so to speak was the glass of red wine that my waitress poured quite generously. Overall two appetizers and a glass of red wine was $60. I have been to many Michael Mina restaurants across the country so was not expecting cheap but I was expecting good. This was NOT GOOD!",tMrFi4iLcktbL0xtQb2gwg,2,0,1,ACo7_R8-Ndb6MXqRHm13Kw

I had the cold assorted shellfish appetizer and was worth every penny of the $60+ paid. Everything was super fresh and delicious! For the entree, I had the mustard marinated black cod which though cooked to perfection, was a little oversalted in my opinion. My wife complained similarly on her entree too, so the chef is a little heavy handed with the salt. Overall a great restaurant but not worth the $380 bill. For that price, I would choose differently next time around which may account for the easy reservations I was able to make on short notice on a Saturday night in Vegas.

For the first time ever, Frank picked a dud. With Michael Mina's pedigree (and previous good experience in the restaurant in Bellagio that bears his name) we expected to be amazed and walked out shaking our head.

Service flat out sucked. It's not like they were busy - it was pretty much empty on a night where it should have been packed with conventioneers. The sommelier did not inspire confidence and we felt ignored all night. The food was completely oversalted, especially anything involving squid. It took hours to get the salty taste out of my mouth from the squid, although that wasn't the only offending fish of the night. I guess I should consider myself lucky to not have chosen one of the salt-crusted entrees.

The apps we tried weren't bad. One order of oysters came with two oysters, one topped with a mignonette, the other with a bloody mary granité. The crab truffles were three crab balls with a crunchy rice cracker coating. The BBQ meatballs had the best flavor of them all. The description mentioned baked beans and corn bread.

Right away I noticed the menu was different from what I say online, the waiter explained that they had recently changed executive chefs along with a menu change. He asked me if I was looking for something specific, I told him branzino so he suggested that I try the Zarkana Pre Theater Menu, as the sea bass that night was branzino. So I took his advice and did exactly that. The bread basket comes with these amazing cornbread muffins that reminded me of good ole Kenny Rogers Roasters, (remember those). 

My first course I chose the Shrimp & Grits (has jalepeno and serrano ham in it) this was really good, great flavor. My entree I chose the Salt Baked Sea Bass, this was good but it wasn't great. I wasn't wowed my any means. My dessert I had the Mascarpone Cheescake, this was delicious I also had a bite of my friends Valrhona Chocolate Custard, this was pretty amazing as well.

My favorites were the marinated octopus (so good we got another one!), lobster roll (not really a ""roll"" though - bread was a thinner, crispy-toasted variety) and the truffled mac and cheese.

I really liked the bar offerings - the whisky selection (especially rye) was very impressive. Good service as well from the friendly bartenders, who were also quite knowledgeable.

We did take a peek at the dinner menu to compare to our usual Michael Mina spot, even if we didn't indulge. Two of my favorite Michael Mina dishes - the tuna tartare and lobster pot pie - are available here, which is a nice plus and makes this restaurant a pleasant, casual alternative even for Michael Mina regulars. That said, I thought the menu was a lot more limited and less varied than I would have expected given the more-casual nature that this restaurant slots into. They also didn't have my absolute favorite Michael Mina dish - the caviar parfait (I asked). Still well deserving of 4* though.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,1,1,4,KLIqi6mdJdw9hsNw5W6AwA

It started with the service.  I had a 5 PM reservation.  The hostess asked me if I was going to the Elvis show.  When I explained I had a show at an art gallery and after would be going to Las Vegas Little Theatre for a play, she seemed interested but I took that as just being welcoming.  In fact, she relayed my plans to my waiter without me knowing.  After ordering, he mentioned that he was aware that I had a few places to go, and did I want them to keep an eye on the clock for me so I didn't have to be concerned.  Score many service points there.

Taking my order, the waiter answered the questions I had, and when I asked for his opinions on some things I was contemplating ordering, he was professional, friendly, and thorough.  More service points.

After ordering, while the restaurant was still quiet, my waiter escorted me to the glass windows that separate the kitchen from the dining room and explained the four cooking areas and the kinds of cooking sone in each--sea salt baked, open grill, pan searing, and sous-vide.  He also explained their use of apricot would for fuel and taste addition to the food.  Score many more points here.  I must mention what fun I had watching the chefs work behind the glass.  It was quite a show.  I also have a long explanation as to why they use apricot wood.

I started with Michael Mina's signature first course of Tuna Tartare on a small bed of arugula with pine nuts and a quail egg.  It was excellent.  The bread had been brought out by now, and I had two pieces of grill toasted ciabatta and one corn muffin.  Along with the bread was a small plate with butter and a container of garlic and rosemary flavored olive oil.  Wow, was everything good!

The main course was sea salt-baked Branzino with a few green beans, crispy fried polenta, some minted peas, and some pearl onions.  The fish and the accompaniments continued the winning streak of the meal.  Everything was superb!

The dessert course was Valrhona chocolate custard with red velvet cake, sweetened pecans, and some cocoa nib ice cream.  The custard was so smooth and delightful.  It was heavenly!

Everything about tonight's meal was excellent - the service, the food, and the room.  I really enjoyed this experience so very much.  I will be coming back.  And, I had lots of time to get to the art gallery near the Mandarin Oriental and to Las Vegas Little Theatre for the play.  A super night!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,2,5,yl4yDDYltVGv7tefDb5O4w

The service was probably the worst I've experienced.  We first went to the bar for a drink. The specialty cocktails were fun and good. The bar staff was great which I thought was a foreshadowing of the service to come. Wrong. The server gave us the least amount of attention she could muster.

Over all the meal was good, not great. We had appetizers and a bottle of wine. The wine list was a  good one. My husband ordered the special; lion fish. After the entrées were delivered (not by our server) we didn't see her again. Not once did she stop by to ask how our meal was. The lion fish was really not good, by the way. Long after we were finished our meal we had to ask the bus boy to get our check. When the server arrived she asked if we wanted desert. By then we were ready to get the heck out of Dodge.

I was taking some colleagues out to Michael MIna restaurants all week.  We were very impressed with his other two restaurants at Mandalay Bay and the Bellagio.  On our last night, we wrapped up our conference and headed out to American Fish.  
This restaurant is nothing near the enjoyable experiences we had at the previous Michael Mina restaurants.  
The hostess was very nice and welcomed us.  We went to the bar for a few drinks.  After being shunned by the bartender for twenty minutes we asked to be seated.  Apparently the bartender was two busy taking care of his 5 friends, than to tend to us. 
At the table it took some 15 minutes for our server to finally bring us menus.  It took another 15 minutes for bread and water.  After another 15 minutes our server takes our order.  
Our first course came out in a reasonable amount of time.  My friend had a salad, I had the tuna tartare.  At this point we were starving.  My friends salad looked like they dumped a ton of dressing on it, but she said it was fine.  I had such high expectations for the tuna tartare.  The previous Michael Mina restaurants delivered such delicious flavors, and with the name American Fish I would expect even better tuna tartare.  My first bite was enough.  The tartare was bland and the texture was mushy.  I had my friend try it and she had a look on her face that said yuck.  I didn't eat more than two bites out of it.  We called the server over, but she got called over by the table next to us and they didn't like what they had been served.  By the time she got back, I let her know that I wasn't too happy with the tartare and we were done with the first course.
Now on to the main course, we both ordered Lobster Wellington.  It was the most expensive item on the menu and we were looking forward to it.  When it was ready, the server made a big show of it before taking it to the back to be carved.  After our plates were in front of us, we looked forward to a good meal.  Once again, the first bite says it all.  The lobster was rubbery.  The flavor of it tasted like bad sea water.  We tried all the side dishes that came with it and they were just as bad.  The potatoes were rock hard and the spinach was bitter.  I quickly called our server over and asked for our check.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I asked if we could pay.
She called the manager over and they offered us some complimentary dessert.  Now I ask you, if you've been served a bad appetizer and a bad main dish, why would you want to try another dish from the same restaurant????  The manager said we should have let them know the food wasn't very good.  I think I did when I said I wanted to pay my check and the food in front of me is barely touched.  In the end, the manager only charged us for the drinks.  I recommend you stay away from American Fish if you are a Michael Mina fan.  His other restaurants on the Vegas strip are better examples of his work.  If you're going to charge the same prices as the other Michael MIna restaurants, then I expect the same quality.    American Fish is just an insult to Michael MIna's name.  If you don't believe me, go look at the menu, the Lobster Wellington has been removed.",NkTtD3GUQGorowLa9bS61g,0,0,1,zqn-etwNymUgkPRor6K_lQ

I figured I'd try this place while trying to find a nice restaurant to take my girl out for our 5 year.  Not that we went here but I found this place by visiting Michael Mina's website and saw that they had a happy hour.  

Walking up to American Fish in Aria is kind of intimidating.  Not because it's a huge restaurant but because you're surrounded by super classy and expensive looking everything!  

We were told we could choose to sit anywhere in the lounge/bar area but were warned that the tables were small.  They knew we were there for the food on happy hour so they suggested (and helped) pushing together 2 tables to fit everything.  

Lobster Corn Dogs - said to be the favorite 3 out of 4 people we were there with.  Myself included.   They (I think) mince lobster meat into a 1.5"" sausage shape, dip it in corn dog batter, and deep fry it.  The lobster meat is all there with very little filler if any.  Good taste, great texture, and good dipping sauce.

Truffle Mac - I tell you, this makes me a Mac Fanboy.  ZOMG SO GOOD!!!!  The perfect, harmonious blend of cheese and truffle oil made us order a second round.  Mainly because my girl loved it so much.  My only complaint is that it is a little salty.

Fish and Chips - I was still hungry so I figured I'd fill up on the chips.  Little did I know, I'd be eating perfectly cooked fish with a light batter around it.  The fish and chips both had a hint of malt vinegar which was a VERY nice touch on the chips.  

Those three dishes were the ones we said were worth it.  If you like raw oysters, that may be worth it too but they're not my cup of tea.  Everything else (especially the sashimi) on the happy hour menu is just okay.  The mediocrity includes their beer selection.  Anywhere that has PBR for $4 / can is just wrong.

4234381,2012-03-30,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"I've eaten at American Fish once during happy hour, and once for dinner during Restaurant Week Spring '12.

I actually really enjoy the happy hour here and think it's a great place to have drinks and stare at the forest illusion behind the bar with a handcrafted cocktail. Oh and a friend, I guess. Yea yea, all cocktails are handcrafted, but you know what I'm trying to imply. Fresh ingredients, no premade mixes. Yes. Their cocktail list is very interesting and has some classic prohibition era style options. There are egg whites involved. And they make for tasty libations. The appetizers were small, as expected, and delicious, as expected.

For dinner I was less impressed. We were a table of four with reservations, but had to wait at the bar for 20 minutes while they figured out where to put us. I've already stated that I love that bar.. I had no problem with this. What I did have a problem with was the fact that we got there at 9pm and left at midnight when ordering off of a prixe fix menu. For serious? It took aaagggess to get our first course. I thought I might die if not for the grilled bread and corn bread they served us. Once the food eventually did get there, it was super fresh and light and exactly what I expected. For my appetizer I had the shrimp and grits which was amazing (okay.. not light..). Also tried the calm chowder, and damn.. the pork belly was still crispy and it had a fantastic contrast of textures and a smokey undertone.. hands-down, best Manhattan style I've had. The mixed grill came with diver scallops, tiger shrimp, razor clams, sausage and salmon. Little bites of each, it was perfect and the sides that were served with it were good but so rich I couldn't finish any of them

All of the seafood is really fresh and I appreciate the cooking methods that showcase that and keep it really simple. If it's seafood, let it do it's thing, and they give it the spotlight here by either grilling, salt baking or ocean water poaching.

Now, for the value.. it's just not there.. but it's the strip! What do you expect? Seafood on the strip? Please, we're in the desert. It's for this reason, though, that I have a hard time enjoying meals on the strip when I know I could go to Spring Mountain and have someone's sweet grandmother make me something that would be more satisfying than this meal was. And that would be like an $8 vs $200 difference.

American Fish is exactly what you expect it to be and if you eat here you won't be disappointed. For the value (or lack thereof) and poor service in a fine dining establishment.. I'd give this three stars. Bumped to four for the awesome sommelier they have here who helped us pick fantastic wines throughout dinner.

When we went to dinner I tried a little bit of everything. I myself ordered the sea-crusted branzino which was by far the best dish I tried that night. A friend ordered the prawns which were really good, the hubby ordered salmon and two people at the table shared a mixed shellfish plate. Everything was really, really good. All of MM's restaurants have tremendous cocktail programs and American fish is no exception. They have an incredible cocktail menu, more than four pages long. Usually Iam wary of a place that offers so many cocktails because I am afraid that time and care has not gone into thinking of the cocktails. Not here though, everything is delish. This is where I first tried the bee's knees, a crafty little cocktail with lime, honey and gin. It is pricey, but it is well worth it. 

I have also been in the lounge area for their delectable happy hour. I concur with the Yelpers that state the portions are small. But I mean, that's what bar food at fine dining establishments is. And the quality can't be beat. Durng the happy hour, eachplate is $5 dollars. I mean, even tapas at Firefly aren't that cheap. I've tried everything on their lounge menu, mac and cheese, fish and chips, lobster roll, etc. and it is all delish. You also get to choose from a limited selection of their cocktails for $7 dollars.

I'm a cheapskate.  If I'm going to have $200 bill for dinner I had better be blown away.  I was, but lots of flaws kept this place out of the 5 star range. 

The service was very good.  Maybe not quite the level you might expect from such a fine restaurant, but this guy would have been in the top three Olive Garden waiters of all time.  I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing from the service that I would expect if I was paying that much. 

The beet salad was really good.  Flavorful beets with a great dressing.  The buffalo Mozz was kind of Meh.  

I didn't know about corn muffins, but they were the best I have every had.  A little sweet and a texture that I didn't think you could get in an oven.  Fluffy but almost custardy. 

The crab cakes were really disappointing.  They were meaty, but they were a little salty and maryland crab is just not that good.  These crab cakes were not $26 good.  

I was ruminating over the menu being like, ""I don't know if I want to pay $50 for black cod or snapper.  Then I saw the most gorgeous thing in the kitchen.  It was the lobster pot pie.  It starts in a massive copper pot, then the waiter comes out and cuts off the top pastry and spoons out the 2 lbs of lobster and vegetables covered in a sherry cream sauce.  This sauce was so good that I would bathe a homeless person with my tongue if I could use the sauce.  The menu says MP which shook out to $85.  I would get it again.  It's quite the experience. 

My wife got the cod.  It was offensively underseasoned.  Fortunately my lobster sauce came to the rescue of her pathetic accoutrements.

As a foodie who researched the location and was excited about a new dining adventure at American Fish,  I expected much, much more.",3qLXG1zXM06FyzApNZKGNw,1,1,2,P4GqVszr2W0EBcUCYfgZHA
4421083,2010-07-07,7,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"came here for Happy Hour:  $5 on all food from the lounge & bar menu, $7 on selected cocktails, $4 on selected beers, $7 on selected wines by the glass.

truffle mac & cheese - so you think Element Cafe (Pasadena,CA) has the best Truffle Mac & Cheese? you haven't tried the one here at American Fish.. it is SOOO delicious! Although it was a tad bit salty, but it was okay because the truffle flavor was so strong that made the whole dish so flavorful. That first bite of my mac & cheese w/ mushroom and peas, a BURST of truffle just waken your taste buds. It was so good that  I had to order seconds for this dish. 

oysters on the half shell - you get two in one order; the oyster was so fresh! the mignonette & bloody mary granite was perfect for these oysters.

tuna tartare - you get two small pieces; in my opinion it was not worth $5. The cut was so small that i can barely taste the freshness of the fish. All i can taste was the sauce they complemented with. It just overpowered the fish.

tuna tartare - it was mixed w/ pine nuts, arugula, olives and topped w/ a sunny side-up quail egg. This was pretty good. Although i think the presentation was more worth it than the taste.

sea salt baked blue prawns - you get two prawns with uni aioli and pickled cucumbers. This was just okay; nothing special. 

main lobster corndogs - you get three bite size corndogs. Basically, imagine a corndog, but instead of a hot dog, you find a mashed up of lobster meat that's made into a paste/ ball. Real lobster meat in here, none of that imitation stuff. 

prime rib sandwich - not your regular sandwich, it was more like a bruschetta. Thin slices of prime ribs were placed on top of a ciabatta topped w/ horseradish, arugula, and tomato. 

fish & chips - wow, i've never tasted such fresh fish & chips before. The fish just flakes off, the batter was not heavy at all, it was very light. The fries was delicious because they were malted-vinegar french fries! mmmmm!

I'd definitely come back for a light snack off from the happy hour menu.",Vp5DzIiP_MmaMZMZVFFltA,11,9,4,Kzc4dud8h10ZoBg7XyHQ_A

Be warned: If you come here for their happy hour and plan on being satisfied with just two plates (or even three) you will be sorely disappointed. The drinks specials are better than the food, but even then, they're a bit steep if you're coming for cocktails ($7) and they are very limited as there were only three specialty cocktails on the menu when I went last night.

My friends and I visited on a Tuesday night, right at 5 PM. That is the time HH starts and the time American Fish opens. You may have a tough time finding the restaurant as it is on the second level of Aria, by the Zarkana theaters. I simply asked for directions after getting lost once. I don't like wandering casino floors anymore, reminds me of when I used to get drunk at clubs.

The space is awesome, one of the best concepts for a restaurant I've ever seen. Behind the bar is beautiful mural of trees, over the dining area is a gorgeous blue ceiling. The vibe is kind of loud, but not loud enough that it is annoying at the bar area. 

As for food, we dined on the HH specials, which at least, the bartender did warn us would be small. Boy was he right. I got the following:

Lobster Roll: You get two, very tiny bite-sized lobster crackers. Except it's not crackers, they are actually rectangles of bread. Although the lobster was delicious, it was teeny.

Fries: I shared my friend's. This is probably the best bang for your buck on the HH menu, but honestly paying $5 for fries is way too much anyway. 

Beef Tartare: I'd never had beef tartare before, so I figured why not try it? It comes out in a bowl, with the beef sliced into the tiniest of squares, comes with a bready crouton. I enjoyed it.

King Crab Louie: I was still hungry after all that so I ordered what is basically a refined deviled egg. You get two, the crab concoction is stuffed inside the egg and it is deviled, plain and simple, yet I'm glad I got this dish because I loved it. I plan to recreate it sometime on my own at home for a party.

Overall, it is not the best, nor is it the worst HH in town. Of course it is in the Aria, so you have to take that into account. Get ready to spend the bucks or else be disappointed. Although the quality was there I just think the restaurant could afford to add a bit to the portions, come now, at least three lobster ""rolls"" if they're going to be less than the size of my pinky finger!

I would love to go back for dinner some day, but I would have to save some of my monies to do it since the pricing here is steep.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,3,-KUu_Rl4UepNCIyWTJYbow

To which it piqued my interest even more. And it was perfect. So perfect, I ordered another nearly immediately. Hey, for $7....!

Probably because we looked hungry and inhaled the first round in a matter of seconds (seriously, our table fell dead silent when the food arrived), we kept receiving more plates as ""compliments of the chef"".    Everything on the lounge menu is delicious and shockingly priced @ $5/plate. Although each serving is a mere bite size, I'd say 4 orders is a sufficient amount of food for a normal dinner.

I really appreciated the variety of ways they could prepare the seafood for you.  It was fun watching them using the different methods.

My course was poached in the seafood water.  It was amazing!!!  Who would have thought that preparing the seafood in a gentle water bath would result in the most flavorful and tender morsels?!    I think that is the way God intended on having scallops eaten!!!  LOL!

The portions are on the small side so consider that when ordering.

We always go to the bar for a few rounds before dinner and I have yet to be disappointed by the drinks.  The Dark and Stormy is fantastic and is very hard to find around Texas.  It's a dark rum mixed with ginger beer.  Very interesting and very good!  As we migrate to the table from the bar you really take in the ambiance and decor.  The ceiling is made of metal cutouts that resemble sting ray and there is a nice blue glow coming from being them.  The kitchen has a massing glass wall that divides it from the dining area.  Very cool to watch the chef's do their thing.  There is a grill right next to the window that constantly has a 2-3 foot flame flying out of it.  

Started with oysters, the small New England variety.  Delish!  For dinner I got the Wild Sturgeon.  It was baked in sea salt flown in from Hawaii and served with asparagus.  The fish was perfect.  Not too soft, yet still very tender.  Tremendous flavor.  We got the truffled mac and cheese and the horseradish whipped potatoes for sides.  Both we awesome.  The potatoes will catch you off guard though if you weren't expecting the little kick.

4528388,2011-05-20,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Oh American Fish, what a let down you have been.  I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now, and frankly, I wish I hadn't bothered.  First of all, I do not like the location of the restaurant.  It is placed right next to the hotel's two other restaurants.  This feels to me like a really expensive food court, where you take your pick of three choices, but end up blowing a few hundred dollars on dinner. 

Anyway, the real disappointment at American Fish lies in the food.  The best thing about American Fish was the bread basket.  The cornbread was absolutely delicious.  It was warm, fluffy, melt in your mouth scrumptious.  A little sweet too, just how I like it.  The hot buttered ciabatta bread was also great.  It was toasty, grilled, and crusty.  The bread basket led me to believe I was in for a treat for the rest of meal.  Lesson learned- don't judge a restaurant by the bread basket.  

We started with the raw seafood platter for two.  The seafood, although served on ice, was lukewarm and did not appear to be fresh.  Everything on the platter smelt fishy, and was very unappealing.  Thank goodness for the cocktail sauce, which masked this unpleasantness.  Also, the clams had grains of sand in them.  Shouldn't these be thoroughly cleaned?  

On to the entrees.  I ordered the mixed grill.  The seafood on this was decent.  However, it was served to me cold, after waiting for it for about an hour.  My friend ordered the cornmeal crusted Trout.  The texture of this was nice, but the fish was so bland! It needed some more seasoning or something! I can usually appreciate fish without any kind of sauce of seasoning, but the way this was prepared was definitely lacking in he flavor department.  

The service at the restaurant was terrible.  Although the waiter was friendly, we only encountered him a couple of time throughout the meal.  This was disappointing.  We also had to ask about four separate servers for more bread, water, etc.  Finally, we got the bread after about 30 minutes of asking different people.  We were a little annoyed, as that bread was so good.  The only thing that was so good.  

I will not be returning to American Fish.  Maybe for the corn muffins and an overpriced glass of wine, but next time I want some fresh crab legs, 
I'm heading over to Joe's.",v7f2KqSJONhQcLkRWgV9rw,1,0,2,yXO5WvIUslAAKodGJnZTpA
4591030,2011-04-18,1,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"2.5 stars rounded down. I was expecting more from a Michael Mina restaurant, though I should have known I would be disappointed given that it seems something is always lost in translation when notable high-end dining finds its way to Vegas.

The portions were tiny. I know the concept of quality over quantity is supposed to rule supreme when you've overpaying for a meal (go figure), but I could literally count the number of macaroni shells in the mac and cheese side with my two hands. Too bad since it was some of the best M&C I've ever had. Our other sides/apps were excellent as well (tuna tartare and yellowtail sashimi), and these parts of the meal are what really drive what positive stars I can give.

Now the kicker, the fish wasn't great, and by wasn't great, I mean it really sucked. I got the branzino, and the best way I can describe the taste is ""essence of fish B.O.""

I'll knock some more stars off for the poor service which other reviewers have noted. Our server was particularly slow and more-or-less ignored our group until he saw my initial reaction towards the branzino, at which point he rushed over to our table as quickly as possible to explain how my palate was not sophisticated enough to appreciate the intricacies of the fish's flavor profile.

I had the Mixed Grill special, which is a selection of ocean fish and shellfish had like prawns, scallops, calamari, a white fish called walu. It also came with red kuri squash, celery root and roasted mushrooms.  My friend tried the mustard-marinated black cod with veggies and sweet potatoes.

They serve appetizer size dish as well as specials on drinks. We tried their tuna tartar and fish tostadas. Both of them are delicious! if I have to choose one i will say Fish Tostadas is a must try! It is fresh and crispy I want to eat more as I am writing this review now! lol 

The decor of the restaurant is beautiful. Unlike Jean George and Sage in Aria, American Fish gives me more of a relaxed and outdoor feeling, even though the dress code is still business casual it is definitely more towards the casual side of dining experience. I specially like the glass/wall forest decor at the bar which make you feel like you are drinking in the woods. How amazing is that! And the open kitchen is fun to look at too! 

I will give a 7-star service if I can. Our server knows what she is doing and she even gave a little history behind each dish. The chef himself came out from the back and personally asked us if the food was ok. Ok? He must be kidding, the food is amazing!

4744401,2010-10-26,7,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"American Fish offers a nice little happy hour from 5:00pm - 7:00pm, Sundays through Fridays.  Happy hour offerings include a selection of appetizers for $5.00 each, along with a handful of cocktails, beers and wines coming in at $7.00 each.  Note that the appetizers are small, though!  About two-three bites per appetizier kind of small.  Between two kinda-hungry people we ordered six appetizers and two desserts, so even with happy hour pricing expect each person to pitch in $15-$20 (before drinks).

So, you end up here during happy hour, and you're wondering what to order?  Well, whatever you order, be sure to save a tiny bit of room for dessert.  You have to try the cheesecake!  This cheesecake has the softest and creamiest consistency that I've had.  It'll melt in your mouth and make you want to eat the whole thing when no one else is looking.  But that would be mean, so you really should order one piece of cheesecake for each person.  Honestly, it's a hard dessert to willingly share.  As for the rest of the meal:

Foie Gras Poppers - These are small.  Like, the diameter of a quarter small.  Tasty, but imagine if you got a cheeseburger the size of a quarter; small bun, small meat, small cheese, right?  How can you distinguish the flavors?  This is actually the first time I've tasted Foie Gras, so I couldn't really tell you how it tasted!  It was good, but I don't know why exactly.

Tuna Melt - This was another treat.  For some reason my tastebuds only like tuna if it is sashimi/sushi.  Tuna sandwich, tuna melt...no thank you!  But this tuna melt had some very good white cheddar that mixed with the tuna to make for a delicious sandwich.

Shrimp & Grits - It's shrimp!  With grits!  

Truffled Mac & Cheese - This was tasty since the truffle had a very pronounced flavor.  Not overbearing, but it had enough presence to give it a pleasant flavor.  None of that, ""This taste like regular mac & cheese!"" business here!

Fish & Chips - It's fish!  And chips!

Prime Rib Sandwich - It's not really a sandwich...since the prime rib is sitting on top of a piece of ciabatta bread; not bread on top.  Still, the prime rib was quite tasty.  The horseradish didn't have much kick, if you're into that sort of thing.  I know I am.  

Overall American Fish offers a pleasant happy hour.  The drink selection at happy hour pricing is rather limited when compared to their entire cocktail menu (three cocktails, three beers and three wines make up the happy hour selection).  Still, it makes for a nice alternative to a full meal on The Strip.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,10,9,4,573Fis5jnVrtN6elT4444w

Some pre dinner drinks with a generous pour by the staff we sat at a round table for 8 which really makes all the difference when you have a large group.

The never ending push for bottled / sparkling or not is getting old probably because I eat out so much.  Sommelier excellent again handling our wine requests and questions, though there were a couple of bottles of value on the menu the rest of the menu was entirely and utterly overpriced.

Have no clue what this was but it tasted like no Prime Rib I've ever eaten more like a Rib Eye steak that was baked. We ordered them medium and they came out completely and utterly well done.   

The side dishes were equally lacking: (2) horseradish whipped potatoes runny, (2) Truffle Mac and cheese runny, brocolini was ok and so was the creamed corn but unlike many places these sides were not splitable they were very small portions.

I will give you this American Fish--great ambiance.  Great for group dining (we had a party of about 10 and had a great table).  A bit loud inside but I think that's due to the reverberating wooden walls which is ok for again, group dining.  Not so ok if seeking a romantic dinner. 
As stated, the ambiance was definitely aligned with the the entire Aria theme---mod and hip. 

The food on the other hand....it's great that they have a short menu so the dishes are more exclusive but, if you're gonna do that at least make the meals more savory and less presentation.  You fooled my stomach with the fancy presentation and the lack of taste.

Commendable dishes---Green asparagus, ham, morel mushroom gratin (but that's just a side dish).   In my opinion, main dishes need a little work.  If anything, get the Mixed Grill but save yourself the pain of fish bones stuck in your throat and don't order the trout.",K13Ty9e1hnskD--_DykWMQ,4,4,2,B1VMUciMqAQXSUt9lApIaw

$5 bites, $7 cocktails, $4 beer and wine. 

The food is quality, but I warn is a bit small. I don't know if this would be a place to come for happy hour to make a ""meal"" as it might be worth it to just go get dinner. For little appetites, a snack, a pre dinner thing, yes. 

I had the Manhattan to drink and it was strong and delicious. Angela had two brambles. One was boozy and one was less boozy and made differently so I dunno what that's about. I perused the regular bar menu and VERY fair pricing on cocktails and alcohol. Bourbon list was actually respectable- a big plus in my book! 

To eat: 

Fish and Chips- good stuff. Batter was pretty crunchy and light, the fries are super crispy and are malt vinegar flavored already. 

Mac N Cheese- Really creamy, flavorful, and nice textures with the greens and mushrooms in it-  friggin good.

Lobster roll- tasty good mayo based lobster roll. The bread it was on was delish and buttery...I kinda wanted a huge basket of that. Kitchen gave us another one, gratis...schweet! 

Salmon BLT- pretty decent, but wouldn't get again. Not memorable.

Shrimp and grits- now those are some might fine grits! Super cheesy, flavorful and with little Serrano ham pieces. I rather even go without shrimp for more grits. 

Oysters- pretty fresh and good. I think they're a NW variety. 2 in an order with two different toppings. 

Service left a lot to be desired though. We started with 4 apps and drinks and wanted more. It was an hour later our server even came to check on us and I was about rife to not order more. Hopefully this isn't the usual for dinner service. We were in a out of the way lounge area which is also kinda a waiting area, but still not an excuse. We sat right by the hostess stand and she passed by us often. I mean I know it's not her job per se, but you'd think empty drinks and plates, maybe go call a server too.

I think I'll be back- but perhaps for dinner.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,1,3,ZSRmZUw1TttjY1kWJZynog

5094940,2014-02-16,14,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.

A puff pastry lid tops a ""pot"" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  

Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.

Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.

For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. 

Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.

The  roasted Park House roll was to die for. The crab cakes were the freshest and ""crabby-est"" without a lot of sauce or mayo to let the crab meat shine.

The foie gras  & scallops was just o.k. and a ""skip"" in my opinion. Not sure what was it with the foie gras but it did not ""wow"" me. The scallops were a little bland too. 

The mustard-marinated black cod was the most flaky I have tasted and it was sweet outside and no fishy taste inside at all. The portion of the braised chard was on the small side. I could have had much more. 

The phyllo-crusted sole ""fish & chips"" was bland and a ""skip"".

The fresh shrimp and lobster cocktail plate with fresh clams and oysters were just o.k. too. I liked the oysters (lemon scented) better than the (salty) clams; which were a little sandy.

Dessert:

Chocolate custard with (moist) brownie bites - winner.
Mini beignets served with chocolate whipped cream - a must-try.
Strawberry shortcakes with whipped cream - a ""skip""; the texture of the ""cake"" was more like a biscuit than a cake.

Next came the shellfish platter that included lobster, clams, shrimp, calamari and scallops. Everything was on par for what fresh seafood should taste like, except maybe for the calamari, which was a little saltier than I would like. The salmon dish came with beautiful pieces of asparagus, although I thought the sauce was a lacking in flavor. The white chocolate bread pudding that we ordered was so good; I would gladly eat that any day. It's not overly sweet either so don't be worried about that.

My perfect date, my sister and I checked out both the menus for here and Sirio across the way and decided on staying and found ourselves a nice spot at the bar. The girls got vodka collins to drink and I opted for the diablo- a tequila drink. Not my usual but it was my birthday so branched out a little. The girls said that the drinks were good but that they were very tart- my sister went so far as to add water to hers to tone it down. For the apps we chose a little of this and a little of that- What stood out was the lobster rolls- very tasty and all of the apps were good as well. The service behind the bar was excellent- the bartenders were fun and quick with service.

To get the bad out of the way: The restaurant is loud if you are seated at a table in the center, which is for the most part any party over 4. If you want to have a good conversation, stick to parties of 4 or smaller. The other small problem is that the service was very slow. I think we had close to a 4 hour meal.

The good: From appetizers to entrees, everything was fresh, delicious and thoughtful. Beware of the corn muffins or you may stuff yourself before the main fare arrives. For appetizers, we had the carpaccio, tuna sashimi, and grilled lobster mac & cheese sandwiches with soup. The carpaccio and sashimi were perfect. Now, I am generally not a huge fish fan, and I ordered the branzino. The serving size was perfect, and honestly, I would go back to have it again. It was perfectly cooked, and the accompanying sauces were just the thing. It came served with bacon-wrapped potatoes; those can't be wrong.

I had a bite of my husband's mustardy black cod, and I thought the mustard was a bit overpowering. I definitely prefer a simple miso cod. 

The other highlight of the evening was our wine selection aided by their super friendly sommelier, Katherine. She suggested a white burgundy, and it was the right call. Trust this lady.

Mixed Grill - selection of 2 prawns, 2 strips of calamari, piece of fish, 2 succulent scallops, and a slice of bratwurst. Yes. All was good but the scallops were the best. 

Escolar - comes in some kind of funky sauce but overall was cooked well. 

Sides: Spinach (we had them saute some spinach instead of broccolini), sweet potato with marshmallow (yum). 

Overly attentive service from the waiter, refilling water, to the somellier. Almost felt like they were trying to push us through our dinner quicker. 

If you are not a fish or shellfish eater, there is a salt crusted prime rib (serves two) that we saw a nearby table get and it was like cutting open a huge Easter egg to get at it. If that's not what you want, try someplace else since there is a limited to no Land lovers selection. 

The music selection was great, but a little eclectic. 80s and 90s. The bar area looked inviting and very lounge-y.  The menu online is generic and is different in person with seasonal specials.",P0pFmBdgsP4_ceJuRaMbBA,0,0,4,EJ8zAMvcoGX8BqhqxrtCQA

I stuck with a Happy Hour beer, but the cocktails were very interesting . Despite my coworker and I's love of vodka they informed us they were a rye bar and that's the way it is. I kind of hate rye liquor drinks in general, but whatever, I know that's the trend now. If you're into that sort of thing you'd love this place . I, for one, am anxiously awaiting for vodka to get trendy again - screw this whisky revolution ! 

For appetizers I tried the Shrimp and Grits and the Dive Scallops and Foie Gras. Shrimp and grits were great, but being the foie gras lover that I am, obviously this was my favorite!  It had pears and a beautiful red wine reduction - prepared perfectly and made my tastebuds very happy.

For my main I screwed up and ordered the Ocean Trout. To explain my screw up, I do order Ocean Trout every time I go to Nobu (which is often!). It's one of my top 2 or 3 favorite fish on earth, I can't get enough of it. I had never had it cooked, however. Cooked this fish lost it's beautiful delicate flavor and turned into a salmony nightmare. I don't blame American Fish for this, I just would caution other salmon haters that raw ocean trout is tasty but apparently when cooked it turns into salmon. HA

For sides we had the delicious malt vinegar fries and the truffled mac and cheese. I was disappointed by the TINY mac and cheese serving, but after 1 or 2 bites I was satisfied. It's incredibly rich and truffle-y, so no need to eat much .

Service was great and I love the eco-friendly decor. Despite my ordering screw-up, this place was overall a fabulous evening. I'll be back for a non-rye cocktail or beer and some foie gras in the future!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,4,4,4,TbUDdZwpzQ2oby33uETsuw

I wanted to ask where the rest of it went.

The menu is very boring also.  There is nothing risky about it.  You would think for such a nice place they would offer something a little more daring.  Nope.

Having made friends with folks in the Mina group and harboring a great respect for the chef himself after many stellar visits to his restaurants in various cities my final dinner prior to becoming an official resident of Las Vegas saw me seated at Aria's American Fish for a self-selected tasting menu based on classics and seasonal specialties, the newly reorganized kitchen working in full view and servers happy to engage in discussions of sourcing, preparation, and approach.  A truly beautiful restaurant, tucked away from the Casino in in typical Mina fashion (Michael Mina Bellagio, Stripsteak, Pub 1842, etc,) I was seated in a corner booth and greeted quickly with a glass of champagne and electing for a cocktail to go with dinner my meal began promptly with Chef Mina's classic corn bread in a muffin form and doing my best to temper eating these by the dozen I still managed to order a second basket as I progressed through six savory courses and two rounds of dessert inclusive of amuses and palate cleansers, plus sides paired with my final savory.  Focused squarely on the sea with fish generally out of the waters no more than 24 hours each and every plate that arrived was prepared to a lightly cooked exterior and delicate rare internal temperature, the tender scallop balancing a creamy piece of foie gras and the shrimp and grits particularly impressive while the lion fish was flaky and light, beautifully complimented by the brine of the mussel chowder and smoky pork.  Always happy to overindulge on dessert, even though the hush puppies were like sweet and savory crawdad doughnuts, the team at American Fish continued the trend of very impressive sweets that I've seen from Baltimore to Detroit to Vegas and San Jose with a quartet of options where doughnuts and bread pudding both shined and cheesecake wowed; the lightness of the mascarpone something I generally don't anticipate in the dish but truly impressive in the setting of light vanilla cream and reduced berries.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,1,5,jNq1SgIjyCvEh9j4-l0D4g

Our server was kind enough to greet us and offer us some suggestions on the menu, seeing it was our first time dining there.

With the rest of our dinner party arrived, we were serviced with care and attention that can only be expected by a restaurant house such as this.  The average ticket price per person is approximately $75, not including your choice of aperitif.

My friends and I were starving and since we were staying at Aria wanted to find somewhere nearby. The buffet line was too long so we decided to go to American Fish bcs it was close by. We asked for a table of 6 and waited in the lounge area. The restaurant was not too busy at about 7 on a Sunday but after waiting about 30 minutes, one of the employees came up to us asking what name the reservation was under because there was another reservation for 6. WTF!?!?!? They originally did not ask for our name AND we were the only ones waiting. I admit we were dressed a bit casually in jeans and summer dresses but we didn't look like bums! Since they were acting snooty, we decided to go downstairs to another restaurant. Some of us were really irritated because we had already chosen our food and thought some of the items sounded really delicious but with that kind of attitude we'll take our business elsewhere.",1aNHDx4GD9fL1ltPoYUQPA,0,0,1,widdNqA18erAOuThAeHr6w

I have my doubts about the whole Michael MIna thing, I mean it is almost beginning to be a chain as every city now has a Michael Mina restaurant. But, we were very pleasantly surprised.

The Con's:

* The atmosphere was good, but could be a bit better. Needs a bit more of a warmer feeling. Décor was good, and well organized, but we may just prefer a more romantic, upscale feeling. It was nice, but more business casual than fine dining. I guess this really isn't a draw back, more our choice. 

The Pro's:

* Odd to mention this, but the chairs are the best. I have never sat in a dining hair and been that comfortable for 90 minutes in my life. We both commented several times during dinner how great they were.

* Staff was very helpful and experienced. Upon ordering our wine, she came back and told us she had a better bottle and the same price point and it wasn't on the list. A great selection and we appreciated that.

* Food was exceptional and very well prepared. We both prefer healthier meals and they were great. I had my doubts about Mina's and most chefs just add seasoning and over due it then call it gourmet. Our meals were well prepared, and seasoned, yet not over done on the seasoning or presentation. Very impressed with this.

* Nice location in the Aria. We hate high end restaurants that are right on casino floors and you hear the riff raff. This was upstairs and had a great lounge near by for a drink afterwards.

Real glad we decided on this place. I had set my expectations low, but came away very impressed and we will return.",SryCBYxFOa6JU4ciYsllwg,0,0,4,nIXF2u_gjOFjHzAq5wmqbg
5431076,2013-10-06,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Typically gorgeous Vegas restaurant set apart by its rustic decor and classic American countryside character. Love the woodsy mural backdrop of the bar, and the side dishes are served in these little stainless steel pots - this is camping at its chicest, and likely its most gourmet!

Unlike L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon and Prime Steakhouse, which are fair moderate priced alternatives to their higher class sister restaurants, American Fish is actually pretty subpar for being a ""layman's take"" restaurant. That said, I'm a huge fan of Michael Mina at the Bellagio and decided to try American Fish simply to sample Michael's signature ahi tuna tartare. Obviously I can't compare my dish to the real thing, but the ingredients, presentation, and table side preparation were comparable to what I witnessed at the real MM. 

The tartare was just okay. I thought the tuna was cut pretty indelicately into hefty chum-like chunks that made chewing through the firm tuna flesh a bit tiring, but the pairing of crisp, sweet, light Asian pear with the slight robust heat of powdered ancho chili made for an on point flavor profile that complimented the rather mild flavor of the tuna nicely. I don't really care for pine nuts and asked for them to be left out of the preparation. The petite quail egg added a surprisingly overkill amount of fat to the dish - combined with the spicy sesame oil, it was definitely on the greasy side overall.

If the tartare here is comparable to the real deal at MM, then I'm pretty glad I saved a few bucks by ordering it at AF since it was just decent. The lemon Broccolini, on the other hand, was outstanding - it was served chopped into small pieces and lightly sautéed with fried garlic, chili flakes, and a generous sprinkling of fragrant lemon. So simple, comforting, and delicious!",9uIclQgMKYSt9qOZIEgBWg,0,0,3,Tg6i3PEDHvmFJyAYCQ3tlQ
5454634,2012-07-23,1,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"VERY GOOD! I'll do bullet points to keep this easy

1) If you are a local and show your NV license they offer 50% off bottles of wine up to $500 Sunday-Thursday, I will be going back just to try this!
2) Decor is awesome and the trees behind the bar are super fun
3) The Grilled bread was to *die for* so plain but yet so good
4) Ask for a seat close to the kitchen so you can watch them cook
5) Tuna Tartar with the little egg on top was extremely tasty
6) Oyster appetizer with the Pork Belly is perfect for 3 people to share and have a bite of each. Pork belly was delicious, oyster wasn't my fav; however, I did enjoy the cornmeal crust on it.
7) I ordered the Cioppino {I've been dieting and obviously based on my posts eating a lot of seafood}.  It needed more spice in my opinion, as I love spicy things, but there was a plethora of fish in it & the sauce was light and tasty [see pix]
8) my GF got the wild sturgeon baked in salt.  Was salty for me [even though they claim in won't be] but was OK. 
9) 2 guy friends got the Black Miso Cod. It was very good and came with 3 accompaniments [see pix]
10) It was a friend's birthday and we brought our own cake. The chef carved it up, plated it, made some chocolate designs and added ice cream. WAY TO GO OUT OF THE WAY for a nice time. A+

5499577,2010-01-21,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"FOOD:

Most of the food on the menu is seafood, however other proteins are also offered such as pork, chicken, lamb, and steak.  For appetizers, my party ate the dungeness crab cake, and geoduck clam served sashimi style as well as fried.  The dungeness crab cake along with the accompanying sauce was tasty yet nothing made it stand out from other dungeness crab cakes I've had elsewhere.  The geoduck clam served sashimi style was plated on a block of ice.  The portions were thinly sliced, and neatly garnished.  The geoduck was fresh and its flavor was natural; the geoduck was not flavored with other spices or additional flavoring.  

For the main courses, I had the Tasmanian Ocean Trout from Australia baked in sea salt with artichoke, olive and arugula.  The trout seemed slightly rare in the very center, but the outside was beautifully cooked.  The skin was crisp and added an excellent flavor and texture to each bite.  The trout was accompanied with two different sauces spooned across the plate and they were both great compliments to the protein.  Careful attention was paid to the plating of the vegetables that came with the trout.  For most restaurants the plating of the sides is often ignored, but the artichokes were neatly lined and separated by the arugula and other vegetables.  The texture of the vegetables was diverse.  The artichokes were soft; the arugula natural; and the small leaves of the interior head of lettuce crispy.  All in all, a wonderful dish.  

For side dishes, my party had the sweet potato puree and marshmallows, as well as the caramelized cauliflower and truffle gratin.  The sweet potato puree with marshmallows was fantastic.  It was sweet, smooth, and incredibly flavorful. The caramelized cauliflower and truffle gratin was excellent too.  The caramelized flavor dominated, but was not overpowering.  The cauliflower had a nice moderate slightly creamy texture.  I would recommend both sides.

Overall, the food was excellent.  All the dishes were flavorful.  Plating was detailed, clean, and artistic.  The portions were on the smaller side, but that is par for the course nowadays at fine dining restaurants; however, the food has a moderate richness to it which can make it filling despite the lack of sheer quantity.  Also, everything on the plates is edible.  I forgot which dessert the party ordered, but it came with a mint leaf.  Upon first glance, the mint leaf appeared only to be a visual aesthetic and garnish, but it was cooked, crispy, and sugared.  It is obvious that Michael Mina has put a great attention to detail into all of the food - not just the main courses, its presentation, and plating.  Very well done.

SERVICE:

Service was excellent.  Maitre d's were very attractive and friendly.  Waiter was knowledgeable, courteous, and very friendly.  Dishes were not cleared until everyone in the party was finished.  Water was refilled routinely and the servers minimized water splash by using a fabric napkin to shield the table from splatter (when ice falls into your cup).  Their movements were smooth, controlled, and not lackadaisical.  The entire staff was very professional.

ATMOSPHERE:

The majority of the restaurant is dimly lit which can make for a great night time romantic atmosphere.  The front of the restaurant is partially open with a small lounge.  A small section of the restaurant's dining tables are located at the front of the restaurant by windows allowing you to look out the restaurant into the walkways outside - although the view is nothing spectacular and is just of another restaurant across the way.  The best places to sit are probably in the main back area of the dining room because you may look into the kitchen.  The entire kitchen is viewable through huge glass windows facing the main dining area.  You can watch as the chefs prepare your food.  The kitchen is modern, neatly kept, and a visual pleasure to view.  Pop music plays at a low to moderate level in the restaurant.  I would describe the overall noise level of the restaurant as low, and it is easy to carry a conversation without raising your voice.

OVERALL: 
*Excellent food taste, presentation, and concept.
*Excellent service
*A relaxing, dim, and fairly quite atmosphere.  
*Pricey
*Modest portions",S1AIWZCa3shqYUIuuzTXNg,0,0,5,PXhxwqm0dN2KSoxhsnglig

Our server was really friendly and a wealth of information on all the cuts of fish and after some hemming and hawwwing...we went with the Maine lobster roll and tuna tartare for appetizers.  Both were excellent!  The lobster roll was more like a lobster salad tostada and I savored every freakin bite.  My wife's tartare was just as good and she deemed it the best tuna tartare she's ever had.  That says ALOT!!

We went with the waiters recommendations for entrees and got the Tasmanian ocean trout baked in sea salt and the mustard-marinated black cod.  Amazing cod!!!  I assume for Yelper, Seth Y, that this dish was the one that gave him his ""mental erection"".  The trout was great too but I couldn't get enough of the butteryness of the cod...truly worth coming back for.  

Thank god we didn't order any sides because we would've had no room for them.  The entrees came with some small sides on the plate and that was more than enough.  

Still had time before we were off for Viva Elvis so we got the Valrhona Chocolate Custard (aka the red velvet dessert thingy) which was the perfect ending for a fantastic meal.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,6,4,5,1WnwhWIbOaX3OAttxeuYkw
5570741,2010-02-03,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"Being a fish lover I was impressed with American Fish.
Entering the restaurant is a very pleasant experience.  The theme is wood and almost everything in this restaurant is wood -- the mirrored wall of trees behind the bar creates a cool forrest effect.
The back of the restaurant features a wall of glass with the kitchen in full view, including the long BBQ grills which is front and center.  I had a booth at the back and it was great watching the chefs in action.

The bread served to start were nice, it consisted of grilled ciabatta with plenty of butter (which makes the butter and oilve oil on the table rather pointless) and mini blueberry muffins dusted with paprika which was unusual but still tasty.

The main dishes (mostly fish and seafood) are organized in three catagories: cooked in broth, baked in sea salt, and grilled.  Everything on the menu sounded great and the selection of fish was excellent.  The menu also notes the country of origin of the meats which was a nice touch.

I ordered the Branzino fish baked in sea salt, which was flavorful and melted in my mouth.  The crispy skin complemented the delicate meat very well.  The vegetables on the side was perfectly cooked and the flavors were well balanced.

The waitor was very polite and explained the menu and specials very thoroughly.  Service was timely, but not rushed and our glasses of water was constantly replenished.

The only complaint was that the restaurant was very loud, probably from all of the wood surfaces reflecting all the noises.

The prices were reasonable for being on the strip and I will definitely come again (next time I will try the black cod).",yaWnpONXlvdXbi36aKcznw,2,2,4,d1RVuDxfdjiRkSD_8xsbWQ

On the one hand, they have a bar that turns out spectacular (truly) craft cocktails. Really impressed with this, in fact. 

On the other hand the food was a bit odd and consistently under seasoned.  The tuna tartare simply lacked salt but seemed pretty competent otherwise. 

The salt crust-baked snapper was just OK. Again lacked seasoning; skin was left on so it wasn't crispy (weird choice). Well developed flavors, but not worth $44. 

Oysters were excellent. And again - the drinks were spectacular.  A truly great cocktail program with perfect execution.

Brilliant Culinary LOVE, Ambition, and Excellence define American Fish to me!

Chef Sven Mede (who's a super cool guy by the way) and his ENTIRE staff truly serve to bring fine surf and turf to a whole new level!

""Michael"" was our fantastic Server here and he was flawlessly knowledgeable about all of the dishes at American Fish and extremely gracious and welcoming. We really felt like we had our own private dining room and were the only people here even though the restaurant was packed for dinner.  The dining room here is chic, yet fun, and not overly noisy. 

""Kathleen"" the Sommelier was THE BOMB and knew her stuff inside and out, in addition to being super friendly and personable, not stuffy, like some of the other wine experts I've met . Our glasses were never empty!

My bottle of 2000 Perrier Jouet Fleur was just the perfect pairing for all of our dishes. 

Even the bread (grilled ciabatta and corn muffins) were 5 stars, not to mention the dishes...

Sockeye salmon w/trout roe- Sweet, delicate, and DIVINE!

Shrimp and grits-My God, this was so Delicious!

Fried Oysters and Bbq Pork Cheeks-Just a truly terrific combination. So SWEET, juicy, and satisfying!

Chilled Seafood Platter-The BEST (move over Eiffel Tower @ the Paris Hotel) I've ever had in terms of quality and yes, I had this as my entree!

Mustard Marinated Black Cod-This is a fish I would not normally order. ""Michael"" assured us that it was stellar and...it WAS. Holy Neptune, it was buttery, tender, and undoubtedly one of the finest pieces of fish I've ever tasted! Love, Love, Love!!!!!

Our side were equally yummy. The Truffle Mac and Cheese was perfectly al dente and creamy. The Asparagus and Broccolini were farm fresh, crispy, and delicately seasoned!

As for the desserts, Oh how I cherished the Carrot Cake!!! Truth  be told, ALL of their desserts were FANTASTIC!!!

THANK YOU SO MUCH Chef Sven and ALL of the staff at American Fish for a truly excellent dining experience. You guys are now my #1 favorite in Vegas!!!! We'll be back again, very soon!!!!!",Ndc7zlrp_vY-MTkF3QChwg,4,4,5,jnpLO0SFJePwc4q422Td5Q
5595281,2012-05-14,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"The layout of the restaurant is very open.  There is an open kitchen in the back where you can see through the glass.  It's nicely lit and the decor is simple.  

Food: My friend had their 4-course tasting dinner for $85.  We ordered the chilled seafood sampler platter for appetizer and I ordered the sturgeon.  Let me first point out that the bread was amazing!  The corn bread muffin was especially moist and tasty.  I can't even imagine how much butter that little nugget had, but it was so damn good! 

Now my sturgeon was a bit on the fishy side.  I wasn't blown away but it had a unique flavor.  I couldn't care for the artichoke that was on the side but the squid ink risotto was BOMB!  My friend's tasting dinner was good. He really liked the Farmer's Market Salad.  He described that as every bite having a different taste due to the ingredients in the salad.  The 2nd cours of salmon was good but nothing to be blown away about.  The hollandaise was a bit much.  They ran out of lamb chops for the 3rd course, so he opted for the halibut and it was yummy.  It was different since it was cooked with braised short rib on top.  It was unique.  We weren't impressed with the dessert - and actually I can't even remember now - so that's how good that was - Not really!

Bottom line: If you wanna shell out some decent dough and get a good meal, this can be the place.  It was also very convenient since the sky suite entrance was literally across from the restaurant, making it a breeze for us to just take the elevator down.

            American Fish by chef Michael Mina surely deserved another review. It's been over 3 years since I last update it and a lot has been changed.

             A new executive chef Matt Voskuil, former Micheal Mina at the Bellagio has been on board for over a year now. He's awesome and talented. It shows through all the dishes. With the open kitchen, you can see chef Voskuil working hard and so focus on every single dish before it leaves the kitchen with love. 

           Along with him, the new GM Roberto Liendo, he took so good care of my clients table at American Fish during the CES 2014, I couldn't ask for a better service. Thank you. 

          Love their Happy Hour Menu - daily from 5 - 7pm $7 drinks / $4 beers / $7 wines by the glass.

- HAPPY HOUR MENU  only $5 each 

- new england lobster roll / parker house roll, chesapeake bay butter 

- beef tartare / crispy capers, whole grain crouton 

- truffled mac & cheese /  mushrooms, english peas 
 
- baked oysters / wilted spinach, pernod, parmesan cream 

- french fries / black truffle aioli 

Other dishes:

- GLAZED PORK BELLY apple & fennel slaw, crispy pork rinds - anything with pork belly will make me happy :-)

- SEARED SCALLOP & HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAS - savory french toast, parsnip & apple purée, spiced pumpkin seeds - a MUST ORDER

- Classic cheeseburger  / white cheddar, secret sauce - this was so cheese-it tasty.

- MUSTARD-MARINATED BLACK COD braised rainbow chard, baby root vegetables - this was delicious.

- GRILLED COLORADO LAMB CHOPS roasted brussels sprouts, spiced pecans, zinfandel reduction - this was so delicious. 

    Service was great as usual. The wine list is also very impressive, love the French old world collection. We did ordered some Chateauneuf-du-pape, Burgundy as well. 

     Don't forget to stay at the bar, to chat with the hot bartender Matt, he can whip up some nice cocktails for you and he is quite a charmer. He's been with the Michael Mina group for almost a decade, impressive. 

     We got to come back here twice during CES 2014 trip, with some Yelpers from the Bay Area as well. They all had a great time. So looking forward to come back soon. 1 of my favorite seafood restaurants in Las Vegas 2014.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,6,6,5,spCVbbRkBmkeoEuSiKotKQ

 I returned to American Fish, and I have to say that it was still just as good, if not better, than the last time.

This time around, I was pleasantly surprised to find the addition of their Happy Hour menu that takes places at their mini lounge at the front of the restaurant/bar. From 5-7PM daily, choose dishes for just around $5 bucks each, and wines/4 specialty cocktails for $7 each. A real steal for Las Vegas!

The menu is the same as last time, with a couple of specials (around 3) added daily. Their sides are still top notch here. The truffled mac and cheese and the sweet potato puree are outstanding and great for sharing.

Service is outstanding, but, during peak hours can get a little busy. Our dinner service took about 2 and a half hours (was seated by 6:30 and was out by 9PM) for 3 people. Granted, we each went thru appetizers, main courses & dessert/coffee, however, if it's busy, be prepared to spare plenty of time.

5650530,2014-01-01,1,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"If you have ever been to other Michael Mina establishments, you may be disappointed with American Fish.  It is essentially his version of Red Lobster.  The food is still decent, but not what you have come to expect from Mina.  It is a troubling indicator when the best dish is the lobster pot pie, the signature dish at his other restaurant.  Some interpretations of classics seem to miss the mark, such as his cioppino.  The joy of a great cioppino is its heartiness with rich sauce that you can't wait to dip your bread into.  Here, it is a bit paltry and served from what looks like a creamer and put on top of the seafood as an afterthought.  

Mac n cheese is not what most people would expect, overflowing cheesiness.  Instead, it is more pasta-like with a toss in cheese sauce.  I thought it was still good, but it can be a bit surprising.  Maybe he should have done it three ways.  I know it sounds a bit kinky, but I always seem to enjoy his three ways. The chicken dish was cooked perfectly although it was about as exciting as watching grass grow.

5674893,2012-11-14,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"I had tickets to Zarkana and we were looking for a quick dinner before the 7pm show on a Monday night.  This restaurant happens to be right around the corner from the theather, also near Jean Georges (coincidentally we were going to look at their menu and stopped here instead) and Sirio in a great location.

We glanced at the menu and noticed that they had great tapas items on their lounge menu and decided to go in.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, with wood detailing and a big, open kitchen.  The long bar is located to the right, with booth seating and also some tables looking out to the walkway (where we sat).  It seems we just beat the crowd!  We were quickly approached by our waitress, who was very friendly and also notified us that it was happy hour (SCORE!), and the items we were already looking at were further discounted to $5 each.  Double score!  They also had discounted drinks, wine and beer.  She also gave us their dinner menu and a pre-theater menu, which was 3 courses for $49 each.  That looked good, but I am not sure we had time for it.  I ordered a glass of Cava from the happy hour menu.  It was decent.

Everything we ordered was tapas style and shared between 2 people.  We got fish and chips, tuna tartare, prime rib sandwich, truffled mac n cheese, and the lobster roll.  Everything came out together, which was wonderful

Fish and chips:  The batter was amazing.  It was not greasy at all and was perfectly crispy and delicious.  The fries were not so great, but fries are fries and they were OK.

Lobster roll:  It wasn't really a ""roll."" New Englanders would die if they saw this little thing.  It was served more on a small crostini.  But they did not skrimp on the lobster meat, and it was really tasty.

Truffled mac n cheese: Probably my least favorite item.  It was good, but a little too runny for my taste.  The sauce just wasn't thick enough.  Also, it had peas in it, and that kind of threw me off a bit.  But the flavor was decent.

Prime rib sandwich: This was really good.  Again, not really a ""sandwich,"" but it was 2 halves of larger bread with fresh sliced beef. The bread had some sort of horseradish mayo on it and the beef had a little bit of greens on top with a slice of tomato.  It was delicious.  it was obvious the beef was made in house (I think).

Tuna tartare: This was by far my favorite item.  There were small, round pieces of bread with little clumps of tuna that were perfect.  They had a slight citrus flavor to them.  They were heaven!!

Each item was only $5 and were served quickly, so it was the perfect pre-show meal.  We even had time to add a mascarpone cheesecake to top it off.  It was served with a blueberry compote on the side.  

Near the end of the meal, the service was a bit slow, but the lounge and bar were totally full and it was just before show time, so the 1 waitress was very busy, so I understand.  I can't wait to come back again and try the full menu!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,0,4,Njnbw3ZuLIh1Uwt80dpt4Q

The King Crab Louie is a deviled egg with crab and a very small baby lettuce salad.  You get half an egg, yes half!  Not a whole egg!

The scallop was yummy, You get 1 scallop, but it's a decent size scallop.   I didn't care for the anchor steam foam, but I don't like beer anyway.

The grilled calamari was awful.  It was stuffed with chorizo.  It was dry and tasteless. 

The French Fries were yummy and you get a good portion.  

We also tried the crispy flounder.  This was $18, but delicious!!  

I had a $15 French Martini (not part of happy hour).  It was good, but not worth $15.

Go for the crispy flounder with the truffle fries and call it a day.",1mEwfwWvioSq-wrIvHOrJw,0,0,3,dg0hjz4tqdFmz1IVw7Zjmw

5817203,2011-06-12,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"I heard great reviews about this restaurant from friends and decided to try it. I was very excited to eat here after looking at the menu. We ordered an appetizer, which was small, I don't remember the name - seafood on top of small pieces of french bread (nothing spectacular). We then ordered the main course with side dishes that were small and pricey. The fish was described in ways I have never heard of before with flavors I don't think I ever tasted. I was expecting fish full of flavor that would wow my taste buds. However, when I got my dinner and took a bite I was very disappointed. The fish tasted like fish! There was absolutely nothing special about it to make it amazing and worth spending the $40. It was very bland and salty. The only thing that I enjoyed here was the bread basket. I would never, ever eat here again or recommend this place to anyone I know. Well, maybe someone I dislike. 
If you want to spend way too much money for bland fish this is the place to do it. 
On the positive, the service was outstanding!",LpViFojdVQmpnRfPX2T5nA,1,0,1,cT5egaJzOwUfEA4T8WTIsg

We sat at the bar and had Kelly as are Bartender . For me to say the cocktail list was great would not give this place justice hats off to the staff who executed cocktails to the tee. Every cocktail we had they nailed on the head , it is rare now a days that you can find cocktails that compete with the food. American Fish does just that not only were the cocktails excellent , the food was outstanding the best part about it is that my wife and i put are full experience in the hands of the bar staff for we did not order any thing . We requested to Kelly to give use your best apps, Entree, Dessert & cocktails. She not only pared our food and cocktails,  the service was the icing on the cake . We will definitely be back for another great experience.

Well Done My Man , Well Done

Cheers ....

Coming from the Pacific NW, Halibut is a fish that I have the pleasure of enjoying on a frequent basis.  This was as fresh as if I was back home in Portland, and the presentation was impeccable.

Enjoyed a delicious Chardonnay for around 40 dollars, which was unoaked and so worked with the menu impeccably.  

All of the people in my party were thrilled with the food, service, atmosphere..even when one friend kept asking random service people to ""turn up the music!"" (cause she likes to party) they were gracious, and seemed to oblige her.  Charming!

Without a doubt, our favorite dinner out in Vegas.  Great place for foodies, and health conscious eaters alike.  Delicious and well-balanced cocktails to boot.  Can't wait to go back...",3VGTg6Om3TX0IFR57pIJhQ,1,0,5,dmWVhfVzZ6wf8leiM08LBw

5951744,2013-11-17,0,LV-oONzEA22qiBEFK1sckA,"On a recent Monday we stopped in for Happy Hour.  We settled into a comfy booth in the bar area and had a pleasant experience.  There appeared to be just one server for the bar area, plus a bartender.  If you are in any kind of hurry, I suggest sitting at the bar, as those folks were getting things much faster.  Fortunately, we weren't in a hurry.

    I inquired about the white wine happy hour selection of the day and was given a taste of it, which was good because I had never heard of it, and can't remember what it was.   It was good enough for this gal to have a $7 glass of it, while Husband went with a $7 Dark and Stormy, which he liked enough to have two of.  For my second drink, I decided to switch to a Tom Collins, which was nice and refreshing.  I'm happy  to report that they don't skimp on the booze.

   Food-wise we started with the King Crab Louie, Truffled Mac n Cheese and Seared Scallop.  The seared scallop was the fave...it was one large, perfectly seared scallop with ""pretzel crouton and anchor steam foam"".  It was all that and more...there was some kind of green sauce as well as a type of slaw.  Love it when a dish exceeds menu expectations.

   The truffled mac n cheese met expectations.  It was creamy, but not too rich.  The addition of a small amount of mushrooms and peas added to the flavor nicely.

   The ""King Crab Louie"" was way below expectations, however.  The menu described it as:   ""deviled egg, baby lettuce, heirloom tomato"".  The only part of that description that was true was the deviled egg.  It was one egg, cut in half and deviled.  There might have been one itsy bitsy teeny tiny crab something, but if so, it was barely there.  And certainly no lettuce nor tomato.  Based on the description, I expected a small salad, with a deviled egg and a chunk or two of crab.  They REALLY need to change the menu to reflect that this is just a deviled egg!  

   All of these were fairly light, so we decided to try the Lobster Roll and the Baked Oysters with our second drinks.  The baked oysters were by far the better of the two.  They were pleasantly as described: ""wilted spinach, pernod, parmesan cream"".  There were just two oysters, but they were each pretty plump and really yummy.

   The lobster roll was pretty much as disappointing as the crab one.   It was more like a bruschetta.  And if there was lobster in the seafood salad on top, well, you couldn't tell.  If you had blind-folded me, I doubt I could have even detected seafood.  

    For the diner, it's largely about expectations...if management would change a couple menu descriptions to more accurately reflect what the dishes are, it could lead to expectations being met or exceeded, instead of disappointed.  

   3 1/2 stars would be more accurate for me, but based on three out of five dishes being very good and good drinks, I'm rounding up.",fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,1,0,4,qMiF_Ky3dPZXd2UJHufgtg

This is the third Michael Mina restaurant that I have been to in Las Vegas.  I wasn't a fan of ""Michael Mina"" in the Bellagio, but absolutely loved ""Stripsteak"" in Mandalay Bay.  I was hoping and praying that American Fish was more like the latter experience.  However, it was just OK.  It was good,  but nothing really made me ""Mmmmmm"". 

I came with my husband and my in-laws and we started with the HEIRLOOM TOMATO SOUP and the Lobster-Grilled Cheese Sandwich. I remember enjoying it at the time, but i can't remember much about it now. My mother in law ordered a half dozen raw oysters, and said that they were extremely fresh and the garnish perfectly enhanced the ocean flavors.  We then each chose a dish from the four different cooking methods: salt baked, wood grilled, cast iron griddle, and ocean water poached.  The wood grilled MUSTARD MARINATED BLACK COD  was very well prepared and quite tasty, but again, it wasn't that memorable.  Everyone else seemed to also enjoy their dishes, but when I just now, asked my husband what we ordered, he could not remember.  Perhaps we should have ordered a steak or the prime rib instead.  We enjoy eating fish but can't tell the difference between a high end restaurant and Red Lobster.  But when it comes to beef- our palates are much more refined.  

For dessert we shared the Chef's Dessert Tasting which came with 4 different items.  And I am glad we shared it because we were able to try a bite of everything.  And it was the perfect way to end an ""A-Ok and half"" meal.  I am glad I tried American Fish, but I doubt that I will return.  I will stick to Chef Mina's Stripsteak!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,1,3,yE7IQKPynUqEODDcOzeIAQ
