1014209,2017-02-19,0,NMEfM6_t_ebEtwxE_Rdf3g,"This is based on my experiences with gambling at this establishment. 

I walked in with a friend. We both intended to put $40 in a poker machine and have a couple beers while playing. We both assumed that we would be comped a few beers for playing.  I had three beers and lost $40 over an hour of playing. We decided to call it a night and we got up to leave. The lady bartender flagged us down and said we had a bar tab.  We told her that we both put $40 in the machine and assumed that we were comped the few beers that we had. She said only one beer is comped for every $20 and told me that all bars have this rule. I've lived in Las Vegas for the past 11 years and have never had to pay a tab for three Coors Lights after dropping $40. I questioned her about what she said about all bars using this practice and asked why she did not make us aware of this policy when we were over our comped beer limit. She said that I should not expect her to tell everyone the rules.  The problem is that there were no signs posted about the comped beverage rule.  I would not of had a problem if I was just told or a sign would have been posted. She then tried to embarrass me in front of other patrons and asked if I make it a habit of leaving without asking for my tab. Once again, I had three beers and put $40 in the machine. I've never been asked to pay a tab for so little amount of beer compared to the amount I gambled. My friend got a little more loud than I did because he lives in the neighborhood and has been to that location a few times and thought we were not being treated the way customers should be treated. The male bartender said we were being a pain in the ass and kicked us out and told us never to come back. Then the lady yelled how does it feel to be 86'd? 

I hope management reads this and understands that locals should be treated properly. Unfortunately, I was looking forward to dining there because I heard it has good food, but will not spend another dime at any of the locations because of one $4 beer that was not comped.",nPI0_4vdBbCfWl35RDR5RA,0,0,1,IT9fBpUtijX4wlipkV1lgA

Some of them dont get the concept of customer service(most do). I was in earlier today. I decided to play a video poker/keno slot machine. Long story short I put a $20 in the machine and won $200 right off the bat. But kept it in my machine to continue playing. After 20 mins I ask the bartender for a second drink. She replied rudely, ""ahh no, not unless you plan on putting another $20 in the machine or paying for it. Its $20 for every drink we comp"". Now my intentions were to play back I won, and probably then some. But that hadn't happened bc I was winning. I play at similar bars and as long as you continue to play your drinks are free. Not only did she lose my respect and a decent tip. I hope her superiors at least train her better with customer service. My hunch is this isnt an isolated incident. So it might be time for her to be let go. She was jaw droppingly unprofessional and seemed almost drunk. I was there on 01/15/2018 at 2:00pm.

The table service is much better as well with the addition of  servers Jurnie and Crystal. You won't find a harder working pair anywhere. 

There are still a couple things that would bring The Bar up to a Five Star rating. The outside patio is sorely in need of TVS. Some patrons looking to escape the cigarette smoke, myself included, would appreciate being able to watch the VGK's games and upcoming NFL games while enjoying food and beverage in a very comfortable setting.

Finally,  few more options on the dessert menu would be nice. Pie and/or cake would be an easy addition.

I'm glad I wasn't wrong, for the most part. Some group members have issues with smoking, which is allowed here, and I understand being sensitive to that kind of thing.  But the food is pretty good, and Jenn and Crystal could never have been nicer or more accommodating to our gang than they have been.  In fact, all the staff there are very cool. 

We've been coming here since about April, and nearly have half a year's worth of meetings under our belts.  For the most part, it's been doable, but as our group grows, we may have to relocate to another place that will fit our expansion.

There is additional seating in their covered patio area, which is great for those not so freezing nights or summer days. Customer service was great and the bartenders/servers were very personable. They greeted us upon entering and leaving. If you're in the area, give this place a try. :]

It's conveniently located in the Trails Village Center which has a lot of parking and a lot of other shops to visit.  You could get some groceries at Albertson's or some Christmas cards at Hallmark then head over to The Bar to grab a drink and some good food.

We came here during dinner on a weeknight and it was pretty packed.  We did get a couple of seats at the bar which was good since my friend knows one of the bartenders so we could chat with her while having a bite and a drink.  They have a good variety of beers and spirits on offer and a pretty huge menu with much more than the usual ""bar food"".   They have a full menu with a large apps/salad selection, along with full dinner entrees like a NY strip and a Red wine braised roast among a few other options.  They have healthier dinner options that come with brown rice, eggs whites, and steamed veggies.  A nice alternative that could leave some extra calories on the table that could be used for dessert or another drink or two. ;-)

We both started with a Hendricks and tonic and for dinner, i got the 1/2 lb. patty melt on sourdough and Mark H got the Buffalo chicken wrap.  Both meals come with either fries or tots.  One thing that was awesome was they make their own potato chips so with our drinks, we got a super hot basket of freshly made chips, those were incredibly delicious.  The patty melt was quite good as well.  I ordered the patty medium but it came closer to well.  The burger still had some good flavor so that was fine.

With the drink, chips, and fries, having half of my patty melt had me full so I had a midnight snack to take home for later.

The one thing I would've liked to see different is the ventilation in there.  It's a smoking establishment and the smoke seems to just linger.    As soon as you step into the entrance, the smell of smoke overwhelms you and when you leave, your clothes smell like cigarette smoke.

There is a professional way of going about your job, this gaming inspector needs either an attitude adjustment or a job out of the public eye.",8r0Q92-ciYS9f0wqR1w1Gw,1,0,5,fysAUscEbxzTujAU2BLJow

I left the mailer in the car since it didn't say you need to show it. I asked about the promo and I was told that it ended. When I questioned them about the mailer some punk putz behind the bar told me to lower my voice( music was rather loud). So of course I whispered so the putz couldn't hear a word.   Bottom line is I went to the car, brought in the coupon and then I was told I didn't need it. They said they thought I was asking about a discount on food.  They were just trying to beat me out of $20. Fortunately I beat them out of $56. Doubt I'll make it a regular haunt which it could have been since it's only 5 minutes from home.  I'll stick to the Rampart where they know how to treat guests.  Too bad so many joints just don't understand customer service.

4484701,2016-11-06,3,NMEfM6_t_ebEtwxE_Rdf3g,"I eagerly awaited the debut of The Bar, so close to home that I could walk there.  Well, I could.  But I didn't.  Construction seemed to take forever, so I assumed that it would be a really great-looking place.  Never assume, my mama always told me.

Except for the huge bar in the heart of the oddly-shaped room, we were struck by the very ordinariness of the dingy brown booths, and how few tables there were.  In fact, there's only one table-height table, and that has half a booth for seating.  There are a few larger oblong pub-height tables, and all the rest are booths - raised booths.  And not one of them was made for short people like us.  Oh, they had footrests, but those were narrow and recessed underneath the seats.  So our feet dangled uncomfortably, like little kids, during the entire meal.  Even one of the workers, who shall remain unidentified to protect his/her job, must have noticed our discomfort, and remarked that they'd told the owner more than once that he needs more ""real"" tables.

It's a bar, so of course there are lots of TVs.  For half of our meal we were the unfortunate witnesses to two tables screaming at each other non-stop as a football game was playing out.  Not the bar's fault, of course, but the cacophony further added to checklist.  We breathed a sigh of relief when they finally cashed out and left.  I guess it comes with the territory.

On the positive side, our server, Jamie, was terrific - charming, patient, and attentive.  

We ordered a Reuben and a pastrami, both on pretzel buns, adding a side salad.  My husband had soup instead of fries, I had the tater tots, and we shared the sandwiches.  The soup, chicken vegetable, was excellent and not oversalty. I don't quite understand why there's an upcharge for having it instead of the fries/tots choice.  We also ordered a side salad, and that was NOT excellent.  Iceberg lettuce, some of it brown, cucumber pieces that were frozen/defrosted, and lots of tiny salami slices, with cheese and some tired croutons.  When this ghastly mess was pointed out, there was no attempt to change it or remove it from the bill, but it truly was awful.

The meats in our sandwiches were good, though I couldn't distinguish the corned beef from the pastrami.  The pretzel buns were anything but - didn't look like 'em, didn't taste like 'em.  Reubens should have sauerkraut, not cole slaw, as this one did, and this cole slaw had too much mayo and was too drippy to be on a 
'wich.  Overall, though, the sandwiches passed muster.  But not mustard, which we had to ask for, though the menu said the pastrami came with stoneground mustard.

I checked out the patio.  Oh, that's where the tables went!  It's a big patio and it could be beautiful and inviting.  No fire pit. No heaters.  It's just a place that holds the tables that should be inside, at least some of them. It's fine if you want to sit outside, but it's not compelling. 

In the end, it was an okay experience.  Not A-okay.  Just okay.  I wanted to love it.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,6,3,nQjByddr1sznkdt8LKqpvA

We heard from our neighbor this place was pretty good, and offering up some decent eats!!

Last Saturday I called in a order for some food to go and the customer service was very friendly which was a great start! I think his name was Nick and he was pretty eager to do whatever it took to ensure our happiness as a customer. 

This was tried and true given my indecisiveness on what kind of bar food I wanted. Was it nachos, mini corn dogs, burgers, maybe even breakfast, heck I wasn't sure?!? I told him my neighbor said the mini corn dogs were pretty good and for under 10 bucks for a large portion of them. I decided mini corn dogs it was. He said 10 minutes and the order would be ready. Sounded good to me. :)

We cruised on down and I was immediately impressed with the outdoor seating. Super nice and if the weather is permitting, I would probably opt for outdoors anytime.

Next we went in and it was pretty cool inside. Plenty of seating, booths were spacious enough and it wasn't  crammed at all. I'm not a drinker so I must be fair in saying from that perspective I'm unable to give that assessment. 

Important to note is that this place was very CLEAN!! That is huge with me given that I was getting my food from here. Service was quick and friendly! We grabbed the food and we went home to give them a try.

Mini corn dogs were good, however just a little too salty for my liking. My recommendation would be to chill on the salt and let the patron salt to their liking. ;) To be honest the mini corn dogs were able to stand on their own and didn't need any salt at all! That was the majority's ruling because these dogs were shared among 3 of us.

Based on customer service from Nick, Steve, or Jen, the taste of the food we had with the ""to go option""  I definitely give ""The Bar"" 5 stars!

 I definitely recommend this location.  Enjoy!",kl_yCsj4ESbUphmpCfVvRA,26,23,5,-qfyTEzEIwlFJLhDU3M7QQ
