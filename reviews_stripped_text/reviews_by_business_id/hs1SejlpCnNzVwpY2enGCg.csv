I've been here 2x, one at morning one at night. The service during late night is ridiculously slow. It took forever to get out food. Though the waitress was nice. The service in the morning time was better, average.

I ordered the egg white omelet which wasn't very good. There wasn't much substance in the omelet. On the plus side, comes with a side of fruit.
The next morning I came for the skillet scramble. I specified to put extra veggies and add avocado. 

Awesome thing is that they really let you customize your order (with additional charge for certain things). Also, it is open 24 hours!",abxSMIvIeHY4Li2t00j5og,0,0,3,qlsJjqZdhh2xjManK1UTPQ

A small pho was pretty big! It was tasty. But if you want the extra condiments, like the hoisin, sriracha, and fish sauce you need to flag down a Asian server because the other servers wouldn't know what those condiments are. 

Overall if you happen to stay at the Palms and crave for some pho. Fortunes is the place to be.",CNKS9lCDbQVA2F-w3__XIQ,0,0,4,QFfU5SWnc1p3-EVkOGaoFw

The service was good. The gentleman that served us was Vietnamese as well so was able to give us good advice on what he recommends and doesn't.

Fish Ma Soup - Good ..A little bland but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't fix lol

Honey walnut shrimp - good size portion n tasty

Salt n pepper shrimp - I love it with extra extra garlic

Beef chow fun - good

Salted fish fried rice - good

Oxtail Hotpot - good

Whole steamed flounder - craving satisfied

Peking duck - made correctly unlike Coronado Cafe in South point

Prime rib - perfectly rare the way I like it",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,2,2,4,qRWbxALDBd5a8lghekJoBg
