Went there last week and gal gave me a dollar bill instead of a five I couldn't back up since a car was kissing my bumper so when I got to the second window I told that gal what happen and the manager wasn't any help either.  He told me if I want to wait while he counts the drawer I was upset knowing the change and receipt was still in my hand and he made me feel I was lying. I told him it's just 4 bucks that I got shorted and that cashier will definitely be over in her drawer...

Gave them another chance tonight and to my surprise ordered sundaes but was told no ice cream then I ordered the big breakfast with hot cakes but was told it's not available. They should redo the menu boards and stop saying All Day Breakfast? It's just laziness they probably cleaned the ice cream machine earlier then they should have and said no ice cream and too lazy to make the breakfast. So sad. They menu should be available all the way until they close. What's funny this is not the first time they don't have breakfast & ice cream. So lame.

And even had the pleasure of getting the sugar tossed at me rather than handed it slid to me on the counter. This McDonald's has always been one of the worst.

This McDonald's was recently renovated. The new indoor play place is awesome. It's like a three level mini gym for kids complete with obstacles and a slide. There's even a toddler area with interactive musical instruments that are surprisingly loud. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has a great time playing here and it's a convenient option when the weather is less than perfect to enjoy an outdoor playground or one of the nice parks in the NW. I'm not sure how it compares to other fast food play places but it's the first I've seen of its kind.

The food? You're not supposed to eat that garbage. Didn't you see Super Size Me? I stopped eating it in the 90s when a Beanie Babie collecting-relative fed me countless Happy Meals because she needed the Teenie Beanie toys that were included at the time. Or was it the time I discovered an unidentifiable blue object in a chicken nugget at a Girl Scouts event and became a vegetarian? Ah, food memories. I did enjoy the white chocolate mocha that was recently discontinued and I have a weakness for the warm strawberries and cream pie.

I ordered Hotcakes, as I normally do. When they arrived, the Styrofoam plate was melted on the outside and the pancakes were melted into the plastic. I am not a scientist but I know cooking food on Styrofoam is extremely unhealthy. 

I was in disbelief, so I ordered another Hotcakes and watched to see how they were cooked. 
What I saw made me sick, They would just plop 3 pancakes on the Styrofoam and them microwave the hotcakes right on the Styrofoam plate. Melting the Hotcakes into the plate.

I am still amazed by this. I wonder if this is McDonald's protocol, or the employee just being lazy. Anyways Eating McDonald's may be more carcinogenic than it appears ( which is bad)

Not unless you are one of my coworkers that see me at work every morning eating my Sausage McMuffin and have witnessed my slimmer physique. 

Well, it's true. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day and I found that skipping breakfast is not a good idea if you're trying to lose weight/get fit. Even though its not the most wholesome breakfast option, this is the quickest, cheapest way for me to get my morning meal.

I am not writing anything about McDonald's that you might already know. I'm writing about this particular location. They are always super fast and efficient at the drive thru and every employee I've encountered over the past few years here are very friendly. I come here so often that I should just write a review and give kudos to the Mon-Fri morning crew for always getting my order out fast, quick and in a hurry before heading to work. Even when the drive thru lane is packed, they move it pretty quickly so I've never found myself sitting in my car for more than a few minutes.

So just in case you're wondering what I order every morning here it is: a sausage Egg White Delight and a medium sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I automatically throw away one piece of the muffin to save on carbs. I know it sounds crazy but it works. For me, a carb conscious way of life works best.

I don't usually like supporting this trash food chain, but I was tired and thought this would be quick and painless( I was wrong).

The man asked me to give my order again, and I repeated the order. Now this wouldn't be that bad alone, but he didn't say anything after the order, it just showed the total on the screen.

Now I'm sitting in my car and I see that there are a few cars ahead of me, but nothing substantial.

4014549,2013-04-29,3,5uvX6yqie9DpHR7UAiQZtw,"Yes, I often indulge myself with the fine cuisine that is found at my local McDonald's.  OK, OK really I try not to go there that often unless it's the only thing to eat or I'm hankerin' for a damn McNugget (which by the way I still HAVE NOT found which part on the chicken the nugget is on).  Addictive with Hot Mustard.

I went here exclusively this day because of the current coupons that came in the mail.  There were a bunch of decent ones, particularly the ones that are promoting you try the new McCrap...oi...I mean McWrap.  This is almost as catchy as that 'Fishay, Fishay' song from the previous McDonald's food campaign for Fish McBites over the Easter season.  I swear if I see a wall of fish singing this tune to me at any location I will make like Grizzly Adams and run for the hills.  

I took my McWrap coupon and waltz into my closest McDonald's.  The visit's coupon was for a free McWrap of my choice with the purchase of any menu item (including the $1 Value Menu).  I got me a $1 Sweet Tea (1/2 & 1/2 to avoid extra sugar) to go with my McWrap.  I chose the Chicken & Bacon McWrap, grilled.  Oi, why McDonald's thought this thing could compete with a $5 footlong from Subway I don't know.

My Chicken & Bacon McWrap was really MEH.  The chicken was ok but was on the cold side, and my bacon?  Damn stuff is the same thing they put on your typical McDonald's breakfast fare.  Skinny and not much flavor.  The chicken was warm enough that it completely wilted the Spring Mix type lettuce in my McWrap.  Either that...or the Spring Mix was not cold to begin with!  I hate that.  Overly soggy lettuce.  Bleech.  The tomatoes that came in my McWrap were warm as well.  Not to mention, I have a feeling my McWrap was made prior to my ordering because the tortilla it came in was showing signs of sogginess too.  Not made fresh me thinks!  These guys and their speed over quality sometimes.

Taste?  I rather have a wrap somewhere else and pay a bit more.  The flavors just weren't that great to justify a regular price of $4 per McWrap.  If I didn't have this coupon I wouldn't have bothered trying it.  The best part about the McWrap was the damn box it came in!  It was cool & hip, and I felt like I was unwrapping a present when I tore through that seal.  But other than that, nothing.  I would have much rather used the coupon for a free Happy Meal with purchase.  I love those things!  But only when they come in the actual Happy Meal box with the Golden Arches handles, not in a friggin' paper bag.  Grrrrr....I hate it when my Happy Meal comes in a regular bag.  Makes me NOT happy.

Anyway, this trip to McDonald's was a bit of a bust.  Was hoping to give them a chance with this new fandangled McCrap...darn it there I go again...McWrap, but it just didn't impress me.  If they were made upon ordering and with much fresher ingredients, and not sitting by a heat lamp then maybe it would have been a better experience.  Maybe I should hit up another McDonald's and give this thing another shot.  Well, at least I had a coupon for buy one Dipped Cone, get one free!  I double fisted that sucker all the way home!  Ok, I actually shared for once.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,rSxDoBXXJXlbVzglMg9dyQ

I come here with my daughter so she can play in their play area.  She is 18 months and loves all of the climbing this McDs has.  This play area is always nice and clean as well.  In fact when we are there, someone is always cleaning it or just finishing up cleaning the area.  They even go through the tunnels and all.  It is a nice place, especially on those blistering summer days when it is too hot to go to the park.

My only complaint would be that they hide the sweet tea behind the counter.  I am a sweet tea addicted and it is a little annoying to have to go up to the counter to get a refill, especially when you have to wait in line with everyone ordering.

Keep up the good work.,ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,1,1,4,mJRx_BhZMJzhKlGANzopLg

When the sign states free refills for dine in only. Yes we did eat our lunch there.",RvtuiAk1JQviUDgr2Gq6AQ,2,0,1,OHapNQ2EwaAJvGmroygfug

5391216,2018-02-24,1,5uvX6yqie9DpHR7UAiQZtw,Just wanted a soda and fries to hold memover. At least 15 cars in drive thru. Parked and went inside. Cash registers down and it was bedlom. The employees were writing down orders on torn off cardboard and using smartphones to calculate the totals. It was complete pandomonium. Here is the best part... my bill was $4.99. I handed them a $10 bill and they had to use a calculator to determine my change. These are the degenerates that Bernie Sanders wants to give $15/hr and free college.,B7ygjO6fbs5IhW2ykL_MQQ,1,0,1,iIclsj2AakxW7H_wsBRi9A

It was 12:30am  and we went to the one on ann and Drexel first and they weren't accepting debit cards so we go a mile over to craig and tenaya they not only upcharged us 3 bucks for extra tartar sauce and pickle they tried  to charge full price until we mentioned the 2 for 5 deal, they then had the  nerve to make us wait for cold fish with one or 2 pickles and no extra tartar for us to call and complain wanting us to drive back after their screw up. Too bad I love your iced mochas and breakfast,  but after that kind of service I'll pass. You frankly deserve negative stars after that crappy of service. P.d that's the 2nd time your ann location declined bank cards.",gke3DjvrN-RdZgKtbJtz2w,1,0,1,C6Vkb1XZg04VylZ8VQC34w
