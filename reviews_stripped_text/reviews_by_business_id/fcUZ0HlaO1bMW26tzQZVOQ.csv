This is the exact reason why your business is declining.  People don't want breakfast only until 10 am.  Some want breakfast after 10 am.  Your business plan is failing and your market share is declining due to this business strategy.  More and more people will not utilize your services if you do not adapt to what your customers want.  They will go to your competition.,LFi6z5GgAi_xveOFwiNjLQ,1,0,1,IAfnvGELigiSYaqb7PQYMg

So when I want legit mcdeez I drive to blue diamond/valley view. I like that they have two drive thru speakers to order from. Because the one in southern highlands gets so backed up. When my husband drove to the southern highlands location he was like. Damn it's crowded and I said why did u even come here go to the one on blue diamond. He said he won't be going to southern highlands again. Especially after he tasted how much fresher their food is. The blue diamond and valley view one good service and good food.

Try to get breakfast at 10:31am on a Sunday. Good luck. 

They will not give you your drink cup while you are waiting. They tell you it will come out with the order. 

Service staff ignore customers at the counter. One disgruntled family was so frustrated on their order not getting delivered that they wanted a refund. The cashier ignored them which infuriated them more. When the cashier finally acknowledged them it got worse. They had two receipts (around $27 worth of food) and the cashier kept trying to total them both to give them their money back and she could not get the right number which upset the guest more. Advice to the cashier: Refund one receipt at a time. (No Math Involved)

This is a beautiful McDonalds but the staff is NOT FRIENDLY, POLITE or COURTEOUS. How about the friendly greeting that other McDonalds do and a wave or Thank You when you leave. Recommend that you dismantle this team and start from scratch because they obviously were never taught or forgot the core values of McDonalds corporation.",kK_mVKKMMUo4Rv9MCPTLMw,2,0,1,1lVhZ8sgznDganfEDf-MfA
1035272,2017-10-04,0,fcUZ0HlaO1bMW26tzQZVOQ,I've never had a problem with the McDonald's franchise. I love the food and don't mind the wait for the drive-thru. However most drive-thrus have two lanes. Every single time I come to this drive-through I feel like I get into one lane and literally another car will come after me into the other lane and their order will be taken first. I know it's such a simple thing and it's not something to take personally but I feel like this happens every single time I come to this McDonald's in particular and it's not right. If it wasn't for the convenient location to my house I wouldn't even come here in the first place. And the only reason why I'm writing this review now is because I literally just went through and not one but two cars got the order taken before I did when I was waiting at the box. Customer service is still customer service and I should be treated like a customer not like a check.,LCRV2cF0bcD-_bOwC-Qtdg,0,0,2,IQz2-2JbXC0ZdLsi8d_m1A

I understand that it's the morning and that it's busy but they should really I have the person on drive-through be able to be a good listener. Every time I spoke she spoke over me and then she wanted me to repeat what my order was because she didn't understand what I was saying.  But if she just quit talking over me she would understand.   I even had to tell her can you please let me speak and she sat there and argued with me about how she was letting me speak and she kept talking and talking so this took a lot longer than it needed to be.  It seems like she has a about 3-5 cups of coffee already if not maybe something else.

I'll make it brief.. ordered food, 20 minutes later, still no food. Hungry, want to get on the road asap. Decided instead of arguing for food to get refund and head across the street to In N Out. (Should of been first choice, shot my own foot!) *sigh*

Not exactly sure who is at fault here, whether management or employee.

  Apparently this female employee did not have the competence to add up my order and refund my money.. maybe if she was a teenager, that would of been excusable.
  As she was pushing buttons on the monitor and looking back and forth at my receipt, she started twitching and looked liked the monitor was a ticking time bomb from how fast she was going trying to disable it from blowing her into smithereens. After a few unfortunate attempts and still unable to add up the order to the equivalent price for refund, she jumped, panicked, starting speaking gibberish and then turned around and left to the back of the kitchen.

Extremely disrespectful leaving us there and would say unprofessional of her but then again, not sure if her (just assuming) G.E.D or high school diploma even covered that term. Which then points to management and the kind of training they provide to their employees.
Poor lady, sure do feel sorry for her. Supervisor gave me my refund, ate a delicious burger from In N Out, drove back to California.

Customer Service = ZERO stars.

4913394,2018-07-01,0,fcUZ0HlaO1bMW26tzQZVOQ,"I always thought it odd when people would rate a McDonald's.  I mean, let's face it, it's McDonald's.  But here I am writing a review about this one.  I went in for breakfast yesterday.  I saw that they had the new ordering kiosks.  I've always wanted to try one since it would be less likely that my order would get screwed up and I like poking those Fight For 15 folks in the eye.  So I go through the process of placing my order when the last page pops up.  About 0.75 seconds into the time I'm trying to read it an arm pops into view and hits the End or Finish button (or whatever it was).  It was the manager trying to be ""helpful.""  He then spews out some gibberish quickly saying, what I assume, should happen next.  Well I tell him in no uncertain terms that I wasn't finished reading the last page, I didn't need his help, he spoke too quickly to be understood and that the kiosks are there so I don't have to interact with the counter folks.  He sputtered an apology and scooted off to bother other customers.  I got my food.  As usual the McDonald's coffee was far superior to that swill served at Starbucks. The food was the usual McDonald's fare.  

The other reason, other than the really annoying manager, that this store gets one star is that it's a haven for dirty homeless bums.   I didn't feel safe.",8YaFdh5fGg-M6KPIHv7ivw,0,0,1,LCrItyEINwHKj-GhgiID3g

5197747,2016-05-11,0,fcUZ0HlaO1bMW26tzQZVOQ,"Let me start by warning all customers about the employees prior to visiting this location. I came to this location one night for dinner with my family. Yes I had a big order but EVERYTHING on my order was wrong. When I came back to get everything fixed the Manager ALEX was very rude and extremely unprofessional! He has no interest in fixing my order all he did was argue with me about why it was wrong. When speaking to Alex, a young boy interrupted me and said ""Actually I made your order"". Even though I had all the food brought back, and the receipt to show they messed up on my order QUEN the employee there argued and blamed the other employee who was training for why my food was wrong. QUEN even was even more unprofessional and rude then ALEX the manager was. Alex, who left to the back claiming he wasn't here when we made the order so he has nothing to do with it walked to the back when QUEN still stood there arguing with us. It took for the very nice and sweet assistant manager RYCHELLE to come out and apologize for both of their actions for me to get my 
Order replaced. I will never visit this location again just based off of this one experience. I would advise everyone to do the same!! The store manager and district manager should also be aware of the kind of employees they have working in their store! QUEN even took it so far to tell RYCHELLE she needs to hurry up with replacing the food so I can leave because he was about to ""Spazz"". What kind of customer service is that?

5220818,2017-05-15,0,fcUZ0HlaO1bMW26tzQZVOQ,"Don't ever come here late at night (10pm and later) because there's most likely one to two people running the drive thru. It takes a while to order and pay, and on top of that they always mess up on orders. I came here three nights in a row with some friends and it took a long time to order and the lady at the second window messed up on all three days we came. It was the same lady so I'm assuming it's just her being under pressure when they're slammed. The first night she forgot our sauces for the chicken nugget meal, the second night she forgot our drinks and fries, and the third night she forgot our sandwiches. They do not have great customer service here so don't expect to hear a ""thank you"" or ""have a nice night."" Not blaming her just the management for staffing so little people. Staffing a good set of people at night other than just one or two, the higher the accuracy of the customer's order + great customer service = more customers coming through = more money for the business. Probably recommend coming here during day time hours instead of late night... for now I'll just find another drunk food spot for myself.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,2,0,1,48UKWHmDZA9wI1DWn1j2LQ

**Update 5-17-17 
I heard that the menu had some new changes and decided to give this location another chance at the drive thru,  The Service was great! In fact is was awesome! But when we got home ( a mile away) the two Big Mac's were were old and very cold :( 
The nuggets and frys were good but the burgers was a too cold to eat. 

***UPDATE***  9-19-17
I was on my way to a appointment and like a fool stopped in again (during the lunch rush) only to open and find that the quarter pounder was so old that it was hard! AND had a fresh cold piece of cheese on it! So that tells me that someone seen how old it was and slapped a piece of cheese on it and sold it anyway!! 
And you want $15 a hour to do this???
