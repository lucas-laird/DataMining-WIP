As soon as you walk in there is a small sign that states ""seat yourself"", after reading it the bartender shouted that we needed to seat ourselves. Not once upon entering were we greeted by any employee. I believe a manager took our drink order and I asked him about the mango lemonade, he told me because it was flavored I would not be allowed any refills so I just stuck with the regular lemonade but as i told him that he replied with ""ohhhh come on"". I believe smart remarks are not necessary.  Since today is veterans day all Vets get a free meal upon showing a military ID, my boyfriend showed his and for whatever reason the manager taking our drinks did not believe his military ID was real? He then rudely asked for a drivers license because he needed to be sure that he didn't barrow the military ID from a ""buddy"". The picture on the military ID clearly verifies that it is him. I found that very disrespectful. Although he was doing his job he could have asked in a different manner. There has never been an instance where he has been asked for both IDs to verify that he is in fact in the military.  The waitress that took our wing order was nice but seemed very confused with what she was doing. The wings came out within ten minutes and they tasted okay, however I did not enjoy the cajun wings. As I said before i was expecting so much more from this location. I'll just stick to BWW or Wing stop.",88rERpQ4YG9knIndBzoxbQ,3,0,2,lNThk3xc2g3wfZJp231-2A

I've been to 100's across the country over the last 23 yrs and I'm sad to say this hooters takes the crown as the worse hooters in the United States ! Entering the restaurant we did not receive the ever so annoying ""WELCOME TO HOOTERS"" shout from all the girls !! So my friend and I made our way over to the bar area , I picked the seats closest to the well station cause there was literally 4 waitresses 1 bartender and 1 manager in that area so I figured I would get great service !! Sat there for 5 minutes literally an arm length away from these 6 employees and not one of them greeted us or took a drink order ! They all just sat there shooting the shit ! My friend and I decided to leave these seats since we weren't being served anyways and we walked 15 feet into the gaming area hoping service mite be better on this side ! We were quickly greeted and served drinks ! As I sat there I looked around this place and I reminisced of all the locations I've visited over the yrs , my wings came out quickly 10 breaded seasoned HOT , they were large wings but literally tasted like they were marinated in Tabasco sauce !!! Disgusting ! I drank my bees and watched the employees interactions and I was absolutely shocked !! This place is obviously a locals hangout !! The conversations between the employees and customers highly inappropriate !! The female employees and male employees poor boundaries !! I've got to say the place wasn't busy but they had lots of girls working !!! Well I take that back , they were hanging out more than working !! Advice to management I do believe it's against health code for an employee in uniform to be eating wings or any food behind the bar and then take an order !! Jesus she didn't even was her hands after licking the wing sauce from her fingers !!!! And this is the first time I've ever seen a bartender take a shot of liquor behind the bar while working !!! And now I have no clue what the law is on this but I'm just gonna take a wild guess that even if it's not a law it's probably against some policy for the bartender to take a food and beverage order and while waiting to go around the other side of the bar and put money in the gaming machine and gamble !!!!! And WIN !!! Running back around the bar to the cash register and cash out her $20 ticket !!! I was shocked when I saw the employees actions but then it all made sense when I saw the managers who looked like they were in their early 20's playing grab ass with the girls !!!! I made a promise to myself never to come back to this hooters , so unprofessional ,no hooter spirit , the whole time there never once heard welcome to hooters !!!! Place sucks it's dirty , bartenders drinking and gambling , waitresses sitting around eating wings behind the bar licking finger!!! Please go to a break room so nasty ! And managers who look like high school kids playing grab ass with the girls !!!!! This place is an unprofessional messy epic fail !!!

We love chicken wings and Hooters atmosphere, but have been pretty disappointed since the Spring Valley location opened. Service was terrible and wings just okay.

BUT ALL THAT HAS CHANGED! Not sure if they have new management in, but the service has really stepped up, the wings are always hot and arrive quickly, and the waitresses are not just pretty faces anymore....they actually know how to serve and provide a smiling face to customers.

Go see Holly! She just relocated from the Hooters Casino and was fun, sassy, spunky, quick with our drinks and our food and a pleasure to be around. 

Wanna try something new? Order wings tossed in 911 first, then coated in lemon pepper. Yummy. Best ordered naked to get all the flavor out of it. Sooooo goood.",YPMamd8-MFTV3ExZoS5dtA,0,0,5,sava0R01wAQZ0p2HxsDfxw

The funny part: she was only working about 5 tables. The manager was in-house, but never realized what was going on. All table's around us had the same issues.

The only downside was the other waitresses sitting at the table behind us with either a gentleman manager or shift leader talking about their nights out.  Definitely not what I wanted my son to hear.  I turned around at least 3 times before the gentleman apologized and they moved to the side station to continue their chatter.

I guess it was alright. I was more excited about their free wi-fi than anything .. oh and my blackened mahi sandwich. We also ordered the fried pickles, only because the menu had a warning saying it would be addicting. Really, it wasn't. It was lightly battered and served with thousand island which made it more sour. Probably would've been better with ranch? Maybe, but def not with the thousand island. Like I said the mahi was good--it was moist and very decent in size and was only 9 bucks. My bf got the big dog combo with a side of curly fries. I must say, these curly fries were ""naked."" I'm used to eating seasoned curly fries so I wasn't a fan of these. The cheese sauce we dipped it in was also real salty. As far as the hot dog goes, the guy said ""everything is real salty"" but the portion was pretty big. The prices are reasonable as well, we only paid 24 bucks including tip.

As usual, the food is not bad and no matter which Hooters I went to and I have been to many different states and different countries to eat at Hooters, the food is predictably the same.  However, today was the nadir of my history of eating at Hooters.  

Today there was a preseason NFL game on and the volume of the televisions was so loud my ears were ringing because of the high volume.  I could not hear my son speak.  I could not hear the waitress speak.  It was horrible.  The manager came over and told me he could ""dim"" the sound but he had to keep the volume up.  I said why, it was uncomfortably loud.   He said I should have not choose to sit under the speaker on the wall near the ceiling.  I said I choose to leave.  He graciously gave me my food order without charging me after I changed my order to go.  

Regardless, if you want to lose your hearing or walk around with your ears buzzing even after you leave the building, this is not a bad place.  For those that are deaf, you should enjoy.  For those that want to preserve their hearing,  I would totally avoid this location.

She was very nice and wasn't impatient with us even though it was busy. We confused her with another girl and she joked about how lots of people ask if they are siblings. 

Our food was great. We got Daytona wings, fried pickles and curly fries. Everything was hot and crispy. It's hooters. You can't be mad about cold beer, hot wings and a good fight.

The garage door leading out to the patio was open, as the weather's been nice lately. I observed several people smoking at the bar, (maybe 4 yards from our table) as well as behind us on the patio. Me, being a smoker, I asked our server, Jasmine, if I was allowed to smoke in the area we were seated. She told me she would ask a manager just to be sure and said she would bring me an ashtray if smoking was permitted. She promptly returned with the ashtray for me, and before I could even fully light my cigarette, I was approached by a man who told me I was not allowed to smoke. I said, ""I just asked my server and she said she would check with a manager and they said it was fine."" His response is the reason for my review and 2 star rating. In a condescending tone he replied, ""Well, I'm one of the managers, so..."" and walked off. Being a manager in retail, I found his response unprofessional, and ultimately rude. I moved outside to avoid conflict. My boyfriend had just gotten back from the bathroom after the incident occurred and naturally, I told him how I was approached and spoken to by the manager. It's not like I put up my dukes to sock it out with the guy over a cigarette, but the tone he used just rubbed me the wrong way.

AMBIANCE:
Wasn't crowded and the bar was practically empty. I noticed two cooks in the kitchen. Pretty quiet on a Thursday night if you ask me.

FOOD:
We decided to completely pigout and ordered 50pcs of wings half breaded and half naked, and mozzarella sticks. Cheesecake for desert. I also had their vodka and lemonade as well.
The wings($34.95) were pretty solid. Tasted really good and were spicy enough for me to handle. My boyfriend and I couldn't defeat all those wings though had to take some home instead.
The mozzarella sticks($6.95) were disappointing. I believe they were still cold on the inside because when I took a bite there wasn't any yummy gooey cheese stretching itself out! Boooo! But still tasty.
The Vodka lemonade was strong and not watered down which was good!
The cheesecake($3.99/slice) was surprisingly good! The caramel and nuts that came with it made it even better.

SERVICE:
Service was 50/50, there were two girls. The first girl who I believe her name was Chantel was friendly, smiling and attentive.

I usually attend the Hooters at the Tropicana hotel or at Sunset Station casino but I was leaving church off the strip and ready to catch the NFL season openers of football.

A few friends and I decided to go to this Hooters location for some food and football. As soon as we arrived and walked into the resturaunt the host advised that Directv was down all over Vegas and they're only showing local tv games. Huge upset for NFL fanatics such as ourselves. Since we made the drive thus far we decided to stay. The waitress was very friendly and funny. Grabbed our drink orders as soon as we sat down and quickly brought them out but then again we were the only 4 customers.

Food was ok. I ordered steak nachos and was expecting carne asada or actual steak on my nachos but that's what I get for assuming. The portion of nachos was great. Huge plate, mounted with nachos. My nachos were kinda good but mostly upsetting. The steak was like steak umms (TM) sandwich meat, the cheese was obviously from a can and was just heated up instead of being shredded or fresh cheese, and there was more jalapenos than steak, chips, and cheese. My friends had steak quesadillas that were delicious and I wish I would've ordered those instead.

Overall the location is kinda in the middle of nowhere and the food isn't all that its hyped up to be. And the fact the host told us that Directv was down all over Vegas, even casinos, and nobody was able to watch the games was a complete lie.

We ordered -Build your own burger-    Choose the bread, meat, cheese, Veggies and then it says extra toppings are such and such price.   We also ordered flavored Iced tea.   

The bill came and there were charges for cheese on the bill and charges for the syrup in the flavored lemonade.   The menu doesnt say nor did the waitress note that the flavored part of the drink would be an extra $2 nor did she mention that the burger doesnt come with cheese, its extra! 

She showed us on the menu in the teeniest print where it says, extra cheese $1.99...Yes, but we didnt order extra cheese, just cheese.    Well thats extra we were told.   She left with the bill and did take the charges for the extra cheese off.    They need to change the menu and they need to warn the customers of extra charges, flavored iced tea $2.99 flavored-is extra cost, or something, not throw a surprise charge in there!

The girls did take a photo with me and my baby hooter owl when we left so that was a plus!
He got a mouthful...I mean he got comfortable, thats what I mean, Yes...   

All in all we would go back for the food.   :)",tbivfqTrnwTp7mSKSz1j0g,1,0,3,6G8t-fIS_d775IbSsP1Mjw

I have to say that I was very surprised, their food hit the spot, I called in an order for fried pickles, lot-a-tots, boneless wings w/ fries and 10 Wings TO GO. What really made this experience awesome was the hostess, she was awesome in helpiing order like having all the stuff for the tots on the side so they did not get soggy and also ordering the pickles extra crispy so they were also not soggy.

1947527,2011-01-28,0,FfG8twx5K18y268Gp4dSKA,"Thursday is amateur open mic comedy night. Not sure if this is a new promotion or they've been doing it for a while but that was the thing that made my group of buddies want to go.

The comedy is open mic and preformed by amateur locals. The host is a drag queen who is just hilarious and isnt afraid to offend or pick on some of the average joes attending. 

The rest of the local comedians can range from 'please pass the mic' to 'omg did he just say that?' Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the easily offended. 

Starts at 10 ends at 12

The food was a bit disappointing. We all split an order of 50 wings in Spicy Garlic and Mild flavors. After about 45 minutes the host announced the comedy night special which offered 10 wings for 5 dollars any flavor. Kinda pissed our bartender didnt mention that nor did she mention any of the drink specials. We all could have saved some cash ordering less and been a lot happier with flavors we individually wanted.

The Spicy Garlic was neither spicy nor was it very garlicy it did have a pleasing flavor but nothing you would lable 'spicy' or 'garlic'

The mild didnt have sauce of any kind, Bartender explained that it's just deep fried wings tossed in butter. She offered to take it back to the kitchen to throw some medium sauce on it so we let her, when they came back semi tossed in sauce nostrils flared from the hot sauce/vinegar fumes. The bark was obviously worse then the bite. The medium had no bite. The sauce was so mild i didnt think it was any improvement from mild at all. 

In the future if i were to come back and order wings i'd request them to be naked and unbreaded. The breading is pretty thick and i cant remember tasting very much chicken at all.


Getting to the point. Hooters is the go to place for sports, beers, wings, and eyecandy in lots of other cities but in Las Vegas there's just so many other places that do the job better.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,2,eGPHk9KDA0K4nTMi9xNKMQ

I hardly write reviews- In fact I never do - but for this hooters I'll make an exception.

I am from the east coast- I enjoy hooters ironically enough I was at MGM next to the hooters casino - I live in Summerlin, and thought I would drive out to spring valley to an actual restaurant. 

I sat in the gaming area of the bar and it was dead needless to say it was 1130. Anyways - I go in sit down greeted by a nice BT I think her name was tosha or something with a t - she had blond hair- she greeted me I told her I was going to play and I ordered a beer. I noticed there were two guys in there along with myself - and a drunk guy that left pretty quickly - these two drunk guys were playing all the games and winning which was cool- and the bar tender seemed to be in it - the two guys that were winning were getting louder then they came over to my side of the bar - they were using every vulgarity you could use- but not in the half way bar acceptable use of the terms - they were using phrases and terms that you would hear on workaholics but 10x worse. Anything involving a woman - and her anatomy and what goes with that- purely disgusting. Mind you I came to eat. What really shocked me - he had a black hooters shirt on- he was a manager or something! Def FOH. I don't have a problem with drinking after work but he ruined my appetite and granted I put 200 in the machine I didn't get one comp for two beers and a chicken sandwich. Thirty bucks for all that after I played 200 worth of BJ- and listening to the manager talk to his drunk friend while his gf (the bar tender) was sticking money into the machine - GO TO TWIN PEAKS SO MUCH BETTER - hooters is great but this one sucked - and the bar tender should be embarassed of her boyfriend and manager and frankly herself- 

Understand I'm not a prude I drink like a fish and I swear like the catholic I am. However, that was by far the worse experience I have ever had- I have no sympathy that hooters  is losing to twin peaks. They should be",gRShVheCI18D3ufNzkjQLQ,3,0,1,iHR3sg4oCWygQaVjhjS18Q

I was there tonight around 2:00 am. (Monday the 25th.)

The bar tender who was on staff was to busy drinking, and on his ""break"" to get our drink order prepared. 
The one girl who was working had some attitude and didn't give us a heads up that the chef and bartender were on break so we waited for 90 minutes before getting our food order... We were the only table in the entire place. The drink order we had to cancel.  Once we finally got our order the chicken was overcooked and rubbery. 

Living so close to this specific hooters location and being a gambler if the food and service was even decent I would come back often.... Only gambling I'll be doing there is waiting to see how sick I get from the terrible cooked wings i just had. I don't often Yelp but this experience was terrible and I thought I would let everyone know to stay away... If you want wings go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Durango, If you want to gamble & drink go to one of the other hundreds of gaming bars in town. Trust me STAY AWAY. It's not worth it.

They seated me pretty fast, within about 2 minutes of arrival.   The waitress is nice and attentive.   Not sure of her name but I'll check it out next time she comes to give me another soda which she brings me a refill on before I'm even done with it.  
I mostly come to a place to eat for the food, the service doesn't matter to much to me unless it's really terrible.   But with this waitress today, it's quality.  The boneless wings are really subpar.   About 90% breading.  They are too crunchy and then the chicken is tough.  The garlic Parmesan sauce is very unappealing.   I can't really describe it other than not good and I don't recommend you order it.  I just got Buffalo Wild Wings a few days ago and their sauce and quality is about 7,000 times better.   The hot boneless wings are a little better but still not good.  
Overall, for the $8 it's gonna cost for the drink, free wings and a tip, it's certainly not worth it.  I honestly don't think I'd pay anything for this food.

I am a close neighborhood gaming/restaurant bartender and I recently moved areas but my best friend lives across the road of Hooters so I have recommended coming here since I live their special non-breaded wings but I ordered a Cadillac Margarita and tasted only sweet & sour. I didn't see her put the Gran Marnier so I asked how she made it. It's one of their signature cocktails and her answer was ""oh I don't know let me look for it"". Wow ok so I'm paying $10 for an incorrect drink. Sorry I'm a stickler on margaritas because my standards are high as a Vegas bartender. 

The second time I decided to give them another try because I love the graveyard bartender but I cannot come in during that time so we had lunch and the young girl server had 3 tables. Our 2 top, another 2 top, and 3 top. I've ran a full bar and 4 tables all by myself and she couldn't even serve us in a timely manner whatsoever. I saw a manager I've never seen before just running food and the girls dripped a ranch trail all over the floor, then she took 15 after she brought our water to ask if we wanted a DRINK. We got 2 specialty drinks which with 8 ppl at the gaming bar, I'm shocked it took her that long for those. She arrived & as she placed the drinks down she mumbled ""that was an ordeal"". Wow, so she put in our food order and then when she dropped the check it took her almost 20 min to come get the $, & she came by with mouth FULL OF FOOD which explains why it took her so long to pick up our $ and said ""I'll be right back with your change"". 

Seriously, finish your food before you touch a table. It's just unprofessional and unsanitary that I no longer want to eat or drink there. I'm very taken back how the service is there. I worked in that neighborhood for 3 years and I worked so hard to accommodate guests & it just frustrates me when I see people not respect their jobs or customers. With so many bars & restaurants opening, I would be very picky on who I hire and as a manager, touch the waitresses tables to ensure their guests are satisfied. It just seems like common sense.

My burger arrives, with fries, and an explanation of we are out of tots are fries ok?  Well, its kind of late now!  I was very pleasant with the server as she seemed genuinely concerned with the issue. 

I have a few fries, yuck. Worst fries ever.  So soggy they might have been cooked in luke warm oil. 

Still in an acceptable mood i pull the bun off my burger to add ketchup and mustard.  Imagine my surprise to find a lot of onions on my burger.

The server removed the burger from the check.  This is expected but the money is not the issue. 

If i order a meal i expect it to arrive as ordered.  Yes, the cook missed the instructions but it is the responsibility of the server to verify it is right before delivering it to the customer.  Also, if an item is unavailable the customer should be informed before any substitutions are made. In this case i would have changed my entire order had i known the tots were unavailable.

We love hooters and were very excited when we learned of the opening of this spring valley location.  Went soon after they opened and were very disappointed in everything.  Wrote to corporate, they sent gift cards.  The GM called us and apologized and invited us to come back in. We took him up on his offer and gave them another try.  When we got there we introduced ourselves to the GM and he made sure all was taken care of.  Everything was great!  Went back again another time, did not introduce ourselves and once again bad food and service.  
Every fathers day we go to hooters so we went to spring valley again to give them one more shot.  BIG MISTAKE!  They were not busy at all.  No one greeted us.  We picked out a table and sat down.

Food was not as bad as the previous times but no where near as good as the time the GM took care of us.

2711757,2014-06-08,0,FfG8twx5K18y268Gp4dSKA,"I've been a fan of Hooters since they first arrived in Las Vegas in the early 90s (late 80s?).  When they opened up this location near my house I couldn't be happier.

First the food. The food is typical hooters.  Really good, but there are places out there slightly better. But combine location, plus cost, plus atmosphere and you really can't do better. I like the wings, naked, all drums, grilled Daytona style with spicy garlic sauce. Also the burgers are really good . I sometimes even get the crab legs or the fried pickles. My only real complaint is the lack of ROASTED OYSTERS.  That's right, when Hooters first opened they had roasted oysters. They came in a large bucket, covered with a hot towel and they gave you an oyster shucker to open them. Hooters management said it was because of the oil spill that happened years ago in the south why they no longer had them.  I really hope they bring them back someday.

As for the staff, management is great.  There are a group of 3 familiar guys that run the place. They are always friendly and helpful.  They'll change the channels for you and even give you the wi-fi password.

As for the waitresses, I'd say 90% of them are at a Hooters level of customer service. When they acknowledge you as ""their table"" you are usually greeted somewhat cheerfully and they are for the most part friendly.  Some fo them even go into their pro acting job and ask you about your day or what you do, etc. We know it's a service industry and that's part of the act, but it is a nice touch. I would say about 5% of the girls go above and beyond. They remember you from the last time you came and they even come and say hi to you even if you are ""not their table"".  It's nice to be acknowledged as a regular.  Sadly most of the time it's by the male management, but like I said, a couple girls remember and say hi regardless.  Sadly the remaining 5% of the girls are horrible. There are only one (maybe two) that I fear getting when I walk in.  I hate that feeling ""well now I got to run the gauntlet today for lunch cuz this girl sucks"". I'm not the type of person to complain about service, especially if I'm a regular. instead I suffer silently.  The girl in question is so bad. She rushes you though the ordering process. She never writes anything down. As you can see from above, I have a complex order, so it's always a gamble if I'll get it right. God forbid it's wrong, I have to decide if it's worth flagging her down, telling she is wrong and getting a new order.

The saying ""a bad apple ruins the bucnh"" is true.  That one ore two employees prevented me from giving a 5 star review.  I hope in the future these employees move on.  I hate playing the gambler when I come in to my local Hooters, ""will I get a good waitress?"" Maybe management can have more customer service training more often.  I've also wrote a review about a Japanese Hooters, explaining how they had the best costumer service I've ever seen.  Maybe the Hooters here can fly a few of those Japanese Hooters girls in and have them train the locals? Japanese girls are HIGH ENERGY, some of the waitresses here would benefit from a little energy boost.

Anyhow, this is a great Hooters, good food, pretty girls, great atmosphere. I'm a fan.

TIP: this place is ridiculous on big sporting event nights, especially UFC fights. I usually go only at lunch time, but I've made the mistake going on a UFC night.  I'm not a UFC fan so I had no clue what was going on.  So if going at night, you might want a backup plan if you drive by and see the parking lot overflowing and people pouring out of the building.",gij38wU44AZtOq8AXSeKaQ,0,0,4,nJM0Nby1JeXcpVIA5PLGIw

The entire time we were there he tended to the folks at the bar and then left the bar to take care of us even if he could've asked a waitress to tend to us.

When we were seated, the menus looked like they were put through a storm and were gross and sticky.... It took forever for our waitress to come over and take our drink order, so long that we had already figured out what we wanted to eat AND what we wanted to eat as an appetizer ... 

We got our appetizer, Buffalo Chicken Dip which was EXCELLENT and I highly recommend it. We needed a refill on drinks and and finished the appetizer before she even came back to check on us. Our waitress, Arielle, didn't even come back and make sure everything came out okay and see if we needed anything else.  

The next time we saw our waitress, she was brining us our food.  She finally got us refills and checked to see if the food came out okay, and then she disappeared again.  The food was excellent and cooked to perfection, hence the 2 stars. She came back soon after to let us know she was leaving and someone else would take over and then ran off before we could tip her, which honestly wouldn't be much since she obviously didn't care about us or the tip. The next waitress was better, but still didn't care to make sure we were taken care of, when we were one of two groups in the ENTIRE place... 

All the other Hooter's I have ever been to , the girls are ALWAYS attentive, bring refills before you are done with your first round, they talk to you and check on you and make you feel welcome, even when its a crowded fight night. THIS Hooters made you feel like you weren't welcome and that we would have been treated better at McDonalds.... 

I used the bathroom before we left and boy I should have used a truck stop bathroom.... Every time I went to get toilet paper, the ENTIRE toilet paper holder would FALL on me........ How did it fall on me since it's against the wall you ask??? The entire front part would fall open and its heavy and hurt terribly and since the stall is extremely small, you can't avoid getting hit....

We sat in the bar area on a cocktail table & we were not greeted for a while... so we went up to the front host stand area & then they finally got some menus to us & got us started. 

I think LILLY was our server. She was super sweet & very attentive. I can be very needy as the bois have already mentioned to her... but she was able to get me everything I needed. I would have to say the drinks always took the longest though... I wasn't paying too much attention around me because the game was on... so couldn't determine if it was because of the bartender or if it was the server...

Food is just bar food here... but I ALWAYS love to get my steamed shrimps from here!

CURLY FRIES $2.99 - they were a bit under cooked & cold 

20 PIECE WINGS $20.99 - we got half naked & half battered. The wings were cooked to perfection & I would expect nothing less of a place that is known for their wings. Although... we did get the sauces on the side.. it was said that the garlic hot sauce was the 2nd hottest sauce but it seemed like the same level of spice as the original hot sauce. 

BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD $10.99 - greens w/ onions, bleu cheese, Bacon, tomato, & ranch dressing. I would have to say it is very LITTLE amount of chicken on there... a bit disappointing & barely any Bacon.

1/2 LB. STEAMED SHRIMP $14.59 - never disappoints & cooked to the PERFECT juicy texture.

ONION RINGS $7.29 - ummm definitely not worth the price... but it was good.

CARAMEL FUDGE CHEESECAKE $5.49 - wouldnt ever get a dessert here again... ahahhhah not really worth the price but it wasn't that bad in taste.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,5,5,3,YB4iWi4eCTLMixj0jRhUxQ

The Daytona wings I ordered at 12pm showed up at 12:50. I could understand if the kitchen was backed up but there were only 3 people there. The server completely forgot about our food so when it arrived the fries were cold and the wings were incredibly soggy. The response I was given was ""well that is how they always are."" Really? At least apologize for the mistake. Nothing was even taken off our bill even though I sent them back! The last time I dined here (hoping they just had a (bad day) was even WORSE service. The girl behind the bar was wearing a black shirt and jeans because she said she was a supervisor. I was there with one of my girlfriends and we were completely ignored.

Once our food was eaten and we were ready for our bill, we asked politely and got it instantly. Unfortunately, it took another 15mins for her to run the card! Complete and utter disrespect.

Apparently you are some sort of zoo animal if you aren't familiar with the inner workings of their menu.  

We ordered wings and nachos.  The girl asked us if we wanted the wings breaded or not....ummmm, I don't remember there being choices.  I just remember thinking hooters had pretty decent wings.  Now what?!? We asked the server her opinion...she said, ""I thought you said you had been here before.""  Then, she recommended the naked/unbreaded variety.  We decided to wise up and try both.  We ordered them medium and she warned us that their medium was very mild, so we ordered them hot.  

Oh my! That was difficult.  

Well, we concluded that the breaded version is far superior to the naked version and the ""hot"" is indeed not spicy so I'm sure the medium is ultra mild.  Whoa! Did you follow all that? Should wings be this complicated?  Their wings are almost covered in a buttery sauce....very different than other buffalo wings.  They were A-OK but not one of my top picks for wings.  The nachos were MEH.  

This location is nice because they have a big indoor/outdoor patio.  We ended up spending around $30 for 2 sodas, wings and nachos.  A bit steep.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,1,1,3,ER8XHNpiUEf7IjdhE5FYsg

Our first round of beer was served in 16 oz plastic cups. For some reason, after this our waitress brought our next round in 12 oz plastic cups. We were ready to have a good time that night and so we requested our drinks be brought in the larger pint size. She shrugged and said she couldn't do that, the smaller plastic cups were all she had. I was okay with that, until I saw her bring the table next to us some beers in 16 oz pint glasses (not plastic!). We then requested the same glass as they had, but she then told us her manager wouldn't let her use glass because they had to wash them - it's a restaurant and bar, OF COURSE there will be dishes to wash! 

After this, we ordered several more rounds, all brought in 12 oz plastic cups while I watched her bring 16 oz glasses to several tables around us. I honestly have no idea why this occurred, but it made me pretty annoyed. 

The food was okay - very fried and greasy but exactly what I would expect from a Hooters.

When the bill came, we were charged a full pint on every 12 oz drink we had (I know, because it clearly said ""PINT - STELLA"" and whatnot on each line of the receipt). We brought this up to the waitress, who acknowledged they weren't pints, shrugged, and said she couldn't do anything about it and we had to pay full price for each drink. This was one of the only times in my life I have left a tip under 15%, but I couldn't reward that woman's dismissive and rude behavior.",8wLaRjY32WtXRoJi6_wBWQ,1,0,1,7oDl9uaC54quzD6fVE3siw

The hostess was quick to greet us, and allowed us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we grabbed a table near the bar. 

Once we looked over the menus we realized that splitting appetizers wasn't going to work, so we ordered a thing of fried pickles to share and picked out some drinks. Two people in my group ordered beers, myself and the other person with us went with the strawberry lemonade. Little did we know that this comes with or without vodka, and both drinks have the same name... So when large plastic cups of strawberry lemonade without vodka came out we were confused. Thankfully our waitress was quick to offer us new drinks and she let us sip on the virgin versions while we waited. 

I decided to order the 10 piece boneless wings, medium heat (which was a mistake looking back, medium means none apparently). I didn't like that carrots, celery, even fries were an additional charge so I didn't bother with anything other then the wings. 

I don't need an attractive waitress wearing short shorts to bring me my food in order for me to enjoy it. I just need the food to be good. And it was decent... Nothing to write home about. I think I would have enjoyed my meal a lot more if I had gotten hot wings instead... 

That said, I know some people DO go to Hooters for the eyecandy. Our waitress was attractive, and friendly...  she was just a little slow. Not sure if that was her fault, or the result of a slow bartender/kitchen staff.

I was actually willing to pay the absurd cover just because I wanted to watch the event that bad and tried to solution find with the manager on duty saying you can charge my card directly 20 on my bill as I was planning to order food anyway and to my dismay, they literally refused me. The actual manager on duty literally asked me to drive away to my bank to pull $20 cash out and come back. I was floored.

There are much better places for sports so I haven't been back since then until yesterday. I thought ""no cover today, cross your fingers and hope for a better time"" and I was let down again. The server last night was nice... when she was around. Which, was nearly never. I had to physically get up out of my seat to track her (or anyone down) as we had not been checked up on to find 4 hooters girls having a pow wow by the kitchen not attending anyone. Me (being me) tried to watch activity patterns after that and noticed we weren't the only ones affected by it. No one was being attended. And that same pony tailed manager was on duty who refused my card for the UFC fight and didn't seem to notice or care what his staff was (or literally was not) doing. I think this location is very, very poorly managed, and customer service seems to be at the bottom of their priority list.

Anyway, my cousins wanted to eat at a Hooters last weekend and this one happens to be the closest to their house. It is also the newest location and by virtue, the nicest. Coincidentally, the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl was going on at the same time. I'm happy to say that Hooters fought our hunger quite well that night.

I went with their Chicken Cobb Salad ($8.95). It's a great portion and filled me up. Granted, it's not the healthiest salad in the world with all that breaded and fried chicken and all that bacon. But then again, I'm not the healthiest eater in the world either. Bottom line: it was delicious.

I guess no Hooters review would be complete without mentioning the girls. Yes they were hot and distracting. But I have to give it up to the one who greeted us upon entry (I didn't get her name). When we came in, all of the screens were showing the bowl game. My cousin wanted to watch the rest of the Laker game. She stood there for what seemed like ten minutes trying to find the channel.

I drove the ~3 minutes to the restaurant, got my order, and headed home excited to enjoy some Hooters wing deliciousness. 

When I got home first thing my wife and I tried were the pickles, which were soggy, and tasted doughy. Next I opened our container of wings, only to find that they were unsauced, and sitting in about 1/4 inch of oil. 

I drove back and told the hostess my issues with the wings. She proceeded to state that they WERE sauced, but the mild and medium sauces were more of a buttery sauce. Now mind you, I fry food on a regular basis, and am a huge fan of wings. The oil at the bottom of my container had not even a small amount of vinegar or spice. I didn't want to argue in the middle of a crowded place. So I just ate my pride and asked for my order to be replaced with hot buffalo. A few minutes later she brought back my order, which were the original grease soaked wings re tossed in a mildly spicy excuse for buffalo sauce. 

Now I sit, wallowing in the misery of a disappointing, over priced meal. On a whole I still love Hooters, but on this occasion I would have been better off picking up some wings from the wing bar at Albertsons down the street.

This review is solely for the food, MEH is right! I have always preferred Wingstop among others but last night we were at Grimaldi's to pick up a free birthday pizza and hubby wanted wings so we decided on Hooters out of convenience since it was only two doors down. I haven't had Hooters in more than 7 years and now I remember why. Although I don't ever remember it being that bad, maybe because back then I didn't know any better since I'm really not that big into wings.

We ordered 20 pieces ($22 with tax), 10 pieces original wings with garlic parmesan sauce on the side and 10 pieces lemon pepper, comes with 2 ranch dressing. That had to be the most ordinary wings I've ever had! The original wings were tasteless and just plain boring! I decided to get the sauce on the side just in case we didn't like it (which was nasty by the way), but the original breading itself was bland, no salt and pepper detected just flour. The lemon pepper wings had little taste but it was undesirable, at least in comparison with Wingstop's lemon pepper which are pretty hard to beat.

Needless to say, I won't be back. That was the worst $20 I've spent, should have gone with my instinct and gotten Wingstop instead or just made some myself because not to toot my own horn but I make some wicked wings, according to my husband anyway ;)",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,5,2,2,5NdQhiVP9B94UyoUC4XP1g

Fortunately I live in the southwest side of Vegas, so this location isn't really far from where I live.

This late at night you just walk in and seat yourself. There are no waitresses on shift this late at night so for the drunk pervs, sorry but you might have to get your booty shorts fix somewhere else.  The bar area is the best place to if you want to be attended to right away since its the bartender basically doing everything this late.  If you decide to sit at one of the tables, you might find yourself constantly getting up just to waive him down for simple things such as refills.

Wings here we're still the same price though so don't be fooled and think its 25 cents per wings past midnight like the one in Hooters Hotel.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,2,1,4,sf0RYxkzNOlhsqdgPadIvg

All boobs aside, since I was a first timer, my girlfriends gave me a brief crash course of the menu and some recommendations. We started off with fried pickles for appetizers and 20 piece boneless chicken. Not knowing what kind of seasoning we want for our chicken, our Hooters girl was chill enough to allow us to do half and half on certain flavors to explore around. She recommended the Honey Thai seasoning and we chose the Cajun to seal the deal.

Our fried pickles came out, fresh out of the fryer, and we dove right in. Too bad they only gave out one dinky cup of dipping sauce, which completely ran out halfway into our appetizer. They charge extra for extra sauce (oh come on, really?), but we still went ahead and requested some more. Our boneless chicken finally came and I like how each flavors were served in separate plates. The Cajun was spicy, yet tolerable, and indeed SALTY! I suppose that's how Cajun seasoning is supposed to be, but it was alright. The Honey Thai, recommended by our Hooters girl, was probably my favorite. It's sweet, with a hint of spiciness. I would like it if the spiciness was kicked up another notch, but our Cajun wings already covered that department, so it was all good. They were also a bit salty.

Overall, it was a nice and SALTY experience. I think I chugged down 3 cups of water throughout the meal. Our Hooters girl was also nice enough to split our check three ways. She definitely got a nice tip from all of us.

I want to give it 3.5, but had to round up because of the accommodating staff and clean atmosphere.

She says people just getting off work will be arriving soon (I just got off work) and will need the seats for the bar video games. We kinda start arguing about it and I tell her I'm not moving. Another guy comes over and threatens to kick me out if I don't move to the other area. I tell him to look around and see how many people are playing. He does and still says i need ti move. I ask the lady to my immediate right if she is playing and she say no loud enough for them to hear.

Wow, the food was over priced and horrible. We complained about it all! Our waitress was very understanding, and tried to accommodate us.

After walking to three different tables, we tried cleaning the less messy one, to get irritated and walked back to the hostess. When we told her all three tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned, she coped an attitude and gently touched one for us. It was still sticky that we had to ask for a towel and wipe it down again. At this point I was ready to leave, but the people with me calmed me down a bit. We started our order with pretzels and beer cheese. The ""bread"" was not a pretzel and hard/burnt/over cooked, and the beer cheese was so loaded with green onions, all you tasted was onions. When we called the waitress over, she apologized and said they have been getting a lot of complaints tonight. Really? So fix it! Then one of us ordered 6 wings in a hot sauce of some kind. The ""wings"" came out like little bites, not wings, and with the wrong sauce. This friend didn't complain, so I did. The waitress apologized and said, those were their wings. How can you been known for wings, and don't serve proper wings with the sauce ordered? I personally ordered a plain grilled chicken sandwich. When I bit into it, there was so much hot seasoning, I couldn't eat it. When I called the waitress over and told her it wasn't a plain sandwich, she said, ""oh yea, we season all our chicken breasts."" Well, why didn't you say that when I ordered? Someone ordered a raspberry tea, and when we got the bill, there was a charge for a tea, and another charge for raspberry syrup. Really?

Note to hooters: when your guest asks for something that can be done, do it. Its a way to get repeat business. Not to mention when I tried to call again to place a to go order, no one answered the phone. Twice. I mean really?

Next time we want wings it will be The Chicken Shack in Henderson, which was my wife's first choice. Looking back at the situation we should have sent them back to the cook they were that bad.",opKXdKqe10Lu__s9z35M7g,1,1,1,X_j4SR1c5vJ3mWcgjvfjMg

Dear Caitlyn,
You are a rude ass C***. You were too lazy to get yourself off your stool to seat us, and when you did you walked over to the table without even acknowledging us, so that is why we did not follow you. A nice ""follow me this way"" would have been appreciated. We both know you use your mouth from the looks of it.. instead of using it for God knows what, use your words. But no she used her head and pointed it toward us then the table. So, we walked over to the table to meet you, and you greeted us with our menu's and a nice rolling of your eyes. Great touch, hooters had taught you well. 

Dear Hooters,
Caitlyn, needs to be fired, or retrained. I was really looking forward to the wings and the beer and I got neither. Instead I got a rude awakening of what your restaurant has to offer. I will never be coming back. 
Side note, I was with my friend, her family which included her dad, her husband and her two kids under 10. We would have ordered a lot and tipped well. Your loss. If you guys see Caitlyn, I hope you get a better experience than we did!",MB9eZ7J2jYByvNpmRSHxVQ,3,0,1,9QG4mQ633rw5isib1xN6-Q

Went here on a Sat afternoon (Aug 22nd) and I hadn't been to a Hooters in a very long time ever since the one near me in Sunset Station closed (terrible leadership decision there). Anyways, you used to goto Hooters for the atmosphere and wings. Now, I'm not really sure why anyone with more than two brain cells would eat, let alone work here.

Service was just, bad. Bad, bad, bad. I sat at the bar which was DEAD, customers wise. Nobody around to talk to at all would make anyone observant enough to notice and think, ""Hmm, I work here and I'm supposed to be friendly and cute to customers, maybe I should engage with this person for small talk!"" Nope. Not one girl came over to ask how I am while alone at the bar munching on my wings. That's just really weird for a place like this. 

I ordered the original 10-piece and curly fries. When my food was brought out it was basically slapped down and the waitress walked off never to return. No, I didn't need ketchup, extra napkins or anything else hun.. why bother asking like any professional waitress would? I had to get up from my chair and walk over to grab some condiments and paper towels down the bar. And, what the hell happened to the wet naps they used to give out? Those don't exist anymore? 

The wings were, meh. Some were overcooked, while a few of the drumsticks were undercooked with that nasty slimy taste. The curly fries were way too salted for my taste.

While looking around the bar I couldn't help but notice how dirty it was too. I never saw one girl wipe anything down. No pride in their work areas, but they sure do have some HUGE bedazzled purses stuffed under the bar area in plain view.

I had my debit card out and was ready to leave before anyone even came to pick up the plates. Guess I'm too old or expect too much from a place like this nowadays. Yes, it might be in a nicer area of Vegas, but God it's ran so ghetto.",aROI0cRyubBn9GTQYg0NOA,2,0,1,VsB5M8j2qCXLzdxlv4mSeA

I have always enjoyed their Lots-A-Tots (without the chives). Tater tots with cheese, sour cream and bacon, how can you go wrong? Other than that, I have never really found anything I liked on the menu. From what I remember, the wings made me feel sick, and the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was bland and soggy (although that was years ago in California). I kept it simple and ordered the burger sliders. They were pretty tasty, but the meat patties were much smaller than the buns that they used. My husband on the other hand, likes just about anything on the menu. 

Other than the awesome Lots-A-Tots, there were a few other positive things about this place.

Our server never gave us a refill, tho we were eating spicy wings, had apps etc. When I went to the bar to get our refills, the bartender was rude too.  Save your time and money, apparently this location only wants male customers.",st-0ULLlxbVvjzvVyoxuzg,0,0,1,_KgCPq-LMqkgKREq6sApQw
