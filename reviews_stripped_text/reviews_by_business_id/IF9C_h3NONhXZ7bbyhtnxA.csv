120072,2016-05-10,3,IF9C_h3NONhXZ7bbyhtnxA,"I ordered lunch for 5 people, to be delivered at 11 am. My rating is based on the quality of the food (mediocre), the price (too high given the quality of the food), and the lateness of the delivery (almost 30 minutes).

The food was lacking flavor. The fries were soft and under cooked. The falafel was bland. One person ordered some kind of chicken salad - it looked like hot chicken soup on a bed of lettuce. The portion sizes were small. $75 for 5 people is fine is the food was better, but this seemed more like mall food. Finally, I told the person who took the order that I would prefer they were early rather than late (we were on a tight schedule). I never got a call saying they would be late. I had to call. I never received an apology. I would have preferred to have been told that they couldn't make it by 11. It was a serious inconvenience.  I can't imagine giving them another shot.

Bummer because they are close to work and they deliver.",4PAbEV_aep8BYVZPzVGrnw,5,1,2,84KyyHJxpaZdL6PTeav3yw

Delivery took nearly 2 hours. 

Delivery driver entered through employee area behind cash register. 

But most importantly the order was wrong. I attached a pic showing special requests but those requests weren't honored. Received a sandwich that was ordered without onion or tomato. Opened it and looked and didn't see any so I started eating. ..

On my 3rd bite, which was halfway through this tiny expensive sandwich, my windpipe started swelling. Anaphylaxis. 

So ...

$10 for a tiny sandwich that took two hours to get wrong. 

$40 for the Epi pen I had to use. 

$500 for the ambulance ride. 

$500 for the ER copay

1194402,2016-03-21,0,IF9C_h3NONhXZ7bbyhtnxA,"First of all I want to preface this review by mentioning that I'm a professional chef who has worked for some of the best chefs in the city (Alain Ducasse, Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon among others). 
I ordered delivery early in the afternoon upon the recommendation of an Algerian fellah I was with. 
The food arrived after about 45 minutes (not too bad considering the veritable feast me and my ""friend"" had ordered). The food arrived lukewarm to slightly cold, except for the mint tea which was hot. This didn't matter at all!!! The food was that good! Highly recommended and can't wait to eat at the restaurant itself. If you wish to hear me get all ""chefy"" and ramble on about the individual dishes read on. If not, drop what your doing now and go eat at osi's.
The merguez plate I got with couscous and pita. The merguez (four links) was tender and spicy with a nice snap and pleasant lamby flavor. It was garnished with lightly charred onions, which added a counterbalance of sweetness and savoriness to the mildly assertive sausage. 
The cous cous was fabulous. Even though the online order form says it's ""Israeli"" couscous it was in fact the more common semolina variety common to North African cuisine. It was topped with an unexpected stew of carrot, acorn squash, potato and zucchini. Flavorful and delicious. From a text book perspective the veg was over cooked and very soft but I truly appreciate the flavors and textures of braised and stewed vegetables. So for me it was beautiful, especially paired with the NOT over cooked and properly steamed and seasoned couscous. 
The side of pita came with two very large, fluffy and soft flatbreads with the smallest hint of char on the exterior. Superb. If they are not made in house then they are from an excellent supplier. Not your average sad side of pita
We also ordered the falafel and hummus plate. The hummus was smooth and creamy with a texture that was not too thin or too thick. The flavor was in perfect balance between the nuttiness and earthiness of the tahini, the sharpness of the lemon, the piquancy of the garlic and the richness of the olive oil. Not one overtaking the other leaving the dominant flavor of chickpeas intact.  
The falafel was not great though. It was truly amazing. I have probably eaten falafel in nearly every middle eatern/med restaurant across the valley (no joke). Even though it was cold it was still crispy with an amazingly creamy interior. None of that starchy and dry texture that can often be true of mediocre falafel. The flavor was bright with herbs and spices but still not dominate over the flavor of chickpea
Also shared the platter of homemade ""salads""
Babaganoush was smoky and very good (not the best in town but still delicious)
The carrot salad was fantastic. Carrots were sweet and had a slight crunch and very redolent of aromatic spices like cumin and coriander and high quality olive oil
Beet salad was filled with properly cooked red beets (not too soft or undercooked), herbs and lightly crunchy onion. Good balance of sweetness and acidity 
The vegetable ""cole slaw"" (not sure of the proper name) was fresh and crunchy but did need a little more acid  
The true gem of the salads was the matbucha. A thick chunky purée of stewed tomato, peppers, garlic and spice. Addictive. Just plain addictive. The combination of the matbucha, couscous and acorn squash (in the couscous) was one of the best bites of food ive had in a while
Finally the mint tea. It came hot and full of fresh mint. It was subtle yet flavorful and complimented the whole meal. 
Thanks fellow yelpers for hanging in their while I wax poetic on one of my new favorite restaurants in town. Seriously go eat there. NOW!!!!",Gvd1MYKT5HDazRPmVy2sDg,5,0,5,JGGx6T0FldvOH_Hmp-9e5A

They carry ZERO dairy here, that alone gets a star. Thank you!

My in-laws were in town with their Kosher male friend and demanded we check this place out. They loved it. Me and hubs....not so much.

The place had 1-2 other customers the hour or two we were there. 

Meza was ordered for the table, it was all very good. The tomato item tasted a little old and ""off"" though. 

I ordered the veggie cous cous stew stuff and hubs ordered the falafel pita. Not even sure if these items were totally vegan, we asked and just really got the run around.

Soooooo the falafel pita had a weird taste. We (and especially my first gen American hubby) have had lots of falafel....from everywhere. It was just bland and odd. The pita bread itself my in-laws assure ""was traditional!!!!!"" ok it tasted fine.

The guy waiting on us was nice, but super slow and stood on his phone in the corner 90% of the time. We had to shout him over. He wears a lot of fancy perfume. 

I ordered iced tea, it was a mason jar? with a Lipton bag and some ice and mint inside it. Whatever I'm not looking for anything fancy.

Sooooooo...I really wanted to like my cous cous veggie stew. It was bland, not super hot/warm and just kinda meh. Even a sprig of green on the top would have been nice. I have no clue if it had veggie broth or lord forbid some kind of animal products in it.

Anyway. One star for zero dairy and another star for a nice server guy.

Tried the schnitzel sandwich and was surprised to see it served on a French baguette roll instead of the more traditional pita or laffa, but the bread ended up making the sandwich: crisp on the outside, fluffy inside, and super-fresh. Schnitzel was thin and crispy, sandwich condiments were a touch peppery for me. Sandwich served with some house-pickled vegetables, which was a nice touch.

Heads up that they're closed Saturdays for Sabbath. I'm used to kosher spots in Vegas having ridiculous prices, but the ones here are reasonable: $12 for sandwich above, and it was massive, delicious, and fresh.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,7,4,ri-ay-OnYgATqN_hte832g

I chose shawarma sandwich on a baguette roll. The waiter took our orders including two waters we asked for. We thought we would get our waters right away, but after 15 minutes of waiting, we reminded the waiter of our water. 
When the food came, we were a bit disappointed with the merguez entree. My fiancé got 4 pieces of lamb sausage that was thinner than the  sausage links you get from mcdo. It was sad because his sides were bigger than his main entree. I don't know if that's the usual portion of Mediterranean foods but we didn't think it was worth the $18 we paid for. Also, my fiancé noticed a piece of hair hanging from the side of the plate. He didn't make it a big deal since it wasn't IN his food. 
Aside from that, my $13 shawarma sandwich was good but not bangin. 
We probably wouldn't come to this place again.",SV0WeJAxng1om1WAdAr5jw,0,0,3,zxegZW2Bju_pEHN0lHUWqw

50 minutes later, with a $5 delivery charge BTW- The delivery guy calls me and says, ""I think I'm here, do you want to come outside or...""    or what? Come to the door? Seriously? I had to walk out twice since I never got a money total.
We are starving at this point, we open our food.... Soggy fries, cold falafels, and flavorless hummus and salad. Not a pickle or pepper to compliment even a bite. I've never eaten such bland Mediterranean food. Oh! And the portion size? Small. For 35 bucks I could have ordered a variety of dips, HOT food for two, 6+pitas, and dessert!

I raved about it to all of my Israeli colleagues, so hopefully I can bring him some more business. If you're looking for an authentic, delicious, satisfying meal, this is your place.

I stood there for a moment hoping my entrance would spark him to maybe offer me a drink and put the chairs down.  No such luck.  I slowly turned, made my way to the door (hoping he'd say something to keep me there), and left.

I bought Groupon to try their food and I went to eat, I ordered 2 baguette sandwiches  (for me and my friend), it was less than mediocre and bad value for money IMHO.

When we ask for the bill, we presented the Groupon and the waitress told us ""Groupon is not valid for baguette"" - are you kidding me??? I came to this place just because of this deal, to try your restaurant ... I was in shock, I asked to talk with the manager, the waitress told me that he will talk with him. When he came back, he said the manager can't do nothing for me and I need to pay them.

I felt like I was **scammed**, I felt embarrassed for the owner, how come you have a new client that you need and want to impress and the outcome is bad review + I will tell anyone I know my bad experience?

5902349,2015-12-02,4,IF9C_h3NONhXZ7bbyhtnxA,"Almost skipped Osi's after reading a Yelp review mentioning that they close at 7:30 p.m.  That's an ungodly hour for this night owl to eat dinner.  Happily I noticed on the Yelp page that their hours were until 9, and after calling to verify, we were on our way.

This small storefront is simply decorated, but comfortable and clean.  A friendly welcome and excellent service followed.  There is no alcohol served, and you can bring wine, but it must be Kosher wine.  Most liquor stores these days have a good selection of Kosher wines, but the bright and casual atmosphere at Osi's isn't that kind of place.  

A number of the menu entrees are available as platters or sandwiches.  I ordered the Merguez sausage entree.  All entrees come with a small Israeli salad and a choice of potatoes or rice.  I didn't want either of those, so the waiter suggested couscous.  Hubby had that, too, along with  Schnitzel.  We didn't expect the couscous to arrive in large bowls covered with a carrot and vegetable stew on top, each a portion larger than what you'd get from preparing a box of Near East for a family of four!

I enjoyed the Merguez, since it was a new taste for me - spicy but not fiery, and covered with some fried onions.  I don't know if I'd order it again, since some of the other non-familiar items on the menu were also appealing.  My husband's schnitzel was good, too.  

There seems to be a bit of a price disconnect between the entrees and the sandwiches.  Our platters were $14.98 for a substantial amount of food.  The same items in a baguette sandwich would be only $2 less, and come with no sides.  I really would have preferred the sandwich, because (wo)man can live by bread alone, even with nothing inside, but I couldn't justify it.  And I'll get to relive the couscous experience tomorrow, from the styrofoam ""gift box"" I took home.

Oh, and for you who live by Yelp and don't have an unlimited data plan, they have wifi!

Osi's is a welcome addition to the growing Kosher restaurant presence in Vegas, and one that will appeal to the non-Kosher among us.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,8,4,rKcutuY3ycHGIq9xpGlQ8Q
