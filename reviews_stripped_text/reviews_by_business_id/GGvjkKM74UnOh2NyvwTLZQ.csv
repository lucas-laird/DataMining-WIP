They accommodated our needs when it came to ordering sushi, they went above and BEYOND for us!!! I go to many sushi places and I've never seen this level of hospitality. Truly impressed. THANK YOU SO MUCH for making my friends birthday SO special. We have been to all the Jjanga locations and the sushi is delicious at them all! If you don't like sushi, go for some cocktails and check out the restroom (; it's hidden Vegas gem for sure!",wmacqgo9clInj4OeWr7ltg,2,0,5,ttwiwppRxoKp0sWl1bCOVg
1503500,2015-10-01,8,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"Jjanga, known for their sushi, is now running this spot as a Korean resto with karaoke. I have mixed feelings, since I'm not that into Korean but I really liked the sushi spot that was here before- there are a few sashimi and seafood items on the menu now, but it's largely deep fried, stir fried, and soup dishes.

OYSTERS: An order of 6 will set you back a low $10, and they're large. I did not care for how they were seasoned with a spicy sauce, but my BF really enjoyed them.
LEMON UNI: This is perhaps my new favorite way to eat uni! Generous portion, good price, served several pieces on a halved lemon. Squeeze for more juices and flavor. Would get again!
BEEF TATAKI: Decent flavors, it's a simple dish and it's about average here. Not necessarily something I'd order again.
GARLIC CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS: Well, there was lettuce and chicken. Lettuce was weird small pieces of iceberg that did not easily make wraps, and the chicken was juicy and breaded but lacked flavor. The provided sauce was not garlicky, but more of a peppery paste.
SCREAMING ORGASM: Sashimi salad, super saucy. The sauce wasn't flavored quite as I was used to, a bit less acidic. Generous portion, would get again.

Service at the bar was friendly, and they kept most of the cool glow-in-the-dark décor from when this spot was Fish in the Spotlight. I'll have to come back for actual Korean dishes, but I'm still mourning the fact that this isn't a sushi spot any more. I'd really prefer if this was still sushi and karaoke, regardless of the name.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,8,3,ECQmvuX3qx6pSmYqCVJg4g

Not the typical AYCE sushi that im used to at the Jjanga Japanese Restaurant on Decatur & Jjang Steak and Sushi on Ft Apache, but the menu here is SUPERB!!! I didnt think I would be surprised since they always do an excellent job, but I was super impressed at how delish the food was! My favorite was the ""Cheese Bo Ssam (grilled pork belly w/ cheese & kim chee on top,"" & the Kimchi Egg Rolls! Aside from the great food, they always have top notch service. They have light up menus & tables!!! Fun! Fun! Fun! An amazing dinner experience!!!",WBeXazzNyp9pBDcvux8bVw,2,1,5,85I-46v5FNu-sx07IXCSzg

I went with my mom, she likes really old school hard to find sushi, sea urchin..they had it. Chicken assholes, Korean delicacie..We laughed so hard.. Flavored fruit sakes...Really Korean style  Karoke/sushi bar. It just opened, so there wasn't alot of people there.

2565460,2015-09-29,3,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"Came here for a meetup. The service was very good and all the food and drinks where 50% off which was awesome !Everyone in the group ordered a few things and we all shared.

Fries- Very nice, crisp-hot and came with ketchup 4/5

Manul chicken- Was okay, came with lettuce to wrap it in, not my favorite 3/5

Gyoza- Hot and very crispy on the outside,nice juicy flavors on the inside. 
Had a nice dipping sauce                                                                        5/5

Beef tataki- First time trying it and i'm so glad I did. S tender you could cut it with a chopstick. Almost melted in mouth, no real need to chew. Nice dipping sauce       5/5

Garlic chicken wings- Omg definitely one of my favorite dishes here. Perfect crunchy outside,juicy inside and a sweet savory spicy garlic sauce. We had 2 orders 5/5

Jjang pong tang- I didn't try this one, but no one at the table had any complaints

Spicy pork with cheese(sorry don't know what menu item this was)- Very tender meant with yummy stringy cheese. Nice little bite                                                            3/5

Bulgogi- Very tender beef and very nice flavor. Little sweet and savory  5/5

3199313,2015-09-17,5,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"NEVER DISAPPOINTED!!!

Jjanga does a freaken AMAZING job of seriously getting my fix for as close to Cali kinda food or level of quality I may be craving!! Came here for soft opening & a couple times after grand opening! I SERIOUSLY so so so greatful to him for opening up a location that would please my cravings for KOREAN food!!! 

All the employees are freaken attentive & ALWAYS funny which is a necessity in a bar atmosphere! But they do have a great ROLE MODEL so would not expect anything less! 

My bigger AMAZEMENT is the freaken price point for everything!!! What the CHEAP!!!! like a poor college students dream come true for price point.. like competitive LA cheap pricing! I LOVE IT!!! because that means I could eat variety!

MANUAL SSAM CHICKEN $8 - this thing is packed w/ FLAVORS! basically fried garlic chicken & it served w/ some lettuce & a spicy garlic hot sauce too! Light & fluffy & tender I would have to say.... definitely makes you crave more & more.

HAE MOOL JUNGOL $25 - this is the LARGE portion of the JJANG PONG TANG which is normally $15 but this soup comes large w/ udon noodles. We had 4 people so this was perfect, although I do LOVE the jjang pong tang because I could enjoy the soup itself! So refreshing that I can't wait for winter.

LEMON UNI $7 - I was so freaken EXCITED to see uni on the menu!!! It was so good!! On top of that... they freaken had FRESH WASABI!! I was totally pushing my luck & asked...  they just brought it out after they said they would check!

PINEAPPLE SOJU $15 - ummm BRAVO!! most places they just mix pineapple juice & bring it out in a bottle... but here they bring it out in a FROZEN actual pineapple!!! Then as you scoop out the shot you could even scrap off some of the pineapple & create a slushy shot! Plus the frozen pineapple keeps the soju so refreshingly COLD!

SOJU $10
SAPPARO PITCHER $14

THANK YOU THANK YOU jjanga oppa for making a spot like this... of course I do love your AYCE sushi as well... but my tummy can only hold so much raw fish ahahhaha 

Even though this place is a long distance way from where I live... I will be coming to get my fix!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,9,7,5,wCyY0AclQXFN9gTW88jVlg

3578850,2015-11-16,3,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"My favorite spot to drink and hang out with my friends! 

Food: if you're a JJanga sushi fan, they definitely carried over some over their menu items like screaming orgasm and who's your daddy which are both really good. You really need to explore their Korean food though. We tried the spicy seafood soup (1 order feeds 2 people), beef egg rolls (favorite) and the cheese pork belly (from their old menu). Man, I can't even find the right adjective to describe the flavors! There's a lot more to try so I'll update this in the future.

Drinks: I love their jaws bar but ask for them to make it a little bit stronger since this is almost a fruity cocktail. As for soju, please get the GRAPEFRUIT SOJU!!! It's the best and it comes in fancy Voss like bottles! Omg!! I can't even explain how good this drink is.

Atmosphere: kpop all night which I love:) they really made sure you experience their culture not just through food but songs as well. They have karaoke rooms which varies in price depending on how big your group is.

Service: shout out to CESS and CHUCK who always takes care of me!! I definitely enjoy their company and they're on top of things. They never fail me and always makes sure that everyone is having a good time.

Overall, I fell in love with this place. It's very refreshing and feels like home to me. I love the people and food so you should try it for yourself",tt9Ribp--2ddSLKc2pIXvQ,4,3,5,BWKCQ_WumG2VQoDhx8qccQ
4208579,2015-10-05,0,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"Thought we would try this out since we love jjangas other restaurants. Loooved the food. We had the whos your daddy and the baked mussels for appetizers. It was freakin delicious lol and for our entrées we had the screaming orgasim and the pork belly dish. It was well plated and tasted great.  The bartender cess was very sweet, attentive and we loved her. We definitely will go back. We had a good time",fVNJbQ_wq9jWCU65GxcjaA,0,0,5,Hz20TE2OCDu9hNrzx2kZ2w
4265540,2015-12-10,1,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"I'm not sure what the hype is, since I haven't had a pleasant experience at jjanga locations. I came here to take advantage of their soft opening, where all menu items were 50% off.

The fried squid- 1/5 stars.  It seemed like it had been reheated after it had been fried. A bit soggy. 

Crab rolls- 4/5 stars.  Since this was the only dish I liked at Jjanga sushi, I was a bit happy to be able to order this as an item. It's heavy, but good. 

Tonkatsu pizza- 3/5 stars.  Nothing to write home about. 

Pineapple soju- 2/5 stars.  Watered-down with juice and very little soju. 

The vibe here is cool, and has a clubby feel. I just wish they had a mini dance floor or something. There was hardly anyone in here when we went. The prices are steep. I'm not sure if I would even go back for HH prices.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,1,2,M9RGv8NdLYHF4BoEV_brFg

4907470,2015-09-26,0,GGvjkKM74UnOh2NyvwTLZQ,"We are fans of Jjanga down by Decatur and spring mountain, so we were excited to see they opened a new location. There is no all you can eat sushi, but the club/bar atmosphere with light up menus, fun lights and kpop beats is a fun atmosphere for a Friday or Saturday night. 

The appetizers are a couple dollars more than the other Jjanga location, but the generous portions and nice prices on entrées make up for it. 
Choo-Choo the head chef is great and makes you feel welcome and enjoys connecting with the guests. 

I got the uni rice bowl. It was a great deal for 10 dollars. 3 different kinds of caviar, rice, uni, crab, kimchi and more grace the bowl and make it so beautiful that it's a shame to mix it. But so yummy when you do. 

The bulgogi was tender and served with a salad. We got a few appetizers and enjoyed the atmosphere the great flavors and friendly wait staff. Not a disappointment! If you are feeling adventurous and want to come to a fun and friendly place don't hesitate to give this place a try.",Pg-sMoiilKCVPs41vf5V_Q,0,0,5,DS4Aw0ZmLw61YU9XeshtBg
