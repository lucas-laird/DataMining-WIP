There were great sake options as well. The entire meal was well thought out and paced beautifully.  We enjoyed every second without feeling rushed in any way. This is a hidden Las Vegas gem.

The rolls were good sized but not a whole lot of real food substance. The seafood and vegetable elements were so thin and small compared to giant portions of cream cheese, mayo and sugary sauces. Flavor was good but nothing spectacular, decent presentation. Despite the amount of rolls, ingredients are very similar without a lot of selection.

Employee synergy was so good I had to ask the sushi chef (not the owner) whether or not it was a family owned restaurant.  My internal SushiBar was set by a once amazing Japanese sushi bar in Hollywood, a family run (in its heyday) bar I've frequented since I was a child.  Only today have I run into anything comparable.

Service was great - neither the chef nor server were overly talkative, but both were really pleasant, polite and attentive (I was waiting a moment as I'd ordered 2 of the most elaborate rolls I saw).  Despite my having ordered my sushi to-go, the chef served me a cucumber salad and the waitress brought water, which was kind.

I ordered three rolls, one of which was the Touchdown roll on the recommendation of an earlier reviewer - NICE!  I've forgotten the names of the other two rolls but, at the moment, I'm calling them all delicious.

408925,2013-01-23,3,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"I would just like to preface this review by saying that; I have never been a sushi person & always thought it was the most over hyped, band wagon-y type food out there & I never wanted anything to do with it. And yes, I had tried it before & gave it a chance, but it was never something that I would say; ""Hey, let's go out & get some sushi!"" 

Well...things done changed! I would just like to give credit where credit is due. Thank you Cresta I. for opening my eyes!! I have had the pleasure of sharing a few great meals with Cresta. However, this was by far the best & most amazing! 

I agreed to go with her to YG&S for her pre work meal, after my impromptu flash mobesque UYE @ Retro Bakery, purely as moral support though. All the while, she was telling me I was going to try this, that & the other, and of course I was telling her that I would in fact not be trying any of it. 

So, I ordered my chicken fried rice & she ordered a Joy roll, a Philadelphia roll, and a fresh, raw scallop. Finally, after much prodding & insisting on Cresta's part, I reluctantly tried the Philly roll. Not bad. So, at which point I had nothing to lose & I tried the Joy roll. OMFG!! So fresh & delicious! I was really blown away. And, it only got better. The scallop was freakin' amazing! Like nothing I have ever tasted before. The flavors were just so fresh & clean. The ponzu that comes on the scallop is just the right amount of citrusy kick that this dish needs. I was a little wary of the tiny roe & expected it to be fishy & salty. I could not be more wrong. I could not taste anything really, and I just felt the little ""pops"" in my mouth, like tiny little roe just hugging my taste buds. Well, that would be the best way to describe it anyway :P

Having said all of that; I will admit that I have conformed & will publicly admit it in this forum, amongst all of my esteemed Yelp peers, that I officially like sushi.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,5,3,5,XYya3yK9nZsPylxCvSogbw

Staff greeted us and we were seated immediately. It wasn't busy. We ordered our drink. I order hot green tea, my boyfriend orders hot sake. My tea was lukewarm, and tasted deluted and old. I was very disappointed.  We start ordering our sushi and rolls. Meanwhile,  the family in front us is ordering their meal, and a new couple is seated behind us a few minutes later.  We are waiting and waiting and waiting. The waitress,  is fly by us with no eye contact. The family in front of us has received all their food, and still our table hasn't been served. Finally, we were fed up once the couple behind us starts getting their food. My boyfriend is able to pull the waitress over to our table to complain about the long wait. And she starts telling us that she has placed the order, but if she tells the chefs again they will get mad. That's not my problem, we have been waiting more than 30 minutes. The family in front of us has finished, paid, left, and replaced by new people. Once we complain, our food starts rolling in, but our sushi is over powered by wasabi. We lift the sushi off the rice and huge chunks of wasabi are squeezed between fish and rice. I cleaned some of it off, but my boyfriend was very disappointed, he didn't eat any of his food.

And they serve inexpensive, paint-stripper sake. And very decent chicken teriyaki plates that come on top what is essentially a small salad, which I always appreciated. Great garlic edamame and reverse happy hour values. Hands-down my favorite place to go after hours when I don't want to leave the neighborhood or go to a sad casino-sportsbar; Yummy Grill is always full of lively (drunk) people and efficient service.

Giving a three because this place isn't exactly a cultural or culinary standout- it's just real good at what it does: be an affordable, late-night ,extremely decent place to pick up sushi and relax with friends.",hvnnwWE58HhThQF31xV7MA,0,1,4,Wo4qPX815BrFhLqDHssN7g

We sat at the sushi bar and lived watching the chefs hard at work. Suggestions were given when we asked and Rey allowed my hubby to order off the regular menu while sitting at the bar, not all sushi bars allow this. 
The food was amazing! Honestly, we have eaten a great deal of sushi in Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada and Yummy Grill & Sushi ranks as a contender for #1. We had tuna that was so tender it melted in our mouth. I liked that the cut rolls were bit size as there is nothing worse than large pieces that you have to try and bite through the seaweed. These were perfect and full of sushi, not just a bunch of rice. Everything was well priced and defiantly worth every penny.

I am absolutely loving this place. From the staff to the food--everything was awesome. Situated off of Lakemead and Tenaya, is where you'll find this hidden gem. We came here around 9pm, sat at the bar, and was greeted by a nice server and a talented sushi chef(Wen I believe was his name) and ordered the following :
--teriyaki chicken dinner plate(guy's order) huge portion;enough to split btwn two people;came with CA rolls,shrimp and veggie tempuras, and salad--the bf said chicken was ""moist and not rubbery""
--salmon and tuna nigiri-amazingly fresh and very very good. They also don't give you measly little pieces..
--toro(fatty tuna)- highlight of the night(food wise) this is by far the best piece of fish I have ever had in my life and take it from me, I LOVE fish.
--spicy shrimp with yum yum- honestly, I've had A better version of this, but who cares?! Everything else made up for it! The good thing about it was that the specially made this for us since it wasn't on the menu, so they get an A for that.
--Eel- I could eat it all day! Yum!!
--ice cream tempura- its hard to mess this up and was expecting it to be like everywhere else's: WRONG! Huge ass portion and they added chocolate sauce! That's what's up..

Ya ya, bill was 63 bucks..but when dinner is that good, I'd gladly hand them my money. But I think the other highlight of the night was when we ended up chopping it up with the chef/owner Eric. The amount of passion this guy has with the food he serves, his restaurant, and especially his clients is amazing. And I think it all shows through his food, staff, and even the other patrons we met in the restaurant.

499387,2015-07-05,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"I am a sushi snob. Coming from San Francisco, we are spoiled with several incredible sushi restaurants. My girlfriend and I searched yelp for the best sushi restaurant we could find based on ratings, photos, reviews, menu, etc.

On the way to Yummy Sushi, the taxi driver mentioned that most of the chefs from the strip travel to this particular sushi joint, as it is one of the best in Las Vegas. Upon walking through their doors, we were warmly greeted by all of the staff including the chefs behind the bar. Please keep in mind we visited the evening of July 4th. The place was full! Every table was taken, which was fine because I always prefer to sit at the bar and talk sushi with the chefs. 

We ordered nigori sake to start, with fresh seaweed salad that was on point! I told the server, and our chef, that we wanted to order the omakase. In other words, we will leave it up to the chef to choose our dinner items. The fish was incredibly fresh, the highest quality, and had many exotic options which were in season. As far as the quality of food, variety of options, and freshness of the fish - Yummy Sushi is 5 out of 5 stars. Now here is the best part of our experience, which places Yummy Sushi in an unparalleled category that couldn't possibly be matched by any of the competitors in Vegas.

We had to call a taxi to get back to the hotel in time to catch the fireworks. We waited 40 mins and no taxi showed up. We asked the gal at the front to call and check on the taxi, which she did and discovered it would be at least another 30 mins. We called a second taxi company which was an hour and a half wait!!! 

A few minutes later, we were approached by one of the chefs who happened to be the owner of Yummy Sushi. He insisted on giving us a ride back to our hotel. We were blown away by his generous offer to leave his restaurant and taxi us back. We had an enjoyable, pleasant conversation on the ride back. He was truly a nice, kind, gentle, generous man. He refused our $20 tip for the ride. Again, we were amazed at his generosity. This is one of the best experiences we have had at a restaurant, sushi or not. Do yourself a favor and visit Yummy Sushi asap. You will not be disappointed. Thank you again for taking such wonderful care of your customers. You could have taken our money and let us figure out a way back on our own. Instead, you went above and beyond and made our trip that much better. We will definitely be visiting your restaurant the next time we are in town.",UDuzIn6BgFuMfF32WNE4ng,2,5,5,SSgI0AaP1ImM2aV70bsr9Q

Sit at the sushi bar where the chef treats you like a guest in his home and shares his love for sushi with you. He is not Japanese, but why does that even matter?

Hands down some of the best sushi I have ever had. The place is small so we made a reservation it was our wedding anniversary so we definitely wanted a seat and not have to wait especially since we have little kids. The waitress was super friendly made awesome recommendations everything she recommended was incredibly fresh and delicious. She was very attentive and everyone that brought us our dishes were great. They even brought out a couple complementary items. We decided to splurge and order the live raw lobster and it was beyond my expectations I have never had anything so incredibly good. The lobster was prepared three ways : lobster tail sashimi , The head and claws were prepared in a creamy still with vegetables and citrus, and a miso soup with lobster pieces. The chef brought out the live lobster to show me before he prepared I thought that was really cool. We also had the Toro cheek sashimi that was so buttery and good. Next time we go we will make a reservation for the Omakase. Our waitress told us that's the way to go to try a bunch of different items. Not all you can eat so the prices were a little bit more than what we normally spend on sushi but it was worth every penny especially the lobster.  Cannot wait to go back.

Dinner consisted of mainly nigiri and a few rolls. The sushi rice was horrific. Very mushy and unappetizing.  The nigiri was very inconsistent with the amounts of wasabi.

The live shrimp was good.
The home made wasabi that cost $7 extra was not worth it. Too much filler with little horse radish or whatever they used to make it with. Uni dish.. they say the uni is live uni... but it was not fresh enough (not creamy enough). Personally, i think the uni was dead when showing. The rice below the uni was mixed with seaweed that was over cooked. NOT fresh.
Soft shell crab was okay... the crab was okay but the coating was awful. Too much of the breading that I could barely taste the crab itself.
Most importantly, the sashimi was not cut right and it had too much lemon taste to it too. It is bazzar that they put lemon before serving. I dont put lemon on my sashimi because the acidity ruins the taste. I only put lemon on when the fish is not fresh... 
Overall, the taste of the food was not balanced. 
I gave 2 stars because of the kindness of the servers not for the food. If you are seeking authentic Japanese food, do not go here.

Coming from Los Angeles and having stellar sushi (no, not rolls, sushi), I should've judged the book by its cover. Driving up to this location, I could already see that it was a 'roll' place.

Live Uni for 22 bucks? No thanks. I can get the same thing in Los Angeles for 7 dollar a piece.

My family simply ordered the combo meals. I myself had a beef teriyaki plate. Why would I get that at a sushi place? I'm not quite sure. But I guess being on vacation threw me off.

Anyways, the food was cold when it came out to me. It was disgusting. The beef was cold, the tempura was cold, and altogether this joint just doesn't deserve the 4.5 stars it has. I feel so bad for those people who think this place is the best sushi joint ever. I think it just says that Vegas lacks a proper sushi restaurant. When you're in Los Angeles, go to Little Tokyo.

785853,2012-05-12,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"My bad perception of Yummy grill& Sushi has changed. Some years ago when this place first opened up I was very disappointed. At that time before the big remodel, I went in and ordered the lunch special to go which consisted of the main entree, soup and an appetizer. On the menu it didn't say anything about it not being available for take out and the counter guy didn't tell me anything. When I got my order I noticed that my bag was very light. It turns out that they gave me the main entree and the appetizer but not the soup. I felt like I was ripped off and never visited them again.

But this year when I looked at the pictures of this restaurant on Yelp I was very surprised because it changed. So I went in yesterday after work and ordered a lunch special of Eel on rice, salad, and soup from their new menu along with a sushi roll. While I was waiting the nice waitress gave me a little yummy appetizer. When my order came I was so happy to see that I got everything including the Soup and Salad. It all tasted great and I will visit again now that everything has gotten better.",4KQ_INZcDdjC8xw5p0nDrw,0,0,4,eR3NC4k3B57_GOV31zc20g

The 2 main chefs are amazing with their knife skills and artistry, other 2 helpers/apprentice type are ok. Try to get your nigiri made by the main chefs.

I asked to rush it & take-to-go when I should have spoken to a manager. 3 mins after giving us our take out & bill, she said she was deducting the mis-order since she sensed my furry.

My recommendation for raw fish lovers is to sit at the bar and let one of the chefs serve you whatever they have fresh that day, they never disappoint.  (If your whole order consists of rolls, you don't like sushi). 

Bonus: Asahi on draft; wasabi leaf (better than the horseradish fake wasabi); the staff is extremely friendly and seems happy to be working there. 

Best memories at Yummy: O-toro (absolutely dreamy), blue fin tuna and mackerel, incredibly yummy quality. 

Also, the best nigiri is served with room temperature rice, slightly warm even better, the fish shouldn't be too cold, it doesn't have as much flavor.  And who cares if one of the chefs isn't Asian?

In a strip mall - near PEP Boys is one of the best sushi places I've eaten in - and that includes New York, San Fran, London and Paris. I admit my first love is a good steak, but for fresh fish you won't do better in Vegas than here. The chefs come to your table, are willing to make whatever you want, offer free samples based on what you've ordered, all with reasonable prices (my friend and I had 3 roll entrees, miso soup and cucumber salad, all for under $50 including the taxes and tip) 

My Passion roll (crab, shrimp tempura, coconut flakes, avocado, cream cheese, yum yum, eel sauce) melted the blended tastes in my mouth perfectly. My friend had Takoyaki (octopus balls with some sort of deep fried radish that kept her talking about the taste hours after the meal) She also had a Rainbow roll (spicy crab, with salmon, tuna, yellowtail and shrimp) She liked it just a tad less than the Takoyaki. The miso soup was the best either of us ever had. The cucumber salad was our least favorite. It reminded us more of a Korean type dish, and while it was tasty, we would have preferred something closer to traditional Japanese.

My boyfriend and I came on a friday night around 12am and it was packed. I heard and read good things about this place so why not? Their happy hour menu is pretty good with half-off on their select nigiri and simple rolls. They had a large house sake for $4.50 during happy hour.

Decor: Small, packed, loud. Clean. Kind of regret not grabbing a seat at the sushi bar! Faster service that way.

We ordered a few rolls (Johnny, That's What She Say) to start. It took 30-40 minutes to get 3 rolls types. By the end of the night we had 6 rolls, house sake, and two orders of gyoza in an hour and 40 minutes.

The fish was flavorful, fresh, rich, and delicious. Pretty generous on the fish as well. Presentation was beautiful. The sauces were drizzled with care on our rolls. The sushi itself tantalized our taste buds. 

It's a bit pricey since it's all ala carte and we know it's not all-you-can-eat. For a non-AYCE joint, we expected maybe faster service despite the quality rolls. They came out at a snail's pace that we kept getting hungry in between finishing each roll dish. We felt a bit sorry for the lone waitress doing everything from cleaning, tending to other customers, getting side dish orders etc. She was doing her best to serve everyone though. Maybe the service wouldn't have suffered as much if they had another waitress/waiter or maybe an extra chef. Don't get me wrong, we didn't expect them to come out with our order immediately, but it took FOREVER to get each one!  

For the price we paid (Around $80ish by the end of the night just between the two of us), I kind of wished we chose another place. It was a delicious meal, just not-so-great timing on the sushi. I don't mind paying for sushi, but if I'm paying quite a bit extra for an ala carte place, I expected a bit better in terms of timeliness. Maybe we'll come back and try it again on less busy night.",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,8,2,3,1WhxrxcAt7dCytLr_cByQA

*Super fresh fish and live shell fish 

*Always have different types of fish coming in so the menu is constantly changing. Check the white board when you walk in 

*Amazing service! Everyone in the place says what's up when you get there, and they yell good bye and thank you as you leave. 

*If you sit at the bar... You will get VIP treatment, but not over the top. Everyone there is great, but Eddie is the one that made us start going back...

The first time we dined here it was by chance; we were hungry and we're just cruising Lake Mead Blvd looking for a place to eat.  Had I written the review the first time, I would have given 4.5 stars.  The fish was fresh and delicious. We tend to get nigiri and sashimi only. The server was friendly and the sushi chefs too.

We had the same server and she is very friendly and nice.  Now, here is where it all goes awry.  We order a couple of hand rolls, it was good.  I love yellow tail, so I requested an order of hamachi nigiri.  The sushi chef prepares it and hands it to me while my man is away in the bathroom.  I look at it and it does not look like yellowtail.  I take one small bite and I can barely bit into it.  On top of that he tried to add something to the fish to make it more edible.  I still don't know what it was.

 My man comes back from the bathroom and I look at him and he says ""what is that?""  I said, ""supposedly yellowtail"".  My man takes a bite, looks at the sushi chef and says ""Yellowtail??""  He only said one word with a question in his voice and the sushi chef immediately says, ""oh so sorry I give you better piece, I accidentally give you piece that was bleeding"".  What???  I have been eating sashimi for 15 years now, my man a little longer.  We know good sashimi.  He tried to pull one over on us and I felt really insulted.  He shouldn't be serving that to anyone, even if they hadn't known the difference.

Shame on you owner and sushi chef! (slap on the hand)  I thought I had found a great place to have sushi in town, now I will have to resume my search.

We were greeted shortly after entering and sat at the sushi bar so we could watch the action.  

Initially confused by the three items for the menu.  You get a happy hour checklist, regular menu checklist and a normal menu.  

We ordered:

Live abalone
Live soft shell crab
Bluefin tuna
Salmon 
Salmon belly
Mackerel
Salmon roe
Albacore belly
Sea conch
Eel roll
Arizona roll
Something Wrong roll
Fresh wasabi

They also gave us comped seaweed salad and pieces of a pancake type item.

Short story is that everything was high quality and very tasty.  Our only qualm was the eel roll.  That one roll only had a pencil size sliver of eel on it.  It was tasty but disappointing.  It was a happy hour item and if that was the standard serving I would not order it again.  Hence the four star rather than five.

The staff and chefs were all friendly, helpful and attentive.",6ZaL6fBlKx5tb8c9opl7rQ,0,0,4,wo64-lxPwO95jKeKqYE2xg

Overall I felt as though the sushi was fine, well prepared and organized, and the waitstaff were polite. However, the tuna itself was not very delicious, I don't think it was particularly spicy, and the sauces used on some of the rolls were unusual - the spicy mayo tasted vaguely fruity, like mango or something?? In addition the crunchy spicy tuna roll was just a tuna roll with crunchy thrown on top of it, not a style I have seen in the past and not one I enjoyed. Overall everything was fine but not actually good.

The portions were generous. We over-ordered, so keep in mind that the rolls will most likely be bigger than you expect.",HxeiKWNQhp1QD7oImwzIxw,1,0,2,RhW4ZoFwbSD38R2jYJ0bng

The fresh fish of the day specials were amazing, as was the refreshing specialty roll menu.  Of course, they have the standard fare for those who have difficulty breaking out of their yum yum covered, imitation crab filled comfort zones. To top that off, they also carry Orion beer from Okinawa!  Nice change from the Sapporo and Asahi standard.

- clam- loved the hint of seasme oil drizzled on it. It was super fresh. the sweet plum was a nice addition
-conch- the texture was chewier and harder, I wasn't a huge fan favorite, but you may like it
-large scallops- really fresh and mild tasting
-silver salmon- soft and has a more subtle fish taste
-regular salmon- buttery and melts in your mouth
- live shrimp- tastes like it just jumped out of the ocean, crunch and light tasting

Christie is the true queen and since she is a regular, they really hooked us up!

The first roll was a huge futomaki type veggie roll and it was perfect! I have not had sushi forever and unless I make it at home to explain my veg only is normally a true nightmare lol.


The second roll was an avocado stuffed crispy roll. It was a cheat day and I knew I was craving something fried to go with all the alcohol we were about to consume.

First and BEST omakase experience ! Omakase is a show in itself. Watching Chef Eric work his magic and show his creativity in his dishes. max points on service ! 

Fresh Wasabi - made into a relish. Addicting! went well with a lot of dishes but also yummy to ""snack"" on while waiting in between dishes. produces a fast effect to the nasal passages. has a nice, sweet flavor. 

#1 - Marinated Tuna on top of chopped Mountain Yam with Wasabi Tobiko

Saw Chef Eric chopping mountain yam. After chopping, the yam produced a ""slimy"" texture, similar to okra but crunchy like jicama. Yam itself was plain but paired with a marinated tuna balanced flavors very well. what a variety of textures

#2 - Deep Fried Gobo/Burdock Root with dipping sauce

Little chips. Fried perfectly. Very slight starchy texture but crispy overall. Lightly sweet. Great ""snack"" ! 

#3 - Fresh Santa Barbara Sea Conch with salt/pepper/sesame oil dipping sauce

Very fresh. Meat texture had a nice ""bite"" texture. LIGHTLY dipping the sliced conch in the sauce gives it a nice flavor. Salt helps brings out more sweetness of the conch meat

#4 - Fresh Hama Hama & Shigoku Oysters

One of my fears on eating raw oysters is they being not fresh, and not clean (resulting in biting into sand/shell/etc.) Two different sizes. Shigoku oysters were small and fat. Very clean and fresh. Gave a nice, creamy texture. Hama Hama oysters were much bigger, not as ""fat/thick"". Outer ""rim"" of the oyster, gave it a nice ""crispy/crunchy"" texture when eating. 

#5 - Fresh Live Scallop w/ Dried Miso

Served two ways. The scallop itself was thinly sliced and sprinkled with dried miso and layered with slices of cucumber. The miso gave it a nice flavor on top of the fresh taste of the scallop. The muscle? was sliced and placed in the middle. Not chewy but gave a nice ""crispy/crunchy"" texture, similar to what you'd get from eating fresh geoduck sashimi 

#6 - Takoyaki - Deep Fried Fresh Octopus Suction Cups

At first, i thought this was calamari. But was told it was the SUCTION CUPS of an octopus leg. Lightly battered and deep fried. Crispy batter. Suction cups itself was nice and ""crispy"" 

#7 - Fresh Live Hokkaido Octopus Leg

This was definitely a surprise. Aside it from having a small spot of sriracha sauce on top that gave it a little kick... i did NOT expect the octopus to be so soft and tender. Granted i dont think i've had raw octopus, especially served like this but oh man ! 

#8 - Fresh Live Sweet Shrimp with Black Tobiko and Uni + Deep Fried Head

The head was deep fried. Fried pretty well. Most of it was edible, except some thicker, harder areas. The sweet shrimp itself was big. Meat texture was firm. Slightly naturally sweet. 

#9 - Fresh Live Santa Barbara Sea Urchin topped with a raw Quail Egg & Ikura on a bed of mixed seaweed brown rice

LARGE & FAT (no joke !) pieces of sea urchin placed on top of the bed of mixed seaweed with brown rice (and other things) with a raw quail egg on top with some Ikura. The sea urchin was SUPER creamy. Mixing in the quail egg and ikura. Taking a small piece of the sea urchin and everything else. What a orchestra of flavors and textures. so delicious ! add a little fresh wasabi for even better experience !  i think this is less than $20 ala carte too ! what a deal, even normally ! 

#10 - Fresh Blue Fin Tuna/Chu-Toro/O-toro from Spain Nigiri Trio 

Made into nigiri. Chef used his special homemade soy sauce on the tuna as well ! Best blue fin tuna i've ever eaten. Very slight metallic taste. Super tender and flavorful. Chu-toro was a perfect balance of meat and fat. Melts in your mouth. O-toro (was a little disappointing due to the pieces of chewy parts (tendons?) which req' the chef to slice and arrange it differently). Super fatty. Would have liked the chef to quickly torch the top to bring out the aroma and flavor of the fat even more. 

#11 - Fresh Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna with Fried Onions

Sliced tuna. Add a few onions to the middle, on top of the sliced chili, wrap it around and enjoy. plethora of flavors on top of the nice sauce it was sitting in. Chili adds a little small kick to it all

#12 - Torch Seared Wagyu Beef with Uni, Ikura, and chopped Shallots

Super tender! Roll it around to ""encase"" the uni and ikura. Opposite side of beef still raw. variation of beef tataki. 

#13 - Fresh Kohada (Spotted Sardine) 

First time trying kohada ! always wanted to try ! strong flavor with a little sourness (similar to mackerel) 

#14 - Fresh Australian Ocean Trout and New Zealand King Salmon

Trout tastes crisper, less fatty than salmon. Both orange meat. Simple and clean. 

#15 - Fresh Blue Fin O-Toro Sashimi

THAT MARBLING ! Super tender. A5 Wagyu of the Sea. 

#16 - Unagi topped with avocado and bonito flakes

Simple but delicious unagi nigiri

#17 - Green Tea Ice Cream

This is the third time that we're been to this sushi joint, but it's never disappointed us. (Sorry, there are no duplicate food porn photo. Find out for yourself)
We are here for Father's day. As many other guests, why are we keep coming back for another great time, because the owner aka sushi chef who took great pride in their work to provide exceptional service.
Let's get down to the food. Every dish that we ordered was beautiful craft with delicious taste of freshness. From salmon skin salad, soft shell crab, or baked mussels are on point. I promised you that.
It is a holiday, we know they are busy, but our chef took something a little personal to compliment every guest with rice cake and grilled hamachi, to me it is an appreciation. That's something none other restaurant out there offer. Arigato Eric San.
We're always come here for nigiri (sushi) to taste the freshness texture of the fish, because they have the variety from fishes shipped in daily from different continents of the world. Make sure you enjoyed them with fresh wasabi (look at their pictures for proof). We're not stopped there of what's on the menu. Look out for that black board on the wall of the specials that they offered. It's not only something that the chef wanted you to try, but they want to represent their culture of the Japanese cuisine that they can offer you for an adventure. 
Enough said, go experience for yourself.

Lastly, there was hair hanging from an electrical fixture on the wall next to me and it was generally unclean. I am so disappointed.

My guy and I met up with some Yelp buddies here for dinner last night and I'd say that it's truly as good as everyone says. I thought there was only one thing it lacked- speedy service. 

Fatty Tuna Sashimi (Toro): delicious! Absolutely melt in your mouth awesomeness. 

Tempura Dinner: very tasty, tempura was exactly what you'd expect but in a larger portion. Miso soup was good, rice was dry but I didn't plan on eating it anyway. Salad was alright. 

Yellowtail Nigiri: we had 2 orders (4 pieces) on the same plate. On our first couple pieces, the rice was very strong and wet. We waited a while and ate the other two, and the rice seemed drier and less intense. I don't know what happened here honestly. 

Taste better than your ex-girlfriend roll: pretty good. A little too overpowering on the cream cheese end but the tuna inside was really good. 

Yellowtail roll: very little fish inside. Mostly rice. A bit disappointing. Maybe try the handrolls next time? 

I think Jason had ordered more food, but I can't recall. He's still looking to try the blue fin here so hopefully we get another opportunity soon.

1702441,2014-05-22,2,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"With the high reviews I really wanted to love this place. I did and I kept coming back hoping things would change with the customer service and wait time for food but it never did. See the end of my review for why. 

The first time we came for happy hour and got huge slices of fish, very generous. We then went back again and this time the fish slices were literally cut in half the size it was the first time, service was sllllllooooowww and we had to ask for them to check on things, ask for water refills, but my main gripe was that the fish slice reduced in half. I would appreciate them keeping things fairly consistent if it's large slices or small, either way I know what I would get. 

I do like the quality of the fish and so I would always try to convince my hubby to come back and each time I literally had to convince my husband that things would get better in terms of the wait time for food. Sometimes we just don't have 2 1/2 -3 hours to wait for our food. 

We came here once on a major holiday and once on my birthday so that shows you how much I really liked their fish but I started to feel like I was just being hopeful by keep coming back, hoping things would get better. We also came about 5 other times. 

The last visit was my most memorable in a bad way. We ordered tuna (regular) on the first order and had a conversation with our waitress and she told us how blue fin tuna was much better and we should get it. We said we would think about it. She said if you order all of our different types of tunas and have them side by side and compare taste you would notice the difference. We then later added in blue fin tuna (with a different waitress because ours was too busy to talk to us for about the 10 minutes we tried flagging her down). The regular tuna arrived at the table. We were hoping to get them together but after waiting and waiting we never got the blue fin, so we just ate that first tuna (regular).  More waiting and waiting and got some other orders, we got another plate of tuna. It looked exactly the same as the first. But what do we know, maybe it was different.  It tasted the same as the first. We were confused. We asked our waitress why it tasted exactly the same (when she claimed they tasted different) and she went to go check on it and after some long conversations with the sushi chef and waitresses she came back and said that I had ordered another order of regular tuna. I said no we ordered the blue fin tuna per your suggestion. We weren't impressed with the regular tuna and that is why we ordered the blue fin. She kept insisting that I ordered the regular and I kept insisting I did not, because that is true. This went on with her talking about it with Eric the sushi chef/Owner? and the 2 waitresses involved. It started to get uncomfortable for me watching it all. She then comes back and says if you want to order it, it's past the happy hour time but we can offer it at the happy hour price. Ummmm, no thanks. I already ordered it before (an hour ago), we are done eating, already spent over $100, and so over it at this point. Why not just bring us the correct tuna that I ordered??? Especially since they know us by face, Eric even came over and said he recognized us when I mentioned that we have been here many times. 

It just upset me that they made such a BIG deal about it, instead of just giving me what I ordered, the waitress insisted I was WRONG and made it known, making for a really awkward ""date night"" with my husband. It was also the waitress that kept saying there is nothing she can do, it's not her restaurant and she is sorry but that is the decision. She kept apologizing for what happened, but like I said we were done eating and just ready to go, not wanting to argue over fish. 

The owner could see us talking and he finally came over long after we had already been talking about this for an extended period of time which I just wanted wanted to drop it at this point. I expect more from a place with high reviews and wish he would have taken the matter into his hands from the start once he realized there was a problem. In the end he removed the second order of regular tuna and made it seem like he was accommodating us. It was the right thing to do, but we still never got the blue fin tuna we ordered. To each his own and he is the owner, if he feels this is how to treat regular customers, that is his choice. Unfortunately after coming here regularly for about a year, we decided that we want to feel a little more appreciated as customers. I think the problem could have been fixed quickly even if the waitress did not admit it was her fault instead of dragging it out and making for an uncomfortable dining out experience. 

The fish is 4 stars (5 stars taste, 4 stars size of nigiri). 
The customer service to me is 0 stars.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,8,1,3,_6LNEyIw6CifHFIFF87eLA

High quality fresh affordable sushi.  Boy I wish they would do an AYCE, but I like the emphasize on the little details that highlighting the fresh fish and tempt your eyes and belly. You cannot get this quality with AYCE.

If they have TORO you must get it,  3 decent sized thick rectangles of melt in your mouth tuna for about 10 bucks...What is not to love? 

Live Uni! Hello, LIVE UNI!   Why of course, I will have that!  Uni is served on a bed of rice with a nice quail egg and tobiko on top. It is to die for.  Again I don't really eat rice, but OK I will when it is under uni, quail egg and tobiko!

Ok if live uni does suit you, maybe live shrimp, or live clam, or live scallop?  Do it! Get something you never had before...this is the place and I guarantee you will be blown away. It was totally worth the $18.00 experience...they show you your uni and clean it up and design it into an artful edible pleasure...see  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?select=F8LPnzDPYUqPdEdDbaa_TQ#F8LPnzDPYUqPdEdDbaa_TQ

For sushi connoisseurs that appreciate quality nigiri over rolls covered in sauce, i really recommend the kinmedai and the kohada here. It reminded me of my years in Tokyo eating at Tsukiji.

Unfortunately they did not have blue fin tuna in stock because the quality was not up to their standards.  Just to hear that they send back sub standard fish is refreshing to hear.  Too many times have i seen awful qualities of fish being served to other patrons at other sushi bars.  I will definately return to taste the blue fin.

Now, the pancake appetizer, in conjunction with a nice frosty Sapporo, always sets an auspicious tone for the rest of my meal to come.  Which brings me to my next point....

The fish!  They have a variety of specialty/fusion rolls (some of which have pretty amusing names..).   To be honest, I have yet to come across a roll that I don't like.  They're all delicious, fresh, and melt in your mouth!   I practically have to fight my boyfriend for the last piece every time.

They also have specials during lunch (who doesn't love lunch specials?!).  Their teriyaki beef is really good,  and I usually don't ever order teriyaki.
Great service too.  Some of the more complex rolls are a bit pricey (still very affordable though).  However, you have to pay for good quality, and for as many times as I've been here,  the quality of the fish is always great.  This will be one of my go-to sushi spots when I'm in town.",TxWBHR4WE4BmIRtlgFYaWg,1,0,4,tek5f5ggat2zUILCSWF4Xg

The severs need to work on service. Not pleased with the service. They had 2 servers with 3 tables at most. Also went 30 min without water. Asking for things was never done. 

Not too loud but you can hear the music of the cooks in the back. Sorry if i want to hear shake your butt i would be at a club. Not a sushi place.

Well i will not be coming here again. I would have given half star if possible. Food never came out that was ordered. Orders was not brought out even after server verified the order before she left the table.

Bad birthday experince for my father.  The sushi isn't even worth it have a lot of better places for sushi. The one good thing here is the fresh uni.

It was not even busy today and they had 2 servers.

Yummy Sushi just slayed it last night with their 21 piece sashimi plate, and even more impressively their spicy bluefin tuna roll. the fish tastes as fresh as it gets, supplemented with a beautiful edge of acidity from the sashimi sitting on various slices of fruit (lemon / lime). it was an excellent array of fish (a couple I have never had before, and names that completely escape me), and it was a selection that needed to be savored. after finishing the sashimi, I was looking for some dessert. just so happens they had that spicy bluefin tuna roll that sounded perfect. wow. i mean, I can't wait to go back and get another take at it. flavors abundant, and topped off with tempura fried onion, plated over a sauce that brought both sweet and salty. absolutely fantastic in a whole. all of this was paired with Bride of the Fox sake, which was light and dry, with subtle tasting notes of cacao. service was solid and attentive, sushi chefs additionally were checking in on the flavors and satisfaction. i do wish they had a bit more ambiance with their bright lighting (perhaps a dimmer switch), but other than that no complaints. thanks Yummy for bringing your A game. i look forward to the omakase one of these days coming up.",F1Uh15zbjmrf3DhZJYB27g,0,0,5,lrdnlpnol2nIIGvv6FZ6Pw

1865217,2014-04-22,2,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"This is not the place to get rolls. Discovered that the hard way, despite reading so many reviews here that focused on the fresh nigiri and sashimi. I'll have to come back for the positive experience.

Ordered take out using their website menu: seaweed salad, cherry blossom roll, paradise roll. Didn't see many rolls with salmon, and many contained tempura. Made my selection difficult, but they get a lot of reviews praising their rolls, so I figured I was safe.

Inside of restaurant is kind of divey with a large bar, which I like. Service was polite and friendly from the ladies at the counter. Three sushi chefs were present and busy when I was picking up.

Got home to the messy cherry blossom roll. Confession: I love sushi, but I've never had a round roll like this. Verdict: not my thing. Too reminiscent of crab salad and avocado from a country club or buffet, little to no similarity to sushi. Wish this had been noted more clearly on the menu. Or at all.
t was the Paradise roll, which sounded adventurous. In my haste to find a roll with salmon, I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that there was tempura shrimp AND (way too much) cream cheese AND (sweet) coconut in this roll. Verdict: again, not my thing. Very sweet and creamy roll, bearing little to no similarity to sushi. The sweetness and the cheese covered up any fish taste.
Seaweed salad was flavored appropriately but dismally small: whoever packed my order accidentally put the salad in the lid rather than the bottom of the container, and space was limited.

Disappointed to have a negative experience at a place so many friends and Elites love and have reviewed favorably.  Overall, the rolls themselves are TOO Americanized, to the point that proportions of flavors are off and they're no longer sushi. I'll have to revisit and order exclusively off the fresh sashimi and nigiri specials next time for a separate review.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,4,2,fGrd7DYDnlAFwmjDTgj5xg

Two caveats: 
1. Since there is no all you can eat option, you will run up a tap, especially if you are drinking and/or hungry or if you are into more exotic items. 
2. Service can be slow. The chefs focus on preparing each roll with care (rather than simply stamping them out). This means the rolls are tastier, but take longer to make. If you are hungry- grab a kitchen appetizer or come in during off- peak times.

Sushi places have always been for me a measure of better or worse of fundamentally the same tastes.  But this place... this place offered flavors that I have never experienced before, and I don't know how to describe them, but they were incredible.  And the presentations were works of art.  My wife's vegetable roll had four distinct textures.  It was outstanding because of how it felt!  

I had live shrimp for the fist time.  For those of you who don't know, it's live until they fry the head in tempura batter and serve you the tail raw.  Now, I don't know what was in that dipping sauce, but when I tasted it from the serving bowl, it knocked my socks off, like sipping vinegar only smooth and addicting with a flavor that soaks the inside of your head and makes you screw your eyes up as acidic things do.

1932073,2016-10-17,4,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"I base this review solely on the bento and other dishes.  I dont like to review sushi because I am very picky and its not fair. 

This place had ""grill"" in the name so i thought they might care about more than mass sushi but then again, they had two business names at the same address. Not sure how that works. 

On to the food.. the box was advertised as teriyaki beef.  It turned out to be a very small portion of bulgoki with burnt teriyaki sauce poured over it. The burnt teriyaki sauce was hard to handle but at least it was dialuted by the horrible salad dressing they over poured on my tray making it more of a bento soup kinda thing.

korean owned and operated japanese resteraunt is the norm but cheese pajun? Really? Sesame oil and red pepper flake for dipping Kaarage? No thanks. 

BTW, green tea isnt served in a coffee cup but i guess thats what I get it after asking for a pot of tea three times. You also don't used julienned cucumbers for KappaMaki. People order cucumber because they enjoy them and want to taste and have some crunch. 
 
The sushi rice is way to wet. If I pick up sushi and wet rice stays on the plate, then you are over doing it. 

Lastly, if a resteraunt cant do items on the menu then they should  take them off or advertise them as daily.  I drove here because they advertised Hamachi Kama as an appearizer and then to not even have it at all. That was the only reason I came here. If they atleast had it I would have not left a review at all.",yKAIxV3KCxBKK5ezsry_0Q,1,1,1,hbY1QxbeNakcCAVBT7ul5A

2015141,2016-02-08,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"I've been to Yummy sushi three times.

The first time was because it was a holiday and btw, they do not honor any specials or anything like that on holidays.  Full price.  Okay, fine.  Duly noted - it's a bait and switch on holidays, since you're limited on options since everything is closed, we are going to gouge you. Cool.

The second time was with a friend and we sat at the sushi bar.  I spoke some Korean and Japanese to the staff, which was fun buuuut hot tea and water took forever to get refilled.  Our edamame took FOREVER and took longer than our sushi! 

So now the most recent time, and the reason for this review:

I went in with a friend.  We had a very polite, professional young man who was our server.  I recommended the place to my friend because we were tight on time and I consider the sushi at Yummy Sushi to be good for AMERICAN sushi restaurants. (Although a few places closer to Spring Mountain are a step up - but anyway...)

We sit, order drinks, and I notice there is a check in feature - XX amount of money off of a purchase of a certain amount or more.  I turn to the server and joke that, ""I doubt we'll hit this, but I""ll keep it in mind.""  He laughs nervously and goes to the back to check on the discount.  Apologetically, he comes back and states: ""I'm sorry, but we don't honor it any more.  Something that has to do with Yelp not taking it down despite the fact that we've asked them."" 

Me: ""Oh.  Okay.  That's strange, I've never heard of that, but it's cool.

Him: ""I feel bad, though, let me go check again.""  So he goes back and asked the owner AGAIN.  

So here's my issue: At this point, the owner should have come out and apologized HIMSELF. Not the waiter, who was doing his best to try and deal with the curveball.  To clarify: I wasn't counting on this check in offer as I stated I didn't think we would be hitting the minimum for it, but I don't like how it was handled at all.  That's an awkward situation that the server should have not had to deal with, especially since it was his first time with that.  

But here's my BIGGER issue and why I gave this place two stars:

We let that go and order.  Sushi is fine.  Nothing incredible, just good standard sushi. 

While we are eating, I'm listening to one of the sushi chefs go off to a customer - ranting about ANOTHER customer.  In the middle of the restaurant.  About fifteen feet away from us, (So this could be heard by others in there.)  He was standing in front of the sushi bar, going on and on about a vegetarian who came in and asked if they could do vegetarian rolls and he was mocking her.  Okay, yes, going to a Sushi restaurant and asking for Vegetarian Sushi is extremely limited.  But openly complaining about your customers in the middle of the restaurant?? So unprofessional.  Not cool.  Very disappointed in this.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,4,1,2,lGJnLQszS9Nn6DyNcFAbJw

I wasn't very hungry since I had already eaten, but since I had never tried Yummy's, I figured I could make a little bit of room in my belly. The cucumber salad had a different taste than what I'm used to but it was still good, the salad does not come with crab automatically, you have to ask for some, so I will remember that for next time. There is an additional charge ($5) for crab or shrimp, whichever you'd prefer. The rolls were both very good. I'm also not really a fan of baked rolls but these were good, specially the Japanese lasagna. I'm not really a big fan of having cream cheese in rolls since most places tend to make the cream cheese taste too overpowering, but not here, the balance was perfect!

The fish is ordered regionally and the owner tracks schools of fish all over the oceans to make sure it is as fresh as possible.  The quality cannot be beat.

Specifically, the super white tuna and Cajun albacore are must-orders for me.  I have been playing with their rolls which tend more towards traditional ones with a few creative off-shoots for the adventurous sushi goer.

Even the non-sushi options on the menu are great and you should feel comfortable to bring someone who doesn't enjoy sushi here.  The tempura, teriyaki and other typical Japanese items are high quality.  

This is not an AYCE spot.  The fish is high quality and not for the mass-ordering crowd that comes with AYCE. 

Even as I write this review, the owner came up to us to make sure everything is great before bussing our table and sweeping the restaurant.  It is that care and attention to details that I love so much about Yummy sushi.

On a $100+ bill, the $6.50 is more important to them than the customer telling them that one of the items was bitter and distasteful. Sad that the money is more important than if the customer continued to consume something bad and ultimately getting food poisoning?

The first time I ordered lunch from here my friend from work came with me to pick it up.  It wasn't quite ready yet, so they offered us a seat at the sushi bar to wait.  They brought out water and complimentary korokke (Japanese Croquette; fried potato cake), which the absolutely did NOT have to do!

And let me tell you, their korokke is delicious.  I'm drooling a little as I type.

We finished up the korokke just as our ordered was presented to us.  Huzzah!  Took it back to the office, opened it up and there was a SUPER CUTE picture of edamame drawn on the edamame box.  OK so I'm a sucker for kawaii things.  But it was really nice of them.

The food...oh man, the food.  Everything was great.  The salad was crisp with a robust Japanese dressing, the miso soup was perfectly seasoned and accompanied by well-textured tofu cubes and the California Roll... albeit not ""real"" sushi, was mighty tasty and had very, very fresh avocado.

The first lunch I tried the chicken katsu - the breading is spot-on.  Their tonkatsu sauce is full-bodied with all the right flavors, so the two paired together make it heavenly.

The second lunch I had the teriyaki eel - also very, very delicious; dare I say it... Yummy.

Staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is just too cute with its cozy feeling and traditional Japanese decor.  May not be great for large parties, but will always be great in my heart.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,2,3,5,m5Ld6wpl1AfMdI5dWEp1_A

2302716,2014-01-12,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"First time visiting this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend.  Small, typical strip-mall location didn't bother me (I've found some of the best places tucked obscurely away) but they left the door wide ajar (for fresh air?) and someone nearby was smoking a cigar, so it wafted in. Odd they didn't notice and shut the door.  

Sat the the sushi bar, no greeting was called as you usually get, but no big deal.  Ordered a large hot sake for now and a beer with my meal.  This confused the hell out of the waitress, who couldn't fathom how to make that work.  When she brought the sake, she asked again if I wanted the beer now, so I said okay to help her out.  The sake was tepid, not hot, and not full.  

Usually I order as I go but the sushi chef had no interaction with me other than to hand over the welcome plate with ginger, wasabi, and a small cuke taster (nice).  So I resigned to pick everything from the paper sheet, and the happy hour thing was confusing, but I managed.  I turned it in to the waitress and tucked back into my lukewarm sake.  

At that time I noticed a man at the register who was trying to place an order To go.  The waitresses were having some issue understanding and entering, and suddenly the whole restaurant ground to a halt.  The chefs were all watching the girls, all 3 girls were intently focused on the computer (with my order dangling forgotten in one hand) and the client was making comment that he might in fact still be hungry by the time they figured it out and he got his food.  

At this point the chef sees me starring at him in a hungry way and asks what I ordered.  I couldnt' remember everything, just a few, but gave him the clam miso soup and the salmon sushi.  He whipped up the salmon, and although the pale color was suspect of farmed quality, the portion was nice and not on a tombstone-sized piece of rice.  However, he painted it with a sauce I didn't ask for, claiming it helped enhance the fish.  I find that totally out of character, and worried it was more to mask a low-quality cut.  It tasted okay and I'm still here.

After my order finally was entered at the computer and printed to the chef, he managed to do the rest.  However, the clam miso and garlic edamame was coming from the back kitchen, which was very sadly inept.  Both items finally arrived after I had eaten all the sushi items, so I got appetizers last.  The clam miso was good and four littlenecks in the shell were a nice variety, but the edamame was crazy - there was literally a half cup of diced (from a jar) garlic sauteed in peanut oil and tossed/dumped onto the beans.  It was tasty at first, but just WAY too much used.  Garlic is such a strong agent, it isnt needed in giant gobs...it just about killed the dish and of course anyone who stood within 5 feet of me the next day.

Meanwhile, the couple's dirty plates to my left who had been gone awhile were still there when another couple arrived; there was almost no bussing done the whole time I was there.  They nicely shoved the dirty plates in my direction to the empty chair between us, and they too couldn't manage to get their drinks, or sushi, in a timely fashion.  I asked if they had been here before, and she said yes but didnt know why this time everything was so SLOW.  Everyone at the bar was being asked by the chef what their order was they had given the waitress; perhaps they need a new procedure.

I counted at the height of business, 9 people at the sushi bar and maybe 12 in the restaurant.  There were 3 sushi chefs, two more people visible in the prep kitchen, and 2 or 3 servers on the floor.  Nobody should have had to wait for anything, much less a clean place to sit down.  They all seemed to be SCRAMBLING but I couldnt figure out why....I've seen 2 chefs at a good busy restaurant handle everything plus To Go orders no problem.  These guys have issues.

I don't care if you serve exotic, rare pricey fish to your special customers, or cut cooked rolls to the newbie, if you're going to run a restaurant (and I'm in the industry) you need to make sure service is near-perfect.  I would have tried more items, stayed longer, and maybe visited again if the service and customer attention had been prioritized, but judging from other reviews and others that night who were having the same experience with poor service, I'll think I'll spare myself another trip here.",BaAxpYpCqDRShhUBEvLumw,0,0,2,Oz-ku1w7ZsSy6U9anSy-9Q

Reason why Kevin duke and just another yelper that secret spot is out. Mahalo for letting rest of us yelpers in.

It been long time since went for sushi a la carte. AYCE is just the way too go get little bit of everything and keep going until one tummy is happy in life. Yummy talk about Sushi change up in life!!! Sometimes in life or food not about quantity but quality. OMG! Everything the quality was unreal. The sushi chef Eric showing us some of the fish just got in since was tuesday. He had this amazing looking needlefish or sayari. I never had before but said that few times. They have boards with different fish gets in every week everyone talks about the uni. Unfortunately they did not have it. =( The sayari sashimi style knowing literally cut fresh off the bone. It served with quail egg mixed together was perfect balance. It same came too sweet shrimp. Deep fry the head good stuff dipped in the sauce. Sayari bones too! Every sushi was amazing flavors, depth, and stuff like scallops never had in sushi restaurant. Scallops that blew my mind! Fresh Oysters combine with the sauce like slurp of sea heaven. Every sushi was more and more amazing. We ended it with american kobe beef roll that by far best speciality rolls EVER! Me more about the nigiri style sushi. It true sushi for me all about the quality of the fish and rice. Sushi in its truest form. Desserts we had the deep fried plum and black sesame seed ice cream. The plum had much more flavor then I could ever imagine. The crispy goodness outside mixed with the plum ice cream very nice. The black sesame seed honestly not fan of. I think that sesame seed in ice cream not meant too be just weird flavor. 

The whole time thinking of Jiro ""dreams of sushi"".  I did have one roll. The whole presentation of just one nigiri, few course of sashimi style fish, and the presentations was truly artwork. Too the little details on the oysters it christmas assortment of toppings, sweet shrimp looked like gold flakes on top, sayari tight presentation with the head standing straight up and the quail egg placed perfect on top of the sashimi fish, and go on and on. Tell the passion sushi chef Eric has in every piece of fish. It really refreshing style too see non AYCE cares about the finer details. Once again thanks too Kevin the sushi chef Eric hooked us up with bottle of sake. Yay.

It is really nice to walk away from a sushi meal without feeling like your belly is about to explode from every homeward-bound pothole (e.g. the all-you-can-eat sushi experience) and Yummy Grill is the perfect place to pare back to sushi basics, simply ordering one or two selections at a time. Enjoying each bite and discussing the flavors with Chef Eric and his crew of skilled fish-slicers makes for a very civilized and satisfying meal.

Love the strength of the iced green tea here. And the fish specials on the whiteboard are truly special.

On our most recent visit we ordered:
Tuna poki (chopped tuna, red onion, seaweed salad, sesame oil, soy sauce, green onion, and masago) This was my wife's favorite. It had a nice balance of flavors.

Uni (sea urchin) Very good and super fresh.

Spider man (spicy tuna, soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, topped with eel, spicy yum yum, eel sauce and scallion) Pretty good but not as tasty as I had hoped. 

Arizona roll (spicy yellowtail, scallion, cucumber topped with yellowtail, avocado, ponzu sauce and green onion). Good but probably not good enough to order again.

Crazy jalapeño (deep fried jalapeño, cream cheese, spicy tuna, and chef's special sauce) Pretty tasty and something I would order again.

We found a piece of plastic wrap on the Arizona roll so they offered us each a scoop of ice cream and the owner came over and apologized.

And while those are certainly much classier places with wonderful ambiance, the quality of the product is not better and any of them.

You will be hard-pressed to find a place with more live options.  Fans of uni are in heaven here!

We ordered two rolls off the happy hour menu and out comes one roll. I asked the server when the 2nd roll was coming out but she nonchalantly informed me that their happy hour rolls are only 4 pieces. WHAT.... A .....SCAM... I was almost laughing when she said their rolls are half the size during happy hour. We also ordered two a la carte items off the menu and both were pretty bad. The fried noodles with chicken is supposed to be like a yakisoba. The noodles were comparable to the instant type you buy at the grocery store, they just added some pieces of chicken and veggies to it. The last dish we ordered was chicken cutlet. This dish came out so late that I ended up eating it by myself because my girlfriend finished eating her noodle dish and her half rolls. The place is dingy and the tables need to be replaced. I want to give one star but I don't want to be that harsh. I wont be coming back and I have no idea why there is no good restaurants in the northwest side of town.

There's no way I can fully describe the attention to detail, passion for all things fresh and fabulous that Chef Eric, Sam and crew impart into all they present. Don't overlook them because they are in a nondescript strip mall in Summahood. Ish gets real here. 

Really have lost count of the number of people I've dragged with, but perhaps my friend Tat (who lived in Japan for three years) being so moved after tasting the chu toro sashimi she exclaimed: ""Eric, that is the best bite of fish I've ever had!"" demonstrates most what to expect. Seriously people, they have the finest quality fish flown in from far and wide twice a week. The white board outside and at the bar lists the ""market price/live"" items; I've never paid more than $18 for any: a steal! 

The Omakase is an amazing way to eat here: each course is progressing toward a crescendo that will knock your socks off. Again, super reasonable, paced expertly with sake/soju pairings available. You'd be hard pressed to find better dishes anywhere.

There's also plenty for the landlubber to dig into: Mom proclaims the chicken Teryaki combo meal (with a fork, please :) to be the bees knees. Friends who are crazy for yum yum sauce and baked rolls dig them, too. 

Need more incentive? Happy hour daily 3-6PM & 10-closing (except Saturdays) will make you a believer and save you $$$. 

My favorite menu items: chu and o toro, bluefin, live scallop, live lobster, live uni, giant clam, jinkemedai; sometimes I just ask for Eric's choice. The fresh ground wasabi is off the hook and the pickled version is a great twist. I Never pour soy sauce (Eric makes his own aged shoyu=I die!) or use the wasabi paste=each piece is perfect as served. 

Just go, sit at the bar, enjoy the art created for you and the passionate people presenting it. You're welcome.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,13,7,5,rqVsLBZaqLgxHiU4hPu3vw
2641313,2014-04-23,2,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"Late night happy hour is where it's at 10pm-close! Great affordable deals! 

We are from California and we have a huge selection of sushi restaurants to select from.  So as picky as we are, we came here with high expectations and yummy grill met our expectations! 

This place is definitely a quality sushi and nigiri restaurant. The fish was very fresh and handled with extreme precision and care. We enjoyed everything we ordered from the happy hour menu, but my favorite has to be the fish! They were all just so buttery and sweet! 

Complimentary: 
Korean fried vegetable pancake
Imitation crab and pickled cucumber salad

Salmon nigiri (2 orders - 4 pieces) 
So fresh and buttery. Very sweet. 

Halibut nigiri  (1 order - 2 pieces)
Great firm texture and mouth feel. Very fresh!

Yellowtail nigiri (1 order - 2 pieces)
They brushed on a homemade seaweed soy sauce which is not overpowering at all. It is meant to be eaten as-is and not with any soy or wasabi! It really enhanced the yellowtail's flavor. 

King salmon nigiri (1 order - 2 pieces)
This was the evening's fresh fish of the day special. It looks more white than pink compared to regular salmon. It was very sweet and the texture was more buttery than regular salmon- I didn't think that was possible! It melted in my mouth. 

Baked CA roll (1 order - 4 pieces)
The simple comfort classic with yum yum sauce and baked! It was good, but filling! 

Philly roll (1 order - 4 pieces)
It was good, simple and fresh

Miso soup (1 order)
Very quality miso soup! Not too salty, just right. Came out hot and satisfying. 

AMA ebi (sweet shrimp with fried heads) (1 order - 2 pieces with 2 fried heads) 
The presentation on this baby made me very happy! Little edible sprouts and flowers topped the sweet shrimp. I enjoyed them along with the fried crispy shrimp heads as well. 

Spicy scallop (1 order - 4 pieces)
This was my least favorite of everything we ate. They used imitation crab and I think tiny fried bits of scallop? It tasted more like imitation crab and fried tempura bits with mayo. Not the best. It didn't come out the way we envisioned. 

Everything we ordered was under $30! Great deal for fresh fish for 2 people, we were completely satisfied.

2647748,2017-01-17,7,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"First off the waitress CeCe who is Filipino is completely RUDE!! I wanted to order the lunch special and she told me that I couldn't because it was a holiday. That would've been nice if it was told to me first after we were sitting there for 10 minutes. I asked to order a shrimp tempura appetizer. I'm Japanese and I said ""tempura"" the correct way. She in a condescending tone said you mean shrimp ""Tempura"" (Tem pooh rah) how usually a white person would, not knowing the language, like she was correcting me! Even my friend who was with me and is half Filipino found it rude. Then I asked how big the sashimi salad was, she came back after asking the chef and said big. When I said exactly what is big? She rolled her eyes and walked off to go ask again. 

At this point, I ask to speak with a manager. She says to me, no manager is working but you can talk to my co worker. How is nobody in charge working? What if something happens? What's the point in that? I did talk to the co worker and I told him I no longer want her as a server. So he served us. He was actually very nice!! 

I also want to note that the girl at the table in front of me had to get up and go to the bar herself to get a refill on water. That table did not look happy. The waiter kept apologizing profusely. 

Then, after everything comes out, guess what is missing? My shrimp ""tempura""! My friend is already done eating. At this point, I'm fed up! I walk over  to the sushi bar and ask the sushi chefs if there is someone working I can talk to because I'm over this! They tell me the owner is working and will get him! Wtf?!! The owner is there?!!

The owner comes out and he's Korean. It also took him forever to come out. It made us think he must not really care what is happening. When I explain what happened, and told him about the tempura he gave me a look like he also didn't understand why I was saying tempura like how it's supposed to be said in the Japanese way! Tempura is Japanese!!! And you own a Japanese restaurant!!! Anyway he eventually did comp our meals, which I did appreciate but I will never return. They also gave us the shrimp tempura to go. 

When I got home and looked at the shrimp, they were all very thin and not what you would expect from a 4 star sushi restaurant. The lid from the sauce also came off because of the heat from the shrimp so it was drenched. 

The food is decent (not 4 star yelp worthy) but honestly, it seems like from these reviews they really need to work on their customer service skills. 

Do yourselves a favor and skip trying to get sushi in Summerlin! It seems like the only good sushi is in the casinos. 

Since I can't respond to the owner's comment, at no point did we ever curse out the waiter or make fun of her!!!!! And if we did, then why would I be asking to speak with a manger or owner? Nor did she ever tell us that there was no lunch specials to begin with! Just look at the other yelp reviews based on the service here and you be the judge!  

He also just yelled at me on the phone when I called to tell him on the phone that we in no way cursed at her or made fun of her! He called me a racist because of my review and said we made fun of her. How is saying exactly what happened racist? She WAS correcting me on how to say it. That's like me going to a Filipino restaurant and trying to correct them. He actually said what does you being Japanese have to do with it? And apparently I'm also racist because I said he's Korean. He also said the server apologized twice to us. No she did not apologize at all! When I asked did he witness her apologizing, he yelled at me and said I trust my servers! Then do you believe she really didn't roll her eyes at me when I asked about the salad? And I'm glad this guy thinks it's ok that she did according to his reply. The guy server apologized to us for our shrimp not coming out. The owner is extremely unprofessional!!! The manager Ryan had to get on the phone and he is extremely professional and had to rectify the situation. 

You can look through reviews on yelp and see how unprofessional the owner is.",obmpwDltz0kixhkf1UKwCA,5,2,1,prDYCeC9UjtCKDIqvub7uA

THE MEAT: I should've pulled a Sienfeld and quit while I was ahead.  That has always been my problem... I don't know when to stop with a good thing it always gets me in trouble.  Everything was so fresh and so tasty we couldn't stop ordering.  The Dynamite and Pork Belly were exceptional (the tempura was average, while the mussels were a little tough).  The Nigiri was TO DIE FOR.  Ridiculously thick and long portions of fresh and oily-buttery pieces that eclipsed the rice and all sushi joints I have tasted so far.  I actually wished the pieces were smaller to fit my mouth!  My favorites were the Kanpachi and Bluefin Tuna.  I should've ordered Toro (which I expected to get in the chef's choice of sashimi, but unfortunately did not get. Sniff.).  The fried chicken appetizer was very light and tasty (my son loved it), and the fuji apple sake we ordered would make any non-serious sake drinker like me happy.  We were already full but decided to go for the 15pc chef's choice sashimi platter.  First they served us a platter with sushi, and it looked uhmazing, so I said well we could just ignore the rice, but they insisted to get the order right.  So they gave us a sashimi platter with different kinds of salmon, kanpachi, ruby snapper, super white tuna and scallop.  Sigh.  Chef Eric, what happened here?  The sashimi slices were very thin, not cool to the tongue and, well... not as awesome as the sushi served us.  What a let-down. This definitely should've been a 5 star rating if not for the depressing sashimi platter.  Will we go back? Only for the sushi and only during happy hour.  Or if I felt indulgent.

I'M STILL DIGESTING... My nearly 200 dollar bill for me, hubby and my 2yo who hardly ate.

Rolls- Yellowtail, Uni (topped with Ikura), Baked Cali roll
Nigiri- Cherry Trout
Other- Fresh Wasabi.  Chicken Teriyaki kid's meal with sundae.

I admit I grew envious of all the 5-star reviews that Yummy Sushi and affiliated Kame sushi have accumulated throughout the years.  The location being far up north has kept me away up until this month and I regret not living near this area now.  While I still would like to try the higher end Kame's tasting menu, no reservation for a family of four led us to an exceptional experience at Yummy nonetheless.  

The servers were very friendly, very attentive, and explained many previously new types of fish to me when asked.  Everything I ordered was fresh and a burst of flavor.  The japanese uni was nicely sweet, creamy, and worked well with the large salmon roe on top.   The cherry trout I ordered off their menu of specials on the wall was sweet and enjoyable.  The sashimi was amazing by itself, but the fresh wasabi put it over the top!

I repeat: Get an order of fresh wasabi!  (Unless, of course, you aren't a fan of it's spiciness/horseradish-ish taste.)   For those who do like wasabi, you'll never want the fake imitation stuff again.

Yummy Sushi was very kid friendly and their chicken teriyaki kid's meal provided so much value.  Practically a whole bento box of food with the addition of a ice cream sundae to my daughter's delight.

Highly recommend this sushi spot.  I know I will be coming back with friends to try their selection of ""live"" ingredients like live shrimp and live uni.  By far, on or near the top of my list of excellent sushi in Las Vegas.

  We were very impressed that our waitress knew the menu so well.  She was able to tell us where the fish came from and how the dishes were prepared. 

 My husband chose the tempura dinner and was very happy with his choice. It was crispy, hot, and the batter wasn't too heavy or greasy. 

 I had one of the combo box dinners that had salmon teriyaki, also some tempura, and sushi, rice, and salad.  All that plus the miso soup.  I was so stuffed that I had to take home leftovers.

Shortly after it was packed!   I would like to comment on the freshness of the fish... The best I have had in Las Vegas.  Thick pieces of sashimi we started with and then went with rolls.  At first I was disappointed because they didn't offer all you can eat but in the end it was way better.  The flavor satisfied my appetite I didn't feel the need to stuff my face.  I allowed my taste buds just to enjoy the flavor.  Food quality was amazing. Service was good very attentive... Never asked for a refill of water.  Best part was when we walked out we didn't smell like tempera.   My favorite was the rock and roll.  Give this place a try but go early to sit at the small sushi bar.

First thing I loved right off the bat was the free bottle of sake with yelp check in!! There was 7 of us, so of course they weren't going to give us 7 bottles. Our server said it's one per table, but was nice enough to give us 2 bottles:) 

It took a little long for our server to finally get our orders in, but we were all chatting to kill time. The menu was pretty extensive with multiple rolls, appetizers, hot food and nigiri. I may have gone a bit overboard with my order, but nonetheless it was still good and managed to finish it all. 

Giant clam nigiri:
Anthony M. convinced me to try it after he saw some hesitation in me. He had tried it before and said he'd rather have clams cooked. I tried it, and I completely agree with him. It wasn't horrible tasting, just wasn't used to it. Chewy and seafoody is how I would describe it. I could have done with out it. 

Toro (fatty tuna) nigiri:
OMG this was amazing. Buttery, smooth and melt in your mouth tuna!!!!!!! I would have ordered more if it weren't for the other rolls I got. I don't think I'll ever look at tuna the same way after this.

Cherry Blossom roll:
This wasnt a roll at all. Chopped up crab and soft shell crab covered with avocado and yum yum sauce. After a few bites I was over it. I never thought I'd say this about sushi, but I wanted it to have rice. I needed help finishing it.

Sex on the Beach roll:
This was good. I don't remember what was inside but it was topped with tuna and avocado. But after eating that toro, the tuna on top of this roll was subpar. 

This isn't an AYCE, so be mindful of what you order if you're watching for $. Mine was about $60. I had a good time with good company. Will definitely be back since it's close to work.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,2,4,L0SC2NYKF-GNlHtfKSLZXg

I think it was the whole judging a book by its cover thing because a place called Yummy most like isn't so yummy....but this place sooo proved me wrong and I am truly grateful for that. The quality and freshness of the fish is what really won me over. I usually don't order salmon because I can rarely find a place that has quality salmon that will melt in my mouth. Every piece of fish was perfect! I ordered some rolls with tuna, salmon, and some kinda white fish....all was just perfect. Then I had to have some nigiri sushi that was tako and the best fatty toro I think I ever had :-D I wanted more sushi but stupid me ordered a salad too :-/ Next time I will not be making that mistake! 

The best part about this place?? You get all this quality sushi for the same price you get at other sushi places :-D The bill can add up when you include market priced pieces in your meal but they truly are worth it. Plus get the fresh wasabi for the nigiri or rolls that you may want to add wasabi too.

For dessert, we shared a plate of mochi ice cream. Our waiter allowed us to choose 2 different flavors so we chose green tea and mango. Both very good and refreshing.

Talking about refreshing, after the miso soup, we were given a slice of sweet orange and that not only cleansed the palate, but it was cool and refreshing! Nice touch!

I've known chef Eric's passion for sushi for over a decade and he is still surpass my expectations all the time...graciously extending lunch specials until 4pm when a Happy Hour starts up. I appreciate that they are considerate of the various Vegas lifestyles and schedules. I love that you can order high-quality and hard to find Nigiri and Sashimi in the same place that you can get happy hour rolls...very thoughtful approach. For lunch I often order their sushi special with 6 pieces of fresh nigiri and choice of spicy tuna or California. One of my daughters appreciates the tempura roll...so nice to have such a variety at one place. You can try all of them yourself and in the process define your taste for Japanese Cuisine...who knows, maybe eventually decide to take it next door to Kame Omakase...at least that's my hope for you...just like my love led me from Yummy to Kame.

My girls are more venturous in trying new rolls...also providing my opportunity to try rolls I otherwise wouldn't. Today they got sweet heart roll with sauce on the side.  Sauce is rather sweet for the girls being teriyaki based sauce with spicy mayo sauce, so having them put it on the side was good thing for them.

The seafood roll was in the same container as my veggie rolls! I was pretty upset. I asked them why they would do that if i specified that I didn't eat fish/seafood.

What is the difference? If I don't like it and don't eat it, why put it with my food?? 

I brought the food home, opened the containers, and noticed... Only one place setting in the box... Great, one set of chopsticks!! Good job guys... 

The garlic edamame was awesome and my friend really enjoyed his sea food roll. The avocado roll was okay... I am not into super warm sushi... And the rolls were really warm...

Mind you, we are the only other patrons in the restaurant. Another 15 minutes later, our food STILL isn't here. Seriously? Waiting over half an hour for some sub-par bento boxes is ridiculous.

What we tried...
Nigiri:
Garlic tuna - great! 
Cajun albacore - awesome!
yellowtail and halibut
Rolls:
Vanessa roll - superb! 
Cajun albacore roll - good; preferred the nigiri
Ban Ban roll

If I had to choose only one to brag about, it's the Vanessa roll.  This had a delightfully nice balanced spicy tangy combination.  

We chose a table instead of the sushi bar.  Didn't get to meet the chefs.  Even so, beautiful work on the flavors.  Kind and considerate service.  When we specified no sesame seeds, they came back to advise the sauce is made with sesame flavor.  We're okay with flavor; not fond of the actual seeds.  Nice of them and careful.

The restaurant space is long and fitted - a pant leg of a pair of skinny jeans.  A group of four is perfect.  Any larger is cozying up, but they make it work.

We had the passion roll next and that was so-so. Not nuts about it.

Location: They locate at Lake Meat and Buffalo, away from the strip so come here on holidays would be great, not crazy busy. 
Food: I eat mostly sashimi. And this place has very fresh raw fish, sea urchin, and other kinds of seafood. So I believe their rolls would be great too.
If you are an Oyster's fan, this is the right place for you. They have 3 kinds of Oyster with the same very reasonable price ($3 each) including Shigoku oysters. 
I also tried their live lobster ($50 each and one is good for 2 people). Half of it made sashimi and the other half cooked in sea urchin sauce coming along with lobster miso soups. I was really impressed how good it was. 10 out of 10 for live lobster.
Besides, fish livers are something you should try too. They are served with masago on top and citrus sauce. 
And the last thing I want to mention is they have FRESH WASABI. I couldn't find it any where else as far as I know. It's not as strong as the regular wasabi. The taste of fresh is always better right? 
Service: We usually come there on weekend so they're always busy. However, we were seated within 5-10 minutes, food came out fast, our server stopped by every 5-10 minutes, and they are very friendly. This is a plus since sometime rude servers can make you lose your appetizer even though the foods are great.

All of the hot food I've ever had here has been great as well, especially the Bulgogi Beef and the green onion pancakes. Absolutely delicious!

Aside from the fact that Eric is a fantastic cook, he is a very warm and friendly person. I can't count the number of times that I've been having a meal up at the sushi bar and we've ended up talking for a solid hour or more about our lives and whatever sport happens to be playing on the television. He's also occasionally makes me a random roll for free to try out and none of these random dishes have ever been disappointing!

My friend and I came here and ordered several items. There's a standard menu that lists their appetizers, hot foods, and sushi, as well as a separate happy hour menu featuring discounted rolls. Additional items are also posted on the walls. 

Rolls - Tomo Devil, Come to Me, Dynamite roll. The Tomo Devil was my favorite because of its spiciness. The Dynamite roll was reminiscent a typical Dynamite served in a bowl. Even though the roll was good, I'd probably would order the bowl version. Come to Me was also tasty. The sauces on some of the rolls we ordered had a surprising citric flavor, which was a nice touch.

Sashimi - Blue Fin Tuna and Toro: Damn, these were good! So delicious and very FRESH! These can be ordered sashimi style or sushi, go with the sashimi.

Kanpachi with Serrano: This was my least favorite. The kanpachi wades in a spicy sauce with an unusual flavor that's difficult for me to compare it to something that I've had. Tiny slices of serrano peppers with dabs of sriracha are placed upon each slice of fish. To me, the kanpachi by itself would've been perfect, but I just wasn't feeling the other flavors. 

Dessert - Fried Green Tea Ice Cream: Both of us were already stuffed to the max, but we thought to end our dinner on a sweet note with a bowl of fried green tea ice cream. There are many flavors to choose from, such as black sesame seed and plum, and the usual vanilla and chocolate flavors.

Service - Make reservations. It tends to get busy around 6:00p.m. We arrived before then when service was prompt, but as the evening progressed we had to wait a little longer. However, waitresses didn't neglect us and attended to our table often.

Other - They have a stamp card system in place, woohoo!

Located in a strip mall two doors over from the Big 5 Sporting Goods store, and next to Jimmy Johns. It is easy to miss. 

It is said to be owned by a chef who mixes up the menu daily with fresh fish that are flown in from all over the world. Their menu is extensive. The place is small so you might want to make reservations for a big group.

We love the rolls that uses cucumber as a roll such as Johnny roll, Rock and Roll, and we also request to custom a roll and they make it so perfect. For appetizer, I tried Fried Scallop, Chicken Yakitori and I found their Coconut Tempura to be my favorite, really crispy and fresh.  Their House wine is tasty too.

Pros
- The food has been consistently very good all three times we have come.
- I love the intimacy. It's not an elegant intimacy. More like 'I found a secret garden', so nothing fancy. 
- Sushi rolls were really good. And the rolls have a good fish-to-rice ratio. not too much rice and the rolls aren't small.
- The kalbi(?) ribs are wonderful!
- Shannon & the kids really liked the Japanese Fried Chicken.

Cons
-The food is good, but it takes a while. We've eaten here three times & we have consistently needed to be patient. 
- The bar is not a full bar and only has beer & wine. I'm not a beer or wine guy. I like my Jack Daniels, so I drink water when I come here. 
- I really like brown rice with my sushi and the sushi resturants who do this have a special place in my heart. YummyG&S offers this, but it's an additional $2. Call me cheap, but I'm paying extra for brown rice.

We are fans and we will be back for sure. 400+ 4.5 star Yelp reviews can't steer you wrong.",EpD7gvvA7z0XhksxIqe9vg,0,0,4,EOYwh_qNd0x0hI9i-lPG5w

3600227,2015-06-19,10,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"The only way to go here is to FOCUS ON THE BOARD behind the sushi bar for some of the best seafood selections you'll ever feast on. Chef Eric prides himself on getting the highest quality seafood three times a week from places like Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Alaska, Boston, Santa Barbara, and Hawaii to name a few.

If you come here and grab a table, order up a few rolls, or a lunch combo, or even worse, get items to-go, I can't help you there...you're on your own SUCKA! If you're looking for quantity/AYCE, this is not the place...if you're looking to dine on some of the freshest seafood options, you can go to places on the strip, or even to Kabuto and spend an arm and a leg, and still leave hungry with a lighter wallet.

Chef Eric's Omakase is not only delicious and adventurous, you leave satisfied, and educated. He is not a ""turn and burn"" chef, but exactly the opposite. Just about every picture I've posted are edible creations of his skill, passion and talent that tastes as good as they look. Being friends with other sushi chefs in town, he knows what every one else is getting, and what he chooses is top tier stuff. If product isn't up to his standards, he'll send it back, so purveyors know Chef Eric VERY well.

This recent visit, Eric wowed us yet again with his creations, and here is what our   adventure consisted of:

LIVE MAINE LOBSTER TWO WAYS:
-Poached with Uni-Citrus Beurre Blanc
-Sashimi with assorted caviar
LIVE BOSTON SOFT SHELL CRAB
LIVE BOSTON SCALLOP SASHIMI
LIVE JAPANESE CONCH SASHIMI
SPICY ALBACORE WITH PONZU AND CRISPY ONIONS
ASSORTED NIGIRI:
Live Maine Lobster, Live Boston Scallop Fin, Live Boston Scallop, A5 Australian Wagyu, Inada, Shima-Aji, Halibut Fin, Japanese Snapper, Hamachi Belly, Aoyagi, Alaskan White King Salmon, Snow Crab, Live Mirugai, Anago, Unagi, and Toro Cheek.

What you want to spend, how much time you have, and what's fresh/in season are factors to look at when arranging your omakase adventure with Chef Eric. Its worth doing at least once, especially if you enjoy quality seafood without the absurd prices on The Las Vegas Strip.  ALOHA!!!

-Ban ban roll- YUMMY! Our favorite!! 
-DYNAMITE- omg deliciousness, 2nd runner up
-Kiss of fire- Good but not as good as other
-garlic tuna sashimi- good and fresh
-spicy albacore sashimi- good and fresh

I was disappointed that they ran out of live sea urchins. However, the sea urchin sushi I had was very very fresh and you could totally taste the sweetness of fresh uni. And chef was pretty generous with uni. I also tried their halibut caparccio, salmon skin hand rolls and giant claim sashimi. All of them tasted pretty good. My only complaint would be pork cutlets. Pork meat tasted kinda dry. It came with pretty nice portion. I just wish meat could taste tender and juicy. Overall I had a great time here. Both my tummy and taste buds felt very satisfied.

We weren't charged when they forgot a roll, but it's still disappointing to get home and expect something that wasn't there all along. When they messed up a part of our order, we called them and they'd offer to fix it but we'd turn it down because it's 25-30 minutes away. That leads me to this tip: double check your to-go order before you leave because they don't show you what's in the bag when your order is ready.

The reviews of Yummy Grill speak for themselves.  I can't imagine that I am adding much to the body of knowledge that is their review history.  

My bottom line:  Yummy Grill is now my ""Go To"" for sushi & late night dining on my own side of town.  Every time I have come here, it is more than just dining, it is an experience.  Their ""Reverse Happy Hour"" starts at 10pm & goes until close.  BTW, the staff have amazing memories.  Amazing. 

I highly recommend.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,3,2,5,RwWiuL-iKTIPh8GVU89Mzg

If you decide to show up on a weekend I do recommend a reservation! 

It's a tiny place and it fills up quick.  (Nicolas Cage has been seen here!)

I was really super happy to see another family with kids here so I was not ruining a date night!  The kids menu offers a choice between chicken or beef teriyaki, rice, one California roll and miso soup.  

Noodle bowls were a big hit with our group as was the tempura and a few sushi rolls. The Diablo roll was topped with some jalapenos and spicy sauce was served on the side.This was my favorite and I'll be back for more.

4012783,2012-06-23,10,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"My love for sushi is always tragic.  I crave really fresh ingredients from exotic places, I submit to science in muscle rebuilding theory with protein from all you can eat sushi (nigiri), or pretend to fancy a sushi chefs creative artistry in their specialized rolls.  A word about being open minded, my first visit many moons ago was my first review, it was filled with ""Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens, brown paper packages tied up with strings..."" 

As I kept returning, even for a short one hour work lunch break, the owner/chef would ask how I was doing.  I would act normal and pretend not to be excited with my replies.  They were always something along the lines of me being in the area and they're open late so it's convenient but Chef Eric is a smart man and can see that I am grinning inside for the fresh items posted on the white board outside.

I am one of many returning customers but the question that is hard to ask of a sushi place is, ""Is what you see, what you really get? "" The answer can be shown to you and they are proud to showcase it.  Live shrimp and live uni still living in their shells, fish like last nights flown in from places such as Tokyo.  Chef puts a lot of effort into finding and purchasing these fresh items for us, those of us who really know sushi.  I say that because they serve the western sushi eaters as well.  My first dish ever in Yummy Sushi was a roll.  Most rolls are good and you can find one which would be perfect for you, the people who sat next to me during my second to last visit ordered the same ahi tuna roll three times.  The party of eight in the back of the room kept ordering rolls after rolls.

The chefs here really exceed in skills and knowledge because they focus on being fruitful rather than being paid employees.  Every time I order the live shrimp I see one of the main sushi chefs work on carefully cleaning and prepping my live sweet shrimp.  He could have made two sushi rolls within that time or sent the shrimp to the back to be made but no shortcuts here.

Have an open mind and sit around a revolution: chefs not from Japan or China, whichever you consider where Sushi originated from, making your sushi; welcome diners who want to enjoy their ""sushi (aka Rolls)"" and yum yum sauce; and especially being in a non AYCE establishment.  Again, don't be fooled by the western influenced menu (just look at the many sushi rolls), there are off menu dishes for those of us who know what to really look for in sushi.  There wouldn't be off menu dishes or delicate sashimi if these sushi chefs did not have the skills to create it.  

Friends with sushi benefits, I would not sit anywhere else other than the counter or sushi bar, I would suggest you do the same.  Ask for fresh wasabi if it compliments your sushi.

The non all you can eat practice hurts my muscles but the fresh sushi warms my heart.  Look at the white board outside, look at the white board inside the restaurant to see what they have in fresh and give them a try!  And to finish the lyrics in my intro ""...These are a few of my favorite things"" (Sound of Music), that is why i continue to come here.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,23,13,5,klOHkvAhjUVNSa04rtsShQ

They served us a complimentary amuse bouche of Korean pancakes. That was nice! 

I got the bulgogi lunch combo with California roll, miso soup, salad, rice, and 4 pieces veggie and shrimp tempura. It was a ton of food! We packed up half to take home. 

The lunch specials are priced $11-13.50. A little high for a lunch special but not for the amount of food. I would have prefered an $8 lunch special that I could eat all in one sitting. $36 for two is a bit much for bento boxes.

Was in the area and Stephanie S. invited me over for some sushi. Because I just had In-N-Out two hours earlier, I didn't eat much just their yellow tail nigiri, tuna nigiri, and a shrimp tempura hand roll.  All weren't that bad, but was a little skeptical with the yellowtail since I'm use to them having a lighter color to them.  I also thought that both nigiri's were small compared to the Henderson location.  

This location is smaller and busier than the Henderson location. This location is also closer to me so I see myself coming back.  I still have my favorites from the other location like their shashimi, halibut, and even their Loco Moco.

On of my co-workers told us about this little hidden gem and we opted to go for the late night Happy Hour (after 10pm)  one evening after work. We were able to call ahead and reserve seats at the Sushi bar and were promptly seated as soon as we arrived.

First up: Endamame .. the server offered the standard version with salt, or the ""garlic"" version. We got the garlic and it was delicious. Just the right amount of saltiness, garlic with a touch of spiciness from the sweet chili sauce. So good and we'll definitely be ordering this again! Another hit, surprisingly, was the Popcorn Scallops. Though the morsels of scallops are rather small, the sauce (kind of an orangy and spicy blend) is delish. We ordered a second round of this one. .

The sushi chef recommended several items from their menu board of specials. The Japanese Yellowtail was super fresh and tasty. I would have preferred thinner slices and will remember to request that they do that the next time. 

My co-workers' favorite in terms of Sushi and rolls was the Kiss of Fire Roll, 
with spicy soft shell crab, cucumber, shrimp tempura on the inside and spicy soft shell crab, yellowtail, spicy ponzu, spicy and eel sauce on the outside. 

We also tried the Sake Sampler and though I am not huge on Sake .. the Apple flavored one was quite yummy and something I could drink .. it reminded me of a Jolly Rancher but in liquid form ;) 

The guests seated next to us at the bar were ordering their rolls and sushi with brown rice, a nice option that this venue offers. The happy hour pricing is reasonable, and the food is tasty. Be sure to call ahead if you want to sit at the sushi bar or if you have a larger party as they attract a nice-sized crowd for the late hour.",vrZbq8XOQL83kZqUtmrQYg,0,0,4,GB1Bmqd-Ymw37wv3UePOCA

4107208,2015-08-09,4,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"The Yummy Grill & Sushi on Lake Mead Blvd has constantly been reputed to be one of the best sushi places in Las Vegas. Despite being located in a nondescript plaza, I think it lives up to the billing.

It's taken me a long time to venture out here, and I'm glad that I finally did. I arrived rather late during the late night happy hour (daily 10pm until closing, also Sun-Thu 4-6pm) determined to put them to the test. Unfortunately, they had run out of live sushi entirely. As my friend (a regular whose name was remembered by one of the chefs) and as many reviewers can attest, I clearly missed out on something that might have been truly special. I'll strive to arrive earlier next time.

Regardless of that initial disappointment, we were able to dine on a variety of sushi, many of which were at happy hour prices. The happy hour menu is a double-sided sheet that you actually use to make your order by marking desired quantities and presenting it to the server (even if sitting at the bar, as we were), The fish that I'm about to list were all nigiri, and they all come at two pieces per order.

- Garlic Edamame ($3.50): didn't care for it too much. It's actually spicy and not just garlicky.
- Octopus ($3.50): tasty, juicy, dabbed with a bit of soy sauce. Simplicity at its best.
- Kanpachi, subbed for Japanese yellowtail ($3.75): kanpachi is one of the more premium items normally, but either an oversight or an undercharge led to us paying that price. It is definitely more delicious than the other place where I've eaten it.
- Super White Tuna ($3.75): topped with a dab of a chili sauce, which didn't really mask the natural fish flavor. Generous fish portion and more flavorful than most of the times that I've had it elsewhere.
- Japanese Sea Scallop ($3.75): juicy scallop, definitely not the ""bay scallop"" variety that some places use as a cheap substitute. I'd order it again.
- Big Eye Tuna, aka Ahi ($4.50): this had a bit of an odd flavor for some reason. Maybe it was the sushi vinegar hitting my tongue? I didn't care for this as much as I'd hoped.
- Blue Fin ($8.50): good flavor and texture, but felt like a marginal improvement over standard tuna. I was hesitant at this price and would probably shy away next time.
- Toro ($17.75): so nice that we ordered it twice. Fatty tuna is one of the holy grails of sushi, and this is probably the best toro preparation that I've had in my rather limited experience. They actually cut this from the fatty collar area instead of the belly, and they add a bit of caviar and edible gold leaf to complete the luxurious presentation. It almost melts in the mouth, but it's actually preferable (to me anyway) to savor the flavor for longer than if it had truly melted, as some traditional o-toro from the belly tends to do. Price be damned, it's an absolute must-order here.
- Uni ($14.75): a little disappointing in that they added the kama toro, some ikura, fresh wasabi, and one or two other components that diluted the uni. I would've liked to taste the unadulterated uni, especially given that it was reportedly sourced from Japan instead of Santa Barbara.
- Surf Clam ($2.75): subbed out properly for the conch, which was unavailable. Great texture, not too chewy, but again a bit more subtle in flavoring.
- Sweet Shrimp ($6.50): the tail nigiri was certainly some of the better amaebi that I've had, and they provide a special dipping sauce for it. The deep fried head was perhaps subtly tastier with less possibly offputting flavors.
- Spanish Mackerel ($6.00): the flavor was surprisingly not so intense. They ran out of normal mackarel, which I would have liked to taste for comparison's sake. I had a mackerel sashimi once that somehow tasted sublime, and this didn't live up to that memory.
- Orange slices (complimentary): I can't help but love free dessert, and I'm glad that every slice was sweet.

Service and sushi preparation were both brisk and attentive. The server cleared empty plates promptly, refilled drinks often, brought out water for my friend when he simply requested a halt to his soda refills (complimentary), and brought out napkins toward the end (perhaps to help with the potentially leaky orange slices). The chefs handed plates to us one at a time.

The bill came out to about $50 a person before tax/tip (for the number crunchers, we each had 1 piece for the most part). It was a solid value for quality fish all around, especially considering that the toro accounted for most of the cost (justifiably so). I'd definitely go back to try to get my chopsticks on the live sushi, and maybe I'll even try the omakase when I'm feeling especially splurgy. Don't confuse this Yummy Grill & Sushi with any of the other locations that may still exist around Las Vegas / Henderson - you have to make the trip out here at least once if you're a sushi fan.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,3,4,y8RfAr_RR5Q3tWLb-fkt2g

I'm going to piggyback every other review in echoing the awesomeness that is Yummy Grill & Sushi. This has a great extensive menu that can compete with any other sushi bar in Las Vegas.

Going in for a late lunch I ordered the teriyaki box with a miso soup and edamame. Also was served a small side of complementary pancake slices before my main meal came.

Straight from the start, everything that was put out in front of me was top shelf. Everything was cooked to perfection. The service was great with the chefs and servers being very polite and personable.

Then why only 4 stars you might ask. Well even though my experience was all 5 star, I realized after speaking with the chef that the fish dishes were the speciality!! Kinda of on me because didn't read the reviews all the way through. So I'm planning to go back real soon to experience what I missed out on.

The only thing that may have been a little disappointing was that the food took a while and service was a little slow.

Minor things aside, Chef was very nice and attentive and ended up giving us complimentary edamame to keep our tummies from growling too much. I would definitely come back and give it another try.",YTnwsIRvreabnO00xbBO0w,0,0,4,KumSdPPu2PlnJ2K3gQiTjA

We did notice that the wait for our food did take awhile to come out even though there were only us and the one other occupied table.  However, there was only one sushi chef working and a couple of to go orders called in so that could contribute to the wait time for the food.  
 
Our table ordered the Miso Soup $2, Seaweed Salad $5, Dynamite Roll $10.50, Kamikaze Roll $10.50, Lisa Roll $9, Spider Man Roll $11, Kalbi Box Dinner $18, and a soda $2, all for a grand total of $66.74, which includes the 10% discount offered for Yelp check-ins.

I ordered a baked California roll with brown rice and it came smothered with an avalanche amount of ""yummy sauce"", which is soy and mayo.

I'm on a pretty strict diet and I don't do dairy, so when I sank my teeth into the baked Cali roll I was completely grossed out.

It would've not been such a big deal if it was a tiny amount of sauce, but unfortunately it was just swimming in it.

So I requested that they make another one without the sauce and they said they couldn't so I opted for a regular Cali roll and this simple request became a small nightmare.

It took 20 minutes to get that out then they couldn't find my order. Then they packed it up to go and by then I lost my appetite. So basically I ended up paying $22 for a few Cali rolls and miso soup and it just was not worth it.

In all honesty I've had much better experiences in food and service at other sushi places and I think I'll just stick to those. At this point I'm not really thrilled about this place and I don't think I'll be coming back.

The fish looked beautiful but it was way too over priced! I don't think I will go back again, I don't mind paying for good fish but I do mind just waiting even for drinks, for the kind of money they charge their service should be top notch.

4274333,2011-10-17,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"Yummy Grill & Sushi surprised me... for a few reasons..

The name for one, since a name like Yummy grill & sushi would have caused me to run away in my local homeyelptown.

But this place is awesome, like me and the BF were saying that Toronto needs a Yummy Grill & Sushi bar. 

They offer fresh sashimi, and they specialize in rolls, as well as deep fried or baked rolls on top of everything else they offer. They seem to like the ponzu soy sauce quite a bit too, but it's not a bad thing.

Their roll names are pretty fanciful, such as Sex on the Beach (really good, I recommend), My Ex-Girlfriend, Romeo.. I know it sounds odd, but I almost burst out laughing when I heard a kid ask the waiter if he could have an orgasm roll... but it's good to know that they take their sushi rolls seriously. 

Their menu is fairly easy to navigate, we ordered their clam miso soup, which was meaty came loaded with clams, which added a nice meaty-ness depth to the miso soup, good value for $3.50

We started off with a Joy, bam-bam, and finished with the Sex on the Beach roll, all of which were fresh and extremely flavourful without being too much of one thing or another, you were able to taste everything they had put in to the roll and it wasn't too overly stuffed.

Another thing they have that i haven't seen anywhere else, was their flavoured-sake--- this stuff is good.  We ordered their sake sampler $7 for 3 decent sized glasses of sake, we were able to try fuji apple, plum and raspberry. I definitely liked their fuiji Apple one the best, and the BF liked the plum. The sake tasted like sake, but you get the aroma and the taste of the fruit at the same time, quite enjoyable and a steal $7. They, also, sell sparking sake too; which I didn't see until too late, but that is for next time...

Their black sesame ice cream is quite good, and isn't too sweet either. Perfect ending to pretty note-perfect meal.

Service is good and attentive.",Tc3GAQdAfOW542ROdyCZPg,2,1,4,TXMDDQs7MNCg1kksQ-Ss_g
4287698,2015-01-18,3,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"First off, I'm fairly new to sushi and for me it's all about the texture. With that being said, I can only critique the rolls which I ordered bc I still havent acclimated myself to the raw stuff lol!

We tried the shrimp tempura roll, California roll and gyoza. The shrimp tempura roll was just ok, I liked the shrimp but the flakes weren't my favorite. But you really can't mess up a shrimp roll! LOL. The Cali roll is very typical, and def filling. The gyoza was also pretty tasty!

We also had mochi, which I wasn't a fan of... Again this is something I'm not used to but it's worth a try!

4451800,2014-04-16,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"With so many sushi places in this city - are there any that truly stand out from the rest?

Yummy Grill & Sushi, in my opinion stands out for its supremely fresh fish and ""off-menu"" items. The sashimi is phenomenal (Blue Fin Tuna & Toro respectively).

Rolls come in a variety of styles, tastes, flavors, with sauces, without. While my friend and I dined here we ordered the following: Come To Me (spicy), Dynamite, and Tomo Devil (very nice spicy taste). The Dynamite is like your typical sushi-places except it comes out in kind of a sushi format instead of a bowl.

Happy hour prices are quite nice. Ordered two rolls, one a spicy/crunchy tuna roll that I quite enjoyed.

Kanpachi with Serrano was somewhat disappointing. The sauce the sashimi is served in has an odd taste to it, and the Serrano pepper, while spicy, does not necessarily add to the fish in my opinion.

We ended our meal with fried green tea ice cream. Crunchy exterior, smooth finished ice cream with a strong green tea taste. 

The restaurant itself is small, so if you go during high-peak times make sure to make a reservation. Also, it may be best to make sure you are ""pacing"" yourself here as each dish you order comes out at a much slower pace than most sushi places.

They do not do AYCE. No matter. This place is top-notch and should not be missed, based mostly on its super fresh ingredients, off-menu items, and its congenial staff.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,4,D0loLiUJaQlokY-PPtYLxA

I am by no means a sushi expert. I am fairly new to sushi, so my review is based my personal tastes. 

I arrived with my wife just before 9pm. We were waiting on another couple to join us. We were hoping to sit at the sushi bar, as I find it more enjoyable, and enjoy talking to the sushi chefs as they work. The very small bar did not have four seats next to each other, so we sat at a table as we waited for our friends. A server took our drink order, and asked if we were ready to order. I told the server that we were waiting for two more people and we would wait for them to arrive before we ordered. While I appreciate the staff's desire to get our order, we were approached not less than 3 more times (all by different servers), and told them the same thing, that were waiting for friends. 

While we were waiting for our friends, seats opened up at the bar, so we moved there. I counted at least 6 chefs behind the bar, and it took several minutes for any of them to greet us. Since we were up at the bar, my wife and I decided to start ordering, My initial order consisted of Ahi Tuna, Crab Roll Sushi and a Philadelphia Roll. My wife is not a fan of sushi, but she did enjoy the crab roll sushi since it was fully cooked. The Ahi Tuna was decent, but a much smaller portion than I receive at other sushi places,  The biggest problem I had was with the Philadelphia Roll. It was tiny compared to other Philadelphia Rolls I have had, there was a very tiny amount of rice on the roll, and it was obviously not rolled tightly as it fell apart on the plate, and the rice simply started flaking off the seaweed. VERY disappointed in this roll. My wife actually decided to order another crab roll sushi since she enjoyed the first order so much. To end my experience, I decided to order the Tiger Roll, a specialty roll. It was fairly decent, no real complaints about that. 

One interesting situation that occurred was when toward the end of our meal, One of the (less experienced, I assume) chefs was telling a story to another, and he pointed right at my wife and I, while speaking in a different language. The other (more experienced) chef quickly noticed the strange look on our face, and immediately explained he was telling a story about his friends that were sitting in that spot, and did not mean to disrespect us by appearing to talk about us in a foreign language. 

If some of my friends really wanted to go to Yummy Sushi, I would probably join them, this place would not be my immediate first choice of Sushi restaurants.",2h-oRg-T0dkRuPWd15EXXA,2,0,3,fLWeuAzaukEqNKRK7vIC5g

4571750,2013-08-05,3,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"We were first timers last night, going to try a new place to celebrate 2 years of marriage, the happiest moments of our lives which included a lot of sushi thus far!  We wanted to sit at bar but only waited about 5 minutes for a family of 4 to skeedaddle.  We were seated in front of Chef Wen, and received great service from 3 different servers.  We received the free hot sake from the yelp check-in, I also had iced green tea and Eric R. had hot green tea.  We also were given complimentary Korean style pancake which was topped with some green onions!

We tried many items that are unique to here.  Unfortunately, the last live uni was ordered when we arrived so I could not try it yet.  However, we kicked off the meal with live scallop.  What is cool is that a chef in the kitchen comes out and shows the live shellfish before preparation.  We inspected our scallop before it was prepared into sashimi cuts, drizzled with yuzu juice (my eyes lit  up when I saw it!), black tobiko, and gold leaf!  It was delicate and delicious, with yuzu as the perfect complement.

Next we got hamachi belly nigiri, which was of course fatty deliciousness.  I ordered kohada which was yummy considering I am a big fan of saba.  The cure was similar.  We enjoyed sake with avocado and yuzu.  Eric R. got super white tuna, then I ordered live amaebi which came out to wiggle around on the counter and say hello.  On Chef Wen's recommendation we got blue fin maguro,which was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I tried an oyster and  then a salmon skin handroll.  Eric R. ordered an over the rainbow roll, which was like a California roll with assorted fish piled on top of the cut roll.  For our anniversary we were treated to free ice cream (plum and vanilla).  I completed the meal with the true dessert, uni nigiri.  Chef Wen topped it with a small piece of ika and some ikura.  I was really impressed.

Every day, the restaurant orders live uni and other hard-to-get treats, so every day there will be different special fish to try.  That alone makes it worth the trek here if you live far away.  I did not get to meet Chef Eric as he was off but we enjoyed Chef Wen and the other chefs.  Plus we sat next to a character who is also a regular, and we ran into Kevin P.  Considering we had no idea what the prices of any specials were as we ordered them, the price was less than we expected knowing it was an a la carte place.  Yummy is yummy!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,5,5,4,ly1vkwCf1qlay7cSScHO6A
4573837,2014-07-18,1,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"The quality of the fish at this restaurant is excellent.  Nigiri fans will have a lot to love about this place with their beautiful cuts of fish that almost fold under the rice.  They also have a lot of a great cooked menu items like the popcorn scallops and vegetable pancake.  The best orgasm salad I had was here - very large cuts of tuna and lots of tasty sesame seasoning.

We went during Happy Hour where you really only save about $1 per item and they offer a limited selection of half rolls.   A couple things that really bothered me about the restaurant is that the service dropped off in the middle of the meal and it seemed like they forgot about us.  It was also hard to communicate with the wait staff even though they were very courteous and made excellent suggestions.  The sushi rice was also too sweet, which maybe some people like but I just can't get into.

Still I would recommend trying to this place out to high quality sushi fans.  It is probably a better experience if you sit at the sushi bar with the chefs.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,3,1,4,hnslmSSqqM09sN03GFIwAg

I had higher expectations for this place and had a mediocre experience. We coincidentally dined here during their HH hours and decided to take advantage. We ordered a bunch of rolls and each came out in a timely manner. Since prices were cheap, we weren't expecting anything spectacular. Each roll was cut into 4 tiny pieces and they were poorly put together. My rolls were falling apart as I was picking them up. Also, it would be nice if they had a description of each roll. If I had known that our spicy rolls were drenched in mayo, then I would've requested no sauce.

Our saving grace was our a la carte sushi. The ahi tuna, salmon and uni sashimi/nigiri were excellent. The presentation was much better than our other dishes.",9unlBkftcCxEuOzPliukQw,1,1,4,EqRggkjw7xNQosBIK28WwA
4655254,2016-02-25,24,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"On my Yelp profile page it is about time that I replace ""My last meal on Earth: Whatever good restaurant is at the airport"" with ""My last meal on Earth: Yummy Sushi.""  Yummy Sushi serves food that is just out of this earth. The chefs at Yummy are artists that create culinary music to the taste buds. The Yummy Sushi Chefs are conductors that start off your meal light and brings it to a crescendo. 

   If you read my reviews you will see that I am an adventurer on the hiking trails. Additionally I am an adventurer in dining. Throw a new cruisine at me and I am up for the challenge. Going back nearly three years ago in the Spring of 2013, after a hiking adventure in Red Rock Canyon, my friend encouraged me to try this sushi restaurant called Yummy Sushi. I never had sushi in my life. I accepted the challenge. It would rock my world. As soon as I tasted the Yummy (literally) fish, I have been a fan of sushi. 

  Friendship is the act of giving. I'd lead my friend on hiking adventures and she'd lead me on sushi adventures at Yummy. Sushi is a culinary art in itself. Between my friend and the talented chefs at Yummy including Eric and Dale, talented dining guides led me on adventures starting from the Spring of 2013 til the end of this 2015 til the future. My friend would check off the items on the white order form and I'd look forward to eating the fresh fish that the chefs had flown in. Throughout the last couple of years the five star food that I had the privilege to taste included sushi campache with the magical fruits from Japan, Avalone, King oyster mussels, dessert strawberry mochi, Seaweed salad, crab and cucumber salad with wasabi and ginger, taro cheek, kanpachi, ocean trout, miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sayori, sushi campache, King oyster mushroom with garlic, and my favorite spicy scallop. My ultimate Yummy Sushi adventure was when my friend treated me to the omakase for my Birthday. The omakase is when the meal consists of dishes that the Chef selects. My earlier Yummy adventures were complimented by sake. A little bit of alcohol can be beneficial to extreme food adventures. If I was drinking green tea during the omakase, I doubt that I'd have the strength to eat the fish skeleton with the eyeballs looking at me. This was my most daring food adventure ever. 

   Yummy Sushi is more fancy than classy. It sits in the Michael's and Chuck E Cheese-anchored shopping center at the southwest corner of Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way West of the US 95 interchange. The restaurant features counter and table seating. We'd always sit at the L-shaped counter seating. The chefs are part of the theatre that is the Yummy Sushi dining adventure. The L-shaped counter is the front row seating. We'd enjoy watching the chefs turn fresh fish into culinary art. We also enjoy interacting with the personable and talented chefs. Instead of discouraging pictures they encourage pictures of their culinary marvels. The chefs have always led us to outstanding food. The counter seating also has outstanding displays of the fresh fish. 

  My complaint about Yummy is that I never left spending less than $50. Recently I reviewed the Magic Tree. Unfortunately it doesn't have money growing off the leaves. If it did, I'd be practically living at Yummy Sushi. Nevertheless, Yummy Sushi does offer outstanding Happy Hour and lunch menus. 

  Yummy Sushi is one of a kind. At the time of writing this review, I want my last meal on Earth to be Yummy Sushi.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,36,40,5,1upCSshlq_zBmnDcm7yO6w

Happy hour sushi- yellow tail roll, spicy tuna, baked california were all good. Nothing extraordinary. The japanese lasagna was pretty good though. 
911 roll- the jalepenos were super spicy but my dad enjoyed this. 
volcano roll- our favorite. It was a whole bunch of stuff including mushrooms and scallops baked on top of a california rolls but it worked really well together. 
tiger roll- sister's boyfriend's favorite. I don't really like shrimp tempura so I can't say much. 
paradise roll- this was a last minute order since my sister's boyfriend and I were still hungry after our original order. I was really happy with this one. We were all a little hesitant about coconut on sushi but it ended up being delicious and i was picking up all the spare pieces of coconut off the plate when it was over. 
Sashimi on rice- this was my mom's order. It took a good half an hour for it to come. She was a little disappointed in the portion size. There were only one of each kind of sashimi. There was furikake on the rice which was a nice since the fish to rice proportions were pretty bad. The sushi rice wasn't seasoned enough but the carrots had been pickled and were good. The tamago wasn't sweet enough. 

The sashimi quality was great but the portions in general were pretty small. I'm usually stuffed after a $10 specialty roll but we each had a specialty roll plus a couple of happy hour rolls. I believe they get their fish flown in from California, which kinda explains it.  Our fault for eating sushi in the middle of a desert.",GO1_SF6z1a3otwSg2fbJrA,1,1,3,92Oa-73clzAFcLb3nVKhqw

They have high quality fish. I love their Kamashida toro, o toro, ama ebi, live uni, jikinmedi, king salmon, scallop, kapachi and everything that Eric prepares during omakase. I highly recommend everyone  try omakase in Yummy. 

They are expanding their business and they will have omakase only in the unit next to their current place. I believe the current store will remain the same. I can't wait to see what Eric has in stores for us with their new expansion. Thanks Eric for the high quality sushi and affordable price.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,4,5,5,OecZ9GEoISo3Ojw0wkXBPw

- miso 
- house salad (which was actually pretty tasty) 
- I think 8 super generous cuts of sashimi (2 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 yellowtail, and 2 halibut(?)) 
- 1 spicy tuna roll 

the Sashimi was super fresh, buttery, and the pieces were thick! The spicy tuna roll was very fresh, the only complaint I had was that it was a tad salty. 

Knocked off a star for slow service.  The waitress was a bit absentminded, my friend got a lunch special with chicken bowl, salad, miso and spicy tuna, and the waitress never got the spicy tuna order in and checked on us so infrequently that we had to wait an hr (after I had finished my meal practically) to ask her about it. Then it took another eternity for us to get it.

The BF and I came for the late night happy hour which is from 10pm to close. Various nigiri, rolls, appetizers and dishes are discounted. Some become a really good deal, some just have a tiny discount. 

We got some rolls (comes 4pc to a order, not a whole roll). 
Salmon skin - good, and the sauce is not too sweet and I like when places put bonito flakes. 
Garlic yellowtail roll - pretty fresh yellowtail, simple but good. 
Spicy scallop - was a crab and scallop mixture, just OK 

Tobiko nigiri - duo of two kinds! nicely fresh. 
Anago - very good anago and a generously large slice of it 

Kaki udon - the broth was actually rather tasty, a bit sweet on the finish. This was rather filling and hit the spot. 

We also splurged and got ourselves a live scallop (not part of HH). Fresh scallop is softer and sweeter than not live. I enjoy that other than the main scallop, they included the ""fins"" which are a bit more chewy and crunchy but I happen to really like it. 

A few weeks later I went here to lunch with a regular, Christie O. 

I had a chirashi bowl/sushi with rice. It comes with miso soup and salad, both standard, but good. The bowl had a decent amount of fish - 2 pieces of : yellowtail, tuna, white tuna, salmon, tamago and 1 piece of: octopus, shrimp, kani and surf clam. Also has some radish, and cucumber garnish. I took a few bites of Christies sashimi. Definitely all the fish was fresh.

I think the service is pretty nice here, though generally not speedy.

I am going to have to disagree and say that Sushi Ota is a lot better. However, don't get me wrong this place has very fresh sushi and is unique.   We dined in for lunch and they have some great lunch specials. 
The Order:
3 item lunch special for 12.95: miso soup, chicken teriyaki bowl, and eel bowl.  Pretty good can't go wrong for the price. 
Otoro: fatty pieces of tuna belly that tasted fresh but was hoping for the mouth watering, fatty, melting in your mouth experience. 
Abalone: served sashimi style, really small, was hoping for more flavor. 
Sweet shrimp: it was live shrimp freshly moving around. Loved it!!!  Very fresh. I liked the deep fried head, just wish they had a tastier ponzu. 
Uni: good but I have had better. 

Pros: 
Their sushi is imported from Japan and is really fresh.  Most items are still alive. 
Nice lunch menu. 
They make their own wasabi from fresh wasabi root. 

Cons:
I think there are 2 restaurants. When we initially came in we were wondering if we were in the right place because the lunch side looks very dumpy.

Overall:
I think this is great place with fresh sushi. Since I am not too familiar with a lot of restaurants in Vegas I can't really compare it to much. But wouldn't be surprised if this place has the best sushi in Vegas. I am giving this place 4 stars because I feel like the price point is set pretty high for specialty items.

It's great for lunch, dinner and late night. 

We come here pretty regularly when we want sushi and it has yet to disappoint us. 

They want their customers to know that they have fresh fish flown in 3 times a week and more if needed. They even bring out eel, fish and whatever to show the clients how fresh their meal is going to be. Honestly, I could do without. But it's still pretty cool for some people, I suppose.

I wasn't worried though because I heard they had good sushi...

The kiss of fire had a good texture and taste, it had the perfect amount of crunch and spice (this is where they get the 2 stars).  The dantes inferno was very blah though and the white fish tasted like it came out of the lake in desert shores.  My girlfriend ordered the chef's special roll, the server didnt know what it was (surprise surprise).  She didn't like it and ate hardly any, oh and it cost 14 dollars.

5127652,2013-12-24,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"Yummy has a huge disconnect between its food and service. The positives: fish is super fresh and there's a lot of variety. I love the baby yellow tail. The fresh wasabi is a great change of pace and will definitely clear your sinuses. I have no complaints on the food side and would gladly come back for the quality of fish and seafood that was service. The tastes, temperature and textures were spot on and excellent.

Service: Went down hill from the word go. We were promptly seated and my fiancé knew that he wanted a large hot sake. I wasn't ready so our server left. She came back about 5 minutes later to take my drink order for a small hot plum sake. 5 minutes later my sake arrived. The server took our sashimi and roll order for the 21 piece chefs choice, a Johnny Roll, ex-girlfriend roll and a spicy tuna. About 20 minutes later our food arrives and the fiancé asks about his sake. About 2 minutes later his sake is delivered to the table behind us that remarks they didn't order sake. The server takes the sake and the cups and sets them on our table and asks the fiancé if it's hot enough. He replies no and she whisks it away.

Our server comes back, without the sake and asks if we want anymore rolls and we ask for 3 tuna, 2 baby yellow tail and 2 yellow tail (sashimi style). We ask about the sake again. About 10 minutes later the chef delivers our 2nd round of sushi, still no sake and he asks how our dinner is. We tell him that we're still waiting on a sake that was ordered over a half and hour ago and we haven't been able to flag anyone down since then. He apologizes and tells us the server is in training. He also notes all the rice on our plate and says you should have ordered it sashimi style. We did! 

Finally about 5 minutes later our sake arrives. I am totally out of plum sake but don't feel like waiting 30 minutes for another one. We get our bill and the fiancé's large sake is discounted by 50%. After the terrible service and the cramped quarters I'm thinking we might give them a second try. This was a Friday at about 5 p.m. but we didn't think that would be their busy time by any means.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,3,1,3,kOS4-DYfS9nHCfxER71wgA

5139969,2013-03-02,1,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"Alright, so I FINALLY made it in here...and yes, it isn't that far from home.  I typically gorge out on AYCE when the sushi craving hits, so when I read some of the reviews and saw it wasn't ayce, I kind of didn't take it as a must-do...and put it on my bookmark backburner.

Now that I have tried it, I now know I was mistaken!  I know I am a little late to the goodness that is known as Yummy Grill & Sushi, but better late than never!

First up...the quality of food!  They have many LIVE options, which is obviously as fresh as can be.  Reading the other reviews, you will see many examples, such as live uni, live sweet shrimps, live fish options, and live mussels (which we ordered).  Of course, the mussel was super tender, with a great taste...probably the best I've had.  I know for sure the presentation was...shown to us still in shell, and served on a bed of ice inside its own half shell.  Check out my pic! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#SfbQPXXQPZlxdQU_nCFytA

But besides the live stuff, because I know not everyone will order live, the rest of the quality was still amazing!  Some of the best fish I have tasted sushi wise...with many literally melt in your mouth tender, buttery, and orgasmic.  Check out our sashimi platter, which had 21 pieces of delicious for $30 :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#aULMp0qkowNrgpvHGooBUw

It seriously was that good.  The cuts were nice and thick, very fresh and still cold when it hits your table.  I will go a step ahead and say it's probably the BEST sushi I've had!  I also ordered some nigiri too, and the fish/rice ratio was very good...see for yourself :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#u0FmODEewlgKJX0Ooo9ViA

They also do eel very well here.  The sauce and fixings are very welcoming.  We went with some nigiri and a bowl of unagi on rice, because it is my little boy's favorite!  The bowl came with about 8 pieces of unagi, and was a great value at about $12-13 :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#USN90UfR2H66vNaobRy1Tg

So you know how awesome the food was...that only leaves price and service!

Price, I can happily say, was not extraordinary.  I spent a little more than I would have AYCE status, but I definitely left happy.  All that food above and a few more nigiri ran me about $80.  That extra $20 was well worth the cost considering the freshness and taste, and the experience eating live seafood!  Eating smarter next time around, I think I would be closer to the AYCE costs.

BUT BUT BUT...I almost took off a star for service.  Service was friendly, but SLOW.  It took me almost 2hrs to eat the food above, and I have no idea why.  The food just took a long time being prepared, but it wasn't sitting on the shelf or anything, because everything was nice and cold.  The chefs must have been behind, but seriously it started getting annoying.  The server also realized it was going slow, so kept apologizing for the wait, and brought out some comp edamame, but don't come here if you are in a hurry.

The food was that good, as to not drop the review or experience though.  I will be back again!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,5,2,5,d5tgE8G_ynqul9p12VkQXA

Everyone is putting this place on the map as one of the go-to spots to grub on some sushi. I will say being that it is not AYCE you definitely can taste the difference but there are things here that i will say that Ive had at other places for way cheaper. I even came in during HH and still the price that we paid for everything was still kind of silly. Couple things that i could remember is their Taste like your EX GF roll,Hamachi Kama,deep fried scallop was really good too! I may not have came in at the right time because it was 10pm @night on a saturday and according to other reviews its all about the fresh menu. Here what we had...

Kushii & Kumamoto Oysters (Favorite)
Otoro (not worth it) and Super White Tuna Nigiri 
Fried Scallops
Hamachi Kama
Salmon Skin roll
Spicy Scallop roll
Fresh japanese uni nigiri (Wife enjoyed this alot)
Crunch Roll
Taste like your ex GF roll ( Best roll)

I dont think for me it was worth the drive but i definitely enjoyed the food. Not sure if it was good enough to say ""this is my new spot"" but everything was great as far as service. The only thing i wish for during my experience was that the waiter who waited on us gave us some more recommendations because i didnt have a limit on how much i wanted to spend i just wanted what was the best there and maybe shouldve coordinated with ( NELSON Q) to sit on the bar and make sure i got his tips before walking in.",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,4,4,4,K3nCIBUFtzXwq_OM_3on6Q

Granted, I don't eat live uni, but if a spot is dedicated to delivering high-quality, fresh fish, I tend to believe they are going to deliver an all around delicious experience. 

Two delicious items I experienced:
1. Yellowtail with jalapeno: Super fresh and the cuts were definitely bigger than your average serving of this classic. 

2. Chicken Teriyaki Dinner: Yes, I ordered chicken teriyaki, and it was dynamite. It came with soup and salad, and the servings were generous. The salad was fresh and served with a notably yummy yuzu dressing. It appeared to be two chicken breasts, and the flavor was everything you dream of in a teriyaki. 

The offer  brown rice, even for their sushi rolls, but it does come with an upcharge of $1/per roll or $3/entree. This can add up pretty darn quickly!

Overall, though: a definite must-try for fresh fish lovers, and if you're not a fish lover, there are plenty of items executed well for you to try.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,15,4,eN1qMyYXZZN7nAVvzOcYhw

I've been coming here for years (my pre-Yelp years) since I work around the corner. I come here every week almost and this week I was here twice...mostly to-go orders and the occasional  meeting up with Yelpers.   I come here too often that I should be getting desensitized by their food by now...but no!

I keep getting the same stuff which is a problem of mine: edamame, salmon sashimi, spicy salmon bowl, any rolls with salmon or tuna.  The quality of fish here is good. I've tried their scallops, blue fin and uni before - those were amazing. 

It's a good thing I didn't go here alone today and I got to try other items on their lunch menu like their pork belly (one of the best I've had. The fat was rendered well so you don't get that gross glob of fat in your mouth feel), garlic edamame (I stepped away from the regular edamame this time. They were very garlicky and a bit spicy and oh so delicious!) and the Unagi bowl (fresh-tasting eel and the sauce wasn't heavy). Then there were items we got today that didn't wow me: ramen, spicy tuna bowl, spicy pork bowl and the salmon skin salad. I've had better elsewhere. For some reason they went crazy with bonito flakes today. They were either cleaning their pantry or trying to conceal something in our food bowls. But there was definitely a bonito flake party!

Service is better during lunch. I never have to wait long for my food the times I've been here maybe because they're more considerate of the working lunch crowd? I should come here for happy hour one of these days. Want to come with?",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,4,4,hOcEJBkt2giMM35vJ6LIlg

Starving and puzzled where to gorge myself and eat my feelings. Remembering my sister lived by this great sushi place with a reverse Happy Hour, we decided to meet at Yummy Grill & Sushi.

Immediately entering, I was greeted with ""Moshi, moshi"" by all of the staff and sat down with my sister.  Immediately a server came over, greeted us, took our drink orders, and handed us menus. We ordered the garlic edamame; the MOST delicious stuff, ever. I ordered a second round. I wanted to lick the extra sauce left over in it. I also had a bowl of their Miso Soup, excellent as well. 

Let's get to the sushi. Since it was happy hour (4 PM - 6 PM Sunday through Thursday/ 10 PM - 1 AM everyday),  rolls are priced as low as $2. All happy hour sushi contains 4 pieces and they aren't extra small pieces either. Our drinks arrived with a free portion of their veggie pancake. It had a nice, delicate flavor. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and avocado on top twice (if you've never tried this, do, it's heaven) and they didn't charge me extra (how RARE is that). The shrimp tempura crunch roll was divine, we ordered that twice as well. My sister got an eel roll, which she loved (I love eel sauce, just can't handle the texture. I tried it, it tasted amazing, but let her finish it). We order a Philly roll, which was yummy, you can't go wrong with creme cheese, salmon, and avocado. I especially like that it was fresh salmon. Some sushi places use salmon that has that smokey taste to it and it just ruins it for me. The garlic albacore came with the garlic sauce on the side; the sauce was so good I wanted to spoon the rest of little bowl of it like soup. The Japanese Lasagna was also AMAZING! Warm and perfect. My sister and I had about 7/8 rolls, 2 orders of that garlic edamane, and miso soup, total damage: $41 and change and we were stuffed to the gills! Our server was very attentive and answered all of my silly questions (and trust me, I have a lot of them). 

This particular night they had a lot of fresh seafood options, the board read: O'Toro, Blu fin Tuna from Spain, Nodokuro, Sayori, Live Uni, Scallos, Octopus Legs, Abalone, and Lobster. They have a variety of non-sushi dishes from a variety of Asian cultures. The place is small, but has a family like feel.

Walking in, the staff is always quick to greet and seat you, and I think we've been fortunate enough to always come at a good time.  It never seems to be overcrowded.

I eat a lot of sushi, and it's easy to get familiar with the taste, or find something that really stands out.  The rolls here are flavorful, and fresh tasting, and it makes ordering additional rolls a little too easy.  The nice thing about these rolls is that they fill you up without making you feel stuffed or like you've gorged and are going to regret it later.  Some sushi doesn't always fly with me.  This has remained consistently pleasant.

Also of note is their sake.  The have a sampler that offers fiji apple, plum, and raspberry.  Honestly, I can't recommend one over another.  They're all good, and like the sushi, they don't overwhelm.  You will likely feel comfortable after a few, and really that's the way I prefer it.  We had a dinner party tonight, and bought a full bottle of the plum assortment.  Whee-ha.  No complaints.

As mentioned earlier, the staff is nice.  There are certain sushi places that always want you to try samples from the chef.  We've tried these salty little pancake type appetizers that were a nice filler, and tonight, they wanted us to try this smoked fish head platter.  I appreciate the thoughtfulness.  What I did try was actually quite good, as it came with this vinegaresque sauce, but push comes to shove, I don't think it's going to be a regular thing.  Still, it was a brave, new experience, and I like to be nudged out of the comfort zone once in a while.  I blame the sake.

A few times in, I'm consistently pleased.  It's consistently good, which means a lot, has a great overall flavor, and the staff are attentive and friendly.

5517494,2016-01-02,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"For the past couple years, husband and I would come here as a little ""date night"" while our 2 eldest are in their faith formation class. We have an hour and 15 mins to kill, so why not kill it by killing some sushi. 

This isn't a sushi place that offers all you can eat so don't come in expecting to AYCE it. They do have happy hours which I think is something like M-Th 4-6pm and then 10pm-1am? Then Fridays and weekends are just from 10pm-1am.  Don't quote me on it because we never make happy hour anyway. My husband is the sashimi type guy and he always loves how fresh and tender his sashimi comes out as well as how fresh his sushi tastes. You can tell their head chef takes pride in what he serves and does his best to pick the best fishes, etc...he can get his hands on. 

I, on the other hand, always orders the philly tempura and the salmon skin roll. I say they have one of the better salmon skin rolls and philly tempuras. I love how they are not greedy with the salmon skin, and it isn't stale. I sure have had some chewy salmon skin at other sushi spots, but here.. oh no no. I've also tried their spicy tuna thanks to the husband and that is also deeeelish! 

Their garlic edamame is delicious too! I LOVE edamame so I always appreciate edamame that isn't overcooked and properly seasoned. Also, with your order they serve a complimentary korean pancake. I LOVE that! Not only because I love korean pancakes, but impromptu date night also includes a baby and a toddler so the pancake is a sure way to shush the toddler up quick. Lol. Sure have the word love in here a lot.

What really has us coming back is not only are the sushi we order always great, but my husband loves that they offer Orion beer. It is one of his top favorite beer.

4 stars for their sushi. The rice ratio is perfect! Rice is never mushy and old tasting. The quality Chef Eric drives in regards to his fish and seafood are top notch! My only gripe is that in the hours we are able to come...it is a tad busy, so the service we receive isn't horrible, it just lacks. Getting water refilled is almost a mission and the place isn't even big at all so there shouldn't be no reason why we have to flag someone down for water, extra napkins, or even our bill. 

I would never go in there with all 6 of us because the lack of space in there for our family size would be an inconvenience and I don't believe they have tables accommodating all 6 of us. 

Personally, I definitely recommend giving this place a try, but I highly advise you leave infant car seats/strollers in the vehicle. If you come in with a large party, most likely you'll be seated seperately. This place is more of a chill with a couple of your friends type of spot.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,0,0,4,ZWy01_W_uRY-zxFhYQZ41Q
5528486,2013-03-09,1,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"I have to be honest, I was a little disappointed in my experience here. It was ok, but not great. The lunch special was $13 and included three choices off a select menu. We received a complimentary pancake, and the lunch menu includes miso soup, which was tasty but not amazing.  The lunch menu included things like edamame and egg roll, which are so small they seem to be complete wastes of a selection. The rolls on that menu are half rolls, of course, and the bowls are 3/4 rice. The tuna roll didn't seem very flavorful to me, though I was glad to see the rolls weren't mostly rice like I've seen at a lot of places in Vegas.

The atmosphere is nice enough, it is extremely small, just the small bar area and then about 5 tables. The service is efficient and polite. I mentioned as soon as we placed our drink order that I had the yelp check-in offer for free house saki, but forgot to double check the bill and we were charged for it.

I noticed most of the amazing reviews are for the live options, so I'd like to go back and try some of them, because altogether my experience there was pleasant but didn't blow my mind.",-9RHYKu7u8eXrL1oTu36_w,3,0,3,taLRy-oCUAE1QQvawf7N7w

5558018,2014-01-02,2,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"Upon the chef's recommendation, a medium size sashimi plate was served.  However, it is unsatisfactory to my standard.  
The temperature of the sashimi was slightly warmer than it should be; I couldn't even breakdown the tendon part of the fish by chewing. (1/5)

I didn't enjoy the dash of the kimchi sauce on one of the fish; it desensitized your taste bud to the fish.  

Wasabi was either those tube or the power mixed; I expected fresh wasabi with this price.  (2.5/5)

The miso soup ,which was water down too much for taste, was complimented with tofu cube and wakame (seaweed).  (2.5/5)

Age tofu's (or fries tofu) sauce was too over-powering with sweetness; the flavor and aroma of fish flakes didn't arise to compliment the tofu.  (2/5)

The plate was chipped which should not been served for sanitation reason.  (-5/5)

Temperature is the key to the sashimi and sushi not only for the reason of taste but sanitation as well.

We ended up getting the japanese lasagna roll it was yummy it tasted pretty similar to lasagna, the one thing I didn't like about the roll was that it was pretty darn messy and we were having a hard time taking one piece out at a time. We also had the tomo devil roll, and this one was pretty yummy too, but what was a bit disappointing was that the roll wasn't as spicy as I anticipated. I'm a big fan of spicy sushi but this one wasn't spicy one bit considering the fact that it had sliced jalapenos, spicy sauce, and some spicy dipping sauce it came with. With all that it wasn't one bit spicy and I was disappointed for being false advertised. One other thing I didn't like about this place was the fact that it took a very long time to get our food, but I what I usually take into consideration is that if the foods good, it shouldn't matter how long it takes to come out. My son got the kids bento box with french fries, which was kinda weird, but hey, he loved it. Price-wise this place is decent but the portions for the price didn't fit well together.

I would come back here to try other sushi's because I saw a lot of sushi's I want to try, but the fact that I'm not from this area might keep me from coming back to this place.

I got the tempura bowl -- crisp shrimp and vegetables on a rice bowl.  My second item was yellow fin sashimi -- large pieces, carved before my eyes.  My third item was a spicy tuna roll -- great stuff.  The servings were very generous and filling.  I'll be back!",N3YS4t0RSve4SeO_89Iurg,0,0,4,R4JJwutt_jytPJmMdB6wPA

5786474,2015-07-24,0,DkZuVzYuylBanEsWK7mNGw,"I'll start off with the positive... I REALLY appreciated how Yummy (at least on paper) attempts to create creative, tasty rolls you may not find at other places,(their menu has rolls boasting lobster...scallops, hot sauced crab!.. with a playful spin on names...""that's what she say""...""tastes like exgirlfriend""..etc..

Unfortunately the talk didn't measure up to the walk.  We started with the gyoza (oddly sold as ""5""...a strange number for a couple wishing to share)..small and heavily fried, is suspect any flavor they once had would have survived better if treated with less oil.   In fairness, the server DID give us an extra free of charge when they sensed the irony...As an attempt to try the breadth of experience at this new place for us, we ordered 4 distinctly different rolls.  Reading the menu, one has visions of overflowing crab, succulent lobster, crunchy tempura, fresh avocado, etc....yet once the rolls hit the table, we noticed a trend...ALL the rolls had the same fast food ""krab salad""...when we asked the server where the scallops were on one roll for example, the chef replied ""it's in there!'...soon their mantra to ALL the rolls...tempura shrimp?..""it's in there!!""....spicy lump crab?..""it's in there!!""....lobster?...""it's in there!!""....ok, I get it!  At least they are efficient!  If you like the wool pulled over your eyes and the same old thing roll after roll, there is plenty of parking in the strip mall....if you want creative sushi, there are other places in town.",GCdTEZumAyf2eMR3wCAo0w,0,0,3,4FY1VwXxHecvJ4jik61PKA

But I don't live in Vegas, so that explains why I don't come more often, but I really should, because Eric the chef and owner has kept up the quality and his passion in the food.  He has now opened up a separate dining room next to the original location, and he's focused on only the omakase now, which is good for us the diners, because you want a sushi chef who's dedicated to the craft.  The price of the omakase has now gone up to $120, but the quality has been maintained so I don't mind at all.  You do need to call ahead to reserve for omakase.  I called the night of, luckily someone else had cancelled so I was accommodated.  So happy!  I remain convinced that this is the best sushi I've had in the US for the money you pay.  And when you find out the chef is preparing your fish with a $4000 knife, that $120 you're paying for the meal seems so worth it haha.",hXa7kc9pcLP9U3AQ5gyk0A,0,0,5,SH2UBSe6JJZmEZM1hOeLKg

We started out with a very good bottle of sake, I forgot the name. We had the toro- best melt taste of all!
amaebi - sweetest shrimp that I ever had
blue fun tuna - super soft meat
 live scallop - fresh as it can get
abalone - one of the best I had
uni - creamiest uni up to date
hairy crab - awesome tasting of crab with high price to it
They also offer other live items and they have imported fish. 

Overall great experience. The staff was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu. The chef was friendly also even cheered sake with us! Sushi was top of the line the best I've had. Not even back home in Hawaii compares to this place's sushi! I have yet to find one.

I first stumbled upon this place when I worked up the street and wanted sushi for lunch. Since I live nearby too, whenever I wanted a quick roll or two, ok it's always two, (don't judge me) I would come here. The prices are decent and the food freshness is one of the better ones in town for sure. The workers are very hospitable. Keep in mind, this place is very small so you will feel a little squished. I always get the crunchy California rolls and California rolls, my parents get the bento boxes and my lil one gets her Tuna rolls. We are never disappointed when we leave. They do offer AYCE but for some reason the two rolls always seem to fill me up just fine. It's a great neighborhood restaurant to visit when you are in the need for a Japanese food fix.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,14,14,5,UY7n2mqgDcQSzWhNsooQ3A

Came for dinner the other night, and quickly wanted to comment on the baked dishes.  (Since I am pregnant and must abstain from raw dishes- it gave me a chance to try other items from the menu). 

Although I was salivating watching my husband enjoy his spicy tuna hand roll, and a complimentary sushi that the chef prepared for him- my volcano roll and seaweed salad were DELICIOUS. 

We also shared a Red Snapper Teriyaki combination box and we practically licked that plate clean.  Perhaps when I am no longer pregnant, I will order a baked dish again.  Who am I kidding? I am craving their uni and ame ebi like crazy!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,7,6,4,Vu0kfKOdvkw-m18_w1dkPg
