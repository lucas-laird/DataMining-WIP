389549,2016-07-05,1,S-FDDYNks1fXSoddvW9WvQ,"My first time trying Firehouse Subs today. (7/1) I was excited for the reviews and the meatball sub. Honestly, when I was kid, we got the best meatball subs from Sam's Club. I haven't found many places here in Vegas that offer a meatball sub since. 

Consider the reviews were great, we decided to head on there for our Friday lunch. Walking in, people greeted us. Friendly, cool. Smells great in there too! I was a little confused on where we order but once I looked up, I saw the sign that said, Order Here. Pretty obvious. One person in front of us in line, didn't take long. 

We walked up to the cashier, Kyra and wasn't even greeted. Bummer. I said hello and I got a mere smirk from her. She stood there while my husband finished deciding on what he wanted. I was set on trying the meatball sub. The whole time we stood in front of her, she didn't say anything to us. At first, I thought maybe we're doing this wrong? For a second I felt like a idiot. I've never been here before. I'm not used to this surrounding! What do I do?! Why isn't she helping?! Anxiety, over a sub. (How lame.) I decided to speak. I asked for the meatball sub. I was asked what size. Putting all my faith into a new place and the great reviews, I go for the large. My husband sets on a turkey/cranberry (yawn, boring.) We pay and we sit down. No thank you, thanks for coming. No nothing. Just a total of our change back. 

It didn't take long for our food to come up. Not even 5 minutes, I'd say. The girl who gave us or food was a lot more pleasant than the cashier. Told us the meatball was on bottom and not to turn the bag any other way cause it'll spill. Thanks for the tip! Because my husband totally would've done just that! We got home ate our food. And it's was delicious! I ordered the large but she put down a medium which was a huge disappointed since the sub was so good! My pickle was wrapped in a little baggy, placed under the sub. It was a great pickle. I just wish it wasn't warmed up. I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the cashier. Everyone else was great. Even those working on the subs going back and forth, working on steamers was friendlier than her. She seemed to more perky with others behind us, which is what got to me. Like, why didn't we get service like that? Did I do something wrong? As much as I loved the sub. My first experience was a bummer due to her customer service. I hate to let one person ruin it for me but it did. I might go back after a couple months months  or so. But not anytime soon. Maybe a location closer to my work than home. Maybe better customer service? Because they seem to have some of it going on.",zjaXMIMjaj7eHFM4-20DNQ,1,2,2,SJNG-WZfAlBkiF9T4CD5rQ

She eyeballs my coupons, which I didn't realize were expired (a co-worker gave me a freebie medium sandwich coupon raving I had to try this place) and tosses them on the counter in front of me smirking saying ""you can't use any of these"". No biggie, the sandwiches are 10 bucks or less so I go for a philly. As I wait for my food I'm literally stepping over pieces of bread on the floor, nearly sat on remnants of a salad, and had to wipe a seat down to wait on my sandwich to come off the assembly. In all, the experience was mediocre. The place was not at all crowded. One thing I can say about the infamous Subway, the service is more than likely to be great- even if the food sucks.

1634353,2015-07-14,11,S-FDDYNks1fXSoddvW9WvQ,"I'd like to give this place 5 stars. The food has been very good each time I have visited but the problem is with the service. Inside has been dirty on the last few visits and I don't know how many employees actually work in a shift because there were several employees sitting in the dining area eating and the guy who took my order was eating a brownie. This dude actually had the nerve to finish his brownie and get a drink before taking my payment. The counter was covered in crumbs and trash mostly around the cash register. I also placed a phone order and when I got there they said they accidentally gave it to someone else so I had to wait for them to finish eating so they could re-make my food. The employees here really need some training because I love the subs here yet have been going down the street to Subway since they have been not necessarily better tasting but just more consistent and clean than Firehouse. I don't get the amount of employees that were hanging around eating and tossing stuff. It was like a middle school lunch room or something.

The food is good. I like the firehouse meatball a lot. It's got good flavor and the meatballs are very good. I ask for it sweet and spicy and it doesn't disappoint. I recommend this sandwich to any meatball parm lover. They have other sandwiches that my wife enjoys but I just get the meatball. Especially good in the winter when it's cold out since the sandwich us toasted. They do have a nice size patio if you want to eat outside.

Me and my son always eat each other food just to see what we will order the next time and we both decided the meatball sub was the best. Sooooo, yesterday I was to tired to cook and asked my son 'What do you want to eat""? He said ""lets go back and get that Firehouse Meatball sub"". I said no problem. However, there was a problem. Our sandwiches did not look and taste like the ones we had a few days earlier. The meatballs tasted like very old meat. The wheat bread looked like it was sitting there all day. It was not burnt but very dark with spots on it. So I ended up just picking through my food. I didn't complain because I know they can do a better job because they previously did. I also came around 9:45 pm when they were about to close. Maybe they were so into getting off that they felt they didn't have to put a lot of energy into giving us a memorable sandwich.

2910326,2014-04-13,1,S-FDDYNks1fXSoddvW9WvQ,"I regularly eat at Firehouse by my office for lunch, so was excited to have one open by home. Unfortunately it seems they might be going through some growing pains. 

Minus one star for putting tomatoes on a sandwich clearly ordered without tomatoes (I checked the receipt & it was noted properly) and minus another for an EXTRAORDINARILY long wait time even though it appeared to be a slow night. I've never had to wait that long at any Firehouse even during a busy peak lunch period. It made no sense to me at all. Lots of chatter behind the counter though - at least the staff seemed to be enjoying themselves at the expense of my time. 

They also had a comparatively scant hot sauce offering, and what they did have had LOTS of empty bottles. It's all the little things Firehouse does that make it so good, and this location is doing none of them yet. Maybe once they learn how to pay attention to detail and start caring about empty condiment bottles and special orders it will be a real Firehouse subs, but for now it's just another hit & miss sub shop with lackluster service and employees who care more about socializing with one another than doing their jobs. Too bad - I had such high hopes because other Firehouse locations are just superb, but I guess they've had more time to work out their problems. I'll give this location another try in a month or so & see if they get it right then, but they sure aren't now. 

Oh - and Yelp is wrong on the times they're open too. I know they're open until 10 at least on Saturday, probably Friday and other days too. Yelp lists closing time as 9 across the board.",6mQkpckXXYRIAid116M56w,2,0,2,2GOybnbW6bDdTxs9-JXEcQ

They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it ""fully involved"" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one ""sweet and spicy"" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,44,42,4,Was5oYJQhk3rwQT9CUuLYg

She offered to pick up the chili and personally made sure it was amazingly fresh and it surly was. I have to admit it was probably the best chili (besides my chili I make at home :)) that I've had all year. It was hot and fresh and absolutely enjoyable. This is the thing I love to see and experience when spending my hard earned money with a business. When they admit they made a mistake and correct it without question is the business qualities that keep us coming back.

4655451,2014-07-02,7,S-FDDYNks1fXSoddvW9WvQ,"Firehouse extinguishes poor quality overpriced subs. There is a fire spreading into certain Subways and across certain Port of Subs. It is a fire made up of the elements of too little for too much $. Not all Subways, but certain Subways put too little meat on their heros. And all the Port of Subs I have been to are overpriced. This gets me on fire. But Firehouse Subs has served me quality and delicious subs at decent prices.

  When I stepped inside the North Decatur at 215 Firehouse Subs it was my second visit to one of their locations. Months earlier after experiencing the Durango at Warm Springs Firehouse Subs, I was up to visiting this location with my brother. It is a location in the Winco/ Target parking lot. In a way, this is a glorified eatery for Winco and Target. When I walked into Firehouse Subs, I walked into you guess it, a restaurant that resembles a firehouse. This is not a theme restaurant made up at random. In 1994, two former firefighter brothers Robin and Chris Sorensen founded it in Jacksonville, Florida. The restaurant is fairly large with plate glass windows to the left overlooking Decatur Boulevard and a counter to the right for ordering the subs. The employees at the counter were friendly and professional.

  The majority of their heros include meats and cheeses and are steamed hot and placed on a toasted bun. The medium subs range from $5.79 to $6.09. An additional $2.29 upgrades it to a medium combo whereas an additional $2.54 upgrades it to a large combo. For the record, I noticed a slight difference between the medium and large combos. Both size combos include a fountain Coke beverage and bag of chips. Firehouse utilizes the new state-of-the-art Coke machines that feature over 100 flavors of Coke. Peach Fanta and Raspberry Coke taste good with a sub. According to Wikipedia,  Firehouse Subs is the first national franchise to utilize the state-of-the-art Coke machines in all franchises. As far as the subs, Firehouses' s selection is smoking. They include the Hook & Ladder, Firehouse Meatball, New York Steamer,  Italian, Firehouse Hero, and Engineer. I ordered the Firehouse Hero. It burns away some of the competitor's heros. The hero was warm and filled with substance. The substance between the buns was USDA Choice roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and provolone.

   When certain sub shops that charge high prices for so little gets me on fire, Firehouse extinguishes this bad taste. The deal is there currently only twelve locations in the Las Vegas market. And the deal is I plan to return to one of these locations in the future.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,12,4,VF_uwabR0Lv5YKNRQkcwAg
