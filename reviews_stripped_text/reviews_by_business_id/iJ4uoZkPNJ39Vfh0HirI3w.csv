They like their ramen and have tried a few ramen places in the valley, but they especially liked this one... And they're Asain. So that's worth something. The broth is not too rich with just the right amount of saltiness. The sauce for the potstickers was great too- not a quick and easy soy. It had a good viscosity and mild sweetness. I like that they offer a whiskey-ramen pairing. It's a great way to try different Japanese Whiskeys. If you happen to be Downtown, check it out.",3jGAIGtktbbv3rMpU08Sew,0,0,5,v9HQ4SrhX0YS_2MXBsE91Q
153861,2015-04-27,0,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"There is Ramen Downtown!

This is a casual/trendy little place on the Ogden Avenue side of ""The Ogden."" Nice decor with a couple large paintings, hanging light bulbs, and some really cool copper bar chairs!

Pot Stickers - I started off with the pork pot stickers which were very good! Soft on one side and a little crispy on the other, just the way I like 'em. 10/10 would order again!

Ramen - I had a thin noodle ramen with tonkotsu broth. All ramen comes with green onion, braised pork, sprouts, and a soy egg. I then added corn,  an extra egg (it's a half egg so I ended up with a whole egg!), and spicy meat.  The noodles were nice and firm and the soy egg had lots of flavor, really good! On the down-side: the raman wasn't as hot as I would like, on both the temperature and spice scale (I guess I could have just asked for it to be a little more spicy.)  Next time I'll try the miso but overall it was good, I'd give it a 7/10.

5 Hand Rolls - I didn't order hand rolls but I was there while things slow and they were cooking and photographing food. They made the rolls, took a few photos, and then asked me if I wanted them? SURE! Yellowtail, Tuna, Cucumber, Crab, and Salmon. I was so full from the soup and stickers that I only ate two and a half of the rolls, tuna, salmon and a bite of crab ... pretty good!

Of the three or four members of the staff I interacted with, all were very friendly and helpful, making it a good dining experience! Not the best ramen I've ever had but good enough that I'll be going back!",fv0ztLKB1WwFmF3wYecbIg,0,0,4,HlNGxVV2UM3Uxm6vpaxWfw

We had miso ramen, chicken katsu slider, ahi poke, and gyoza. Miso ramen soup was colder than I prefer. The bean sprouts and green onion were raw and the soup wasn't hot enough to get rid of the raw onion taste. Way too much green onions in the ahi poke. The sauce for the poke was great though. Didn't care for the green garnish on the gyoza but the gyoza itself with the sauce was delicious. Nothing special about the chicken katsu slider.",MCpb8j_NbKgjPj_rNdOFjw,0,0,3,3CX1rzreoZ3Xni0Bt-An3g

206588,2015-11-07,0,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"Tried this Ramen place by my work today and recommendations by my friends. As a former server/bartender for many years I am pretty understandable in regards to what happens when you get busy. I was greeted at the door and they recommend I sit at the bar. The bartender told me he'd be right with me. About 5 to 7 minutes later, he acknowledged me and then asked if I was ready to order. Provided him my order of Edamame and my choice of Ramen and then he dissapeared. Checked on my food once halfway through my meal and never refilled my drink. 

There was two people at the bar with myself included. The Edamame was the best part of my meal and the Ramen was very bland. I have to say that I was highly dissapointed and not worth the money I spent. I still provided a 15% tip even though the service and food wasn't that great, because I know as food servers/bartenders live on gratuity, but I would never recommend this Ramen bar to anyone. I may go back again if I am ever Downtown, but will not go out of my way to come.

Great selection of whiskeys

Tonight was quite the opposite. Showed up at 10:15 to order 2 appetizers and 2 hand rolls (to go), only to be told the kitchen was partially closed. I changed my order to accommodate the restaurant. The (tall blonde) bartender / server was extremely distracted by a 3 person party at the bar, and was (in my opinion) rude /& neglecting to her other guests that were dining in. After getting the food home, we find that the hand rolls were not the kind we ordered, and were less than subpar in quality (mushy, ginger was dry, Wasabi dry).

I regret only having the one that it came with. We didn't drink a lot, but we did have the coconut rice pudding drink that actually tasted like coconut rice pudding.

He was super friendly and was willing to chat with us about how he likes his ramen and what exactly goes into the drink and about his aspirations to be an MMA fighter.

They take reservations which is great, but a down side is that we were dinning with a baby and a toddler and they do not have high chairs here, so it is not a great place to take kids.

The atmosphere is cute, and the servers are friendly. 

A bit about our meal:
My mother and I ordered drinks, I had the sugar plum fairy = very pretty, but tasted like lemonade, not worth the $8. I can't remember the name of my mother's drink, but it was the one with tea = the first few sips tasted like a shot of whiskey, then once she added some lemon she said she could taste the tea.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers, and they were all amazing! The tempura was great (the broccoli was amazing) ditto to the mushroom spring rolls. We got the chicken bite for my toddler, she loved them and the bite I stole tasted great. My husband polished off 2 orders of the pork gyoza, so I think those must have been good too!

As far as main courses go, my mother and hubby ordered the teriyaki chicken, it seemed pretty light on the chicken. My sister and I ordered the ramen. Both were OK...I added the spicy meat to mine which I regret because the spice over powered all the other flavors.

I agree with a lot of the other reviews that say this place is great for the small plates, not so much for the ramen sadly. Also, though nice, the servers weren't very attentive",Y1SsexuLbvH4N1VTqu2ecQ,0,0,4,Rj8D-o9bc3DDKyCUb7Htdw

as someone who has eaten A LOT of ramen, i would say this ramen was above average for an american ramen house. it is absolutely delicious, and their approach to choosing your noodles/broth/add-ins was a nice homage to the automated ramen-ordering machines of japan. 

the appetizers we ordered were all delicious, especially the chili garlic edamame and the pork gyoza. yum! the whiskey & ramen pairing for $20 is a great deal, and perfect for those who can resist the alluring temptress that is draft asahi (yes, you know who i'm talking about). 

my only complaint was that it took us an hour to get our main dishes once we ordered. our server was great about checking in and updating us on an ETA but an hour is WAY too long to wait for any food, let alone ramen, which is one of the quickest dishes to crank out.

I had the miso broth with thick noodles, and it was better than any ramen I'd had in my hometown of Seattle (Samurai, Aloha, Kukai, etc.) Space is cute, service was fantastic, and I don't know what they do to their egg on top of the ramen -- it's usually a throwaway for me, ok at best, but here it was the most delicious egg I'd ever had! I also had their mule made with Japanese whiskey, and it was phenomenal. Their whiskey and ramen combo for $20 is a great deal, too!

My only gripe -- their whiskey menu is small. I mean, if you're billing yourself as a whiskey place, you should probably have more than around 20 whiskeys. They had maybe 5 or 6 Japanese whiskeys on the menu, which is fantastic (however they were out of 2, including Yamazaki), an Irish whiskey or two, a Scotch or two, and the rest American whiskeys, if I recall correctly. I was pretty surprised by the lack of selection.",pPYnCknK0qz_eFYEK57Png,1,0,5,MCCbEtg58ze8VL-EITFu4g

We were hungry and wanted to find something on Fremont to eat outside of pizza (I love pizza rock!) tacos (great spot in container park...forgot the name), and pub food. 

The host and ambiance were great. The restaurant has a moderately hipster feel. The food was ok..we ordered veggie pot stickers as an appetizer and veggie ramen. Both items came out very quickly, but lacked flavor. I'm a pho fan, so I was anticipating some flavoring in the broth but it was a little bland for my taste. 

I hate writing bad reviews or focusing on a negative, but our waitress gets two thumbs down. She took our drink order as soon as we sat down, along with the appetizer order. The appetizer came out in 5min then the Ramen bowls came out 10minutes later..still drink-less. The restaurant was 50% empty so it was no reason why it should have taken over 20 minutes to receive drinks. The manager came to our table and I asked about the drinks. He got the attention of our waitress, who was socializing with a coworker, and she promptly brought our drinks.

I will probably come back because I feel this place is a great addition to Fremont..hopefully I can write about a better experience.",6LdB0Gfh9wc97urNuoOZiA,2,1,2,s2HSi33Z4W8nsRYY2po2lg

My husband and I dropped in for dinner, first off parking across the street is $12 flat fee after 6pm, so if you can manage to get into El Cortez for parking, you better be prepare to pay up or drive around looking for parking.  That is the only downer...

So here's our menu for the evening:
*Shrimp Pot Stickers- the filling was plentiful with nice size of chopped shrimp; the pot sticker skin was nice and chewy and sturdy.

*kimchi- it was spicy and juicy, thinking about it makes my mouth water; it had just the right amount of sauce without it being too water down; the flavor was spicy, tangy and just enough sweetness to counter all the spicy/tanginess.

*Ramen Bowl-  I chose the thin noodle with shoyu broth that comes with braised pork and soy cured egg.  Usually when I get shoyu broth, it's either too salty or not enough flavor, but this broth was perfect, just the right amount of balanced flavor.  I will admit the noodle was a bit soggy/soft for my liking but the braised pork was tender and melts in your mouth.  And I LOVED their cured egg.  I wish they gave more than one...lol!

This place is great and since its not a chain you can really tell the effort they put into all the details.  You customize your order by choosing your noodle thickness, then your broth, then your toppings.  I like to order thick // tonkatsu // extra egg + charsiu.  What I really like about Itsy Bitsy is that you don't even have to be a ramen head to dine here; the menu has a super extensive appetizer, robata, and rice bowl menu.  Must try: japanese street corn, gyoza, and the soy paper rolls. 

I heard they're doing happy hour now, and although I haven't been in for it yet I think it would be a great starting point for drinks + a snack on girls night out or on a date. 

This place is also a lot ""hipper"" than any other ramen spot I've been to in Vegas.

Soooo many food selections here and of course cocktails if you partake. I have never liked a bourbon or whisky so I'm not the one to review on the cocktail part.

Veggie tempura, garlic edename, mushroom spring rolls, veggie hand rolls...I love it all!

The place is beautiful. Awesome open kitchen and small, but with enough room to feel like you've got some space. Japanese cartoon style art and some clever design touches.

Bathroom is cool too.

We each ordered a different style ramen bowl. Upon finishing our meal, we agreed that the spicy meat is an essential addition. Also the seaweed, because it makes everything delicious. Always.

The egg in the ramen is killer. So good! But the best best thing was the veggie potstickers. Amazing! Best I've ever had in my life.

Ramen was ok. They got our dish wrong and gave us someone else's but quickly fixed it and gave us new ones and let us keep the other to take home ( we have it to a homeless fellow outside who loved it)

I'd just find their use or sriracha  to make something spicy a bit lazy. I hate sriracha and now all my food tastes of it. It wasn't a super strong flavour of it but enough for me to know they didn't just add some fresh red chillies. 

Service great. Noodles were great. Gyoza was good.

The entrance is a bit weird in my opinion, you have to go through the entrance of the hotel to then enter the return to, and only to enter through the bar area and the dining area in the back. The decor was nice, the lighting was a little dark for my taste but overall pleasant. The lady ordered a misogyny Ramen and I ordered a shoyu ramen. All Ramen come with bean sprouts, green onions, half a soft boiled egg, and chashu. Any other toppings is an extra $1, which to me is pricey as the base Ramen goes for $10.50. So once that was ordered we got an order of Japanese sweet potatoes. Being from Hawaii these are just sweet potatoes, the so called ""sweet potatoes"" here are yams. But anyway the potatoes were cooked well and had a miso butter sauce of sorts that was very different but pretty tasty overall. Now our Ramen arrived, it was kind of a let down to be honest. The broth for both of our ramens were very bland. We got it to taste decent after altering it with shoyu and some togadashi. We got the thin noodles and they were what seemed to be over cooked. No texture, no chewy goodness, just plan regular old noodles. Kinda though the saimin packages I make at home are better. So with that said we liked the Japanese sweet potatoes and we are not impressed by the Ramen at all. I can say I will be back, but if changes are made I will javelin another go. For the money there are far better options, plus there is no fighting trying to find and pay for parking (crazy but I guess the city has to make money somehow) the employees seemed friendly and maybe a little too friendly as we waited about 15mins before we got our check because our waitress was bust chit chatting with other tables.

Looking to satisfy my craving for asian comfort food, I dragged my boyfriend to downtown LV for ramen despite the 114 degree weather. Entering the restaurant, I felt that I had walked into an upscale bar that is more accustomed to the likes of downtown LA; a hip oasis in the midst of the fast-food desert.  However, on food alone, Itsy Bitsy comes in at a lowly 2 stars. One word to describe the food here: SALTY. We were greeted at the entrance by a very friendly host who inquired about our stay in Vegas, and took the time to make recommendations as well as describe some of the items on the menu. Per his recommendation, we ordered the shrimp potstickers as an appetizer, followed by the miso ramen with thick noodles, a shoyu egg, tofu, bean sprouts, and green onions. 

The shrimp potstickers were folded into cute packages and were perfectly crispy. The filling, however, was the first indication of the chef's heavy-handed use of salt.

The ramen came in a medium-sized bowl with the perfect ratio of soup: noodles. I felt that they were slightly skimpy on the toppings--there was probably a total of 4 tofu cubes in my soup. At first bite, I was overwhelmed by the saltiness of the broth; it was seriously as if someone had poured an entire cup of salt into my soup. Additionally, the miso broth wasn't the type of miso that I was familiar with (i.e. the miso soup that you order at Japanese restaurants). Instead, it was an oily, rich broth with a very pungent flavor that didn't sit with me quite right. The shoyu egg was also unbelievably salty, even more so than my miso broth, to the point where it was almost inedible. This ramen's only saving grace were the noodles themselves--they were perfectly al dente with just the right amount of chewiness. I finished the noodles without touching the soup because I knew that my blood pressure would probably skyrocket if I attempted to drink that saltwater broth. 

It saddens me to have to give Itsy Bitsy such a poor review because the concept is just so darn cool. Unfortunately, I would only return to try their drinks and other appetizers.",45hG-gwjr5kjjnPy2XcuTA,0,2,3,bGO1r8b6VtDutCS8jKoVWg

After a couple of cocktails at the DT Lounge during my birthday weekend one of the party members suggested this place for some late(ish) night ramen. We walked the short distance and were seated relatively fast despite it being full. This is mainly a ramen bar from what I gather, but they did offer some simple sushi and Asian inspired appetizers on their menu. I opted for ramen and wiskey selection $20.00. You are able to customize the ramen any way you please even though it is a pre set menu item. The whiskey, due to my old age and two kids waiting to torment me the following morning was passed on to a friend within the party, but the ramen was excellent. They were able to combine it and make a tonkotsu shoyu broth vs one or the other. I should have added extra chashu pork because it only came with two pieces. Other than that, the broth was on point and all the fixins I would have gotten at Monta or Sora were there minus the 40 minute wait.

1808592,2015-08-07,8,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"For a trendy downtown spot, the food was a bit better than expected... which isn't really saying much, to be honest. It's a passable spot to kill a ramen craving but you're better off driving out to Chinatown for the good stuff. That said, the modern-industrial style and kooky art have a distinct charm and the service is attentive.

TONKOTSU RAMEN: Opted for the thick noodle, which was decently chewy, and added nori. I was a bit taken aback to receive a giant handful of bean sprouts in my bowl... this isn't pad thai, so I'm not sure why it was included. It seems this was used in place of bamboo shoots? Soy-marinated egg was cooked perfectly, though I prefer a full egg instead of a half. Broth itself was rich but lacked depth. Would like to see more varieties added to the menu (black garlic anyone?) that they can perhaps execute better.
HANDROLLS: Available at about $5/pop, spicy or non, these can be removed from the menu. Fish is fresh but the rolls themselves are basic, nothing special, and a little overpriced. Stick to classic apps like gyoza or edamame. 

Service from bartender Jacqueline was friendly and quick, overall the staff seems to run a tight ship and everyone was in a really positive mood.

It took over five minutes from when we were seated for someone to come over for our order, technically drink order wasn't really taken and it took over ten minutes to get my sprite.  I ordered the ramen with thin noodles and extra chashu. My friend ordered ramen with thick noodles and extra spicy meat. When the ramen came out the girl asked ""extra chashu?"" and I said me. She put a bowl in front of me and an identical one in front of my friend and we both dug down and picked up noodles. Both bowls had thin noodles. We decided we'd waited too long, whatever we would just go with it.  After we'd gotten a good ways in we discovered we'd apparently had our orders switched (the meat was in the bottom) and I had gotten the spicy meat, oh well, too late to switch to correct. Then we discovered we had the same amount of chashu.  When the bill came we realized why. The extra chashu order hadn't been put in. But the order for the thick noodles which never happened had. The noodles in my bowl had blatantly been cooked with no care. Half of them were in a solid clump I had to work to pry apart into chunks small enough to eat. Obviously the noodles in the clump weren't properly cooked.

So, long wait for any kind of service, long wait to just get a drink, order put in wrong, one order cooked wrong, one order cooked apathetically at best, wrong orders given to us.  The food wasn't good enough to make up for the service failures.

With so many good ramen joints in town there's really no point wasting your time, money, and calories at someplace that makes it obvious they don't' care.",6aJ_WRWa3C3o0A3EXYyEmw,2,0,2,13lXaTpVrNXpMvPNpcsvLA

We ordered beef skewers and garlic edamame to share, a large Asahi, miso ramen with spicy beef for him and the miso ramen with corn for myself. 

The beef skewers were meh, I'll probably pass on it next time. No real wow factor flavor and for the price it just wasn't what I was expecting. The edamame was delicious, super garlicy and flavorful, I'll be ordering this again. My ramen was way too salty for my taste buds and I struggled to eat through half of it. As for the mister, his ramen was better, perhaps the spicy beef diluted the broth a bit, I tried his and it was definitely less salty.

1908379,2016-03-14,0,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"FINALLY got to try this spot out. I work at Jinya so I kinda wanted to compare. First off, the restaurant is small but nicely decorated. A lot of cute paintings. Our table was set up with a plate, chopsticks with cute sayings on each chopstick holder. The menu was pretty straight forward. Small plates, ramen, hand rolls back side beverages/ alcohol. 
Our waitress was friendly. Everyone pretty much did their job nothing over the top or too much. 

We started out with some small plates, the sweet potato and the shrimp Gyoza (potstickers). Both of which were my favorites! I thought the Japanese sweet potato was croquette. But it was actually yam with a semi sweet marinade. I loved it! As for Gyoza, I loved how there were veggie and shrimp options. Being a pescatarian, Gyoza is usually made with pork and I never get to enjoy it. But today I did, with some ramen! 

Ramen- my husband got tonkotsu with thin noodles and I got vegetarian with thick noodles, buttered corn and chili oil. 

Compared to Jinya, the vegetarian ramen here was just ok. They substituted tofu instead of chashu but barely had any other toppings. The broth was ok, and the egg was a bit salty. 
My husband said his broth was salty as well. I asked our waitress before we ordered if their were options to do less salt or any customizations. But none. 
Jinya is able to do any customization with less noodle, less salt, no salt which I prefer. And they just give you a good amount of toppings, especially for our vegetable soup ramen. The additional toppings like buttered corn and chili oil didn't really do much to my ramen.. 

I didn't really expect much, but I'm glad I got to see what this place was all about. The only thing I would come back for is the sweet Potato and Gyoza.",g2_hcKfQW8blEgHcl1mh0A,2,1,3,82hvmML9IqQqZPaNmtdp2Q

Located in a trendy part of town my friend and I decided to go on a Sunday for lunch. We were the only ones in the facility and the place has a very modern and artistic flow. We were seated our waiter took our drink and appetizer orders right away. We ordered the Japanese chicken bites that come with a honey mustard dipping sauce and the pot stickers that come with a spicy soy sauce. After about 20 minutes the appetizers come. The chicken bites are practically popcorn chicken from KFC and the honey mustard dipping sauce is from Newman's Dressings........ I know this because I use it at home all the time. None the less very tasty. The potstickers were pretty yummy as well. 

The waiter then took our ramen orders. I ordered the miso ramen. It had very nice flavor and was just mediocre.

It was probably another 3-4 minutes until she greeted us. Even at that point it was a little half ass as she basically strongly insisted as sit in the bar area than wait 5 minutes for a party to leave.

Dj spinning old school hip hop- check!  

Trendy and interesting space downtown - check! 

Great drinks- check! (They had a really interesting beer selection and an off the beaten path selection of liquor as well) 

Delicious food- check! (More on that in a moment). 

To top all of this off, the beautiful people and hipsters were out in full force- David Guetta walked right past us!

Disclaimer- I had partaken of a few adult beverages by the time we arrived here, but the food was amazing. The dumplings were fresh, hot, and full of meat, and the Raman!!! It was delicious, even without any of the optional add-ons. I could have drank a bowl of the pork broth by itself. The portion size was large, the noodles tasty, and there was a good amount of meat in it.

My only small qualm was that the kitchen must have been in the weeds- it took forever for our food to arrive.

The check said Anastasi, but I think she went by Tasha or something similar.  It's unfortunate that such an up-and-coming restaurant would hire inadequate servers.  Not only was food forgotten, but when it came time to pay the check, we waited for probably twenty minutes with the check sitting ready.  She passed us by many, many times and literally spent time chatting with other tables before finally taking it and also seeming to forget about a friend's dessert, as it was rather late as well.

I got ramen and my husband got the salmon rice bowl, which is actually not on the happy hour menu. We were told that it was by the host so he apologized for his mistake and honored the happy hour prices. I thought this was very professional and the right thing to do under the circumstances. 

Now the ramen. Amazing! I lived in DTLA and have been to great ramen places in Little Tokyo. Now I'm not going to claim I am a ramen expert. It is something that I feel I haven't had enough of in enough places to act like I know what makes for excellent ramen. But I've been to ramen places in LA and Vancouver and this place is probably my favorite. Whether I've developed a taste (craving for this place) for ramen, I don't know. My husband who was never blown away by ramen before loves it here. He enjoyed both his rice bowl and some of my ramen. I have since brought some friends of mine, a couple being foodies and Japanese, and they too love the ramen. 

The salmon bowl was delicious. But the ramen, with the Tonkotsu broth, is a guaranteed pleasurable mouth experience. My LA friends crave their ramen but they're not lucky enough to live as close to Itsy Bitsy as I do.

The happy hour is a great deal. But even if you don't make it there then, the price is good for what you get.",xPqMjZrlX8BKRAyREd5WuA,1,0,5,N3zy-sQYCfWPrREH9cRWFw

We ordered:  

Ramen: Thick noodles, tonkotsu, all the fixings (Chashu, bean sprout, scallion, HALF an egg)-added extra egg and shiitake mushrooms, and they split the bowl up for us, which was super awesome and it looked appetizing when it came out! The chashu wasn't as ""melt in your mouth"" as I'm used to, but it wasn't terrible. I'm usually a shoyu fan (Sora Ramen is my absolute favorite!), but decided to go the tonkotsu route, and it was alright.  As a comparison, I'm of the opinion that Monta Ramens tonkotsu is too salty and just...too...much?  But Itsy Bitsy's tonkotsu was pleasant, though not very flavorful.  We breathed life into the broth by adding chili oil, and was then satisfied with it...with the exception that they charged $1 for extra egg-and that got you another HALF an egg.  I guess it's a personal thang, but give me the entire frakking egg for chrissakes!   Anyhow..

Chicken Katsu Burger: Shaved cabbage, tomato, spiced tonkatsu sauce.  Ok now, this burger tasted SO YUMMY!!  SOOOOOOO YUMMMYYYYY!!  BUT here's the thing, it did not taste very Katsu-esque.  I specifically got the katsu chicken BURGER instead of the ramen version because I wanted to bathe in the katsu sauce I was envisioning in my head.  But what actually came on the burger was more of a sweet wasabi situation. I did not get Katsu at all when I bit in, but because it was delicious, I wasn't disappointed :-)  The dressing that was served on the mixed greens that came with the burger was...fragrantly funky, though not funky as in old/bad/sour, just funky as in..""what the hell is in my mouth, I've never tasted this before"".  

Spicy tuna hand roll:  Pretty basic, came in two pieces, not the highest quality tuna, but not bad either.  

Kizakura Nigori sake: Delicious!  Very nice flavor.  Brittney described it as a ""hazy"" flavor, but I don't know shit about sake, (I'm used to Gekkeikan/house hot sake).  

Overall, I'm pleased with the experience, the service, and mostly the food.  I would come back during happy hour for sure, though I doubt I'd suggest coming back during regular hours since I have my go-to ramen place!",01HQG1i5zBwmi0nRD4o1Ng,1,1,4,DOePy7gVBBIpY16dP1_YsA

My hopes continued to climb with the first reviews, but alas the rain came out in the form of my first visit and washed away my grandiose hopes and dreams. I'm still hoping that the rising sun will in fact do its things and elevate everything to the potential that exists here. In the meantime, Itsy Bitsy: Ramen and Whisky is entirely A-OK in my book. I'll give it a month or two to get its act together and come back in for another try.

The space is typical of other bars like Commonwealth and Park on Fremont, that one of the co-owners also own...it's trendy, slightly pretentious, but still still amicable to the non-Zappos employee.

What left me wanting more was just the ramen & whisky. My local izakaya bar has more Japanese whisky options. Not a big deal...unless of course you call yourself a ramen and whisky joint. Still, there were a few principle players on the list and some well-crafted cocktails (I'm talking to you All That Jasmine). As far as the ramen goes both the tonkotsu and miso broths were watery on top and lacking flavor...was the execution that off?...did the noodles not get drained?...either way it was on the bland side and not what regular patrons of ramen restaurants were looking for. Through in the fact that busser told us the white pepper on the table was dried garlic powder, the tomago was left off, and service in general had hiccups along the way and I could easily award 2 stars here. But there is something promising and I'm hoping that both the front of house and back of house are still ironing the wrinkles out, so as of now I'd drive out of my way to avoid you, but I'm that all changes in the next couple of months.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,17,13,3,DOe3upiiIgXT3-xnSWYfAg

The tofu and wonton doesn't sound like much on the menu but is silky smooth, tart, and citrusy thanks to the ponzu it marinates in. The hand-rolls aka sushi burritos are fresh and flavorful, just the right amount of filling, but messy. Just shove them into your mouth with abandon- you won't regret it!

For the ramen, all 3 broths are unique and flavorful, but my favorite is the shoyu with thin noodles, laden with sriracha. All toppings are a must, plus bamboo shoots. The portions are quite large, and I've taken the extra home on several occasions which makes for a nice hungover breakfast the next morning with a fresh poached egg. 

The vibe is comfortable but swanky, and smells delicious thanks to the luxe candles at the host stand and in the joint bathroom.

I ordered a drink with a orchid floating on top & I absolutely loved it. The bartender was pretty knowledgeable about the drinks. My favorite thing about the place were the small plates. Reasonably priced in my opinion and pretty tasty. The ramen was disappointing & my boyfriend ending up returning his bowl. They were kind enough to refund him.

All in all, Itsy Bitsy is a good place to hang out downtown. It has less crowds because it's off Fremont, but parking is still awful. I would definitely suggest you order the small plates and not the ramen. The plants all around are cool too.",6ycni00o2pl0tuje3yny1w,0,0,4,Y4U9M5Z73Of9R6kOU1EmTg

I was torn between giving this place two and three stars. It's not bad. Cute concept, nice art, good service. 

The ramen doesn't taste bad, it just isn't all that great either. I suppose if you've never had good ramen before, you'd be fine with it. But if you knew what you were missing out on, you would be disappointed. For me, the biggest draw back was the broth. It literally tasted like the store bought stuff you use to start a recipe. There was no complexity or depth to the flavor, so it's bland and boring.

The lunch rush was not busy but there were several people dining there. I could tell something was up when we walked it and it took more than 5 min for someone to greet us. After being seated, it then took forever for someone to take our order and we actually had to flag the bartender down because there was no waiter/waitress in sight. I think we ordered at around 12:25 pm. I feel bad for the bartender in front because he had to juggle watching the bar and taking the orders. After taking our order it took them almost 30 min to bring out the food. Now I understand that this not your average ramen in a bag/bowl that you would eat if you were broke or in college (or I would hope so) but I have no idea why it took so long. The table next to us who came in after us even finished their food before ours came out. Now onto the food. Potstickers were okay. I give it a 7/10. As for the ramen, it is alright, also 7/10. For the price you are paying though I would expect more. 10.50 is pretty expensive compared to places like monta ramen and ramen sora. I got the Tonkotsu broth which was okay but then they charge you for goofy stuff like chili oil. I don't know how you can justify .75 for chili oil when most places give it to you for free. Anyways 1.5 stars for service today and 1.5 stars for food. Unfortunately unless someone demands that we go eat here I won't be back.",1gEzF_sgGxgIb0w-ONBtBw,0,0,3,kwBHg-7V4RS2IUUw8OqnpA

I came here for a my first time this past week with my roommate who said that this ramen would rank up as one of my favorites.

Their gyoza was cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce that goes along with it is wildly addicting. Not to mention their trendy restaurant decor has you interested in the environment throughout the entire experience.

The name is totes adorable and so are the food portions. I came to Itsy Bitsy: Ramen and Whiskey on a whim and caught happy hour just as it was starting. My partner in foodie crime decided to go H.A.M. on pretty much the entire happy menu...

We ordered skewers times three: chicken, pork, and steak, a side of kimchi, seared sausages, charred shashito peppers, and pork pot stickers. To wash it all down we got a couple cans of Sake. Quick note, be careful when ordering from the Sake menu, I almost a bought thirty dollar can of rice wine. 

The food came out super fast, which is a good thing because the place was empty. We started on the skewers and made our way to the peppers. The skewers were great with real standout being the steak and pork skewers. Both were seasoned perfectly and insanely tender. The shashito peppers were spicy and had a nice char on them, perfect little snacking items. 

The sausages were okay, but I wouldn't recommend these, because they tasted like certified canned army meat, but the dipping sauce they came with was delicious. The pot stickers were also great and had very tasty pork flavor and filling. 

I can't comment on the Kimchi. I'm not a lover of this stinky Asian delicacy. Oddly enough though, I love sauerkraut. 

The bartender was insanely knowledgeable about the entire menu and had an awesome attitude, which also fit the awesome vibe of the place.

2996931,2015-08-18,0,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"Everytime I'm in Vegas, I typically will end up grabbing Monta for lunch after a night of partying. My local friend suggested we go to Itsy Bitsy. His suggestion was solely based on Itsy Bitsy's whisky selection. Whisky and ramen sounded like an epic combination to start the day!

As you walk in, you will notice the music: a nice chill edm vibe. There is interesting art work on the walls, but matches nicely with the personality of the spot. Once seated, the wait staff consistently watches over you to make sure drinks are quickly in your hands. Certain nights, they have a local DJ come to spin, which is pretty nice when you're getting ready for a night out. 

The ramen itself is amazing. I ordered the Tonkotsu broth with extra egg and added corn. In most cases, you will finish the noodles and want to order more. In the case of Itsy Bitsy, you want to finish the noodles and drink up ALL the broth. It was one of the most flavorful broths I've ever had. This destroyed my previous expectations that were set by Monta. 

The whisky selection was quite nice, featuring a handful of the usual suspects from Japan, along with your typical state-side whiskys. Cocktails are also available with different types of juice mixes. We had a few between the group and were impressed, but nothing beats a neat serving of Yamazaki. Prices for these 2oz servings were a bit on the higher side, but worth it for a taste before trying to figure out where to find a bottle stateside.

Concept: Asian cuisine with whiskey pairings...? Lots of choices of other booze concoctions too. Perfect to come here at night and sit outside to people watch!

I've only come here at lunch slowly converting my coworkers from the norm. So far they have all enjoyed.

This is good ramen, not the best but respectable. That being said my favorites are the pork pot stickers, chicken bites (squeeze lemon juice on them!) and beef skewers. I could come here at night and just nibble on those while sipping on cocktails.

They also just updated their menu to include summer items like Asian burger and cold noodles.

Pretty cool little spot and nice staff make this an easy choice for me.

3409039,2016-04-05,1,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"I was in the Downtown area when I suddenly began craving Ramen so I took to Yelp, as I normally do, and checked to see if there were any Ramen restaurants nearby. This was first on the list because of distance, and I guess, because of their name (hey, it was kinda catchy!), my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.

Tip: It's definitely a little hard to find if you're not really paying attention. It's actually inside the Ogden hotel, where upon walking in, the restaurant is through the doors to your right. They don't have signage anywhere to my knowledge, we only figured out that we passed it when we saw people eating ramen inside and paper along the glass saying ""entrance this way"" and arrows pointing behind us.

The noodles were nothing spectacular. They were decent. I ordered mine with the Tonkotsu broth and no additional toppings because they're all at extra cost. It was quite surprising to see that even the oil had an additional charge. Oil??? All of the other Ramen restaurants are so generous in leaving oils, sesame seeds, togadashi etc on the side of our table.

The layout of their restaurant is really nice and is decorated with hip paintings. The staff are friendly, and at the time that we went, around 6pm on Sunday, there was only one table of people eating. Quiet.

It's a bit pricey for what you get and it's definitely not something I would recommend to friends if we were craving Ramen, but if I'm in the area and I'm in the mood for Ramen, who knows, maaaaaybe I'll come back. But perhaps not.",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,2,2,3,OsPn4eX0wzOKVEwncmcSjg

First impression -- very similar to Park on Fremont's decor with its artwork and wooden fixtures. Clean and crisp. It was pretty empty when we went. A few chairs looked like they were straight-up made from the material of moscow mule mugs. If this isn't a sign of another gosh darn hipster restaurant, then I don't know what is. As downtown Las Vegas continues to gentrify, it's no surprise that this place attempts to cater to the hip and the happenin'.

The BF got some chicken teriyaki bowl with the option of brown or white rice. Since this is a ramen place, I opted to try some soup ($10.50) Choice of thin or thick noodles (I chose thick) and choice of broth--tonkotsu, shoyu, or miso (I had shoyu) and all bowls already include: green onion, bean sprouts, braised pork, and a cured egg. They offer other add'l toppings for $1 each, so I added fish cake, but I honestly couldn't distinguish if it was added to my bowl or not.

I didn't have any whiskey sad to say, but I did sip on their watermelon lychee lemonade which was my favorite part of my meal. The ramen was just okay. There are several, more authentic places in town that beat them by a mile, but to be fair, I give props to this joint's ambiance.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,4,2,3,OhBoIraHq9OdnB1INTxCmw

People in the crowd would cheer us on even though I am not the best singer. I appreciated that. The host was fantastic! He had an amazing voice and would sing fun songs in between. He was also super nice and friendly. Also, the sound system was better than most. 

Great atmosphere, great drink specials... now food. The food was phenomenal. It was definitely the best ramen I've had in Vegas. The broth was on point and you could add spice to it. My friend ordered chicken poppers. Even though I just ate, I was drooling over how tasty they smelled.

First of all, I need to talk about the outfits the workers wear.  The hostesses wear these ice skater-American Apparel type dresses that are extremely short, backless, and show tons of side boob.  There was one girl who was constantly tugging at it so her ass wouldn't show.  The waiters and waitresses it seems just have to wear all black...but our waitress was wearing a black bra with a sheer black shirt over it.  I don't want to be served by a lady with her bra completely showing.  Perhaps you think I am a prude, but the outfits of the employees really turned me off (not to mention one of the hostesses who was supremely annoying to me because she was just begging for attention with her purple hair that she wouldn't stop preening and the way that she danced down the restaurant whenever she sat someone).

And then the ramen.  The noodles were chewy and yummy, the tonkotsu broth was meh ok, but the toppings were the worst part.  There is no kikurage, which I LOVE in ramen, and no option to add it either.  And they put straight up bean sprouts (the kind that comes in Thai dishes like Pad Thai) in there instead of bamboo shoots.  I will say that the eggs that go in the ramen are delicious.

Plus, not one of their cocktails on the cocktail menu looked appetizing.

I would not return to this restaurant because I didn't like the style of ramen they have, plus the outfits really bothered me.  However, you might like bean sprouts instead of bamboo, and hate mushrooms, and then this place would be for you.

The waitress was nice enough, but after 45 minutes of waiting for our food (when the restaurant was pretty empty), she only acknowledged us about 35-40 minute in because we flagged her down to ask what was taking so long.

By the time the food got to us, we were already pretty irritated. But we were hungry so we just ate it...we debated walking out because the wait was so ridiculous. We were not shocked that the waitress didn't check on us once to see if everything was ok while we were eating. I've worked in restaurants and customer service jobs before...it's not that difficult to do your job and check on your customers to make sure they are having a good experience.

The ambiance is pretty hip, with those big graffiti-style art posters all over, and it's on the bottom floor of the Ogden, so it's definitely a great location for downtown...touristy for sure, but still welcoming to locals.
Full bar inside with a good selection of specialty cocktails. ~$10 each, so reasonably priced. I like the whiskey emphasis and they have a good selection (to me, I'm no whiskey connoisseur) from all over, especially Asia (of course).
To eat we had ramen, a selection of hand rolls, and the potstickers. Potstickers were the best part. The hand rolls were good, but nothing special, and out of 4 (cut in half, so 8 pieces total), 2 pieces came with just veggies. The ramen isn't really anything special either. Unfortunately for Itsy Bitsy, Las Vegas is a teeming with excellent ramen joints. However, none of them is located downtown, so they are definitely filling a void.
Overall, it's not the most amazing place, but I like it. It's certainly worth a visit if you're craving ramen downtown, or want a drink, or if you just want to sit in a different atmosphere.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,4,pP3e3ncRa7O0TSv1LIs2qg

4107108,2015-06-21,2,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"Hearing about all the new ramen restaurants in Vegas, I thought that the ramen scene was becoming a bit of a bubble. However, my mind may have been changed today.

I consider myself a ramen lover, having gone to most if not all of the previously existing places in town as well as many outside of Vegas. Some of my even more well-traveled ramen aficionado friends invited me to come along so that we could all try Itsy Bitsy for the first time. I was wary of going because of the lack of positivity in prior reviews, but I'll give most places one try at least. Surprisingly, they delivered.

There's plenty of whiskys, other libations, and appetizers on the menu, but I kept my meal simple. I ordered my ramen ($10.25) with thick noodles and miso broth. The ramen comes standard with green onion, chashu, bean sprouts, and half of a soy cured egg. I declined to add extras.

The broth, although almost overwhelmingly salty, was quite flavorful. I'm not dinging them for it because it comes with the territory and because I had almost unpleasant saltiness before in my favorite miso ramen. The noodles were al dente, as you would expect at any ramen restaurant. The chashu pork was tasty and actually had a more porky flavor than a lot of the other places in town. Bean sprouts helped to fight the saltiness, and the julienne green onions provided a needed contrast in both flavor and texture. Overall, this is clearly the second best regularly available miso ramen I've had in Vegas.

I did taste some of a friend's tonkotsu broth both before and after I'd delved into my own bowl, and it was less salty but also less strong in flavor. I'm not sure I would try that next time, and I'll probably skip the shoyu since that tends to be less flavorful overall. But the miso is something that I'll remember, and given how highly I hold in esteem my favorite miso ramen place, four stars is an appropriate rating for Itsy Bitsy.

A few other notes: they keep it fairly dimly lit except for ""bar"" seating, and they're going for a hip vibe that I wasn't unopposed to since the music didn't quite stifle conversation. There is a nude female torso painted on one of the walls, so anyone who might bring kids should be aware. The bathroom is unusual in that it has two sinks in the hall and two lockable rooms each with a unisex toilet.

Come for the miso ramen, stay for the alcohol? Really though, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way if I weren't already downtown, but it's a capable option for a hot bowl of soup in this neighborhood.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,3,4,JfYd_iGMWXcHM9Rz4CcGPQ

I came in for lunch and I saw that they had a DJ setup so I think they might also have a DJ play during nights. That's pretty cool. The glassware and plate ware are pretty chic. 

Since this place is near Fremont it's a great place to eat and then get some drinks!

Onto the food. I ordered the tonkatsu Ramen and a single salmon handroll. The handroll was 4.75 and I have to say it wasn't worth it. It was the size of an eggroll. And i don't think they used real nori. It was this kind of light green edible paper thing. The roll was good. But I don't think it was worth it because of its size. 

Also I had to wait a long time for our food. However I think this is because they were making a fresh batch of noodles. (The noodles tasted fresh and  I heard they make everything in-house). I also tried some cookies and cream mochi my brother ordered and that was really good.

The service was good. Only problem is that we asked to split the checks and there was some complication so we had to wait longer.

The cool vibe hopes to seduce you enough to forget everything else...including good ramen as its named for. This place could have used any other type of combination to incorporate any food like ""Itsy Bitsy Tacos & Whiskey""; ""Itsy Bitsy Tapas & Whiskey"" etc. But where is the whiskey selection? Seems like someone got more hung up on sticking with the name above everything else.

Their signature cocktails are Itsy Bitsy Small & Stingy and even lightweight drinkers will need to order a couple just to quench your thirst. We had the Sake to Me and Shogun something. The Sake to Me was refreshing; the Shogun was filled 2/3 and definitely not worth the $8 for Malibu coconut rum and sake...maybe the delicious sherry cherry (that our server said was very expensive) was meant to justify the 2 sip drink.

We did enjoy the Yelp fave appetizers of Mushroom Springrolls, Pork & Vegetable Potstickers (should have used the appropriate ""Gyoza"" name as this is a Japanese themed place) The Springrolls were light & crispy and full of flavor. The Potstickers were better than any Las Vegas Chinese restaurant we've tried.

The miso ramen was a huge disappointment. I've had really good ramen and what I tasted here was the equivalent of Top Ramen. First of all, the waft from the kitchen was not the usual (sometimes putrid) aroma of tonkatsu broth that has been cooking for hours. The smell was of chicken bouillon that was sometimes masked by the air freshener. The taste was chicken broth mixed with miso. The addition of spicy meat did nothing for my bowl and the spice level was noticeably inconsistent where my wife's broth was spicier than mine. The Chasu was a piece of bland pork and the thick noodles were ok.
They did comp us a Mochu ice cream for the spice level difference. Service was very good and our server kept coming to fill our teeny tiny water glasses...like we had bottle service.

We got chicken skewers, pork gyoza, and vegetable tempura as an appetizer. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen with thick noodles (comes with chasu pork, egg, green onion, and bean sprouts) and added in spicy meat and bamboo shoots. My friend got the Salmon bowl. 

Pros and Cons: 

Pros:
- Service was great! Hostess seated us right away and our server, DJ, was very personable and friendly 
- Neat ambiance; decor on the walls definitely reminds me of The Park (same owners I believe?) 
- Veggie tempura was on point, came out freshly fried. I believe there were sweet potato, onions, and broccoli. I was LOVING the broccoli and left only one small piece for my friend
- The seasoned egg in the ramen was delicious!!
- My friend enjoyed her salmon bowl

Cons:
- Chicken Skewers were a bit too pink in the middle so I stopped eating them. We had other appetizers so I just focused on eating those
- Tiny water glasses, which our server DJ joked about. He left a decanter of water at our table after filling our glasses a few times which we also quickly emptied 
- Pork Gyoza was meh; not bad but nothing extraordinary 
- Ramen was subpar which was quite disappointing. DJ explained the different broths before he took our order and mentioned the Shoyu broth is simmered for over 7 hours... Hmm. You wouldn't think so because it lacked flavor. One of my coworkers recommended getting the spicy meat which was different but gave it a spicy kick. The bean sprouts were a little overpowering in the broth though..

I didn't try any of the whiskeys so I can't speak for the whiskey portion of Itsy Bitsy, but the ramen was unimpressive. 5/5 for DJ and the deep fried broccoli, 2/5 for the ramen.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,6,4,3,hWmYmbB4w6zgej3oYBCbwQ

I had a client meeting here and the following was ordered:

Pot Stickers (5 pieces) - These were tasty and well done. It's hard to go wrong with pot stickers. 

Edamame - What I really liked about this was the portion size. Between four people eating it, we still had some left over at the end of the meal. They were lightly salted and easy to eat finger food.

Shishito Peppers - A great appetizer dish if you think spice is nice. Out of everything I ate, I think I enjoyed them the most. They're just an understated dish without a bunch of frills because the pepper speaks for itself in flavor. Good job.

Katsu Chicken Rice Bowl - This was my own main dish. Yes, it's true I did not order ramen at the ramen place, but I just wasn't feeling like slurping ramen in front of clients. The bowl was disappointment galore. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The rice was also dry. The accompanying sauce was strange and did not compliment the bowl in any way. I would avoid this in the future and just go for the ramen. 

Service was spotty and we waited awhile for the check. In fact, my clients left before it arrived.

4549705,2015-04-30,0,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"I've been wanting to check this spot out for awhile, so when I saw they were having their grand opening, I decided that would be my cue. Now as a local, I know it's always better to give a restaurant a few months before going to allow them time to get the kinks out, but silly me, I just couldn't wait any longer. Needless to say based on the stars given, they did NOT have the kinks worked out. Walking in, the place was packed (as any restaurant owner would hope for opening night), and there was no hostess in sight. We waited several minutes in case she had briefly left and was coming back, but still no sight of her, so I went and found the first employee I saw to ask about seating. They said it would be a 45 minute wait, so we moseyed on up to the bar for some complimentary drinks. We were told that there would be a wait on the one we both ordered, as the bar was out of mint. Not a huge deal, but one would think that the bar would be sure to stock up on key ingredients for a drink that's being promoted (it was also only 8:30pm- still early to be so unprepared). The bartender seemed stressed and incredibly unfriendly, although it seemed everyone at the bar had already been taken care of so there wasn't any kind of line or anything. Strange, but no matter. The ambiance was awesome, so we were generally unphased and continued waiting for our table. We received a seat on the patio, much to the dismay of my friend, although I didn't mind. We waited and waited without any sign of our server coming by to greet us, so I went to let the hostess know that nobody had stopped by. Still, no one came. Eventually, we stopped the other server in that section and asked if she could take care of us, as we were fully prepared to order. We ordered drinks, several appetizers, and our entrees and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes before any of it started coming out. The entrees came out first, well before our drinks even arrived. We had ramen (which was cold but still tasty), chicken katsu (the accompanying rice was delicious), shishito peppers (blah), and shrimp potstickers (which arrived LAST even though they were the very FIRST thing we ordered). While eating, we noticed that the chef was taking advantage of the open kitchen concept to chat with the customers sitting around the bar. That's all good and fine, except on opening night when you've got an array of tickets lined up in front of you and people are hungrily waiting for their food. Overall, the food was amateur and seemed no better than something I could make myself if I was given the recipe. The delivery and service was also a huge disappointment- I'd expect them to have gotten their act together since the soft opening, but apparently not. I gave this place 2 stars because I enjoyed the ambience and would probably come back for a cocktail (although I would hope the bartender would be in a better mood the next time around).",RrS5PUJ63Hdn4sk2pc9Edw,2,0,2,KygzoejyxpNFBpA7kx9bJw

We had the chicken bites and the tempura veggies. The chicken bites were PHENOMENAL, reminiscent of Chick-fil-A nuggets but not as sweet. The tempura veggies were good, too. 

We decided to go with the a ramen bowl (pork base with a thin noodle... im not sure about the techinal Japanese names for them, but you get my drift). And the burger.

They put a TON of it in the ramen too so it was a chore picking them out. Ugh.

I got the She so crazy drink and DAMN, it's CRAZY good. However, it's like 3 sips of a drink for $12, so it's also CRAZY over-priced.

5022943,2016-11-06,2,iJ4uoZkPNJ39Vfh0HirI3w,"For our Tuesday night dinner, the wife and I made our way downtown to Itsy Bitsy Ramen and Whisky.  It had been on my radar since it first opened, but we hadn't made it there until now.  However, since it specialized in two things that I love, ramen and whisky and we had a bought  a Groupon to use, which saved us a little money on an otherwise already reasonably priced meal, we couldn't pass up a meal there this trip.

I had the Spicy Miso Ramen ($10) with thick noodles and a pour of Nikka Coffey Grain Japanese whisky ($18).  I received a generous sized bowl of noodles and broth.  It was topped with green onions, chashu, bean sprouts, and a soy cured egg.  The broth was seasoned perfectly and possessed definite spiciness.  I love things hot, but in hindsight after sipping the wife's plain miso ramen, I should've selected the plain miso broth instead.  Through no fault of the kitchen, just my choice to test the heat tolerance of my palate, the broth's spiciness, while not tongue blistering, became the dominant note overwhelming the other subtle, diverse, flavors in the bowl.  Compared to other bowls of ramen I've had, the amount of toppings doled out by Itsy Bitsy seemed a little less than I'd received at other ramen shops.  However, Itsy Bitsy's ramen was still a hearty, very tasty bowl of ramen, and at $10, an outstanding value.  Itsy Bitsy Ramen and Whisky was definitely a locals' place.  I enjoyed my food and the friendly, welcoming environment presented by the friendly staff and fellow diners who were obvious regulars that struck up a nice conversation with us.

First things first. Kind of out of the place location. But, if you have good food, good drinks and a good atmosphere; you'll find a way to do well.

The service was good. It was packed when we went late on Friday night, so we were seated at a high top by the bar. The bartender had to come around and serve the tables. So it wasn't as fast. 

The food:

The sausages. Honestly? It tasted like regular hotdogs to me. I wasn't a fan, but my boyfriend was. I was expecting it to be like gourmet sausages. Nope. 

The pork pot stickers. Yum. And the soy sauce they used seems way more garlicy. Yum. 

The ramen: I had the thick noodle w/: Tonkotsu, the regular fixings with extra pork. It was very good. only thing is the broth wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. It was good ramen. 

Overall, this place is pretty cool. They had a DJ that started around 9ish? It was pretty fucking loud though, so be prepared for that if you go at night if they have this setup. It's a nice place, the decor is awesome and it was busy. Excellent sign compared to the last place.

Lots of veggies and pork was tasty. Oh, and underneath all the pork and veggies is rice. 3.5/5

There's not very many Japanese restaurants in DTLV. Actually, I can think of only one aside from this place. It's a nice addition to DTLV but you might want to drive a few miles to get better sushi, skewers and bowls for the same price.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,6,3,HXVaKVPbnGfzxNPo-jLADg

My friend and I went downtown to try Carson Kitchen down the street, but parked in front of Itsy Bitsy and was lured in by the name and the idea of Ramen & Whiskey. Once we stepped inside, there was no turning back.

Great ambiance inside - from the art on the walls, the dim lighting and the old school hip hop music .. It all seemed promising. Bad reception inside though, so we couldn't check out the Yelp reviews to help us decide, but decided to take a chance anyways! We were not disappointed!

They do have free wifi, so that was a plus. We shared an appetizer and my friend got a ramen with two extra toppings and a cocktail while I got their ramen + whiskey deal for $20 (any ramen + any whiskey (neat)). Their ramen broth was delicious! And the Japanese whiskey our waiter recommended for me was also great - if I was more of a whiskey neat drinker, I'm sure I would've loved it more lol.

But the best part was that when our server brought us our check, he told us they took 20% off our bill because they had seen that I posted on their Yelp page! How awesome was that?!

They also bring out your check inside of old manga books, which we thought was pretty cool.

If I were to categorize a ramen spot based on two styles, it would be: traditional and Americanized. Itsy Bitsy is definitely American. 

Don't get me wrong, both styles can equally great in their own unique. In the case of Itsy, the deco and whiskey themes didn't sit well with me. It just didn't make sense. 

I ordered the Ramen & Whiskey ($20) where you order you choice of ramen (thin/thick noodles, tonkotsu/Sho-Yu/miso, and toppings) and it comes with a pairing of Kyushu whiskey in a snifter glass. Both delicious in their own world; but when together, flavors clash. Tonkotsu Ramen with thick noodles, bean sprouts, soft boiled egg, soft tofu, and thin sliced nori. The Whiskey, points for importing from Kyushu and delivery, was intense. I should've dumped it all in my ramen to get through the whole thing. 

And the wall art! I didn't get it. It had nothing to do with ramen. Not bad if this was an art gallery though.

If you have a car, PLEASE go to China Town and enjoy some good ramen when you're in the mood! If I'm stuck downtown, I'll go to another restaurant, and if I'm in the mood for ramen, I'll go to another restaurant. I should clarify that nothing at this restaurant was BAD - but at the same time most things weren't GOOD. Everything was very, very okay. The one exception to this is their veggie potstickers - those seem to be made in-house and they're delicious with big chunks of veggies inside. If I for some reason want to go to a restaurant and eat a small plate, I'll go here for the potstickers. But when it comes to everything else I've tried and my friends have tried, everything is ""fine"" - the ramen, the corn, the potato salad, OR ""good, but overpriced"" - the meat skewers, the cocktails. 

The decor is cool and weird - same style as Park on Fremont (the creepy, ethereal look). The service is fine. It's a small space with a good number of servers, but you won't be checked on frequently and there's a good chance you'll have an empty water glass before you finish your meal.

There were only 5 drinks on the menu, and only 2 or 3 had whiskey. I have to assume that was just the soft opening menu, and they serve more whiskeys at the bar. I'd go back for the Sugar Plum Fairy!

First walking in the door this place looks amazing, beautiful paintings on the wall, nice little bar with a various whiskey selection, great ambiance for date night. I got the tonkotsu with thick noodles, green onions, and cha shu; first very bold flavors but it lacked something that could make it a great broth. I couldnt figure what it was missing but the broth def needed less chicken broth, maybe some garlic to balance the flavor. The flavored egg was delicious; if you order the egg order 2 because they cut it in half. The noodles were my favorite out of the whole dish, not your typical ramen noodle, great texture more of an instant ramen noodle texture than the normal starchier noodles so thumbs up to that. The cha shu was cooked perfectly and I wish i had more so next time double egg double cha shu.

The noodles were ok, not as bouncy as I usually like them, and the broth was overall just ok. I got the thick noodles with tonkatsu broth plus spicy meat. The spicy ground pork was nice, but the char sui pork was almost all fat and had little flavor. 

We did order the pork potstickers to share, which was probably the highlight of the meal. The skin had nice texture and the bottoms were nice and crispy. However the filling wasn't anything to be excited about. 

Also, weird thing...the sinks for the bathrooms are outside? 

Overall, I would NOT drive into downtown just for this ramen, but if I was already here, I wouldn't mind coming again.",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,4,2,3,JRMc2ESqsYYHCMsMlWyx-Q

Unfortunately, this place was not up to standards for a Ramen or Asian Fusion joint. The place though was relatively clean, well-decorated and well-maintained by the staff.

If you're interested in checking out this place, you should get the Groupon deal, which was like $20 bucks for $40 worth of food. For the price we paid, we definitely got our money's worth, including the two free Sake drinks with a Yelp check-in.

For appetizers, we ordered Chicken bites ($5.50), which were beyond delicious! Unfortunately, the portions were so little. I was tempted to even buy another one too because they were so good. They were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. The dipping sauce was just as addicting. If I ever come here again, I would order one or two of these dishes alone! Trust me, you won't regret it.

For the ramen, we each ordered: Tonkotsu Ramen with thick noodles (~$10). Unfortunately, the noodles was just about the only ""thick thing"" about this bowl. I wasn't impressed with the broth at all. Every ramen lover knows that broth is the make or break it for ramen joints and this one didn't live up the standards. At one point, I thought I was eating an instant noodle by Maruchan. Thankfully, the noodles were well-cooked with the right texture to steer me back. I wasn't a fan of the chashu pork slices and egg either. They both didn't resonated with the broth, in my opinion. 

To top it off, we ordered the Chicken Katsu bowl with brown rice (~$10). Portion-wise, they gave a lot of rice and salad compared to chicken. However, the chicken, like the appetizer, was really juicy and tasty! Like seriously. If I ever come here again (which again, I say with reservation), I'd for sure order this!

Overall, this was an interesting experience as were extremely hungry and looking for a quick dinner. The staff was very pleasant and helpful throughout this experience. They really took care of us and seated us promptly upon our arrival. However, the great service, awesome decor and live performances (oh, did I mention they had people singing covers! It was so cute!) weren't enough to convince me to give this place anymore stars.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,2,2,2,J9bNFvG41GIc2oCrI-OQlg
