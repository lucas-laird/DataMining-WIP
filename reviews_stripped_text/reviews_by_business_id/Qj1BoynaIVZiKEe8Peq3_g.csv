1032975,2016-07-16,0,Qj1BoynaIVZiKEe8Peq3_g,Service was ok but the food was absolutely horrible. I had the turkey omelette and it sounded good but it was disgusting and the french toast was dry and tasted like dried up bread. I really didn't think they deserved the 1 star to be honest. I'm surprised the Venetian Hotel would even have a place this disgusting in it especially since the hotel is so amazing. If you're staying in the Venetian avoid this place at all cost. It was absolutely disgusting. This place is worse than McDonald's. Do not waste your money here you will definitely regret it every bite of you meal.,eKLi3VA48JPA0C5Y9gCzFw,0,0,1,LunehI1JhfIjbe1gNP_aPw

Their fryers are down so no chicken parm, no chicken Marsala, no fries with sandwiches, but you still have to pay full price for the sandwich even though you don't get the side item.  That's dumb af.",7dqTu39QmICgtjp3mdNwVA,0,0,1,6-ud_j6Z4DzuET6WA55wGQ

Almost 2 minutes before they took my order  They were so busy gabbing with each other   We ordered two vegetarian omelette and that was the only good thing about the place. The hashbrowns were cold like the other reviews stated no butter on the toast and no grape jelly and no Salsa available for the omelettes,A2W7UejLedD_HTjMxuhemA,0,0,2,R0jfsOd-fknhBbRgEZnomg

I added shrimp to it. Seems that when I added shrimp they minus the bacon. The portion is also small considering it totaled 17 bucks. Also the cashier seemed to dislike her job so much she wanted to express it to everyone with her attitude and demeanor. If they don't fix what's going on I'm sure the Venetian can find something else to fill that spot pronto.",KN-nIYA86mHAMjf-cJU-ew,0,0,2,c8wf-ayU0aaMuYt8nN63Vg

4241911,2018-01-12,0,Qj1BoynaIVZiKEe8Peq3_g,"Certainly adequate but nothing special.  A food court Italian place in an Italian-themed casino should be better.  However, it is relatively cheap ($10-15) for a meal in a strip casino, and pretty fast.  Food is made in front of you, rather than reheated in a microwave.  Not sort a trip, but definitely a good choice near the hotel elevators if you don't want to spend $50 and wait an hour for room service.",pEvhyxL7YAGrYsKB29VJvg,1,1,3,eV8V6-uiob16GqcKyAeiPA

4425039,2017-05-20,1,Qj1BoynaIVZiKEe8Peq3_g,"I'm surprised there is a lack of options at the food court here. In my opinion, the Venetian is prestigious hotel. Eats Italian is a acceptable option. It's definitely better than the gas station sandwiches at the cafe down the hall. My advice for dining at a food court is to not get anything too fancy. Anything fancy usually sounds better than it taste. Stick with the easy to make items like the paninis or the caesar salads. That is exactly what I ordered. I got a panini and a side of caesar salad for around $11-$12. 

The panini was actually not bad at all. It came with turkey, cheese and avocado. It could've been a little bit more toasty for a panini but it was acceptable. The caesar salad on the other hand came with more cheese than lettuce. I'm unsure if I should be disappointed because cheese is more expensive than lettuce so maybe I got the winning hand. Let's just say I got more calcium than fiber that day. 

The food is acceptable here as long as you don't have Gordon Ramsey level expectations.",1IDGT7RHqYF76jm7CRuXdQ,2,0,3,YJiCQg_aqVuMwgNabL4ZcA

She sighed as if she was irritated with me so I said ""never mind, don't add veggies, leave it how it is."" She said ""so no veggies then??"" She was irritated for whatever reason. I let my husband take over and I walked away. I don't care how good the food is, the lady was a completely rude and that was enough for me to never want to come here again.
