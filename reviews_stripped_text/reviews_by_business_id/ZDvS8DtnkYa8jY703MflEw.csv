124318,2012-08-09,1,ZDvS8DtnkYa8jY703MflEw,"I do my best to find hidden gems around town, but with little time and minimal resources or recommendations this is often difficult. There are a few such locations on my to-do list from an old top 10 burger list that I've had a hard time getting to, and it's time I get back to those priorities. I believe the last location that fit the bill was the Dispensary Lounge, and it turned out to be everything I hoped for. First on my list to accomplish was The Badger Cafe; the background sounded similar so I had high hopes. Did it come through?

Badger Cafe and its accompanying bar the Rum Runner have been around since 1979. It's a tiny place with only 4-5 booths, a handful of tables and a short diner style counter. The bar it's tied to looks like it has great ambiance if you're looking for an old school local Vegas institution. It's in an older part of town on East Tropicana; the strip malls feels this way, as does the staff and patrons. In many ways this was feeling similar to my experience at the Dispensary already. The menu has plenty of items, too many to mention. What is missing from the menu but quickly located at my table is $3.99 burger menu; a checklist of items to build your own 1/2 lb burger including several free items, several toppings for $.50, $.75 and $1.

I built my burger with lettuce, pickles, tomato, grilled mushrooms and double swiss. After a quick few minutes my burger arrived in a red plastic basket. Upon first bite the meat had great char flavor and was cooked perfectly. The mushrooms were flavorful although not too abundant. The pickles were good, the lettuce and tomato were fine. The sesame bun was soft, fresh and perfectly proportioned. The cheese was a bit too much; maybe it would be enough if it was a bit better as it was a little too salty and stood out, but hardly bad for the cost.

The fries were good; cooked well, flavorful and a bit different looking than normal. They had a familiar taste I couldn't quite identify at first but by the end I realized they tasted like tater tots. I don't always like tots, and for some reason they were great until I realized this. I still found myself eating more of them after I finished my burger. With all of my toppings and add-ons my meal came to $8.91, with my burger being $5.74 of that and worth every penny. Even at almost $9 for this meal, it's great. If you were ok with it and skipped some of the extras you could have an amazing $4 burger. It still doesn't quite beat Dispensary's burger but its damn close. This is an excellent example of a cheap, delicious pub burger, so if you're looking for some old school ambiance in a dive bar-type setting or even on the diner side, it's worth the trip.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,5,0,5,LR2yB5niyoUgbR3b3sKZyA
185496,2010-04-10,0,ZDvS8DtnkYa8jY703MflEw,"NOTE (regarding previous posts):  I wanted to point out that the Badger Cafe is next to but not part of the Rum Rummer Lounge bar next door. It is self-contained now behind a nifty hermetically sealed glass wall (due to recent anti-smoking laws). Anyways, I just wanted to review the food/restaurant alone and separate it from the rest of the bar.....However, that being said, the option to order food and get it at the bar is totally up to you and your tolerance for tobacco smoke. Vice versa, getting beers from the bar is totally separate as well, but drinking has to be done in the bar AFAIK. 

FOOD: This ain't Kobe beef, but save yourself the trouble of high LV Strip prices and come here for a solid 1/2 pound burger. I've eaten here many a times back in the day when I lived in Las Vegas (05' - 09') and when I used to drive long distances to visit Las Vegas (02' - 04'). This place deserves a shrine. I always recommend this place to friends, but it's not for the faint of heart. If you abhor grease, battered fries, chili-cheese fries, and all things from the griddle....look elsewhere. Otherwise, if you call yourself a ""grease aficionado"", welcome to nirvana. Cheap prices and a 24 hour availability makes this place dangerous for the waistline. Get a few beers next door and you'll praise the sedentary lifestyle soon enough. I've never had their wings, but have heard decent things and they're cheap. I always go for the build your own burgers starting for under $3 - add some Ortega green chiles, a slice of cheese and take all the fixin's (ask for a pencil and request everything on those 4x11 order sheets) and then enjoy the cheap bill b/c it never costs you more than $5 even if you get the fries for 75 cents. Seriously, take a trip off the Strip (if you're a visitor) and enjoy a part of LV flavor. If you have time to spare, knock off an hour or two and see some rhinestone glitz at the Liberace Museum as well.

ATMOSPHERE: It's in a strip mall with a dance studio, a Korean resto and grocery mart - but what Las Vegas place isn't in a strip mall? Lot's of blue hairs, Packers/UW fans, pool tables, shuffle board and tons of characters at all times of the day. As mentioned above....Look for the ""Rum Runner Lounge"" to get that review and ask for Birdie when you're there - she's the bomb. Again...if you hate smoking, the anti-smoking laws (as mentioned above) won't keep you separated from your greasy spoon cravings - just eat at the cafe. 

HINTS: If you order at the bar, be sure to tell the bartender so he/she can flag down one of the BC waitstaff. Otherwise, order at the cash register next door and bring the food in. I find that if you play on the VP machines, you'll usually get better service right away. Another added advantage is ""comp drinks"" - if you put a $20 in the VP machine and play at max bet ($1.25), the drinks are ""free"" while you can enjoy your chow with those nifty bar wood block tables. (Food isn't free - so just pay your BC waitstaff separately).",v2C4S11PHzLEXKeF5kvTJA,2,2,5,LBsBz5x9Cwo9psSXklqbNw

However, the downside is that the ""chicken"" really wasn't chicken at all. It wasn't ""whole"" chicken like we're used to seeing, but was more like chicken that has been made from chicken paste (similar to burger patties made from beef paste). I took 2 bites and just couldn't stomach the rest. So the quality of the ""chicken"" was just complete crap and rest of the food were just sub-par and for that 2 stars.

You order burger on a paper and you pencil in your ingredients. I found an article in Las Vegas Weekly and figured we try it. We ended up finding a burger joint.

I got a weird vibe because drunk people kept coming over from the Rum Runner or whatever it's called to order food. The waitress was acting like she was SUPER busy when there was only one table of a family there eating. She doesn't even cook the food for goodness sakes. But there isn't a sign saying to seat yourself and we stood by the door way for about 5 minutes before we finally sat ourselves down because she clearly wasn't going to tell us to just find a place. Then it took her about 15 minutes to pick up our cards for our orders and finally get us drinks. She said she was ""so busy"" when it was dead in there and all she has to do is take the food to the bar. IDK I just don't look at the place being busy as a good excuse for no courtesy.

The medium wings are the best and I've had the blackened wings and they were okay, but not really my thing. It is RIDICULOUS that you can get a burger so cheap and that the cooks will make it medium rare. It is so hard to find a good medium rare burger joint! I have to stop myself from getting a tasty burger every time I go there. The chili is to die for and it is even better on fries topped with cheese! I've also had the cheese curds which were good and the pot roast was good. The pot roast had great texture, but needed to be seasoned a bit more.

Fries were excellent by the way. 

So I got home w/ anticipation... The wings were good, not great, not enough sauce. Lucky me, I got extra sauce on the side! But oh NO! They gave me bbq sauce, not hot sauce...

BC is attached to the RumRunner Bar.  The first thing i notice when walking into BC is that thick grease SMELL.  Man, they are seriously competing with Geri's Philly Cheesesteak for not only the strongest grease smell but the "" take me back to the 60's/70's coffee shop motiff.  Personally, I dig it !!

But hey, it don't mean a thang if the food don't swing.  Again, for me, the food works but let's get real, the place is a hole in the wall grease pit so go in knowing and understanding that.

I went with the build your own burger - added bacon, egg, swiss cheese and grilled onion.  Also went with the homemade potato chips.  The server suggested i go with her "" off the menu"" option of vinegar and garlic salt added to the chips, "" Sure!""

The burger was perfectly cooked.  As what has become the norm lately, more salt needed on the burger ( is it me ??) great bacon and the egg hit the spot.  Minor ding - the swiss cheese slice was paltry and did little for the overall burger.  

As far as the chips - really pleased to see they are krinkle/dip chip style - nice !  As to the garlic salt and vinegar - sorry, i wasn't feeling it - i'll stick to the garlic salt next time.

The group also ordered chicken wings ( didn't try ) and cheese curds - did try and loved them !   

Saddened i couldn't get a Wisconsin Beer to go with the grub ( asked about Point Beer and Leinenkugel but i got a blank stare - settled for a blue moon )

Absolutely rude and said he's never had a complaint against the particular waitress in 8 years (hard to believe, I've polled other friends who've eaten there and don't care for her either...)

Completely missed the point when I explained that it was extremely unprofessional for her to confront / harrass us WHILE WE'RE EATING and tell us how much we're lying; how it's not about the ONE EXTRA DOLLAR WE WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID, but the way she did her job. Even admitted that HE told HER not to serve us until he talked with my boyfriend and I first (So I guess it's perfectly okay to have the disabled cook serve us when it's obvious his leg hurts when he walks...REAL nice of you!) Doesn't like the fact we gave our opinions on the service, thought it was rude of US. Excuse me for warning others about how badly we were served on multiple occassions. (Just FYI - Gotten plenty of PMs thanking me for the review! Keep it up!)

The food was pretty good but I will never ever return. According to them, I'm sure they won't miss my boyfriend and I and are probably glad to be rid of us. Fine with me. I'll stick to the friendlier hole-in-the-wall establishments I frequent.

Seriously, what happened to basic human decency in this world? I didn't want any free food, I didn't want ANYTHING out of this except for the business to understand that what she did was absolutely uncalled for and very unprofessional. I would have been happy to just hear one sentence --- ""I'm sorry this happened and we will discuss this with the waitress"" When I worked in the service industry, this was how things were usually handled.  ""Well sorry you don't like the way we run things,"" is what was said instead...and no. No I sure don't like the way this place is running things...and if they continue to treat others this way, we aren't going to be the only ones.

Service is more on par with a diner, with friendly older ladies who exceed your expectations and call you variations of ""honey"" and ""sweetie"" every time they come by to check on you.

Food is delicious and affordable:
$4 app of beer-battered brats with spicy mustard is A+
Wings can be ordered in increments of 6, but only one sauce for 6 and 12 piece orders- if you want multiple flavors, just order multiple 6-pieces. Both ranch and bleu cheese dressing available, sauce variety has about ten types from mild to hot, extra spicy, lime, garlic, and blackened- their specialty.
The burgers though, are probably a highlight: just under $6 to build your own with the basics, adding on a few charges for add-ons like guac, grilled mushrooms, and jalapenos. Grilled and fresh onions are both free, found it odd that tomatoes were a fifty-cent charge.

Especially the burgers. You order the burgers by filling out a sheet that lists all the details you want for you for your burger. Cooked fresh for your taste buds. And these burgers are grilled, not fried or microwaved(fast food). 

Don't forget the fries either for only a dollar more. And these are no overcooked fries. They're like curly fries except not curly. But cooked deliciously. Might I mention though that the burger starts at $3.99 which is absolutely absurd when you consider the quality of the food. 

They also require you to purchase a drink with burger orders which are about $1 if not, slightly more. But you can't complain about the value of this deal w hen you compare it to other diners such as denny's and etc.

This is a Wisconsin bar and besides for a brat I saw on menu, this appears to be the only true Wisconsin offering. I have had them before up there and they are crazy good and chewy, totally unlike mozzarella sticks, becuase they just use the curds. At $4.99, I still wasn't willing to get a full order solo because I would have eaten them all. 
Ok, now onto what I actually did eat. Had a 1/2 order of Biscuits/Gravy for $1.50, basically 1.5 biscuits in a gravy. These were good for the price. Then I tried the burger deal and my toppings were free (grilled onions, raw onions, 1000 island and pickles) and for $2 more, I added a side of blue cheese crumbles and fries. The fries were thin and beer battered, so that gave them a different and excellent taste and the burger ($4.99) was cooked to my liking and quite thick for a 1/2 pounder. Although, it says fresh meat, I have muy doubts. My definition of fresh is fresh ground beef every day, but not sure what everybody else defines it as. Whatever it was, it was in the middle of the pack for a burger, great value, but probably not bnetter than GRIND up the street.

As a non-smoker, I enjoy that they have full separation, yet easy access to the bar portion.

In fact, it's still that same old diner adjacent to Rum Runner that serves one of the best burgers in Las Vegas.  So why must I write an update and even take down a star from my initial review?!  I suppose my last experience was rather appalling.  

After going to the bar numerous times for years, it was a first that a menu was brought to my attention.  Having always ordered the burger with desired fixins and a side of hot wings, I wanted to venture out and go for something else.  After reading through an extensive array of items I didn't know the restaurant has offered in the past, I decided to go for the roast beef.  For $7.99, the meal comes with salad or soup, vegetable of the day and a choice of potato.  To my surprise, the dish was not as I expected it to be.  The meat itself was comparable to prepackaged deli one can get at grocery stores.  Only if the menu mentioned that part, I could have saved money or ordered something else as I didn't even eat more than a bite from it.

Overall, Badger Cafe is still my go-to late night burger joint.  Perhaps, don't expect highly of their other items on the menu if you do end up going that route.  One thing's certain, I'll just stick to what I know best and order that next time.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,2,3,3,RLESiPshFx4j3tUubWjJvw

My family attempted to eat at this establishment after looking at the reviews on Yelp.  We came today, Monday, December 21st, at about 0945. We came in the door and noticed that we were the only customers.  

The waitress saw us, and didn't acknowledge us, and went in the kitchen area. My wife went to the counter and called for the waitress in order to get a highchair,   with a  repeated ""Hello"" and ""Excuse me."" And mind you, we were the only ones there.

After no success,  I then walked up and almost yelled for the waitress.  By this time,  I figured I didn't want the cook to spit in our food, so we started to walk out.

Lo and behold,  the waitress finally came out and said, ""Yes?""

Only if my son wasn't with us.....i would've given her more than 2 cents!

2778859,2014-06-21,4,ZDvS8DtnkYa8jY703MflEw,"This place is kind of hidden in a plaza full of other cafes. As part of the Rum Runner Lounge, it is a 24 hour sit down style restaurant. From all of my visits so far there are more pros then cons.

Pros
Since its 24 hours you can come here any time. The lounge itself is sealed off from the cafe because they put a door to the entrance instead of being an open space. Menus are on all the tables so when you sit at whatever table is available you can already start looking at your options and everything is on the menu is available at any time. Every table has all the condiments you will ever need for any of your entrees. 

Cons
LIke I mentioned above, since its 24 hours, if you come between the hours of 12 am and 5 am, you just might run into some colorful characters. The bathrooms are located in the casino so if you have kids, they need to be escorted at all times.

As for the food, I have discovered so far that most everything I have tried is good. The things that you cant go wrong with are the burgers, hot wings, chili cheese fries, onion rings, and any breakfast item. 

For the burgers which are half pound not frozen angus beef patties, (starting at $4.99) you have a checklist of what you want on there so you can mark off what you want with the pencils provided. Items like pickles, lettuce, mayo, and onions are free while some others like tomatoes, cheese, bacon, etc are extra. Same goes for the hot wings. You select your quantity and what flavor.

The one downer for food I got one time was the new york steak. It was bland. I had to douse it with a combination of A1 and Heinz 57 sauce just to give it some kind of flavor.

Service for the most part was stellar. Understandably if the place is busy then service will be slow sometimes especially when patrons from the lounge order things as well. Yes, you can hang out in the lounge and order food to be brought out to you. 

So overall, Badger Cafe is a nice spot to hit up if you are in the area no matter what time it is for good grub at decent prices.

My Firs- SECOND- and only- SECOND complaint! (Still the same complaint, really.)

So, I went back today hoping to redeem my views. They were simply reinforced. Even though Yelp is most definitely a place for opinions I will try my best to be as factual as possible. I hate for one bad experience or one bad employee to ruin an entire restaurant for me but that's the way it's looking. Heck, that's the entire reason I went back tonight! ""Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch."" to be a good sport, heck I even tipped my normal rate again tonight because I am still trying to see the positives! Well, I'll start with that:

THE GOOD: As usual the food was outstanding. We were not only served by ""Katie"" (who I will get to in a second), but also by a gentleman in the back who quite possibly the only man to receive a hypothermia injury in Las Vegas. He was polite, friendly, and still hobbled over providing us with great service in spite of his leg injuries. The place was a little busier on the bar side of things tonight.

THE BAD: Katie, oh lord Katie. 

My girlfriend and I came back, hoping to amend things. For some perspective we have both worked in the service industry before, mostly retail, so we try to keep that in mind. Seriously, I am at a loss for words for your -tact-.  

Yes, management DID try to get in touch with me since my last visit and review. However, they never left a message, leaving me to believe they were telemarketers. I also work at a hospital so once I realized who was calling me I tried to call back ASAP. I do not have the luxury of being able to answer my phone immediately at work. So, I'd end up speaking to someone else who didn't know the situation or why they were being called. Okay.

Katie came over, reminding us that management tried to call. We gave the above explanation and this time gave them my girlfriend's number for contact (she CAN be bothered to answer the phone more than I, and honestly, I'm done). We ordered and started to eat, served by the gentleman I mentioned above. It was busy in the bar area, so I won't jump to conclusions and say she was avoiding us.  

She asked if we had ""come again for another round to complain."" I replied that, ""no, this was our first time coming in since you last saw us. It must have been someone else."" To her credit, she did let slip one ""I'm sorry"" around this point.

But then, and I can't believe this, Katie actually got out her tablet, and brought up my first review on Yelp! She said, and yes, this time I am quoting, ""You are Brett, right?""

""Yes?""

""See, I just don't know why someone would make up such lies.""

""Like what?""

""I don't know, I haven't read the whole thing, but Kristi (previously referred to as [Jane] in my older review) is my FRIEND and like here, you said the table was dirty, it was NOT. And I just, I don't know why someone would say such lies."" And she went on (to use my girlfriend's word ""harassing us"") like this...

Wow. When I worked service, and someone was upset, you apologize, you try to make it better. ""The customer is always right."" You don't stand there, rehashing old crap, and trying to prove that you're right. But she did, she kept digging that grave.

Our food came. It was still outstanding (and will be missed). The gentleman from the back continued to be a pleasant gentleman. Then Katie brings us the check.

Once again, I'm astonished by her words. She brought my change, picked up her shovel, dug deeper, and said, ""Look I don't know what you guys are trying to do, but management here really loves me here, so I don't know what you're trying to do or why, but whatever it is it's not going to work."" 

I replied, ""it's not like we're out to get you or anything.""

Wow, wow, just...wow... I am happy to pass this torch to my girlfriend, who was with me on both occasions and has more than enough credibility to speak for our experiences. I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy. I kept telling her to ""relax, calm down, and take the high road."" I -STILL- hope they call her, redeem this place. Otherwise, Badger Cafe, your delicious food and OTHER servers will be sorely missed.

Girlfriend is currently writing her own review, and email through their website.

When I tipped, because I still just could not bring myself to stiff an entire place on the tip, I wrote on one of the bills, ""Because the guy with the bum legs deserves IT!""

With a packed bar, she even thought she had the time to take out her tablet, argue with us constantly, and provide no service other than bringing the check. This should be a massive red flag. The gentleman brought out menus, food, drinks, refills, etc. I'm honestly baffled.

What did the managers/owners tell her to make her feel so invincible to customer complaints? What do they think she is doing? Do they really support this kind of behavior?",kaQBqwdnKuM9hXug2OUhOg,5,0,2,ChYC4y8ysLJDMWznFlnSnQ

The Badger Cafe is tucked away in a strip mall close to UNLV. It looks really like a bar but closer inspection when coming in really does reveal a pleasant surprise.

Adjacent to the Rumrunner which is just a regular smokey bar, the Badger cafe serves up some of the best burgers in town for cheap! They give you a little silver of paper on which you can check of whatever topping you want. Bacon, mushrooms, guac, fried egg, whatever you want. You get a 100% customized burger right to your specifications, yum! On top of that, the fries are awesome. The beer battered spuds are perfectly crispy, and taste great. The prices are great, and you can even get wings with a great selection of sauces to toss em in.

Afterwards, you can head over to bar next door for some drinks. The two places are connected, so they will bring the food out to ya at the bar, or you can avoid it the second hand smoke and eat in their dining room.

Don't let the exterior fool ya, if you want awesome burger, check this place out.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,5,4,4,MhuTmA7iJwPsc3XqHc32QQ
3407168,2012-06-02,0,ZDvS8DtnkYa8jY703MflEw,"As a college student, I always enjoy a good bar hopping from time to time.  I found one little enjoyable bar down the street from my house and campus called the Rum Runner.  Why am I saying this?  Well I've been to Rum Runner many times but i have never eaten at the restaurant that is literally next door, the Badger Cafe.  I can honestly say that I really enjoyed my dining experience here and I will come frequently.

The first thing you notice about this place it that it is a home of Wisconsin sports team.  What I mean by this is that there is a glass case with a Green Bay Helmet and University of Wisconsin Badger helmet.  The reason I say this is because I'm pretty sure no Viking or Lions fans will eat here but don't let that detract you the food is delicious!  I ordered one of their build your own burgers, which can get quite pricey if you want it fully loaded, but it is worth it!  I had a single cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, grilled onions, fries and pickles which totaled out to be around $7.75 which is a pretty good deal.  The burger was not greasy and the beef was great.  The fires I am now a big fan of.  They are crunchy, golden brown, and just plain awesome sauce.  

If you want good cheap bar food, with friendly service look no further than badger cafe.  Once your done you can come next door and have a beer with me at Rum Runner every other week.  see you there!",ks7yFvUxYK0R7TFOam3-KA,1,1,4,uDD1RlZf6mXDY92xXqJ00w

I grew up here and it was a glimpse of what it used to be like before it got all ghetto.

Kind of weird, but oh well I guess? Tried both the mild and butter and I'd much rather prefer the mild. The butter wings were practically tasteless (just an fyi to anyone who contemplates on getting it). Just like my brother Rei B. mentioned even the cartilage is quit crisp.

Boy, they were so wrong! The place has the dive vibe just right, with an old school interior, cheap prices, and a location in a strip mall, but the food here is really bad. 

I visited with two friends and the three of us ate lunch for around $25 total. It's cheap, but the old adage is true: you get what you pay for. We ordered the fried zucchini, a pastrami sandwich without the bread, and a bacon cheeseburger without the bread. All three items were of an extremely poor quality. But then again, I didn't have to pay much for the food. 

The fried food (fried zucchini and french fries) was the best thing we had, but that's not saying much. It tasted like frozen, mass produced zucchini that was simply dumped in the fryer. There's nothing wrong with that, but don't come in here expecting fresh, hand-cut zucchini. The french fries were freaking amazing, but it's hard to mess up fries! They were those super duper crispy, double-battered and fried fries, and they are amazing. That's the only thing I'd ever come back to eat here (but again, they are obviously frozen and straight from a bag). 

The pastrami sandwich didn't fare as well. The pastrami was okay but bland, and the cheese on top wasn't real cheese and instead was processed cheese food. So gross. The cheeseburger was the absolute worst thing on the table. Once I got through the decent toppings (bacon and grilled onions), I hit the fake cheese and then the ""beef."" This beef was totally a FROZEN preformed patty, like those kind that come from the giant tube. The meat was of questionable quality and had the consistency of a hockey puck. It was so terrible. I love cheeseburgers and eat them every week and this one was one of the WORST I have EVER been served ANYWHERE in the world. 

The cole slaw side was super sweet and -- you guessed it -- straight from a bulk food service pail. I get that restaurants can't always make homemade food, but everything we were served was straight off the Sysco delivery truck.

Relatively small menu with daily specials- most of the food is very good. Build-your-own-burger for the win! Price is very modest, and all servers are so nice and interactive with guests. Our favorite lady works mornings...I wish I knew her name.
This little gem is attached to Rumrunner's bar next door and the servers and cooks typically have to run back and forth between the two at peak business times, so you could potentially be waiting a very long time for your food. It's happened to us a lot over the years. Badger's is very dear to us, and although the rest of the experience is always very good, I had to take off a star for that. They just need to do better with their staffing. Other than that, a must try for locals and I highly recommend!

I first found out about this place from a coworker who loved going there during packers games because it's known as a ""Packer Bar"". But that is Rum Runner we are talking about, which is connected to Badger Cafe. They both are one and the same, but I'll talk about the food in this review.

The restaurant area is nice and tidy, has a dive / diner type of feel and it's quite busy most of the time. Customer service is great and so is the speed of food delivery (it obvious varies depending on nuts it is inside Rum Runner).

Anyways, $3.99 for a half pound burger plus an additional $1 for extra fries. This is easily one of the better burgers in town, it's a great value no matter how you look at it. I've been a regular here for months now. 

I'm majorly addicted to the fried, they are completely beer battered and are phenomenal tasting. I have no need to add salt or any other seasonings, the fries stand on there own. This and very crispy, just thinking about them makes me want to drive there right now for some fries.  If the owners are reading this, add another item on your menu that is a bucket of fries for $4.99 or something. I will be there every day!

The parking area is mostly packed for reasons I don't understand and it's around a quite questionable neighborhood. The appeal of this place is similar to my favorite bar back in Michigan, it's in a rough neighborhood with some scumbags hovering around (I guess that's why my coworker has been going there for years, scumbag) but the food is so great. It's like an urban risk/reward game, maybe I'll get hassled by hobo's, or maybe I'll get an awesome deal and meal. 

It get's extra points for being able to order from inside the cafe and they will bring the food out to Rum Runner for you. 

Food, Deals, Service, it's got all of that. I strongly recommend  coming here if you can!

Food: they have an awesome deal on wings and burgers. We always for for this deal. You won't be disappointed by either. 
Wings: The wings are a good size, never small or dry. 24 wings, which is way more than enough for the two of us, is only $16 and some change. They have  large range of sauce choices. My favorite that I've had so far is Spicy Garlic.
Burgers: $3.99 for a fresh 1/2 lb burger isn't a bad deal at all. There are a few extra charges for certain toppings, but it will hardly ever come out to more than $10 for the burger. 
Fries: Oh my God these fries. Beer-battered fries. They are amazing. They are  crispy, delicious, and only $1 an order with the wing or burger deal. If you ever go, please try the fries. They are hands down the best fries I've ever had.

My fiancé and I were looking for a simple cafe to grab a burger tonight - nothing fancy or pretentious.  We got exactly what we were looking for at Badger Cafe.

The made-to-order burgers are fan-freaking-tastic.  I don't really care for burgers all that much, and I'm rarely in a burger mood.  However, I love the burgers at Badger Cafe.  I was surprised at how un-greasy mine was - it tasted really fresh, and the bun was delicious and flaky.  The grilled onions were amazing.... reminded me of eating White Castle during my adolescence (I'm from Missouri).

We also got an order of the wings.  They are on the small side, but I really like that - sometimes the big wings are gristly and tough.  The skin was flaky and amazing.  I would come back just for the wings sometime, but next time I'll get a hotter sauce.  The medium isn't hot at all.

Best of all, the service was friendly.  It was the kind of place ""where everybody knows your name"" (*cue Cheers theme song*).  My fiancé and I spent a good chunk of time reminiscing about our first date, which was in a diner not too different from the Badger Cafe (awwwww).  The place just felt home-y like that.  

Highly recommended.  It kinda looks like a dive, but give it a try.

**EDIT:  Holy mother of hot wings.  Their wings are crazy good.  They're small and crispy, but the sauces are delicious.  We always get a mix of BBQ and their hottest hot wings (which are the perfect level of heat - doesn't burn your face off, but stings a little bit).

The cheese curds ($4.99) was my favorite item. Can never go wrong with fried cheese. There is a $1 to go box fee if you do not order a drink.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,0,3,ITKXlHquaRSw9nwAPXi8rA

I met my boyfriend here for some bar food without the smoke. Sometimes smoke alone can ruin the experience. The rum runner bar was hopping but we were the only sit down people at the cafe based on yelp reviews we weren't worried. The waitress was super friendly and chatty with us while we decided what to order. We filled out the cards specially laid out for the wings and burgers.
He ordered 12 wings two different styles hot and bbq hot and french fries.
I had the burger mid well, tomato, double cheese and 1000 island on the side. 
Our food arrived *check out my pic called omg lets eat!*, and we were in heaven. My burger was cooked just right, bun was toasted, juicy but not overly juicy to where it made the bun wet and nasty, cheese was melted to perfection. His wings were plump and juicy not one small one in the batch. Fries were hot and crunchy. Two sides of ranch, carrots and celery without having to ask or being charged extra? Love it!! Take notes Bdubs!  

For two our bill came to 15.80 + 4.00 cash for tip.
And we were full and satisfied with the service we received and the food was great! We will be back to try some different things on the menu! 
Why is my mouth watering writing this review!!!!?!!!?!?!?! :-)

Not worth 5 stars cuz: It's smokey from the connected bar. If you're not a smoker, it's the grossest thing in public. Should be against the law to smoke in public. The portions are inconsistent. I usually order the breakfast skillet. Whether 2am, or 12noon, sometimes it fills the skillet with a heap of yummy goodness and sometimes it's LITERALLY half the amount. No, not a smaller ""lunch"" portion. Just inconsistent portions. Plus small extra things are ""just"" soso, like their toast. 

Why it's worth 5 stars: Beer-battered brat bites! So frigen good. I get one or two orders every time I visit. Love em. The waitresses are usually pretty damn nice and friendly.

I ordered the blackened wings with bleu cheese and fries. I left the bone completely clean. They were spicy enough for my experienced palate to take a step back to appreciate the spice. Blackened to perfection. And my fries were great too.

5672515,2014-05-12,1,ZDvS8DtnkYa8jY703MflEw,"Oh Badger Cafe, how far you have fallen. Many days and nights, my broke college-going self would make my way through your doors, the juicy, hand-pressed burgers were right in my budget and oh-so delicious!

The last few times we have gone in for burgers, there were problems. Not serious enough to write you off, we would wait a little while, then head back and try again. Problems again. 

What kind of problems you ask?
- The past FIVE times, my wife has ordered grilled mushrooms on her burger. The past FIVE times, she has received ZERO mushrooms on her burger.
- Every third time or so, your food works like McDonald's and Burger King - a la a guaranteed intestinal cleanse. Not pleasant at all.
- The size of the mayo/thousand island cups has shrunk to where a french fry folded in half is as wide as the mouth of the cup. Seriously?!
- Finally, despite re-assurances from the staff, there is no way in hell those are hand-pressed burgers. So dry, tough and flavorless, That is the signature of pre-made patties.*

If the burger maintained its hand-pressed tastiness, we could get over the other items, or at least, feel up for the gamble of if we had to race home and to the bathroom. No sense in continuing to support food that declined so much.

Also, having staff engaging in lengthy discussions about how much they hate other staff members that aren't there, with each other - and regular customers, is very unprofessional. If you have an issue with that person, talk to them, deal with it, shut up or quit. I don't want to feel involved in your drama, because that is the only thing that could be heard in the restaurant.

5715440,2016-09-05,7,ZDvS8DtnkYa8jY703MflEw,"Visited on Saturday September 3, 2016 around 9AM.  This restaurant is located on Tropicana at Spencer.  It's in the same shopping center as Gorilla Sushi and attached to Rum Runner.  I wasn't so sure if kids were allowed but they said it was alright to bring our toddler in. There is a sign on the door that says after 10 pm minors must be accompanied by an adult.  

Anyhoo....this greasy spoon may be one of the last divey mom n' pop places left in Vegas.  The place is dated in a cool, retro way and still has barstools and a cool round spinny-ticket-holder-thingy in the kitchen.  Our server was a mother and a veteran and just as friendly as they come.  

The food is cheap as hell and all three of us ate here for like $17 bucks.  They seem to specialize in breakfast and ""drunk foods"" like chicken wings and burgers.  

For $5.59 I got the ""pan-san"" which came with eggs any way you want, pancakes, and bacon.  I would have paid much, much more for this.  The pancakes were huge and fluffy and perfectly cooked.  The bacon was so thick but still crispy and the eggs were perfectly scrambled and buttery.  It was the *perfect* breakfast.  

My husband said his breakfast burrito was good but the tortilla was really hard in some places.  He just tore off the bad spots and said he enjoyed the rest.  The biscuits and gravy were not the best I've ever had but were adequate and clearly homemade.  The biscuits tasted a lot like uncooked flour so maybe they were a bit undercooked but they were hard so I think maybe they were just not the freshest.  

I can imagine if you were at the bar next door this place would be like manna from heaven as far as drunk food goes.  But for normal (sober) folks like me this is just A-OKAY.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,16,12,3,plWnQEhZnPsdho3jCIoSPQ

The salad came in a bowl and included plenty of tomatoes, cheese, cucumbers along with lettuce. I've had worse salads at more expensive places. The gravy wasn't over salted, which I find in a lot of places. 

They are located next to Rum Runner bar on Tropicana and Spencer. Many of the bar patrons ordered food and from what I could see it all looked good. You can byob (build your own burger).

First glances from outside, I questioned our decision but actually it's quite cute and diner style inside. Our waitress was very nice but seemed to be the only one working, which not many tables in the diner but I think the bar on the other side was her job as well. 

They have really great prices and lots to choose from of diner style food. One friend got the BLT with fries (she liked hers, fries were awesome), another the nachos (they looked okay....), and myself the quesadilla. The reason I'm rating this place a 3 and not a 4 and it's very in between those marks was because of a few issues. One, I was freezing, they have the fans blowing at high speed, poor little couple that were there had to move to this tiny table that seemed the only spot where it wasn't as cold. Two, she wrote down the order and even repeated almost everything that were on the dishes back to us... My friend who got nachos was missing the jalapeños, and I order the quesadilla no tomatoes and repeated it twice.... I got tomatoes and my food came out 5 minutes after my friends. I was too hungry to say anything and on a time crunch to ask to have it fixed. Also the quesadilla was suppose to have Ortega chilies, pretty sure it got the jalapeños that were suppose to be on the nachos. On the plus side, the quesadilla was really good, and the tomatoes were very minimal it didn't ruin the flavor for me. Not sure where the error was and I understand it happens, so that's why I'm not rating any lower.
