I reported one (did not notice the curry right away) and Eat24 refunded and the very nice manager came by and apologized. Apparently the computer doesn't even tell them it's vegetarian, must be a software glitch. So make sure to be specific and redundant in the order details until its fixed.

1189740,2014-05-26,0,yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA,"My go to for years merely due to location and decent food was Pin Kaow.  Lotus of Siam is always a good experience but kind of far for me. My recent love has been Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. Solid Thai food, beautifully presented and a intimate relaxing environment. But....I know I'm here to review Basil fusion so here goes. 

Probably the closest Thai food if you live in the northwest.  Merely chose this Bc I siri'd Thai food and this popped up. Not bad reviews and I wanted to take Thai food home without driving far. 

A first for seeing a Thai food place in a bar. Kinda odd, but hey I chose to give the food a chance. Do not recommend eating in, smokey and dingy, the patio is doable if the weather is perfect.  Doable for take out, barely, since picking up was in a back hallway where you feel like you don't belong. But they came out of the kitchen right away to acknowledge me and the Thai lady was very friendly. 

Now for the food.

Pad Se Ew with tofu. I agree with other reviewers about the noodles. I'd recommend this place not continue with these noodles Bc the traditional wider noodle is so part of the experience of Pad Se Ew. I will say that places that try to substitute the Chinese broccoli for American  broccoli really disappoint, but this place had the Chinese broccoli so it partially made up for the noodle. It was not bad overall.  Pad se ew is becoming a very popular favorite in Thai food, so they should really make some changes to make it right. Overall, 7/10.

Red curry with chicken. This was comparable to any other Thai restaurant I've been. Nice amount of chunky vegetables, chicken was tender and flavor was good. Overall, 8/10. 

No spring rolls so ordered Egg rolls. Could've done without, tasted like Panda Express egg rolls. 6/10.

I give this place a 4 star due to price, location, decent Thai food to take home and a friendly chef lady:)",6NKkIqvj7i5cwQfN9e9q0A,4,1,4,snwtS257x-2ouWHVIvu7GA

1760947,2014-11-25,0,yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA,"Great Thai food in an older, smokey, neighborhood bar is not what we was expecting, but exactly what we found.  Bailey's has made a good choice in their kitchen because it has brought us back in several times in the past few weeks and we have also left behind money at their bar and in their slot machines.  

I assume that the restaurant is leased out and is independent of the bar because when you are ready to order, they call back to the kitchen to have someone come out to take your order (and you pay your check separately from your bar tab.)  When she came to take our order, I had a good feeling about dinner when there was a bit of language barrier.  It seems often times when dining at an ethnic restaurant that a certain amount of difficulty communicating means that you are about to get an expertly prepared authentic meal. 

The first time I dined here I had the yellow curry with shrimp.  Since that first time, I have not made it off of the curry menu except for the panang once.  I have worked my way onto the red and green curries and also had the chicken and the pork.  Each time it has been exceptional.  The chicken and pork are tender and flavorful.  For the shrimp there is an additional charge of $1, but it included 5 large shrimp.  Each time I have ordered a 4 out of 5 on the spicy scale and it has been consistent in the heat.  I have found that the 4 is just the right amount of spiciness so that the heat is noticeable but at the same time does not overpower the rest of the flavors.

While I have only tried a small portion of their menu, I am absolutely looking forward to going to back continue working my way through it.",Le0uIGp2dzctgU92nDmhgA,4,3,5,TtmdcAa2Gv9xwspe9n5HZg

The Green Curry was phenomenal. Savory , Hot,  spicy, awesome goodness. I like my curry hot so I went with 4/5 heat and it was perfect. Next time I will try very hot. 

Special Fried rice was filled with pork, chicken, beef, shrimp (all fresh) and seasoned nicely. Portion size was large.

We ate on the side patio and it's amazing how when you are enjoying great food even along a busy road like Rancho, it seems like a small Oasis. Not sure how much Id enjoy eating inside the sports bar as it is rather dark and does come along with the usual bar smells and sights. 

A special thank you to our server Kim who did not just give great service she was a joy to talk to and very friendly. She made our experience even better.

Also want to give Kim and the owners a special thank you for finding my handbag I had left on the back of my chair. They kept it safe and had been trying to find a way to get in touch with us to return it.

CHICKEN SATAY: Five-skewer appetizer, oddly served with slices of wheat bread? The chicken was juicy, peanut sauce was tasty, and the cucumber salad complemented it well. 
THAI BEEF SALAD: Not my favorite version, a touch spicier than expected. Generous portion for the low price ($8?), but we kind of just picked at this.
MOO GOO GAI PAN: Ordered this with chicken, came with rice. Good mix of veggies and a large portion, but the sauce wasn't the usual light garlic sauce I typically get with this order elsewhere, more of a brown savory sauce? Tasted decent enough, ate it anyway.

I'd never been inside Bailey's Sports Bar, but the new Thai place off to the side of the bar with the sign advertising $5.50 lunch specials from 11am-3pm Monday-Friday got me in the door... to pick up a to-go order.

I entered through the patio area which appeared to be the restaurant entrance. The only nice thing I have to say about the dining area is that there's a pool table in the middle of it... definitely recommending this place for takeout or delivery. They will bring curry right to my front door for only a $1 delivery charge, so that's a nice perk. I followed a sign that said food pick-up, but it was just an empty hallway leading to the kitchen. I turned around and found the waitress in the bar area with my food all packed up and ready to go. She was very friendly, and let me know that they stay open late: 11pm most nights and midnight on Friday and Saturday.

My vegetarian panang lunch special was a very generous meal for $5.50: egg drop soup (most places only serve soup when you dine-in, so this was a surprise), a vegetable egg roll, curry, and white rice. The panang included plenty of tofu and had good flavor with a lot of kaffir lime and lemongrass, though it was a bit spicier than I usually enjoy my curries. Their creamy Thai iced tea helped me cool down. $1.25 per cup seems like a pretty good deal for this tasty drink!

It's a dive bar, so you'll find some burgers and hotdogs on the menu. ""Fusion"" must be the caprese salad and chicken parmesan that also made the lineup. Think of it as Thai food to go (not to be confused with the inexpensive and delicious eastside joint) and check out the lunch specials!",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,8,5,4,u60hiAeCTmaEEg-CBeaq4w

Our waitress was super sweet and the service was great.
The food came out fast and fresh. My sister in law and I both got pad Thai and my boyfriend got orange chicken and it was honestly so good!
My only complaint would be the portion size of the Orange chicken. The Pad Thai was a dollar less and a much bigger portion than the orange chicken! But they were both equally delicious.
I recommend eating outside if the weather permits. It gave a really homey feel. Especially since the inside is connected to a bar.

We ordered the Mongolian Beef *4 spicy for my daughter, Chicken pad thai *2, Tom Ka *2 and a special order of duck curry for my husband. 
All of the food was spot on. They even brought us out some fish sauce for the Tom Ka and the owner and his wife came out to introduce themselves to us. 
The Thai tea was a hit for me because it wasn't super sweet . Some places making it so cloying sweet that you don't even know your drinking tea. Plus at the low price of $1.25 you can't go wrong. 
The location of this place is in a bar, but with the warmer weather upon us you can go onto the patio to eat if the smoke bothers you.

2621927,2013-08-20,5,yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA,"Tucked inside of Bailey's Restaurant and Bar on the Southwest corner of Craig and Rancho, this little Thai restaurant was a pleasure to visit.  It is owned by Tick, the original owner of Komol.  The Thai restaurant is basically the dining area of the bar.  It's a little smokey, and the bar definitely has a dive sports bar feel to it with a Coors logo of every NFL team lining the room. Surprisingly, one of the pioneers in the Las Vegas Thai food scene has made his return to Vegas in this little bar.  

We ordered the Pad Kee Mao with Pork, the Beef Panang, and the Glass Noodle Salad.  All were entrees and were under $10.  The Pad Kee Mao was out first.  The pork was light and tender, the veggies crisp.  The noodles were a bit heavier than the typical noodle used in this dish.  The sauce was also light, with not a lot of flavor but with a nice balance to it. 

The Beef Panang and the Glass Noodle Salad were my favorite dishes.  Again, both were light in flavor but balanced with authentic ingredients.  The Beef Panang was watery as a good Thai Panang should be, and without peanut sauce.  The spices used did remind me of the Panang at Komol.  I quite enjoyed the flavor of it.  The Glass Noodle Salad was lightly sour, lightly herbed, but it hit all the right spots.  I recommend trying these two dishes.  

Overall this little hidden Thai restaurant is definitely worth a try if you live in the neighborhood.  The heat levels were quite low (we ordered hot, and it was barely spicey), but our server said they have had some problems with customers ordering hot and complaining about it being too hot.  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the Thai restaurant is what I say, but I guess they have a business to run.  She said that now that she knows we can eat spicy, they'll make it Thai hot for us.  

We had a nice little chat with Tick, the owner.  He opened Komol in '79.  The only other Thai restaurant at the time was Kung Fu.  It was a time when people didn't even know what Pad Thai was!  I got a nice little Vegas history lesson on Thai restaurants, and enjoyed his insights.  I will definitely try to come back and visit Tick and our waitress Kim to enjoy some light, but well made Thai food!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,14,9,4,2rqUzEA7gJaoYVcmFE2Kog
2662741,2014-04-26,0,yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA,"It was a cold and windy night and the thought of leaving the house for dinner after 10 pm sounded laborious. We were feeling asian food and decided to order delivery from this place because of the great ratings on yelp. 

We ordered the pad thai chicken, pad see ew beef, and the 10 piece wontons with sweet and sour sauce. The total came out to be about $22 with tax and delivery. That's a good price. 

I would almost agree with Jill C.'s review about the food being super bland and the wrong noodles being used. However, I will give my pros and the cons:

Pros-
They are open late for delivery - until midnight. 

$3 delivery charge is cheap! 

$7 per noodle dish is actually a decent price.

Their chilies in fish sauce were super spicy and had great flavor! Being a spice lover, that is a huge plus in my book. 

Great service - the delivery guy was a super sweet old man. He was so kind and made sure we got for everything we ordered.


Cons-
The pad see ew noodles used were not the common wide noodles but they were chow fun noodles. They were not as wide and also had more of a firm bite. It was not disgusting, just not traditional. 

Yes, the noodle dishes were bland and one noted. I needed to add 1 whole container of chilies in fish sauce to add salt, flavor, depth, and spice. It really helped. 

The pad thai was dry and I prefer my noodles wet and juicy! 

The sweet and sour sauce was watery so it didn't adhere to the wonton chip too well when we dipped. 

Overall the food isn't 5 stars or what we would typically call amazing, but the mom and pop shop is affordable and offers delivery at off hours, plus the food isn't terrible.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,5,0,3,lQOum_X2cB-tb8W66Ga0Vw

We had dinner at Lotus of Siam a few nights prior and that was obviously amazing. So on our drive home, we passed through the area and stopped by at the recommendation of a friend. It's a little awkward to find and you basically need to end up at the sports bar to even see the sign. Don't let this dissuade you - the food is a very pleasant surprise considering the strange location.

Since we had spent the weekend overeating in Vegas, we only ordered two entrees: pad thai and 'thai mint' (essentially spicy basil chicken). They were both delicious and we'd even go as far to say that the pad thai was on par with Lotus of Siam. The woman who served us was incredibly sweet and courteous.

The Thai Mint is a stir fry with onions and green peppers to be eaten with rice. It tastes like a home cooked meal and you can't beat the price. Even with the extra dollar it was only nine bucks. I didn't have any drinks but the beer selection was a bit small. All the traditional staples: Stella, Blue Moon, Guinness, Bud Light... etc. This is a great Thai selection in the Northwest.

Basil Thai-Fusion is a one off, located off of Ranch & Craig, in the dining area of Bailey's Restaurant and Bar.  Yes.  I was confused when I first found it.  The night we went?  It was karaoke night, and wow, were there a number of drunk folks ready to sing along to Lionel Richie's 'What a Feeling'.  Since we had our kid in tow, we opted to do take out from the kitchen.  Although in retrospect I would have loved to throw down a rendition of 'Maneater' by Hall & Oates and leave the crowd AMAZED.

One great thing about Basil Thai-Fusion is the prices.  Since the food is created in a little kitchen, savings on overhead can be had, and those savings get passed along to the customer!  Nearly every main item on the menu is priced between a healthy $6 - $9 (unless you get the NY Strip which will set you back $17).  Nice value!  I love savin' me some green for the slot machine!

Another plus?  The food!  Really, it is pretty good.  We shared:

-Thai Beef Salad - Beef marinated in thai spices, grilled, then placed over a bed of lettuce and veggies
-Pad Thai with chicken - Pan fried noodles in house-made basil tamarind sauce with egg, bean sprouts, green onions, and topped with peanuts
-Thai Mint with beef - Mint leaves cooked with thai spices and chiles

Thai food is so delicious!  Complex flavors of sweet, spicy, tangy, salty, when done right it can ooze UMAMI!  Basil Thai-Fusion knows how to do it right.  Even in take out boxes the food was still good.  My only concern?  Watch your spiciness level!  If you don't like hot spicy foods, stick to a 0 or 1.  Trust me!  A level 5 on the spice meter at this place might burn your mouth a bit.  And I like spicy food.  We went with a level 3 heat and that still was enough to make us sweat bullets.  But I just couldn't stop eating.  Love.  Hate.  Love.  Hate.  Love!

You gotta come to Basil Thai-Fusion to do their lunch special.  Cheap on the cheap!  The lunch special is served daily from 11 AM - 3 PM.  You can choose from 14 different entrees, and each come with your choice of fried rice or white rice, soup, and an eggroll.  All for less than $6!  Go for the Pepper Steak or the Panang Curry.  Sounds delicious.
  
Service was good, our lone girl waitress/hostess was very friendly and was apologetic when we said we would wait outside for our take out order because it was smoky inside.  When we come back again I think we will probably eat in the outdoor patio area of the restaurant, or just do take out again.

Quality of food..
The taste was sub-par. I had Mongolian beef, panang curry, chicken fried rice and egg drop soup. 
I have had much better from other Thai food places, and for the same price. The good eventually gave me an upset stomach and I did not even want to eat the leftovers later. Will not be returning.",FLEQPo_PpBKvn3fZS_75Lw,2,0,2,xjasFGX1JbFGTJqWWzXIXg

So ya, it's literally a hole in the wall of Bailey's like everyone says.  You walk to the side, and there is a door. No, not the cool speakeasy type with the eyelid, nor is it the magical portal wardrobe door to Narnia levels of otherworldly flavors.  It look like door to a utility closet. Walk in, there is an unattended tiny counter with menu and a bell to ring for service.  She eventually comes and takes your order.  Sit out in the bar area where there are slopped together tables or booths, or sit outside where there are patio tables.  

We outside.  Another couple chose to sit there as well in order to avoid the terribly loud Friday night Karaoke from Baily's. There is NO separation of dining space from Bailey's. It is essentially they closet that is Basil Thai Fusion, inside of Bailey's with no sectioned of seating dedicated to the restaurant.

Why so much on the ambiance and not the food you say?  Well, there isn't much to write about there.  We ordered Calamari and the Beef Pad Kee-Mao (Drunken Noodles), along with a Thai Iced Coffee.  Everything was good. The Beef was nice and tender. Overall nothing special. I liked that the Fried Calamari breading was thinker, more like the of a mozzarella stick than of traditional Calamari, my roommate did not.  Prices were good and cheap.  

But don't expect this amazing drool inducing meal from the hole-in-the-wall gods of South Asia.  Just expect basic Thai food.  Oue to prices, I may go back and try other dishes, but the Pad Kee-Mao (Drunken Noodles) was written up by several other Yelpers as if a food portal had magically opened up from dining heaven whisking us away the strange nonentity of a restaurant that we were in, and feeding mystical Thai wonders into our mouths.

Nah, man, it was OK noodles, standard Thai Iced Coffee, and different calamari. That's it. Oh, on a Friday it's open later.  That a positive as not thet many restaurants are open later on the Northside.",avHtVxFKeMI-fVhllE8qwg,0,0,3,Gf2gYjuZ4xiF63o1eYNGuQ

4523978,2016-04-22,1,yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA,"Tonight was the first night I tried Basil Thai Fusion. My car is in the shop overnight and my cupboards were bare so I needed some food delivered. I live pretty far North and not a lot places will come my way. Plus it had the highest star rating of any of the Asian Cuisine. 

Anyway, ordering was fast and easy but after that there's not a lot of positive remarks I have for this place. 

DELIVERY / SERVICE: When the delivery driver arrived, I handed him $60 cash (the total was $44), only asking for $10 back. The driver said he had it, went to his car and handed me back my cash saying he didn't have any. Strike 1 - How are you going to deliver food, knowing you customer is paying cash, and not carry any sort of change? 

I asked if it was too late to pay with my card and he said he just needed to take my card. He went back to his car and was gone for about 10 minutes. I could see him opening all the doors to his car, the hood of his car, the trunk, then he walked around the surrounding houses for bit. I finally went downstairs and asked what was wrong. He advised me that he misplaced my card. Strike 2 - He let me wait in the doorway for a good 10 minutes and I had to be the one to figure out what was wrong. 

Once I was advised my card was missing he spent another 5 minutes looking for it and finally said he would give me the food for free and contact me when he found my card. I told him that was fine and I'll go inside and cancel the card. 

I walked in the house and no more than 1 minute later the doorbell rings. He found my card and was now in the process of charging me. Strike 3 - He already advised me the food was going to be free due to his misplacing my card, but since he found it before he left, I guess he took back the offer. 

Overall, the delivery driver was a nice guy, but the experience will keep from eating there again, well that experience and the food. 

FOOD: The food is average at best. We ordered the stuffed chicken wings, orange chicken, pad see ewe, and pad thai. The stuffed chicken wings were bland but dipping it in the sauce provided made them okay. The Pad See Ewe and Pad Thai were okay, nothing special, it tasted the same as any average Thai place. The orange chicken was the least appealing dish, the orange sauce lacked balance. It was tart and vinegary and failed to bring the sweet aspect to the dish. I had two pieces of chicken before I couldn't eat anymore. 


Overall, it wasn't a pleasurable experience. It takes a lot for me to score a 1 but I was certainly on the cusp.",ZQJxsFQuyXF87b5rxEvpeg,3,0,2,Px-638iSWx4mZsGj9wXibw

Presentation, however missed the mark due to the measly 2 shrimp that were in the container.  also, I wasn't crazy about paying almost $9 for fried rice(I don't care what the size of the container is).

I see a Thai place and am intrigued and became even more excited seeing two people I trust (Dan and Amanda) reviewed it. Hopped into the car to try something new than the same ole' take out and fast food open late night. 

This Thai food kitchen is integrated as part of Bailey's Bar which definitely is odd and not what you would expect. You sit at this typical divey bar except the menu has Thai. If you sit at the bar they have a bar menu of sorts with things like burgers mixed with the Thai, but ask for a full Thai menu. On the night we were there (Friday), it was bumping with karaoke which added more to the odd placement. The fact that the original owner of Komol is running this place make it even more bizarre, but a promise of some good food.

We both got Thai ice teas and at $1.25 this is the cheapest I've seen this drink being sold and it was good and not too sweet.

Pad Kee Mao with Pork - I think this was pretty good, decent flavor and perfect amount of spice. The pork was good quality and tender. 

Tofu Panang - this is a far more fragrant panang than most places do, definitely like Komols. If you love keffir leaf/ lemongrass type flavor then you might highly enjoy its presence here. The serving was generous and the tofu was lightly fried on the outside but nice and silky inside. Definitely ate this up.

Serving sizes were more than generous as well for the price, we had some leftovers. It was $21ish for our meal for 2 drinks, 2 entrees, 1 extra rice. They do lunch specials until 3pm Mon- Fri as well, so you can get some noms on the cheap here. 

The server was very friendly and attentive. Considering we were on the other side of the bar in a booth, I was apprehensive if we would be seen, but she anticipated our needs and made rounds to check on us. 

Eating in a smokey bar not your thing? Take it to-go and they also do delivery! 

Definitely a great addition to the NW as we don't have a Thai place abundance here, but excited it seems to be authentic and quality Thai at that. I think we will end up getting a lot of take out from here since it's on the way home.

Their delivery is pretty speedy and usually arrives close to or before the time they say they will. The food is pretty decent but I'm kinda annoyed by their idea of ""spicy"" for their curry.

I was stuck at work due to being short staffed, so a few of us ordered. 
I love Thai curry's, so I'm always down to try them before anything else. 

I had the Panang Curry w/ Chicken. They didn't ask for a spice level on the phone, so it was pretty spicy. Which is fine with me, the spicier the better. As long as it doesn't burn your mouth to where you can't taste the flavors. 
The curry was very good, very flavorful and rich. 

The lunch specials are insanely cheap. You get a huge scoop of rice, a spring roll and soup with your order. Most of them are under $6. That's insanely cheap for some good food.

A true hole in the wall...hiding in a bar I could pass by EVERY single day and never notice, let alone see an ethnic restaurant hiding in this dive lol.

When you first walk in, you see tables and chairs, but no real obvious sign that there is a restaurant inside the bar here.  There is a long hallway that brings you to a kitchen, and that's where we got someone's attention to place an order.

We decided to eat in...but I think this is mostly a to-go kind of place.  Maybe if I was here gambling/drinking/darts/pool I would for sure order here!  

They were ok with Little Foodie Dude eating here in the ""restaurant"" side.  It wasn't overly smokey on this side, but I still don't think I would bring him here again.

First up, Thai Mint ($8): ""Pad Ka Pao""....GREAT version here! Tons of flavor in the Chicken and there was a good amount of heat in the spices! One of the better versions of this dish in town in my opinion!

Pad Kee Mao ($7). This was good overall! Lots of flavor in the noodles...packed a bit of heat on my scale but not much. Good stuff, but the Pad Ka Pao wins this round!

Thai Beef Salad ($7). This was a good rendition...beef was tasty and done well. Salad was ok overall.  Good choice!
