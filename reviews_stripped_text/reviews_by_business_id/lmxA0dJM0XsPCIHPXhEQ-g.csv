Unless it is somewhat cooked like starter,  Rok ceviche, that was surprisingly good.  Salmon is fresh and taste good. Some sashimi pieces are cooked, when they should be raw the mackerel for example. The cocktails are good, stong but with mixed perfectly,  their isn't a fight between alcohol and mixes; Sakura and Asking for Trouble.
  The servers are good never pushed us get everything on the menu and always came by to make sure we were satisfied. The same can't be said about the host.  When we ate there the place was empty, too late for lunch to early for dinner, yet she wanted to put us right by a column. We weren't having it and she rolled her eyes and put us somewhere else. The host is everybody's first dinning experience especially if your 1st time.  The decor of the place was awesome, loved the painting on the wall, actually the wall.

It's super entertaining. We ordered the Pink Pagoda which is a fishbowl type drink. While the drink was really good, it did take over 20 minutes from when we ordered it to actually get it. For a $50 drink and a decent sized drink menu, you'd think they'd be on top of it. 

Our food also took forever to come out. Our party of 3 ordered two starters and 3 sushi rolls. The crispy rice and the baked crab hand rolls were really good. The sushi rolls (volcano, el chapo and tiger) were good but I've had better sushi in Vegas. Our waiter Seth was so nice, always checking in throughout the night. I've given 4 stars because the food and drinks tasted good, it was entertaining and the manager did give us 30% off our drink because of how long it took.

The unprofessional waiter recommended some sake to the table "" that just came in"" and  opened the bottle without stating the price.  Then we received a bill for $3,000 for 8 people.The sake was $1400..!!!!!!!!!!!.  Now if you do some searching for Murasaki Sake, it doesn't exist.  Being in the restaurant business for 10 years, I believe that these guys make and bottle some sake that you can't do research on, charge an obscene about of money thinking that their clients will eat feces and pay the bill because they are too embarrassed to complain, and then shove it up your private region just because they think they can.  Please note a bottle of top rated Isojiman Junmai Ginj? is about 115$.  When the staff was confronted, they lied and said it's standard practice to mention the pricing. Now mind you, there were 5 business owners sitting at the table that spend an a ton of money that weekend without incident.   Would you ever spend $1400 on 2 bottles of sake worth 100$?  I thought not.  Then we spoke with the smug owner Todd, the type of guy who makes it a practice to sodomize his customers on over priced sushi, 200$ steaks, and $700 bottles of sake.  He sodomizes you without regret and actually enjoys your pain. Do yourself a favor, go to a real sushi restaurant with professional staff and stay away from  tourist traps like this because there is always a wolf waiting.  Some restaurants don't understand the value that clients like us bring, clients that have no problem spending a lot of money, but instead see it as an opportunity to defraud you and leave a terrible taste in your mouth, long after the after taste of their sushi is gone.",-bAh6-Y1sJIXCdclqSK66A,2,0,1,bccm4sPQCEPRuiAqp8IdNQ

The atmosphere is fun, very loud so don't plan on being able to hold a conversation (I love the vibe if the music could be turned down a slight notch) and if you are shy, beware they pull people from the crowd to interact during their dance/singing routines. 

We had reservations at 8pm and were seated right away but ignored, literally with no one even bothering to say two words to us even though we were passed by multiple people multiple times due to setting up other tables for large parties. If we had to wait, even though there were empty tables, I would have rather waited in the lobby than be ignored and passed by over and over and over without one word. 

I finally ordered a drink that took 10 more minutes to arrive and when it did, it was a substitute since the restaurant was out of the ingredients of the cocktail I had originally ordered. Luckily, I was flexible since I just wanted anything to dull the experience thus far. 

Food came sporadically but was overall good. Pork belly was overlooked.

He got the order wrong and we wound up with a different roll than we wanted but it just seemed pointless to try and get it fixed since our server was still dancing or MIA. Also, it's really loud so be bring your outside voice if you want to have a conversation.

-Yellowtail - Good..oh so tiny tho
-Rok and Roll - What we got instead of what we wanted. Just chopped up fish on a slice of cucumber. 0 flavor.
-Miso Black Cod - Delicious (per my friend) it's his favorite thing to get and I agree.
-Beef Tataki - Good, like others I've had
-Pork Dumplings - Amazing
-Tuna Taco - Chopped up tuna in a taro ""taco"" chip. It wasn't seasoned at all. Wanted wasabi and ginger but the server was gettin down with N'Snyc and Backstreet Boys so we just ate it.

It's an interesting concept and I really enjoyed the energy especially of our own server when I saw him out there but it seems like they focus more on choreography than the food service

We came in after 1pm on a Saturday. The place was virtually empty except for 4, maybe 5 tables. We were asked to wait another 15 minutes so they could set up our table and also because the host didn't want to overwhelm the one and only waitress working. Ok. We get it. No problem. Had a beer at the outside bar. When we finally got seated and looked over the menu, all you can eat menu only covers the appetizers, $5 basic sushi-1 piece only and the basic hand/cut rolls (no specialty rolls). When you order, you can only order 3 items at a time. Not sure if they were having a big party that evening but our first orders didn't come out of the kitchen for 20 min!! How long does it take to prepare 5 appetizers and 2 pieces of sushi (times 6 people)?? We asked to put in our next order since the wait was long and were told by our waitress that we must finish eating our first round of food before we can order again. Granted the fine print also says there is a 1 hour time limit. 
As frustrating as this was, everyone was very nice. Food was delivered with a smile and the food tasted great. 
Still cant understand why the food took so long to come out. Even waited 15 minutes for mochi.

I sat down right before they started one of their shows which seemed to be a ""boy-band battle"" The energy in the room was contagious! I could see everyone's faces light up as we were entertained by the music from the live DJ and then the show!

I have been to quite a few restaurants in Las Vegas but haven't seen a venue that is this unique. It feels like it belongs in Tokyo, San Francisco or New York. There was cool street art all over the place and there was a giant video wall that went with the shows. Little details everywhere that you typically don't see anymore

I am a sushi snob and can be hard to please at times, but the food came out fast and was delicious! You could taste the quality in each item! The Omakase Platter was my favorite item on the menu. I also ordered the El Chapo roll and loved the tomatillo sauce! We decided to get the Tomahawk Steak as well and with the Truffle butter on top it was simply amazing. They brought it out on this cool Godzilla platter that came with a cool presentation. To finish dinner we ordered the Honey Toast, and it was LIFE CHANGING!

They are a bit gimmicky for my taste.  We went before the Garth Brooks concert and the waitstaff was all dressed in ""country"" attire and the specials were all huge steaks. I suppose they were catering to the T-Mobile Arena audience, but the character of the place got lost a bit in all of that for me. What I didn't realize until later, was that the party/fun element is part of what they do. 

I loved the entrance with the huge sake barrels--the whole place has a minimalist, urban, industrial thing going on. Who doesn't these days? But after you are seated they bring you these huge menus that are a great conversation piece. But a hassle for reading and selecting. 

The group ordered a ton of food, but I only tasted the roasted cauliflower, the miso soup, and the sashimi.  This is NOT the type of place to come expecting  high quality fish--I don't care what the waitress says.  I knew it when we picked this place and I'm glad my expectations were low. There is better quality fish to be had in most other sushi places in this valley. But those in our party with cooked dishes seemed to really enjoy them. 

There was this simmering party atmosphere because at a designated time, the waiters were all prepared break into song and dance. People were dancing around a bit in anticipation of their performances and a lively emcee was serving sake bombs to various tables. 

Sake bombs are definitely a thing here. You will be made aware of each one that is consumed.

We left before the festivities began, but I can see people either loving or hating that element of the vibe. If you're not into it, arrive early. The ""show"" starts at 7:00. 

In all, tourists will like it. 

I actually appreciate what they are doing at Sake Rok--I'm all about an entertaining meal and a bit of spectacle. This is Vegas, right? But, for me, the food just didn't offer enough to bring me back.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,4,0,3,Gx0SCx4aIq1So3I1SGjlEw

1158305,2018-04-15,0,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"My hubby and I were walk-ins here last night before heading to a concert. It was our first time and we found out it's a reservation type of place. Hostess asked if we could be done by 6:15 since they were totally booked for the night (it was 4:45 & we were a party of 2). We agreed and they sat us. After ordering drinks, the hostess asked to move us to another table and provided free sake bombs for the move. We would have moved either way but a very nice offer. 
The atmosphere was very fun and had a ready to party feel about it. I bet if we went later in the evening we would have loved that about this place. 
The food was on par with a regular sushi restaurant.  (REMEMBER that this location is on the LV strip so prices are almost doubled from a regular sushi place. You really are paying for location.) I tried the miso soup (5 stars), king crab California roll (3 stars / pretty average) and nigiri yellowtail (5 stars) and tuna (3stars/ too fatty). My husband, loved the shishito peppers (warning: seeds galore. Yes I know peppers have seeds but these peppers have A LOT of seeds). He also had a kamikaze roll (5 stars). They also had the freshest ginger I have had in the longest time for a sushi restaurant! 
Service was decent. It was early opening for dinner, they were getting things organized and we were given 3 different servers in the hour we were there. All 3 of the servers were pleasant and helpful. But with so many changes in a short period, usually results in mistakes. The requirement for our seating was to be finished at a certain time, hard to do when it takes 15 minutes just to get water and our beers. The 2nd server introduced himself but didn't offer to take our food order, weird. Our first server came back around and gave us our free sake bombs, (that was a fun experience) and then took our food order (30 minutes after seating) My husband ordered a second beer when we received our food, which first was served to the table next to us, and came at the end of our meal. Then about 5 minutes later the bartender brought a 3rd beer that he didn't order. We sent it back because we were finished. A minute later he brought it back saying it was on the house. It wasn't! We were charged for it. For $12 a beer my husband ended up drinking it! We didn't want to wait for someone to come back around, change the check and wait awhile to see one of those 3 servers again. 
All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience. The food was about 4 stars, which is what matters most, service 3 stars (I'm chalking it up to opening time) and atmosphere was definitely 5 stars).",zWqhChAvazn0OmEx5TtnHg,0,0,4,jluJMmGNLPN-PrXuRZG7qw

We also ordered a seafood appetizer platter and told we would each get a piece yet it came with 3 pieces each and  ( 2 oysters) when we questioned why we were told they ran out of oysters but never bothered to let us know or even bothered to substituted so we all had to try and share. My cocktail was horrible it tasted like a margarita with olive oil. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because this place is quite entertaining. I Would only come back for sake and beer.

1229727,2017-11-07,1,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"I would highly advise making a reservation. We stumbled across it, and it looked pretty empty when we arrived but the 4 hostesses at the entrance let us know it would be a 30 minute wait for 2 people. Luckily there is a bar outside to order a drink while you wait. There were people with the same size party and no reservation that got seated before us, so it wasn't off to a great start. Honestly, it did start to fill up quickly as the night went by. I could be wrong and maybe all the other empty tables were all reserved. But the hostesses could have been a little more inviting when we told them we didn't have a reservation.

However, as soon as we got to our table it was nothing but amazing! The wait staff came by every 10 minutes to see if we needed anything. It wasn't just waiting on one server to come around, it was a team effort with everyone working the tables and making sure everyone was taken care of. They were helpful, upbeat, and attentive. Even in between performing. I loved the vibe so much.

There was a DJ and an MC who went through all the tables to make sure everyone was having fun. It was definitely entertaining with everyone breaking out in dance and singing. It happened to be my friends birthday the next day, she was so happy that we came across this!

I've had a lot of great sushi, my standards are a little high. The food was ok, but good enough to where I'm still looking forward to revisiting next time I'm in Vegas. And they had some awesome drink choices.

I don't know how some of these places make it but this newly opened sushi spot has created their own niche for sushi dining in sin city. If you are in the mood for a low key sushi spot where you can chat with the chefs or have an audible conversation at your table, then you better keep walking. Here you will find tons of entertainment. This Located in the Park, it is set in a perfect location outside of the new T-Mobile arena. We walked in about 10pm on Saturday night, closing time was posted at 10:30pm but I was told that they will stay open until the last person leaves. 

At first, I wasn't 100% sold on it. It was extremely loud inside and they sat me right next to a large post that takes up a lot of space. It was like I was in trouble or something or they were trying to hide me from the place because of my looks. HAHA! Seriously, I would recommend they do something about that spot for patrons. It is not the most conducive place for eating or enjoying the overall experience of the restaurant. I guess I could have said something but I sucked it up and rolled with it. The service was a bit slow at first and it took a few minutes for our server to acknowledge us but it was probably because I was sitting behind a large post and they couldn't see my big head. I probably would have made this a 5-star spot but the post thing wasn't cool. After that the service was wonderful. The beer and cocktails kept coming. 

We weren't too hungry but went with a few appetizers, agadashi tofu, shishito peppers, seaweed salad (delicious), mixed tempura (way overpriced for $18), and miso soup for the wifey. They do not have a lot of options for sushi/sashimi and be forewarned that the pieces are priced for 1 piece of sushi. One piece of uni is $8, etc. Not a big deal because it's Vegas where things are way overpriced and they know stupid people like me will pay for it. I had the sashimi platter (chef's choice, so not the best pieces but they were okay) for $40. It was decent. I would probably order again but I should have tried something different rather than the sushi since they have so many offerings. Overall, the food was good. 

The entertainment is the main attraction here. The MC for the night goes around messing with people. Be careful because if you look shy you will most likely get called out. He will persuade you to dance and make a fool of yourself. Hey, it's Vegas so whatever happens there will stay there, so just let the inner fool out, you know it's hiding in there and has been dying to come out. There happened to be a Lakers/Warriors preseason game that just let out and the Laker girls came in to dine. Yeah! I'm a huge fan but my wife told me to leave them alone. The MC got them in on the action and a few of them danced on stage. It was cool. 

Servers were nice and attentive (after they realized we were there). Food was good and drinks were great. We didn't order a huge meal or that many drinks and the bill was a little much, with tip it came out to $230. So if you are budget minded this is not your place. You are paying for the ambience and entertainment value. I probably won't try it again. FYI- the bathrooms are unisex. Have a great time and try it out.

We were horribly disappointed. They gave each table tiny plates of food, which we all thought were appetizers.  People picked at it and tried not to take too much so that everyone would be able to eat some, only to find out that those were the entree and not the appetizers.  Not only were the portions tiny, the food was not good - especially given the price we paid.

When tables started to complain, they brought out a few more plates of food, only to tell us that they had cooked everything they had and wouldn't be able to feed us any more.  Needless to say, all 300 people were very unhappy and hungry. We ended up having to order pizzas. You would think that a restaurant venue would prepare themselves for a large group of people and have enough food on hand, but apparently quantity of food didn't cross their minds. They were aware of the menu we were choosing, and should have warned us if they had known ahead of time that it wouldn't be enough for THREE HUNDRED people.

The staff was unfriendly and had serious attitude, further frustrating our group. We tried to host an awards ceremony on the top floor which was even more horrifying than the meal (sounds impossible, but it's true). The space was small and dark and their sound system was HORRIBLE.  Their microphones were squealing and kept cutting out.  The owner, who was supposed to be in charge of the sound, was rude and dismissive and didn't seem to care that their system wasn't operating correctly.

They do have some more regularly priced rolls that are about the size (six pieces) that you'd expect from a regular california roll (those are about $7 to $10 dollars). The drinks are awesome. The party atmosphere in the evenings is so fun and sure to leave you grinning. The shows that they put on every once in a while are HILARIOUS. The servers are all sweet and charming. The MC is a blast and an absolute oddball. 

The show stealer though is the dessert! The honey toast is PHENOMENAL. Unreal. It is so like the most amazing french toast you could ever dream. Sweet and crunchy but also moist.

Sake Rok redefines the conventional dining experience by bringing a spectacle of culinary creations and eclectic performances.

Part Culinary:
Chef Bobby Silva showcases his unique culinary skills with a menu of Japanese popular dishes with a unique twist of fusion. The menu varies with shared plates of Crispy Sashimi Tacos to irresistible entrees such as their Pan-Seared Scallops. They have unique offerings of sushi rolls: Puff the Magic Dragon Roll with snow crab, avocado, eel, eel sauce, and fresh cucumber. Be sure to ask your friendly server about their one-of-a-kind Godzilla Platter!

As for alcoholic drinks, their highlights include their specialty cocktails such as Whiskey On The Rok which is their ""signature five spice infused old fashioned featuring Old Forester Bourbon."" Be adventurous and order their signature Sake Bombs! 

They may be known for their fresh sushi and house sake, but they also have tender and flavorful steak. My personal favorite: Their enticing 42 oz Wagyu Tomahawk Steak with foie gras and rich butter. 

For dessert, I highly recommend their Honey Toast, it is undeniably mouthwatering! They say that the portion is large enough to share with several, but you would NOT want to share it after one savory bite. 

Part Performance:
Sake Rok transforms into an alluring spectacle: their multi-talented servers are also your entertainers!  The interactive entertainers invite you, their guests, to be part of the vivacious spectacle. 

This is not just a place to dine or to spectate --- it is a place that encourages all of us to let loose and release our inhibitions. Come ready to immerse yourself to an unexpected and unforgettable experience!",cGok9ycGn_HvZaht9xkyPw,37,36,5,EaRcBv_Aw_UyWcmy2f3ScA

They brought him up on stage, sat him in a big chair, and had beautiful woman dance all around him. After that they hooked him up with a ninja headband which he proudly boasted the duration of our Vegas Trip and referred to himself as the Sake bomb ninja king lol.

-salmon sashimi
-tuna belly toro sashimi
-mushroom side dish (I can't remember the name, but it's amazing)
-tuna tacos
-HONEY. TOAST.

I used to always get honey toast from Ichiza, but Sake Rok's really is better. The cubed brioche inside with butter, cinnamon and honey, with their vanilla custard is unreal. Save room for it.

And, having grown up on N'sync and Backstreet Boys, I personally love the throwback performances the staff does. *Pro tip* Park in the parking garage of the Monte Carlo and scan Nevada ID (or borrow a friend's!) to get free parking!

There's a good variety of apetizers but the weird thing is we ordered the dumplings and they were served in halves, 5 of them, what happened to the 6th half (that would make for 3 whole dumplings)?

I'm gluten free so the server was able to recommend a few options and even keep sauces on the side with gluten. They also had gluten free soy sauce. This may not seem like a big deal but it's been difficult to find gluten free sushi so I really appreciate their accommodations.

Sake Rok isn't a restaurant so much as it's an immersive experience with food. It wasn't what I expected at all, but our large group had a great time!

The menu features mostly sushi dishes, with expected pricing for the Strip location. Splurge for the Godzilla sushi platter or a handful of apps and rolls to share. Standouts for us were the Sashimi Tacos (eat them fast or the shells will get soggy!), Rock Shrimp Tempura (great spicy kick!), Japanese-Style Elote (didn't expect to like this but it was a hit at the table!), and the Honey Toast Boat (easily enough to feed 10). Everything was beautifully presented, fresh, and full of flavor. There are entree and steak dishes for those in your party who don't like it raw.

However, the whole dinner experience was one of the worst that my boyfriend and I have had. We bought a ""dinner & a show"" package for Valentine's day so our dinner was prepaid. We showed up at 7pm and our show was at 9:30pm. A couple minutes after being seated, Caesar came over and offered us some water and told us who our server would be (can't remember her name but I'm assuming she's new). Maybe 5 minutes later our server came over to take our drink and food orders. The table across from us got their drinks and food before we even got our drinks and we got there before them. It took 15 minutes just to get one of our drinks and it was only because we told Caesar we didn't get it yet. 20 minutes later Caesar saw that we didn't have our food so he went to check and the waitress didn't even put our order in. Finally, our food came out and we were happy that Caesar was checking in on us. Half way through our meal they brought my boyfriend another drink that we didn't ask for.

When we asked Caesar for a box he told our original waitress to get us a box, which took her 5 minutes. We then had to ask for our bill and 10 minutes later (8:50pm) she comes back and says she has to get a manager to check our prepaid receipt. 5 minutes later the manager comes down, looks at the receipt then says ""so what's the question?"" When I told him that we were just waiting for our final bill he seemed confused as to why the waitress even called him over. We left at 9:15 to go to our show. Our finally bill charged us for two of my boyfriends drinks even though we only ordered one. We would have corrected them but didn't want to wait another 20 mins for our waitress to figure out what she was doing. 

Long story short, that waitress either needs better training or shouldn't be a waitress if she can't handle more than one table at a time. 

I recommend this place for the atmosphere, the entertainment, & the food. Definitely ask for Caesar's table.",Hw-84eUOPDQ25IJSd0pCXQ,0,0,1,IUw1ytCrfrJUkn7tn1LlvA

Let me start by saying I was stalking this restaurant before it even opened thanks to Eater's column for new openings in Vegas. WOW am I glad this was a destination fulfilled! 

Having only been opened for a month I was beyond ecstatic to try this place. Being in a good local was also a perk because I was able to experience the new Park and see the  new majestic Dancer statue! Upon entering, I loved the glowing lanterns that were on display in the foyer which immediately gave a vibrant electric feel against all of the dope graffiti art lining the walls. We did not have reservations and we were sat at the sushi bar which was fine but it was uncomfortable having to wiggle around in my seat to look back at all of the entertainment, which is why, I highly recommend you make reservations in advance! 

We ordered:
ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA 
TEMPURA ROLL
TIGER ROLL

Everything we had was amazing! The rock shrimp was an appetizer and a hefty portion was given. It was very spicy and crunchy and completely savory! The tempura isn't your average tempura roll. The entire roll was deep fried! Sinful! And my tiger roll was more a common roll but still delicious! I wouldn't recommend ordering too much tempura choices bc that's a lot of fried food for one sitting. 5 stars for food! 

Vegas is the entertainment capital of the world and Sake Rock knows how to be that bold outlier, shameless in their performance, and all out flamboyant! Props to the David Bowie, kmono and spiky platform wearing, MC that kept the party rolling all night! Lights, camera, action, starting at 7:30pm and every half hour after, your severs will perform full out choreographed dances from Afro wearing MoTown to Lady Gaga Born This Way, and even Madonna Vogue! They wil throw money from the balcony! Dolla Dolla Billz Ya'll! They will stunt and be carried high in the air! I have no idea how organized and n'sync they stay from multi tasking, serving an entire restaurant and keeping up with all the dance moves, never spilling anything and always staying on beat! Shiz! Tip your sever well! They are straight up party gurus and the definition of work hard play hard! 

The Restrooms are Unisex so Ladies don't feel weird walking into the bathroom with a male attendant. If you want privacy take care of fixing yourself up in your stall bc it can get a little weird in front of the communal mirror. I personally didn't like this. I was adjusting my dress at the communal sinks just as the male attendant was handing me a hand towel and it made for an extremely awkward moment. As well as a little uncomfortable. Then to make up for it the attended tried a go at small talk and I just wanted to get out of the bathroom. Lol. Smh. Fair waring. 

Ranging about $60 for two people with non alcoholic drinks it's totally worth the visit. I recommend coming in a big group bc the MC will notice your table and get you up and dancing and take sake bombs with you and you can have a mini keg at your table! This place is almost better for groups than coming in as 2 people so invite the squad! If I could, I would totally quite my day job just to be a Sake Rok girl!",6av0qSdZlDG6rapm3zH_sg,7,3,5,3MlgkGTy3oye5yQppv5v4A

There's a DJ playing great music that was perfect for a hip upbeat environment. It's music you want to groove to. A mix of new & old school top 40. The staff randomly dances to Madonna, another to *NSYNC vs BSB. Me & the hubs had a really fun time eating amazing food & just a really fun environment. 

We decided to order a bunch of small plates to share which was perfect so we could also get dessert.

Rok shrimp - little nuggets of shrimp friend in a light tempura batter then tossed in a spicy cream sauce. This was my favorite. 

Karage chicken - lightly battered fried chicken nuggets served with a ginger ponzu sauce to dip in. 

S&P shrimp - skewered fried shrimp fried & served with a creamy, I think cilantro sauce. Not a spicy as I was expecting. 

Scallops - so tender & juicy & perfectly seared. I'm not sure what type of sauce/broth it was served with but it was delicious. 

El Chappo roll - it was good but again it said spicy but was lacking that kick. I would try different roll next time. 

Edemame Rok - spicy & refreshing bc of the lime/lemon seasoning. 

Honey toast - the best thing they have. Cinnamon sugar crusted croutons, stuffed on a vanilla custard topped with fresh berries & vanilla ice cream. It reminded me of cream brûlée, honey toast & captain crunch had a baby. I may go back just for this. 

We had to get a sake bomb to join in on the sake Rok sake bomb fun. A nice draft Kirin was perfect pairing with the meal.",bf-MBZUzp-arMSKvcp_3AA,4,3,5,iDJ5E-JUEtNQCSeNkl_D8g

The second floor has seats that looks down into the first floor with guests watching the show.  We had prime seating close the the center bar.  

The wait staff was amazing and there is an ""MC"" that comes by all the table and chats with everybody to make sure you're enjoying the food and show.  He also takes sake bombs with the guests. (I can't believe how much this guy can drink!!)

Then food comes very quickly and its AMAZING!!!  The prawns, roasted chicken, sushi rolls, and drinks were out of this WORLD!!  So good.    My favorite is the Stuffed French Toast!!   All the girls I came with were so stuffed with food.  It was just so delicious!  BONUS: Plates get cleared away fast so you know service is fab here.

2003650,2016-08-29,0,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"Our concierge recommended this place and we were excited to try it out. We were told the servers perform songs in between serving their tables and that sounded like a great time for dinner. 

We arrived at 10:00pm and the place was pretty packed but they sat us right away. The decor was cool, the music was loud but not blaring, the clientele looked young and fun, the performing servers did a great job entertaining the crowd, etc. 

The Service: 
We were sitting there for about 10min and were never handed menus. Fine, it's busy, I understand. Although I saw our server walking around the restaurant, I didn't see him doing anything specific. I tried plenty of times to make eye contact/flag him down but he simply forgot we were there or something. But then a new table was seated right next to us and they were handed their menus, then their drinks, then their appetizer... all before we were even given menus. Eventually, our waiter came by and quickly dropped off menus and said he'd be right back. The problem was that he didn't come back for another 15min which meant we were there for 25min in total just waiting for someone to come by to take a beer order. My friend and I agreed that if our server didn't come by in the next few minutes then we were leaving. Sure enough, those minutes rolled around so we picked up our purses to head out and who walks on over but our server asking if we're ready with our drink orders (Seriously? drink orders? we've been ready with those for 20min). So I said to him ""Listen, we were just getting up to leave. I understand that it's busy for you guys but not a single person acknowledged us or even thought to take a drink order."" Our server then said ""Oh, sorry guys, I'll take care of you."" Since we were both starving, we gave him our small order and hoped it would come quickly. 
We noticed how many tables were emptying so we were curious to check what time they closed. Found out the place closed at 10:00pm (right when we arrived) which made the whole experience worse. You'd think that if a place was closing then they'd do their best to get those tables taken care of so they can leave sooner. Instead, we were there until 11pm even though we only had a small dinner.  We looked over our check at the end to see that our server didn't ""take care of us"" like he implied earlier. I mean, I thought that meant at the very least a comped beer to lessen the blow that he forgot about us for 30min. Instead, I felt like he walked all over us.

The Food:
Our entire dinner order was one edamame appetizer, two rolls each (so 4 total), and two large beers and it all came out to $100 before tip. The sushi itself was pretty mediocre and the garlic edamame was much spicier than we anticipated. The sad thing was that we were both hungry only a few hours after spending all that money on that tiny dinner. There are countless top quality places in Vegas and I see no point in returning to this restaurant.


tl;dr
Although this place had an upbeat atmosphere, it was way overpriced and the risk of crappy service again seems too high. Not my type of sushi joint.",aY0kiv5U3U0eHpyjbwv-5w,2,0,2,IZg4IXTyB1deZTekwqE26A
2007041,2016-05-11,4,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"A group of us (six people) walked in this evening around 9:15. We may not have been your usual crowd (crossdressers) but we were dressed well and kept to ourselves. There was what looked like an office gathering near us, sure they stared but didn't bother us. We sat down and ordered our food.

We were starting to wonder when our food didn't arrive after 30 mins. It wasn't busy and most tables were already eating - we were the only new party that was seated. We asked numerous people what the deal was and we got no definitive answer. We kept looking at the sushi ""chefs"" and they just looked at us with blank stares. Weren't they wondering why we were just sitting there with no food? They kept staring at us and not doing anything about it. Even the entertainer was wondering where our food was.

When some of our food arrived, we were thinking our food was finally coming. Nope. We continued to wait for another 30 minutes. No other tables were being sat and at this point, the sushi area was starting to close down. Shortly thereafter, the manager came over and said the waiter ""forgot"" to put our order in. So you mean to tell us that he put in part of our order (which was also incorrect) and then he forgot to put in the rest? We all felt super annoyed and upset. We got up and left.

If you're a trans person, crossdresser or anything similar, do not go here. They are NOT T FRIENDLY. They will smile in your face and treat you with no respect. If you're not a trans person, DO NOT come here. There are far better places than this in Vegas. We all felt discriminated against tonight and its a horrible feeling.

But both Matt and I felt that the food stayed otherwise.

All plates we had were beyond too salty to even enjoy. 

The bottle of sake we got was the worst sake we've ever had, being from Hollister CA. 

And I think it just.. was too salt over all. 

Matt and I had:
Crispy rice appetizer - think of a 50¢ quarter sized rice about a centimeter high, soaked in a salty sauce, topped with spicy tuna.... may or hold off of the sauce? We actually asked to have it taken back and the waiter was more than welcome to take it off of our bill for us. 

We also tried scallops here... unfortunately it was too salty as well. Decorated with green chives and a foam on top and veggies on the bottom. 

Matt said if he didn't order a side of rice, the food would've not been eatable... 

We had two rolls. I forget their names but both were on the spicy side. Salty as well.

I'm not sure if salt was accidentally spilled on our food or.... people don't mind it but we literally left half of our food.

Unfortunately, this time our overall experience failed our expectations. Most of the food was heavily salted and they actually forgot one of our sushi rolls after they said it was ""on its way."" Really? The music was pathetic by playing N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs for a place called ""Sake Rok."" However, I did enjoy the dancers and overall entertainment because they tried hard to entertain us, so kudos to them! But, by far the worst part was the service because our server disappeared more often than he appeared. We had to flag him down many times just to get service if we could find him!!! So, based on this experience and with so many other Japanese-themed Strip restaurants to choose from, we will never be coming back.",2Psj6-azDDYzpAT98et9QA,0,0,3,i8pALmOpWS8yqbqpwpnNKQ

As mentioned in other reviews these folks really pride themselves on the entertainment factor with the dancing and singing etc so if you're looking for a unique experience I'd really suggest it because lots of people were having fun. 

However it did seem to take away from the service delivery on the dining side:

We were seated by the Door was which was open on a chilly evening. We asked for the door to be closed or for us to be moved. We were told that the door couldn't be closed (?) but when they realized that they had reservations which prohibited from us being moved they finally closed the door. However at the end of the meal they opened the door again. We were close to the end of the meal so we didn't push the issue but the draft was pretty annoying.

Food comes out as its prepared. Bussers are  very quick to bus your table but they'd take EVERYTHING away so we'd have to ask for additional plates and silverware on a couple of occasions.

We ordered the Brussel sprouts which never arrived. When we asked at the end of the meal to make sure we weren't charged the server said they were still being cooked (over an hour at this point). We paid our bill and the server said the food was still coming even though we weren't being charged. We finished our drinks but after another 15 minutes we were done and still no Brussel sprouts so we left. Not that we were still hungry but still... 

They push Sake bombs pretty hard at this place. I'm no prude by any means and have had more than a few in my day so when the emcee came over to introduce herself and starred pushing them I said we would buy a round if she joined us. She said that sounded awesome and would join us so I bought a round for the table and her. However when the shots came she made up an excuse as to why she couldn't take the shot. No big deal but because of the hard sell we felt like there was a bit of a bait and switch.

These things are all easily fixed and when they are this place will be a solid 4 if you're looking for that kind of vibe and experience. Until then a solid 3.",Spgm6HFWgc4YXJlbhg11Pg,2,0,3,5k_CN5plEYoLQ0x0z_2D3A

Everything looked normal at first, but within minutes the lights went out, loud music blasted, and staff came running out in wigs and glasses and began dancing on the bar and around the restaurant. This was a pleasant, fun surprise for us, as we were out for a bachelorette celebration, but those with their family trying to have a nice, quiet sushi meal should look elsewhere. The host was a complete crack up. He had wild and crazy makeup, luscious, long, curls (way to go if that is your natural hair) and very flamboyant outfits that he changed regularly throughout our meal. He did an excellent job of keeping the restaurant alive and engaged.  

Our table ordered the sake bomb special, which was $80 and included a very small pony keg of beer and two porcelain tokkuri of sake. This was enough for about 14 sake bombs, which made them about $5.70 each. The host came over and did one with us, while announcing the entire process to the restaurant over the microphone. 

The sushi was expensive, but I'll admit that's because I come from the land of affordable ""all you can eat"" sushi in Northern Nevada. Each roll was $20, plus or minus a few dollars. Side items like edamame, miso, etc., were $6 each. This ended up being a very expensive outing for our group of 8, but the atmosphere was really fun and lively, and the food was fine. 

Certainly not the best sushi I've ever had, but if I found myself back in Vegas with friends looking for a fun meal, I'd return.",lwMRSo8NcI49Kuc8wvPIzQ,9,5,5,TSk-qjkb7cjf4XiOFAhjXw

Probably would give this place three stars but the brussels sprouts were worth seven stars (Best Brussel sprouts I have ever had), so will round up to four stars.

We got here at 6 pm and got our food at about 7pm.  Well, let me clarify, we received out edamame at that time. We ordered a round of drinks and they took a very long time to come out.  

At about 6:50 pm the server Rich T, came up to us and apologized that our order was not put in because the tables were wrong.  I have no idea what that meant.  Then he asked if he could offer us some sake.  No one in our table ordered sake.  So we did not respond.   Our food started to come out at about 7 pm.   And by food I mean our two rolls and our edamame.  My friend ordered a drink which was awful and advised the server to please replace it.  We had to remind him twice and had to get a manager to get get out the new drink.   He offered us sake again, at this point we just said okay. 

The server came came back to see if we needed anything else about 7:35pm.  At which time we inquired about the rest of our order, specially our scallops.  He made a face and ran into the kitchen.  Clearly, the rest of the order was not placed.  

We waited about 10 more minutes.  The order never came.  We flagged Rich down to advise him that we needed to leave and to please cancel the rest of the order.  My friend went to the manager to share his experience and was told sorry.

The check came and had items that never came.  I understand they they just opened but no one knows where the food goes.  

I would not recommend this restaurant at all.  Fun atmosphere great music.   I would have loved to taste the food but it never came.  If you want cocktails and if you wanna watch servers dance, please have a few drinks.  But it was about 7pm and they ran out of items on their main menu for drink.   We had to order different items.  

We requested for a male manager this time after speaking to Raika, he also apologized and stated they were not making excuses.

Food came out looked great and tasted dangerously good ""not surprised"" since I've been there before but my client looked at me again and was like WOW!!! lol

We ordered the El Chapo and Tiger Rolls. Both were bite-size, delicious, and perhaps more creative than the average roll. They had lots of options for people who can't hang with raw fish, but also saw many options for the more adventurous types. We also had the edamame Rok which made for a nice, flavorful appetizer (although showed up basically as dessert... don't know what happened there). 

One thing I did find amusing is that they have a coed bathroom, and when I was washing my hands this guy came in and freaked out like he had unknowingly walked into the ladies' room.

We go in and sit down at a table (no one told us where to go or to sit) and someone came over and said the tables are closed we can only sit at the bar. After we sat down at the bar, we got the menu and started to browse. Our waiter said they on had the sushi menu open and that we couldn't order anything else. After much back and forth conversations with the manager they finally let us order from the ""hot plate menu"" as well. After we ordered, we over heard one of the chefs saying ""what table ordered the tuna tataki"" in a irritable voice. That's is just horrible fricken customer service. Chefs were standing around on their phone, talking and we were the only ones in there at the time! Our order took at least 30 minutes and let me tell you the portions are NOT worth the price.

The toro sushi was so good and fresh as was the yellow tail and salmon. The spicy tuna roll wasn't nearly as good as the sushi but still decent. You can imagine that the service was spotty with our waitress breaking to jump into a song and dance - but the management felt so bad that we had to wait so long that they took care of a large part of our drinks.

Great for parties, bachelor/bachelorette, team outings etc. Boyfriend and I were here on a Sunday evening around 6:40pm and it was already alive and jamming. Got the emcee startin it off....hypin up the crowds...dancers all around the dining floor, up on the bar tables....definitely entertaining.

We ordered the following items:
-shishito peppers
-baked crab hand rolls (two hand rolls per order) - baked snow crab, spicy aioli, avocado in soy paper.
-tiger roll - shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna, negi, spicy dynamite sauce
-kamikaze roll - shrimp tempura, jalapeno, avocado, tuna, jalapeno vinaigrette, eel sauce, lime juice, micro cilantro

This may not seem a lot of food, but it was enough to fill us up. Plus these rolls can start off at $16.00....it can add up...QUICK. The baked crab hand roll was $20.00 and it only came with TWO PIECES. Yikes. For $20, you would think you get more than that. So don't come here if you're on a budget....or if you're starving or else your bill would be like $70.00 PER PERSON. They can charge this much for sushi because A.) they're located on Las Vegas Blvd and B.) the ambiance + entertainment is different than your usual sushi restaurants. 

It's fun to check out...but you come here for the experience and entertainment. If you want just a good old normal sushi restaurant without the sticker shock, this won't be for you.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,4,4,4,SEqi9lJegcQN-7ImCXDIeQ

The atmosphere is super lively and they made sure to acknowledge my friend's birthday in a special way. Shout out to our waiter DJ and all the additional waiters that came over throughout the night! They all provided excellent service!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for a group ages 20-40. They have a dj that played music all night and every hour or so the wait staff broke out in a dance routine. It was very entertaining and fun! We had a group of 7 people. Throughout the evening we ordered round after round of sake bombs $6 a piece (Don't be fooled by the 8 sake bombs for $80). For appetizers, we started with edamame, dumplings and brussel sprouts. The dumplings were good but the brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS! Each person at the table ordered a specialty roll and then we tacked on several of the hand cut rolls. The hand cut rolls were small and nothing extraordinary. Exactly what you would expect. The specialty rolls were very unique! We ordered almost every one on the menu but my favorites were Spicy Samurai (beware very spicy), Tiger Roll, Puff the Magic Dragon (comes with edible white foam on top). Since we had a birthday girl they brought out their signature Honey Toast! It was delicious! We also had the mochi which I thought the shell was too gummy... nothing special. Overall very entertaining/unique dining experience and the price isn't bad either.

2679612,2017-08-14,0,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"Came to this place because it had high yelp reviews. The food is decent, the food is pricey but the service was VERY disappointing.

My group was a party of 7 and we called in advanced to make reservations for dinner since we were out celebrating. When we arrived, we were greeted and sat immediately. There were 2 other tables with groups of 2-3 people - Not sure if they had an outside area but those were the only people we saw in the entire restaurant including the upstairs.

As we were settling into our table, a gentlemen came over to ask if we were planning to do any of their 80oz sake bombs; we weren't so he removed the kegs from our table and was never seen again. Once he left we sat there for a good 20 minutes before anyone else tried to talk to us. When someone did come to talk to us, it was one of the restaurant's main entertainer who came by to let us know that there was going to be a show that night before wandering off to the other groups inside the restaurant.

A completely different guy finally took notice and apologized that we hadn't been serviced yet. He had assumed that someone else was already taking care of us. Since no one actually was...he went ahead and started getting us water and taking our food order. 

When the food started coming out, the entertainer from earlier was the one bringing our food out. It was very nice of him to do so, but also very odd since it looked like they had 15 other people on staff just standing around and some goofing off with each other (besides the two chefs in front). I assume he (the entertainer) did that because the show he was leading was just about to come on. Once the show began, it looked like the staff didn't want to interrupt him and the performers, so they stood idle with the rest of our orders and began dancing with each other until it was over. 

After our food was delivered, there was literally no interaction with the staff. Through out the evening, no one came back to check on us for refills or see if there was anything else that we needed. The restaurant also never got busier from when we got there. We ended up having to flag someone down ourselves to let them know that one of the girls never received her food. We waited so long that the whole group literally finished all of their food and her one item still never came. Because the staff seemed like they were busy talking amongst themselves and ignoring us, we ended up having to walk over to ask them to cancel the item. 

Then a girl finally came over to give us a refill on water which was the first for us (and after we had finished our food). We asked her for our check since the other guy who took our order was nowhere to be seen. He did bring our check though and when we reviewed our bill, the restaurant added a 22% gratuity! Now we understand that we are a group of 7 but we've eaten at other restaurants on the strip plenty, and the most we've ever seen was 18%. Asked our waiter about it to see if that was their standard and he seemed less friendly this time - basically said yep and walked away. Seems rather silly considering one of the girls never even ate since they failed to bring her food out and the service was just flat out terrible. We weren't going to make a big fuss over it, but I don't think we will come here again because it was not a pleasant experience.",fdKrjrRLUE9fY5bXsIYS7A,2,0,1,s7rJpFixOvJGma_U6yKpjQ

2721596,2016-10-19,1,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"Is there a place to click on 10 stars out of 5??!! This was my first time at Sake Rok and it was quite an experience. That's the perfect word for this is an ""experience"". We went this last Saturday night. It was packed and happening. There were 5 of us, but we were able to be seated within 15 mins.  

There's so much to look at that you can get easily distracted by what's happening at other tables or at the bar. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, the staff was spectacular. And I mean ALL of 4 staff,  not just our waitress. I don't even know where to start with this review because I have so many great things to say. 

We did the ""Sake Flight"" before we ordered, which is basically 5 different types of sake. You start from one end and work your way up to the other end.  My favorite was the last one which tasted like champagne married sake and had a baby. It was great! You need to try this - so much fun!!!

Then we ordered some appetizers - edamame rok, adagashi tofu and the brussel sprouts. All of these dishes were wonderful, but one in particular has my heart. The brussel sprouts are out of this world!!! I know you may frown upon hearing it has fish sauce in it, but let me tell you,  imagine the best brussel sprouts you've ever had,  then amp that up by 10 points - that's how delicious they are! 

We were hesitant to order the huge Godzilla platter because being Asian, we did the math and it didn't add up. Their rolls average $20 each.  In the platter there are 5 rolls and 8 pieces of sashimi for $200. If you order 5 rolls it's closer to $100 & 8 pieces of sashimi can not possibly be another  $100. Anyways we said screw it, let's just order it and see what it's about!!! 

Money aside, we were really pleased with how the platter was presented. It came attached to this gigantic Godzilla that had steam (dry ice?) coming out of its mouth. I think the extra cost is for the experience. If you're all about the experience, get the platter!! The sushi tasted great as well. 

Throughout the night there were performances by the staff. They are REALLY good dancers and performers. They have some moves! There was someone who reminded me of Aerosmith who hosted, went table to table, gave advice on food,  talked to you, made you feel comfortable, made you laugh, took shots with you-all around great person who made the experience even more magical. 

At the end of the meal I went to the restroom and was stunned at all the offerings in there. I was a bit off guard bit in a good way. There was a towel lady there, but they had everything under the sun in there - various types of lotion, perfume, candy, mints, deodorant, etc and maybe my memory decides me, but I swear I saw cigarette packs. 

It is loud in there, but it's fun. It has a great vibe. If you want to go have a meal and smile the whole time, listen to great music, have some great service, and enjoy yourself, this is the place for you!! Next time I'm in Vegas, I look forward to coming back.",a1e1Aq012UPF4FDJyLc3cw,6,5,5,KTTB2A3zaKT7JcKCkIjNuw

It's better than it sounds. There is a host from Canada that is the soul and life of the place. He is so personable and charismatic and fun and really gets the fun rolling. Be sure to engage in the free sake bombs with him. I don't know how he keeps it up all night. The restaurant sang happy birthday to my friend and projected a sign on the wall. Be sure to let them know what you're celebrating and they'll make you feel special. Drinks are strong and delicious. My Kirin frozen head left much to be desired and maybe stick to rolls VS entrées as this is where they truly shine. The rolls are fantastic. Up with the best I've ever had. That honey toast as well.

They play music very loud so it has a nightclub atmosphere; however, there is nowhere to dance. If I can't dance with my date I would at least like to be able to hear them. 

The staff seem friendly but I only saw them for a few seconds. The menus are ridiculously large for no reason and you have to share them so picking food takes twice as long. 

The entertainment included a flamboyant guy and employees dancing to gangnam style for about 2!minutes while wearing shutter shades, the popular style from 2008.

The food was really delicious I just wish I actually had more than a bite. This is the smallest portion in an asian restaurant I've ever had (at least for this price). 

The mixed shrimp and vegetable tempura is about $16 and you get 3 pieces of shrimp, 1 carrot, 1 asparagus, and quarter of an onion deep fried. Thats more of an appetizer than a meal. 

The pork dumplings were also around $16 and you get 5 small sized dumplings that were slightly larger than a quarter. It tastes good but you finished it in about 5 seconds. 

The spicy samurai roll was very delicious but honestly nothing special for such a hefty price once again. Its basically spicy tuna and some eel with avocado inside. Im pretty sure that was close to $20. 

All together the bill was over $50 and im hungrier than when I got here.",Qbm-Oh2uk4_w6wSQl4Docw,0,0,3,t7p_f6fdx4hrHCRMpQj97w

We were quickly seated in the corner of the restaurant with a great view of the dancers and the rest of the customers. I was relieved to be placed away from the dancing employees. They tried to get as many people to dance with them and were super extroverted.

The noise level of this place was similar to going to a night club. If you needed to talk to someone, you pretty much had to speak up really loudly or else the loud noise would drown out your voice. 

The menu was a little hard to read. The disco lights kept changing colors. The area we were sitting at would go dark and then become bright after 5 seconds. I had to wait for the room to get bright before making my food selection. 

I finally selected the Salmon Avocado Roll ($10) and Tempura Roll ($15). Each roll contained 8 pieces. 

The Salmon Avocado Roll had tons of salmon. Some of the salmon pieces I received were 0.5"" x 0.5"" x 0.5"". This place was also not cheap on the avocado pieces. I could actually taste avocado unlike the other sushi restaurants I have been to. The Tempura Roll was great as well! The rice tasted as if it was deep fried. I did not see tempura flakes. It tasted very warm and fresh. The spicy mayo was a little spicier than what I remember.

2851425,2017-03-07,0,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"Sadly disappointed  I had been craving sushi all weekend and we seen this spot while walking the strip and it's new so why not try something new right ? Well wrong, I wanted this meal to be our final meal in Vegas and unfortunately the rolls were baby rolls and not very flavorful. I will be honest we did switch up one of the rolls a bit so maybe the original roll would have tasted better but either way it was beyond small I mean tiny !! The chefs have definitely perfected there craft on cutting the thinnest slices possible of avocado and the smallest crab meat put in the roll was less the than the size of my pinky finger and the rolls aren't cheap so you aren't paying for presentation because they come on a plain white serving tray and you aren't paying for quantity because they are so small so I could only assume your paying for the show that comes with the meal which we didn't get because we missed it by an hour and came too early. So I suggest coming when there is a show so you will at least get some entertainment. And please please please order your drink with no ice !! Because we paid $14 for a cup of ice with a flower and the taste was ok nothing spectacular! And the roll that we did change we still wanted shrimp just not spicy shrimp we mentioned possibly changing it to crap but opted not to and I guess the waiter didn't hear us because he still ordered it with crab and it was $5 more for something we didn't want  I'm not sure if the dj music was to loud and he didn't hear us or wasn't paying attention but either way paying more for something you don't want that didn't have the best of flavor was a true disappointment. The overall atmosphere of the place was nice with a decent amount of seating . It did take a while for the roll and the place wasn't packed at all so I'm not sure if they waited to make the rolls because someone in our party ordered the hanger steak and takes a while to make or they just take a long time to make the rolls because the have to prefect the art of making mini rolls lol either way not happy, make your own judgement and hopefully my tips will help you have a better experience! The hanger steak I was told that was delicious and that's what the stars are for. Maybe my review wouldn't have been so harsh if I seen the value in what we were buying but since there was no show and small amount of food it only lead to disappointment I wouldn't suggest that they offer free edamame or miso soup or for them to lower the prices to pre event meals .",8p5JzIOcVObksnFfHjonWQ,0,0,2,WfSd6QUXc_d_0vHLc1XHNw

But since I had lunch there, I will review honestly. At least 3 members of the waitstaff were too hungover to give a shit and the bartender couldn't figure out how to pour a Sapporo, an IPA, or ANYTHING (but, sweet! I saved a Hamilton). I was charged for the beers and had to have the bill corrected.

The rolls & soup were just fine. It had the 2x price increase that you get on the Las Vegas strip.

Recommendation: Cancel lunch OR offer lunch specials at a reasonable price with a waitstaff that knows how to work at the early hour of 12:30.",7XvUlAuIRF9IhWAvlr5U7Q,0,0,2,HNteVeF8nU1g-QCSlEKgCw

We ordered the volcano roll (which fell apart), tiger roll, and the dos chi-charrones.

Whatever it is, it's edible and doesn't have a flavor. We also had the shrimp and vegetable tempura. I had the Dragonfly cocktail and enjoyed it a lot, but something in it made my lips tingle. The server brought over the alcohols used in the drink, but we were unable to determine what it was that caused the tingling. Also, about every 30 to 45 minutes, the staff puts on a performance/show with the staff dancing and singing and running around the restaurant so be prepared for that.

Nine of us met up here the other night due to the wonderful organizing of Cathey K! Once you enter Sake Rok, you can feel the high energy...an energy created by not only the wall decor and lighting, but more importantly, by the talented staff and specifically, the host. The host on this evening was wearing lots of makeup, with a skimpy Mick Jagger-like wardrobe. And throughout the evening, he was continuously interacting with the audience/patrons, thoroughly engaging, while demonstrating his true gift--singing, dancing,  pleasing, and imploring bottoms-up Sake bombs as fast as anyone in the restaurant...he could make a sake-bomb fan out of a monk if given the chance. Throughout all our dinner, he was entrancing, leaving many of us enamored with the group dances and general uplifting vibe of the floor.  

And about the food:
-Chef selection 40 piece Sashimi Platter
-Amber Jack Nigiri
-Uni Nigiri
-Sashimi Tacos
-Berkshire Pork Dumplings
-Soba Noodles
-Honey Toast Boat...the biggest one you will ever see

All their Nigiri courses came with one piece...I enjoyed the Uni Nigiri very much with its fresh ocean flavor. The dumplings were very flavorful, though rather small. The honey toast came with some great macaroons in a variety of flavors, while the boat itself was so delightful that I literally tore that boat in to pieces...yummy. My love enjoyed the Soba noodles very much, but the noodles were too al dente for my liking.

The service the staff provided us was 3 dimensional...There was the typical service you would get at a restaurant, plus entertainment by not only the super-energized and talented MC, but also by all the wait staff...at some points, even the chefs were dancing to the beat!

I will definitely come back with a group of friends...and you may even catch me up on stage with them dancing along to the party!

When I say everything I'm talking about the performance, the waiters, and food runners coming out of the kitchen, and the tall male manager talking into an ear piece and putting his hand very low on the hostess back who looked like she needed to ask something (awkward) I felt that was inappropriate. I'm not a prude but it made me feel like I saw something I shouldn't have seen. Anyways our server comes over younger thin guy I think named Eric and he begins his spiel he is knowledgable of the menu and gave us superb service! Even though the place was busy he did a great job of recommending food. After he takes our order another server comes up Named DJ and he begins to do a spiel. We let him know Eric already took our order and the face DJ flashed was kind of an annoyance. My only suggestion would be for the team to have more communication going on. Other than that the food was good top choices are the pork belly seaweed salad and any specialty rolls. Food was great performance was fun and service was good.",qEjm0_ivRn8WlfJipeFAgg,0,0,4,GSlYHYgTrAnmBlYLjbMdkg

The hostess who greeted us was friendly, but went downhill after that. So the ambience is very Vegas, there was a host dressed as a rocker geisha entertaining some of the guests which I thought was kinda cool, what turned me off in this place is lack of service and communication. We came in, got seated and were given water. After about 10 minutes, no one came to take our order. To add insult to injury, the host asked us if he can borrow our chair to take a picture with the table of guys next to us. I normally won't mind that, but even after that and seeing that we still have our menus in front of us and having no food on our table, we still did not get any server to take our order!!!

So I came here to celebrate one of my best friends Candy R for her birthday. You ever have those moments where it like not planned where you want to eat and you just spontaneously come up with somewhere to celebrate at the last minute? Yeah.. that's exactly what happened and how we ended up here. This place is a bit hidden as I had to call and ask them exactly where they were located. When I walked across the street I just had to look and see the sign.. silly me. But no they are low key ducked off. Next to California Pizza kitchen I finally found them! 

When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server who ended up actually being somebody who performs in the live shows that they do. Kind of cool right it was funny watching her take our orders and then run to go do all this dancing on the stage. Multi-tasker much? Yes.. That was pretty dope to say the least. The service here was actually pretty damn good because of all the attention you get and the fact that they really do a good job insisting that you have a great time. My best friend let the MC Drag Queen know that it was her birthday and she did a wonderful job making sure that it was actually celebrated. They even went a step above by putting her name on the projector camera in big letters wishing her a Happy Birthday. 

The food and drinks were okay here...actually the only reason I didn't give them 3 stars was because of the service. Balanced out. I wasn't extremely hungry so I went with the wagyu beef sliders. They were okay and my friends ordered a bunch of other items. We all just shared each others plates because well sharing is caring right? RIGHT! The best dish of them all probably had to be the pork chop dish. I'm not huge on pork and only eat it every blue moon. One of our friends is vegan so she had a separate menu to order off of. The tofu dish that she ordered was a bit bland and it was just missing something... The prices here are high but expected because you are on the strip.

Bottom line is if you are up for a place that you can eat and enjoy some interesting entertainment then this is your place. If you love Sake Bombs then you will have a blast here because they do these random times throughout the night where they have people order Sake Bombs and chug them in sync... Follow those Sake bombs by Backstreet Boys and super loud music.. Have fun!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,3,4,xX4meA_8rRnypDd9BWhXVQ

Maybe if you like crab in your rolls you'll like it, but it really wasn't that great. Puff was a little better. I subbed out the crab after tasting it in the other roll and got salmon instead.

The prices are pretty mediocre - I didn't feel as robbed as I would have thought dining on the strip. We ordered the Japanese Wagu Sliders to start. Oh. My. God. I wish I had ordered one on my own so that I didn't have to share. The beef was truly delicate, tender and juicy and the truffle aioli granted me the power to see the face of God.

The sushi on the other hand, I found to be sub-par. To be fair, I lost the ordering game on this one because I tried my friends' rolls and theirs were all better than mine (I don't even remember the name of the roll I ordered) but none of them were very good.

Genasis was performing and that's what we were here for.  Was a good idea to arrive without expectations or I would not have been surprised.

This restaurant gave many WOW factors as to the look, the feel, the performers who were also our servers, the food presentation, the sushi and sashimi FLAVORS, the prices hahahaaa, and DJ for the event.  But it was New Year's; why not spoil myself and Ness.  

Being a holiday occasion, we got their special 5 course menu.  After salad, appetizers, edamame munchies, sushi, sashimi, and the ever so delish main course with Cod - we were feeling it... FULL.  The cod was very nice.  Had a sweetness and a crunch to the top layer.  There was also a mushroom dish with rice that totally tasted like adobo.  Their edamame SO GOOD had seasoning and lime.  We loved their sushi and sashimi, especially the one on a radish slice!

They offered a $50 unlimited well drinks special during the dinner hours.  Wristbands were given.  And this cost made sense, as from the outside bar, one drink is $20.  Bring on the vodka!  

The bonus in dining here is there are daily performances by the servers.  This was the biggest plus besides the amazing food and wall art.  Note that the bill reflects a minimum 20% gratuity.  I'm guessing it's because of the show included in the dining experience - understandable.  While we were here, large group tables did Sake Bombs with the main host performer.  Hilarious guy, very entertaining.  Props out to our server Amanda too!  You go ladybug!  And to the other ladies and gents who filled in clearing out empty dishes and offering the next round of drinks.  Yay points!

The interior of this place is pretty awesome!  Props to the artist(s).  The main dining room was transformed into a dance floor.  Second floor was set up for bottle service sections.  And I learned there's a 3rd floor rooftop.  Definitely designed for fun happenings.  Here's to looking at a bright 2017 with tremendous possibilities ahead!!!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,40,41,5,1ZpEYh3BLpk5tjDjZxaIwA

We had some delicious shrimp rolls and some other tasty stuff, all of which were great tasting.

So my friend and I were eating there before the concert next door and she had a little tiny purse on her, well when west odd up to leave, a 100.00 bill dropped out of her purse, hit the floor and we left (having no idea).

Well it turns out that our waiter (Keoki) thought he recalled seeing the 100.00 drop out of the purse and went over to grab it, well a guest saw it too and the guest took it themselves. Then the GM got involved and they looked at camera tape and did in fact see that my friend  dropped it, so they requested the guest give it back to them, so they did. They then contacted us via text letting her know what happened. BLOWN AWAY!!!!!!!! This kind of honesty is so hard to find nowadays! Hats off to you Sake Rok!!!!!

The food was served buffet style and was remarkably unimaginative and not memorable at all. The elections included bland greens, salmon, steak, and chicken. All reminded me of a typical already prepared meal from a food store. The appetizers in the beginning were solid with veggie spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, and some sushi. I'm guessing these items were off the main menu as they were much better while the buffet dinner was not. The bartenders were good and always attentive to refills which was nice and he sake on draft was very good considering. The venue itself is nice with a large balcony complete with heat lamps and tables. The venue itself is very nice, but the meal was a let down.

The MC for the day was especially funny and simply exuded everything I imagined was Vegas. The dance numbers the staff performed were fun. We joined them in dancing and of course did a sake bomb with the MC! I ordered two rolls, and one was absolutely delicious while the other had a bad taste and it was clear the fish was not fresh. I eventually had to tell the waiter and return the food. The staff did everything to make it up to me, comping the bad roll and even serving us dessert on the house. I truly appreciate their efforts to make it up to me, but unfortunately I was sick with diarrhea for the next few days afterwards.

We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor.

I almost tried a Bunny bomb! Bacardi dragonberry rum & sparkling white peach sake, one of these days ... 

Benjamin was our fun waiter and engaged in friendly convo with my friend (bday girl) and me. He said he had half a mind to bring us those sake bombs.

I'd definitely have to order another for a full lunch. Round crispies on the outside gave a satisfying crunch. 

Interior looks cool and loft-like with two levels, and I heard a private function room on a third floor?

I have never been someplace where I have had so many personal conversations with employees.  The bartender Frank was so genuinely personable and attentive, and made amazing food & drink recommendations.  He was super accommodating to make sure nothing I ordered contained anything I am allergic to (wasabi, in a sushi restaurant, how annoying am I?) 

The Whiskey on the ROK cocktail spoke to my whiskey loving soul. Frank even educated me about the cherry on the garnish.

To start, I went with his recommendation of the crispy rice. It was an incredible flavor and texture combo, with just enough spice.  I will never NOT get this dish when I go there.

I went again with recommendations and next got the tiger roll and the Brussels sprouts. The tiger roll was awesome, but how often does a vegetable impress you?  The sprouts were the perfect texture.

The hospitality in this place was crazy on point.  I had conversations with the Chef (Joe, great food!!!) and manager, Craig.  Since I went for lunch, I missed the entertainment that happens nightly.  When asked about what goes on, Craig took the time to take me on a tour of the restaurant, and explain to me the different aspects of the entertainment.  He even pointed out interesting facts of the place (local artist for the murals on the walls, which is a nice touch!) 

Overall, obviously very impressed with this place, and will be back with friends, so we can catch the entertainment, and try more amazing food!",Yez7wH8iXYWq9Pi7hV9zDA,5,4,5,fBgJ6PIi-1S1KjPy0gSxAg

The food was great! We ordered the shrimp ceviche and brussel sprouts as appetizers and we're not disappointed. The ceviche was good but with only (4) pieces and a party of 3, we had to fight to see who would get the last piece haha. The brussel sprouts were AMAZING and that's coming from someone who swears against eating them. It tasted like they were dipped in eel sauce and covered with Panko bread crumbs. Seriously. try them out you won't regret it. For entrees we ordered the volcano roll (5 pieces), rok & roll (5 pieces), and tiger roll (8 pieces). They were all good (I've had better) although, I favored the volcano roll the best. We also had a side of Japanese style elote and that was decent as well but definitely not as good as traditional Mexican elote. Nothing too amazing. 

Service was alright considering the place was nowhere near being packed for lunch time. 

It was a good lunch but can get pretty pricey for just lunch so keep that in mind. (2) appetizers, (3) rolls, (1) side, and tap water for 3 people.

I made reservations for 7PM but was running 15 minutes late but when we got there they were able to accommodate us and seat us quickly. Which I really appreciate cause I was getting kind of hangry (so hungry + I was getting angry) ... hehehe. 

The energy in the room was contagious! Being in the hot sun, dancing and drinking all day  can take a lot out of you, but the food and vibe there brought us back to life! I could see my friends faces light up as we were entertained by the music from the live DJ and then the show! 

I'm big on ambiance, art, architecture and decor and the place is beautifully designed! Every inch of that place looked like it was hand picked with incredible detail. To the signs, to the beautiful art on the brick walls which I was told was painted by a local graffiti artist. Even down to the napkins folded into shirts! OMG the white leather (hopefully pleather ) crocodile design  looking  seats are very cool looking and comfortable too! 

Timing was impeccable, the food came out fast and was delicious! You could taste the quality in each item! The salt and pepper shrimp was my favorite item on the menu, it makes me salivate just thinking about it, simple but oh so good! I love rolls and we got the El Chapo and The girl on the beach did not disappoint! We also got the ceviche, which was way better than I expected because I always think ceviche is hit or miss but it was really good, and came with these yummy chips. The Mochi was really good, I suspect Bubbies (from Hawaii my favorite!) Mochi which are the best around, unless they made them in house the chocolate, had crunchy chocolate chips inside. I consider myself a bit of a Mochi conoisoire.  
We didn't get the Godzilla platter but I saw several tables getting it and it looked really cool! The presentation was dope, did my eyes deceive me or was there smoke coming out of the Godzilla as it was served to the table?

Service was on point too! My water was always filled, which was great because well partying in the Vegas desert can dehydrate you. Empty dishes were promptly taken away. Our server Vince was excellent, and we were able to get out of their quickly because we had a flight to catch!

Tip #2: Fish quality isn't great, so don't come here for the sushi.

This was a tough review, because Sake Rok does have two big positives:
1) Servers were attentive and really friendly;
2) Alcohol! Liquor selection is excellent, cocktail list is extensive with fun/quality options, and top shelf sake is available (although, as I mention above, off the menu).

The problem is that the food quality wasn't impressive. The fish quality was not good so I would avoid any sushi items here, and the non-sushi dishes were hit or miss. I really liked the tomahawk steak, the mushroom tobanyaki, the seared scallops, and the wagyu sliders. But OTOH I didn't like either the tuna or beef tataki, the shishito peppers were super oversalted, and the ""rok"" shrimp tempura and the shrimp/vegetable tempura weren't breaded that well (and both very small portion size). Also, I've been here twice but they were out of the honey toast dessert on both occasions. Bummer.

But I could see this spot possibly working out if you're mainly coming to have drinks and enjoy the atmosphere (music plays loudly here, and waitstaff will periodically perform in choreographed dance shows), and plan to have food as a side / secondary priority (or you have to stick with very specific items that you know are good). If food is at all the #1 priority, I think you'll be disappointed. And again, I'd avoid the sushi no matter what.

Given all the above, I think 1.5-2* for food, +1* for service and strong alcohol selection is fair.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,3,2,3,2H2IcHoMY3wWr2wOcNjt6g

Then the show started, dancing, singing, everyone clapping along, it was terrific and he in particular was awesome. I had no idea what to expect, but when the entire wait staff lined up with sunglasses on and all did the dance to Will Smith's Men in Black song with the video on the giant screen in the background, I lost it! I couldn't help but smile and laugh and sing along. What a great visit and I sure as hell won't wait another two years to go back. Kudos to the staff, you made our night.",4r85XVB6Il0OEf3yzQO0BQ,0,0,5,wDXtOz9hay7Dmsir14w3tw

We got seated immediately.  There menu was pretty impressive.  They have this Godzilla thing I forgot the name of it but it was pretty cool.  Too bad I wasn't that hungry.  I opted for the 12 piece sashimi, chef's choice.  

Its not the best sushi I've ever had but its definitely pretty good still.  The fish was fresh but not extremely fresh.  I think with the heat of the summer its kinda hard for that to be possible but it was still as fresh as can be.  It didn't have any smelly fish scent so that's always good.  The taste was on point.  I finished my plate in no time and was left pretty satisfied.  My friend was also left pretty satisfied.  The wasabi had a huge kick to it though.  We made the mistake of using too much lol.

The décor is very modern and nice.  The open so you don't really feel cramped.  The tables are a bit small but they worked fine.  The service was on point.  Everyone had their A game on that day.  That's what catapulted this review up an extra star in my books.  Excellent service and the chefs were all really cool and awesome too.  My only regret was that I didn't sit at the sushi bar.  Next time....next time.

Overall I really like this place.  Its a nice joint to grab some Japanese food and some delicious sushi when in Vegas.  Located near the Shake Shack and New York New York its a nice spot to come hang and enjoy some quality food.",lfX4Ay6lYeWQ2kSdAxJaDg,12,9,4,2_MesafCcYw2oq64UyZwEQ

I ordered the pork belly and girl on the beach roll. I sat at the bar area while I waited for my food. The bartender was very nice and friendly. The interior looked great. Japanese theme. Love the art wall. 

There was a staff member in a fun looking, drag costume. He's an MC for the restaurant. He came up to me and said hi. I saw him went up to a table and chatted with the customers at that table. All of sudden, he spoke into a microphone about fashion and then, music came on. The staff and the MC were dancing and singing to Psy Gangnam Style song. They ran up to the stage and ended their song. The music got cut off and everything went back to normal. Wow. I thought that was fun and funny. It made me smile. My wait for food was definitely entertaining and time went by. 

Got my order and went back to my hotel room. Yuummm, the braised pork belly was off the hook. The fats melts in your mouth. It's so good. Recommend it. The sushi roll was small, but it did fill me up. 

It was so good that I came back for the 2nd time during my stay and got the pork belly to go. I arrived near to closing time. I got my food and went back to my hotel room. This time, the pork belly was old and dry. It wasn't moist like my first time. I'm thinking they were out of pork belly and gave me the last scrap of what they had left. There were no fats at all. Just dry, lean meat. I was a bit disappointed. Lesson learned, do not come at closing time. 

I still give it 4 stars due to my first experience. I would definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas.",1Oa4dj8Bcmtf5178NO7U8Q,5,4,4,3XG--7EwVndZg9OwmPmu4g

My husband and I ordered the rok and roll (?), the el chapo roll with some sort of tomatillo sauce and a sashimi platter. The rok and roll is about 5 pieces of sushi on skewers that resemble lollipops. The fish was more like a cheap chopped up filling and had a texture similar to canned tuna. There was very little flavor. The el chapo roll was tiny and again had very little flavor. The sashimi was the best dish we ordered but still tasted a bit dry, almost as if it wasn't fresh. We love sushi and never have a problem finishing what we order (which is usually more than 2 rolls and a few pieces of sashimi), but we didn't even finish the food here. Our meal came out to $200 so it was definitely a huge disappointment (especially when we were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary).

And did I say ambience ?? Its unlike one I've seen at any other restaurant. The host was running around the restaurant singing and playing drinking games with the diners. It totally set the mood to one that matches the aura of Las Vegas. Get drunk..get high...party 

We had couple of sushi rolls...the tiger roll and Vulcan roll. Both were really good..especially the Vulcan.
Then game the shots and those were fun too.

In between the entire server group as well as the host started to dance and totally rocked with the music. Have to say that was really fun to see and quite a surprise to us.

At first glance, I was confused because I thought we were walking into a nightclub. The music is loud but good and everyone is dressed to the nines. We were starving so willing to stay and see what happens.

We were promptly seated but not given menus. At first we weren't sure if it was a mistake but then I quickly noticed that the hostess wasn't giving anyone menus. After a couple of minutes, our waitress showed up with them and offered to answer any questions we had. 

I ordered the Lily Pad, which was one of the most refreshing drinks I've ever had, so I ordered 2 of them. The drinks are pricey but worth every sip.

For my entree, I ordered the Tiger Roll. It had a subtle, crab/cucumber taste and then the heat from the spicy seasoning hit me. It was exactly what I wanted. 

While we were eating and talking, the wait staff started singing and dancing, which was a great surprise!! They were dancing on a stage, on the bar, near the tables...they were everywhere. There was an awesome geisha who looked and sounded like Lady Gaga and she brought the house down. Seriously, she was awesome. 

About 30 minutes later, they did another number. This time, our waitress was being carried in midair while doing a split. She was badass.

Sake Rok rocks!!! The only recommendation I have is giving the customers the menus once they're seated. Not doing so causes confusion and awkwardness.",T0rKLwua6zQR3m-d09yoPA,8,4,5,xzs0Ycp4HKScZLegtjWqow

My previous visit was for quick drinks and appetizers before catching a concert and I had a blast.  I was excited for a sit down dinner experience at the high energy Sake Rok!

Service:  4/5 The hostess, our lead server and all the other servers helping out and bringing our food and keeping the drinks filled were awesome.  Everyone was very friendly and engaging and the emcee leading the sake bombs stopped by to say hi to my teenage niece and her grandmother.   Other than having to wait 30 minutes for our restaurant week mochi dessert, and 20 more minutes for the honey toast we ordered, the service was top notch.  A huge party of 60+ came in right before dessert  I found out they were Cisco employees who were coming in before going to the T-Mobile arena for their Cisco live concert. I understand service might slow down, but I'm pretty sure they knew this group was coming in and it didn't appear they were completely prepared.  This doesn't take away from the awesome staff.

Restaurant week $50 Dinner Course: 4/5
Edamame:  Fresh edmame and very tasty with the Sea Salt and Lime
Hanger Steak:  The highlight of the dinner, delicious and prepped perfectly for me at medium rare.  The Mushrooms and the Aka Miso sauce were fantastic.  Coming back for this.
Sushi: Chef chose your 4 piece Nigiri and I selected the 1/2 Kamikaze roll.  No issues considering this is a high volume fusion restaurant with sushi.
Mochi:  You get 3 assorted flavor mochi which was perfect.  Madre went with the Sata Andagi/Japanese doughnuts which were tasty.
Off the restaurant menu we ordered the squid nigiri which was fine and the Honey Toast which was excellent.  They didn't skimp on the Ice Cream and Berries well done.

Ambiance: 5/5  I love the Ultra modern Neo Japanese deco. I love that there's an emcee leading the sake bomb charge and that the servers do dance shows throughout the night. The ""Godzilla Platter"" presentation is a spectacle that's fun. The Emcee and DJ keeps the energy up vibe lively.

Value: 3.5/5 The restaurant week menu gave pretty good value in my opinion.  It's a little cheaper than what we would have paid off the menu but the in house entertainment is where the real value kicks in.

Sake Rok is a great place to grab a quick bite and drinks before seeing a concert at T-Mobile of partying on the strip.  It's loud, fun and the in house entertainment (and booze) will get you ready for a night out.  There are lots of great opportunities for Social Media pics and videos to keep your followers entertained.  I will be back for the sake rok craziness.

We were seated in the 2nd level, which allowed us to see the show. This is a lively, interactive dining experience. I was kinda prepared for it, since there is a disclaimer/warning on the restaurant's website. There was a emcee, dressed up in rocker Japanese garb, who did sake bombs with a table whenever they were ordered. My favorite part of the act was the Nsync vs. Backstreet Boys medley they performed. All the wait staff do the dances along with the emcee. It was fantastic.

I wish I could say the same for the food. If you are a sushi fanatic, this is not the place for you. It was underwhelming. For the appetizers, we ordered pork gyoza, edamame, and shrimp/vegetable tempura. My one friend ordered miso soup. These were all pretty basic. They forgot our edamame. One friend ordered shrimp tempura roll, the other ordered more temura, requesting all sweet potato, which they accommodated. She also ordered a cocktail, assisted by our server's recommendation, claiming her choice was great, since she likes fruity drinks. My friend said that was not the case when she tasted it. She wished it was more sweet. For my main course, I ordered sake (salmon sashimi). It was highway robbery (in my opinion) to pay $5/piece. I got 2. It tasted the way it's supposed to. I was probably more excited to eat it since it was my first sushi since I had surgery 4 months ago. 

I supposed, since we were on the Strip, that is the reason for the exorbitant prices. We decided to split the check in 3-ways, which amounted to $30/pp, including tip. Ridunkulous if you ask me. As my friend pointed out, it was more out of convenience that we chose this restaurant, as it was a stone's throw away from T-Mobile Arena. 

Personally, I would not go to this establishment again. I will find another place to eat in The Park before my next concert.",1N4z5Okxbl9Bz6Min-ZYTQ,0,0,2,aD5ZEygrlaA6rxTIaVmELA

We arrived ten minutes before our reservation. Even though most of the tables were empty, we were told to wait until our time. My friend and I went to the bar and got some drinks, and expected the hostess to come get us when our table was ready. A minute after our reservation time, we walked back to the hostess and she asked us ""How can I help you?"" It seemed like she had already forgotten our faces in such a short time?

We were taken to our table on the second floor where a waitress was setting our table. She introduced herself as our waitress, and we sat down. We weren't given menus, and waited about ten minutes before we asked a random waiter passing by for a menu. He brought one to us, and we proceeded to wait even longer. I'm not sure how long we waited, but our waitress had not passed by again. We had to ask a random waiter if we would be able to order. 

A waiter came by and apologized that there had been a mix up in the tables, and he took our order. (Confusing because our previous waitress had already introduced herself?). We ordered, and about five minutes later our original waitress came by apologizing, saying that she put in our order. Cool!

After waiting quite a while, eventually one sushi roll came out. My friend and I began to eat, when the waiter came by and apologized that our other sushi roll was taking a while. He offered free sake bombs to compensate for our trouble. Cool!

I started with a Sake Sangria that had a nice flavor and wasn't too sweet. The drink packed some punch and left me happy. For starters we shared Crispy Rice and Edamame (add garlic butter). The Crispy Rice was delicious and had the heat I craved. This was unexpectedly small compared to portions most restaurants serve for this starter. The Edamame was great and had a little kick to it. 

Our main rolls were the El Chapo roll and Shrimp Tempura roll. Both were delicious, but small portions so I'd definitely order more next time. We wrapped up with Honey Toast which was very good. The server cut this open for us which made it easy to eat.

Also, take note that even though you have items that are ""comped/adjusted"" you will still have to pay the 22% gratuity.  I really hate to do this because I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and have also been a manager, but the 1 star is for how the servers and management dealt with my bachelorette party of 23 people (only 20 people were able to consume alcohol).  I had an issue with my bill and it only got ""somewhat"" fixed after a month of emailing and calling the restaurant.  Here's the story...as soon as we got seated a server told us that we'd be getting a round of sake bombs for free,  I thought, wow that's awesome.  About halfway into dinner my friend said that he was gonna order another round of sake bombs.  I told him to make sure to only order 20 sake bombs because we have people in our party that don't drink alcohol or are pregnant (note: we didn't get carded by our servers which I think is a big no no since we had some guests who had just turned 21 and our servers would have realized that they were handing out supposedly ""comped sake bombs"" to pregnant women). When it was time to pay our bill, I asked our server if she could split it up with food on 1 bill, and alcohol divided by the 3 tables (total = 4 checks).  She kept on telling me that she can't do that because the max number or checks she could do is 4.  I was confused because I was just asking for 4 checks but let it go because we wanted to leave the restaurant already.  I paid the food bill and my other friend paid the alcohol bill.  After we had left the restaurant we were trying to figure out who owed what for the alcohol and realized that Sake Rok had charged us for two rounds of 25 sake bombs (50 sake bombs) even though we had only ordered 20 sake bombs.  And our server did not ""comp"" our first round.  After about a month of emailing management (and not getting a response half the time) I came to the conclusion that our server thought we had ordered a ""set"" menu which includes a free round of sake bombs.  Sake Rok ended up comping the sake bombs in the end but I, the bachelorette, got left with paying the 22% gratuity for the ""comped"" sake bombs (~$66) when we only had a party of 20/23 people that could drink and dealing with all the stress of contacting the restaurant when this wouldn't have happened if our server hadn't made the mistake of, first, not carding us and realizing only 20/23 guests would consume a ""comped sake bomb"" then probably realizing that we didn't order a set menu and had us pay for the bill anyway.  Management offered to reimburse me for the $66 gratuity for the ""comped"" sake bombs but told me it would take awhile because they would have to ask for the money back from the servers, which I think the restaurant should have reimbursed me the $66 without any hesitation.  Sake Rok really needs to make sure they ID all their guests, know how many people are in each party AND if all the guests want/can drink alcohol.  Most importantly make sure that when they offer ""comped"" drinks, that they ""comp"" it.",Hv17RAvmFpD9wo76AHeIAg,0,0,1,abWvfUMlmTfWinci818VvA

Our group also ordered the Godzilla platter which I believe was chefs choice. The selection here was okay and for $200 didn't seem worth it. You'd be better off with order individual rolls instead.

The sushi seemed reasonably priced, until I was informed that the price for was one piece of sushi not two, which seems to be the industry standard. But I figured this is Las Vegas, industry standards do not apply.

So I ordered the least expensive roll on the menu, and five pieces of sushi. Let me say this, the food was good but the portions were really tiny. I thought I was in one of those high-end New York restaurants where they give you food that is about two clicks above microscopic. 

That being said, the flavors were there, the presentation was top-notch, and the service was impeccable. I still have a hard time swallowing $5 a piece for sushi nigiri unless King Neptune himself brought it up, cleaned it and served it to me. Then I could have justified the cost. Sadly, Neptune was nowhere to be found, so I just have to chalk this one up to experience.

When the bill came after adding in tip, I walked out of there a little over $70 lighter, and I was still hungry. I have to figure that being next to an arena, restaurants can command a higher price. But there's a difference between a higher price, and boutique charging. I guess if you're trying to weed out a certain clientele, the price justifies the means.

Just to clarify one last time, the food was really good the service was impeccable and the place definitely had a great atmosphere. But damn, $5 minimum per piece of sushi nigiri seems way out of line to me.  I just can't in good faith give this place four or five stars.

The bottom line? If you are absolutely dying for some sushi, and you have nowhere else to go, this may be the only game in town around the T-Mobile Arena.",-d0o3YCu6Zu6hHpzNq4dUQ,4,3,3,M4cL_LZQjuXdzkqvIK6amw

The decor and lay out is attractive, but the flavors of the food was lacking. There were only probably 5 other customers while we were there and it still took about 20 minutes to receive our food after we had ordered.

Rok Ceviche - Average. Just small fresh cuts of sashimi plated fancy. Add some shoyu and plate it differently and you can call it a mixed poke appetizer.

Rok & Roll - Presentation was really nice, but the roll tasted bland. The yuzu soy foam was a nice touch, but I wish it was ontop of the roll rather than in the middle of the dish.

Spicy Samurai - Not spicy. Looks prettier than it tastes because of the chili threads. Same bland taste as the rok & roll. 

Add two beers with this order and $100 later, we were on our way. I'm sure the night time vibe is completely different",5aFBj0emFzoXsUcKbDQZiA,1,0,2,c7dURW0dbUQf_T85cn6Y1g

You can choose from two appetizers, entrees, dessert etc for $55, $70 depending on whatever deal you chose. We picked the $55 deal which came with more than enough delicious and well prepared food for the 3 of us, however, unbeknownst to us was that the deal was per person instead of collectively as a group which was not listed.

From the minute you walk in, you feel like you've wandered into a post apocalyptic cirque du soleil set. Greeted by adorable hostesses, and met at your table by someone that's a cross between Chris Angel and someone from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, dinner at Sake Rock is an adventure, and NOT for the entitled shallow-hearted. 

Ginormous cartoon-sized menus, boy band sing-a-longs, interactive diner participation complete with spankings (yes I was spanked....... and it was SOOOOOO delicious!), dancing waitresses (and they were GOOD dancers..... like holy-shit good!), wonderful singers...... ah the fun!

If you're uptight, boring, and have the personality of a bumper sticker, do yourself a favor, DON'T come! Stay home! Go find an all-you-can-eat buffet and smirk under your right-wing Stetson. Stay far away! They don't want you here!

Now.... the food is interesting. Some of the traditional sashimi is average to pretty good. They deliver. Then you move up the creative chain and sample the mixed rolls.... and if you have enough people, get the Godzilla platter, which comes out like champagne bottle service at Hyde or Hakassan nightclubs. This is Vegas-level sushi table service, complete with smoke-spewing Godzilla statue.

If you're a scallop lover, omg they have an amazing cooked scallop dish that led some of the people in my party to fight. 

If you're a meat eater, you MUST try their Flintstones-sized bone-in ribeye that is good for 5-6 people. Holy cow..... pun intended.... amazeballs. 

They have a full bar, and their array of cocktails will do any mixologist proud. I actually let my waiter decide for energize on the table simply based on 2-3 question about what we like or dislike. Winning!

So come here if you're looking for dinner fun. I'm rating the entire experience and ""smile"" factor. It is so much fun!!",qW2e3x21BMWlOr72WUoFug,8,3,5,TEm0CU9rg3Jq9QZ_RZ4VaQ

Our food was really good, but a few things we wished would have been listed on the menu, neither were a huge deal. For the king crab cali roll, it was not listed that the crab was actually a crab salad. We were expecting just a piece of crab inside, not a mayo based mixture. We both hate mayo. Also the brussel sprouts were coated in some type of breading. Not tempura. Either way, they weren't listed as breaded on the menu. We would've skipped both of these items had it been described as such. The sake was good also and they had a dj who was really good. Problem is, it was like 5pm and the music was so loud it was comical. I get it, it's saturday, it's vegas. But it's 5pm. Also there was only one other table besides us.

We walk in and apparently they close after lunch and reopen for dinner at a certain time, which is not posted anywhere on their menu or on this app. They only offer parts of the menu during this inbetween lunch and dinner period. My gf and I decided to sit down and try it anyway even though we wouldn't be able to order from the full menu. We were hungry and in the mood for sushi. 

Garlic edamame - oily and bland; didn't think edamame was a hard dish to execute, but I guess it can be for some $7 

1 piece of tako nigiri - 1 piece for $5. Nothing special. Tasted like typical tako nigiri. Again.. 1 frickn piece. 

Salt and pepper shrimp - this dish was tasty; shrimp was cooked nicely and had a nice crisp to it - $14

Tuna tataki - delicious; most places never go wrong with this dish; made with ponzu sauce $15

Westside Roll - this roll had different ingredients, but was tasty as well; surprising ingredients included Asian pear and a peanut curry sauce $18 for 6 pieces.... Seriously 6 pieces 

The food overall was for the most part tasty, but honestly the prices are not worth the portions. I realize this restaurant is on the strip, but really for a more reasonable price you can get tasty sushi many other places in Vegas. The ambiance was unique and the restaurant has a cool vibe. 

Also, being that we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time, service was pretty slow. I also realize this restaurant just opened and perhaps the are still getting things situated and organized, but management who have their shit together usually translate into staff having their shit together. 

Being from Hawaii I've eaten a lot of sushi and although most of the dishes were tasty, the prices were a bit steep in my opinion. Again, quality sushi can be found for much more reasonable prices in many other locations in Vegas... Like Sakana for example.

I agree with another reviewer over the snooty hostesses but the one that seated us was nice enough. The place was over-staffed for it being so slow (probably ahead of a potential rush) but it appeared as though a lot of the staff were watching and talking about the diners. Even if they weren't, that's how it felt. Our server was nice and the kitchen was very accommodating to my allergy and double-checked that similar ingredients were alright for me. I greatly appreciated this attention to detail and the chefs even relayed some questions as well to make sure they prepared something I could eat. Our beverages were refilled often and our food took an appropriate amount of time to prepare. The coconut rice came out first and it was absolutely delicious. We'd hesitated in ordering a starter but I am so glad we ordered it. I'm still thinking about it! Our sushi rolls (Avocado, Tiger and I'm Filled With Cream) were all fresh and tasty. The ingredients were all evenly balanced within each roll. We weren't there during any of the live performances or aware they had them but did see one of the male performers in makeup on our way out.

5185729,2017-07-28,0,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"When a bunch of us girls from NJ headed to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party, we were looking for something unique, fun, and different to add to our schedule of events. Sake Rok, in itself, delivers the fun-in-Vegas special experience, even despite the hiccups here and there.

I'll start with the good. The atmosphere of this place is fantastic. It's got an edgey, J-pop/punk vibe that screams at you from the street - literally! More about this in a below, but basically, whatever is going on inside is broadcasted outside, on the pavilion, of  the restaurant. 

Keep in mind, Sake Rok is not a peaceful dining experience. It's an interactive, energy-fueled improv and music show that involves every person in the room, so don't come here expecting anything less. Our host for the evening (Carlos) was HYSTERICAL and downright delightful. His fashion sense slayed, his dancing was on-point, and his jokes had us all in stitches. And the best part? He gets to DRINK SAKE BOMBS WITH YOU. He leads you into the battle of staying sober and looks fabulous while doing so. Overall, Carlos gets all the gold stars. 

Even the service was pretty wonderful, despite the multiple waiters and waitresses weighing on you. Usually, I hate it when restaurants have the many-waiters thing, but everyone had their act together, and was super pleasant and funny.

Buuuuuuut I will say this. I daresay people come to Sake Rok just for the show, because in my opinion, the food (at least from our one experience) will definitely not be getting me in the door again. It's not that the actual food tasted bad (the little we had was delicious), it's just the fine details of our overall eating experience that missed the mark.

First of all, this place is overpriced, YET I can get over that. You're in a touristy section of Vegas, and the dining comes with entertainment, so what do you expect? I can totally forgive the high price tag that comes with the meal. (Again, thank you Carlos.)

The menu items were, at the time that we went, extremely limited, but it seems that the menu has changed in the few months since I been there. (I actually went to look at the website so that I could glance menu to remind myself of the options, and was surprised at the plentiful and different items available. For example, the slider small plates that a party member ordered came with foie gras - a weird and completely unnecessary topping, even for a fancy Japanese place. It appears that they have taken it off the menu.) Basically, our options were sushi rolls (personally, not a fan), a weird combination of carb-and-fish based small plates (also not a fan), and expensive entree options. Let's get real here. The place wants to be bougie and offer unique dining options, I get that, but you HAVE GOT to appeal to the masses somehow, even if it's ONE kitschy 'plain' dish. Things like oysters, tuna tartare, and grilled octopus are all great 'different' options, but are way too specific to appeal multiple palettes. And I wasn't about to shell out 40 bucks for a hangar steak. But, having said this, the menu has clearly changed since I've been there, so don't base your opinion solely on this.

STILL! I can forgive all that, just for the entertainment factor and vibe of this place. The real gamechanger is this. The real issue is that the portions were so pathetically small that we all ended up getting trashed because there was very little food in our stomachs. For a restaurant that literally encourages you to drink Sake Bombs, something's gotta give. There's needs to be more drinker-friendly options (not just sushi rolls and dumplings the size of quarters) and more 'available' options, too. One does not drink with sushi alone. Basically, the miniscule portions and limited options combined with the high price made our experience so-so. 

If I ever return to this Vegas, I will give it another chance based on the new menu that I see on the website and entertainment factor. The decor and atmosphere of this place alone is amazing! Don't get me wrong - everyone in our party had a blast, but the food situation just brought the experience down. You can't have these crazy drink options and not have food to go along with it, it just doesn't cut it.",kyxmHjD1XEsjAygaAuz-Vg,3,1,4,788lbra_7ckN8jc2E2_42g

My husband let the bartender know it was my birthday, the bartender said he would let our server know about my birthday. Thats cool, although my husband already told them about my birthday when he made our reservation. When we got to our table we waited a good 5-10 minutes for the waitress. She said the hostess didn't let her know that we had sat down which is why it took her so long to take our order.   We ordered our food and ate it once it arrived. The food was good (but I think this place should be $$$ instead of just $$ because it was definitely on the pricier side). Meanwhile the DJ was going around to tables giving birthdays shots.

As a local in the industry and walking by the restaurant numerous times I was really excited to try this place. When we arrived the sad looking hostess (the young rude short blond hair) asked us if we had a reservation and we told her we didn't. Mind you no one was waiting and no one walked in while we were waiting for 10 minutes for a table to be put together which is totally fine because we had a table of 8. As we were patiently waiting, the hostess was giving us really mean looks that made us uncomfortable. She also turned to my best friend and told her she couldn't bring in a water bottle in the restaurant for her 3 year old child. The hostess then told us that, ""they started the music and people started dancing so it will be another 5-10 minutes to seat us."" Just from the first impression we were not excited anymore and immediately left. We walked to Tom's Urban where we were seated immediately and spent over $500 on last nights dinner not including the generous tip we gave our awesome waiter! Sake Rok could have been a great experience if our hostess was more welcoming but maybe she should be in the back washing dishes if she can't seem to put a smile on her face and turn on her customer service skills. It's too bad really because our first impression made us immediately not interested in trying what could have been really great sushi in Vegas.

-s&p shrimp which was AMAZING!

At this time, a busser came over and dropped off waters, and my friend ordered a round of saki bombs for the table.

The waiter then came back and asked if we'd like anything to drink, my friend stated that she ordered it from the busser. He again, just walked away, and started talking about my friends and I to another server.

You get to enjoy a interacting experience in which there is a DJ, the staff dances and performs.  I am going to embrace my millennia status and note that the place was LIT!!!  This is definitely the perfect place to come and have a great dinner prior to going out, or just make it your place to have fun the entire night.  Food wise ""El Chapo"" is a must and their delicious Tacos are the bomb.com  If you are in the city, this a must.  Other perks, are the location (right across the street from the T-Mobile Arena) and other cool bars to partake prior or before your time there.

He said 8 and assured me that they're a really good size. It came out with 5 TINY pieces for each roll. It tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and the rice was hard and stale. I asked him if it was a half order and showed him a pic of other volcano rolls on Yelp. He looked at my sushi and said ""uhhh yeah that doesn't look like a volcano roll at all"" so he talked to the sushi chef. I guess the chef told him it was in fact the volcano roll which I found so odd. It was inedible and I had to ask it be taken off my bill.

It's an interesting concept- dance club and sushi. There's a DJ who plays mostly 80's music (which I like), but the ambience was extremely loud and noisy. Perfect to go with someone you don't want to talk to. 
The service- we had two servers. One was new and training. I had to ask for sake at least 5 times throughout the meal. They just kept forgetting each time I asked. When I made the reservation, the woman asked if there was any special occasion. I told her that we had just gotten married and were on our honeymoon.  When we arrived, she congratulated us, asked for and wrote down my wife's name. Throughout the evening the DJ (dressed as Sho-nuf from The Last Dragon, if you're old enough to remember that one) was giving shout-outs to all the young ladies celebrating weddings and birthdays. He never acknowledged my wife. I don't know, maybe it was because we are in our fifties. 
The price- $200 for four people. I can't complain about that especially for Vegas. 
Summary- I think this place would be best for the younger crowd that enjoys loud music.  Actually, a table of twenty-somethings left after perusing the menu and without ordering. The food is par, nothing special. The DJ was friendly, affable and congenial. But we would have enjoyed the meal more without that concept.",Fp59Wq_NoJ2HS62EQrRF0A,2,0,1,85arPpW49y7rDhO0xEamXA

First of all, what the fuck is up with the menus?  They only supply one menu to the table and it is about 3' by 1.5' in size.  Ridiculous and inconvenient!  I had to lean this silly billboard on the side of my chair while trying to make sure it didn't fall to the ground the whole time.  Ever wonder why almost every other restaurant in the world gives individual menus to every patron?  Because, holy shit, (gasp) it works!!  Menu PDF on the phone, please.   

Food clearly takes a backseat to alcohol and drink prices are respectable for the Strip.  $12 cocktails, $45 fish bowls (good for 4-6 people) and more than enough sake bomb chants to have you still hearing them the next morning ensure everyone can get as drunk as they want.  I wanted to get smashed as soon as I was seated.    

This spot would be best suited for bachelorette parties.  The most entertaining performance by the staff was an NSync vs Backstreet Boys dance mash up that had me cracking up as soon as the puppet strings dropped down from the second floor.  Just because this isn't my scene doesn't mean I can't appreciate what they're at least shooting for :)  

I'd probably go with one of the food packages at the bottom of the menu if I were to return since they're better value, but if a decent Japanese-ish dinner is what you're after, consider at least five other spots on Las Vegas Blvd.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,129,105,2,weq-bU-_5pwp2RgIbG_sTw

A great place for a birthday party, bachelorette or bachelor party dinner, or even unique date night. I went for a girl's night out and it was a fabulous time! 

We started out with their drink menu. The cocktails are to die for! My favorites would be the Hunny Bunny (tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch) & the Dragonfly (I think it tastes like Mexican candy, sweet with the perfect amount of spicy). You have to try them! My friend and I tried about 6 (total, I'm not a complete lush) of the drinks and we would order all of again. Bartender Virginia was very attentive and personable. Great at making drinks and knowledgable about the menu. Angel was also a great help when Virginia took a quick break. 

Now for the food..WOW! You know it's going to be good when they have double sided chop sticks!Everything's we ordered (about 11 different items, we were hungry and wanted to try as much as possible) was delicious.  My favorite item was the hamachi Serrano, raw yellowtail with some type of magical sauce topped with a Serrano pepper. Seriously so good, my friend and I rock, paper, scissored it for the last piece. I would come back for just this dish. Definitely need to get this if you enjoy fish. The edamame was garlicky and so so good. Dumplings were great.

5673373,2017-09-02,1,lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,"The most stylish sushi experience you can get.

Sake Rok is a part time sushi restaurant, part time dance club that is oozing with flair.  Combining old style favorite Japanese dishes with inventive spices and seasonings give Sake Rok's distinct taste while their decoration and atmosphere make it unique even among the other themed restaurants in the Las Vegas strip.

Like most places on the strip, Sake Rok is a bit expensive, but if you want the most bang for your buck, I recommend the edamame appetizer, loaded with garlic, salt, and other spices and sharing a Sake Rok Ramen with someone.  The ramen is huuuuge and well worth the price.  Splitting an additional sushi roll makes for a complete meal with one of their many brands of sake as a great bonus.  For huge parties, try their Godzilla plate, with enough sushi for 6-8 (or less depending on how much of a sushi glutton you are).  Each plate is served on a custom made Godzilla tray, complete with a Godzilla figure that breaths smoke while you eat.  Sadly, you cannot take the tray home with you.

Sake Rok is open as early as lunch, but it's best to go during the evening.  At night, they blast dance music and switch on a projector showing social media and pop themed imagery and at night, all servers will break into synchronized dance at the random points through the meal.  Not only can your server dance, but they are all super friendly, able to make great recommendations and delve into the menu in full detail.

I wandered in here on my lunch break and the LOUD music blasting towards outside should've been my first clue as to how this was going to be.....but we went in anyways.

The downstairs dining room is fairly intimate. The tables are very close together....but don't worry about anyone else being able to hear your conversation - nobody can hear ANYTHING because the music is so freaking loud. I know I sound super old right now, but this is just not my scene. This is the perfect place to go with a group if you are celebrating something fun or heading out for the night. 

The wait staff all seem like they just drank a case of Red Bull each.....they were all over the place. Turns out they are all actually dancers/entertainers and don't have a lot of food service experience. They were all very nice though, if not a little scattered. They actually all do choreographed routines and dance around the restaurant. It's cool, but who's serving my food while this is happening? Kinda weird.

If you'd like to know about the vibe - there is a DJ with a dance floor, as well as a roof top deck. The menus are HUGE - something you'll have to see to believe. 

Now, the food - it was actually really good. I just had the wagyu sliders (which have foie gras on them - YES!) and the hamachi serrano, which is always a favorite of mine. Both were VERY good.

Overall, I think this place is a great addition to the Park and will do very well since they are right by the new arena.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,0,3,8zFMv926IWzLN_DuCAqnRg

-ROK ceviche - meh. They should try serving it with little rice cracker chips
-Tiger Roll, El Chapo Roll, ROK & Roll - everything pretty much had fake crab in it, so meh. 

Ambiance: This place is not for food, it's for sake bombs and entertainment. I enjoyed the free little show. The MC was energetic and flamboyant and they did a boy band set with a mix of NSYNC and Back Street Boys, so that was right up my alley! Super entertaining and fun. This place is perfect for a bachelorette party. It is SUPER LOUD in here and conversation is IMPOSSIBLE. This place is not a place for kids. The MC drops F-bombs, and it's basically a club atmosphere.

Service: Our service was ok. Water re-fills were attentive and our food came out quickly. I tried to order a virgin mojito and they came back and said they didn't have any mint leaves. :-(

Tip: Ask for a seat downstairs and in the middle so you can see everything during shows.

Note: Bathroom is unisex so everyone goes in the same door and washes hands at the same sinks (bathroom stalls are individual and the door/wall goes from floor to ceiling). There is a bathroom attendant (again club feel).

One of the weirder elements involved in dining here is a dude, who I want to refer to as the hype man. He was all done up with make-up and funky attire. He stopped by our table twice to make small talk with us. We just weren't into it. He was nice enough, but I could have done without him. 

I've also never been to a restaurant with instructional videos. I've been to lots of bars with TV's playing games (which this one was when it wasn't showing said videos). The table next to us ordered saki bombs. Then the hype man came over to hype up the fact that they were ordering the bombs and told us to turn our attention to the screen. It legit was a silly sketch on how to do a saki bombs. Thanks?

The sushi was good, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed almost everything we ordered, except for the eel roll with foam on top. It was one of the specialty ones, and I just didn't care for the taste or texture. We ordered yellowtail jalapeño, spicy salmon and a handful of other rolls. The yellowtail was my fave, no surprise there as it's always my fave. I was surprised at the contrast between the SUPER attentive hype man and our lackadaisical server. We had to wave her down for the check, because we never saw her after our sushi was delivered. We would have ordered another round if she would have stopped by.

Nice atmosphere, nice decorations, and pretty good service. They had the game projected on a wall so it was perfect for our needs.

Maybe its my old eyes, but my friend said the same thing, the menu is hard to read under that lighting. That's pretty much my only complaint, everything else was pretty good. Prices a bit high but that's the strip.
I ordered the 49th state roll and the salmon/avocado hand roll, my friend went with Baked crab hand rolls and Yellowtail jalapeno. A large order of edamame as well. Good stuff.

They have singing and some dancing in here as well, and a lot of sake bombs were going off. At one point the game was on and the entertainer was trying to sing Happy birthday to someone and no one was paying any attention...so it got redone during a commercial break. LOL.

With Pittbull's music blaring and club lights spinning from the DJ booth in the corner, we walked in at dining room at Sushi Rok (pronounced 'Rock"", like Rock and Roll, natch). We were seated quickly and a staff member came out to get our drink order. Our server soon followed to explain the menu, which includes traditional sushi roles, specialty rolls, and even steak- Because they are more than just sushi, our server explained. 
More than sushi they are: someone that can only be described as a hype-man worked the room during our meal, moving table to table with a microphone to interview people and make jokey small talk. At one point he interrupted the dining room with his microphone to introduce a wacky ""How to do sakki bombs"" video, projected 10 feet up on the wall behind us. Then collectively as a restaurant we cheered on another table as they did their first sakki bomb drink. 
Schtick aside, the food was good. With big appetites, my table of 4 ordered a mix of several traditional roles, specialty rolls, edamame, and seaweed salads. The presentation was nice and the rolls were all delicious with more than enough to go around. Because I like a value, I found our bill to be surprisingly reasonable for the amount of food and drinks. Not to mention, we got a dose of all the on-site entertainment swirling around us.

It's 9pm on a Wednesday night (we dine everywhere with our 9 month old baby-luckily he's behaved). We ask the hostess for a table and a high chair, she informs us no kids allowed after 7pm ""due to the provocative dancing and music"". Ok no problem! So we sit outside. After waiting 15 mins (keep in mind the hostess who sat us is literally right in front of us this entire time, maybe 10 feet away) my husband asks if we can get that high chair we asked for or a server. At this point I normally would have left but we were already situated with the baby and I really was in the mood for this miso cod. 

We ordered their sake cocktail (which was the highlight of the dinner), edamame, some color me roll (simple but good), cucumber salad (funkier than the normal but ok), rock shrimp (good), a side of this coconut rice (awesome! They said it was made with coconut milk and coconut flakes).......

And then we asked for the ""steamed vegetables"" specifically told her no salt or sauce that it was for the baby. It came out covered in oil and sesame seeds.......

After the majority of our food comes out (930pm ish) a stroller with a baby comes out of the restaurant-I thought how strange considering we were told we weren't allowed to sit inside with a child. So unless that child had been in there since 7 (2 and a half hours earlier) kinda irritating.

Once all of our entire order made the table the server came back to let me know the kitchen was out of cod. Literally we were done with everything by this point. She said they could make it with salmon (she had seen it done, but never tried it). 10 mins later the salmon made it to the table. It was surprisingly really good, plated with peppers and a coconut foam.

The two stars is specifically for the sake cocktail and coconut rice, I will have to get my miso cod elsewhere because we won't be back.",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,3,0,2,tv-4yy7vf3bJGj6XJiey0g

I have never seen toro with an oxidized tint of color like that, but still took a chance to try. It was super watery, almost like it had just been defrosted and needed a little more time. The spicy tuna hand roll was pretty good. Overall, I would give the food 3 stars. Stick to the basics, because this place should not be judged by food.
