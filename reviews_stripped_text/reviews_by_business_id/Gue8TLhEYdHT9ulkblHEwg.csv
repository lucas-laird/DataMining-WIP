Luckily, I dined in and was able to correct my order. They really bombard you with mundane questions at check out...would you like any egg rolls? to make a donation to...? I had to tell them 3x ""just the bowl and water!"" Oh, and my chicken bowl had exactly 2 small pieces of chicken in it. $6+ dollars for some luke warm noodles and vegetables. Complete rip off. I complained and they shrugged me off. Never going back.",CTePEVftulivu_THMDj7TA,1,0,1,5YXTLc4icSMDypt7o55huA

I felt the drive thru was a fast experience compared to stepping inside their store. I will be back for seconds and thirds!

The honey walnut shrimp was perfectly crisp with softness to it the day on purchased it on 3/30/2018. Some other locations put to much glaze and it makes it too soft and falls apart.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,1,0,5,XNvemDMePNJioDHG25y3jg

The first time, I went  to purchased food for both my dad, and I. I spent a little over 25 dollars for the both of us. This past week was my 2nd, and final visit. Unfortunately I wasn't actually able to eat during this visit. After I left a meeting, I wanted to get something to eat before I went home. I stopped to order some food Togo. Like always, you order down the line, and you pay on the opposite side. When I get to the Cashier, she asked ""May I get you anything else"", and I responded no thank you. It came time to pay. I had a wallet filled with cash, and credit cards. I pulled out a Target Visa gift card. I told the cashier I wasn't sure if it's balance, but there is still money left on the card. Then I asked, ""do you need to know the balance before you run the card""? She relayed ""No"". ""The system will tell me what you owe, and what the balance is"". I thought great. Working in the restaurant industry myself, I know very well how tricky these cards can be if you are unaware of that full function on a variety of systems. 
She proceed to swipe my care, as. Told me there was $7.69 on my card, You owe a dollar, and some change. When she preceded to put in the cash her system began to malfunction so she had to restart the transaction. Unfortunately, all credit cards work the same. Once you swipe a card weather a receipt is produced or not, there will be a pending hold on the credit card holders account for usually 48, and sometimes up to 10 business days. Once they rang me back up, off course my card declined. After both myself, and the cashier explained the situation to the supervisor, he kept telling there is no money on my card, and that there was nothing he could do. I called the credit card company in front of him to get the balance from the automated system, and informed him that the card balance is now 0 with a pending hold of $7.69. He again said there is nothing he could or would do. I explained just so you know there was money on the card, and now there is not. I said to him, that's not right. He said ""sorry about that"". I left, and began to drive away, and then I stopped to call the credit company again, but this time I talked to someone to confirm what I already knew. I returned to the store to inform the supervisor that the credit company said that my money was in fact being held by Panda Express, and they were the only ones to release my money. All I asked him for was the number to either corporate, or someone I can talk to to make sure I Greg my money back. He cause a bit of a seen, kind of making it bigger than what it was. He said I'd have to wait and talk to his manager after I waited for a while. He took my number, and said he would have his manger call me. No one ever called me. It's a bit concerning to me that he kept telling me that because no receipt came out of the machine, nothing was charged. The card was swipe, there will always be a hold, No matter what! If I ever said anything like that to a guest at my establishment I would probably be terminate seeing as the guest like I did could prove right then and there that wasn't accurate. I feel like he was listening to anything I said. This entire process believe it or not took up almost 2 hours of my day. The worst pay was I just went home, and never ate. Some of you are wonder why are you upset over 8 dollars. Honestly, I wasn't really upset the whole, but it is a bit absurd to think I walk into a place to eat, they take my money, and I got nothing in return. I was made to look like I was being irrational, when I fact the entire time, I was completely logical, and  methodical when explains the situation the the supervisor. I wasn't going to write a review, but his whole experience was to ridiculous to not bring to peoples attention. I believed panda could have easily fixed the situation, but the person in charge made the decision not to. I will not be back to this location. I honestly don't know if I see this location staying open long.
