We wanted some good frozen yogurt /sorbet but we saw a few kids filling up their cups with runny, almost melted, yogurt. 
They have a list of some interesting flavors so we kindly asked to sample the lemon sorbet.
The man behind the counter answered 

""I don't have any samples right now.""

That is the most absurd answer I have ever heard when asking for a sample.
HAHAHAHAHAAAA.
As if they have a special batch of sample-only yogurts and sorbets and they gave them all out earlier in the day.
This place loves when kids and other people fill up their cups. 
Reminds me of some of those places at the airport that love to sell their below-average-quality products and poor customer service to people who are just passing through who wouldn't have an opportunity to come again.

I usually do not like to write a bad review on business if they at least are trying their honest best to take care of their customers. But this place truly sucks at all levels. Their ""yogurt"" taste like dirty water, actually, I rather drink the dirty water. But their worst criteria is their customer service or lack of it. The cashier got her training from the worthless manager. The manager had a very snappy, flamboyant atitude  with a chip on his shoulders (I did not understood why... maybe I did). The problem came about when my 14 year old autistic son  wanted to sample their vanilla flavor yogurt and the smileless cashier denying him because a group of 5 of us had already a total of 4 samples. All their samples truly sucked but I was still willing to buy my son his vanilla yogurt until that cashier went into yogurt protective mode.

We went to this place and ordered two pretzels and a crepe.  We were watching the lady make my crepe, not saying anything.  The crepe station is surrounded by glass so people can watch.  After a couple of minutes the lady said NASTILY - "" you can sit down and we will call you when it is ready""

Shocked, We walked a couple of feet away and still watched

The second lady put two pretzels in two bags and handed it to us, however she forgot the cheese and had to be asked for it.

The crepe was on the heater and I asked to Nasty woman did you forget to put ham in it.  She insisted she did, and I asked her to check.  Low and behold the Nasty girl realized she forgot and began to tear apart the crepe to add the ham.  I was not pleased with the messed up crepe, however I did not want to make them more upset because you know I am the paying customer.

They then gave me the crepe and I pointed out they forgot the sauce.  

This is getting a poor rating because of the above, the food was decent.  If the girls were decently nice I would have given it a three star.  I had to correct 3 mistakes and not once did they apologize for the mistakes or the outright rudeness.

Tons of flavors to choose from, from the plain (chocolate) to the slightly more indulgent (cheesecake).  They also have a self service bar of toppings with everything from fresh fruit to crushed up candy bars.  Sort of a do it yourself Pinkberry. 

I liked it, it does get really backed up since it is self service and you can stand there with your cup for awhile while the people in front of you take a year to pick toppings!

I tried two flavors: vanilla and chocolate.  You can always tell really bad frozen yogurt from good frozen yogurt.  Good frozen yogurt will be completely white and made from real milk.  Bad frozen yogurt almost has a cum like color to it.  Off white and you can see through it.  Oh, and It's served at this place.  Basically powder that's mixed with water.

I decided to have my usual: oreos with nuts and chocolate sauce.  I thought it was ok right up until my husband said, ""That is the most foul smelling yogurt I have ever smelled.""  He was right.  At $10 bucks a cup, I felt obligated to eat all of it.  And it made me sick.

I give them an extra star because they serve crepes that are pretty good and very close if you're staying at Mandalay.  Slightly expensive but worth it since there are no crepes in close proximity.

Samples: I was surprised when I asked for sample cups they actually had them. Of course, considering this is Vegas where anything can happen, they required the worker to get my sample.

Toppings: Decent. Fresh fruit (didn't get it because hello, heavy), choco covered marshies, and your other typical candies and froyo toppings

I knew that getting into it, but still wanted some dang dessert.

I went for the cheesecake froyo and some pomegranate sorbet cause it looked awesome. Cheesecake froyo is what I usually order back home and it was okay. Not as good as others but I didn't hate it. The problem was that I put the cheesecake on bottom and the pomegranate on top so I was plagued by that pomegranate garbage through the whole cup.  It was just terrible.

This was a substantial crepe as far as thickness of the crepe, which seemed to fit with the savory type.  The spinach was a nice par-boiled so not too crunchy but not soggy either.

The cheese mix was a  nice touch with average mushrooms.  Fresh mushrooms would have been nicer.

Hopefully their sweet dessert crepes are a bit thinner and lighter, if not it would not be a good match.

Second, the crepes are way overpriced. I ordered a ""Special"" savory crepe, if I remember correctly is $9.99. You can choose ONLY 4 ingredients, and if you want to add a protein it's an additional $1. One of the ingredients I chose was spinach, and chicken for protein. While she was making my crepe I noticed how VERY little spinach she added, more like a garnish amount, and the chicken is cut into little cubes. I barely had any spinach or chicken in my crepe and too much cheese:( I payed almost $12, so disappointing. Not worth it.

 I would recommend going to Tasty Crepes on S. Fort Apache. Their savory crepes are about $7 and you can choose to add all ingredients and the crepes are much larger.",t511fq0nFeppix5_MP-nxA,1,1,1,XCDi6ipwT9LhqA9rMW0UNA

You walk in and it's basically a wall of different flavors of Yogurt. The give you a cup and you just get to wander and mix and match to your heart's content. After picking your flavor you get to pick and choose from about 20 or so different toppings like cherries, strawberries, snickers, etc.

They charge by the ounce (.49 cents) so it can add up quick, but everything was so  yummy so who cares??",vJU7VP831iKtwdwdD49MWw,0,0,4,cW5VJ8WyYIUlQRQApMkZuQ

1) Overpriced
2) You know the little cups that you use at any other yoghurt place? Forget about those here. I requested a few and the guy came to give me to try two floors with an attitude.
3) Most of their flavors are actually flavorless
4) Most of their flavors are not cold enough and come out pretty soft (diarrhea looking if we talk about salt caramel, cookies and cream or chocolate).
5) I didn't try their crepes and I won't try them",beMkFfyPUB2LORU1ponmwg,1,0,2,ElFg3cq2mKX47oU9ywuMQQ
5793288,2013-05-19,0,PSMJesRmIDmust2MUw7aQA,"By far the worst yogurt experience I have ever had. The flavors all pretty much tasted the same, which is watery and bland. They have good mix-ins, but that far from makes up for the yogurt, which should be the highlight, not the disappointment. 

The staff were not very helpful, either. We were thinking of getting crepes, too, but no one was in the crepe center, and even upon looking around no one asked if we needed help. 

I could comment on their prices, but the only way they could make your purchase worth it is if they were giving it away for free.",R1xxRcTY3RpfDtGjisYEjg,0,0,1,ZmXaGl5e0PNIg3iEfbBJqA

While this frozen yogurt not bad, it was definitely not Yogurtland! The texture was how it should be, but the flavor was less creamy and more artificial tasting. I tried Coconut and Peanut Butter with Toasted Coconut and Butterfinger toppings. The Coconut fro-yo was OK, but the Peanut Butter fro-yo had a slight sour tang, weird. The Butterfinger topping was very chunky, as were all the chocolate bars and cookies as Andy I states. I didn't order any these, but Yogurt In also serves made to order Crepes filled with various fillings. I might try a Crepe next time I'm in Vegas, but I hope they're better than the frozen yogurt!",HA8021u0OmrhbZsiudB_7Q,2,1,2,gPxAKafKsKxVdBpaftPdMQ
