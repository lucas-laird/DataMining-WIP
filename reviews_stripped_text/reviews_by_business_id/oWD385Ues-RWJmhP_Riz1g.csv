The wait staff didn't seem too happy to be working on a Sunday though. I don't blame them I guess.

We had red velvet pancakes, lemon blueberry pancakes, a free pancake (Yelp check in) and also biscuits and gravy. It was a ton of food and we took home more than half of it. I thought the price was more than justified.

Prices are decent. The place is sortof cute. Something is missing or else this would get 4 stars. It doesn't quite feel... cozy.

Now, I have thoroughly examined and assessed every review on Yelp regarding GriddleCakes ranging from Amazing to awful, however, I have yet to find an accurate description to acquiesce the fact that ""good""'or ""bad"" reviews even exist. Simply put, GriddleCakes is relegated to neither categories in which it is claimed. GriddleCakes is its own special entity whose Identity need not be subject to opinion. Fact. It is a fact that GriddleCakes is its own, indescribably remarkable establishment. When you walk through those doors, it takes no time to realize that this is not your typical cafe. This family-operated phenomenon has the unique, diverse multicultural ""zing""  while maintaining an extraordinarily cozy, home-like atmosphere that really, in itself,  is a spot that a simple cup of freshly brewed coffee can be enjoyed in solace followed by a genuine conversation with someone who isn't just there to serve you eggs. I mean, you walk into this place and you know you are where you need to be. Their quality of food could go from extraordinary to just great and it would still surpass the rest. No review can do justice, no picture, no comment, no opinion. GriddleCakes, like the Grand Canyon, Cosmos, The Great Pyramids of Egypt or The Northern lights, are indescribable experiences that must be just that; experienced. Do yourself a favor.

Cheese on both was horrendous, as if it came out of a can. Bacon was average at best. English muffin was dry. Potatoes were below par. Grilled cheese again tasted like something out of a can or a spread - I mean if it tastes wet something isn't right, was melted to a consistency like a fondue. 

Service was also disappointing. Small restaurant was crowded with 3 waitresses working the floor. We asked for water and napkins which were forgotten about for over 5 minutes. When I left I had the disgusting liquid cheese and pieces of our sole napkin stuck to my fingers. After complaining about the cheese, the waitress was helpful and had a new sandwich with cheddar (as opposed to American) prepared. For this one reason, we give 2 stars.

The food is excellent, tho! We both ordered the Lumberjack, and once I ordered bacon, the next AM, the sausage patty. GET THE SAUSAGE PATTY! It was beyond delicious! The bacon was dissappointing, soggy limp and pre-cooked. The cooks know how to make a perfect over-medium egg, and that's big in my book. The home fries tasted and felt like they were cooked in bacon grease, but that's GOOD! They were really delicious. The pancakes were the best part of breakfast, tho! They tasted NOT from a mix batter, but from scratch. A bit tangy with buttermilk, they were massive, fluffy and chewy. They serve real butter here for them, but maple-flavored syrup. (none of the REAL stuff, sad to say)

I like the food beeter here, than at The Origional Sunrise Cafe, just a few blocks away. They make a MUCH tastier pancake, and really good coffee, too!

Server kindly took it back & brought back the red velvet one. No biggy it happens. 
Now don't get me wrong it was alright. Pretty tastey but i'll be honest, I enjoy iHops red velvet a heck of a lot better. Personal preference though. This just wasn't sweet enough.

My girlfriend chose this place because we wanted to start off her birthday with a new breakfast place to try. I totally wish we would have gone somewhere else. 

We get there and the place was very crowded and awkwardly set up. Not the crowded were you are excited about how good the food must be because there are a lot of people, but crowded in the way where it was miserable to stand awkwardly at the door until someone sat you and the chaotic mess of seating people made the process really unpleasant. 

When we sat down, we asked for a booth but the person told us that we would have to re-put our name on the list and wait again. We already waited for 30 min. We didn't want to wait again. So we sat uncomfortably at a table that was too small and way too close to the other tables for comfort. I could honestly smell the mans B.O next to me. 

The food was nothing special and pretty bland. I got a skillet and pancakes and my girlfriend got a Greek plate. Our food was almost hard to finish because it was just large portions of bad food. 

The people made us feel uncomfortable because they made remarks about how we ordered too much food and essentially started calling us fat. I felt really uncomfortable.

Came in on a weekend afternoon, and the wait time was 15 minutes. My party was put at on outside table which was fine for the day since it was perfect weather. Inside seating would have been a longer wait, I assume. 

Right when we were sat down, the waitress wanted to take our drink order. I didn't have a chance to see the menu, so I just got water.

Another waiter came back in a good amount of time for us to review the menu and order. I ordered the country skillet, and the other two people in my party ordered the chorizo skillet. I also wanted to check in on Yelp for the free buttermilk pancake. 

Now here's what really annoyed me as a customer. I checked in and showed the waiter that I was checking in and I asked him if that was okay, but he wanted to actually see my screen showing that I checked in, which was fine. However after a pretty long wait for him to come back, my phone was dying and another waitress came by to ask if we needed refills on our drink. I asked her about the check in and she said I was all good to go. Our original waiter comes back and asks me if I checked in and wanted to see my phone again, and I already closed out of the app. Told him the waitress said it was cool and he just kinda stumbled off. Maybe he was busy in the back or something but he seemed irritated at the whole thing, short, and I never saw him as our waiter again lol.

Food came out in a timely manner, and it was good! I didn't really have any complaints other than some of the food items seemed like it was just warm, not hot. But it wasn't bad food.

Reason why I deducted one more spot is because they didn't tell us refills weren't free. Ended up spending around $12 on Orange Juice ($4/cup) thinking it could be refilled free of charge. This should be more clear next time, especially if the waiter is asking if you want a refill, it kind of implies that there would be no charge?

Good spot to try out, but wouldn't come back or go out of my way to eat here.",l1qLnBNjHdNgZSRLgKtrDA,3,0,2,Tlj2ZHkGfFr4IYpVi6qEBw

No, seriously. I used to be a devoted Griddle fan.. This was my go-to for a breakfast spot..  Until I had two NASTY accidents here within a week of each other! 

I had visited this place with my sister. She ordered a chicken salad sandwich of some sorts. When her order came, she lifted a slice of the bread to add salt and pepper, and what do you know, a BUG was crawling in her sandwich. We immediately sent it back, and noticed a few diners looked a little turned off from their food.. So my sister agreed to just order the same thing. They ""made"" her a new one, which came out suspiciously fast, for ""making"" a new sandwich?

Now for the second round. I decided to go here again later on in the week on my lunch hour with a coworker. I ordered my usual egg white omelette with potatoes. As I am slicing my potatoes, there is very CLEARLY a DEAD FRIED FLY IN MY POTATOES. 

This place is disgusting. I will not be back. Sorry, Griddle, but take better care of your sanitation. NASTY.",pCpWHjAiEf6ptK_W6Qb2jw,2,0,1,w6pFgZFpKTa3ZwdJU9dYWA

Now some places let you do more than 1 but I'm not going to complain about it. I order a meat mix with scrambled eggs and my fiance ordered sausage and eggs. Food came out quick. Pancake was good soft and fluffy. Her breakfast was good. However mine was not as good. Mine came with biscuits and gravy and the biscuits was dry and the gravy was bland.

I ordered the lumber jack plate which included 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 3 sausage (or bacon) & fried potatoes. It was just OK. I'd have to say the pancakes were OK but I have had better pancakes at other venues. I didn't care for the sausage. It was extremely hard to cut as the casing seemed very tough. I'd much rather have sausage patties than links. I didn't really care for the potatoes. They were a little tough as they weren't cooked enough.

I showed up last in my party of 8, and figured we'd have to wait a while since there was 8 people in our party. Thankfully, by the time we had all said our hellos, they were ready to seat us after just a few minutes. 

Having never eaten here before, and frankly, not much of a breakfast person, I decided to play it save with french toast and a side of bacon. The wait staff came through quickly and grabbed our orders, and brought us out drinks. By the time we had gotten our first round of drinks, our food started to arrive. I saw many different plates at our table since we all pretty much got something different, and as they were placed each looked better than the last. 

When I finally got mine, I was presented with a full stack of over-sized french toast that looked like it belonged on pinterest or something. I seriously had to hesitate starting to eat it because it looked that good. After I finally regained my senses and picked up some silverware, I began to enjoy what is easily the best french toast I've ever had. I dug into my ginormous plate with full speed, and managed to make it halfway through the last piece before I finally had to stop myself. Somewhere in the brief pauses of the french toast, I took time to polish off the full plate of bacon which can only be described as moments of bliss.

The staff was top notch, and several members of the team came by our tables helping each other out while we were there. The drink refills came by without provocation, and out of 8 people in my group amidst a completely full restaurant, I only saw them ask what someone was drinking once. Very attentive staff with a great attention to detail. If only this place was 15 miles or so closer to my house, I'd be here at least once a week, it's that good.",HeoolPKjgiQkXMRlJxp0-w,0,0,5,xBGqxrm3-2uHxGPvaB_f_w

She came to get out drink orders and left menus for us to look at.  My husbands menu had milk all over the inside of it.  So tip #1... Wipe down your menus.  Tip #2... Wipe down your tables also.  

Had finished my coffee and had to wait for our meals to be delivered to get my second cup.  Hmmm.  No problem because my food was in front of me now.

I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  It came with a side of potatoes.  The Benedict was good! Had a unique flavor and the hollandaise didn't overpower.  The potatoes however... Wah Wah.  They were so disappointing that I didn't have more than two small bites.  They were too mushy with not enough crisp on the outside.  Bummer.  

Now for the real let down.  My husband ordered the country fried steak.  He was actually enjoying it until...   A HAIR was found in it.  That completely ruined our appetites and breakfast was over.  So tip #3... Wear hair nets in the kitchen please.

I ordered the buttermilk pancakes, two eggs and two bacon.

The flavor was extremely lackluster, I'm almost positive they use bisquick  mix in the back... I can do that myself at home for much cheaper. 
The bacon was also poor quality, and flavor. You can buy better bacon at Walmart. As for the ""two"" eggs, the portion was very small, and I'm sure was liquid egg. Considering the current egg crisis I can figure this. They were the best tasting thing on my plate.

Went in and it was really busy so the only place for me and my 2 year old to sit was a small 2 top table. I'm not one to be picky so I took it. I still don't know who my server was because one person took my drink order, another took my food order, another brought the food, and I had to flag down someone else to get things and a different person brought my check. So I'm still pondering that one...
I ordered a short stack, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy. The food came out in a timely manner but the girl who brought my food had attitude written all over her. The plates simply weren't going to fit in my tiny table so she kept rearranging things until I finally dumped some of my food into my daughter's plate and handed the girl the extra plate. She took it and walked off like she had better things to do. I had to flag another guy down for syrup and utensils. The only good part of all this was the pancakes. They are delicious! I stuffed myself full until I realized I still had biscuits and gravy which weren't that good. Nothing else tasted too special either. 
The rest of the staff were nice, especially one older guy who finally noticed my daughter sitting on her knees after we got our food, and offered a booster seat and fixed the wobble in our tiny table. 
I doubt I'll return...which is a shame because I really liked those pancakes.

It's a cute little cafe located in the same plaza as Einstein bagel, Taco Y Taco, Popped Popcorn. So, parking can be a pain sometimes. It's a small space, so you might have to wait if it's busy. I've been fortunate enough that I've never waited. 

As for the food, it's your typical breakfast/lunch joint that serves up your typical breakfast/lunch food. Nothing special. There's your omelettes, skillets, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, etc. Nothing I've eaten here has been super OMG mind blowing. Like I said, it's very typical. Prices are on the lower end with no dish being over $15.

For the service, again nothing stellar. The servers we've encountered just looked like they were going through the motions. Not rude, but just enough friendliness to do their job. No smiles from anyone either.

I abso-freaking-lutely love living so close to Eastern Avenue! The area from around the 215 to roughly St Rose has so many great food choices! I still have yet to try half of the places I've seen driving thru the area!

Griddlecakes is located in the same shopping plaza as Smashburger, Beach Hut Subs, and Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant. It's kind of tucked away in the back corner though, so it may be easy to miss without a little effort.

It's a small little place. It has a down home, Mom and Pop type feel to it. We were greeted as we walked thru the door and led to our booth. Our waitress was friendly and hooked up our drinks-pronto.

It didn't take long to decide what we wanted. I hadn't had a good skillet in a long while! So we both just ordered a couple of skillets. They weren't terribly busy, so our food came out pretty fast...and,damn, was it delicious! Portions were pretty good sized too!

Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We never had to wait for our drinks to be refilled. That is my waitress litmus test right there....if I have to wait a long time or have to hunt somebody down for a refill, it will reflect in my tip and Yelp! Fortunately, this place passed with flying colors!

I'm looking forward to coming back again and trying out more menu items, especially those omelettes! Mmmmmmmm....Omelettes!!

so...yea...this is an easy..

2970819,2014-08-25,1,oWD385Ues-RWJmhP_Riz1g,"I now know why this is place has only 3 1/2 stars. I Decided to come here for some Sunday brunch, which is my favorite day for snacking adventures, and I was pretty disappointed. Everything here looked appetizing, but in this case looks were definitely deceiving. 

Griddlecakes is located in a small space in a strip mall, which means your wait time can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Lucky enough, I only waited for about 15 minutes then was promptly seated. Before I knew it; I had three coffees in front of me: two hot, one cold, two glasses of ice water and a cup of ice. Can you say ""overly helpful"" wait staff? I'm not complaining about that, it was great that I didn't have to ask for anything because they were so on it! 

The food arrived shortly after, like I said before it LOOKED amazing, I ordered the ""Philly Skillet"", this is a deconstructed philly cheese-steak sandwich minus the bread. It comes on a bed of potatoes a lot of delicious melted cheese and to add to this heaping mound of meat, cheese, and cardiac arrest, I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. This is where the meal starts to go downhill. The biscuits where ok, but the gravy was watery and pretty bland. The ""Philly Skillet"" was ok, but over-salted. Everything was cooked well, the steak was perfect, the potatoes were firm, but almost every bite had to be followed with a sip of water. I went through two glasses of water while eating this and I didn't even finish the whole thing. 

My brunching buddy ordered the ""Crab Cakes Benedict"" and the ""Red Velvet"" Pancakes""; these too were disappointing. The crab cakes had a very fishy taste, like the meat was from a can. The hollandaise sauce was good, but not good enough to save the dish. The Red Velvet Pancakes, were also a loss. These just tasted like a flat red velvet cake, very dense not fluffy like a pancake should be. They also had a raspberry sauce drizzled on top, which was peculiar. Normally you don't associate red velvet cake with raspberries.  

My review for Griddlecakes is a tad tough; I was teetering between a three star review and a two star review. I decided to go with the two star review because this food was not ""A-OK"". This location is very clean and the service is impeccable. The food just fell far short of what I was expecting, over-salted and questionable flavor choices. I WILL be coming back to Griddlecakes because I believe in second chances for both people and foodies alike.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,13,6,2,xmewI8cVwZueh0L7TwVbvQ

The menu has a great variety of items. I went ahead with the Florentine benny and my friend ordered chicken and waffles. We also got a free pancake for checking in. My benny was good, sauce was on point but the egg was a little over cooked, the yolk was mostly solid inside. My friends waffles were yummy and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The free pancake had great flavor and was big and fluffy. Serving size was generous too. I guess I felt this place to be average for a couple of reasons. 1. I didn't get a water refill until I was done with all my food 2. Our server wasn't very friendly, maybe she was having an off day. It seemed like she didn't want to be there that day. 3. Parking is hard because it's in a shopping center and fills up quickly. I don't know what it was but I didn't feel like it was above average maybe it was the experience.

The last time I was here, they made a half salad and charged me $2 less. Everyone was happy. This time they refused to make it for me. The owner (or the boss, or whatever) came over and said  they don't do that anymore.

I wanted to let our waiter know but he didn't come back to us until we were half way done with our meal. When I was finally able to tell him that the biscuits and gravy were served cold, he didn't even apologized and just told me he'll get me a new one which NEVER CAME! I watched our waiter handle other things at the counter and return to his other tables but not ours. What did came was the check that was given to us by another waiter! So basically, the food was ok and nothing special - the home fries lacked a lot of flavor that me and my boyfriend had to douse them with salt and pepper and ketchup just to give it life. But getting a side of COLD biscuits and gravy ruined my experience plus having the waiter forget about replacing it made it clear that we picked the wrong place to dine.

Their potions are larger. I got the Garden Skillet and that came with 3 eggs, biscuits and gravy, mushrooms, onions, green bell peppers, tomatos w/cheese on top of home fries! The boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and he loved it! His uncle got a parfait and a short stack of pancakes. The parfait came in a fancy wine glass, filled with fresh strawberrys, banana, yogurt (plain and vanilla). Yum!
Service was good. Asked what we wanted to drink shortly after we seated ourselves. Quick with the refills too.
Prices were great for the portion size they give you. Kinda felt bad for not taking home my leftovers...

Food also sucked. French toast was sprinkled w cinnamon (too much cinnamon that you couldn't enjoy the meal) AND the manager didn't offer to comp anything. Paid $30 for bad service and food.



We waited for 40 minutes before anyone realized there was anything wrong and that others were getting their orders before us.

I understand that mistakes happen and usually I am happy to wait for them to fix the mistake but they seemed non remorseful for their mistake.

When our order finally arrived it was wrong and a portion had to be sent back and replaced. Eggs over easy is not hard and rubbery

My favorite meal is the Lumberjack, offering up three eggs, sausage or bacon, hash browns and two pancakes the size of Toyota Prius tires.  I've also had the pleasure of having a customized omelet, also oversized and plenty tasty.

You can tell the food is good because the last couple of times we've gone there's been a short wait.  It's a pretty small joint, so if they enjoy continued success maybe they'll be able to expand, especially since no other restaurants in that plaza can seem to stay in business.

It has maybe 10 booths and 3 tables.  A waiter or waitress is never very far away.  Prices seemed reasonable but when we got down to the food and service it left a lot to be desired.

First off when we came in we weren't greeted and were unsure if we should seat ourselves or not.  After a moment a waiter or manager came over and said they'd clean a booth off for us since there were no clean ones.  It was done within a minute but the rag they used to clean it off was very dirty/moldy and we could smell it on the table.  When utensils were set for us the waiter noticed my fork was dirty so he retrieved a new one.  Two different people came over to take our drink orders.

I ordered hamburger steak with scrambled eggs, home fries, and wheat toast.  My girlfriend got corned beef hash with sunny side up eggs, home fries, and sourdough toast.  Food was delivered fairly quickly although instead of having A1 Steak Sauce, they had a Kroger 1883 steak sauce which wasn't too good.  Also they gave us all our toast on one plate, which was a bit annoying.

The scrambled eggs and toast were fine, and my girlfriend liked her corned beef hash. I thought the flavoring of the home fries was good although some of them were undercooked and my girlfriend did not like the flavoring at all.  The hamburger steak was a bit gristly and my girlfriend said her eggs were very undercooked and practically cold in the middle.

We won't go back again.  Nothing was overly offensive or anything like that.  It's just that we both would prefer other places like Blueberry Hill or Denny's.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,u4i6Ei3Qk7M8hZkgU_qylA

The portion was in the middle for me, not too big not too small. It was a lot more filling than I expected and had to take the rest home. Now I know I can get by on one and completely avoid the full stack option. The syrup that was on the red velvet was delicious, I loved how the syrup and the powdered sugar was presented in a criss cross pattern!

It took an hour to get our food (although we saw many others get their food more quickly), the bacon was microwaved, the gluten free waffle was just dough. During that hour no one told us why it was taking so long.  We watched a woman come in and order a to-go breakfast, come back in 15 minutes and pick it up (while we waited), at another table the two guests ordered after we did, then ate and were replaced by a single person who ordered and ate--all before we ever got any food. It was not just us that was suffering, however. A couple near us got their sausage until finished with their meal after waiting about as long as we had (customer refused the sausage). 
After we waited 45 minutes or so a woman, purportedly the manager or owner, arrived and visited tables where she knew people and solved their problems---but not us--and not others, only table where she knew people by name. I have been there at least 20 times by the way--but would not consider myself a regular. 

Food took forever and was terrible when arrived.  To add insult to injury the woman in charge deducted two cups of coffee from our $33 bill.  Did you hear that?  She thought it was ok to make us wait an hour, get uncooked food and then try to make ut up to us by comping two cups of coffee!   Who gives a guest two cups of coffee for to make up for that experience? I know who does that, its a restauranteur who should not be in business, that's who.

They also offered a free pancake when checking in on Yelp. The french toast and Griddle Platter were very good. So I give the food 5 stars. The pancake was a bit overcooked and rubbery, but it was free so I won't consider it in our overall rating. The staff was friendly, but most of them are young and don't quite know proper food and beverage ettiquette. When my water was refilled they reached right over my plate to get to my water glass and condensation from the metal water pitcher was dripping all over my french toast. The server later decided to replace the jam condiment caddy that was on our table with a full one. I appreciate wanting us to have more jam, which wasn't needed because the original jam holder was more than half full, but she reached right between the two of us in the middle of our conversation to replace it and didn't say a word. I also had to tell them that they forgot to put peanut butter on my french toast, which they brought out later in a small condiment cup and still charged me for it. Not worth the additonal $1.99. 

Overall the food I would give a 4.5-5 rating, friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the cafe a 4 rating, and customer service know how and restaurant ettiquette a 3 rating. Overall rating a 4, but more like a 3.75 if I could give that as a rating.

We have eaten breakfast many times at GC, and found the quality of the service and food above average. Their posted hours on Sunday's are from 7am to 3pm. We live less than 2 miles from the Eastern location, so we left the house at 6:40. We arrived at GC at 6:50, parked and approached the front door just in case they were open for coffee for early risers. The temp was 38 degrees, so when we found the front doors locked, not wanting to wait in the cold shade, we returned to our vehicle to wait until 7am. The lights were on and their was a person in the kitchen who clearly saw us. The fact that they were not open early was no big deal. At 7am, an older lady tried to open the front door, but it was still locked. She stood and waited. 7:05 and 7:10 came and went, and GC was still not open. My wife and I decided that 7:15 was our cutoff wait time. At 7:12, the lady waiting at the door approached our truck and told us she eats at GC every Sunday, and they always open on time. She let out a frustrated sigh, and then got in her car and left. We left as well, severely disappointed that one of the now 2 people inside did not have the courtesy to come to the front door and let us know what the problem was, and what time they would be open. While we understand that people call in sick, or arrive for work late, there is no excuse for not letting loyal customers know what's going on.

I decided on the Short Stack Combo for $8.98.  It included 2 hotcakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and home fries.  The hotcakes were good; fluffy and light. The bacon was very crispy, as I like it.  The eggs were standard fare.  The potatoes, well, I usually leave home fries or hash browns on my plate, but these were little cubes of deliciousness that were partially crispy and partially soft.  I really enjoyed them. 

The BF ordered the Meatlovers Scramble $10.99, which was eggs scrambled with bacon, sausage, ham, homes fries, and cheese.  Served with biscuits & gravy.  The scramble was good, but the biscuit seemed stale and the gravy was pasty instead of tasty.

We would probably visit again, but it would not make the top of our brunch list.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,5,4,3,emGAjfO6a9k8XPMe56g6fw

Anyways - inside is clean but service is slow and not very informative - when I ordered the side of 2 pancakes knowing it was our first time eating there the waitress should have told us that 1 pancake is already pretty huge - that info would've been nice!!!

The food took awhile and when it came it wasn't hot - 
The food was OK - it's nothing special - the crab cake eggs benedict was a tad bit too fishy and the hollandiase sauce had no flavor - it was the same with the BF's biscuit covered in white gravy - the gravy was tasteless.....

The Red Velvet pancake with chocolate chips and cream cheese syrup was OK as well....I wouldn't order that again and if I did only 1 pancake is needed as a side and to share.
The kid's chicken tenders and fries were good enough for her - 
The BF's breakfast skillet was OK - but he didn't care to finish it which is unusual....

I've been coming to this place since they've opened. Since then, I've tried pretty much everything, almost everything. Although they did change their name to ""The Griddle Cake"" thankfully it's the same owners and menu. They serve breakfast and lunch. 

It's a small little restaurant that doesn't seat many, which is why it's always busy because it's really yummy! The atmosphere is just plain comfortable. You'll be happy and cozy. 

Yesterday was New Years Day and also was our anniversary, so we decided to have our first meal of 2014 at this place! We walked in, there was a bit of a wait, but not too bad. Then ordered with our waiter, who's always on point every time we get him. Hubby got the Philly Cheese steak Skillet, which is mixed with the obvious the steak, lots of gooey cheese, veggies, home potato fries  and 3 eggs, he had them cook 2 scrambled and 1 sunny side up to top it on the steak skillet, oh and it also came with a huge side of Biscuits and gravey.  All the skillets come in large portions for an affordable amount which was around $10 or so. 

I had a build your own omelette and I got an egg, cheese, sausage, tomato, mushrooms and green pepper omelette. Which came with home fries and your choice of toast again with an generous portion for about $9.00 or so. This omelette is fluffy and so flavorful. I love it. 

And last but certainly not least. We had to get the short stack (should've gotten full) of The BEST red velvet pancakes!!! With Strawberries!!! These red velvet pancakes are the most buttery, soft, moist, fluffiest pancakes ever! They just melt in your mouth. They include chocolate chips in the batter and swirl chocolate syrup and powered sugar on top and sprinkle the sweet sliced strawberries on top with cream cheese frosting on the side.

Unfortunately, this place fell in the latter category. The service was lackluster, bordering on dismal. The food was average, nothing to call home about. I had the french toast, soggy like my mood. But the reason as to why I graced my presence on Yelp was because they overcharged my bill by 10 dollars and if I didn't catch it, they wouldn't have said anything. After confrontation, they did not apologize and just handed the check back to me with little more than an oops. I didn't expect anything, just a ""sorry"" would've sufficed.

When we flagged someone down to get menus, we also had to get someone else to bring utensils. The prices are stupid- plain and simple. A pancake and eggs shouldn't cost that much.

The tables in the middle of the restaurant are a bit small and you feel a little packed in if its a full house. On weekends there is usually a wait up to 20 minutes. Staff is very friendly but it did take about 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted. The food has always been great in my opinion (and very reasonably priced). I always order the tuna melt- one of the best I've had! My husband usually makes his own omelette and staff was accommodating at subbing potatoes or toast for oatmeal (most breakfasts spots do not for some odd reason). This is one of my go-to restaurants on the weekends, great gem in Henderson!

My wife and I have been here many times over the years and I confess I haven't had much in the way of lunch items here. Why you ask? It's because their breakfast entree's are the best you will get anywhere on planet earth! We make a point of coming here for that!
This very morning (Sunday 9/7/2014) my wife had the garden skillet and I had my usual ""Lumberjack"" with 2 eggs, bacon, their unbeatable ""home fried taters"" along with 2 giant fluffy ""melt-in-yer-mouth"" pancakes topped with great tasting coffee. Oh man! There's simply no doubt that we had the best breakfast you'll find anywhere...even home cooking does not get better than this. Speaking of ""home"", this place is very homey feeling. Folks of all ages will be very comfortable here.
Griddlecakes' specialty of course is their breakfast selections., I mean with a name like Griddlecakes you can expect that. But their lunch entree's are also exceptional. My pick is the breakfast menu only because I personally prefer breakfast. It's my all-time favorite food choice. My wife actually agrees with me on this one!  So if its the best homemade style breakfast you'll ever want for, this establishment is an absolute must. The prices?....very affordable for all budgets. This is a great place for families too,

It wasn't a big deal because I noticed she was the only server so I was like okay, that's fine.

The busser was not on it. I was a before server too, and my number 1 rule was to ALWAYS keep my customers drinks full. I drank all of my water and I was not finished with my meal. He would come by and take plates from our table, but he wouldn't refill my drink for some reason. I even placed my empty cup at the end of the table as a sign to PLEASE REFILL.

The entryway situation was a little strange in that when you walk in you are staring right at a 2 person high-top table eating their breakfast and no host stand. Luckily, one of the servers quickly made eye contact and asked ""how many?""  It could have been a little awkward if they were all busy and didn't see us for a few minutes. At the same time, there were no tables available and they did just fine. We waited for about 5 minutes and were seated.

Nice selection on the menu and the ""Build Your Own Omelet"" for $7.99 caught my eye right away. You get to pick 3 things to put in it for that price too, with a $.75 up charge for additional items...reasonable and to be expected especially when they give you three. 

I opted for tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, turkey sausage. It came with breakfast potatoes that were very good (not all fried and greasy) and a buttermilk biscuit that was about average. Add a coffee to the mix and you have the makings of a delicious Saturday morning breakfast.

The chicken was quite dry and more batter-y than chicken. It even had that frozen look to it, it didn't make it look all that appetizing.

There is absolutely no place to wait besides outside because (1) the inside is TINY (2) it's crowded (3) the booths and tables come almost right up to the front door. So outside we went! 

After a few minutes we were seated and brought two waters. Here began my next disappointment: The service here is terrible! There's about eight employees running around (which you think would be enough to serve the limited tables) but they all are either confused or just not attentive. We waited forever to order and then waited forever for our food.

And the final disappointment: The food. My blue jay pancakes, which I had drooled over so much when reading the menu, were just not that spectacular. The strawberries and blueberries were both unripe and hard, and the pancakes were chewy and tough. They definitely give you enough food though!

First - if you are looking for The Griddle like the one in LA, this isn't it, so don't get your hopes up.

Now...  One of the easiest things to make tasty is probably a simple plate of bacon and eggs with toast.  The Griddle accomplished that.  I ordered two eggs over easy, a side of bacon, and wheat toast. I got everything I asked for, and it was all pretty good.  Coffee was fine and my cup stayed full during our visit.

I will be back to try other items. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall good experience.,DaEuyn1GgLeZ3Jn-bcZnvA,0,0,4,6bcWEuSLnkE5BmuOW1xq8Q

4934593,2013-09-17,0,oWD385Ues-RWJmhP_Riz1g,"Food here is pretty good, however, this place should be a five and it is borderline 2.

a.  Location - 5 star - Perfect Location on the east side of Eastern Avenue.  Plenty of parking and entry/ exit way.

b.  Ambiance - 3 star - A bit small, I think there must be about 12 tables inside and 3-4 outside. Way too small for people wanting breakfast and nowhere to sit. They cannot control their waiting line very well as there is nowhere to sit or stand.

c.  Food - 3 Star - I know I said it was pretty good, however, it is spartan at best. I ordered a made to order omelette with some veggies, jalapenos and peppers with egg whites.  Why they don't have a veggie omelette is odd and why charge me .50 per ingredient?  The omelette was small.  I did not want the home fries and asked for fruit. It was very little bits in a very small cup.

d.  Price - 2 star - So, why serve an omelette that looks like it was made with two eggs? Why serve it on a plate with lots of extra room, If you can count the pieces of bits on the plate, that means there is way too little. Only the toast seemed to be filling the plate.  I did not get my value for dollar theoretically as my cousins paid for breakfast.

e.  Service -1 star - Here is the biggest failing!  The service here is very poor. They do not come often to fill coffee, never remembering if you had decaf or regular. I had to ask for water twice and then ask them ask for refills. They cannot handle the wait line on a Sunday with any efficiency.  Really a poor way to go in my book.

GK says, this place could be great if they were efficient and organized and gave you value for your dollar.

I may go back, mainly because hanging with my cousins was awesome!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,1,2,y32NxBTPBwSpZp6lowo66Q

Service was decent - fulfilling the bare requirements of refilling my water and taking my order. Other than that, where's the conversation? Better yet, where is the smile?

Onto the food, I had ordered a breakfast concoction comprised of eggs, feta, spinach, and chicken. Pita on the side as well as potatoes, it was decent. The chicken was dried out, while the eggs were flavorless. I had a bite of my friend's breakfast burrito, which was good. However, my other friend's eggs and bacon looked dismal and...limp.

The one benefit of the Griddle is the location. Conveniently near the 215 and with a large parking lot, the store is easy to get to. The day I came, the doors were opened as to permit brunch fare to be eaten outdoors.

We had just sat down when someone came up to ask for our drink order...I hadn't even opened the menu yet so I was a little taken aback. I wanted to order juice or a mimosa but I was too overwhelmed so I just ordered a water. Then our waiter came back and I ordered The Arnold pancakes and my fiancé ordered a three stack with blueberries with a side of bacon and two eggs. We got our food soon after and mine was really good, but he wasn't impressed with his. The blueberries were cooked into the pancakes but we both thought they would be on top of the pancakes...a little nitpicky sure. But what really got us was the side of bacon and eggs. It was definitely NOT two eggs that we were served (see picture.) I was going to complain but after we got our food we never saw our waiter again.

I honestly didn't have any complaints about the food, however the service was horrible.  
My eggs benedict was perfect, french toast was good and my friend said the vegetable skillet was good as well.  The pancake was cooked perfect, had a nice crisp to it and not burnt.  Thanks to Yelp we got to try a free yummy pancake !!! The food isn't extraordinary, but I would definitely come back if they stepped their game up on service.    

We waited about 20 minutes outside for a table, when there were clearly tables open outside.  Then when the lady called my name she asked would you like to sit outside ?  Umm I thought first available was what that meant ... guess not.   When we sat  down we literally had to wait another 10 min before my group got irritated and actually had to go inside the store and ask for a server.  Now when the server got there, took our order he was great.  Then after that we didn't see him again.  Someone else refilled our drinks.  The food took way too long that you're starting to notice other tables seated before us received their food.  By the time we got our food they were super quick to give us the bill, which is fine.

It's small, so I can only imagine how busy it is on weekends. During the week we usually have no problem getting a table. The service is fast and friendly and they have a great selection. I have tried just about all of specialty pancakes - I think my favorite is probably the Blue Jay, which are lemon blueberry pancakes topped with whipped cream and blueberry compote. We are also HUGE fans of the breakfast burrito - I might go so far as to say it's the best I've had in town (taco shops excluded). We always add mushrooms and spinach to it and it's so delicious! Their potatoes don't look like much, but are really tasty. My only complaint would be just a general gripe about the pancakes - although they are tasty, they end up being tough most of the time.

5923704,2010-09-08,2,oWD385Ues-RWJmhP_Riz1g,"Overview:  It was a Saturday morning on Labor Day weekend and all the Breakfast spots were packed.  We went from full parking lot to full parking lot till we got to the Denny's on Eastern.  Yes, I'll admit it, I eat at Denny's.  When you've worked a 12 hour night shift at the hospital, sometimes you just want some greasy stuff piled up high on your plate with some pan cakes and syrup.  Since the Denny's on Eastern was also full, we drove by wondering where we should try next when we spotted The Griddles sign and pulled in.

Location:  Get off on the 215 at Eastern heading south.  It will be on the Left a bit past Denny's and the gas station.  

Exterior:  This place is small with a few tables outside.  You could almost miss it.

Interior:  There are booths on both walls and high tables and stools down the middle.  Nothing Fancy here.  Very bare bones.

Service:  We were given immediate service and our food and drinks came out very quickly.  I did not take the time to check my tab as others have suggested.  Maybe next time I'll take the time to do so just to see.  The price didn't seem out of control, so I assume they got it right.

Food:  Your standard American breakfast affair.  Not the hardest thing in the world to cook up.  They got eggs, meats, pan cakes, and the standard guest.  I was happy to see real fresh squeezed orange juice.  It wasn't that American cheese orange of your store juice.  This was a deeper orange with bits of pulp floating on top.  The taste was a bit tart, but like biting into an orange.  If it's not fresh, then I need to ask them what brand it is, cause its good.  My choice that morning was chicken fried steak.  Their version comes with the white gravy, a pile of potato cubes (home fries), eggs made to order, and toast.  It didn't seem like a lot, but it was very filling and satisfied my breakfast cravings.  Taste wise, it was okay.  The chicken fried steak was average, the gravy didn't blow me away, the home fries were equally adequate, and my toast was burnt.  

Summary:  Overall an average breakfast spot.  I've actually ate better at an Ihop or Denny's.  Service was speedy and the bill was very reasonable.  Great Orange Juice, okay food.  The fact that I didn't have to wait to be seated or have a problem finding a parking spot was the bright spot.  That in and of itself pushed me up to 4 stars.",aj2pS6AFVlzKDDUrisIRaA,4,2,4,KwAMJxbRBoVCeyos4WJDYQ
