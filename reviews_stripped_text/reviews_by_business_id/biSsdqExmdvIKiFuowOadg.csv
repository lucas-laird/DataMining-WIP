Anyhow, I have eaten here numerous times and the food is always fantastic. I love the Las Vegas Roll, the Lemon Roll, the Shishito Peppers, the Charred Edamame, the Short Rib Ramen, the Stellar Chips... the list goes on and on. 

Also, they have a great selection of beer and wine and an awesome cocktail menu. The Water Dragon is a personal favorite. 

It is the only sushi I actually crave and the atmosphere is friendly, modern and kawaii.

Both good, though I favor the crouching tiger. Both have a good kick in it! Tried the Foo's dogs for appetizer, good one! Wish there were more! Forbidden black rice was delish, different but the more you eat of it, the better it gets! I had the pork belly ramen, filling and doesn't leave you too full. I had a bite of my friend's hanger steak, delicious! Careful with the white dipping sauce, if you're not into the spicy things. We both thought some kind of aioli, mayo something.... Too hot, wasabi hot! They were late bringing my friend's meal but compensated by giving us the Funkler for free! This dessert is soooo good, yummy, warm home goodness-good!

Not only is it a great place to hang out with your friends and enjoy a good meal, it's very family and kid friendly offering a kids menu and fun activities. I totally recommend checking out their happy hour, its filled with great deals on food and drinks and the bartenders are warm and welcoming. (If your a big fan of Moscow Mules they make the best ones I've ever had.) I've pretty much tried everything on the Lucky Foos menu and after doing that it's pretty hard just ordering one thing . I go for the Stellar Nachos, which is wonton chips with spicy tuna, avocado crema, sriracha, & pico de gallo, served with smoked chili aioli, they are soo good. All their ramen soups are tasty and they also give you an option of getting dishes vegetarian style . The Lucky Rice is also one of my favs. Oh and you have to try the Funkler for dessert the kids will love that. All in all Lucky Foos is one of the best local spots Vegas has to offer off the strip. From the great ambiance , to the friendly staff it's worth checking out.

136024,2015-02-08,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"The rad name and great reviews on Yelp probably increased my expectations.  It was good and has potential.  

We sat at the bar on this visit which had one bartender who was having to make drinks for the entire restaurant.  Although the bartender was super nice, i felt they should have had 2 for dinner service to maintain better service at the bar.  Also, in observing interactions between servers and bartender, the team work lacked.  It seemed the servers were confused often.  I'm sure it's all related to the newness of the place.  

We had the tuna poke, some pork belly ramen, robata grilled beef and onion and some nigiri.  The ramen was pretty tasty and they split it for us.  The robata beef was tender and good and the poke was nice.

The pricing seemed high on the sushi to me, compared to other sushi in the area at around the same quality.

The service was exceptional though and she was attentive. The Fried Rice with Pork Belly was amazing!!!! The Foo Dogs was exception in take. The satay looking thinks with shrimp and jalape√±o bacon was very flavorful. The ambiance and music, primarily 80s music i.e. Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode, really nice. I really want to give it a 4.5 because the sushi was fresh but not worth paying a la carte prices when we are in the capital of all you can east sushi, but everything else was sooooo good and the prices very reasonable 6-15 per plate and the dessert was very good we ordered the Giant Fortune Cookie and the Blondie Brownie and it was good so it did deserve 5 stars.

244037,2015-02-08,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Came here for a friends birthday with a group of 8 during happy hour a couple of weeks ago. It was an alright experience overall. There were some things I really loved and others that were not so great. 

The good:
-The decor is awesome - they have one wall that we were sitting near that had an incredible painting of animated characters all fitting into one epic scene. Our whole group got a kick out of all the small details in it and spent a lot of time just searching it. It was a fun touch. 
-They use an app called Rockbot that lets guests choose songs to play in the restaurant. It was like a jukebox operated through your phone and our group had so much fun with it. 
-The scallion and chicken skewers were so yummy! We asked for one order of these, then had to ask for a few more because they were so good. 
-In the restrooms, they have this awesome salt scrub that makes your hands feel so soft!

The ""eh"": 
-Our server was great at first, but seemed like she stopped caring about our table by the end of our dinner. She took our order pretty quickly and the food came out at a decent speed, but many of us had waters that needed refilling throughout the night and had to ask several times for more. Also, after we finished our dessert, it took about 20 minutes for her to finally come by and ask if we wanted the check. Then another 5 minutes for her to bring our check....which she then realized she had made a mistake on so she had to fix that which took about another 10 minutes. By the time we were able to pay, the table was already cleared off and we were all ready to walk out. 
-Something that wasn't a huge deal but just kind of annoying was that during happy hour, they don't let you order off of the regular menu. We were really there specifically for happy hour so this didn't bother us too much but it would've been nice to have the option in case someone in our group was really hungry and wanted something bigger. 

The bad:
-Some of the sushi rolls we tried (specifically the philadelphia and the eel) were very fishy tasting and not fresh at all. In fact, we had to send one of the rolls back because it did not taste like good fish. This was a huge turn-off for the whole place and probably the biggest reason I'm giving them only 3 stars. The rest of the food was good, but fishy tasting sushi is a no-no and just plain gross.",7kFAZQwmi3037lhIcVH3ig,2,0,3,36TjQwE31xC1R8WGW1j4Ww

273943,2015-01-11,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"BAD DINING EXPERIENCE

Thought atmosphere was fine, lots of tv's, but similar to prior restaurant that was there.
Ordered the following:
2 Yellowtail; 1 Big Eye Tuna; 1 Albacore (nigiri's) - Good
Crispy Rice Tuna - Good
Beet Salad - Good
Charred Edamame - Soggy and overcooked
Chicken Lettuce Wraps -  Lettuce was wilted, not crispy; chicken had too many mushrooms and was mushy
Salmon - Delicious and tender
Hot Green Tea - Piping hot served in a nice pitcher 
Moscow Mule - Good

James, our waiter, spilled my Moscow Mule on our table and in my lap. He tried to tell another worker that most of the drink got on him but that was not the case since my jeans and under my chair were soaking wet.

They tried to serve us the Yellowtail, Albacore and Crispy Rice Tuna twice which we rejected and reminded them that we already received the orders.

An owner, Mike, asked us about our dining experience which we relayed the above information to him.

When we received our bill, we were surprised that they did not try to compensate us by reducing our bill (at least by the spilled drink). Also, we realized that they charged us twice for the crispy rice tuna.

The cocktails are also delectable. Take the menu descriptors to heart because they ring true.

I enjoyed a Resting Panda, a floral Hendricks gin cocktail, and dined on a lemon roll, kimchee laced, fried egg-topped chicken fried rice, and the signature Foo burger. Dessert was a leave the plate empty green tea moochi and a housemade raspberry pur√©e.

Now, let's talk about the food - everything is SO yummy! Everyone at the party loved all the rolls we ate, every roll flew off the plate and people RAVED about them!! And the stellar chips and housecut fries are BOMB! I love the food here and can't wait to come back again and try even more of their options. Lucky Foo's was the PERFECT place to host a party. If I could, I would throw a party here every month just because the team made this one of the best birthday's for my hubby and I. I love the atmosphere here and will be telling everyone I know to get their butts in there and try out what they have to offer. The Lucky Foo's team is the example of how restaurants should be run in Las Vegas/Henderson. We will definitely be back again and again, and so will all our guests.

Another server promptly took our drink order which was delivered immediately. Another server came and explained some of the specials and gave us time to contemplate. They returned in about five or six minutes to take our order. Order was served in about 15 to 20 minutes which was served hot and fresh. We started with the Edamame Hummus served with sliced cucumbers which was delicious and pretty filling. Our entrees were the House Special Foo Burger which was easily as good as any $18 burger for $14. I had the BBQ Short Rib special which was delectable-with great flavor and comparable to Wagyu in tenderness and flavor. All of the dipping sauces (ketchup and Ranch) were made on premises and unusual in a positive way.

They were so accommodating, they said yes and  even brought extras water for him. We tried a variety of menu items. The sushi choices we picked were The Secret Weapon & The Surf & Turf, both really unique and delicious. We also tried the pork belly yakatori, soo flavorful and tender. Our last item was the cheesey brothless ramen noodles. This was the only dish I was slightly disappointed in, I was hoping for more of the smoked Gouda cheese flavor described, but it was a little overpowered by the herbs mixed in & sprinkled on top.

If they maintain the service my friends and I received this last visit, this restaurant will be unstoppable.  This place is well priced for the product they provide!

Our server, Amy, was perfect.  She was pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable.  My friend is particular about his drinks and she answered all his questions- no problem.  My Moscow Mule was excellent.  She did proper follow ups with all of us if we wanted refills on our drinks.  We took a bit of time to pick our entrees because we were talking, and that was no problem.  She came back in timely intervals to see if we were ready to order.  She would walk by, check the table, and she could tell if everything was as it should be- so didn't feel the need to interrupt and ask.  There was a young man that kept our water topped off.

Our friends arrived before we did, and they were sensitive to another guest that smelled like the marlboro man himself- the owner gladly accommodated, reseating them in a booth between the bar and the trendy modern Japanese mural wall.  A nice conversation piece for the fans of modern Japanese culture and nerds alike.

Starters: Charred edamame, Ebiyaki, and Stellar Chips.  Easy to share amongst us.  
Cocktails: Moscow Mule, Apple Blossom x2, Sake (on tap).  
Entrees: Cedar Plank Salmon on Forbidden Rice, Sunshine Sushi Roll, Foo Burger, Crispy Rice Delight
Dessert: The Funkler (A nice finish on the meal)

Everything was properly seasoned, delicious, not over the top- per usual!  The food has always been creative and well prepared.  This visit just maintains that reputation with us.  Our friends loved it.  All of our plates left the table clean.  Doesn't matter if it comes from the kitchen or the sushi bar, it's very enjoyable.

The ambiance/environment is trendy, modern Japanese with chill upbeat music playing and martial arts films w/ subtitles playing silently on a few screens.  It just feels good to be in this space.  Very relaxed and comfortable. Balanced lighting.  A nice space to have some great conversation with some friends.

This restaurant use to struggle with service, but have always been on point with environment and food.  They really took the extra steps to move this in the right direction, and I'm pleased for it.  We'll be back again with more friends.

The waitress came along and raves about a few items on the menu to include specialty made cocktails and plates. She wasn't exaggerating, the food was great!

It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice.

Hrmmmmmm.... I do want to give it a gushing review, but I can't.

First off, not going to lie, the place looks pimp. It looks like an Asian restaurant from a Quentin Tarantino film. If you remember the club from Kill Bill, I got that vibe: traditional but hip at the same time. And the service was killer. Our server was very chatty but not too intrusive, and helped us pick some really great items, including cocktails and drinks. She checked on us frequently, and was really pleasant. So those arenas get high marks from me. Psychic high fives all around.

The food was my main issue, and why this review only gets three stars. Their specialty seems to be the yakitori grill, so I ordered some pork belly skewers with a side of chicken fried rice. While the fried rice is served at an okay-I-guess size (and heads up, they fry an egg on top with runny yolk, not scrambled in like other places), I only got three little skewers, with five chunks of meat. Tasty, to be sure, but I couldn't help but think all the way throughout, ""I just paid $10 for fifteen small pork belly nuggets."" My wallet wept.

It was an ""Oliver Twist"" moment, really...
ME: Please, sir, may I have some more?
LUCKY FOO'S: MOOOOOOOOOORE???

Dinner, drinks, and a split dessert (since I was still hungry!) cam to $60 for two people. Gak. Overall, Lucky Foo's has got something good, but it can stand to be better. 2.5 stars is what I would have liked to give it, but it gets the third star for excellent service.

The service has been impeccable so far. Matter of today I went around 6-7pm and though busy I wouldn't have known the difference. Everyone is on point. I also got the honour of observing the owner/manager in action. He is an amazing man, and you can tell he's humble at the core.

I saw him assisting his staff, checking in with each guest. Matter of fact he took the time to sit down and have a mini chat with me and my daughter. 

For those having a hard time with the service, don't give up on them give them another try and I am sure they will redeem themselves.

This has become our favourite local dinner spot. My fianc√© and I absolutely love their creative menu, and find it absolutely delicious. 

We also really like the main bartender. Not that either of us drink, but he has come over and talked to us any time we are having a problem i.e I didn't know that they no longer serve regular menu during the late night""Happy Hour."" The French fries aren't on the menu at happy hour and that's all my daughter eats along with a little sushi. He told us he apologises for the misunderstanding and would have the kitchen make her fries! 

Again don't give up on them so easily. Remember it's a mom & pop at the end of the day. Not a big name restaurant. That's what makes this place so incredible.

We had reservations at 5:45 for my husband's birthday dinner (party of two) and showed up at 5:45. First, we waited several minutes for the hostess to seat one party of five, while we stood in the door with no acknowledgment. We were finally seated, where we sat for about 10 minutes without any contact. Next a server from another section said she would get our server. Mind us we are sitting at a middle table where people (staff) are walking around us constantly. Our server approaches the table @ 6:02 and we ask her for the happy hour menu, which she proceeds to tell us happy hour is over. ""Well, we have been sitting here 15 minutes""...she leaves the table to do something (we were unclear) and about 4 minutes later another server put down two waters. Another 4 minutes passes, when a man (we assume it is the manager) walks by and asks if he can remove our menus that are sitting to the edge of the table. We both look at him in surprise, ""sure, you can take the menus since we have never ordered."" He had a look of surprise, ""you haven't ordered?"" At this time, we have been sitting at the table for about 22 minutes. We look at him (both very unhappy), and tell him yes you can take the menus, because we are leaving. He says, ""I'm sorry"" and walks away. We make our way to the door and hostess smiles and says have a good night. I stop and ask her, ""who is the manager?"" she says I'll get him and I say, ""Oh is it the guy walking around, checking his cell phone, who watched us get up and walk out? No, we do not need to speak with him!""  And then we left.

After about 10 minutes someone raced by and nodded to us and said they'd be a minute. We asked the other people waiting how longed they'd been waiting, which was a good 15 minutes they said. After another five minutes with no hostess, we bailed. Can't understand how you can have so many empty tables and make people wait.

1500360,2015-06-15,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Boyfriend took me here to try to find another sushi place I would like just as much as the other 2 establishments I'm pretty loyal to, and I have to admit that it's a good place to eat and hang out. 
Their sushi list isn't as large as other sushi restaurants, which is understandable because that isn't the focus of their menu, but the items are still just as creative and yummy. For example, the Lasagna rolls actually taste like lasagna! Their drinks are just as delicious and hit the spot (classic Espresso Martini in the afternoon)! Another menu that I'd like to bring up is their Happy Hour, which is a good size with variety, so I highly recommend going then. 
Something to try that I wasn't able to get was the Funkler (sp?). 
Almost forgot to mention their customer service... It was excellent. Servers and their helpers are nice, some are sociable than most, and they are attentive. Example: They don't wait to clear your table, which was honestly nice 'cause we were ordering in groups, and I like having a clean table. We had a lady genuinely inquire to my first-time experience there too, which was slightly cool.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,2,0,5,AXRfvUpYbneFSjsWQ6fDlA

The hamachi crudo is amazing, as is the Uni crudo and the completely unique and unexpected tuna poke. Lucky Foo's has become a weekly ritual for my family and me, and my 9yr old son loves the lemon roll, the potato chip-wrapped sausages and the chicken wings. Oh! And the Brussel sprouts! Those are his favorite! The miso soup is delicious and the short rib ramen is ridiculously yummy! Although I'm not really a drinker, their hand-crafted and unique cocktails look tempting. I always settle instead for the best green tea I've ever had - served in a french press, atop a rustic wood platter. If you're an edamame fan - try theirs! Lastly, the service has always been great! I have seen the chef greet guests, on occasion, and the sushi chef always has smile on her face. The servers are friendly and informative and I can't wait until they open for lunch so I can try more things and add more meal times to my weekly ritual!

We were promptly seated and greeted by our waitress who took our drink and appetizer order.  Appetizers appeared in a reasonable time but drinks seemed to take quite awhile and showed up after the appetizers had arrived. That was the last time we saw our waitress for the remainder of our dinner, until she showed up with our check, plus a few extra items included we never ordered that were added to the bill.

Positive things, the Foo Dogs were great...not sure I would come back just for these. Decor...pretty cool! We had a variety of items including the Robata and Ramen. Ok, but not great. Again, I really wanted to love this place. Loved the atmosphere and decor, but that would not prompt a return visit. There seemed to be a lot of confusion with food orders as people would show up with food that we never ordered...possibly the reason our check was wrong when our server did finally show up at the end of our meal.

It seems like a bit a training would be helpful as many of the reviews I read after our disappointing meal seem to focus on horrible service.

This place should concentrate on service and add more to the menu to even consider having Restaurant in it's name. The only thing Asian about Foo's are the two semi chefs behind the sushi counter. This looks to be a warm up for the club crowd not a restaurant. Make sure you bring wads of dead presidents, you'll need them. My wife and I drank water, she had sashimi, I had the Hanger Steak. Those were the equivalent of an appetizer so we decided on The Funkler for dessert. From what I read in reviews it was supposed to be pretty good. It was almost stale, maybe a day or two old. Total price with tip $74. I felt ripped off and still hungry! We went on a Saturday night and it was fairly dead & I can see why. I will never go back to this place again. Owners of Lucky Foo's and prospective clients go to Kyara Japanese Tapas off of Jones in Las Vegas and learn about what a Restaurant & Bar with Excellent Service and Food with a Happy Hour is supposed to be like. I am not associated with Kyara's in any way other than being a satisfied customer, every time I go. To be fair it's not all negative they had a martial arts movie playing on their flatscreen but it takes a bit more than playing club tunes (which were too loud) to be called a Restaurant & Bar.

I was in the neighborhood on a Sat in the middle of the day so my friend & I decided to give this place a go since I had it bookmarked for a few months. 

Walking in this place is very nice. Large wooden dolls, inviting outdoor patio that opens right up to the bar area and lots of funky art. Unfortunately nobody was manning the front & it took a few mins for anyone to notice us. Once we were noticed we walked over to a dirty table & stood there while one guy cleaned it off. Wackness #1

Once we sat down I took advantage of my free Yelp check-in offer which was a sake infusion. It was a very light pretty berry color but tasted like rubbing alcohol. Took one sip & didn't come back for more.
Wackness #2

Next we looked over the menu and they offer dinner prices for lunch. Really? A teriyaki salmon bento box for $18 at 1:30pm? 
Wackness #3

Our food ~ this part is extra fun!
I ordered the bento box that came with an over seasoned piece of salmon. Salad with no dressing (I hate getting served just plain lettuce), Greek white rice (yep, this was weird & didn't work), a Cali roll that tasted like it came from the grocery store and guess what? No teriyaki sauce. Even though I ordered teriyaki salmon this place doesn't carry teriyaki sauce. Are you f$@%g kidding me? So they brought me over another sauce that had zero sweetness. My friends ramen looked beautiful but was very salty. My miso tasted like warm water. 
Wackness #4

After paying $40 we are officially not into this place. I've had better ramen & bento boxes for half the price. Just a piece of advice to the person that runs this place - Please get some teriyaki sauce, especially for items that carry it in the title of the dish. Please stop serving Greek rice and most importantly come up with some lunch specials. Your place is beautiful but based on just that I wouldn't be back.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,43,29,2,DL4-7HbnKoTIbg_2stVChw

Came with a friend for their happy hour/AYCE special. When we got in we were seated quickly and the service was great. 2 waitresses greeted us to take our order, and 2 gentlemen made sure our water glasses were NEVER empty. That is THE reason Im going with 3 stars. The service was excellent.

Onto the food... The sushi menu was decent. Maybe roughly 30 rolls? For all you can eat, however, you can pick from about 7 special rolls and 7 classic rolls, some of those only being available 1 per person. 
We ordered a pair of infernos and runnin' rebel rolls. Both of which were fairly bland, short of the cream cheese on the rebel roll. My buddy ordered The Secret Weapon and thought it was alright, as well as a crispy rice delight. I got the spicy salmon and some yellowtail nigiri. The yellowtail tasted a bit off, but what can I really ask for at AYCE?

The kicker here was the price. The happy hour/AYCE price, with the skimpy menu, is $27.95. $30 & change after tax. Comparing this to similar places (but with tastier rolls), the dinner AYCE price should be closer to $22, maybe $25 max. Lunch should be around $19, but I dont think they offer AYCE lunch.

If the AYCE is a sample of the rest of their sushi dishes, I definitely wouldn't come back here to eat.",O7AjVhZWhZx82jHybQDjwQ,1,0,3,X1H4gAL_4rYrkXAnGoD3Kg
1781308,2015-02-09,5,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"$7 Spicy Miso Ramen?* I'm in!
HH menu is pretty dang good, food items for $7 each with good variety, plus beverages for $5. Quantity and quality are both pretty good for the price, save for the sushi rolls which are fairly basic- that price for a California roll isn't really a deal to me.

FOO FOO PLATTER gives you a sample of most of the apps for $15.
WINGS: meh, fall-off-the-bone tender slash overcooked without any flavor.
DUMPLINGS: opt for steamed over fried, vegetarian over pork options available, the dipping sauce is delicious, heavy on the chili oil
SPRING ROLLS: crispy, possibly fresh out of a freezer box, tasty dipping sauce
WON TON CHIPS: not my thing but they did eventually grow on me, very light seasoning is complemented by the green onion dip intended for the wings
FOO DOGS:  skewered kurobuta sausage wrapped in a potato chip is actually pretty dang good! Bummed that I didn't receive either of the dipping sauces mentioned in menu description, though.

But the ramen. That's what I came here for, and that's what I was underwhelmed by. The spicy miso broth was all spice, no miso, very one-note devoid of the richness signature to a great ramen broth. Charred scallion leant an unpleasant burned flavor to the dish, but I did enjoy the mushrooms. The egg was cooked perfectly but the noodles were overdone? Not sure how this was managed.
*Additionally, a double-take at the menu when I left revealed that I was charged full price for the mostly-untouched bowl rather than the HH price. Grrr!

Service was hit or miss. Karen, the sushi chef, was a delight and gave me a sample of their Hamachi with ponzu, jalapeno, and sriarcha- fresh and delicious! Blonde female server was peppy and prompt. But the hostess was out of it, didn't acknowledge me for several minutes and then brought me the wrong menu.

I have been wanting to come try Lucky Foo's for awhile but with a 1 and a half year old who can't stay still and a brand new newborn who hasn't gotten her shots yet makes it for a hard expedition. But anyhow we finally made it here.

The happy hour is awesome because it's everyday and it's from 3pm-6pm. So weather you are off during the week or weekends you can take advantage of their deals. Lucky Foo's has lots of tapas type dishes with mini bites.

My wife and 2 kids came here on a Friday night well more like (5:00pm) and it was not busy at all but it took a while (10 or so minutes) for anyone to acknowledge that we were there. Which kind of suck because when you got young kids and want to do anything you need to make it snappy wam bam thank you bam kind of deal. That the reason for the none full five star rating. Others then that everything else was awesome except for a few minor clothes here and there. Also but when someone did finally greeted us she was very nice and super friendly to my girls....well actually the whole staff was pretty much like that. 

The resturant decor is awesome we've all seen pix of it. They offer indoor and outdoor dining. They even have this cool room towards the back with traditional jap seating style area, I'm not sure if it's for dining or what but the lighting in there is cool and it can be semi closed off. 

Anyhow back to the food. So the happy hour prices are ok and they've picked a handful of populars to put on the menu and the drink deals are good. We order the Charred Shishito peppers (my new favorite thing in the world), the Ebiyaki , Foo dogs (so good), the Robata Grilled Pork Belly (I love pork belly) and the Crispy fire cracker rice Roll (I think that's what's it's called) and an ice cold Asahi and an Old Fashion to go with the meal. 

Everything was mostly off of the HH menu for about $6-$8 and they were all delicious and small portioned. Except for the Ebiyaki. I've never had that before so I don't know what to compare it to but it sounded and looked better then it tasted. I thought it was going to be a lot more crispier but it wasn't and it had a weird mushy filling that wasn't really good so skip that. But the peppers was dresses nicely with a side of awesome sauce. No really the aioli they give with those was amazing. The 3 mini foo dogs wrapped in potato chips was so juicy and tasty and the chip was crispy and thin; awesome. The pork belly was pork belly just really fatty and good. The Crispy firecracker roll was good but lacked in spicy tuna like they promised and the thin jalape√±o was so thin it almost disappeared. As for the rice I mean I Iove crispy just as much as the next guy but the roll was pretty much all crispy rice. But for what it was it was very good. 

Needless to say before we can even order the rest of our meal and drinks the kids were going crazy so we had to pack up and leave with what we had left or haven't eaten. My wife got here beer at the beginning of the service but I never got my Old Fashion (their signature drink) so I'm going have to try it next time to give it a proper review. 

Besides all that I was glad we were able to squeeze a little bit out of our attempt of a night out with 2 little ones. Now we got to come back and try out the other stuff we wanted to eat and drink, and we definitely will be back.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,2,3,4,eeHmUru6YQOAJWdR2Iq26w

Service was excellent, I also liked the ambience and decor. We were here on a Sunday night and they weren't very busy.

We ordered a lot, so our bill was high for two people w/out alcohol ($90) but we like to try a bunch of things.

Highlights:
Lemon roll - California roll with yellowtail, salmon and thinly sliced lemon on top (fresh tasting, really good, our favorite dish so far)

Foo Dogs - mini kurobota sausages wrapped in potato and deep fried (also very good, could've eaten 10 of them, bummer it's only 3 per order)

Short rib ramen - short rib was tender, broth was excellent, texture of the noodles was more like soba, but I still enjoyed it 

Short rib steamed buns - again, short rib was tender, great flavor, bun was steamed perfectly, only complaint was too much parsley

Pork belly skewers - good flavor but very fatty, even less meat than what you normally find in pork belly

Chicken fried rice - loved the crispy bacon on top, loved the Kim chee, but there was a sweet flavor that I didn't like (personal preference)

Chicken wings - will pass on these next time, nothing really special about them and they're really large (for wings) and came out piping hot so really hard to eat/handle",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,3,2,4,t7mCRAQfMqzRNOnWwR8VDw
2013789,2016-02-21,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"I have been coming to enjoy the magical deliciousness for a little over a year now. Let's first review the ambiance, it is very chill with great music and beautifully decorative walls by different artists. My favorite is the ""wall of doll's"" miniature geisha doll display that I always want to take when I walk by because they are so cute.!! Everyone is quick to make you feel welcome. Although I have had service with many servers Amy is Amazing.!! She is friendly & checks in to your every need. She offered her expertise on the style of drinks to try and makes suggestions to the menu.She delivers A++ service to her customers and makes you feel very welcome. Let's talk ""FOO'D"" ;) My new obsession is the Lasagna Roll, second the Lemon Roll. The freshness of the lemon zest Lemon roll leaves your tongue wanting more.!!! A must have when you come over.! I love the ebiyaki- they are scrumptious (deep fried shrimp battered balls with red ginger, creamy kosho aoli). I get them almost every visit. They offer many beer and wine, sake and unique cocktails to choose from. I suggest the brussels and shisito peppers to have as a yummy appetizer. Although I did not have it this time, if you love chocolate then you must try The Funkler.... Chocolate chip blondie with vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate sauce drizzle. Wow.! It is my FAVE.!!! They also have the huge fortune cookie dessert you should try. I have been in love with the food here for the past year and have brought many friends and family to experience Lucky Foo's. It is in my top 5 local hot spot as a Vegas native. My next time is Taco Tuesday and Sunday Brunch.",M-E7_NatXfxNiQeFy8V4pQ,2,0,5,Pr10GF-YtWUYxB3bjBR9EA

I was a customer twice back in the Extreme Sushi days and that was enough to last me a lifetime. Lucky Foo's is such an upgrade and an awesome new addition to this center. I really love what they did with the place. So much better than before! If you haven't been yet, you should check it out. 

Already they were off to a great start with the major improvement in the atmosphere. Then we ordered and WOW, their menu blew me away too. So many interesting dishes and drinks to choose from. I can't wait to go back and try more! Everything we ordered was great but a few favorites were the Pork Belly Yakitori and the Charred Edamame. That Pork Belly just melts in your mouth. You must try that! I also loved the fact that they had so many choices for Sake. I ordered the House Infused Apple Sake and it was so good that I ordered another. Also worth mentioning... the Caterpillar Roll and Philadelphia Roll but I prefer to recommend things that are unique because you can order these items at any sushi bar. I'll try more of their menu and update this review after I have a few more visits under my belt but for now I was way impressed. 
They even have this cool app called Rockbot that you can download to choose what music they play. I had fun with that. 

As an extra bonus, there was a familiar face there. Much to my pleasant surprise I was able to locate a chef that I had lost track of named Koong. She's a chick whose sushi game is on point! Now I already know this restaurant knows what's up since they hired her to work here. No wonder I loved my food!

In closing, I will definitely be back since now it's my mission to become the duchess of Lucky Foo's by getting the most checkins. Excited about my next visit! It's nice to have that feeling after visiting a restaurant for the first time. I need to explore more of their decor since I'm studying interior design. The visual stimulus here was off the chart! I was invited to check out the other rooms but we didn't have time this visit.

There are fun wooden dolls that provide a unique look and feel you would expect if this place was in a casino. The host person and staff were friendly and professional. Menu navigation was easy for dinner and shared plates with a small group is the way to go. 

Start off with their apps and try the Lucky Rice. While the prices seem gourmet level, the quality and presentation definitely support it. We also had the Thai beef salad, short rib steamed buns (delicious!), foo dogs, yakitori, and a number of sushi rolls. Many of the dishes are a bit spicy, with various usage of chili and jalape√±os.

When ordering, they were out of a few items, which was a bummer. Once we got our food, it was very flavorful; however, the bacon wrapped skewers were very undercooked. My friend pushed them aside, the server noticed and replaced them. I then received my pork belly steam buns, also undercooked. I ate them anyways, but didn't feel so hot the next day.

The service was top notch.  Our food came out promptly and the servers checked up on us frequently but not over the top.  Needless to say our drinks never went empty. 

We started with the wings which came out pretty quickly. Had a nice tangy bbq kick to it. 

My wife had the Foo Burger.  She said it reminded her of Bachi burger but slightly better which speaks volumes because it's one of our favorite spots. 

I'm not much of ramen fan but I'm sold on anything with Pork Belly so  figured I'd give the Pork Belly ramen a try.  I was pleasantly surprised and will look forward trying the other noodle dishes.

Drinks: Hibiscus Martini - for someone that like things sweet. Moscow Mule - Love that it is served in a copper cup and was very refreshing.

2970787,2015-02-01,21,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"I came for the ramen and stayed for the, ""Funkler"". 

I had to visit Lucky Foo's twice, back to back, in order to verify my five star review. This place is firing on all cylinders, the food is fresh, imaginative, and completely over the top. It's like a shroomed-out unicorn, who moonlights as a chef, is in the back spewing out rainbow infused foodie ideas. Not weird at all. 

During my visit I ordered a little bit of everything. Spicy Miso Ramen with Short Rib, Forbidden Black Rice, Chicken Teriyaki skewers, Charred Shishito Peppers, and the Funkler. 

First off, no I haven't exploded, but I would have kept eating if I didn't have other things to do, like fall into a food coma. I started off with the charred shishto peppers. These were a simple yet elegant way to start the cavalcade of food coming my way. Charred to perfection, with small bite of heat. They were paired with a creamy kosho sauce sort of like a creamy hummus - not the flavor, but the texture. Amazing pairing, awesome way to fire up the palate. 

The Miso Ramen with Short Ribs was swimming in one of the best ramen broths I've had in a while. It was so rich and flavorful that it should be served in one of those children's bowls with a straw attached. The short ribs were so tender that they almost melted when pinched between my wooden eating utensils. The sexy mix of texture in the ramen along with the eggs, nori, charred greens, and bamboo shoots is something that only exists on TV... Padma, I'm looking at you.

The Robata Skewers are simple, but delicious. Slow cooked chicken with house cured salts. A great treat for the timid taster. These were very good, but we're overshadowed by the rest of the food on the table. I still suggest trying these, they also have steak and pork belly skewers. 

Forbidden Black Rice. That's right... Forbidden Rice! This is something that Indiana Jones might go looking for in the Temple of Doom. Black Rice, seasoned with house made cured salt, enhanced with avocado, kabocha squash, red onion jam, cotija cheese, cilantro, and haricot vert (french for green beans). This veggie dish could convert any diehard carnivore to the dark side of the meat free force. I highly recommend this dish to everyone - The layers of this will please even the snobbiest and jaded of palates. The first bite will throw you off, it's crunchy, it's smooth, it's chewy, salty, and spiced. Like I said a shroomed-out unicorn came up with this meal. The cotija cheese is great addition to the meal pushing the salt flavor right up to the edge, while the medium boiled egg weirdly brings everything together.  

I wrapped everything up with a dessert item, that feels out of place on this menu. I blame it on that damn Unicorn! The, ""Funkler"" is ginger ice cream, a chocolate chip blondie, coconut sauce drizzle, and some crunchu sugary insanity. This is the type of dish, that as soon as you see it, you want say out loud, ""Oh... fuck me"", and I did. 

A hard five stars, the food, the service, ambience, and the sake. This place is on point, now if I could only find out where they keep that damn shroomed-out unicorn.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,24,16,5,qmgC_5lz0xlvthQYBzri3g

We also ordered, Pork Buns, Foo Dog and Beef/Onion Skewers. Everything came out sub par. I was expecting the pork buns to be good, but the bun came out cold. From my past experience, you would expect the buns to be served warm. We also ordered Foo Dogs, it is essentially, a hot dog wrapped up. In all honesty, this dish could be easily made at home in 2 seconds. 

The beef skewers came out really late, about 40 minutes after we got all our other food. My husband also had to ask 3-4 times to refill his water & drink. 

Other than the food, the ambiance was comfy and cozy. That was the only positive of the restaurant. Overall, there are other better restuarant to try. I do not plan on coming back.",hxNPDc02kWm_eIW1NmozJw,3,1,2,r1N3rhbv2UlfWiu_5-kPng

We saw him throughout the night helping others but he never came back to our table till he handed us the check. Instead, the poor busser ended up taking our orders as well as a bartender.

Our server was all smiles but walked away from our table twice while I was mid sentence. (btw they never came back to check on us...oh well not a huge deal).
I asked pretty direct questions about a particular dish and was given the wrong item. It took awhile to get the server back to correct it while my co worker was eating her lunch. When the server finally came by (after some hand waving across the room) the response was: ""Oh I misunderstood you"". Again not a big deal but I asked two pretty direct questions about this particular item and don't know how a totally wrong dish was served. My guess It was put into the computer wrong. 
Took about 15 mins to get my correct order while my co worker was done eating. Again not something horrible but this was during my lunch break from work and I found this was mildly annoying. We were never checked on during our lunch. Not once. 
We both got ramen dishes and both felt the noodles were al dente to the point of being under cooked. The broth was extremely salty without much flavor.
No surprise I had to wave down our server to get the check. This place it somewhat of a chore to eat lunch at despite being mostly empty.
Two bowls of slightly below average ramen, one water and one tea with very spotty service for $30. I don't think Ill come back anytime soon.",VOkQcsuyQzUeQxFBsQo91Q,2,0,2,_EBANT3OdILnl0BhliQBew
3087728,2015-01-09,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Okay first off let's talk about cultural confusion. Lucky Foos? Sounds Chinese to me.. But overall definitely not Japanese. I know this place serves a variety of Asian foods but sushi is prominent on the menu and is Japanese. This is the main reason I didn't initially go here. But eventually I went. Cute place, nice decor. Waitress tells me this is an Izakaya which I am more than familiar with (japanese). And also goes on to tell me not to pour my own sake which.. I also knew but whatever. It's not a cultural lesson, right? 

First thing that came out was yakitori. Flavor was not so good but edible. Next we had ""dumplings"" which actually were luke warm gyoza. The crispy rice and lemon roll were both really awesome. Then we had the ebiyaki which was also really good. The only inedible part of the meal was the chicken wings. It was like two gigantic bird wings that you had to break apart with your hands to dip in the sauce and I felt so barbaric I couldn't finish it. 

Overall this place has a lot of potential, but needs to refine the small menu that they have. I've been to much better Izakayas in chinatown so that's my baseline and this place isn't up to snuff",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,2,1,3,fH_CrVeZd7S-O8rVsBjE7Q

The restaurant is located on Eastern Avenue right by 215 which means that it is very easy to get there. Parking will also be easy. There are plenty of spots around the restaurant and it was never overly busy both times I was there.

Service is very good and so is the food. Make sure to try some of their sushi and the Funkler for dessert as I feel like this is one of their specialties. Good thing to know about this place is that they offer an AYCE option as well as a happy hour everyday from 3-6 pm.

Service started with high hopes of and enjoyable evening however after ordering our hopes were diminished. Arrived at 5:30p but we're not able to leave till almost 8pm because there was no service. We started with drinks then some happy hour appetizers and small entrees; which the food was good. After that we did not see anyone for almost 40min. Finally someone noticed us, because our server was no where to be found and she asked if we wanted dessert. We ordered our dessert and wanted to have some coffee with it. When our dessert arrived we were informed that they did not have coffee but only espresso and that they only did coffee on the weekends for brunch. We were disappointed but took the espresso. No cream or sugar was ever offered with the espresso and no one ever came back to our table after that. We waited another 15min for our check before we got up from the table and walk to the front, where there was also no one to attend to us. We finally waited in the middle of the front dining room and flagged down our server and informed her that we would like to pay; as we were about to just walk out; no one would have even noticed if we did. Once the server  finally stopped for us, she said ""oh sorry, we have a large group in the other room we are all working on."" I don't care, I just want to pay and leave at this point; my money ($75 check) is just as good as anyone else's money. The server never even came back to get the check for us, I just left it on a random table as we walked out.

3577411,2015-05-11,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Three visits in the past two weeks has given me a pretty good handle on Lucky Foo's (though all have been for lunch and brunch).  Here's the skinny:

FOOD: Everything I've tasted so far has been spot-on . . . sushi is very fresh, simple, ""clean"" and well prepared.  Haven't seen anything smothered in spicy mayonnaise yet so that's a plus!  Gravlax at brunch were great . . . served with crispy potato pancakes (latkes) and a nice dill flavored sour cream and assorted garnish.  I absolutely LOVE the signature Forbidden Black Rice Bowl . . . like to see some more variations of this.  I'd also recommend the ""Taco Tuesday"" menu . . . fun stuff for all.  Gonna' try some noodles on my next visit.

BEVERAGE: Plenty of interesting cocktails (14) and lots of beer (16) and sake (14) options.  Wine List is modest (23 selections) but pricing is fair and reasonable.  ""Bottomless Mimosas"" at Sunday Brunch for $18 a person along with ""Build Your Own Bloody Mary"" are both winners.

SERVICE: Staff is VERY friendly, accommodating and personable . . . they've obviously been well trained but you can tell right away that they ""get"" hospitality all the way around.  Great phone greeting on all my calls and prompt and attentive service by hostess' (Candace & Stephanie).

ROOM: Lots of options (which I like) . . . decent sized patio with comfy tables and chairs, indoor/outdoor sushi bar, booths and tables in the main room, more booths and tables in the bar area along with a more intimate private dining room that also has several tables and booths.  Lots of direct sunlight but also plenty of intimate spots . . . music ranges from classic rock to contemporary soul and dance music.  All very tasteful and comfortable.

VALUE: Considering the quality of the food, the service and ambiance, I'd say the Lucky Foo's offers and exceptional value by Las Vegas (or Henderson) standards . . . easy to have a nice lunch for two for $50 (with tip).  Our Sunday Brunch, with the Bottomless Mimosas for two was $90 (with tip).  Hard to imagine ANYONE in Vegas offering a better value than Luckys!",AOLRNwbqxnhve0hs82cd7Q,3,2,5,ocYMa8DNxLCw0utoKOX1Wg

My thoughts on the food will come but first lets discuss service...drum roll please....

The service was bad. With just about 4 or 5 tables sat in house Id think it would be better. Just for 1 sushi roll to come out it took about 30 minutes. When we asked where our food was the server simply said ""were so busy im sorry were behind"" 

Busy? OK. Lol I know what a busy restaurant looks like and it sure wasnt that.

Ok now on to the food. Ordered: 

Lucky rice, fried rice with chicken and a fried egg on top. Mind you usually anything with an egg on it is da bizness. And this rice sure was, so much I ordered 2.

Edamame, its charred, its good, its..edamame.

Eel cucumber, it was definitely fresh tasting I liked this one a lot

Eel avocado was good

Spicy tuna was too spicy, you can pretty much taste the chili powder since it had so much on it, all it needs is a hint. Its not chili powder with tuna

Lasagna roll, this was another hitfor me. But it does have cream cheese so those that dont like it wont like this. But this is also the roll that took about 30 min to get. I can imagine on a actual busy night how long it would take.

To begin with, let me talk about the service. If it was an instagram post, it would just say:

#slow #stupid #shameful

Our waitress seemed like she had no clue what she was doing. And not because  she was new...she just seemed clueless. This did result in an incorrect order and her not being able to answer any of the questions we had for her. We did ask her for recommendations, but we got a simple ""Everything is good"" answer. (When I ask your opinion, please don't give me a canned answer. I ask for a reason: because I want a real, honest answer.)

Secondly, the food: It was okay. In my opinion, for food supposed to be in possession of ""Asian flair"", this stuff was a little on the boring side of things. At least that's what my taste buds registered. I'm hoping we just caught the chef on an off night with an empty spice rack.

Finally, the prices. They weren't bad, they weren't good. They were just fair. Had the food been what I would consider ""good"" rather than just ""meh"", the prices would seem even better.

Would I come back here? I would consider revisiting if they shake things up a little.
Would I recommend to others? Yes, because I don't want my opinion to necessarily convince someone to not go to this place. You might like it. I would just recommend you not going with super high hopes for a fantastic meal.",wt57fkTOcSCYNb2fNAOlyg,8,3,2,fqtH7KoewIMaO1gqzp06YQ

The entire restaurant reeks like a deep fryer (and so did we when we left).  There is a large open air bar between the patio and the sushi bar, and even that open wall did not help the thick smell that permeated the air.

Against better judgment we stayed because the reviews looked good.  Our CM gives this place 5 stars, so how bad could it be, right?  Well, the answer was: Terrible!  

We ordered chicken wings to start.  Our server asked if we wanted them out first, otherwise items would just come out as they were ready.  We advised that we'd like them first, as an appetizer.  Then ordered the Short rib ramen and the Thai beef salad for entr√©es.  Our wings never came.  After our entr√©es arrived and we found our server, we asked about the wings.  She said they should start making them now.  We asked to cancel them since they were supposed to come out prior to the other items.  She didn't want to cancel the wings for us so we spoke with the manager and asked her to do so.  After talking to the server and the kitchen, she agreed and advised that the 'ticket had been skipped'.  That does not seem like a valid excuse when the restaurant is empty.  It's not like orders were piling up.  In any case, it should not have taken that much effort to cancel an order.  Horrible customer service.

Now to the food we did eat.  I am sad to say that we found this to be terrible as well. Definitely very overpriced.  The ramen broth was a bit like fishy dish water, the limited amount of noodles in the bowl were generic, and the short rib almost see through the slices were so thin.

The salad was a joke.  I had asked if it was large enough for an entr√©e and was told that it was.  And at over $13, you'd assume so. There were 4 tiny pieces of hanger steak, no salad lettuce, just a bed of watercress with mint & cilantro, a few thin strips of papaya or mango, and grapefruit that was sour (possibly pickled?).  The steak itself was good, but there was not much of it and the rest was more of a garnish than a salad.

Sadly, I don't see a reason to return to this establishment.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,11,4,1,4Hg_88ZZKhq6OxxrmOjdfQ

3883251,2015-07-12,1,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Food was just ok and our service was a new personal worst :( 
We ate here about 3 weeks ago after the lunch rush, there were only a few tables left so a few servers were just stranding around chatting. we got sat within a few moments and a I gave our server my phone coupon from yelp with  free sake for checking and her ok'd and walked away. he came back a few minutes later with a free cold sake for me. I kind of would have like to order a water and ask a few questions.... but I guess it was good to get it out of the way? We had a few simple Q.'s about the menu and the server either didn't know the answer or was annoyed we asked- he gave us vague answers which made us have more questions. I think He was only working lunch and was not happy that he got sat another table, and it showed. 
Our food came, wrong... or not what he told us it would be- because he answered our menu questions with little effort and no information. So we had him get us what we thought we were ordering in the first place. 15 minutes later a new server came to bring us the food with a half smile trying to help correct the mood from the previous server and wrong food. 
Well the food was wrong, again but whatever we ate. Food was decent- nothing that great- nit hey they are pretty inexpensive. All the while no one filled up our water which is one of my biggest pet peeves. we had our empty glasses at the edge of the table trying to get their attention but they just did not realize them there and then I finally asked for more water and she came and took my glass to refill and left my fiances empty glass on the table? by the time she came back with my water we were ready to go- so we just asked for the check- paid in cash (still leaving 17% because I am a bartender and will never not leave a tip) and we left.

The service was absolutely horrendous. Waiter came over took our order and never saw him again. It was Monday night at 9, with only maybe 6 tables with customers.. Who were all ordering sushi and 1 sushi chef.. You do the math.

We ordered the charred edamame, spicy miso and 3 rolls. The food runner maybe was new? and delivered our edamame to a different table, which they sent back cause they didn't order it....then he came out with a miso ramen which again delivered to a different table, I had to flag him down to tell him it was ours, at that point I then told him that the edamame was also ours. It took 30 minutes just to get the edamame, 45 mins later still no sushi rolls, finally 2 came and then we waited longer for the 3rd which the food runner then delivered AGAIN to a different table. Which they took and ate, of course, probably cause they were starving like everyone else was that was waiting for sushi. We told the waiter and he seemed like he could care less so we got the bill and left. Was not going to wait another 30 minutes for another roll which we probably wouldn't have received anyways.",4L-7S_jmVAuj6G3IETi_8A,6,2,2,J2VEHLyZq1ntyQnbnYjaHQ

3902035,2015-02-08,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"After reading the other reviews we had high hopes for this restaurant.  It does have potential, but they disappointed on many levels for us.  The restaurant is cool looking and has a hip vibe.  They seemed very distracted with moving tables and setting up for a DJ when we arrived for our 7 PM reservation on Saturday night.  Our table was not ready they said and had us wait at the bar.  I thought this was odd as I saw empty tables that appeared to be available.  They did give us some free Apple Sake, which was  nice of them.  We noticed they had boxes and cleaning spray bottles on the counter where they sat us which we found as not appropriate.  I think you should be set up and  better prepared by 7 pm on a Saturday.  After we got seated, they continued to move tables and chairs all around us, which was distracting.  Our waitress was nice and professional, but seemed a little distracted also.  We ordered several things, and none of them really wowed us.  The chicken robata was very, very salty, almost sent it back it was so bad.  The other food was good, but again nothing special.  The highlight of the meal was the dessert, which was the Snowball.  A delicious ball of chocolate and marshmallow that was fun and tasty.  I can see this place has potential.  The menu is unique and fun, and the place has a cool vibe.  They just need to focus on execution and service.  For example, we had to ask for water three times and utensils and plates on more than on occasion.  When you serve fished like fried rice to share,m you need a spoon and plates also.  They seem to be working some kinks out as they are still a new restaurant.  We may try them in a few months after they get their service in place better.          One other thing, the main entrance is on the side and not easy to see from the parking lot.  We saw many people enter from the patio entrance which faces the parking lot and then they looked confused as to where to go.  They need to make that more clear to people as to where the entrance is.",sMYBBpTUfqYk5qkw5qKjpg,2,1,2,LD_ZoPRdL54wFZVrifdTgg

3971001,2015-06-16,10,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"I came here for Restaurant Week.  There was no special menu for RW.  Rather, the RW menu was a choice of existing items.  When added up, the cost from the menu was $2 less if you ordered √† la carte than the price they charged for their RW menu.  Their $4 contribution per RW order then is half paid by the customer.  Tacky, but it's OK.  It was not OK to be on the RW page for weeks and not yet have any menus available.  Instead, I was brought a tablet with the menu from the HelpOutDineOut website.  

For the three courses, I ordered the charred shishito peppers, the forbidden black rice, and the funkler.  There was one other party in the restaurant when I got there at 5 and it took ten minutes to find out they had no RW menus, show me the tablet, order, and get an iced tea.

The food was hit and miss.  I liked the shishito peppers.  Charred very nicely, they were quite flavorful and as with most peppers, they varied with their heat.  The accompanying aioli really didn't have much flavor.  I think it was there to help cool some patrons' palates who might find the peppers too spicy.  Next came the forbidden black rice.  It was a nice mixture with the star being the kobacha squash.  I could discern none of the promised mint, cilantro, or Thai basil.  I was about 2/3 of the way through my rice when a server committed what I consider the ultimate serving error.  My dessert, the funkler--a  warm blondie with ice cream--was placed on the bar next to my bowl of unfinished rice.  Didn't anyone watch to see when I was done or did someone just decide to send out dessert when they decided it was the right time.

At that point, I raised the bowl of rice, tipped it toward me, and started pushing the rice from the bowl with my chopsticks.  I should have told him to take it back becasue I wasn't ready but I opted to finish and cut my losses.

The blondie was poor.  It was very hard and very dry.  I had to push very firmly with my fork to break through the blondie.  I should have let the ice cream melt over it and soften it a bit.  I don't know how long it had been sitting around but it was obviously too long.  What a disappointment--in service and execution.

During my meal, I was asked if I wanted more iced tea.  After 5 minutes, the person looked over and snapped his finger as he realized he'd forgotten the tea.  This was indicative of the service during my visit.  No one seemed to know what they were doing.  The dessert error, though, was the most fundamental error any restaurant can commit.  It just should never be done!   Lucky Foo's needs to address their service issues.  They are not training their people or they just don't care.

I paid my bill and left, sorry that I had chosen Lucky Foo's to begin my Restaurant Week dinners.  What a disappointment!!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,20,10,2,rOoWBMk3057N2gAF0eiFew

First, we came in around 3:30 on a Sunday and the service was not great. Halfway though an Asian chick took over our table and she was really nice so I'll let that go. 

We ordered the spicy tuna roll, mariachi roll, pork belly ramen, sashimi salad and our kids had the fried rice and chicken finger bento box. The ramen was so bland and disappointing, it looked really pretty and we had high hopes. There was no real flavor, and what we did taste was just off. The spicy tuna roll was nothing special. The mariachi roll sounded so good but all we could taste was the sweet onion in it. It didn't taste anything like cilantro, salmon, salsa or any of the elements that were in the menu description. The sashimi salad was soooo bland as well. Just like eating basic lettuce with a hint of lemon.

When we walked in, we were greeted very warmly by 2 women who gave us a 5--10 minute waiting period. I definitely felt that ""new restaurant"" vibe because we were asked by about 3 different people if we'd be helped/assisted/ordered yet. Which is fine, you could just tell they wanted to impress :-)

I don't why, but the thought fusion food turns me off. That makes no sense cuz I'm a very eclectic person! I was a little wary to eat there at first, but I ordered the chicken katsu and waffles. The katsu had a...different flavor that maybe I'm not used to since I'm so familiar with Aloha Kitchen's katsu. The waffle was delicious though and the plate was presented very nicely. My mom though. She got the Forbidden Black Rice bowl!?!!!!! 

That mess was amazing! So good that I went back 2 days later just to order it. I've never had black rice before and all the flavors they combined are so complementary of each other. It's a bit pricey for how much food you get, but asking around, I heard that black rice is fairly exclusive and all the ingredients were probably similar. 

The manager (Michael, I believe) approached our table to ask about our meal and hooked my dad up with a card and a coupon. Our server Sandee was really friendly and well versed on the menu. $50 for a flavorful Mother's Day brunch is not bad at all.

I'll be back for that black rice bowl and probably some other things.",ROsAs833CTExJfWotUyY9Q,2,1,4,ib_0g4y9lC4VHOpsugwY0w

My first experience was pretty good, and I thought that this time it would be even better. 
Sitting there and just kind of relaxing a little made me realize what kind of place this is. 
First off I went in with my 2 sons. They don't eat like kids, they've eaten just about everywhere and get how things are supposed to go. I ordered shishito peppers, lemon roll, and pork belly skewers for appetizer. My youngest son got the short rib ramen, my oldest wasn't that hungry so ordered a Hawaiian roll, and I ordered forbidden rice bowl. The server looked flustered when I ordered the food and said I'd like this for an appetizer and that for a dinner. She says with exasperation in her voice ""the food comes out as its ready"". Oh. Alright I say thinking it should be ok. Well, how is it that almost everything came out in different a different order. My oldest son was left sitting there with no food for quite awhile after both my youngest and me were finally served. Lol, and then an appetizer comes out 5 minutes into our dinner. I noticed at a table close to us that a different server was explaining the same ""food comes out as its ready"" to a party of 4 senior citizens. She was rolling her eyes and sounded very annoyed. The crazy thing is they were just ordering. It's not like they were complaining they were just asking questions that were pretty basic. 
Forbidden rice. Pretty. Basic and bland tasting, but very pretty. Rolls were good. Shishito peppers were fine...they were as good as the ones I made last week. Short rib ramen was ok. Last time I went I guess I was just in a good mood. 
If you're going to label the menu with a starters category then you should make them starters. The place looks cool, and some of their food is tasty, but I'd like some steak to go with my sizzle.",JtdQVsiKWRrghAPepxjYQg,1,0,2,n1yzDmO4_7iFM9nuNiI3jg

Cool pop art all over the place, vivid colors.  We were promptly greeted, and given a menu to look at while we waited for a table.  The menu had lots of cool looking fusion items on it, and I was so excited.  So we settled on the Hawaiian roll, the fennel role, short rib ramen, and the chicken fried rice.

  First thing that came was the ramen, it was 12 dollars and about a 3 rd the size of what I would get at monta.  The meat at least was tender, good cook on the egg, and the broth had good flavor although a bit too salty. They did give us two extra bowls since we were sharing, which I appriciated.  Then the fennel roll came out, the rice was so sticky and the peices stuck together.  It was also bland.  Kinda tasted like tuna salad.   The Hawaii roll came out and it tasted like a bland California roll with some mango on it.  These rolls were around 14 dollars. Way to much money for poorly executed rolls.  Then finally the fried rice, way to wet and not harmonious at all.  Just to many things happening without any balance.

4382452,2015-08-13,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"I've been hearing good things about this restaurant for awhile now. I finally gave it a try for dinner and was not disappointed. The regular menu offers an interesting variety of food items. 

I started with Stellar Chips because they sounded unique. They were so good. For a fried wonton it was fairly light and not greasy. Think Asian tortilla chip. The dip that came with it was delicious as well. 

The Short Rib Ramen immediately caught my attention for my meal. Every item in the bowl was perfectly prepared. The egg was cooked to the point that the yolk was almost set, but was still creamy without being running. The short rib was very flavorful and I could have eaten at least twice as much. The other flavors blended so well including the bamboo shoots, nori, onions, and perfectly salted broth. The entree portion was the perfect amount of food for me and reasonable for the price.

I finished up with The Funkler which is a chocolate chip cookie/brownie with ice cream on the top. It came with a cup of chocolate in case you don't already have enough. The portion on this was huge. I wouldn't recommend getting this for one person. It was very rich and bold on chocolate flavor. I absolutely loved the flavor, but it became rich fast.

The service was mixed. When I arrived the hostess greeted me quickly and gave me options in seating. Other employees greeted me as we walked to my seat. Then I sat at the bar and was the only person at the bar because I was there at an off time. The bartender managed to say less than a dozen words to me the whole time I was there even though I was his only customer. The girl that was bringing out the food was very friendly and made nice conversation with me. 

While I was there I noticed that they do special nights like Tacos and Tequila as well as Sunday brunch. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other items that caught my eye.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,0,4,KOiAcdhHLEOEoR86tfxlZw

Now on to the food! My bae and I split the stellar nachos as an app. The wonton chips were crispy and fresh, the sauce to dip in was fantastic and there was a generous amount of ahi tuna. For an entree I had the rib eye ramen. I really enjoyed the flavor of the meat and the broth. My boo opted for the one and only foo burger which looked delicious. He let me steal a few of his fries which were cooked perfectly and I really liked the spicy ketchup to dip in.

Can't forget about the drinks either! They have tons of specialty cocktails and beers but I opted for the fruit infused sake. It was served in an adorable bamboo style carafe and I believe the flavor I had was grapefruit and mint. It was very unique and refreshing oh and half off for HH.

Honestly I can't get enough of this place. I'm sure I'll be back again soon & can only keep my fingers crossed for a southwest expansion location.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,32,22,5,w7Hy16K0VK4a2sRSC3rbBQ

4615551,2015-09-09,1,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"It really is too bad I discovered Lucky Foo's after I moved out of Las Vegas, otherwise I would undoubtedly become a regular. I adore everything about this place, from the lovely decor with the beautiful dolls to their friendly management and staff. 

First thing I noticed and found very impressive was their beverage program. Usually when I walk into an Asian restaurant, I do not have the highest expectations on the alcohol selection, so I was quick to assume I'll end up ordering an Asahi or whatever typical product every other Americanized Japanese restaurant carries. Lucky Foo's, however, had an extensive spirits display, craft beer, craft cocktails with house made syrups, premium sake, and even a carbonated sake I had never heard of on tap. It is refreshing to see an establishment outside of New York City that actually cares to carry uncommon, better quality products that people aren't familiar with. To those of you who are less adventurous, don't fret because they do carry Asahi, Sapporo, Stella Artois, etc. on top of the good stuff ;)

Their food menu has something for whatever craving you may have. Let's say your friends aren't really in the mood for Asian cuisine but you really want that bowl of ramen. Bring them here and they won't be disappointed in their panko crusted chicken sandwich or a make-your-own burger, all the while you can enjoy their pork belly, short rib, or miso ramen (if you're anything like me, ask for it spicy because they have thai chilis). 

Go during happy hour 3pm-6pm for great deals on some of their rolls and appetizers, including the yakitori (pork belly is a must), and of course $3 off their specialty craft cocktails such as the Crouching Tiger, which I'm told is a staff favorite. 

Overall, service is fantastic, food and drinks are great, and the prices are extremely reasonable. The ambience is suitable for pretty much any occasion - a casual lunch, a celebratory dinner, brunch with friends or even a romantic date. I highly recommend this place to anyone in Vegas looking for a more original Asian fusion establishment that's not like all the rest.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,2,1,5,pJBJpr-xra09iVJSf_5j3Q

The location is freeway close  right off of the Eastern/215 exit. I really like that (for a quick getaway?). Also, you can ""customize"" your experience by choosing to dine/lounge/play in a different room each time you come over.

 Patio?  Check!  Sushi bar?  Check!  Tatami room with fun mats and a giant futon for your lounging pleasure? Check!  Happy hour?  Check!  Wi-Fi?  Check!  An interactive dj app that allows you to control what music you hear next?  Yeah, this place is definitely for the hip and fun crowd.

When I first arrived, I was amazed on the nice Asian zen decor and such a spacious place. Service was on point, however, food was not. 

Food:

1. Lucky rice(1/5): This is the dish I was excited to try since everyone was raving about it. This dish has kimchi, bacon, chicken and fried eggs. It was really really salty. I had to drink a sip of water each time I had a bite. The flavor was not bad but it was way too salty and has too much sauce. For $7, I didn't really see much chicken in there. 

2. Spicy salmon roll (3/5): I know better not to order sushi in fusion restaurant but my friend wanted a roll. It was mediocre and plain. 

3. Shrimp with jalape√±o bacon robata skewer (3/5): it wasn't too bad but they used too much sauce when bacon was already salty. 

4. Mushroom mazemen (3.5/5): this dish has mushroom, pea spouts, Parmesan cheese  and noodle. It has all my favorite ingredients and it was not salty thank god! This ended up being the favorite of ours for that night but it was not that great either.

Overall dining experience was underwhelmed. Although it's a nice place to hangout and grab a drink, I doubt I will be retuning anytime soon for the food.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,4,4,3,PTu0bwtLnOyjFfB8IBI73g

This place is going to be a solid four star in the future.  I have been here twice now in the past week and I really like the food.  To have a tapas, asian fusion place in Henderson is pretty cool and with all the cool cats hanging out at the LVAC, I am sure this place will be a ""go-to"" restaurant in the future!

1.  Location - 3 star - This is at the 215 and Eastern on the NorthWest corner.  Near the LVAC and in the place that was formerly Xtreme Sushi and Steak.  Very similar upscale and funky interior with a great exterior patio seating.  It was almost warm enough to attempt to sit outside, however we were ill prepared.  There are a variety of tables, booths and plenty of sizing for large or small groups. Love the location, but it is difficult to get to at times due to all the traffic and all.  However, if you can navigate here, you will do well.

2  Ambiance - 4 star - As mentioned, plenty of tables and booths.  A small cool bar in the middle as well as a small sushi bar off to the side.  In my two times here, I did not see people really hanging out at either bar, yet when this place get's busier and it will, I am sure it will be hopping. 

3.  Food - 5 star - The food here is definitely very good, and we have tried so far many of the dishes. 

Lucky Rice - Some concoction of sticky rice perfectly flavored with kim chee, fried egg and bacon.  We added the pork belly option and this is a dish that you will keep on eating and eating.  Tasty and addicting.  The only problem with this dish is slowing down a bit to taste it.  The texture, flavor and taste is just about perfect.  This is something we will eat every time.  We had both the regular Lucky Rice with all the meat and one vegetarian one without meat as it is Lent....

Lettuce Wraps - They have both the vegetarian and one with chicken.  We ordered the vegetarian and it was great, when we did get it.  It had Mushroom, Daikon, Eggplant and Carrots.  Great flavor and of course fun to eat in the little lettuce wraps that they give to you.

Shishito Peppers - These were cooked to perfection.  Nice taste, not spicy, just a hint of pepper.  More vegetable but cooked to a nice crispy and charred texture.  Made this so flavorful and mouth watering. Yes, you have to enjoy veggies to like this, and I have had Shishito Peppers at many places and enjoyed it here so much!

For the RobataYaki, we had Chicken and Scallion,  Kabocha Squash, and Maitake Mushrooms  These were all very good, tasty, and served on little platters with the skewered delicacies!

Fries - Yes, we ordered something as dopey as fries.  It was a Friday, most of us were on ""Lent"" so no meat. We were hungry, and heck the fries looked good.  You know what, as odd as it seems, and I am an Asian Foodie, I really enjoyed the fries and I normally never order fries or eat them!

The Dessert - The Funkler and the SnowBall - Wow, we were about to leave and I was actually yelping for a good dessert place and was about to go to Snowball Shavery all the way in C-Town.  I had a guest here from New York, so we were on an excursion of food before her flight back to the Big Apple that night.  We were about to pay and then one of the other waiters asked us about dessert and we said....What the Heck!

The Funkler - A Chocolate chip Blondie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The size of a huge slice of pie, we devoured it. The blondie was really great tasting and the ice cream and sauce made this a la mode hunk of chocolate chip was definitely plate licking worthy.

The SnowBall - Yep, those good ole Hostess SnowBalls that I had growing up.  Chocolate cake wrapped in a fluffy marshmallow  and coconut and pink!  So much better tasting than the Hostess one. This has a more dense texture and heavier cake.  Made for an awesome tasting dessert  Came with some kind of ice cream.  I was not sure what it was exactly.

4.  Service - 3 star at best - In my two times here, I would say that they service was okay.  First time was lunch they kept servicing us from the far side of our table, over all the condiments and so far away from us.  Very odd.  Second time, we had dinner and it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come take our drink orders, it took about twenty minutes and two reminders to get our drinks, then when we ordered, he left out two orders and got one of the vegetarian ones, entirely wrong and brought it with meat.  We never got the two other orders, but since I checked the bill and they did not charge me, we didn't ask for them. It was too late and we had a plane to catch.  A good point is that another waiter came out and corrected the vegetarian order and gave us a take home box for the meat order and did not charge us. That was cool.

You are only as strong as your weakest link so I feel that once they get their wait staff fully up to speed, this place will be a solid 4 or 5. On a good note, we had one main server, and three others helping him so I love teamwork!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,9,7,3,--OMJDWiOY0fjG6VWQt-qw

We asked him about it and instead of starting over he grabbed our plate and dumped what he gave us back into the container where it came from! Ew!

I think it's important to note that the atmosphere is laid back and open-- often mistaken for poor service or lack of care-- but it isn't! What makes Lucky Foo's great (at least for me and my friends that go) is that they take the time to treat you like a person. You know, like have a quick chat or joke. People need to remember that they are interacting with humans and not robots. So with that, you get what you give, and I've always had (and will continue to have) a great experience.

Katsu chicken and waffles.  A good idea?  No, a great idea.  Crazy good.  Awefooly Footastic.

Hey, here's an idea.... let's have fire roasted Brussel sprouts for breakfast.  I typically hate them and will have something nasty to say about Foo's when I get home.  Nope.  They were out of this world off da hook Foobulous.

We went in on a Monday night. There was one other couple seated at a table and a few people at the bar. Other than that, it was a bunch of staff mulling around with nothing to do. Ghost town.

I was starving and ready to hop all over the menu. We got the Warm Root Salad (which wasn't bad, but also wasn't warm), two miso bowls which were just average, and two sushi rolls which were just plain not good. On one roll the rice was very compacted and dry, to the point where it was almost inedible without adding soy sauce, yet somehow the second roll was soggy and mushy. My lady companion is from Hawaii and knows her sushi. She said it tasted like the rolls sat in the fridge all night and then they just topped them with fresh fish, which I have to concur. The mushrooms in our miso bowls were clearly dried and then rehydrated. The quality of ingredients was just underwhelming. 

Also, I ordered a Moscow Mule, which didn't taste bad, but it also didn't taste like it had a drop of alcohol in it. I wasn't going to say anything, but when my server asked how the Mule was, I answered honestly, ""It tastes a little weak..."" Her response was, ""Oh...I'll have to let the bartender know."" But that was it. No offer to remake it, comp it, or anything. $10 for a weak drink is kind of lame. 

Our bill was about $60 and I still left a nice tip because our server was nice, but I see no reason to return here. I was still kind of hungry when I left and would have ordered more if the food were better. Maybe it was an off night, but with no customers and very mediocre food, I don't see where all of these great reviews are coming from or how they'll be able to keep their doors open.",J5sIbdcAwx-Gg-tZPk7pJg,2,0,2,bahSMg89QPmjMhtq3vRJrw

The Best Chicken Sandwich....Okay, little story, we were out last night with a couple of friends who happen to read my posts, the one thing they said is, at times my reviews come across as ""angry""...I can see that, this is one of those dishes....If you are going to name something on your menu 'The Best *******"" then it had better be the best, or at least very good, this was neither, the chicken patty was way to small for the bun, the panko crust was way to thick for the patty and then cooked to much making it hard instead of crunchy.

I said similar things about the chicken sandwich at culinary dropout, but as a test, I just stopped at McDonald's and picked up a buttermilk chicken sandwich, I have to say, McDonald's makes a better chicken sandwich than Lucky Foo's or Culinary Dropout, for 1/3 the price.

Went on a Travel zoo voucher and the staff didn't give us any trouble with using the voucher.Restaurant wasn't busy at all. Waiter was very attentive and the food came out remarkably fast.

The food:
-Starter: Foo platter. It was ok. Pretty standard wings, egg rolls, dumplings and chips. I will say the egg rolls were AMAZING! 

-Drinks: I had the Crouching Tiger which was pretty good. Must be a whiskey fan to enjoy this drink. My friend had the Rising Sun (I think) it was really good. Very light and slightly fruity.

-Short rib ramen: was pretty good. The broth is the star on this one. If you're a ramen fan I recommend giving this a try.

-Pork belly ramen: From what my friend said, this was pretty good as well

Overall I recommend this place to check out if you're in the area. It seems like a great place to go for a happy hour hang out as there's a really nice patio area and delicious drinks.",uCwhqvcf220bsTA_2yWvmg,1,0,4,iC6XAW0djEuAXum3RQPovA

I love how they served a lot of wasabi and ginger! The lasagna roll was bomb and so was the shrimp tempura roll! We also ordered the Short Rib Ramen.

Our table for 3 ordered the charred shishito peppers, foo fogs, chicken wings, lucky rice with short rib, ramen with short rib, crispy rice sushi, and the jalapeno yellowtail. We also had Waterdragon cocktail, Geisha Girl, and a hot sake. The food was mediocre and waaayy overpriced for what it was. The peppers and yellowtail where the best items we tried and were actually pretty tasty. I had to down several glasses of water with my ramen because the broth was straight up salt... the short rib part though was well cooked and flavorful. Cocktails were delicious, it would probably be the only ever thing I would have it I went back there. Decor and ambiance is awesome and nice, there is outdoor seating that would be good on a day with nice weather. However, I do not think I would go back here again because the price you pay for what you get is not worth it. Even though my food experience wasn't that great, I must say that they were very tentative with service.

5774174,2016-02-05,3,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Went on a Wednesday night, 5pm for Happy Hour. 

Items Selected:
Salmon Avocado sushi roll
Lasagna sushi roll
Yakitori Pork Belly skewers 
Tangy Korean Buffalo Chicken Wings
Short Rib Ramen

This place has caught my eye several times, and after checking out a few reviews and the menu, I had to give it a try. So many items sounded delicious.
My friend and I came here on Weds Happy Hour. It wasn't busy, maybe 4 tables total. Perfect! We should get quick service and good food.....keyword: should.

The hostess brought us menus and water, and we looked over the menu and made our decisions in 3-4 minutes. At least 15 minutes went by before we had to flag the hostess down and get someone to take our order. I believe I counted 3 servers and a manager guy walk by at least 3 times. A guy seated after us actually put his order in first. Lets just say...not well organized...so glad it wasn't packed full of customers. 

Free infused sake if you check in on Yelp.

Yakitori Pork Belly Skewers...2 skewers with 3 smallish pork bellies on each. Lacked flavor, and a bit too fatty. 3/5
Tangy Chicken Wings - Good flavor, nice kick with the buffalo sauce. 4/5
Short Rib Ramen - Heavy miso flavored broth. Noodles a bit undercooked and chewy. Short rib had a nice grilled flavor to it and tender. Could have used something to bring it up a notch. 3/5

The sushi rolls are good...the only bad part was it took well over 20 minutes to get them. Not sure how long it takes to make a roll but it definitely doesn't take that long. Lasagna roll was unique from other Japanese lasagna rolls in that it didn't seem baked and each piece was decorated individually and not as a group. I liked it. 4/5

To sum it all up.....OK food, slow service, and really nothing that wow'd me to make me want to come back. Which is too bad because I like the variety of offerings...from sushi to Ramen and more. I'll probably give them one more try because I want the pork belly ramen. If you aren't packed during Happy Hour, there's probably a reason for that. Maybe Tacos and Tequila Tuesdays was busier.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,7,4,3,Vt5Tm4NvkgechiLLUt5aug
5779685,2014-12-11,0,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Great Environment and amazing food!  What a great neighborhood local hang out.  The place is set up for fun and for a quiet date night.  They have a great bar area and an area with couches and lounge like seating, they also have a large patio area, and  a nice dining area.  They have a cool digital jukebox type system that allows you to select the music that will play straight from your smartphone, people in the restaurant get to vote on your selections from their smartphones, kind of cool.  

I typically drink a straight vodka drink to stay away from the sugar.  But that night the bartender had me try a few things, usually I say no, this day I didn't and what a surprise.  They had a house made mango infused sake that was awesome, I had a taste of two house specialty drinks that were also amazing, but my surprise was the sake on tap, it was cold, clean and crisp, with a light carbonation to it making it more like a champagne, really nice!

The food was amazing.  I went in for sushi, which was really great and they do have some house specialty rolls, that looked and sounded amazing, but I would up having their take on Hawaiian poke', which is nothing like any poke' I had before, I don't even know how to explain what was on it, but the flavor was great!  I then had the cedar plank salmon which was not  even on the menu yet, they told me it was a newly introduced item that would hit the menus next week.  WOW!  The salmon quality was amazing, it was cooked to perfection, with a nicely crisp outside, but still soft tender and moist inside, it had a cedar and believe it or not a bacon like flavor to it.  YUM!  It was served with some greens and over an awesome risotto with crispy prosciutto? or bacon? or pork?  or ?? in it, I don't know what but the flavor combinations were great!

I will be back, and I'm really hoping that this place becomes the go to spot in the area, it has all the potential to do so, great food, great environment, fun social spot!

From walking in it looks like a cool place, modern seating updated fixtures and a chill atmosphere. 

We were allowed to seat ourselves which was fine and wasn't really a problem. The problem was the lack of attention and service that we received. It took at least 10 minutes till someone asked if we had drink orders in yet. And overall all the servers seem uninterested in helping. Working in hospitality I think I just had a higher standard especially for a nice place like this. 
When you had as little customers as they had only 5-6 other tables is when servers should be trying to take extra care of their customers not check on them every 15 minutes 

I think that if they just went over their manners it would go a long way. A simple please, thank you and your welcome goes a long way. The only server who actually responded to my thank you with a your welcome instead of a k was ""James"" also the only server to introduce himself 


The food is pretty good the miso ramen was the best I would recommend it! The portions are alittle small side 

Overall I think that this negative experience  would make me not come back, but I think everyone has off days but overall when you work in the service industry regardless of how you feel you gotta suck it up and put your customers first. Something management should really focus on.

5923699,2015-02-22,4,biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,"Nice vibe.  Not my favorite food. There was something about the mixture of seasoning that wasn't for me. I like the fusion idea, but you need to be careful with that. Like the Korean fried rice didn't have much of a kimche flavor and had a taste of some Japanese seasoning that doesn't mix well for me. Same goes for the spring rolls.  It used the thin Filipino lumpia style wrap with a filling that had a shitake taste to it with lettuce and cilantro. Trying too hard to put too many cultures in one.   Sometimes you shouldn't mess with a good thing. 

Just realized that the majority of reviews were non Asians who love this place. So I'm just going to have to say it, this is an Asian food place for the non Asian palate. 

For the Asian palate, try these places, Monta, Raku, Goyamon, Thelma's Filipino food, Ichiza, Curry Zen, Pin kao, Zenshin, Bachi Burger, and this is just off the top of my head.
