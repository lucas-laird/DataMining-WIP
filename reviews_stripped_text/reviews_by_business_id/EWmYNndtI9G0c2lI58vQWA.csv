1576890,2017-12-14,0,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,We ordered three different entrees: the Crispy fried pork was wonderful and I will definitely order it again.  The tenderloin entree although expensive was also top notch.  The filet of beef was cooked perfectly but was lacking a little bit in the seasoning.  We did order the smoked Chilean Seabass but they were out of it.  My only complaint is that the menu online does not resemble the menu in the restaurant.  We had selected some dishes online that we were going to try but they were no longer on the menu.  Service was great.,MUVw0pk5-0VZlqIz40XAbA,0,0,4,t3zZYdZ1dGFwiE6Gpv3ynQ

I liked the baked bbq pork buns, the shrimp rice rolls, the XO shrimp dumplings, gingko + peashoots, and their soups are excellent! 

Their XO sauce is really yummy. 

Service is above and beyond. Decor is elegant. We were in a private room with its own private bathroom. 

Highly recommend this place.

Update: 

I had the Dungeoness Crab Meat with Egg White.... OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Absolutely perfect! The egg white omelette stir fried with fresh crab meat is so flavorful, great to eat with some rice. The dish was the favorite of the entire table! 

Must-try!",ZCpUGSEpHQZRcLWScp0aSg,4,2,5,pcGGxIQplsLWcG2tBqqIWQ

Dragon Breath is amazing!
Also got the 20% local discount, even better.",Shxakj8IyAXFZ8iENsQndg,0,1,5,2daZl3l6N-TbRlSC3lMyuA
2864767,2017-09-23,0,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,I was very impressed with the view and warm welcome by the staff. The menu has been recently changed and they added  more options to choose from. The Ribeye was so juicy along with an amazing selection of Dim-Sum that filled me up. My friend had a Seafood pasta dish that had shrimp scallops and clams that was also very tasty.  The egg sugar puff dessert was so tasty and went perfect with a cup of coffee.,TK-hOeUQSAO3PqmHQs-ysQ,0,0,5,oEoCnGpqe0TAYig0Jo_6mw

I had the scallops with shrimp, bacon and asparagus and the beef fried rice. It was absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed the Wolf cocktail, which was strong to my liking. 
The service was excellent, very attentive and courteous. They made my Admin Day very special. Thank you Lucky Dragon.",1Z20YaJVA1aTP4LSDWsKMA,1,0,5,C9DiAfIRyHaDI_pt3mTAAw
3458312,2017-10-12,1,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,"Seems to be less popular than the resteraunt next door that shares the same hostess. The menu next door seemed a lot better but had a 30 min wait vs no wait. It was Relatively quiet Saturday night. The menu itself is rather small, but filled with great dishes. We got the duck wrap, seafood Stevie, kimchi fried rice, jumbo prawns, and one of each dessert.

The duck wrap was delicious. Great taste with a spicy kick at the end. Seafood Stevie was very light, I wish it would have had a bit more flavor. Jumbo prawns were... Well... Jumbo. Great taste cooked perfectly. Kim chi friend rice was done as you'd expect. The desserts were also delicious. In order (best to worse) my favorites were there the mochi ice cream, then the mango pudding, and then the cream puff.

The food for the most part was above average, but why this place really gets 5 stars is because of it's service. We admittedly had an obnoxious group of 6, but the wait staff was beyond friendly, patient, and accommodating. The main server was also training and I believe the resteraunt's service will be in good hands going forward.",Htn0zMg5jDBhp-TRx1dBUg,2,0,5,e15riuw6zD9W-gUemwip9A

Our group was looking for a unique upscale Chinese restaurant and the chef as well as the rest of the team exceeded those expectations. We began with a 7lb Australian lobster and shrimp sashimi. Note: This was not on the menu, but recommended by the chef. Needless to say this was a first, but we were not disappointed. The sashimi was followed with what was left of the lobster including deep fried head, leg and tail. Yumm!! Our main dishes consisted of wok-seared tenderloin beef, which was insanely tender and flavorful and abalone and chicken served in a clay pot. As we were there celebrating a birthday, they surprised us with traditional Chinese longevity peaches, basically a lotus flavored bun filled with a sweet surprise. This place was on the expensive side of things, but that is to be expected and very well worth it. This was an experience I will never forget and definitely recommend to others!",FTa8g21sgvCMmlWtfSiI5Q,4,0,5,6AEcDJwfxM1Pwd4LdQp1Hg
4157236,2017-03-06,0,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,"Very elegant restaurant, very beautiful inside.  Utensils were goldware! It is very expensive.  Almost prohibitively so.  There are entrees on the menu that are over $300. Most are not, however.  There is a nice locals discount with their players club that brings the prices down to just expensive.  If you can get past all of that, it is a very fine restaurant and the staff and atmosphere make you feel first class.  The tenderloin beef cubes (which was reasonably priced) was delicious.  The sauteed lobster (which was on the crazy price menu) was not as good and kind of hard to eat.  The fried rice, which comes with the entree was probably the best I've tasted in Las Vegas.  I think this restaurant needs to tweak its menu just a little bit and it has the potential to do to the Asian dining experience what Michael's restaurant at the South Point casino did to the French dining experience.",diRpvxTOJ2nj4wCO2dfE9w,1,0,4,xRvz0PyClI4GKx_RjeRlLg
4687867,2017-04-12,0,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,"Phoenix is one of the best high end Chinese restaurants in town. I really like their new menu. Some of my favorite dishes include the shrimp cocktail, Sautéed Lobster, Mushrooms and Jalapeño Tenderloin Beef Cubes and the Mochi Ice Cream Duo. The ambiance is very nice and has a great view of the north strip. This is the perfect place to dine for a nice occasion.",sB5wBopRWDge2h2U6FfcuA,3,1,5,Rb3Nbe5m46I7ing1xZiYiw
4827246,2017-12-23,0,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,"Came in on a Friday night. We were the only table. Seated at 7:15, put the order in at 7:22. The food did not come out for a good 20 minutes. Both my husband and I ordered the lamb chops. His lamb chops came out and my order did not. Then the waiter said oh I only put one order in, what?!?! So I waited another30 minutes for the other order to come out. They told me at that point that they were out of asparagus. They then give me side of mushrooms. My mashed potatoes were ice cold. Seriously ?!?! At this point there were 5 tables. It is now 8:35 and I'm still waiting for the manager to come back around as he asked how everything was in the very beginning, then dashed off while we were telling him about our experience. Besides the gold forks and spoons. Expect to wait hours here to be served. This other table waited 40 minutes just to get the duck lettuce wraps. All I can say is... if you want a night out a Loooong night out with some $50 shake and bake lamb. This is the place to be!

*** just to be fair. It was not the servers fault. He was relying on the kitchen and the kitchen just wasn't cooking up his dishes, until the restaurant next door, restaurant pearl was done all their orders.

The management is to blame, when your manager sees that you are swamped and two managers walk back and forth past the guests and not assist the waiter in anyway is just terrible. 

Instead they were trying to figure out what tunes to play as we have been dining in silence for almost 2 hours. 

Management you guys need to be full on management, managers that are hands on can jump in and assist in every way to ensure a great guest experience.

Instead of wearing your suits and dresses, roll your sleeves up and get dirty. 

After all it is the guest experience and food that counts.

For a high end Asian restaurant.",t1ghEF3tWvjn5NtIQ5_hag,0,0,1,zU_nEJLIybBVNB4DZKVvyQ
4882886,2017-04-12,0,EWmYNndtI9G0c2lI58vQWA,Fantastic fine dining Chinese food that I've eaten at several times.  Menu was recently updated to add some less expensive items to make the restaurant a bit more approachable but without neglecting any of the classic delicacies that make this such a special destination.,wOUrTSFt4pAAIHPWNJVIcg,1,0,5,keUH6my-I6gh8a7RTCvkNg
