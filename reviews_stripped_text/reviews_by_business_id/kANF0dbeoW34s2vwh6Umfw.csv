I understand when a mistake happens once or twice when it is busy, but I have gone here multiple times and during those multiple times, my order and the service have been not at it's best. For example, I have ordered fries and they told me it was going to be a few minutes because they make everything fresh, but when I got the fries, they were cold and undercooked. Secondly, when I order a blizzard, the amount of toppings in very light. Thirdly, filthy filthy filthy. I am not surprised that I saw a C rating in their lobby.

Apparently the cheap owner decided not to give more then 1 use on a multi use coupon. I will make sure to go to another dairy queen in the valley everytime i want dairy queen. They also have the worst customer service saying it is policy and to call the manager. It is a multi use coupon maybe the owner should learn what that means. Also good job wasting your product as i did not purchase the blizzards because i went to another dq that accepted the coupon. Your loss not mine.

Advisory: This location ONLY!

I use to come here on my lunch breaks because it was right next to where I used to work. I would walk here almost once a week...JUST FOR CONVENIENCE! We only got a half hour lunch so I had to go somewhere close and the only other option was Mc Donald's and I'm not a big fan! 

So hmmm where do I begin? Yes its that bad! 

Ok the 1st time I came here I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo which after tax was like $8.00bucks!!!...OMG it took 20 minutes for me to get my order which meant I had to scarf this nasty sickening burger down in 5 mins because I still had to walk back to work and clock in! 

Not to mention on top of it taking forever to cook it was under cooked I saw it was rare pink!!! I was so pissed off and had no time to complain I just ate the thing and left to work. 

I tried this place a few more times only because I didn't have time to eat anywhere else. 

The second time I ate here I tried there chicken strips. UMMM they were tasty but had blue dots streaming through them...not sure what that was but hey I'm still living! 

After trying various items I came to realize the only tasty and safe thing to order was their chili cheese fries which after tax came to almost 6 bucks for a large. 

Luckily I do not nearby anymore and will NOT be returning!

I witnessed an employee with dirty finger nails. Also no washing of hands or gloves while touching raw and cooked food. This location seems more of a health department issue than anything else.

OK, I had extra time the other night and I had a strong desire to get some ice cream on the 100 degree day.  Problem solved.  Traffic was lighter than normal and I was able to make the south turn into the DQ , parked, and went inside.

The store is a bit old and somewhat rundown, but it was clean and there weren't many people there.  I looked at the Blizzard board for quite awhile and decided to go with the Blizzard of the Month--Confetti cake.  That's white cake pieces and confetti frosting blended with vanilla soft serve.  It was OK.  I should have stood firm with something peanut butter, but hey, when you're Blizzard of the Month, I guess you have to be good.

I may stop here again but I'll order with more care.  The staff was very pleasant and let me take all the time I wanted to decide.  Good service.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,0,0,3,Ydc4unBHX_vh5LBJcCAyoA

first when i get there they tell me that this location doesn't yet have the new sandwiches.(even though the 29 others do)
well i just roll with it & order a #3-the flamethrower-looks alot like the new a&w firecracker-a double cheese with spicy jack-hot tobasco mayo & peppers.
they told me it would 5 minutes & they would bring it out. i started looking at they ads & i was ready to get a banana split & get another to go for the kid.
but then the food came out........
it was so terrible i took 2 bites & spit it out. greasy, greasy,greasy. no flavor beyond the grease. it was not spicy in any way-the tomato was frozen, the lettuce was the white piece from the center, the little smear of pink mayo was in no way spicy and the cheese was just white it had no peppers in it or anything. no jalapenos or peppers of any kind on it. and the burger was disgusting-greasy & slimy. a freezer burnt frozen patty. the second bite i bit something hard like a rock and it was over. the fries were undercooked and the soda was flat. the management seemed completely clueless. no wonder this place is empty every time i have ever driven by. i would recommend doing what i did for 10 years before today-just drive by! or if you do stop just take the $$ & a lighter and watch it burn!!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,0,0,1,r7pSTQznv6RVCGGuReU4kg

Every time we go, everyone's happy. This is a GREAT place to get a frozen treat, not just in the summer. They have Blizzards of over a dozen flavors. Right now (gotta find out until when exactly), blizzard of the month featured are girl Scout mint cookies! 

They have a special menu (for now) that's 2 for $3, 3 for $4 and 4 for $5. Inside they have posters of cars and Americana that's not just limited to the 50's. they also make ice cream caked for kids' parties. they also have a window with DQ logo wear. But, the first time I went there it was packed, and since, the stock has gotten lower and lower. I'm waiting for them to replenish so I can get a button up/ uni type shirt.

I have to say I normally like Dairy Queen! It takes me back to the 80's when life was easy breezy! Mmmmm Heath bar blizzard, such a treat! 

Cherry dilly bar, mmmmm yummy! 

My issue and complaint is THIS location only! 

I finally decided to write my review to help others avoid this train wreck of an operation! 

If I can save one person from eating at this location then I have done my duty! 

Food is never made or cooked properly! 

Corn dogs are still frozen in the middle. 

Blizzards have very little mix ins! Always skimpy! If I order a snickers or heath bar blizzard, come on and put some in it! 

Cheeseburger tasted fowl and I can't describe the taste and odor other than the memory of tossing it into a bin labeled TRASH. 

Prices are high for the amount and quality of food you get. 

The wait for food is ridiculous, after visiting a few times and waiting 20 minutes regardless of what I ordered I knew this place had issues. 

I should have never returned after my first visit however I was open at the time to give them another shot. Always a long wait and disappointment in what I ordered. 

This store is clearly a franchise, they are not playing by the rules that is for sure. 

They cut corners beyond reason and it shows in their service and quality. 

The staff at this location leaves a lot to be desired. 

I have cut this location out as an option, it no longer exist to me. 

The drive thru set up is ridiculous. Try driving in an inside circle and talking through a cup and string speaker system.
