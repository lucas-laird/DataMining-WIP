When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly welcome. We noticed that their were no tables to sit which was fine because we wanted to take the food home since we don't live very far. The worker explained the menu and also mentioned that they only been open for almost a week. 

The menu was very simple they offer fried oysters, fried clams, fried shrimp, and anything fried seafood. My bf ordered the fried oysters which came with french fries and Cole slaw. I ended up ordering a soft shell crab roll since I wanted something on the healthy side. The roll was pretty good nothing too special. I did try a bite of the fried oysters, it was pretty good and a decent size.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,4,1,3,aqKiAQs63k53C_Xo0IpB-A

They were out of coke and Dr. Pepper, and the Sprite was flat, not a real big deal because I'm not a soda drinker anyways. Definitely not a place that you would stay and eat, no air conditioning and its very small. Meals are prepared to order which is nice, however it took a solid 20 min so I would call ahead next time. I ordered the combo which had 1 piece of fried cod, 5 shrimp, coleslaw and french fry's. Cole slaw was bland, needed salt and for the price they could have added another piece of fish, because they were small pieces. It was very greasy, however the fish and shrimp were great tasting. I also ordered a crab cake. It was OK very bland and so was the aioli sauce it came with. I don't recommend paying 6 dollars for a small crab cake unless it was great. So overall my order was 20 dollars for 5 small shrimp, 1 small piece of cod, a small crab cake, a flat soda, french fry's and a mini cup of bland coleslaw. I won't be rushing back.",DAkJpz7xLlxg2A7qBFxUAg,1,1,2,2z0MKgbxbRZ9wPH0gxLDcg

The owner is very nice and even offered us tastings as he apoligized for the wait, which we weren't bothered about anyway. We ordered a fried catfish poboy, crabcakes and calamari with fries, The catfish was tasty, but the bread was the star. The coleslaw inside was a good addition as it did not overpower the rest of the poboy. Crabcakes were very flavorful. And the calamari were great. I prefer to see tentacles in my calamari! Overall a place I would highly recommend. I deducted a star as there is very limited seating, that's all.

1549830,2012-07-08,0,8_mXYs-ZOqDGS7ifAjaocA,"Searched through yelp while trying to find something different around my house to eat other than the usual pizza or burgers that are so prevalent in the centennial/providence area and found this gem. They have been open only two months and already have a solid 4 star rating and now I know why.

It looks like it is just the owner, Warren, that works in the shop and it is a to-go place with no tables which was just fine with me. Since he makes everything fresh it is true that there may be a wait for your food, but it is worth it. While I was waiting for my sandwiches he fried up some free clam strips for me which was not only nice, but they were delicious- perfectly fried.

Speaking of fried, keep that in mind when you come here. All of the fish and shellfish is fried, but is cooked to perfection.

All I can say is that Warren picked a great location (right next to retro bakery) and I hope he is successful because he is a nice guy with a great product that is rather hard to find here in the desert.",ojKLAp858S8zv7RnoBMzqQ,5,2,5,VC7i7WVItm33iMj8Zub-jA

The batter had a great texture (but again, was very bland) and the rolls were fresh but honestly, but the best part was the frozen fries.  We had the oyster entree, the catfish sandwich and the clam strips.... wouldn't return for any of them. :(  I may give them another try in a few months if I hear they improve, but for the price it would take a lot of convincing.",HfFCXVP5MP2Rh1IlD-ILNw,0,0,2,93EJVKD_8Rn_86K2lh76KQ

2872067,2012-10-04,0,8_mXYs-ZOqDGS7ifAjaocA,"If you're looking for a good local seafood restaurant, Seafood Station is definitely a good place to start.  It's a small (mostly take-out) restaurant that makes everything fresh after you order.  I've had their fried shrimp Po-Boy sandwiches and New England Clam Chowder two times and they're some of the best I've had.  The slaw is not drenched in mayo and is not overly sweet.  The chowder is not too creamy or dairy and has plenty of clams.  Their fried oysters and fish (cod) and chips were great also, although once they have additional seating, the fries would certainly taste better eaten there when fries are crispy.  

The owner says he is working on getting additional seating soon.  Once that happens, the restaurant should quickly gain popularity.",aPe3uyDXSps0Grt7lchXAw,2,1,5,D1fg8iNVDANqH9TYU97y7w
2933998,2012-12-13,1,8_mXYs-ZOqDGS7ifAjaocA,"For a quick fried sandwich po boy, and a taste of the south in Northwest Vegas, you have arrived.   Its a small retail shop behind walgreens by the 7-11 , next to the most famous cupcake shop in the NW, Retro Bakery.  

I had the shrimp poboy, delish!
I also had an oyster poboy, silly good!
I give it 5 star on food, the only ding was how small the place is, not super hospitable, but remember this is great takeout.  Prices are just right for seafood, cheap really.

Recommended, and super glad I stopped by, It reminded me of the mow-downs I had in New Orleans drunk and needing food really bad, this place saves your life!
Owners cook your food, you roll out.......I will return soon.",JZsDEj8EnFppjzoAFKm-mQ,3,2,4,MJYFyMgXgXTEuj4p471yRw
3167841,2013-01-01,0,8_mXYs-ZOqDGS7ifAjaocA,"This place is great! I've eaten here a handful of times and I'm a big fan of consistency. Seafood Station has been consistent with their food every time.

They have a great selection and for seafood, the prices are decent. I've had a couple different po-boys, a few of the ""entrees"" and tried pretty much every side item apart from the salads. The po-boys are my favorite! They use a nice soft roll, the slaw is delicious and I love the ""pink"" sauce. Their shrimp are large and juicy, the catfish is giant with great crust and the meatloaf with bacon po-boy is full of flavor. 

I usually grab a side when I'm down there and they have a good variety. Everything I've tried has been great. The fries are always cooked just right and not too greasy, the green beans have a nice crisp to them and their fried calamari and clam strips are awesome. I wasn't a huge fan of the clam chowder as it's a bit ""watery"" to me but it still has good chunks of clam and great flavor. I absolutely love their 'single item' menu where you can order just one shrimp, crab cake or a couple other items. 

I'm giving them 4 stars for a couple reasons. Out of the five times I've been there over the past couple months, the fountain soda machine has always been out of order. While its nice they offer cans of soda and bottles of water, it'd be nice to grab a fresh fountain drink with my food. And the only other reason being the seating. There isn't much there but what they do have is always tidy and clean. Seafood Station is one of my favorite spots out here in the far NW!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,0,0,4,7Y1ImEbvfUe0I0UeHiOF6w

3384895,2012-10-10,0,8_mXYs-ZOqDGS7ifAjaocA,"This place is literally a hop skip and a jump from my new house ... so i had to try it.    As most of you have seen my review for Shucks tavern which is a bit farther down on Durango , you will be pleased to know that Seafood Station met my expectations. 

I ordered a 1 Peice Fish , 5 Shrimp , Fries , Coleslaw and Soda plate.   You can choose between Cod and Cat Fish , i chose cod.   
Now to the meat .... 

The shrimp were Huge , bigger than i expected.  They were light on batter ( a good thing ) and very very moist and tasty.  I will definitely be back for the shrimp alone. 
They serve some sort of red mayo type sauce somewhat close to 1000 Island , but not quite with it , delectable. 

The cod was very flaky , and tasty , but was unfortunately .. not crunchy.  Not sure if i just got a bad one , or it took too long for me to get home ( 5 minutes ) .  I was praying for crunchy , but alas it did not go my way.    I ENJOYED it though and the flavor was very good. 

The fries were still crunchy , not quite half the size of a good steak fries. They had good flavor and were not over slated. 

The coleslaw was , eh .. but im not really a fan of coleslaw.

All in all for the money , its a little pricey , but if the shrimp continue to be as good as they are , im willing to pay a little extra.  

Keep it up guys !",-B731Wh1510uXX9eC1orQQ,3,0,4,p_ZegkLjrl_Fhy5-0-kxQg

You know how many times you see a random place to Eat, Drink, etc as you walk around...how many times do you stop? 

I found this little gem just grabbin a slurpee at 7-11 next door and decided to check it. I have been back several times since and now my friends go too.

From the fresh calamari, or the clam strips, to the soft shell crab, or the oyster po-boy. It is all great. Good price for fresh seafood and you also support a mom and pop shop. Its a to-go style shop so grab your grub and head home to enjoy, Very good...

4137789,2012-11-11,1,8_mXYs-ZOqDGS7ifAjaocA,"So I was debating between 2 and 3 stars becuase while the shrimp Po Boy was good the service was lacking....
What customer wants to walk into an establishment and see the cashier asleep on the counter. It was uncomfortable to say the very least....

Now, like I said the Shrimp Po Boy sandwich was good - the shrimp weren't tiny - the texture and breading of the fried shrimp was good, the cole slaw wasn't overly swimming in mayonaise and the bread was soft enough.

However, I personally feel that the price is too expensive - maybe if a side was included - like fries or chips or even a fountain drink....IDK something!!!

I luv to support local establishments but I also feel that in order to survive especially with the economy right now people need to feel like they are getting 
""bang for their buck"" cause $10.00 nowadays should provide more than just a good sandwich.....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,2,1,3,t9_WbZ6aE9gIoPTqipFNlA

They took me to a little place that was unassuming from the outside, inside was neat as a pin with menus written on chalkboards, reminiscent of the fried seafood joints they used to eat at in City Island growing up in the Bronx.  The owner is the nicest person possible, chatting with us and even giving us some free shrimp to taste while we waited for our order.  The oysters are HUGE, the breading is light and crispy, the seasoning is perfect.  The house made sauces and slaw complement the crispy goodness perfectly.   This is the place to go when that fried seafood craving hits you, its the real deal,  As close as you will get to city island without a plane ticket.

Soft shell crab entree was fresh, crispy and good.
Green beans sub'd for fries were fresh. They trimmed off the ends and flash fried them while I waited.
Cole slaw came with the meal, I added a little of the pink house sauce to it.
