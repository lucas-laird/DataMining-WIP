Although the restaurant was not busy, they had removed our seats. Again, we called to let them know we were running late. Once we joined the group we had to flag the server down 15 minutes later. We ordered the champagne with tea to be told there was no more champagne,  which was actually prosecco and nothing was offered in its place. We then ordered our tiers. It took our table AN HOUR to get their tiers, we waited our hour to be told THREE TIMES ""it's almost ready"". At 65 minutes we gave up and told the server ""never mind, we are done waiting."". They were out of multiple teas and no longer offered some on the menu. This place CLEARLY has NO manager on duty, no one apoligized, as no one cared.

Located near Blue Martini in the alleyway where Capriotti is, came in on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 3. Read prior reviews and wasn't expecting it to be as busy but it was. We were asked if he had reservations and because we didn't, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes. So just in case, I'd recommend making reservations especially on weekends. Crowd dies down around 3/330 so if you go in then, you should be alright. 

I opted for the green tea tropical which was served immediately with a side of honey, sugar, and cream. Our tiers came in not too long after with the 1st tier filled with sandwiches, second with a plain scone and chocolate chip scone, then third with chocolate cream puffs, banana bread, and lemon macarons. 2nd and 3rd tiers are unlimited and you'll be given a side of whipped cream and house made jam.

As far as the tea sandwiches, the smoked salmon and cucumber sandwiches were pretty good but the egg, and what seemed to be an apple sandwich were meh. I'm not sure what was going on in that apple sandwich but it tasted like a weird combo and the egg sandwich tasted a lot like mayo. Scones were actually good. Not too dense. The whipped cream was perfect with the chocolate chip scone and the jam was perfect with the plain scone. Top tier of desserts were okay but nothing to really rave about. They'll provide a box for any leftovers you have if you'd like to take them home.

As far as service goes, it was actually good! We were expecting it to not be so great from what others have said but our server did his job well. He came in every now and then to make sure we were okay without being overwhelming, filled out waters, and refilled our teas. Plus, everything came out in a timely manner. 

Overall, my first high tea experience in Vegas was not bad at all. And for $20, I think it's pretty worth it. Place is cute and it's very fitting for some time with your girlfriends.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,5,3,3,nfQ1DXNqpNBUaUK3KzIo2w
124288,2012-12-18,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"I kind of hate going to completely unplanned restaurants and getting a burger; I think I've been around town long enough as the 'Burger Blogger' to have heard most of the places that people think I need to try, so when an opportunity to eat at English's Quintessentially British came up I was quite skeptical. The burger picture on their website actually looked decent, not like I would want to judge anything based on photo alone, but I did become slightly more optimistic. But as all us locals hopefully know by now, there really isn't any good food options at Town Square other than Meatball Spot. And to ruin the surprise, this meal didn't change that.

As the name should tell you, English's is a slightly modern take on British food. The menu certainly isn't short on holding up that promise. Although there are some more common dishes surely to appease the common folks that will end up here, it's chock full of items like cottage pie, fish & chips, Cornish pastry and plenty of others. The interior doesn't really speak to the menu theme; as it is fairly clean and minimal. I sat on the patio during my visit, which has a slightly cluttered layout of tables overlooking the park below. Luckily it was quiet and kind of cool on the day of my visit; I can imagine this being very noisy during the summer with its proximity to the children's area.

Their burger is made with an 8oz hand formed patty, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato and cheddar cheese. The patty is small and thick just like a homemade one would be when it shrinks unexpectedly on a grill. The beef had just ok flavor; it didn't seem like the best quality, and was cooked almost too much below the medium-rare I ordered. The onions were good, the cheese was non-existent. They gave me lots of tomato, maybe too much. The bun was just ok as well; it looked way better than it tasted with its grill marks and all, but was not well-proportioned to the meat as I had a lot left over. Overall this was nothing that flavorful or good, just a slightly sub-par burger that seemed like it was cooked in your neighbor's back yard.

Instead of chips I had to get fries; they were really great actually, thick, salted, cooked well and very flavorful. It's not very often that a restaurant completely misses on a burger but actually gets the fries mostly right. Regardless, this is a burger meal you can go ahead and skip; $14 for iffy meat and a less than perfect burger off the strip is far too much. If you're in Town Square and are looking for a burger I might suggest Tommy Bahama's instead. Otherwise, there really isn't much to eat in this area.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,2,47UHxYbecgu8U_feRZj0og
136028,2014-08-25,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"English's is a hidden Vegas gem with food that takes you back to London and an option for patio dining.  This weekend was my second visit to English's.  We had just finished up a 9 hole golf game, so we were pretty hot and hungry.  
We began with some Pimms cups (official English liquor with lemonade or fruit).  We also had the salmon crust-inis to start. They were super good!
One person on out group had the bangers and mash, which I tried on my last visit. It was better this time around.  Last time it was swimming in too many onions.  I had the fish and chips which included the mashed peas.  Who knew that peas could be this good!?! The fish and batter was great complete with some side sauce.  Another friend had the fish sandwich sliders which she seemed to enjoy.  
We sat near a party that was enjoying the ""high tea"".  I definitely want to return for that.  It was like a sweet little tea party complete with savory snacks and deserts.  
English's never seems to be busy.  I'm assuming because some people don't know how to eat at places that aren't chains?! You should go here! They also have a great beer selection.",_ybknlgSmFSTSEq3RqBXiA,0,0,4,tO1BZHN91FVuRj4CxiCfbQ

We ate exclusively off the happy hour menu and were delighted with the prices. The food was so delicious!! Fresh and full of flavor...not greasy at all. The chips and curry appetizer was amazing!

266993,2011-09-02,1,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"I was intrigued by the newest kid on the block at Town Square, especially since it's a little different than the existing bars/restaurants.

First, it's a cool little joint.  It seems to be the exact layout as Caña, the previous occupant.  It has a great happy hour - $10 pitcher of English beer, $4 well drinks, $5 cocktails.  I think wine was $3.  

Another great thing is that they have REVERSE happy hour, which can be hard to come by in Vegas.  It's 9:30pm-11:30pm, M-F.    

There's also $2 happy hour food; we had fried zucchini (called something  special, but can't quite remember); chips; and beef sliders.  The chips were good, but I agree with a previous post -- the curry sauce was a little odd.  

The slider was good, and for $2, I'll take it.  However, be aware that it's ONE slider.  It's a ""big"" slider, and appears to be have been deep fried, which makes it oh-so-much-better on so many levels.  Nonetheless, it's one slider, which was a little off-putting given that the happy hour menu says ""sliderS"" (plural).  Oddly enough, and which our group later chuckled at, when another person ordered a BLT off the regular menu (singular), it came with TWO big BLT sandwiches!            

It seems a little upscale but that could be the cloth table linens talking.  In any event, I dig this place and hope it survives.  I'm interested to try the daily tea they do.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,3,0,4,_kl9ZAi2FP4cdGyUMabWGQ

291894,2013-10-09,2,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"I used to LOVE this place! The bartenders were fun and the happy hour menu was awesome. There is a window that separates the bar from patio that was always open, so you could still be outside and sitting at the bar. I have been here overall maybe about 6 times. The last time was about maybe 3-4 months ago, and wow I am disappointed and do not plan to go back!

We walk in, there are two servers and bartender. Sign says, ""Please Wait to be Seated"". We pause, they all three see us, and then continue with their conversation. Finally we just start walking out to the patio, and the bartender decides to greet us.

This was a second date for me, so things are still a bit awkward and new , and we just stared at each other like, wtf. So we get seated and a nice waitress comes to our table, she gives us the Happy Hour menu which states Beer & Wine half off during happy hour. I want a merlot and I order it. She says only house red or white is happy hour now. Fine, so I order a white... Grab the menu for food and I already know I want the Fish & Chip Sliders, but they have been removed from the HH menu also!

Takes a minute to get our drinks, we order an app, the spinach and artichoke cheese dip. I taste the wine, it's disgusting! I have my friend try it, he gags also. The last time it ordered the cheese dip it was thick and the bread was warm and very good. This time? Runny, luke warm, and the bread is not warm and it's almost too toasted its a huge mess...

Needless to say, we paid our tab and went next door to Blue Martini where the happy hour is awesome! $6 fancy and delicious martinis and live entertainment, and a really cool vibe.

My sister and I are big fans of afternoon tea. We love to ham it up by wearing proper lady hats and dressing up. Well, we didn't change anything this time. We came dressed for the occasion.

We sat on the patio, enjoying the gorgeous weather and watching what others were having for lunch. 

The scones were the best I've ever tasted. And they are huge (and unlimited). I only ate two and that was enough for me to want to undo my pants top button. The petite sandwiches and desserts were delicious as well. My only complain, if you want to call it that, is that our tea pots were not refilled with hot water so that we could continue drinking hot tea.

350839,2011-09-07,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"I saw this place as one of the featured new openings.  My hubby is a Fish and Chips fanatic, he's always in search of a good one most especially if it's English, and he's so picky.  So I told him we should check this place out since there aren't too many English places around, and it had high ratings.

We went in late afternoon on Saturday over the labor day weekend.  Because of the time we went, there were only a few customers so we were seated immediately.  As you can see the pictures on their website, the place is really nice and modern.  We've actually been there when it was another upper scale seafood restaurant, and I believe they kept most of the furnishings.  All the staff greeted us and were very courteous, but nothing overtly, just very attentive.

My hubby of course ordered the Cod Fillet, I had the Steak, Mushroom and Ale Pie, and we ordered the English's Bolognese for our little one.  They can make any of the entrees kid sized, but we ordered the regular so we can always take it home.  We didn't order any appetizer's or dessert this go around.  The hubby liked his Cod, it was real crisp had a great crunch to it and the Cod was flaky and moist, however he said it was really good but not blown away.  My dish was good, but I know I wouldn't like the Ale taste, and I really wished the meat was much more tender than it was.  It was cooked well however this dish just was not to my liking but it might be to someone else.  The puff pastry was so light and flaky, so flaky that it crumbled so easily.  As for my daughter's meal, I like her's the most, it had really great flavor, and was a generous portion that I shared it with her again the next day. 

I feel bad for the 3 star rating, I want to give them 4 because the aesthetics of the place, the attentive staff, the chef even came out to greet us which was real nice, the quality of the food seems to be real good, maybe if only we ordered something different.  Our selections just weren't to our taste, but it might be to someone else.  The hubby doesn't care to come back because of the many options there are out there.  However I would like to come back for the Afternoon Tea which you really don't find around.  Perhaps with girlfriends sometime.",_oIE5QhVe30exFqkRo2vuA,2,0,3,LOE9h5__1Ep_t-YiQOb_nw
445499,2013-05-13,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"First visit here, and certainly my last to this train wreck of a restaurant. When we first arrived, we were left standing at the front for 5 minutes without being acknowledged. Finally a bartender rolled her eyes and came over in a huff to greet us. Sorry to bother you, lady. Asking for a table for 3 on the patio, she said a host is who would have to handle that and promptly turned around and walked away without another word. Wow.

Finally seated, we waited another 10 minutes to be greeted and for our drink order to be placed. Another 5+ minutes goes by, and we are brought our drinks and a very warm beer. Waiting another full 10+ minutes, the server came back to take our order. I ordered a chicken salad and a replacement beer because mine was hot. My girlfriend asked the waitress for a salad exactly like the one at a table next to us but with steak added to it and a side order of fries. 

After 15 minutes, a replacement beer arrived that was maybe 2 degrees cooler at most. Thirsty, I gave up on the idea of having a cold beer and forced down the hot one.

30 more minutes go by while we listen to the tables around us complaining about various service related issues until finally our food arrived. My chicken salad was correct and to be fair was very tasty. My girlfriend, despite pointing out the exact salad she wanted on the next table, was brought the wrong one. And the waitress forgot to put the order for the fries in all together. Amazing. 

The food quality seemed pretty good. If I owned this place, I would keep the kitchen staff and fire everyone else since everything forward of the kitchen was a complete sh!tshow.",-H79vI_1TeLXjApJcW4EZw,1,0,1,Vsan_poxSjG7JV6eMBBqCg

My husband and I went with 5 other couples and told them when we made reservations that we were going to need separate checks, we reminded the waitress while she was pouring our water and she snarled at us saying ""i know, i already talked to the hostess about it!"" We ordered our apps and about half of the menu items were 86'd.. on a Friday evening! About an hour after we ordered our apps, we finally were able to order dinner when our server came back. Again, most of the menu was 86'd and the server continued to have a very bad attitude. No smiling, not responsive and neglected our table. After eating our greasy fish and chips and flavorless pastas she brought us the bill. The bill was not separated and she told us to figure it out and then she would split it! Why would she just not separate it while she was ringing in the food. There were over 50 items on our bill, how were we supposed to calculate all that amongst 12 people? After speaking with the managers she took back the bill and gave us separate checks, unfortunately since she did not separate everything from the start we sat there for an additional 45 minutes waiting on our bill. The server was pissed off from the beginning and clearly flustered at the end. There were probably 5 other tables at the time and at least 2 other servers.

THANK GOODNESS WE DID. 

We were immediately greeted by the bartender who was extremely welcoming and nice. We sat outside because the weather was amazing. The inside of this small bar/restaurant is aesthetically pleasing. It has a really nice atmosphere, it wasn't obnoxiously loud either. The outside was just as great. 

We had a 15% off coupon, but didn't end up using it because it was happy hour anyways. We loved this place. There was British food and different beer. It felt very authentic. We ended up ordering lettuce wraps, hot chocolate, cider, two beers, and a soda, and only paid $18. Well worth it!!

Besides the good/different/traditional appetizers and beer, the hot chocolate was to die for and the service was exceptional. Our waitress took the time to explain some of the food and drinks to us since we were unfamiliar with some of the things they had to offer. She continuously came back to make sure everything was fine and she filled our drinks on time. 

Few things of note:

1. The food and drinks are different, if you are picky or not up to try new things, I would not suggest going here. You are just going to annoy your waitress and yourself.

2. The second beer took a while to come out and when our waitress ended up bringing it she gave it to us for free. (DIDN'T MIND THAT A BIT!)

Both of us ordered the Cream Tea service for $18 each. With it you get your own pot of tea and share the goodies served on a three tiered plate. The top tier carried petite fours, the middle had 4 large scones, and the bottom tier held 3 different kinds of finger sandwiches (egg, cucumber and salmon with cream cheese). As for tea, my friend chose the English Breakfast and I went with the Green Tea Tropical. The waitress brought out our own pot with loose tea and gave us a timer so we can time the length to the steep the tea and a strainer for when we pour the tea into our cups. We were both delighted with our choices. The finger sandwiches were good, nothing extra ordinary about them but then again you are talking egg, cucumber and salmon sandwiches. The scones were very good. They were on the sweet side which I love but then again I do have a sweet tooth. They are huge and come with cream and strawberry jam. I didn't get a chance to eat any of the petite fours after devouring everything else and 2 pots of tea, I was full. 

My friend and I spent a wonderful 2 hours chatting and catching up while sipping tea. We both had a great time and enjoyed English's Afternoon Tea very much. For the price, I thought it was well worth it. I plan on coming here again with my daughter and have recommended this place to others. It is just a very nice place to go and enjoy some quality ""special"" time with your daughter, granddaughter or girlfriends!

The second time here assured me I will not be returning. The service here is really bad. We had the same waitress both times who just doesn't seem to care. I had been in the food service for years awhile back, so I know this is not the way you treat guests.

Both times I was there, they were out of something that someone ordered. It took a long time for the waitress to get us waters, and even longer to get drinks. The place was not very busy, yet it seemed to take forever for us to get second drinks. We asked for 3 separate checks (1 for me, 1 for another friend, and 1 for my friend and her husband) and the waitress came back with everything on one bill. When we asked her to separate it (again, we were very clear) she gave us 4 separate checks, putting my friend and her husband on different bills. When we asked her to change it, she acted like it was no big deal that she did it wrong in the first place.

First of all, service was exceptionally slow. They did have a large party on the patio, which may have contributed to that, however, we waited about 30 minutes for our tea trays to arrive. By the time they got there, the tea was over-steeped and cold.  The sandwiches are obviously pre-prepared and held, so they at least could have brought those out for us to start on while the scones were baking.  We were offered a second round of sandwiches, but those also took forever to come out. We wound up not wanting them anyway because of what happened while we were waiting:

A man and woman entered the restaurant with a service dog and were refused seating because ""the dog was too big to be carried"". Now, I don't know about everyone else, but I've rarely seen service dogs that are pocket-sized. Most service animals are large dogs. Also, under both Federal and State law, it is illegal to discriminate (and that's exactly what this was) against people who need service animals.

After we saw this happen, we told the server that we no longer wanted the second set of sandwiches and told her exactly why. Instead of coming over to talk to our party, which was very obviously upset about witnessing a person with a service animal being discriminated against, the manager went and hid in the kitchen, rather than coming to address our party. One of us did go explain to the manager, when we were able to corner him on a patio, that it is a violation of the law to refuse service and that we weren't going to be coming back.  However, he STILL didn't come over, address the issue or bother to make anything right (not that he could have - we weren't the people who were humiliated and discriminated against), but the fact that he wouldn't apologize, or even address us was very distasteful.

Never going back. Wouldn't recommend anyone else go there, either. Food has gone downhill, management is terrible and service is very, very slow.",SADM8dCUog0oGG8aYiy9pQ,8,0,1,S8LBvlMKUa-MXok31jCh-A

We sat down, took another 5 minutes just to get out menus.. Looking around, there were only 3 tables.. 3!!!!!!

I decided to share a cream tea with a friend. This comes with warm scones, bite sized pastries and mini sandwiches. The scones are served with some fab jam and scrumptious sweet cream. I will go back just for these scones:)
They served 2 kinds of pastries-a chocolate cake sort of desert and a strawberry dipped in chocolate. The cake was super good. I tried just one sandwich-the egg salad and it was soft and tasted great. The others enjoyed the salmon cream cheese and cucumber cream cheese sandwiches very much. 
Everyone enjoyed their tea. I had the darjeeling and heard that the orange dulce, and tropical green tea were great too!
Only gripe: Since almost everyone ordered the cream tea, they put everyone's order together in large platters and spread them in two across the table. This was a bit inconvenient as it was hard to move the platters to the people sitting on the side.

Oh, and if you share the cream tea service with someone, each person is asked what they tea they would like and so we were billed for the service plus 1 extra pot of tea, No biggie but good to know.

They also added a 20% gratuity automatically to each bill, which I guess is standard for parties over a certain number. 

Good weather and english's made for a delightful afternoon on the patio.

We had the champagne cream tea which I highly recommend! It's only $50 for 2 and just the normal english cream tea is $20 a person. I'll splurge the extra $5 for a bottle of champagne any day.

Our waiter was new so he wasn't very helpful with our questions but he was still very kind and accommodated any request we had.

So with the full tea service we had a bottle of champagne, tea sandwiches, warm scones with whipped cream and jam, and petite-fours. I am pretty sure you are able to request more petite-fours and scones but we were so stuffed there is no way I could eat more! Everything was delicious! For our tea we had the wild blackberry, jasmine, and english breakfast, we enjoyed everyone of them.

1184616,2014-08-29,1,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Sigh. I wanted to walk in and give this place 5 stars. 

Upon arrival, at 1030 on a Saturday morning, the place was dead. Us, one other table of two, and a table set for 8 or so that only one person had arrived for. The host gave us our menus, and they he turned into our server. Or at least I think he was? He came around our table the most so we will go with yes. 

After looking through all three menus I decided on the tea service. I got the tropical green tea by the servers recommendation and he brought it over right away. The tea was good, sweet. No complaints there. 

It took so long to get my tea service tray I didn't get it until the person I was with had her scones and her Shepards Pie. I mean it's scones, mini desserts, and tea sandwiches. I thought I would've had it pretty quickly. Also by the time I was ready for more tea, my server took forever to come around, and when he did refill my tea pot, I gave it the two minutes to steep then went to pour a cup, and my tea was ROOM TEMPERATURE. He literally poured me the water 3 minutes prior so he gave me
Lukewarm water. Really?! Aren't you known for your ""tea service""? How do you screw up tea? I was not happy at all about this and the situation was never rectified because he never came back after until about 20 minutes later when he brought us the check. 

The desserts were just okay, the only thing I had that was worth mentioning was a creme puff, and I'm pretty sure it's the ones you get from costco in the freezer section. There was a little berry cheesecake bar that I couldn't eat because of all the artificial chemical flavor in the ""berry"" and graham cracker crust. The other was a vibrant green macaroon that was awful. I had to ask the server what flavor the macaroon was supposed to be perpetrating and he informed me it was pistachio. HA. Funny. 
The cranberry scone was FANTASTIC. And hot. And the cream that accompanied was out of this world. when I moved onto my plain scone I discovered it was severely over baked, a dark brown color and totally tasted that way. I could only eat two bites. Server didn't come around for 20+ minutes for me to just order another cranberry scone.  The worse part of this was that after ten minutes of ordering my second scone to replace that burnt thing, the server comes back and informs me they're out of cranberry scones and the kitchen just put a new batch in so it would be 12-15 minutes. Really? You're out of scones on a Saturday morning when there's 3 tables? And it also took ten minutes to tell me it would be another 15? Awesome.
The sandwich later was hit or miss. Two sandwiches had just one piece each, and two had two pieces. Thankfully the good ones had two pieces. The first was something with apple and it tasted like straight mayo, and I was okay with there only being one piece. The second was an egg salad that any one of us could've made by mashing some eggs and throwing in a spoon of mayo, again only one. The third was a cucumber sandwich and after the two pieces I wished I had two more. The fourth was a lox-salmon sandwich and again I wished I had more than two. 

Overall the service was appalling. It deserved 1 star and has be debating if I'll ever be back. Especially the serving of lukewarm water for tea. That's inexcusable.

The food was so so. The desserts and half the sandwiches were nothing to write home about. The cranberry scone (glad THEY weren't burnt) and the accompanying cream were fantastic, as were the other half of the sandwiches. 

This place really could've gotten 4 if not 5 stars out of me if their staff paid attention. Cold tea water and burnt scones and ignoring your table just isn't the way to do it.",7gaRvYtbiBERgrQgAhPtXg,2,0,3,9-9JA-FEZ96Nrem-vFdGmQ

My cod and chips came with a side of minted peas, which were really tasty and made me feel less guilty about eating the cod and chips.",Y6GosB-E8CNVgurIpmFYQw,1,0,5,gCe3zXB7lWnVErrMG_K7KA

The beverages:
 beer pitcher-a four pint pitcher of english's beer $10-
by the pint-any of our draught beers $3-
wine by the glass-any glass of house wine $4-
well drinks-2oz pour with mixer $4-
cocktails-all cocktails $5-

We ordered the English wedge- stilton crumbles, english bacon, tomatoes, green onion, ciabatta @ $7.00 and the Happy Hour Fish sliders-three battered cod sliders, tartar sauce.  The English Wedge salad was refreshing and very light on the dressing, which probably next time I will ask for additional dressing on the side.  The Fish sliders were surprising good.  The balance flavor was just right and it wasn't oily!  The only thing I would critic about the fish sliders are the fish filets were a bit too large/thick cut for the mini buns or perhaps they need to get a little bit bigger buns but overall it was good and I would order it again.

I was also reviewing their menus and realize that they brunch at reasonable price between $8.00-$15.00.  The entire menus they have, the prices are all very reasonable.

   We arrived around 4pm which is a slow time for most places. There were only a couple of tables occupied when we arrived. We were asked whether we wanted to be inside or outside. The afternoon was nice so we sat outside under a slightly broken umbrella. The waiter who I think was also the bartender was good about coming to tell us about the tea service, letting us know what the different types of tea services, asking if we needed anything while we were thinking. He came back fairly quickly. We ordered the basic tea service which included tea sandwiches (smoked salmon, cucumber, pickle with cheddar), petit fours and scones (plain and cranberry). It came with whipped cream, butter and strawberry jam. The sandwiches were good but we were not impressed with the pickle and cheddar sandwich because it was definitely pickle but not cheddar. The petit fours were nice but nothing was outstanding. The scones were tasty - the cranberry being the best. 
   We were basically ignored for the last hour we were there. Kind of a downer. I think that English's should consider trying to get staff to be more interested in interacting with customers.

1535553,2011-11-04,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"My husband and I tried this place out this week using a Groupon we got, hoping for some delicious meat pie. I haven't had any since my last visit to England, and the sampler with its shrimp cocktail, pate, salmon crostini, and English cheese sounded like an excellent way to start our pie-tastic feast.

They looked a bit busy for a Wednesday night. Unfortunately, it showed, since our server was rushing everywhere, sometimes on our behalf, and occasionally forgot things.

The night did not bode well from the beginning when we had a scare that they might not accept our Groupon via the phone app, but our server cleared that up and we were good to go. I asked her if I could get hot tea instead of soda for the deal, which included two sodas, and she told me that would be perfectly fine, so I asked for an Earl Gray. Being hungry, I was a little bummed that no bread or other snack was offered, and it was a long time until we saw her again with an (iced) tea and even longer until we saw the appetizer.

This was the biggest disappointment of all--the appetizer had none of the ""British cheese"" promised on the menu, and when our server asked the kitchen for us about it they apparently looked at her like she was speaking Greek. But that's actually the part we were looking forward to on the sampler the most--and with good reason, it turns out.

Protip: if you're going to order pate, make sure you LIKE pate. I never had it before so I was not prepared for the paste of horrible livery meat-ness that came sliced an inch thick on a poor overburdened little crostini. My husband went at it bravely but there just wasn't enough bread to allow him to eat all (or most) of it. The shrimp cocktail were a little bland and could have benefited from a little more of the paprika they'd used to season/decorate it, although the salmon crostini was deliciously salty and creamy. But no cheese! Our server continued to investigate.

I can't say we weren't a little disappointed when our pies got to the table, and weren't pies. I had the chicken and leek and he had the steak and ale, but both were meat stews beside a mound of mashed potatoes and three neat-looking honeyed carrots, with three individual little cubes of puff pastry on top. Mine was okay, a little dry and would have loved some more leeks, but his was fantastic with tender, beer-marinaded beef and rich gravy. Still... we wished they were really pies.

When we were eating our entrees, our sever came back and asked us if someone had gotten back to us about the no-cheese issue... no one had. Finally she just told us, we've been horrible, so I will BUY you a cheese plate. That was so cool of her we were just floored, and she meant it--after dinner, a full cheese plate arrived, and let me tell you, it was glorious. I reminded her about the hot tea I was still waiting for, which she brought out right away, and we had a lovely dessert. 

At the end of the day, the food was pretty good, but the prices really exceeded what it was worth. Despite everything, I will probably still come back... for happy hour!",6sqRgMuw379kw4bIz44sPA,2,0,3,XwE386kU6Q9caf62HxByrQ

We waited over 1 hour to get our appetizers.  Before we even got asked to order our dinner. 

This was on Mother's day, and the most upsetting part was that the table next to us waited even longer to get any food at all.  It was heartbreaking to see that family disappointed on such a special day, and furthermore inexcusably pathetic that when the Mother asked to see the Manager three times, the final response was that he was too busy at the moment and did not have time.

My apologies to the chef; this food is actually really good.

The service is horrendous, they were clearly understaffed, and the quintessential bullshit drips down from the quintessential top - the manager who cowered away in the back kitchen, unwilling to face his Mother's Day guests.

We are regulars and locals. We have been to this restaurant several times becuase the food is good, but no food is good enough to be treated so badly.

If you have ever had a Mother you have ever cared about, don't be a patron to this place. It sent many a Mother home heartbroken, rudely turned out, and hungry this Mother's Day night.

When I walked in I was immediately judged by the way I dressed (Biker attire).

The chairs were quite banged up and ripped, and the booths had been re-covered poorly. The tables inside where covered in butcher paper (cheap) and the tables outside on the patio were covered in pieces of roughly cut faux leather and sort of clipped at the corner with some again, cheap clear plastic device. The flatware and glasses were spotty. Also, the owner was running back and forth through the lobby, swearing quite loudly on his cell phone.

As for the food: I ordered a burger mid-rare and it was delivered raw in the middle. The fries that accompanied were obviously frozen and from a bag. They tried to be cute and serve the meal on a small cutting board, but all that did was cause a mess all over the table. Luckily, the butcher paper caught it.

Truthfully, I didn't understand the bacon in it.  I probably would have preferred the flavors of the entree of mussels and maybe I should have asked if it came in the appetizer portion.  I couldn't finish the portion, that's how big it was!  But the mussels themselves were delicious!

*Cod & Chips- beer batter, hand cut chips, minted peas ($13.95)
The cod was cooked perfectly and had wonderful flavor!  The tartar sauce was excellent!  I would definitely order that again!

I would want to come back here for Afternoon Tea or Happy Hour. They have outside seating with heat lamps and a nice bar.  So you have some options for seating.

I would be willing to come back again and give it another try.",Ii1PkdRpONUNwKC3lmhl1A,3,0,3,YMwYFp2kVNYzgzzU9vL2iQ

The food was served lukewarm and you could tell that certain items like the beer battered cod had been previously frozen.  The duck pate seemed as if it sat in a fridge in a stockpile until someone ordered it; definitly was not freshly prepared.  Everything lacked seasoning, except ofcourse the pretzel sticks with the big pieces of cruncy salt.  Atleast serve mustard with your dishes, the sausage rolls were extrmely dry and if I had something to dip them in they could have been a bit more enjoyable. The best part of the evening was signing the check and washing down everything with a nice cold british beer because THAT is the only thing they couldn't screw up!  The beer was a good selection and the 50% off during happy hour is a great deal being that the beers aren't overpriced to begin with.",OM8vOwuwFQLZ9wH7eADDbg,0,0,1,LuqEAAZBlzcd8tVjjS30Gg

The second tier held two types of scone - traditional and cranberry. This was served with fresh cream and homemade jam. The top tier offered us a mini lemon tart, carrot cake and a blueberry sandwich cookie filled with cream.

I have lived in England and I have to say..not a big fan of English food (I'm not a huge meat eater). But when I came to English's I was pleasantly surprised that the menu has other items beside traditional English fare.

Usually I get the ham and cheese sandwich (melted cheese on top, yum!) or the fish and chip sliders. My boyfriend (an English carnivore) loves the Steak and Ale pie. They also have a pie flight on the menu- three mini pies paired with three beers...which my guy seems to love as well

As for the drinks, I'm a pretty big fan of the ""English pirate"", which is Newcastle with a shot of captain Morgan... deadly but delicious:)

Service was very nice- we mentioned that it was chilly in there because the front doors were open, and they shut them and turned up the heat (and returned to inform us of it). Our water carafe was kept full, and the server checked on us frequently.

They have a pretty good Happy Hour, which made for an economical bite. We had the Olde English, which was basically like a small pastry roll with sausage and hard boiled eggs, and the Salmon Crostini, which is a lettuce wrap with salmon and cream cheese. They both were very tasty little bites and the presentation was quite nice.

2138629,2011-11-16,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Been here four times now, and have had a chance to experience brunch, afternoon tea, lunch, & happy hour. 

My first experience was brunch. I was pleasantly surprised. Prices were pretty decent, and each item includes coffee or tea. I forget the name of what I ordered, bu it came with toast, eggs, mushrooms, spinach, and tomatoes. It was pretty good. Everything was seasoned on it's own, and everything went together well when it was eaten together.

Afternoon tea was alright. They have a decent selection of tea, including traditional teas such as Earl Grey & Jasmine - as well as offering some flavored teas, as well as higher end straight teas such as a Darjeeling Estate & Dragonwell. While I liked the selection of tea, I wasn't a big fan of the way it was brewed. It is loose leaf tea, and they put the leaves straight into the pot. As they give it to you, they offer a timer to help you know when your tea is done. The only problem is - there is no way of taking the leaves out when the tea is done brewing. Yes, your first cup of tea might be perfect. But the next two or three you can get out of the pot - are bound to be bitter and burnt, since the tea leaves just sit in the hot water, constantly brewing. Other than that - tea service was good. Scones were a bit too sweet for me to eat more than half of it - bu it was nice that they give you two. Finger sandwiches include a salmon/cream cheese, egg salad, & a cucumber/butter sandwich. I was a bit weird-ed out by the cucumber sandwich, but  maybe that's just me. 

Went for lunch this last Sunday. I got the Toad in the Hole. It was pretty good, but worth the price? Maybe not. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food. The only hitch in the day was he service. Pretty bad service. Our waitress was gone most of the time - it took her nearly 10 minutes just to come back and take our order. And nearly another 30-40 minutes for the food to come back. Spending an hour in a restaurant purely waiting isn't something I look forward to when going to eat. 

Lastly, happy hour. Pretty good prices. They offer $10 pitchers of their English's beer. The beer wasn't anything fancy. The bartender compared it to Bud Light, but it tasted nothing like it. We ordered he fish n chip sliders, burger sliders, & cheese plate. The cheese plate was a big hit, fish was alright, and the burger patties were deep fried. None of us were expecting that surprise and none of us were too fond of it either. But hey, $5 sliders - good deal. 

All in all, it's a place I've obviously liked, since I've been back 4 times in the course of a week in a half. I'll probably just be sticking to the brunch and happy hour parts though. Their menu is a bit pricey, and having to deal with the bad service just isn't worth it.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,4,1,3,BLYf0N2Viby3YVNFhR4sIQ

We have now been back to English's twice in the event the first visit was a fluke and have found the food quality to be sporadic, the wait staff to be generally unhappy, and the happy hour to have some items (beer and apps) not on their happy hour menu.
(And a 10$ beer is overboard)

Seems like many of the items have potatoes in them as a filler ingredient as well which I found to strange.....We ordered a cheese dip and it was mashed taters and cheese. Not good and too filling for an app.
They also don't have the live entertainment on the balcony area that brought us there originally. And don't bother to ask for a kids menu. They don't have it and the wait staff will get confused.

She is so helpful and willing to go the extra mile to ensure the customer has a great time.

The menu offers some items that you just can't get many places that I have found around here.  The pie flight (savory) is insane, the bangers are the best the sides always come out to perfection.  The food and tea service is awesome.  

The decor of the restaurant is hip, euro-trendy.  It isn't necessarily to my taste but honestly, I forget what my taste is for $5 all you can drink pints with my lunch!

I brought my nana here once for afternoon high tea. We ordered the ""cream tea"" platter which comes with 6 tiny triangle sandwiches (two egg salad, two cucumber, two salmon), two scones with jam and cream, a few little pastries and your choice of tea (we ordered English breakfast).  

The English tea tastes just like home (for me, home is Ireland) and is made fresh with tea leaves and brought to your table in a cute little teapot. The food is served on one of those tiered platters - very cute. In my opinion, the finger sandwiches would be MUCH better if they were better prepared - perhaps with more fresh ingredients and flavor. The bread was a little hard and stale and the salmon was dark in color with a less than pleasant odor. Now, the SCONES are what made my day and might be the only thing that keeps me coming back. They are served warm, dusted with powdered sugar and with fresh jam and cream, which make for great toppings! I could probably eat about 6 of them if I was feeling really naughty. ;)

I brought my nana back here for afternoon tea a second time, and we had pretty much exactly the same experience: the sandwiches were average/stale, the tea was great, the scones were great, but everything just had that ""this could be a lot better"" feel to it. 

On our second visit, we also shared the fish & chips, which were average at best. The chips were definitely freshly cut and actually tasted very similar to what you would get in England or Ireland. However, the fish (cod) was really soggy and lacked flavor. I don't know how fried fish can come from the kitchen soggy, but it did, and I couldn't even eat it. 

They have a decent happy hour every day and their selection of beer and cider is quite good. Plus, the atmosphere and decor is inviting and very pleasant. I could see myself popping in for a few drinks during happy hour, but I wouldn't order food.

I'm an Indian food fan, so I asked the waiter his opinion on their selection of Indian food and he thought it was great. I asked him if he had ever actually had Indian food before and he had not, which was a warning sign to me immediately. 

Instead of Indian, I ordered the tomato soup and curry and chips.  The tomato soup made my stomach upset and the curry tasted like stewed onions. Unfortunately none of my girlfriends were pleased with their food. Obviously, we won't be returning.",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,0,0,1,ZsN9MZr0P7EN9479tv5f1w

The dip is delicious whatever you dip in it! 
For dinner I had the (bun-less) burger and chips, which the burger had excellent flavor and complimented the cheese and peppers added onto it. My fiance decided to blend two of the chicken dishes together, that actually turned out great.

To begin, we were seated in the same room as a 'tea party' with only two empty tables - for the two of us and another couple (the rest of the tables in the room were for the party and full) and it was uncomfortable. 

We waited 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted, we ordered our food and drinks (non-alcoholic) since we had plenty of time to look over the menu. 

After 15 minutes, still no drinks or server to wave down and our food arrived. The runner dropped it (didn't ask if we needed anything and left) - not to mention he set the food in the center of the table not asking what dish belonged to who. 

Still no drinks, silverware or server to be flagged so we waited for ten minutes and finally received our drinks after we almost had to trip a server. We the asked for silverware and 5 minutes later it arrived. Almost 15 minutes we could finally eat. (Yes, we could have physically got up and asked someone, but that seems tacky to me). 

We weren't asked if we needed anything else - and next time we saw the waiter he asked if we needed dessert - after declining, he dropped the check. 

The check sat on the table, visibly ready, for another ten minutes until a very nice waitress came up and apologized for the delay profusely and finished the check. 

The food was cold by the time we were able to eat but seemed decent. I had the fish and chips (no vinegar offered or available) and it was just okay. My friend had the Pate and it was served in an extremely odd presentation with no explanation. 

Not one person (except the nice waitress, Viviana) apologized for their horrible and unprofessional service.

When we sat down I mentioned we would order tea then probably a meal later.  My friend noticed our waiter roll his eyes when I said that.  Um, ok .. you don't want us to have a bigger tab?  You'd prefer a smaller tip?  While taking our order he yawned in our faces and complained about being out late.  Then he got the order wrong.  We had to ask the waitress from another table to send him to us because he had long since disappeared after taking our order (she seemed very nice).  When he finally showed up he said only ""Whats the problem?""  We explained the order got messed up and he made a derogatory comment about the kitchen staff.  After about 45 mins we received the correct order.

We finally decided to just pay the bill and go over to McFaddens for our meals.  Once again we had to ask the waitress because we hadn't seen him in about 45 mins.  He didn't bring us water, ask how anything was, or show up so we could order dinner.  Its probably the first time in my life I didn't leave a tip.

Now I don't mind waitstaff who get casual with me as long as the service is good - I frequent a few places where waitresses think nothing of dropping the F bomb during conversations with me.  However, in this case the service was just terrible.  He clearly had no interest in being our server, which is fine, but then let someone else handle our table.

I would suggest sitting at a table being served by the girl with the tattoos.",4krT9JxgkdxLKo7slwOKkA,4,1,2,zslqG8QnWMJDEAbONf04Ug

Walking into the restaurant they highlighted some British beverages that set the tone as we walked into the quaint eating area and bar. The ceiling really set a fun ambiance to the place and it was a great relaxing place after an afternoon of shopping.

We had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which were curry flavored. Loved them! I wish I would have made a meal out of them because they were that good! For the entree I had the smoked salmon sandwich. It was open faced on toasted ciabatta, with a light pesto, cucumbers, and butter. Very good! It was a little awkward to eat at first but the flavors were delicious and it was light and refreshing. My friend got the Salmon Salad and it was a huge piece of salmon on top of a gourmet style potato salad next to some fresh greens. Looking at that, I wish I would have ordered that and after tasting it, will definitely order it next time!

I have been waiting to try this place out for a while now and I'm glad to say that I finally got to experience it today. 

I went out with my friends to enjoy the amazing weather at Town Square and we made a decision to eat here. We were really famished and as we read their menu (which was posted outside) we were sold.

As we walked through the restaurant we noticed the cool alcohol display in the hallway. The restaurant had a modern casual feel. They had a full stocked bar with a list of beers on tap and it was semi-open. My friends and I opted for the outdoor patio and it couldn't be more perfect to enjoy the view and the lovely weather.

Our waitress (I wish I remembered her name. She was super nice and always made sure we were doing well) was very pleasant and made all the right suggestions when it came to ordering our food. I asked her what she'd recommend for an appetizer. She chose the Beef Poutine and it was the bomb.com the chips (fries) were cooked on point and the gravy was indescribably creamy and hearty. For my entree I got the Chicken Tikka Marsala curry. I'm not much of a curry fanatic but this curry got me hooked. I wish we had room for dessert but that means we all need to come back for their High Tea.

We were immediately greeted warmly and found a comfortable ambiance and happy staff . We immediately abandoned the original restaurant and decided to stay at English's. From the ""beer flight"" I ordered (highly recommended) at the bar to the ""Knickerbocker Glory"" dessert ordered by my wife, the food and drink was very nice. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, although just slightly less attentive than I'd have liked. Located on the upper level, the restaurant was quiet and very relaxing. Outside, there was plenty of patio seating that gave you a nice view of the central 'park' area with the faux grass. The hardest part was deciding what to eat!

Skip the appetizer and main course and just try this Sticky Toffee Pudding. Rich moist cake swimming in a pool of the most delicious toffee gooey goodness and topped off with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Desserts don't get any better than this. 
I will also give them props for such an extensive menu of English pub favorites. I couldn't decide what to order! I wanted to try everything! We settled on the following:
Appetizer- Chicken Pate. The pate was a little bland. I've had much better pate, so this was not a favorite of mine. I could not taste the brandy so that was a bummer
Fish and chips- They should rename this dish ""A lot of chips with a side of fish."" Large portion of French fries and only ONE PIECE of fish. Really? I did enjoy the smashed peas though- it was different from having mash potatoes... but I couldn't get over the fact that it looked too much like baby food
Seasonal Fish cake salad- the description of this dish was very misleading. First off, this was listed under salads. This was not a salad at all. It was two very generous fish cakes sitting on top of some arugula (which ended up soaking up all the grease) and the generic ""leaf salad"" (arugula/tomato/cucumber) which was also served with the chicken pate. It was almost like they had a bunch of this salad already premade and they just throw it on every dish. The fish cakes were described to be salmon & cod. What they failed to mention was that it is SMOKED salmon. That makes a huge difference. If you do not enjoy the flavor of smoked salmon, then avoid this dish because it is very pungent.",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,1,0,4,MeqIv_zzNLH4XNAjJ9LL1g

It's our 1st time trying out their tea menu. We ordered the most expensive tea choice because we thought it can't go wrong since we never had it before which is the $50 Champagne Tea. According to their menu, it comes with 1 bottle of house champagne, salmon sandwiches, vege sandwiches, unlimited tea or coffee, unlimited scones and pastries. After we placed the order, our waitress came back to tell us that they are low on tea. So I ordered coffee instead. Then she told me that we could have 1 pot of coffee. So I pointed at the menu that shows Unlimited pots of tea or coffee. Then she said you can have 1 or 2 pots. The food came out. It has 2 brownies, 2 macaroons, 2 cream puffs, whipped cream and jam, and some vege sandwiches. The waitress told us that they are out of salmon and they are out of scones. I asked for more macaroons instead since they are out of everything else. She came back with 2 more and told me that they have no more macaroons. We complained to the manager. He asked us to please come back and give them another try but didn't do anything to correct the current situation. We paid full price and left. It seems like they are only using this menu to get people in and once you order, they will tell you everything is out. I made that assumption because every time when I asked for more from the waitress, she went to her manager and showed him her mini ipad which seems to me that she is telling him that we already had 2 macaroons and 1 pot of coffee.

I'm guessing it's because I never got that server/bartender guy from my first visit again. Yesterday I came for afternoon tea with a friend and we got the Champagne Cream Tea which comes with tea service, scones, cream jam, finger sandwiches, pastries
and a glass of champagne. I actually had two glasses of tasty champagne because my friend is allergic, so I think that made my experience even better ;)

The portions that you get for your $25 are actually pretty big compared to other afternoon tea services in town. Each person gets a glass of champagne, 6 little sandwich triangles, 2 large scones, and 3 mini desserts. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring out the 3 tier tea stand with the goodies, so we just drank our tea during that time. I knew from my previous two visits I had to drink it fast because all the tea leaves (and there's a lot of them) are just floating in the pot and it doesn't get strained until you pour it into your cup, so it gets very bitter. After eating the sandwiches, which were a little dry, I was already feeling a little full, but I couldn't resist their delicious scones, cream, and jam. Their cream is homemade and so light and fluffy. My favorite mini dessert was probably the chocolate one with a hazelnut crunch. It tasted like Ferrero Rocher chocolates. 

Overall, I still have yet to come here for their regular menu, but so far I love their tea service and it's a great deal. I'm not big on their sandwiches though, so next time I'll probably stick to the Sussex Cream Tea service and mix that with some of the small bites on their happy hour menu which is around the same time as Afternoon tea.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,0,4,mkRIkvdehoNW9n2IaKFgKA
2937596,2012-08-19,1,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Happy Birthday English's!

After one year, English's continues to improve. My husband (WOOHOO!)and I went to English's to celebrate their one year anniversary last Sunday. If you like them on Facebook you will see their Facebook Friends Only specials, and for their birthday, they had plenty.

We went for brunch, my favorite meal of the week. Since it was their birthday, many of their dishes were $5 only. Add $10 for endless Bloody Mary's or mimosas and brunch was served! I loved that their menu had symbols letting the diner know what was gluten free, vegetarian, etc. I love gluten free restaurants! The husband had the Full English breakfast, while I had the GF sirloin and eggs. He got the Bloody Mary's, I got the mimosas. First, English's Bloody Mary was hands down one of the best versions we have ever had. My husband is something of a Bloody Mary connoisseur, so when I saw the blissful happiness spread across his face, I knew we had a winner. After we told Samuel, the best server ever, that the Bloody was phenomenal, he asked, ""Have you ever had one with gin?"" Why not? HOLY CRAP FANTASTICNESS. The mimosas? Nice color, not overly OJ'd and not too much champagne. Perfect...every time.

Now the food! Bobby's Full English lasted almost 20 minutes on his plate. Normally he inhales his food, but because it was so perfectly done and delicious, he savored every bit. Eggs, bacon, Heinz beans, sausage, toast and mushrooms that made my mouth water. He added a side of hash browns just to make sure he was full. Loved every bite. The sirloin and eggs? FANTASTIC. For $5, I wondered what was going to come out on the plate. The sirloin? Slender, not fatty, not greasy, tender, moist, perfectly cooked medium rare, just delicious. The eggs, over easy (you can choose), when broken over the steak? Heaven! And oh those hash browns. Both of us loved those hash browns. They weren't the out of the bag hash browns or the diner hash browns (which are still good). These were freshly grated and YUM-O. Thank you English's for making the Ode to Hash Browns on our plates. 

The service? Samuel was phenomenal. He provided some of the best service I've received since coming to Vegas. Friendly, knowledgeable, relaxed. We were lucky because as we walked out, a large group of people walked in, so we wouldn't have gotten almost the entire attention of our server. We will go back there very soon and would happily pay full price for any of their menu. However...

You probably won't have to pay full price...ever, because they have a ton of food specials! $10 for Chicken Korma (coconut curry chicken dish) and a pint of beer or wine on Thursday, $10 burger and pint night on Wednesday, $10 fish and chips and a pint/glass of wine on Friday's, or even better, UNLIMITED MONDAY where for $10 you can have unlimited house beer or wine with a purchase of an entree. Their happy hour (3:30-6:30PM and 9:00-11:00PM daily)has 50% off beer and wine or $5 cocktails, beer and wine (reverse happy hour). GO TO ENGLISH'S NOW.

(Note: the Prosecco was not part of the High Tea service.  We added that on as a celebration toast.)

The sandwiches included salmon and cucumber sandwich triangles, egg salad on a mini toast and a pickled something or other (I don't remember what it was ... but I liked it.) 

The scones were served warm and just seemed to melt in our mouths.  The outside was crunchy like a scone but the insides were soft and melt-in-your-mouth.  Scones were served with a side of clotted cream and strawberry jam.  

The little desserts on top were very tasty!  In fact... I highly recommend starting with the dessert tier and working your way down.  The mini crème puff was our Favorite!  Take a bite and Savor it.  I took a bite and pretty much stopped the serious discussion we were having about what I don't remember but I remember it was a ""heavy"" topic and I just said ""Oh Wow!"" and made yummy noises so that everyone else stopped what they were talking about and took a bite too.  And then we continued on with the conversation.  Anyways...  The macaroons were quite amazing too!  These little guys are packed with sweetness so really you only need 1 little one.  Crunchy on  the outside and silky sweet on the inside.  You can ask for more little desserts.  We didn't but our waiter brought more macaroons for us anyways.... so we had a couple to take home later.  :)

Service was good.  Just right for us since we wanted to hang out and chat and catch up with each other.  Our waiter checked on us periodically and refilled our tea pots with hot water and cleared away dishes and glassware when he noticed we were done with them.  He wasn't intrusive and he wasn't in our face all the time.  So... just right!

Oh... and the High Tea with goodies... $20/pp + tax + gratuity.  I  think that's a good deal.  We left very satisfied!  :)  My guess is we'll probably put this on our rotation and do this again later in the Fall when we can sit out on the patio.

Our server was friendly, however our order of a simple breakfast kept getting messed up. We constantly had to ask our server for things he forgot to bring out, like silverware, coffee, water....After he apologized a 5th time, we just started taking this dining experience with humor instead of getting angry.
When we received our bill we were charged for an item we never ordered  and were supposed to pay for coffee, although it states in the menu that coffee is complimentary with breakfast/brunch.
Mistakes can happen or a server can have a bad day and I can't point the finger at one person, but it seemed as if the whole working team at English's that day (servers, manager, cook?) seemed not in tune and disorganized for a restaurant. What surprised me too was that it wasn't even that busy.
A manager did come out to check in with us but this wasn't until we were ready to leave.
The food we ordered was to our satisfaction and they have a special of unlimited $10 mimosas from 9am-11am), maybe one of the reasons we took this morning having brunch with ease.

Why is the new bartender not trained to smile and say hello to customers walking into the restaurant? Why is there no hostess on EASTER Sunday?

First and foremost....there is no reason to make a reservation because they seem to have a faulty system of recording who calls in to make a reservation.   I made a reservation the day prior however no record of this on their quarter sheet paper written by sharpie marker. 

Yes, of course I am going to make a reservation on Valentines Day when I have a 4 and 6 year old with me, so if you have lost the reservation then it is rude to act like I am the inconvenience and make me wait 30 minutes  for your incompetence.  

Actually one of the gentleman that was our server today was very pleasant.  However there is a female server, who I suspect failed to make the reservation, black hair, slightly overweight, appears to fail to have the facial muscle to smile but is able to provide a facial expression of discontent  who spoke poorly about her own staff members ""if you can't take the heat then get out..."" in front of the customers.  Very classy and obviously unsatisfied with her career choice in life.  She will be the main reason I will defer referring others to this restaurant. 

As for the food, remotely I remember the high tea was good.  The pasta was good, but had a piece of hair we found.  The burger left something to be desired.

The environment at night is pretty nice. We sat outside, the weather wasn't too cold yet, and so I was able to have a nice relaxing night with my party eating some appetizers and some real food. The inside was fairly empty and the lighting was dim, but it's suppose to be a bar I guess you could say, so it's understandable. 

Our server was really nice to us and even joked around with us, especially me since I didn't want to drink like the rest of my party. It was all fun, so poking fun at me wasn't a big deal to me at all. Our appetizers came first and it came within a good amount of time and our entrees came a little after. The only thing our server forgot were my friends' drinks and we had to ask her again for them and then she remembered. She did however keep the water refilled quite well, and I did not have any complaints there. 

I liked this place enough to want to come back with my friends. I wouldn't personally come here alone or with other friends because their entrees were priced more than I would want to pay for, around $15, but their happy hour drinks and appetizers were reasonable for me.

The food was good. 
 I had the cottage pie and it was delicious, but more than one person could possibly finish.  I tried very very hard. :)
My husband had the rainbow trout and thought it was delicious.  The iced tea was very good too.  A light refreshing flavor that I can't place.

A different time we came for tea, (the whole shebang...tea, sandwiches, scones, etc..)
I came with 4 people and they were all enamored with the food, the service the waiter gave (he had to deal with a picky older lady), and the way he just left us alone to talk, but popped over whenever we motioned for him.",-R-Z97qJK3E1S8lQSda8Gg,1,0,4,R75awUx2ICzrL0vOvitJwg

Caesar salad- expected a tiny salad, since it says $3 on HH so we each ordered one. It was huge. Enough to split. Needed more dressing & had a few aged edges, otherwise very good. 
Poutine was also very good. Liked the spicy bangers. This is one awkward dish to describe in words. :)
Ordered the bread plate, but were quite full when it came. Those pretzels with honey mustard were special, I would order just the pretzels with dip, if it was offered.

Our problem was service. Our server, Jenn, was really good considering that it looked like she was the only server during HH. I counted about 13 tables for just her at one point. Though I give low marks for customer service, it's not to take away from her. She really handled herself with grace, did the best she could and never appeared frazzled. Very professional. She was hustlin'!

Luckily, we were in no hurry. Took about 25 minutes to get water/order drinks; 15 to order food. Food came fast...I wanted to order another seasonal brew, but never saw anyone to order from again until plates were cleared. When the check came, everything but drinks were priced differently than the menu stated. I mentioned it, they ""fixed"" it, yet the prices were still different than what the menu stated. False advertising is not cool. I felt really mislead, so ya not a great ending to what was surprisingly good food.  

I just felt kind of bad for the server & hope mgmt can get it together. Could be 5 stars here! Need smaller portions on happy hour; as a customer, I'm not expecting a huge portion on an HH menu.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,2,0,3,M8CS3-tEbaK5KiY3FQx77g

It's not the Mandarin Oriental but $50 for a bottle of champagne, unlimited tea and as many cute little fancy tea snacks as you care to eat is a pretty fabulous deal. (The regular tea is $20/person so I don't know why you wouldn't want to add $10 for a bottle of champagne and some chocolate-covered strawberries!)

On a nice day like today, it is extremely pleasant to sit on their balcony and sip champagne and Earl Grey while looking out over the little park below. We had fresh hot scones with jam and cream, four kinds of little sandwiches (cucumber, smoked salmon, egg and cheddar/pickle) and an array of cute little desserts. The scones and desserts and accompaniments are made in-house and they are very yummy. And you can have as many as you want!

Last night, I came here just for dinner. We were surprised when we arrived and saw they had a reverse happy hour on Saturday night. As we looked around, we realized it's because they were four other tables in the whole restaurant. That's pretty strange at a good location like Town Square on a Saturday night. Happily, reverse happy hour meant I got a delicious glass of red wine for $5. 

We ordered a happy hour app, chicken lettuce wraps, and the steak salad. The chicken in the lettuce wraps was curried. The curry wasn't as good as I wanted it to be and the chicken chunks were way too big to put directly into the wrap. I had to cut the chicken down into bite-sized pieces. That's way too much work that I'm prepared to do for an app. The steak in our steak salad was A-MAZING! It's incredible how some delicious beef can make up for so much, but it can! The rest of the salad was just okay.

Long story short, this place is okay. Nothing glaringly wrong, and I really want it be better, but it's not. That's why they have four tables and reverse happy hour on a Saturday night in Las Vegas.",c2wGkrX311rMD9vUH23FvQ,0,0,3,G3Y_ESQAcVRIZQ46S6X3hw

There are different tiers for the high teas:

1st (Savory) - Smoked salmon and dill crème fraiche, parsley dressed freshly boiled egg, minted shaved cucumber mousse, cheddar cheese and branston pickle

2nd (Unlimited Scones) - Large cranberry scones and plain scones with house made strawberry jam and heavily whipped cream

3rd (Unlimited Sweets) - House made petite-fours, macarons, and pastries. Selections vary.

If it is your first time doing this then I suggest that you get the third tier since you will get to try everything. The parsley dressed boiled eggs, scones, and petite-fours are my favorites. I didn't care too much for the smoked salmom and dill crème fraiche. Side note, I've also had the Countryside breakfast and it was alright.

When one of my favorite servers is working, she draws cute, little designs on my teapot :)

They even do a children's (under 12 years of age) afternoon tea service which is similar to the tiers above except in much smaller sizes.

I have also been able to come here for lunch a couples times and some stand-out options are: Chicken Lettuce Wraps, They were delicious and it's a make-your-own ordeal. Bangers and Mash. I also had the most delicious pork belly entree with mashed potatoes that I cannot recall the name of.

3930942,2012-06-04,3,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Made reservations for 3 people for the Sunday Morning brunch.  Looking at the reviews you should see a common thread, the food is good if sometimes inconsistent, the service in horrendous.  Not bad, really horrendous, as in stupendously  bad.  Bad in a way you really dont want to use the word bad, it deserves so much worse.

We showed up at 11:50 for our 12 o'clock reservation we then had the opportunity to stare at the reservation desk for 5 minutes because the woman who was supposed to be the hostess was nowhere to be found.  Finally got sat down as the hostess was talking on the phone while trying to seat us, oh such spectacular manners.  After being sat down bartender came and asked us if we would like drinks.  Explained that we would like the Champagne and Trifle special.  He left our iced tea showed up five minutes later.  Our server took our order of the Sampler Appetizer and brunch items and then wait began...the long long wait.  

After waiting 25 minutes no sign of the bartender and someone we hadn't seen before brought out a salad...no sampler platter, but a salad...that no one ordered.  So I'm at 25 minutes no iced tea left, sitting on the patio thinking something to drink might be nice.  My favorite smarmy bartender walks by and I ask him about the champagne ordered almost 30 minutes prior.  ""Well you aren't qualified for that special"", now let's discount the fact that I spent six years in college so I'm generally able to read simple offers with no assistance.  My friendly bartender obviously was not that intelligent.  Explaining to him the offer and the fact that I did indeed qualify for it I would like it fulfilled he left, as he left I asked to speak to the manager.  7 minutes later out he comes...I of course still dont have the appetizer that was order over 30 minutes  earlier.  I get an apology and an excuse from him, I really wasn't in the mood for either.  The last thing I want to hear is ""Well I just got in"" a much more acceptable response would have been ""You should not have to deal with these kind of issues when choosing to dine here.  I will make sure that everything is taken care of for you.""  That could have salvaged the entire meal.

At this point I just assumed that Mr ""I just got here"" Manager would make sure everything else was going to be smooth.  I overestimated his ability to run a restaurant.  My wife went without anything to drink for over 10 minutes.  We finally received our food 48 minutes after sitting down.  Not bad if we were ordering something more complex than a filet sandwich with greens or fish and chip sliders.  Of course the side of curry sauce I ordered could not be delivered with my meal.  Instead I waited another 7 minutes for that and they still managed to still charge me an extra dollar for a sauce for my cold fries.

Generally the theme for this meal was the food was ok, when it was delivered correctly.  The service in case I forgot to mention it....was horrid, I would use a different word that horrid if I could find one that would turn my stomach dealing with the complete incompetence I had to deal with.

If after reading this you choose to eat at English's Quintessentially Slow Gastro Pub (I stole the ""Quintessentially Slow"" part from a friend of mine who happens to be a genius) I hope your experience is better than mine because I'm fairly certain it could not be worse.  I forgot the cherry on top of this experience was the Bartender telling me taking care of drinks wasn't his job.

Update- ** I have great respect for an organization that states ""Our goal is to provide the kind of unique and genuine sort of personal care and attention that our customers tell stories about"" That certainly was not my experience on Sunday as reflected in my review.  What also is not stated in that review is the spot note I received from the owner after reading my review.  Too often restaurants are way too quick to offer free drinks or meals to compensate for problems and layer apologies on top of that.  What I have found is sadly lacking is someone willing to take accountability of problems.  In this instance Jacob at English's has risen far above his peers.  Hopefully I will in the future have an opportunity to dine at English's and have an experience that I can ""tell stories about""  At the least I am now convinced that at least one person at English's understands and has a passion for the food service industry.",KAjUwkoKnVrM-_jUx5TKlA,7,1,2,PtHjgwPUWZPjXu8kcqoVxg

Ok....not normally known for their cuisine, I grew up eating British food here and there due to my English grandmother. 

Went here on a Friday evening for happy hour. What a great deal! They had multiple bites for 5 dollars or less. The hubby ordered beer battered sliders and chips (fries, of course). Yummy! Also fish and chip sliders were ordered. AMAZING! They had a special that day that included a flight of beer paired with traditional English dishes for 14 bucks! Each dish and beer was out of this world. Also the pretzels were surprisingly delicious!

The best part of all was the $10 pitchers of draft beer or just $3 for a pint. Also wine and other drafts could be purchased at a cheaper price. 

I heard they have a roast Sunday. One of my favorite things growing up was the roast my grandmother would make. I also heard they have all you can drink mimosas during brunch for $10. Will definitely have to check that out.

All of the servers were British or at least speaking with authentic sounding British accents. They all were very nice and accommodating. The outdoor patio was great due to the weather being amazing!!

I hope this place makes it. I loved Cana before it closed and had pretty good meals at the restaurant before that.",lg5f5JPxo6AjHz-EvW1hVQ,2,1,4,V5NDeUzA3FQdbVoseRnTRA

We got the Champagne Cream Tea, which includes unlimited pots of tea, the traditional three course high tea snacks and a bottle of champagne - all for $50 for two! That's a phenomenal deal compared to the Mandarin Oriental's tea hour, where you really are paying for the view.

Champagne and tea really isn't that bad of a combination. Over the course of the afternoon we enjoyed lots of little savory sandwiches (the smoked salmon and cheddar/pickle were the best!) and several teas. I discovered that I really, really like Earl Grey. And, since it was the first nice, warm day of the year, we sat on the balcony out back and got to people-watch at the little park in the middle of Town Square.

They lose one star for service, which was really quite inattentive considering that there were only four or five tables occupied in the entire place.

Additionally, the restaurant is very difficult to find, hidden behind a giant wall which is apparently going to become a Capriotti's.

Without reading any of the reviews, I thought about my options at town square. Johnny Mcguire's would be perfect, but it closed for good a couple weeks ago. I had already been to most of the other places, so I thought we'd check out English's. British pubs are usually pretty casual, right? Well, there I have shown my ignorance. While English's is British (quintessentially British, in fact!), that does not make it a pub! Actually, the inside is quite classy - tablecloths and everything. The breakfast/brunch menu looked pretty good, and we got the countryside breakfast (or something like that), which was delicious grilled mushrooms/tomatoes/spinach and scrambled eggs. The dinner menu looked ok - some typical british food like steak pies, fish & chips, and curry, and then some other stuff like hamburgers.
The happy hour & specials looked legit - unlimited mimosas/bloody mary's on Sundays for $12, half off all drinks from I think 5-7 and 9-close every night.

1.  It's small. The bar is small and their dining area is small.  Parties of 5+ will not work at the bar. 

2.  The pours here are strong. If you're use to comped drinks at a casino, coco beware. I had the English Coffee w/Rum and was feeling the buzz once I was done.  Keep in mind, I'm no light-weight.  My friend had their Expresso Martini which got her buzzing pretty good after just a couple of sips.  Both tasted like your normal British style coffees with the sting from the strong pours.  Delicious, warm, and also taps into your senses.  Stay thirsty my friends. 

3.  Both bartenders were the best. Eye contact, attentive, and great communicators....all good traits of a solid bartender.

""Eh.""

I had Steak and ale pie with mash, and he dithered before settling on Toad in the hole, and had his eye on sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Then the plates came out. HUGE dinner plates. 

""Looks authentic,""

He tasted the mash. I tasted the mash. We both declared it good. He cut into the sausage Yorkshire pud and put it in his mouth. I swear his eyes rolled back as he chewed. We exchanged bits of our dishes. We exclaimed over the taste and texture. We had too much to eat and couldn't order dessert.

I was hungry but willing to wait a bit for a good deal. Beers ordered, we waited patiently. 

So.. They are going for a ""British Pub"", feel but my experience with pubs of the ""British"" variety are usually a lot more casual. So here's to something  new?  I like the space the restaurant is in, and I enjoy the feel of the place as a sort of refined feeling pub. It is what it is. Theres a couple of small LCD tvs on a wall here and there, with soccer (football) going at what seemed to be all times. 

So we wait for our food, and as we wait they bring out a basket of warm pretzel rolls accompanied by a honey mustard sauce and some pickles. Very good. I loved it. 10 pm rolls around, no appetizer shows and my entree rolls in. (no appetizer showed up) I had requested to hold one Beef Wellington for me as the server said they only had 2 left.. I wanted it post appetizer. When I asked about it, the server said that the other table ordered on and she was confused that we wanted the pate as an appetizer also.

So.. mistakes happen, but it was unfortunate as I was hungry and wanted to try a few different things on the menu. So I had another beer and moved past it. Let me note that there was only one other table besides us.. 

Anyway, I'll probably try it again. Definitely for happy hour. Our bill was about $48 for 3 of us, so it was a nice inexpensive late night treat.

I had the burger with a side of veggies, my husband and the rest of the clan had the chicken and rice dish with rice pita bread and everyone was pleased with their meal. We all highly enjoyed our meals and the prices seem to be alright for what your getting, but there was nothing british about the food nor the atmosphere.

The sandwiches were ok...nothing to run home and write a review about, but the scones (which are all you can eat) which we only got the plain ones (but cranberry ones are supposed to be included) were good especially with the strawberry jam and whipped cream. The scones are fairly dense though so you can fill up on those easily. The 3rd tier of sweets was ok.  Macarons were way too sweet but the other two items were decent. I was fairly full by the time I touched the 3rd tier so I may not have given it a fighting chance.

We ventured into the restaurant which was mostly empty and headed outside. The patio seating area itself is run down, and everything needs a fresh face. Fabric staples go a long way! No matter, I was there for the food. In the way of drinks, my companion ordered a beer and I got a Pimms cup. What arrived was some sort of bastardized version of the cocktail I love so dearly. There were giant fruit chunks in it which were so out of place, and a sparse 3 or so tiny pieces of ice on top that were quickly melting away. The drink wasn't even cold. It took about 15 minutes for our server to reappear at which point I asked if I could get something else instead because I really wasn't digging it. He left the drink which I hadn't touched on the table (which means I'm still paying for it) and brought me their house brew which he described as ""like Budweiser."" He wasn't wrong- it was exactly like Budweiser but with that sort of rusty taste that I associate with English beers. Not a fan of that either.

So the drinks? Total bust. But the food was even worse. We ordered two appetizers which took 45min to come out. These appetizers were a cheese dip, and smoked salmon crostinis. How could it have taken that long?!

The cheese dip hit the table with a thick layer of skin over the top- already unappetizing. The grilled bread that came with it was tasty, but the cheese itself was gross. Bitter from the ale and bell peppers with no real cheesiness.. You could tell this was mostly a cornstarch concoction.

The smoked salmon was inedible to me. The ""crostinis"" were just sliced bread, not toasted or baked. The salmon was described on the menu as creamy, so I figured it was Atlantic, but it was ridiculously orange with no fat content at all, and was rather stiff. There was a thin slice of rolled cucumber on top which was supposed to up the presentation, but was just awkward as there was so way to functionally eat that. 

Our server didn't check on us again for a long time, and by the time he did we were ready for the check. We paid full price for everything even though it was all left untouched. Luckily since we were in Town Square it was just a hop away from other dining options.

4246292,2013-02-27,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"My wife & I went here for dinner last night, and we were both very pleased.  

As commented by others, it doesn't have the classic English/Pub feel, so if that's what you're looking for, you may be best going elsewhere.  I had read the reviews here before going, so had my expectations in check.

We went during happy-hour, which was great!  Most drinks are half-price, and they had Strongbow Cider, one of my favorites.  $3.50 a glass, most definitely worth it!  

They have an eclectic menu, both my wife & I had difficulty choosing what we wanted, as there were several things that appealed to us.  I ended up getting the Cottage Pie (pretty much shepards pie), my wife got two appetizers (chicken lettuce wraps & a cheese & spinach dip).  When the food came, none of our dishes looked like what we were expecting, it was a small bowl of cottage pie, the dip was a little watery, and the lettuce wraps just weren't what we were used to.  But we dug in, and everything was delicious.  While the serving of cottage pie appeared small, it was a deep bowl, just a bit narrow, so it was plenty of food, and I think I ordered the smaller version (from the happy-hour menu), which was ONLY $10!  More than worth it!  The cheese & spinach dip was great, especially after giving it a few minutes to cool down & settle.  The chicken lettuce wraps didn't have a lot of lettuce (not enough for chicken portion), and the consistency was different... but it was still very tasty.  

We finished off with the banoffee, a thick graham cracker (think of a piece of toast made out of graham cracker), topped with sliced bananas & whipped cream.  We added ice cream and asked for the hot toffee sauce instead of the chocolate sauce.  It was delicious!

Service - We went around 5:30pm on a Tuesday night (went to a show right after), so it was a bit slow in the place, though it started to pick up as our meal went on.  The waitress was very attentive and friendly. 4/5 stars

Food - Everything thing we had was delicious, though often not exactly what we envisioned.  4/5 stars.

Price - I wouldn't categorize this place as a pub, and so wasn't expecting cheap pub prices.  It is by no means expensive, just not low-end chow with lower end prices.  As mentioned above, at happy-hour, my cottage pie was just $10, and the apps were probably around $8 each.  My dish was $15 outside of happy-hour, but I'd say it was still worth it.  4/5

Drinks - We didn't get cocktails, just beverages from the tap.  Again, happy-hour, so we got great prices.  $7 a glass outside of happy hour is still very reasonable. 5/5.

My wife and & I have been out here all month, I wish we learned of this place earlier on in our stay as we would have come back multiple times.

were delicious, especially the Smoked Salmon Tea Sandwiches, but not going to give much credit because its kind of hard to make a sandwich go wrong. 

Scones: 4/5
best scones I've ever had, they weren't so sweet and I liked that. 

Chocolate pastry: 0/5
only one was given, and it was made from some kind of bitter chocolate that was spicy and it just didn't go well with any tea. 

Strawberry dipped in chocolate: 0/5
This strawberry was very small & it was also dipped in this spicy chocolate that didn't go with any tea. 

LUNCH: 4/5

I ordered Sausage sliders with English chips:
it was very delicious, the mini sausages sliders were spicy and had a nice bite to it. The English chips were very delicious, you can definitely tell they were made in house from real potatoes, very good. The mini salad was delicious not sure what they used for dressing but I couldn't get enough!

My niece ordered the Kids GB burger & British chips: $5 any meal 12 and under
sweet deal, it was 1 mini slider burger with British chips and a side of salad. Very good. 

Service: 0/5 if you WANT GOOD SERVICE, sit inside. The deck waitress was awful, rude and pushy. I felt like she gypped me of money also she must've been blind & deaf because she'd never see me waving her down or even asking the busser to get her. 

Over all I'd come back for Lunch sit inside but not sure about the Tea",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,3,0,2,ruI0AJg5ckOInJ44FkZltQ

Date 11/30/14
Time: 6:00pm

I don't know if this is a part of the holiday season or poor management but... 

1. After 24 hours this gastro ""PUB"" still has a dead tap
2. The restaurant is out of burgers
3. The restaurant is out of steak
4. The restaurant is out of cheese

Overall I'll give this place one more shot in the near future but I've knocked this down to 3 stars for questionable inventory management.

(Servers are polite, but still dissatisfied with the lack of inventory) 

More reviews to come....

Time: 7:00pm

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place by chance and it is absolutely lovely. Right across from Capriotti's on the 2nd floor, the food is reasonable, prices solid and it has enough of our interest to come again.

His shepard pie was mediocre at best. The steak and newcastle pie was more mushroom then steak. Also they ran out of sticky toffee pudding. Trust me there are much better british places to eat.

My group has gone here twice for the high tea. Both times because it's such a large group we get the balcony of the restaurant.  I have to say they're very accommodating because they allow us extra tables for our silent auction.
The tea service is nice. The bottom level of the tea service are the sandwiches. The cucumber sandwich is my favorite. The middle level of the tea service is the scones and I think the cranberry scone is fantastic the cream that comes with the scones is amazing the top layer of the tea service are the sweets. I have a feeling they are not made in house but I could be wrong about that.  Either way you can have as much of the top two levels of tea service as you want. The only thing they won't refill are the sandwiches. The tea is really good too. This time I had orange dream. The reason I say that I agree with the others about service is because it is quite slow and it's never quite busy enough for it to be that slow.

My friend and I were greeted warmly by the hostess and were escorted to a two-top by the window.  Very good service so far....but it was hit or miss after that.  No one came over to the table for at least 10 minutes.  That's a pet peeve of mine....especially in a half-filled restaurant.  There is no excuse.  Only after I kept looking around repeatedly did a nice British waiter come over and ask if we had been seen.  He was friendly but seemed somewhat overworked.  The aloof and icy bartender came over to take the drink order.  We ordered the house draft ale but we got a substitution because the house ale was looking a bit 'foamy' which was odd but appreciated.  We both ordered the onion soup which was quite good and was served in a reasonable amount of time.  Next came the Cod & Chips with minted peas...also quite good.  Now for the down side:  no one came over to refill the water glasses...something that should always be done especially when drinking alcohol.  We were not asked if we wanted dessert....the check just appeared.  I had my credit card (and coupon) sitting on that check for a LONG time before it was taken.  The manager, who was setting up the next table, saw the check sitting there at least 5 times and never bothered to take it up for us.  This lunch turned into a 90-minute ordeal which is excessive.  When we exited the restaurant, we passed the hostess who was busy handing menus to potential customers.  We both thanked her, she looked right at us and COMPLETELY ignored us.  She saw dollar signs only and was completely oblivious to exiting customers.  This is all too typical in the resort corridor but many locals go here....it's not as if this place was inside the Bellagio!  Despite the good food, I will never go back to this restaurant.  I wouldn't even go with another coupon.",6mTwT5zQB_JvwZ0IpxP3_g,1,0,3,6KmniQQRCDkq1lXf2KwzjA

Tonight, The hostess is also the waitress, server, bartender and cashier.  Later as we got our food, another worker came out to help with the same duties.  Maybe the owner because he was mingling at the bar drinking along with the customers.  The restaurant had dim lighting, kind of like a lounge type of ambiance. 

We ordered for our appetizer the cheese and spinach dip and my main course the cottage pie.

The Cheese and Spinich dip looked rather plain looking, but it was very tasty.  The My other half order the sausage link (can't remember the name) and we added that to the dip, and it came out 5x tastier!

My cottage pie was not a disappointment.  It got served with a side of honey glazed carrots and a mini salad (lettuce and tomato).  At first I thought the portion was small but as i ate it, I began to really stuff myself and was saying ""I can't finish it"".  The bowl was pretty deep.  The mash potato on the top was crispy on top, then you dig your spoon into the bowl to get to the meaty and delicious center.

I love the people who work here, partly the reason I frequent the spot. The food, of course, is the other reason. Here are a few of my favorite dishes, but I've tried almost everything on the menu and dislike very few items (exceptions will be the Posh Chip Butty - just not my cup of tea - and their Chicken Liver Pate - NO thank you!).

BATTERED SAUSAGES: It used to be on the menu a year ago, but it's since been removed for other items. They are so wonderful to still create this dish if I order it though! Delicious Cumberland sausages fried in the same batter as 'Fish and Chips' and served with chips and beans, SO GOOD.
POUTINE: Their version is delicious and this is considering how apprehensive I was about this dish. It begins with their delicious, housemade chips, sliced and crisped bangers (sausages), onion gravy, and chunks of Devon hot chili cheddar. The cheese is what makes it.
SMOKED SALMON CROSTINI: The ciabatta crostini is delicious, topped with dill cream cheese, the smoked salmon, capers, and ribbons of fresh cucumber. Light and really great.
BANGERS & MASH: These Cumberland sausages are just so yummy. Great crunch from the casing, nice spice, and just the perfect salty flavor. Their housemade mashed potatoes is wonderful - buttery and smooth.
LONDON TAG: Tagliatelle pasta with creamy, cheddar sauce, topped with Cumberland sausage slices and English peas. I recommend the smaller portion since the sauce can be a little on the ""heavier"" side, but still delicious.
COTTAGE PIE: Well-seasoned ground beef in a traditional pie with Lincolnshire cheddar mash baked on top. SO delicious.Served with a salad and honeyed carrots.
BANOFFEE PIE: I love toffee and I love bananas. The chef changes the base often, but it's a housemade biscuit and usually on point. Share it with whoever you're dining with and it'll be the perfect finish.

I've also been here for AFTERNOON TEA and ROAST SUNDAYS. I wasn't a huge fan of the Afternoon or High Tea, but it was a lot of fun. I can see it being a really great time with a large group of your friends. I didn't love the pastries served, but I did love the refreshing little tea sandwiches. As for Roast Sundays, I was fortunate to visit one Sunday when Beef Wellington was served and it was magnificent!

If you have a meeting or gathering you need to plan, this place is a fantastic spot. You can reserve the outdoor patio that overlooks the center of Town Square (it can accomodate approximately 35-45 people) or if it's a larger party, the whole restaurant since it's relatively small and intimate. The general manager, Matt, will really work with you to put together a personalized menu and with the bar accessible from inside and outside, it's the perfect setting! All of our guests really enjoyed the food and the experience.

Besides coming here for a meal, it's a wonderful spot to hang out at the bar. Think your ""neighborhood"" bar, but a modern space in the center of a popular outdoor mall. When my friends and I want to go somewhere nice and have drinks, but not deal with the club or tourist-heavy bars, this is it.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,4,4,qm99OKU21nCAhoAg-7q4NQ

Anywho, we got the Chicken Tikka Marsaka, and the Queens Burger. Both were really good.. The Marsala was very flavorful. The burger was kind of like any other burger. 

The service though.. Is why I gave only 3 stars. Although they were nice, they were so slow. I looked around and there were 3 tables in the whole place. I also work in the industry and I know I am pretty much at the tables at least a few times when we are slow. It was dead.

My husband is English and so I cajoled him into trying the cream tea here one afternoon. The service was incredibly friendly, so I feel pretty much like the devil to have to do this, but...

The sandwiches were stale, with that horrible ""old crust"" feeling. The scones weren't fresh, but reheated in a microwave. The clotted cream was more like whipped cream. The cakes were still frozen in the middle, making it pathetically obvious that the chef just lopped them off a larger block of ordered-in cake taken straight from the walk-in fridge. Thank goodness they had PG Tips tea to somewhat redeem this entire offering.

How can a place that calls itself ""quintessentially British"" pass this stuff off to their customers? I felt embarrassed for the waiter, who, being English, must know full-well how off everything is. Or is the whole kitchen quietly laughing to themselves, ""Silly Americans! They'll eat anything if we tell them it's authentic!""

The kicker to the whole thing was that the price for this cream tea, $18, was a per-person cost, not per couple as I'd (stupidly) assumed. Thirty-six dollars for that big of a disappointment bums me out even now, four days later. 

We'll be sticking to having tea time at our house, where the bread hasn't been sitting out on the counter all day.",u6-FTOyjZMQn50VnNtHVOg,10,4,2,M3Oc3fE3Sn7k_xuC5VYLVQ

One particular experience we had was, after taking our order our server came to our table just a little while later and told us that our food was given to the wrong table and that new orders would be coming out shortly for us. He apologized and offered us a free appetizer, we weren't really interested in that so he gave us a free round of drinks and free shots instead!

We were seated in the half booth/chair right in front of the bar. Not the best view with a toddler and sports going on the tv. It looked a little  cramped as the waiters/waitresses walked by. We opted to sit next to each other inside the booth and had baby in between us. Im sure if I sat across from hubby and baby is be sucking my tummy in and scooting my chair in so they can get by. I noticed they wall stand there and talk until they have a table that needs to be serviced. I'm not a big fan of that. 

We had a nice waiter (probably the supervisor because she didn't have a matching uniform like the others) she was great the entire time not pushy and checked on us periodically but not overwhelming. The only thing was she didn't ask if we have been there before because we were confused with the tea menu as we have not experienced ""high tea"" before. That was my ""uh oh ... this may be a bad experience"" first impression but she gladly explained after I asked how does this work. 

We got the tea first (kudos to not having to share the same pot or flavor) the pot was a cutesy one like I had imagined tea time. It was a plain white pot and they marked the tea flavor the cover. Wasn't so pretty, I guess. 

Then we got our sandwiches, scones and dessert. Uhhhh....I was upset at the sandwich. It was just a cream cheese spread and another one with two different types of bread with the same spread and thinly slices cucumbers in it. Wtf! I could've made better sandwiches at home. I was hoping for a variety in the sandwiches. The scones with the cream and jelly was pretty delish tho! On the top tier had cake pops, petit fours and mini macarons. That was just OK. 

I think they can do a little better even for the reasonable price. I don't know if you get ripped off as far as servings goes had we not added the kids tea meal thingy. She did mention free refills on the scones and dessert. We probably loaded up on the scones and left full from that. Cause the second tier was all the same scones. 

Unfortunately, my friend did warn me about this place but it was a surprise brunch from hubby. So I had no choice and didn't want to complain. I won't be going back. I'll be having my own tea party at home.",1TMET735B8WOzpDZtj3miA,1,0,3,Tb_ayrv-QQ7eTGrs_YcgLw

The flavors are there but the execution needs major work.

Sandwiches: very dry. When I poked them with my finger, u could hear the crunch. The apple/cheese was the best in flavor. The cucumber, which I expect to be light, was way too salty.

Scones: Our cranberry scones were good. My plain scone was overbaked. 

Dessert: everything was meh. The macaron was so hard I could barely bite into it.

Tea: the tea was nothing to rave about. 12 standard tea flavors.

Ambiance: we were really hoping to have a nice lunch out on the patio with our puppy. But the misters are broken (the rest of the mall had their misters on and we enjoyed that), there are no fans. So it was way too hot to enjoy our hot tea.

But we should have known something was wrong when we were not greeted for over 10 minutes after being seated! ....A simple ""hello, just a second"" would have been nice. 

When we were finally acknowledged and given some water we ordered the $50 Champagne Cream Tea.. Our champagne was brought out which actually didn't taste too bad.

Our tea came out, Citrus Chrysanthemum, which had a nice floral taste to it. We started chit chatting and soon the place started to fill up.. 
We waited and waited... and sipped on our drinks but our food was no where to be found... Everyone around us had already gotten their orders even those who were seated after us.. WTF... Then our sever finally came around to let us know that her ipad (that's what they use to take orders) didn't send our order in............. Are you serious?  She didn't think to check up with the kitchen when all her other tables' orders were being sent out before ours??! Finally a hour later our little 3 tier thing came out.... ""HOW THE HAILLL DID THIS THING TAKE AN HOUR???"" was what we were thinking... Everything was just about average tasting and the cucumber sandwiches were way too salty! Also, on the menu it says the sandwiches are served open-faced which would be nice so you don't go into a food coma from the carb overload but they actually just serve the regular finger sandwiches. 

Overall, what was supposed to be a nice afternoon turned into us being hungry and waiting a hour for some salty ass cucumber sandwiches.. The server apologized but she didn't do anything to fix her mistake or really even seem to care... We probably looked upset but no manger ever came to our table.. We were very unsatisfied and left the lowest tip we've ever left.

We continued to frequent English's and enjoyed the food (other than the chips coming out consistently over cooked). Sometimes we had bad service and sometimes we had food that wasn't so great. Just when we started feeling like we should stop eating here, they'd be on point with both. Well, we finally had enough of crappy service and mediocre food as of our last visit two visits.

Terrible service and disgusting dessert the second to last time we ate here. Server kept forgetting our drinks, rang them up incorrectly and wasn't attentive. Do not order the arctic roll! It tasted old and freezer burned. 

The last time we were there our fish wasn't cooked properly. We called a waiter (our waiter was out of sight) to ask if the salmon was supposed to be a dark pink in the middle and he said he would ask. He went inside the kitchen then came out stating that the chef cooked it medium well and that's how it is traditionally served. We then proceeded to show him the variance in color between the end (more orange in color) and the middle (more pink in color). He was about to go into the kitchen and ask again so we asked him if he wanted to take the fish to show the chef, he did. He came back out with the partially eaten plate, placed it on the table and said it was undercooked. He asked if we wanted a new one. We asked for a new one because from what we did eat, the salmon was tasty. He was going to leave the undercooked fish on our table so we asked him to take it. While we waited for a new salmon fish and chips, our waiter stopped by our table to feed us more excuses and support the original idea of ""medium well"" fish. In their defense, the chips were cooked perfectly. I proceeded to eat my cod which was slightly cold in the center because I didn't want to cause an even bigger scene. My boyfriend watched me eat and I him once his food came out. It was cooked well the 2nd time but the chips were overcooked. Throughout the whole experience, NOT ONE APOLOGY FROM ANYONE. No offers to comp anything.

Having worked in the food industry for a few years, I'm disappointed and a bit angered by their lack of professionalism. I hope they learn to take responsibility in the future.",qUFjYgA0Gfqt3LE2jIifGQ,3,1,1,xa7ivTr0Za_P0-ike7x86w

It has an excellent HH menu of $3-7 food and half-price drinks. In addition, it also offers special $10 food/drink combos on some wk-days. Its service is excellent. 

It has a mid-upscale decor and a comfortable ambience; tables have tablecloth. Inside are a very nice bar counter and a large, comfortable lounge/dining area. Go enjoy! - I did!!! - [BTW: Smokers have their own separate terrace patio.]

Based on fellow Yelpers' good reviews, I gave this English Gastro Pub a try a few days ago, after visiting the Apple Store. And it did not disappoint!
- I now have another nice place in to hang out in Town Square!

MY HH EXPERIENCE:

When I walked in, the mgr (Matt) and waitress (Jane) introduced themselves warmly, and led me to the gorgeous terrace area. It had an eye pleasing view of the park below. As Jane promptly brought me my beer, I settled down in no time, taking in the view and playing with my new toy from the Apple Store. For bar food, I had  Zuccini ($3) and Sausage wraps ($5). For drinks, I had Newcastle Ale ($3.5), and a cab ($3.5). 
- The zuccinis were so crunchy and tasty that I ordered a second one, with an extra Newcastle for good measure! The sausage wrap was only so-so, however. 
- The cab (Canyon Road) was silky smooth and full-bodied. I had to resist the urge to have another glass, which was NOT easy!
- My tab came to $24 (plus tips) - which seemed high for one person, but then I had one EXTRA drink and one EXTRA bar dish than I normally would, which had made me 2x as happy anyway - still a good bargain!

SUGGESTIONs TO MANAGEMENT:
1. Please include a ""List of Daily Specials"" on the table, or include an insert in the menu.

2. Prior to the start of HH, please MAKE SURE, that ALL THE PATIO TABLES are CLEAN! -  When I first got in the patio, I found several tables covered with some white dusts - an eye sore, but easy to fix! Waitress Jane apolozied and promptly changed the table cloth for my selected table; and went on to do the same for others.

Ambiance: 5 - I'm surprised that there was no one in this restaurant at the time that I went! Although, it is upstairs in a little hard to see for visitors & tourists. 

The place is clean and nicely decorated. there is a huge bar inside and a gorgeous balcony where you can eat. Or, you can sit inside and enjoy the warmth of the restaurant.

Service: 5 - The service was perfect! Our server always checked on us to see if we were okay or needed more water for our tea. They came out with everything pretty fast. They were chill about us staying there, so we took our sweet time ;) 

Food: 4 - First, the tea: I got wild berry tea. it's served with actual tea leaves and is very tasty. If you require honey, you must ask! 

The Plates: The bottom tier of sandwiches was really good!! There are. 4 types, but I really enjoyed that smoked salmon sandwich. 

The 2nd tier was the scone! It came with jam and cream for spooning on top. That scone is delicious. It's not crazy sweet, but light and fluffy. Actually, I might do tea service again just for the scone. 

The top tier was dessert. It came with macarons, chocolate nuggets, and a delicious cream puff. The macaron was probably not their best choice to include, but that cream puff makes up for it!!! 

Desserts change too; you may request certain desserts if they have them available!

DO NOT stop in here without getting the pretzel sticks.  So soft, so hot, so salty, so buttery...I think I could have eaten 100 of them.  It might be worth coming back just to get a bunch of pretzels and beer.

They had a solid Wednesday ""Facebook"" special that was a beer(pint) and a burger for $10.  I believe you can get a house wine if beer isn't your thing.  The burger was pretty delicious, but I thought the bun was a little to big.  It's a solid deal for $10 and a beer on the side.

I tried the cheddar mash as well but was a bit disappointed, not because of the taste or quality but just because it wasn't what I thought it would be.  I was thinking of a dish of mashed potatoes with gobs or chunks or terrific cheese melted throughout.

5278177,2014-10-14,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Every time I've stopped by English's, this little British pub has been a ghost town. Few patrons seem to frequent English's even on a Friday or Saturday night during their reverse happy hour from 9PM - 11PM! Maybe it's the location? This trendy little restaurant is located at Town Square on the second floor just down the hallway from Blue Martini. 

First off, I can only attest to my experience for English's Happy Hour. The reverse happy hour is a big draw, as are the appetizers that are priced just right. I've ordered the cheese plate at least 3 times, and let me tell you, that cheese plate is the bees knees. It's a bargain for only $5. It comes with around 6 different slices of artisanal cheeses that are packed with flavor. The cheeses are accompanied by crusty bread and a couple of dipping sauces. By the way, according to the menu, the cheese plate only comes with 3 varieties of cheeses, but I've always received at least 5 variations each time I've ordered it. 

I wouldn't recommend the chip curry ($3), and the beer ($5) can be hit or miss. It's pretty common to hear that they're run out of a popular type of beer for the reverse happy hour. Also, during my last visit, they admitted that the beer was not cold. WTF? How are you going to serve lukewarm temperature beer? We ordered beer anyways and sure enough, the beer was about room temp.

Service is extremely slow and like other yelpers have mentioned, almost nonexistent. Our waiter literally forget about us and we quickly learned to order 2 drinks at a time so we wouldn't have to wait around for him to come around. To make things more frustrating, the place is empty so it's not like there's an excuse for slow service. The staff likes to gather around and chit chat.

A longterm resident of my 'to eat' list, brought back to mind by our British server at Citizens just one week prior, it was largely an afternoon movie at Town Square that led to lunch at English's Quintessentially British and although nothing I experienced during my ninety minute meal is about to replace fond memories of a late summer trip to London the combination of tea service and a few UK classics proved quite competent in a room overlooking the festively lit shopping center below.

Seemingly misplaced on the second story of a mall, with a menu featuring several scratch made plates including everything from jams, gravies, and even heavily whipped cream all made in-house, it was just moments to 1:00pm that I say down at a small two-top near the kitchen door and although my blue haired server seemed a tad laissez faire despite the room being nearly 3/4 full it was only moments after finally having the chance to place my order that the first of two pots of tepid coffee arrived - the price included in the cost of $20 tea service from which unlimited scones and cream were about as authentic as it gets Stateside while neither the tea sandwiches wrapped in stale bread nor the paltry petit fours were worth the calories entailed, the cheesecake particularly awful with a sourness and texture not unlike simply eating an ounce from Philadelphia straight from the tub.

Fairing better than the majority of the 3-tiered service it was not long before a main course of Shepherd's Pie arrived alongside $3 worth of glazed carrots, and although some might quibble that the medium-ground protein loses a bit of its luster when so heavily browned I personally found the light use of seasoning and 'open-face' plating a breath of fresh air in allowing the natural flavors of the meat to shine, a notable lack of mint more than welcomed as it tends to overwhelm in all but the rarest case.

At this point informed that no other petit fours were available, despite seeing other varieties on tables elsewhere in the room, It was in one more cranberry scone alongside a second pot of coffee that I decided to invest and unable to resist sticky toffee pudding an $8 plate was delivered with hit-and-miss results - the house churned ice cream surprisingly creamy despite a flavor best described as 'sugary' while the cake itself was well spiced but just a bit too ""sponge,"" the exemplary sauce simply not presented in large enough quantity to fully saturate the springy base.

Proudly pronouncing their in-house production of nearly everything on the menu with prices far more favorable than Ramsay's underwhelming Pub at Caesars, English's Quintessentially British is undoubtedly amongst the more interesting dining options at Town Square and although no one is going to mistake it for the sort of cuisine being served at even the most pedestrian gastropub in London there is little doubt a good meal can be crafted here for those looking to scratch a specific culinary itch.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,3,3,EMPaXr8aZyw2kuXibKleDw

For $10, there is an extensive choice of teas, two large scones, some kind of cream, and jam. I am unsure of what to call the thick cream because normally tea is served with clotted cream, but I have never had it before. The consistency of ours was similar to a thicker and richer whipped cream. It was also less sweet than it's counter part. The combination of all the flavors was nice with the Tropical Green Tea. It would probably go better with a traditional black tea. Nonetheless, it was a nice experience. I might skip breakfast one day and go for the Cream Tea Service. For $8 more, it comes with finger sandwiches and pastries. By the time we finished, I felt like taking a nap, so I can only imagine how decadent  and heavy this combination would be. 

If there was one complaint it would be about how the tea leaves are floating in the pot. I drink my tea quickly and by the third cup, my tea had already become bitter. It had over steeped. It is nice that they offer refills on hot water. Having a strainer in the pot would have been better than giving the one for the cup. 

James, our server, was diligent and polite. Came by to check on us, but gave us our space as well.

The restaurant was completely empty when we got there an hour after their scheduled opening on a weekday morning.  We were pretty much given the opportunity to pick where we wanted to sit.  I like dining al fresco so we went out to the patio to choose a table.  What a disappointment it was to see that none of the tables had been set and that each one was pretty filthy!  I then picked a table inside by the window to at least feel like I was eating outside lol.  The heat was blasting in our corner of the restaurant but they opened the sliding doors to the side patio which made our spot more bearable to sit in.  Our table consisted of two uneven tables pushed together, so one of the tables was higher than the other one.  Also, there were specks of ""stuff"" on the tablecloth on my side, maybe even on the silverware if I recall correctly.  Oh, and for pretty much the duration of the meal, I got to watch one of the workers spraying and scrubbing and setting each of the tables outside on the front patio.  Couldn't they have done that earlier??

As for the food and tea, the only things I really liked were their sweets, even though they had the ""just came out of the refrigerator"" wet look lol.  I was told that the desserts they serve look pretty much like the sweets from Costco.  Well whatever, I liked them and I am never able to say that about the desserts from any afternoon tea place, Costco treats or not :p  As for the sandwiches, I really did not like them, especially the one with apple in it.  They seem to have different sandwiches on their current online menu, so maybe those are better than the ones I had, which were all just very blah (or terrible like the apple one).  I don't remember their scones being bad but they weren't memorable either because I can't remember what they tasted like!  Definitely not the best ones I've ever had or even up there.  And then the tea, tea is tea to me.  I got some fruity one but I remember not really caring for it all that much.

Service was fine; the rest of the experience, not so much for me personally.  Glad that I tried it, but I'll splurge a little more and stick to the places on the Strip if I want to do afternoon tea in Vegas again.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,2,gwFraln4LaNpTZDCgcwKNw

According to my husband, the beer selection is AWESOME! He had a hard time deciding which to order, I'm not that big on beer, but enjoyed a lovely cocktail called Hampshire Tea.

Good news is we left and had a GREAT TIME at Brio's just across the street and they got my 25% tip for GREAT service.,FO2lrn3Ii2GRkbUh0vjxlQ,1,0,1,zcnrJnn3-w1NC5l0_zP0kA
5528793,2014-08-11,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"I visited english's for the high tea experience, when we were seated our table was very badly crooked so we asked the waiter straighten it out. 

The waiter advised us to hold the lid to the tea pot because it falls off easily. It was very hard to catch the leaves, pour the tea and hold the lid at the same time. 

We waited half an hour for our sandwiches, scones, and pastries. The sandwiches were plain and served at room temperature. The scones were bland and the powered sugar made a mess. I also didn't like any of the pastries on the top tier at all. 

The atmosphere was cramped and the few waiters ran around us the entire time. 

When the manager arrived he started yelling at the waiters for no reason, then I noticed him drinking on the job as well as the servers drinking. He also made a drink behind the bar and then he took a straw and tasted it from the shaker, made a face and served the drink anyway. 

The regular food looked and smelled amazing, I would've much rather have gotten regular lunch than waste my time and money on the tea. 

If you are looking for high tea in Las Vegas try the Veranda at the Four Seasons resort it's pricey but well worth it. 

I will not be returning to English's for tea, I may stop by and try the food at happy hour because it looked delicious.",MSUWIPbEKGM6SFfZfsDHkg,0,0,2,8gT3UOy0C_Q_P3soiexfBA
5529362,2011-08-26,5,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Not sure how legit the reviews are so far but good job getting me to check this place out. Third restaurant in this location since TSq opened? Good luck!! I was a fan of both previous businesses. 

We just made it for the end of happy hour and they were nice enough to let us slide a couple of minutes longer to choose our appetizers. All the happy hour apps were $2 a piece. Pretty sweet price. We got $3 glasses of Newcastle Werewolf beer. Never had that before and it was a very good brew. 

Happy hour apps: 

We got the beef sliders which were different. The patties were battered and deep fried. It was certainly juicy but then again how could a deep fried hamburger patty be any other way? I prefer regular sliders though. Do Brits really do it this way? 

Got a mini chicken pot pie and steak pot pie. These were decent. My wife preferred beef pot pie with ground beef but I liked it with a whole piece of steak. Good flavor and something I would definitely get again. 

The chips were the most disappointing. They came with a curry dip that was too mild and watery. The fries were served so rare that we actually sent them back!! I have NEVER sent back fries in my life. And in a place that's supposedly British???? Unreal. 2nd batch of fries were acceptable but still very meh. 

This place has lots of promise though. The breakfast menu looked yummy and the weekday lunch deal could be a knockout. For lunch, you get an entree and then for $5 more you can get all you can drink British beer. That sounds like a heckuva fun midday! They have a $10 bottomless offer for mimosa, bloody mary's and bellinis for breakfast but its only for 9am-11am.  Still decent and a better drink deal than anywhere else nearby.  Their Sunday roast which starts in a couple of weeks could be great too. 

The English afternoon tea time is something that should be targeted to moms with kids or maybe guys that drink with their pinky sticking out. How about more than just 1 TV in the place? A whole TV schedule of soccer perhaps? 

I feel bad about this 2 star review only because the staff was really friendly and personable.  But I have to call it like I see it.  I hope to bump it up a star on my next visit.  I know I'll be back for the bottomless beer lunch one of these days.    

Conclusion: Maybe this is British.  But I like the Crown and Anchor kind of British much, much more with darts, jukebox, more TV's, the occasional stupid wanker patron and better chips.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,12,5,2,JWF8iV2gdzcnJ5ILE0xvJg
5599552,2012-11-15,0,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"Its Halloween day, all dressed up and decided to check this spot out in Town Square.  Once I checked in, I noticed that this place is called both English's Gastro Pub and English's Quintessentially British.  Once I heard the second name, I got an eerie feeling and chills down my spine (not from Halloween), suddenly recalling a story from a trusted foody colleague of mine about this very spot.  In a few words, she said, ""save your money.""  But like movie reviews, I have to try it for myself, plus a visitor is with us, so that's a good unbiased opinion.  

Anyhow, we were told to seat ourselves, no big deal.  We sat near the bar, close to the TV.  We asked the waitress/greeter/cook/server if she could change it to the Lakers game.  She responded, ""why, they' re going to lose anyway.""  Mistake # 1.  She then took our order, I ordered the Fuller ESB.  A little flat for some reason, like the beer was stored at various temperatures, unless its my taste...then that's simply preference and no ones fault.  Still, things are looking grim.  

So, about 5 minutes later, oh girl comes back and claims that they can't catch the channel because they have Time Warner cable.  Whatever.  I grin and bear and like to make the best of things, so we do.  About 10 minutes later she returns and reiterated that they have to look for the designated channel changer dude...I was over it.

Although, I must say when the food came out...(bangers and mash) it was pretty good.  I forgot how much I loved Cumberland sausages, not sausages in particular (no homo).  Thankfully, I CAN be a meat a potatoes guy and its easy to make me happy...not saying I don't like to get a little fancy at times.

VERDICT:  Aside from the service or lack there of, bartender seemed to be serving himself more than us, it was aight...Peep the stars yall.  Food is good, prolly more so for those culturally adept.   Peace!",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,2,1,3,U2pPGurNC9UCOD_rzN-VBQ

The first time my husband and I dined alone, and the service wasn't great but the food was really good.  I was excited to see that they offered afternoon tea on the menu, so I thought this would be a perfect place to bring my mom and grandmother for mother's day!

Maybe I should have made a reservation, so the wait is on me, but certainly not what happened after we showed up.  The hostess asked for how many, I said four... she sighed audibly and rolled her eyes.  She stated the wait would be 45 minutes, which is not a big deal.  We browsed around TS shops for about 30 minutes then came back upstairs to wait outside the restaurant.  The hostess stared at us but didn't say anything.  After 45 minutes, my husband asked how much longer she thought the wait might be.  She looked flustered and replied that she had forgotten all about us (I wish I were joking here, I'm not!!!!!!!) and that it would be another 20-30 minutes.  We left, of course.

Food was great.  Try the savory peas.  Perfectly cooked with meaty bacon and pearl onions.  I tried the sampler of their meat pies.  They were all warm and savory and yummy and comfort.  Mashed potatoes were a little stiff and underseasoned, but I'll let that slide.  My partner had the fish-n-chips sliders.  They were fantastic!

Great service, un-vegas, quaint room, great food, and legit pub menu make this a little gem worth finding.

The chef came out and said hey.  Usually this bugs me, but in this case it was cool cuz he had forgotten to include the mash with my meaty-pies and came out to apologize and deliver the goods.

We have been on a quest for NON greasy, NOT over battered and thick white slices of perfect cod. Well this is the place. The fish is accompanied by perfect crisp chips and a wonderful homemade ketchup and tartar sauce. The bonus is that they place a serving of smashed peas on the plate and they are so awesome! Our second visit (in a week....on the other side of town) coincided with happy hour so we enjoyed a great pint and cocktail at a very reasonable price. Topped off the whole meal with a sticky toffee pudding. What a perfect dessert on a cold night! 

Love the understated contemporary setting perched above Town Square and the NOT too noisy atmosphere that can be common in pub settings. Seemed very slow last night so I hope that folks find this place hidden in an alley upstairs at town square. Forget about the chain restaurants around town square and seek this cool little gem out.

We arrived during the reverse happy hour and were treated to inexpensive eats and beer.  They were out of Newcastle Werewolf but had some other decent choices.  The chef recommended the chips and curry, which turned out to be not that great.  The curry was too watery and lacked the punch that a curry should have.  Chips and curry flavored water was a better description, but that probably wouldn't sell too well.  The fish slider on the other hand was really tasty.  The fish was perfectly cooked.

There was one 6 top when we arrived, yet we waited over 45 minutes to even be acknowledged.

5862099,2014-04-02,1,mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,"This is a story of love and of hate.

I'm not one of those yelpers that has an okay time then dramatically posts how horrid a place is.  I'm a restaurant/catering business owner that is very easily pleased.  I know how demanding serving, cooking, bartending and the like are on people.  That being said I've always put forth my all in the service of my guests.  I don't care how tired, hung over, bloody mentally taxed I am, my customers/guests come first.
I've been going to this location since its opening.  I thought I had found my new local pub.  The food was brilliant, they had a great selection of beers, grand cider on draught and the atmosphere seemed very low key.  It could either be a fun little pub or a fine dining establishment.
In the beginning the service seemed brilliant, we were taken care of and the food was grand.  Each consecutive visit the service slipped downhill. I've had birthdays, meetings, I've referred people to this wee place.   Each time I've had people come back and tell me it was just eh, that the food was good but they felt ignored by the staff.
We went to the opening week of McFaddens, we weren't greeted, then ignored by 8 bartenders for at least .5 an hour.  We decided to go to EQ, the weather was amazing so we sat outside.  We were ignored, finally we got a spot at the bar had a pint and left.  
November past, I invited my friends to celebrate by visiting me for their happy hour, We arrived before six, got seated and were ignored for about 30 minutes.  As more of my friends showed up we moved to another table.  The seats adjacent to us filled, were ignored, and then emptied by disgruntled guests.  We nervously joked about it.  One, two , three, and when the fourth set of guests departed sans assistance, we got worried.  The two servers were taking care of a party inside and seemed rather stressed.  I eventually went to the bar and got a strongbow.  The night progressed, we eventually got our food, three orders were wrong and cold. We still left a sizeable tip for our party, and left a bit disappointed.  This place should thrive.
We had guests in town over the weekend, we offered to take them to the airport Saturday night.  It being a huge basketball night, town square was right packed.  I thought yard house would be grand to bring the tourists to, it had a 45 minute wait.  We were hungry and didn't want to wait for our food.  Despite us saying that we'd not return to EQ, we knew it would dead.  We were right.  We entered the pub, weren't greeted and found it difficult to sit at the bar due to one of the waitresses chatting someone up in the aisle.  We sat down and the bartender told us that we couldn't order food because he didn't feel like remembering our order.  There was something off about him. He was seriously flung the menus and other items down.  He would be a good fit at Dick's last resort, I could call taco for him if he'd like.  
He took our order 14 minutes after, he asked for our order several times, got it wrong. We finally got our food and there was still something omitted. Once that was righted, he yelled down to me to see if my beer was okay.  We got the spinach dip, a cheese platter, salmon pasta, chips and curry, and a curry plate.  The dip was like water, we asked him if this was normal and he said no its usually less watery. The flavor was horrid, like milk with a splash of beer in it and the consistency of skim.  He said he'd get us a new one, we declined it, insisting that we have to go.  We waited to pay, he eventually returned again with another dip, that same dip we declined.  We paid and left.
I see no reason why this place has such bad service.  EQ, if you need someone to come in and manage, cook, we'll offer up our services.  When we visit a packed town square and walk by a very dead English's, it bloody hurts my heart.  Also fix your ice maker, exposed condenser and open container aren't good things for SNHD to see.
