I just finished coming from Mcds about 25 mins ago & i ordered a HOT CARAMEL MACCHIATO & I received a cold & non tasty drink. I ask the chubby white blond for @ the window if she can heat it up for me (Not trying to be rude) she stated she wasent able to cause that's not her fault it's actually the machine that does the macchiato not her... & she is not allowed to freaking heat it up for me. Then again costumer is always right? 
She closed the window on me & I waited almost 2 mins for somebody's attention. Then she white lady with glasses that looks like the manager returns $3 back in my possession.. which is very rude & unprofessional because @ no time did i ask for my money back. Instead I ask if she can just make a cold ice macchiato since the HOT macchiato was such a burden for her! Definitely calling  cooperate.",N2J0uzWv6TgObiezrNwbdw,0,0,1,UC1IDw1pYfeTCblENbQkSQ

1455105,2018-04-05,0,QqrmTtv2OXWFRlqRCG4FRA,"Why do I keep going back? I don't know. I went this morning for a decaf coffee. After you order, up on the screen there is your number either under the heading of something like ""processing"" then when they are ready to serve it they put it under ""now serving"". 
Well my coffee was under the first thing, waiting forever. No one else is waiting for anything that ordered before me. 
Then my number disappeared. I waited a couple minutes, finally asked the heavyset latin guy at the register who was doing nothing where my number was. He looked at me with a blank stare. I asked where my cup of coffee was and he said that they were brewing a new pot. So they must have started brewing the pot when my number was next up because it took forever. 
I asked him why my number was gone, he had no answer. I assume it is because the manager or someone would know how long it took to get the order out. Not sure. I FINALLY get my coffee, get it home, open it to add a Splenda and it is only 2/3 full maybe!!! argh!!!
But I have tried to call the number on the receipt a couple times already, left messages both times with no return call. The message is very basic and does not say anything about it being a mcdonalds phone number.
Poor customer service.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,0,0,1,dQQmXxHUu5Xy0bI3DYZOBA

Not one, not two, not three, or even four cars.

3375168,2017-09-07,0,QqrmTtv2OXWFRlqRCG4FRA,"I am an ex employee there , I think they still have me on the schedule too , literally picked up my last check and didn't tell anyone I just stopped showing up. They are suuuuuuper unorganized, they ""try"" to make things better by getting ""top of the line technology to help us"" HEEEECK NOOOOOOOO it's harder on us because the managers start yelling at us about our times the new machines are saying. Like wtf tell the slow ass cooks to pick up the pace !!!!! Anyway, I had work experience at McDonald's before I started here, my first experience working mcds was cool and relaxing w amazing managers and rarely any complaints. But once I started here NOBODY knew I worked mcds, and NO BODY TRAINED MEEEEEEEEE!!!!! So of course I was a little rusty with the new technology 3 years later. So I had to ask how things worked. After I got the hang of everything again, they hired two more people and literally their second day they were yelling at the new crew people expecting them to know everything!!!! THATS WHY THIS MCDS IS SLOW AS F***kkkkkk because they don't take the time to train you. IN FACT!!!!!....... the ""CREW TRAINERS"" don't even train you wtf. Back to the unorganized part, I gave them the paper work so I can get direct deposit THEY NEVER SET THAT UPPPPPPP and I told them 3 times so I gave up and said whatever I'm still getting paid anyway. So after all these problems started happening, I asked a new manager if she can give me the 2 week notice form. And she said ""oh I'm sorry I don't have Access to that ask the other manager tomorrow. I asked the manager the next day, and she said the same exact thing. So I'm tired of working with dumb idiot people, so since they gave me a hard time working there I'll give them a hard time figuring out what they'll do without me since I was scheduled for this whole week  It's a petty move yes, but I hate people yelling at me for no reason just because this place is so unorganized!!!! Don't apply here unless you wanna get yelled at all the time, and working without getting trained ??",3moiVWKZUM1vZfOkMRWC9Q,0,0,1,nU600-OYoW9qyiElaRMpMw

3887254,2015-05-10,0,QqrmTtv2OXWFRlqRCG4FRA,"I've been coming here since I was in high school. They have quick service. The drive-thru is usually accurate. The ambience is fine. It is usually clean. The wi-fi works fine most of the time. I usually don't stay long enough to use the restroom, but the few times I have, it's pretty much what I expect of a fast food restaurant restroom- basically clean, graffiti on some stalls, and usually an unpleasant but not overwhelming odor. The customer service varies, but some of the staff (like the shift manager Wayne) have really fun humors, which makes the experience more enjoyable. The clientele also varies. The one issue that I've had is that because it is so close to Boulder Highway, there are frequently panhandlers outside the restaurant, but they usually leave me alone",nr2QuEyY_ZKicxnF4eCmLQ,0,0,3,zSxn62zIm9aZNvYIjEYkJg

And if you try to call to complain they don't answer the phone . There is a time set for items they serve like lunch and dinner items then switch over to breakfast but they don't go by them . Hey it's Vegas and it's a gamble if you are going to get good service. I would go somewhere else if I were you and believe me they are just fine with you doing that .

I parked and took it in to get refilled with new. There is none in the lobby but Kristopher apologized and took my cups and handled it very promptly. He was polite, smiled and was very professional. I was impressed. Usually I get employees that are annoyed because they don't understand that iced tea will spoil after a couple of days.  Everyone here was nice from the lady taking my money to the employees smiling and asking if I had been helped while Kristopher was off getting me new tea.

5538358,2017-02-15,0,QqrmTtv2OXWFRlqRCG4FRA,"This is probably THE WORST McDonalds I have ever been to. First, there has been 2 occasions that really upset me. To the point where I had to call corporate due to rude and disrespectful employees. Second, the process for using your app in-store needs to be revised. I have issues with it EVERY TIME i go in. I use my app quite often. I work right down the street, so I'm honestly there just about every other day. So, the app really helps with getting good deals and coupons. But for some reason, it always gives me a hard time when using it in-store. Third, the restrooms are gross and there are a bunch of homeless people and drug addicts using the restroom stall for reasons that they shouldn't. The employees know exactly what these people are doing in there, but they should be more aware and cautious when allowing people to use the restroom. Isn't there a policy anyway?? Like, u gotta purchase something first, right?? Anyway, lastly; there are always long lines. Which is great business, but my problem is, that I believe that a manager should go out of their way and jump on another register to bring the line down. I've waited longer then I should in line may times. while a manager who was there, didn't take the initiative to jump on a register and help out. 

I'm still a customer at this location because it's convenient for me to travel to from work for lunch. But honestly, they should really work on everything that I mentioned.",1suHppPvzftVc8MjQ9Lowg,0,0,1,Lk8ZDN8G0WNCHZQ5WlLkXA
