106704,2010-12-06,1,F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w,A couple of coworkers and I walked in here last weekend.  We had the pleasure of meeting the biggest jerk of a bar tender I've ever come across in Las Vegas.  ZERO stars.  I will never spend another cent in this place.,uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,1,1,bxxFHJgpEUNl2hodrS6zdg

On most weekends when i wake up,  i would  ponder what choices i have when it can to eating breakfast. This place was so wonderful it gave you the feeling you were going to your mom's home for some good comfort food!

It will be very hard to find a replacement!",shy7ROcRcCNdjf1PQRvZtg,0,0,5,FCl2zGB1TXd-xFnrodp49g

Don't be turned off by the decor or the fact that it's a 24 hr video casino/bar, too. The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and the service is friendly and engaging. Highly recommended for anyone who wants great food for a great price. It can be best described as a true local's secret.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs ($6.95), my gf had the Ranch Hand Special ($4.95), neither one of us could finish all our food. All in all definitely worth the drive over.

One thing to note is that it is CASH ONLY, however they do have an ATM.",ZyP4q4dpNuamc16dnPKjzw,3,1,5,qmZBy88T2M_65uvv_DYd6A

I was suprised at how small the place is but also by how well my breakfast tasted. Ordered the ham steak w/2 eggs over medium, hashbrowns and english muffins all for $5.95. Service was excellent. It wasn't crowded at 8am and the 2nd hand smoke was tolerable. I don't drink alcohol so I won't comment on the bar section.",STbBnK6lTbowg8jtSaYK6g,2,2,4,YCFE61iqBfukLKXaRS376Q

Food and service are awesome AND affordable; a rare sight in Vegas these days. This place has been there for 40 years so be sure to check it out!,2SJCPyIsoObe25zr_b7kkQ,1,2,5,IqpRNmG-lH9Nx-oz18T2ow

I knew I liked this place the second I saw the familiar ""Champagne's"" wallpaper.

Super cheap drinks and awesome bartenders. The joint is very small with a one stall bathroom for both ladies and gents.

The Sahara brew is similar to Budweiser and the Joseph James lager draft lacks impression, but for a cheap dinner/drink date where you won't run into anyone you know- Sahara Saloon is the place to be.",lbJd5Rg7_7DXar9FEIg-Nw,2,1,4,Kq91ogiPeYTYcLkvYToFyg
1122784,2012-10-15,0,F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w,I love the older Vegas feel and the old school diner with a counter to eat at. This kind of place is disappearing in Vegas and should be preserved. I wish i lived closer so i could be here more often.,P7LJK0xweoDm21lwDs-_Cg,0,0,5,tjE6LiAg754PxmsZISfJuQ
1871476,2010-12-03,1,F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w,"The food is good and the kitchen staff is very friendly but I have to give this place low marks for the bartending staff.  They're all braindead, particularly the old a**hole who works wed and thurs graveyard.   This isn't a place you go to have a drink and socialize.  I don't even know why they have a bar there anyway.  The place caters to the chain smoking, compulsive gambling grandparents that have no life except the machine in front of them.   That, and the hookers, who are ugly beyond description.",f6PLZ1rnXUArEQ9Ml2vyGg,0,0,1,rcBKHFN7lcLcPw7eJYnI4w

3400261,2013-11-05,3,F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w,"I should probably give this place 5 stars because I find it irresistible in spite of its truck-stop ambience, or maybe because of it.

 I have only ever had breakfast there, but apparently, it's open 24/7 for lunch and dinner, too (this according to its handily laminated menus which also serve as your placemats. Bet Joel Robuchon wishes he would have thought of that!)

It's quite small and always busy- so much so that you will probably get a damp table because they rarely have time to dry before the next eager party is seated. 
Service is friendly and fast; the are great about keeping your coffee filled, and your breakfast will be hot and fresh and your eggs will be cooked they way you ordered them. 

Mind you, if you've got a hankerin' for something fancy like quiche or frittatas or even eggs benedict, you need to go somewhere a little more upscale. But if you're more in the mood for pork chops, corned beef hash, or the venerable stand-by biscuits and gravy, pull a mismatched chair on up to the wet spot and chow down.

Chicken fried steak and eggs is $8.25 but mysteriously always on the specials board for $7.50. Most of the breakfasts are in that price range. On Sundays, they have a steak and eggs special for $6.95 that includes a Bloody Mary. Hell, yeah! For that price, I could almost enjoy the stupid football game they always have playing on tv!",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,5,3,4,FYyLeJ3UaIhN9liHDuoxqQ

I have let them know that they a lot of locals we be very upset, I have been going there for about 17 years or more and will truly miss this Diamond find, my kids and friend love this place as well! :(   Now I have to find another spot, but don't think it will be anything like the Sahara Saloon!!

The older waitress was handling the whole place cafe and they were quite busy. She took a bit to take my order. I went with the Marlboro Man breakfast - two pork chops, biscuits & gravy, hash browns and two eggs.  The chops were tender and contained  just the right amount of fat on the edges for added flavor. Biscuits and gravy were awesome and the hash brown were brown and crispy.  As you can see the portion was so large the eggs had to go on another plate.

I'll definitely be returning here again!",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,0,0,4,FQvczPzQf093UYkTECbQ2w

The waitresses are all super nice and call you hon. EverytimeI come here I kinda feel like I am in a Coen brothers movie and Steve Buscemi is waiting outside to whack me. The clientele is an eclectic bunch. One time a guy was wearing a Cats costume and a lot of truckers come in too. But everybody is real friendly. And they serve cheap food and alcohol. It serves its purpose.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,5,2,3,EOuU5rjacFhK7HLV_QE62Q

4656239,2009-01-15,3,F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w,"Apparently, this place is way more off the beaten path than I could have imagined, since when I went to look up the info to do this review, it failed to register. That notwithstanding, it IS there, really.

How do I know? I've visited this cozy little spot for the last 10 years, every time I and my reality Check Tv cohorts roll into town. We stay at RCTV HQ off the Strip, (aka Mel's Place), which is about 3-5 minutes away by car on Sahara Ave., near Boulder Hwy. There's a zillion car dealerships along the street, so head away from the Strip towards Boulder, and it's on the right, with a Walgreen's right next to it.

In any event, the restaurant caters to an older, old-school Vegas crowd, and has both a coffee shop and full bar, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner 24 hours a day. DDDanny's Dad, the aforementioned Mel, turned us on to this joint, which has the cheapest grub and drinks in town. A Sam Adams on draft is a mere $2.25, and breakfasts run from 3.95 to about 8 bux, with generous portions that even Danny sometimes can't chow down. There's awesome pancakes, a variety of egg dishes, great combos, and a big ol' burger with fries for only $4.95.

Not only that, but it's all served up cheerfully by a very sweet bunch of ladies, who know our host Mel very well, and by now have come to expect our yearly visits.

All that being said, it's not for the diet conscious. It's good, hearty and greasy--perfect to buck up after a wild late nite drinking and debauchery session, which we often have while visiting during the annual AVN Awards/ Adult Entertainment Expo.",W_Rslro-7kRSGTcofKcwog,6,4,5,jxN0uz6FYC4tR0xSp_KA6A
5325188,2011-08-15,0,F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w,"the place is small. Sometimes full of smoke and definitely not fancy at all... Its actually not very appealing being on the corner of sahara and boulder near all the dealerships....but if your looking for great comfort food like meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Pot roast. Chicken fried steak etc... This is the place !!! They have great specials everyday for about $6 u get a huge meal that includes salad or soup. I suggest the soup...love their clam chowder!!!!    The staff is nice... 
Quick tip... During lunch it gets packed!!! So be prepared to stand and wait or go at an off time.  

Only cash is accepted but they do have an atm there.",zsJLk34mTDMyuVS_EaBLxw,0,0,5,byVziPUba7XPu4GvWyxghA
