I don't know what his problem was but we will never come back to this the bar again.,oKhpMYvIntENZ5UzuoZWUg,1,0,1,Wx_m78WjZEm5VInYpgqp2Q

However, upon seeing the $7.99 all you can eat taco special on the marquee, I came to Cabo instead.  It was not busy and I was seated immediately.  I waited a couple of minutes for my iced tea and chips and salsa to come out all the while knowing what I was going to order.  The waiter took my order and a few minutes late my food arrived.  It was fast.  Almost too fast.  It made me question the freshness of the food.  But the black beans were great.  And I am glad they offer a black bean option, by the way.  The rice was good as well.  As for the tacos, I started with one each, chicken, shredded beef, and ground beef.  The first bite led to my ground beef taco exploding in my hand and dipping down to my elbow.  The sign of a good taco in my book.  Despite the generic spiced beef and pre-made crunchy corn tortilla shell, this was still a good taco.  The shredded beef was not as good, actually.  Too fatty for my liking.  The chicken was a close second behind the ground beef.  Had I been able to squeeze a wedge of lime on it or if it had more flavor to begin with, the chicken taco would have been my favorite of the evening.  Still, it was good so I ordred one more chicken and one more ground beef.  They came up as quickly as the first three did.  And by the end of the evening, I was thankful for the speedy service as the movie I was seeing started less than an hour after I first arrived.  Good service, a good deal, and acceptable food started the night off right.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,1,4,TCgPC45R2lG7Jb7r7CNEbg

I have walked by it several times but today was the first time I decided to dine there solo on a whim, I am glad I did.  

Seated immediately, all the staff were very nice and the food was super fast.  Chips with dip and water were prompt. Granted it was not busy while I was there (around 4:30).  I ordered a quesadilla and it arrived before my drink!  Very fast. The chicken quesadilla was pretty good.  I recommend it, the drink not so much.  It was a corona margarita where they tip a beer into a margarita and it is held inverted to drain as you drink.   Interesting for sure, never seen such a thing so I wanted to try it.  Maybe some people like it but not my thing, that's really not their fault. 

Overall it was great.  I will definitely be back, next time with someone else to try more stuff even if I am not gambling.",BY45YF-_MrVSwbqMpCXVPQ,0,0,4,Iem9uMNBWbE0ya4YL_BXcQ
