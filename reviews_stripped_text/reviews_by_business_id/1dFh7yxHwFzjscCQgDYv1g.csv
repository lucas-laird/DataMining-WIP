You pick your type of lettuce,spinach, or romaine then you can either pick a salad that is on the menu or create your own with all the toppings including but not limited too nuts, berries,dressings,crutons, Veggies,Jalepeno, pepperchinis... etc.!!  Plus the staff mixes it all up for you with these great tools that i have never seen before . I always ask for the dressing on the side because then you can take it home and use it for your own salad.  I would recommend the raspberry dressing it is so YUMMY!!! 

A large which is served in a very cute fun bowl, is about $8 and wow you get so stuffed off of the meal!  
 
All in all AMAZING taste and presentation! :D",y-dpL5Iun_Drej8DFGfAgg,1,0,5,nbUXHupV1-wt7kUMlKGXRw

I ordered the Balsamic Orange and Bleu with Wild Alaskan salmon ($10.50 with the salmon, which was $3.50).  As a carnivore, I have to say that this was a darn tasty salad.  The leaf was a mixed green concoction, along with edamame as a replacement for almonds.  The bleu cheese was the perfect amount, and same with the salmon.  Everything tasted fresh, and they chop it up really good so everything is mixed in.  The balsamic sauce gave the salad a light sweet flavor that I enjoyed.  The full size salad was a pretty good portion too.

I am definitely coming back here the next time I feel like a salad.  It really beat out the Ruby Tuesday salad bar down the street from my work.  Sure, it took me 20 minutes to get here, but it was worth it!  Salad Creations rocks!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,1,1,4,3aOicvuaX2A6y1xecsU2xA
4013777,2011-07-01,1,1dFh7yxHwFzjscCQgDYv1g,"Salad Creations...should be called ""Gourmet Salads"".  

Fresh, Healthy, Tasty, Filling, Satisfying, AND you get it the way you want it.  Peace-Love-and-Happiness...it's all there.

Four different sets of ""green leaves"" - Romain, Iceburg, Spinach, or Spring MIx.
Endless array of typical and NON-typical throw-ins.
I can't even remember how many different dressings were available.

You can order from the menu, tweak what they've got, or start from scratch.   Do you feel like a traditional salad bowl, ""wrapping"" it up, or panini-izing it?  You choose. 

Went today.  Took the fam.  Kid gobbled her salad wrap DOWN!  Yes, she actually loved the taste of eating healthy.  

See you tomorrow for lunch, Gourmet.....I mean Salad Creations!",WkIB83EfRZX6kNJk2eHVcw,2,2,5,6MyuTQwdFW3wwZyTqRMfgQ

Lots of leafy greens instead of a big juicy cheeseburger once in a while is just one element to a longer life. 
Now, I'm sure not all the salad dressings or additives are healthy but you're always in control of what you want in your salad. I really enjoy salads so this place was right down my alley.
I got an Asian Chicken Salad with wontons & edamame and keep in mind that the smallest size isn't small at all - just look at my pics.
My co-worker got a salmon salad with mandarin oranges - now that looked good. 
This was my first time here so I need to try other things to  have a true feeling about this place. I do plan on ordering a panini the next time I go.
I think the prices are a bit high for salad. They should add fresh baked bread to their menu to accompany the salads. I'll let you know how the panini tasted.....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,1,1,3,4s3wQmwiza1ZBXBH-FSSqA
4290837,2011-03-12,0,1dFh7yxHwFzjscCQgDYv1g,"Well in the past week I've had two salads and a panini. I had bought two Groupon coupons and was very excited to try this.   I didn't have a problem with the price but with the quality and taste.  Really,it's hard to screw up a salad, or a sandwich but nothing was very appetizing and actually threw most of my last salad away.",d15dRxWJ-_2baW2Ch1YPeQ,0,0,1,uUlm40fcqakbZy-1lqcDIg
