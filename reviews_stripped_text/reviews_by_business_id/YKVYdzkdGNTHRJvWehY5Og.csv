Waitress was prompt to greet me and I began looking at the menu. The place is small because we are in an airport and I made the mistake of sitting near the door (it was seat yourself and the pickings were slim). I got hit several times by people and their luggage. 

The menu looked well enough and I decided to have something small. I picked an order chile lime wings. They arrived and it wasn't how I imagined. It said they were served on a Mexican salad but I didn't expect pickled cabbage and carrots as well as fresh spinach. The wings were also served with sour cream. I decided to give it a try but by wing three I realized they were still covered in feathers and that what I thought was just crunchy gristle on the second was actually feathers. I showed my waitress who apologized and offered to get me a new plate but I was too grossed out and declined. There was no manager on duty.

I got the Cuban sandwich. It arrived luke warm and very greasy. The bread was also really heavy and a bit stale. The ""kicked up"" fries were cold and pretty bland.
On an even more subjective note, the music got worse as the meal wore on and I didn't hear a single Van Halen track. The final blow was the outrageous bill. I had no idea you could charge over $13 for the most flavorless weak Margarita in Vegas. Totally on me for not checking which is how I pretty much felt about the whole meal.

My husband got the Sammy Big Beach Burger. Pretty good too. Nice crispy onion strings layered with guacamole, tomatoes, queso fresco and bacon. The bun was nice, soft and chewy. 

I got the Baja Quesadilla with Shrimp, pretty good too. Nice plump shrimp and delicious jalapeño crema. It was served with pico de gallo. 

The fries here are actually really good, it's not your traditional plain fries, they have a BBQ like seasoning on them. 

Our server was actually really nice too and timely. He was a little awkward but overall we enjoyed our visit. The price was high, my Golden Tiki drink was over $14. I do not recommend it at all. Not worth $14.

My wife had ordered some nachos. 20 minutes later, we noticed food sitting in the window. Our server was busy chatting with the other servers in the corner of the restaurant. 
10 minutes later, I walked over to our server and told him to cancel our order. He tried to tell me that our food was ready to go out. I told him if it was the food that had been sitting in the window for 10 minutes, we weren't interested.

2239353,2016-03-24,2,YKVYdzkdGNTHRJvWehY5Og,"Airport restaurant to the rescue. I am curious to see if there is a 4-5 star airport restaurant in the US. So, that explains my experience here at Sammy's, just ok. This restaurant is in the C gate area. I believe that is just for Southwest. Seating for those under 21 must be seated in the back, away from the bar or bar top areas. Seating back there is tight and few seating options. We struggled to find a seat to then be able to sit down to a dirty table. The waitress didn't come by for at least 10 minutes but that gave us time to get our order together. I started with Sammy's Mai Tai that was stiff. They must have been distracted when pouring, wow. Just the way I like it. We ordered the beach nachos that came with chicken. It had melted cheese that tasted like cheese-wiz, yes I said it. It had canned green chilies and a few other non noticeable toppings. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had some good flavor. That was the highlight. I dreaded even ordering these as I am sure my stomach will hate me later. I am not dying to return but may accidentally not remembering that we ate here.

I'm surprised Sammy would put his name on a restaurant most people just walk by on the way to their gate.  

With that said we had the following:

Chips and salsa with guac & Sammy's big beach burger.

The chips were the out of the bag kind - not so good.  Salsa - no bueno and the guac - well whatever bag it came out of the shelf life on it was probably 50 years.

For the burger - it was actually pretty good.  They only will cook to 'medium done'  but it was tasty seasoned well, wasn't so huge it came apart on the first bit.  I can recommend the burger.

The staff that Saturday evening was pleasant and they have 4 or so micro brews on tap.

It has a long bar, naturally as its Vegas, and then lots of little crammed in tables in booths with barely any room. 

My server was nice enough to point out a few things she thought I could have. There wasn't a lot of confidence as to what was and wasn't gluten free. She asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos. They said yes but in retrospect I probably should have been more careful cause I could hear there was a pretty significant language barrier. 

So I did go with the nachos which were pretty good. Chicken and a cilantro sauce along with the nacho cheese and jalapeños. There was a pretty good sized portion and I took some in a box with me for later. I never did end up feeling sick so I think the nachos are a safe bet here.

Other notes, I did hear another customer complain of dirty silverware, mine was ok. Food came out in good time but not a lot of server attention in regards to filling water glasses or getting you anything else you might need. Price was pretty average for airport food.

As I found an open seat at a communal table, I made myself comfortable.  Which was a good idea, since despite making eye contact with the server several times, it took her almost ten minutes to get over to me.  I saw that she was busy, but in the time I was there, she immediately spoke to a well-dressed business man as he was being seated.  (Tip deduction-normally, I tip 20%, reduced to 15% to show my displeasure.)

They didn't have the Pinot Gris listed on the menu, only one other for $3 more.  Fine.

I ordered the $12 grilled chicken sandwich because $17 for nachos seems crazy to me and I decided that since I wasn't likely to finish it, a waste of money.  

Watched as my food sat on the pass for several minutes.  (Ugh)

Watched another server do something not health dept approved.  What's the point of pulling off the bottom of the paper of the straw, if you are going to us your fingers to put the straw in the cup?  You might as well stick your dirty fingers in the person's cup.  

When I got my sandwich, the mayo packet that came with it was open and crusty.  (Obviously, did not use.). I ate my food and prayed for no foodborne illnesses.  The chicken looked cooked through, even though it was chewy.

We've had tacos here and burgers, but this time it was the chicken sandwich.  Good choice on my part.  The average rating is derived from the lack of cleanliness.  Probably not really this places fault, but man that airport drives me crazy with the feeling of grossness.",Nlm1s_FQPVTrY06vcsfuXw,0,0,3,KPJjSxrMgPwUkH37p2_V9w

5826551,2015-06-01,0,YKVYdzkdGNTHRJvWehY5Og,"Worst service known to mankind. Only reason why they survive is convenience. Servers have attitude and don't care if they give service or not. That's ok. Guess they don't care if they get tipped or not. Decent beer if you get it before it get warm. 

Go to fast food place. This place sucks and deserves to go out of business",_r4o1_lB_dKbrU25uJY0eg,1,0,1,xTs6T7gaTA3h9MxQoEMZuQ
5951733,2018-01-21,1,YKVYdzkdGNTHRJvWehY5Og,"I gotta say that we had another good breakfast experience here.  The Los Cabos Bacon & Cheese Omelette is killer!  There's bacon and queso sauce, breakfast potatoes, queso fresco, chipotle crema, and crispy onion with toast.  It is rich and full of flavor.  A great last hurrah if you're leaving Vegas!

Husband had an ordinary Plain Jane with scrambled eggs and was fine with it.

GET the omelet!

However, skip the iced tea.  It was not good.  So not good I couldn't drink it, but they kindly took it off our bill.",fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,2,1,4,NXGuQMPFmr46ja_xXud0Lw
