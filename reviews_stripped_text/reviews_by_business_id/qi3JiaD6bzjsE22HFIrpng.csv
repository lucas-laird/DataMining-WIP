Take that little zen koan to your mediation pillow and let me know when you find enlightenment.

I can not even describe how disgusting the food was here.

And this was when I was starving at 5:00 AM after drinking all day at Wet Republic and all night at Hakasan.

The first few slices I bought looked like they had been cooked about three days ago and then left in someone's dorm room under the bed. I do not understand how the pizza wasn't fresh as the line was literally out the door. 

I wanted  some greasy, gooey, cheesy, bready carb and fat-filled substance to soak up all the vodka-sugar-free-red-bull that had overtaken the proportion of liquid in my blood stream.

So I waited (impatiently). And was given two slices of greasy deliciousness.....oh no, wait. Greasy? Yes! But also dry, nasty, tasteless crust, minimal red sauce, and veggies that looked (and tasted) like they had been fished out of a fridge featured on Kitchen Nightmares. And the cheese was cheap and somehow horrible. I like basically all cheese indiscriminately - this must have been some sort of fake-cheese-product, I honestly have no idea what I must have been eating.

Even the salad was bad. Again, not sure how you screw up lettuce. 

Next time, get room service or better yet, save yourself some calories, pass out on a empty stomach, and then get some eggs in the morning.

I consider the Venetian to be one of the elite hotels in Vegas. There obviously are much cheaper hotel options in Vegas, so when I pay their unnecessarily high rates to stay at the Venetian, it probably means I'm trying to avoid the Circus Circus crowd. 

We came here Sunday morning because there didn't seem to be any standout breakfast options at the Venetian, and we wanted to get to the pool area as quickly as possible. I noticed this place served breakfast and even though it didn't appear to be their specialty, I thought ""Well, it's the Venetian. They must hold Enzo to some kind of standard, right? "" 

Wrong. 

I ordered a cheese omelet, along with a sausage link that could have been mistaken for a dog turd, except cold. It came with ""Italian toast"" which was just a thick slice of bread, also served cold. Not too good. I ended up ordering a slice of cheese pizza to go, which at least turned out to be edible. 

Meanwhile, I haven't even had my coffee yet and while waiting to pay, there's a lady holding up the line for 5 minutes because she can't get over that a slice of pizza costs $4.00. ""I aint payin four freakin dollars for one slice of freakin pizza!!"" Are you crazy??"" Uggghhh. Then get the fuck out of the line, dummy! 

The entire food court was a fucking zoo of hungover frat boys, gang-bangers, and lowest common denominator riff-raff. They should do live broadcasts of the Jerry Springer show there.

I'm not saying the Venetian needs to be like the Wynn by not including any reasonably priced food in the entire hotel, but they can and should step it up a notch if they want to be able to continue justify their room rates. I would have gladly paid a few more bucks to eat some quality breakfast food and be surrounded by people with a tiny bit more class. This place should go. They' should honestly just tear that entire food court down and build a new restaurant there. Half the fucking people that wrote reviews for this place apparently ate breakfast there.

I thought it was surprisingly good for being Food Court pizza. The cheese if what sold me on it, was just the right chewy texture. The sauce wasn't very good though. Decent toppings. Crispy crust. 

The slice that was given to me was thankfully hot, but my sister's slice was barely warm and not as enjoyable (crust got soggy, cheese hardened a bit, etc). Be vigilant, make sure you get a fresh slice!

I'll probably never eat here again just because there's so many better options in Vegas, but if it's three in the morning and you just want a regular slice of pizza (for about 5 bucks a pop), this spot will be just fine.

I got the Sausage and Pepperoni Calzone, which was so large I ended up splitting it with Kathleen W.

For some reason, when they say sausage and pepperoni, what they really mean is pepperoni made out of sausage. Strange contraption, but tasty nonetheless.

Overall a great alternative to a buffet, but a little bit on the pricey side, which was expected. If you split a calzone, though, you'll be off just fine.",1yv6GXttiII_-od7HaUcfA,0,0,3,5oq7fXjds4wCUPkSmsh4Sw

Ok I better get back to work! When you see that big mask on display outside of the Venetian, just know the lighting aspect of that mask were results of my crafty electrician hands.  Yea, that's right!...I'm going off subject to make room to take some credit off that. But if it doesn't light up or fails, blame my boss.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,1,0,3,bMKe0wF7ReVmYjf3TxzCQw

Not bad, just not worth seeking out.  BUT if you happen to be sloshed and stumbling past or directly into this joint after leaving a club, a lounge, a show, a slot machine, pretty much anywhere on the strip, your hotel room at 5pm,
OR
spent all day eating peanuts at a sports book then this place is a very pleasant surprise.  

Pizza by the slice, Sicilian, Stromboli, spaghetti and meatballs, and breadsticks...with virtually all items under $5, it will leave you with a little extra dough to hit the blackjack table again after all that alcohol gets soaked up.",OberW6P_lUSrt1jbNpLHvw,0,0,3,uKuHvO6CKAqcVrVuNxwLog

I was happy it was located right across our hotel cause who has time to go somewhere fancy after being at the club all night long and your feet are killing you. For a whole pizza it's a little pricey but if you're splitting the check between a group it's not so bad. The crust was a little burnt but I was just so hungry I didn't really care. The service was quick and the staff were very attentive. I would definitely recommend coming here for a late night snack and I'll look forward to coming here my next Vegas trip!

Recently had the meatball & pepperoni and really liked it. Perfectly crunchy crust. Good toppings with tasty cheese. Yes, you fold the pizza. That's the only way to eat a slice that big.

so after surrender, i really really wanted to try grande cafe lux or whatever in the Venetian, but my friend who i was dragging around did not want to sit in a restaurant because it was like... 5am (.....blame the taxi line out of Encore). and i also wanted eggs (why? i have no idea). and he dragged MY ASS to this place instead and they had this 4 items for $10 special. We got the french toast, eggs, sausage and quiche! 

The employees could have loaded up a bigger portion,,, so skimpy -______- But the french toast was MEH, the eggs were pretty bland but the sausages and quiche was really good!!! and not because i was drunk either! LOL the sausages had this different taste to it and the quiche had spinach and it was all toasty and flakey. YUM! 

the 2nd time i came here, i was pretty drunk from TAO Beach, so my other friend cheered for pizza so we came here. omggggggg their pizza is to die for. The slice portion is average for the price... but pizza still super delicious. they dont skimp on mushrooms, sauce, sausages, cheese... etc. the crust is also awesome, not cold or hard like some places! We were munching on them waiting for our valet parking, but we loved teh pizza so much we went back for more!",5re8RQ-2-Mkz7LC4ftYfHw,9,8,4,0lQMNRt9n8U5AiRAkF3srQ
