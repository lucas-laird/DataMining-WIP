1453212,2018-04-10,0,B7wVtgjOxkFNOoD6S11Urw,First time here at this New pub. I use to drive by the old bar it use to be all the time. It caught my eye that it had changed as we drove by so we automatically flipped around and went there. The inside was so nice I really did not expect it to be like that. We had a very nice bartender. The owner Hunter even came over introduced himself and talked to us and all the other customers as well. We couldn't decide what we wanted to eat. I ended up getting the BBQ Bourbon Pulled Pork and it was amazing. They had so many options to choose from salads burgers pastas and sandwiches. They even had breakfast as well. We'll definitely be back for that blacken chicken sandwich,1d06qBjTux3Vw1RRnHV8JA,0,0,5,K0w8SLU9ImST2QeEg4YdPg

We had been looking for a local pub where we could go occasionally for a couple drinks and some gaming that was close, inviting and had pretty good ( loose) gaming. 
We found it with FT pub #6! The staff are all friendly and keep a cold drink in your hand pretty much without having to ask, yet they don't hover and ask constantly if you need anything...great girls! 
The food is AWESOME, the drinks are poured well and the video poker is pretty loose...if you are into video poker this is the place to go!",HDaw8sH58SRBNaiLSvSGeg,2,0,4,bCtXcg2XBLelzmLMc10fWw

I had the fish and chips and it was the best I've EVER had. Bleu cheese slaw was an interesting take on slaw. My son had the cream pasta. It wasn't Nora's but for a bar it was excellent.

I came there for a soft opening .... we were greeted right away all the workers tend to be nice and friendly since it's new ... it's defiantly a lot more nicer then I had been nice murals and the pool table had been moved .... 

We got our cards to play you get a free 20$ once you play 50$ I believe it was.... 

**** they have a promo going if you hit 4 of a kind on the machine u win 1000$ I hit two four of a kind but you HAVE TO SHOW THEM or it doesn't count which I didn't get that memo so I wasn't aware so my four of a kinds didnt count**** 


My only negative so far is that I had to wave them down to get drinks for us because they didn't come down they were on the other side or walked past and didn't even ask since it's a new bar I'm sure they are just trying to get the hang of things",yEmeRQb4WH6NN0IAaTX_lw,4,7,4,yoVQJ9B943ui6OQD3URE4Q

I found it while looking for Harbor Freight and liked it so much I went back for lunch two more times before leaving town. Service is friendly, beers are cold, and the food is great. Prices aren't over-inflated like in the tourist joints. 

If you're not from around here but you're in town doing the convention shuffle, pop over here after you hit Home Depot and enjoy a little downtime. It's convenient and a nice place to take a break to recharge. Or if you're visiting and looking for a place that's not overrun by bros, take a drive and have a beer here.",VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w,3,1,5,ilXsq_yQkKooXszJYcd6ng

My double IPA ran $6.50 each which is solid for a 7+ abv pint.  The place has about 10 TVs and a patio area outside.  Good setup with tons of snaking bar seats, few tables, and then back area for darts and the like.  Service was good and very attentive.  Owner/manager for the night I went seemed to be very active in keeping the place going - bussing tables and serving, himself.  He really had his stuff in order and seemed to be very active with getting rotating beers on tap that will sell.  All in all, a nice bar if you're in the area.

To the best part - the happy hour!!! Their shots are always like a double shot and the prices for the food and drinks are outstanding. Everybody is always so nice and attentive; which is extremely hard to find these days.

The chicken tacos which I thought we're going to be whatever were the best things we got. The sauce was flavorful and just amazing. Chicken wings were great. The calamari is sauced in a creamy mushroom sauce and quite nice. Caprese salad was very good. Simple fresh and delicious. I just have to say though. Chicken tacos. 5 bucks happy hour. Chicken tacos.

We have been several times since their opening in February and each time the service has been awesome. They have a full menu, good prices and gluten free options as well.  They also have no problem granting special requests either...I asked if they would substitute Turkey for the Corned Beef on their Rueben Sandwich, it was no problem at all and it was delicious!!  We have also tried the Fish & Chips, Breakfast Burrito, Eggs Benedict and their Broccoli Tots and all of the food has been great.  They have a good selection of beer and alcohol too....Make sure to ask the bartenders to make one of their specialty drinks  - Walk The Plank is a whiskey drink, and my favorite, Shipwrecked is served in a cool Fish Bowl or try their blended drink called the Rip Tide!!

I have only lovely things to say about the menu.  Delicious!!!! My taste buds were so pleased.  The selections are wonderful and available 24 HOURS A DAY!!!!! The seating for dinning are very comfortable and perfect for that cuddle.  Great for date.
