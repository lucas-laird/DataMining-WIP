 Everything was delicious from tacos to torta. I had the milanesa gotta which was cooked just right, I tasted a hint of mutstard.. Very nice touch. Between my kids and husband, they had tacos al pastor, carne asada and pescado.. All great along with the rolled tacos.",qCr6cLbNFJsr9U26DspXwQ,0,0,5,R4s4tlG4x7oYgApQF44vUQ

Best prices in town for high quality tacos. $1.29 tacos, am I in Mexico? lol",Bmn3g0gKsOcG7c0WWRE_xQ,0,0,5,VdL_qe4IRCPfqt9z7O06NQ

I've been stuck on their California burrito which has fries plus I add guacamole.  Make your way downtown to try their food. Seriously! I haven't got around to trying their tacos but by god, their burritos are bomb-diggity!",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,3,2,5,aBkq78tAa8Yramcq_P9AHA

4179271,2017-08-06,0,eRKVkDsHSFjaej3j7H0HyA,"Came on a nice Sunday afternoon to enjoy some tacos and I was definitely not disappointed. I ordered three Al Pastor tacos and they were cooked to perfection. With a few bites in, one can easily tell that the restaurant use the freshest ingredients and the highest quality of meat. I strongly recommend putting both the red and green sauces on the tacos for a great combination of spiciness and flavor. I also ordered a very refreshing agua de pi√±a, which accompanied the tacos very well due to the spiciness of the red sauce. I truly can't wait to come back and try more items in the menu.",WwG9cm2O2tJ8mdH4MTcLWQ,0,2,5,1Pp2AtenpGEdoa-pD9x2qw

5116449,2017-12-28,0,eRKVkDsHSFjaej3j7H0HyA,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff...clean too! You will be hard pressed to find a better taco for a buck twenty-nine. Several varieties to choose from at this price. A delightful birria dish is available on weekends. They also serve up a delicious champurrado...which is an earthy, rustic, warm beverage made with masa, chocolate, spices and piloncillo...a type of sugar minimally processed ~just cane juice boiled down to a thick syrup, and typically formed into cone shapes. It's a real treat!  Extra added bonus, the tortillas are house made on the spot too. All the expected condiments are on display, the pickled carrots/onions are a stand out with a nice accent of Mexican oregano. Taqueria La Herradura is another shining star along the Charleston Ave taco trail.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,2,1,5,BlJ2jd_YzVm7ib8isv6Alg
