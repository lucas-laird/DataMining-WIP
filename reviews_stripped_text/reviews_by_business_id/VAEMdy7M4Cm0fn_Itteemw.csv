The clams are fantastic, and very fresh. We didn't get a chance to try the sushi, but others at the bar seemed to enjoy it. My top picks are the gigantic shrimp cocktail, and any of the seafood pasta dishes. My only complaint? They give you Hawaiian rolls. The sauces the seafood is served in are fantastic, but they are lost on the mushy balls of dough served. Please, bring back the crusty bread!",1lBDlRzl70jdQuLGOlKOBQ,0,0,4,4PjagmmIUN8MoCh0omEhkA

1239832,2018-05-20,0,VAEMdy7M4Cm0fn_Itteemw,"Interesting concept. All the cooks and waiters are in the middle of the restaurant and the bar is build in a U shape around them. So, you get to watch them cooking your food. I like the look of the place and they have a lot of good menu items. Being from Maryland originally, I was skeptical to try their 'Maryland' crabcakes. Out west, their idea of a 'Maryland' crabcake is laughable. But this place made 'em just right. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the waiters who service the bar patrons can barely hear what you're saying since you are separated from them by a large counter. Behind them, the cooks are banging pots and pans. Then you've got Bruce Springsteen playing on the speakers overhead. It was our first time there, and the waitress gave me two items that were the opposite of what I actually ordered. But what I take away from that is to next time eat at the tables where the waitresses actually walk over, lean in and can hear you better. I'm a fan of the restaurant, just not the bar seating.",hGjWxU29yfV6aI0q_N9Aaw,0,0,4,rWsLUabUUXb-hs4eQwcLuw

The pan roast is OK. Probably because there are other places in town the specialize in pan roast that are waaaay better. Plus, their pan roast had tiny hard pieces from the crab shell which was sort of a turn off. But, I would come here for the lobster roll again.  The potato wedges that come with it are delicious and a perfect side along with their Cole slaw that has bacon (Yes, bacon!) and corn!  I want to also try the oysters and fish tacos!



NEXT VISIT: Back again - oysters and fish tacos are bomb!  Get the salty oysters. They're smaller but have way more flavor!  

One thing I don't like is how there are always tiny pieces of shell in their lobster dishes. (Pan roast, lobster roll, etc.)",3o8c_R-Kv5UOoXXuMEOZAw,3,2,4,TW7ZXQBuTkp8TuncX2wprA

We sat at the counter and were very well received.  Ordered drinks and a couple of starters.  The Caesar Salad was huge and perfect to share.  I love Caesar salads and I must say that this was right on point.  The perfect amount of dressing, romaine and parmesan cheese.   The oysters were from Vancouver (British Columbia) Fanny Bay.  YUM!  had to ask for acrutements (raw horseradish and cocktail sauce) but all in all delicious.  We also had to request bread service??  However Pam jumped on it and took care of it immediately.  The crab cakes were delicious and love the tarragon sauce which was as good as we remembered from the previous establishment.

I ordered the 9 piece Sashimi plate, which consisted of 3 ahi tuna, salmon and yellowfin pieces.  The chef provided me with a delightful soy and citrus sauce for dipping on the side.

When it came to dessert I really wanted a double espresso, unfortunately they don't offer espresso after dinner coffees.  Shocker!   

We still decided to have dessert and Pam recommended the Salted Caramel Crunch Cake....  OMG  it was heavenly.. If you ever try this place you MUST have this dessert.  to die for!

For a Friday night, we feel the service was sufficient, had to request a few things, but in the end left quite satisfied and will most definitely return for more delicious treats.

My gumbo and lobster mac & cheese were both very good, but isn't the definition of a five star rating on Yelp ""as good as it gets""?  They weren't quite that good.  I also tasted my wife's crab corn chowder and one of the fried oysters.  Again, good but not great.

I also have to give a little bit of a downgrade for ambiance.  The small room (open to the casino) with stark white tile walls, has a little bit of a fast food restaurant feel to it.

If Briggs was down the street from my office, I would go there for lunch all the time.  (Oddly, Briggs is not open for lunch, although the menu seems perfect for it.)  And I will go back.  But not for a really high end seafood dinner.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,4,_8jEpJcB84VibQJOX7kZWA

The coleslaw that comes with is excellent,  and I'm not a fan of coleslaw.  It is never overdressed, always crunchy and has bacon and corn in it. Yum. My dad usually orders the fish and chips  (which he devours) or the lobster roll.  My mom varies, but enjoys anything she has tried.  Sometimes we order the Caesar salad and an entrée and split both because the portions are huge. Besides the food being tasty,  the staff is what keeps us coming back.  The open kitchen really allows you to interact with the chefs.  Bobby,  one of the chefs,  has a big personality to go with the big flavors he cooks up. He always remembers us and makes the meal feel personalized.  The chefs will also accommodate any taste preferences, such as not to spicy or less sauce, etc. This is great since my mother has certain dietary issues. It really helps her enjoy more menu options knowing they will cater to her restrictions.  Jill, one of our regular servers is another standout.  She is warm and friendly and always has a big smile to greet you with.  She will make you feel like family walking into her home.

I started with some crab cakes--a larger appetizer than I had expected but then one has to make sacrifices.  Following this, I had the seafood gumbo, and I finished the meal with a slice of caramel crunch cake.

The crab cakes were very good with a large amount of crab meat with little filler.  The slaw served with it was a large portion and was quite good.  The whole app is something that would be better shared because there are three cakes along with the slaw.

I then got my seafood gumbo and it was delightful too!  There was a bit of spice to it but not enough to turn anyone off.  The gumbo has lobster, shrimp, andouille, crab, peppers, okra, and a large scoop of rice was put in the bowl before the gumbo was added.  A very filling and tasty meal.

I ended with a slice of salted caramel crunch cake that was good although a little bit on the dry side.

I sat at the bar and service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  It was fun watching the cooks do their thing.  I want to go back as I have some other things I need to try.

The one drawback was that my seat at the bar was in an area where the AC came directly on me.  I was freezing cold all the time I was there even wearing a long sleeve denim short over my t-shirt.

We started off with some sushi and jumbo shrimp cocktail. One of the first sushi (I can't remember the name) we tried was actually pretty good (topped with wasabi and ginger), but the California Roll wasn't as good as the previous one. I decided to try oysters for the first time, and I wasn't thrilled or a fan of the flavor whatsoever. We also tried the Corn Crab Chowder and it was actually pretty good and was topped with fresh crab. I love clam chowder and so this one was pretty good. My main course was a crab roll with a side of potato fries and coleslaw. The sandwich was pretty good and the fries were amazing, crispy and flaky just delicious! The coleslaw had bacon in it, and I'm one of the few who aren't a fan of bacon, but I toughed it and I actually couldn't taste the bacon so that was a plus.

4128291,2016-03-16,3,VAEMdy7M4Cm0fn_Itteemw,"Hey Folks! 

Save your money and time. This place was horrible. We went during happy hour and the oysters were not in a half shell. Some were broken shells... some were not schuck correctly; a mix and match of ""no attention to detail"". Some were the lids of the oyster. The California Rolls had fake crab.  The sushi chef was using a dull knife to cut his fish causing the rolls to be lopsided. 

When we finally got our check, the waitress splashed cocktail sauce on wife's white sweater. As humans we all make mistakes, but at least offer 5% off the bill or something. Humor me...

I am embarrassed by this team. They have a lot of kinks to work out.

I've tried a couple of places around town that serve Pan Roast and they are not all created equal. I'm happy to say that Briggs makes one that is comparable to Palace Station's Pan Roast . They do it in the same style and use steamed rice. There are some Oyster bars which their sauce is brownish and they use like a rice pilaf which is just wrong in my book! This dish is $18.00 and warms you up on a cold day. 

I like the seating at Briggs better then Place Station's because there is more seating even though it is small. They have bar seating and little tables around the bar as well. Palace Station's seating is just the bar area and I feel rushed when I 'm eating because people are literally standing in line beside you as you eat.

I ordered the pan roast and a beer. The server took my order promptly (it wasn't very busy), but he didn't bring any bread until he saw me looking around like I needed something. He asked me if I would like some bread with my meal and I said yes. He brought some rolls that were ice cold and looked like they were the kind that you would get at a 99 cent store. The pan roast came, it had maybe 5 small shrimp, about a 2 inch piece of a lobster claw, and some shredded crab meat with a scoop of rice. The sauce was ok, but missing something. Needless to say I was still hungry after eating and really didn't care for the flavor of the sauce. You would think after a few months of bad reviews, the management would have caught on and made some improvements, unfortunately, for me the food is worse than it was before. 
I would rather wait in line for over an hour and a half at Palace Station and get really really great food for the same price. Maybe the owners, managers, and cooks should go there and see how a great pan roast is made!",zFZV8lyG0WbGC05PP0sxug,3,0,2,2zD5fu8rslFQFCMxQ28Agw

Questions: 

1. Where is the manager? No one is manning the ship on a night where they are famous for their oyster specials.

2. Why are the staff not cleaning the dirty tables? Tables are sitting idle for 15 minutes at a time while there is a 30-40 minute wait.

3.  Why does the hostess seem to not understand the procedure for seating people at empty tables? Even when the tables have been cleaned and prepared the hostess doesn't look behind her to see where the available tables are at, leaving many agitated customers wondering why they chose to come to this establishment. 

I hope the executive level management take this review and use it as an opportunity to address the concerns I have pointed out. 

A great dining experience does not only depend on the meal. A great dining experience starts with the first encounter.  Please understand that this review is not the result of a whiny customer not getting a table immediately, it is the precipice of horrendous treatment at the hands of ill trained staff.",w2eTx3KtnAswxVirj58nnA,5,0,1,EnkcsKV8k1_W5D7Pa7bZ3Q

It sits between the steak house and the Italian restaurant. The dining area is small, but they have a sushi bar type atmosphere where you can sit at the counter and watch your food be prepared.

We ordered the oysters on the half shell. I think they were about $18 (reasonable price). The oysters were excellent. They were very fresh tasting, but they were gulf coast oysters and I was not aware that they also had cold water oysters available. I would have rather had the cold water oysters, but I did not find out until after dinner when I was talking to the cook. The server should let you know that you have a choice of oysters from different regions when you are ordering. We also ordered the steamed mussels, which came with the standard butter and lemon sauce. The mussels were also very fresh tasting.

I ordered the fish & chips for my entree. They use tempura as their batter for the cod. You get two pieces with fries and cole slaw. The fish was pretty good. Was not greasy at all. The cole slaw comes with roasted corn and bacon mixed in it. I don't eat pork, so one of the cooks mixed me some fresh slaw with just the roasted corn and no bacon. That was nice of him.

The service was very good overall. I would say excellent, but they forgot our bread basket. It was also very slow when I was there, so I can't say how good or bad the service is when it is busy.

I will definitely be back and I would recommend that you give it a try. The total bill was $72.00 for a dozen oysters, a dozen steamed mussels, 2 orders of fish & chips, one Blue Moon. and one soda.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,8,4,4,bKz6mCXu5t6ry1OCX_soRw

The smaller one were sweet and had a little firmer texture. But the medium size one was my favorite. The big fat ones were juicy but there's a small bitter after taste I think (maybe that's the BP Gold that's still giving after all these years from those waters). All were fresh. I am afraid if they were any fresher, they'd be squirting water at me.

Excellent service. We went at about 6:30pm so had to wait 15 minutes but it went by fast. I didn't bother to get the clam chowder today. But if you are in the mood it's $6 for a bowl.

Cleaniness and overall look: 5 stars
Service and friendliness: 5 stars
Food: 3 stars

That would give it 4 stars, right? I can't do it. Seriously, the staff was super awesome. But the food was okay. And let's face it--if the food isn't that good, it's hard to give it more stars. 

We had:

Ceaser salad - no different than your average salad and there was nothing that stood out. 
Clam Chowder - I wasn't the biggest fan.  My fiance was and said it was great. I did not agree. It wasn't as creamy as I was hoping. More water based to me. 
Crab cakes - this was my favorite. I love crab cakes that are mostly crab and not filling. It also came with some bomb-ass coleslaw. 
Pan Roast - it left me wanting a richer flavor. It was more watery and very tomato based. Which most of them are, but I was thinking it'd be more creamy. To me, it was bland. It had plenty of seafood in it too. 

This place is good. It really seems like a solid 3 stars. It's just hard to compare when you have some amazing oyster bars in town. 
For me: if you call it an ""Oyster Bar""--you should have way more than one type of Oyster to offer. If you don't, I think you should just be called a ""seafood bar.""",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,28,19,3,1DP30JXq-Tce_i3X1gX4EA

Upon arrival I was informed that the $1.00 special only is on certain days.  I specifically pulled up the website on my phone and showed the hostess and the manager that did it does not say that the special is only on certain nights.  It does state that there are special oysters on specific nights but nothing else.  Finally I took a seat at the bar and we ordered clams, crab corn chowder, and a dozen oysters.  The manager, Laura Bushman, came back over to us and said she reviewed the website and said it stated $1.00 oysters were only on special days.  She then was extremely condescending and truly was not very apologetic.  She treated me and my fiancé as if we were in the wrong and made us feel very unwelcome.  Our server Alex informed us that we are not the only customers that think this on a daily basis.  He actually was apologetic, showed empathy and tried to make our experience better.  The crab corn chowder came out and it was simply corn chowder with crab pieces on top.  It was not what we expected and it was not even hot, so it was sent back.  The clams came out for my fiancé and she enjoyed them, but my oysters did not come out until she was half way done with her meal.
This has the potential of being a good place.  If management would consider taking care of their customers better then I am sure they would be rated better.

First things first! The bread is no longer cold dinner rolls from a bag. Wahooooo! They now serve warm Hawaiian Bread and cheese bread. If You are ordering sushi, and Glenn is making it, it will be the best sushi of your life. Crab cakes are still a no go.  The lobster roll is delicious but rich. They comes with the best steak fries everrrrr. The lobster mac and cheese is also delicious but also very rich. Its very filling and probably should be shared.  Fish tacos are still my favorite. (Martin makes the best fish tacos).  I usually order it off the appetizer menu as I do not eat cole slaw and it's a bit cheaper (it comes with 3). My husband still loves the panroast. (I'm not a fan).  The clam chowder is a no go. It used to be really good but now it is freakishly thick. I think the warmers are causing the potatoes to overcook and becoming mushy (causing the thickness).

I can't comment on sushi or oysters because they're not on our radar, but we had the Pan Roast and the Gumbo.  Both dishes came out in a short time and the spicy seasoning in both was perfect.  The Gumbo with sausage and seafood on rice was rich & delicious, and the portion just right.  I loved my Pan Roast w/crab, shrimp & lobster (also on rice) & enjoyed the leftovers for lunch today.

It feels so much like community sitting at the counter and we espec. like that Briggs is open to the casino ( without being obtrusive), and the vibes from employees added to the ambiance.   We spoke to the manager, Laura, about our happy experience & I recommended Fr. baquettes or a good sourdough in the bread basket.  She said this coming week they were experimenting with different breads, & has always been receptive to suggestions.

Another time we liked the fish fry w/steak fries & a really good coleslaw.  I am a big fan of their seafood salad, now that they informed me to ask for it NOT to be tossed.  It's substantial & so healthy.  The last time there my partner had the $20  steak on regular menu & it was a winner.  Melted in your mouth!  And special potatoes were good also.

The sushi we ordered was the rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll and an eel roll. I'm very positive that they pre-roll all the sushi because the rice was dry and the ""fresh"" tuna and salmon were pale. We sent it back due to fear it would make us severely sick. My mouth about dropped to the floor when the Manager Laura spoke to the table next to us. They ordered the steamed clams and had the server bring new broth because it was bland. When they received their bill they asked for a manager and Laura came over to speak with them. I couldn't believe it when she looked at the guest that ordered it and said ""well... You ate it didn't you?! Are you still hungry?!?"" My mouth dropped to the floor. I couldn't believe it when she told them she was taking the steamed clams off she pretty much blamed it on the guest and said to next time tell us. That manager is so oblivious, they did and she should've walked to the table that moment it happened. She is out of her mind if she thinks they are coming back. This was our first and last time here.

Last night they had plenty of oysters and they were succulent and sweet. The horseradish was extremely hot, great server and my wife was extremely happy.
We started with a crab cake and fried oyster appetizers which were made fresh in clean oil and served nicely. Both very tasty, but I felt the sauces they served with them were lacking personality. 
I also had the seafood chowder which is the red and white clam chowders mixed and supersized with shrimp, lobster, potatoes and so much more. I would definitely eat it again.

Our server is one of the women who has been at this restaurant a long time. She knew exactly what she was doing, was very pleasant to talk too and she was very attentive to the birthday girl.",OPSX06huwVlM40REfyiZrQ,0,0,4,VsStUQ04RZWkjQxqC1q8qg
