84740,2012-09-13,0,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"This place is terrible.  We had just arrived in Vegas and were thinking about eating at Joe's Stone Crab or Planet Hollywood.  Both were packed, but PJ Clarke's looked pretty empty.  We looked it up on Yelp and found that it had decent ratings so we decided to give it a try.  

Considering the place only had a few patrons and that it was mid week around 9pm, we thought we would get served immediately.  The hostess was nice and brought us to our table.  The atmosphere seemed OK, but the wait was ridiculous.  We made eye contact with 3 different waiters and smiled assuming they would come over and help us, but they just ignored us.  It looked deliberate as it seemed they were about to come over, but instead just kept talking.  We couldn't believe it.

Now I understand we weren't dressed formally, but I was with my wife and mom and we were just dressed casually (khakis and shirts, nothing too fancy, but nothing bizarre either).  It seemed as if we were being discriminated against for whatever reason as they didn't even greet us for 20 minutes.  We tried to get their attention, but they just kept pretending to ignore us.  In fact I'm not even sure if it was just us as the table next to us seemed to be getting pretty slow service as well.  It was really strange because we were the only two tables on that side of the establishment and there were only about 2 other tables occupied on the opposite side.  We continued to wait......and NOTHING!!!

We decided to get up and leave.  The hostess approached us and asked what happened and we told her that we were ignored and nobody approached us to take our order.  Again she was nice and tried to call one of them but even that took a while so we just walked out and went to Planet Hollywood (good meal and good service).

Regardless we are not going back to PJ Clarke's again and recommend that nobody else does either.",-kqy7hluPxv6ZCh8uE1bKQ,2,0,1,ztWQ8aR6etxUHlFwqFzjPg
124255,2011-10-23,0,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"I have a list of 'burgers to try' in the notes section of my phone that has been slowly growing, I have no idea where most of them came from. Many are recommendations from readers, while some are from articles in local papers touting the 'best unknown burger' or something like that. PJ Clarke's is one such place. I didn't remember where the suggestion came from walking in, but our waitress reminded us that the Las Vegas Weekly had claimed theirs the 'best burger in Las Vegas.' Do I agree?

The answer is no. The burger is definitely good, but in no way is it the 'best', and I really hate claims like this. I won't get into too much of the history of the restaurant, which dates back to 1884 in New York. You can read about it on their site without me having to repeat it. As for the Vegas location, it's located in the evil Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. I say evil because if you are a local and have ever tried to park there you surely haven't forgotten that awful experience. And to top it off, the restaurant is located at the Las Vegas Blvd end so you have to walk completely across the mall to get there through lumbering tourists and smelly fountains.

For a place that supposedly has the ""Cadillac of burgers"", the burger section is pretty minimal and far down on the menu. You aren't presented with many options for your 100% Black Angus burger, just a series of cheeses, and a few additional options for a fee like bacon, Béarnaise sauce, a fried egg, etc. There is only one pre-configured burger on the menu, predictably titled ""The Cadillac"", which has smoked country bacon and American cheese. Sides are a-la-carte, so I was asked if I wanted regular or sweet potato fries with it. Of course I went with the regular to keep this meal as consistent as possible with others.

The burger came out with a nice buttery, grilled brioche bun, two thick pieces of bacon, a thin but tasty pickle slice, tomatoes and far too much lettuce. It wasn't until after I assembled my burger and picked it up did I notice a full slice of an onion hiding below. Our waitress later explained that back in the day the first restaurant in New York served their food on paper plates and this was a way to keep the juices from the burger sogging up the plate. Nice touch of tradition, but kind of odd.

The burger was tastier than I anticipated at first bite; it was juicy, the bun had good flavor, and the cheese was melted. The meat on its own was ok, it had kind of the generic meat flavor that comes with your standard Angus and could have maybe used a little seasoning. I ordered medium rare, but it was a bit too grey in the middle compared to my friend's that was more pink than mine for only being ordered medium. The burger dripped some juice during the first few bites and stopped maybe halfway through, but luckily didn't really dry out the burger as I got to the end. One thing that I found odd during the meal was that I kept hitting weird pockets of saltiness as I took bites. Initially I thought it might be from the bacon, but I think it was just the meat as my friend didn't have bacon on his and made the same salt comment.

The bun was well proportioned to the meat, I found that I had just enough of both. The bacon was slightly undercooked and didn't quite have that crunch I'd hope for, but was still very flavorful and fit well. As I said the cheese was melted which is still not always easy for some places, but might have contributed to a bit of the saltiness. The fries might have been a tiny bit undercooked, but had good flavor until they got cold which happened sort of quickly. They had that good 'natural' flavor that I like, much better than what is attempted in a similar style at somewhere like Five Guys.

Now for the bad... I have to say the overall price of the meal was a little high due to the fact that my a-la-carte fries were $6.60!! I'm fine with the $14.60 burger based on the strip location and even what was presented to me, but the fry price is a bit out of hand, and pushes the burger past $20 which I think is a bit high. The service was great; I think we had two different managers come by our table and ask if everything was ok. And our waitress Justina was extremely friendly, knew a great deal about the history of the restaurant, and also provided us with our onion explanation. All that being said, I think $21 is a bit much for a burger, unless maybe it really was the 'best burger in Vegas.' I personally hate going to the strip these days, but if you don't mind or already find yourself at Caesar's, the overall restaurant, service and food are worth it if you're willing to cough up a bit too much money to sample what is supposedly the best in town. As we already know, there are worse places on the strip.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,2,Tv3exKNu9jg4zYcEUdSLDw

Hamburgers here do not quite match up - not sure why, but they don't have that certain something the ones in New York did.  They were also a bit overdone.  Fries and tater tots were excellent and crispy, though, and service was great.

We went back the next day to get the happy hour oysters, and they were FANTASTIC!  $1 each from 2:45-6pm.  They were huge and flavorful, and we ended up making an early dinner out of them.  We each had 7, plus a really delicious sidecar (the drink special for happy hour, 2 for 1 pricing).  I was surprised to like the sidecar - I thought it'd be too boozey, but this one tasted great without the ""bite"" of alcohol.  The bartender was awesome.

 i am glad the place now shows 3 dollar signs on yelp,because it had 2 at the time i looked with good reviews ,which was the main reason we went in the first place.

When i visited in July  the place was supposed to close at 12am, when my party of 5 came in at 10.50, we were informed before we even said how many, that the kitchen was going to close soon and asked if  we were sure we wanted to come in.  Not enirely sure how that's good business, but we stupidly sat down anyway.  The waiter started off pretty rude, but started telling us about an annoying group he had waited on before us and then got nicer, which I understood, but still what do I care if other people suck its his job to be cordial to customers.  Then after giving us flat soda, and forgetting two times to get us new drinks, and 15minutes of waiting, we finally ordered.  Two orders of Fish and Chips,  my lobster mac n cheese, the famous pj burger, and calamari.  ten minutes later the waiter informed my boyfriend that they had run out of hamburger (which i think is so stupid for a restaurant to do), and asked if he wanted anything else.  so my boyfriend ordered a filet mignon neat,  the waiter said he would go ahead and throw in some fries for the inconvenience.  then he came back 3minutes to say that the chef didnt want to serve a steak with fries.  SERIOUSLY, what kind of a pretentious jerk says that? my boyfriend asked to talk to the chef if it was going to be a problem, but the waiter quickly said he would take care of it.  finally we get our food.  somehow the steak is dry as hell and bland, weird because it was ordered medium cooked.  everything else tasted pretty good, the problem was that both people who ate the fish and chips, ended up with the runs and it defintiely was not from anything else they'd eaten earlier.  it just was a sucky experience. one of the few times yelp really let me down.  :(",QGF6Pwaj4diMUf2SeIjJtw,1,0,1,jJ5TSVVlMS-gIdYqnF7K7Q

Came here for dollar oysters . The Bill was $120 .
And no I didn't eat 120 battery acid-ass oysters . I made it up to 12 then decided to up my budget to 3.00 dollar oyster menu (3.50 for kumumatos).

Happy hour is from 2:45 - 6 and only ONE kind of Oyster is on the Happy hour Menu... The other 4-6 kinds are all 3.00-3.50 per oyster!

Clams on the half shell here also. $21 a dozen, ""ehh, buck  .75 a clam"".  Pricey for clams...but they were perfect size for little necks and fresh. Very good.  You want your little necks as big as possible without being to meaty about three inches but not much smaller. Any larger than that and you get a mouthful of clam...well it is vegas. just didnt know that clam was beerded. Yeah thats right. I sipped on a nice beer(6.50-7.50 a beer). no hair on it though.

The happy hour oyster taste like a handful of penny places on your tongue....Very metallic..Im talking periodic table of elements. Chernoble radiation.  WTF pj clarkes.... 

This message is for Paul John Clarke if he's listening(?):    You've got a good thing going, just figure out your pricing for happy hour.

My husband, mother-in-law, and I were really hungry because our flight was late and wanted to check out something nice.  We went to Caesar's Palace because it was a short walking distance from our hotel.  Initially, we were going to go to Planet Hollywood except the wait was too long and figured we should try something else.  Across from Planet Hollywood Restaurant was Joe's Stone Crab.  My husband and I tried the restaurant the last time we were in Vegas so I figured I'd check on Yelp to see what other eateries were in the plaza.  I noticed P.J. Clarke's New York Chophouse had a 4-stars rating so we decided to check it out

As we approached the restaurant, the hostess was really friendly and went over the menu with us.  At that moment on we were pretty sold and wanted to try it.  She escorted us to our table and we were told our servers would be right with us.  A few minutes passed by and we were shocked that none of the servers that were standing by the bar looking at us didn't seem to acknowledge us at all.  We made eye contact and still NOTHING. 

We decided to get up and leave and the hostess asked us what was wrong.  So we told her that none of the servers acknowledged us..  She looked shocked and went to talk to her colleagues but we stormed off and decided to spend our money else where.

First of all the service started off by two seemingly capable waiters coming over and introducing themselves.  While the restaurant was not busy at that time they somewhat obtrusively hovered about 5 feet away, multiple times asking us if we were ready to order.  We finally had to tell them that we would let them know when we were ready.  After that, service was fine until the place had many more customers then it was hit or miss getting their attention.
    But they were by far not the most disappointing experience of the evening so that is why I generously gave them 1 star.  On the other hand the food was not even worthy of a dive bar.  The Classic Caesar salad, $9.90, was chopped romaine with a salad dressing that wouldn't even be served out of a bottle (maybe it was but who knows).  It had no real flavor of Caesar dressing and they should be ashamed of serving it. 
    Next in line was the 18oz. bone-in Delmonico Ribeye for $44.90 which two of us had.  When it came it was about 3/4 of an inch thick and clearly not weighing more than 12-14 ounces.  It was also as limp as a wet noodle with an outside that was barely showing any grill marks (I guess because it was so thin and I ordered it medium rare they couldn't leave it on the grill long enough to give it some grill flavor).  We didn't know yet that the small size would be a blessing.  With our serrated knives we then began the arduous process of cutting into this miserable waste of beef.  The  excessive amount of cartilage and fat made the task of finding an edible piece of beef like a treasure hunt.  After it was all said and done I would estimate between the small size, the bone, the fat and cartilage we probably salvaged 6 ounces of edible beef (now you see why we were glad of its size).  And this is what we payed almost $90 for a combined 12 ounces of beef.
    Now I can understand a steak going out every now and then that may not meet expectations but for two of them to go to the same table and be equally bad is not an oversight.
   I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody but if you do go and are planning of having one of their $45 ribeyes, bring a saw because the serrated knife didn't make the cut.",Of2OFdphFDW7s1dlysP8qQ,0,0,1,ycCMKshEorhJ6iL1FTER-Q

We sat at the raw bar and the bartenders/oyster shuckers were very friendly and provided wonderful service. PJ's offers a different type of oyster as their $1 special everyday of the week during happy hour which starts at 2:45p.m. The oysters on the half shell came on an iced platter with 3 different condiments to go with it (horseradish, cocktail sauce, and sweet chili sauce) and they also give you cute little tobasco sauce in tiny bottles. My husband downed 2 dozen Oysters immediately.  The regular price of these oysters are $3 each so it is a great  value for oyster lovers. Now, if you are not a fan of oysters, than you may not see the value in coming here for happy hour because everything else on the menu is a bit on the pricier side. Along with the oysters, my husband and I ordered each a bowl of clam chowder and fried calamari.  I love traditional new england clam chowder, this tasted like they took the clam chowder and tried to evoke some gourmet into it by adding what tasted like some type of wine. I liked it okay but wasn't that enamored by it. The calamari was wonderful! It was very tender and nut rubbery like when it is overcooked. The clam chowder cost about $8.50 and $12.50 for the calamari. Wished they had a special half price on appetizers too during happy hour.

I was given the task from my boss to host 7 bigshots in the auto industry, we are all here for SEMA.  We dined at P.J. Clarke's on Wednesday October 31 at 8:30pm.  I made the reservations and we were sat promptly by a beautiful hostess. While making my reservation, I asked to be placed somewhere in the restaurant where it may be a little less noisy so we can talk and what a perfect table.  My guests are not the easiest to please so I asked our server Damond to please help me look like a superstar and boy,  did he come through.  Some of my guests liked oysters and thats when Ryan, the oyster shucking Guru came by and opened our eyes to the world of oysters, who would think in the middle of the desert!  we loved em, fresh, salty, and DELICIOUS.  We had an assortment of appetizers , french onion soup and some really good old school Cocktails, I had a zazerac for the first time, I'm hooked.  Most of us enjoyed Steak and Lobster, David  had Lamb Chops and loved them.  The lobster tails were cooked to perfection and the Chef tops them off with some sort of crunchy topping which really set them apart form the traditional just broiled or boiled.  The side dishes were awesome, Mac and cheese with peas and bacon, truffled mushroom rissoto, very generous portions of asparagus and creamed spinach.  All of the desserts were made in the kitchen from scratch.  And they have CINNAMON ice cream, what a treat.  I am not a scotch drinker but my guests were and they thought the place ahad a very good selection.  We met one of the managers, Jason who made sure me and my guests had a good time, and he showed us around the restaurant even the bathrooms to show off these HUGE urinals that have ice in them and gave me some sort of ""secret stash whiskey"", first time I ever had whiskey, I like it, its not as bad as I anticipated.  On the way out, Myself and David noticed they had a $99 Steak and Lobster dinner for 2, so we came back last night and had to try it, we met Jason at the door and he rememberd us, we also met Rob, another manager.  Service was consistent, we had crystal who said she was there since the beginning, and she really made our night when she mentioned that the $99 dinner also included a bottle of wine!  are you kidding me, a freaking bottle of wine, ribeye steak ( cooked perfectly by the way), 2 lobster tails,appetizers and dessert for $99 in Vegas, I will be back the first week of december and for NYE, I will see P.J. Clarke's again.  They also gave me a shot glass so I will remember them.  Thank you and keep up the good work",5bB7_T7_dXRZesGWyXdqXQ,0,0,5,ZoyGs-wY-pMz4ijHiGvqUw

Try to get there earlier rather then later because they ran out before 6pm when I went last week.  But JB at the raw bar was really nice and hooked us up with some cocktail shrimp and sliders!  And Ryan who was also shucking the oysters was very friendly and professional.  I went to P.J. Clarke's 2 nights in a row while I was in Vegas. The other night we had the $99 deal for 2.

847535,2011-12-29,1,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"Prix Fixe Event Review:

We chose P.J. Clarke's to host a family member's 100th birthday.  As there were 
roughly 50 people attending, we chose to do a prix fixe menu in the Sidecar room.  We chose a $45 per head menu that included soup, salad, entree, 4 family-style sides and dessert.

From the beginning, there were glitches.  We called the restaurant several (4) times to set up an appointment to discuss the menu.  No returned calls despite direct promises to call us back.  At that point, we started to reconsider our choice.  However, we finally set something up and had our menu appointment.  The staff was very apologetic but, still, not a good start.

The day of the event, the restaurant was really welcoming and let us set up in the room prior to the event.  It was great having that flexibility, we didn't feel pressured to get in and out.

Unfortunately, when the dinner started, so did the problems.  The main problem was that they understaffed the event.  There were 2-4 servers working the event, but most were just bringing out the food.  It was really hard to get refills, silverware, etc.

During dinner, the tomato soup, which, per the contract, was to include grilled cheese toast, did not arrive at the tables with the toast.  We asked the waitress about it and she said, with a bit of attitude, ""no one told me that it was supposed to come with the soup."" It was clearly on the menus sitting at every table.  So, we had to then flag down the night manager who apologized and handed out toast to everyone (she was really nice and helpful). Sadly, most people had finished their soup at that point. 

Then, they brought out the salads.  Many of them didn't have salad dressing and, once again, waiters had to be flagged down. Next, they brought the entrees, but didn't provide steak knives for the skirt steak.  Basic necessities were hard to come by for this meal.

The family-style sides were really laughable though.  To my table of 10, they brought 20 tater tots to share, two tiny pots of mushrooms, and14 asparagus spears.  They, once again, forgot the french fries, and when those finally arrived, it consisted of roughly two-four handfuls for the table.  Really stingy, in my opinion.  I would have preferred larger portions of just two sides.

The dessert consisted of cheesecake and cobbler.  Two slices of each per 10 person table. Yeah......

I really like the sidecar room and think it's a great spot to host an event.  My main concern with this event was the service or lack thereof.  It was really stressful to keep running around, hunting down staff, to fix basic issues like issuing silverware and providing salad dressing.  Also, some of the staff weren't very friendly at times and I saw one of them giving unwarranted attitude to one of the elderly guests.  The bartender, however, was awesome and really nice to everyone.

Overall, the food was good but the service was lacking.  I would probably return, but only for a small dinner.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,3,2,2,46SbfHm0-ShpmUNGD0hnkA

I guess some people don't like the floral aspect of the cocktail and our server hung around while I sampled it to make sure I was going to like it - something I really appreciate.
My calamari was perfectly cooked and served with a dipping sauce and pickled peppers that were just the right spice level.  Not hot at all, just nicely flavorful.  The portion was generous and I would be happy to come back again for this dish and maybe just another app.
For my entree I ordered the steak frites, which was a 10 oz skirt steak, a cut of meat I really love.  All of the steaks came with your choice of sauce and I selected the au poivre, but wish I hadn't.  My steak was cooked as ordered, but the sauce was not to my liking.  I have had steak au poivre before, but this was lacking the distinctive pepper flavor and instead of being able to taste the cream and cognac, it had more of a beef gravy-like flavor that wasn't very good.  The fries were OK.
After two generous dishes, I did not have room for dessert, but don't feel as though I was missing anything.  The selections were very humdrum - bread pudding, cheesecake, ice cream, etc.

The Fear and Loathing was PJ Clarke's version of the classic long island iced tea spiked with absinthe and energy.   I guess I was more intrigued with the absinthe and energy, but I was pretty dissappointed.  It wasn't that pleasant.  What made it even more dissappointing was that it was $15.

If you're an oyster lover, this is your oasis. Their $1 happy hour oysters are shucked right before your eyes, and they're shucked right after you place your order, not a second before. 

Obviously, these aren't the absolute best oysters money can buy, but, for $1 they're beyond worth it. If I lived in the area, I'd be here at least once a week.

I also tried their Tuna Tartare Tacos. While they weren't bad at all, I wouldn't order them again. They're cute tiny little tacos. I mean, less than bite size. It was something out of a Dr. Seuss book. The shells had so much flavor themselves, that, it took away from the tuna.

The service is great, the ambiance is terrific. I only wish their bar area was a bit bigger, it was a tad cramped, sitting between patrons.

Again, if you like oysters, this place is a must!

We chose P.J. Clarke's because of the good reviews and reasonable prices. It's a steakhouse, so you're going to pay a good amount, but by comparison, it's pretty reasonable.

The thing that bugged me the most is that we were seated in their ""patio"" section, which isn't really a patio at all. Part of the restaurant juts out into the Forum Shops mall. So, it was very much like having a romantic evening, in Vegas, inside of a mall.

The food was good, but next time I would definitely skip the macaroni and cheese. I was expecting a baked dish, but it was more of noodles with alfredo sauce and breadcrumbs sprinkled on top.",1WPCCxluycnQKYKRsyKqnA,0,0,3,d674m7oK8x7Se8nAIQZRcg

We were here for their HH which offered $1 Oysters from 3pm-6pm, reduced prices on appetizers and beer, and buy one - get one cocktail of the day. Since it was an organized event we were able to take advantage of the HH items at a table instead of the bar. I started off with half a dozen Crystal Pointe oysters. They tasted incredibly fresh and I knew six would not be enough. Next dozen of oysters were California oysters but I don't remember the variety name. These were large, meaty and filling. Very delicious and fresh. We were provided with Tabasco  sauce in addition to mignonette, cocktail and horseradish sauces. 

I also had their Cod Bites (picture provided) which were $9.50 for two decently sized pieces of battered cod. It was perfectly cooked with great flavor. They also offered $1.50 sliders as well. 

The food and the oysters were fantastic. This is such an amazing deal for FRESH, high quality oysters.

2150538,2013-02-21,3,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"This is a review of the happy hour.

The Skinny: poor execution of American Classics but still edible... I guess (3) service: it's okay at the bar - we had to get our bartender's attention quite a few times though (2.5) value: for the price we paid, you'd do a lot better elsewhere (2.5)

The hubs and I had to schlep it down to Forum Shops because of a shopping errand for my mom. While we were at it, we decided to hit P.J. Clarke's for their happy hour. 

Just to preface, we don't indulge in oysters so if you're interested in the $1 oyster thing, this review might not apply to you. We ordered the buffalo chicken lettuce wraps ($7.90), crispy cod pieces ($9.50), a slider ($1.50), and the baked macaroni and cheese ($6.10).

I'd say definitely pass on the slider. Too little meat in the burger and of what was there, it was under seasoned. The bun, unfortunately, was hard and had an unpleasant texture. After one bite, we left the remaining bread alone.

The buffalo chicken lettuce wraps were odd. I guess if you are looking for a lighter alternative to buffalo chicken wings then perhaps this might appeal. However if you throw in the blue cheese dressing , it might be a wash. The buffalo chicken wraps were essentially diced up pieces of chicken breast - either grilled or sauteed - drenched in buffalo wing sauce and then served with lettuce and pickled cucumber and some carrot curls. Decidedly meh... if you're craving buffalo chicken wings, these are a poor substitute. The texture of the chicken was overly firm despite the dicing. Although the pickled cucumbers were okay, the whole plate needed more of the carrot and the addition of celery to cut through the heat. The blue cheese dressing was not overly ""blue cheesy"" and was solid.

Baked macaroni and cheese with bacon and peas was okay. The cheese sauce was overly thick, gumming the pasta shells together to make an unpleasant texture. The flavor balance of the dish wasn't quite right either - there was a little too much bacon and not enough cheese. For the serving size and the cost, I'd skip this one too.

The best thing was definitely the fried cod pieces. The batter was light and held well together with the fish. The tartar sauce was good but not spectacular - requiring perhaps a little more acidity to make it more interesting. That being said, you could probably get something like this at a much better price elsewhere.

Of note, we did sit next a couple who ordered the chef's happy hour special of the day which were the ahi tuna tacos. I have to say, it was embarrassing. The tuna tacos were about the size of a taco made for a Smurf (FYI - smurfs are 3 apples tall). I think I could have fit all six tacos in the palm of my hand and consumed it in one bite. Although I did not try this item myself, given the portion size, I would highly recommend against ordering this. (Unless you are a high roller Smurf with money to burn in.)

All in all, this meal set us back about $30 which is expensive for happy hour specials. Although the food is indeed edible - probably between a level of 2.5 to a 3 star - the value for your money just isn't there. So overall, I'd say 2.5 stars rounded down to a 2 when you factor in the cost. Avoid if you're not interested in oysters or drink specials. 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,5,2,Hr88V46k3RUSdKukwZRCcQ

They have different types depending on what's available.  Certain drinks are also half off.  There aren't any other happy hour food specials, but there is some other bar food you can order.  We got the beef dip sliders (came two per order) and the calamari.  With a dozen oysters and a Newcastle each we were actually really full.  The serving of the calamari is huge, we couldn't finish it.  The oysters come with cocktail sauce, straight horseradish, and an mignonette sauce.

I glanced at the rest of the menu and it's kinda pricey.  Overall we were satisfied.

Honestly one of the first impressions got was had total New York vibe from first step walk into the restaurant too even the exterior design. I felt like I was going into basement or someplace dark for dinner because at times felt like needed more lighting just too read the menu. The whole service staff had the traditional white collar shirts, black tie, and black apron. Really style you see at high end steak house in New York. Too all the pictures hanging on the walls from different perspectives of the city, and the the white paper instead of tablecloth. Too daily specials written on different parts of the walls chalkboard style. If want be in New York State of mind this restaurant has the vibe.

The food since big party ordered few different apps so got too try the parmesan potatoes (sure not the exact name), and  calamari (one with hot peppers and one without). The parmesan potatoes were really good! I like the balance between the cheese and potatoes neither one dominated the other flavor wise. Nice crispy outside and hot moist inside! The presentation got give props for small cast iron skillet enough too fit six perfectly. The calamari enjoyed both of them. I enjoy spicy food so prefer the ones with the hot peppers. Spice level nothing but still like little extra something added too the depth of flavor. It nice size portion, golden crispy outside, and nice tartar sauce came as compliment dipping sauce. 

I had clam chowder too start meal. It was solid nothing too brag about but soup that order again in heart beat. My entree I ordered the fish and chips. I LOVED the batter that the fish was fried in. It was beer batter but also they used nice IPA beer. It had nice golden crispy slightly on the darker side thinking maybe the IPA just cheap beer. Yet it not heavy heavy batter still light and once break the crust the fish steaming hot and moist. The fish size in one monster piece. It covers the plate on top of bed of skinny fries. The shoe strings fries were nothing special. It lot of food. Bargain.

At $1/oyster, you are getting quality stuff.  Fresh oysters with a new type of oyster every day.  I don't know what we had, Washington Shuckums or something like that? Either way, they were amazing and worth every penny.

I'd skip out on the food and drinks and just get oysters here.  I also ordered Parmesan Tater Tots and they weren't that special--not worth the money.  We had 8 people in our party and were given just 8 tater tots dividing it up to $1/person for one tater tot, that could've been 8 more oysters!

Elisa C. raved about the mussels, which I didn't see on the menu so that's a shame since she REALLY, REALLY raved about them.

Our servers were kind of herp derp.  The one who seated us and took our drink orders was nervous as it was his first day, but he did fine.  We just wanted water and didn't make things hard for him.

That's right, FRESH delicious $1 oysters shucked in front of you by a very hardworking and sweet server as you sit enjoying your cheap beer and other happy hour tidings. We had three dozen and probably could have done four but we had dinner plans later. Wut wut, I know! We had two kinds while we were there, North Point and something from the east coast. I don't remember because I was too busy drowning my oysters in horseradish and vinegarette. Mmmm...

There are also other munchies available like $1.50 sliders with juicy minature patties and toasted buns and fried cod fish (think fish & chips but minus the fries). 

Skip: The ahi tuna. Sizing was hilarious- it looked like a children's playset with little taco shells that only Barbie would consider the right size. Taste was non-existent because by the time it was in your mouth, you couldn't find it anymore.

I had the scallops with bacon on a bed of corn. It was 5 stars itself. A couple people had the Mac and Cheese with lobster. It looked really good. 
The alcohol connoisseur put the bartender to the test. Asked for a round of Sazerac Cocktails. This is now my new drink of choice. Supposedly the first cocktail of the united states. The bartender new it and was able to make up 4 of them without even blinking an eye. I HIGHLY recommend giving that a try.

1 teaspoon of simple syrup (or 1 sugar cube or 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar)

The burger that I ordered was alright, I kind of gave up on eating it...it was one that you put together yourself and the ingredients that they gave me to do so weren't cooperating with each other.  I ended up covered in ketchup and at least half my burger uneaten.  The fries were soggy too, like maybe they had a light rinse before they were thrown in the box.

The clam chowder was really good though.  But I don't know if that's even saying much, I'm pretty sure nobody makes their soup from scratch these days.

Drinks: some mixture of grand mangier and sweet fruit juice. Just sweet enough for my girly taste and enough alcohol for the guys to love and make me in a jolly mood.

Starters: 
tuna tar tar mini tacos - a bit small to fill my taste buds but pretty tastey

brocolli and cheese dip - SO deliciouse, especially getting some of the burnt cheesy parts to eat with tortilla chips


Salads:
Ceasar salads - was a bit upset that it wasn't anything unusual but it was good and the croutons tasted like they were made fresh. 

Tomato Onion and Mozerella Chesse - The Cheese was so rich it almost tasted like nothing but melted in the mouth. Perfect combo with the tomato and onions drizzled in sweet balsamic vinegar. 

Dinner: 
Cheese burgers - Not a fan of the choice but the meat was very tender 

Fish Sticks - way too many fries compared to the fish but the fish tasted sooo yummy. 

Chicken Pot Pie - my favorite dinner dish. I think it would taste fine without the chicken (being a vegetarian fan) but i will admit the chicken was good and it made me think of my grandma. haha! 

Desert:
Chocolate Cake - Way too sweet for my taste buds but is definitely rich and if a chocolate lover, a must have.

New York Cheese cake- Delicious, i love cheese cakes, this desert was finished first in our table.

Catch the $1 Oysters at P.J. Clarke's afternoon happy hour everyday from 3pm - 6pm.  After an afternoon of shopping at the Forums, I decided to treat myself to a dozen of these beauties at the Oyster Bar.  Ryan, the shucker at the station, was super friendly and chatted it up with us as I stuffed my face with Skookum oysters.  Each day highlights a different oyster for the happy hour special, with some from Washington, British Columbia, and California.  The oysters were incredibly fresh and plump; they certainly don't skimp on the choices.  Sitting at the oyster bar is a fun way to see the shucking take place and chat it up with other oyster lovers.  While I didn't stay for dinner, the menu offers an array of steak, seafood, soups, and a good cocktail drinks list.  If the oyster bar experience is any indication for the rest of the establishment, I would definitely want to come back.  This restaurant just opened earlier this year (they are based primarily on New York City), so I'm looking forward to hearing more buzz about this place.",XzuGe_Q2b955aZQRHpSjRQ,1,0,4,XmA7an5FlPFPWO1sSMIBJA

We sat at the bar, started out with an order of James River oysters and Luna (I can't remember which was offered during happy hour, they serve both East and West Coast) and the bartender kept stressing that only one is offered during happy hour. We kept telling him ""we get it, we are ok paying regular price for the oysters"". When the oysters arrived, they looked decent, but the taste fell short of anything I'd crave. I wasn't impressed. I ordered a Moscow Mule, it was really bad. I don't know if it was the ginger beer or if he added something to it that isn't supposed to be in there, not sure how you can mess up this drink.

Yes, you have to go to the strip but if you are down here for any other reason it is worthwhile!  We come here as locals as a starter for our night.

The service was very friendly, but not very able.  We were starving so quickly ordered salads and bread.  They said they would bring out the bread first, the bread, the bread, Bueller, Bueller, anyone?  It did not go down hill from here, nor did it get better, it was just consistently mediocre.  So they bring our the salad and we are still waiting for the bread and they come around to give us steak knives, then they walk around the table two times and then walk away without leaving us the knives.  We finish the salads, right as they bring out the bread.  They take away our plates, and we wait for the steaks.  We ordered a Ribeye, a Porterhouse and a filet.  The steaks come out, with no sides.  Oh, remember that question about steak knives and if the waiter should place them on the table...not only do we not have steak knives we have no flatware, the flatware left with the dirty salad plates, just as they should have, but was not replaced until we asked for it, well after the steaks arrived.  Oh, and the sides.... they eventually showed up.  So let's talk about the food.  My ribeye had fantastic flavor, though a little over done - I ordered medium rare and it turned up medium, and I was enjoying it for the first half, until I got closer to the bone when what was medium turned into medium well.  Now, please understand that steaks continue to cook after you remove them from heat, so if I would have been able to eat the steak when it came out, perhaps it would have been okay, but remember earlier when I said we had steaks but no flatware, that may have made all the difference in how done the steak was.  So, I just left the second half uneaten, paid our bill and left.  $200 bill for three steaks, salads and sides, but no alcohol.  One of the worst dining experiences I have had at that price point - ever, it was just skating on the edge the whole way, never bad enough to really complain, but just bad enough to make it not an enjoyable meal.

Went in late Saturday afternoon for lunch and sat down immediately. It was actually the Saturday before Superbowl so the waiters/waitresses were talking about how the place gets crowded and popular to watch the game since they have a wall of TV's set up in the restaurant. 

The service was great. The food was even better. 

I ordered: ""Roast Free Range Turkey Club, Smoked Bacon"" I personally don't like the chibata bread all that much because it's a little tougher than I can handle but this sandwich had a lot of flavor and was plenty chewable.

With the help of my fellow yelpers, I decided to get my oyster fix here at PJ Clarkes. I was always very leery of eating oysters here in Vegas for obvious reasons but I knew that good oysters did exist in this town and it's just a matter of finding them.

So when I stumbled upon reviews for this place, I knew I had to try it out. If they were bad, at least they where only a buck a piece. 

I can't help but make the analogy that these $1 oysters are like the equivalent to dudes getting free drink tickets for a strip club. You're lured in by the fact that something is practically free. You scope out the place with the intention of spending the minimum amount of money because you wanna get the most bang for your buck (pun intended) and before you know it, you're popping bottles of champagne. Which is exactly what my sister and I ended up doing. Lack of willpower even though our server wasn't even doing any up selling whatsoever. It sells itself that's why this is PURE GENIUS.

Anyhow, the oysters were excellent! My sister and I had 2 dozen each with champagne, of course. since we were pretty hungry going in, we decided to order a few other items:

Calamari: served with hot peppers, which was the first time I've had them that way and they were mighty tasty. Gone in 60 seconds.

French dip sandwich: TOTAL SHOW STEALER!! The best I've ever had and I had zero expectations when i ordered it. I just wanted some land-animal protein to switch it up a bit and to my pleasant surprise, this was the best French dip sandwich ever! It's always hit and miss with those things and I gave up on trying to find good ones. This one came to me and it blew my mind cuz I was coming in here for oysters. I will come back just for this sandwich alone.

Crab cakes: meh, pretty standard. Not enough filler ingredients to help out the bland 
taste of the crab meat. It also made the texture a lil too mushy.

So final check came out to be $180 for 2 chicks that came in with the intention of stretching our dollars on some cheap HH oysters. But it's all good cuz we left with big smiles on our faces and our hair tousled up a bit which meant good times had by all.",S2tfbnjoCzMX0U0B_cTXVw,5,2,4,VmtrxQppfuZLQCi6pduV1Q

Here I was worried that there would be some sort of crazy wait for their happy hour (days and time located on their website). I was wrong, no wait at all. Got seated immediately. This place has a really good happy hour deal, $1 oysters on half shell! Even our cab driver recommended it!

Honestly, 1 dollar oysters are a steal! Pretty good quality and a even greater price to go with it. They will also serve you 3 types of sauces to go with it, cocktail, horseradish, and something else that I couldn't identify (which I did not like). 

I tried their sliders. I thought they were ok. Definitely filling for the price of $1.50 each, which is probably the size of your fist. The sliders comprised of regular patty meat, cheese, and a regular bun. They were meh. The meat was a bit dry.

Their ahi tacos are so deceiving! They're itty bitty. The size of your thumb. I'm not kidding. I think that was one of the more expensive things that we ordered. It was good. But expensive for its size.

We started with the Rhode Island calamari, which was good. I did enjoy that quite a bit. It was definitely the best part of the meal. 
The meditteranean salad was eh. The description from the waiter was much better than the actual salad itself. There were no fresh herbs, ONE piece of fennel and the feta was not tangy the way good feta should be.
The risotto was HORRIBLE! Never ever ever get this. They PRE COOK the risotto so when it comes out, it's like oatmeal. (i've had better mushy oatmeal, so I wasn't trying to be a hater to oatmeal). The first risotto they put out was so horrible we had to send back. The waiter said the chef was upset and was personally making the replacement. LESS than 5 minutes later, the waiter returns with it. UT OH! Risotto should NEVER come out in less than 5 minutes. If the chef personally prepared this dish, he needs to be fired. It was disgusting. It was SO mushy, I barely could eat it. HOWEVER, that said. The flavor of the dish was delicious. The wine and mushrooms were so yummy. But who the hell wants to eat mushy rice....unless of course, you ADVERTISE it as mushy rice. (It also wouldn't be $24).

We arrived and had no problem getting seated right away even though we were a party of 7 without a reservation and this was a Friday night in the summer.

Our waiter was best described as an aspiring actor because from the word go he was 'on stage' trying to entertain us while going throught the usual excercise of telling us about his favorites on the menu, the story behind the restaurant, how they prepare their food, etc. For the most part it was entertaining until we asked for regualar ice water instead of bottled and he launched into a speech about how bad the water from Lake Mead is to drink and that its 'filled with discarded anibiotics' which he said make prescribed antibiotics less effective at best! Huh?? I've lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and I've never heard this and I've never had a problem with antibiotics being less than effective. At this point it became obvious he was just trying to do a hard upsell on us to get the bottled water. I insisted on the tap water and he got it for us.

As far as the food, the waiter was talking up the 'amazing, incredible, signature appetizer' which was tater tot like potato cakes. Well after a buildup like that, we decided to try a few orders for the table. We discovered that they were exactly like regular tater tots except perhaps the texture of them was a bit creamier than the store bought version. Strike two for the waiter's credibility.

I also ordered the clam chowder and this was the absolute highlight of the evening, hands down the best bowl of New England Style chowder I've ever had. 

Next we ordered our entrees. I ordered the fish and chips and my daughter ordered the steak. We were told by our waiter that the place is know for their beef in particular because its sourced from some ranch in the midwest where the cows roam on 20,000 acres, etc. 

My fish and chips were absolutely bland as bland could be. I had to resort to drowning them in malt vinegar and tartar sauce to make them edible. 

As for the famous, incredible steak they are known for...tough and it had a strange texture. Strike three.

All in all this experience was very hit and miss at best, probably more miss than hit. Were it not for the clam chowder, I'd rate this at two stars. I won't be going back.",bCglPCiltb6206DVttvvBw,0,0,3,eUrCw8-PqKRACV703OfOdw

It has long been known as ""The Vatican of Saloons"". Old-fashioned New York vintage style with a 125-year history of service in three locations in the City of New York, in São Paulo Brazil and in Washington, D.C. It boasts of a Raw Bar as well as a known Saloon. Wine, beer, and alcoholic spirits are served from its full bar with a background of mutiple visual screens, visible from the restaurant's frontage. Moreover, I could watch football and other sport events on their wide screens by the bar.

Coool! An intimate setting with romantic lighting over red and white checkered table cloths on the tables. Booth-type seatings are of soft red leather. Shiny mahogany wood furnishings. A short tour by the restaurant's host gave me the opportunity to see more of the restaurant. A VIP room for special reservations and private affairs is located in the rear of the restaurant where a full bar and table settings for 50 people is cozy for any private occasions. A set of glass doors opens up to this room. This room is provided privacy from the second dining room by its glass wall. Through open doorways to the far left of the second dining area is where food is freshly made. Wait staff and Kitchen staff can be seen bustling and hustling to and fro as they meet up with the dining patron's needs. On the right side of the restaurant upon entering, is where the host and cashier is situated alongside an open Raw Seafood Bar. It's well-lit and have iced-laid displays of popular seafood like oysters, clams, and shrimps. Lobsters steamed or wood-grilled, Fish and Chips, as well as Salmon and Mussels are on the menu's entrees. Sandwiches, Salads, Appetizers, Soups, popular P.J. Clarke's Hamburgers are all natural vegetarian Angus Beef with the necessary toppings and extras, Eggs Benedict, Chicken Pot Pie, Ribs, and popular sides such as Asparagus, Mushrooms, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries are its menu's American fare. Desserts of Pies, Ice Cream, Pudding and Cheesecake are also featured on the menu. New York Cheesecake?

This is a favorite New York City seafood, bar and steakhouse venue, so good that it is now in Vegas where Maine Lobster, Raw Oysters, Shrimps, Clams, Prime Steaks, Filet Mignons, Shepherd's Pie, Rib Eye Steaks are established main entrees. One of my  favorites, ""Bacon Wrapped Dates"" is on the menu. I could just come on over for Lobster, Seafood and Steak prepared New York style.

Possibly hard to locate as it is on the Lower Level next to spiral elevators in Caesar's Palace's Forum Shops. Hours of operation is from 11 a.m. to 12 midnight or until 2 a.m. depending on diners' presence according to restaurant host. Nevertheless, I noticed two quotations painted over on its low dining rooms' dividing walls. A quotation from Benjamin Franklin caught my eyes. It states that ""Beer proves that God loves us and wants us to be happy"". I asked the hosts to repeat them for me because some dining patrons have covered my view of the whole quotation. Not one of the best quotes I ever seen because alcoholic drinks is not my sought-after beverages but it brought a smile to my face. Sounds like this is a place where everyone will know your name.

EVERYDAY. 3PM-6PM. $1 OYSTERS. EVERYDAY. 

Really, need I say more? 

I found this place with the help of fellow Yelpers planning UYEs (that I couldn't make -__- ). When I heard about these oyster prices I made sure to come by and check it out myself! It was probably the happiest day of me and Joshua B's life. We killed about 3 dozen our first trip.. hehehe. They have about 5 different types of oysters. I've practically tried all of them :X Not all in one trip though. For happy hour, you don't really get a choice of which one you'll be getting, it's just which one they'll serve. 

We were lucky enough to try two different kinds our first visit. First the Skookum, WA and then Fanny Bay, BC. I was told by our shucker that Fanny Bay is in the top 5 for best oysters, but I honestly preferred the Skookum. Fanny Bay was just too large for my taste, I'm still somewhat of an oyster noob so I prefer them a little smaller. The sliminess of the oyster was just too overwhelming. My second visit consisted of Fanny Bay again, and Crystal Point. Crystal Point is definitely my favorite thus far. 

If the oysters don't fill you up (they do no where close of for me..) you should try the sliders! $1.50 per slider and 2 is all you really need after your dozen oysters! They're honestly made to perfection. Last HH menu item i've tried is the fish tacos... don't even bother considering this plate (especially you fellas reading). When they presented it infront of me I thought it was a joke, like they were presenting a demo item of what was really coming out. There were 8 little tiny fish tacos lined up on this stretched out rectangular plate that looked like it could fit in Barbie's hands. I'm not even kidding, I wish I was. 

The tacos were a major bust but that won't keep me from always returning here and inhaling those precious little oysters! You can't beat those prices! 4 out 5 stars only because I have yet to return and try their actual menu.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,4,3,4,aygqajog1LI8xBsXf1RhFw

Located in the Forum Shops it was a great location with the best service we have had in a long time.  Our server was very nice and made great suggestions on food and on things to do in the area.

Food was spectacular! My husband and I did the 99.00 special and it was a marvelous deal, our steaks melted in our mouths. Salad had one of the best homemade dressings I have ever tasted.  Our desserts were fresh and tasted homemade.  Our son had the skirt steak and loved it.

So sexy...

On another note, I want to apologize to the waitress because I ended up not feeling well (it was because of something I ate earlier on in the day with the combination of the cocktail). It was definitely not because of their food. All of my friends ate what I ate and they did not get sick. In my sh*tty state, the waitress was very helpful and understanding. 

I felt better after I drank some ginger ale and water, ate some bread and went to the potty. It took about a good 20 minutes for me to get better. (YEAH is this TMI?) They did not rush us even when I had to put my head down on their table to rest a bit.

The hamburger patty is a good size, thick enough for them to ask how you want the meat cooked. Most of the time my patty is cooked the way I asked, but my most recent I asked for medium rare and they gave me medium well/well done. It's alright no big deal. I also like the chicken sandwich, the portion of chicken they put on the bun is huge. They use brioche bread, which I absolutely love.

YELP 365 CHALLENGE (LA Style) - Crushed and DeMELished!!!


Met up with a few close friends to celebrate the GF's birthday. I've heard of the place, seen it, but never had the opportunity until now. Let's start with the restaurant itself.  I thought that the actual restaurant is clean and loved the ambiance because it wasn't packed for a Holiday weekend.  The menu is just a basic one pager with food on one side and wines on the other.  The first thing to catch my eye with PJ Clarke's menu is the sticker price.  Here, you get your choices of different steaks, lobster, fish, burgers, and a few different appetizers.  The prices are a bit high, but expected since it's on the strip and in the Forum.  This is a chophouse and their steak and seafood entrees are about what you expect to pay for on the strip.  The portions looked just about right too.  My gripe about the prices is on their other food outisde of steaks.  Everything outside of their steaks were a bit over-priced.  I wasn't in the mood for steak on this visit, so I ended up with their Cadillac Burger (Over $20).  No frills, above average taste, but not worth the price tag in my opinion.  We had tater tots, calamari, and onion strings for appetizers and felt that all three were little on the salty side.  Terri R had the Lobster Mac and I thought it was pretty good, but a touch on the salty side too.  

Service here wasn't the best. From where we were at, you can hear the chef yelling at that the staff and our server wasn't the most attentive.  First, he took forever to take our order.  When our orders finally came in, he just dropped off the food without even asking if we needed anything else.  Yes sir, ketchup would be nice with our fries. Please, some dipping sauce for our onion strings would be great.  A knife would be perfect with my meal, but I guess a butter knife is all I get.  I also got an allergic reaction from my dessert (my fault).  All I needed to hinder my nauseousness was some crackers.  Our server was too busy chatting with his buds that I had to wave for another server to take care of us.  The sad part...our group was big and the tip was automatically added.  That means that our server got close to $100 for doing almost nothing. Overall, not the biggest fan of PJ's.

All is not lost though.  I still had a great time with friends and the birthday girl, Terri R.  Happy Birthday to my GP!!!  If I could rate the restaurant based on the great time we all had during dinner, it would be 5+ Stars for sure.  

PS:  Read the reviews...seems like Happy Hour is the way to go here.  Maybe, I will be back.  But for now, 3 stars is all you get, PJ Clarke.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,7,8,3,cn8xTLScx-i2rJ_epY-3zQ
4195540,2013-03-16,0,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"Pretty nice happy hour, you cant beat $1 oysters and $1.50 sliders! We came in on a Friday during happy hour and sat at the oyster bar, there was only 1 other couple there so there was plenty of room. Ordered a dozen oysters and a couple of Bloody Mary's. The Bloody Mary was excellent with a prefect amount of sweet and spice. Be careful though as each one is $15, I suppose they need to make money somewhere since they are pretty much giving away the oysters. The oysters we had were from BC, cant remember the name, they were okay. Not the best but nowhere near the worst oysters I've had. 
Overall this place is a solid 3 star place, while the $1 oysters are what drew us into this place the tab quickly got up to about $100 with a few drinks and a couple of $1.50 sliders and at that price you could get better oysters elsewhere. Still, I would have no problems coming back and would actually like to try the $99 dinner for 2 special they have here.",mO7obt6Y_BSQdLdHKXVI5Q,0,0,3,HjU9KUYxEYHh-EBr-iD1sQ
4197498,2011-09-05,0,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"I had never heard of this place until I saw it on the Restaurant Week line up.  I had the parmesan tater tots which were not like the tater tots we used to get in school (is that good or bad?  you decide).  They were smooth like mashed potatoes on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The salmon was nicely cooked, but I didn't care for the sauce.  The kalamata olives overpowered everything else.  The cheesecake was good.  My companion had the steak frites which was huge.  The steak was perfectly cooked and tasty.  The fries were nothing special, but not terrible either.  

The service was a bit strange.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu which earned me an eye roll.  I imagine that the servers don't like this menu due to the price point, but it is irritating to see them express this.  Beyond that, the service was sometimes great with the glasses being refilled promptly, etc.  About halfway through the meal, I think we were forgotten as the service level fell off considerably.  

I liked the atmosphere in general and would come back to try it again.  this time, I'll give the eye roll a free pass, but next time, I'll let it be know how rude this is.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,0,0,4,9ItFJ9tG37zWjG-k_feh6w

The service is also great, we sat at the oyster bar and chatted it up with they employees are they were so friendly :D

It was quite empty...maybe because happy hour was just over??  The restaurant is very dim so this is definitely a great place to take someone on a date!  We had a party of 5 and since we have some meat eaters and wine fans, we opted to get there prefix meal, which is a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine for two people for $99.  Since there was 5 of us, we got 2 prefix meals and another entree.  What we ordered

Appetizer
-Field Greens Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette-  very refreshing but a little heavy on the vinaigrette.  ask for it on the side

-Classic New England Clam Chowder-  this is probably one of the best clam chowders ever!  They definitely do not skimp out on the clams!  Very rich, creamy, and chunky.  Delicious with oyster crackers!

Entree
-Colossal Sliced Prime Aged Porterhouse Steak (40oz)-  I am not that big of a steak fan but some steaks can be really tasty.  This steak was a little to dry for me, although it was still cooked medium rare, the cut of the meat was dry.

-Broiled Aged Delmonico Steak (18oz) paired with Jumbo Lump Maryland Crab Cakes-  Wow, the delmonico steak could not have tasted better!  It was juicy, moist, and had some fatty parts (which i like).  Perfect balanced with the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes! 

Dessert
-Warm Granny Smith Apple Cobbler-  This was good but nothing memorable

-NY Style Cheesecake with Warm Berry Compote- I love cheesecake so this was a bonus for me!  The berry compote adds a different taste to a normal cheesecake.  The cheesecake itself is creamy and the crust was soft.

Sides
-Grilled Jumbo Asparagus ($9.15)- nothing special.  just plain old asparagus.  could make it myself (get any other sides besides this....ridiculous price for veggies)

-Crispy Onion Strings- YUM!!  I love anything fried and anything thin!!  These are super delicious and perfectly seasoned!  

Since we ordered 2 prefix meals, we just opened one bottle of wine and they let us take the other one home.  The staff here seems very professional and well put together.  One server dropped their dishes right by us and the plates clattered and the first thing you notice is everyone gets to the scene and cleans up while others are asking us if we were okay, if we were hurt, and just showing concerns if there was anything they could do for us.  STRONG EFFORT in showing customer service to you guys!  I'd like to come back and try some other items as well.  Maybe happy hour for the $1 oysters??

I made a reservation for 5:00 but when we got there, the hostess was not able to locate it. Grrr... Luckily it wasn't busy that we were seated at the oyster bar right away. But I was still bothered that I made reservations and it didn't show up anywhere, if it had been busy, the night would've turned out soooo differently.

We sat down at the oyster bar and the gentlemen behind the bar were dressed up in old style uniforms complete with the paperboy hats. The classy era that I heart so much! The interior looked that of an old New York or Chicago bar and restaurant. Tons of b&w photos plastered on the walls, even in the restrooms!

They shuck the oysters fresh right in front of you. We ordered two dozen, being Happy Hour, they were only $1 each! :D They had (I forgot what they call them) oysters from British Columbia, they were UBER salty, more than I'm used to but satisfied the craving nonetheless. 

The hubs and I shared a bone-in ribeye with creamed spinach. The way the steak was seasoned and the clarified butter, oOoOoOoOo man it just melted in your mouth! I'm usually not a fan of seasoned steak, other than salt, pepper and MAYBE garlic powder, but whatever seasonings they used combined with the right amount of it, it made us want to come back for more!

4484436,2011-01-09,1,LPnGdeEJyMMO02e02PqZBA,"P.J. Clarke's opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their ""soft openings.""  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening's featured ""softie"" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn't on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar's, then another 10 to get the car valet'd, since that, too, was full.

Hubster and I don't eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I've ever seen.  They were terrific.

The real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We're white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't get you anything else, not even a crouton.

The burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.

What really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said ""no,"" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.

The service was spotty.  The place wasn't more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.

P.J. Clarke's is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that's no typo.  They're suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren't working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don't go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they'll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.  And if they persist in charging for tap water, it's going to be a long road to travel.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,3,3,6Ope3tzPSKRiC5w5TQb9Mw

We walked through the Forum shops and stumbled upon PJ Clarke's.  Given that it didn't have music blasting, a crazy-looking clientele or a line, we walked up to the menu board to check it out.  What we saw made us walk in.

Our server(s) made us stay.

Pretty much every person working tonight stopped by to check on us.  Most of them were eager to share their favorites, share a story or offer us something else.  At first, I thought I was going to be annoyed, but later I appreciated the genuine honesty and desire to serve of the staff.  

We split a crab cake.  It was, in a word, delicious.  For the price, however, it had better be!  The crab cakes is mostly crab, there was only a slight crust on the top.  

Jeff ordered fresh clams and oysters.  He said that they were fresh and good.  (I was slightly grossed out watching him eat them.)  

Jeff had a burger.  He inhaled it, so I assume that it was good.  Rather than get fries, he asked for sauteed spinach.  It was fresh-tasting and perfectly cooked.  

I originally was going to order the fish and chips, but they had run out.  The waitress, Lisa, suggested the trout.  
Oh my goodness.  It was unlike any fish I've ever tried.  It is pan fried, in a cast iron skillet.  On top, they have sliced potatoes, bacon, capers and mushrooms.  I know that it sounds strange, but it is absolutely delicious.  I asked for a few pretzel rolls.  They came with a bit of dijon butter.  All of that together, even better.  I almost licked the plate.  
It would have been a perfect meal, had I not found a piece of plastic wrap under the fish.  No big deal.  I had already finished, but I did want to let our waitress know, so that the kitchen can be more careful.  
Lisa took the fish off the bill.  Super class!

Arrive check in 8 of us tonight and head to the bar.  The first thing I notice is this place for Saturday Night when all the surrounding restaurants are packed is DEAD.. First impression problem.

6 of us saddle up to the bar and order some drinks.  NOBODY but  2 people at the bar and the bartender is more interested in carrying on a conversation with the two other guys there then serving or making our drinks.  I am not kidding when I say he could care less we were ordering he was babbling to the two patrons checking his phone texts etc in short WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THEN.

After finally gettting drinks we sit and are presented the specials etc.. we order a very high end bottle of cabernet which takes forever to arrive and NO RED WINE GLASSES are available Are you kdding.  Appears they have  a small wedding in the private dining room monopolizeing all the staff.

wine arrives we move to appetizers....   Shrimp cocktail and oysters outstanding got to tive them that.. From there everything else was a BURN THE PLACE down situation.

First bottle of wine completed we order a wine plus VINTAGE and the bartender who didn't bother to care if we were there shows up with NO WINE GLASSES AND the wrong vintage.. SEND IT BACK..... we wait 20 minutes for the replacement bottle... OK WTF are you kidding me...  Finally  can't take it any longer and ask for the Manger who is EQUALLY inept from every point of view.  Still No wine glasses wine take forever to arrive and well no food..

Entrees.. PRIME STEAKS are advertised.. I will bet anyone 1K per steak that what was served was nothing better then Horse meat where it still had marks from where the Jockey was hitting it... All 3 steaks go back.  Along with 3 sides which were inedible. 

Fried Chicken 1 steak and a delmonico steak and lobster split for two were good but nothing special. 

OH YES other bottle of wine still missing when it finally arrives NO GLASSS I QUIT folks. 

No Deserts or coffee were wanted or tried. 

So Here is the review.

Appetizers Oysters / shirmp very good fresh.

Entrees  aside from the Fried Chicken Sent back and inedible

Sides HORRIBLE - Bake potatoes nuked rest of them  simply not worth trying... 

Service In all my days / nights trips / travel I have never experienced service this bad in my entire life.. UNBELIEVABLY BAD

Gentlemen - You put the name of a NYC / Washington DC steak house on the place yet its a Bennigans in Disquise.. Absolutely horrible from every facet of acceptability.  This place will never last and I could care if the servers on down all go bankrupt.  DISGUSTING.

I came here two nights in a row for their happy hour oyster deals. Super fresh, delish & best of all... dirt cheap! The first night we sat at the oyster bar which I highly recommend only because they will put your order ahead of everyone else's! There were about 15 orders ahead of us (that's how busy they get!) and we were able to get our oysters within 2 minutes. The second night we decided to sit at the bar where they served alcohol so we can watch the football game on the big screen. Our oysters took up to 15 minutes for each order! I didn't have a problem with the wait at all since my hubby and I were just chilling and drinking for the night.

The oysters are medium sized and shucked once your order is in. It comes with a few side sauces that you can top your oysters with as well. I ordered their crab cakes (which is not on the happy hour menu) and they tasted okay. It wasn't as meaty as I expected it to be. I probably wouldn't recommend anyone to order this!

if you love raw oysters, PJ Clarke's is the place to be!!  happy hour is from a quarter until 3 (2:45pm) 'til 6pm.  it is a chain that originated in NYC but only available in a few places (they have one in brazil of all places.).  the vegas location, inside caesar's palace, has been open for 13 months.

we were greeted by smitty behind the bar.  he's a friendly, personable bartender.  he told us that happy hour is for dollar oysters.  other food is not on special.  also, $3 beer on draft of several kinds.  people come here for raw oysters.  some people eat 5 or 6 dozen cuz you can't beat the price!

they have one kind of oyster for $1 daily.  today's special was fanny bay fresh from british columbia.  they are harvested, packed, shipped, and on ice in front of you within 48 hrs.  the shipment came in today!!  

fanny bay was sweet and creamy.  they are on the smaller side but very delicious and fresh!!  

they have other choices of oysters too but the daily oyster is the way to go.  we had 2 kumamoto oysters also for $3.50 a pop.  these were bigger but going with the buck chuck is the way to go.

the oysters come with three sauces: 1) red wine vinegar w/diced onions  2) cocktail sauce  3) horseradish.  you can squeeze the slice of lemon also.

we also tried:
brussel sprouts w/almond butter -- they chop the brussel sprouts to a slaw 
      and cook it in some almond butter.  delicious with great texture!!  *next 
      time i will cook mine that way too.*
market salad -- crisp lettuce.  i mean really crisp.  they must put it on ice 
      before they serve it.  there are roasted bell peppers, raisins, red onions 
      with a lemon viniagrette dressing.

totally recommend PJ Clarke's to all the RAW OYSTER LOVERS out there.

*note: they have the thick napkins in the bathroom like the ones that places 
            such as ritz carlton carry.",0qQI-n_ZfrwBewAgr1Nt8g,4,3,4,UH7YkhRHDPtaYUdcstNPgg

Lunch here however was in the unfortunate 30%.

The $15 classic burger was tiny ... and not just because it was already cut in half for us.  It was tasty but I didn't think worth $15.  That's okay though, everything in Vegas seems more expensive.  

They were out of sweet potato fries.  I feel that things shouldn't run out in Vegas. So we ordered the ""shoestring fries"" instead ... I don't know about your shoestrings, but my shoestrings aren't the size of telephone cables.  

Most of this wouldn't warrant a 2 star review since service was fine.  BUT when Fred gets 4 bug bites on his leg and I get 2 bug bites all from sitting there for lunch, it's time to get up a go.

Everyday from 2:45 pm to 6 pm, P.J. Clarke's has a happy hour that is all about the oysters.  Available only when seated at the raw bar or drink bar, oysters of the day are freshly shucked for $1 a piece! Yes, you heard me right - get your fill of these ocean jewels for a $1 a piece!  They are served with horseradish, mignonette, and cocktail sauce.

Most recently, their happy hour has expanded to include $1.50 sliders (that are pretty tasty and decent size) and discounted drinks.  On the day we went (01.15), they also offered cod bites ($9.50), baked mac n cheese ($6.10), steak satays ($8.80), buffalo chicken lettuce wraps ($7.90), and the snack of the day ($8.40).  The snack for that day were bite-size ahi tuna tartare tacos.  There were about 7 in an order - again, fits-in-your-mouth-perfectly-size.  Drink specials were domestic drafts ($3) and proseco ($6).

Oyster expert Erick is manning the oyster bar and he knows a lot about the oysters.  Chef JB (not BJ) can also be seen there getting his hands dirty with the oysters.  On our very last visit, we had a great time with other diners enjoying happy hour and the staff.  Good times! 

When the raw bar gets full, you can sit at the drink bar but it's just not the same.  I've tried their serious Bloody Mary's and it's a stiff drink that's filled with lots of goodness.

Oyster specials vary each day - I've been there for Watch House Point, VA oysters and James River, VA oysters.  I can't remember what the other ones I've had were.

Occasion:  HH, post-shopping at the Forum Shoppes
Party of:  Two
Location:  Caesars; definite bar/pub feel. 
Ordered: Two dozen pebble beach oysters, french onion soup, and french dip sandwich
Total incl gratuity: ~$60

Pretty cool place to go to for HH.  We spent the morning and early afternoon wandering the forum shoppes and built up our appetite for HH.  Afterall, who can pass up $1.00 oysters?  As expected, the place was really quiet for a Tuesday afternoon at 3pm.  We were seated at the oyster bar and we ordered two dozen fresh shucked oysters.  The mignonette the oysters are served with was tart and tasty!  We couldn't get enough.  The oysters were a big yet flavorful.

The french onion soup was so salty but SOOO good.  I was really impressed.  The broth was very strong; one of the best I've had.  The only complaint was the aftermath.  I was dying of thirst afterwards.  I sat down at the tables to gamble and downed four bottles of water.  I only had a nibble of the french dip sandwich.  Soggy bread isn't really my thing so it definitely wasn't my choice entree.

The servers at the oyster bar worked very quickly, efficiently, and were very friendly.  Service is definitely above-par.  Total bill: $60.00 - a little steep considering it was happy hour, too.  Might return for some of that french onion soup.",gm0V0GmBBlUlTqoZHsjWqw,2,0,3,y__FropxaLIWUlovcgpxWw

We decided to go have lunch at the Forum with family and I was excited to see PJ Clarke's... sadly my reputation for knowing good restaurant is now in question.  I swore to my family this was a great NY institution... and we must try it!

FOOD:
- burgers were all good (though my medium was more well done)
- the taters were great but the ketchup was too sweet
- fried onion strings were great
- the mac n cheese side (not the lobster) was good but smaller portion that we thought
- the calamari was good
- the most disappointing was the bacon on my burger... i had asked for extra crispy, and the manager said he would bring me extra crispy.. what they came back with was chopped up greasy bacon that was soggy :(

THE SERVICE:
- the hostess was nice, friendly and overall v good
- our waitress was basically non-existent (and the restaurant was NOT busy.. lots of open tables around us) ...they served us the wrong drinks for the kids, and my sister had to go up to the bar herself to get the kids drinks because our waitress basically disappeared
- we waited a v long time before we even got our drinks and then put in our order..

The shredded chicken breast was moist and tender, resting on thick slices of mozzarella cheese and tomato and topped with a flavorful basil pesto.

I started with the Crisp Parmesan Tater Tots, which is supposedly a 200 year old recipe for home made tots.  Very good flavor and crunch.  Tomato 'jam' is basically home made catchup, but very nice.  Portion size was a little small, considering they are likely inexpensive to make. $9.90 7/10.

I also had a bowl of the french onion gratinee soup.  It was nicely prepared with a smooth, rich broth, customary crostini and topped with torched gruierre cheese.  Classic. $7.40, 8/10.

For main course, I had the Crab Cakes, which were JUMBO LUMP Maryland blue crab, served with fries.  The fries came slightly green, so I swapped them for a side of mashed potatoes, which was excellent.  The crab cakes were KILLER good, with almost ZERO filler and 100% jumbo lump Maryland Blue.  Size was excellent, coaster sized and very thick.  Crab flavor was abound. I lucked out because they made me an extra one for free, since the waiter didn't like that the chef accidentally broke one of mine when flipping it.  Extra points for the waiter, who let me eat the slightly damaged one as well as the new one.  An excellent crab cake, just as good as the ones served at Mr. Stoxx which I love, but larger. $34.10 9.5/10.  Not a perfect score because crumbs on top (not throughout) I thought were a little thick, but I realize this is to keep them together in the pan.",B2Hgi4yVUkxuYh0r92OoFg,0,0,4,2LU0K5oXxRU-jB7T3dS9Ag

The main draw is the $1 fresh shucked oysters, but there are other treats as well. They have their other bites that are on their happy hour menu (which you can see online on their site, all various prices $6-9), 2 for 1 cocktail of the day, $3 draft beer, $6 prosecco. 

While I knew from signs it was at the bar, we were able to sit at a table. The BF and I chose Lagunitas IPA and Tenaya Creek Hefeweizen to drink since they were included in the $3 choices, which is nice as we only drink craft beers. 

We started off with a dozen oysters which were Crystal Pointe and they were delicious. Lovely, fresh and creamy. We got another 8 and those ones were a different breed, I cannot remember the name but it was double the size and a bit more briny. I know it was a Ca one. Also very fresh and good, but I preferred the first kind. They give you migionette, cocktail and horseradish. They pick the oyster for the HH, but depending on availability I guess it changes. 

We also got the cod bites which were really delicious. It was 3 small fish filets, but very fresh and fried to a crisp with a solid sauce. Also got a slider each which were good, but standard. They are a decent deal at $1.50 each though so I would get some to fill up if you're making a meal out of the happy hour. 

Service was pretty good. We got a waiter who was all worried since he found out we were Yelpers and he was the new guy who just started, but he was good and attentive so nothing to worry there. What he didn't know, he went to go find out for us.

While it was happy hour and a good deal considering the quality, it racked up fast! For top notch oysters this is on the shortlist.

Get there a little early because the seats fill up fast in front of the oyster bar. The special runs from 3pm- everyday and it is easy to camp there.

First of all, nothing beats the $1 oysters. All the other food items are good, but $1 OYSTERS! It changes up every day. That day, we had Fanny Bay. Paired with a spoonful of their mignonette and a squeeze of lemon made for perfection. Once I got past this amazing offer, the mac'n'cheese is one of the best. It is jammed pack with bacon and peas. 

As for drink offers, check the list for the specialty cocktail of the day. I just stuck with an Old Fashion. It is not the best companion to the seafood, but cut the decadence of the mac well.

I ordered the chopped sirloin and received the skirt steak instead.

It was well seasoned and not tough, order the sauce with a little spice (can't remember the name) on the side as it goes perfect with the steak. Along with the skirt steak I had the french onion soup which had a great sherry taste and lots of onion. I would definitely recommend it with your meal.

It was pretty easy to find 2 stools at the bar. Beer prices were standard for the strip. I can't justify paying $7 for a pint of Miller Lite so I opted for $10 bottles of Duvel. You're pretty buzzed after 3 of those babies. 

The bar has an interesting widescreen TV built into the wall. Its a set of 8 screens that combine into one and can separate to 2, 4 or 8 things showing. It looks like a mirror when the TV is off which is kinda cool. The lines between the screens still annoyed my when watching the game on the full screen though. The bartender told me the bar was able to obtain this pre CES and its the only place in the US to have one. He also said it cost more than 6 figures to purchase and install which is kinda crazy. 

We also got an order of fried calamari Rhode Island style which had a lot of hot peppers on it and tasted great. This is also the only place I've ever ordered calamari where no tentacles were served. I dig the tentacles!!

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say ""hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!"" Much more personal.

Anyhow, on to the food!!

We started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.

Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.

We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the ""canon"" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called ""bubble and squeak."" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.

For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.

Overall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,4,Deq4z19tUZz16ZaUz-A8nw

Roughly ~ 25 of us were seated in the back floor section of the restaurant. I would've given them a higher rating if they found a way to organize all of us into a large party rather than two separate tables. Despite the organization, they accommodated and addressed our bajillion orders well. I could tell it was their first time catering to a large group as they took orders individually. There was a competition  between who would get their drinks, appetizer plate or dinner first. This could have easily been resolved if they advised people they were taking specific orders first and dinner orders next. Buuuuuut they didn't. One HUGE plus that saved them was the check management. They split up the checks exactly and accordingly. There were no problems with that. 4 stars for you. 

I don't have much to say for the food. The appetizers are decent. We had to order the fries to make up for the terrible tater tots. It's their version of fried mashed potato balls. It was too mooshy and overpowered with garlic. YUCK! The crunch fries made up for it. PHEW! 

Next, we ordered the Porterhouse steak and the Market Fish, which as Halibut. The Porterhouse was so delicious and tender!! I turned into a NOMNIVORE. It wasn't pretty. I can't say the same for the halibut. I've had some great halibut before but this one was really dry and bland. Although the soup base added to the flavor, it pretty much made up the taste of the entire dish. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO FOR THE PORTERHOUSE. The seafood isn't so good.

And, although it didn't strike me until I saw neighboring diners enjoying a basket of bread and butter, we were never offered any.  In retrospect my party of four probably had no room for another starch anyway.  But I believe we should have been offered the opportunity to decide this for ourselves.  Service was otherwise good, except I had to ask for Sweet & Low for my Iced Tea twice.

We began with two appetizers: excellent hot Parmesan Tater Tots and a dozen superb-tasting East Coast Oysters on the Half Shell.  I made the blunder of mistaking horseradish for garlic, so the delicious cold oysters became quite hot very quickly in my mouth, but I still enjoyed downing several light oysters as a prelude to the hearty meal to follow.

This time the Onion Soup Gratinee wasn't perfect, because the cheesy top was sunk in a bit on one side of the crock.  But, with rich beefy broth and well caramelized onions it was nearly so.  And, my Iceberg Lettuce Wedge with tasty bacon, tomatoes, and Bleu Cheese Dressing was very good and refreshing.

My Surf & Turf consisted of an 8 oz. Filet Mignon accompanied by Red Wine Sauce paired with a Maine Lobster Tail that had been lightly breaded, likely with Old Bay Seasoning.  The lobster was good with Drawn Butter but almost overcooked.  And the Filet, prepared medium rare as ordered, nicely seasoned, and enhanced by the Wine Sauce, was very good in both texture and taste.  My three dining companions all enjoyed their entrees as well.  Shared Shoestring Potatoes, Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes, and a generous side of Sauteed Mushrooms just added to a fine repast.

For dessert we were going to split a Chocolate Creme Brulee among us, but I soon thought better of it, and privately sought out our server to tell him to charge me for TWO Chocolate Creme Brulees: one for me and one for my dining mates to share.  And, at meal's end, after enjoying the best Chocolate Creme Brulee I have ever experienced, while the rest of my table struggled to finish another, I certainly had no regrets at hogging one for myself.  Creamy, smooth, and cool, it was a magnificent close to a fine 2-1/2 hour dinner.

from reading previous reviews and from even searching online, i was at least looking forward to happy hour 2 for 1 drinks but was sadly informed by our oyster-shucker, Danny that they stopped that drink promotion :( he kindly let us do 1 round of 2 for 1 since we mentioned it...but was a bummer that i couldnt get more to drink at happy hour haha. 

Justin B. seemed to enjoy his 3 dozen oysters at the bar and i ended up ordering the Cadillac Burger since i noticed a sign in front of the restaurant that dubbed it the 'best burger in vegas' - it was actually pretty good and i did enjoy it but probably wouldnt go as far as saying its the best out there...

overall enjoyed my experience here b/c Danny was such a helpful and attentive server, but i sure do wish that PJ Clarke's will expand its happy hour menu selection. Danny assures us that something is in the works for that so maybe next time that im in town, i'll be curious enough to check it out...",HO35wso-psqx0GF--QSwGA,2,2,3,mlcvnnd1LbLoLxmWCb-fDw
