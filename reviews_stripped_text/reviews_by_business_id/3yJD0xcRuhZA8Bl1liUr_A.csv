I got the sliders, 2 pork and a brisket. The pork was delicious but the brisket was AMAZING! The sauce is delicious and he slaw is juicy and spicy. We also ordered onion rings and they were probably the best that we have had. I cannot wait to order from here again.",JuF-MU7U0WmuAL5uaeJh0g,0,1,5,SsK5K_Cmm4oSGZweZIHqng

It's not my typical hanging spot but I gotta admit that if you are into a nice country place with Amazing Food the Flying Pig is your spot. I told the chef to surprise and he did, he made me an amazing burger called ""The Flying Pig"". It was bomb! I'll be back soon to try the rest, by the way the pizza is amazing too. I don't have a pic, I'll get one next time.",yZ7hMvKPi05tre3gYdhKHQ,1,2,5,T5aaMyngQ1HixffLDr6h7w
