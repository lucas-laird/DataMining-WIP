But when it asks, ""Is this good for Breakfast - Dessert?""  Well My personal answer has to be, ""Yes!""  It's pizza ladies and gentlemen, and as we all know there are as many pizza variants as there are turtles holding up the earth.

So here's my personal story about Pizza, and Beach Pizza.

When I was a lad, on the cold Southern California mornings, each day I had a choice to make, go to school, or ditch out and head down to Newport Beach and go surfing.  More often than not, I'd have to elect for Surfing, and by lunch time, all those calories spent not learning would have to be replaced.

So out on the Balboa Peninsula there had to be 4 pizza by the slice places, each of them serving the super thin and greasy slice for $1.50 which you could load with free parm and peppers till you could feel fire in each bite.  As I matured more and started going down to Newport with my son years later I realized the pizza itself was wonderful as well when you weren't trying to live off the free cheese and peppers.

Needless to say, I was driving by Beach Pizza one day, contemplating on eating at the bar next door, or the subway or maybe just something from the deli counter at the grocery store.  I had a quick thought that it'd be hilarious if it was the same So. Cal. slice I was used to.

In a way, I'm kinda glad it wasn't, because it's phenomenally better!  It has all the decor and charm of a shoes-optional pizza by the slice boardwalk business, but the food is Excellent.

My pizza buying from Beach pizza goes like this:
Day one:  Got a medium for lunch.
Day two:  Everyone at work chips in for 3 larges out of jealousy (see day one)
Day three:  Got 2 larges (less people working) and a medium to take home.
Day four: Pizza boxes are piled nearly chest deep in our break room.  The word is out to our neighboring business who all come in for ""just a slice""
Weeks later:  I lie about going there now so I don't have to bring back more pizza than my car will carry!  It's like being on heroin!

Ok, I exaggerated a bit at the end.",6axzu5SPPuGkJUSCYtMdwQ,2,2,3,JBQENGoZnYJxgswgdblTjg

As I was waiting, I watched an employee, a girl in a green apron, placing parchment in the box, where she was about to place the pizza, she pressed, with here bare hand, down on the middle of the paper, then placed a pizza someone was going to eat right on top. I looked at the other employees in the kitchen,  one was on the back of the oven, not gloved and another working in the kitchen, also not gloved. Of the four employees working there, zero wore gloves.
When I got to the front of the line the girl asked what she could do for me. The restaurant wasn't that busy,  I feel like she should've remembered me. It was very irritating to wait in line for paid for pizzas.

The fingers were pretty good.  You can get plain, hot and something else (I forgot).  The fries were burnt, which happens when you use an oven.  I tried to put lots of ranch on them but the burnt flavor was too overwhelming.  Also, the other reason they got 3 stars in because it was to-go and like many places they used styrofoam, which if holes aren't poked on the top, it make the fries super soggy.

We were greeted right away and the staff were polite and friendly (not sure why so many negative reviews about the staff. They were nothing but polite to us) We even opted to eat outside because the weather was so nice and she boxed up our order and brought us plates, napkins, silverware, cheese, etc. to the outdoor table without us asking. 
Pizza isn't on my diet, so tonight was a splurge/cheat day. We go to a mom & pop place out near us and we're pretty loyal to it. I just won't waste the calories in pizza if it comes from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, you know?
I was really happy with our pizza selection. We got a half and half and a medium sized order of wings. The boyfriend loves wings that are more on the crunchy then the chewy side - and these were, so he was a happy camper. 
I love a good vegetarian pizza (even though I'm not a vegetarian) and this one was great. Sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, lots of cheese, artichoke hearts and fresh garlic. The other half of our pizza was their version of a supreme pizza. (Photo is loaded in the photos section) I've gotta say - I'm pretty picky.

I left the onions on as it was my wife who asked me to order without onions.

The pizza was just average. The crust was kind of soggy.

Long Winded Experience: I have been patronizing this establishment since I was in High School over ten years ago. Our favorite pizza of choice is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It's extremely delicious, but over the last ten years we have experienced lack-luster presentation and portions from Beach Pizza with this pizza specifically. They treat the chicken pieces like precious metals, sprinkling just a few bits here and there to add ""sparkle"" to what can only be called a Ranch/Cheese pizza, not a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. We've even asked, every time since the 2nd or 3rd time ordering it, for *extra* chicken. They go ahead and charge us $5 for extra chicken, but the pizza looks just like if you order it without extra chicken. It's completely disappointing and frustrating. The pizza is very delicious and a unique specialty pie, but is it worth $25 for an 18"" pizza that only has a smattering of Buffalo Chicken on it? I think not. Sorry, Beach Pizza. You have a wonderful concept, and a talented team to pull it off, but you skimp on toppings that make the pizza. My friends and I have eaten our last of Beach Pizza. 

TL;DR: Delicious Specialty Pizza, but lacks sufficient ""Bang-for-your-buck"" in the toppings department for the price and ""Extra toppings"" vanish into thin air as you pay for them.",Fs3R0xOOt-nKjhp0zvG-mw,0,0,2,zGHkklRhoqxGY5sWizIfiA

I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!

I wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza ""well done"" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly ""fell"" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy.

The crust is really chewy which I like. The place is super clean and the staff is friendly.

This pizza is so good I often order it just as a plain cheese pizza with thick crust. I have been one of their customers there for many many years. Worth the drive if you are outside of their delivery area. Usually ready in 15 minutes.,fL7c8H9T_1fUvbGHYxyg7A,0,0,5,u-JqSX2adwaTQGTTg8922g

Ordered  a chef salad and it was just lettuce topped with mozzerela cheese, turkey lunch meat that looked old, and a slice of american cheese, and chopped tomatoe.They cut it up in cute little triangles so presentation was attempted I guess. The pizza was very greasy ( cheese and pepperoni) and it tasted like pure tomatoe sauce. Very disappointed.",QKbIvQ9GU7P7I86FXSKyRQ,0,0,1,cNvxU8lC1_Qa5IsfIEHRSw

4586833,2014-11-09,0,tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg,"Wanted to try Beach Pizza, since it's closer than the place I usually go to, Roccos NY Pizza.  Large 3 item Pizza, chicken parm sub, and an order of buffalo wings.  
The whole order of food, was sub-par, at best.  The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest.  The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese.  The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good.  For the prices, not a real good value.  For 1/2 the price, might be worth consideration for folks who usually order Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.
Nice friendly staff and fast service, was the only bright spot.  Will not return.",soioEgv0p4TRGurFMoTLHQ,1,0,1,0Tw78_uS2pcW2MloBRRKvw

The quality of pizza has also sloped downhill. My most recent visits, I have encountered dough not cooked all the way through. Suffice it to say, I will be looking elsewhere for a good local pizza place to order from.",kiFx0RnyMY2HkkEegedMOg,4,0,2,n4OHXuGxEWCxsfkq-aqLwg

After they went under new management or remodeled, the place turned to crap. They raised the prices of everything by ridiculous amounts. Not only that but they pick and choose who they want to deliver to. Nothing but careless teenagers now working there. What a shame, if they had stayed how they were, they'd be getting a 5 star review right now.",1vDKvGmVkThjIGrb8B-siA,0,0,1,dUk1afwxnjoAfsMPDXp6dw

Meatball parm hero tasted like it had been frozen and thawed a few times. Definitely tasted spoiled and after two bites I threw it out. My husband had the eggplant parm hero and it was pretty much batter, cheese and sauce. The tiramisu was FROZEN!!!  Even if you order your desserts pre-made from Sysco, at least thaw the dang thing first. Not even worth calling back to fix it. Will not order from there again.

Being by myself tonight I ordered an Italian Sub. Damn good meat great bread and they toast the subs and put the veggies on cold! I love that.  

Reading the reviews about the sauce I asked for a side and it was amazing. Great sweet tomatoes, some oregano some garlic, onions bazil and something I just couldnt place. If I had guess I would say honey. 

I cant wait till I can talk the girls into giving the pizza a try.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,5,ZDi-WWX1Cvx8egDXOdZqEg

I can never resist trying new places and when I have a coupon, I'm that much more motivated to check it out, even if it is in BFE (aka Summerlin). 

This shop is small, but clean. Seems to be pretty well-maintained. The kid behind the counter was friendly and helpful when helping us out with our order. My fella and I ordered a medium pizza and medium wings (hot) to share. The restaurant was empty, but they had lots of delivery orders to take care of, so our food took a little bit of time, but they were still quite quick, despite the rush.

The pizza was tasty, nothing extraordinary, but definitely a nice thin pizza with a generous amount of cheese and sauce. The wings were pretty good. Spicy, but not intolerably hot. All in all, pretty good and  I definitely wouldn't object if I came here again, but given it's rather far location from my house, I think that's unlikely.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,3,r-HvOoeTr1pd4RqJQOwQag
