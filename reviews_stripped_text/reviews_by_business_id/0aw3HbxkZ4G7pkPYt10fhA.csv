I was told a manager would come over to speak with us but none came. This was the absolute worst experience ever at any restaurant.

The food is normally scorching hot, but not overcooked. The waitstaff is pretty friendly and helpful.

Sitting at the bar can be fun, their bartenders are lively and enjoyable to talk to.

The chicken and shrimp carbonara, lasagna, and chicken flatbread never disappoints.

The chicken parmagiana is good %90 of the time, but be careful of the tough cutlets that can be churned out of here sometimes. The calamari and spicy calamari is great when you dine in, but beware of tough or fishy pieces if you order takeout at night. The same goes for the stuffed mushrooms, they're flavorful and tender on a good night.

 I'd say the chicken alfredo has a lower success rate of being as good. The alfredo sauce can be sticky and clumpy at times.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,2,0,4,ihnsD0uV1PLoVqdRv-M-uA

I call and spoke to a manager who told me just to let them know the next time I stopped by. I advised the person taking my order who told me to talk to the manager when I picked up my order. When I spoke to the manager she said she couldn't do anything about it but offer me a $2.99 dessert because she had no idea about it. I should have known better and checked my order but I didn't till I got home and sure enough they forget my side of mash potatoes and didn't give me salad dressing. I called them they said I was not charged for the mash potatoes they forgot to ring it in and offered to send me a $10 gift card. I didn't want a gift card just wanted my food to be correct. I asked if I could get it next time but the manager said no only if I drove for it tonight. I live 20 mins away so it's a 40 min drive round trip. I didn't want anything free all I was asking is to please get my food right.

What you will get is some pretty darn good italian food at a reasonable cost, especially if you go there during their all you can eat soup and salad or the never ending pasta bowl.

The Olive Garden has become one of those places where you know the food is going to be good everytime you go.  They don't move their menu around every 6 months like alot of places do.  They offer consistency over variety.  That's not to say the food is boring, quite the opposite.  The Olive Garden has found a niche that works for them and I for one appreciate it.

On occasion they will bring some new dishes from their culinary school that might be worth a try.  They also do the same thing with their seasonal desserts.

The hostesses made a great first impression by running and opening the door for us before we even got up there. She was very friendly and when we were seated, I asked to change tables because I would rather sit at a booth because of my back problems. She kindly obliged, and was very courteous about it.

Our server was very cheery, made us laugh, and made sure we had everything we needed. I asked to have a different salad, and he accommodated my request.  He was on top of everything. The manager even stopped by to ensure everything was nice.  Everyone seemed to be happy being in customer service and that is very refreshing to see.  I too am in the hospitality business and I can tell that the management is doing what is right to make sure their staff are happy and it reflects in how the staff are with guests.

To corporate, you need to let your employees at this location know that they are appreciated and the smallest details to service with a smile go a long way.

  My first impression upon walking in was not good due to the bad smell. Smelled like stale Parmesan cheese mixed with the body odor of several people that havent taken a bath in a month.  I sat down and was given menus. The menus had dried food smeared all over them from previous customers. 
  The waiter had cookie crumbs on his shirt, and what appeared to be salad dressing stains on front of shirt. 
  I was tempted to walk out, but decided what the hell, lets use this gift card up. 
 Ordered the special   unlimited bread sticks, soup, or salad, and pasta with sauce for me and wife. (9.99 each)
 Waiter brought a basket with a whopping 3 bread sticks. I got the salad, wife got soup. The salad tasted pretty good, but mostly had just 3 green salad leafs. The rest was mostly salad stems, onions, croutons and other junk. They give you a big bowl of salad and it is mostly stems. I could have asked for more salad, but I might have to argue about not finishing what was brought to me. 
   The pasta seemed to have been sitting around for a while before I arrived. It was dehydrated and not fresh. had to use knife and fork to cut it up. The marinara sauce had an off smell and taste to it. I could only manage to force myself to take a few bites. What crap!!!! The back ground smell, and the pasta smell and taste almost had my stomach churning. 
    the fun part was when the waiter brought the check. The total was 28.39, I gave him the 25 dollar gift certificate, and 3.40 in cash. had to wait for 15 minutes for my change., and waiter tried offering us dessert, which was included. I declined desert, as the deserts were probably crap too. I took my penny of change and departed with out leaving a tip. Needless to say I wont be coming back there.

When the server asks you if you would like to sample the wine, you should take them up on it.  I was pleasantly surprised with a wine I probably never would have tried.
My favorite appetizers have always been the calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and spinach-artichoke dip.   Having them as a favorite, I never reached out to try new ones....but I finally did and am so glad I did!  The lasagna fritta is amazing!  It's fried lasagna noodles with ricotta cheese, alfredo sauce on the bottom and marinara on the top.  Delicious!  I had finally tried the fried ravioli and fried mozzarella, too.  Amazing!  So my decisions just became more complicated :) !
And don't be afraid to try the very delicious soups.  My to go soups have always been chicken and gnocchi and zuppa toscano!  But I finally tried the pasta e fagioli and minestrone.  Now I KNOW all of the soups are delicious!
What I enjoy most on the menu is the Seafood Alfredo.  It is fettucini with alfredo sauce, shrimp and scallops.  However, I recently tried the Ravioli di Portobello, which is ravioli filled with Portobello mushroom and has a cheesy sauce over it.  It's quite delicious!!! 
If you get the chance to have the Watermelon Sangria....I would recommend that highly, especially on a hot day!  It's light and refreshing!

I rarely do red sauces. The meat sauce was good; not too acidic for a red and the blend of ground beef and italian sausage pleasing and flavorful. I'm thinking, even a repeat for me. Tasted Dad's chicken and liked the glaze on it. Moist, nice char marks...good chicken. Another satisfying meal in the books.",AP_Znwu7gfrV065FWdvldQ,1,2,4,0FmZQz21XkC3yE5S8xr6Aw

My most recent was for lunch with hubby, I ordered the half size meatball sandwich it had yummy sauce, melty cheese,  and crunchy yet soft bread. It's served with garlic fries and of course choice of soup or salad, I had the minestrone soup. I definitely enjoy the pasta with tomato broth.  Hubby ordered the chicken parmesean also with garlic fries. I did have a bite of his chicken was moist and crunchy, melted provolone, marinara sauce,  the same fresh good bread as my meatball sandwich. We shared the appetizer fried lasagna,  always a good choice.
The salad I always enjoy,  to me the olives and peppercinis perfect the salad.

Something funny - for the name being Olive Garden,  the salad is the only item I seen on the menu that actually contains olives!!!  Having an olive bar would be a lovely touch.

However the staff is always welcoming and professional,  will return.  One day I will order one of their desserts!  I'm too full after the dinner to attempt it, the hard choice is deciding which to pick!",_MYAzzeHgA7BtyG66AIF6A,0,0,4,4Rw4Xl20ZiFmmlAeOhrV9Q

Tuscan soup has a little kick to it. It's made in a thin creamy broth with ground sausage, kale, potatoes & delicious seasonings. They add grated cheese (at your preference), which makes it even better. Always gotta get their Peach Bellini as well! Bomb!

The beau got the Chicken Alfredo. Not a big fan of Alfredo but I always sneak a bite. 

They have some newer items on the menu. There's a special-- buy one now, take one to go for $12.99. Which is a pretty good deal for all the leftover Lovin fatties!

Olive Garden has one of the best Moscatos I've ever tasted. Also I tried their Roscato, which is a delicately fizzy sweet red wine. One of my new found obsessions. & I'm not a big Red wine drinker either.

It's not that we didn't like the food but the service was far from acceptable.  Once we realized that we were spending more time grumbling about our disappointing visit than enjoying our evening out we decided we would just do take-out going forward. This was a great solution as it was convenient, I got enjoy my salad with their yummy dressing and my hubby got to indulge in his favorites along with the warm bread sticks. Well, this past weekend might have put an end to that.

Before ordering we always their check their website since they have seasonal specials and they often rotate selections. I was happy to see that our usually selections were still available so we phoned in our order. 10 minutes later we got a call back regarding my item no longer being available. Fortunately I had a back up but felt frustrated that their website hadn't been updated. 

When we arrived, we parked in the designated spots for the ""car-side pick-up"", but I guess they no longer monitor those spots as we had to call them to advise we were there. A very pleasant attendant brought out our food and I quickly checked the bag... at that time the only thing I noticed was that my dish had broccoli instead of asparagus which wasn't a big enough deal to send it back. So my Hubby paid for the order and we proceeded home. 

After completely unpacking our items I realized that there was no salad dressing or croutons to go with my salad--seriously?! How can they forget their signature salad dressing?? I know it was my fault for not thoroughly checking EVERYTHING in the bag... but seriously. There were also no utensils, napkins or the thin mints we were so accustom to getting with our order.  On a happier note, my filet mignon was cooked perfect--it was my back up option on the Lighter Fare menu but certainly didn't cure my Italian craving for Lasagna Primavera.

The calamari was tender, lightly breaded, and fried served with both a parmesan and marinara sauce. The fried mozzarella was absolutely delicious and the pork ravioli was pretty decent.
Before the entrée, they give you the choice between a soup or salad. I ordered a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the Zuppa Toscana which is a type of creamy potato soup served with greens. The soup was absolutely spectacular! Unfortunately, quite a few pieces of my romaine lettuce in the Caesar salad were mushy and overdressed. 
My husband ordered the Cheese Ravioli and enjoyed it. For my dish, I ordered the grilled sausage and peppers Rustica. The consistency was perfect...the penne was al dente, peppers were tender, and the Italian sausage was flavorful. However, I felt that they went slightly shy on seasoning and spices which I adjusted with table salt (and I don't really do this at a restaurant too often.)

I ordered the chicken gnocchi and all I could taste were carrots. I didn't really have any because I didn't like the flavor. That is why I'm giving them a 4 star. The soup is always a hit and miss. It's either really good or other times its lacking flavor or even missing main ingredient. 
The manager there has always been very helpful. I had ordered a huge container of soup for my family for us all to share.

They are a drain on the income of the company that owns them because they can't justify the prices they charge, thus less people are going in year after year.  The food is bland and overpriced, example, $13.00 for spaghetti and meatballs, $16 for lasagna????  Your food better be damn good at those prices, and Olive Garden is not even close.  There are so many restaurants that have better food and lower prices in Vegas that it's just a matter of time before Olive Garden is no more....one caveat:   the servers are really good, they try their best to do everything right, I can't fault them for the company's food and pricing problems.",Dp8XPHRHByk_5y35aqMNRA,1,0,2,Fh-q9ue-Vk4bH0oTDXABQw

He made mention that our table was the last one and he could leave after us.  Hi, Rude!  He got drinks mixed up for our group and poured different drinks into people's glasses.  Honestly, I would recommend a drug test because the behavior had chronic written all over him.  When passing the drinks out, he actually told someone ""can you pass this down because I am not going to try going behind the seats"".  HELLO, it is your job!  And if the seats are too close to the wall, then move the table out so the wait staff can get behind people.

When the waitress asked if we wanted marinara dipping sauce for our bread sticks, she should have mentioned that it was for a fee.  We were surprised to find that each one was around $8!  Again, these places tend to nickel and dime you for everything.  Had we known this, we certainly would not have ordered it.

The last straw was when they came out to sing happy birthday, they brought out a small dish with whipped cream, drizzled with chocolate and a candle in it.  REALLY?  We spend a good amount of money and they couldn't spring for a REAL dessert?  It was laughable and became the butt of a running joke amongst us for the rest of our trip.  I mean really, who does that, whipped cream with a candle in it?

The tomato cream sauce with sundried tomatoes and bacon is no longer on the menu. I was so disappointed, so the waitress asked the chef if they could make the dish and the cook agreed. 
I thanked the manager when she came by to check on us and she said as long as they have the items in the fridge, they would try to accommodate. 
The dish was not exactly the same as the old one, as I think this was just an Alfredo type sauce, but it had sundried tomatoes, bacon and tons of mushrooms that were once again cooked to perfection!!!  I wish I could get the cook to show me how to make such perfect mushrooms.

Ontario and Quebec did away with this franchise probably pushing two decades ago. I either have to drive to Buffalo or go to Winnipeg (it's the closest Canadian city that has a couple of Olive Garden restaurants).

I was in Las Vegas in July 2015. I did a search and found that this Olive Garden. I drove over there.

I recall the pink paint in the parking lot, which was a fun contrast to the palm trees swaying in the wind. I parked my rental car and walked into the restaurant.

I tend to eat lunch late. It wasn't busy. I was seated at a table and was handed a menu.

My predicable order at an Olive Garden is the following:
- Raspberry lemonade
- Zuppa Toscana
- Chicken scampi
- Tiramisu

I loved it all. The raspberry lemonade is especially refreshing on a hot day. Zuppa toscana is a combination of sliced potatoes, spicy sausage, and kale (I enjoy kale either in soups or as chips) in a wonderful soup base.

I love the chicken scampi. I get the lunch size for lunch. It allows me to find enough room to devour my favourite dessert, tiramisu.

My server was friendly and responsive. This restaurant was roomy.

I'd come back here again when I am back in Vegas.

Please work on the service staff.  They need to listen and be a little more attentive.",26SE5Kfqh2669tKw3MHptA,0,0,2,mh4D-yebb1dFXUiwfqDS2w

Every time I would get a refill getting the server to return to the table would take an extra 10 minutes longer than last time. That was back in Perris CA. I tried this restaurant because my wife likes the Olive Garden restaurant chain. This one surprised me. The service is great the people are friendly and now they have a burger that kicks butt, but is usually not on the menu so you have to request it  and I suggest you try it.",epKXI8YneNg3VRewJYY1vQ,0,0,4,lKICzciVEL3ycIonEGVyzQ

Where other tables were being served fairly quickly, noted only one other table in the section we were sitting at. Nobody needs to wait 10 minutes for a server. I come here all the time and service is always great till now. He could be a new server I don't know, not the best service today.",qx2Qz_7EVtjHzSxbNNE-Wg,1,0,1,aoLHxiGtQh-MITIF3csbzA

There are @ least 6 dishes to choose from but they only came with penne pasta. She felt there needed to be more choices of gluten pasta to choose from.,Hv_Sk1QTTBgOScage3uiqw,1,0,3,5Y4Ga3uHPk_QNo3CXuFa2w

They have a new menu which seemed interesting although I ended up ordering 2 appetizers instead! The flatbread should've had more flavor, it didn't taste like much at all.
Besides that, service wasn't all that great either; she kept forgetting things and not checking up on us in a timely manner. 
Maybe out next visit will be better.",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,0,0,3,w-1qJQgo9G1Pdyn5Vz28fg

I would order it as a wedding cake, it is that good! Their calamari was not as good as it used to be, it was more strips and not as crunchy but chewy. Their huge salads are great and their stuffed mushrooms were the best I have ever had. Their frozen margarita is very sweet. Their fried ravioli is ok and my hubby loves their salmon.",tORKMQQnMJLzCEsRXQikyg,2,0,4,GiwmF1wjZqGAJmQwQCOPsg

5959254,2013-05-29,2,0aw3HbxkZ4G7pkPYt10fhA,"So, yah... I'm reviewing another Olive Garden. We came here not of our own volition but it was requested on a very busy day of the year, so we had quite a long wait. Considering how extremely busy they were, the wait wasn't all that bad, screaming babies in the waiting area aside. 

Once we sat down and got our server's attention he, the manager and even the busboy were all very attentive. I give the staff here props for checking up on us regularly and keeping the refills and breadsticks coming. 

The food is still eh. I would prefer soup, salad and breadsticks, but I decided on the peach chicken thing and it was just too sweet and weird. Even weirder that it was served with a pasta topped with alfredo sauce. Just a weird combination for me. 

Overall the meal was ok but the service is really what stood out to me.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,3,iP2RHoE6LPo6ke-wvHuRJQ

Our server sat us to our table, and right away it started to be bad service. It wasn't the fact that they were busy, it was just that the server was very forgetful. She had forgotten to bring out my cousins Alfredo. After the fact they had brought everyone else's food. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes for his food to arrive. During this moment we had to ask our server multiple times for our refills. She would
Come back with nothing and ask if we needed anything. Which we would say yes we asked for our refills 10 minutes ago. While they brought out our appetizers, 3 of our plates came out disgusting and dirty. We had to then wait for new plates for 10 another 10 minutes. Regardless if it was a holiday or not I would recommend everyone to go to a different location.",P1UE1nIXVI-daglkw-mJlA,0,0,1,J58RSPfaS8XeO0PyXDZWZw
