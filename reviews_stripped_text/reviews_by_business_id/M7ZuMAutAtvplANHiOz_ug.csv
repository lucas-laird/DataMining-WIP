667056,2015-11-03,0,M7ZuMAutAtvplANHiOz_ug,I've never had such a bad subway sandwich plus the guy behind the counter kept disappearing I saw at least 5 people walk away thinking they were closed! He put an overpowering amount of sauce on my sandwich and he rushed me the whole time. Plus I am pretty sure the meat was bad on the sandwich. The worker is still in the back just missed customer number 7!!!,vRfIfs5j-pcY7q0TMWx-Sw,0,0,1,-_cmGKZuzpTyL2iaedVhbA

Terrible service and the bread tastes old. You guys should at least wear masks and carry guns if you're going to rob people.,BIudqgiWdTMsY3tW-LLAJA,0,0,1,9wPpzR8WOCYOtSNSakgIfA
