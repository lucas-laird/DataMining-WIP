I order the trash bowl ($15) and for that price the quality and serving size was very disappointing. It is not your typical BBQ place I don't know where their flavor comes from but its definitely not American BBQ.,KvC0XdjUKDMxCu89OUGURg,1,0,1,TYLQDKRAadG-S2x9qmX4Jg

Let me start with saying I'm from Kansas City and being the beer drinking food loving guy I am I have had my share of good and bad BBQ. So let's get started, first off the location is perfect it's right in the middle of everything you'll be doing on Fremont. 

The atmosphere is perfect you have the flashy food truck parked inside with plenty of tables to stand at to enjoy your meal. While eating you can look around and see the signatures of all the previous guests from around the globe who have signed the walls, be sure to locate the manager and ask for the sharpie so you can join the club.

 Let's get down to the food, we had the brisket sandwich and let me tell you it's not the Kansas City style I was expecting, but let me say my mind was BLOWN!!  I was served a large, soft yet firm hoagie stuffed with tender brisket topped with delicious slaw finished with a mouth watering sweet yet spicy sauce that was drizzled over the meat and made its way to the bread but never made the sandwich soggy, probably because I shoved it in my face as fast as humanly possible because it tasted so good.

You can tell this wasn't made by some sloppy hillbilly standing in his back yard burning meat on a junkie old smoker. This was put together by the hands of a experienced chief who knows their way around a kitchen. I can tell you that most BBQ is really just plain meat that needs sauce to force it down. This in not that food. Everything on the sandwich flows together for perfect food harmony creating the ultimate orgasmic tastebud experience, sorry for the detail but i figured I should warn you in case you need to bring an extra pair of pants. You will not leave hungry and for me that's always a plus. If you want good food for a good price this is your spot!! And if your traveling from one of the BBQ Mecca's like Kansas City, Texas, Memphis or the Carolinas I would absolutely put this place on the map as a must visit.",nDSk8gLI7AYTME5mA4K7XA,2,0,5,I6Lur2XWW_qymQkTJ-PavA
1234894,2017-06-29,0,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,Rex was an amazing and friendly host. Carolina style barbecue was great. Fresh and moist brisket. If this was a sit down restaurant we would definitely frequent it. Come park outside my house!,dUW6kxjMOtmScaRO0rxBYQ,1,0,5,3Xy5fZnwdS9ZCjh1sdVTkg

It's potluck quality served on a supposedly hip venue.  Voila. They get to rob you blind.  And gourmet?  Really?  Ever bothered looking up what gourmet means?

2741192,2018-06-17,0,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,"The Tacos!!! 
Forget standing in line elsewhere, these tacos are insane! They we're massive and the order came with three. My husband had to eat my third one, after finishing his pulled pork sandwich. The tanginess of the carnitas with the mellowness of the crema, makes these cravable.
I was devastated when Mermaids  was demolished and Nathan's, with it. Then Dupars closed and it seemed like there was nothing on this end of the row, other than Hash House ( a good option) at The Plaza. 
I am thrilled that solid comfort food at a reasonable price is available. The staff is super friendly and I hope they will still be around when the new building is up and running.",xBBc2fyJnx7jpQl2KEav4g,0,0,4,HIN65YVNbJeLu1BPvTgtyA
3111815,2018-05-23,0,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,Decent bbq if you're looking for a quick fix on Fremont street. You can probably get more bang for your buck elsewhere but the sandwiches were pretty good. I liked the brisket and the slaw on top idea. Right in the center of Fremont street experience can't miss it.,wYlael7ejt4I3vjaXmpGnA,0,0,4,uJo8akFOHz7UkTfQrFWoOg
3205997,2017-03-17,2,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,"It's just not very good. The service was good but the food was terrible.  We had the pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich.  

Let's start with the pork.  It was super salty with zero smoke flavor.  The pieces of pork didn't have any smoke ring or bark.  It was as if they just cooked it in an oven.  It also came with the ""truck made"" slaw.  The slaw was ok but had cilantro in it.  The bread roll it came on was store bought.  The BBQ sauce was mainly just sweet with some garlic and onion notes.

The brisket sandwich was probably the weirdest thing.  When I order a brisket sandwich I expect slices of brisket, not cubes.  The brisket was tender but also had zero smoke flavor, smoke ring, or crust.  It was also skimpy on the meat.  6 cubes of brisket and one cube of nothing but fat on the entire sandwich.  It also came with the truck slaw and the store bought bread.  

So 2 sandwiches and a bottle of water cost us $25.  There is way better BBQ for cheaper elsewhere.  I suggest you go for the elsewhere.  Your tastebuds and wallet will thank you.",PD89NDu_2ZptUTtnpZgj3w,3,2,1,9UGX2YMh4ObhLkLrHwdIyA
3328399,2017-07-17,0,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,Ate here three weeks ago around midnight. I'm not a huge BBQ person because I don't care much for the sweetness with my meat. I ordered the brisket with the coleslaw on the side (again because I'm not big on coleslaw). Took it back to our room at the Golden Nugget and boy was it good. The BBQ was tangy which I personally enjoyed. Then I tried the coleslaw and it was crunchy with just the right amount of dressing. I ended up putting it on top of my sandwich and it was perfect together.  If we hadn't gotten into our PJs we would have headed back down for another sandwich.,cUjdYe8llV5an1tyVV0sRg,1,0,4,JMSYZV5DmDz062HCX8FNmQ

 We both ordered the BBQ Chicken Taco Basket - which came with 3 tacos in it.
These were probably some of the Best Street Truck Tacos we've both ever had! I could've eaten another basket of them, they were sooo good!
Great flavor. Awesome BBQ sauces on the chicken, and a different cream type of sauce in the tacos themselves. The way they charred the outer, soft 2 layered taco shell, just added to the flavor experience! 
 We didn't add any taco sauces to our tacos, because we didn't have too!

4553963,2017-09-24,1,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,"Met up with some friends for the weekend, and since I'm not a gambler, I like to wander around Fremont Street watching people.  Since the Life is Beautiful music festival was in full swing, Fremont St. was really crowded!  Hungry, I found Project BBQ near one of the stages, so not only did I get to eat, but a free show as well.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  The girls working in front are friendly!  And yes, I agree with another Yelper, there were no prices to be seen, but hey, you're in Vegas!  The sandwich was a decent size with some tasty pulled pork and bbq sauce.  I had two issues with it:

-the juicy tender pork made the bread soggy
-more bbq sauce needed

It would've been great if the pork was tossed with the sauce and perhaps it wouldn't soak the bread.  Other than those two issues, the pork and sauce were delicious!  Maybe next time, I'll make that request.  Solid place for a sandwich and free entertainment!",rAAT39HF4khu-OdxBSr0jg,1,2,4,tPZAuiRP9o2rGeG164cnlA

4823735,2017-06-24,1,w7xofWhjSbWB5sEdkDFdZg,"I feel that it is my civic duty to step in and write a wrong here and let everybody know-- this is the worst BBQ I've ever had.

I made the mistake of wandering down Freemont Street hungry and when I made it to the end of the street and smelled bbq, I was super excited. 

I ordered a brisket sandwich with the coleslaw on top, and my mother ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a lemonade ice drink (you know the zero calorie Ice drinks they sell in groceries for .99).

Total cost: $28... plus tip. 

The brisket sandwich inedible. It was a slice of brisket that had been cut into cubes; with 80% of the cubes being fat only and the meat pieces so chewy you have to spit them out. 

The pulled pork was also gross... had a funky taste like spoiled hot-sauce or bbq sauce. (Not to be confused with a tasty Memphis style tang... this was funk.)

Furthermore, Not that size matters, because they both went straight into the garbage anyway; but 2 small (maybe 6"" tops) inedible sandwiches for $28 is offensive. If it weren't 110 degrees outside and I wasn't already irritated I would have asked for a refund.

Although a food truck, it was actually quite good.
The sauce made chicken, the hog didn't need it and the brisket was neither helped nor harmed by the sauce. Speaking of the sauce, it was sweet with a scintilla of smokey waft. 

The crew was nice.

No seating was a bit of a bummer. 

In short, well worth the money, nice people and eats that likely won't disappoint.
