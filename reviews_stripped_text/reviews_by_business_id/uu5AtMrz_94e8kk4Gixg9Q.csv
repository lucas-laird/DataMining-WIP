This place is great for a quick palabok (they call it ""fiesta noodles"") fix. Their chicken Joy is comparable to Popeye's or Church's fried chicken.

Kalila's favorite is their Jollispaghetti. Filipino spaghetti is typically sweeter and has hot dog in the sauce.

My favorite thing to get is the corned beef mini sandwich.

They have other filipino favorites like halo-halo, taro drink, sotanghon soup, etc.

Only problem is that when you leave Jollibee (located inside the seafood city market center), you will leave smelling like food.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,0,0,4,hm_UOFjR-34qoYrhU9s64w

The menu is filled with Filipino interpretations of standard fare (e.g. spaghetti with hot dogs, slightly gamey fried chicken) and then some new items that were interesting.

It's worth a try.    Not everyone will like the intense flavors and odd combinations.   But the place is kind of a treasure.",oJe3fkvBNv6yYfA9ro2Faw,0,0,3,spsL1nEmx0SR-1m-ZnUYyw

We already left the store, got home and realized we didn't have it. We had to drive all the way back to the store just to get it. The cashier who took care of us apologized. Thanks but apology didn't take away the hassle of going back. In addition, the manager, named Chris, didn't give a fck about it. I worked as an Assistant Manager at a food chain similar to Jollibee and I usually take the initiative to apologize personally, especially when I'm right in front of the customer in addition to giving them extra side, or anything extra for the inconvenience. This manager didn't do anything at all. No apology, no hi or hello. Nothing at all. Even after the cashier told him, he still didn't do anything. Seriously. I'm not cheap or anything but I HATE IT WHEN I DON'T GET WHAT I PAID FOR. Jollibee is such an iconic food chain. People travel long hours just to experience it. Imagine if this happened to people that traveled so far and realized something is missing from their order. Do you really expect them.to drive all the way back?! No sir.

Please do not allow this wicked company to steal your hard-earned money any further. On July 9th, 2012, I was almost killed at this establishment. All I wanted was a little snackaroo and what did I get? One heaping serving of Jollibee shit. Seriously I had the fucking yum burger and it tasted more like a yuck burger. I could not even see the meat inside, as it was concealed in a clusterfuck of buns and shit sauce. That's not even the worst part. The worst part was the fries. They tasted alright, but at the end I saw the gnarliest thing in my whole life. It was literally a hunk of black Jollibee shit located in the back corner of the ""Jolly Fries"". The proprietors of the establishment claimed it was ""burnt fries"" (their english was not very good), but we all know that is codename for King Jollibee's shit.

Their signature dishes are the filipino spaghetti and the chicken joy with gravy and rice.  The spaghetti definitely reminds me of my childhood.  Slightly sweet tomato sauce with ground meat and hot dogs.  The chicken is awesome also.  Probably a safe bet to have your non-Filipinos try.  Skin is crisp and pairs well with the gravy.  And of course, like in true Filipino nature, you must eat it with the white rice.

This location is in the Filipino grocery store mecca and surrounded by other Filipino stores.  So there's tons of Filipinos. So Filipino transplants who've been deprived of this fast food will love it here.  This is the McDonalds of the Filipinos.  So if they are lucky enough to find a location, they/we definitely take advantage so we can get our fix.  Imagine if they took away McDonalds from your country.

1432099,2013-04-23,1,uu5AtMrz_94e8kk4Gixg9Q,"I watched Anthony Bourdain's new show ""Parts Unknown"" on CNN, and in this week's episode it was on Koreatown in LA. After watching this, I was starting to plan my foodie road trip to Los Angeles. I saw that he visited a Jollibee on that episode, and I remembered that there was one in Vegas. I went to the one here, so that it would help save some time when I get to LA (also to help save my stomach). I stopped by before going into work to get some food, to go.

This Jollibee is located in the Seafood City supermarket between Flamingo and Twain on Maryland. You can't miss it because it has a huge sign, and it is right next to the Best Buy. Parking here can be tricky, sometimes the lot is packed, and other times there is plenty of parking near the store. After you walk in, there is Chow King on the left, and Jollibee is on the right.

Jollibee is actually a chain of fast food stores. It is considered to be the ""McDonald's"" of the Philippines. There is a menu full of items: sandwiches, fried chicken, entree's, breakfast items and desserts. I wanted to try the same item's from the show, so I picked out an Amazing Aloha Burger, a little big bite Spam sandwich, and a Halo-Halo. There is a counter similar to fast food places where they take your order, and after ordering, the'll give you a number and you pick up your food when they call your number out. My order was done pretty quickly, and the employee's were nice.

Amazing Aloha Burger - A large burger that comes with Aloha sauce, patty, lettuce, cheese, bacon, and pineapple. The advertisement picture is misleading, you only really get a quarter of a slice instead of a round slice, of pineapple. The burger itself was very good. The meat was tender, and the lettuce was fresh. The Aloha sauce was more on the sweeter side, and it complimented the sweet-sour taste of the pineapple pretty well. The bacon was the key, it tied all the flavors together, without it, it would be a boring burger. The only complaint would be that I wished the pineapple slice would have been the same size as the one in the advertisement. But other than that, it was a good burger for a fast food joint.

Spam little big bite - A slider made from a sweet roll, with mayonnaise. This one was OK. The bun tasted very similar to a Hawaiian roll, but just bigger, and was coated with a light sprinkle of cornmeal. It was toasted as well. The spam was a little bit more salty than what I am used too, but it was OK. For 1$ each, it was a pretty good deal.

Halo-Halo - I think that almost every culture in the world has a version of a sweetened icy dessert. This one came with shaved ice, sliced fruits, red beans, fruit jelly, and flan. This version at Jollibee has a predominant coconut flavor, and is very refreshing. It was good.

For all 3 items I spent about 10.50. It was a good deal for the amount of food I received. The food was good, and so was the service.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,10,6,4,F6oAsCXXFq6T2BE7b1pS3g

Why would I waste food and buy 1 piece of chicken just to get gravy when I'm willing to purchase the gravy by itself at whatever they're charging. To top it off, their Manager Layda, was so unprofessional and ignorant, she answered her associates when they asked ""what my complaint was about"" in our native language (tagalog) right in front of me, assuming I don't speak or understand tagalog. I quote ""bakit daw hindi tayo nag bebenta ng gravy pag walang chicken, eh last pa natin  ginagawa yun."" -end quote.

Atmosphere: This plaza made me feel like I was back in the PI. When you first walk in the Seafood City grocery, you're greeted with the stench of fresh fish. Ah, I remember that stank. Near the entrance is both a Jollibee and Chow King, and then next door is a Valerios bakery. Pretty mostly everyone there was Filipino and you couldn't help but hear Tagalog everywhere you went. Even the service reminded me of the Philippines, with all the workers being super polite and addressing every customer as sir or ma'am.

I definitely had to go with the white rice as the side. The chicken had a nice light breading on the outside and the skin was as crispy as can be. They gave a drumstick and a thigh so you know it was gonna be juicy. They don't mess with no white meat around here. The thing that binds it all together though is that gravy. It was thick, bold, and salty...a perfect dipping sauce for the chicken. Chicken + gravy + white rice in every bite...it's a beautiful thing. Some people may think that's a weird combo but just give it a shot. 

Overall, Jollibee gave me a nice flashback to the last time I was in the Philippines. Luckily I probably won't have to wait another 10 years before I get it again with a new location opening up in the Chicago suburbs pretty soon.",W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,1,3,3,7305DBnzJCaplBOgJ9fjKA

This past weekend, I had to hit it up.  Even if it meant paying the $13 cab fare there, and the other $13 to come back to the strip (note: make sure you get the phone number for a cab, they don't come around there very often).  I was hungover, hungry, and already on a losing streak...Filipino fast food was what I needed.

My friends and I each got the palabok/chickenjoy combo, along with a peach mango pie.  I generally prefer Filipino spaghetti to palabok, but a few weekends ago Filipino spaghetti was all I ate for three days.  The chicken was without a doubt the best fast food fried chicken I've ever had, and while I've had better palabok (I prefer the kind with the thicker noodles), it was still pretty damn good.

The pie was also a must-try.  It beats the shit out of a McDonald's apple pie any day.

Even if you're not Filipino, you can learn to love our food at Jollibee.  Now if only Vegas wasn't the closest one to me in Chicago, I'd be much happier.

Coming from a Filipino, here's all you need to know. These guys are known mainly for their Fried Chicken, Sweet Spaghetti, Burgers, Hot Dogs and desserts. They have other items as well but these mentioned are what you will mainly see people eating when you go there. They also have all sorts of breakfast items as well but is only served during breakfast hours. Here is a link to their complete menu just in case you were wondering. http://www.jollibeeusa.com/menu.html

Whenever you see a Jollibee, in most cases you will see a Chow King and a Red Ribbon as well because all three are basically the same company. Now Chow King and Red Ribbon are completely separate reviews so lets talk about Jollibee.

Now why is it that most chains that originate from other countries just don't have the same appeal when they open locations abroad? I have always asked that myself. Could it be that something was ""Lost in translation?"" LOL. 

Anyways, the most common reason people come here is for the crispy fried chicken that comes in either mild or spicy aptly named ""Chickenjoy"". Now to many non Filipinos, when they get their order for the first time, they are surprised that it comes with gravy. Ironically, they are even more surprised that it tastes good with it! I for one think of biscuits, ham, or turkey with gravy. But chicken? Hay, don't knock it til you try it.

As for their Spaghetti, its definitely not what you are used to. Filipino style Spaghetti is kind of a sweet style of ketchup with sliced American hot dog slices and ground beef. Again that seems like a weird combination but in most cases you will be pleasantly surprised.

As for the prices, well the last time I ordered it was two 8 piece buckets. One was spicy and the other was mild. Total came out to about 23 bucks and change. So it was 11 dollars a bucket. Why is it so expensive you ask? Beats me. The only thing I can think of is that there aren't too many Jollibees around and the fact that each piece of spicy chicken has to have a little ""spicy"" flag on it tells me they have one specific person that does that and only that all day. So that person needs to get paid. LOL.

Service? Well it's pretty much the same as whatever other fast food chains you would patronize. Obviously the more packed the place is, the longer you gotta wait for your food. I recommend to just call ahead and order to go so by the time you get there, wait times will be at a minimum.

Last but not least. Desserts. For these guys, its simple. You have one of three choices. Halo Halo, Pearl Coolers, and Crispy Deep Fried Pies.

Halo Halo (translated in English as ""Mix Mix"") - Shaved ice with evaporated milk, mixed with certain fruits, jelly, and flan, topped with a scoop of either Ube or Vanilla ice cream. 

Pearl Coolers - These are basically smoothies with boba or tapioca pearls. They usually have several different flavors ranging from Ube to Avocado.

Pies - The best way I can describe these guys is remember when McDonalds used have their apple pies deep fried to a golden crisp? Well same set up here but different flavors. You got Peach Mango or Banana Langka

So overall an ok 3 star rating is my pick because the food is decent but a bit pricey. The fact that its a chain can significantly drop it to a 2 but these guys do a decent job of trying to serve the same authenticity as its original base in the Philippines.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,14,12,3,yhAi8hohdzNQIP1HAH49sQ

One time I went with my dad to get breakfast for the fam. I ordered two coffees and asked for a cupholder, since I was also ordering food. To hold the coffee, I was given a plastic bag. A PLASTIC BAG. I had to turn my head to hide my laughter. They told me they didn't have cupholders and that was the best they could do. A plastic bag. I was dying. At least I had a funny story to tell. 

Also, with the new Skokie location coming I will no longer have relatives asking me to bring back Chicken Joy for them. No shame. For serious, the last time my dad came to visit Chicago his carry-on luggage was a bucket of fried chicken from Jolibee.

Though there were a couple things I didn't like - they forgot some of the stuff we ordered with our meal and didn't give us extra utensils (it's not that big of a deal but we ordered enough for 4 people and only got one fork), so we kept having to check to see if we had all our food and went back up to the dude a couple times. Also the drink station and dining area was a little messy and unkept...the workers were bringing out food to people so I'm sure at least one of the many saw the state of things and clearly did not care.

The taste was boring and bland and salty. The portion was so pathetically small that I swallowed in 2 bites, for $5 (I chose not to include drink).

My friend had burger steak. It actually came with a side cole slaw too. It was salisbury steak with mushroom sauce. I had a bite....  Wow! The cole slaw tasted OK in a Filipino fast foods chain. The dollar bite size corned beef burger... well. It's canned corned beef put inside a dinner roll. I can do the same at home if I really want to go for this.

I knew it was a Filipino fast food joint that had food that catered to that demographic.  Since I'm an ""white-washed"" Pacific Islander, my taste in food leans more towards a traditional American taste than the islands....so, I knew I was in for an adventure.

I decided to sample a little bit of everything.  I had the Shanghai Rolls, 99 cent Corned Beef Sandwich, 99 cent French Fries, and a Champ Burger.  To wash it down I had a bottle of Water.  Since I ordered to eat in the restaurant, I was issued a number and waited for my order to be delivered.  The order came out in two batches since it took a while to cook my Champ Burger.

The Corned Beef Sandwich was very small....about the size of a Slider.  It didn't have much flavor to it....kind of bland to me.

The Shanghai Rolls were very good.  They were tiny, pinky sized Rolls that had the texture of Lumpia.  They were pretty good but you didn't get much for 99 cents.

The French Fries were just ok, nothing special.

The Champ Burger was a mess.  It was very sloppy with the Mayo and Ketchup running down the sides of the Burger.  It has a different taste to it....I don't know what it is....but it doesn't taste like a regular Burger.  I didn't like it at all.

Jollibee is a unique fast food restaurant for Filipinos to call their own, Filipino traditional cuisine is based from array of stews to bake goodies from Spanish to Chinese influence so its hard to replicate that authentic taste in a fast food kitchen environment.

Though Jollibee does not fulfill those Filipino taste buds for most from the reviews posted, I would contribute the criticism due to implanted template from of their child hood taste buds produced from their mother's home cooking that causes the steer of complaints, Jollibee in my opinion takes Filipino classic foods and satisfies a quick fix at a fast food type of restaurant like any other food establishment with a mascot as a logo, Jollibee takes simple and cheap food into another level.",sd4uXuVrimUclo0uVWiGRQ,2,1,4,q_DTKrj3Kv4YXdFoywia-g

I order a 2 piece burger steak with 2 sides (fries and rice) and the cashier proceeded to give me a messily put together box of  the 2 piece burger steak. When I asked her about the rice and mentioned to her that I had ordered for both rice and fries and proceeded to tell me that I only ordered the fries when I specifically told her I wanted both. The manager comes shortly after and proceeds to charge me MORE because it was my fault that I messed up my order? Despite the fact that I said countless times that I specifically mentioned both. As if that was not already inconvenient she hastily scoops rice and dumps it into the container and tosses it on the counter as if it was MY fault that I forgot to put rice. As if that wasn't already a problem the fries were extremely soggy and the meat was undercooked and barely had any sauce.

Will never be coming here again. This place is a disgrace to all Jollibee's.",qsF4rL6wEBY7eHg4VD5zcA,3,0,1,moBpOqxhcLYwhd9qLIoZ_g

Came to this area on the Eastside one evening at Maryland Pkwy looking for a boba place. When I saw Jollibee I knew I wanted halo-halo instead! what? can't a girl change her mind? LoL! For those unfamiliar with the Jollibee restaurants they are a Philippines-based chain known for its burgers, fried chicken, spaghetti & Filipino dishes. But we didn't have any of that I mentioned, instead, we had halo-halo and it was delicious! Not all halo-halo are made equally... some do not taste as good.

The fast food restaurant is right next to the Seafood City grocery market with the 'bee' greeting you at that entrance but it also has its own entrance from outside. Just like any fast food place you walk up to the counter and place your order and your receipt # will be called when food is ready. The staff was friendly and someone kept the dining area clean at all times.

We came on Thanksgiving evening... it was around 9:00p and the place was packed, young and old! wth... no one cooked turkey that day and decided to eat at Jollibee? Anyway, a couple of seats down from us there was this cute little girl, I'd say she was around 5 years old and, well, you know, Filipinos love to sing...  she was singing the chorus line of 
Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)

... then my mind kept singing that song all night after we left :)

4014451,2012-08-08,4,uu5AtMrz_94e8kk4Gixg9Q,"Being a proud Filipino, seeing a Jollibee is akin to seeing the Golden Arches for Asians.  Although I do like me some McDonald's every once in a while, I try to stay away from too much fast food.  Ruins the palette!  Not to mention the diet.

Jollibee is on the average with every other fast food joint in and around the US of A.  It does strike a chord for many Filipinos stranded in the 9th Island that is Las Vegas.  The memories are a welcome to most, and to food for me at least is just OK.

We visit Jollibee when the family feels like we get too American.  Gotta remember your roots!  Ironically, Jollibee is as Americanized Filipino as you can get!  Flavors are totally changed to a more Westernized taste bud.  For crying out loud, Jollibee's website it located at www.Jollibeeusa.com!  That said, they do serve some decent dishes.  

Jollibee serves breakfast, as well as a main menu that goes for lunch and dinner.  Ok, breakfast...is not your health-conscious oatmeal and egg whites.  You got your garlic fried rice (breakfast of Filipino champions & vampire hunters), fried egg, a slice of tomato for good measure, with your choice of pork, corned beef, beef tapa, milkfish belly, pork sausage (which looks more like a hot dog), or my beloved SPAM.  MMMMM...tasty!  Please be sure to have lots of liquid with your breakfast here, salt city baby!  But for some reason, comforting.  Although my mom does a much better breakfast with her leftover bacon-fat and garlic fried rice, scrambled eggs, and Uncle Louie's (Maui's own!) Portuguese Sausage.  *DROOL*  I miss my Mommy.

Jollibee's main menu is very, very varied.  Typical stuff you would find in a fast food burger place, but some curveballs thrown in for good measure.  You got your hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hot dogs and your fries.  But add on their Chickenjoy to the menu.  Fried chicken yeah!  Along with mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, and of course..white rice.  Wait, there's more!  Want some spaghetti?  They got it at Jollibee too!  Filipino spaghetti is the norm, but the difference is the meat sauce is made sweeter with the addition of a nice dose of sugar.  Ooh, my glucose levels.  What, not Asian enough for you?  Jollibee also serves up classics as Pancit Palabok (aka 'Fiesta Noodles'), as well as a nice crispy bangus fish plate.

Food's not bad, I usually end up getting a spaghetti and Chickenjoy combo plate.  Did I mention the gravy for some reason is really good?  I'd probably put it on a shoe (a clean one) and gnaw on it.  The burgers are decent, but I've had better pancit in other places.  But I warn you diabetics, choose wisely!  Me thinks a lot of their food has added sugar in it.  Sweet!

Jollibee also has some dessert offerings, mote notably their Halo-Halo sweet treat.  I like theirs because they add a scoop of vanilla and ube ice cream on top.  I just wish they added more fruit, more ice, and less sugar.  Plus come on, the price is a bit much!  About $5 for a large one.

So if you're new to ethnic food, or want to impress that Filipino date of yours, don't go to Jollibee!  Ha Ha!  Go eat at some real, authentic Filipino establishment!  If you're craving a quick fix of Asian fast food then Jollibee might just be the ticket.  And take a pic with the Jollibee mascot, all the other Asians do!  Although he does creep me out a bit.  Damn you, Stephen King and IT...scared me off of clowns for good.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,2,3,p4sg_sAUbAWJU5EsXuqbXQ

1. Yummy fried chicken!
2. Delish Spaghetti
3. Orders are taken and filled quickly. 
4. The cashier person has always taken my order with a smile and was friendly.

Cons:
1. Always super busy.
2. At times, there is no place to sit, so I've had to take my order to go.
3. Tables aren't always cleaned in a timely matter.

I do not know if even that liquid gravy is included in their inventory.

Jollibee is located inside seafood city and is difficult to miss considering its what you see when you first walk in.  They used to have a variety of different specials on particular days but they have since gotten rid of those deals. They have a flat screen tv that plays all the popular filipino dramas and shows which are honestly quite interesting if not humorous to watch. 

I always go for the C3 which is made up of 2 pieces of chicken (thigh or leg but you can ask for two legs or two thighs) and two sides.  I always get two thighs, spicy with two sides of rice no drink which comes to about $5.95.  Their service is quick, so quick often times they hand me my order after i'm finish placing it lol.

Their filipino spaghetti is very good and honestly if they served better portions of it, i'd probably get it more often.  

Halo halo isn't too bad but I normally go to chow king thats across from the restaurant (ask to take out the jelly, it tastes better without it in my opinion)

I.....don't.......get.......it.

I'm crazy about my girlfriend, not so crazy about my initial experiences with her culture's food, and I'm have a pretty dynamic and welcoming palate. This place just confused me. There was the ""Chickenjoy"" which pretty much looks like your run of the mill KFC (I'm not much for fast food on-the-bone fried chicken) but apparently it's serviceable. After that, the menu is all over the place. Hamburger steak, spaghetti with hot dogs, hamburgers, corned beef, spam, slushies with beans in them? This menu seems like something I would be inspired to put together at 3AM after 6 IPA's and a couple of bong hits, right before grocery day, in an attempt to clear out my fridge and cabinets. Don't get me wrong, to each their own, and these are all great food items in their own right, just a weird menu to me. 

The girlfriend was excited to go there, I think it's a nostalgia thing primarily. I think these foods for Filipinos are parallel to the comfort foods I've come to know from the Midwest and South areas of the US. Like a little taste of home. The place was pretty packed and it was attached to an Asian grocery store that looked like an interesting browse. I have to admit, I didn't eat, she did. My stomach was being fickle that day and nothing seemed appetizing to me.

Setting/Service:
This location is fairly small, but they have a decent amount of seating. It is right before the entrance to Seafood City (a Filipino supermarket) and other Filipino food chains.
The workers are all nice (and mostly, if not all Filipino). I think most of the time when we come here we're out in like 10 minutes, it's great!

Food:
CHICKENJOY, not chickenSAD. The fried chicken here is crispy and juicy, I always get it with a side of rice, and the gravy that comes with it is also delicious!
Other menu items that are really good are, the mango pie, spaghetti, and halo-halo!

When we ordered we got rice, criss cut fries, chicken, and palabok (a noodle dish). They are known mostly for their chicken which to me is consistently good, same thing with the palabok. Only thing is, for a fast food chain they are pretty expensive, I think I almost spent $30 for everything we got. It was a decent size though and filled three people up. Most of the dishes are not common together at fast food chains in the U.S. so I recommend going with a Filipino if you can, just to get acclimated and help you order.",xvo7q1ULdDpHDd9pMAbStQ,0,1,4,7mnfmtEcCMTp4OwAWxp69A

I simply cannot back up this establishment. Like seriously, this is not Filipino food, well most of it isn't. A more accurate description would be a disastrous take on American and Italian food. Sweet burgers and hot dog littered spaghetti? Ugh. Soggy fries? Ugh. So-So fried chicken? If I was starving, maybe. Filipinos who grew up eating here adore the shit out of this fucking bee. Their only redeemable item was their fried mango pie and even that made me go in to a tailspin. Why? Because there was a pube on my pie. Oh lawd. This is not good. 

On a forealzies level, if you're unfamiliar with this place, keep it that way. You'll save your hard earned cash and avoid food poisoning. It's overpriced and so not worth buying that teriyaki burger or hot dog spaghetti. Instead, for burgers, hit up In-n-Out, it's cheap and delicious. For spaghetti?

Coming from the Midwest, we don't get to experience Jollibee or any chain restaurants from the Philippines... so of course who would not want to visit this establishment when in town! The food... always as I remembered.. Chicken is always crispy and the gravy adds just a perfect touch to the crunchy wonder and to complete your Jollibee experience would be their famous spaghetti! 

Now.... for the service. Since it was the sunday before Labor Day... Jollibee was rockin at lunchtime and so was the chaos. But for several of my family members we shared a family meal of a bucket of chicken with spaghetti and rice.  I believe the order came with 3 pies. We ordered 2 peach/mango pies and a banana/langka pie along with a bottle of water. 

We got our order, but no pies.. We ate and after the meal I brought the receipt back to the counter and told the employee from which we ordered our meal...she referred us to the manager (she was wearing a blue top with glasses, bun on her head).  I explained we received our order except for the pies.  Instead of simply apologizing and giving the  pies... she goes on to tell me she filled the order herself and remembers the bottle of water and that she put the pies on the tray. I told her, ""no... sorry... we did not receive any pies."" She then states, ""well... where were you sitting."" I told her where we were sitting. (Not that I needed to do that... she basically IMPLIED THAT I WAS LYING!) Seriously!!!!#$%^&*() Then she tells me.... ""I put the order together... I remember I put the water on the tray. After going back and forth for a few minutes... I told her do you think it is possible (in this crazy world we live in) that someone else ordered chicken and spaghetti at Jolibee's along with a BOTTLE OF WATER! 

C'mon! 

It's not until I asked her... ""are you seriously going to argue with me about pies?"" then she looked embarrassed... and just gave me the pies cause she didn't want her employees and other patrons staring.  Didn't look at me... didn't say sorry. Just tossed the pies. I almost said prior to her giving the pies... forget it... just give me my money back. I would expect this from an hourly employee, but not a manager whom which ""should"" be setting an example. If this is what the managers do... I can only speculate what the rest of the staff does. 

I hardly go on to yelp... but I like to read many reviews. So this is a pretty bad experience in order for me to yelp.

Unfortunately one of the diet Pepsi machines was broken and it spurted out carbonated water on your hand in addition to the actual soda in the cup.

The halo-halo was OK, but whatever fruit was in it was very thready so when I first spooned out some of it, it looked like they had accidentally dropped some synthetic Barbie hair in it or something.

Not bad, I say, although I've tried waaaay better halo-halo back in the Philippines. 

To be honest, with Jolibee, what you see is what you get for the most part - except their little pan de sal bites. Don't be fooled by the ad sizes, they aren't that big and for 99cents an order, you would rather get a pack of bread at the next door Filipino bakery instead. Also, if it helps, they've also got a television placed above the drink machines playing Filipino Dramas and game shows. So if you are into the TFC channel, this is a good place to stop by and enjoy your meal to.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,1,1,3,7e4QLM2cVEfHnaumbHYnSQ

Pros: During the day it's not too bad minus that you get talked to in multiple languages despite you clearly are not of Asian/Filipino bloodline. They have super fast service and 8 of 10 times it's fresh. 

Con: Do not bother with the night staff and the service in drive thru. 9 of 10 times no matter what you order and even if you are the only car there you will have long wait just to order and then a long wait to get the food. Usually the process at night drive thru service is about 15mins even if you are the only car there. That's from pulling up the the speaker box to the moment you get your order. However, there has been more than one occasion where it took double that time. One time they greeted me and ask for me to wait a moment before I placed my order. They didn't come back on the speaker for 11mins. There was only on car ahead of me in the driver through and have been at the window when I arrived. Overall, that night was about 35mins for the process and the food was not even fresh. 

Conclusion, go during the day and learn some Tagalog.  Do yourself a favo9r and avoid the night staff and drive thru service.",98T20mbVid1ndCV345vJHw,0,0,2,9djtNOZ9OtwFgZMQB7XXMw

It makes me laugh because it's like McDonalds with a twist. The only thing vegetarian here is french fries. I was surprised and excited when I heard this was coming into town. I remember when it first came into town in LA. So this place is nestled in the Best Buy Shopping Center at Seafood City. It's next to Jason's Deli. 
There's a weird feeling when I came up to it this weekend. One....It was hotter than shit out. Two....I have never seen so many filipinos. It's like one of the islands crash landed nearby. Seriously they were like ants coming out of the ground. 
Jollibee is known for just a few menu items:
Yumburger, Double Yum, Champ Burger and the Amazing Aloha with grilled pineapple - The Burger itself is pretty thick - not your average burger. 1/3 meat. Cooked all the way through - kinda tastes hearty with beef broth or onion soup mixed into it. 
Noodles: Pacit Palabok - it's a noodle dish with thick rice noodles and sorta a thick sauce with ground pork rinds...scallions, hardboiled egg....Yea...I know Healthy right? Jollibee also carries spaghetti. But it's filipino spaghetti with sliced hot dogs and meat. It's slightly sweeter than american or italian. It's also topped off with cheese. Mmmm yea way healthy.
Finally there's Chicken Joy. YAY Joy. Fried chicken. Served with a side of gravy and rice. 
Couldn't decide so I ordered a noodle, burger, and chicken. I don't get that that often...so what? I do what I want. The lines are a lil slow, the food isn't really bad. It's not great, but you know it's a novelty. I took it back to work. Had a few bites of each and it was over. I'd definitely go back. I mean I gotta try the boba!

That's all I'm saying. Kind of bland, the noodles weren't properly coked through so that didn't help either. I'm not sure why theres so much spam, I thought that was Hawaiian? Weird, anyways I took one bite and the rest into the trash. 

The chicken which everyone reaves about was pretty meh. It was warm and crispy, but the coating was so thick and dough-ey. I'd much rather get KFC, which I've steered clear of for years.

There is a decent amount of table and seating areas.  I came here for the first time during the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight.  The Filipino pride is high whenever it comes down to a Pacquio fight in Vegas.  In regards to everything else, I am pretty much Jollibee biased.  The staff and customer service is good.  The prices for everything is pretty decent.  You can actually get a satisfying meal for a good price, for example, a crunchy chicken sandwich, side of fries, and a drink can get you for about 5 bucks or so.  The kids meals are also pretty good deals too.  I would suggest the yumburger one though.  My favorites are the breakfastjoys specifically the tocino one.  If you haven't tried Jollibee before, they are known for the chickenjoy, jolly spaghetti, and yumburgers.  I would say the chickenjoy is the most popular food item though.

I am not much for their burgers and I dunno if I like the Flip ""interpretation"" of burgers....but I must say it is tons better in Philippines than it's done here. I skip it. 

It's about chicken. Period. I do think this is a good fast food chicken and rather go here than KFC anyday. Plus, I'm a ricer and I like my chicken with rice...unless it's a chicken and waffle joint then I heart that too. 

Spaghetti- keep in mind, again filipino style so it has ground beef, hotdogs, with a sweet sauce with cheese. I like this on occasion.

Palabok is okay here, but rather skimpy on toppings. The BF rather get it at Chow King if we're strictly picking from chains in the same center.

The McDonald's of the Philippines. Also know as Filipino fast food. 

I usually bring friends and family from out of town here who don't have a Jollibee in there area. 

Because there are so many Filipino restaurants in Vegas now, I don't come here as often. 

When I do (usually when I need something from Seafood City) I will stop in for the Ube or Buko Pandan smoothie (with boba) and the Peach Mango or Langka pies.  

My other favorite and one dish I recommend trying here is the Filipino style Spaghetti. Comes with hot dog slices and cheese. The sauce is sweeter than Italian or Americanized Spaghetti.

Years later I returned to try again. I have lived a very closed in life when it comes to trying different cultures of food. On the menu they had Bangus (Which I don't know what that is) Fiesta noodles, that looked like fish and meats on the top of the noodles. 

Since I am a scary cat, I decided I wanted to taste something I know..A burger. I ordered the Big Yum. It was a very soft burger. I know that sounds funny, but I don't know another way to explain it. Like the meat was soft. Makes me think of what kind of meat I was eating? It was a different taste.  They didn't skip on condiments! Big A+ there!

Jollibee is a must if you're craving Filipino-style fried chicken, which I admit is better than all the fast food chains serving fried chicken.

I ordered the C1 combo (two pieces of fried chicken, your choice of a side, and a drink). I decided to get one spicy and one mild to taste the difference. Everything was at the perfect temperature. The chicken was what I was expecting from Jollibee, tender and juicy. The skin (the best part) was crunchy and flavorful. The spicy chicken was actually spicy; it tasted more on the sweet side which went well with the heat of the spices. The mild chicken was the same, juicy and full of flavor. Honestly, I'll just stick to ordering the mild chicken because the spiciness can be a bit overbearing (it lingers on your tongue a lot longer than usual).

This place will probably be packed when you visit, so if you're dining in you better grab a seat fast!

I love their Wednesday deal. I usually get my craving for fried chicken in the middle of the week so it's perfect timing for us. The chicken is never too greasy or dry. It's always full of flavor and juicy, the way fried chicken should be.

We've been here a few times when it was really busy and we had to wait at least 45 mins for the chicken to be done. When it's that busy then my boyfriend will wait while I go get a few things from Seafood City. On our last visit, I was surprised that there was only a couple of customers ahead of us and we waited less than five minutes. 

There's a KFC near me but I'd rather drive the 25 mins to Jollibee's.",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,9,9,3,rGj1llXI3TCb9RXOFgBasA

I didn't really feel like eating the fried chicken, so I got staple - tocino and eggs.  Delicious.  Heaping pile of rice, tons of tocino, yummy eggs - perfection!  They also have vinegar and soy sauce available at the front, so that's always perfect to top the rice with or dip the tocino in.

What really caught my eye on the menu were the lil slider sandwiches.  They had everything that brought me back to my childhood - corned beef, spam, egg.  It's like, this is what my Dad used to make me go to school with for lunch...seriously.  I couldn't resist and also got the spam slider - which really tasted like my childhood.  Oh, good times.

Oh, and they had an ube freeze/slushie thing.  Food coma, yo.  But, sooo worth it!",m3qH3d97shbvSCtmUrpDFA,0,0,4,zLqAsWlKLQKOT5gFJg4Krg

Both years I asked for a cheeseburger plain just meat and cheese only. Any mcdonalds could get that right. But no jollibee can't. They had the nerve to tell me plain just means no sause and I have to say cheese only!!!  And then they take it back in back and wait fiv minutes an bring it back out with everything just wiped off with the sauce smeared all over still.  So never going back again!!! If you want anything plain or something different from them just go somewhere else becaus they don't have the brains to fix it for you!!!!!!,dfbLpuMukATSo7mv_kP3qw,1,0,1,10Xpmfj7bnMFjuLnnrUgGg

Either way, this is a low rating for this place because honestly they try... but fail. The chicken is dry and not really that great. The palabok was okay but I felt kinda blah after eating it so I don't think it was really cooked right... or maybe it was the chicken. 

If they had screwed that up but gotten the halo-halo perfect I probably would have overlooked the bad and gave it 4 stars. But the halo-halo was not that great. I LOVE the amazing desert, but this was terrible. Everything was there, but the ice was so hard that it was nearly impossible to mix up (the whole point of it) Even half an hour later it was still really crunchy and still big chunks of unmixable ""shaved ice""",wqcO86hX2t2X9MsDIsIwnQ,2,1,3,ijxPZELyihB9G0TgmqK__Q

I first discovered this place in 2000 when my dad took me to the Philippines.  Jollibee was all over the place!  I didn't quite get the weird hamburgers.  I didn't quite get the fried chicken and gravy.  But then.. it clicked!  I got the Filipino Spaghetti.  I got the pies..  and then I was turned onto the fried chicken.  Silly me.  

The Jollibee fried chicken is just like my mom would make at home with steamed rice.  The gravy from Jollibee, tastes like its made from a powder, was good with the chicken.  I was converted!  I was, dare I say, turned on.. by the chicken!  

Now, my 2 daughters and I go to Jollibee when we're at the Filipino market, or we're looking for the homestyle fried chicken and steamed rice.  They also make a yummy Pineapple Quencher..  Mango Peach pie..  YUMM..  And the Langka pie.  Get 'em and Eat 'em while they're fresh and HOT!  They're made the same way McDonalds used to make their apple pies back in the day.

So..  get the chicken, rice, gravy and pineapple quencher.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,0,0,5,AEzupFzNZZogw2X3CgnNaw

I usually get the spaghetti with the chicken joy, and a couple of their peach mango pies. It doesn't say it on the menu, but it is possible to ask for a specific chicken piece (like a drumstick), and also ask to have a spicy piece of chicken instead, at no extra charge. The peach mango pies are a delightful dessert treat especially since you can't really get them from anywhere else (have you ever heard of such a thing at another restaurant? I bet not). 

It was a little busy when we went so the lady at the front mixed up our order a little, but they were quick to correct their mistake, and apologized profusely (like a true Filipino). Great customer service and even better food.",J3ykuVkcYsttcksT_fIbpw,0,0,4,wuYa_ucK8m06SLNEtVu_BQ
