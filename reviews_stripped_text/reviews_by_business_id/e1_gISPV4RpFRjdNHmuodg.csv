60369,2011-11-18,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"My boyfriend and I were shopping at Town Square, and decided to try this place. I have been to a Coconuts restaurant in Mexico, and thought maybe this was part of a chain, but I was wrong.  I think this is the 3rd or 4th restaurant in this location, so I'm not sure how long it will stay open.  

We were greeted and seated by the hostess, who was friendly, but this may have been her first job, as she was really young.  It took about 5 minutes or so for us to be acknowledged by a server, and I guess we weren't in her station because she took our drink orders, and another server brought them to us.  I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, and my boyfriend had the fish tacos.  My burrito was ok, but it was lukewarm at best, and the cheese inside was barely melted.  I didn't say anything because I figured they would just nuke it, and when I got it back it would be too hot to eat.  The chips and salsa were good, but it was a small serving, and they charge for them when most Mexican places just give them to you.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant is really targeting the younger crowd, maybe college students and 20-somethings.  I don't think I saw a male server, but there was a male bartender.  The girls were all in cutoffs, really, really short cutoffs, and bikini tops.  It was chilly in there too, so not sure what they will do when the weather is colder.  There was also a guy that was blowing alcohol onto a flame in a bottle, making a big fire ball.  Very entertaining.....NOT! 

 It is reasonably priced, and if I were still in college, it would probably be a great place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night.  I will probably go again to try something else on the menu, but it won't be a regular place for dinner for me.",f3XSWDym_eEWKpfu5zG6Jg,5,0,2,uTRWF_Hd-Sbc164ixIP8ng

We have never had to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant before ~ here they charge you $5. The green sauce was okay, and the red tasted just like canned enchilada sauce. There were five of us dining, all ordering different items, and nothing tasted good. The food was very bland and tasteless. When we complained to the waitress, the manager wouldn't even come over to our table. All that was relayed to us was that we could order something else if we didn't like what we ordered. We were there for an early dinner, so there were maybe 3 other tables filled - no excuse for such poor service and long wait to receive our food.",1KuAvlaFloBZzqvJzKDVdg,2,0,1,TPjZ3El4dRvYDAgJpUU12A
125528,2013-03-03,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"Was invited to join a group of friends for a 4 foot Burrito meal for 10, which was given as a promotion. What a mistake!

The burrito was served on a large cutting board ( the best part of the meal) As for the filling, which was SUPPOSED to be beef/chicken, it was primarily rice and beans. 
If paying full price($50) one would be very upset. 

The salsa and chips was $5 per small bowl, the red salsa was flat and tasteless, the salsa verde was not much better.

Drinks were expensive, $7 draught beers. Happy hour was 2 for 1 which was a reasonable price.

The decor was very interesting, even entertaining.

As we left, I tried to comment to the manager about the lack of meat in the 4' Burrito, He tried to get me to believe there was 42 oz of meat in it. No way!

The promotion seems to be a ploy to have a party of ten buy the obligatory drinks in a desperate attempt to keep this place open. Don't bother. There are many other places nearby with better beer selections and way better food. 

The staff was very friendly but slow. Maybe that was the laidback beach atmosphere they were trying to create. My advice for them would be to dress up their resumes.",FECTeYsoRMFjo5fIhfVqig,0,0,1,Q48HrVNGODybSNZKQu0TzQ

247487,2012-03-05,2,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"I had high hopes for a new place in Town Square. A friend and I went there after having a couple drinks somewhere else in Town Square and wanted to see what this new place was going to be like. I have to say, we should have gone somewhere else. Upon arriving I noticed it was pretty busy and I was thinking this might be fun. The bartenders are very attractive and draw you to the bar. Once at the bar I noticed the extensive margarita and mojito list drawn on the walls. It was a fun touch. I finally decided on a margarita and ordered. I ordered the same for my friend. First I noticed that the margarita was being served in a small plastic cup I guess that's cool if you are on spring break in Cancun, but when you are paying $8-10 for a drink in Las Vegas you expect a real cocktail. After that I took a sip and realized that this is the worst margarita I have ever tasted. It was a cross between the cheapest tequila you could buy and fake lime sugar taste. I asked one of the male bartenders how they make their margaritas and his reply was however we want. I think he thought he was funny. After forcing down this drink they call a margarita I decided to switch to Jim Beam and Coke. I figured how can you mess this up. Well... If you consider Jim Beam and Pepsi the same thing as Jim and Coke then I guess they are ok with not letting the guest know you don't serve Coke products. It's not the same drink to me. Just saying. 

I do not plan to go back there, at least I will not order any cocktail. I guess they got it right when they are assuming to be a Mexican grille by keeping it authentic because and you should stray from ordering anything with ice in it and just order beer! This place won't be around much longer. Another flop for Town Square.",Y9u9hcRGWzPC4yQ5nRHgtA,7,0,1,2izDx3kprUuT63jPPDPIFA
253032,2012-05-20,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"Stopped in here with some friends Friday at 9PM. I had been before but just for drinks and stood at the bar. This time we wanted some food and a few rounds. Waitress was pretty quick to ask us what we wanted, but our drink orders were delivered very slowly, especially for the place being nearly empty. I ordered the Ranchero burrito which was okay; it was mostly peppers, the steak was overcooked, and it didn't have enough sauce. While the drinks are expensive, they don't skimp on them. The Jack and Coke I ordered was strong, and our shots of Patron were practically doubles. 

One of my friends ordered the cheesecake and about 15 minutes later we found out they were out so they suggested the flan instead. After about an hour never receiving that and asking for it 3 times, they finally brought it out and said they would comp it for their mistake. But when we finally got the bill, they had charged us for the cheesecake. The waitress offered to split our check which I appreciated. Overall they were friendly, but not particularly quick. It's a nice place to hangout, but the food and service is just okay, Price was a little high, drinks were $8-$15 and food was $10-$15 per plate.

So I ordered the chips and salsa and the Enchiladas del Mar. The chips and salsa came out instantly and the salsa was surprisingly good. Not spicy, but not necessarily mild. It was perfect. I devoured the chips. 

Next, my order of enchiladas came out. They looked so good! I put a bit of the salsa from the chips on the enchiladas along with the black bean salsa that came with the entree. IT WAS AMAZING. My mom had never made any seafood enchiladas, therefore these were the best. The shrimp, scallops, and crab made an excellent combination. Craving them right now...

Needless to say, I enjoyed my dinner very much. I would definitely recommend the Enchiladas del Mar and the Chips and Salsa. Yum!",i-y3RYc1uTk7XlVFxdQrzw,3,2,3,gwGWlrgK_oIadRhjvCHUaw

Especially if your server is the short Asian or Latina girl with a tribal lower back tattoo.

Went here Friday 11/25 with a restaurant.com certificate for $50, which required we spend at least $100. I was with my wife and another couple. We all had strawberry daiquiri's,  with an shot of Grand Marnier added to it. Shared the flank steak, fish tacos, plantains, ceasar salad, chili verde,, and an order of guac. Ordered one more daiquiri and hit a wall. 

Our subtotal was only $88, the server suggested I get another drink but we were extremely short on time and trying to get to a show. I suggested they do an open charge of $12 for absolutely nothing just to get us to the $100 mark. Apparently this was beyond the realm of the server's comprehension because it literally took us 35 minutes from the time we asked for the check. 

So we had a bill of $50+tax with an 18% pre-discounted auto gratuity. Based on our server's performance, an $18 tip was pushing it so we declined to add anything additional. The bill was split in two, so roughly $36 each with tax. Today I looked at my credit card and the POSTED amount was just shy of $53. Needless to say our shady little server graciously added to her tip.
 
I wish servers and restaurants understood the concept of courses. We got the salad with the entrees, and the caesar tasted like it had buttermilk ranch dressing. The plantains were breaded fried bananas, but otherwise the food was quite good.

I'm still giving it three stars based on the food, but be cautious.",Fogj0JSgH_hEOMMIUPpZsA,7,1,3,mCHbZSvrlm_EFyOEaAnrGQ

I asked the waiter if it had corn or flour tortillas, was told that it was corn, however it was flour when I received the dish. The possibly worst spanish rice I have ever had, it wasn't seasoned at all and tasted more like it just had butter in it. My coworkers black beans were not cooked all the way through and she said they were crunchy, although mine were fine. The ""red"" sauce on the enchiladas tasted canned. They did not have fresh brewed iced tea and only served Pepsi products, I am a Coke fan myself. I opted for water. Chips do not come automatically to the table, if you would like to order them as an ""appetizer"" I think it was $4.  And absolutely no heat to the dish at all.

We had a coupon otherwise I would have been highly upset as it cost $13 for the lunch dish.  However, with a choice I would not go back here even with a coupon.

If you want to be thrown into a crowd of strangers consisting mostly of boppy eighteen year olds' who actually have the chance to come into this bar on this day only, then this is the place for you. 

I mean, I went because I have a lot of 20 year old friends, so I like to take them dancing from time to time until they reach the age of opportunity here in Las Vegas. For the most part I had a great time because my goal of the night was to dance and we did. I did not buy any drinks because, that night, the only 21+ was me and I was driving... how does that happen, not sure, but it was OK. I did purchase a tiny 12 oz water, twice, because it was HOT in there with all those people. However this tiny bottle of water does not do justice to my hydration process, and it was $4! I mean I would be OK with a regular 16oz bottle being $4, but not this tiny little thing. 

The first DJ was OK, but the midnight DJ's were awesome. They are called the Bombmakers and they play at other clubs, so it was cool to see them there. The music for the most part is good, it was just that first DJ did not know how to transition at all.. fail. Bombmakers..win! 

This will probably bet the only night I will ever go, until those friends reach their 21st birthdays. I do not find it cool to just grab a drink.  It is 10$ for gentlemen and ladies are free (another good thing about being a girl), but in reality I would never want to bring a guy friend because it wouldn't be worth that $10 fee.

We wanted a night out...something different and last night while at Town Square and walking around we stumbled upon Coconuts Beach Bar and Mexican Grill. Let me just say, this place was SO much better when it was Lolita's Tequila bar. Not sure why they closed but they shouldn't have. 

We looked at the menu on the wall outside the restaurant and figured we'd give it a shot. 

When we walked in, we were greeted by a hostess and next to her was a waitress complaining about the table she had just waited on. Luckily, we were able to get a better server. And I feel bad for the sweet server we had. She deserves to work in such a better place. As a matter of fact, from observation alone, our server appeared to be the only one in the place who actually cared about her job. 

After being seated in a poorly lit area, we were presented with a small dinner menu and a large Margarita drink menu. We were given water and the waitress took our drink order. About 20 minutes later we received our drinks. My boyfriend was seated facing the bar and noticed that at first the wrong drink was made, followed by 1 drink coming out, then the other. 

The food was actually the best part about our time there.

We ordered the guac and chips. That came out quick and was decent. The chips were dripping of oil and freshly made. The guac could have used a little more salt, but we polished off the bowl so I can't complain too much. 

For dinner I ordered the ""Carne Tacos"" and he had the ""Del Mar Enchiladas"".  After about another 20 minutes or so the food came out and it was time to eat. The meals came with rice and beans. Both were delicious.  

The menu said the Carne Taco's would be served in 2 corn tortillas. I got 3 tacos in a single tortilla. The meat was amazing, but it was covered in onions the way you'd cover a chili dog in onions.  After removing most of the onions and a squeeze of lime they were perfect. 

The Del Mar Enchiladas I'm told were very good as well.  

Because I checked in on Yelp, we did receive a free dessert item. We went with the Fried Ice Cream, which wasn't bad either.  

Would I recommend this place to a friend? Certainly not.  Will we be back a second time to dine? No way!  

If this place wants to become a successful dining establishment, I suggest getting rid of the lazy people that don't care about their job, changing up the menu a bit and get bartenders that know how to make a drink quickly.

The guacamole wasn't bad, so props for that.  The service was good.  Our waiter was prompt and stopped by frequently for refills and to check on us.  He earned the 2nd star for them today.

Came back last night and walked in, there was no hostess. Waited around, which was fine because I was waiting for my friend. In that 5 mins, no one acknowledged my existence, even though the bartender and a server saw me. I did not see a sign to ""seat yourself,"" so I waited. My friend showed up, so we stood there waiting again. Finally left and went to Yard House.

In an area with so much restaurant competition, I would think they would be seating customers right away. I was looking forward to chicken enchiladas all day too :(

The cheese quesadilla was $6 and chicken was $3 making it $9 right? Not here, only the cheese is considered half- price and the chicken is extra.

2223030,2012-06-03,2,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"Coconuts operates from that weird, highly subjective, much-maligned zone between ""more-authentic-than-thou"" grubby Mexican and the high-falutin' explorations of Border Grill, Mesa Grill, et al. The menu offerings are a shade more inventive than standard Tex-Mex, and it's not like they're throwing Velveeta on everything to please Joe and Mary Tourist, but if you have strong opinions about Mexican food, this could be a workhorse winner or something you rant about in the car all the way home.

Speaking of Joe and Mary Tourist, we visited Coconuts right before a movie at Rave across the way (which is exactly the perfect circumstance for a visit). Once in the cinema, we saw a commercial for Coconuts that may as well have been a government-run experiment in cognitive dissonance. That frat party up on the big screen? With the boobie innuendos that make Hooters seem like subtle classical allusions to the female form? Yeah, we didn't go to that place. In fact, that was the place I'd avoided for ages, based on some reviews here. 

The place we visited in the late afternoon (5:30ish) was full of ordinary-looking and acting couples and foursomes, perhaps mid-20's to mid-50s. Nobody was dressed to impress. Nobody was in some state of undress. Even the music was peaceful and gently tropical. (I think it was the soundtrack to 50 First Dates.) 

And although the claw machine ($2 to try to pluck up a lobster - win and they'll cook it) gave me moral pause, I had to admit that the overall atmosphere was pleasant and not as if they'd just hung up items from a Standard-Issue Beach-Themed Restaurant Kit. 

If Coconuts would ditch the Waitresses Gone Wild marketing angle, I could see this being a family place with wink to the adults with the fully stocked bar.  
(Family = older kids who don't need to be entertained by something other than dinner conversation to get through the meal without throwing things or screaming. The decor is fun, but this isn't the Rainforest Cafe.)

You'd never believe that Lolita's was in the same space... and I'm kind of glad. I quite liked the food at Lolita's, which was nothing at all like Coconuts, but Lolita's always felt like it was trying very hard to make sure its cultivated hipness was maintained at all times.

This may well be a tale of two restaurants: the attractive daytime scene and the desperate party at night. 

Most appetizers are half-price during the week between 4-6, so my husband went a little nuts ordering. As he describes in his review, the chips were very oily and heavy. (And they aren't free, as is the norm, but since we were getting a great price on our other appetizers, it worked out.) Salsa was nondescript. The guacamole was okay, but I'm not a huge guac fan unless it's kind of fancy, so I shouldn't be allowed to vote on that. 

What intrigued me about the cheese enchiladas I ordered is that they're filled with Oaxaca and queso fresco (not unusual but it's always reassuring when you're in a middle-road restaurant and it's not Jack, cheddar, etc.) *and* with Manchego, a less typical choice. Also, you can choose red or green sauce; I'm just a sucker for being able to have a tomatillo sauce with straight-up cheese enchiladas. (Too many restaurants seem to reserve the tomatillo sauce for more duded-up creations.)

Was the meal great? Nah, but it was all solid fare (chips aside) at the right price in a great location with a relaxed ambiance.

One thing I can see people complaining about might be the strength of the booze. I almost never drink (alcohol) - if I have a drink every year, I'd be surprised - but I was really in the mood for a creative milkshake. I decided to get the Almond Joy.

The choc-coconut concoction was tasty and hit all my chocoholic buttons, but I was only dimly, maybe, aware of an alcohol taste, and I didn't feel anything at all. I almost always get giggly and flushed after a few sips of booze, including foo-foo frozen drinks, but either that was the smoothest alcohol ever served, or it was piss-weak. Since I made my husband (who usually abhors even a tiny bit of alcohol taste) try some, and he a) thought it was good, and b) couldn't detect alcohol at all, I'm voting for ""piss-weak."" 

I didn't mind, since I was in it for the dessert experience and not the buzz, but if you're paying $10 for a boozy shake, you might feel ripped off.

I can easily see coming back for lunch or an early dinner when we want to grab a sit-down bite before a movie without paying heaps, dealing with a crowded bar scene, or dodging strangely limited menus. (I'm looking at you, English's. Britain is a fantastic country for vegetarians, so what's your excuse?) 

Would I take out-of-town friends here? Only if their culinary yardstick of Mexican food experience is more like a ruler. But as much as I was prepared to dislike Coconuts, they surprised me. Re-brand this as a tropical getaway for every crowd, and I think they could fill a niche at Town Square that has been sorely overlooked. Hmm.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,6,2,3,afElapvcueqOUsJcuLX9QQ
2309153,2012-03-20,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"After looking for a place for dinner my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try.  Before we entered I said this place looks empty. It was 7pm on a Monday night so we figured it might just be an off time. We decided to go in and we greeted and seated at a completely dark table, we asked to be moved to a table with more light. Just after another group was seated at the dark table and proceeded to use their phone flashlights to read the menus. After being disappointed that there are no free chips and salsa my girlfriend ordered tortilla soup, chicken taquitos, and I ordered the al pastor tacos.  I first tried the soup and thought it was disgusting, we both said that we make way better tortilla soup than this place. I grabbed a taquito and squeezed it and oil soaked out through the tortilla and onto the plate. Completely soaked in oil. Bland chicken inside. Although they were the best things we ordered I would never order them again. Shredded pork and a bland overly oil marinade. Nothing like traditional al pastor.  Margaritas were not ""the best in the world"" as advertised. Tasted like cheap tequila and sweet & sour with too much sweet.  Waitress was prompt at first but I think she was the only one in the restaurant and took her over 20 minutes after the food to check on us. We were done and waiting for a check for 10 of those minutes. The only reason I ate the food is because I was so hungry. After leaving I told my girlfriend I felt like I wanted to throw up that nasty food and go eat somewhere else.  Both of us left with our stomachs feeling like we were sick and she developed a head ache. The owners and managers were having a meeting at a table while we were there and had very negative vibes felt by us both without discussing it.  I noticed them checking out female customers and talking about them.  Very much the opposite of professionals. Oh yeah and one other thing they a song actually came on while we were there with the lyrics ""the Mexican food really sucks here"" I couldn't believe they would allow something like that to play there but it was very fitting. I think they were playing pandora or something because radio advertisements would come of every now and then. Also weird.

3091932,2012-07-28,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"I'm writing this review as I'm sitting here wondering why I even decided to try this place.  First off, I was greeted by a girl who seemed nice enough, though she was wearing a bikini top that pushed her boobs up to her eyeballs.  It's kinda a clue that your shorts are too tight when you're a skinny girl, yet you muffin-top over your cut-off shorts.   She ended up being our waitress. To be fair, she seems really nice, and is really trying to please us (maybe since I complained about the horrific iced tea).

ICED TEA: My husband and I ordered iced tea which is our usual drink at any restaurant. The tea that we received was so opaque, it could have passed for Sam Adams beer. Ironically, it was served on a beer glass. Any iced tea drinker will tell you that you should ALWAYS be able to see through you tea, otherwise it is over brewed and ridiculously bitter. I sent it back and requested water instead. She apologized and said that their iced tea brewer was broken, and they had brewed that tea through a coffee machine. REALLY?? Who does that?  Later she brought me a fresh tea (after I received my water), and asked me to sample it to see if it was good. This time, the tea was very pale and tasted weak. I told her it was better but probably needed to be brewed longer. She proceeded to tell me that they had just tried to add water to the tea in the back.  (oh great....)

DECOR: This place is definitely a college kid hang out. Two of the big screen tvs played a looped video of what was presumably parties at the restaurant. The top of our table had decal stickers of strippers pole dancing. Definitely not a kid friendly scene.  Luckily we didn't bring out kids that day. However, a family of 5 came in and were seated at the booth next to us. They had two young kids. Personally I wouldn't have felt comfortable bringing my kids in, but to each their own...

SERVICE: Like I said, the under-dressed greeter was our waitress. Seem seemed nice, from what little interaction we had. She and the only other waitress in the joint were busy flirting with the table of 6 college guys that were seated in the covered patio/outside area on the other side of the restaurant from us.

FOOD: The ceviche we ordered came on top of 3 tortilla chips that had gotten soggy from the juice. Not fun to eat, was very messy. I don't remember what my husband had, but I ordered the shrimp tacos. It was soggy, gross.  I picked the shrimp out of it and left the rest on the plate, completely dissatisfied

SUMMARY: I left the place still hungry and boiling mad about my whole experience. Not one time did were we approached by a manager after the whole ice tea debacle. It's not like the manager didn't know, since I had watched our waitress bring the ice tea over to her and speak to her about it. Poor service, poor management and poor quality of food. I wouldn't EVER come back, even if I was stone-drunk, which I guess is who they cater to.

3225885,2013-02-26,4,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"Can't say that I'm nuts for Coconuts Beach Bar & Mexican Grill. 

Although I visit Town Square quite often, this was my first time here. And this wasn't by choice, but because it was for a couple of my girlfriends' birthday. What's funny is that this bar wasn't their first choice either - they wanted to have their shindig at Miller's Ale House but couldn't because it was packed for the UFC fight. 

This place is super roomy. But as roomy as it is, there are not many places to sit down. It's probably because they hold a lot of college parties with bumpin' music and whatnot. Our party stuck close to the bar. The bar itself is pretty large in size, but there was only one guy running around serving drinks. Maybe there was another bartender but his presence was not known. 

I ordered the watermelon margarita for myself, the classic margarita and a pineapple malibu for the birthday girls. The three came out to $26. I thought this was way pricey for what we got. The pineapple malibu was served in a small plastic cup. The two margaritas were served in margarita glasses, but the rims weren't salted. I can't say anything about the classic margarita since I didn't get to taste it, but the watermelon margarita tasted pretty bland. It definitely had me scratching my head hoping for a swig of tequila on my next sip. The pink color was pretty and all, but it tasted like a single jolly rancher melted down in a full glass of water. 

There are advertisements all over town square for their ""4 foot burrito"". Sounds cool, but I hear it doesn't taste very good. From what I hear, you have to have 10 people in your party in order for them to serve it.

If you've seen this, you know there are two girls dressed in teeny bikinis holding coconuts enticing people to come for food and drinks. I was there on a Saturday night and there were no signs of girls in bikinis. Sorry to break it to all you boys but you might as well go to Blue Martini next door for hottie bartenders, if that's what you're looking for!",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,2,0,2,oqSINzil08r4mli5cXPOXg
3248196,2012-05-31,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"Absolutely not as bad as some of the reviews here suggest.

Despite always being keen for some other options at Town Square, wife and I were scared off by the negative Yelp vibe which has ranged between 2 and 2.5 star average and only recently has climbed to 3. I would say the three stars is just about right, bordering on 3.5.

We went during the happy hour which was uncrowded and the food was more than decent. Service was fine, too.

The only thing I would suggest is to get in line with the industry standard of free chips and salsa (keep the guac as an optional extra that you pay for) and possibly do something about the chips which I wasn't so keen on. They had a bit of an oily taste and seemed just the wrong side of being overcooked. Perhaps try a different oil or change it out more often -- I don't know. The salsa could be more interesting and I would love to see a bean dip.

Overall, though, the happy hour specials on appetizers was a great bargain. I enjoyed my wings and nachos for a decent price.

I'm not sure I would seek Coconuts out, but if I am at Town Square and fancy a bit of Mexican, I see no reason not to return. It's not remarkable, but not terrible, either -- get some better chips and salsa and they are a solid 4.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,2,1,3,sKzM3NiCzFcJVdZWOdG9HA

Walking into coconuts reminds me a of a tackier and cheesier version of Rainforest Cafe (and yes I said more tackier) The restaurant itself looks like a tropical run down beach shack. With fake palm trees, random flip flops on the wall, and a beach theme which Hollister Co. pulls infinitely better, Coconuts definitely deserves it's own page in book of 'How Not To Design A Restaurant.'

The food was average but priced decently for Town Square. My 3 tacos with a side of beans and rice came out to be around $9. It could have been worse. The food itself was not bad, but wasn't impressive either. 

The service on the other hand was great, which is probably why this place isn't a one star. The manager (possibly owner) brought out the food and was incredibly helpful. Though I do find it odd that pretty much everyone who works here is required to wear short-shorts and flip flops.

From my understanding the place turns into a College/Frat party area with cheap drinks, loud EDM and latin music on certain nights.

The girls working at the front barely looked old enough to be there, and were about as knowledgable about the happy hour policy of the restaurant as a german shephard I had seen walking outside earlier that day. I think they were paid to stand there and look cute because that's about all they were good for ( no offense girls, whoever you were)
I suppose if I were rating this place solely as a bar, then I wouldn't have to be so harsh. I had a happy hour priced Stone beer for about $4. Not bad I guess. And the interior looks kinda neat and tropical and what have you. I suppose you could double your fun by showing up in a hawaiin shirt.

Unfortunately, we did try alot of the food here and I certainly was not impressed. I suppose the most tolerable of the food we had was the beef tacos. Kinda tasty and bite  sized. I really did not care for the ceviche?? [Is that how its spelled?]. Well I have tasted it before and had much better. The chips were very mediocre and the guacamole--I have serious doubts about whether that was freshly made.

Service- We had a server who kept apologizing for the lack of service and making us wait so long.  He also never checked on our table after the food was served to see if we needed anything. We had to get the attention of a mgr to get refills on our drinks.  They tried to make up for it with a free desert and said it was because of a couple of large parties, but it looked more like lack of communication and mgmt didn't really care.

Food- burritos were actually pretty good and so was the desert.  That's the only reason for as many stars.

Cocktails- Drinks have too much ice for the price.  Moral of the story, drink beer not mojitos or margaritas, similar to Mexico.

First off, all the waitresses are dressed in bikinis and have body paint all over them and have huge boobs.  Hence the name ""Coconuts"" I guess.  The hostesses, of which there are about 30, dress in short jean shorts and ripped up T-shirts.  As one friend put it, ""What the hell are these people going to do in the winter?""  When the hostesses aren't all jammed by the door preening, they climb up on top of the booths and ""dance.""  At least I think that's what they were doing.  Seriously...it looked like the bad day shift at a strip club.

There was also a guy wearing a sombrero/lifeguard hat, with a pancho tied around his shoulders, and a painted on mustache.  He was walking around blowing a damn vuvuzela and asking who wants to do a beer bong.  I thought his get up was a bit racist, to be honest.  And, yeah, you read that correctly about the beer bong.  They bring in people out of the mall to do beer bong contests and shot contests.  And they also use water guns to shoot alcohol into your mouth.  Classy.

Drinks were pretty pricey and we ordered chips and guacamole for $7...the guac came in a teeny tiny bowl that barely was enough for 2 people to share.

But listen, if you like to look at boobs, enjoy beer bongs, shots, people shooting alcohol into your mouth with water guns, and basically bad college-like experiences, by all means come to Coconuts.

It took ten minutes for someone came over and take our drink order, then it took ten minutes to get the beers. Sadly, I was sitting close enough to the bar that I could see our drinks just waiting to be sent out. Then someone came and asked what would you like to drink, we explained we had already ordered and that they were sitting at the bar... then no one came back for ten more minutes.

After an hour waiting for our food, they brought it out. It looked great, but with in that one hour timeline, no one brought napkins or silverware. As an employee walked by I asked for the silverware and napkins.... nothing happened. Then I saw a manager walking around. We flagged her down and explained  the issue, she ran and got us the silverware and came back with one napkin...we had burgers and tacos. Mind you this was after our food had been on our table for almost five minutes.  She came back with a pile of napkins, then the guy I originally came back about fifteen minutes with them.   

Finally, the meal was over, the manager brought us our bill, which was all wrong. She felt pretty bad, gave us a few free rounds.

Before I begin I heard there was a birthday burrito that was worthy of a Man vs Food challenge but didn't get to see it.  HOWEVER, I did enjoy an appetizer and an open bar!

Located conveniently within Town Square I was surprised that not a lot of advertising was put out about the grand opening of this place.  Not that I've heard of any but my friends who considers Millers Ale House his second home told me about it.  And what a surprise that he wanted to try something new so I took him up on his offer and what do I see when I get there?  Coconuts!  Being from Hawaii, coconut bras are a necessity if anything were to succeed and it pays homage to the King of Hawaii (not really but the table-side prepared Avocado's were theee bombbbbb).  

Can't really recommend anything but on my next visit I'm trying the mahi mahi dish.

Shrimp tacos were good, wish I could have had them with corn tortillas.  But what I was really trying to do was find an entree that had coconuts in them.  I didn't find any!  But I did find tons of drinks!  I had a really chilled pina colada.  I got hammered on my friends drink, it was with pineapple I think but had blue in it (can't remember but it was similar to the Kryptonite shot/drink), and we had more coming.  We had more but it was definitely good times.  Grand opening was Friday but we were there on the Thurs before?  

Awesome atmosphere, great staff/service, good food, and great drinks.  Fits the overall theme of Town Square.  And they may have some of the best/crazy/cocoNUTS bartenders in town!

3. If you offer 2 kinds of rice,  put the one the guest ordered on the plate and don't give attitude when you make a mistake.

4. Cook the rice all the way.  the flavor was delicious, but the uncooked kernels in my teeth not so much.

5. Don't be stingy with the avocado in the ceviche,  that sliver is pointless.

6. Remove that funky taste in the albondiga soup.

7. Green Enchiladas are not supposed to be SPICY, and enchiladas are supposed to be smothered in cheese.

The 1 star that I awarded this place is for the music, best of bachata, reggaeton, salsa, and hip hop.  I can't lie the music had me going.  

Here is where the rest of the rating actually begins....

So we arrive at Coconuts to celebrate a friend's birthday.  She had already made reservations with Rafa for a booth and a bottle of Grey Goose for $200.  When we meet the hostess at the front and tell her that we reserved a booth and the bottle she proceeds to tell us that the booths have already been filled and that she is going to have to find us a table for 6 somewhere else in the place.  She finds us 3 small tables that she puts together and then we move on to the bottle service.  When we tell her that we had set up a bottle of Goose with Rafa for $200 she proceeds to tell us that they can only do a bottle of Smirnoff for $200 and that a bottle of Goose would be $400 more.  So what she is saying is that for a bottle of Goose we are going to have to pay $600!!! WTF?!  We only pay that amount if we are going to some place like Pure at Cesar's or XS at Encore!  You are a restaurant in Town Square south of the strip!

She then goes and talks to her ""Manager"" and she comes back and says that she can do a bottle of Goose for $300.  What a coincidence.....I hate to imagine the suckers that actually pay $600 for a bottle of Goose at this place.  

So we get our bottle and start enjoying tasty Goose and Soda, Goose and pineapple, and Goose and cranberry.  We get half way through our bottle and the hostess comes by and asks if we want to buy a 2nd one.  We say that we are good and for the next hour or so the hostess is hovering around our table watching us to make sure that we are continuing to drink.   Then the best thing happens....some door man looking guy comes up to us and says I see that you have 3 tables set up here, I am going to have to take 1 of them.  I'm like, ""Excuse me?!""  

His response, ""I have 4 guys out front that want to buy 2 bottles and I am going to have to take the table.  

I was like, ""First of all our original table was given to someone else after we had made a reservation, 2nd we reserved and purchased a bottle of Goose for $200 and your hostess tried to make us pay triple the amount and made us pay an extra $100 for it, and 3rd of all I don't care if I bought 1 bottle or 10 if I make a reservation for table service it's reserved for the entire night for me.  

I asked to speak to Rafa and the bouncer-looking guy said very lowly, ""I am the assistant manager so I am the one who makes the call....""

I ask him for his card and he blows me off.  Some assistant manager this is aaand they pack this club like a can of sardines and the bathroom has about a 30 minute wait.

I have been to many clubs throughout the US and Mexico....I get bottle service regularly at these clubs and they know how to treat their guests.  I have never had a table taken away because the VIP host thinks he can make more money.  Bottom line the service and management of this place is a joke.  If you want to be treated like a real VIP and experience real bottle service I suggest you walk across the walk way and contact Jared at the Blue Martini!  They know how to treat their patrons.

I ordered a salad and a soup. Both were good, although there wasnt much meat in my soup. Together they were 11.00, which isnt bad. 

This place caters to the 20-something college guy. Who in their right mind creates a place like this in a high-rent area?? The hostesses were 4's at best and were basically nude.

They told us there would be a 10 min wait!!! Confusing. I wanted to try this place. But not gonna wait when it's not busy. Had to leave. Found I love burgers 100 ft away;) so far so good.,nEQQHyIygQqCV4MHHjR5zw,0,0,2,o1HoyL0NGmJgeJR1byPoTw
4983940,2012-09-01,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,This place serves mediocre food at best at an expensive price.  Refried beans are watery looks like they basically too a can of pinto beans and poured them on the plate. Chips and salsa costs an additional $5 even with a meal.  Not sure how they are managing to stay open.  Waitresses look like they came from Hooters.  There are better places for Mexican and lots of better places to eat and drink at Town Square!

We were served with a dirty plate, the food was horrible.  We ordered chips and salsa, which was good.  The steak Quesadilla, Ceviche and taquitos were terrible. The margaritas were very weak.  
I had a coupon so that is why we decided to try this place.  When the bill came they would not accept it for Happy Hour.  It does not say anything on the coupon about not using for Happy Hour.  The bill also had many mistakes, over charging on several items.  
We will not be going back here, even though I still have my $25.00 off coupon.  It is not worth being served horrible food.",uKok4cU7wguD6H05VSQnPw,3,0,1,wifVkhcaVPrG4VpPnh45sA

Awful restaurant! This place USED TO BE AWESOME when it was Lolita's. The new-age Mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience. Since this place became Coconuts the food has turned to crap. Everything we tried was overcooked, under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce.  Tables were sticky and dirty, not tablecloths, and poor service given.  

Do yourself a favor and do not come to eat here. It's a waste of time and money.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,1,0,3,mpt5smPQvvTSCjZGxVgvZw

I was in for Happy Hour, the place was pretty dead, but it was a Monday. I had to try one of their specialty cocktails. We had a Coconut Mojito and a Purple Bikini Martini, a little pricey (9-10$ each) but we had coupons which made it easier to swallow. They were okay drinks, nothing special. We opted to go cheaper and just got beer and well drinks (BOGO) afterward. The service was okay. Nothing to complain or rave about. I hate that they don't serve complimentary chips and salsa but I knew that before going. The food we saw looked okay but we had eaten already so skipped food.
 I really have no need to go again, so I probably won't.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,1,1,3,hBXvN14L-lyf7pmDNfnX7g
5393238,2012-05-15,2,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"YIKES. I should have read the Yelp reviews before coming here.

So, a group of four of us stopped by for lunch, braving the manic weekend crowds. We are all from the bar/restaurant industry and we arent crazy picky, but COME ON! This place is ridiculous. Ridiculously bad.

We should have known what was coming when the hostess was totally weird about us wanting to sit at a certain table. With four open outdoor tables we really did not want to sit at the one right next to a crying baby. Is that a strange request? Hint two was the fact that our drinks took FOREVER to come out and came out at all different times. I am pretty sure the bartender was confused or a newbie because we had some of the worst drinks I have ever tasted. For a place that specializes in mojitos to serve you a glass of ice and soda water without alcohol and simple syrup in it is just bad. This was the theme for all of our drinks and it didnt get any better on the second or third try after we sent it back. I dont think I have ever sent a drink back, ever, but this was BAD.

If the food was great then the drinks could have been forgiven... but it wasnt. It was just blah. Warmed up and plopped on a plate. It was just... food. Add to that the disappearing server trick and it was just too much. We left wishing we had those two hours of our lives back to spend at a decent restaurant.",A_dC3FJOqvlsDEiDyMrzlA,5,0,1,O5-owFrwEg42Xu4bgUUpsA
5437574,2013-02-11,2,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"Where can I start with this place? I don't even know where to begin...

First of all, it took us a while to get seated for lunch, and the restaurant was not full by any means.Where was the host to greet us when we walked in? I don't know, but after we stood at the front for a while, we finally got someone to seat us.

It took a while for our server to come over. Not sure if we were forgotten, but we sat there staring, again waiting to get someone's attention. We finally had someone come over, and we placed our drink order. When our drinks were brought back, I asked for a suggestion on what to get for lunch since it was my first time dining there. The answer was ""everythings good."" Seriously? Wow.

I settled on the bean and cheese burrito, which at any other mexican establishment I would have loved. This burrito was bland, no flavor, and the refried beans were hard and pasty, kind of like they had been sitting there for a while. The cheese was not even melted and it was lukewarm. Eww. When I told the server she didn't really have a reaction, no I'm sorry, nothing. No manager ever came to the table, but I'm not surprised since I've heard this place was run poorly, and it shows.

Food was disgusting, drinks over priced for the amount of alcohol they claim to put in them. Staff was unattentive and not friendly at all. They seemed to all hate their jobs, and man does it show. 

I don't care how much they may advertise on facebook or around town, this place is poorly run, and no one seems to care. Skip this place, go right across to Blue Martini. They take better care of you, and have much better attitudes.",Gek8x-Gt3NS8tfWMYjURSA,3,2,1,bu7I-K0ZijHk53l7NUK5QQ

We had to send back the Chile Rellenos as ithey were cold in the middle.  Also, had to send back ice tea that looked and tasted quite weak.  The server did not seem to know how to brew stronger ice tea...really.  The best thing I can say is that our beverages were refilled three times before our food came.  Overall, food and service not good enough for lunch.  It might be best for them to not open for lunch and or just be a bar that opens 4pm till?  It sadly reminds me my past experiences at Cadillac Ranch in Town Square.",cAY_gYiIq68RkWhLennaKw,2,1,1,5XrxVmcwYSDh7Y7RT17OHg
5629679,2012-07-19,0,e1_gISPV4RpFRjdNHmuodg,"To be clear, I planned on writing a review for Coconuts Beach Bar & Mexican Grill BEFORE I saw an ad on their website offering diners a free dessert for writing a Yelp review about their restaurant! :P

I went to Coconuts for the first time with my boyfriend on a weeknight. The setting is full of bright colors and beach décor, the quintessential ""Spring Break"" setting. There is a lot of space, and I imagine it would be a fun place to be on a busy night. Unfortunately, when we visited, we were one of 3 or 4 tables. Though we missed out on some excitement, the fact that it wasn't too busy prevented us from getting ""lost at sea,"" which sometimes happens when there are too many customers/not enough employees.

Right away, I have to compliment the staff on their swift and attentive service. It was a slow night, but there was a full staff, and we never had to wait for ANYTHING. BAM! We were seated. BAM! We received water at our table. BAM! [FREE] Chips and salsa appeared out of nowhere. BAM! Our drinks were ready! BAM! Our dinner was there. On top of that, the servers and staff all seemed attentive and polite. Oh, ya, and did I mention that EVERYONE who works there is gorgeous?! 

I did have a few comments about the food and drinks. We made it to happy hour, and ordered some $5 house margaritas. I must tell you, their drinks are STRONG! Online, they make a sexy innuendo to their ""stiff"" drinks, and let me tell you--- it is not just a cute catchphrase. I couldn't finish my drink (and trust me, I love me some margaritas)! You've been warned! (P.S. I noticed a lot of reviewers complained about WEAK drinks! We must have had completely different bartenders!)

Another thing: their chips tasted weird to me. I might be crazy, but I detected a faint ranch flavoring to them. I'm not sure if this was from the seasoning salt, the tortillas the chips are made from, or maybe my taste buds were just shot from my margarita--- but I wasn't a fan. I confess, as a non-pinto-lover, I didn't try the beans that came as a side. Also, the Spanish rice sprinkled with peas was a bit bland to me, and tasted like it was microwaved. However, I was overall quite impressed with the entrees. I will say that I really enjoyed my cheese enchiladas, topped with red sauce and served (upon my request) with a $2 side of seasonal grilled vegetables. The veggies were sautéed to perfection and made what might have been ordinarily plain enchiladas totally scrumptious. My boyfriend liked his steak fajitas, which were loaded with onion and garlic and other seasonings. 

Overall, I'd say check out Coconuts. Fun environment. Good service. Fine food. And one drink will get your drunk!",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,0,1,2,YWMu3Ufd2sEkfkqBa8gaDA
