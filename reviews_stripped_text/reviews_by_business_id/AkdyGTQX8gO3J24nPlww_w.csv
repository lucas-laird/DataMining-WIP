I took my wife for her birthday expecting a classy place with good food and got a gentle men's club with cold, nasty food. We left with Togo boxes 2 hours after we arrived. The only reason this has 1 star is because the manager TIM gave us a lift back to our hotel.  PLUS THEY DID NOT HONOR THE YELP 50% OFF. plus we paid a 70$ cover just to enter this establishment.",5F9YQ4DkMGpPIQe8oWyKhw,4,0,1,9Jn-fulNXlzvD98GXJbFBg

Temperature Delivery. Cici the waitress was so in tuned. She was the best waitress I ever ever experienced. We were having a business meeting and she flawlessly moved around important conversation with seamless n productive interaction.. Everyone should eat at this steak house.

1825228,2018-03-28,0,AkdyGTQX8gO3J24nPlww_w,"Hmmm. Where does one start. A steakhouse attached to a strip club. After hearing about this place for ages, my friend was finally able to prove t me that the food  was actually pretty good. 

The steakhouse is a tiny little room. One does not see the dancers unless they are working the tables around you. Since their were three women at the table our table was not approached. 

Now to the important stuff. Cecilia was our
Server and she made the experience amazing. The food was amazing from the bread to the chocolate cake at the end. At our table we had steak, lamb and chicken. No one left the table hungry. The sides are huge and served family style. 

The doorman saw the books in my
Sister in law's bag and they had a nice discussion. Cecilia knew the others at our table so we were able to talk about families and how everyone has been. It was just an all around good experience.",QqN6LAqPp9mgfOVBhHnltw,0,0,5,FTB7xUiPzI39v65QwbKtWQ

Great steaks and sides await those who are willing to give this place a chance. Everything we had was phenomenal would recommend the ribeye and creamed spinach. 

Note there was no cover charge for the steakhouse and a great locals discount on the food and drinks.",dHfv58WGplbOyJtnvmRnOg,0,0,5,1ibVo0Bs_0E4DZt0OQvQbw

5847963,2014-10-07,0,AkdyGTQX8gO3J24nPlww_w,I love the design and Devore. Very comfortable.  Prices are comparable to Golden Steer but I think chef Patrick edges them out . I had the chicken Francese and it was the best breast I've had in town. The Steakhouse is separate from the club so you can relax. The bar has a big screen so I had a private showing for MNF. Great hideout if you find the right roads,AStHl7m__BTiheHzpXvmRQ,1,0,5,9DGPtjXVg6G5MPkKQzoZcw
