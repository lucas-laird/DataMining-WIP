Not only was she rude and very short with us, but she also was inconsiderate of the fact that we didn't like the food. When the food came out all of it was gross. We could have gotten better pizza and wings elsewhere (and for cheaper). We also ordered and appetizer, which was by far the most disgusting thing i've had. The taste was so irony.

We had the Big Apple pizza and while the crust was thick yet light and delicious there was just a bit too much sauce.  Service was great especially on a Saturday night.  We were lucky as we sat in the bar but there was a 45 minute wait in the restaurant.  It's a casual vibe with lots of families but also a little noisy.

The food was good not great and the prices seem a bit high for how lax they are about customer service and food.  We ordered 2 pizzas and a salad.  We were told the salad would come out first. This restaurant has an open kitchen so you can see when orders are up.  We sat there and watched our salad sit there waiting for someone to serve it to us for 5 minutes.  Not so bad except for the fact that our waitress was sitting down eating in plain view of us while we waited for our food.  This happened all throughout our service.

So I've been driving by this place for a few weeks as I'm always popping in to the pet store next door for my pups.  I had the chance to check Dom DeMarcos out for an early dinner recently and will surely be spending lots of time there!

We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who greeted us and walked us in.  Great first impression!

My girlfriend and I sat at the bar.  While I am not drinking alcohol, I am very comfortable in a bar scene and this bar environment was very comfortable.  Ample seating (don't get me wrong, the actual restaurant area was nice as well, but I'm a former barfly so we opted for the bar) and a nice bar layout with a few tv screens and sports.  I can't comment on cocktails/wine but my friend seemed happy with her beverages.  My soda water was impeccable.  

We asked the bartender for recommendations on food and he did not steer us wrong.  He suggested the meatballs, eggplant pizzettes or any of the pizzas.  We decided on the eggplant pizzettes which were amazing!!!  They are breaded eggplant with a dollop of whipped ricotta on top and delicious red sauce.  Sean, the bartender, made sure to order us more sauce as we clearly enjoyed it.  

We followed that with the 15th Street BLT Salad.  Very tasty.  Think of a BLT without the bread and made into a salad.  Deeeeelicious!  

Lastly was the pizza.  We were in the mood for some meat so we ordered the Big Apple with sausage, pepperoni, ham and meatballs.  We ordered a small and could only eat a piece each...yahoo for leftovers!!!  Luckily, the bartender warned us ahead of time that a small would be ""plenty"" for two ladies of our stature.  What a charming flatterer!  

During small talk with another bartender, we learned that another one of the hostesses had been awarded most attractive restaurant hostess of Las Vegas or Summerlin (I don't recall which she said.)  I have a feeling it wasn't based solely on looks...not to suggest that the staff there isn't very good looking, but everybody seemed to be very genuine, kind hearted people, so I think the combo of being good looking AND kind hearted had something to do with it.  Good for her!    

Dom de Marco's has a very pleasant, casual vibe with a wonderful staff.  From the greeter to the awesome bartender Sean, and the rockin' New York style grub, I will certainly be back.  

PS...if I ever hit the booze again, I'll have Sean make the drink and I'll review his pouring techniques!",PYJYzbhtvjG5OWEqHBmc9A,2,0,4,t-DO30LarlwChn9lguAwnw

It was plain, but elegant. We ordered pizza for our dinner with half pepperoni and half sausage. It is their own and made fresh daily as is the pizza sauce and dough.

Mind you I was there when it was completely empty it was not during a rush it was less than half full and my server was nice but slow. She even noticed she was slow as she kept apologizing for the wait over and over. Instead of apologizing just speed it up.

208518,2015-08-10,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Never had a bad experience here. This last time was my fourth time in the restaurant, and it confirmed, for me, that this is one of the best pizza restaurants in Las Vegas.

In my combined experiences with Dom DeMarco's, a few things have caught my attention. First, the restaurants has been busy each time I've been in, even in the early afternoon. This is a good sign, however don't plan an interview at this place. It can get loud-ish. Next, the service is either amazing, pretty good, or decent, depending on who you get. My first experience was extremely memorable, and the server was there with a great attitude, perfect recommendations, and answers to all of my questions. She even brought out the chef to address a concern I had due to my dietary restrictions. That was over-the-top impressive, especially for a ""pizza place."" But since then, I've realized that this restaurant places importance on both product and service.

The pizza is perfect. My favorite meal here is the spicy Arrabiata pizza and a Caesar salad with added chicken breast. That one's a winner. The Eggplant Pizzettes are pretty fun as an appetizer. The Pesto pizza and the Broccoli Rabe are both good options as well. I decided to try the cheese ravioli once. It was okay,, like a C-, and actually kind of dry. Nothing special. I think its probably best to order pizza at a pizza place.

I love that there is both indoor and outdoor seating, with a bar and TV's. It's laidback, upscale-casual, much like most of Summerlin. And its pizza.

209881,2012-02-23,2,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Poor Customer Service!! 
First time there I asked if the sauce was smooth and it was. The small pizza was great, very tasty. Second time on a large pizza, sauce was chunky, and my reviews show, I hate chunky pizza sauce! (I know I'm fussy, but that's the way it is) Last Monday 2/20 we went again for a large pizza. I asked the server if they could put smooth sauce on our pizza, like straining it or removing the chunks. She checked with the kitchen and told me ""That's the way the sauce is"" meaning take it or leave it. To me, it wouldn't have been a big thing to take a minute to remove the tomato chunks before baking my pizza to keep a customer coming back. So, since they didn't take care of my needs, I will never go back there and I'm using Yelp to vent my displeasure with this place. To the owner: Take care of the customers, or they won't come back.
NOTE 3/4/2012-Lori from DeMarco's contacted me offering to ""be our guest so we can make you happy"". A nice gesture, but I don't care now. I don't want a free pizza. We'll spend our yearly $1500-$2000 on pizza someplace else.",-vxTGquw8aZ54Xu_BkGH_w,5,2,1,TpYtZQuCZ1aRXQG4ASnnUw

But, after more than 20 minutes, we were informed that they were still waiting on a small group to finish so that they could seat us in the bar area. Funny, but we didn't reserve a table in the bar area for a birthday dinner. The staff could care less and, to add insult to injury, they sat another large group that arrived after us in the dining room.

266952,2012-11-06,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"To be fair, I went 2 times.  With that said.  This place is awful in a lot of ways.  I'll start with the good.  The location, the decor, the clean restroom, the patio.  Now the bad.  Not a pizza joint, not for kids.  No crayons, no kids cups or utensils, no kids menu.  Fine but they advertise great for families.  Now the food.  Plain and simple, yuk.  Both times my food was bad in different ways.  The anti pasta salad is a platter, not a salad.  With very little on it.  The most recent time the cheese was stale (the waitress who served it even noticed-then why did she serve it hmm?) the bread was hard-the rest was just average.  The pasta-the ziti has a lot of weird spices-I just wanted a great tasing comfort meal-this wasn't it.  The pizza-average at best,  I asked for little sauce (for my 4 year old) and got sauce pouring over the top edge.  Of course they offered to remake it-but they are so slow, it wasn't worth another 30 minutes to wait.  The garlic bread-lots of stuff, dry romano, etc but not much garlic-it's premixed they told me so they couldn't do better.  They add a lot of spices and dry cheese and toppings to everything-I guess to cover up the average cooking-yuk!  The serivce, nice but slow and not so smart.  I watched the waitress take lids off of drinks and smell them-she still gave my son the wrong drink-huh?  The bar is cute, I'm sure they can't mess up wine or beer.

353826,2015-07-30,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"My husband and I are new to Las Vegas.  We were looking for a new restaurant to try and came across this spot while we were shopping next door.  I looked over a few of the yelp reviews and was very excited to give it a try.  Now i feel terrible.  My husband wanted to try a little Mexican restaurant down the street, but I convinced him to go here.

Our dinner was ruined from the start.  We came in on a Thursday a couple of weeks ago.  I didn't think it would be too busy.  I figured I was right when i saw that the restaurant was pretty empty.  We still had to wait about ten minutes to be seated.  My daughter works as a server and has told me before that ""just because a restaurant looks slow/empty, that doesn't mean that all of the empty tables are available.""  I was okay with the short wait.  We were seated right next to another table.  I was a little confused by this point.  There were several tables available that wouldn't have put us so close to other diners.  The space between us was so close, I really felt like we were dining together.  I asked if we could be moved (just one table over), and the hostess/server was so rude.  She said that it was the only table available and we should just sit down unless we wanted to wait longer.  My husband wanted to leave at that point.  We almost got into a fight about it because I really wanted to give it a try.  The food cooking smelled delicious!!  

The menu looked great!  There were several options that really reminded me of home.  We ordered an antipasto salad and an order of meatballs for an appetizer.  We wanted to wait to order our pizza later, but our server assured us that our meal would be coursed properly, and we could order everything all at once.  I kind of felt pressured into ordering everything.  Our server was quite pushy, and made me feel like we were inconveniencing her by us even being there, so we went ahead and ordered a white truffle pizza for our dinner.  I don't know if she was about to get off for the day, but the whole experience seemed very rushed.  When we told her that we were wanting to take our time with dinner, she gave us a defeated look.  

The appetizers seemed like they were taking long.  When I saw our server walk by, we asked if everything was coming along okay.  She just snapped, ""It's coming.""  Okay, I guess I'll wait.  I am used to someone stopping by the table to let me know if my food takes a little long.  It was fine, I was just so hungry because of all of the yummy smells.

Our salad and meatballs came out together, which was very nice.  They were both delicious!!  However, I feel like the prices are on the high side for what comes on the plate.  I don't ever complain about the prices, I knew what I was paying when I ordered. I guess I just expected the dishes to be worth their price.  

The pizza was brought to our table literally MINUTES after we got our apps.  We were only able to serve our plates, and take just a couple of bites before a food runner carried over our pizza.  We looked at him with a confused look, he saw our table full of food, and took our pizza back without a word!!  When we told our server that it was okay, she brought it back to the table.  This is why we wanted to order it separately.  We don't mind waiting for food, we just don't like feeling rushed.  

The pizza was delicious!!  So yummy!!  

We decided against desert or after dinner drinks.  We just wanted to finish up and leave.  I will definitely come back for that pizza!  I might even try a different appetizer or salad because there were other things I wanted to try, BUT I will not come back in to dine.  We were so unhappy with the service from the time we walked in until the time we left.  We still tipped our normal 20%, but the attitude and atmosphere nearly ruined our meal.

Our last visit, the waitress did not explain the difference between ordering a small pizza vs a half pizza, and when the deep dish came out and I was disappointed (I don't like deep dish at all) she acted as though it was an inconvenience and half heartedly offered to replace the pizza after making me feel dumb for not knowing the difference (her tone of voice and general attitude was pretty crappy).

449776,2011-12-06,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"This is an update of my first review - I've been back to DeMarco's 6 times in December, and I am formulating some firmer opinions. Obviously, since I have gone that often, I like it. With some experimentation, I Really like it. It is certainly the best option in LV for NY style. 

First - the crust is very good, but is Much better when you order a small rather than a large, and when you eat in. In particular, the bottom of the crust is a bit dense when you get it to go (obviously - pizza has a short life span), but it is also a little hard when I ordered a large to eat in - I think that this is because it is cooked longer. So I ordered a small, and the crust is near perfect on a small - great charring and very airy. Good Bread. I also like the olive oil the crusts are basted in - DM's puts a Lot of olive oil on top, and it spreads to the crust, and I like that. 

Second - The cheese - I like the mix - I have never had one as tangy, and I prefer this to the fresh mozz on Neapolitan style. But there is a bit too much of it. I've added two pictures where I think that you can see it is a bit soupy on a large. This is also better on a small - I also asked for light cheese the last two times I was there and it was very good. 

The minimalist sauce is very good, and the toppings are excellent - I mentioned that I liked the pepperoni, because it was thick enough to stand up under crisping. The sausage pie is also very good - it was very spicy with rough chunks. I like the basil - I asked if I could get the basil on it before it was cooked, which I prefer - but I was told that that wasn't okay, which I understand - that is ideological, and definitely their call. 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Good, but not great. 

Have anticipated the opening for a while. It is definitely  a transplant rather than the original - it tasted like a mass produced copy of great pizza, which still puts it Way ahead of pizza in Las Vegas, but will disappoint New Yorkers. 

Very good sauce and toppings - the sauce is very simple tomatoes and herbs, rather than a cooked sauce, so it tasted very fresh and tangy, rather than too sweet. The pepperoni was very good - thick enough and crispy to give a snap when biting into it. 

The crust is tasty, but the texture was not perfect. This is my fault - I got it Carry Out, and had to drive for 15 minutes, so it tasted more floury and a bit dense as it cooled off. I intend to try it again in the restaurant.

I also thought that there was too much cheese. 

Weird note - the boxes were a pain - they did not stay folded into a box, and the end kept coming open, and I almost lost the whole cheese pie as it almost slid out the end - I don't know if the boxes were cheap or just bad, but it was a pain.",b-MACejPd5CwZXb-ichN7g,1,0,5,JK6krb4DEZQOsVp5KcFuSQ
453074,2014-09-11,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Today at Dom Demarcos, Las Vegas, NV was the WORST experience I've had at a restaurant in my ENTIRE LIFE!  It happened on 9/10/2014 at 6:30pm.

Went in for happy hour with a good friend.  We had three beers each and a pizza.  All was good.

I mentioned to the waiter that I had a valupak.com (20% off the total bill) coupon at the start of the meal and he said, ""fine I'll take it at the end.""  Note -  Dom Demarcos puts these coupons out every month and they will not honor them.  Read more.

We finished our meal and I gave the waiter the 20% off coupon.  He comes back and says the manager won't honor this.  I asked why.  He said he'll be out to tell you.  I told the waiter before we ordered anything that we had a coupon.  If this was true, why wasn't I told before we ordered.  Part of the scam...

This guy comes out and stands over me with his arms folded (trying to intimidate me and my friend), and tells me he's the manager of the whole place and says, ""What's the problem?""

I told him I had a 20% off coupon from valupak.com and was using it.

He tells me its not valid during happy hour.  You get happy hour on the drinks or the coupon, you can't get both.

I told him, ""There isn't a happy hour restriction on the coupon.  It says plain and clear - 20% off your total bill, Monday through Friday.""  Note - If they don't honor this, technically its fraud.  You can't give out coupons, have the waiter say he'll take it at the end, and then say you won't honor them after I ate my meal!

He says, ""Yes, but its restricted to certain days.""

I said, ""RIGHT, Monday through Friday!  Today's WEDNESDAY!!""

Then the manager says, ""why are you yelling at me!  Now you're going to yell at me?""

I told him, ""I'm not yelling at you.  You're going to fight with me in the middle of the restaurant over a $10 off coupon???  I come here twice  a month and bring people from out of town here every other month!  This is stupid!""

Then the manager says, ""Ok, you're yelling at me and calling me stupid.""  Getting off the subject of him cheating me out of my coupon.

No, I said, ""THIS is stupid."" 

Note- This next comment is SHOCKING!!!!!

This manager then says, ""Have you ever come in here on the weekends?  We're packed!  We don't need you!!! Get out of here!!  You, your family and friends are all banned for life!!!  Never come back in here, we don't need you!""

WHAT!!!!! LOL!!!

I KNOW!  This is sooooo ridiculous that most of the people reading this will not believe it!  I still don't believe it and it just happened to me!!!

Then the manager throws me and my buddy out of the place, following us out to the door!  We didn't get the 20% off, we got 100% off.  He didn't even want the money for our meals! 

OK.  PLEASE TELL ME.  What manager throws two people out and bans all of their family and friends for life over $10????  $10!!!  And starts an argument and fight in the middle of a restaurant over a $10 coupon they are supposed to honor anyway?!?!  Then gives you $50 worth of food for free.  Ha!  This is how Dom Demarcos runs a business?? This is how they treat people??  If they're making SO MUCH money on the weekends (as the manager says) why don't they honor their coupons??

And as a manager, you'd rather give someone $50 in free food than $10 off and collect $40 from them?  Does this make any sense at all?  I honestly think this guy might either be on drugs or something!  WHO WOULD DO THIS???  If I owned this place and someone gave me a FAKE coupon, I would take it and at least get the $40!  HA!

I've run several business and have seen many other businesses fail because of people like this guy.  Every week they tell several families to never come back over nothing, and eventually 2-3 years down the road there's no one left and they close their doors!!  Believe me, me and my friend are NOT the first people this guy has thrown out and banned. 

Read the reviews online for this place.  Food is great, service is terrible.  I would have to say service here is BEYOND TERRIBLE!!!  It's starts with this manager who runs the entire business and trickles down.

If you bring in a coupon or have a problem with anything, good luck with the manager.  He'll make you and your family feel like a fool and throw you out into the parking lot!!!  He'll fight you in the middle of the restaurant over $10 and embarrass your entire table!

462178,2012-08-16,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I've eaten at Dom DeMarco's with friends and family on multiple occasions since they opened in Summerlin in early 2012.  The Summerlin restaurant is divided almost in half between a large bar area with bistro style seating on the right and more traditional table seating on the left.  The bar side opens up to a large outdoor patio and fire pit.  The left side has an open style kitchen in the back where you can see the chiefs throwing the pizza dough in the air as they work the dough.  

The restaurant does more than pizza and the menu, although not that large, offers a good variety of appetizers, salads and pasta dishes.  One of my favorite appetizers is the bruschetta trio ($9).  It comes with three pieces of garlic bread with one holding white beans, one with prosciutto and one with tomatoes, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They go well with a glass of wine from their reasonably large wine list.  Other notables are the fried calamari ($10) and the antipasto plate containing, among other goodies, nice sharp pieces of parmesan reggiano cheese ($12). They even have an appetizer of just meatballs, however, while the quality is good, it is way overpriced for what you get ($11). The salads are huge, which seems to be a trend in restaurants these days.  If you get one, plan on sharing it or taking the rest home.  

For dinner, don't miss the pizza which comes in a thin (small $12) or thick crust (small $15).  You can start with plain cheese and add your own toppings or order from several suggested formulations.  If you go this later route, I recommend the white truffle pizza (small $15 and large $27).  This beauty comes with mushrooms, mozzarella, parmesan, lots of garlic and truffle oil.  It is delicious. Aside from the pizza, I'm also a fan of the prime rib sandwich ($14). They tell you that they only make a limited supply of prime rib daily and when it runs out, the sandwich is no longer available that day however, I've never had them tell me there wasn't any left. They serve it cold with a side of garlic fries and a horseradish aioli.  The meat melts in your mouth.  It would be perfect if they served it hot but that's why this sandwich also works well as a takeout item where you can heat it up at home.  

The desserts are the most disappointing menu items.  The tiramisu is small for the price and the cannoli taste like they are straight out of the freezer aisle of the nearest Costco.  Until they start to put the same attention into their desserts as they do with their food, I recommend you stick with a cup of coffee and have the dessert at home.

The atmosphere is lively and it can get crowded.  Even during the week, going there around 7:00 pm will require a wait for a table so plan ahead.  I give the restaurant four stars as they do a great job of bringing good quality Italian food to Summerlin.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,0,0,4,CA_0yXTGsBvTD4rr3BNHDg

650920,2015-02-15,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"We got there around 3pm on valentines Day. We were seated immediately. The server came by 3 times saying he would be right back. On the third time he gave us 3 waters and I ordered an antipasto as he kept moving. At this time there were about 5 tables and 3 other servers on the floor. The hype about this place is that the owner was one of the partners from Difaro's in Brooklyn. That's what got me there. We ordered antipasto, Zuppa di Clams Bianco, Cavatellis with sausage and broccoli rabe, the Difaro special, the NY Style thin crust (In NY we just say round or Neopolitan) and a bianco thin crust . Antipasto was ok and then came the clams that we ordered and  broccoli rabe which we did not order, but the server said we did. I reminded him that when he repeated our order it was not on it and he did not seem happy about taking it back. Then all the pizza's and the pasta came at once. Though they cleared the antipasto plate they left the clam bowls(one for shell the other for the clams). They just put everything on the table and left. I got up and served my Wife and Son and as I was giving myself some pizza the server came by and said he would serve. I told him I got it. The only items that were ok were the clams and antipasto. 
The pasta had very little taste. The pizza's were not as advertised there was not any on the black charring as described on the menu. The prices are very high and I would not mind if the quality of the food was on par with the prices and the hype. Do not be fooled this pizza is not like Difaro's in Brooklyn.Having been born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. I can honestly say that this pizza is a best a regular neighborhood place with high prices. The dough is absolutely wrong and does not have any of the NY taste.

702817,2012-02-07,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I gave this place two visits before writing this review.  After the news of Obama being in town and ordering from here, I was curious and had to try it out.

We are big fans of Northside Nathan's and Metro Pizza, so we felt it was going to take a lot to impress us.

On the first visit, a couple of coworkers and I trekked down during lunch on a Friday.   Definitely a little more of a uppity scene than we usually go to for lunch (it's not really ""uppity"" but when in Summerlin, its just the way everyone pretends to be.)

We were seated quickly, we got the typical waiter-in-a-rush treatment.  We got the Sicilian Style for lunch and it took a bit to get to the table, but it arrived and it was good.  I would place it somewhere between Good to Really Good, but not great.   A little too ""saucy"" and not as cheesy as I'd like, but nonetheless I left satisfied.

So on Saturday, I decided to take the family down for lunch.  My older two boys being typical teenagers never turn down pizza, so how could we go wrong?

Despite a fairly slow crowd, it took forever to get us seated.  We kept being told by the hostess that despite the fact that we see some tables we could get our party of six to by combining smaller side-by-side tables, they were about to be having a shift change and needed to wait and see for some reason.  So we waited...and waited.  I didn't mind.  But everyone was getting grumpy and hungry.

Eventually we were seated at table meant for a party of four.  When our two pizzas arrived, there was barely room on the table.  We decided to also try one of the thing crust cheese pizzas which was MUCH better than the Sicilian style.  Overall, the family was unimpressed and understandably so.  On this day, the Sicilian seemed overloaded with even more sauce and even my least-picky child wanted none of it.

My first visit was a four star.  My second visit was a two star.  So I'll meet in the middle with three.",Q3dYbn4k65ZCWCMVxw_iZw,1,0,3,jy2KfnAY3i1WiDL0y6suIA
710937,2013-05-18,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Food: The best way to put it is I wanted it to taste much better. I have been disappointed 4 times in the last year. It is not bad by any means, it is a solid average. Nothing special by any means. It certainly has the hype of a great pizza joint and the interior is definitely a 4 star plus (thumbs way up for the designer, architect and contractor), however the food is mediocre. 

Service: Poor for 3 of the 4 trips and extremely bad and lied to for 1 of the 4 trips.

They are good at greeting you, but that is about it. On my last visit there was a 30 minute wait, which we understand, however what irked me was the girl at the front flat out lied. It was a bit chilly and we asked for the outdoor heaters to be turned on since we had a large party with many small children. The hostess said ok, but looked like she really did not want to (it was almost like she was swamped and did not want to be bothered with another task). I looked her in the eye and said, is there a problem with the request. Hostess said no, but still looked annoyed. We waited 20 minutes and still no heater. I walked back in and asked the same hostess and she had a deer in the headlight look and said the heaters were not working. I asked her why she didn't let me know when we were outside since there was no room to wait inside, and she said I forgot. I reminded her we specifically asked for the heaters because there were small children and there were others waiting outside that had heaters on and I asked hostess what attempts were made to make the heaters work, since there were plenty on the other patio area that had plenty of heaters that were not turned on. Hostess replied with just a ""sorry"", as if no attempts were made and that she simply forgot to ask someone to turn the heaters on and felt it was easier just to say it was broken. I was beyond annoyed at this point, and asked to speak to the manager, at which point I was told our table was being set for us. I was upset, but because i was with family choose not to make a bigger scene and let it go. 2 months later, I finally wanted to voice my experience.",gaU5ZD0XqilbsnuvU53NHg,3,0,1,FkQNnbTRgdWBudaY_mZveA

781946,2012-08-31,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I hosted a staff gathering at DeMarco's this week.  Since we were a group of 10 the hostess reserved a large table in the bar area for us.  When I arrived the table was all set and ready.  I met our waitress, Sara and ordered some appetizers and salads to begin.

Appetizers: Bruschetta Trio, Golden Calamari & Dom's Fries.  The Bruschetta Trio is not a pretty dish.  The white bean flavor looks like brains.  The tomato balsamic looks like your standard bruschetta and the prosciutto flavor was a little unappealing too.  No one was impressed with this dish.  The calamari was well received as well as the fries.  The calamari appeared to have a good mix of ring & tentacle parts.

Salads:  15th Street BLT and Mediterranean.  Everyone that tried the BLT said it was really good.  It had a nice blend of lettuce, bacon, cheese & dressing and was topped with 1/2 of an avocado.  Good comments about the Mediterranean salad too.  

Pizza:  Big Apple, both thin crust and Sicilian style, White Truffle and Artichoke.  The feedback on the Big Apple was that the toppings to cheese to sauce to crust ratio was good.  You had a variety of flavors and textures in every bite.  Our group did favor the Sicilian style crust over the thin.  The artichoke pizza looked nicely balanced too.  The artichokes were nice and big and looked fresh, never frozen.  The abundant amount of fresh basil was a plus too.  The favorite was the White Truffle.  Our group reported a good meaty texture from the mushrooms with a hint of truffle as opposed to the flavor overpowering the rest of the pizza.  

We also tried the Tiramisu for dessert.  It was okay.  A couple people wanted just a bite of something sweet to cut through the richness, which this accomplished but we did not finish the dessert.  

The bar has a large selection and we ordered a variety of beverages.  I had the J. Lohr Riverstone Chardonnay and really liked it.  It was not oakey, buttery or sweet.  It was a crisp refeshing white.  It was especially good to me because it was chilled properly.  I do not appreciate warm white wine.  The rest of the group enjoyed their choices too.  

Dom DeMarco's is a little expensive if you are expecting a meal of pizza and drinks but the quality supports the price and the staff is friendly and accommodating.  

On a different note, thank you for choosing this location rather than a couple blocks down the street.  You can actually pull into your parking lot, find a space and get into the restaurant without playing Frogger with the cars and pedestrians.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,4,2,4,g6y3PNK3mHIbhsjiqaxDMw

Can't imagine a place so heavenly but when one restaurant can satisfy my savory, salty, sweet, carb addicted alcoholic taste buds at one sitting - I'm in!

I've become a regular here teetering between their Big Apple pie (pepperoni, ham, italian sausage, meatball, mozzarella and grana padano cheese which is a semifat hard cheese cooked and ripened slowly for about 9 months) and their infamous Di Fara Special (thick square pie with mozzarella and grana padano cheese) both with fresh basil.  This pizza has crisp pepperoni that I suffer through the hand slapping as I try and pick them off the pizza.  BEWARE those, who like me -  love food, I find myself leaving in a food coma every time.

Side note to all the OTHER pizza places out there - USE FRESH BASIL.

To avoid my freshman 15 flashbacks, I will order the Soho salad (mixed greens, grilled fennel and asparagus in a truffle vinaigrette) it's very light - you can add grilled chicken or shrimp and it's definitely enough to share.  My alternative is their Tomato and Burrata appetizer (cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.)  It's drizzled with balsamic and as Rachel Ray would say EVOO.  (Ya sorry it's a weeknight and it's getting late.)

As this is one of the few non asian restaurants I'll bring my folks to - I have to tell you about their White Truffle pizza.  This sauce less pizza has mushrooms, mozzarella, parmesan, and garlic truffle oil.  My mom raved about this pizza for at least a month.  It's so good, she makes me order the large pizza so she can take home the leftovers.  So Chinese. 

Fellow Yelpers will feel my pain as I try to understand why this pizza can be better than the billion other pizzerias around town.  It was so obvious - it's the fresh ingredients - but specifically for me it is all about the tomatoes they use.  Dom Demarco's uses imported fresh San Marzano tomatoes - think Roma Tomatoes times two - sweeter with less seeds and less acid.  And of course - FRESH BASIL.

Now for you fellow alcoholics - the bar has a to die for pineapple drink infused with vodka overnight.  Um ya.  To boot they have 12 beers on draft and a wine menu that is a necessity for every Italian fare.   Need I say more...",kVAy8nol_GefMbR7awm5TA,4,5,5,jwxOND2JqBzGEOaAstS3fw

Very nice dining room.  Comfortable, private outside patio/outdoor space.  Friendly helpful staff.  

Burt had the fried eggplant with fresh ricotta for an app. (hint- order some fresh ricotta on the side for the table)   It was very good.  Linguini and clams was very flavorful and tasty.  Just the right amount of garlic,  not overbearing.  

Burt's mom had spaghetti and meatballs.  I know, its a basic dish but it tells a lot about an Italian place.  Very good meatballs, spaghetti was prepared correctly, nice gravy.  

The dessert was GREAT!!!  Homemade cannoli and tiramisu. No matter how stuffed you are from dinner, make sure you order some desert.   The cappuccino was so-so. 

Dommy D's gets an extra point because the waitress was cute (she looks like a mature version of Burt's old lady). - That's a good thing!

BURT'S DISCLAIMER - Dom DeMarco is known for their pizza.  I guess Obama ordered some pie's from here when he was in town.  Burt didn't try the pizza.  It did look delicious but Burt feels this is an incomplete review without tasting the pie.  Possible upgrade to 4.5 stars.       To be continued.

UPDATE - Burt did go back to try the pizza. Yes it is very good. Thin crispy crust, nice sauce, light cheese. So yes the pie is good. The problem was that the regular food didn't taste as good as it did the first time. Maybe it was an ""off"" night?  Therefore no upgrade in rating because the food slid down a notch but the pizza lifted the rating back to where it was. 
PS Burt still gives the server a great review. WSUP",knSvZR6ATjwqdPB21I6TuQ,1,1,4,xNFC8XonSt4d_EmOrsbvPQ

Tried the prime rib sandwich also this time.  It was just o.k., pretty dry since I requested it without the horseradish, it needs more filling for the bread, maybe some au jus.

1079107,2012-06-25,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Everything was on point the night I visited.  It was quite crowded, but service was prompt and friendly.
I started with the Eggplant Pizzettes for an appetizer - crispy, breaded eggplant, creamy ricotta and well-seasoned tomato sauce were all delicious.
Their pizzas can be made with either of two crust styles: A round New York style thin crust or a square, thick crusted Sicialian pan style.  I was able to sample both.  We ordered the Di Fara Special which comes on the thick, square crust and it was fantastic.  The crust had that super crispy fried edge along the bottom that comes from being baked in an iron skillet.  It was topped with pepperoni and it was apparent that the ingredients were quality -thick cut, spicy pepperoni with fresh mozzarella, grana padano and a flavorful tomato sauce.  Each piece was quite hardy and it didn't take much to fill me up.
The other pizza we ordered was the Bianca on a thin crust.  This crust was not quite as thin as some New York style I have had, but the flavor of the dough was great and stood up to the toppings of garlic, basil, ricotta and cheese.
I would have a hard time picking a favorite between the two pizzas and will most likely order one of each the next time I go.  And since I am secretly addicted to pouring Green Tabasco all over my pizza, the leftovers were almost better than the first night.  Especially with the garlic in the Bianca seeming to mellow and penetrate the remaining toppings.  

There was a line waiting to be seated as we finished eating, but our server did not try to rush us, which I appreciate.  I just hope they can maintain their quality, because I will definitely be returning soon.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,1,0,5,2J8JhXP09CngBjfu7U1jkA

I got the Caesar salad, Arancini (risotto balls), and Di Fara pizza and everything was amazing. All pizzas have the option of being prepared with thin or thick crust. My server, Marco, recommended thick crust for the Di Fara and I really enjoyed it. 

Also, if you're a whiskey drinker, the barrel aged whiskey cocktail is delicious. Strong and flavorful- just how I like it!

Pizza was Awesome! Carbonara was THE best! And the Alfredo was great too. No Complaints about the food, by any means. The Chef even came out and shook hands with us and wanted our feedback on the food. 

Now for the bad part of this experience. Stephanie was our waitress. She was very nice but hung over and forgetful. We had to ask three separate times for our bread and butter. Had to ask multiple times for our second glass of wine. She never brought our coffee to go with our dessert and we had to ask 3 times for our to go boxes. Finally the busboy who walks by our table is more attentive than our waitress. Three tables came in after us with more settings than our table and they were served before us. Then, the manager (the short guy, couldn't tell you his name because he didn't take the time to come introduce himself to our table like he did EVERY other table) looks at me dead in the eye and never came and asked how our meal was our if everything was ok. I suppose its the short Italian man syndrome. We didn't have a man at our table so he didn't think we were big tippers. Yes, Italian men think like this!

Then our waitress realized that she was so bad with her service and lack of attention that she proceeds to give us a 20% off coupon for the meal but when we get to register it was expired. WTH! 

(Oh and waitstaff, please do not tell your customers that you are working two jobs and have given your notice at this location and its too hard to memorize the menu). NOT GOOD! Stick to one job if two is too much for you to handle. There are plenty of waitstaff that need income and would appreciate memorizing the menu SINCE ITS THEIR JOB! Oh, and don't tell your customers that you were out partying the night before and have a hang over. BAD SERVICE!!!!

Just wear your knights gear! During playoff season, for every knights victory, they increased the percentage by 1 for every win! Wow!! When we went, we got 23% off our entire check.

All pizzas come either pan or hand-tossed, and my favorite is the ""Big Apple."" This pizza has meatballs, ham, sausage, pepperoni, and mozzarella. I enjoy the pizza, but a full-size will run you $30.00.

Everyone said, ""Great, thanks!""  and left with their pies.  I couldn't believe it.  So I was ready when they brought mine out.

1568364,2012-08-08,2,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"There are some foods which are like religion, and not in the good ""missionaries travel to a third world country with clean water and bandaids"" kinda way. More like the splintered sects that quibble over details until they decide on something real fun, like The Inquisition.

Pizza is that kind of religion.

Some sects have thick necked men who watch football, shovel their own snow, and know at least two good rumors about Jimmy Hoffa. That sect likes their pizza crust thick and their toppings simple and traditional.

Other sects have devotees who wear sandals, vacuum sand out of the floorboard of their car, and know someone who has been hand cuffed for protecting a tree. That sect likes their pizza thin and topped with exotics like pineapple, bar-b-que sauce and tofu.

Finally there is a sect with loud men and women who watch baseball, don't own a car (or a license), and can remember when riding the subway was dangerous, but necessary. That sect likes their pizza crust thin and acrobatically thrown, spun, stretched and worked until ready. Their sauce takes time to get right, and their toppings are traditional.

Dom DeMarco's wants to be in that third sect, and I do mean 'wants'. 

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot good here. The bartender was hustling when we were there, on the floor, checking drinks and bringing refills. Service was decent too, we didn't wait long and our order was correct.

But the whole reason you pay $20 for a medium pizza is that you believe that they worship the same pizza deity that you do, and they will follow the scriptures and get it right. That, sadly was not the case.

Lets talk about crust for a moment. How can you tell if its good? Lets not start at the wide end that everyone looks at first. No, I want you to look at the pointy end. Flip up that point and touch the crust. It shouldn't be soggy and spongey. DeMarco's was like overcooked lasagna noodles at the tip.

For the sauce, it should be tasty and tangy on its own. If it gets most of its flavor from the other toppings, its too weak. If its over seasoned, the toppings will get lost. DeMarco's was Meh flavored.

Now the toppings, simple is better here. Good quality, uncomplicated and covering the pizza in an even layer. DeMarco's did ok with this one.

Now, does this review mean that you will not like their food? Maybe not. If you only worship pizza on special occasions and holidays. If you are non-denominational and ok as long as the toppings are tasty, if your standards allow for a bit of error and your still willing to pay top dollar for close enough, come on by.

But, if you know what you like, and have an opinion on Mets vs Yankees...this may not meet your standards.",GTcKUjRulTRN_XxehMgSZQ,3,3,3,-EECkRpx814SsQc1hWjotw

The bartender was friendly and very good.  The Pinot Noir I ordered was also a very nice wine.  But I sat, and sat, and sat - no food.  Finally, 45 mins later, I asked the bartender where my food was!  The host clearly didn't remember that I said I would be at the bar because my food was sitting on a table and was not very hot when I got it.  Also, when I got home saw that the pizza I ordered (white truffle thin crust) was not the pizza I received (white truffle deep dish). Spinach salad and pizza are good, but the service is the reason I will not be back.

After my initial experience and post, the general manager contacted me and invited me to return.  I like that he actually read about my experience and took the time to contact me.  I finally had a chance to return last week, and it was a completely different experience.  This time my boyfriend and I ate there (I was actually a little nervous to try to do takeout again).  Fernando was our server and he was friendly, attentive and personable.  We had the meatball appetizer, which was delicious, a salad, and pizza.  The pizza took a little longer than expected, but both a manager and Fernando came to let us know the one they made wasn't up to their standards and they would be making us a new one.  My boyfriend loved this place so much, we went back a few days later and had a few beers and ordered takeout from the bar.

1571011,2015-12-03,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I don't know how common this knowledge is, but I have it on good authority -- meaning this is totally hearsay -- that the name Dom DeMarco belongs to the man who came up with the pizza recipe. He lives in New Jersey and has nothing to do with this restaurant except that he sold the recipe to the owners and wanted his name on the building. 

And man oh man what a recipe it is. The pizza here is so awesome. I love pizza, and I often have very low standards. I'll eat Little Caesar's if you put it in front of me and I'll hate myself the entire time. I love pizza so much. That said, I am under no illusions about the quality of these pizzas. While I will still eat Little Caesar's, I do not think it is good. It is just pizza and I love pizza.

The pizza here has everything. Sometimes I have to order my pizzas well done, but the crust here comes out just right by default. The selection of toppings is great, and the quality of the ingredients is great. The sauce is delicious; often I find myself ordering light sauce at other places, or wiping off big chunks of sauce from parts of the dough that are uncovered by cheese and toppings. Not here. Not only do I not get pizzas with big empty spots of bread and sauce, if I did I'd just eat them because both the crust and sauce are delicious. 

The garlic knots. Man oh man the garlic knots. I know my profile says I'm Paleo and I know that my reviews typically focus on the healthiness of the food i'm eating and the quality of their ingredients, and I know that all of this would lead you to believe that I would never eat garlic knots. These are so worth it. They are amazing. They are large, and slightly crispy on the outside but warm and soft inside. The crispness of the outside isn't like a shell, so much as it just provides ever-so-slight resistance before giving way to the soft delicious woven bread within.

On this occasion I just ordered their suggested BLT Salad, which consisted of butter lettuce, bacon, avocado and a very generous amount of blue cheese.  My husband ordered the meatball sliders which came with a choice of a side and this case he chose the truffle fries.   Both selections were nothing special.

We ordered their caprese salad (different name the menu but same concept) and while it was fantastic the price for what we received was sad. There were 12 quartered pieces of red  tomato and slivers of basil with a nice hunk of a more creamy mozzarella. They give you plenty of mozzarella but a few extra tomato slices and a lot more basil would make this salad worth the $12. As it stands its a one person appetizer. 

We ordered the Do Fara Special pizza. It comes in thick crust only which was good (burnt on the edges so that was a let down), however the pizza sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce. That was something I hadn't expected and didn't care for. If I wanted spaghetti I would have ordered it. The pepperoni was small and over cooked. The basil was itty bitty and couldn't even be tasted. 

I'll give this place on more chance when we're feeling like pizza again, but after this first experience I'd have to say that even Papa John's has better pizza then what we had tonight.",fS86t0IvNj-kDBae2mJHSQ,0,0,3,E9Xday0qUeSzSn8loJdBmQ

The crust was semi charred which was nice but it didn't make up for anything i found wrong.  The cake slices we were given were decent but one had two sides and the top slathered in frosting...

Just having moved to Vegas, I tried Dom DeMarco's as it is just down the hill from me and have been back 4 more times in the last month.

The pizza is real New York style Napolitana pizza, with real cheese. I was in pizza heaven from the first bite. Wow, what a treat after Los Angeles imitation pizza. Now the meatballs are to die for and maybe the absolute best I have ever had in my life. Tasty,  light and soaking in a fabulous marinara sauce. Another favorite is the 15th St. BLT salad with an incredible blue cheese dressing.

When i approached the bar to ask about what kind of drinks were available during the happy hour i was informed that anything they didnt have to open (ie wines) were half off. Then i was told the server would be taking my order. After we ate and paid the bill a few of us migrated over to the bar for some drinks and the first thing i was asked by the bartender was ""where's your server?"" 

Food wise everything was pretty good. Some things are better on certain crusts like the white pizza on the thin pan totally awesome and considerably less troublesome than going to cosmo for secret pizza. 

The Di Fara Special on square cut thick crust is absolutely incredible with the crisp pepperoni but i honestly would have loved it a lot more if they julienned the basil and just threw it all over the damn pie with no regard of quantity control what so ever.

That's about all i can remember at the moment. Being super super hungry and devouring an alarming amount of square cut slices and washing it down with many Angry Orchard ales on tap to suddenly get you full takes a lot out of you. 

I definitely know where to go if i ever have a late night pizza craze on the cheap side now.

Getting a table at 6pm on a Sunday was pretty difficult! We waited about 20 mins and found the restaurant to be packed and possibly understaffed. As for the food, wow. Ok, I am not a huge fan of Italian but was desperately craving pasta. Although the pizza looked amazing I was dying to try the parpadelle bolognase....WHOA! It was extremely delicious and exactly what I was craving. My mom got the lasagne and was more than impressed. She said it was one of the best she had ever had!!!! The portions are also absolutely massive. The lasagne could feed a village. We started with the garlic bread which was a bit disappointing. There was no garlic flavor and none of that buttery goodness you expect with garlic bread! We also got the tiramisu and weren't impressed. It was pretty soggy and very intense. Although the start and finish were sub par, the main meal really made up for it! I don't typically order bread or dessert so this was not a deciding factor for me!

2006426,2013-01-27,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"My husband loving pizza and loving Dom DeMarco's, I knew this would be the perfect place to have his graduation party! I called about a month before his graduation from UNLV and was helped by Nico. We agreed that he would give us half of the patio (with heat lamps) and we worked out a price per person (as we figured about 20 people) with appetizers and pizza as well as wine and beer.

Well, as fate would have it- one of the few days that it rains and is windy happened on his day.  The assistant manager, Carl, was fabulous!!  He arranged for us to be inside with no problems.

Also, the UNLV graduation lasted about 4 hours (2 hours longer than I had planned!) and I made an emergency call to Carl and he was taking care of everything.  If anyone showed up from our party- he was serving them (without any deposit from us!) and telling everyone the situation.  My cell phone died as I was trying to reach everyone.  So needless to say, I was in super panic mode!

We got to Dom DeMarcos- our friends and family were eating and drinking and having a great time!

We had:
1. EGGPLANT PIZZETTES  9
Breaded eggplant topped with whipped ricotta, parmesan reggiano, basil and tomato sauce.
*Delicious. Even those that ""don't like eggplant"" liked these!
2. GRAM'S MEATBALLS SLIDERS  11
Secret family recipe of pork, beef, and veal, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.
*These are the only meatballs I like besides my own. Juicy and full of flavor.  I usually order them lollipop style (on a stick) instead of sliders.
3. CAESAR  FULL 9, HALF 5
Hearts of romaine lettuce in creamy garlic dressing, shaved parmesan reggiano.
*Being that its my husbands grad party and he loves Caesar salad this was a must have. Classic and delicious!
4. MEDITERRANEAN  FULL 13, HALF 7
Chopped romaine, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red peppers, garbanzo beans, red onion, pepperoncinis, kalamata olives, feta, house vinaigrette.
*Great salad and full of veggies!
4. Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza
5. Cheese Pizza
6. Pepperoni Pizza
*Classic New York pizza that everyone enjoys.

Food kept coming out and no one went hungry!  In fact, some guests left with boxes of food.

We had less people than we thought, so we were charged per dish and per drink (we didn't limit to beer & wine- we said serve whatever anyone wanted).

Bill came to less than $250 for everything! OMG- amazing!! For all the food and drinks for about 12-15 people. This was great!

I would highly recommend having a party here as everyone was very helpful and accommodating.

2013651,2013-04-22,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Dom DeMarco's serves a great pizza. The crust was crispy but still tender. Black char in a few places which, for me, is perfection. The pepperoni was thick and small and full of flavor. If I based the review on pizza alone, it would get 5 stars, no doubt. So, What went wrong?
 
I had to ask twice for sweetener for my iced tea. By the time I received the sweetener the ice had melted and I had a glass of room temperature tea. The BLT salad was just OK. The dressing, if there was any, had no flavor. The Gorgonzola cheese was the only thing giving this salad any flavor. Not a big fan. But, Dom's isn't known for the salads, so I could forgive. The crispy garlic bread was good and it was crispy. Only 4 bucks so we definitely liked that. We also ordered a cannoli, imagine my surprise when it wasn't an authentic cannoli. It was not made with ricotta cheese. I'm guessing mascarpone. Whatever it was, it was disappointing. No hint of citrus, not enough chocolate chips. But, I will say this, for a fake cannoli, it was a good fake.

What really cost them 2 stars was the restaurant itself. It's dark inside. So dark that I saw at least 5 different tables using the flashlight app on their phone to read the menu. And logistically, the restaurant is a nightmare. The amount of waitstaff whizzing by our tables was head spinning. So much so, that I had a headache by the time we left. The bar is on the right side of the restaurant. The kitchen along the back wall. The drink station for the wait staff is in the very front right corner. The staff is constantly criss-crossing the restaurant. It is nonstop. Downright hectic. restaurant is in a storefront in a strip mall so, it's not the most ideal space and they definitely deserve a better, bigger space. And if you have to wait for a table, the wait area is so small people are literally standing next to you watching you eat. I felt as though we should have offered them a slice of pizza! I hope they move, because we decided we won't return, at least not during peak hours. It's why too overcrowded servers! I told my husband next time we can order the pizza to go and eat it in our car in the parking lot! We don't live close to Dom's and I think the pizza would lose that crispness if we took it all the way home. 
So if you want a great, NY style pizza, this is the place to go and if you want to feel like you're eating it in the middle of Times Square, then you'll really love it. Looking for a nice, relaxing meal? Look somewhere else.",qiA5QI85-A2WB5lKRlyCIQ,1,1,3,kRei8pr7cqjFcRZWJ1o50g

The food arriving at the tables around us looked amazing and smelled even better.  If it hadn't been for the enormous pizza in front of us, we may have been a wee bit jealous of everyone else's food!  We are most definitely coming back here again soon to enjoy the chic atmosphere and fantastic pizza.

I went there in December and after spending $75 was told I needed to hurry up and pay cause the waiter was leaving! They close at 10 and it was just a bit before 10. We ended up staying a few minutes past and were asked to leave when there was 2 other tables sitting that were not asked to leave. I've never felt so disrespected in my life! I will never go back there even though the food was good. Bad service makes for bad reviews and bad word of mouth!

2240543,2014-03-07,2,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Tried this place for the first time tonight. It is close to my house and offered gluten free pizza. I ordered for pick up small pizza ( only available size for gluten free) and a tomato burrata appetizer. 

12' pizza is 12$. Then an additional 6$ for the gluten free crust. Then 2$ per topping. 
So you're looking at a 24$ dinky pizza with bell peppers, mushrooms, and 6 spinach leaves ( yes, 6 leaves for 2$!).

The tomato and burrata was a complete rip off at 12$. Was a slab of cheese, a few shreds of basil, and 9 very tiny, cold tomato wedges (another Yelper posted that she got 12 small wedges and felt the proportion of tomatoes to cheese was lacking so you can imagine mine). The container included a two small sauce cups, one with olive oil and the other with a balsamic reduction. 

The cheese and balsamic sauce were actually tasty. The tomatoes were not sweet and they were cold. Fresh tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated. 

The pizza was okay and I could see ordering it again IF it weren't 24$ a pop when I can make a comparable one with organic ingredients at home for 12$. 

So total was 41$ including a 2$ tip. 
Not worth the price for the food/portions",HcAyy3XZTCMSMjtg74k36Q,13,3,2,qIsV8GP_8eNVxGAwYDGgqA

I know nothing too do with yelp but thought it was cool beepers tell you table ready shaped like pizza! 

We had couple appetizers too start our meal fried calamari and buffalo mozzarella/tomatoe. Calamari was fried too nice golden crispy. I liked is the batter not that heavy so nice light and marinara dipping sauce was good. Buffalo mozzarella was really nice. It nice soft consistency not firm one. Felt much more flavor and depth but paired it with fresh tomatoes perfect! 

My brother, sister-in-law and I shared thick crust pizza or felt like it was more foccaica white cheese pizza. It shaped like rectangle first instinct round table pizza. Honestly not even in the ballpark. This pizza has soo much flavor and I enjoyed the crust it was different then normal thin crust pizza always eat. My nieces had the pasta with meatballs. I tried the meatballs. Good. It nice moist in the center cooked just right and nice seasonings too it. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter accident dropped couple pieces of calamari brought it too the table. Surprised he going too return with couple more but ended up giving up another order free of charge. Classy. The hostess greeted us with smile and even on the way out.

Pizza comes in two styles - New York thin crust and square cut thick crust baked in a cast iron pan.  I'm not a big fan of thick crust so we went for the thin crust white truffle pizza.  Very tasty.  $22 for a large but the pizza was huge!  We are still eating it for lunch three days later.  And so greasy, it left puddles of oil on our plates (and still does).  I got over it after a few bites.  Also, they put a ton of parmesan on the pizza.  You'd be crazy to ask for extra.  Generous with the toppings and cheese.  They have a variety of sizes, small, large, half, and full, for your dining needs.

We also tried the Mediterranean salad, which was also very good.  Romaine lettuce, feta, kalamata olives, garbanzo beans, onions, cucumber, and their house vinaigrette, which is like a Greek dressing.  Very fresh and tasty.

Good beer selection.  Guinness, Stone, Mirror Pond.  They were out of the Deschutes but hopefully they will bring it back.  

They have cute little pizza shaped vibrating pagers if you have to wait for a table. If you want to avoid the crowds, your best bet is to come during the day on a weekend around 3pm or so.  Great service.  Looking forward to more visits.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,7,5,4,AG_YPMdtTFhcRRAh4h3IHA

we ordered a full pizza when we only should have ordered a  half. The portions were huge !!! So needless to say we had tons of leftovers. 

We also ordered the garlic knots they were so so - but they did keep us from getting hangry while we waited for the pizza.

We started with the garlic knots--Huge rolls, baked to perfection and bathed in garlic and olive oil.  Marinara sauce and olive oil dipping sauces on the side were exceptional, and the EVOO was among some of the best I've ever tasted.

The first thing that got my attention when the pepperoni pizza arrived was the glorious aroma.  Heaven!  The sauce boasted chunks of flavorful tomatoes...the pepperoni edges curled and crisp.  Topped with fresh basil to give it a pop and tie the flavors together nicely.

Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambience is surprisingly nice, given its location in a strip mall.

2288589,2012-01-29,1,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Yes I am a pizza nerd. It's my fascination, my passion, my lust. I was in NY last summer eating my way through Brooklyn's highest rated pizza joints when I heard that Dom DeMarco Jr. was bringing Di Faro to Vegas. I nearly wet my pants in delight!

Well, after months of waiting I was hoping Dom DeMarco's would complete the holy trinity of pizzas in Las Vegas, and Jesus Mary and Joseph it did!

We began with the eggplant pizzettes which were absolutely fabu! The sauces used here are made daily from San Marzano tomatoes, which is what I use at home as I love the rich, strong but sweet flavor that they offer. The eggplant was fresh and flavorful; the breading coating it was seasoned with Italian herbs, and combined with the sauce and the dollop of whipped ricotta on top shot this appetizer into entrée territory. Seriously, they should layer 3 or 4 of these and call it a meal!

We then moved on to the 15th Street BLT - my new favorite salad. It's loaded with bacon, avocado, tomatoes and dripping with a beautiful gorgonzola dressing. It's perfect for two people, and I SHOULD have stopped there as I was comfortably full. 

Now for the main event: the pizza. The crust was crispy yet chewy, soft and perfectly charred, and dipped in the San Marzano tomato infused grease that had dripped onto my plate was simply moan inducing. The combination of the crust, sauce and cheeses make this one of the best pizzas I've had in Vegas in a while. 

I am a traditionalist and must finish any Italian meal with a tiramisu. Here it came in a little glass and was light, fluffy, perfectly sweet and creamy. A perfect end to the feast.

I'd rank Dom DeMarco's in between Settebello and Due Forni.",-HAHTQeOzHX5TCDb7qs9Yw,3,2,5,1wsVVCcSaP-gShxGAHc-wQ

My husband is totally a pizza guy and he was HUNGRY!  We walked in and were promptly seated by the friendly hostess. We noticed that there was a large party of about 20 women at one table and a family of four at another. All in all, pretty quiet for mid-afternoon on a Labor Day Monday.  

We got menus and drinks...and waited. Another couple were seated close to us in the restaurant. We waited. A table of four were seated. We waited. There were two waitresses in our section - but ours was evidently tied up with the large party. The couple ordered and received appetizers - my hungry-hungry husband fell into a low-blood sugar quiet funk. We waited. The table of four put in their order. We waited. Finally, our waitress came over and admitted she had forgotten that she hadn't taken our order. (Kudos on the honesty...)

Now, as hungry as he was, the husband was nice enough to capitulate to my love of thin crust pizza, ordering up a thin-crust Margherita, instead of going with the toothier square cut. After watching all of the tables that were seated after us dig into their food - our much heralded pizza finally arrived.

It was just OK. I liked the balance of flavors of the cheese versus the fresh basil and the sauce. The cheese tasted incredibly fresh and of high quality. I felt the crust was a little too thin - bordering on a crispy cracker (but I'm a California gal, what do I know of true NY style pizza?). Kind of flavorless too. We'll definitely be back, I still want to try the cheeseless Bella Napoli - but maybe we'll make sure there aren't any large parties in the house before we sit down.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,3,0,3,Fi3PGfQxxJQwduGxi-7I-g

THIS is good pizza. I wish I could use swear words in this review because I REALLY want to get my point across: THIS IS AMAZING PIZZA!!!

My friends and I came here after hitting the Brew fest all day to sop up the alcohol with PIZZA and CARBS. Yum. 

It was my first time here. It was about 9:00 on a Saturday night. We didn't have to wait. AWESOME. The patio looked (and sounded) intriguing because there were a lot of people out there and it seemed like there was an awesome party going on. But, we had been outside in the cold all day so we opted to sit inside. 

We ordered the 15th Street BLT salad to share and we stared at the pizza options for a good 15 minutes before we finally decided to settle on the DI FARA SPECIAL.

BLT salad came out really quickly and it had an entire avocado on top of it. I love avocado. Very fresh and simple but with great flavors: the bacon really complimented the cheese flavor of the dressing. 

The DI FARA turned out to be an amazing decision. When we ordered it, the waitress asked if we wanted the smaller version. We said no and upon eating my first bite, I was very happy we got so much of it because I was already excited to eat it cold! 

The pizza was deep dish (I'm not sure if you can get NY style if you ask for it?). The crust was flaky and soft but crunchy and almost had a buttery flavor to it. It was heavenly. The sauce is on-another-planet-good and the pepperoni reminded me of Grimaldi's pepperoni (but smaller). Very authentic and meaty. The cheese was wonderful and balanced the flavors of the sauce and crust perfectly. I don't think I could have imagined a better deep dish pizza, honestly. 

Some might say $26 is a lot for pizza, but I don't. This pizza was huge. I only ate 2 pieces and probably should have stopped after 1.5 but literally ate past ""full"" because of how good it was. The 3 of us ate about half of the pizza and I was MORE THAN HAPPY to take it home and have another 2-3 days of left over pizza! :) 

Oh, and our server was wonderful and friendly and kept our drinks full all night!

The antipasto platter was excellent, and was filled with good cheese and cold cuts.

The entrees, according to my friends were all good and the desserts were good.  The mascarpone tart, or whatever it was, was a bit dry, although the cannoli was good.  Overall, they serve good pizza, but also a solid assortment of real Italian food.  It is rare that you can have a place that is an actual Italian restaurant outside of pizza, that does very good quality food as well as being a place that you could go just to pick up a great pizza.

We got there at 11 (funny enough made reservations thinking the place would be wall to wall with such a stellar offering of F&B) and it was empty! We were the only ones!
Should have changed gears then-but...
We were apologized to several times for the lack of accurate info and their discontinuation of the BM bar, the brunch menu, forgetting bread etc etc.

And they weren't made with Absolute-they were the house vodka-BUT they were still $7. I had one, the mix was good-presentation not so much.
Next try-Sangria-white-in short NO.
Tried my friends Red-ah NO again.
Neither had fruit in it-whaaaa?

After arriving on a busy Friday night and waiting about 15 minutes to be seated in the bar area.  The server arrived to our table in a timely manner however she felt compelled to rush away to attend to other tables. No worries, it's only my first time and I might have some questions about this supposedly glorious pizza. I show her my Yelp check in for our free order of garlic knots. Damn it feels good to be a Yelper!

After my inquisitive mind relinquished all my questions on this poor server I decided on the Mushroom & White Truffle pizza with 1/2 homemade sausage. The kids got a cheese pizza and some dough to play with while we waited. That is an AWESOME Idea because the kids were quiet the entire meal.  I disliked the $3 each kids lemonade they only drink a few sips.  I decided to try the house beer Dom Demarco IPA which was ok. I did notice they have a decent draft and craft beer selection featuring both local and regional brews.

The pizza came out in timely manner but was luke warm when it arrived at the table.  The kids pizza however was bubbling hot.  Like mix up in the food prep if you ask me.  I would say make the kids pizza first and the parents pizza last to keep it HOT! and let the kids cool down as to not burn them.  No worries because pizza is one of those foods that can be enjoyed at any temp and even left out over night on the stove and consumed the next day.  

The flavor of the White truffle was very subtle.  The white sauce was also very mild which gave the pizza a well balanced taste.  The pizza crust and dough was of good density and not to thick on the thin crust pizza which gave each slice a nice crunch and sturdy enough to hold the toppings in tact.  

Next time I will try the deep dish to see how that style of fairs against some of the great pizza places I have eaten in Chicago. As of now, I'm still seeking the best Pizza Place in Vegas.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,3,1,3,Byk8TJ10pFFy-XDu7DcaBg

2786722,2012-08-26,1,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Okay. Let me start off by saying this. I live in Las Vegas, but I am from Brooklyn, NY. For 41 years I had lived in NYC and know all there is to know about pizza. I grew up with pizza. I have worked in pizzerias, i have studied pizza. My college degree is in Pizza. I don't believe in hype. Yea I heard the POTUS ordered here when he was in town. But he's from Chicago, and deep dish is good. UT not the pizza I know and love... So what could he know. I didn't go because of that I went because it was supposed to be a copycat of DiFaras world famous in Brooklyn pizza. 

The pizza here is in my mind, the absolute best I have had in Las Vegas. It isn't exactly the same as you would get in a NY pizza joint, but comes close enough. For LV it is very very good. For a NY transplant to want to take their guests and Italian relatives here it would have to be. Don't believe any reviews here that say otherwise.

I have been to the DiFara's in Brookyn whose maestro is the eponymous inspiration for this establishment. I am not at all crazy about DiFara's and at $5 a slice it is way overpriced and overhyped, but they do make an excellent square slice, or as we in NY call, a Sicilian. So, that is what we ordered here... Very comparable. As close to a copy as one could get here. It had enough cheeses and sauce with the requisite fresh basil on top. It was very crunchy on the side crust and bottom as a good Sicilian should be and soft and airy in the middle. Very well done... Maybe, maybe just a bit oily, but not offensive. We have been back 4 times since and were always very pleased. I doubt I will try another pizzeria here again, and just to clarify a point... We love Due Forni on Town Center Drive but that isn't really pizza. It's gourmet pizza, not NY pizza. 

The service varies. Good to okay, nothing to complain about. We have had the spinach salad which was very tasty and the eggplant appetizer which was very good as well. 
On our last visit we order the round pie, or Neapolitan. It was very good as well, better than my wife and I expected. We had made the square our go-to dish, but now can def say the round will be added to our repoirtoire.

One of the things I love about our area is that it is super family friendly. The fact that we had a 3yr with us and that did not phase the restaurant even a tiny bit! They took great care of us! Got us a table right away, we were settled in very quickly, even though it was a busy night! 

Not only did our server check in with us, so did others as they walked by.
We really felt taken care of!

If they take reservations, I could not find anywhere to do that on the website, but I admit I did not call. And I wished I had, because the out door patio looked SO INVITING! Now I know!

White Truffle Pizza on the patio, during a warm Las vegas night! Yes Please!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,0,0,4,7oko0uZMzccupG_fscVpnw

We ordered some wine and beer, great wine by the glass selection and tap beer selection as well.  They had Peroni on tap which was a nice touch.  The space is really nice, we loved the design inside and were sad it was too windy to sit outside.  It looked so nice and fun with big screen tvs and a huge electric fireplace.  They have a bunch of magazines at the front door, which could be cool if you are dining alone.  

We had a salad with green beans and asparagus with a truffle vinaigrette.  This was great.  The pizza we ordered with a new york crust had sausage and eggplant on it.  It was very tasty.  All in all the food was probably a 5.

The missteps were with the service.  While the atmosphere of the restaurant was trendy and upscale, our service was rather casual.  Our server was kind of condescending and kept asking us ""are you sure?"" whenever we would order something.  We tried to get garlic on our pizza and she told us there was enough on top of it already, which there wasn't.   She also asked if we wanted the salad with the pizza, to which we replied yes.  After the pizza came out we still had no salad and two different people had to come ask if we ordered a salad.  It was just kind of odd.

I think they put the wings in the deep fryer and then put them on a grill.  The server checked back with me pretty quickly. She said that the pizza will be arriving soon. Several minutes later, I watched her bring the pizza towards my table and then she did a 180 and went to the kitchen. A few minutes after that, she came back and apologized to me. She noticed that the pizza was prepared incorrectly and said that they will need to make it again. A free salad was offered. I elected to take the garden salad. The salad consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, and nothing else! The vinaigrette dressing was very good, however. The pizza finally arrived and it was ok, at best. The pizza tasted very thick and the crust wasn't soft like a good New York pizza.  The server checked back with me and I watched her refill my drink which was completely watered down already.  The server should have brought me a fresh cup of soda instead of adding more soda to a watered down mess!  The food runners and bussers were helpful and offered to box up my food as I finished.  Finally it was time for the bill. I was shocked that my meal was still over $25 even with the discount. I dined alone and I didn't anticipate that I would be spending over $35 ($10 tip) for pizza and wings.  Remember, the salad was provided to me for free.  Too bad that I wasn't impressed with this place, I would have loved to find a nice neighborhood pizza joint, but I will stick to North End or Verrazano Pizza.

One thing I need to really point out, the staff was extremely friendly.",GXanDpgw2di3TrpYv3y0_Q,2,0,2,pgBo3Sd8HvJdPKSzoaUXug

""Hurt so good. C'mon baby make it hurt so good""
This lyric is oft whimpered in the darkest crevices of Vegas' eternal night life.
Here, I proudly sing it with the speech impediment that comes with a painful case of pizza-mouth. Every little twinge from the gentle roof tissue burn reminds me of how it got this way.

To be clear, the small round pie I had was 4 star quality but I believe this pie will scale well to a large. There is no tip-sag at all (that's what she said!) on the small pie despite it having a little too much sauce and cheese. The big brother pie should be just about perfect.

The small square I took to eat later was one of the best silicians I've ever stuffed into my face. It's hefty crispy undercarriage ripping even more flesh from my maw. Do it to me baby.. (my safe word is pepperoni )",6zZPfuZkDRzSkYY9EvVJ5A,1,1,5,kfONhZwG58FX-6jNmnSPlQ

Appetizer: Antipasto. The antipasto is pretty good. All in all I would have liked a bit more meat options and maybe a few more cheeses. The prosciutto tasted a little old but mixed with the saltiness of the olives and the cheese you couldn't tell.

Dinner: Artichoke Pizza, Bianca Pizza and Chicken Sandwich. My boyfriend and I split the Bianca pizza and he ordered the chicken sandwich. The Bianca is a white pizza with no sauce. I thought it was mighty tasty. Who can say no to Ricotta, cheese, garlic and EVOO on a thin crust? Not this girl! I thought it was good until I tried our friends pizza. The artichoke pizza comes with sauce and that made all the difference. Their pizza was even better than ours! My boyfriend said the sandwich was good but had a bit too much pesto and cheese on it. Other than that it wasn't bad. 

The decor is nice. Sports bar feel with a little bit of luxury involved. Their wait staff is clearly trained to upsell but they aren't too pushy so don't be afraid to pass. Next time I think we will try a red pizza and possibly the meatballs!",LEXKyVpF1Utm6eJOsQIz8A,0,0,4,TTfTIM_pWz9kMr8kWNEmCQ

Before I get to the pizza, there are a few appetizers that also deserve praise. The Golden Calamari is wonderful. The breading is light, but crispy, and the squid is cooked exceptionally well. Also, Gram's Meatballs are some of the best meatballs I've ever had. The combination of the pork, the beef, and the veal, makes for an amazing flavor combination, and the tenderness is perfect.

THE PIZZA: The only way this pizza could be any better is if they fed it to me. The pizza at Dom DeMarco's is AMAZING. I have never once been disappointed. They have two different styles of crust, New York Style Thin and Square Cut Thick. Personally, I think the thick crust is better, but to each their own! My absolute favorite pizza is The Di Fara Special. Fresh basil, pepperoni, two different types of cheese, it's so simple, and yet it's so fucking delicious! The best part, is that the pizza is huge! It could easily feed a family of four and potentially have leftovers. Dom DeMarco's also does carry out if you feel like staying in for the evening.

Both the New York style thin crust and the Sicilian style, square cut, thick crust  pizzas are delicious, but the Sicilian can be too greasy and the NY style can be overcooked at times. On our first visit they gave us one that was completely burnt and we were surprised that they let it leave the kitchen like that. Where's the quality control?

When cooked properly, the pies here will make you forget about any other pizza joint in town with a crispy, yet chewy crust that can hold it's own under the weight of quality meats and cheeses and an amazing sauce. If you want a white pizza, the white truffle pizza is sure to satisfy and leave you craving for more.

Their menu may not be huge, but it's well focused and features plenty of great bites. Gram's Meatballs are a combo of pork, beef, and veal that you can get as sliders (on a brioche roll) or lollipops (served in a bed of marinara with toothpicks). The eggplant pizzettes shouldn't be missed. They're breaded slices of eggplant topped with ricotta, parmesan, basil and tomato sauce. The BLT salad (butter leaf lettuce, avocado, cherry tomatoes, bacon, gorgonzola dressing) was good but overdressed.

The desserts we've tried don't quite match the same level of deliciousness as the savory items. The house made tiramisu, served in a tumbler, was heavy on the cream and light on the biscuits. The chocolate cake, not made in house, is rich and dense and the perfect dessert if you're craving a chocolate overdose. It's great to share with two or three people.

The decor is modern chic. Lots of dark tones. It may not be the best place to take kids, but if they're well behaved, go for it. The open setting makes it loud enough to drown out any shrieks your kid might let out. There's no kid's menu, but they'll be happy to make a cheese pizza without the basil for the little ones.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,5,4,DrBLvcqyEU_Q_LKjAj7z0w

Next we ordered a large pepperoni pizza.  It took a long time for the pizza to come to our table.  The pizza turned out to be better than average with a tasty crust and good quality cheese and pepperoni.  The tomato sauce was also tasty but a little too chunky with huge pieces of canned tomatoes in the sauce.  We ordered a large pizza and it was way too much for two people.

We were also eyeing the Di Fara, advertising their ""Legendary"" status, so we went with that as well. We chose the New York style for both. The service was great and the pizza guy personally delivered our pizzas to us, and even served us our first slices which was a very nice gesture.

You know how you first taste something and you have that moment of silence, and your eyes roll to the back of your head like the Exorcist because its SO DAMN GOOD?
I didn't have that moment in any of our pizzas. Not the White, not the Truffle, and Not the legendary Di Fara....TASTE is everything, and what we tasted was an overkill on garlic...You can never have too much garlic, right? that's what I thought, but it got so overbearing, we wanted to like the White/Truffle pizza, but it turned out to be disappointing.The Di Fara was okay, but nothing legendary about it IMO, and I'm not such a fan of the pepperoni used here(personal preference)

They didn't have a menu online so I called and asked for a recommendation. I was convinced on the Big Apple which was as described by the hostess as a meat lover's counterpart. I thought the prices were a bit steep $17 for a small (12 inch) and $25 for a large (18 inch), not used to paying a premium for pizza, but why not. 

Order was ready in the 25 minutes as promised, AND they even called to let me know the pizza is almost done. You could use this to your advantage by not even leaving your house until they call you, if you live close by anyways. 

The pizza came in a completely plain white box, but had a mysterious aphrodisiac aura. The aroma coming out of the box into my car caused my neurotransmitters to release endorphins throughout my entire body... yup food porn at its best. I don't know what kind of biological beast the Big Apple was, but it honestly told every meat lover's I ever had to GTFO or that it was not worthy, or maybe it told me I  wasn't worthy of its crispy crust and delicious carnivorous toppings. Either way, definitely worth a try, price is not too bad if you're splitting with a few friends. 


Notes:

- They need a menu online. 
- The Big Apple is one of the most expensive pizza on their menu so the price does not accurately portray their entire menu. Large pizzas really range from 20-26 for their New York Style and 27-30 for their full square cut. 
- Appetizers, pasta, sandwiches, and salads should be expected to be on the menu.

I don't even really like pizza.  But I LOVED this pizza.  I'd heard about this place, what with the POTUS getting VIP delivery and all, and was pretty intrigued.  What's so great about a pizza place?  Well, let me tell you!  The...red...sauce.  Seriously.  It's probably the tastiest sauce I've tried.  We had some on the eggplant appetizer (tasty and perfectly fried) and on the Big Apple pizza.  Read on, pizza lovers, and try not salivate!

- Big Apple pizza: red sauce with all sorts of meat.  The sausage is a-ma-zing.  I picked all of it off and my husband got really mad at me.  Hehehehe.

- White Truffle pizza: I love me some mushrooms.  But I must admit this pie was a bit bland.  I really had to pile on the red pepper.

- Bianca pizza: The cheesiness is heavenly.  The zing and flavor of all the different cheeses is melodious.  And greasy as all get out, but worth it.

- I don't drink beer, but a pint of PBR was $3.  I think that's pretty cheap, right?  My glass of a delicious New Zealand Sauv Blanc was only $7.  Yeah, SEVEN.

All in all, for four people, we ordered the eggplant app, and 2 large pizzas...and still had about 6 slices left over!!  My advice: if you go with 4 people, one large pizza and a salad should do the trick (I saw many a salad pass by; they're pretty big).

Returning for sure.  Do you think they will just give me a bowl of red sauce to slurp up like tomato soup if I asked?",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,0,0,4,U-w6YtLcnvUn-R3Dr7Wfuw

We came in a group of 8 on a Saturday night and had a short wait for how busy the restaurant was. We went to the bar and they offered samples of the wine to help us choose. 
I ended up enjoying the Magician- a red by the glass. 
A couple in the group thoroughly enjoyed the Prisoner by the bottle from Napa Valley. 

We enjoyed the 15th street BTL salad which was very flavorful and much larger than I expected. Plenty to split between two people. 

We ordered the big apple. They cautioned us that the extra large was only 8 slices so we ordered two. This pizza was huge! It also was incredible. It is a meat pizza with fresh basil. The fresh herb really added depth to the dish. We all were quite happy with our selection. Three slices were enough for the men of our group and the ladies ate 1-1.5 slices. 

Following our meal the executive chef came out and spoke to us for over 20 minutes. He was happy to discuss a possible cooking class. He was excited one of our group wanted to learn from him. Very kind.",nsHB3PSgkXLRGpg_nkMrdA,1,1,5,Oy1LmeROOQoZutxH2IBtDA

Firstly Obama ate here at some point in the past, everyone apparently knows that so consider yourself educated :) So this is the only other restaurant from a famous New York Pizza chain. It should be spectacular right? right?

Sadly no, I got thick crust pizza the ""legendary"" one. It was not great. Well, the crust itself was not great, the stuff on it (approx. 15% total pizza volume) was excellent. The crust was flavorless and spongy, like an angelfood cake. No thanks. The pepperoni, cheeses and sauce were excellent.

Also the service: I was drinking beer, because beer is delicious and everyone should always be doing this, and somehow this was a problem. We had a party of 10 and the soda drinkers were regularly refilled by a gentleman who had me understand that as a minor in our United States he could not bring me a beer. However our overage server was far more rare and apparently had a variety of macular degeneration that kept him from noticing an empty pint glass. When it did get refilled I asked for a ""Deschutes Porter"" and got a Mirror Pond. This is a bit like requesting ""Big Momma's House 3"" from Redbox and getting ""The History of the Ku Klux Klan"".

Also we had reservations for 9+3 small children. They sat us at a pub table. Lucky we have good kids who don't need strapped in.

Beer list was pretty solid, pizza wasn't altogether terrible, and the place was swanky. I wish I liked it more.

Tips on having a good experience: Order a thin crust pizza regardless of regular order, don't bring your children, and when you run out of beer stand on your chair and say ""HEY CAN SOME MOTHER FUNSTER BRING ME A GODDAMN PORTER? THEY ARE BROWN AND COME FROM THE TAP LABELED ""PORTER""!",H7fr4A3OlKtDr-sNn8BIlw,11,3,2,VgQfeH5vnAwAbyGSpIOgQQ

Me and my BF sat at our table for AWHILE before a waitress (who was VERY grumpy!) acknowledged us and got us some sodas (which tasted flat). besides us, there was only one other table of four...

When they finally took our order, we got the antipasto, a small pizza, and the clam linguine.

It took forever for the antipasto to come out and our food came rate after it (I thought the point of an appetizer was to have it before your meal not with it....). my bf's pizza had a weird aftertaste and was really greasy. My linguine had no flavor, and overcooked clams that were rubbery PLUS I asked for the white sauce and got the red...

To add to all of this, we were seated by where they make the food and had to listen to a couple of employees gossip about some shit and the hostess just had a mean look on her face the whole time. Does nobody want to work here? or did we just come at a bad time? well we wont be back, that's for sure! Such a sad disappointment cause my bf has been wanting to eat here for awhile.

So for horrible service, an hour of our time, 2 sodas, antipasto, a small pizza and clam linguine we paid $60!! NOT WORTH IT!

Yes. We were there for an hour if not longer...

Dom DeMarco's is unassuming from the outside; located in a Summerlin strip mall.  But the interior is done in warm woods and cozy, comfortable booths.  There is also a terrific patio, which is large and comfortable.  Equipped with a 2-sided fireplace and heaters as well as a canopy to keep out the hot sun, so it's good in both cool and warm weather.  The bar Happy Hour specials are also good on the patio.

Chicken Wings with buffalo sauce and house made Bleu Cheese: $13.00 /10 wings.  These meaty wings are finished on the grill to give them a great crispy exterior.  Definitely some of my favorite wings in Vegas.

Di Fara Brooklyn style Sicilian pizza: $26.00.  This is by far my favorite square pizza in town.  It has hand cut pepperoni, mozzarella, grana padano cheese, and fresh basil.  The edges are also slightly charred, giving it a traditional taste.  The golden crust is so light and buttery and the sauce has such a great acidity.

I had the the white truffle pizza which was a little too heavy on garlic and cheese, but still tasty and slightly burned on the bottom which is always a good sign.

The most impressive thing about this place is the small wine list made up of mostly well-chosen wines at fair prices. 
They have a wine made by Bibi Graetz of Testamatta called Soffocone (which is Italian slang for blow-job, no kidding) that I've rarely seen on wine lists in town. Plus a Testamatta Vermintino by the glass and by the bottle which is quite nice. (Keep in mind it retails at good wine stores for about $10 or $12 a bottle and is $9 a glass here.)

I prefer a spicier sausage and perhaps one that is either cooked to order or has a higher fat content.  we also shared the chicken sandwich Inot my choice).  it was a heavily breaded boneless breast stuffed in a big loaf of bread.  it felt like a bowling ball in the stomach after eating half of it.  the second trip I tried the pizza.  we went with the house special.  a thick square pizza with hand cut pepperoni. it was good but I had huge expectations.  it was a little salty and a little under-cooked.  on some level it reminded me of BJ's thick crust pizza but that's a little too harsh a criticism.  i'll try it one more time before my final verdict.  service was good both visits and the beer is cold.

Yesterday on the way home from a play at UNLV, I had this place in mind for quick take out before going to the evening play for which we had tickets.

I had looked at the menu online and had already decided I'd get a square (thick crust) white pizza with some toppings I chose.  They've changed their menus and I ask the greeter if I could still get the white pizza.  She told me too different kinds I could get and I opted for the white truffle with mushrooms.

I agree with Nelson Q. that there was so much garlic that it hid the truffle flavor.  The pizza was very good nonetheless.  There was a lot of garlic and there were many mushrooms.  My only negative comment would be that some areas of the pizza were baked to a black crust rather than an evenly done one.

Service was pretty good.  I waited about 15 minutes for it to be ready.  The greeter asked me if I'd like some water while I was waiting--a nice touch.

I almost wished that my wife was with me so we could have stayed there and eaten in their patio area with just enough shrubs and trees to make Hualapai Commons and the cars almost disappear.  Instead, I got my hands greasy and salty at the kitchen table. 

I also long for the menu at pizza places where you have the blank canvas and get your white pizza with toppings x, y, and z.  You can still do that some places but it seems to be a disappearing thing at the more upscale places.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,2,4,PuCGlY9K4F3I8QMNXzME5w

I applaud Dom DeMarco for participating but nothing really knocked our socks off.

No.  Would I recommend they stop by for pizza?  Hell yea, especially after 10 when I guess you can call it happy hour til closing.

First course, fried calamari.  Served with marinara.  Enough for two people.

Second course, another appetizer I guess, half Mediterranean salad.  Salad with chickepeas, tomato, olives, peppers, and cheese.  Also enough for two people.

Third course, I had the Brooklyn chicken.  Breaded chicken served with spaghetti.  Enough for two people.

Fourth course was the vanilla panna cotta, this was good.  Most panna cottas are hit and miss.

So while portion control was excellent and my friends enjoyed their meal, they considered it a discount since all but the panna cotta is served on the regular menu.  Again, for restaurant week I would not recommend.  But their pizzas are good.

It was about 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and then almost 10 before we got our drinks (1 iced tea and a beer).  It was then another 10 before our order was taken. (The place was semi-busy but not slammed and I saw other servers just standing around at times) We started with the Eggplant Pizzette which were INCREDIBLE with tiny dollops of ricotta (4.5 stars).  We ordered the The Di Fara Special pizza (thin style).  The eggplant came within 20 minutes.  When we were finished a man came over and informed us that our pizza had looked over cooked so they started a new one (He looked to be the manager but never identified himself as such).  About  20 more minutes later the pizza was finally delivered to our table.  It was a great pizza-one of the best I have had in Vegas(4 stars) but given how long it took, it put a slight damper on the whole experience. ( It probably didn't help that the table next to us was seated with 3 very loud and pompous narcissistic  blow-hards that couldn't stop talking even long enough to eat their own food which seem to come out pretty quickly despite the fact that they were seated after us.) 

The manager came to check on us 3x which was good intentions-wise but did little else to make up for the long wait and he responded with a ""fantastic"" in each of our interactions as though he was on automated response.  Almost 2 hours later we left with our bill-our waitress notified us that the manager had graciously removed the price of my iced tea (REALLY???).  Our waitress was very personable.

The decor and atmosphere are really nice-loved the outdoor patio- the music was a bit loud which made it hard to talk  at times.

Server/Rich was very attentive, and open to casual talk that made our experience feel like it ""was not"" the first time we'd eaten there.

So far, I've only ordered the DiFara special, but I haven't seen anything on the menu yet to make me stray! The pizza is so so good. The crust is the highlight and it's delicious - thick, but not bready, and deliciously flavored with some type of garlic-y stuff. The pizza is topped with some more high-quality cheese and pepperoni (like you'd expect from a fancy pizza place), and everything works together wonderfully.
The location is not near me, but it's really cute with a little patio area that's shielded with plants and slightly below sidewalk level, so you're not staring at the parking lot. The bar/wine specials looked really good, and I bet it's a cool place to go for a happy hour drink.
Prices are higher, but totally worth it as the DiFara special fed 2 of us and we had leftovers for 3 days!",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,1,5,7aSxpNCbRD3EW4L997uWFw

I was a bit iffy about ordering a pie to go, but it wasn't for me so who cares right?  Who am I kidding? I know I'm going to have one regardless.

Of course i saw meatballs on the menu, and if you know me I'm a sucker for protein in all form and shape.  The bartender told me that they do not use bread crumbs in their recipes.  Even better, and man, were they worth it! Each bite were divine, and the marinara sauce was a great addition.  They give you plenty.  I had enough sauce to make sure each bite was coated for maximum decomposition.  Heck, it was even a dipping sauce for my pizza crust! Zing! Choice of lollipop or in a bread roll.  

Our Big Apple Pizza aka meat lovers came NY style thin crust..  It had Ham, Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, and lots of Basil.  Sooo good that i wanted another slice, but fortunately for me it was all gone before i could do myself anymore harm.  The pie was a bit soggy in the middle, but i think it was due to all the hearty toppings.  Then again it could have been more mushy if it wasn't for the  neo mesh (aka honeycomb) underneath the pizza.  The mat helps fend off the condensation, so our happy pizza kept us happy.  Kudos to Dom DeMarco's for being thoughtful.

While waiting for my order i had a good convo with the bartender.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and even gave me a little extra 411 about the place.  Like how they use ingredients imported from Italy, and how they use a water filtration system that mimic the water in NY.  Just some of the measure they use to mirror their pizza in NY which happen to be voted #1 by Zagat. 

Verdict: My new Pizza Spot!",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,8,6,4,MgKRur4QbtUvHX7Nbb-4PA
4057767,2012-07-12,10,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Now that I have had Dom DeMarco's a few times, I think I can give it a complete review.  I am not a fan of thick pizza.  It's doughy and unpleasant and I just do not enjoy it as a general rule.  Fortunately, Dom DeMarco's has a solution for those friends who cannot agree on a crust: Two styles of crust!  One is a Regular crust (New York thin) and one is Square crust (thick and cooked in a cast iron pan).

Despite my aversion to thick pizza, Dom DeMarco's really does it right.  My friends insisted we try one of each, so we got the Big Apple in Square and the Di Fara Special in Regular.  Both were really awesome.  Naturally, I loved the thin one best (Di Fara) but even I have to admit that this thick crust is good and the combo of meats on the Big Apple was out of this world.

The Eggplant pizzettes were money! Little, crunchy eggplant slices covered in parmesan and ricotta.  Yes, please.  Also enjoyed the Tomatoes & Burrata cheese appetizer.  Two criticisms: (1) we had an incredibly long wait due to the Cougar Den in the bar, but Dom DeMarco's is popular with a certain age group of women in Summerlin, so what are you going to do?  It's worth the wait; (2) that thick crust does not heat up well.  It was a grease ball the next day, so eat it while it's hot!",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,8,7,4,7cOD8Ar4AKu4TmbOMtyGeQ

We went on a Monday before just before 5pm and it was pretty slow. We could not get anyone to wait on us. Person sat after us got served right away. Had to ask to get service. Someone came and took our drink order. It  took some time to get someone to take our order after that. In fact we never knew who our actual server was. Took forever to get our food, table the was sat after us got their food and was gone before we got ours. We had pizza which was just okay and my daughter had a cheese calzone that was awful.  She couldn't eat it is was so bad. I tried it and it was not good. 

We never saw a server from the time we ordered until we had to ask for the bill. Never once asked for refills on drinks.

UberEATS is always super reliable with service and delivery so no surprise there. 
As far as the pizza, we splurged a bit and ordered the small mushroom and truffle which was about $20 (pretty much always expect to spend some cash anytime you read the word truffle, but my past experience tells me it's usually worth it), and the Margherita. Both were fantastic! The greens on the mushroom pizza were super fresh and I appreciated that the basil in the margherita was only slightly cooked. My boyfriend and I had different opinions on the crust; he thought it should have a little more salt and I thought it was perfect. Would I have loved more salt? Sure! But, it had that kind of seasoning that keeps you coming for bite after bite... which is exactly what I would want if I were the Chef!

I ordered the clam pizza and he ordered the arrabbiata pizza with added pepperoni and artichoke hearts.  I didn't know what to expect with the clam pizza but for some reason it just sounded so good to me.  When we got our ""small"" pizzas they were a lot larger than most small pizzas.  After a beer or 2 and appetizer we had about 4 slices leftover to take home.  The clam pizza was the first one I tried, after a light sprinkle of lemon I took a bite of it and it was the most amazing clam pizza I've ever had!  I love the dish linguini and clams so I would describe it as linguini and clams on a pizza.  I'm glad we ordered 1 pizza with the red arrabbiata sauce because going back and forth between a red sauce and white pizza was great contrast.  The clam pizza was so good and had so much flavor that it was nice to go to a pizza with more familiar favors.  I wouldn't call the arrabbiata and simple or plain pizza at all though.  The sauce had great flavor, the crust cooked perfectly and the toppings just added to the flavor.

4148751,2015-05-14,1,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Let me start by saying that I have been eating at Dom's regularly for over 3 years. The food is excellent but what I have noticed during my last 3 visits are the following.....

The portions are getting smaller. The drinks are getting skimpy. Durning a recent visit I ordered a $12 glass of wine, by husband ordered a scotch on the rocks. My glass had about 4oz of wine and my husband received a glass of ice and about 2oz of scotch. You've got to be kidding me  

Returned again over the weekend with a party of 12. Orders 2 full salads 3 appetizers 4 pizzas and 3 entries. Like I said before the food is excellent but the portions have gotten significantly smaller. Here is the kicker.. We were celebrating my sons bday. I informed our waiter of the occasion. At the end of our meal he brought out a cannoli with a candle. Very nice except he charged us for it. I found this to be very tacky. Our bill was well over $300 and an 18% gratuity added. (Which I have no problem with). Had our waiter not charged us for the cannoli I would have rounded up the tip to 20%.

4211703,2013-01-31,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Truly good pizzerias are like fine dining experiences for me.  I will gladly pay good money for the full experience of a marked up bottle of wine, an appetizer, a pizza pie, and if my server isn't trying bum rush me for camping out at their table, I will even order dessert and coffee.  And that is just what I did the other night in the company of my Vegas dining buddy/fellow foodie, my mom.

She's a regular here whereas I was a virgin.  I had heard about this place a year ago when President Obama was in town doing his campaigning bit.  Not only did the Element at 215 and Town Center get a shout out, but Dom DeMarco got some publicity since the prez ordered 12 pizzas plus a bunch of cannolis.  I wanted to check it out immediately.  But, our usual Friday night pizza is limited to Little Caesars thanks in part to my young children, who have underdeveloped taste buds and young tummies to withstand the heaping gas those $5 pizzas create.  Anytime I wanted to go outside of the Little Caesar spectrum, I got attitude.  That and Dom DeMarcos isn't exactly in my neighborhood, so out of sight, out of mind.  I would eventually get around to trying out Dom De Marco and I finally did.  I went crazy, out of my usual routine of Friday night pizza by having pizza on a Tuesday!  Ooh!  I was living dangerously and it was worth it!

We started off with the calamari.  It was breaded to perfection and tasty.  My only complaint is that shortly after we were noshing on the app, we got our main events.  It's a true pet peeve of my husband's and I can see why.  However, we did order everything at the same time and didn't specify space between courses.  I let it slide, despite the fact our 2 seat high-top ran out of room.  Somehow, the affable server and his runner made it work, piling up our food on the table.  Yes, all of that food was for just us two: my mom ordered linguine and clams AND a half Di Fara Special for me to try and I ordered the half Artichoke thin crust.  Let the games begin.

The Di Fara Special is their signature square cut thick crust pizza, topped with small, hand cut pepperoni, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I personally don't care for thick crust pizza, but I absolutely LOVED the taste of this crust.  It wasn't too doughy or dense.  The crust was golden crisp and just the right amount of thickness. The toppings were cooked to perfection and simple.  Quite often I find that simple is best.  

I dug into my thin crust artichoke delight and it too did not disappoint.  I love a good New York thin crust pizza and this one was perfect in terms of the crust and toppings which were basic red sauce, mozza, basil, grana pandano, EVOO and of course, a generous helping of artichoke hearts.  But not too generous as to overwhelm or weigh down the crust or drench it.  There is nothing worse than a thin crust drenched, leaving it soggy.  The crust was the perfect texture and gave me a good crisp once I bit into it.  With my pinot noir and my mom with her malbec, we enjoyed each bite of our food.

Having boxed up the remaining slices of our respective pies split two ways (she took some of my pizza, I took some of hers), mom and I decided to dare go there with dessert and coffee.  We each had a cup of the hyped ""Best Coffee in LA"" (still don't understand what that meant, even after I asked our sweet energetic server) and split a piece of the 7-layer carrot cake.  The carrot cake was topped with white chocolate shavings and decorated with pecans.  I need not say anything more except one word: OUTSTANDING.  Even the ""LA coffee"" didn't disappoint - smooth and dark and completely complimented our dessert.

To wrap up: Dom De Marco is a hit in my book and a new favorite.  I will definitely be back, bringing my husband for a date night and/or bringing some girlfriends for a girls night when we're all feeling the need for good pizza and vino.  Oh I will be back for sure.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,0,0,5,rjpJM6u5sdu-6e564D8GGg

4484605,2012-02-29,3,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Half a lifetime in Brooklyn, and I'd never heard of the famous old guy whose customers lined up to buy pizza for $5 a slice.  I read about him about a year ago, so when I learned that Dom DeMarco's was coming to Vegas, I was hot to try it.  What galvanized our visit to the restaurant last night was an impromptu firepit lawn party in my development:  one of our neighbors knows the owners, and had a couple of pies - round and square - for us to eat.  I got there late, natch, so all I was left with was a very cold Sicilian slice.  And I was blown away.

We were impressed with the restaurant's decor - modern, upscale, but the seating was uncomfortable for me.  Nice-looking fake leather webbed chairs and the upholstered booths had me sitting way too low for short little me, so I felt like a dog lapping out of a bowl.  (I did try one of the few straight-backed chairs before I left, just for comparison purposes, and they were fine; if we go back, I'll insist on that).  The patio, with its big, glass-covered patio, looked awesome, but it was too cold for it to be up and running.

Our waiter, Roberto, was completely unfriendly.  It's amazing how a friendly waiter can have an impact on my overall impression of a restaurant, and his demeanor definitely detracted.  In fact, I started a conversation in Spanish with a very friendly busboy, whose hometown in Mexico was my old home-away-from-home, and after a couple of minutes Roberto gave the busboy a curt and nasty signal that implied he needed to get his ass moving.  This kind of thing makes us feel like commodities, instead of valued customers.

Now for the food:  I've never been a fan of Sicilian (square) pizza but, because of the previous experience, we ordered half a square Bella Napoli, with tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and EVOO.  I have to say I didn't enjoy it as much as the cold one from the other night, which may have had sausage (it was too dark to see what was on it).  This pizza was grease personified, and with the tomatoes dripping all over the place, it needed to be eaten with a knife and fork which, to a Native New Yorker, is a complete sacrilege.  And $17 for half a Sicilian pie is pricey.  (Note to management:  sharper knives are needed!).  Still, it was good, but needed a bit of red pepper to liven up the flavor.

The little touches are nice - the water bottles that sit on the table, the heavy plates made in France, the modern pizza tower (though it didn't work for me in my sunken-down seat).  

If it weren't for the ambience, I'd be giving this three stars.  But since my credo is ""You CAN eat the atmosphere,"" I've bumped it to four.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,3,4,S1mBrdLHA3whFCFZDc0kVg

We were seated outside by the huge fireplace. It was beautiful spot with huge tables and comfy chairs. It's perfect for big group gatherings.

We started with Dom's Fries ($7.00) which came with garlic aioli. They were generous with the aioli which was nice because some places I've been to lately are stingy with it. They give you more than enough for your fries. We then shared a 15th St. BLT salad ($10.00). It had butter leaf lettuce, avocado, cherry tomatoes, bacon with Gorgonzola dressing. The dressing was a little too bitter for me but the salad was good.

We ordered the Di Fara pizza ($26.00) it is pretty huge especially for just 2 people. Let's just say we had more than enough left overs for work. The sauce was sweet and zingy ...tasty! It came with pepperoni, fresh and aged mozzarella, grana padano(  Italy's most popular hard cheese), fresh Basil and extra virgin olive oil. It was delicious!  Demarco's really takes their crust seriously! In order to get their pizza to taste just like their pizza in New York at Di Fara's in Brooklyn they use all the same ingredients.  The waiter said they even bring in water from New York for their recipes. This shows how much they are dedicated to their food.

Naturally, I was skeptical. First of all, everyone thinks their pizza place is the best one. Secondly, when anyone tells me a place has the best anything...I am extra critical because that's a very lofty claim to make.

So...our group was seated on the patio, which I thought was pretty cool. We weren't a huge group, but they still gave up the whole patio to ourselves. They have a huge fireplace out there which obviously wasn't lit because it's summer, but I imagine it would be really pretty in the winter months.

Our service was great. All of our drinks were refilled without us having to ask. Everything was brought to us with a smile and in a very timely manner.

So...was it the best pizza in Vegas?!?!

I would have to say...YES. Awesome crust. Fresh toppings that were well balanced. Great service.

Amongst the group we ordered 4 different pizzas to try...

1) The Bianca which is a white pizza with ricotta, garlic, basil...and it was just OUSTANDING. I could easily eat it everyday!! And, we got it on a thick crust which was phenominal.

2) The Margherita which was very basil-y...so I LOVED it. I would, also, go back just for this pizza.

3) The Big Apple which is sort of their answer to a meat lovers...ham, pepperoni, sausage, and I think meatball. I didn't really eat this one, but I did try a piece of the pepperoni itself which was great & there was none left over of this one so it was obviously good.

4) The White Truffle. This one had truffle oil, mushrooms, garlic...I am not a mushroom or a truffle oil fan so I skipped this one.

I, also, got a cannoli to go. And, it was fantastic.

This place will probably be our new pizza place...and I will probably start telling people it is the best pizza in Vegas.

We ordered a large with sausage, mushrooms, and spinach along with a Mediterranean salad. Loved he salad. But what I really enjoyed was the crust: thin and slightly chewy. I was told by the waitress that they used distilled water for drinking and making the dough. Perhaps that is the secret just like how Grimaldi's does it?

4525343,2012-02-01,2,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I've tried Dom Demarcos PIZZA twice now and am ready to give. My opinion.
First time I ordered a large square Pizza (Sicilian Style) with sausage. The Pizza had excellent taste and a great sauce. Could have had a touch more sauce and a lot more cheese for the thickness of the dough. There also could have been a little less olive oil in the dough, it was kind of greasy. I had ordered sausage on half of the pie. The sausage had good authentic taste, but there were hardly any pieces there, approximately 2 or 3 small turd style pieces per slice, just a teaser
I had also ordered 2 Cannoli.($6.00 Ea) They tasted as if they were made. from a store bought flavored mix, not fresh ricotta cheese, lemon and sugar, there were almost no chocolate chips or dried fruit like the real New York version. If you're going to charge $6.00 a pop for a cannoli, make real ones!

My second try at Dom Demarcos, I thought I 'd try the traditional Neapolitan round. I ordered an 18in. with Meatballs for pickup and a Calzone with sliced Ham.
The pizza looked and smelled Great! There was one thing missing! I ordered MEATBALLS NOT MUSHROOMS on my pizza! If they used maybe 3 whole mushrooms on the entire pizza that would have been a lot by their standards!
The pizza towards the center was rolled as thin as a tortilla, maybe because there weren't any Italians working in the kitchen.
The calzone was good, but again the dough was rolled as thin as a tortilla and a finger touch in the center poked a hole thrrough it.
The bottom line is, if you're going to charge premium prices for PIZZA use premium ingredients and premium quantities on your product!
I recommend that the owner should shop out competitors like METRO PIZZA, Biaggios,  and such and see what they offer at similar prices! 
You got the New York taste down, but You got to put more stuff on your pizza!
BTW way, I was born and raised in Astoria New York, My Grandparents were from Naples. I also have a 10 year culinary background as a Saucier and Sous Chef.

That article was in the ""Slice"" section of their website, and it was following the construction of the restaurant, which was set to open sometime soon. That article lit a fire inside of me. I scoured the deepest reaches of the internet for weeks (not really), pouring over hundreds (nope) of articles and reviews of Di Fara, the original (and famous) pizzeria opened by DeMarco Sr. in New York. I had to try this pizza! The SE article didn't say when DeMarco's would open, but I knew I would be ready! I wasn't. 

I forgot. I had never heard of Di Fara before reading that article since I don't live in/visit New York so it wasn't at the top of my food-priority list. Also, I didn't know exactly when it was supposed to open so I couldn't mark my calendar. Fast-forward to January. Somehow I was reminded of DeMarco's and instantly thought that I needed to try it. I was a bit mad at myself for forgetting, but I soon got over it. Now I was ready!

They have two styles of pizza - New York style thin crust and a square-cut thick crust pizza. A small of either serves two people. The first time I went, my girlfriend and I tried the Di Fara Special, which is the original. I had to see what all the fuss was about., right? I liked it. Their pepperoni is AMAZING. I'm more of the thin crust person, but the thick crust had great texture and flavors. The size of the large was more than enough for the two of us (it only comes in one size), and we had some tasty leftovers for the next day! 

I've also tried the thin crust with just pepperoni and two of the specialty pizzas - the Big Apple and the White Truffle. The thin crust was great. Nice and foldable, exactly how I like it. The White Truffle was a bit on the oily side, but it's pizza, and it was good.  I haven't had anything there that I didn't enjoy. The atmosphere is great, and they will even charge your dying phone at the bar!

I don't pretend to be a pizza expert or anything like that. I don't know what real New York pizza is supposed to be, but I know what I like. I like the pizza at DeMarco's.

We went pretty simple here and did just great. Yes, a Cheese Pizza for the table. It's pretty much your classic New York Style. Not super thin, but plenty easy to fold it over (if that's how you roll). The kitchen seems to enjoy making the food here: the pizza tasted effortlessly good. 

I went with a Caesar Salad (adding Chicken). It totally hit the spot. Naw, I didn't really pick up on the anchovy in the dressing, but I still liked it a lot. The Romaine was perfectly crisp with a nice ratio of green and light colored leaves. Not too much dressing. The chicken was plentiful and good; charred nicely from the grill. The chicken wasn't hot, it seemed prepped ahead of time. Still, it was good, solid breast meat. Someone at the table had the Caesar, as is, and was satisfied. A Caprese Salad looked really good - and the report from the other end of the table was 'YUM'. So there ya have it.

Thought about trying the cannoli, but really, we were happy and comfortably full.
Good service. Our waiter handled us just great, with a friendly confidence about everything they have at Dom's. Smallish wine by the glass selection, and nothing terribly unusual (Hess, et al).

The food was delicious! I highly recommend the clam linguini pasta if you want some light and zesty carbs. If you want something more healthier, the BLT salad was perfection--cold crispy butter lettuce, bacon, avocado, cherry tomatoes and bleu cheese. I personally loved their Cioppino (seafood stew). I can barely explain how good it is!  You really have to try it out if you are looking for a low carb zesty, savory seafood combo (fish, octopus, clams, squid). It also come with toasted garlic bread on the side for dipping.

Our drinks never got below mid glass.  The server, Joe, was always checking on us and noticed every time someone in our party arrived to get their drink order. BEST SERVICE EVER! Our food came out timely (especially for 15 people). What really inspired me to write this review was the integrity of the staff. After we left, I got a phone call from the manager Tony letting me know someone in my party dropped $200 and was holding it for us to retrieve.  My cousin Kim LOL.

I'm not a fan of black edge crust either, a dark golden brown is my own preference. They definitely spent a bunch remodeling it from the old Atlanta bread Company that was there.

Not sure what has happened to DDM.  Ownership and/or management has obviously changed and not for the better. Quantity and quality have diminished significantly.  

The Full Di Fara Special Pizza crust was not only thinner but the topping quantities were noticeably reduced.  But what can you expect for $30?

Considering what they charge, the salads are pathetically small.  A slightly larger than a side dinner salad is a mere $9.00.  But not to worry:  a very stingy extra side of dressing is only 50 cents.  And that's fair:  our total bill was only $146.00 before tip.

 the girls at the front door were very nice, flaky, but expected for young girls. 
We sat down opened one  menu,  it had two appetizer pages?   mistake no big deal.
We had clams salad large pizza small pizza and took a half a square pizza to go. The type of salad we ordered was supposed to be traditionally no lettuce but tomatoes cucumbers and a few other things all chopped up kind of together and vinaigrette it was good just came a little bit odd  from tradition. 
I had artichokes and added to the pizza, considering those are one of the heaviest items that is on a pizza they should have been arranged towards the back of the pizza because when you pick it up the tip is so heavy from the artichokes that were placed in the middle it was a slight inconvenience. Again not a big deal.
They were switching over salt and pepper shakers which was on a side station right next to our table so the rattling of those and the four five employees it took to do that was kind of a nuisance, could have done that in a back room or a table where no ones at, again not a big deal just minor details that to me are common sense.
 You don't annoy the only two people that are in there spending money. ( there were a few other tables but not in that area just us)
Our waiter was a bearded guy a little bit of a big guy,  he was very nice and very kind we needed a few things throughout our dinner experience and he seemed to be the only one busy,  the other for 5 employees like I said they were doing salt and pepper and walking around and when they seen our empty glasses turned a blind eye like they wouldn't even help him out. One young girl in a red shirt did help with refills one time.
 Also took tiramisu to go it was very very very very good dazzling homemade not frozen but for $9  I expect homemade.

I do know that the pizza is good.

My husband and I decided to try the Di Fara special, because the menu says it's legendary.  It's also expensive, and it's hard for me to pay a lot for pizza.  But the Di Fara is worth the price.

4844464,2012-05-10,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I totally broke my diet for this pizza, and it was worth it.  I went with the thin crust style (there's also ""square cut,"" which is thick) Bella Napoli.  This comes without cheese, so it's naturally vegan with no modifications.  (They currently do not have a vegan cheese option here.)  Now, usually, I'm not fond of the cheez-less pizza, but Dom's has sold me.  The toppings were high quality (garlic, spinach San Marzano tomatoes) and really brought enough flavor to the table that cheese (or cheez) was not missed.

A large pizza (split between two people) was enough to leave us both stuffed with leftovers for another meal.  And the true sign of a great pizza, it was still delish left over and cold right out of the fridge.  Maybe even better, as the garlic flavor had penetrated into the crust.  Best crust I've had in town definitely.  

We had good service, and the atmosphere is casual, but nice.  The place was full but managed to not be too noisy.  I wish I'd known there was patio seating, because it would have been a perfect night to sit outside.  Keep that in mind if the weather is nice.

Good beer list, including several drafts.  They also have entrees and salads and sandwiches; looked like a few of those could easily be made vegan with the removal of cheese.  You could also go for a make-your-own pie with your choice of toppings.  If you think you have a favorite pizza in LV, definitely challenge your choice with this place.

The high pitched tone was tolerable only because it came and went and only because of the other noise being created by people talking and the televisions.  Tolerable, but I prefer a more quiet venue.  The only HH pizza option was just cheese, so I opted for a small Di Fara special.  A personal smaller size of the Di Fara would be great.  The high pitched tone and overall loud atmosphere is a turn off for me.  If the noise level reduced and there were more HH food items I'd consider making this a place to frequent.  The HH menu seemed to focus on alcoholic beverages with only three of four food items on the 2 pm - 6 pm HH menu.  There are two Happy Hour time frames.  There is one that runs M-F 2pm - 6 pm and a second HH that runs M-F from 2 pm - 4 pm.  The 2-4 pm HH features 50% off any pizza, but I'm at work so I'll never be able to get there in time.  I rarely have seen a restaurant with two different happy hour time frames.  Guess it works for them.",Cfwvos6oFlDquGiI2Qy1gQ,0,0,3,D6pPYzihDvcjDHDVKT6MHQ

I wonder what they think about  DeMarcos in Vegas, which I think is supposed to be related to the famous DiFara's.  First of all let me say the wait staff at this place was great and they had Coke which I like.  I tried both types of crust with just cheese.  The thick short crust tasted like there might have been some rancid oil used and it had a burnt taste.  And the other New York style crust had very little watery sauce.  Imported tomatoes can be good but you have to do something about draining the liquid out or they will make the crust soggy.  Overall I would give this pizza a B-.  I am sure that DiFara's in New York is fantasic pizza, but this Vegas version didn't do it for me.  This pizza isn't even close to Metro or Grimaldi's. Nice atomosphere though and I am only about the pizza so they might have some other menu items to enjoy.  The Napoli crust was not good at all.

 They have Peroni Beer, which goes very well with this Pizza. You may have had better pizza somewhere else, but this is top notch stuff, and it is certainly competive with any other pizza you can think of.

We started off with the buffalo wings.  They were actually really good!  They came out hot and crispy and full of meat.  They don't skimp on quality here.  My partner actually got full from the appetizer so you're definitely getting your money's worth.

Finally our NY cheese pizza came out.  It looked exactly the same as the one in NYC and almost tasted as delicious.  I've been told that the water in NYC is the key ingredient to a real NY pizza, and I believe it.  Since I can't afford to go to NYC every week for my pizza craving, I'll definitely come here to fill the void.

Spaghetti factory in San Diego gives you twice as much food with a beverage, salad, a delicious bread, ice cream and 100% better service for 12.00!  Considering it only cost the restaurant pennies for spaghetti, I thought the $$$ would be for excellent service, nope.

We start with Garlic Knots and the Campari Tomato Burrata, which is basically their version of a caprese salad. Both were very tasty. The mozzarella was creamy so it was a nice change to the norm. 

For our entrees, I ordered the Fiocchci alla Vodka, and holy smokes it was amazing, and my bf got the Three Meat Lasagna, which he said was good too. My dish, at first glance at the description, I wasn't sure how it would taste with the pear, but let me just say that pear made all the difference.

Had the Di Fara (hope I spelled that right) pizza.  Big old square pizza cut into...squares.  It was freaking delicious.  I think their pizza sauce is the best I've had.  I have crazy sensitive taste buds and normally with pizza sauce I can taste something weird going on - usually with the aftertaste.  I think this sauce doesn't have that since it's made fresh.  It has a nice flavor and slight kick without being overpowering.  The sauce went well with the meatballs we had.

The Di Fara pizza was great.  Nice hand cut pepperoni that crisp up really well.  Also has cheese and some herbs.  Crust is nice and crispy on the outside but nice and soft in the insides.  Just a great crust.  Didn't have their thin New York style crust but can't imagine it's better than the thick crust.  Don't know how they got the crust so crisp without making it hard and annoying to eat.

Maybe I should get a pasta next time.  Came here with a group of friends as this was someone's recommendation of their favorite pizza place in summerlin.  Personally I like thin crust new York style pizzas and this place offers both NY and Sicilian style.

We were a pretty big group so had reservations on the beautiful patio outside.  The weather was perfect for dining al Fresca.  We started off with a bunch of appetizers....we might have ordered almost all the menu items.

Arranchini - 2 stars.  I'm not really a fan of this.  Comes with 3 big Arranchini balls in sauce but I thought it lacked flavor

Calamari - 5 stars.  Was really delicious but fried calamari is inherently delicious.

Mediterranean salad - 3. stars.  Wished it had more cucumbers and feta cheese.  Didn't really feel too Mediterranean for me...more like a standard salad.  I did like the dressing though

House salad - 2 stars.  Literally just spring mix with cherry tomatoes.  Nothing special.

Antipasti - 2 stars.  Not a big fan of the meat and cheese selection that came with the platter.  It came with prosciutto and salami but not sure what kind of cheese came with the platter.  I wouldn't order this again.

The special caprese salad with fried mozzarella 1 star.  The mozzarella was fried in a super thick slice so the cheese was still firm on the inside but a crispy fried outer crust.  Fresh mozzarella would have been so much more delicious.  Frying it made it seem like the cheese was hard and stale.  

Meatballs - 3 stars.  Standard

Chicken wings - 3 stars - a little dry and on the small side.  Not as juicy as I hoped it would be.  I did like the bbq and buffalo flavor though.

Special Pizza Sicilian style with pepperoni and basil - 3 stars.  The pizza was good but I didn't feel like it was super special or signature to DeMarco's.  

Mushroom White Truffle Pizza - 0 STARS.
This was actually inedible to me.  DO Not ORDER THIS!!  It sounds delicious but unless you can drink truffle oil straight up, you will not like this.  It looked so wonderful and delicious but I took one bite and felt nauseous.  The truffle oil sucker punches you in the face!  You can't taste anything else.  I only took a bite and took the rest of my slice home.  I tried to eat it the next day and after a bite I had to throw it away.  TOO MUCH truffle oil.  A drizzle is enough!  If you want to try it maybe request the truffle oil on the side and drizzle it yourself.

We started off with a burrata caprese. I love that slightly boogery cheese and theirs is good. Plus that the tomatoes are small cherry tomatoes that have been roasted. 

For pizza, we got half the Big Apple. You can get either NY style thin round or a square which is a bit thicker like a pan pizza (not quite as thick as deepdish). We got the square and it was a crispy delicious crust. I love that the meats had a light sear but that the sausage slices got crispy good. My problem with most thicker pizzas is not enough sauce and their ratio was ideal and the marinara is solid. I'm a sucker for fresh basil and I love that they put ribbons of that on top. 

Service was constant, but unobtrusive. We were checked on, drinks filled and boxes and check didn't need to be asked for, but given when we looked done. 

I didn't know about this place and it was super delicious pizza. Definitely a contender for some of the best za in town. I didn't realize this place was affiliated with Di Fara's pizza which is pretty good stuff I've made the trek to Brooklyn for once.

This place was not good, and actually, it was borderline terrible when you consider the prices they charge. I'm willing to pay for a product when there is value and quality that justifies the pice. Dom DeMarco's does not justify the cost that one pays to eat here. Everything was overpriced form their french fries, to their baby cow meatballs to their pizza. The sicilian was terrible. It was greasy spongy, and only semi thick dough. I will speak on behalf of my fellow Sicilian descendants to say that this was no Sicilian pizza. This place bugs me slightly more than the pretentious pizzerias like Due Forni and those styled ""pizzerias"" because I can actually sort of enjoy the pizza at those uppity places. 

The service was even rough here. We had to beg and repeat asking for everything we needed. But the servers were actually friendly and pleasant people, just slow as molasses. I don't even know why I'm not giving this place a 1 star, it's probably because I'm too nice of a person by nature.

Dom DeMarco's has been bookmarked for ages....
And...PTL -- decent enough that we will come back. 
meatball app -- good, above average good even. but 3 per order @$12 for the app...weeee bit steep. (gouge gouge, (shame) gouge)
pizza (small, round @$12) - get this...cheese, marina...and basil. ta-da! simple. good. 
the round pizza here is just a tad bit thick. the crusty edges was brushed with olive oil or infused olive oil - nice touch. next time we order pizza we will have to remember to order extra crispy....
because the pizzas were not individuals and not inexpensive -- we shared, which was plenty for early afternoon snack for two.
but i do have my eye on the mushroom, truffle number i saw on the menu. 

AAAAAANNNNDDDD.....bonus extra extra gold stars - they allowed your fur babies on the patio. two other tables had doggies hanging out the afternoon we dined out. we did ask for a plastic bowl for water and then again another plastic bowl for the meatball to share.

When I arrived after waiting the manager Tom came up and said they gave my order to someone else by accident. He then said it would take 20 min to remake the order and I could wait. At this point I had already paid. I waited for longer than 20 minutes and when I asked about my order the manager was rude and did nothing to apologize or fix the mistake.  I sat at an open table and continued to wait when he then came up and asked me to move so someone could sit at the table. Finally after a wait of over 35 minutes the hostess checked and brought me my order which was wrong again. The service was horrible and the manager Tom should really treat his patrons better.

One other oddity that was quickly corrected: We ordered a pizza half with two toppings and the other half with a different two toppings, and when the bill came, we were charged the full prize for 4 toppings.

I can say, Gram's meatballs (served as sliders) were a VERY nice surprise. YUM. Perfect slider bread, delicious meatballs, although I wish they had more cheese (but then I'm always wanting more cheese..).

First of all, if you hear that this place is a pizza joint, it is NOT. It's a sit down restaurant, while it features pizza, it's more of an Italian restaurant, than it is even close to a pizza joint.

They do not sell pizza by the slice, although the small isn't that big (perfect for two). I was born and raised in NY and I'm a pizza snob. The pizza was NOT NY style. Thin, yes, but not what a true NY'er expects when ordering NY pizza. This was crazy to me since the owner's dad owns a place in Brooklyn.  The crust was HARD, too hard. I recently got a crown, and was afraid to chew on that side of my mouth for fear of breaking the crown, that's how hard the crust was.  I ordered half cheese and half pepperoni, and it came with green leafy crap on it. I challenge you to walk into a real NY pizza joint and find green leafy crap on the pie.

Three positives to the place is 1 - it's a pretty nice restaurant, good ambience, and energy. 2 - it's got a pretty extensive menu. Apps, salads, sandwiches (gourmet fancy ones, not subs), pasta dishes, and of course pizza. 3 - The service is outstanding.

My date had the grilled chicken sandwich (minus the bread), and immediately had to brush his teeth upon getting home to get the taste out of his mouth. I didn't bother asking what was wrong, as it didn't look or smell appetizing.

Anyway, Eww somes it up pretty well.",yMNgkWt2Z2-GhyU9_I5j1w,5,1,2,kaGQrCGobtvb-cMYLlvFdg

The pizzas are laminated in greasy shredded mozzarella from Sysco (that's the country's largest food distributor, not a town in Italy).  The salads are made with garbage Sysco produce -- mealy tomatoes, flavorless mixed greens, asparagus that resembled bamboo.  Truly appalling for a restaurant that claims to know what it's doing with food.  It's insulting, frankly.

From the moment you walk in the door, there's terrible, ignorant service.  (Where do they find these people?  In Las Vegas, where there are plenty of servers with tons of solid experience, we had an incompetent waiter who couldn't answer any of our questions about the ingredients on the menu.

The fries tasted good albeit being kind of limp. I like thick crispy fries so maybe this is a personal preference. The pizza was a small size yet I was already full after two slices. The first slice tasted great but as I ate the second slice my experience diminished. They generously sprinkled the whole pie with a lot of basil leaves and I really enjoyed that.

Having experienced the magic of DiFara's in Brooklyn and watching Dom DeMarco at work in his tiny pizzeria I was admittedly a bit skeptical walking into the Vegas interpretation of the great Pizzaiolo's vision - not only would the master not be there watching over each and every pie, but I worried that the larger restaurant and expanded menu would compromise the quality of the meal; all of these concerns proving unfounded when I met a group of three Vegas diners to explore a varied swath of the relatively new brunch menu.  Treated first with a bag of zeppoles served with raspberry sauce and progressing through two savories and two sweets before moving onto one of the iconic pies the first thing to strike me was how well everything was prepared - the scrambled eggs springy and the poached eggs runny with vegetables nicely prepared and plenty of cheese while both the baked pancake and French Toast were fluffy and sweet with top quality fruit and ample, but not overwhelming amounts of pure maple syrup.  Impossible to decide between the square or the round crust based on quality as both were excellent in Brooklyn our eventual decision was based entirely on the fact that the square pie is only available in a large size and although perhaps not as well seasoned in terms of the bright acidity of the tomatoes or robust herbal notes of the basil the crust at DeMarco's was every bit that of the version at DiFara's, lightly raised and golden with a light crumb and pleasant yeasty notes serving as a backdrop to ample cheese - undoubtedly a contender for the best pizza I've found in Las Vegas.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,0,1,5,Ghw4v0nglf6INh3hIP44fg

Dom DeMarco's actually has the recipe to DiFara's pizza, consistently rated best of Brooklyn, and it was such a treat to have a Brooklyn favorite right here in Vegas.

We went on a Sunday evening and were seated right away. The waitress was nice. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, eggplant pizzettes, med salad and a margerita pizza. 

It took a while for the sangria to come out. It was the worst sangria I have ever had in my life. It tasted like soda water. It was so bad we could not drink it. I asked the manager to please bring a new one. 

While we were waiting, they brought out all of our food at one time. Uh--are you trying to get rid of us? We wanted to enjoy our appetizers first and have a drink. Oh well. The eggplant pizzettes were fine. Nothing special. Tasted like fried eggplant. The salad was good.

We finally got the other pitcher of sangria, no change still awful. What a bummer. Our exciting little night out turned into a bad choice. We had them take away the sangria since we could not drink it.

The pizza was not cooked all the way. It was very doughy and had like no cheese on it. While we were trying to eat this meal, there was a guy under our table wiping up water that was leaking out of the coffee pot station. So much for the relaxing dinner.

It didn't remind me of New York style crust at all as they claim on the menu.
 The staff and service was nice and helpful. The restaurant itself is really nice too.
I've been wanting to try this place for a while, so I've gotten it out of my system and I can focus on other pizza joints I haven't tried yet.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,3,3,3,5Iifrv07aP14pVdFBD5KZw

We're a pizza and pasta family. We don't eat just pizza or just pasta. We like to eat them together. The pizza's are very good and at the same time the pasta is excellent. 

Tonight for apps we had two, our pizza was 'The Di Fara Special' --A square, red pie with hand-cut pepperoni, fresh & aged mozzarella, grana padano, fresh basil, EVOO - a NYC legend *Served Brooklyn Style, edges are chared.  

And we had Zuppa de clams, --Little neck clams sautéed in EVOO & garlic with choice of a spicy red or white wine broth, topped with grilled crostini & finished with Italian parsley.

My husband got the Brooklyn chicken, Lightly pounded chicken coated in seasoned bread crumbs then fried & topped with roasted peppers, San Marzano tomato sauce & melted mozzarella.

I had a special, seven cheese ravioli with crab meat, it was good, large pieces of crab, creamy sauce, large ravioli.

5503492,2018-06-13,3,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Back story first..........About 7 years ago, on Father's Day, I had the chance to go to Di Fara in Brooklyn.  We ordered 2 pizzas, a thin, and a Sicilian, and the old man himself made both of those pies with love.  Those 2 pizzas were some of the best pizzas I have ever had...still to this day!  They were great.  

Fast forward to present day, and on our way out of Vegas, on my actual 40th Birthday (June 11th for those of you who are keeping tabs ;-) lol!), I wanted to try and relive some of the magic, and get some pizza from Dom DeMarco's.  I had read about this place for years now, and told myself that the next time I was in Vegas, I was coming here.  And that we did..........

We arrived around 11:45 and there were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  We were greeted and told to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a table and our waitress came by soon after to get our drink orders.  Coke products.  I had previously browsed the menu, so I knew what I was getting.  We went with a small round ""Di Fara Special"", and we went with a half Sicilian, plain cheese.  Took about 20 minutes or so and our pizzas arrived.  Here is how they were..................

Small Di Fara Special-  Right when it was set down in front of me, I knew immediately it was not going to be as good as I had hoped for.  I prayed it would at least be in the same sport (forget the same ballpark) as Di Fara in Brooklyn, but sadly it was not.  The cheese was a little bit greasy, the pepperoni was a little bit skimp, the basil wasn't plentiful like at Di Fara and the crust just didn't look that great.  I put a slice on my wifes plate, and one on mine, and we dug in.  We both kind of looked at each other.  Meh!  So damn sad!  The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni tasted ok...it wasn't straight up nasty, but it couldn't hold a candle to the OG.  The worst part of the pizza was the crust.  I examined the crust and the bottom and could see little blistered bubbles (which usually signifies a good crust on a pizza), but the texture of it was way off.  It had no chew.  You would bite in, and it felt like you were almost eating raw flour.  No freaking chew, at all!  It was some of the worst crust I have ever experienced on a pizza, and that's even compared to like a $5.00 Hot and Ready from Little Ceasars.  Seriously....the crust and dough killed this pizza.  So disappointed!  

Half Sicilian Cheese-  This pizza fared a little bit better, but even then, nothing compared to the original in Brooklyn.  This pizza was incredibly light and airy, but a little bit too oily.  I wasn't a big fan of the texture of this crust, either.  It was 1000000 times better than the thin, but even then, something was a little bit ""off"".  I ate 2 slices and didn't want to eat anymore.  I did reheat this the next day, and it was slightly better, but nothing to write home about.  Disappointed in this one, too.

The only saving grace for this meal was our server.  She was super nice and friendly, and on top of everything.  My wife mentioned it was my birthday in passing, and our waitress said that they did free cannolis for your birthday and asked if we wanted some.   Yes, yes maam!   The cannolis were by far the best part of the meal!  They serve you 2 little cannolis which were stuffed with the rich filing, accompanied by a couple of raspberries.  They were delicious!  Perfect crunch/crisp on the pastry shell, and the filling of the cannoli was rich and sweet!  Damn fine cannoli!  At least they do dessert right, here.

Overall, I was extremely saddened and disappointed.  I think I may have hyped it up too much in my head that it may taste even remotely similar to the old mans shop in Brooklyn.  It didn't come close.  I would disassociate myself with this restaurant if I were him...seriously.  Night and day as far as quality and taste.  The service was awesome though, and those cannolis saved this review from being worse than it was.  I would sadly never come back here.  There are infinite number of better pizza places out there. Super bummed :-(.",6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,7,4,2,MtL9P7UKOBk7XNm66BJqkg

I've ordered the Big Apple pizza and it's pretty dang good.  Brick oven pizza is amazing and the quality is superb here.  It doesn't take too long to make either since the crust is so thin.

Thanks to My T. and others for such great reviews.  That made this a no brainer after cashing in some bet tickets at Red Rock.  

We started with the eggplant pizzettes which were 3 discs of breaded, fried goodness topped with pamesan, ricotta cheese and tomato sauce.  These were delicious even though $9 for 3 pieces seemed a little steep but not a big deal.  

Mediterranean salad was good enough for 4 people and was full of olives, olives, olives.  We felt it necessary to down a few more veggies before the pizza came out.

I never made it to Di Fara's in Brooklyn, NY but thankfully Mr. Demarco gives us a taste of what we've been missing out on.  WOW.  We went with the Quattro Formaggio with mozzarella, provolone, romano, white cheese and tomato sauce and it knocked my face off.  The crust was perfect.

 The round New York style truffle pizza was very good and the meatball appetizer lollipop style was amazing.  Their tomato sauce is very good.  However, the square di faro special was really nothing special.  Like another reviewer stated, it's just pizza on a thick focaccia bread.  Although I paid $6 extra to add sausage, meatballs, and garlic, the toppings on the pizza were sparse.  Every bite should have at least one topping on it and this pizza did not.  To make matters worse, we were seated at a dirty table.  When I requested a knife, I was given a very dirty one with dried sauce all over.  Grimaldi's is still my first choice for pizza.",UcmjgcFV2wTwoNAQTSfffw,7,1,2,1CU9tM61XqFI0BrGZQAEMw
5736757,2012-03-31,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Ok so let me start out by saying that I've been to Di Fara in Brooklyn and it is life changed pizza. Seriously, you haven't tasted anything like it before, guaranteed. I was through the roof excited to hear of Dom DeMarco's, so I dropped everything to dine here with some friends and family immediately. 

It is an upscale looking restaurant with a bar area and a dining room that opens up to patio seating. It can get quite loud inside and the chairs are seriously giant, but overall has a really great feel to it. I loved the giant pictures of Vespa's on the wall and that they leave you a bottle of water on the table, very Italian touches. Our server was good, not great and definitely not overly available. 

We started with calamari, eggplant pizzettes, and the SOHO salad. The calamari smelled great, but I don't eat calamari. I tried a bite of the eggplant, but again I am not an eggplant fan so was not impressed. Everyone at the table really enjoyed them though. I thought the salad was good, a mixture of lettuce, asparagus, green beans, fennel, fontina, and a light truffle vinaigrette. I would have liked a little more flavor from the vinaigrette, but it was a fun mixture of ingredients overall.

We decided to go with the legendary Di Fara Special pizza. Now, the pizza they serve in Brooklyn is of course thin crust, so please tell me why this pizza has a thick crust! It was good, although the pepperoni was seriously lacking in flavor and the cheese pulled off the pizza with every bite, but it wasn't necessarily a bad pizza. I enjoyed the flavor of the olive oil and the crust (and I am not generally a crust person). But, if you are going to have a Di Fara special pizza it would have to be a thin crust simple pizza, just like you would get in Brooklyn! 

I do wish I had gotten the opportunity to sample the NY style thin crust pizza, maybe next time. I found this place a bit pricey and a little lackluster. We definitely have better options in Vegas.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,1,1,3,hWJYXpa5ltv1jnopUiGROw
5737988,2012-01-11,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Dropped in with some friends who were wowed by this place and wanted to take us there. Arrived early, per recommendation, and they were not kidding. By 5:30 this place was jammed and lines out the door. First, the ambience is very nice for a pizza joint. Very upscale decor. The only down side of this is that the prices are high for a pizza joint too. The house red was wonderful, but I thought $22 for a half carafe was a bit spendy. We had the Mediteranean chop salad and that was tasty. But $13. for a side salad seems excessive considering the menu. Server, Colleen, was not only gorgeous but gracious and helpful. We had the Sicilian Big Apple and enjoyed it....though it wasn't the best pizza I have ever had. They seemed a tad skimpy on the cheese too. All and all a good experience at a not so cheap price. Go, but be prepared to dump a few bucks at this joint. Looks like the rest of Summerlin will keep it humming.",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,1,0,4,9r5varh1MDqUG1UzjykS5A
5748854,2012-02-02,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"Compares favorably to Grimaldi's.  This is an upscale restaurant that features good atmosphere and great pizza.  I started with the eggplant pizzettes.  They were crispy but not oily.  Good app.  I had a large New York style Big Apple pizza.  It had good crust, but could have used about another minute in the oven to crisp the bottom just a bit more.  I love truffles so I also ordered a square White Truffle pizza.  It could have used another handful of mushrooms, but overall, I loved the flavor.  Some may say the crust was too oily, but I like it that way.  I usually hate square pizzas, but I will order this one every time I come here.  

If you are looking for a bargain, you won't find it here.  The prices are not low, but the quality is high.  Drinks are expensive, so come during happy hour if you are going to have a few.  

The reason for a one star deduction is the service.  The service was terrible.  In fact, it was so bad that I would normally have given a two star deduction, but that White Truffle pizza was so good that they earned one star back.  

Get the propane heaters outside working.  It was cold out there and since the waiting area is so small, they should make sure the customers have a comfortable place to wait.  The 20 min I waited in the cold felt like an hour.  Check the weather report and if nothing else, there is a Home Depot in the same parking lot.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,1,0,4,HBd3Z-L0sSFs3JpwkCPRtg
5752745,2015-03-12,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"I've wanted to try this place forever, and finally got the chance to do so for a get together with friends.  Everything from far away (i.e. pictures, passing by, signs) looks so tempting, so I was very hopeful that I would get an experience that would be enjoyable enough for me to return.  Alas, it falls a bit shy of being a great experience, but I may yet return to see if my one disappointment could be remedied.

The venue is fabulous - great patio area, attractive interior with great vibe both from the décor and the crowd, large bar area that gives it a bit more oomph on the adult scene side, and pleasant enough staff that keeps the mood jovial.  We had calamari which was typically good but not great, and the meatballs that were really good except for the fact that it was on the salty side.  No gamey taste, tomato sauce that was good but had an interesting taste, and sufficiently sized for the price.  Then we had the Di Faro pizza, my lone point of contention.  I'm not a fan of the deep dish style, more the New York style pizza with thin, chewy crust.  Well, Di Faro is a rectangular, deep dish style with just too much crust.  The balance just isn't there between the bread and the toppings.  As far as deep dish pizzas go, this one is pretty good.  I'm giving it a 3.5 stars based on great venue with decent other dishes, but since I can't, I'll knock it down the half based on my dissatisfaction with the main dish.  But, I am reserving a full star for another time when I will be trying a different style pizza.

Table-for-1 Factor:  The bar area is large with ample stools and tables around it, so perhaps eating alone will work.  But the atmosphere isn't necessarily suited for walking in alone, so keep that in mind.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,1,1,3,5q3s_He0krviLAGiWJqQNA

5777273,2012-12-16,0,zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,"We are regulars at DiFara's in Brooklyn, NY and wanted to try Dom's place in LV. (See my photo taken at DiFara's in Brooklyn.)

First the differences. The crust was not as thin as DiFara's in Brooklyn and the oil was not present as it is in Brooklyn. In Brooklyn the pan has a pool, not a coat, of oil under the pizza, after it is eaten. Not much oil was present here and that was just from the cheese, not from the generous amount of oil that is poured on pizzas made by Dominic himself.

The good news is that the pizza tastes the same, which is fantastic. There is no better. 
There are some advantages to the LV pizzeria. 

Comfortable chairs/tables and some elbow room. Working restrooms open to the public.
TV. A full bar, free refills on soft drinks which are from a fountain. No hour long lines to get a table and fill an order. Tables are clean here, unlike in Brooklyn where they depend on people cleaning their own tables. 

There is a full menu for Italian food, other than the fantastic pizza. We had a waiter, which does not exist in Brooklyn. 

There is even a parking lot. How about that! Also this restaurant is open all day including Monday and Tuesday. Sorry, no private parties on Thursday night yet. 

Pizza is not $28. for no toppings. It is listed at $18. but they gave us half off because of some promotion. Wow! $9.00 for an authentic DiFara's pizza!

Given a choice, I would prefer the excessively oiled pizza with the thinner crust in Brooklyn. But for $9.00, I will take this.",aagG66l0Nb09YmIQo9kHsw,1,0,5,QY1ZpA_LgtXkiJemwKdifw

We sat in the patio the weather was great the layout is awesome it's great for functions there I think it's awesome. But we did experience a long wait at the door. It Took a little too long for us to be seated. We both took notice. The waiter should inform all guests about gluten-free and vegan cheese things we missed out on. We were able to switch the cheese to vegan cheese. The pizza tasted fairly OK. I felt that I needed to add more salt and pepper to bring more flavor out of the sauce. Something I think they could work on is probably the sauce and bringing more flavor out. The waiter did take a long time to give us our first initial drinks of water and didn't check on us as quick as we wished he would.

An order of Al's Antipasti was very good but I would have preferred cheese slices instead of hard cubes of cheese.  A Yelp check in netted a complimentary order of great butter-burnished Garlic Knots.  And complimentary real crispy Garlic Bread grew on me through the night. 

I sampled a piece of Diane's Veal Marsala, and the Marsala Sauce was appropriately sweet and quite fine.  And I was pleased with the nice blend of veal, pork, and beef that comprised the three large meat balls featured in Don's Spaghetti & Meatballs.  Sauce was also delicious.  I only wished I had been ladled more spaghetti.

There were a few service errors, like quickly getting requested appetizer plates.  But it was clear that our server and busboy were trying to please and keep up with a crowded dining room.

To start off the server was pretty good and gave good service.  He seemed a bit busy but he handled it well.  He even put everything in carry out for me.  4/5 stars 

To start my meal I ordered a ceaser salad with dressing & meatball on the side. Salad was fresh,  lots of shaved cheese on top and meatball was awesome. 5/5 stars 

My pizza came out next and shortly after my bolognese came out also. OK the pizza that I ordered has extra smoked mozzarella on top of the already cheesy pizza.  Well the pizza was the most disappointing part of my meal,  I was actually really excited about getting this large pizza but I only ate ONE slice and was done.  It was NOT HOT.. Was NOT cheesy or melty.. Cheese did not pull apart when taken out. Everything on pizza seemed fresh but it just seems like the pizza was left out the oven for half an hour before serving me..  That's the best I can describe as far as how hot it was. Mediocre pizza...I've had better.  1/5 stars for the pizza.  

The next thing I ate was the bolognese.. Which I ate about 5 minutes after I ate my slice of pizza.  It was piping hot.. Steamed came out of it...  More than I can say about their pizza!!  It was fresh and looked good. As far as taste goes it was just alright.  Not bad ...not great either.  Just mediocre taste. Nothing amazing about it though.  3/5 stars. 

OK so I've told the waiter about the pizza and he offered to warm it up for me... But I was getting full off of the salad and one slice of pizza...and I still had the bolognese to go... So I declined. He said he would tell the kitchen about it. But nothing happened from it. No one came by to ask me about the pizza or what they can do....not even offer me a dessert or something..  Or to even take it off my bill.  So I pretty much paid for a pizza I didn't like.  My bill with tip and everything was almost $60! Will I ever come back to this place??  NO WAY.  there's plenty of Italian and pizza places to go to with better service and quality pizza. I give how they handled a mishap...  1/5 stars. 

The only reason I give this place a 2/5 stars at the end is the service from my waiter was good,  the salad & meatball was great and ambiance of the place looked good..sorry but I really wanted to like this place and come back more often cause it's so close to home...

Prior to arriving to the restaurant the company had already emailed the chef what our orders were to be, but there was some confusion and two waiters came by to ask orders and write down what each person was going to eat. 

Our appetizers came out fast and the setting was nice and that's where the two stars came from. When our food came out that's when everything was messed up. They all of a sudden ran out of prime rib which we ordered 20 orders of! Then they forgot 6 of us! So 6 people were sitting without food while everyone else ate for at least 30 minutes after everyone else received food. Once most of everyone was served the waiters neglected to check on us to see if everyone was served. They left 1 person out and that person waited 1 hour to eat after everyone else was almost already finished. The staff was not accommodating at all either as we had kept asking what other choices do we have if you ran out of the food we has pre-ordered. They said we had no choice but to stick with their chicken Alfredo pasta which was mediocre.
