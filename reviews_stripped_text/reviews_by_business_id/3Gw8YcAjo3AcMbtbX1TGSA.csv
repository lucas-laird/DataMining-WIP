However, this location seems to attract some local tweekers who are nutty in their own right.  This is not the restaurants fault, rather by-product of their location.",Pc5o6xAPKWwenSn_3jUKjg,0,0,3,Vgg_Z5XD7--aW9W9SdNKEQ

Anyway, just got a quick bite since I couldn't decide on something to eat while inside Stratosphere, and it was good as usual. Love that you can get breakfast items all day, and that it's disappointing it took McD's until this year to finally test a (partial, unfortunately) breakfast all day menu in some San Diego locations. Ranting aside, I got 2 breakfast sandwiches that were great. Customer service from the employees was friendly, and I didn't encounter too many weirdos walking up to here during the late afternoon. I suspect it might be a different story at night, and possibly not so good to walk to at night.",6AKefJkxjEulK4TkmrLyEw,0,0,4,wdqo8FMFmH-bnkQtZ3GAFA

I must say that if you chose to dine in, this is a great place to people watch.  you get all kinds of crazies wondering around on both the inside and out.  They have a bar and high stool type set up along the front windows which will give you the best view of people looking for cigarette butts or cans in the trash can.  To the crazy guy in the pink halter top and wild stretchy pants...ROCK ON!!!

On the day I went the drink station ice chute was practically dangling from the soda fountain and creating a leaking slimey mess everywhere.  I do not think this is a health department issue but definitely a lawsuit waiting to happen in the LV.  

Food was decent for Jack in the ""Crack"" this location will put the emphasis on the ""CrackHead"". Enjoy!!",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,3,3,4,5CuTCPBqbDZsgIRmbEi59Q
3143013,2011-11-30,1,3Gw8YcAjo3AcMbtbX1TGSA,"What can I say? It's just a Jack in the Box. Some times referred to as Jack in the Crack. It has the same exact menu and taste as all their other convenient locations. I go to Jack in the Box when I am broke and I usually order the 2 tacos for 99 vents and a jumbo jack. That's a nice meal for under 5 bucks! I love the tacos even after finding out the mysterious meat in the tacos was actually soy. Put some of their strange taco sauce on it and it taste like food to me.
This location is strange. There are some hours when the restaraunt is full of tourist getting a bite. Then early mornings and odd hours of the day it becomes a homeless hangout. With a dollar menu anyone can get enough change to get a item and hang out and eat. That is the time I use the drive thru. Be cautious when exiting the drive thru roll up your window. I have been trapped trying to get out to the road with someone begging for the tacos I just ordered. 
The service is excellent. Everyone is friendly and they always have at least one person working that speaks good English. They are fast and always have smile.
If you happen to be hungry and you are in the area, be assured that you will have the same Experience here that you would have at any other Crap in the Box!",H2HRJFCnSSM28Jdn0A_UTA,2,0,3,kLNfjcuwJLwjCT8NZNr0iw

3341428,2010-11-19,2,3Gw8YcAjo3AcMbtbX1TGSA,"Well, first of the all the view of the STRATOSPHERE from here is fantastic....i got some great shots!!! Secondly the food and service were outstanding so i would come here again if i wanted that for sure. I have been to several of these establishments all of over the western part of this country.....and this is the CLEANEST one i have ever been in....it was totally immaculate....you could eat off the floors if you wanted. 

However this establishment didn't receive 5 stars.....because i agree with my fellow yelper Steve F. When you allow panhandlers....drug addicts....drug dealers....pimps....transients....etc....to come onto and into the property that does make for an uncomfortable situation. If they fix this problem this could be one of the best Jack in the box's anywhere. Eat, Drink and Be Careful....but remain Merry my Friends!!!!!",yH3Jyu5vRTAJ8uMAD2bLGQ,2,2,4,VWHc1pH0DEl_6PpMP77UYQ

I like Jack in the Box for their all day breakfast menu, and this place was the closest I could find. I did notice a little bit of an element of drug or prostitution or something was going on. But it did not deter from my experience here; this location was very clean on the outside and inside. My food was good and served at a good temperature; the counter person gave me a refill coffee with a smile. What more can you ask for from a JB?",mkRI07cv5f1gObpkSiPwZA,0,0,3,nVWjjNc8nIFdW7p1jrmgUg

4034339,2018-05-27,5,3Gw8YcAjo3AcMbtbX1TGSA,"Stopped here since the variety of food they serve is something that I can enjoy and the twins too. Usually, in my past visits I avoid this local due to the homeless element here and the awful service in the past. I was pleasantly surprised this time when I believe all deserve a second look. One must never judge a restaurant by its cover.

The lobby was a little untidy but with a crew of only three they were doing a heck of a job. There was a cashier in the front, one for drive thru, and a cook! They showed so much love and teamwork that it was intoxicating. The cashier for the lobby was so busy they she was making out taco order even. They had such a command performance. And when the drive thru was not busy that cashier would assist in making their famous jack tacos for the lobby customers.

My twins and even I occasionally love the jack tacos and the lobby cashier rang up our order of 20 jack tacos with no lettuce and no sauce. This is one of the rare locations that still has these amazing tacos 2 for $1.00. The drive thru cashier made the jack tacos just the way they come. They changed the order of course but they did it in unison and with no attitude. We also ordered the Jumbo Jacks which were cooked really well. We took a chance and tried the loaded fries with steak and cheese. These fries were a steal for only $3.00. The cheese on the fries was a real American cheese not liquid cheese, so worth the$3.00 price they were charging. The speed that we received our order was in record time too.  It must be something they can maintain too since the first order of jack tacos was a mistake they remade them and it seemed it took less time!

The sign on the window says they are open 24 hours, but from what i experienced today, I guess not.  The female on the drive through intercom said they were closed.  I've never had issues like this here before.

People in the back just standing around knowing there's people waiting to order. Stood there for 10 min before a girl decided it was time for her to come to the front. Took her another 5 minutes to take my order. Let me remind you, I'm on my lunch. 30 MIN LUNCH. had 5 minutes to eat my food. Horrible service. The owner needs NEW employees at this location. This isn't the first time I spent 25 min at this jack in the box waiting for someone to take my order. If you're craving jack in the box I do not encourage people to go to this location.

I had not been there for months and was pleasntly suprised that every person in the dining area and parking lot looked pretty normal. I may have just lucked out with this visit, but I will now at drop in a little more often and keep you updated. If this continues, this place gets 4 star from me. Jack always has a diverse menu for a fast food place. The food quality has always been good, and service has always been friendly here. Could this Jack in the Box be turning into yet another downtown business that is being a part of the solution (and not the problem) to Downtown Las Vegas redevelopment? I hope so...time will tell. 

Jack, just keep away the addicts of crack, and I'll keep coming back. Tell the ho' she gotta go. Don't let the tweeker be a keeper. Kick the pimp to the Goodyear blimp. Help keep our hood mo' good.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,2,1,3,umg-p5La2B4W0wvjXE04vw
