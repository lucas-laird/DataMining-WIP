We ordered a bucket of crispy chicken through the drive thru around 6pm (only car in line) and they gave us the wrong chicken. They also failed to give us all the sides we paid for. We were tired and didn't check the food until we got back to the hotel room. Tired, crying and disappointed kids is not something I wish on anyone. I won't be back here again.",zzj74VjKoo0wud-wdFtf-Q,0,0,1,f20h15_NM4uFJOhi9GHRRw

When it came time to fill my drink cups, I didn't see any medium size lids and asked one of the staff members for some.

They also have a sign on an empty napkin holder saying that they include napkins with every order, however, when I left with my order I realized that I did not get any napkins or utensils.

2611728,2016-02-29,1,0uzQymPVW2l24rpjX9KIBA,"Went here late on a Friday night. Didnt realized that KFC dining room wasnt open past 10. I mean fried chicken after 10 should be a standard. This location was one of the few placed that the drive through was open past 10, 11pm to be exact. We ordered the 8 piece KFC Nashville Fried Chicken. We had seen so many commercials and we actually had the chance to try the real thing in Nashville at this place call Pattie V's. We wanted to see the comparison cause the real one in Nashville was HOOTTTTTT.
The best thing about this place is that when we ordered the Cashier guy who took our order sounds EXACTLY like AZIZ ansari!!!! We couldnt stop cracking up in the car.
The 8peice meal comes with 8 peices (mixture of breasts, wings, drumsticks) and 2 large sides (we got mashed potatoes) and 4 buicuits. They actually were short 1 buicuit, so they offered us some cookie as a replacement. I am really not a sweet person so I asked for an original crispy chicken tender. At first the cashier said no but very very quickly the manager said yes! I was so Happy cause I love fried chicken (fast food or not) I am not a snob about my fried chicken. 
Shaun our cashier/person who gave us our food was sooooo happy and pleasant and the fact that he was able to give me a tender instead of a biscuit made my night. So much that I gave to their charity and in return you get a BOGO coupon for chicken pot pit.
If you are reading this Shaun! You were such a pleasure! Your smile and additude was so welcoming and kind. Your manager needs to give you a raise!!!!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,3,1,5,Dy5ARXVFgcIe4BPV3WAZMA

2901155,2015-09-12,0,0uzQymPVW2l24rpjX9KIBA,"If allowed to give negative stars I would about this location.  Service has gone down drastically in the past couple months.  Encountering the GM last night it's easy to see why.  I had gone through drive thru on 9-10-15.  They gave me the wrong drink and the hardest chicken Littles That were in edible.  When I called the on duty manager Efren said he would replace the $5 box but nothing else (my order was $17) which I said was fine.  Just give your name hid says.  No problems he said.  Ha!
  I send my husband because I'm pregnant and it's 100 out in vegas even at 9 pm.  He came back with a couple of nasty thighs and a drink.  I was supposed to be replaced a $5 chicken little box.  So now I'm pissed.  You can only mess with a preggos food so many times people.  So I call, twice.  No answer.  So I drive down there.  To meet Philiciano.  Worst.  GM.  EVER.  
  He refuses to give me the measly $5 box.  When I ask for the GM number he says ""see problem is I am the GM"". So I say district manager then.  He tells me to wait a moment.  This is after I waited for him to help 4 cars in drive they before assisting me.  He then comes back and says ""after calling Efren I'll replace the box"" serious.  So after pretty much making me look like a con for 10 minutes he comes back to say I was right.  Imagine that?  The customer, right???!!!  So I tell him I still want the DM number and guess what happens next???  This horrible excuse for a GM says ""if you're still calling the DM I'm calling the cops I'm not serving you"". The employee Casey was awesome!  He TRIED to fix it, knowing I was pregnant.  Tried to say ""go sit in your car ma'am I'll bring it right out.""  And the GM STOPS HIM and reprimands him for helping the customer!  He said ""I'm the boss you will not help her"". On an insane ego power trip..OVER A $5 FILL UP BOX.  Unbelievable horrible service. Leaving a pregnant woman hungry for two days straight.  Making  your employee look stupid for trying to make it right.  It's no wonder over half the KFC locations are closed in vegas now.  If they keep Philiciano on this one will close next.",240PvgGazPtJmwbROLm27Q,2,0,1,tnJZ3qTSU4xZAvRzNI1uuA

5466035,2010-08-15,5,0uzQymPVW2l24rpjX9KIBA,"This review is for two things: My meal, and the level of service that I got from this particular address.

First let's cover the meal selection: After months of Facebook mentions from friends, popular media jokes and articles, speed eating contests and every reported media what have you, I decided to try the ""Double Down"" sandwich.  You know the one: Two pieces of chicken that have some sort of sauce, cheese and bacon between each breast like some sort of unholy abomination.  I had described it elsewhere as it being the equivalent of taking your stomach to a brothel, and ending up getting ""The Ugly One"" for your digestive tract.  It's... I'll explain more later.

The service?  I should have known what I was in for when the girl didn't turn off the drive-in microphone and started whining to her co-workers.  I should have further known in seeing the ""Love/Hate"" tattoos emblazoned on said server, because I guess while I should have found it endearing that someone had given her the apparent impression that this inkage choice was still somehow trendy and relevant in the 2010's, I couldn't help but realize that the someone who had made this opinion known was a liar.

I was told that my meal was to take 7 minutes to prepare.  Okay, fine.  I hate waiting to the side at any fast food place, but I wasn't in a hurry.  One minute turned to seven.  Seven minutes turned to twenty.

It doesn't take a meteorologist to know that sitting in Vegas' lovely 100+ degree Summers is not fun for nearly half an hour.  But I was going to be cool (pun not intended) about it, go inside, and just ask about the status of my food.

So in I go (the other pet peeve I hate about the ""pull over and wait"" tactic), and present another girl my receipt to inquire about the status of my order.  The original girl saw me and had that pissed look of ""Oh no he didn't"" at me.  ""It will be ready in a minute"", she snapped at me.  ""Fine"", I responded  ""It was just too hot for me to sit outside.""

She slings me the bag, and is quite obviously done with me.  Bear in mind that I hadn't been rude, and my only ""crime"" was to come in to see where my food was after a now 25 minute wait.  ""I still need my drink, please"", I said.  She looked at me like somehow my words had formed themselves into a sharp object and were repeatedly stabbing her in the head.  I got my cup, and was on my way.

To credit, the food was hot and obviously freshly cooked.

But this wait confounded me.  Did it really take 20 minutes to prepare a ""Double Down"" sandwich?  At this point, is it still really considered ""fast food""?

Braving my stomach's well-being, I went to another KFC a few days later and tried another.  While they had me pull over to wait, this time, it took less than 3 minutes.

But let me tell you: After sampling a second one of these sandwiches, I think I'm cured of my need to ever sample another one of these monstrosities again.  I think my very soul is tainted, and I may need to go to confession.  Or have an exorcism performed.

As for this original address, I've been here a few times in the past, and was never impressed by the lackluster service.  This last incredibly pained to do her job server was the final straw in me ever coming to this particular KFC again.

(Note I said ""this one"", as oh, how I do love their mashed potatoes.)",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,4,3,1,6RuwsFTVSbKsMlzY-YJGxw
