The staff are very very nice! 

Their soondubujigae (tofu soup) is awesome! I asked if it was spicy since it did not have a chili pepper sign next to it and they said they could make it spicy for me. I also really love their kimchee fried rice! Huge portions!

Their AYCE is very delicious! I like that they have a mix of korean and even hawaiian style things. Their garlic shrimp is very tasty and addicting! The price is very affordable at $13.99. 

AYCE is kind of hard when its busy just because it starts to get slow with the food coming out. One time it was busy and the guy just told us we can just order what we wanted (usually a 2 plate max at a time). Thus, we didn't have to wait everytime we were done to order and get our food.

My favorite thing about this place has to be the threatening remarks on the menu that state that Yum Yum will charge you for unfinished food. Apparently Yum Yum doesn't want you to waste food, or they want to pretend to be your mom and tell you to clear your plate. Either way, this shouldn't be a problem if you choose the right items (kalbi, meat jun, tempura). Pick wisely and you will crave Yum Yum all the time. One final note would be to stay away from the eel because it's a little funky here (other funky items include chap chae and masubis).",sfH6K7Q43346LbiJ1TKhnQ,0,0,4,nfAbiebLm5uc0pnaFYizKQ

There were a few good ones, but Vegas wins hands down in my opinion.  The first thing I did when returning was to head to my favorite Japanese restaurant.  On my way home from that I noticed quite a few little restaurants had popped up by my house.

I stopped in at Yum Yum and was initially drawn to the overly cute branding.  Apparently one of the brothers in the family that owns this place did all the branding. Now this was one of the major faults of Asian restaurants in Chicago.  Awesome branding, sub par food.  Not the case with Yum Yum.

Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp - Great flavor! This was my favorite dish.
Vegetable Egg Roll - basic, nothing special.

The sushi wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. The plus side is the rolls are huge, but it also keeps you from trying more rolls because you get so full.

2590744,2010-09-09,0,wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw,"Being from Hawaii, I have a high standard for korean plate lunches.  Normally places on the continental U.S. can't even compare to the local food we have in Hawaii.  It's very weird to have a mix of korean and japanese food in the same restaurant.  No one does that in Hawaii.

With all that being said, I was extremely happy with my meal at Yum Yum BBQ.  I had the 2 combination meal with meat jun and bulgogi.   The bulgogi was OK, but the meat jun was delicious.  The meat jun was on the crispy side and didn't ooze any fat.  Some people tend to like the ""wet"" meat jun style where the meat jun is moist with healthy amounts of oil, fat, and egg, but not me.  Yum Yum's meat jun might be my favorite meat jun, which is a shame because I don't live in Vegas.

I also tried 2 sushi rolls, the Yum Yum roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Again it's very weird to have sushi in a korean restaurant, but the sushi was very tasty.  Normally when I go to the mainland to have sushi, I expect bland fish with grainy texture.  I got none of that here.  Both rolls were worthy of being served in Hawaii.

I also tried the tofu soup, but that was watery and didn't taste all that great.

If I lived in Vegas, I definitely wouldn't complain about the option of eating at Yum Yum BBQ.  They make good food for a good price.  If I'm craving Hawaii local style food I would make my way to Yum Yum BBQ.",gLlJ81m0Dow8V9lN_MPP2g,0,0,3,xV-rOGTgLDgJttLMo-Eaiw

It's about $20/person when you do the ""all you can eat"" option. I have never been to a place that served food in this manner, but wowsers... I like! The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.

Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.

I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.

What makes Yum Yum special is that each dish is cooked to order. Yes, you can only order 3 at a time. Big deal. Eat here more than once and you'll pick up the rhythm right away. 

Service is excellent, as the restaurant is small and the one fella who handles the front of the restaurant stays on the move while the cooking goes on in the back. 

Sushi is included with AYCE, including my favorite, the Philly Roll. It's not $30 AYCE sushi quality, but it's way way better than buffet level and a great deal at half the price.

A number of other items are available, including Volcano Pork, Teriyaki Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, Spam Musubi, and more, but if you don't order Kalbi, and lots of it, you're missing out. I've eaten Kalbi all over town and NEVER found it this tender, juicy, and delicious!

3442506,2010-10-07,5,wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw,"I first heard about Yum Yum BBQ from a friend. She said it was cheap, and good so i thought , what could go wrong there? 

The first time I went there I ordered the crispy tempura roll, and the BBQ chicken plate. These dishes were good and made me want to come back for more. The second time I went to Yum Yum in 2009, I finally noticed that they had an ""all you can eat"" menu. The price for the ability to eat all the sushi rolls, and Hawaiian foods that you wanted was an automatic steal. In 2009 the price for the ""all you can eat"" menu was a dollar or two cheaper, like it really makes a huge difference. Along with the ""all you can eat"" there is the ""all you can drink"" option which allows you to get unlimited sodas or bottled waters from their fridge. One soda or bottle of water usually costs around 1.50-2.00  dollars so you might as well add on the ""all you can drink"" option for another 2-3 dollars extra.

The first time I ordered the ""all you can eat"" I brought along 5 of my friends to try it with me. They were here visiting from San Francisco, and of course just wanted to eat, eat, and eat. I thought it was a good way to take a break from all the ordinary Las Vegas buffets. We were amazed at all the food options listed on the ""all you can eat"" menu. There was Hawaiian food such as, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, spam masubi, etc. There was Japanese food such as the MANY types of sushi rolls they offer (One of my favorite parts about this menu, since regular sushi rolls in other restaurants sell for 8-12 dollars). And there was also delicious Korean BBQ. I definitely suggest the short ribs (kalbi).

Every year when my friends come to visit me, Yum Yum BBQ is always on the list of places to eat at here in Las Vegas. I'm sure the waiter who is always there knows us by now. He is really nice, and has lots of patience when serving a group of people who are all hungry for their yummy dishes. Oh and I forgot to add that you can only order 2 dishes at a time, but since it is a small, usually non-busy place, you'll be able to get your order pretty fast.",aQCbHG-3LG6GPLLsf984Rw,7,5,5,00nNLY2GZaytBDEO9RJspA

It was dinner time and we had a choice, Yum Yum BBQ or El Polo Loco. Hmmm where should we eat?  I figured Yum Yum would be the best pick of the two because it wasn't fast food. 

Standing at the counter there is no menu above but a picture of large cartoon characters. A small menu was located to the left that is so low that you have to bend over to read it.  So I stood up and ordered. Our food comes out (BBQ mix plate and Chicken Katsu). I should let you know this place is pretty much like a wanna be L&L BBQ. So, I would think that the portions would be close to an L&L mix plate for the same price of $8.99........... Noooooope. I also didn't think I would spend $20 for two plates.

The food was bland, over cooked, took way to long (maybe the reason it was over cooked?) and the portion size was an insult to my hard earned $8.99. I don't want to say all bad stuff....... The older lady was nice.

Ok, so the lesson of the story is that if you want Hawaiian BBQ or someones spin on it you should just stick to the big hitters. I'm not sure how in a city of a million restaurants this place stays in business.

Heard about this place through Yelp (shocking, eh) and decided to give it a go.  What drew us here was the $14 AYCE.  Seriously, how can you NOT eat $14 worth of Korean food?

We tried a bunch of rolls and most of the meats. The stars of the show were the Kal Bi and ""Volcano"" pork.  I love love love Korean spicy pork and, while this place doesn't have the best, it's pretty darn tasty.  As for the Kal Bi, it was close to being the best I have found in Vegas: tender, savory, slightly charred and still pink in the middle.  My son tore it up.  Between three adults and a one year old, we must have demolished about 6 orders.

As good as the Kal Bi was, I have to say that the sushi rolls just weren't very tasty.  I can't even remember which ones we ordered (we had about 4) and none stood out.  Also, the sauce for the meat jun was the same for the man du and shrimp tempura.  Not bad for the most part, but it just did not go with the shrimp.

Despite the rolls and sauce, though, the place is totally redeemed by their udon.  It's been a while since we've found tasty udon in Vegas and this place nailed it.  It was so good that, even though it wasn't part of the AYCE, we ordered two bowls.  

For the kal bi alone, the AYCE was worth the money.  Add a bowl of udon to that and you've got yourself stuffed.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,1,1,4,mF1mrvJBI-CqeYWF6caPvw

-Katsu 
-Bul Kogi

-Man Du

-Garlic shrimp (shell on) 
-Misubi 
there is quite a bit
-about 15-20 different sushi rolls from spicy tuna to tiger rolls and everything in between 

Surprisingly the Kalbi marinade was on point and very good cuts of meat. Katsu was a bit thin for my liking but not bad just not great. Garlic shrimp was tasty but i hate having to work for my food so peeling the shell just pissed me off. BBQ chicken was grilled and good (not dry) but not sauced up just grilled chicken. Chap Chae was actually not bad considering its pretty easy to mess this dish up, thumbs up. I did have two sushi rolls but honestly it just didnt go with the rest of the meal, so i kept the heaps of meat, noodles, and man du flowing nicely. I will say for the price its hard to beat and coming from a guy who is really picky about his kalbi marinade they actually do quite well with it so dont miss out on that if/when you go. 
The place is small and in a strip mall sort of situation so dont be overly impressed with the outside appearance even though the logo is actually kinda cute.

4196480,2010-03-30,0,wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw,"$12.99 (limited time only) FOR DINNER, can you believe it?! I don't think I can even get a mediocre buffet lunch for that price.

This place is conveniently close to the hotels which were off the main Vegas strip. And Yelp does wonders because 90% of the patrons who were there were out of towners. 

The nice thing about this place is that when you walk in, it doesn't reek of kalbi or any other meats It just smelled like... nothing, which is wonderful! The buffet menu came with a disclaimer: ""$3 charge for each dish of food you waste. Can only order 2-3 dishes at a time and can't order more till you're done with everything."" I suppose that's a semi smart way to ensure large quantities of food don't go to waste. 

There was a mix of sushi ROLLS (rolls = 6-8 pieces of massive sushi) and your typical Korean stuff like kalbi (should get), bulgogi (can pass), volcano pork (can pass), etc. Our mistake was ordering 3 sushi rolls (didn't know they were rolls at first) during our first round. Oh boy - but luckily we passed it. There's also a mix of Hawaiian in it - garlic shrimp (highly recommend), spam musubi (tastes like any other spam musubi, but seriously... why would you order that when you're having all you can eat?), etc. 

Overall, this place is great if you're sick of the crab legs, cocktail shrimp and (nasty) prime rib at all the American buffets. The price is great as well!",W5VmqP2T4O_aAMq5YwTJzQ,3,2,5,xRtWASiNCwTCP96rehNeHg
4262209,2011-01-17,3,wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw,"Cheap and good.  Their sushi is decent but I would stick to the cooked rolls.  I remember we got 6 rolls for take out and bill came out to $21 including tax.  The California roll was like $2.95.  You can't even get supermarket sushi for that cheap.

But their BBQ is by far the best.  So far I've had the chicken.  It's inexpensive and so flavorful.  I love the male server with the flower apron.  He seems to let the dirty dishes pile up at the tables, even when you push them to the edge.  He also can't grasp the concept of carrying more than two plates at a time.  He'll make a million trips just to deliver a few dishes.  But he cracks me up every time.  His floral apron makes me smile.",jClTjIP3oIuehjbW5I3saQ,3,1,4,NQfUDtbfRsd0VIQ9LvjDFQ

They have a sushi roll special, where if you order 2 or more selected rolls, they come at a discounted price. It's huge! like - put it all in your mouth and cover your face with a napkin cuz it's embarrassing - huge. 

They also have a decent AYCE menu, selection is limited, but it had all the things I normally get, so it didn't bother me.

This buffet is better because it is made to order. You pick a few items off the menu and it is made fresh and then order some more items off the menu. All for $15.99! I do hate it when others, who don't know Korean, food rate these types of places. I am a S. Korean and I know my food. Is it the best Korean ever? No..BUT it is pretty dang good for the value that you are getting. I liked everything on the menu and it tastes how it suppose to taste. Most of the food is basic Korean food done well.

the kalbi was delightful.. definitely my favorite on the menu. man du was not too greasy/oily, i ordered two of that :) i like the fact that they allow only two to three orders per round (per person) (IOW: 2 people can order 6 dishes). the volcano pork was supposed to be spicy.. and it looked really spicy, w the red sauce.. but it was not spicy in the least bit. that's okay, because it was still okay to eat (i'd give the volcano pork a 6 out of 10). garlic shrimp was a pain to deshell, so i just ate it whole (and it was pretty good with the shells!!) chap chae was good too. kalbi and chap chae was my top 2. bulgogi was mediocre.. tasted like pure beef.. not much to it. spicy tuna roll was okay, but the love sushi roll was really good too!! 

overall, love this place. also you should know a few things before heading over there in terms of pricing: 
-if one person gets an All You Can Eat, everyone else at the table MUST get AYCE (no exceptions!)
-if you get AYCE, and you would to order some items that is not on the AYCE menu (such as bibimbap), it would cost $4 for the other items instead of the regular price. however, you would not be allowed to take those items (that are not AYCE) home if you can't finish it. if you decide to do some takeout along with your dining in, it would be regular price and not $4.00

The BBQ is actually a fusion of Hawaiian, Korean and Japanese.

Everything I tried so far is pretty good and believe me I tried alot last time. Next time I think I'm just gonna go with the AYCE for 13 bucks. 

This is mom and pop shop, never really seen it busy but thats probably because not many people know about it. 

The Chicken Katsu was pretty good and the Bul-go-gi kinda tatse like the fake beef from yoshinoya in a GOOD way. You know you love the meat from there even if you are unsure if it's real meat sometimes.

5215602,2010-08-15,0,wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw,"We drove about 15 minutes or so from the strip to get to this place, which isn't too bad.  It's located in a small strip mall type area, so it would be possible to miss it the first time around.  When we entered, it was fairly empty, which I didn't mind at all because that meant we would get our food faster.

I was with my friend and our girlfriends, and we all decided to do the buffet.  It was less than $15 each and we soon learned the price was well worth it.  We pretty much tried everything on the menu from the katsu to noodles to the musubis.  Everything was really good, especially the noodles and I believe it was spicy pork?  The only bad thing I had at this place was the sushi roll I ordered.  It had way too much mayo, but it wasn't so bad that it ruined my meal.  Besides, I didn't go there for the sushi anyway.

5361276,2011-05-22,0,wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw,"**Summary**
       - Flavor - Aside from the garlic shrimp, nothing stood out too much for flavor. Most things were decent to good.
       - Variety - This is the only place I've seen serving Hawaiian, Korean, and Japanese in a buffet.
       - Value - They have the same price all day and since they raised their price to $15.99, it isn't as great a deal, but it definitely beats out most places for value at dinner time.
       - Rules - Though it says order 2 or 3 items per round and finish your plate before the next, they didn't enforce it as much with us. I'm assuming the rule is there for those who abuse the system.
       - I'd definitely recommend ordering the Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp, Kalbi, and Bulgogi.
       - If you like spicy, I'd say go for the Volcano Pork.
       - For all those sushi connoisseur (those who'd never order a California roll), I'd stay away from the sushi.
**Price**
       - $15.99 AYCE
**Ordered**
       - Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp - After peeling through two shrimp shells, I just started eating them whole. The shell is crispy enough to do so. This dish is very good and very buttery. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=TFhT4KvNPC_gsV2YchDiMA)
       - Bulgogi - A little dry compared to the grill your own Korean BBQ, but tasty. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)
       - Kalbi - Not as flavorful as L&L, but it's a buffet, so it wasn't bad. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)
       - Volcano Pork - This was a little too spicy for me. I guess they really meant volcano. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=uMofJGiHNph0pn2coNGEqA)
       - Chap-Chae - Clear noodles. Pretty good compared to other chap chae, but I don't really like chap chae. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)
       - Tempura Shrimp - A little too much breading on the shrimp tempura for my taste.
       - Spam Musubi - They use less teriyaki sauce than most places. I felt it a little bland.
       - Meat Jun - Thin slices of beef dipped in egg batter and fried. Wasn't my cup of tea.
       - Sexy Girl Roll - The spicy tuna was not very spicy at all. The rice-sushi ratio was a slightly high. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=KVndGIPsZ6wXYCwNM52g2w)
       - Alaskan Roll - A hefty portion of imitation crab in the middle. The salmon was not the freshest, but decent. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=vTJVUzj5mNzAkwvmT8zh2Q)
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a decent dinner buffet. The variety somewhat makes up for a slight lacking in quality.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,0,4,BRMuggm-4K945dP2Buh_1w

I love the kalbi, man-doo, chap-chae, and the love sushi roll.  The bulgogi, bbq chicken, garlic shrimp and are okay.  
While they do have about 16 rolls on the menu, they are all a take on a california roll or a shrimp tempura roll.

I honestly don't usually order rolls if I have a choice of sashimi/sushi....but I must say the dragon and tiger rolls are quite tasty here and extremely cheap at $6.99/roll.  Some places, the rolls have a not so fresh/fishy quality to them....but not here...the eel always tastes fresh, as well as the tuna.   The rolls are also ginormous in size....with that being said...I can still finish two rolls on my own easily =).  This is really a Hawaiian restaurant, I believe the owners mentioned they hail from Maui.... The Hawaiian selections that stand out are the meat jun (thinly sliced beef wrapped in fried egg) and bbq chicken.   I've tried the pork and beef options...but they seemed a little on the dry side for my liking.

I haven't had the opportunity to do the all you can eat option here...but for ~$15/person....I'm determined to do it at some point.  The AYCE menu consists of all their sushi roll options, the typical Hawaiian plate lunch options (kalbi, bbq beef, bbq chicken, volcano pork, katsu, garlic shrimp etc), tempura, spam musubi, and the list goes on.

First off, this is more of a deli than sushi bar.  You go to the counter to place your order.  Then sit down in one of the 6 tables and wait for them to bring it to you, or you can just get it ""to go"".

At $5 (normally $6-9) the portions are real good.  I ordered one each of the Dragon Roll and Alaskan Roll.  Both came with crab meat, just a bit more mayo than I prefer, BTW I'm not a big fan of mayo, so take that for what it is.  Each plate had wasabi and ginger, enough for me and a friend if we had 2 rolls each.  That is just way to much wasabi and ginger.  They are condiments, not garnishes.  Beyond that, presentation was excellent, the rolls looked fresh and appetizing. 

Now for the really bad.  Location, you hear this all the time, location, location, location.  And they picked a bad spot.  If you are familiar with this area, it's where the Jersey Mike's Subs used to be.  In a small strip mall away from the street.  With the Jiffy Lube and Sonic Drive-Thru surrounding it, you'll easily drive right past it.  Even looking for it, you can easily miss it.

With 808 and Sumo just a block away, this place will not be my go-to sushi spot for dinner.  Lunch, on the other hand.  With the speed the rolls came out, I can see me coming here for a quick roll on the run.",wfx2G50lMeSK_kqcQqP0lw,0,1,4,cPbtn_jmAnuGKvYU3yaUng
