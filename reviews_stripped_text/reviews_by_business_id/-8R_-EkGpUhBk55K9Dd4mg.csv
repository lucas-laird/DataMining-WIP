143801,2016-07-11,0,-8R_-EkGpUhBk55K9Dd4mg,I was quite fortunate to have discovered this nice little Thai restaurant near work! Their food is quite exceptional and beyond the many great eateries we r bless with in this great city of our. The thing I like most about this particular Thai restaurant is the in-house made curry and the friendly service from the staff! Eventhough I m not a really  big fan of spicy food! The curry has enough special herbs to balance out the flavor! I will definitely be back for my lunch break at this little desert flower!,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,0,4,tSrDgb7hulEJOUbjY6uzOQ

While I was waiting for my take-out a man drove up on a blue scooter.  He parked and came inside.  Then he proceeded to assist the staff in preparing my food.  I had an unobstructed view as he simply walked into the kitchen and set to work on my food.  I walked over to another person at the counter and asked if he was going to wash his hands.  She spoke to him and he briefly ducked out of sight and came back wiping his hands on a paper towel.  This is unsafe and pretty disgusting.

We had chicken wings, soup, sweet and sour chicken, garlic chicken and teriyaki chicken.

1624168,2013-11-04,0,-8R_-EkGpUhBk55K9Dd4mg,"Let me start off by saying the service here is absolutely horrible! Stopped in for a weekday lunch & took over an hour & a half to get chicken pad thai from their lunch menu ($6.95) as well as an order of pot stickers. The restaurant was busy when my co-worker & I arrived which I thought was a good sign - meaning good place to eat. However I should have realized immediately that only 1 table actually had their food. Took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks (water). And they screwed that up. My dining partner had actually ordered iced tea. Watched as the cooks in the back took food (some type of ribs) out of the microwave while we were waiting for our food. Was glad that I hadn't gotten that. Saw a couple of tables that sat down after us & that ordered after us getting their food before we did which is upsetting that the waitress couldn't figure out who should get served first. I realize we did order an appetizer but we also ordered a lunch special in which we should have received our soup prior to our meal. Once we finally received our food was sadly disappointed. Pot stickers were frozen from a box type. Could tell as there was freezer burn on them. As far as chicken pad thai there was quite a bit of chicken actually in the dish which I was surprised to see. I like to order a spiciness of 1 so that way I can make my own spiciness. Well apparently the chef thought I asked for a 3 or something because it was spicy. My dining partner ordered a 0 & his was spicy. How does a 0 warrant any spice? Had to ask several times to get our bill. I only get an hour for lunch & this place was a sad disappointment taking over an hour & a half to take our order, get our food, eat, bill, etc. They need to learn how to speed things up as I know there were many 9-5 workers in there that day & I am sure they all only got an hour as well. While waiting for our food watched several people come in & place take out orders & they ended up waiting 25-30 minutes to get their food. There was absolutely no pep in either waitresses step. They both seemed like they didn't care how long it took them to get your items out to you. Would rather go to Archies Thai & spend a little more on their lunch special & know that I am going to be able to be back to work in my allotted time frame. I wouldn't waste my time coming back to this place even if it is cheap. I guess what they say is you get what you pay for.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,0,0,2,sXD6vlL2bHKdlDK7zY1M9A

Ordered 2 lunch specials, 1 reg chicken entree, order of egg rolls and 1 sticky rice. 
Got there to pick up and wanted to add on an extra sticky rice but they said they were out. OK.. no big deal. Got back to the office and realized I didn't even get my 1 order of sticky rice one of the lunch specials had onions (requested to leave them out) and only 2 packets of soy sauce.
Called and told them we'd come back for a new order w/out onions. The office assistant went back and got the new order, asked for extra soy sauce and asked for the sticky rice we didn't get. The bigger guy said he put it in the bag himself so he knows we got it. 
She got back to the office w/the new order.. it was sooooo spicy, maybe I was being punished for complaining they got my order wrong. They gave 2 more packets of soy sauce (like really?). And when she told me about the man telling her about the sticky rice I was so annoyed I called..
Talked to him and after arguing for 5 mins he said ""now that I think about it I might have given it to someone else.. We got really busy.""

1760946,2014-12-10,0,-8R_-EkGpUhBk55K9Dd4mg,"Recent studies have shown that curries can actually be effective in lowering blood pressure, and sometimes by lunch after a frustrating morning at the office I am certain I could use this.  While this may be true, it also true that I never need an excuse to eat Thai.  So my go-to workday Thai lunch spot is the nearby Sin City Thai.

In addition to any benefits of lower blood pressure, Sin City Thai will clear up any sinus problems.  Their food is HOT and they will let you know that when you order.  I wouldn't be surpised if their mild 3 is hotter than some places spiciest 5.  I don't mind the heat and occassionally I enjoy the tongue blistering heat.  If that is how you like it, this is the place for you.

Besides the heat, the curries are fairly straight forward with onions, carrots, and potatos.  The meats are thinly sliced which allows the sauce to mix in throughout the meat and gives a powerful flavor.  It includes a spring roll and wonton that along with the sweet dipping sauce provides a nice contrast to the heat of the main dish.  When dining in, the meal also includes a bowl of soup.

Their lunch specials are very reasonably priced ($6.95) and for about the price of a McDonald's value meal you can get a real meal.  Between the good food, the lunch specials, and the close proximity to many offices, it is quite popular during the week and can be very busy at the noon hour.

1. beef salad - surprising amount of beef! but needs more lettuce and juice/sauce. i love any beef salad, this was middle of the road good flavor wise. the beef on it though was better than average because it was cooked well, wasn't chewy, and there was a ton of it.
2. beef pad see ew - not bad, not great, just averagely good.  i wish there was more broccoli in it. 
3. green curry - i debated between yellow and green and the waitress said ""our yellow curry is more popular but i like the green curry flavor more"". so i went with the green curry with chicken. it comes with white rice, and is the greenest green curry I've ever seen. almost a lime green. the color threw me off but the curry itself was good.

Since this place is close to my work, I'll probably come back when I'm in the mood for soup. But I'll likely make the drive a little further for more flavorful food.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,2,3,3Ph3QrhWs8B9L0lruODbcg
2107277,2013-01-19,0,-8R_-EkGpUhBk55K9Dd4mg,"This is a very nice family run place immediately next to the much beloved Phat Phrank's.  The restaurant is small with maybe seating for about 20 but comfortable and inviting.  In particular we really enjoyed the soft shell crab salad and the Tom Kha Gai (chicken and coconut milk soup).  Generally, a thing to watch out for here is that their idea of spiciness is set a little higher than most places.  So, if you normally like your Thai food a 4 out of 5 for spiciness, you should start with a 3 out of 5 here. (Or maybe even a 2, if you want to be cautious.)  In terms of prices, I was  pleasantly surprised.  My impression is that the Sin City Thai prices run about 15% lower than those of competing Thai restaurants.  One more cool thing about this place is that if you're dining out with friends and maybe one part of the group wants Thai and another would prefer Mexican, both Sin City Thai and Phat Phrank's are totally cool with you getting food from both places and eating in either.  (They're not related businesses, they're just both very up with customer service about things.)",mCE_KnU9z5N1TR0HbCFAzw,0,0,4,hES3A4ZZYytrkJuK5cHyVg

Friend was mentioning about the lunch specials that he comes here often with co workers. He like it solid good Thai food. I was like why not plus always helps keep reviews up checking out new places. lol. Anyway stopped by for lunch it eventually got crowded by 12am so early lunch be ideal. It small restaurant not lot of seats. 

The lunch specials they have nice selection that can choose from for your entree. Some Thai places there lunch specials might not have as many choose from but here it nice list. One that for sure will be back to try more of the list. I decided to start the list with Kung Pao. I was going with Orange Chicken but server warning me that not your typical orange chicken just in case thinking Panda style. I appreciated the fact that she mentioned to me that the restaurant style is more true Thai style dishes. The Kung Pao it really did have different taste then normally associate with Kung Pao. If there one distinct thing that STANDS out. The HEAT on the dishes are insane. Start you need to know that the heat scale goes from 1-4. Not your norm like most other Thai places might go 1-10. Other need to know VERY important no joke talking about the heat. They warn you and she even double warns you if think high and mighty can handle the burn. I had the 2. I never had 2 that HOT. It was good kind of heat. The portion size is decent, all lunch specials comes with choice of soup, rice, and egg roll. Best part is under $10 for any lunch special. Get your choice of protein just if want Shrimp dollar extra. 

The service can be slow only because only one waitress for the whole restaurant. The interior decor is nice. Don't forget to check out the chalkboard with the daily specials or non menu items. The staff is awesome. It was my first time. She did awesome job explaining to me the heat scale works and made a great recommendation change my order from Orange Chicken to Kung Pao. 

No doubt plan on coming back again...till the next lunch special!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,4,4,C_iir-XrvNKOmpZzCvYp4A

They have a nice looking lunch menu for $6.95 which includes an egg roll, won ton, soup, rice, and choice of curry, pad thai, beef broccoli, and few more. Warning they use a 5 levels heat scale for their curries just incase you order a 5 thinking its medium, most places I've been to use 10 levels. Customer service was great. The interior was nice and clean. Sounds like I should be having a good experience. 

Unfortunately when it came to the food, the one and only time I think I'll ever be here, it was pretty bad. Yea I ate the whole meal but it was a struggle and I was hungry. I went with the yellow curry with chicken from the lunch menu. It was pretty runny to what I usually  have at other places. The chicken seemed over cooked and some of the veggies were partially raw. The flavor wasn't as strong also. After the first couple spoons I was like I don't want anymore. Started to add rice maybe I would get better nope. Anyways I ate it all feeling very unsatisfied.

They offer plenty of lunch specials for $6.95, but I was craving spicy chicken with basil for lunch. I ordered Level 3 (out of 5) and instantly knew I was in for a challenge. I like Hot food, but not to the extent where my mouth goes numb and I start crying. The food smelled so spicy and delicious, I couldn't wait to get back to work and eat it. After giving it some thought, I decided to sneak a bite at the first stop light to see how spicy this food really was. Then it hit me--WOW! Not only was this dish hotter than Jennifer Lawrence, it was really good. 

The chicken was cooked perfectly (sliced not ground) and was mixed with white onions, basil, red, and green peppers. However, what I liked most was the fantastic sauce this food was swimming in. I tossed my steamed rice up in there to soak up every last delicious drop. 

The place is casual, and the gentleman who took my order was really nice. My food was ready in 10 minutes which made me nervous. I didn't think you could put a dish together that quickly that packed so many flavors. I really like it here. Next time, I will bring my wife so she can try something else and I could sample it. I know what I am getting! Why mess with perfection?

We started out with delicious hibiscus lemonades. Very refreshing, definitely something I would try again. We also shared a chicken satay appetizer. It was good, but not great.

For my meal, I went with the Mixed Vegetable lunch special which is a good deal at $6.95. The menu does not give a description of the dish, I assumed I would get an assortment of veggies like corn, mushrooms and broccoli. Instead I got onions and peppers in assorted colors.

I decided to go back and get some takeout before posting a review. This time I went with the Orange Chicken lunch special. I did not call in my order, but they still had me on my way in about 15 minutes.

The restraunt it's self is pretty small,  only about 8 tables.   When I arrived in was still kinda crowded from the lunch rush,  and none of the tables looked bused yet.  The gentlemen in the front serving noticed me right away and cleaned off a table promptly.  
I ordered a plate of pad kea mow,  which is my favorite Thai dish.  I got my food quickly in less than ten minutes.  One thing I thought was strange was how the noodles used were not fat wide noodles that I usually see in the dish.  Instead they were similar to fettuccine noodles.  When asking how spicy I would like,  the waitress asked between one and five stars.  Now,  I'm used to them asking me in between one and ten,  so it took me a second to decide on my desired spiciness.  
I went ahead and went with a two.

The reason for 1* was that the range of spicy was INSANE. The Pad Thai was so spicy I couldn't eat anymore. I lost my appetite because the spicy wasn't spicy it was like I was eating medicine. The Chow Mein was barely manageable and the chicken smelt like it was pure peppers. 

We usually eat spicy food on the regular but this was disgusting. Waste of $35... If you order here DONT get anything spicy they clearly don't know how to cook spicy food.",0h-BTqPKUzSpkJu0jqoXQg,2,0,1,9fQ8N99t0Kq18X--wETN5w
