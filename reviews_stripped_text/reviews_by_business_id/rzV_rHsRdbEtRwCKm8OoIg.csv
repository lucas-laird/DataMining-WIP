It came with a beautiful house salad loaded with cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, and feta-super fresh and yummy. The quinoa bowl was very nicely balanced with the earthy spinach and acidic dressing of herbs and onions. The gentleman that prepared my food provided excellent customer service.

I don't know his name, but I always deal with the man and he is super pleasant and always friendly and willing to answer all of my crazy questions. 

As for the food. I'm addicted to their stuffed sweet potato. So much so that I make my own version at home, that's never quite as good, but still not bad. I could eat this dish once a week for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy. I've also had their brown rice bowl and was amazing at the portions! It lasted me two whole lunches and was just as good reheated.

1603966,2016-01-08,0,rzV_rHsRdbEtRwCKm8OoIg,"Yay! My first review of the year!  so here's what we got: 1. Quinoa & Brown Rice bowl w/ the spinach stew (comes w/ side salad. 1. Acai bowl (these items are pictured). 1. Stuffed sweet potatoes (that everyone on here raves about). 1. Quinoa & Brown rice bowl w/ SALMON instead of chicken w/ house made dressing (comes w/ side salad). Everything came out to about $35.00 but the amount of food was beyond me. 

Ok, let me start off by saying this place SPECIALIZES in gourmet HEALTH FOOD.. So if you came here to order anything other I can't imagine it being up to parr w/ what they've advertised their main dishes to be. That being said! Everything was pretty good! If you're looking to start eating healthy for the new year this place has some options for you. The spinach stew bowl w/ chicken was good, a little tangy for my taste but still good & HEALTHY for you. Let me remind you, usually the things that have a bunch of sauce and FULL OF FLAVOR are most of the time, not good for you. The salmon bowl we got w/ the house dressing was a little DISAPPOINTING only because when we got back to the office- their wasn't any salmon in it! Wah... Wah.. Wahh....  but that's a-OK  people make mistakes...we all know that. As for the house made dressing choice we chose for the bowl- it was pretty good!! It's almost like a bernaise sauce!! I even took a little and tipped over my spinach stew ;)... BUT this probably isn't as health conscious as the other stuff. Lol 

I saved the best two for last!! The STUFFED SWEET POTATOES & the ACAI BOWL... *YUM*  I have to say, they are JUST AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK IN THE PICTURES... Try them... Seriously the best two items they have on the menu and, PERFECT! They're not that unhealthy at all! 

Ps. I am not one for chipotle sauce, AT ALL. I can taste it about a mile away... But in the stuffed sweet potatoes- you can hardly taste it as it's very very subtle and compliments the dish very well.. 

HAPPY YELPING!",FDrkr00GXyL5gJGODJ2tAg,0,0,4,tL2kB8ZNY3dyYfsgccst7w
1645764,2015-10-27,8,rzV_rHsRdbEtRwCKm8OoIg,"Name ONE other place in Vegas you can find stuffed sweet potatoes. What about quinoa bowls? Both on the same menu. I'll wait. Didn't think so! I have yet to find the potatoes elsewhere, and the bowls (both quinoa and acai) are large, filling, flavorful, and fresh.
 
Everything I've tried here has been excellent: the lentil soup is amazing, the potatoes make a great dinner, and the quinoa bowl is so huge it easily makes two meals.  I go significantly out of my way (nearly 30 miles round trip) to come here about once a week- the fact that they currently offer a Groupon is a nice perk, but the prices are so low you won't need one.

Quality is great, portions are huge and prices are fair, and the food itself is great. Service is friendly and attentive, and usually the owner himself is helping you. This spot has been open six months and I have no idea how it's not more popular, but it's easily one of my favorite healthy eating options in town- and for once they have more than just salads and grilled protein bowls!

I wasn't feeling too well and was looking for a place that served a good soup. Their soup of the day was lentil and came with a slice of garlic bread. The soup had lentils, spinach, kale, onion, and lemon brewing at the front counter. The owner was very nice and explained how they made the soup as well as the other items on their menu. The owner even came outside and opened their umbrella so I could sit underneath and eat at the patio! Inside was very nice and I even saw a lady eating an acai bowl/cup which looked DELICIOUS! 

I'm giving 5 stars for the great food as well as the awesome customer service. The soup was very tasty as well as the slice of garlic bread (and I'm a very picky eater). None of the items had overpowering flavor and it was just enough for me!

3244383,2015-09-19,4,rzV_rHsRdbEtRwCKm8OoIg,"My best friend recently got married in Las Vegas. Like the geniuses that we are, we thought it be a great idea to host her 3 day bachelorette party the days immediately leading up to the wedding.
Spoiler alert- it wasn't the best idea we ever had.

Waking up the morning of the wedding, mascara smeared across my pillow and still wearing my  Britney Spears VEGAS BITCH shirt and spanx, I knew we needed a miracle to make it through this day.

The bride asked for one simple request: vegan parfaits. Spoiler alert part #2- those don't really exist anywhere except in my wildest dreams. I frantically scoured Yelp for a smoothie restaurant. Enter, Gourmet Quick Bite!

It's a short drive from the Strip and the have a variety of soups, wraps, etc. I was there for the smoothies and the acai bowls. The owner was super nice and friendly, and made the order as fast as he could. I am pretty sure they are only a 2 person operation, but he was not overwhelmed at all, nor scared off by my day 4 Vegas face. 

The smoothies were good, but the acai bowls were AMAZING! After drinking mainly vodka and diet coke for a few days it felt good to eat something that my body did not immediately want to reject.

Now i'm a fan of Canes's when it comes to chicken fingers and their sauce is to die for, but this place i must say is the place i'm going to be going to since Cane's is some distance away. The fries were great and seasoned well. There were other things on the menu that I will be trying seeing all the other reviews of people that had a great time as my wife and I did.

I ordered the stuffed sweet potatoes, and friends ordered the Holiday Turkey panini, and the quinoa/brown rice bowl with spinach stew. 

The sweet potato was good - not sure what I was expecting, but it was good. I'm glad I shared it with friends and tried other items.

The Holiday Turkey Panini was just okay and it was small. I wouldn't order again. It was ordinary deli turkey and the bread overwhelmed the flavor of the sandwich. It's possible if they added more turkey it would improve the sandwich. 

The quinoa/brown rice bowl with chicken and spinach stew was pretty good and the best value for your money. The onion sauce they give you to put on top of the spinach made it. The chicken was bland, so ask for chili/hot sauce. It comes with a side salad and it compliments the dish well.
