My boyfriends grandmother gave us gift cards to Chipotle so I thought why not go check out the newer one on eastern and Russell. I got a chicken bowl, my friend got the beef bowl. My food had zero flavor. I didn't even finish it. Later on we go to the mall. When we got home both of our stomachs both were hurting so bad. Both of us had nausea. We went around 5.

I always receive mediocre service when coming here. The workers aren't too friendly as far as greetings go. I'm usually in a rush so it doesn't bother me TOO much, but smiles are always a plus. What really irks me though is when I receive skimpy portions. I always have to shyly ask for more rice since they just scoop a small amount and spread it across my burrito bowl to make it seem like it is filled. I don't have this problem at any other Chipotle I've been to.

To make matters worse, the last time I came here, I had to wait for several items to be prepped! It's like the staff waited for everything to run out to refill everything, including the chicken, lettuce, and sour cream. Talk about being underprepared! Mind you, they weren't closing for a good two hours.

This location just opened up near my school which I THOUGHT was very convenient especially since I can order off my phone and select a time to pick it up...

So today a group of classmates and I ordered food for pick up and selected pick up time for 1:30. It was ready as soon as we got there which was good. So we sat down ready to eat. I ordered a burrito bowl with brown rice, no beans, fajitas, chicken, corn salsa, fresh tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese and guac. My classmate ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, fresh tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese & lettuce. Whoever made our order got it completely wrote. My bowl not only had beans in it but it had both pinto & black. Ummm.. Wtf?! Also it didn't have the fajitas. My classmates bowl had what seemed to be my missing fajitas but his bowl had no beans. So I'm guessing whoever made our bowls wasn't paying attention to what he or she was doing. Whatever. Easy mistake when it's busy right? Although I've been to busier Chipotles and have never had my order messed up.

Anyways, we realized our bowls were wrong & immediately brought them up to the front. The girl at the cash register was extremely rude. Clearly she was ignoring us as we stood in front of her for a good 2 minutes and she not once acknowledged us until I said EXCUSE ME. When I told her our bowls were messed up she sighed and rolled her eyes. Great customer service! NOT! She told one of her coworkers who came to help us. She was very nice & right away made is new bowls in the correct way. As for that other girl, learn to have some customer service!! 

Aside from the messed up order and rude employee the place is clean. There's plenty of places to sit inside & out. It's a chipotle so it gets busy during lunch. The shopping area in general is always busy.",9LUjipZxdqAVkGR5jg1AWQ,1,0,3,QdPgtjkVXIyT_CeSflQBjw

I have ordered from them a couple times and every time my food has come out correctly and I've had a staff member call me to make sure everything was to my liking.  On this most recent visit I read an old email that said my food wasn't going to be ready for another hour. I called and the lady let me know that it was actually for an earlier time. I felt so bad! Like how impatient did I sound to call 15 minutes after I put in an order. So the wait time was actually only about 15-20 minutes when I thought it was going to be an hour.

When I went into the store she was so appreciative that I actually communicated with them and she was so helpful. 

When you order lunch for a big office or not this is the key when you have a short lunch break.  There are two other chipotles that are actually slightly closer yet I find myself ordering from this one more.

The main reason I'm even writing this review for Chipotle, which is a chain restaurant, is because I think that their staff is exceptional. 

The ""she"" I've been referring to is a young bubbly employee named Grinesha who has helped me twice. And those times were only very brief. I just think that she has a wonderful work ethic and great attitude.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,0,1,5,lMyu63phvNqtKkXXKXYAlg
