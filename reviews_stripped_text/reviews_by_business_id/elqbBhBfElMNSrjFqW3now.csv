Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a ""Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?"" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after.

I wanted to get some food delivered for dinner, so I called the store around 4:35pm and they refused to take my order until 5pm (and then rudely hung up on me). Despite the attitude I decided to call back at exactly 5 to place my order, when the same rude woman picked up she told me that it would be at least 2 hours since they had 4 orders ahead of me.

I get the spicy mint chicken nearly every time I visit, and it's consistently delicious. Their spice scale is about the same as other Thai restaurants I've experienced --an 8 is sufficiently spicy, but not unbearable.

All of it delicious. Been meaning to try this place out for a while, had heard good things; really glad we did. They were very busy as it was Friday night, but the service was excellent, the food hot and delicious. The restaurant is located in what is essentially a strip mall so I wasn't expecting the elegant interior. Next time I'll get more adventurous with the menu, but they did really well with my favorites first time out of the gate. The fried rice was excellent,  with huge pieces of tender duck. The crab Rangoon were light, fluffy and crisp, as was the lemon chicken. The satay were very tender and tasty. I didn't risk the beef because AJ asked for the heat too be at 8-10.

The decor isn't quite as nice, but who really cares.  I had excellent spring rolls and green curry with tofu.  Just spicy enough and very flavorful.  Very good service also.

Unfortunately, not everyone was as pleased with the restaurant as I was!  This weird lady at the table next to me, eating alone, just had to inform the server that the soup was ""nice, but it's not worth 5 dollars"".  Then, when the server tried to take something, she said, ""Leave that please!""  I then heard her mumble, ""Get away from me!  Just get away!"".

In the restaurant though, is better, they serve it in a hot pot over a hot flame candle and for some reason I think the simple presentation of that alone makes the soup that much better lol.

I ordered takeout from them this week and had to wait 40 minutes after the time they said the food would be ready. There were a lot of people waiting for food and while I was waiting I heard several complaints from diners who received the wrong food.  Anyway once I got home with the food we found that the shrimp in the shrimp salad had not been cooked properly, the beef satay was extremely rare and the shrimp cakes were cold/uncooked. After calling to complain they said they would reverse the charge on my credit card.

I ordered the red curry that ended up being sweet milk and my wife ordered chili mint noodles (their version of drunken noodles) which was basically sweet fried tofu with barely any mint or chili.

We have tasted wonderful food in NYC, San Diego, Dallas and even Little Rock Arkansas and this was by far the worst Thai food we've had. As a vegetarian I would rate this pretty low.",G-4c_G7iXLbSVuMxa5t0IA,0,0,2,knxH2tEIIoXbMc_tg9082Q

141452,2011-10-29,0,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"This place has been busy whenever I've been. That is a bit surprising. The curries are disappointing. Are they making them overly creamy and bland to satisfy the white folks' palate? The green curry isn't even green! It's cream colored. Maybe she misheard me and thought I ordered a cream curry?! I ordered a heat level 9 and didn't feel any heat whatsoever, let alone break a sweat or get a runny nose; did they not believe I could handle the heat? Or maybe she misheard me again and thought I said five? Also, curries come with plain rice; if you want sticky rice, specify that you want that instead of plain rice; otherwise, you get both, which is a waste. 

The service was ok. 

I might go back for a soup or other non-curry dish, but for now, based on my non-green too-creamy curry, I can't go higher than ""Meh. I've experienced better."" I've actually made better green curry! 

This place is close to where I live, but I think I'll travel down to Sahara unless pressed for time to a more modest but more authentic place to get my Thai curry fix.  The gas money will be covered and then some in the price difference as well.",BJOLgnc5gtHlkwhBIqNW5Q,1,0,2,nFgWEuB-UF1sMXZsP-LCiw

This place has fast service.  My cachew chicken was brought out in under 5 minutes, hot and with a generous serving of sticky rice. I ordered medium spicy and it was about a two on a scale of five.

We ordered the Crying Tiger beef, catfish green curry, and chicken pad thai.    The crying tiger beef was ok -- it was basically a steak with a little heap of salad and a big wedge of cabbage.   The sauce was good, but we would have preferred if the steak were marinated in it more.  

Catfish Green Curry was pretty good, but a little salty.   Otherwise we would go back for that dish!

the Pad Thai was well, pitiful.   Cooked well, but hardly any flavor - not what one would expect from pad thai.     Added some of our own lime juice (it did not come with any lime) which made it more palatable.   Needed more sauce and it would have been good.

Strap in and buckle down for some spicy soup served in a bowl that is literally on fire (get either the Wor Wonton or the Tom Yum Koong -- though my dad just describes these as the soups with the shrimp and the spicy and the lettuce). Ordered:

Chicken Sat Tay -- Delicious! Only comes with four though, might want to get more.

Masaman with Tofu, level 6 -- Not that spicy. Could have definitely added a few notches to get a real kick in the face. 

Chicken BBQ -- I'm not a big fan of this but everyone else gulped it down. I just think it's not spicy enough. 

Spicy, soup, with the shrimp and the noodle things -- as my dad called it. I have no idea what the waitress brought (I think one of the wonton soups), but it was pretty tasty. The wonton soups don't give you a lot of shrimp so if your taste buds are flamingo-like in tendency you should order the Tom Yum Koong. 

All very good. Top it off with a Thai Ice Tea that could only be better if someone could figure out how to put alcohol in it. Kahula maybe? Cheers!",BMEmpeosi4LfwRlAMgtjbg,0,0,4,x-zvUVO3-wyIA01gHgqhWA

The portions were decent and the price came to about $50 bucks with desert and three drinks. The price seemed reasonable. I was satisfied with both the service and the value.

Having company policies about which ingredients are allowed and which aren't is absurd. We didn't even stay to attempt to eat, why should I pay for a meal that is made the way the cook wants to make it rather than the way I want to eat it.",GTSv5QBAjgtTzWX1vB6gpw,0,0,1,1z_7Ct-mBT87WQIfxceimw

You have to order the crab rangoon and the seasonal pumpkin curry. Solid on every regular Thai staple. Their Thai iced tea is everything you want it to be.

The prices may be slightly higher than other Thai places, but you're paying for consistent quality across the menu and way better ambiance than the competitors, full of wood paneling, Asian screens, and mood lighting. Good place to take out a visitor that's relaxed but not too casual (dumpy) (I'm talking about Mix Zone).

471872,2010-12-22,0,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"Pin-Kaow is a pretty good Thai restaurant in the middle of a not very good-looking plaza.  First, I will note that, as is common with Vegas restaurants, it's not the cheapest Thai restaurant.  However, they always seem to be busy, and you can see why with the quality of the food (I've had the yellow and massaman curries and the spicy eggplant with tofu - the yellow curry was passable, and the massaman curry and spicy eggplant were fantastic).  I'd say it's one of the few places in Las Vegas where the quality of the food actually reflects the price.  Now, keeping that in mind, the best Thai food I've ever had cost me $6 and I would've easily paid $20 for it. 

Overall, even though it's not quite ""As Good as it Gets"" for a 5-star rating, Pin-Kaow makes for a nice but still affordable Thai option in Las Vegas, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice evening out.",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,2,1,4,GrA-LIZCF38LJa706Rq3OQ
481821,2013-03-12,0,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"I've been to and have worked in many different restaurants over the years and I can honestly attest that the 1974 N. Rainbow location (one of several in town) of Pin Kaow Thai Restaurants is among not only the best Thai restaurants I've been to, but among the best restaurants overall that I've enjoyed.
     Right off the bat one refreshing thing about Pin Kaow is its location. On the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow Blvd it's a location convenient enough to save anyone from my side of town (NW side) a trip all the way down to Spring Mountain road or ""Chinatown"" where most of the cities sought after authentic Asian restaurants are located. There's also plenty of parking out front, a nice change of pace that you don't usually get with most Spring Mountain restaurants.  It can be hard to spot at night however so I would just remind people that it is directly across the street from a ""Joes Crab Shack"" and has a large ""Windmill Water Refilling"" station in the front parking lot.
     The overall appearance of the restaurant inside is very clean and very nice. With wall to wall teak wood furniture, comfortable dim lighting, traditional Thai décor including floral arrangements and an average restaurant noise level, Pin Kaow feels very warm, comfortable and inviting. It's the kind of restaurant that makes you and your party lose track of the time and simply enjoy each other's company. 
     Service at Pin Kaow based on our experience has been great. Immediately upon entering you're greeted by the very friendly and energetic hostess staff wearing traditional Thai costume who after seating you will sometimes deliver you your drink order (if the servers are busy).  The Servers are also polite and knowledgeable with the menu, and thankfully will talk certain patrons out of ordering beyond their capabilities when it comes to the spicy levels of the food (levels 1-10).  
     Last but not least the menu. With all of the positives this place has going for it, if the food wasn't up to par, I simply would not go. But the food however is GREAT, and comparable to any other Thai restaurant in town, including those located on Spring Mountain rd. I would recommend starting with the chicken skewers served with a side of peanut sauce, followed by an entrée of either the beef Pad Thai or Cashew Chicken, finished with a dessert of Sticky Rice with Mango then washed down with happy hours two for one ""Chang"" brand Thai beers.",S9jhKWTU4Ri4v7XV_4vL0Q,0,0,5,5UMXtppw9iHir06Fu3AhZg

We visited Friday night with the wonton soup hotpot in mind....because I had been sick I thought that the soup would be good for my sore throat.

We did call ahead.  Alway recommended because this place gets busy.  It always seems to have people waiting outside on the weekends.  When we got there we were seated almost immediately even though alot of people were waiting-thats why I recommend the call ahead.

We ordered the wonton soup hot pot.  If you havent had the hot pot before it is a pot with a hole in the middle where they light a running flame.  I would say its for two people but probably could feed four.  The first time I had this I was so impressed.  It just sets an ambiance...an experience.  You definitely must try it.

For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Probably the best I have ever had that I order it everytime I come here.  I order the spicy at an 8 or 9 and never seems too spicy to eat.  Especially if my BF can eat it.  He ordered the mongolian beef.  It is always great too.  It is different from other mongolian beefs I have had....the sauce is more like a gravy consistency.  But it is good.  All paired off with a glass of chardonney and the night was bliss. 

This is a great place for a date, for a group, for a celebration.  It is a Thai experience.  So if you are trying to impress someone it would be a good spot to take them.  Like I said the service is hit and miss.  I do recommend the take out.  They have a little section in the back where they do the to-go orders and I have never had a problem.  In and out.  Food is just as good as eating in.  This place isnt very close to home but I will drive for the occasional Thai fix! ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,1,4,EDgn3NVaNDMxcRHFx1La_g

The rice noodles had a nice balance of sweet and sour, and were very light.

On the down side the amount of meat placed in the dishes is stingy to the point my friends and I went to 168 for a whole duck and picked dishes from here as sides. For example the tom yung koong they put 8 shrimp which sounds like a lot but really isn't and if you want more they charge $1.50 per shrimp. They won't even add extra duck to any of the duck orders. The pork fried rice had less than 1 ounce of pork in it. At that rate what's the point of calling it pork or chicken or whatever meat you get in the dish because there is barely any meat. 

That's why this deserves 3 stars instead of 4. If you are a meat eater don't expect to get much from this place; however if you are fine with that then expect a flavorful experience.",gMMsJxNIZ4FM48kIobwYtg,0,0,3,8NA1rBqps1jSkKyiyCPOtg

I can't really put my finger on what it is that's missing from their food but it doesn't have the depth of flavor that I'm used to from places like Komol and Lotus.

The curry was bland, tasted watery... Papaya salad tasted like they just shredded the papaya and tossed a few times around the sauce...pad Thai was bland as well.. We didn't finished eating because of the lack of flavor.. I guess you can say, being southeast asian, we're used to a more savory, rich in spices flavors and pretty particular. But we understand the lack of spices can be due to pin kaow catering to mostly non Asian diners, sorry to be so blunt.. However, adding more spices doesn't mean the food should be spicy, just more rich coconut milk in the curry, fish sauces, lime leaves and lemongrass, which are essential in southeast Asian cuisines,, 

Service was great! But the food missed the mark for us...",VmoOSh9f3g7-NXqxGWbieg,1,2,2,KBjrJ9gkXpcnyDgeDHZa0w

About half of that was spent in Okinawa, and we were TDY to Thailand almost half of that.  I could speak passable Thai at one time, and even though my accent now is terrible (Thai is a tonal language, so accent and inflection are essential) when I don't even look a the menu and order in Thai, I expect something authentic.  I ordered papaya salad with sticky rice and pahd see yew.  Both came out bland, and the Nam Phrik had jalapenos and not ki noo peppers.  Lotus of Siam made this same mistake.

The Masaman was okay, nice curry flavor, definitely could have gotten it more spicy (6 was too low) especially because it was a fairly sweet (as in taste) dish. The pad thai I thought was disappointing because it was VERY greasy/oily. There was a film all over the plate and you couldn't eat the noodles without getting the oil/grease everywhere. The serve was excellent though. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The thai iced coffee and tea were both good.

     I used to love coming here. It was one of my absolute favorite Thai restaurants in town. After yesterday's event, I will never be back. My girlfriend and I stopped by Pin Kaow for lunch where we both had the pumpkin Thai curry (my absolute all time favorite dish from here). I got my usual shrimp curry and my friend got chicken curry. We noticed as we were eating the squash was undercooked and there were hardened pieces we had to pick out. The dish was also served warm and not hot. We ate around 1230 and left around 1pm. I live about 6 minutes from the restaurant and my stomach was intensely cramping the whole way home. I literally had to run to the bathroom when I got in.

Though it's located in a strip mall, the interior décor is quite nice, and the service was on point throughout our visit: attentive, polite, and professional. I was impressed before we even got to the food.

Started with the Fishcakes app- $8. Good portion for the price, cakes weren't too greasy and seemed meatier than others we've had. Herbs and seasonings were mixed into the patties, making them quite flavorful. The cucumber salad was also fresh and flavorful, perfectly complement to the cakes.
Shared the hotpot of tom kha kai soup- $12. Large hot pot serving is good for us, since we love this soup. First impression of the dish was that it was incredibly well balanced. The broth was super flavorful, and there was a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro in the soup itself.
Lastly, we split the duck curry entrée- $14. As my BF put it, ""This is possibly the best curry I've ever had."" The duck was perfectly cooked, the curry sauce was amazing, and the pineapple and peppers worked well to bring the dish together. Portion was a good size, and came with a small side of white rice. The only change I might make to this dish would possibly be to add more veggies to it.

All in all, dinner with tip was just over $40 for two on a Friday night. Service was impeccable, food was flavorful and well balanced, and this is definitely a place I'd go back to- Vegas has a lot of good Thai restaurants, but this one has all of the elements to make it stand out as great.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,0,4,QJXLxL9sLRp2nwYNrWcsMw

1829185,2011-03-29,0,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"Once upon a time, during a quick trip to Vegas, I was determined to find great Thai food outside of California (specifically Hollywood/No Ho).  After much research, I was set on treating a very special man in my life (and extremely picky Thai food eater) to the much lauded Lotus of Siam.  However, being in the neighborhood, we decided to grab a bite at Pin-Kaow, and we were not disappointed.  Located in an unassuming strip mall off Rainbow & Lake Mead, the sign for Pin-Kaow, in big bold caps, is definitely not hard to miss.  However, for those unfamiliar with great Thai food, it may be easy to overlook.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were impressed with the elaborate traditional design.  Think intricately carved, polished wood, and slightly dim lighting.  Classy enough for a lovely dinner date, yet casual enough for quick daytime lunch.  This was exactly the kind of place  we had opted for.

We were seated promptly and given several different menus, one of which was for their lunch specials.  We both went with entrees and ended up ordering a bowl of boat noodles, red curry with chicken, nam kao tod  and spicy chili mint noodles.  Everything was ordered at a level of 7 or 8 spiciness, but be cautious with this spice level, as some dishes were spicier than others.  The boat noodles and curry were good and satisfied a craving, as did the spicy chili mint noodles.  The portions were big enough for two people with big appetites (or as my boyfriend would say, ""big enough to feed a small family."")  However, what really made a big impression on us was the nam kao tod!  If you've never ordered this, you're missing out.  It's basically a crispy rice salad with sour sausage, cashews, lime juice, chili flakes, and other elements of deliciousness.  The texture, and bold flavor were a perfect complement to a sunny vegas afternoon in Spring.  Neither of us ordered from the drink menu, but they seem to have a nice beer selection for a reasonable price.

All in all, although I have yet to try the critically acclaimed ""Lotus"" in Vegas, Pin-Kaow is a nice (and more cost effective!) alternative.",TxWBHR4WE4BmIRtlgFYaWg,0,0,4,JzAjgjZS7qBHV0rr3fKu2A

To be fair, the place looks very pretty inside since the renovations, and the waitresses now wear traditional Thai attire, which is very cool.  
But the food portions are MUCH smaller, and the food quality seems to have suffered a bit, as well. (perhaps the customers are now paying for the cost of renovations?) The Thai tea tasted like regular iced tea mixed with coffee, and nutrasweet. The spring rolls were lackluster and kind of pasty inside, and the chicken soup was VERY salty, which is a complaint that I rarely ever have, seeing as how I'm a card carrying salt fiend that has actually been known to add salt to TOAST. (I shit you, not.)
The Pad See Ew and Pad Prik King were both TINY. 
No, seriously....both were itty-bitty, teensy-weensy portions....maybe a cup worth of food per entree, at most. And honestly, the food just doesn't seem to be anywhere near as flavorful as it used it be. It was just kind of bland.

The Red Curry itself was on the thicker side and of medium sweetness. A little cheap on the Tofu and heavy on the Bamboo Shoots, though. Got it as part of the lunch special (7.95) which came with a spring roll, crab rangoon and a free cup of soup. The soup was a broken rice chicken soup - unfortunately it was very salty, and the spring roll was fresh but standard issue - nothing special. 

Enjoyed the Red Curry, but was most taken aback by the surprise +$3 charge for each Brown Rice substitution. Our bill showed up with two lunch specials and a +$6 charge for two Brown Rice substitutions. The Manager offered to remove one of the rice charges, which was reasonable, considering the waitress did not mention that there would be an upcharge. I do consider +$3 for a Brown Rice substitution a deal-breaker when it comes to lunch specials, especially when there are many similar Thai options at around $7-8, all-in. 

Dinner prices are $10-13 for the curries, and based on our experience today, expect to pay at least $3 for Brown Rice. If you happen to ask for a little more rice, I bet they ring you up for another $3 cup.

I would like to try their Massaman curry, as our waitress said it is her favorite.

I ordered a level 4 spice but I think the young Miss taking my order skipped that bit of information because my dish lacked spice completely.  This could have been a total taste-bud disaster but luckily the noodles were flavored to perfection, spice-less and all.

Then when I asked for a sauce to cover up the mushrooms to lessen the taste, she refused.  * About six months later I gave them a second chance because my girlfriend likes a certain dish they make.

The restaurant is located in a commercial strip on the southeast corner of Rainbow & Lake Mead. The space is fairly large with teak tables & accents. I've eaten here at least ten times during the past five years.  

My favorite dish is the larb gai (chopped chicken) with fresh veggies.  It's served with lettuce leaves to eat as a wrap. I order it as an off-menu item entrée. The entrée will come with a serving of deliciously fragrant Thai rice. Spicy  larb gai and cold  Singha ( Thai beer) is a great pairing.

Yesterday, my family of nine decided to meet up here for lunch. I enjoyed the  Pad Thai lunch  w/ tofu special.  The dish- Rice noodles sautéed with bean sprouts, green onion, egg and crushed peanuts in Thai special recipe. Delicious! My meal is prepped at an eight spice level (one  to ten spice scale), gage it, and add more chili, if needed. Yes, I like my food spicy.  An egg drop soup is served for starters. Fantastic lunch deal for $8.95.

My husband had to wait an additional 25 mins then has the nerve to say he will not charge us for the Pot Stickers which are $7.95, which is the cheapest item we ordered and our order total was $61.43.

The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is that it was quite a wait to get our food, even though it's a small restaurant.  We waited about 30 mins after we ordered for our food to come out, and all 3 dishes came out separate.

Don't let that discourage you though! The pot-stickers were the best I've had. Both our dishes were great, and we even split a jasmine tea that finished the meal perfectly.

It was fairly cheap, especially for the food you're getting. They're not huge portions, but not small either, just the right size.

2852039,2014-08-20,2,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"Family and I have been going to Pin Kaow for years, and it was always one of our go-to Thai restaurants in Las Vegas!

Was in Las Vegas last weekend for a friend's wedding, but I had time to go grab lunch with my parents at Pin Kaow in the Northwest part of town off of Lake Mead and Rainbow. We ordered from the lunch menu special. I got the red curry with chicken, and my parents got the pad thai with beef and the basil chicken. Each of the lunch specials is between $8-10, depending on the type of meat that you get with it. Beef and seafood are a little bit more expensive, while chicken and tofu fall on the cheaper end.

We also got a couple appetizers - the fish cake ($8.95), as well as the chicken satay ($8.95). My dad is a huge fan of both of these dishes, and we've been ordering them since I was a little kid. The fish cake is served with the thai sweet chili sauce with the cucumber, which you should put on top of your fish cake. So yummy! The chicken satay has the peanut sauce on the side, which we are also huge fans of. We also ordered a couple drinks, and with tax, lunch came out to about $50 for 3 people, so not too shabby at all.

The 800 other times we have been here, we have also ordered things like the beef rad nar, which has the thicker noodles with beef, broccoli and a gravy sauce. We also like the mint chicken, shrimp pad thai, and yellow curry. I always get my dishes with a spice level of 5 (on a 10 point scale) and it is just right. 

Now if you ask me where it falls on the scale of best Thai restaurants, I have to give the nod to Lotus of Siam first (5-star), and then it's a close decision between Pin Kaow and Archi's. I may have to give the nod to Archi's here though, because their flavor and spices seem to be a little bit better than Pin Kaow. Nonetheless, it is still a great option. The service here is better than Archi's and other Thai restaurants, and the ambience is terrific. It's also conveniently located about 2 miles away from my parent's house and was always the most feasible option for us.

I've always done take out but the restaurant is always busy and has a nice ambiance to it. 

The bill came to $75 and we ordered the green papaya salad (legit but small), shrimp egg rolls (to die for), steamed sea bass, pad Thai with shrimp (very tasty), red curry with chicken (good flavor, dry overcooked chicken --precooked?).

But, it's true that only about 7 miles from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip exists a wonderful oasis of Thai food with quiet, casual ambiance. 

I found myself really enjoying the peace and serenity of the Pin Kaow food. We had the Red Curry and the Pad Thai which come on a 1-10 scale v the traditional 1-4 or 1-5. I would recommend ordering higher than normal unless you want bland food. The Pad Thai is a toolkit v a completed dish. The nuts come on the side v being cooked into the dish. I found this odd. Understandably, people have food allergies, but usually the question can be asked if the server feels the diner may be unable to read. Whateva, I assembled the Pad Thai. 

The curry was a winner, solid 5 star. I will absolutely be back to the wonderful little establishment. (Apparently, there are now 3!)

I'm a Le Thai, Lotus and Nittaya's fan, but Pin Kaow does the trick in a pinch.  Their spice levels are kind of weak (however, I find that a 3 at one Thai restaurant is a 7 at another...for here, a 5 seems to be a 1), so if you want a kick go higher than you would elsewhere.  My favorite here is the Chili Mint Noodles and then sticky rice with coconut sauce for dessert.  I've tried several other menu options, which for the most part were all very flavorful but it was about texture for me.  Their dicing and chopping tends to be chunkier than other Thai spots I've hit and I'd prefer smaller bits, but that's just me.

Luckily there wasn't a wait, so we were seated right away. We actually had a problem with the first table we were seated at because the sun was shining through the blinds and burning our eyes, so we asked to move somewhere else. They moved us over to a better spot near the back that was half booth, half chairs. 

Whenever I go out with my boyfriend and his family, we always get a lot of food, so I made sure to starve myself almost all day and by the time we got there I was ready to attack the food! 

We ordered:
Spring rolls
Crab rangoon 
Garlic beef - cabbage & broccoli with sauteed meat in garlic sauce
Cashew nut chicken - sauteed cashew nut, dried chili w/ Thai chili sauce
Chicken Panang curry - Thai special curry paste with coconut milk, green beans, basil leaves and lime leaves
Shrimp Red Curry - red Thai special curry paste with coconut mik, bamboo shoot and Thai basil leaves
Spare Ribs - Spare ribs marinated in Thai BBQ sauce
Chicken pad Thai - rice noodles sauteed with bean sprout, egg and crushed peanuts in Thai special recipe
Chow mein - stir fried soft yellow noodle with mixed vegetables
And of course, about 3 large orders of white rice

Our appetizers came out quick. They were both okay, nothing special though. I mean, how can you really make spring rolls and crab rangoons sensory explosive anyhow?

All of our food started coming out and that's when I said to myself,  ""Oh yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about."" All the plates looked so good.I didn't even know where to start, so I just started with everything. 

The garlic beef was delish. I love almost everything with garlic, so that wasn't a surprise. The cashew chicken was good. The chicken Panang curry was almost orgasmic. Almost is a good thing though, since I was with my boyfriend's family! The shrimp red curry was interesting. I guess I'm not much of a seafood curry fan, but at least I gave it a try. Mmmm, that spare ribs were scrumptious! So tender and juicy! The chicken pad Thai was pretty bomb. It had lots of crushed peanuts, which I liked. 

The whole time we were eating, which was about an hour, the waitress made sure to keep our water glasses filled and would ask how we liked our food. We never had to ask for anything, except lemons to clean our hands at the end because we're Filipino. 

All in all, I really enjoyed this place. I'm glad they opened a location on S. Rainbow, because that's a 2 minute drive from my house.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,3,4,EHizslMht__qeLTybWInRQ

2987014,2013-01-09,2,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"I just moved to Las Vegas with my girlfriend. We decided to get some takeout from Pin Kaow based on a glowing recommendation.

I regret that I cannot echo this recommendation. The woman who took our order looked annoyed at our very presence. I asked her a few friendly questions about takeout, delivery, and some menu options. She seemed exasperated and simultaneously bored. I didn't even know a person could experience that blend of emotions. Thank you, Pin Kaow, for a lesson in the breadth of the human experience. 

I asked her how long delivery would take and she replied 2 hours. I wish that were an exaggeration. Needless to say, we ordered takeout instead and waited around for 20 minutes. 

Here's what we ordered:
- Fresh Spring Rolls.
- Chicken Pad Thai, with a 7 on the spicy meter.
- Pad Woon Sen, with a 5 on the spicy meter.

And here's what my takeout boxes contained:
- Fried Egg Rolls (seriously...?)
- Chicken Pad Thai, with a 1 on the spicy meter.
- Pad Woon Sen, with a 3 on the spicy meter.

The food was decent but unimpressive, especially for the price ($29 after tip). The egg rolls were a little rubbery, like they came out of a microwave... and I didn't even ORDER egg rolls.

The pad thai was yummy, but when you're really hungry, everything tastes good. It lacked a certain richness of flavor I have come to expect from pad thai dishes. 

My girlfriend's pad woon sen was good. No qualms there, aside from the spicyness not being correct. I would have given them a free pass on this since there is a degree of subjectivity, but it wasn't even close.

I read on the menu that there are three different Pin Kaow locations. I am willing to give the other locations a chance, but I will not be visiting this specific Pin Kaow again.",SeHCgDpSzPhPO2BsqdW1rg,3,1,2,pMRmXiM-ev6kdffkiVRHww

A friend of my wife's invited us and a few of her co workers to Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant on the corner of Rainbow and Lake Mead. It was very easy to find off 95. Its about a 10-15 minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip. 

The location of the restaurant, is on the corner of lake mead and rainbow, which was an easy access to get in, but from the looks of it, its kind of hard to get out. Since its right next to the stop light and, for those who want to get on Rainbow, its kind of busy intersection, not unless you get on lake mead, going the opposite way to make a u-turn some where later and get on Rainbow. 

The set up of the restaurant is nice, but it could probably be more spacious if they use a little bit less tables to move around. Mainly, i keep tapping the other table with my leg or bottom and saying excuse me a lot cause the tables are so close together, and I'm not really that big. 

The staff, was very pleasant, very well dressed in their Thai uniform and made sure that we were happy with our stay. Knowing that it is lunch time, I'm sure it was kind of busy for them to get out orders. So I probably wouldn't hold that against them, knowing its during the busy hours. They were fully staff to make sure everyone is helped and that they got to us as soon as they can. I would probably say 5-10 minutes would be a decent time to be waiting during busy hours. They seem to make it in between those times to meet my needs. 

The food itself was unique. But I have to say, its been a while since I had spicy food, so it didn't really set well with me. My wife ordered some chicken entree and shared it with her. We thought it would be a big serving, but it was an average serving for one person. But over all it was good to have something different. I did love their fried shrimp appetizer that had cream cheese in them and of course the egg rolls were great.  I did love the dessert of, Fried Banana and Coconut Ice Cream, it did make me love the place even more.  

Over all, I would probably say, this was a decent place to have lunch. If your into spicy food and something unique, then its a must go place to eat. The appetizers are great, as well as dessert.  But I would suggest to go during the slow hours, cause getting out and trying to get back onto 95 or Rainbow. it's better to find an alternate route, or wait till some one is nice enough to let you into traffic.

I'm obsessed with the spicy basil lunch special. Don't be deceived by the small serving plates, this is a gigantic lunch. I always have to take half to go. Lunch specials come with soup to start (usually some sort of chicken or tofu soup), egg roll or salad, and some other fried pocket thing that I can't identify but tastes good. 

I must admit that I do wish that they took my requests for a spicy level 10 seriously. It's like they just roll their eyes and give me a 5. If you ask for the spice rack though you can add extra spice as you please. You know what makes up for this? Extra cold beers. They serve the beers with a frozen mug. I've even had a server suggest I get two small beers instead of one large one so I can keep them as cold as possible. How considerate!

We walked in and were impressed by the atmosphere - on the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but it's decorated beautifully and looks very modern inside. Unfortunately, the food is just not up to par and I was very disappointed.

I ordered chicken pad thai at a 6, my usual order. It came and was definitely not a 6 - tasted more like a 3 or 4. It was so dry...didn't taste fresh to me and I kind of think it was reheated- it came out so quickly, less than 10 minutes after we ordered, and the restaurant was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon. There was hardly any chicken in it, and the chicken that was in there was all gristle! It was DISGUSTING. I ate maybe 1/4 of my dish and ended up spitting out most of the chicken, which is not really my favorite thing to be seen doing in a restaurant. 

Service was good, though nobody questioned why my meal was practically untouched. They bring out oranges when you're finished which is a lovely gesture, but I can't see myself returning. I really hope to find a better Thai place!",jHN9V2Wr54ItVRrLBRaJQw,3,1,1,yYUmFKf23-1QtZPgrMFUuQ

I ordered the vegetable panang curry and chicken mint noodles. I asked the waitress how much it would be to substitute the brown rice for the white rice that comes with the panang curry and she said it was the same price as the side order. This made no sense so I asked the ""manager"" about the policy and all she said was yes brown rice 3 dollars. If you are a manager of a establishment where your customers are primarily American you need to know how to communicate in English. After having my first bite of the panang curry I could tell Pin Kaow serves Americanized Thai food. I should have known when I walked in and did not see once person of Asian decent. Back to the panang curry; it tasted like I was having straight up butter with minimal spice on top of my rice. The mint noodles tasted good but also overly sweet to appeal to the American customer. The noodles sat on a bed of wilted romaine lettuce which made the dish unappealing. The only plus is that they serve brown rice but I will not be back because the manager cannot explain the policies and the food is one dimensional and completely Americanized.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,2,1,2,m5aySrIRN719kOmRCiI2aA

The food was as good as I remembered it to be, and I think it's the best, authentic Thai food I've had so far in Vegas (I have yet to try Lotus of Siam). 

The restaurant is kind of dim due to their dark wooden walls, but they do use a lot of bright lighting to compensate. We ordered the ginger dish with scallops (spicy level 6), chicken with spicy basil (spicy level 3), and pad Thai (spicy level 3) lunch specials. The lunch specials include soup and your choice of salad or an egg roll plus a fried wonton. All the dishes were really good, and the portions were bigger than I expected. I wish we upped the spicy levels on the dishes however, as even the 6 wasn't that spicy. 

Food came out really slow. It took over 15 minutes to get our soup, and another 20 minutes to get our entrees. Server never informed us that the food would take awhile, and it wasn't even that busy. I don't mind if the food takes awhile as long as we're informed (kitchen is slammed or the restaurant is short-staffed) so minus a star for being left hanging. 

Because the food is really good and the prices/portions are reasonable, I'll be back if I'm ever in the mood for Thai food.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,8,6,4,aM76fCGlpcwuw7OnF4Uesw

In fact one dish I can't recall but it had some kind of ground meat in it...(which the menu didn't mention) was downright disgusting. Other dishes like duck curry are a delight. It's not the best thai beef salad I've ever had, but all of the curry dishes and most of the other thai standards are terrific. I love the whole fish and the papaya salad! Beware of spice levels in the salad. Even a 2 is mouth-scorching. While I order the curries and other dishes at 5 or even 6, I stick to 1 on the salads.

Let me start by saying what I don't like at Pin Kaow.  Their curry is not very good.  I don't know what flavor it is that sets me off, but it reminds me of uncooked flour.  I actually can't stand the flavor.  The other thing at Pin Kaow that is horrible is their chicken.  I don't know if they age their chicken before serving it or what.  Their chicken has a strange texture and is quite flavorless, unless, of course, you love the flavor of uncooked flour.

Authentic?  I hope not
Now let's talk about what is good.  Their Thai beef jerky is addicting to the Nth degree.  If you've never had Thai beef jerky, you must try it.  It is one of the best foods in the world.  They take strips of beef and dry them and then, the best part, they deep fry them.  It's served with a sweet and spicy sauce.  It's truly a mouth orgasm that you have to experience.

The other item that I recommend is the Tom Ka Koon, a delicious spicy soup made with coconut milk and shrimp.  The Tom Ka at Pin Kaow has an amazing complex flavor that only comes with good Thai food.  It's another must try.

That's it.  That's all I ever get and all I ever need to get.  As far as I'm concerned, Pin Kaow should change its name to Thai Beef Jerky and Tom Ka Koon store.  Delicious!",pd5ouypeFcAlLEZ25o2uBg,1,1,3,4jC8T8eJsK3E9Gz7MtwOdg

The food is what brings us back. It is amazing! Based on my body's response, I don't think they add MSG.

You order your level of spicy taste. I recommend starting low and adding as you become familiar with their system. I enjoy food at around a 7. My wife likes her's at level 4.

So I was staying at the courtyard across the street - ish... and saw this place a few times in the days I was running around. Kind of in the mood for some Thai- so I thought what the heck?!  I parked in the parking lot and headed in. They have quiet a bit of neon in the windows, blacked out by the way, and somehow got the impression this was  going to be kind of dumpy. BOY WAS I WRONG!! 

I walked in to get an order to go and was immediately greeted with 2 lovely women with smiles on their face saying ""welcome"". The place was absolutely beautiful incredibly clean, and beautifully put together!... This would definitely be someplace that I would go on date night! Really nicely put together. I told them I wanted to take an order to go, and was directed to the back bar ( I LOVE THIS, because who want to have date night with to go orders staring you in the face the whole night... awesome idea to do it that way). I got to the back bar and the Woman taking my order was awesome! I wanted to get the pad Thai minus egg and some spring rolls. All vegan by the way... They have a ton of vegan options on the menu. Anyway, she was super happy to replace the egg with tofu and no extra cost! She even asked if I wanted the fish sauce... Just in case on the side!!! How awesome is that. Anyway she rang me up and Then asked me if I wanted a glass of water with lemon as I waited. It was only gonna take about 10 minute she said. That was super impressive, I mean how many times have you gone to a restaurant and they offer you a glass of water while you're waiting for your to go food?... I'll answer that, NEVER! 

OK so then while I was waiting I popped into the ladies room. It was absolutely immaculate even the trashcan was wiped down! Not to mention there was about a dozen fresh roses next to the sink ( photo included ) .  

Came back to wait for my order, I was immediately greeted with a glass of water with ice and lemon... And about two minutes later with my order. Total waiting time from order to delivery was about five minutes!   
I had it finish my glass of water yet so the woman delivering my food offered it to put it in a to go cup! I mean how nice is that. I didn't need to need the to go cup and just drink it there. 

When I left about two or three people said thank you so much for coming, thank you so much, thank you... And actually looked me in the face when They said it. 

From the time I walked in the time that I left I felt that I was appreciated I felt like I was noticed I felt like they really really wanted me to come back again and again because of this absolutely wonderful service!

Pin Kaow has a nice atmosphere when you walk inside, but being seated is another story. That seemed to be something more of a, ""is there someone who will help me?"" situation.

It wasn't particularly busy on a Monday night, but by the speed of the service you'd have thought otherwise. Our server didn't understand our order of edamame and two chicken Pad Thais originally so we went over it in detail again. Not that big of a deal, but the edamame took over twenty minutes to reach the table. 

In the mean time the table to the right of us mentioned their calamari being too fishy and asked for spring rolls to substitute. That was receive before any of our order and the table to the left had an issue with the size of the soup they ordered (they wanted two bowls, not two cups). It took around 45 minutes to receive the order of Pad Thai which was just okay.

Afterwards I did not feel well and without sharing too much information, would not recommend this restaurant. There's a decent amount that could be said about the service, but I don't want to put it all on our waitress.

Food - Some of our favorite dishes are the Pad Thai Tofu, Pad See Ew, Spicy Chicken Curry.  For appetizers, we enjoy the Sweet & Sour Cucumbers and the Edamame.  When you order your entree, you tell the waiter how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the spiciest level.  I generally get a 5 or 6.

Service - The employee to customer ratio in this restaurant is pretty high.  My guess is that they don't make very much in terms of an hourly wage.  Either way, the service is always good.

Atmosphere:
The lighting was pretty dim, which was fine. We were confused at first because it was empty and dark, we thought it was closed. A waitress popped out from the back and seated us. 

Food:
I'm not that into pad thai, but once in awhile I'll get a craving. I decided to give it a try and satisfy my craving. It was okay, not ""omg I need to have it again,"" but I probably won't need to have it again for awhile. They ask the scale of spiciness you want 1-10. I decided to get a 6 so there would be a little bit of kick, but not too much. I didn't really notice the spice when I ate it. 

My friend thoroughly enjoyed his eggplant plate if you're in the mood for something different!

I think I'll come here again and try the curry.

After ten impatient minutes of being on hold multiple times, I ordered Pad Thai and Rad Na. They said it'll take an hour. AN HOUR. Ridiculous waiting time.

My food finally arrived within the expected delivery time. Pad Thai is my absolute favorite Thai dish, and you can never go wrong with it, but they managed to do so. It was completely dry and lacked flavor. They didnt even throw in a complimentary lime for my noodles (i love lime). My starving self couldn't even finish a third of my entrée before I threw it out. My boyfriend had the Rad Na, his favorite, which wasn't necessarily great either. Rad Na is listed under the noodles section of the menu, which its supposed to be a noodle dish made with vegetables and gravy. But what we got was a dish of gravy with very, very little noodle. I mean, we didn't order a soup dish, so I'd expect a lot more noodles for my noodle entrée.

My total was $28 without gratuity I included.  The shrimp rolls were very good and I thought I got a very good portion with the price I paid.  I wished the orange sauce was not so watery though because every time I dipped the shrimps in the sauce the sauce did not stick.  My pad thai was okay.  It seemed like the shrimp had been overcooked and like the pad thai had been sitting for a long time.  The noodles were thinner then what I am used too; the noodles taste the same but I still enjoy them thicker.  This pad thai killed my craving but it wasn't that good of pad thai to be honest.

Rewind to the beginning of the night after making our selections, our soup Tom - Ka - Koong was first on the table. 

A rich blend of lemon grass soup, coconut & galanga root, light on the palate, explosive in taste. Although the mushroom & shrimp were more of an after thought in the soup, it doesn't stop you from appreciating this elixir of yum! If anything I'd like to have the soup bottled to go & drink it like water!

As our entrees trickled in, the Thai BBQ chicken in first, followed by Black Bean Scallop...

My jaw-dropped in epic disappointment as I gazed at the dish, which was poorly plated not a single sense of appeal to it, like cheap chopsuey. For $15 you'd expect to see some effort into it...

Fast forward we continued dinner at home with a bottle merlot to boot. The house wasn't that far so our dishes were still fairly warm. As we sunk our teeth into what seemed like Thai BBQ chicken jerky. The meat was dry of epic proportions! Wherein we forced it down with the merlot. Taste-wise it seems all of it had dissipated.

Black bean scallops...not even a hint of black bean sauce, it just tasted like cheap chopsuey. The scallops were cooked well, soft & melts in your mouth. Poorly executed dish.",kQBm9uDYVv_1cg34uu802g,1,2,2,396_YDpDXsCqUAQDtsRFTQ

The minced chicken and anything they do in this fashion I find to be good. Not the best, but good. Flavor won't blow you away but prices are normal.

My boss and I went there many times for lunch when the mortgage office was just around the corner (so convenient). The entire costumed staff (in very ornate and eye popping colors BTW, so pretty) is very nice and take care of you right away (the growing line permitting of course). Seating is both booths and tables. The furniture, decor and ambiance is very pretty- carved dark rich woods. Although it is a busy place, you are not ignored here and every customer is just as important. Single bathrooms behind the beaded curtain might have you waiting in the hall but hopefully the wait is not too long.

The lunch special is a good size: tasty soup, a spring roll, a fried wonton with the dipping sauces, the entree (many choices- but my favorites were curry chicken, pad thai, & thai beef salad), and a bowl of white rice. And you could customize spiciness too- I like medium to spicy. I don't think I was ever disappointed here- never had an off meal. Two people could eat here for less than $20.00 including the tip- during the work week.  

I introduced my husband to this thai restaurant and he liked it a lot.

Their lunch specials were great, something everyone could enjoy and great prices. There were no pictures of the entrees so I was a little worried but when my food arrived it was lovely, delicious pad Thai awesomeness. Everyone at our table cleaned their plates (except for me because, you know, I'm a dainty flower and large portions for me means doggie bag left overs for the boyfriend.) Their Thai tea was perfect, it made me smile and I had to use some self control instead of just chugging the whole glass. The food was authentic and fresh and  delicious and their prices make it even better. Now I know where to go when my Thai food cravings hit again.

Food - 2.5/5 I was really excited to go to this spot. My original destination was a different spot near the strip, but with my Uber driver's strong recommendation my friend and I decided to try out. Portion was very small, especially Thai food being one of my favorite types of food. I've been to many different Thai places. We ordered many plates between two of us. Before we saw the portion, we were 100% sure that we'd have many Togo boxes coming back to the hotel with us. But, we finished most of the food. You'd think that because the food was tasty.. NO. NO. If we weren't hungry enough, we wouldn't have even eaten the food. They were mostly very salty. Besides food being salty and a small portion, it seemed like they were using a pretty good quality of seafood and others. We had ordered, gulf of Thai, fried cream cheese, papaya salad, chicken satay, and shrimp pad see weu.

Service - 4/5 Staff here were very friendly but a bit slow on refills on drinks. 

Overall, I'm sad to say my 20min drive from my hotel was just a waste of time. I'm being pretty generous on my overall 3 stars.",esD3YU8xIT5KtKRDs0iXjw,0,0,3,cV5WHKyQsaHIa92k9XsfeA

great items to try:

cream cheese shrimp tempura (only at the south rainbow location)

panang curry (with chicken!) i love the string beans that come with it. careful guys.. they like to make it really spicy so dont go above a 4 (scale of 1-10) if you really cant eat spicy...

pad thai. everyones favorite. i like it with beef

they have a dinner special for 2. its about $20 per person and you get house wine or champagne. 2 salads. 2 entrees and rice. i chose pad thai and chicken panang and it was more than enough for the 2 of us. the salad had a yummy carrot ginger dressing. and i'm not a fan of wine or champagne but i had the white zin and it was delish.",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,1,0,5,5F890l-vQ8-o4lpDKPiOXQ

Other Thai restaurants charge at least $11-$12 for the same thing, but without all the extras.  This place is far superior to any other Thai restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley.

As for service, it was excellent.  Our waters didn't get close to half empty before being refilled.  Also the attention to detail on our orders was second to none.

However, I've been meaning to come and seized the opportunity when it was my choice of food for family dinner. 

While it is in a typical shopping center, the inside is much nicer than any other Thai places around with it's wood carved panel decor. It's the type of Thai place you could take a casual date. This time I picked up my order to-go, but I will definitely sit in next time. 

We had - 

Massuman curry with tofu - this to me reminded me for of a panang, but still very good. Actually grandma really, really liked this one and asked to order it in the future. 

Mongolian beef - It was decent, just not my style of mongolian beef. This is that Thai Chinese style brown sauce kind that I'm eh about, but it was properly cooked and seasoned. 

Chili Mint Noodles - These are wide noodles in a soy, chili flavoring with basil leaves. I rather liked this, real flavorful and spicy. If you like wide noodles and something like pad se ew but dont feel like sweet, then go with these.

Mango sticky rice - their version I had at another location and quite like it. Also the portion is generous with two squares of rice when most places give you one. The rice was cooked right, the coconut cream was seasoned, half mango was ripe.

I can't comment really on service since my first experience was to-go, but the people were always polite and courteous on the phone and in person. Better than average ordeal of getting stuff ordered right.

I'll start with the food, cause that's the most important part.
I got the red curry, with tofu. Super bland, no spice to it, even when I asked for their highest level of spicy.(they rate form 1-5) I don't know why they feel the need to ""American""-ize it and make it gross. People go to Thai places for Thai food. If I wanted bland ass American food I'd go somewhere else. I even added in chilli (which took forever to request and get) and it didn't help.
A friend I was with got the Pad Thai, which was just as horrible. It was way too sour and also lacked any spice. 
the service was slow and rude, and in an almost completely empty restaurant, they felt the need to sit a family with three infant and toddler children next to us. How. Pleasant.

I went with my husband on a Sunday afternoon, and I won't lie I was pretty taken back when I walked inside (in a good way).  The outside is your basic strip mall, but once you walk inside the decor makes you feel like you were transported out of Las Vegas and into Thailand (or at least what it might look like in my head since I have never been there).  The place had a good sized crowd, but there were still a few tables left.  

Unfortunately, both my husband and I had a lot of work to do so we decided to order to go and did not get the full dining experience.  Despite not eating there, I was still impressed by their service.  The lady who took our order was very nice and we received our food very quickly.  After placing our order I think we were out the door in about 10 minutes.  When we go home and started to dig in we found out taste buds fully satisfied and stomach approved of the great portion sizes.  

We ordered two basics, Chicken Pad Thai (9.95) and Beef Pad See Ew (9.95).  I know we weren't too adventurous, but I had to make sure they did the basics right.  Yay for Pin Kaow, both executed wonderfully and I recommend both dishes to anything thinking of trying this place.

They have lunch specials ($8) which come with soup, egg roll and fried wonton. The beef chow mein was alright - nothing to rave about. My friends ordered the chicken pad thai and a glass noodle dish + rice. The servings were pretty decently sized.

Floor to ceiling wood paneling, Thai pop and servers outfitted in traditional attire, transported me to a magical, happy place. I love it when an unassuming strip mall spot knocks me off my design feet. For this reason alone, put this spot on your short list for dates and other occasions that require impressing. It is the perfect combination of adventurous eats with charming surroundings.

The service was friendly, but they failed to inform us that brown rice is an additional $3/person! Mouth dropping upcharge. When our bill arrived, we informed them of our concern, and they kindly only charged us for one brown rice. Sadly, having to pay $6 for both me and my husband to enjoy brown rice will probably prevent us from returning. I know it seems like a small thing, but that is practically the price of an entire entree during lunch specials, which they do offer with soup, eggroll and fried wonton.

Even so, I can say that the red curry is a fine specimen of curry. The server recommended the massaman, but it is not available as a lunch special. The chicken and rice soup was a bit salty; the egg roll was simply ok, and the fried wonton is just an odd item to me without at least some variety of filling.

Overall, the food and environment are top notch, but I happen to be a brown rice stickler. It's just one of my things. Still, I love a place in Vegas that does the strip mall proud.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,11,4,BP130CGASpjj9Pp3mC7mYA

5400584,2013-10-17,1,elqbBhBfElMNSrjFqW3now,"I moved to Vegas about month ago this is the nearest Thai place close to my apartment.
And this is my experienced
First time
That was when I was on vacation visit Las Vegas.
-Decoration inside restaurant make me happy and feel good 50% already before order the food. It located in the mall and look so simple like normal Asian places and I thought it will be simple chairs and tables and could be not that clean inside,but when I get in all Thai decoration everything so clean and nice.
Me and my boyfriend we were ordered 
ChickenTom kha soup spicy level 7 ( too creamy and less spicy then we expected by the way I'm Thai originally from Thailand my spicy level is real Thai my boyfriend he's American and he likes spicy same level as mine )
Crying tiger the meat was ok nothing special the sauce it's ok it's nothing bad but nothing special either
Pad Woonsen with chicken this dish same it was ok nothing special and maybe because week before we were in Thai town Los Angeles we liked food there more I feel more authentic and reasonable price my boyfriend also liked in Thai town more.

Second time 
I moved here already I was checking neighborhood this area and I was so craving for Thai food and I remember this place so I go there again for lunch. 
-I ordered Mongolian beef I didn't order lunch special or anything like that if they have but portion come out so small I thought maybe I'm too hungry or something anyway I'm pretty sure my first visit food portion was bigger overall food was ok not bad. 


Third time 
-This is first time I come here for dinner first was late lunch on vacation with my boyfriend second was by myself on lunch time and yes decoration there make me happy to sit and have a nice dinner with my boyfriend 
And this what we ordered. 
-Chicken Tom kha soup this time we ordered a bowl instead of hot pot big one like first time we ordered spicy level 10 I ordered speak Thai tell them make it spicy as much as possible like Thai people eat soup come out in good size bowl you can share 2 people we order lot of other food so we decided order a bowl hot pot it's not too big tho if you are a big fan of soup this time soup was so good spicy was perfect for us 
Chicken wing appetizer my boyfriend big fan of chicken wings I'm not that excited when it comes to Thai chicken wings I'm more like chicken wings American style chicken wings was not too bad my favorite part is they have lemongrass and some Thai ingredients deep fried on top on chicken wings make aromatic special scent for Thai food and feel like home :)
Entrees we had Chu Chee Salmon and Hell curry we ordered spicy same level like soup food came out look nice by the way this is first time I see they called hell curry most Thai restaurant called jungle curry if you are curious it's a curry without coconut milk so coconut milk makes curry creamier sweetener but this curry strong taste of chilly curry was very strong spicy we ordered with beef I would say it was very good for jungle curry compared to anywhere I had before in US but not as good as Thailand back home Chuchee Salmon was creamy and good spicy. 
Desserts we had sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream this was highlight of the night so good we actually come back again to order only this for to go. 

So I give 4 stars cause I like decoration of restaurant look so clean inside food total it was ok some dishes it was good but you have to make sure with server what you like like last time that I ordered very spicy Thai style I even speak Thai they gave me fish sauce with chilies ( it's common thing for Thai people to add salty and spicy yum!) and food come out like I want I will go back for sure :)",LOHKFVcuMLCu90vH4d143w,1,0,4,REncMtsb_uNmZXYO-6LdAQ

The flavor is what we are used to and we usually get the same entrees which include. Tom Yum soup with shrimp, Pad woo sen,  Beef basil, Pork Larb, Thai beef salad, and spring rolls. We've ordered other entrees, but these are the ones that we usually include in our order. We get it at spicy level 7, sometimes a 5 for my daughter. The spice level is usually what we can count on to be pretty consistent. Since my husband has been to Thailand a few times, he knows what Thai hot is, and most restaurants don't usually serve it that way for us Americans. I am sure a level 7 would be much hotter in Thailand. But we rather enjoy the food than be sweating it out and having a runny nose from the heat! Plus our insides would thank us!

This past visit though, the spice levels got mixed up somehow. The Tom Yum soup was not spicy at all. Hubby had to add more of the base that we keep in the fridge at home for when he makes his own. And the rest of the entrees seemed to be at a level 5, except for the larb which my daughter eats, seemed to be spicier. Not sure if they have a new cook, but its been months since we've been able to order from here. The flavors are still there, just the spice level was off.

The decor was pleasant- wood everywhere, not overly crowded with tables. The floor didn't look as if it had been swept for a couple of days, though (sorry, Pin Kaow- that evening sun shows everything on a smooth shiny surface!)

It may not look like much on the outside since the restaurant is in a non-descript shopping plaza on the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow.  Once you enter, though, you will find yourselves in an inviting atmosphere with wooden walls and accents throughout, as well as Thai décor.  It does get busy at night, but I've been lucky enough to not have had to wait for a table yet, usually arriving around 6:00pm.  
My favorites are their Mango Salad with fried tofu, cilantro, cashews, red onions, and Thai lime sauce.  This is a refreshing dish that helps you cool off in the summer time.  I also like their Pad Thai as well as their Satay, either the beef or the chicken.  Service is attentive and the food is always satisfying.

The interior of the restaurant is nicer than most other strip mall Thai places I have been to and it was fairly busy when I was there midday.
