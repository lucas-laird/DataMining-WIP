The pasta is always al dente! Plus, they pour wine generously by the glass.

501651,2007-05-28,0,9apCvu75wELDFia_usTjlg,"The Suncoast's Oyster Bar serves pre-shucked oysters. (They remove the blue plastic bands around each one before serving them on the half shell.)  I had two dozen oysters and was satisfied with the price I paid.  For $14.99 per dozen, I didn't expect greatness, and I got exactly what I expected.  They oysters were large and plump, but had none of the liquor (probably due to them being pre-shucked).  They don't have different kinds of oysters, like I would expect an oyster bar would.  I guess this is a good place to go if you are craving oysters and want a place that's quick and cheap.  It's fun to watch most of the dishes being prepared right in front of you.  The bouillabaisse could have had a stronger flavor, but it's tasty nonetheless.  If you go to Senor Miguel's next door, you can order from the Oyster Bar menu, too.",E7sk9jsImePqLT4roNgotg,4,0,2,6wCztzLY82Yk30kVM0CvtA

I originally went a month ago and wasn't going to do a review, but ended up going to the buffet and the cafe since then and they are all horrible. I had the surf and turf and it was the worst ever. My friend had the seafood gumbo and it didn't even look good. The steak was seasoned bad and the shrimp had a funny taste to it. The gumbo looked nothing like I have ever seen before or even tasted. One good thing I can say is the server was very polite.",5R7fwSOQ4E3-eqp7NOAPkA,0,0,1,oMCjF3ZUtLpQETUYlQt8ZA

1906011,2011-05-28,0,9apCvu75wELDFia_usTjlg,"Questions

Is bread best when it has the fragrance of yeast rather than cardboard?  Is New England clam chowder supposed to be cream-colored rather than gray?  Are sushi rolls supposed to taste more like fish than cucumber? Is sushi rice supposed to be flavored with rice wine vinegar? Is  eel best when it tastes like eel rather than candy?  Is tuna supposed to be free of sinew threads that feel like thin dental floss?

If your answer to any of the above is yes, then go somewhere else.  Grocery store deli sushi and canned chowder are better.  Seriously.  

....and while I'm at it... What is it about Las Vegas bakers and bread?  When you get bread here your response is usually ""Oh, it has that on it."" or ""It has this on it"", or ""I don't know what that is.""  I got a suggestion: Buy  Walmart frozen east rolls.  Follow the directions, and your patrons will roll their eyes so only the whites show and bury their faces in the bread basket.  Taste is better than how clever you are.",d63eAOSBa3E5uNYYzD8yzg,0,0,1,VmLjG0v3bnPYp0KqTWuwNw

Just want to add that the clam chowder seriously tasted like it was canned. 

I ordered a sampler, mostly everything was deep fried i would expect a place like an oyster bar to find ways to enhance the flavors of seafood not just batter and fry the suckers. Surprisingly the rice was good.

Sashimi/Oysters: Everything was really fresh. Oysters are the only things I refuse to eat, but everyone in my family loved them! 

Rolls: Solid and tasty! 

Entrees: The pan roast and gumbo was great! Both were greatly seasoned and the seafood was still fresh and tasty! The linguine, however, definitely needed more work and seasoning. 

Service: It was SO SLOW. I understand because there was only one server, but it took quite a while to order and receive our food.",JteQGisqOf_pklq7GA0Rww,1,0,4,rtbpWNJRc2i1thn5r0gGKQ

I've been here multiple times with my husband and each time has been crappy. The only positive thing I can say is the crab and corn chowder when it's available which is hardly ever is the most decent thing on the menu. Oysters are dry like they are old & they have no flavor. Barely any cocktail sauce is given and you get one wedge of lemon which is all dried up. The sushi doesn't seem fresh even though he's making it in front of you, it doesn't taste very good. The bread is always hard and you have to ask to get it. Once  we went and one of the cooks looked upset when we ask for more oysters as if we were bothering him. Please keep in mind we were the only two people sitting at the bar at the time. I think I'm pretty much done with this place! So many better places in the city. Suncoast your food and beverage department need to get it together and make massive changes to the oyster bar.",Pc0hcHhkY-O7xBlI2BdQVQ,0,0,1,R4Le1ivc1_Ta09ItEqrepg
2604399,2012-06-03,1,9apCvu75wELDFia_usTjlg,"This is my folks' Tuesday night dinner spot with their best friends. So much so, that when I was on a date here ordering from Than (usually Glenn is sushi chef but he was off) he knew what table they sit in AND what all 4 ordered just by a description! The staff is very welcoming and kind to regulars (always ask for my folks or vice versa) Glen even knows what I like enough to make to go sashimi on the fly for me if my folks (who don't speak sushi) can bring me a treat. 

Used to always get half dozen clams on the half shell & the clams in vermouth appetizer. Usually now, I go with sashimi. Glen will even ask if I'm still training, remember not to bring me bread & make sure I have low sodium soy sauce. Than was nice enough to bring my date & I some hamachi belly left from another order he was making. It was my date's first sashimi experience and he made it a great one. It is not a full sushi bar by any means, but the chefs are great and will even tell me which fish to go with that day, etc. 

My folks and friends all enjoy the bread, pan roast, linguine with clams and crab cakes. Mom always gets shrimp scampi. I really enjoy how friendly and attentive everyone is. Even fellow diners: once I was chatting up a couple next to me from Mililani Town, HI where my best friend lives. Talk about Aloha spirit: as they were leaving, they asked if I had plans Sat night & handed me 2 tickets to Clint Holmes at the Suncoast Showroom! We were seated right next to his wife and Mom & had a blast. 

I've seen people take digs at chowder, being an East Coast girl who summered on Martha's Vineyard most of my life, I can tell you the chowda is good, though I haven't had it in a while. 

In all, this is a great place to come and dine in a relaxed setting on some great seafood served by folks who really care about their customers. The only minus for me is it is open to the very smoky casino.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,3,3,4,4IGESSmt-R7Oy6Zfa2GEYw

4175493,2014-12-07,0,9apCvu75wELDFia_usTjlg,I ate here tonight hoping it was similar to the oyster bar in Palace Station.  A stranger my boyfriend and I spoke to at the Palace Station oyster bar insisted to us it was the same but without the line.  Wow he was so wrong.  Who listens to strangers anyways?  That's what I get!  The cool thing is though that they have a sushi bar and some other seafood items like calamari and crabcakes.  I had the shrimp tempura special which was pretty good.  I also tried a shrimp appetizer that was wrapped in won ton and fried.  My boyfriend ordered the pan roast special.  It was okay but I was so disappointed after having tried the pan roast at Palace Station.  Now I know better and hopefully you do too!

I am a seafood lover, and this place is close to home. 
I tend to try to right my reviews based on some of the best things places have to offer. People will go and try out certain things that aren't as good, so they base it off of that. 

The best things I've had here: 

Blackened Shrimp Caeser Salad. 
Clam Chowder
Crab Cakes

I haven't had the Oysters here, but they reviews for it aren't amazing. But I'm not one to go anywhere and that be the first thing I order.
