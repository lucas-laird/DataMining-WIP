I had the holy guacamole, a special of the day which wasn't on the menu. It came highly recommended and boy was it worth it!! The portions were generous and the presentation was amazing. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. You must stop in for lunch if you're in the Las Vegas area!!",JQVFWoJBuZLkM7NgA4QB7g,0,1,5,SFKeduwLmT_xfbMhbQbM9w

Looking forward to my next visit.",hMheTqz8gXt3fBAaM4SviQ,0,1,5,UtLUE00nIXkKj1I-M7Bxxg

I'm really indecisive as to which sandwich to get so I'm always asking the girls questions about the sandwiches and they're really nice about it. Besides this, the sandwiches I've ordered are really good and reasonably priced. I got a flyer yesterday and next month sandwiches are 20% off. Will def be coming back!",0Zaqfvewn3NavnLQr8NfRg,0,1,5,Ic3A1L6PXkS1Vdt_ll0hJA

1976666,2017-05-28,14,dizXpumQ-R5Py87nNUFy8A,"There's a sandwich on the menu here called Netflix & Chill. If that doesn't pique your interest, allow me to expand: it's delicious, loaded up with London Broil, red wine shallots, bleu cheese crumbles, fried onion strings for crunch, and a creamy horseradish sauce! I want one now just thinking about it.

The sandwiches here are made with Boar's Head meats and cheeses, and they use interesting combinations and sauces (avocado mousse anyone?) for fresh, tasty options you can't find elsewhere. If you're into the classics (meatball, blt), they have those too, and you can also customize your order. They offer each sandwich as a wrap or salad. Menu items are about $10 and portions are large.

However, I'm not thrilled when I leave a new business I'm happy to patronize, only to see a $5 sandwiches sign by the street luring in new customers. In multiple visits, I've never once been informed what that $5 promotion is, nor has any discount been mentioned (another is posted on the wall). 

Most recently, I placed an Eat24 order and rolled up to a closed sign at 5PM. They had my order ready and said it was the last of the day, but if you can flip around an open/closed sign, you can correct your own posted hours (which stated 10AM-8PM). 

TIPS: The online menu only allows you to pick wrap, stack (sandwich), or pack (salad), but doesn't list their breads. Specify the french roll, it's fresh and thick enough to hold up to the end of your meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,16,3,vhGjV2fG12HMcQhTYaoYqQ

I ordered three different sandwiches for my family and all three were amazing! The bread was fresh and delicious and the ingredients were fresh and well prepared. Must try the Chicken Parm sandwich, though or anything with the crispy chicken on it! So good!",82ddG2Yl67zqeG9m6avTTQ,0,1,5,HhRXfozfUrkLbjpxeNL1LA
2433169,2017-03-20,1,dizXpumQ-R5Py87nNUFy8A,"This place will not stay in business very long if they cant get their stuff together.
Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm. Place was dead except a party of 3 the looking at the one menu they have on the wall.
I place my very simple order, a sandwich with meat and cheese only and a soda. My friend places their order. At the time we are ordering I though their was a guy making our sandwiches but I guess I was wrong because he quickly disappeared and never returned.
After about 10-15 minutes they bring out my friends sandwich. I ask about mine and was told it would be out in just a minute. Another 10 minutes go by and still no sandwich. The party of three ask for a refund since they also are still waiting. A couple who came in after all of us gets their order, I STILL do not have mine. Go to the counter to ask what was up and the poor girl has to come back and tell me that my order was lost. I finally get my sandwich after waiting for 20-25 minutes and I have to take it to go since I wasted all the time I had waiting. No offer of a discount or a free bag of chips for the inconvenience.
The prices are outrageous. the service was bad, the sandwich was nothing special. Don't see myself coming back unless it was just to get a soda, that was actually a very good fountain drink.",eWanvjvMjR-a92JVGAX0BQ,10,2,1,NsIjUm237aDea_Qz7NNYhQ

Offered my son options when they ran out of meatballs, and a free sandwich for next visit.

2598563,2017-04-05,0,dizXpumQ-R5Py87nNUFy8A,Well I was definitely not happy with the sandwich I received today. It was a burnt tiny piece of chicken with grilled onions and literally one slice of avocado. I even took a picture since I could not believe what I received....,WKPG2IvcLFB9SA7MERCzUQ,9,1,1,fBuv9oiKyzY7bGUvbJD5eg
2668322,2017-04-14,0,dizXpumQ-R5Py87nNUFy8A,"Pulled in because a sign saying $5 sandwiches. New restaurant in my neighborhood. Had the ""full house"",  thin crispy chicken cutlet w bacon, cheese & mixed salad greens on French bread. Pretty good sandwich but very dry. Seriously needed dressing or mayo. Only chips, no sides, even though they had sandwiches with cole slaw on them, it wasn't on the menu. Need to offer potato or macaroni salad & cole slaw. Maybe soup or small salads too.

Sandwich was 3 star, if you overlook the dryness. 

Service was super friendly & attentive, 4 stars. 

$5 sign out & $13 for sandwich, chips & small drink, 0 stars.",HpivLAodxcQlmncyc6swXg,5,0,2,BmXrolhhjhLzSEzZDBGGrw
3525401,2017-05-03,0,dizXpumQ-R5Py87nNUFy8A,"Stopped in last week on a weekday for lunch at 11:12 am. Ordered sandwich by register stood for 5 or 6 minutes and nobody took my money so I went and sat down thought maybe I pay when they hand me the sandwich, that's fine. At 11:29 after seeing several customers seeming concerned over speed or I should say lack of I went back to counter. Guy I have order to told the sandwich maker what my order was. I asked them if that was mine and if they hadn't started making it yet and they said they were doing it now. I explained to them thy could cancel my order as I have already been waiting over 15 minutes for the sandwich which they hadn't even started making. Never got to eat the food so couldn't tell you if it was good or bad. However the two guys working didn't have a clue on customer service or how to operate things. Waiting over 15 minutes for a sandwich when on a lunch break doesn't work for anyone. Turned out that day I didn't even get to eat lunch because they took way to long. If they don't get there speed down making a simple sandwich they are in big trouble. Don't think anyone is interested in waiting 15-20 minutes for a simple sandwich when most sit down restaurants don't even take that long.",vu4GtHTIKe7H7_fL2l7fuw,3,0,1,PHNi389dksVKnfgDlb8GbQ
