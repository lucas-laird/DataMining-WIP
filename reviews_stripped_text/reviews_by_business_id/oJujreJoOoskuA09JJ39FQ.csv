1105359,2015-06-21,1,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,"Was so pissed. When I got home I discovered that my large french fries  were only half full. I could have paid for a medium and got the same amount. 

The whole experience was bad. Long wait in the drive thru. They didn't even ask if I wanted  ketchup.  Tried to give me the wrong  drink. Then to discover  the French fries were half empty when I got home. The burgers were Luke warm.

Worst McDonald's ever! Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant  ever again.",OkIQIiZbSsFsUeakVoxJjA,1,1,1,Nn6OsNdr4X-YOclRMqWm2g

I told them last visit give me back my money i dont want the food forget it. If your so poor you cant give me my drink cup before i leave order counter you should close it down. Lame. The only place,in town that i know of that wont give you your drink before your food is ready. Cheap skates",SzpFv5GP5vzEOY2xYg1s2Q,1,1,1,ixeZeDjCE_o3oCFbSK2tVA
2870312,2017-06-11,1,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,"Negative review.   Rip off.   I ordered $30 worth of food.   Only 1 large fry - the box was less than half full and fries were old.   I kindly asked the mgr. to fill it to the correct amount.   She grabbed box from me, went to the fry bin put 2 more fries in and handed them back.  The manager ""Maria"" has a horrible attitude.",4VfasXmJ2EC1vm63xMNBKg,1,1,1,YPU9NI3j5PNFfzUPg1Nddg
2871914,2017-09-26,1,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,"This restaurant has the worst customer service. From the managers to the staff. I asked for the employees full name and noone knew the last name. None of the managers knew there own employees full name. That's Bad already!! It says alot about this McDonald's. Brittney was rude, condescending. My food sat for over 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging it. I will never return here. Brittney had a problem with my service dog, instead of asking if she was a service dog, she immediately said you need to pick up your dog, mind u my dog is tiny and weighs 10 pounds. Also wears a service dog collar. These employees need more training on customer service and how to approach customers.",Hu4jaEcx4wUjGoFx1F4BTw,1,1,1,lzclgT4IeqMfqpZjJNnJ1Q
3490010,2017-09-15,1,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,This McDonalds is the worst.  They ALWAYS get your order wrong.  The managers are all rude and you wait FOREVER to get anything.  No one in here cares.  Do yourself a favor and drive down the street and go to another one.,FpvF8TyasUnVFx0YSLo_5w,2,1,1,PVCZhtoaOgsNjdfAakGHuw

But today was just the last leg for me , I guess my order was too complicated no onion no pickle on a cheese burger w/ melted cheese ( because most times the cheese is not melted ) and my receipt had my order correct but my burger still came with onions and pickles . So I went inside and waited for a new one to be prepared . Only to watch the lady preparing my food give me sooo much attitude , and cover my burger in ketchup . 
I just left the burger there , customer service was piss poor today . And every other day . Everyone looked miserable .",h74Bt9X0eW_D1EQ70oQWqA,2,1,1,6D25L_9_Lpcu3DJfd1z3Yw
4632055,2017-04-12,0,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,Came about 12:45p during busy time with the kiddos and well yes it was packed. I ordered lunch and it was quick and easy. People started to leave at 1:15p though. The only downside of this McDonald's is the Play Place it is small and there isn't a big slide for the children to slide.,RiY3oarAMWmFFyziW4WwRA,0,0,3,nKhbGBSmHn6EoL6Uqjl9cw
5333203,2016-02-11,1,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,"Just went in to get fries and a drink. It was hot and I hadn't eaten all day. I was waiting on the bus that takes forever to come and decided to go in and grab some food. Was standing at the counter for what seemed like forever, no one was at the register. Too many customers not enough employees. I left and just ate at home.",j3-k0cY9lniKOrz6B7tc-w,1,1,2,vtqUkXaqpTihz2xMywUi2g
5425713,2018-01-06,0,oJujreJoOoskuA09JJ39FQ,"my daughter wanted cheeseburgers they NO longer have the 2 cheese burger meal on the menu. I also wanted french fries with NO SALT. He rang it up with No Salt. and when she handed me the bag I asked her with NO SALT, she said YES...SHE LIED. I got home it was salty. This is why they want 15 bucks hour to treat you like Crap. I""am so disgusted with them Iam going in the morning. because the girl on the phone all she would say is i'm sorry. sorry doesnt cut it. explain to me why you cant talk to the employees about this.and let them no while im on the phone why did they (she) give me the fries with SALT on them. Just a straight up answer. So sick of this!!! Done no more. I hope you keep losing business too.",anwmW5m3Q_ZvDK50-RMGbw,0,0,1,rD2sn5UhSttzM1x6REZp7g
