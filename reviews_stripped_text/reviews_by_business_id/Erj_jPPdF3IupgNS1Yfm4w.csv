I started sitting at the bar. Because I noticed they had a very attractive female bartender bartending. So I started going in there on my fridays. The first week I was there she didnt charge me that much. But I didnt have that much to drink. The second week I was there I drank a little more but I was playing. The next week I went in I didnt play at all. And I drank a little more. Well by the time I got ready to leave my bill was rediculus. At first I thought the bartender over charged me. I didnt want to pay the bill. But then she got upset and told me you ordered them your paying. I always pay. just didnt think it was right. So I went home and soberd up. And looked at my bill the next day. I decided after looking at it. It wasnt her fault. This place just really over charges for drinks. I will never drink there again.,JgA77DzRnhjncJvAijmAdw,0,0,1,2bVYBih-QOpF1T9YwstUjw

After putting in over $20 in a poker machine this a-hole asked me if I already closed out my tab out our table, which cost me over $40, in order to order another glass of Chardonnay which would cost you about $1.50.  When I questioned whether that would not matter since I was now playing a poker machine and entitled to free drinks, this moron asked if I was playing $20...  I have lived here for over 30 years.

Bentley's gets points there because it's not super smoky, they serve food, and it's never packed, so there's plenty of space for the kids to move around if they want.
It's a pretty good place to watch football because there are lots of tvs and you can get a speaker for your table if you ask.
Bonus for the patio outside, looking at Sunset Park.
However, they lose points several other places: the management (after 2-ish years) has yet to change the outside sign from Nikki Lee's to Bentley's. It's dark and dirty-feeling inside. 
Food is a little high priced.
They can't even bother to print out a nice-looking menu at FedEx and have it laminated. Instead they give you a photocopied version of the old one, stapled together (seriously).
So overall, Bentley's is kinda divey (which is not my scene), but due to it's family-ish atmosphere, we'll probably be back.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,2,3,7KpLlqNEi39nDkf0MKyNtg

The service is totally wack; like if you want food at the bar you MUST order from a server on the floor and if you want drinks on the floor, not food, it is practically impossible and they hate when you ask for either/or.
Two people working the bar where 100+ people are crowded around BECAUSE they 're-did' the open floor into a dance floor; which now means no more Flip-Cup or Beer Pong inside and it has been so darn cold outside so nothing going on out there of course. Obviously the whole vibe is off and we waited for 20+ mins to order drinks before finally deciding to just go to my own house where the drinks are wayyy cheaper, we can listen to WAY BETTER music (seriously playing YMCA on a computer and sitting on your phone?!- I hope you are not paying her much), play beer-pong, and not wait forever to get crappy service- truly the bartenders and servers seem so unhappy when it gets busy, like don't you want to make money? 
This is coming from a kick-baller who used to go after games with the teams and have a blast but things have changed at Bentley's and not for the better. If I were WAKA, I wouldn't be too happy since they advertise the crap out of Bentley's to everyone and I am sure WAKA's people bring in a ton of their weekly earnings; now it's not really fun any more. 
I am so confused about the dance floor, they put all this money into it but for what? Seems like people aren't really going to Bentley's anymore because of the changes. 
I guess I should give this place a chance on a weekend some time and see if people actually dance..doesn't make sense to me but whatevs.

Or if you want, you can buy from the merch table which has a wide selection of ""Las Vegas Nebraskan"" shirts and hats. There was cheering. There was yelling. There was chanting, singing...heck, there was even a cardboard Bo Pelini kitty! I'd estimate that there were between 200-300 Husker fans here.

I came in looking for football, and that's what I got. They have 5 or 6 very large screens over the bar so you can watch multiple games. The gaming bar occupies basically a corner of the space, with tables and booths, and also a larger area set up for banquets. 

The food is typical bar foods, with an Italian theme. I ordered the ""Mama's Lasagna"" and it was pretty good, served with numerous garlic knots. You can get wings, pizza, and more.
