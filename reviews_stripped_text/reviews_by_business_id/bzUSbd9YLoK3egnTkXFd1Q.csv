I ordered the beef kabob on the recommendation of Phil, the owner, and I was not disappointed at all.  The halal meat was moist and spiced just right... absolutely delicious!  The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat.  He brought me a sample of the rice pudding, and it was very good, along with the mango yogurt smoothie, which would be a refreshing drink come the hot days of summer.  I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other items that other Yelpers have raved about!",kmC8nIGdQeLUOBCgRDzS8g,2,0,5,e3IeKncWZa55LPadXaFyUw
1569523,2014-05-06,0,bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q,"So here's the thing. This isn't an Indian restaurant. No matter how you spin it. 

The ""naan"" is actually pita. The kind you buy in stores. There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. 
We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. 

Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. 

The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. 

The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. 

The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. 

Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. 

This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either. 

Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food. But it is a decent place to go for a burger or the pizza.",CS4c5WBPG14mHUx2qPJdMw,1,0,3,iafwT1fvb5QQ-fqz7y7bQg

I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.

Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.

Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,1,2,2ri42IvMGvPDKZCVBhJmCQ

My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten.  The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!!  The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order.   I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers...  Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm!

I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go.  The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun.  I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future.  I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,0,0,4,k0pUou-q-TFAV0oIvT_oPg

Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect. 

The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :) 

Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge. 

You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food. The ""white dude"" who is their head chef, couldn't be more ""desi"" when it comes to spices and food. 

Loved the chicken wings and chicken kabob here. 

Only con: they are only open till 7pm.",00Z-tCcJVe9LVP3GakkqDQ,0,0,5,rP1fOEMJZTUgJ5V8vAvTYA

I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. 

We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. 

Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. 

The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. 

The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. 

I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! 

Overall, this isn't entirely ""Sholay"". If you are looking for Indian (as in""desi khana"") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place.",n9zwrWp8EeB9ODTitKZYsw,2,0,3,VAuszSrcSOnnTz16-9Jadg
5718699,2014-05-11,0,bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q,"The friendliest worker ever works here. I think he is the owner, or just a very friendly man. Every time my boyfriend and I come here we get free stuff. Last time it was dessert, the other time it was mango lassi. The food is good and decent pricing. Sure, it's not the most glamorous presentations, but it is good for someone who is very hungry.

This place just opened up like a 3 months ago, so they are pretty eager to get customers in.",TyepNPbEnMCy1_IhsT0YAg,0,0,4,Q0Ngh3nFEiBnX4kng09ElQ
