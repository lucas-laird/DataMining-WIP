It is beautiful and very clean inside.  Staff was very nice and attended to us quickly. The food was delicious and authentic. We are going to be regulars here. I'm really glad we gave it a chance",gROEMZAXYqyX0rvpLZgK8Q,2,1,4,k3EsTm9Lq2ORdbW0cZ62vA

The price is fair. We had a good time and will be coming back soon.,CjPvz4S8gTTwq5Hfis8AZQ,0,0,5,Hdj6Za25SZgUGtKXaZ0DyQ

Spooned on some of their salsa and it really helped the ceviche.  Maybe their cocktail version is better.  I got a enchilada and chile rellano combo and was really surprised.  They have a great red enchilada sauce.  It is flavorful, thick, and really goes well with the rellano.  Can't give this place give stars because of the tostadas but I will be back want to try some of their other seafood dishes, and more of their food in general.  Service was great also.",54zqyneshZvyWymZLE6mJw,1,1,4,STPAH-TOZij5R2-WCtOCJA

We had a party of six and our server and sam helped us with any questions we had. My boyfriend is a picky eater so he just got good ol' chicken enchiladas while the rest of is did a family style sharing which consisted of ceviche ( best in town ) Molcajete mariscos which was an amazing hot lava bowl of seafood and potatoes. The other two dishes that were ordered were Birria de chivo And carne en s√≠ jugo. Delish! Everything tasted homemade and real. The chef also greeted our table.  We ended the night with some bomb fried ice cream as well.  We will definitely be returning!,lT5z4hKmg0WWfrtT7dN1Yg,2,2,5,C791mz-v1-CLDZUu310Kdg

Restaurant is family owned and operated and the staff couldn't be more welcoming. Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,0,2,5,owbTCbu0Et0OfBs3ttShxQ
