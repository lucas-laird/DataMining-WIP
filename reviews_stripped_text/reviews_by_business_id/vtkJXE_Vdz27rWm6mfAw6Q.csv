we get there around 9, not very packed, i felt like i was back in china. the decor, environment, even the waiters had a china feel to it. the lady that was part of our group who was ordering, she asked what don't we eat. not to be rude, i responded with ""i eat everything"" i will soon regret those 3 little words.

one after another, intestines, stomach, liver, not even sure whats being displayed to me. what happen to the chow fun or sweet or spicy pork.  i tasted everything and hoped it didnt come out the same way in it came in.  we did enjoy a nice bottle of opus one with our meal.

Once I was seated a waiter came and immediately asked if I wanted tea or anything to drink. I ordered tea and a coke. Now, I eyed the chopsticks and looked around at all the Asian customers using them like experts. Then a lady came with a little cart loaded with Dim Sum.

I love Chinese food. Have since I was a little kid and I am very partial to the Shrimp dishes. So, I asked if she had shrimp and was provided two plates. A Shrimp ball and Shrimp Dumplings. I took the noodle thingy. Yummm! It was great. 

I ended up grabbing some shrimp wontons and I ordered the Honey Walnut Prawns. The Wonton was very good. The Prawns came with a bowl of rice and between that and the other stuff I had I had a pretty good meal. Alright so I tried the chopsticks and after a few seconds swiftly asked for a fork.

All in all I liked Cathay House. The food is very good though I thought it was a bit expensive. My bill came to about $28 for just me.  I am a stickler that waiters keep my soda full.

Going during the weekday during lunch can be hectic or not, luckily our group of 4 was seated fairly quickly for a busy lunch hour. Of course just picking items off carts and watching as the ladies play bumper carts trying to pawn off their dishes. I have to say that I did enjoy these eats but I think I still prefer Changs. Their service was a little slow. We waited at least 5 mins for drinks before we flagged down a waiter to order something to quench our thirst since we were already chowing down. Also we had to ask for a few items to be warmed up because they were quite cold. Nobody likes cold shrimp balls, do they? I'm sure the waitress wasn't thrilled with our request as she left her cart behind a patron's seat

They ordered a few things:
Duck- from what I saw, it was less fatty than other Chinese restaurants we've gone to and were very meaty. Taste wise, my bf said it ""tasted like duck from any other Chinese restaurant."" 
Oyster hot pot- probably one of my faves here. The oysters were big and juicy and had lots of great flavors.
Beef w/scallions- He said it was ""ok"" but no one hardly touched it. 
Shrimp and eggs w/green onions- good stuff, loaded with shrimp.
Salt and pepper crab- I don't normally like crab but this was pretty ok.
Fried fish- had no clue what kind of fish this was but it was good. I guess you get this free if your bill is over 100.

Cathay House has excellent dim sum and one of their best plates is the sliced barbeque pork that is so tender and tasty, it is worth ordering extra to bring home.

They are very attentive and while my husband and I like to load up our plates so we can have the workers take away the ""evidence"" of so many plates that we ordered, we can't hide the bill when it comes or the amount of food we order to bring home so we can eat it again the following day.  

Their eggrolls are filled with shrimp.  Excellent noodle dishes and pork cilantro dumplings are yummy.  Everything is good and just writing this review, I am ready to return yet again.

1. For dinner, I was there with my boyfriend for the first time and we were sat with an American Chinese menu. For those of you that don't now its the menu with egg rolls, won ton soup and pork fried rice on it.

As we put in our order and was waiting with duck sauce and chips in front of us, I see dishes like hot pot, jellyfish and congee coming out to other tables. I guess as a precursor to this story I should tell you I am Asian and my boyfriend is Caucasian. The congee and hot pot dishes were being served to Asian only tables. I motioned over to the waiter and asked him why I didn't see those dishes on the menu I looked through earlier.  He explained ""oh we only give those menus to Chinese people"" and then looked at my boyfriend basically saying ""since you brought in a white boy, you don't get the real deal menu."" I thought this was rude since just because he's white doesn't mean he wouldn't appreciate the more exotic dishes.  Rude. The meal was not memorable so I will not waste your time on the details. 

2. I went there for dim sum to stray from my usual spot (Orchid Gardens) to expand my dim sum horizons in Vegas. This place was just okay. Not sure who wrote their navigation map for the food carts but only some came by my table.  Not a huge selection either. They had the usual dim sum staples so nothing special to tout.

The dim sum has no flavor at all, and if they don't sell the dim sum they go back to the bar where the microwave is and heat it up. they deserve a two star at least, because the waiters and bus boy actually give a better service than the dim sum ladies. They are vey attentive with changing the plates, refilling the hot water in the tea. Off the dim sum, we tried their beef chow fun. There was little flavor, but just something that we could not pinpoint.. I am very picky into how food tastes and i wasn't get anything from cathay house.

They are very slow. Only 2 carts running with barely any dim sum. I've never been to a dim sum restaurant where I have to wait 10 minutes for a cart to come by my table. The restaurant isn't even big! 

The restaurant is smart though. They are doing a promotion where it's half off all the dim sum dishes. Hmmm I wonder why?? Because this restaurant is awful. They do this to lure people in and show that there are actually a lot of people.

The ambience is like any other Chinese restaurants, table placements can be too close depends on where you sit, but it's generally clean.  The service has been decent to average.

Dim sum in the morning is ok, not good, but still not bad overall compared to Chinatown.  I would rate it somewhere in the middle.  Dinner is the best part of this place, they have a great selection of live seafood and often time there are special deals going for live seafood.  I especially like their fresh live shrimps and lobsters.

Now I don't know who all the titles of the staff, so I'll just refer to them as waiters and busers. I think we had 2 servers and 2-3 busers throughout the course of our meal.
2-3 because I think I saw two busers that looks identical, and I'm not being racist because I'm Chinese myself, so I'll just count them both as one person.


We first get there and put in our order. I didn't keep track of time, but probably after 20-30 minutes we get our appetizer, still no soup though and that's supposed to come first.  Buser #1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away. About 10-20 minutes later the other dishes started coming. The worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak. The thing about this dish is when it comes to your table, the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray. In our case, it came out at room temperature (meat and metal pan), so as you can expect, absolutely no sizzle.

Sometime throughout the meal, we asked Buser #1 if we're supposed to get soup. He responds by saying don't ask him, ask the waiter. So we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says he'll get us soup. About 10 minutes later, we still haven't received the soup so we don't really bother anymore. The waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet, which we said not yet, and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls. He immediately gets someone (again) to bring out soup. This time, Buser #2, puts the bowl of soup down, not sure where his mind is at, but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup, my mom suffering the most splash damage. He says sorry once, but for an incident like that, I think you should be more apologetic.

After a few more dishes arrive, we ask for rice, which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a Chinese restaurant.

Finally when we're done eating, we ask Buser #1 for some to-go boxes. He goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says ""Ask someone else to do it"". WTF kind of attitude is that?

In the end, they had the audacity to charge us 18% gratuity on a party of 4 with dreadful service.

I've been eating at Cathay house since I was a kid and I gotta say a lot has changed throughout the years. First big change was the shift of employees over to Chang's many years ago and now the big change in customer service. Back then, the food was so-so and the service even more ""meh."" Now, I'd have to say that Cathay House has the best dim sum in town! Food was not served cold and the same cart would come around my table at LEAST 3 times. The dim sum wasn't gross and greasy either, which is a big plus. All in all, the quality of food has improved a good amount.

However, what compels me to write this review is the major improvement in customer service. I came with a large party during lunch hours. It took a little long for us to get a table since we came during the peak hour. I noticed the back room was open and not all the tables were full, so I asked the hostess if we could just be seated there. THIS CLEVER WOMAN replies ""I'm sorry, we only have two waiters working that room together and I don't want you to have bad service."" It was such a perfect answer I couldn't argue back. After my dining experience, I was glad we waited the extra 5 minutes for a table to clear just so we would truly have customer satisfaction.

As of right now, Cathay House is my favorite dim sum place in town, mostly because of a recent bad experience at Chang's. However, PLEASE avoid Orchid Garden for dim sum. I noticed they have 3.5 stars right now on yelp, but please if you care about the people you are dining with, you should not support their business!

Gripes
- They sat us in what i call the 'shit hole' section of the restaurant where small families, less then a few people and generally those who don't look like they're gonna spend a lot of money go to minimize chances of customers wasting their time and maximize profit. Guess where the white people sat
- same cart, different pusher to give the illusion they were well stocked
- you could taste how much effort they put into their food. i've had chicken mcnuggets that have had more effort put into them
-oh look another cart that means they got more selection..DAMN IT those two just traded...DAMN YOU!!!!!

If you feel like eating what chinese people make to sell to foreigners by all means go here and order an Egg Foo Young and General Tso's Chicken and taste that authentic chinese goodness",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,0,1,hGOOKF3pyqVLRUqcM8JEWw

We ordered steamed pork buns, chicken feet, shui mui, Crispy pork, walnut shrimp, Hong Kong style chow mein, and salt and pepper shrimp. 

Everything was good but just salty and I bet plenty of MSG. Well I mean what do you expect from a late night Chinese food place like this.

Cathay House has pretty good hours for those looking to eat a late dinner. They're open up to 5am (almost 24 hours- they open at 10am and close at 5am.)

I came here for a late dinner and there were several folks who were also late night dining. This place seems to be known for their dim sum and at night time, they do offer some of their dim sum. We got a couple orders of their pork and shrimp siu mai. Aside from this, we ordered the wonton soup, pork chops, tofu with veggies and the chicken fried rice.

The wonton soup was a nice starter. It had tasty broth and soft dumplings filled with pork. Next up for us was the pork and shrimp siu mai. It's no wonder their dim sum here is popular, because the pork and shrimp siu mai was delcious!  Our main courses of pork chops and tofu with veggies did not disappoint either. The pork chops were nice and crispy. They were also pretty lean. The tofu with veggies had a good mixture of greens and slices of tofu. All the dishes went well with the chicken fried rice. Portion wise was decent though the pork chop seemed fewer than what I've seen before. The rice was plentiful but not too much chicken. It was decent though and there was food for to-go!

We arrived at about 3:45pm on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty, except for another table of 3 sitting by us. The server promptly rolled out a steaming cart and we began ordering. There were a few other items that we wanted to order that weren't in the cart, but we were able to easily and quickly place a special order for them. Unfortunately one item came out cold, (radish cake) - I didn't mind flagging her down to ask her if she can warm it up for us, but it is kind of a turn off that it came to us cold.

My favorites:
- Sui Mai was fluffy, tender, moist and very flavorful. Super addicting. 
- BBQ steamed buns (white bao) - lots of bbq pork filling and the white bao buns were soft and fluffy.
- BBQ pork buns (glossy buns) - The filling was very minimal, but it tasted great. Also, the buns were soft and sweet. 
- Fried shrimp balls served with 
sweet mayo came out hot and crispy. They weren't the best, but I still enjoyed them. 
- Chicken feet had good flavor and they were meaty. 

These were edible but not my favorite: 
- Har gow - the clear wrapper was too thick and chewy. The shrimp filling flavor was alright, but it's not my favorite version of har gow. 
- Rice noodles with shrimp - these were dried out and overcooked.
- Radish cake - came out cold, mushy, and oily. Not served with crispy edges like I'm used to.

Upon approaching the entrance I noticed how empty the parking lot was.  As I got to the door I noticed  a small sign from the Nevada Health District stating Chang's had been closed down due to health violations :(.  With my heart set on Dim Sum I took a friend recommendation of Cathay House.

Cathay House was busy, but managed to seat my party quickly.  The atmosphere was reminiscent of Ping Pang (minus slot machine noise).  The tea brought to the table wasn't to my liking.  The carts came buzzing by and we quickly grabbed:

Ha Gau (Shrimp Dumplings)
Crab Claws
Fried Shrimp Ball
Fried whole Shrimp
Baked Pork over Peanuts

I have to say that everything was good; highlights being the Crab Claws and Fried shrimp.  The Fried shrimp were almost twice as big as Ping Pang and the Crab Claws were bursting with flavor.

Salt and pepper shrimp, Combination fried rice, String beans w/chicken; ask for everything spicy, and if you are getting drinks for the bar, make sure you ask with no ice and get the ice on the side ;-) I know why I'm telling you and you have to trust me on this one.",Vc-w8-7QIrrN07oveskT3g,0,0,5,u-6LfJuESxGH55atug659A

I have been coming to Cathay House for many years now and the taste of their food has not changed. Even some of the waiting staff is still waiting tables. That means that they have a good business going on not only with food, but for their employees as well. This fact gives me piece of mind that my dining experience will be swell.

We decided to go to the one on Spring Mountain, NOT the Cathay House located inside PALMS casino. Reason being, the Spring Mtn. location is the ORIGINAL dim sum and first EVER dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas. This place is known for their serving of delectable dim sum dishes in CARTS, rather than ordering off a menu.

We ordered a variety of the standard dishes: chicken feet (my fav), hokkao(shrimp balls), fried crab claws, beef tribe, pork and shrimp shumai, ground shrimp stuffed peppers, mini pork ribs in black bean sauce, deep fried ground shrimp balls on a sugar cane stick, AND finally beef chow fun(another fav). We devoured everything with an exception of ONE small to-go box. The waiting staff seemed rather shocked to see that we were able to finish everything, because we ordered TWO, yes TWO of everything!!! Lol!

ALL in ALL, this is my favorite dim sum restaurant in Vegas.

IN FAVOR OF: Fast service, great tasting EVERYTHING! And FREE TEA! Great prices! ALSO, 24/7 business hours!!! Now THAT'S ""Vegas Style!""

AGAINST: They don't like it when you take something from a cart, dislike it, and want it taken off your bill.",cVZzUpsP19uGZ9KqcsNOsw,2,2,5,LWur_0A6PCVYkrSu9K4Xbw

- scallop dish was flavorful (first time I've had it too!)
- black bean spare ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender

The best story I have is from a late night dinner.  Apparently they have 2 late night menus.  One in Chinese with english translation.  The second is in english.  Apparently the english menu is much more in price.  I can't remember exactly but my friend's mom had to ask the waiter why we were charged more. The waiter responded that we didn't ask for the other menu and therefore were going to be charged the ""Non-Chinese"" price.  He seemed to not care.  After about 10 minutes of going back and forth, my friend's mom persistence won out and we got the ""Chinese"" price, which was at least a 30% discount. 

They were pretty rude and it never ceases to amaze me how rude my people can be.  They'll straight out try to hustle you, and when you call them out on it, they'll keep defending it.

On another occasion at dim sum,  a friend of mine saw one of the employees heat the item in the microwave as they were walking through the restaurant.

The wait staffs were reasonably attentive to clear the empty plates and fill the empty tea pot.

3413954,2013-09-10,0,vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q,"One of the things I was most excited about in moving to Las Vegas was being able to have proper dim sum (served on carts and not from frozen, pre-made stuff).  This place came highly recommended by a longtime local so we decided to stop in and try it out. Overall we were pretty disapointed. 

So with that in mind, here was our experience.  We came in and were seated pretty promptly, and, after a few minutes got some dim sum and some tea.  We got some sesame balls, some shu mai, and several diferent steamed dumplings.  All of it was really tasty.  This cart, which also had desert offerings, then disappeared never to be seen again. After a while another cart came by and we got several more offerings, all of which were also really good. This cart then also vanished for a while, then came back again to offer us some spork buns for a second time (we'd declined them the first time since neither of us are a fan of them) steamed pork buns.  Shortly thereafter this cart was restocked and then disappeared to the other end of the restaurant. After about 15 to 20 minutes passed and we'd long since finished our offerings, and the restocked (and only) cart had still not returned, but a passing waitress stopped in to ask if we were ready for the bill. I said no as we were waiting for some more carts to come by and she went off to look for it.  Probably another 5-10 minutes passed and finally the cart, which had now been decimated by two tables that came in after the cart had been restocked, returned but all the new stuff that it had been stocked with was gone.  We took one item from this cart and then asked for the bill and got out of there. 

I get that if you're at the end of your dim sum service you're not going to pump out a bunch of new stuff, but if you're going to continue having the service you should have at least a decent range of things available. Plus, we'd sat there for quite a while without getting any more food and it was obvious that we were looking around to see where the carts were but no one came by for what seemed like an eternity (as I said it was 15-20 minutes).  And its not like we had a table full of food during any of that time. Heck its not like we'd had a ton of food or even a normal amount of food up to that point. And no one came by to offer more tea or water either. What was frustrating was that when they restocked that cart, they did it right in front of our table and then zipped away (at this point we had maybe two items on the table), so we got to see what was on there but never got to try any of it. Its too bad because the dim sum that we did have was really quite good, but the selection at this point in the day was extremely lacking. Our friend swears this was unusual, and given that we liked the food we'll probably stop in at some point when its earlier in the service period to try some other offerings, but I'll certainly think twice before doing so (and before sending anyone else over here).",76xS0Vin4uT25XKaxbsvmQ,1,0,2,KVn3B15D28N1d9y-q53u_w

We had the ""si mai"" (yellow pork steamed dumplings with mushroom and a red dot sometimes.. excuse my pronunciations) That's usually what I get at dim sum and it was pretty good. Also had the ""hai cau"" which is the white/translucent steamed dumplings with shrimp inside. I didn't know some of the translations in Chinese so I do what I usually do which is point when I see something on the cart I like. The other dish we got was the white folded slippery noodle sheets with shrimp on the inside and soy sauce. That's usually my favorite dish. The last one we had was the sticky rice in the banana leaves. That was delicious. 

It's a little frustrating when I want something, but I don't see it so I can't point. The next time I go I will probably just memorize the pronunciations of the food I want. Language barriers are the last thing you want to deal with when you are hungry and can't describe the food you want to eat, but you know it's sitting somewhere in that cart of silver trays. 

Casual dress. Good price. $30 for three people is usually what you get for dim sum.

Service: not very many people to help us, but that was pretty unnecessary since we filled our table with food the second we say down.

What I liked: fried noodles, it was pretty basic. Didn't have too much taste but it was good enough for seconds
Shumai: pretty flavorful and very addicting
Shrimp gow: it's just a must if you're eating dim sum:

Let down: the duck. I was pretty excited and basically the only person at the table that wanted it. I think everyone else was right because I've definitely tried better

Crispy Skin Roast Pork (*** 1/2) A little dry. Skin will remind you of the Mexican dish,  Chicharrones.

Eggplant Shu Mai (****) Eggplant with attachment of Shrimp - huge pieces of Chinese Eggplant, shiny silvery Green, with a ball of Shrimp attached to the center of the Eggplant. Unique.

Sesame Seed Ball (****) Sticky Sesame Seeds covering a Sweet Bean sticky chewy interior. Light, and Chewy!

Shrimp Dumpling (**** 1/2) A delicate steamed Dumpling with chopped-up Shrimp filling and a thin rice flour almost clear skin.

Steamed Meatballs (****) Steamed Ground Beef shaped balls covered with a thin egg noodle skin.

Taro Cake (***) Taro cake is a dish made from the vegetable Taro. Each plate comes with three squares... it is semi-crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. In Bay Area Dim Sum establishments, there is usually some kind of meat embedded in or on top of the Taro Cake. Unfortunately, none in this particular version.

Pot of Hot Tea.

Atmosphere is upscale Hong Kong. A glass partition separates the upper level guests from those sitting at the exterior windowed walls. Would swear I remember a similar type of partition at a restaurant in Hong Kong... Seemingly, everyone who exited Cathay House was driving either a Lexus or a Mercedes.

From the Cathay House of about 2 or 3 years ago, no less. I wonder what happened? Cathay House used to be a go-to for my friends and family, but somehow the overall quality has been declining, and this last visit made us realize that. 

The dishes now have simple, fundamental issues with them, like very thick dumpling skin that sticks to the dish, and vegetables that are not very fresh and crisp. The tea was clearly oversteeped. The highlight of the meal was actually the tripe, which was very clean and had great texture. Have prices creeped up over the years? We racked up a $70 bill for what didn't seem like very much food, especially in between all the limp veggies and half-filled dishes.

The service and cleanliness have also gone downhill; where I feel like Cathay House used to clearly be the nicest dim sum place in Chinatown, I can no longer say the same. While the servers are fairly patient and accommodating as usual, one of our party observed that some of kitchen staff don't perform the required hand wash after a bathroom visit, and that they were talking on their cellphones in the kitchen! I'm not sure what to think, between being disappointed, and being hopeful that Cathay would return to its former glory, but I do know that for the first time we'll be looking for a new dim sum place.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,0,0,2,RUrXhftBLGuz3vIf70x9GQ

We flagged down the server and told him.. He told us to tell the cashier.. When we went up for the bill and explained to the cashier our little situation, she said we had to talk to the server... WTF! So we went back to the table and flagged down the server who then flagged down the manager. We explained what was going on and the manager said ""Sorry, we still have to charge you for it since you ate it.."" At this point I was beyond annoyed and explained to him the difference between us not being pleased with the dish and the dish being unpleasing because it had turned bad.. I showed him how we did not touch it besides the little bite that was spit back out and that maybe he too should try the nasty thing....!!!

2.  Traffic- This is inside the restaurant, since it is very important for a great dim sum place to have high traffic to keep the food rotating and fresh and hot.  This place is always busy.

3.  Cart Frequency - The frequency of the cart coming around is just right.  Just as we were running out of one type of dim sum and people wanted more, the cart was always a few minutes away. Very easy.

4.  Service - Quick and they will get you your tea, ice water, fork as quick as you can imagine. Perhaps not elegant service, but very efficient.

5.  Food quality - The selection is great and the taste is very good. From the norma favorites such as:

Siu Mai
Cheung Fun
Chicken Feet
Spareribs with black bean sace,
BBQ bun

These are all very tasty!  The waiters will even ome by with specials such as chow mein, or chinese broccoli.  They know how to do it right.

Firstly, we were absolutely famished, so we got a few items such as the soy sauce flavored fried noodles, har gow, cha siu bao, tripe, tendon. Everything was just so-so. They also didn't have some of the items we were craving. I suggested that we just leave and perhaps go eat somewhere else later since we had filled our tummies some and weren't about to keel over in hunger.

4974808,2006-11-28,2,vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q,"The mission is on...to find a decent dim sum restaurant in Vegas and Cathay House was first on my list.  Originating from San Francisco, finding a stellar dim sum restaurant in the desert will definitely be a challenge!  But I'm on it!

Cathay House was voted best dim sum in the local papers and received other accolades as noted on its wall.  I had high expectations!  

It was bustling on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2.  Once seated in the main dining room, ice water, tea, and forks arrived immediately.  (Forks?)  Okay, so there were chopsticks already on the table but I guess out here, they are used to people asking for forks.  

There wasn't a huge variety of dim sum dishes to choose from, so that was already disappointing.  I did try the chicken feet in black bean sauce.  This dish lacked the full flavor that I'm used to.  The standard shrimp dumpling (har gow) and pork dumpling (shumai) were basic, if anything.  The salt and pepper shrimp had been sitting out too long after being stir-fried, not a good choice.  The beef rice noodle with a light soy sauce should be cut up to share a bit easier.  The crab claw puffs were average.

I was anxious for the Shanghai dumplings, which they did not have.  Or the Shark Fin dumpling in soup with red vinegar and ginger slices to dip into.  Two of my favorites, and they were not available.  (And trust me, I did ask more than one employee for it.)

Looking around for dessert, there were no egg custard tarts available or black sesame rolls.  I did see the sweet tofu, but that was about it.     

There were a lot of dishes that weren't being ordered, in other words...they looked stale as they passed our table numerous of times.  When you see the same cart pass you when you first sit down, and realize that the same dishes are still not moving on it an hour later, the turnover of food is not happening here.

I also think it's odd that they serve dim sum until 10 pm.  In my opinion, a true tea house restaurant should only serve dim sum during brunch hours.  That is the whole point of ""drinking tea' aka yum cha or going for dim sum.  

Overall, I don't plan on returning here unless I haven't found a better place yet.  My dining companion says this place WAS worthy of a three star in the past, but he had to change his review to a two now.  Sad sad.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,9,4,2,ka4VhasvqSJyLZ845xsNyQ

Having found KJ Seafood and Dim Sum at the Rio a good value for high quality cart service as a packed dining room assured freshly circulating plates throughout our ninety minute stay it was with a group of five that I sat down at Spring Mountain staple Cathay House hoping to further dispel rumors of Sin City's subpar dim sum but with slipshod service and too few patrons even on Saturday at noon the results were, at best, mixed.  Starting at the door where hasty greetings lead us to the back room it would be less that thirty seconds after seating that the blitzkrieg began - baskets and steamers that had clearly been propped against the wall shoved in our faces with several selections requiring an unannounced trip to the kitchen microwave - and kicking off with a trio of steamed options it was only BBQ Pork buns that proved competent as rubbery XLB and Shu Mai skins undermined otherwise juicy contents.  Still frenetic in pace as a $16 lobster special with slippery noodles swimming in ginger found its way to the table alongside a trio of excellent baked pastries it would unfortunately not be long before these gems were lost amidst overly salted garlic smelt and a dry coconut sponge, the duo immediately leaving me parched  as beverage refills lagged.  Admittedly underwhelmed at this point but willing to go one more round it was at long last (actually only 40 minutes) that Cathay House would rally with a strong finish from a duo of kitchen fresh carts - the crispy duck, sticky pork ribs, and supple shrimp balls all piping hot and reference standard leaving me to wonder what could have been had everything else been delivered fresh.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,1,2,J7Xe9ofx3KEYjCxih7gGYg

English! What can I say? Live in America and still don't speak or at least understand English? Waiter offered no apology when we pointed it out several times that the order was coming too fast.

And to break the camel's back, the bill that was handed out to us was in CHINESE???
Really? 

My other friend told me that this place had been closed before by the health department for violations.",S2ygaci0w6EM0tuQU_erwQ,0,0,1,Ys_5p_5V7UHTbNIfYtoQ2w

The ladies were NOT real knowledgeable about the food on their carts.  And they don't communicate in English real well. So from time to time we got pork instead of chicken, 3 pork buns instead of 2, and not so great service.

For instance, the lady at the table next to us had all her stuff on our fourth chair.  We mentioned to the waiter that she had her stuff on our fourth chair and he responded with ""I know"" and told us to put our stuff on the railing instead. Verse asking her to move it. And PS she almost walked out without it we had to remind her it was there.   So to say they are not to keen on white folk probably is a fair statement.  They also seemed to be getting upset with us when they couldn't answer our questions correctly in English.

Here's the most important thing to know about this place
1.  Don't come for the ambiance
2. DO COME FOR THE FOOD!

Been coming to this place for a couple of years... My favorite dish here is the 
SOY SAUCE NOODLE!  Oh how I dream of you!
Simple: Egg noodle, sprouts, onions..... THAT's IT.. and yet OH SO GOOD!

DIMSUM - FANTASTIC
Starts at 10:30am.  SUGGESTION:  Don't get so much until about 11AM..
You mostly get all the steamed dumplings, chicken feet when they first open.  After 11AM... the rest comes out.  crispy pork, bbq pork (sliced or rib), chinese brocolli, fried shrimp, Fish...... 

And the best thing ever.... They are OPEN TILL ABOUT 4AM/5AM!!!!

After a night out in Las Vegas..
Sometimes... you just need some good asian food to soak up all the ""fun stuff"" you consumed that night!

 Depending on how busy they are really seems to correlate with the service you get. We have been there with great service and then other times I think they forgot we were even there.

It can get really busy there so make sure to go early. The weekends are the busiest but if you go before 11 you should be able to get seated pretty quick.

1. less dimsum options
2. Did I mention less options? lol 

Dimsum itself was okay, but they did sort of fail to meet my expectation in terms of variety, because in the end, I m craving dimsum mainly because I like to eat lot of different dishes in small portions.

5594300,2014-08-17,0,vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q,"I love love love Chinese food. I have friends who own a Chinese restaurant in North County (San Diego) -  their food is spectacular, and their customer service is second to none. I've come to expect similar experiences wherever I choose to dine.

However, during a recent trip to Las Vegas, my expectations were, for lack of a better term, pissed on! My friends decided to have dim sum at Cathay House Chinese Cuisine. They claimed that this place served good Chinese food. I've come to decide that they lied to me!

Dining here was an absolute WTF moment for me. For one, the food was subpar. The rolls were not baked fully, and the chicken feet lacked flavor, yet were swimming in suspicious looking sauce. My sweet and sour chicken was neither sweet nor sour - the cook apparently could not be bothered to put sauce on my dish. I will say their noodles were . . . edible, but a little salt would have gone a long way.

The food aside, the piss poor customer service was criminal! Apparently, the staff at Cathay have clearly designated roles from which they would not deviate. Every time I'd ask a food server for something, they'd tell me, rather rudely, ""That's the waiter's job, not mine."" Twice when we asked for more water, we were told everyone at the table already had a glass (did the service staff not notice our glasses were empty? We were in a desert, and needed our hydration!). My favorite WTF moment came when I asked for a fork. I got a baby-sized plastic fork to use instead. Did I fail to mention that any request we made was ""honored"" with dirty looks?

My friends were horrified, I was pissed, and the pennies we left behind as a tip hopefully conveyed our displeasure with Cathay House of Chinese Cuisine. The entire staff (save for the cashiers) need some training in cooking and customer service.",klZOQeegIrwk0mWzSQ3nsQ,2,0,2,fVxKxLCLNhqQqTcp2Roegg

I'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one OR a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson. It wasn't the greatest of experiences right?

Well, meet the DIMSUM version.

I really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis OR have been set STRICT ASIAN QUOTAS (those having worked overseas OR know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have DAILY quotas to meet...OR else ADIOS bish). They sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-track...and pushing for sales a LOT more aggressively than I would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the month.

Best part? The moment they knew I spoke Chinese...they went gung-ho-YOU-need-MORE-meat-on-you-SON-""YOUTOOSKINNNNNNNNNNNNNY"" on me. (Bish, please...you look anoxeric! Maybe?) Well, they still WON...since I tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum carts...and found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eaters.

Yet, this place, which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that I randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on LOCAL food joints), isn't that great. (I think I got trolled.)

Oilier dimsum...below average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland...)...and ISN'T PIPING HOT...meh

But what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegar...and if you know your dimsum (OR even any other food in general)...this ISN'T A GOOD SIGN. Maybe, the health department might have to come over for an (S)INspection...before, as comedian Russel Peters imitates his dad, ""Somebody Gonna Get a Hurt Real Bad"".

If you're craving dimsum, I'd say...just wait until you get out of Vegas and hit a real spot instead. And if you HAVE to be here, please don't order the dimsum BUT order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh, the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in it.

It may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame. (Don't ask).",4DN9WS2gf7Y2SYh0LaqDqA,14,12,1,MRI6l01qQiI4FqAK96a6ww

I'm really disappointed Vegas!

So this has got to be the worst Dim Sum restaurant I've been too. With food and service. Usually service is horrible at dim sum, because its dim sum. They feel the need that they don't need to check up on you, because they have the little ladies with carts going around, and around serving you what you choose. Which isn't that bad.

But this place... As soon as we got seated, they brought out our water in PLASTIC disposable cups, when everyone else had regular re- used washable cups. How do you run out of cups? Very classy for a ""nice"" restaurant. And we had also got tea, chrysanthemum tea. As I poured it into my tea cup, I looked in and saw that a bug came out of the pot! It was disgusting! We couldn't even get anyones attention to change it out. Or for them to take it away.

Also, our Soy Sauce bottle was empty!! They didn't even notice to give us a new one, we had to switch it out with the table next to us.

And at last,, the food. It was COLD. Dim sum is suppose to be hot. Steaming hot. But it was so cold, it was breaking apart. Horrible I tell you.",zokFZ9Rz0ItNdm99SuPgJQ,4,3,1,ZUk_RMdXYFNrDe0lQKkrmA

We arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. 

They pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at $15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off.

The rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable.
