I'd say 5 stars for value, but minus 1 because I wanted to die afterwards. It was simply too much food and let me tell you, I can eat! 

 We went to lunch, dinner, and breakfast.

Lunch: Harrah's. 3.5 stars. Hostesses were slow and there was no one in line. WTF mate? The food was fine. Nothing stood out. 

Dinner: Spice World Market. 5 stars. I loved it. So, so good. Lots of variety and it was yummy! Very fresh. I especially loved the Mediterranean section. 

Breakfast: Caesar's Palace. -4 stars. Yes, negative four. Where's the food? Where is the variety? Why is every tray practically empty? Why did I waste my breakfast here? Seriously people, it's tiny. Avoid like the plague.

1. started with Carnival Buffet @ Rio around 8pm
2. breakfast Villiage Buffet @ Paris
3. lunch Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood
4. another dinner before 8pm Villiage Buffet @ Paris

4 buffets in 24hrs. 

Carnival Buffet has gone way down in quality, but maintain good service.
a lot of food for sure but nothing really stood out, crab legs were very small and waiting was crazy. 
Villiage Buffet was actually the our favorite. better quality
crepe station was excellent and prime rib was good.
Spice market was ok. middle eastern section was interesting but the taste was very average overall.",dBdgHFnTzkIdl0dd4p9Law,1,1,4,mcjscZIds3uf9owS8YgcRQ

Flamingo was closed at dinner, didn't go to Rio at all, wasn't going to pay extra for Caesars (but have been there before & it's good). I've been to Paris buffet 3 times now & it's great for dinner but we waited over 1/2 hr in line to get in at 7pm on a weekend.  Good selection of foods. Harrah for breakfast--they had a good spread & a self serve drink station.  Server was attentive & nice.  Lots of dessert & omelette bar.  Ate Planet Hollywood last--atmosphere is dark as it's in basement. Spread was different but seemed good.  Fun cotton candy for dessert.  Felt ill about a few hours after though and wasn't looking forward to 7AM flight home.

Best word of advice--go around 7-8pm so you can have dinner, breakfast, lunch & dinner & any meals you want in between.",L-nnEUlKP56pUDgJ7Rz0sw,2,1,3,u7MhS8bxDZSDeHOk8oKkWg
156819,2012-10-02,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,A lot of variety. A few need to be revamped. Spice market the best. Paris a close second.,lWB3TRAAowTepLzn3Gp8oA,0,0,4,K8TSWwJtfNgVsxLxs7Gp9Q
186430,2012-12-12,4,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I have done this deal twice and I'd like to say that it's worth it. 
For $50 you get to eat as many meals as you can fit in within 24 hours. Most people would probably be able to get 2-3 meals within those 24 hours. 
Without it, a buffet would cost anywhere from $30-$60. 
I know that some of the other yelp reviewers say that you have to eat fast and time it right but I think that as long as you get two meals in, you've received your money's worth.
In a way, it's a lot like getting a season pass at an amusement park. Even if you go three times in that whole year, you've spent less than you would if you had bought three individual tickets so it's well worth it.

I've only had a chance to go to the Rio and Paris buffets and I am absolutely satisfied. 
The Rio one is perhaps the bigger of the two and it has a variety of foods including pho and wonton soup for my asian food craves.

I have to say I was a little disappointed by the Paris buffet. It had a lot less food than I had expected but if you really love crepes and dessert, this is where to go. Also, the service is great and the people are friendly.

As for tips,
I recommend getting the wristband as late as you can before closing so that you can have a more flexible schedule for dinner the next day. 
Also, it is never too late. Your wristband lasts until the minute it reaches 24 hours. I remember the last time that I went, my wristband was supposed to expire at 7 pm. My boyfriend and I rushed to the Paris buffet only to find a super long line. It was 6:59 but I refused to give up so I went to the customs desk to the left of the line and told the friendly lady at the desk that my wristband is about to expire but I'd like to squeeze in one last meal. She smiled and gave me a receipt for two at the buffet and told me to show the cashier at the line my receipt and proceed to the line to be seated.
I didn't want to wait in the same line for the cashier where people were waiting to pay for their meal so I skipped to the front and told the girl showing people to seats that I already had my receipt and asked if she could seat me. 

She asked if everyone in my party already paid and I said yes so she took my boyfriend and me right in.
So we basically saved 45 minutes of standing in line and managed to squeeze in a meal with one minute to spare.

Also, if you happen to walk past a buffet while you're going about your day on the strip, and the buffet has no line going in, feel free to stop by and grab a gelato or a cheesecake. Because you can. So there.

I have yet to try the other buffets on the list but I heard that the Planet Hollywood one is superb. Either way, the great thing about buffets is that there will most likely be food that you like. Remember, a buffet is not for eating as much as you can; it's to give you a variety of foods to choose from. Don't like the food you chose? pick another! wish you had more? go get some more!

Oh, and the wristbands are waterproof in case you were wondering so don't go showering with your arm hanging outside your tub in the hotel.",0H3Mn3Sr6q-d-i3nFdWTWQ,19,4,4,bkHxF0KJ_D7Hdmk47o6diw
187577,2011-04-06,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"This is a great value, and pretty fun to do.  But the food is just ok.  I am giving 5 stars for the idea along.  We had Paris for breakfast and the best part was the crepes.  I ordered my plain because I like lemon, so I do that.  All my group got hooked on it.  Then we had RIo for lunch.  Nothing was really that great.  But there is a huge selection.  I think I liked the pho best.  This was probably my favorite just due to choices.  I also like the hotel, and pool.  For dinner we tried PH.  It has a good selection as well.  I would say it had the best food of all of them.  Except the crepes weren't fresh.  I liked the prime rib.  Deserts were the worst of all we tried.  Then we snuck in an early breakfast before our time was up.  We went to flamingo because it was the closest.  I have to say I was very impressed.  It had a great setting, no lines, and it was very clean and fresh.  They had fresh mad pancakes and waffles, crepes and omelets .  Lots of fresh fruit.

We bought the pass in Rio around 9.30pm, just one hour before it closed the buffet. There were a lot of choices but the food was just ok. The Chinese counter is NOT up to standard. The next day, we tried Paris breakfast, Planet Hollywood lunch and Paris dinner, making full use of the pass. All buffet I tried offered snow crab legs. I'd say Planet Hollywood is the best but Paris is fine as well.

We were staying at Ballys, so we ended up at Le Village and Carnival World Buffet (free shuttle to the Rio) the most with one stop at the Spice Market Buffet. The food at all 3 locations was great and the lines were not nearly as bad as what some of the other reviews made them out to be. 

The deal is great, but you have to make sure you pace yourself enough to actually eat enough times to justify the price! That said, if you love buffets and can handle a day's worth of all-you-can-eat, don't even hesitate! If you think you'd be better off just purchasing separate meals, or you do't think you could eat all that much, maybe think of other options.

We are not big breakfast eaters so we planned a dinner, lunch and a 2nd dinner.  First get the Total Rewards card to save $5.  (All adults must have a card). The other benefit is you will not have to wear this annoying bracelet for 24 hour. We planned a 7:15 pm dinner, lunch and then a 7:00 pm dinner on the second day.

We also chose not to go to Caesar or Rio Seafood buffets since these require additional charges.  We went to Planet Hollywood, Paris Paris and the Rio World buffets. Here is our rankings by best, very good and good.

#1:  (Best) - Rio World buffet for dinner was excellent!!  There is an amazingly huge selection of a variety of cuisines to select from.  The quality was great with very fresh items and also seafood included.   Ate tons of crab legs and sushi!!  They had many more items offered that the other buffets did not.  Lots of flavors of Gelato  ice cream which was refreshing.

You do have to drive here (not on the strip).  I think there is a shuttle that you catch on the strip. Definitely worth the drive!!  We would make the effort to eat here again.

#2:  (Very good) - Planet Hollywood for lunch was very good!!  Lots of selections of a variety of cuisines.   Desserts were excellent.  Very fresh crepes!!  Quality of food was good.  Service was excellent.

#3:  (Good)  - Paris Paris for dinner was okay.  It used to be much better but their selection is not as extensive as Rio and Plant Hollywood.  Crepes were huge!   Cream brûlée was very good.  Soup was pretty good but quality of the other food was just okay.",o1InP22bDnp7Xdqyaevqrg,13,4,4,KXvLZLta27LX5tDfmfcARg

This is well worth if to eat for 3 meals in a day.  It bascially ends up costing you $15 per meal, you can eat as many times as you want in 24 hours as 6 different buffets. 

The buffet that I enjoyed the best was the Buffet at the Paris hotel. The food was decent, the service was decent, and I enjoyed the deserts. The only downside was the wait was about 25 minutes or so to get in.  


The only set back is there really are long lines at the buffets, even the not so good ones. I would not recommend the buffet at the Flamingo Hotel, food was bad the service was bad as well.",wagGfUbla9tIs0dxdYUqrQ,0,0,4,WGF3XpN41mygMADOE6GtBg

414350,2012-09-12,6,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"This is definitely worth it folks! Even if you just eat 2 meals, it's still the cheapest (quality) ticket in Vegas. Especially if you do what all the hard core people do (I researched the buffets...ahem...)  and start your 24 hours later in the dinner hour on the first day so that you can get TWO dinners during the 24 hours...not to mention a possible breakfast and lunch!

I was working a big corporate convention and STILL mentioned to get my 2 dinners in. So it was totally worth it. Most (if not all) of the buffets are open til 11pm, so that helps. I had to be at work before the 7am opening for breakfast (I KNOW!)---so I missed out on that. But my good friend who had also bought the buffet ticket with me was a champ and brought a piece of the buffet (a bear claw) to me! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  #lifeofcrime

We went to dinner the firs night at Spice Market in Planet Hollywood.  It was solid. Decent selection, and at 830pm on a Monday night we didn't have to wait long. I ate mostly stuff from the Middle Eastern station. Lamb kabobs, chicken curry and rice with lentils. YUM!
Tried a bite of the Key Lime cupcake before we left but it wasn't worth finishing. The cupcakes were plain with a bit of flavored stuff in the middle, with cheapy sugared whipped cream icing.  Also too dense, texture wise. Not in a 'thick, I'm filled with butter' kinda way, but in a 'I was overcooked in the oven or don't have enough baking soda/powder' kinda way. But then, you MUST remember, my sister is a baker and I am a cupcake snob. So, yeah.

Since we were staying at Bally's, we stopped to get the made to order dessert crepes at the Le Village buffet in Paris on the way home. 2 buffets in the same night. That's what you do with a 24 hour buffet pass people. Come on!

The crepes were AMAZING. Totally great life choice. And then tonight, we went to Paris for the dinner buffet, since it's swankier than the Spice Market buffet (which we discovered the night before when we got the dessert crepes) . I got the banana one with carmel sauce instead of chocolate. YUM!

For dinner I had the prime rib with the mushroom sauce (YES!), the mac n cheese with truffle sauce and mushrooms or something (not to be confused with the very bland shells with brie and bacon - don't waste your time here), scalloped potatoes and french green beans with almonds. Delicious!

Didn't even bother with the other buffets cause they were farther away and the reviews weren't as good. But with the Spice Market and Le Village being right next to each other, you really don't NEED any other options. 

Be happy. Eat good food in Vegas that doesn't make you poor.",l4puI_12chBQ-INcbfJ8vg,11,2,5,BweV7TgUjbFZX1tChdkxLg
460060,2011-06-23,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Hey guys, I just want to give a review of the 3 buffets that we managed to make it to for the Buffet of Buffets. I can say that since we went to 3 that we made our money back. I won't be doing this again unless I buy my first meal after 8 pm. Let me say, I HIGHLY recommend waiting as late as possible to buy your first buffet! We ended up buying it at 715, had our dinner and then the next day we had breakfast around 10 am, then lunch around 2 pm. We were not at all hungry for dinner by 7... not for a buffet anyways. If we had waited until 8 then we would have been hungry, or at least enough for a slow big dinner. Does that make sense? Okay so anyways, I can say that we made it to some good buffets. 

Dinner around 7pm night one: Planet Hollywood (Spice Market Buffet)
I came here the last time I was in Vegas and was EXTREMELY impressed! It was good that it wasn't just a one time thing. This Buffet is delicious!! There is plenty to choose from and the quality is really good. The butterfly shrimp is amazing with the sweet chili sauce(trust me try it!!!)  If your choosing which buffets to try, I HIGHLY recommend this one to be at the top of your list. They have cotton candy!! 

Breakfast around 10am day two: Harrah's (Flavors buffet)
This was just breakfast so it was really good I don't really know how you can mess up breakfast though. Just do breakfast wherever you are staying. I can say that the size of the buffet was pretty good, so I am assuming that they would have a good selection at lunch and dinner. They have gelato ice cream!! 

Lunch around 2pm day two: Rio (World buffet)
Okay, so this buffet comes in a close second place to The Spice Market. I see it like this, if you want Quality, choose Spice Market, but if you want Quantity, choose World Buffet. It really is a world buffet. This buffet is HUGE!! I was so impressed when I walked in, I didn't know where to start!! They have so many things, I liked it here because they have simple foods like hamburgers and Hotdogs! So there is something for the kids too (Spice market is not as kid friendly). I really enjoyed this buffet. Gelato ice cream here and pretty good cannolis!! 

I have eaten at the Flamingo buffet (Where we are staying) and it is not worth it at all!! The buffet has very little to choose from compared to the others. I don't recommend wasting a lunch or dinner on it. Breakfast or a snack would be fine, but not a big meal. I do LOVE their chocolate fountain though!! 

I didn't even want to try imperial palace because of the bad reviews. I wouldn't have minded trying the Paris one, but we just didn't have time. 

Hope this review helps!! Have fun in Vegas!! :)

492534,2013-02-10,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"This is actually the order we ate in. A late dinner to the next night. It all went down hill from dinner. 
For late dinner  we went to Bacchanal at Caesars palace. It was quite busy and the buffet as a vast variety of things to eat. It was probably the best for choices but as for taste it wasn't as good as I thought it would be for the price($75) for dinner. That is the cost for the B.O.B with the extra for the Caesars buffet dinner. The dessert section huge but only half of them were actually enjoyable. The meats were dry and tasteless. And there were oysters which I did enjoy. But the breads were too hard to enjoy and I would skip the pastas. Sushi was meh. And Chinese didn't look to appetizing. The Mexican station wasn't bad. And they had mini burger sliders except they should cook the patties a little longer. They had cute little basket holders for the fries and chicken wings. And of course crab legs station was busy but I never liked crab. 
Then moving on for breakfast/ lunch at Le Village. No line at noon.  This was my most satisfying meal for me. The selection wasn't as huge but the food had flavor. The buns were soft( I love carbs) and the cavatappi pasta was good. Also the roasted veggies. All good esp the sweet potatoes. I had the tri tip and that was seasoned nicely as well and sausages weren't dry the night before. THey had good hummus. And made crepes to order which i'm told was good if the berries were not frozen. The coffee was served in your own carafe and it was nice and strong. They do have there own little bakery section with croissants and cookies and such. Croissants,not bad. Salad bar was little sad. Had no wait at all which was really nice. 
And Harrahs Flavors for a light snack was depressing. No line. Small selection and the food just sucked. They do have a fresh fruit selection so that was good. But that's it. The restaurant didin't have any walls to block us from all that cigarette smoke. So i could smell all the smoke while eating. It really sucks for the non smokers. 
Should i even mention my last dinner of the night at Planet Hollywood, Spice market, downstairs. No line. So dissapointing. Nothing i ate was appetizing at all. Hummus had no flavor and i can't even remember what i ate. THe cupcakes were absolutely disgusting. My daughter tried to cut it open with her fork and it literally just stop the knife in its track. It was hard. And absolutely unedible. It must have been made weeks before and left out. Srsly take my word for it. The only dessert was the ice cream and cotton candy. 
Was BOB worth the extra money. I can say just go to bacchanal and pay for that one alone. . BUt don't do the BOB. We paid too much for bad food. I would have much rather went to eat at different places. Unless u are too cheap and like the whole buffet experience.",duyipL8HZ1RLwJGVubFD2A,2,0,1,1X7oay52CLDbMQ-Rh4Xt2g

You have 24 hours to eat at any of 7 different hotels buffets for only $50. If you get a players card it is $45 but remember in order to get the discount each adult will need to get a players card. We managed to have 4 meals and ate at 3 different buffets.
Day 1:
-6:00pm We started off with dinner at Planet Hollywoods Spice Market Buffet.
  Overall: 4 stars
  Line: ~30 min
  Ambiance: Decor is simple and modern. Movie posters on the wall :)
  Buffet set up: really nice and easy to follow
  Food:The food here was really delicious. It was flavorful and they had a really big variety of foods including Mediterranean, Asian, Seafood, Mexican, and American. Some of my favorite dishes was the warm crab legs, prime rib, skewered tandoori chicken and beef. Their deserts were to die for, especially for me who has a huge sweet tooth. They had a crepe making station, cotton candy, yummy creme brulee, and don't be fooled by the soft serve machine. I thought it was just regular ice cream but nope it was vanilla custard soft serve which had a really thick creamy texture.

Day 2:
-9:00 Le Village Buffet at Paris Paris
  Overall: 4 stars
   Line: ~40 min
   Ambiance: Cozy and cute. Decorated true to its theme, like a Parisan village
   Buffet set up: This is why I I couldnt award it 5 stars. The buffet set up was very muddled and it was difficult to find things. Some food items were somewhat hidden behind lines of people waiting for omelets and crepes. Also these stations had extremely long lines. It was alot less organized than Planet Hollywood and other buffets I have been to.
   Food: Food was really good. I am not really a big breakfast person but I really enjoyed that even though the spread was your typical breakfast foods they had a variety of each food. For example they had several different types of sausages, I tried andouille which was really good.I also tried the banana nutella crepe with candied walnuts which was sugary bliss. Make sure you have the rosemary red potatoes!

We planned on having Caesars for lunch but unfortunately the information desk told us the buffet had closed down a few days ago. This was a little ridiculous since Caesars was listed on most of the ads and was even on our wristbands. Nevertheless we took it in our stride and decided to try Harrahs.

-1:00 Flavors Buffet at Harrahs
  Overall: 2 stars
  Line: ~20 min which was really ridiculous because the restaurant was not packed at all. 
  Ambiance:Simple but clean
  Buffet set up: Easy to follow however alot of the sauces were unaccessable. Also alot of the deserts are behind glass so you have to ask an attendant.
 Food: None of the dishes were exceptional but nothing was bad either... Cookies and cream gelato was really good though.

-5:00 Spice Market Buffet Round 2!
 Yep it was that good! We decided to go again so we could end our buffet experience on a good note and it was 100% worth it. I got to really enjoy all the dishes I liked the previous night. Best part was there was no line when we arrived!

Thing to keep in mind:

My BF and I love going to buffets so we do this every time we go to Vegas together. We bought the pass at rio and ate dinner there around 8pm on Monday. On Tuesday, we skipped breakfast since we were too tired to get up. Around 11am We went to the Spice market buffet for lunch (The lobster bisque at the spice market is really good! I ate like 3 bowls haha!). At 12:30ish we ate at Paris. I honestly only go to Paris for their crepes and nothing else. At 5pm we went to Rio again for an early dinner and then we went back to Paris for a late dinner around 9pm.",IdZbU6KLlcxgVBhaTFQq1g,7,0,5,ucpWLW4bt1atDZbyrstSwQ
574717,2010-09-08,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"My wife and i decided to try the ""Buffet of Buffets"" (BOB) pass for its value. We figured if we could get 3 meals out of it, then its a good deal. But choose your buffets wisely and expect to wait on line, especially on weekends and holidays. There is a choice of 7 buffets. From what I have read, skip the Imperial Palace. This is a lower grade place and have heard it is bad. Also, skip the Flamingo and Ceasars Palace, both are mediocre at best from my experience. 

Now, here was out strategy. We would do a late dinner the first night, early breakfast  the next morning, and then dinner that same day. 3 buffets should be your maximum goal. Any more than that you are eating for the sake of eating and trying to ""win"" your money back. I don't want to think I am trying to beat a casino at its own game. You will never win.

For our first dinner we chose the World Buffet at the Rio. At one time this was the best buffet in Vegas. It is still decent, but it has definitely had a fall from grace in the last 6 years or so. We were here on the Sunday of labor day weekend and the wait on line was about 90min. By the time we started eating it was nearly 10pm. We felt so European. Like I said, the food was decent, the slow cooked meats were good as was the prime rib. Also, good salad bar. I would definitely go again with the BOB. But not worth the $25 base price which is what 95% of the people on line were paying. Also avoid weekends and holidays and your wait on line is more like 15min.
For breakfast the next day, we did Le Village buffet at the Paris. The wait on line was about 25min. Not bad for Labor Day. The food was good breakfast fare. However, the does not resemble French food at all. Basically, it was all typical American fare with French names. For example, Potatoes Lyonnaise resembled under cooked/seasoned potatoes that were stuffed into the broiler to try to finish them off. Overall a good experience with the BOB.

For our last supper on the BOB we chose the Spice Market Buffet at PH. This was out favorite. Overall, most of the food was good, but typical LV buffet food. What put it over the top for me was the Middle Eastern station. They had some freshly grilled kabobs that were absolutely delicious and the sides were great. Good hummus and baba ganoush(?). The pizza was good. Skip the sushi, so so. Would come back again and pay the $25 asking price.

Would I do the BOB again. Yes! Would I follow this strategy of feasting again? For the dinners yes, maybe somewhere else for breakfast or Le Village again. Highly recommend getting the Total Rewards card first and saving the $6. This makes it about $14/meal and about the best deal on the strip.",Fr7AowgZEgtX4rykF1AvuQ,0,0,4,bDrYH5iGjqXwMtKFs1h5oQ

So I usually am a high end coffeeshop junkie while in Vegas and eat twice a day which runs $50-$60 a day. This week I went with a friend who is a buffet lover. Since he hadn't been to Vegas in 6 years it seemed a good option to both make him happy and show him some new sites. The pass is a good motivator to get you moving in Vegas. I usually stick with my faves and don't hop so much when I am on my own or visiting with my friend who lives here.

We visited the following which would of cost of $72 bucks w/o tax if we had not bought the discounted total rewards pass. which was 48.32 total. BTW, being a TR member you DON'T have to wear the dumb wristband which made me super happy! I would of PAID to not wear that!

We visited a Mon/Tues so keep that in mind if visiting on the weekend

Paris (seated 9:25 pm-wait 50 min-disneyland) I liked this buffet and think i would of liked it better it we had gotten there earlier before they run out of stuff like desserts.

Pass on the:  Lamb, fruit looked sad.
Unusual: French suhi? 
Service; so-so, but it was the end of the night. You could feel he wanted to go home.
Non- BOB price: $27   Visit Again? Definitelynon

Spice Market (2pm- 5 min-fast! :) )- My friends fave. It was very clean. If you are a movie junkie you will enjoy the food themed movie posters

Best Dish: The mid-eastern red chicken cabob with hummus and
.taziki. Cotton Candy on a Stick, sausage, Fresh fruit

Pass on the: stuffed seafood, beef lasagna and caprese salad

Service: BAD, Paulina forgot my friend's drink which ruined our lunch because he got upset (She never came back and ignored us/him, tried to apologize way to late. Basically tables who bought alcohol and clearing plates were more important)
non- BOB price: $18       
Visit Again? Definitely, just don't get Paulina

Lago at Ceasars (8;30 pm-10 min, s, thanks Joseuprised)
This casino buffet was the most dissapointing. We decided it is lackluster and small with barely any choices because they want to encourage guests to visit more high end establishments in the forum shops. I almost invited my friend from LV to join us and I am glad I didn't...

Best Dish: sausage, oreo kiss 
Pass On the: too many to list. penne/pesto with bell peppers, visit another buffet on the list , 
Service: Ok, Jose
non-BOB price: $27
Visit Again? No Way, Jose

Fortunately, I did. Unfortunately, we went during Christmas when Bacchanal (at Caesar's Palace) did not accept these because lines were 4 hours long. So couldn't eat there.

But I did consume food at the following buffets: Paris, Rio, Flamingo, Planet Hollywood.

Breakfast in Paris (Le Village): Made to order crepes, omelette station, and biscuits and gravy
Lunch at Rio (Carnival World): Everything. Mongolian-style grill in Asian section.
Dinner at Planet Hollywood (Spice Market): Waited here the longest and was the most disappointed.
Breakfast at Flamingo (Paradise Garden): Crisp waffles in the shape of playing card suits

TIP: Go to the buffets at odd times. We ate breakfast both days around 7:30 am and got right in. Lunch was at 11:30 and dinner was at 4:30.

I have previously been to all 5 buffets on past trips to vegas and have been happy/satisfied with the experience. This was the first time I've  been to any of these 5 buffets since they started the buffet of buffets promo. The quality of the food has gone way down compared to a few years ago. I visited 4 of the buffets (all except Flamingo) on my recent visit and was very dissappointed. Buyer beware! If you think you will be getting a good variety of food choices from 5 different decent buffets you will be very dissapointed. What you will get is 5 nearly identical buffets serving very poor sub par food. Your money would be better spent in any food court.,CxyyQUukCHEuWkQvgREOwQ,5,0,1,t8ml_ofcaYGjCVIUgx1fAw
690237,2011-03-22,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"There's a right way to do this:

1) You will need a Total Rewards card for each of you.
2) Time your first meal so you can get 2 dinners.
3) Go during non-peak times (mid-week, late for lunch, early for dinner) to avoid lines.
4) Avoid the urge to stuff yourself. Otherwise, you'll just essentially be paying too much for one buffet. Have 3 or 4 sane meals and a dessert break. 
5) Focus on what buffet's do well: breakfast, dessert, crab, fresh batches and the odd diamond in the rough.

I think the confusion with whether the food is good or not comes from the point of reference. Las Vegas buffets take every other buffet to the tool shed. However, they will never challenge the quality of good restaurants and good home cooking, at least except for the flan at Paris (OMFG that was good). I am a skilled home cook and have eaten at plenty of fine restaurants. I still enjoy the buffet because having just one or two bites of so many different things is fun and as long as you play to the buffet's strengths, the food is good.

Ironically, the 24 hour buffet isn't a great value in terms of quantity. If you are looking for fuel for the money, you'll be better off buying just one buffet per day, preferably breakfast. I'm a camel so I do fine eating a ton once a day but I suspect lots of people could do fine with a big breakfast and an evening snack.

The value is liberty and food security. You don't need to worry about being hungry or trying to stuff yourself to get your money's worth.",p8z_OtyvLSqBVAU8L3AilQ,0,0,4,--tIlxKH7aHNUOnQUanWIA

The value is still there even with increased prices, and the weekend rates. When you think breakfast from somewhere will likely set you back $10-$15, lunch would be about another $15-$20 and dinner would be more around $20-$30 at the lower priced restaurants. If you're smart with these passes you can get up to 4 meals out of it. Start with a later dinner, then go for breakfast, lunch and earlier dinner the next day. If you don't overeat you will have no problem doing 3 buffets in one day, just plate yourself a single plate similar to what you'd get at any other restaurant. The total value you're getting if you do 4 meals is $65-$95 for only $55 during the week and $70 on weekends. Even if you only do 3 meals of dinner, brunch and then dinner the value is worth it for the weekdays for sure, $50-$75 in approximate meal values for $55. 

 You also have the added benefit of picking what you eat, want a light breakfast of fruit, you get to have that, want prime rib or crab legs, yes those are often options in the buffets. I would put the Paris' Le Village buffet at the top of the list for quality without an up charge and Rio's buffet in second place (the non-seafood one). If you don't want lines or waits, then Vegas really isn't the place for you because at peak times there will be lines everywhere.

Since we were Total Rewards members, we paid $55 each. Beware: you pay upfront for the pass and they will ask you to TIP on the total. I think it's best to write: CASH, and just tip your server personally at each buffet.

1st stop @9pm, Rio Carnival buffet. Waited about 20 minutes in line. HUGE dining room, tons of options! I liked the fried and steamed shrimp as well as the gelato! The crab legs and prime rib were really popular. And the Asian noodle/soup bar was really cool! The Mexican food and pasta was not touched by anyone.....

2nd stop: 9am Harrah's breakfast buffet. Got seated right away! Typical breakfast options: eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, fruit, salad bar, pastries. They did have a free mimosa/bloody mary bar as well as an omelet and crepe station. I didn't try an omelet, but opted for a crepe. The line wasn't too long, but it wasn't worth the wait. The crepe itself was good, but the filling was just plain cherry pie filling from can-- gross! I did like their assortment of pastries and soft-serve ice cream (around the corner, so don't miss it). They also had a lot of sugar-free dessert options! I really liked the seating next to the live flamingos!

3rd stop: 2pm lunch at Planet Hollywood. There was no wait, so we got seated right away! I thought that this was the cleanest, newest, and nicest dining area. I loved the desserts (crème brulee, cotton candy, soft-serve ice cream, etc); some of them were fancy and not just the typical pre-made, store bought desserts. The prime rib and pre-made salads were delish! I loved the Caesar salad! The sliders (both chicken and beef) were disgusting! 

4th stop: 8pm dinner at Le Village at The Paris. We waited in line about 30 minutes. Everyone raves about this buffet, but it was my least favorite! I'm not sure if it was because this was our last buffet and we were sort of buffet-ed out, or because it was a Monday night. The French onion soup was the saving grace! Although I was bummed to have to search for the croutons and cheese to add to it-- should have been right next to the soup! Again, crab legs were popular with other tables, as were the crepes. We waited in line for dinner crepes-- I had a chicken, cheese, and spinach, and my husband had the mushroom. BOTH were TERRIBLE! All of the fillings were cold, and they were not cooked long enough to have the cheese melt. We were both really disappointed. The desserts were also very disappointing-- nothing was good! 

This pass was worth the price since we squeezed 4 buffets in, but next time we are in Vegas, I plan on trying the Spice Buffet, Bellagio, or Wynn, and skipping the pass! I only need one buffet in my life!",LmpDvDCeGtFX54sdroBwew,26,4,4,D2Gc8oonQ-fsJMyHPqjXSg

We did:
  Dinner @ Carnival World (Rio)
  Breakfast @ Le Village (Paris)
  Lunch @ Spice Market (PH)
  Horrible excuse for dinner @ Lago (Ceasar's)
  Slightly better dinner @ Spice Market (PH)



Carnival World: 45 minute wait.

    We ate here for dinner, activating our passes at about 8pm. Some of the food was just so-so, but like with any buffet, the first plate or two is spent just finding what you do and don't like, and from then on it's loading up on the good stuff! Right? The gelato bar was great too. Probably tied for my favorite buffet overall.

Le Village: Zero wait, got there right at 7am.

    Best. Breakfast. Ever. Seriously, the best I have ever had. And I have had thousands upon thousands of breakfasts! The shining star l think is the prime rib hash. Just incredible. Juicy chunks of prime rib, shredded potatoes, mushrooms, onions and peppers..... Heaven on a plate. Also the made-fresh crepe station is a nice touch. I almost said made-to-order, but that's inaccurate since the crepe chef has to 'follow the menu'. No big deal to me, but there was a lady that was quite upset that he couldn't shove every filling on the board into her crepe. Pretty funny I thought. I got the mixed berry crepe and it was fantastic. I don't even like berries!!

Spice Market: Less than 10 minute wait.

     We had lunch here and in my opinion, it was a slightly not-as-good version of the Carnival World. I mean, it was good. The tandoori chicken was great and the fajitas were good too. It just wasn't 'blow me away' good. You know?

Lago: Zero wait.

    Tried it for dinner. Just horrible. Plain and simple. I cannot stress enough how bad this buffet was. Yes, the selection was limited. Reading reviews on Yelp had me prepared for this going in. But the selections they did put forth were just plain disgusting. The ONLY thing that was even edible was their cheese ravioli. It wasn't even great, just the only thing that I was able to take more than one bite of. Baked mac and cheese, tasted like noodles with a light spray of butter and no cheese. Horrible attempt at an asian station I think would offend anyone with asian blood in their veins. Avoid at all costs. So we left, hurried across the street back to Planet Hollywood to get in for dinner there before the pass expired.

Spice Market: 30 minute wait

     The same as lunch, plus some pre-cut crab legs. Not really my cup of tea. The meat was fully exposed since they were cut the long way. Also very, very salty. I understand being a buffet that crab legs are served cold, but this was a miss. Very cold, very salty crab meat just wasn't for me. After the debacle at Lago, my stomach was sort of hurting anyway. l managed to shove one plate of various bits down (hello again, tandoori chicken...) and pretty much just ate some desserts for dinner. It was good. Carnival World is better I think. If not for that damned tandoori chicken, I don't think Spice Market would ever see me again. You can get everything they offer done just a little better at Rio, plus a better dessert bar.

Summary:

  Rio takes the #1 spot for overall greatness of just about everything.
  Paris was a tough contender, but I only ate there for breakfast.
  Spice Market was decent, but sort of a lower quality version of other buffets.
  Lago, I would rate 10th out of 4 if at all possible. This place should be shut down.

Would definitely do this deal again, even if I had to pay for it. I wanted to try Flavors at Harrah's but they were closed during the time l was there. I wouldn't dare to try Imperial Palace after what I had read, and sort of felt the same about Flamingo's buffet.",jKNy8Mg_GiagFkxkdxM85w,1,0,5,lf1OLk2Dtixk6vq9Y_qzGw

1069801,2014-07-21,3,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Not too worth it for me anymore. $70 for a weekend pass, plus you need to pay an additional $15 for the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio (quality of which has gone down tremendously and is no longer worth visiting, see my review) and an additional $30 for the Caesar's Palace Bacchanal. I guess the pass is good if you're avoiding using the upgrades and want to grab a bite or two at different locations (they all start feeling the same though, trust me). But if you're buffet hopping to snack, can you really say you just saved yourself a $30 buffet entrance (example) when you could have easily snacked outside a buffet for less than $10? On top of that, as a person that has gone to both of the Rio's buffets, the Spice World Market at PH, and Le Village at the Paris, you'd really be doing yourself a disservice by not going to the Bacchanal, because you WILL notice the difference in quality immediately and start wondering what you're doing wasting your time hopping through other buffets and filling yourself up on lower quality food. Here's the math for my experience:

Buffet of Buffet weekend pass: $69.99 + $15 Village Seafood Upgrade + $30 Bacchanal upgrade = $114.99 + tax

Without the Pass Dinner: Village Seafood Buffet: $45 + breakfast: Le Village Buffet $23.99 + dinner: Bacchanal $53.99 = $122.98 + tax

I saved $8 by going with the pass. By the time you reach the end of your 24 hour pass, you really start to contemplate if you want to eat anymore, but you do it anyway because you feel like you don't want to waste the opportunity. I think I'm done with this pass.",G7nsYb-oiKqc0ZA5Kt_wWA,18,0,2,MDPVx2EgyAnnswxHvJo6uw

Green Valley breakfast buffet for 6.99... best deal in town... until you spot ""Buffet Buffet""... whaaaat?  It lists Caesars Palace (my favorite of all favorite buffet places), Planet Hollywood (my favorite place until Caesars and Cosmo came along), Paris, Rio, and others I knew I wouldn't go to... so long Green Valley... hello Caesars...
what they don't tell you until you get there is for Caesars it's extra...for breakfast, lunch, and dinner... so we had to pay an extra $15 for breakfast a piece... so $50 plus $15... $65 for breakfast that cost $26... in order to break even I will need to go to other hotels that don't charge anymore... that would be Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, and Rio... Let's do this... well... the buffet at Caesars is over the top great... 5 stars for quality, presentation, and selections (smoked meat from it's smoker, fresh carrot, and watermelon juice in carafes, great individual dishes at all the stations too many to mention... since we paid extra, we stayed for breakfast and lunch.. next stop Paris... the crepes were pretty good, but after going to Caesars it was a definite step down... 5 stars to 3 stars in quality, service, and creativity... we only stayed for 20 minutes and left... my wife and sister in law went shopping while I walked next door to PH to see what things I might have missed... by now I was pretty much done... stuffed... so I picked a few things both savory and sweet... the desserts were mostly cupcakes and kind of dried out cupcakes... I was disappointed in the quality, service, and creativity... no chocolate covered strawberries like I remembered a while back... and after Caesars... it was better than Paris, but I still have to give it 3.5 stars... a distant second place... my final stop was Rio the next morning... I was not expecting much but I was surprised at the variety and the number of stations available to choose from... the quality was much like PH but the desserts and variety was much better... and it had sorbet and gelato, much like Caesars... and for lunch, Mongolian bbq and four types of asian style noodles you could choose from, such as Udon, Pho, skinny noodles Hong Kong style... overall 3.5 stars... 
Was the price worth it?  Would I do it again?  Right now I would have to say ""No"" only because I now know where I would spend my money... and that's Caesars buffet... but if not for Buffet Buffet I still would have wondered... unfortunately I did not get to compare the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan with Caesars Palace... but I can honestly say my number one pick is Caesars Palace Buffet, then the Cosmopolitan buffet and Rio far behind at third...
I will stick to Green Valley for the value breakfast buffet in Henderson and save my money for other obscene experiences... like... gambling?  Nah... time for a good steak... hmmmmmmm... what's Yelp say about the best steak in Las Vegas?",mn2dV0nOi-dSmI1w7dSe8Q,11,1,4,rFc7r_Ex1Zvf42SZjhyrNA

1144619,2017-02-22,5,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"This is definitely worth it! But I'd recommend only doing it once and hitting all the buffets you wanted to try.

I used the buffet of buffets pass during Thanksgiving weekend so the price was about $85 (including tax). And my boyfriend and I were able to do 4 buffets. Breakfast, lunch and dinner twice. Also, if you want to dine at Caesar's Palace or Rio Seafood Buffet it is an additional fee per visit ($15-30). But let me tell you, holiday price or not, it is worth it to pay for Cesar's palace. 

Here's a price break down of how I did it:

Buffet of Buffet Pass:                  $85
Caesar's Palace (Dinner):          $40ish
Total:                                          $125  (Tax inlcuded)

Price per Meal:
Dinner at Planet Hollywood:       $35.99 (Holiday Price)
Breakfast at Paris:                      $23.99 (Regular Price - couldn't find holiday price)
Lunch at Rio:                              $38.99 (Holiday)
Dinner at Caesars Palace:         $68.99 (Holiday Price)

Total:                                          $167.96 (Not including tax about $12.60 = $180.56ish)

You save about $50 probably more if it weren't the holiday.


A few tips:

1. Schedule it right. You have 24 hours to use it. If you purchase it during dinner 6-8ish, you have the opportunity to have 2 dinners, the most expensive meals. Dinner, breakfast, lunch and dinner again.

2. Space out the meals, go early during breakfast, so when you have lunch your not to full and by the time you have dinner, around 7-8 you should be hungry?

3. Pace yourself. Don't overeat and indulge in the foods you really want to enjoy.Eat until your full but not to the point you have a food coma (unless its your last meal or you at at Bacchanal).

4. DO dinner at BACCHANAL at CAESARS PALACE. It is WORTH IT!!!! The best buffet dining experience I have ever had. 

5. It's definitely something you should try once if you have time, because this requires a days time. Don't schedule anything that's time consuming within the 24 hours.

There are many more options in Vegas. If you plan to go to Rio because they have lobster, don't bother. They only give you one lobster for the extra charge and other seafood. Out of the buffets that are available. I suggest Harrah's, Paris, Bacchanal, Rio and then Flamingo (if you are so desperate). Again, each one are limited in selection.

Unlimited access to 5 buffets for 24 hrs for 49$ for total rewards members (which is free to sign up at any TR stand). I am all about cleanliness before quality of food. Here is how I would personally rate the buffets. 

1. RIO. don't waste your time elsewhere. Clean and quality of food is AMAZING. They serve food that the other buffets dont and the overall presentation of everything is worth the drive over. Self service of drinks which I love. Shout out to my waiter: LUIS was on Point and very welcoming. Definitely made our dining experience worth while. I hope the manager reads my yelp comment.

2. Harrahs. Definitely cleaner than the rest . The chefs are very pleasant which made dinning very easy. They work so hard to maintain quality of food ON TOP OF cleaning the serving station that the other buffets lack. Self service of drinks.  Shout out to my waiter : ADRIAN. You're awesome and you need a raise for being literally the most hardest working waiter at Harrahs. Everyone else pretty much sucked. 

..... the other buffets I honestly don't care about after eating at Harrahs and Rio. 

Planet Hollywood is also self service of drinks. However I did not find it very clean. Had to inspect 100 cups before using it. However the waitresses were on point. 

Paris. I would recommend eating here once ...just for the venue. Very beautiful and the staff is dressed. Not self service of drinks. Servers were also on point. 

Flamingo. Honestly wouldn't go back. Not self service of drinks. Didn't find it very clean from the Cups to the maintenance of the floors and service counters. My waitress sucked so it also added to my negative comment here. However this venue does overlook the Habitat.",WxjtYGHyNZodrsR4aeSsnw,6,1,5,rnB_kqVuiZOSmNUIEmke6w

1. Planet Hollywood Spice Market - underground, smelled very musky, food isn't unique or particularly great, and service was slow. 
2. Paris Village Buffet - in my opinion, this buffet was the best. Great assortment of dessert (loved the crepe station), prime rib was made perfectly, and you're seated in Parisian atmosphere - even the waitresses were dressed up. 
3. Rio World Buffet - Not sure why everyone else is raving about this buffet, but I didn't find it that amazing in any way. Rio is also far off from the strip - we learned that after attempting to walk there (past a highway) in 40 degrees Celsius..

My main gripe about this is that even though you've essentially already paid for the buffet, you still have to wait in line to get in. That makes absolutely no sense to me, I don't see why there's not some sort of express line or at least allow people with the wristband to enter through the diamond/platinum entrance. It seems borderline pointless to get this pass while waiting in the infamously absurd lines for the Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood buffets. 

Also, I really wish the pass was for 48 hours instead of 24. I originally intended to hit 3 of the buffets (Carnival World, which I omitted in place of Harrah's thanks to how frustrating the line was that night, Le Village at Paris and Spice Market at Planet Hollywood) and yet I only hit two thanks to an almost 3 hour wait at Paris (we got there at 1:00, didn't get in until almost 4:00). Not only were we both no longer hungry after finishing up but the line at the Spice Market was almost as bad as it was at Paris anyway. I think our game plan would have worked much better if we could have spread this out over 3 days, even in a period that's not as busy as Christmastime. Your stomach can only hold so much. 

I felt I did get my money's worth as the price of both of those buffets combined would have come out to be a few dollars more than the price of the promotion. The Harrah's buffet was pitiful, but Le Village more than made up for that and I definitely know I would go to the latter again, so I'll give the Buffet of Buffets that, but I will probably never do this again.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,2,0,3,YcMrOFgg6bNejTiL89NIPw

Our overall experiences were just good, not great, mainly due to the fact that you'll always be full and not being able to enjoy the full experience of each and every buffet that will otherwise bring to you individually.  Honestly speaking, there are three above-average buffets in Planet Hollywood, Rio, and Paris, and four not so good ones.  Was it a great experience?  You bet.  Was it worth it?  Definitely.  Will we do it again?  Probably not.

Make sure you get the reward card.  It's free and it only takes a minute.  This will get you $5 off, but everyone in your party should get one or else they will have to wear a tight waterproof wristband for the next 24 hrs.  People will think you just checked out of the hospital.",WQYLO43or0rUyNmqlp0fLg,5,1,4,O0egrJZl4DfBE2BNCos0fg

1287506,2016-10-02,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"This is worth every penny if you plan well and have a huge appetite.

Buffet of the buffet is $59.99 on weekdays (Sunday 11:01am to Friday 10:59 am and $79.99 (Friday 11:01 to Sunday 10:59am). These prices are for total rewards members and good for 24 hours per person. I think for non members its $5 more. 

Here are my reviews on the following buffets arranged according to my choice and what I think is best:

1. Rio carnival- various choices. They have different types of cuisines of Italian, Asian, Mexican and American. They also have salad bars and dessert stations. The area is huge and spacious. One of the favorites here is the made to order soups.

2. Paris Le Village Buffet- I like their made to order crepes. Crepes can be dessert or meal of your choice. They also have meat cutting sections from beef to pork.. They have good egg's benedict too. And you can get mimosa drink for free.

3. Spice Market on Planet Hollywood- They have good choices also and what stands out here is their stuffed sole which is made of fish and crab. You can find this in their seafood section. They have good meat stuffed cheese lasagna as well and pesto pasta.

4. Harrah's flavors- They have good options too like Spice Market but its more spacious here. They have funny way of food categories(splash,ciao,ole and prime). 

5. Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet- They have good set up where you can see flamingos and japanese koi fishes from where you are seated but the food is not that great compared to the four mentioned. It's standard American food even. You might find made to order burger good here if you like that.

Overall this is a good experience. My husband and I were happy not to mention stuffed to try this.",js0QYGOY8WDVzIjxN6M9Lg,20,0,5,tMSSLx34t6bKbLgzCO-5tQ

1294764,2011-03-09,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I went to Vegas for my first time recently. After reading a majority of the reviews on Yelp I decided that the Buffet of Buffets would be worth the money. I got a Total Rewards card (why not, it's free) then purchased the BoB. We started at Rio Carnival for dinner @ 6:38pm. I was highly disappointed since so many Yelpers raved about it. There was a HUGE selection of food, but at best it tasted mediocre. Plus the line was ridiculous. The saving grace was the dessert (bananas foster killed) and our server Krystyna who never let our drinks empty. We were staying at the Paris so it made sense to have breakfast @ Le Village. Oh my goodness! It was spectacular!!!! The turkey bacon tasted like Thanksgiving turkey, plus you could have them make you an omelet or eggs any way you want them, plus fruit toppings for pancakes/french toast. The sausage was very good, and my fiance couldn't stop raving about the corned beef hash. Next was Caesars Lago for lunch. It was ok. Not much of a selection. Dessert was almost wiped out and it didn't look like any of the staff cared to re-stock it. Then we had Harrah's Flavors for dinner before the 24hrs expired. It was pretty good. There was A LOT of meat, very little veggie selection (mashed potatoes of course, but little else). Everything was tasty. There's cotton candy for dessert and you can take as many as you want with you as you leave! We decided to hit Planet Hollywood for lunch the next day even though our BoB was expired. Mostly due to the fact that if you checked in there on FB you got BOGO @ Spice Market Buffet. That was the best out of the bunch! An excellent selection of EVERYTHING and absolutely delicious. I really like the Middle Eastern selection of food. Plus they had smoothies and very good dessert. A very well-rounded selection of food for everyone. When I go back to Vegas I will definitely do the BoB since it paid for itself by the second buffet, but I know which to go to multiple times and which to skip.",pJKBEnFMHr2HVXWMu353ow,2,1,4,iE0_WL78Wrl1q9kgSxomgA

I tried to going to as many buffets as I could which was five. The problem was that at a certain point I came to the realization that I am eating for the sake of eating. I wasn't hungry, I wasn't enjoying the food, I wasn't even eating my emotions. I was simply eating for the sake of eating. I could have spent my time more constructively like say stamp collecting or procrasterbating. 

Don't get me wrong if you are bulimic, eat your emotions, train for competitive eating, or like mediocre food. Then this is for you.

Self Parking was not available anymore , so we had to pay the valet for $13.00. We headed straight to the Bacchanal to register in the computer kiosk in front . It'll ask your mobile coz they'll text you when it's your turn. That's about 45 mins at least . So, we all went to the Total  Rewards players desk at the casino area and registered free. This way you'll get $10 off for the buffet of buffets, plus free drinks or $10 playing money. We got the text on time and this is what we did after all the helpful Yelp tips ...
1. Weekend rate for buffet of buffet : $74.00
    Less Total Rewards discount         - $10.00
    Add  $35 for Bacchanal dinner.    + $35.00 plus tax
                                            Total.       =$108.24
*Bacchanal dinner is at $70 so best to use BOB coz you only get to pay half here. We had a feast and ate like the Roman soldiers of Caesar.... well worth it.
2. BOB is good for 24 hours so since we were seated at 8:50pm... we had the whole day Saturday until 8:50 pm to explore all the other member restaurants. FYI, they stop receiving customers at 10pm but it doesn't mean there is no food anymore.... there's still a lot!!!! 
3. Saturday unlimited champagne Brunch @ Le Village at Paris Hotel                                                      : $39.00
*the line at 10am was really long and when we were seated, we saw a lot of empty tables. Don't understand why they didn't fill up the spaces hmmmm 
4. Saturday early Dinner @5pm @ Paradise Garden Flamingo Hotel                                             :$25.00
The view near the Flamingo window was bad coz the pond was dirty, yikes. Food was okay, nothing spectacular here. Crab legs were half opened. Only sangria and house wines , soda was free. 
5. Saturday late Dinner @8pm was supposed to be at the Spice Market at Planet Hollywood but without warning, nor announcement , this was closed. We found out that there was water dripping from the roof to the buffet tables so they had to cancel buffet for safety reasons. 
6. So we had a choice of going to the Rio, Harrahs or just the  nearest one .... so back to Paris, Le village  we walked at 110%... summer in Vegas!          $39.00
No alcohol was free for dinner and the food was not fantastic so we ended up with lots of coffee and dessert. They make wonderful crepe here! 
Summary: Buffet of Buffet is worth the experience . Not only will you save money , it'll give you reason to visit other casinos with purpose instead of sitting in just one. Food trip in lieu of hitting the machines... heheheh 
I paid total BOB                       $108.00
Less Bacchanal Dinner.              70.00
Less Le Village Brunch.             -35.00
Less early Dinner Flamingo.      -25.00
Less late dinner/snacks/coffee
At Le village at Paris.                  -39.00
Total savings                     :       $ 61.00

This promotion pays for itself if you can hit at least 3 buffets.

It's a great promotion for Harrah's because they know many people will feel the need to gamble as you walk through the entire casino just to arrive at the buffet in the rear of the casino (except Rio where the Strip shuttle drops off at Carnival World Buffet).

Good:
#1 - Caesar Palace's Lago lunch
#2 - Paris Buffet dinner

Pass:
Rio Carnival World Buffet
Harrah's Flavor Buffet
Flamingo Paradise Buffet

Fail:
Paris Buffet lunch
Planet Hollywood Spice Market Buffet

Still hoping to try:
Caesar Palace's Lago dinner

*I have also individually reviewed each buffet. Strongly recommending trying this once while in Vegas. Only downfall, there should be an express line to allow those already paid to bypass the cash register line and queue immediately to be seated.",owRJSf6XpxG0d9vBl04uAQ,1,1,4,b9NZAtoMZLFHg8QuJhrmtQ
1321302,2013-09-09,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"My husband and I were staying at the Rio therefore we decided to try the 24 hour buffet pass. It's definitely not for everyone and I think the next trip to Vegas we would probably not do it again since we now have a better sense of what is available in Vegas. The cost for the weekend is about $70 per person with the taxes in and with the Total Rewards discount. We attempted to squeeze in 4 meals during this time period. We figured trying to squeeze in 2 dinners and 1 breakfast and 1 lunch would be the better value. In hindsight, I think it would have been better to squeeze in the 2 breakfasts instead since we would have had overnight to recover from the gluttony prior to trying to eat again. Although we narrowly made it to the last meal at 8:45pm (the dinner on the 2nd day), we could barely enjoy it since we were still full from the lunch we had around 3:30pm. With the buffets, I felt as though you could just have 2 meals a day and be full. In addition, by the end of our stay I felt almost nauseous looking at food and I don't think I could go to another buffet again for the remainder of this year. This is coming from someone who can eat and typically has a huge appetite. I think I gained about 3-4 lbs in the 3 nights I was in Vegas if that is saying anything. 

Sadly, we only made it to 2 buffets during our stay (the Rio and the Le Village Buffet at the Paris Hotel). Rio had more selection and had less of a line up (likely due to it being off the strip). The line up at the Rio was only about 5 minutes (during off peak hours) and the Paris buffet was about 20 minutes (during off peak hours). We passed the buffet at Caesars during the same time period and the line up was HUGE. The buffet at the Paris hotel was mostly French food. I was disappointed with the quality of the desserts at both buffets in terms of taste. The selection and presentation was good but the taste was not as good.

Next time, we will try all the cute little restaurants that we saw during our tour of all the various hotels. The prices at the restaurants although not cheap seemed reasonable.",eKRpit3xJL4P8MxtvDer2w,1,0,3,NUpLIC-UYA38vexxZJitog

For dinner we went to Rio. One of the best buffets in Vegas. They shut the line down literally as we walked up. Said there was an hour wait and they close at 10. It was 9:00. The line disappeared in about 15 min. At that point, it was to late to find another and get on by closing time, so we ended up finding somewhere else to eat. We will have breakfast in the morning.

1343235,2012-10-31,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"This is a review for PH Spice Market buffet, Paris Buffet, Bacchanal Buffet at CP and Flamingo buffet 

First stop PH Spice Market for breakfast. I'd pass on this one. The selection isn't that great. If there's no line and you want a quick breakfast then ok stop here. 

We also had a late dinner here since they close at 11pm. The selection isn't so bad. The dessert here was blah. It's all cupcakes. Creative flavors. But if you're not into cupcakes it's pretty lame. I took small bites of interesting flavors. I have to say that they were moist at least considering the large batches they have to make. There's a sad selection of crab legs. They also had cocktail shrimp. The selections were American, Asian, Mediterranean, Italian and Mexican. 

Next, Lunch at Paris buffet. This was really good. The coffee is good and their selection is extensive. Sadly, the made to order crepe station was a disappointment. I was told that they'd only make crepes off their savory or sweet menu and none were appealing to me but I settled on the nutella and banana which sucked. The fruit toppings are not fresh. The bananas were pre-mixed in this overly sweet jelly thing that was wrong. I'd rather pay for a Jean Philippe crepe. Also I've read reviews that their chocolate croissants was awesome. Wrong again. All the croissants were hard and not flaky or buttery. Again I'd rather pay for a Jean Philippe almond or chocolate croissant which is well worth the calories. Everything else was good. Their salad bar is fresh. Fruits were fresh. Cheese selection was yummy. 

We also ended the pass with breakfast at Paris which was good. French toast, pancakes, coffee all yummy. Omelette station guy makes big omelets with lots of toppings. I'd pay for the breakfast alone, good bang for your buck. I think $15.99? 

Since on the website it says you gotta check out Flamingo for their asian food selections the bf chose to check this place out. This place was de-press-ing. We literally sat down for 10 mins and left. The food looked wrong. That's all i have to say about Flamingo.

Last but not least....Bacchanal at CP. This is the reason why I wanted to do the pass. Extra $15 for the newest and best buffet? Ok deal. WELL I apparently read the fine print wrong. I thought you only had to pay $15 to upgrade the pass, giving unlimited access to the buffet. I even asked this when the girl rang us up. Specifically I said ""So once we upgrade we can come back and eat again whenever?"" And her answer was ""Yes"" So I'm thinking great...I'll pay $15 extra and we'll go a couple more times before the 24hrs is up. So when we went it was at 4pm on a Thursday and a perfect time to sample the food because it was not busy at all. The plan was to fully indulge later. So we tried a few things, which were pretty good but we were so stuffed from earlier we didn't eat a lot. I was really looking forward to the dessert because I've read so many good reviews about it so I decided to wait to enjoy it. I just went to check it out and it made me so excited for later. We just got a gelato to go in a chocolate and peanut dipped cone which was pretty good. So come later when we were hungry and ready to have a late dinner, we get in line and tell them we have the pass with upgrade already. The guy scans our player's card and says ""$32"" and I'm thinking no we already paid to upgrade and this is when he tells us ""No, you pay every time you eat here"" Yeah I was pretty pissed and disappointed. At least we didn't wait in the long ass line for dinner when we had walked by earlier. I don't plan on paying again for this buffet because the food wasn't spectacular, extensive selection yes but omg delicious..no. The asian food was ok. The seafood is pretty good and fresh. I guess I'll never get to try their dessert unless we go with family and they pay. haha.",rJX-MVc0xDHtwYrDY7VpTQ,4,0,4,d7wv6tAXTcK4AcsP4Win0A

I've been trekking from LA to Vegas about once a month since Jan for work... and doing Vegas on a shoe-string budget in an attempt to make a profit still broke my bankroll. 

Enter Buffet of Buffets. For 44.99-- w/ Total Rewards card, which is free to sign-up for-- plus tax per person, that's a whole lotta value PROVIDED you eat at least three meals. The boyfriend and I ate four meals at the three highest-rated buffets (for sake of convenience, the buffets located at):

Planet Hollywood
Rio
Paris

PH
We visited each of those buffets in that order, eating twice at PH... not because it was THAT great, but for sake of convenience and timing. Maybe it was reading all of the great reviews about PH that upped my expectations and I'm willing to concede that it might have been an off-day when we went. You will get full, but cold food? I thought that was steam rising from the carving station and the lasagna. I swear they were using dry ice.

I don't think I've ever reached for the salt and pepper at a buffet as much as I have here. Still, they have plenty of options. My suggestion is that you go for their pre-split crab legs and for dessert.

wait time: 15 min and 25 min (4:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. on a Monday)
service: 3 / 5
variety: 3.5 / 5
taste: 2.75 / 5
visit again: probably not

RIO
Yes, it's HUGE-- there's a lot of ground to cover and I highly recommend that you do a walk-thru of this and any buffet to get an idea of what to put on your plate. That said, I don't know if the layout at Rio proves more beneficial to the customer or to hotel. 
Being forced to walk and move to get your second and third (and fourth, etc) plate gives you the opportunity to spare your stomach even a few minutes more before you get yo glutton ON. But I saw a lot of lazy buffet goers and elderly that weren't physically able to traverse the distance of the buffet. :( it made me sad.

As for selection, you can't go wrong. There's something for any picky-palette. The food was warm or hot-- unless meant to be served cold-- and my favorite station was probably the mongolian wok / on-the-spot stir fry. Most of the food was tough or bland. Desserts looked a little dry, but you can't go wrong with a scoop or two of gelato to-go.

wait time: 30 min (1 p.m. on a Tuesday)
service: 2 / 5
variety: 4 / 5
taste: 2 / 5
visit again: no

PARIS
My favorite of the three. If you decide to visit the buffet at Paris, be sure to give yourself an hour of time to wait in line (i.e. if you have show tickets and want to eat dinner beforehand, understand you're going to be waiting and surrounded by cranky people).
Aside from the wait, I found the service here to be the BEST of the three. Ambiance was ""cute."" Though a smaller buffet with an emphasis on French cuisine-- surprise-- I found the food here to be seasoned and cooked the best. I overheard a woman complain that certain items I enjoyed were too salty.
You can't please 'em all, but my boyfriend and I agree that if we ever do Buffet of Buffets again, Paris will be the only buffet of the three visited that we grub at again.

wait time: 50 min (4:15 p.m. on a Tuesday-- we thought our passes were going to expire while we were in line!)
service: 5 / 5
variety: 3 / 5
taste: 4 / 5
visit again: yes (but only with the Buffet of Buffets pass)


Yes, I recommend the pass, but only if you can squeeze three meals in a 24 hour period. If you're a salad connoisseur, stay away-- I mean, you can find cheaper places to eat leaves at. In all seriousness, though, none of the salad stations at any of the three looked tempting.

My vote goes for Paris, and people will disagree on which of the seven buffets is the ""best,"" but I think we all agree that Imperial has the worst... just... stay away...

1365179,2011-11-21,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Diana S. and I decided to tackle this LV monster known as the Buffet of Buffets. A couple month's prior we laid out this epic BoB plan consisting of Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner1, Dinner2, and Breakfast the next day. What went down veered a bit from our itinerary.

We made it out to-

Lunch at the Rio - definitely impressed with the selection. Had a whole section dedicated to BBQ! YUMMM. Best thing about this buffet were the hot Asian noodle soups! Pho at a buffet while nursing your hangover from the previous night is one of the best things ever. No wait at noon on a Friday. 4.5/5 stars

Dinner at PH - Their Mediterranean section is really good! The layout is odd because the desserts are the first thing you see and smack in the middle of the buffet and you have to walk pretty far to get to the seafood. The crab legs are abundant but pretty salty. Nothing else really stood out to me. ~10-15 minutes wait at 6:30pm on a Friday. 3/5 stars

Brunch at Flamingo - We initially wanted to do the unlimited Champagne brunch here (additional $4) but we were both waaaay too hungover to do so. Two of our friends opted for that though and the waitress definitely kept their booze coming. Loved the chocolate covered strawberries here as well as the fried chicken! Omelet station was mediocre as the chef uses WAAAAAAY too much oil. When I asked for a sunny side egg for my friend, the chef cracked it, cooked it, realized the yolk broke and threw it out! I'm not sure if I should be happy that he was an egg perfectionist or upset that he wasted food like that! 20 minutes wait at 11am on a Saturday. 3/5 stars.

Disappointed that we weren't able to try the supposedly epic brunch at Le Village in Paris but perhaps next time! Each buffet itself isn't even that expensive (~$20 for lunch and $25-30 for dinner), so unless you do at least 3 you won't get your money's worth.",ZFZB-acrqGQol0PXCgd3pg,1,0,3,6H6-wlaJSmEpva8yTh9agw

My wife and I got the pass and went to breakfast at both the rio and paris and dinner at bacchanal in Caesars.  first of all they make you wear a wristband unless you get the casino rewards card which was very annoying.  Every line was 45min long and once inside they were basically like a old country buffet.  The meats were usually good but all seafood was cold except at bacchanal where you could asked for it warmed but they is was just barely.  The crab was a mix of snow and golden king crab.  The crab was small of both species and was very watery.  The oysters at bacchanal were touted as blue points but when asked I was told they were blue points from the james river MD.  This is not possible.  I have no problem with james river oysters but don't tell me they are blue points.  The sides were ok and the variety excellent.  if you want great variety, tons of food,  and don't mind a little wait then it is good but don't expect anything to blow you away.

All you can eat, with complimentary nonalcoholic beverages. We bought our passes at about 7:30 PM on Friday night of the weekend we were there. The passes are good for 24 hours, but most of the buffets are only open from about 7:00 AM - 10:00 PM. We were still able to get 4 meals out of this as follows:

Friday night, 8:00 PM - Harrah's
Saturday morning, 8:00 AM - Flamingo
Saturday afternoon, 1:00 PM - Imperial Palace
Saturday night, 6:30 PM - Planet Hollywood

I thought Harrah's and Flamingo were good, Imperial Palace was not good, and Planet Hollywood was fantastic. We stayed at the Mirage, so we were right across the street from Harrah's, Flamingo and IP, but the walk to Planet Hollywood was definitely worth it.

We had 3 meals within the 24hrs time frame: lunch (le village at Paris), dinner (spice market at Planet Hollywood)  and breakfast (flavors at Harrah's).  So one meal cost about $16.  If you can squeeze 4 meals out of the deal, it could be just $12 a meal.     

The only place I really liked was le village at Paris.  Their meal and service were enjoyable.  The spice market at Planet Hollywood was mediocre.  The only things I really ate were crab legs and the desserts.  The rest of the buffet tasted blah.  Now the flavors at Harrah's was terrible.  I did not like the place at all.

1494172,2012-07-27,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"We did the ""buffet of buffets"" deal earlier this week, and while I can see that it might work for adults, it ended up being a bust for our family of two adults and two kids.  Kids pay the same price than adults, though of course, they don't eat nearly as much.  We only managed to do 3 buffets total (two dinners an one breakfast) and I think it would have been just as cheap to pay for each one independently using the coupons you can find out there.  It would have been even cheaper to eat at a regular restaurant.  Live and learn

As to the buffets:

Rio for dinner:  the line was too long, it took us about 45 minutes to get in   The buffet itself was HUGE, it would be impossible to sample even half of everything I wanted to.  The food was generally OK, there was nothing exceptional.  I wouldn't bother coming back.

Harrah's for breakfast.  We don't usually do breakfast but I enjoyed doing this one.  There were plently of both hot and cold options and mostly everything was good.  This one I would do again.

Paris for dinner.  This was probably my favorite, but I like French food.  Most dishes were only OK, but there were a few (the grilled meats from Savoie, the smoked gouda from the cheese station, the scalloped potatoes and, of course, desserts - that made this place worth going to.  I'd go back.

For comparison purposes, last year we visited the buffet at Planet Hollywood, which was also huge but provided more international offerings.  I'd rank that one as above the Rio's but below the Paris'.",tUShFCNl4Mb2-kJ5J__w0Q,3,0,3,QtjuOn9OxKZrWH8g7PwKYg
1507869,2011-06-14,4,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Executive summary, ranked best to worst:

1. Paris - Le Village Buffet  (Frenchy, but superb and succulent)
2. Rio - Carnival World Buffet (great overall, but off-strip)
3. Planet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet (varied experience, but usually good)
4. Harrah's - Flavors Buffet (suprisingly good, but suffers from its surroundings)
5. Caesars - Lago Buffet (frustrating . . . a few easy changes could make this so much better)
6. Flamingo - Paradise Garden Buffet (meh . . . but look! there's a chocolate fountain!)
7. Imperial Palace - Emperor's Buffet (it's just kind of sad)

Overall summary:
Its a pretty decent value for $45, there are at least 3 decent buffets in there. 

Notes on our strategy for eating 2-3 plates at 7 different buffets in a 24 hour period:
* We planned for starting the 24-hour clock in the late morning, so we could go to the last buffet the next day in the early AM
* We researched the buffets beforehand, and sandwiched the ones we knew wouldn't be very good between the good ones
* Lots of walking up and down the strip in between buffets was beneficial

24 hours, 7 buffets, about 3 plates per buffet ends up being about 16,000 calories total, or 666 calories per hour, or about 356 calories per dollar. I call that cost effective.
I should say somewhere that I don't normally engage in this kind of wanton gluttony, but I do enjoy a challenge.

None of the 7 buffets were anywhere near as good as the Wynn, Bellagio or Wicked spoon, IMHO.  But there are at least 3 good buffets in there so its a pretty good deal for $45.

2. Le Village Buffet at Paris

I would suggest to get it at around 7 or 8 at night so you get two dinners, breakfast and a lunch all for $45 excluding the additional $15 if you are willing to pay more for higher quality of food. Just know that the lines are crazy on the weekends so be prepared to wait or pay extra $10 to basically cut in line to go to the front.

1626477,2013-10-08,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Not long after you arrive in Vegas.... you'll start seeing the signs. 

The Buffet of Buffets. Fairly epic looking on the poster. Piqued my curiosity. 

Then a bit later you'll see another sign or maybe something in a magazine.

Decided to go for it, seemed like a lot of options and from the photos some of them looked good.

There during the week, so it cost $49 with the players card which you can get free of charge, you do need to provide ID. I figured it gets you a few other things and you need to keep a wristband on for the 24 hours if you don't have the card. Two of the buffet options have an extra charge,  seafood at Rio and the Bachanal at Caesar's Palace. From other reviews the one at Caeasar's Palace sounds pretty good, but didn't make it there.


Was staying at Rio, so went to the world buffet there first. It was decent. Very friendly waiters with the drinks. A lot of variety. Included prime rib, sushi, and some other things. The sushi seemed a little better there than at the other places. They had gelato in the dessert selection which I liked. Was also pretty hungry for the first buffet, so ate quite a bit. 

Thought about doing the seafood buffet at Rio, but ended up not doing that. The buffet at Paris seemed like it could be good.

So headed there before going to a show and..... there was a huge line! Didn't really have enough time to wait in the line and make it to the show (7:00) on time, but it was open until 10:00 so we came back at about 8:45 and got in the line. Not so bad, but it was still maybe a 20 minute wait at that time.

The wait seemed to indicate it would be good though, so seemed worthwhile. Once we got in, there were a number of things different than the Rio buffet. Crabs legs, freshly made crepes, antipasto, a little Mediterranean, among other things. Definitely a more European lean in a number of things. Creme Brullet was very good. Salad bar was a bit different than other places. They also had prime rib. Overall, one of my favorites.

Most of the buffets (except Rio) are pretty close together - Paris, Quad, Bally's, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo Harrah's, and Caesar's Palace.

The next day we figured we could go by a few of them and check them out.

Had one plate at Harrah's. It was okay, not especially exciting.

The location within the building of the buffets was a little different at certain places. A few were out of the way.

At Paris it's on ground floor, very popular.

A couple others were tucked away and that seemed to make them less visited and not quite as good.

Walked by the Quad and it didn't seem too exciting, not a lot of people there.

Figured going back to Paris was an option.

But then went to the Flamingo. Immediately it had a nice ambiance. There were flamingos and water outside on the ground floor and even a black swan.

The food was quite good. They had a freshly made quesadilla bar going (afternoon). Seems they use that for crepes at night. Had prime rib there which was also good. As well as some seafood. Tried a crawfish, which I wasn't wild about, but not sure if I usually am. Had sushi which was all right. Fresh fruit there included watermelon slices.

Lots of pastries available, had a bite of one, but didn't really like it. Chocolate fondue was pretty good.

Drank hot tea. Servers were friendly.

Didn't end up seeing Bally's, but looked into the spice market buffet at Planet Hollywood and it seemed pretty good. Would maybe check that out another time.

Overall, a good deal if you're down to eat a variety of food and like to eat. Think about your choices though since you're probably not going to make it to all of them. Also realize that a number of them are close together, so you can check them out and continue to a different one if you're not interested.",HZXa7aU_Q_r8ST_UmHNW9Q,23,3,4,byXbOm08ivVzbB-iRfF42w

We made it to three different locations, but I maintain this is a worthwhile investment.  I do have to admit there's a special place in my heart for the decor at Le Village Buffet, though it seemed like the waitress was having a rough time keeping up with the madness. Also there's birds at Le Village Buffet, which is confusing at first, but then charming. The foods offer comfort in their heavy creams sauces, and cheeses. 
But the winner of all was definitely Spice Market's delectable lamb kabobs. I kept going back until I thought I would explode, and then lo... and behold! Cotton candy. Yes. Transport back to sticky fingered childhood, cotton candy, there in the midst of sin city.

I figured I wasn't going to Burn $200 bucks for a New Years eve room, but I sure as hell would drive up to Vegas for 98.75 for 2 nights and 2 free buffets.  Killer deal.

Since this ain't my first B.O.B rodeo I knew what to hit up and what to avoid.  
Carlos Sr. wanted to start at the Rio Buffet.  So Weds night we went over there.  My god 1.5 hour wait..  I almost passed out because of pure starvation by the time we got in.  Not bad overall, but I feel the Crab Legs really are small now and the overall quality was no where near worth the wait.

Next morning went to FLAVORS for Breakfast.   Solid but not amazing.  Nothing chart topping worth mentioning here.  Left and went to Flamingo right away.  Some of the freshest cleanest tasting Crayfish I have ever ate.  Made up for FLAVORS Quality drop.

Lunch went straight to the best of the BOB.  Spice Market.  Love the Burger Bar, great array of food.  

Dinner went back to Spice Market.  Yes folks Spice is the best, next trip I won't even go anywhere else, I will just spend 24 straight hours here. LOL.  Noticed all you can drink for 11.99 more.  WOW.  So lemme get this straight I can eat all I want and drink 45 Heinekens for only 12 bucks more.  Next time I am all in on the all you can drink.

Split crab legs is worth 45 bucks right there, the work of breaking these legs is done for you.   And everything else at this buffet was good.  Desserts were awesome.  Thumbs up.

First stop: Le Village Buffet at Paris. Food was pretty good with lots to select from the Breakfast buffet. Half the staff looked/acted like they hated their job though.

After the first place, my friend and I decided the best way to utilize our Buffet of Buffet pass was to eat only a plate at each place. That way we'd be able to try all seven buffets and really see which ones were good. Unfortunately, lack of time and meeting friends prevented us from doing that.

Second stop: Paradise Garden at Flamingo. NASTY. The food tasted like they were prepackaged and heated up. I stop by the seafood bar to grab some crawfish and when I picked up the tongs, flies flew up. GAG. My friend and I seriously only took a few bites and left (we only really came here cuz it was located near the other buffets, lesson learned).

Have lot of deserts even in the morning, this is the place hobbie find his pecan tart. The puff pastry are really good.  This is much more modern than the last time I visited.

So you can say that our strategy of when, where, what and how to eat  was one year in the making. I was really itching to try it. My original plan was to have 7 meals at 6 different venues. But at the end I could only manage 6 buffets at 5 casinos. My wife is a light eater so she didn't want to do it. It was my son and me and here is how it went down:

First day, April 24
5:30PM   Purchased buffet pass at Le Village Buffet at Paris (we were staying at Paris for two nights before moving to Bellagio for two more nights). All the meat dishes are so so. The lamb was especially chewy. It could be me, but the supposed French foods here tasted no more different than any other American buffet. Overall rating 3  *** out of 5.

9:30PM   Walked over to Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo for night snack. My son and I both had the authentic made to order Vietnamese pho with fish and beef balls. Also had some fresh fruits, cakes and cookies. They were very good and I would have to agree with some of the previous reviews that this buffet is the sleeper of the group.****

Second day, April 25
7:00AM    I am an early riser. I woke up at 5 and played a couple of hours of slots before headed to the Le Village Buffet for breakfast. I had a lot of my favorite, smoked salmon, plus the usual breakfast fares, orange juice, toast and coffee.***

9:30AM   My son woke up at 9 and we walked over to the Lago Buffet at Caesar Palace . This was the only one with a line but we were seated immediately because we already had the pass. Again I ate a lot of smoked salmon. My son loved the pancakes. The sausage and bacon were very good also very good. ****1/2

12:00PM   My wife joined us for lunch buffet at Carnival World Buffet at Rio. We took the shuttle bus from Ballys and it only took 10 min. There was an abundance of food to choose from. It truly lived up to the name ""World Buffet"".****1/2

2:30PM   Was gonna go to Flavors, The Buffet at Harrahs for afternoon tea. But we had to scrap the plan because we were just too full from the earlier lunch.

5:15PM   Walked over next door from Paris to Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. The crab legs and prime rib were excellent. And we got to try for the first time Middle Eastern food a a buffet. In my opinion, Spice Market Buffet was the best of the five.*****

    Overall it was a wonderful experience. I love to eat and I like variety. So this was perfect for me. I didn't  feel bloated at the end of the 2nd day and I am still not tired of buffet yet. We definitely got our money's worth. I enjoyed it thoroughly and we will do it again next year as long as the price is not more than $50. And I wish they would extend the
hours from 24 to a 26 hours all you can eat buffet.  A couple of hours more would definitely made the whole event even more enjoyable.",b_0JL-YnIzyTtuvI2LTdHw,1,0,5,pmU3boD1LZp30nE9VPD30Q

I never ate so much in my food. At the end of the 24 hour period, I told my family, "" I hate food"".

Lago Buffet, Ceasar's Palace: 

Service:
Waiter service is good. I liked my last waiter. I've never seen a waiter move so fast nor have I seen a waiter run. He moved so fast, my food digested faster. He wouldn't really look at me, but miraculously, he would ask me if I needed anything right when I needed something. Amazing! If anyone goes there and finds him, leave him an extra dollar for me!

Food:
I made a smoked salmon sandwich, which reminds me of the best brunch of my life in Canada. Not as good as Canada, but I tried.

For breakfast, I had smoked salmon omelette. 

The deserts are supposed to be the best of the buffets. I can't attest to that, except that they were pretty good. I'll pass on the rum cake, and the red velvet/carrot cake had very good icing, but too much icing not enough cake. Biscotti was fresh. (They serve the same pastries-or very similar- as in the java cafe by the forum shops but mini version)

Planet Hollywood Buffet:
Mediterranean food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never been to a buffet with Middle Eastern food! My favorite was the skewered squash and zucchini! Naan was not good though-basically raw, unless there's other naan besides Indian naan that I'm not aware of. 

No room for the King Crab legs. Was stuffed from Ceasar's, but my cousin was loving it.

We tried the following buffets:

Paris 
Planet Hollywood 
Rio SEAFOOD

I didn't try the other ones due to some yelping help. I figured I'll just try what I believe to be the top 3. 

Paris - long line, but I guess it's expected. All the food was good, very expected. They had a crepe station! But everyone at our table was gone for 10 minutes (waiting for crepes), and the busboy completely cleaned our table. We came back to an empty table...that was a sad moment, but our waitress was very apologetic and replaced all the utensils and drinks for us. Their desserts were okay, nothing memorable. Overall, it was a good buffet place, nothing to rave about, nothing to complain about.

Planet Hollywood - we came here TWICE. Once, right after the Paris one, and we all pretty much SAT there and didn't eat much. But the second time we came back, we were ready to eat. Their cocktail shrimps were so fresh and good!!! That was my favorite for sure. Everything else was good too. They had such a huge variety of everything. 

Rio SEAFOOD buffet - Once upon a time, this used to be my favorite. I had to come here because I was dreaming about their raw oysters. On top of the Buffet deal, I had to pay $15 to eat here (since it's not included with the $40 deal). But I figured, sure, it should be worth it. But nope, the oysters were NOT FRESH AT ALL, and neither were most of their seafoods. I was very very very disappointed. Maybe you'll be lucky enough when you go to half some fresh seafood!",XpuNEgQPFBe0se9Agpprgg,3,1,5,7xhpz0tcQCkMvTiTks50dw

Best deal on the strip.

Buffets that I have tried have been good.

The bad- I feel tied down with this deal like I HAVE TO EAT AT THIS BUFFET OR THAT. When we first visit vegas I used to talk about the food there for days but with buffet of buffet I just don't. The food is good but its just buffet food. Have tried it twice but probably wont do it again",sgbSPpsQNitp4cHXA1VbJA,6,1,5,DjDeNex0Jbfev9ZFphdulQ
1887557,2013-02-25,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"So I was looking forward to getting some buffet action since I haven't been to vegas in a couple of years... I saw the buffet offer of $49 but didn't realize that that was for weekdays.  Weekends (same food) is $70 or $65 if you have the Total Rewards card which I thought was pretty pricey.  That was until I found out what they were charging these days if you pay as you go...

On Saturday night I decided to go to Paris buffet since reading the reviews I didn't get a sense that the other buffets (other than Bacchanal) were so good.  At 9pm there was a 40 minute wait.  The buffet was good but not spectacular.  My gold standard was the Bellagio buffet which for many years is what I considered the best quality buffet and variety anywhere.  The Paris buffet (Le Village) to me doesn't come close.  It didn't matter very much since my goal was to prep up for Caesar's buffet.  Normal price at on the weekends for Paris is $37.  Personally, I don't think it is worth it.  There are lots of non buffets that I would spend less and eat much higher quality food.

Sunday morning, I went to Carnival World at Rio.  There was no wait here at 9:30am  This was just ok also - so I ended up eating 1 full plate and left there.  The normal charge for this ""brunch"" is $32.  That's crazy.  I would not pay that for this food.  $20, maybe.  There wasn't much breakfast food here and more lunch/dinner choices.

An hour later, I went back to Paris and waited about an hour at noon.  I forgot to check but I believe the brunch price is on par with Carnival.  Surprisingly, other than an omelet station and a few other breakfast items, the choices were the same I had last night at the dinner buffet - give or take a few things.  A few of the things (I especially remember the creme brûlée) I am sure it was left over from the night before as the burnt sugar that is supposed to be crispy on this was as soft as the custard.  Not fresh and not good.  I ate just 1 plate here.  The waitress was puzzled why I would supposedly spend $30 for 1 plate but perhaps she forgot about the 24hr unlimited buffet pass.  

This evening, I went to the Bacchanal.  I heard a lot of good things about this place and honestly - the reason why I came to Vegas.  Instead of the $15 surcharge to eat here that was mentioned in a few posts, I was surprised to find out it was increased to a $25 surcharge a few weeks ago.  I wasn't too happy as that made the deal slightly less attractive as I normally wouldn't go eat a buffet for breakfast.  Still, it is what it is.  Dinner without the 24hr. offer is a staggering $57.  Vegas is sure getting pricey these days.  After a 5 minute wait at 6pm, I walk in and instantly notice how modern and hip the place is.  It has definitely lived up to the hype.  Going over the food, I am giddy - everything looks to be high end, food that is expertly crafted and made as though as I was in a high end NYC restaurant.  The food was just exceptional.  I can't find good enough words for the quality and the variety.  To me, this blows Bellagio away and is certainly my new standard for the best buffet out there.  The cold shrimp was a type I have never had before.  The texture is very special and it was extremely flavorful.  I can't explain how good and large these were.  The meats were tender and flavorful.  I would not do this normally at a buffet but they had these tiny hamburger sliders and I had to have one.  It was superb - almost as good as Kobe burgers I had in Daniel's (Michigan 3 star restaurant).  For those that are familiar with Japanese Mochi ice cream treats, you don't find these in restaurants because of the expense.  Well, welcome to unlimited Mochi and Italian gelato.  I am floored.  I had a crepe and the fruits were very fresh as well as the heavenly handmade whipped cream.  The desserts were crazy good and I'm glad I started out with desserts FIRST so I could really enjoy them without being overly full.  No kidding - I probably ate between 4000-5000 calories + in 90 minutes.  It was insane and I'm sure my body will punish me in the coming days.   When I left there at 7:30, there was about a 60-90 minute wait so I'm glad I got there early on a supposedly slow Sunday.  There was no 2hr max sitting as mentioned by someone else but you know what, 2hrs should be plenty.  You don't want to eat till you explode

So, would I do this 24hr buffet deal again?  Probably not.  I don't think I need to gain 10lbs in 24hrs.  It's not really enjoyable to engorge in mega calories as much as you can do in 1 day.  I Definitely would not pay the weekend rate again.  Weekdays for $49, perhaps.

However, I not only would gladly pay the rate for Bacchanal, but I would spend more and recommend only that buffet (and Bellagio) in vegas.",lMTeX2GJ2aPBm8esnYW1fg,3,0,4,Y8LLtHwU3oUV3rxXnp7g8w

Choosing the right buffets may be the key for the success. Le Village buffet at Paris was not very pleasant experience. But I liked the Flavor at Harrah's and I loved the World Carnival buffet at Rio. In fact, I visited there twice. By the time I visited the Rio for the second time, I am so full that I could eat anymore. I decided not to spend extra money for the seafood buffet, which I liked to revisit after 15+ years.

One thing to keep in mind is that the buffet deal is for the member of the Total Rewards. Make sure you enroll the membership before you get in the line. I did that in Caesar's Palace and after I have to back out after more than 30 minutes of waiting because the total cost to eat at the Bacchanal Buffet is $85 for a non-member compare to $65 for a member.",UIfYGwo02HxFOBxbEUC8Iw,8,1,4,3GPihFXYxhEwVC06zyoxyA

By the  time the 3rd buffet came around, I wasn't really enjoying my food. Also, I spent a total of 2+ hrs in line (midweek), which is a pretty big commitment for a 24hr period. I'm sure weekends would be worse. But I guess that's better than losing money at the casinos...

Some tips:
-as others have mentioned, join the free total rewards, to save a few bucks
-try to go a little earlier than the peak times, for shorter wait times
-don't waste time at the bad buffets. Research in advance. I actually exclusively went to Paris and Planet hollywood
-don't forget about the law of diminishing returns. Eat at your preferred buffet first, while you still enjoy the food, and work your way down
-it is possible to get 4 meals out of this (if you're really trying to get your money's worth). Late dinner, bfast, lunch and early dinner. I couldnt wake up for the bfast though

Rio (dinner) - This one had the best ""Asian"" food, in my opinion.  I really like the satay and peanut sauce.  Best part of this buffet is the dessert.  The bananas foster, chocolate mousse, and coconut gelato were absolutely delicious.

Paris (lunch) - Hands down the best buffet out of the 3 we visited.  Mac N Cheese with peas, mustard cream chicken, french onion soup, prime rib, creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes, cooked apples, cooked pears, macarons, and berry crepe were awesome!

Le Village Buffet at Paris for dinner- I was disappointed in the food, I've wanted to go there for quite some time, after trying it, I most likely wouldn't go back.  The food was very mediocre.  The only thing I liked was the creme brulee.  

Lago Buffet at Caesar's Palace for breakfast-  The buffet is small so not much to choose from.  The scrambled eggs looked kind of funny and runny so I didn't eat that.  Ate the ham, that was good.  I wouldn't pay the regular price of $17.99 to eat here.

Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood for lunch/brunch-  The food was pretty good, the menu had a good selection of seafood, American, Middle Eastern, Mexican and Asian food.  I got champagne with lunch so that was good.  

Carnival World Buffet at Rio's-  Large selection of food and the food is pretty good.  The main highlights for me were the crab legs, prime ribs and Vietnamese Pho.  At the Asian counter, you can get noodles and soup such as Vietnamese Pho, wonton soup and tom yum soup.  It was neat.  Definitely try the gelato, it was yummy.  

Quick tip:  The crab legs are not as good as those a Bellagio but they were still Ok except at Paris.  If you eat crab legs ask the server for a crab cracker or ""sea shredder"", it makes it a lot easier to eat the crab.",ybKNkVboIstp13UPBSyc5g,1,0,4,wCWaVLTW2PE0EBwm3nzmgw

Our afternoon stop was at Le Village Buffet at the Paris.  VERY GOOD!  They had delicious prime rib.  A large selection of breads.  Interesting desserts and a made to order crepe station (with NUTELLA!!!) delicious!  There were lots of Greek food options as well.

That night we decided to try the Lago buffet at Caesers, but they were closed on Wednesday night so we high tailed it over to Harrah's Flavors Buffet, we got there right before 10.  It was ok.  They did have a good Mexican station with surprisingly delicious chicken.  They also had blue cotton candy here and our server told us to grab some to take (they had it wrapped up).  

We went to the Spice Market Buffet (PH) for breakfast.  It was so good, but I don't think you can go wrong.  I saw people in their pjs here and a few girls that were still wasted and dressed in skimpy dresses from the night before.

1. Rio's. This buffet IS still included in the pass. You just have to pay an extra $20 upgrade for seafood station. We went right when it opened for Friday night dinner at 4 pm. Large selection of fresh tasty food including snow crab legs, chocolate fondue, made to order Asian noodle station (pho, wonton, etc 8 different options), nice salad bar, prime rib and roast beef. Drinks are serve your own.

2. Paris. Selection pretty much almost as large as Rio, but focused on French food. We had lunch at 11 am. There was hashed potatoes (just like Denny's, love!), raisin French toast, paella, made to order crepes both sweet and savoury and made to order omelette station. There was a big selection of pastries, I didn't have any but it looked good. Servers serve your drinks - OJ tasted fresh and pulp - but they give you a jug of coffee at your table to serve yourself.

3. Planet Hollywood. Had second dinner around 7 pm Fri night. No line up at all. Pretty decent selection all things considered. This was our 5th buffet in 24 hours so didn't eat much. They have cotton candy which was fun. Drinks machines again to get your own pop.

4. Harrah's. Went at 8:30 pm (1/2 hour before closing) on Thursday night. Chose this as our first buffet based on the positive reviews on Yelp that it is the best of the bunch. Maybe it was because it was close to closing, but definitely not impressed at all. Food was wilted, greasy, and looked like they'd been sitting under the heat lamp for hours. Had some snow crab legs, mussels and left. Selection was small compared to 3 above.

5. Flamingo. Eating here would be a punishment. The decor and colourless globs of food looks like something out of an institution from 1950. We went in, looked around and didn't even sit down.

With all the lineups and considering that Rio is not on the strip (shuttle no longer offered as of Nov 2017), you do need to be prepared to devote a good proportion of your day towards getting good value out of your pass.

However, if you think about it, you will get your money's worth - even if you do not normally eat several buffets.  The cost per person is ~$50 ($5 off if you're a Total Rewards member) for 24 hours - if you ate 3 regular meals, you'd easily spend that much money on food (unless every meal was at McDonald's or Del Taco).  If at least one of those meals was at a buffet, the cost is anywhere from $25-$40 on average so it's definitely a good deal.  Some people say that they can't eat THAT much food and to them I say - don't eat that much food.  Only eat what you want at each meal and don't feel the need to stuff yourself.  The bf and I wanted to try as many buffets as possible in the 24 hours (which our stomachs later regretted).  We got to five buffets out of seven (the Flamingo buffet was closed & we did not go to Imperial Palace due to very poor reviews). 

1) Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood - 4:15pm) = we arrived & went straight to the buffet. =)  It was a smart move because there was no line at this time and we were able to fit in another buffet later in the evening.  Years ago, this was my favorite buffet but in recent times, it has faded.  The food here is decent and there's many international choices (Asian, Mexican, Italian, Mediterranean, American) but nothing really stood out as fantastic.  The best part of the buffet is the desserts - the best selection of all buffets which included flan & creme brulee (my favorites) and cotton candy to take with you. =)

2) Lago Buffet (Caesar's Palace - 8:30pm) = easily our least favorite buffet we went to.  You would think that Caesar's would have a wonderful, lavish buffet but it had the smallest selection.  We had to wait about 20 minutes and while waiting, I was really excited because the decor was very nice.  However, once inside, the food selection was sad - about one third that of a normal buffet.  Even the salad toppings and availability of fruit was poor - nothing here was good in our opinion.  The only positives I can see are a decent dessert section - lots of items available (although the same 6-8 items repeated frequently) and there's gelato.  

3) Le Village Buffet (Paris - 8am) = great choice for breakfast.  In my opinion it's hard to ruin breakfast but it's also hard to make breakfast interesting too.  I felt there were many different options for breakfast food items here that you may not see at other buffets.  Eggs included scrambles, omelettes, eggs benedict, fritattas...there were waffles, crepes, pancakes and french toast as well.  A variety of sausages, bacon, pastries and fruit made this buffet great.  Good bacon is important to me and here it was good. =)

4) Flavors Buffet (Harrah's - 11:30am) = better than expected!  Here you can expect familiar comfort foods that are done well.  Of all the buffets we went to, this was the only one that had fried chicken!  It's such a dumb thing to be excited over but I love fried chicken & it tasted great!  I also enjoyed baked potatoes, spicy tuna sushi, chow mein, flan and cotton candy here as well.  =)  Also a plus - gelato! =)

5) Carnival Buffet (Rio - 4pm) = our favorite of the five!  Although I do not think this buffet is the best in Las Vegas, this is definitely the best in our Buffet of Buffets list.  The variety here is fantastic - so many choices!  They also had the most cold crab legs available - definitely no waiting around for new crab legs to be brought out.  =)  I love that they have Mongolian BBQ and an Asian noodle soup bar which included pho, rice noodle soup, egg noodle soup, udon, wonton soup, hot/sour soup and egg flower soup.  Yum!  I really appreciate this because often the Asian food section consists of bad fried rice/chow mein, orange chicken and other Americanized versions of Asian food.  I think the dessert section is weak here but I'm not a dessert person anyway so this was fine with me.  =)

Overall, I think Buffet of Buffets is your best bet if you're trying to save some money on food - the best thing to do is to go early to each buffet to avoid standing in line.  I would do this again if we had no specific fancy plans for eating. =)",GVYg18F-Rkuk63hvtHoG5Q,14,9,4,LAbKmtbuO7kbCML4P9wSgw

Every time the hubby and I visit Vegas, we always eat at the Rio Seafood Village buffet so I'm so glad that buffet is now part of this package (you have to add $15.00 more which is still worth it).  We both have the total rewards membership so it's about $60.00/person (remember, we had to pay an extra $15 for the seafood buffet), but we were able to get 4 buffets out of it.  We start off with dinner at the Village Seafood Buffet, breakfast at Caesar's, lunch at Paris and then dinner at Planet Hollywood.  We were so full the whole day but I think next time, we'll just get 3 meals out of this (skip breakfast) so that we can enjoy the food a little more.  The buffet at Caesar's is a bit small so I'm not sure if I would go there for either lunch or dinner, but for breakfast, it was enough options.  But I really did enjoy the buffet at Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood.  For your last meal, plan on going a little earlier because  you have exactly 24 hours from the time you've purchased the plan and sometimes, there's a line at the buffets.",2h4RHb2W9867AUnQuSEPKA,0,1,5,DXgNfMsqrH37cBYpVK1vEA

The lady put the wrist band on for me so I couldn't keep it loose to take off when I sleep/take pictures (it's pretty bulky). You can't cut lines with the average ticket, but it's a real wallet saver! My cousin and I tried going to all of them, but after stumbling across Flavors at Harrah's, we decided to skip it and go back to Paris for our last meal. Here was our plan of attack:
8 Dinner: Le Village (waited an hour on a Wednesday) 
10 Dessert: Spice Market (couldn't resist the savory stuff though!)
8 AM Breakfast: Paradise Garden (took us an hour to figure out the buses to get there)
1 PM Lunch: Carnival Buffet (at this point food was starting to sound unappetizing... And I'm a buffet beast) 
5 PM Dinner at our favorite buffet (which will be Le Village. We want to go at 5 to not have to wait in line as long, but I'm not sure I'll be able to eat again in 2 hours!)

My biggest recommendation: by your pass for a late dinner and choose a buffet as a ""snack"" (tea time, dessert, elevenses, whatever you wish!) so you don't overload at all of them and still feel you got to go to them all. Also, these places can't fail a breakfast, so for buffets that have poor reviews (thinking flavors and paradise), go their in the morning to get made-to-order omelets, Crepes/pastries, waffles, etc. Good luck eating, I hope you enjoy it!",nOCKziDWfM-yG8G4QQ61Pg,27,7,4,XHTjuCMV29VWIr6YEdUuWg

We planned on hitting up Paris's Le Village Buffet for breakfast, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet for lunch and Rio's Carnival World Buffet for dinner but plans don't always pan out perfectly.

We checked out Le Village Buffet right at the cusp of breakfast into lunch so we got the best of both worlds.  I highly recommend doing breakfast at Paris because they have a great selection, the bacon is crispy, and their crepes are pretty damn good (gotta get it was nutella... reminded me of one I got from a street vendor in Paris... the city that is!).  The lunch wasn't too bad either.  The prime rib was juicy but the other meats like fried chicken and pork were a little dry.  You MUST get one of the flans though because they're extra creamy and totally delicious.

Buffets are quite filling so we actually didn't feel the need to stuff our faces for lunch.  Unfortunately, due to some scheduling mishap we couldn't hit up the Rio for lunch so we ended up back at Paris.  Their dinner selection was nearly identical to their lunch so we weren't all that impressed.  This time their prime rib was a little drier.  

The next morning we got up early enough to get our money's worth and hit up Planet Hollywood.  Standard breakfast stuff but nothing to write home about.  Nothing really stood out to me.  It was just okay.

I gave the Buffet of Buffets 4 stars for 2 reasons... 1) Paris' breakfast was really quite good and 2) It's a pretty damn good deal.  It's Vegas so the likelihood you'll be hitting up buffets is quite high.  Fork out a few extra bucks and you'll have 3 (or more meals) covered for a 24 hour period.  

One final thing though.. by the end of the 24 hour period, you'll be so sick of buffets it won't even be funny!",QVXwt5amzAPjXBiCNT0YjA,0,0,4,_MRBekDLiQ99p7ed6zuTIA

This is such an amazing deal. It pays for itself in 1 and 1/2 visits!

Once you got the pass, you have 24 hours to eat the Hotels in the chain, which include: Rio, Harrah's, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Imperial Palace, Flamingo, and Caesars Palace, and maybe others I can't recall. If you sign up for the free Total Rewards players card you can get the pass. This is also great bc you put your card in every time you play the slots and get points. Also, every time you book with these hotels you accumulate points..

Total for each buffet is about $30 including tips and all the other fees. The BoB pass is $45 - I think it's a pretty sweet deal! 

The best time to get the pass is about noon. Since you have 24 hrs to go where you please, you'll be able to eat lunch, dinner, breakfast the next day and lunch!
Also, you can change buffets... for example, if you go to Flamingo for lunch and don't like it, you have time to go to any other buffets during the lunch hours to find what you like. We did that for dinner once, we liked different things at different buffets so we went buffet hopping!

I recommend the Rio World Buffet... it's amazing! Anything you can think of ... is there!
Also, the crab legs at Imperial Palace is pretty good since it's a slower buffet, the wait for fresh crab legs is shorter.
Harrah's is also very decent for brunch!
Flamingo has a chocolate fountain!!

The pass was $49.95 (With the total rewards card) starting at 11AM on Sunday. After Friday 11AM, the pass goes up in price (About an additional $20) so you want to be wary of the pricing.

If you start on 11AM on Sunday, the great thing is that you can still make it to Le Village Buffet at Paris. The drawback is that you would have to wake up extra early to try and squeeze in one more meal on Monday morning.

Bacchanal has the most insane surcharge. On Sundays, it's considered brunch at a certain time so +$20 for brunch and +$25 for dinner. So the listed prices aren't always correct, be prepared!

Also, it's +$10 for the Rio Seafood buffet. So don't think you're getting all 6 buffets for that flat price (which would be the ultimate steal!!!)

If I wasn't trying to make it for brunch at Paris, I would probably start a late dinner so that I can do Day 1-Dinner and Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner on Day 2.

It's valid for 24 hours from the time of purchase, and you can use it at seven locations. The downside is the lines are most likely long.

Spice Market at Planet Hollywood: They have a great variety of dishes. This place would be good if you want to enjoy various kinds of foods. Quality of each food was okay. Alien liked their desserts. Not too sweet.  
 
La Village at Paris: Alien enjoyed foods from each province of France. Alien loved quality of each food here, although this place wouldn't be the best for those who want to try many kinds of international foods. They have crab legs during dinner time. You can have a made-to-order crepes. There would be a long wait line for a crepe, but the crepe is fresh, warm, very yummy, and worth for waiting! They also have a plenty of yummy desserts. You must wait to enter but the quality is promising.  

Paradise Garden at Flamingo: They don't have so many kinds of foods.  Their foods are mostly standard American. Quality of each food is fairly high. If you want to have a good American-food buffet, this place is great. They have a large dessert station with good cakes and pastries. They even have sugar-free desserts.   

Flavors' at Harrah's: So many kinds of foods (Mexican, Chinese, Sushi, Italian, etc.) in a large place. Quality of each dish is high. They have many dishes on small plates, which are easy and fun to pick.

Note that they're not actually open 24 hours a day; actually none are open past 10pm.  Also, the Ceasars Palace dinner is dark on Tuesday and Wednesday I think, so make sure to double check on availability.

How many buffets can one indulge themselves with in a 24 hour period?  I was able to do three - Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Ceasars Palace.  A quick rundown: Paris lunch was just okay IMO, but the fact that you can get a custom made to order dessert crepe is pretty cool.  PH had the best selection for dinner.  Ceasars lunch (the following day) was probably the swankiest, but not as good as PH.  My group and I opted to skip Ballys, Harrahs, Imperial Palace, and Rio.  I wouldn't have minded checking out Rio, but it's proximity to the places we were gaming pushed it off the list.

If you are thinking about taking on this feat, you may need alcohol.  Do it on the weekend and check to see which buffets include champagne and bloody marys with brunch.  Lago is your best bet early in the morning and some of the other buffets after 10:30am.  I think each buffet (except for IP) sells line passes at the VIP lines.  If the lines get long, buy the passes so you don't go crazy.  See the pics or the event link for Ken M.'s great schedule.

2291422,2016-12-31,3,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I last attended the Buffet of Buffets deal here in Las Vegas about 3 years ago, back when it was $45 per person. Then, the food was FAR better, and a total of (if I remember correctly) 9 buffets were included, from other resorts such as Luxor. The food back then was dished more intricately and presented way more luxuriously, and the quality and taste of the food was pretty much out of this world. I remember leaving extremely satisfied and not being able to wait for next time.

However, this year (2016), not only has the price per person jumped up to $60 (which is still an okay deal, just not much of a killer bargain), the food has downgraded TREMENDOUSLY. While planning my trip, I scoffed at some of the reviews here on Yelp that critiqued the quality of the food and described it as trash, but now, I can totally understand why. The food is not awful, but it's definitely not any more than ""okay"". 90% of the dishes at every buffet (even my once favorite Le Village at Paris *sob*) was on or below par with what you'd see at a buffet like Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral. The only foods that stood out any were some of the meats (like prime rib), crepes at Le Village, and the desserts at Harrah's. 

The other foods were, of course, palatable, but did not impress me. Even the sushi was no better than what you'd find premade at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's (yes, really). 

I think that if you've never experienced Buffet of Buffets before 2014, you might think this a good experience. However, for those of us who know and have experienced when things were once far better, we're shocked by the huge drop in quality and value. I would say that, now, the buffets offered here are no better than $15 for lunch and $25 for dinner. 

Pre-2014, Buffet of Buffets was a must-do killer bargain for all Vegas vacationers. But now, I would not do this deal again and definitely can't recommend it to anyone. Even if you have cash to burn, it's better wasting it somewhere else (which isn't that hard to do in Vegas).",r801ueHQdKA1Ie4YIRQuWg,16,2,2,MtY3C4nQ__vMsnRKgZ3sxg

Crab was good. Asian food was just OK, but not bad. Desserts were plentiful, and some were good (mouse), but the creme brûlée was liquidy. Over all a good meal, but too expensive. You can go to a good restaurant and order a $40 entree and spend less, and get a really good meal. Good food at a buffet is good, but too much just makes eating hurt. For $100 (for 2) I want good food, but I want to leave the table really satisfied, not in pain.",IXtSOAjsYpx27g3Qb2qbgQ,1,0,4,HZA8tBjThQgTyhm9pYaTZQ

Many choices of hotel buffets to hit up, of course, some better than others.  This is definitely recommended if you know you're going to be buffeting most of your stay.

I checked out Caesar's Palace (twice for breakfast), Paris (dinner), and Planet Hollywood (lunch).

By far, my favorite was Planet Hollywood's Spice Market.  So many options and good meat and seafood, I wish I had gone here for dinner instead of lunch.  Paris's Le Village dining setup is a mess, I really didn't like it.  Seating was either outside or in the little rooms and I thought it was a lot of wasted space.  The buffet seems a lot smaller than CP and PH's too.  Wasn't thoroughly impressed here though their prime rib was good.  Caesar's Palace Lago buffet, I can't really say much since we were only there for breakfast and you can't really go super right or super wrong with breakfast.  Caesar's Palace wins for best service out of the three though.

I'd probably do this again if I think I'm up for feasting most of the day and when that day comes, definitely going to hit up Harrah's and Rio.  But other than that, I'll probably wanna hit up other better buffets and give them a try (Bellagio, Wynn, Cosmopolitan, etc.)",zyICJ6S9l9EKsVnoI-_irQ,2,1,4,UHuWiPPmuGQJuFjeW0hBtQ

Planet Hollywood does free champagne and mimosas starting at 10 am for brunch. Oh and when we went to planet Hollywood for dinner they gave a free beer, which is smart so you fill up on a cheap beer instead of food. 

Crab legs were a little dry, but always indulge. Prime rib was raw but good. Overall I'm disappointed the price went up dramatically. $50 is only for like Sunday through Friday at 11 am. Weekends are $70! I'd dare say it's not even worth it.",4MuZ1jRxxIX0bWX48G6VUw,8,2,3,r42z6bz6zdwgJ0qnou-yyw

2407542,2010-12-26,3,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"My wife decided she wanted to try the Buffet of Buffets for her birthday last month. I'm not a huge buffet fan and the prospect of eating at 7 buffets in one day was not something I was looking forward to. But it was her birthday so I agreed. And I have to admit I was kind of looking forward to trying that many places in one day.

Our plan was to hit every buffet in one day. Did we make it? Let's see...

We started our journey at 7:51 a.m. at Le Village at the Paris as we wanted to try their breakfast crepes. I had lyonnaise potatoes, chicken and bacon sausage, an assortment of cheeses, warm cherries, scrambled eggs with lox, and poached pear. It was all very good. My wife had a banana and blueberry crepe and eggs Florentine which were also good. The waitresses were extremely friendly and the setting was very unique and Parisian. The Paris had the best service of all the places we tried.

Next we walked to the Emperor's buffet at Imperial Palace. We figured this would probably be one of the worst buffets so wanted to get out of the way during breakfast time when most places have the least selection. We were right. This was BY FAR the WORST buffet we tried. I did not like this one at all. Not much looked appealing. I only had a Little cottage cheese, a tomato, and a fried shrimp. The shrimp was rubbery. My wife had a mushroom salad and a macaroon. The macaroon was decent. There are many much better buffets in town. I will not be back.

We then walked over to Flavors at Harrah's. This was the surprise (almost) gem of the day. There was lots of variety and not just your standard buffet fare. I had shu mai, bananas foster, banana pudding, corned beef hash, and fried plantain. It was all pretty decent. The downside was the service. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks (soda and water). I hate eating without having a drink to cleanse my palate. Several other patrons were also getting noticeably upset by the delay with the drink orders. Good selection and food, but definitely the worst service of the day.

After 3 (albeit very small) meals in the same number of hours, we needed a break from eating. So we walked over to the Flamingo and strolled through their bird sanctuary area. It was a lovely day and I really enjoyed looking at and reading about all of the birds, fish and turtles.

Next up was the Paradise Garden buffet at the Flamingo. This was a middle of the road buffet. The crab legs were kind of sad looking. The Mac and cheese was tasty. The desert bar was one of the best of the day. I especially liked the chocolate fountain with strawberries and marshmallows to dip in it.

By this time we really were not hungry, so we decided to walk through the Forum shops and watch a couple of the free shows there.

After that we headed over to Lago at Casear's. I thought this was going to be one of the better buffets. I was wrong. This buffet was just okay. The crab legs were bigger than the Flamingo's and the Mac and cheese was good. The cookies on the dessert area looked dry. So-so overall selection.

By this time we were getting tired and my phone was starting to die from taking pictures and writing reviews all day, so we headed back to the Paris to sit in the car for awhile and charge our phones. When we got to the car, I couldn't find my keys. Keep in mind we had walked all over the strip and through the Forum shops. Many of the keys on my key chain (including my car) are the only set I had. I didn't even know where to start looking for my keys. We figured we'd retrace our steps and start calling every hotel and buffet we'd been to. We were already at the Paris so I first stopped by the buffet to see if they had found my keys. HALLELUJAH! My keys were there. What a relief!

We returned to the car and rested for an hour or so. Then we walked over to the Spice Market buffet at the Planet Hollywood. This ended up being my favorite buffet. They had a great selection. Highlights were the lamb and baklava. By that point, I wasn't really looking forward to another buffet after grazing all day, but this made me want to actually eat again. That says a lot when you're on your 6th buffet of the day.

Next we walked around the Miracle Mile shops for awhile to burn off a few calories before hitting our final destination.

Lastly, we drove over to the Rio for our finale at the Carnival World buffet. The Rio was the biggest of the buffets and had decent quality. This was my second favorite. Nice variety with something for everyone. We finished around 9 p.m.

We talked about getting up early and hitting a breakfast buffet before our time ran out...but the next morning the last thing either of us wanted to do was eat.

I'm glad we did the Buffet of Buffets, but it was definitely a once in a lifetime experience. I don't ever want to eat that much again in my life. It's a great deal though and I would consider buying a pass again and just hit up two or three of my favorite buffets.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,9,7,4,ZZDt4kiE4X34KBW7Xs0HPg
2409286,2013-05-31,2,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"We did sign up for this 24 hour deal and were able to cover four buffets. 

First stop was Caesars Palace for dinner; we were charged an additional $25.00 which was a big surprise since we were told earlier that it would be $15 extra. Fresh oysters were meh, although the snow crabs and shrimp were quite good.  We had a very friendly waiter who served us drinks.  In terms of ambiance, this was probably the best buffet.  Wait was 20 minutes at 5:30 p.m.on a weekday.

We went to Harrah's at 9:45 p.m.on  the same night.  They close at 10:00 p.m. So what was left was stale and and unappetizing.  However, I had one of the best shu-mai which was hidden under a bamboo basket which nobody knew was there.  Here again, the waiter was friendly and although we did not eat much, it was an okay meal.

We stood in line for 30 minutes the next day for breakfast at Le Village Buffet at Paris. They serve OJ's in a large glass and a pot of coffee to accompany your meal.  Good selection of breakfast fare, but I was impressed with their fresh fruits ~ sweetest pineapples and strawberries and juicy cantaloupes and melons.

We ventured to the Emperor's buffet at the Quad Resort, but found out that their buffet is for lunch only.  We also checked out Spice Market at PH and after reading the yelp reviews, we decided to go back to Le Village at Paris for dinner for our fourth buffet as time was ticking by.

Again we had a very friendly waitress at Le Village and we enjoyed our last dinner buffet.

Would I do this deal again?  Yes, maybe if you choose the kind of foods that you like and do not indulge in the ""extras"" and if you don't mind waiting in lines. Overall, due to the weekday stay, our wait was relatively short and service was excellent.",6m54nq7IilsWW2wXEd4Vkg,14,0,4,ZaFN64BZsU4uHMPthGAb9A

Friday 8pm: Planet Hollywood: This was my 2nd fave buffet only because I'm a breakfast person (see Paris). They had a huge decent sized buffet. The crab legs were pre cut yay!!! They had a great selection and the prime rib was tender and delicious! This place also had indian cuisine. (15 min wait in line). The buffet is located downstairs from the main casino floor. 

Sat 10am: Paris: Heaven. Definitely my favorite buffet. Im a potatoes kinda girl so I was very, very happy with the different selections of hash browns, fingerlings, etc.. So while I was eating my breakfast they were in process of switching to brunch. They had bacon, different egg dishes, different kinds of sausage, quiche, and more. This was my fave buffet and yes i'd come around this time again so I could get the variety of foods. (The wait was apprx 20 min). I loved the decor. It looks like we're sitting outside, but really inside. Really, really, cool. The buffet is located in the back of the casino if you're coming in from the strip.

Sat 2pm: Harrahs: yuk, no line at all. That was the sign and I didn't listen to myself. Don't waste your time. This is your Hometown Buffet under a different name. Really weird thing is that for dessert, it sits behind a refrigerator case, so you have to wait for an employee to be available to give you the dessert. This is a fail. The buffet is located right inside the casino as you walk in from the strip.

Sat 7pm: Rio: this buffet is 3rd fave. This buffet goes on forever. It has the most selection. When I saw that the crab legs were not pre cut I was going to leave and try to make it back to Planet Hollywood, but they had a pho soup station and pad thai. So it was good and I was happy again. There's a lot of food from around the world to choose from. If you're driving, try to park in front of the hotel in the self parking that's west of the entrance. The door to the buffet is right there. It's nearby where the shuttle drops you off. 

If you love to eat then yes, this is the thing to do. Totally worth the money. Kinda stressful trying to manage your ""buffet schedule"" but so fun!",GR0rkVzr14NNf2c8Eq2gOw,13,2,4,dzo8QXB2Xa074Fr2v8FWQA
2442426,2010-10-03,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I highly recommend getting this pass. First sign up at one of the Harrah's Hotel/Casino player clubs to become a Total Rewards Member, then go to any of the 7 buffets and sign up right at the buffet line for the Buffet of Buffets 24 hours pass for $40 (It is for 24 hours, not just one day). You then have 24 hours to eat as much as you want. We started out around 7 ish for dinner the first night at Planet Hollywood, hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas...they have great seafood including pre-cut, hot or cold king crab legs that were phenomenal! Then the next day we woke up later then expected and hit the Paris for lunch around 11am, which was good, fresh made crepe bar (only sweet options though) good pasta and meats, rare prime rib, roast beef, chicken and maybe some others. We then hit Caesars Palace around 6 pm for dinner, which was horrible, very very small, and just not good food. The prime rib was well done, the fish very heavily fried, the lobster bisque tasted like tomato soup, just not good, desert was just like any other buffet, cookies, pastries, etc. 

So overall the buffet of buffets pass worked great, with the exception of Caesar's but apparently I should have read the reviews first and would have known, so my fault. The only thing was it was just too much food for me in that amount of time. So if you're not a huge eater I would recommend eating even later the first night, then get an early breakfast the next morning (or even just skip breakfast) and then you can go back for a later dinner...also as far as food I definitely recommend Planet Hollywood the first night when you're ready to eat a lot and enjoy, then whatever you want to try for breakfast the next morning, maybe Rio, I'm not sure how these stack up on breakfast, then probably Paris for dinner the second night, absolutely skip Caesars...

2450748,2012-12-28,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I went to Vegas on 23rd and we two got the buffet passes on 24th. Except Bacchannl, everything was pretty good and I would probably give it a five star! We didn't want to rush for buffets so that we just stayed in different buffets longer and had more food. We ended up having 4 buffets. Overall, we felt satisfied for our stomach.

Our stops:
1) Bacchanal (without eating... see above)
2) Flavors at Harrah's
3) Paradise Garden at Flamingo
4) Le Village at Paris
5) Spice Market at Planet Hollywood

At 12noon, we arrived at Caesars and were ready for the long long long queue. We saw the express line and was about to pay 20 bucks more to skip the line. HOWEVER, they told us there was a 2 hour limits for holiday.... Seriously?!? Even Wynn didn't do it... How come you can limit your guest for 2 hours for buffet! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, they will not be included in the Buffet of Buffets pass because of holiday. Didn't even mention it on website or line..... So if you want to skip the line and eat there, it costs 80 bucks per person.... NO WAY! 0 Stars for Bacchannl!


Flavors at Harrah's: 3.5
We arrived there at 2:30 for lunch. After having a mess in Bacchannl, I was just craving for food! Thinking that there was no pass in holiday, I still wanted to have buffet. When I arrived the counter, they told us that the buffet passes were still on and only Bacchanal was excluded! YAYYYYYY. We then paid $107 for 2 people including tips and tax. The options for food were a bit limited but they did have a good selection of desserts. For only 30 mins of waiting, I will give it a 3.5 stars. Recommend it for a quick late lunch/dinner.


Paradise Garden at Flamingo: 3.5
Arrived around 5:30 after Flavors. The atmosphere was a lot better than Flavors. And they DID have make-to-order crepes and chocolate fountain here! Other than these, the selections of food was pretty similar to Flavors. The queue was also pretty short which only took us about 15 mins to go in. The queue was still short when we came out at 7:30pm. Overall, I will also give it a 3.5 stars.


Le Village at Paris: 5 (Must-go breakfast)
We LOVED it! The atmosphere and surrounding environment were awesome. Food selections were a lot more than Flavors and Paradise. We didn't expect that much after going to Flavors and Paradise. We will DEFINITELY come again in the future. We came here at 8 and there was a 15 mins wait... when we came out at 9:45am, there was around 45mins -1 hour wait! So come early and get prepared for a big, satisfying meal! Make-to-order crepes again :] Just go and you will love it!


Spice Market at Planet Hollywood: 4.5
Our last stop for BoB at 11:45am. Queue was not too long since it was not yet lunch-time. Crab legs were cut off so they made it easier for you. AND they did have Oysters which we couldn't find in any others buffets including Wynn! They also had cotton candy as well. Food selections were not so bad: they have Mexican, Asian, Soup, Mediterranean, Mid-eastern, salad, seafood......


TIPS:
1) Eat at embarrassing time (7:30, 11:30, 2pm, 5:30pm, 8pm): in this way, you don't waste your time in queue
2) Take a look at the map and plan ahead: you don't want to waste your time on walking around... try to have two meal in surrounding areas
3) Dont eat like the end of the world for EVERY buffets: you think it's worth it... but if you get the buffet passes.. you still have many buffets to go!! So just eat something really good or you really want :]
4) Remember to TIP your waiters or waitresses.",00mBrSCrfuWIPIP-7v4YUw,4,1,4,dFhglMNZOxzRWzLVTvNIHQ

We at the buffet at Caesar's Palace for lunch, which is a bit small. The main dishes were fine (nothing spectacular, but not bad either), but the desserts were really good! They have delicious oreo kisses that is just AMAZING.

Just got back recently from my trip. 

Buffet of Buffets includes multiple buffets located in multiple hotels. I didn't get to go to all of them considering that it's just too difficult to do so in 24 hrs and I'd probably have to schedule my whole day around visiting each buffet. I did manage to visit my favorite ones so that was okay with me, the carnival buffet in rio,village seafood buffet also located in rio, and the spice market buffet in planet Hollywood. 
It was definelty worth the price considering we came to visit a total of 5x within all the buffets. We did get out money's worth.

A little tip: try to purchase your pass afternoon or late afternoon.

Food is decent - obviously, it is a buffet, so occasionally you are going to cross a dried out piece of meat that has been under the heat lamps too long - but for the most part, I would say if you are in Vegas on a budget, this is the way to go.  My favorite was the Wynn, which we went to as our last meal. 

My suggestion is to make sure your timing and planning are really good - BoB is only good for 24 hours, so we purchased later one evening right before we went to dinner, then were able to have breakfast, lunch and dessert in that time period.  We mapped out where we were going that day, and tried to time our buffet visits for off hours, since the lines can get quite long.

We paid $50 + tax at exactly 12:06pm at the Rio, and started our journey there.  
By the end of the 24 hour period, we had went in a at at least half a plate of food at 5/7 buffets.
1. Rio- Brunch- service was OK, LOTS OF VARIETY- I was already extremely full when I discovered there was a whole other half of the buffet I haven't seen before. They had a really yummy dessert station with a Gelato booth. The must try was there Asian noodle bar; where you can have Pho, egg noodles and other types made. 
2. Planet Hollywood- Dinner, had a really nice waitress who recommended stuff for us to eat there, their middle eastern bar was the must try, I absolutely LOVED their lamb kabob's, Not as much variety as the Rio, but my favorite by far. 
3. Flamingo- Dinner- in my experience- TERRIBLE, their must try Chinese food station was closed down for the night, so I am not sure if my judgment was valid. The food, was generic, and not that great. Only decent thing they had was the Chocolate Fondue, and the Burrito Bar where someone could make it for you. 
4. Harrah's- Dinner- Pretty good food, but I don't have an accurate opinion since, my stomach was exploding by the time we made our way over to this buffet. Their must try was the Prime Rib, but I didn't try it. They also had a very yummy Gelato Station- Mint flavor! The service we got there, wasn't the best though. 
5. Paris- Brunch- I don't know if it was the fact, that I was no longer exploding from all the food, but this buffet was definitely delicious. The interior of the buffet itself was quite beautiful. I didn't really try the dessert station, but their sushi was quite delicious, and their pesto pasta as well. They also served Smoked Salmon on toast with cream cheese! Lastly, their Crepe Station was quite nice.

RIO- Huge food selection, good service, fresh tasting food

PLANET HOLLYWOOD- A big selection like the rio, but the food just wasn't quite as good

PARIS- Some odd food selections, food quality not that great, and limited choices.

This was quite a steal for the price, Both the Rio and Planet Hollywood were $25 for dinner a piece, so even if we went to just those 2 buffets, we saved $10 doing the pass, and in addition got a lunch buffet at Paris.

Maybe it was because we were there during ""off season"" but the lines weren't that long, the longest we had to wait was about 10 minutes.

2557733,2011-04-08,4,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"The Buffet of Buffets.  A game of Monopoly for your tummy.

Like any good game of Monopoly, grab the car.  The Rio isn't really walking distance, and it's the Boardwalk of buffets.  If your appetite is the thimble, you wont be getting a true value.

Speaking of value, let me crunch a few numbers here.  In numerous trips to Las Vegas, my foodie loving, wine swilling, sales tax paying, happily tipping self (and wife) spend on average $32 for breakfast, $43 on lunch (although often lunch is skipped if breakfast is filling enough) and $54 on dinner.  The BoB runs $97.27 for 2, not counting alcohol.  Since it is a buffet, eating a massive breakfast means skipping lunch.  A bottle of wine with dinner adds $10-$15 to the total (I don't need wine for breakfast) Therefore, the BoB costs about $110 for $86 worth of food.  Not a great value.  Since the BoB runs for 24 hours, we maximized value by starting our 24hr clock with a late dinner and ending with an early dinner the next day.

If you already planned on doing this, then you are the person that would willingly trade away the more expensive green properties for the cheaper gold (or red) properties.  You are a wise one, Uncle Pennybags.

In Monopoly, some properties just aren't worth the money. Baltic and Mediterranean Aves spring to mind.  Likewise, the Imperial Palace buffet isn't worth the belly space.

Caesars Lago buffet is perhaps the most popular, like the light blue properties between Oriental and Connecticut.  Since your 24 hour pass expires exactly at 24 hours, don't head to Caesars with 30 minutes left. Your pass will expire as you wait in line.

In the end, the BoB is just a good value, but not a great one, and not even that if you don't plan well.  Like Monopoly, it's fun, but not great fun.  It is a viable dining option though.",cMAiTrM0Fxm8vKLQag53jg,3,1,3,Ho9pBNItZf6SnXtjMUPdDA

Definitely a great deal as far as food goes in Las Vegas.  

This deal is offered by the Caesars Entertainment properties, which includes: Caesar's Palace, Flamingo, Quad, Paris, Harrahs, Rio (both buffets), and Planet Hollywood.

We ended up doing this more or less by accident, but I would HIGHLY recommend this approach:
Get the ""weekday"" price by buying the deal on Friday just before the price goes up on Friday at 11:00am.  The week day price is $49.95 per person.  On Friday at 11:00am, it goes up to $64.95 per person.  We purchased ours at 10:35am on Friday.

We ended up having breakfast at Quad - big big big mistake.  That was GROSS
Lunch at Paris Le Village Buffet - loved it.  Food was delicious, very flavorful, setting is cute.
Late dinner at Harrahs - meh
Brunch with bottomless Mimosas at Paris again on Saturday after 10:00am - fantastic!!

The brunch at Paris starts at 10:00am on Saturday, so with our weekday-priced buffet, we still got the Saturday morning brunch - which by itself would have been $25/person.  We happened to time it so we got there just after 10:00am, but before our buffet deal expired at 10:35am :)

Unfortunately, we did not make it to the Rio buffet, which I've heard good things about.
The Caesar's buffet, Bacchanal, would have been $20 extra per person and the line was long, so we decided against it.

I would definitely do this again...but skip The Quad and Harrahs.",1YZ0wUpBZPEYHXUsQAjF4g,28,2,5,3EX-umZdEtMq8_oWKp5GKw

Overall, quality of food was mediocre, maybe better than what you might find at most buffets in your town. Definitely not like what I'd expect when you think, ""Vegas buffets!""

The pass went up from when we got in in June.  Now it's $39.99 (up $5 from last month) for Total Rewards members, and I think $44.99 for non members, but it's worth the money, either way.

The pass is good for 24 hours at seven buffets, including the awesome Rio buffet.  I recommend getting it around lunch, so can get lunch, dinner, breakfast then lunch (or just brunch the next day).  Dinner works too, but if you're going out (clubbing or shows) it might be tough to ""force"" yourself to squeeze in the 3rd/4th meal.

Best thing about it is that as opposed to eating like a monster everytime, you can pace yourself out.  You don't feel forced to ""get your money's worth"" like you normally do if you shell out $40 for one buffet.

Definitely get this.  $40 breaks down to almost 15/meal, and just don't forget to give a tip.  Each time you go.  I know that means it costs a little more, but honestly I've never (knock on wood) had bad service at any of the buffets, even though some of the food was subpar (which I would always have over the alternative; good food & bad service).

So again, get this.  Maybe even if you have kids.  Because even if they just want dessert or just to nibble on something, better paying $40 once then $40 everytime.  Or, just sneak them out a cookie/ice cream.  :)",wa40Yx8wrZfiRqTgZsdd0g,2,0,5,grgAiw3WB1K-BlRhiuTtBw

But there's a reason that these 7 buffets are on the list. With the exception of Le Village and possibly the Rio Carnival buffet, these buffets seem to be struggling on their own and wouldn't be able to draw enough people in on their own. 

During our weekend there, we hit up Le Village for lunch, Rio Carnival for dinner, Spice Market for breakfast, Flavors at Harrah's for lunch.

There were a lot of repeat items throughout these four buffets, but the standouts were pesto pasta and prime rib at Le Village, the beef and pork ribs at Carnival, and the crazy vast amounts of offerings and items at Rio Carnival. Everything else just seemed like a glorified version of Hometown Buffet. 

I will say that the bottomless fountain drinks and the gelato offerings were definite pluses, but nothing extremely special about these places. The Wicked Spoon [not one of the Buffet of Buffets offerings] was a definite plus way to end our weekend in Vegas, as that buffet was worth going on its own.

Buy the buffet pass fairly late for your first night's dinner. Gorge yourself on the wonderful options. Have another buffet at breakfast. Have another at lunch. And eat a second dinner all on the same pass (as long you you do it before your 24 hours is up).

You have to pay extra to do Caesar's Bacchanal, but it's still worth the upcharge. My recommendation would be Le Village at Paris as your breakfast option. It excels in the morning and is nothing special at other times. If you love seafood, the Rio's seafood buffet is a good choice for your other dinner. The lunch options are all pretty much the same. Bacchanal is not worth the upcharge for lunch when you consider that it will be your 3rd of 4 meals in a 24 hour period. You're just not going to get your money's worth there. So do a boring lunch one like Spice Market at PH.

I took advantage of the Buffet of Buffets deal when I was in Vegas in April 2010. I never knew how awesome this deal was until my last Vegas trip (May 2011), where I dropped $121 for two at The Buffet at Wynn ($46/ea ""Holiday Pricing"" on a Post Office holiday BS + we had the so-called ""unlimited"" champagne for an additional $10/ea, but with the slow refills, it wasn't truly ""unlimited"").

Vegas has mastered the art of the buffet. None of the three buffets we tried were bad, though some were better than others.

My group of friends tried the following buffets (in order of favorite to least liked):
1. Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood - great selection and overall quality of food (dinner) - I'd say quality of food was close to that of The Buffet at Wynn
2. Lago Buffet @ Ceasar's Palace - went here for a fantastic breakfast.. great service and drinks are quickly served
3. Flavors Buffet @ Harrah's - lunch - worst of the three, but not horrible. Ambiance was underwhelming, but they do have a chocolate fountain where I was able to dip my Rice Krispy Treats in.

Overall a great deal. Although I remember it being cheaper in early 2010, you still can't beat the price at under $50 for 3+ meals. It sounds like we missed out on the Paris buffet, but I'll make a point to check it out if I do BoB again.

Only downside to the Buffet of Buffets deal is that you have to continue to wear the wristband the whole time you do it (so when you sleep, shower, go to the pool, etc.. it will be in your pictures lol).",HCPpzzWzdFLIhJHNNgCheQ,4,1,5,LNN8A3CgtlpA7QPLQE5d7g

If you buy the first one around 8pm you will get that dinner, then breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day.  It becomes worth it if you do all that.  If you are in an entrance line when the time expires, you are outta luck, so be sure to be inside your last buffet before the time is up.

We bought ours in line at the Rio (Carnival World).  I'm not sure if you can buy it in the other lines as well, but I would assume you can.  The included buffets are adequate, especially if you include the Carnival World.  We had hoped to do Bacchanal despite the extra cost, but it would have been tight to get to our show (plus we weren't really hungry by the time our last dinner buffet had to be done).  So we didn't.  Next time maybe we'll do it first.

You get a $5 discount if you are a ""Total Rewards"" member.  It's free to get a card at any Total Rewards desk (I know they have them at Rio, Flamingo, and Harrah's, and probably also at Paris and Planet Hollywood since they're all part of the buffet pass).  But you do have to be over 21 to get a card, so if you're bringing kids they will be full price (because they can't get a card).",YJYFsF4z-C2qODH5HnGXiw,4,0,4,qu9CPO3vPoUMdDtCewfKFQ

3173102,2011-08-30,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Totally worth the money!! For $50 (for non hotel guests and $45 for hotel guests) you can eat at any of their buffets at their seven hotels in 24 hours. Except Rio Seafood Buffet; that is an additional $15 fee per person, but I recommend it! Each of these buffets costs between $25-35 per visit so if you eat a lot, like most people do on vacations, you should totally invest in this wristband. It will save you a lot of money! I ordered mine online, but you can go to any of the cashier station and stand in line to purchase a wristband right before you dine.

It was $55 with a rewards card ($60 without) plus an additional $30 each for the premium bacchanal at Caesars (totally worth it). So we did that late the first night then the next day had breakfast at the Flamingo (underrated IMO), a light lunch at Paris (nothing special, but a few good things like French onion soup, and surprisingly, hummus), and dinner at the Rio (very good, even without the extra $15 seafood option).

Anyway, so that's like $130 worth of buffets for $95, definitely worth doing at least once to find out which ones you like the best. You can also add all you can drink to any of them, my advice would be the $13 ones at Paris or Rio since they at least had Blue Moon, the other ones I saw were either overpriced or didn't have as good of a selection.",wrxGMgawIKfjo4OPhrfwXA,5,0,4,mvUZT0B5OROVMkHFKColpw

I was able to eat three times in the 24 hr period.  I had lunch, dinner, and breakfast the following day.

I purchased our passes at Harrah's because it was the closest to TI of all the seven buffets.  Word to the wise ask the staff what are the best buffets.  I was advise to eat at Planet Hollywood, Rio, and of course they promoted Harrahs.

Lunch at Harrahs it was suprisingly ok.  The assortment did lag a bit but the food itself was tasteful.

Dinner at Planet Hollywood. Food selection was good. The assortment was much greater than the Harrahs.

Brunch at Rio.  Although I had to take a taxi which was well worth the 7 bucks instead of waiting on the trolley at Harrahs to commute.  This was the best of the 3 buffets that I had. Now its time to get buffet wasted.  The seafood was great.  The sushi was great and the crepes  to order were awesome.  The endless Mimoso didn't hurt a bit either.

This is a great deal but you must have self control because if you don't shit will get real quick. The key to success is to plan the hell out of your meals. Time, Location, Date, it's all important. You can get 4 meals out this sucker if you play your cards right. The best way to do it in my opinion is Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch, and possibly Dinner again.

Don't eat too much or you'll skip a meal and lose out on some savings.

I recommend the following:

Breakfast @ Le Village Buffet (Paris) - Best breakfast buffet period. They have everything from eggs benedict, waffles, and a crepe and an omelette station. Don't forget the French Toast!

Lunch @ Lago Buffet (Caesar's) - There's not much of a selection here but the atmosphere is nice and you don't want to fill up for dinner so you should be fine. Eat lite and try the Gelato!

Dinner @ Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - Selection and Quality, this is the place you want to have your grand meal and indulge.

Most people utilize the 24 hrs by eating a late meal one day and finish off with an early meal the next. So if you're talking a 3 meal/day average.. that's 4 meals total.. about $10/meal for a buffet.. Certainly not bad.

Of the 7 places you can go to, the my top 3 favorite ones (in no particular order) would be PH's Spice Market Buffet, Paris's Le Village Buffet, and Rio's Carnival World Buffet.

Caesar's Palace's Lago buffet is also good, and I wouldn't count it out for a place to try. Their desserts lean only very slightly in the good direction and their overall selection is a bit smaller than the others.

I did the 24 Hour Buffet pass, which is basically the pass you get for free when booking a room through the Buffet of Buffets hotel/meal offer.  The cost to purchase this ticket outside the hotel offer was $45.00person, and you get 24 hours.  You also can choose from 8 different food establishment options.

I started with Flavors @ Harrahs for lunch, this was a good lunch with a good variety, and excellent desserts.  The cod was my #1 favorite lunch item here - excellent breading and high quality fish.  The cost of this lunch would have been $17.00 if paid cash.

Then off to Rio for the Carnival World Buffet, this was $27.00 for dinner if paid in cash.  This was very good, best gelato, and much to choose.  The asian soup station was delish, and the latin station was very good.  (I've just spent $44 in in buffets folks, and still have 12 hours to go - this is a bargain).

Then it was Le Village @ Paris for breakfast the next day.  They had stellar prime rib hash and stewed breakfast fruits.  The coffee was quite good too.  $19.00 if paid cash, so this meal cost me $1 with the buffet pass.

Guess I was quite fortunate, because I only had to wait in line for Carnival World, and that was about only 10 minutes.   Dining at off-peak dining hours helped.",Plq-ECmdLbLUrrSlld_Vig,5,2,5,yFfZgQsLtD5rH_EN0etbRw

Since you can't get meals for less than $10+tip elsewhere on the strip, we went for quality before quantity.  We skipped out on Imperial Palace, Flamingo, and Paris.  What we did hit up:

Rio - 'Carnival World' - Been here before, just as good as I remember. Rio's got both quality and quantity so we had all 3 meals there.
Breakfast includes most standard fare -- couple kinds of eggs and potatoes, ham, 1 kind of smoked salmon, fresh fruit.  
Lunch comes out around 11am, char siu bbq and roast chicken, misc carbs that I avoided like bagels and potatoes.
For dinner that starts around 4p-- TONS of cocktail shrimp and snow crab, a not so good prime rib, char siu bbq and roast duck for dinner, delicious gelato (cookies and cream not so much though, I tried 4 flavors). The sushi was TERRIBLE, like 2 day old grocery store sushi that's been sitting in the refrigerator.  I didn't even feel safe to eat it. 

Caesar's - ""Lago Buffet"" -- Breakfast had tons of cute cups of yogurt and telltale garnish...along with SNOW CRAB LEGS...FOR BREAKFAST?!  It was nonsensical, but fabulous!  See my review for Lago individually for more details.

Harrah's - Flavor's - Suitable breakfast -- congee and those fried bread things were the most memorable.  Good egg/chorizo mix but SOMEONE has to help (all) of the Caesar's/Harrah's properties with their tortillas!!  Ice cream was not so great but there was cotton candy for breakfast!!

PH - Totally not worth the time, stopped by and was definitely unimpressed by the lukewarm -EVERYTHING-

3449233,2013-11-27,9,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Gluttony at it's best!!

This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. 

Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. 

If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...

Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!

I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!

3466440,2013-12-22,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"3.5 stars rounded down!

When they first introduced this program a couple years ago, it was a GREAT deal. $49 all you can eat for 24 hours right on the Strip is a STEAL.  For the most part, you would only have to eat at 2 buffets to earn your money back since most of them are in the $20-$30 range.

However, fast forward to now. They made changes to the rules. So the $49 is only for weekday pricing, if you purchase it on the weekend it will charge you $65-$70. The quality of the buffets have also gone down a lot. Costs are always going up, and buffets tend to be the most cost efficient options, so casinos still have to balance out costs and quality. 

The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars hands down you must try..however, you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit. It's $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $25 for dinner. It only ends up being a $10-$20 discount from it's normal prices, so that's something to consider.

Besides Baccahanal, my favorite buffets are the Rio and Paris ones.  Harrahs and Flamingo are standard buffets with no standout items, and Planet Hollywood for whatever reason is just a really shitty buffet. And they got rid of the Imperial Palace (aka the Quad) buffet, which didn't matter because that buffet is worst then Hometown Buffet.

The reason why I rated it down because I wouldn't eat at half of the buffets if they weren't included on the list. Many of the buffets just aren't tasty, and worth eating at.

I don't see much value in the wristband anymore especially if you are staying on the weekend), i rather get in a solid meal at Bacchanal for breakfast/lunch at normal price. And enjoy light meals throughout the day (ie: Earls, Pinks, etc), I'd still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfied with the food.

However, I still think it's a good deal especially if you are a big eater. An extra plus, if you are staying in any of the  Total Rewards hotels that participates in the program since you can get food and drink whenever you like. I stayed at Rio once, and literally would pop in every couple hours for a snack.  

So it depends on how much you eat and what your daytime activities entail, but one thing is for sure..SIGN UP AND BRING YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD...if you don't have one, you don't get the $5 discount!

My boyfriend and I decided to do this, as we were both TR members, and it sounded like a good deal. After reading all the reviews, we planned on hitting Spice Market and Rio for dinner, Paris for breakfast, and Caesar's Palace for lunch. Unfortunately, it didn't go as planned. We started with a late dinner at the Spice Market in Planet Hollywood, around 9pm. Missed breakfast at Le Village Buffet at Paris, so early lunch at Paris, then skipped lunch for dinner at Rio's Carnival World buffet.

We enjoyed all our meals at each buffet, but did end up waiting almost an hour for both Paris and Rio, so do take that into consideration. Would definitely consider doing this again next time we're in Vegas.",OEf2a1rQo54q9CSgmBI2kQ,4,0,5,JqbLTgTaP-njPBa1llX6gw

I recommend getting that because it will be $5 more if you are not total reward members and you have to wear a band around your wrist if you don't have the reward card & ID.

Here is my prefer buffet location from the buffet of buffets list if you don't want to pay any extra to go to Bacchanal & Seafood Rio:

From best to worst:

1. Paris
2. Rio (Reminder: Mon-Fri Rio Buffet open @ 11am)
3. Planet Hollywood 
4. Flamingo
5  Harrah's

I do not recommend you buy the pass at weekend price, not only because it cost $15 more but the line is extremely long, you just waste your vacation time lining up to save on buffet.  

Only purchase this pass if your family just want to eat buffet for the next 24 hours, this will save you a lot of money.  Three buffets will be the maximum you can eat.  I probably will only recommend Paris & Rio because Planet Hollywood's quality recently dropped.

1. Harris, no additional charge, 2nd best food out of what we are decor was modern and clean, extra charge for bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosa's.

2. Cesar's, best food but for an additional fee, decor was upscale.

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

3669250,2015-04-05,2,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"We spent a day and half at Las Vegas. When we arrived at Las Vegas last afternoon without lunch, we wanted something that we can eat right away (but not fast food). We ended up purchasing the 24 hour passes. I think this worked out for my family for the following reasons:
1) we have 2 teenage boys 
2) we love to be able to try a little of everything 
3) we didn't have anything really planned so we could go eat at any time 

This is what we did:
5:30 pm dinner at Spice Market (PH) - we all loved their prime rib.  My kids liked the chicken wings.  My husband enjoyed a little of everything.  I liked the king crab leg.  The meat at the claw part was sweet.  The rest of the crab meat was ok.  I don't eat crab with butter, so I asked for hot water and made a little salt water to warm up the crab meat and gave it some flavor.  We did not like any of the desserts there.  Everything was too sweet and dense.
 
7:30 am small breakfast at Le Village - we tried a little of everything and stopped after one plate.  

Then we walked to Flavors, Paradise Garden and Spice Market to check out the selections.  Flavors had fruit/veggie smoothies.  But Le Village still had the best and most extensive breakfast selection.

9:30 am Le Village for breakfast again. This time, the line was outside the restaurant entrance, but they moved fast.   We waited in line for about 20 minutes. 
My flavor was eggs Benedict.  It was delicious.  The potato triangle were very good.  They had sliced bacon and a slab of bacon.  The one I saw was entire slab of fat, so I wouldn't recommend it.  But I would definitely check it out.  Lots of croissants, muffins, bagels.  They had eggs many different ways (already made) and a omelet station in the middle.   

1 pm Flavors - we were walking around on Las Vegas Blvd in the morning.  By then it was hot.  We went to Flavors to get gelato and drinks.  My kids had some waffle fries that were good.  I was not too impressed by their gelato.  It was overly sweet and did not have the right consistency for gelato.  The strawberry one was good.  Vanilla was too sweet.  Cookies and cream was better than vanilla.  But it was nice to go inside to take a break and have a soda.


4 pm dinner at Spice Market.  It was hot and we've done a lot of walking that day. Spice Market was closest to our hotel, so we went there for dinner.  There was no line.  It was the same food we had the night before.  But we were able to enjoy it fully by picking out just the food we liked.",uq2XFo6dLec6kX5vx5O96w,5,0,5,gw68Wjn9tiroV9ha1E57sw

Spice Market at Planet Hollywood: Has the best variety. Skip the Mexican and Italian portions of their buffet. It's just pasta and filling stuff that will weigh you down. Instead head to the Middle Eastern portion where you'll get some items that other buffets don't have like taboleh, hummus, and grilled skewered chicken. 

Caesar's: Crab Legs!

Paris: Floor plan laid out to look like a quaint French village, adorable!. The most bang for your buck here will be the grill where you can get tri tip and other juicy cuts. The dessert selection is really great too, macroons, eclairs, creme brulee etc.... 

The 24 hours on your ticket begins the moment you hit the register at your first stop. So start with a late dinner and use it all the next day until an early dinner.",35PnyEl7ZFyjXcWguvls9w,6,0,5,heLJbjU9iGw6OrEdE-nDdw

Well that's what I did at least.. for better or worse.

Really though, tell me how you can go wrong with paying $44 ($50 for non total rewards members) for full access to 7 buffets for 24 hours?

The economics of it just makes sense. Breakfast is about $20, lunch $30, dinner $35 if you buy them separate. Or all of that, plus some snacktime buffets for at least half the price. YES.

Plus we are not talking the nasty Fremont street buffets. We are talking the huge, international buffets with just about anything you desire. Seafood, pasta, Mexican, crepes, desserts, oiy! Just thinking about it makes me want to board a plane.

Paris' Le Village Buffet is one of my favorites, but everywhere I ate was great. Of course, plan to wait a little while at each of the buffet's.

3742246,2017-07-04,6,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I previously had purchased BOB before and the experience was great. So this time we purchased it again from Paris Le Village buffet and it was $74.99 per person due to holiday weekend (July 4th) which I think was reasonable. Upon purchasing it, I checked with the staff about the additional fee I needed to pay if I chose to go to Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace. The cashier lady at Paris buffet told us that it was $20. We found the price to be reasonable so we purchased three passes and decided to go to Bacchanal Buffet during these 24 hours. 
After many many experience with Vegas and misinformation from hotel staff, I went ahead to check with other hotel staff at concierge and its Caesars website about the additional fee to Bacchanal buffet. Some told us $20 additional fee, website said $30, so we prepared ourselves to be charged about $20-$35. 
It was a very hot sunny day at 104F outside, we walked from Planet Hollywood to Caesars with my mom, my hubby and my two years old baby. Since my mom was platinum member, we went to the fast VIP lane and ready to pay and stuff ourselves with food. We showed the cashier lady that we had BOB and we understand that there's extra fee. But we never expected the amount the lady said. It was $44.99 extra!!! Are you kidding me??? Even your website said $30 and there's no mention anywhere in your website that said there's going to be even higher price during holiday! (Which we have already paid $74.99 holiday price per BOB pass!)
We argued with the lady that everyone from total rewards told us it's either $20, $35, and website said $30. She called the manager on duty to come over and he told us that it's $44.99 and its either you pay or go elsewhere. He told us we can go to other buffet within the BOB. I was really pissed off as I even showed him the website from Caesars and he still didn't want to honor the price! Such a bad management and so many misinformation around. They should train their staff to provide correct information to customer because basically, they were lying to us when we first purchased the BOB from Paris, the $20 additional fee was one of the factors why we would buy the pass!! If they told us it was $44.99 per head, we probably wouldn't buy it.
Anyway, since there's no point standing in line occupying the line, so we stepped aside. I immediately called the customer service line that was provided by Caesars palace website especially indicating to call when we have any question about the holiday price. I told the CS that it was July 4th weekend and I have paid $74.99 for the pass, how much would I need to pay extra if I want to go to the Bacchanal buffet. The CS said it was $35 extra fee!! So I went back to talk to the lady cashier and I put the phone on speaker. I asked the CS the same question, she said $35! And the lady cashier immediately grabbed the phone and told the CS that it was $44.99. Haha
So after we put down the phone, the lady cashier immediately informed the manager and at the end, they honored the price of $35.
The point is not about the money. The point is about providing the correct information to the customer and train your staff!! And if the website didn't even say abt $44.99, why are you charging people extra! It's like they could just name their own price, whatever they want, which is wrong! 
Bacchanal buffet is not worth going anymore. They charge ridiculous amount during holiday to rip people off. The oysters had sands in it and customer service was just fine. They didn't even refill us our drinks the entire stay. The prime rib was just so so. I think the best in the buck buffet is planet Hollywood.
So the moral of the story- do not trust any of the staff said. Stand to your ground when things happen. Justice will serve!",f3L0aUgCacLW5bRHKTd2FA,35,7,1,SL2W8nl8O6VuidEPnbdbaQ
3758561,2013-01-22,12,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I finally manned up and attempted the Buffet of Buffets.  Well, not entirely though.  I had a little bit of misunderstanding on how the pricing worked with the higher end buffets that are offered as an upgrade (Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace and Village Seafood Buffet at Rio).

So here's how it goes for Total Rewards members like me:  for $47.99 you get 24 hour access to The Carnival World Buffet at Rio, Le Village Buffet at Paris, Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo, Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, and The Emperor's Buffet at The Quad Resort (formerly Imperial Palace).  Here's the part that I misunderstood, you also get access to Bacchanal Buffet and Village Seafood Buffet for an upgrade of $15 PER VISIT.  The PER VISIT part is the where I got things mixed up as I thought it was a one time upgrade fee only.  

With that in mind, and the fact that I had only intended to use the BoB strictly for Bacchanal since it was new and I wanted to try it for 24 hours, I ended up spending more than I expected out of this.  But that's completely my fault for not reading the fine print. 

I'll get into details with how my sessions at Bacchanal went in a separate review.  However after going though two buffet meals, I remembered why I stopped doing buffets as I realized that I can't stuff myself silly like I did during my college years.  So even though I still had time for breakfast the next morning, I didn't have the appetite for it and just omitted it.  I was in major food exhaustion.  LOL

For what it's worth, I still think the Buffet of Buffets is a great deal if you know how to plan ahead:  knowing breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, knowing locations of buffets, and also going with the idea that since you've got 24 hour access there is no need to stuff yourself silly.  Good planning of all those factors can help you get the most out of your 24 hour pass.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,24,8,4,q0YrZ6ia9QZd_MwWonQu5w

You would have to pay an extra charge to eat at the Caesars or Paris buffet.. We will never purchase again. Go to Caesar's and the M buffet and enjoy another meal elsewhere. Don't fall for this scam. The casinos know that most folks cannot consume more than one buffet per day.",ir8QB-i3NcPmtXefcZpDgg,0,0,1,0EUXMmbsz8KXEn_mNPcETA

I had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.

Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.

The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.

3864976,2012-05-04,2,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Great value, but beware - not all 7 buffets are great. We got out passes late (around 8 pm) on a Thursday night at the Spice Market buffet. We were excited for the concept here because we like to try international foods and are a fan of the cuisines offered here. Unfortunately, these were nothing like what we get from actual Indian/Middle Eastern/etc restaurants. If you're not very adventurous or into authentic foods but want to feel like you're broadening your food horizons then this could be your place. I'd say skip it.

We had our next meal in the morning for brunch at Lago in Caesar's Palace. A very small buffet for Vegas standards, but everything was done well. The bacon was cooked nice and crispy, not all limp and fatty like at a lot of breakfast buffets. They had classic American staples like pasta, macaroni and cheese, chicken wings and more. They also had all you can eat cold crab legs, made to order omelets and eggs, and a fabulous meat carving station. There was prime rib with jus, carved chicken, and ham with sauces for each. The dessert station was amazing - all manner of little cookies and cakes, mousse cups, chocolates, and a sizable no sugar added/sugar free dessert section. There was a super detailed gingerbread house for the holidays in the center of the station (our visit was about 2 weeks before Christmas). I highly recommend this buffet.

We were left so full from this buffet that we didn't end up going to lunch that day. Instead, we skipped right to dinner at the Paris La Village Buffet. I had been excited for this buffet because I love the concept and had heard favorable reviews about it. We went around 7:15, to make sure we had enough time to get through the line without our passes expiring. They had a good selection of foods, as well as a crepe station. I was just not that impressed with the food overall. The meats were kind of dry and a bit flavorless, the desserts were mediocre. I'd give this buffet a try again, mostly because it seems like it has potential and others gave it good reviews, but I would probably go earlier to see if the food was better quality.

All in all, it's a great value if you can make it to at least 2 dinners. Obviously the value is better the more meals you have in 24 hours, so when I go back to Vegas I'm going to try to eat more meals but in smaller amounts to sample the other buffets on the list.",de3XFcybqQDLgaksOS3p_w,5,1,4,eGT28O4in3YtcpP31oGQ5Q

Basically you will likely eat 3 meals unless you can eat a lot you can get 4z on the basis of 3 it's $18 per meal. There's plenty of breakfast buffets that are $5-8 and lunch and dinner $8-20 . So you can eat cheaper. The breakfast at the Paris was great not sure it's worth $20+ but there were plenty to choose from. Dinner at Harrahs was decent but not exceptional. Dinner at Rio carnival was not worth the upgrade.  For the record I'm not a big eater so quality is where I get value not quantity. It's not for me.

4033183,2013-12-04,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Do it! You know you want to!

We started our 24 hour time period with a late Thanksgiving dinner and managed to hit all 5 buffets before the time was up- Insane but true!  We had to pay the $75 holiday price, but felt the cost was totally worth it for 4 meal and a snack.  

Here is my opinion on each of the buffets:
1.  Spice Market (Planet Hollywood)- Waited an hour and 15 minutes on Thanksgiving night and were very underwhelmed, but that may have been because of the mad crush of people.
2.  Flamingo Buffet- A surprisingly good breakfast buffet despite the cheapness of the casino its in.  Lots of made for you items, a wickedly long desert area considering it was breakfast, and a lot of really good food
3.  Flavors (Harrahs)- Went for lunch and found it to be in 3rd place out of the 5.  Hot food items were ok, but has a ton of interesting desert options.
4.  Paris Buffet- We went here for our midafternoon snack.  We really only intended to eat crepes.  We did take a look around and still didn't find a ton that looked interesting if we had been eating a full meal.  A little to fancy, schmancy.
5.  Rio Buffet- Our favorite!  Because they are away from the strip, it felt like they had to try a little harder to get people in.  Tons and tons of great food options.

All buffets have an all-you-can-drink beer and wine option for an extra $10-12 and there is no time limit.  We sat at the Rio buffet for three hours and didn't really eat very much, but drank our fill of wine and no one complained.  

The only bad part- you do have to totally gorge yourself to make it worth it.  I would say you have to hit at least three buffets and eat pretty well to feel like you got your money's worth.  And you will be full for about 48 hours afterwards... so if getting drunk while in Vegas is in the plan I don't recommend it because you will be far too full for the alcohol to take effect.",rXFMeu6I9a9pcRyySGSQfA,8,2,4,6UKaKOQty5p7v-w6RHmi_g

1. Rio (11:30am) - Custom Mongolian grill station, custom noodle soup station, gelato (coffee flavor is the best!), best quality/variety of food for the dollars if you purchase individually

Fortunately my husband and I took turns jumping out of line and running over to the cashier to get our cards.  We didn't even realize we were already members from back in 2005 :)  It's definitely worth the price since it pays for itself in two meals. Only problem is we got a little tired of buffets after lunch at Lago, dinner at Spice Market and lunch at Rio the next day.  I would probably get it again and just use it for two dinner buffets if you get the timing right. I've reviewed the buffets individually, but in a nutshell: Lago has terrible reviews but, although small, I loved the food quality and ambiance and would go back... Spice Market has good variety and generally good taste but is loud and feels unfriendly and smoke wafts down from the casino... and finally, Rio had some bright spots but is kinda overrated if you ask me - too big, crowded, lesser quality food, poor ambiance.

Nah not really.  The food quality is bad.  Lower than Golden Corral/Hometown Buffet and much lower than Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes.

Same cold, dry, stale dinner rolls/buns.  Peel and eat shrimp. Identical deserts and icy/too sweet frozen yogurt.   Generic generic generic.

Nothing here is quality.  Crave asian food?  You're better off going to Panda Express.  Chicken?  Rotisserie chicken from a supermarket deli is better than the dried up dusty tasting chicken here, and I'm talking about the dark meat.  Try the breast.. you'll choke trying to swallow it.. lol.

4189714,2012-03-17,4,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"All throughout college, I have frequented The Strip countless times, and every time I have been tempted by the Buffet of Buffets (B.o.B.) billboard ads. 

Problem is, when you're with a huge group, everyone's sole mission is to hit up as many bars and club, and get as schwastey as f***... there's simply no time to spare on buffets.

So, it was Chris K.'s 21st last March, and we unintentionally made our Vegas trip a romantic getaway (surprisingly, Vegas is very suitable for couples... who would have thought?) with very few plans. We're both fatties, so the B.o.B. seemed like the obvious choice to spend our weekend. Plus, you save a lot of money, because for $55 / person (I am not a Total Rewards member, and this amount includes tax) you can pack in 4 meals and ""snack"" buffet trips.

(1) The start of our B.o.B. adventure was at the Carnival World Buffet in Rio for dinner. The only one off the strip, and this particular buffet is loaded with childhood memories (and a huge food selection)... this was the one buffet we always had to hit on our fambam Vegas trips. As a child, I didn't know any better,  but the food tastes pretty crappy now.

(2) The next day, we dined on The Strip. Since we stayed at Vdara, it only made sense to have breakfast across the street at The Spice Market in Planet Hollywood... aptly named, because all the dishes were very well seasoned. 

(3) Immediately after, we hauled our filled tummies to le Village Buffet at Paris for lunch. Luckily, I didn't realize Champagne Brunch was being served, so the hour-long line gave us time to finish digesting our breakfast. The Champagne Brunch (which normally costs $27) alone justified the price of the pass... 2 brunches and we've eaten our money's worth! and you can't skip out on the Crepe bar... that was Chris K.'s favorite part of B.o.B. I know I drank a good amount of champagne, but my flute stayed full the entire course of our meal. Lesson learned at le Village: DON'T CHUG THE CHAMPAGNE!! It is a choking hazard and is a mistake not to be repeated! 

(4) Our final buffet was Cafe Lago at Caesar's Palace. Although it was impossible to find (there were no signs directing us to the entrance) and the line to get in didn't move (we missed our 24 hour mark by 10 minutes... thankfully we were still allowed in), the food here tasted the best. All the other buffets offered prime rib, but Cafe Lago additionally gave us the option of herb-crusted flank steak (super savory!!). I went back 3 rounds for the flank steak, and even had it as my dessert. Compared to the other participating buffets, this cafe has classier-looking, artistic food displays and seemed more clean, but the selection of food items is less extensive.

I am so glad to finally check off B.o.B. on my Vegas To-Do list. Worth every penny! I would do it again in a heartbeat, but need time to mentally prepare my tummy for another 24 hour food marathon...and next time, I'm hitting all 6 buffets :)",TkXGMjczu5FcQFooyhYNpA,12,3,5,vOLCtX3qPDXhRCHzDjDLGA

Essentially, it's an all you can eat 24 hour pass at the buffets at 6 different hotels on the Strip (Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah's, Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Rio).  The pass is about $60 (Sunday-Thursday) and $75 (Friday-Sunday).  These hotels sometimes throw in complimentary or promotional passes when booking with them. There are exceptions and limitations (https://www.caesars.com/las-vegas/buffet-of-buffets/faq) but for value, variety, and convenience, it's a pretty good deal. 

Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet has a wide variety of selections split into their ""Taste of Nations"" - American, Italy, Asia, Mexico, and Middle East along with Seafood, Hand-Carved Specialties, Soup & Salad, and Chef's Pastries.  As a vegetarian, am hoping that one day there will be an all vegetarian/vegan buffet on the Strip.  But there are a number of vegetarian options here - hummus, sushi, grilled vegetables, two full salad bars, pizza, etc.

Something my friends and I learned during our last visit to Spice Market when we saw over one hundred women with sashes and initially thought it was the world's largest bachelorette party - whenever Miss Universe or Miss USA takes place at Planet Hollywood, the contestants have their meals here.  Probably makes sense with a ""Taste of Nations""...  One of my friends swears that Miss Columbia took the last crème brûlée from the Dessert section right before he was about to get it.

For breakfast, I think the Paris Le Village Buffet is worth doing - it's divided into sections that have representative offerings from five provinces in France - Provence, Alsace, Burgundy, Normandy, and Brittany.  The made-to-order crêpe station here is my favorite.

If you plan it right, you can get at least 2 or 3 meals using the pass.  Or if you're really adventurous and into competitive eating, you can casino hop and try to hit all 6 buffets in 24 hours...",xZIS0iyY463Pxv9_v8GBTg,10,10,4,1mghrF8tcxo8JtmUAYmVFQ

My advice is to start your buffet time on a late dinner.  Since the buffet allows you access for 24 hours, it'll end at the time you start but the next day.

If you go for a late dinner, you get dinner, breakfast, lunch, and an early dinner.  Four meals :)  That is if you're not looking to eat out at the max.",ILvXe0EWKAH45eyUUxlv0g,25,8,4,ceLGuQFAv3q0BzOj4LdBeA

I'd been wanting to try this for some time, but didn't trust myself and my uncontrollable appetite... but my brother came to town and bought me a pass, so how could I say no?!

I strategized this as much as possible: since there is no way, no how that I can ever be out and about in time for breakfast, we decided to do lunch at noon, followed by 4:30 supper and 8:30 dinner, followed by 11am brunch the following day (the buffet pass is good for 24hours from the time of purchase). 

The consensus on Yelp! is that Rio, Planet Hollywood and Paris had the best buffets, so we made those a priority. Started out with lunch at the Rio's Carnival World Buffet, which is huge and has the best variety out of all of them. After 3 plates, we went hiking in Red Rock to work up an appetite for our 4:30 dinner at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet. This buffet was smaller than the Rio's, but pretty much the same quality of food... with the added bonus of a Middle Eastern station, which I LOVED! Based on this station alone, Planet Hollywood was my favorite buffet.

After that, I had to go to work at Caesars Palace. On my break, I stopped into the Caesars buffet [NOTE: this was before they remodeled the buffet -- see footnote] and was sorely disappointed -- it was small, with the same wilted-looking stuff they serve to the employees down in the hotel dining room!! The desserts, which supposedly they are known for, weren't even all that. The only cool thing here is they have a huge fruit bin full of kiwis, pears, apples, bananas and whole miniature pineapples...so if you're into fruit, this buffet wouldn't be a total wast of time.

Meanwhile, while I was at work my brother went and checked out the Flamingo and Harrahs, neither of which was very impressive, according to him (especially not the Flamingo). 

The following morning we rolled out of bed and waddled back down to the Paris, to try one last buffet before our wristbands expired at noon. The Le Village Buffet was actually pretty good, with a good variety of foodie-food like Brie-and-bacon mac & cheese and made-to-order crepes. Plus the ambience is awesomely kitsch: like you're inside a Thomas Kinkade painting, with food spilling out of all these little fake chateaux.  

Final Verdict: worth it, if only for the obscene fun of it all. You probably won't be able to eat $50 worth of food, but it's fun to try!

FOOTNOTE: the new Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars is WAY better than the old one...but if you want it included with the 24-hour wristband, you have to pay a $15 surcharge. Lame!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,7,1,4,1RtWuZLsJkuyVwhB-pt-PQ

These buffets range from horrible (Imperial Palace) to pretty good (Spice Market, Paris, Carnival).

The problem is even with the buffet pass, you don't get a line pass, so visiting more than 2-3 times per day (for light snacks throughout the day) would be a huge waste of time.

Planet Hollywoods was very good as well. Lots of choices from Middle Eastern to Asian to Mexican.

Harrahs was pretty good too. They seemed to have the best desserts in my

1st choice was rio's buffet. This buffet is ginourmous.  It must be 1500 linear feet long.  Its insane. And everything we ate was pretty dang good. They had these little dumplings that were delic and ny steak in mushroom sauce that was fantabulous.  The desert bar was fab too, with a gelato bar and banana foster my husband just loved.  

Next fav was the spice market at ph.  It was great.  They had middle estern food, a nice italian section and hummus with fresh naan. So so yum. 

Next was caesars palace. It is true that this was consderable smaller than the others but the quality is pretty phenom. Gourmet cheeses and pastries that were so lovely and amazing.  The meat was more tender and the sauces richer. If I had my druthers I would snack here.  Or come early for an early breakfast.  

The next we liked was at the flamingo.  They all seem to have sushi and some have crab and all had prime rib. It was fun sitting next to the flamingo habitat looking over the pond.  This one had crawfish and shrimp.   The food was great, with a crepe station. My husband loved the smoked salmon. I loved the deserts.  

The last one was good and it was paris.  They had mussels that were nice. I would have expected better bread and pastry selection as well as yummier cheeses. It was a lot like the flamingo spread.  

We did not make it to harrahs or imperial palace.  

The main disclaimer I would include that we did take into consideration that it was buffet food and we always went for the wowish foods. We avoided the starches and breads and it seemed all the salad bars were a littl sad. Who wants salad whenyou can have ny strip and dim sum? The lines were often unnecessarily long and the service was just blah or meh.  But it was fun and a great value.

24 hours of buffets for only $45 (with Total Rewards membership, which is free).

How it works: 
- Sign up for Total Rewards online
- Go to any of the Total Rewards casinos (we went to Planet Hollywood) to their Total Rewards desk, and pick up your member card
- Go to your first buffet when you're ready to start your 24 hours and pay at the cashier.  (NOTE: you cannot buy this buffet pass online!  only at the cashier at your first buffet!  This is when your 24 hours officially start!)
- Use your total rewards card as your admission ticket to the buffets for the remainder of your 24 hours.

It's such a good deal, you already get your money's worth after 2 buffets.  In order to maximize the deal, try to do 2 dinners, a breakfast, and a lunch.  That's what my fiance and I did.  

Meal 1: Started out with a late dinner at Spice Market at PH.  The food is okay... not as great as it used to be back when PH was The Aladdin.  Food here is better than the dessert.  

Meal 2: Early breakfast at 7:30am at Paris.  I've always heard this is the best breakfast buffet so there was no question about where we wanted to have breakfast.  

Meal 3: Late lunch at Harrah's.  We got to enjoy both their lunch food and dinner food cuz we came so late (we were still super full from breakfast and had to eat lunch at 3pm).  This was my first time at Harrah's buffet and it was actually our favorite of all the buffets we ate at on this buffet pass!

Meal 4: Dinner at Caesar's Palace.  We weren't hungry, but just went for the sake of going to a 4th buffet.  Plus we heard Caesar's had the best dessert... and that they did!  Their desserts are much more upscale in terms of presentation.  And they come in little cute serving sizes so you can definitely sample more desserts in one sitting!  Food was okay, but we didn't grab a lot of food since we were already full.

Some extra tips: your 24 hours starts and ends when you officially swipe your card at the cashier.  So take into account of waiting lines!  If you have a line pass or VIP member status, then kudos to you.  But if you have to wait in line like everyone else, then plan accordingly.",Pnqwg10bpCo3ApShjkoa3Q,23,4,5,iNCv0RyoDx6wOt8dE4-aZw

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll probably opt for quality over quantity (brunch buffet at the Wynn, anyone?) but still, NO REGRETS here. BoB Thanksgiving 2011 was a fantastic decision, and a great, affordable way to see who's who as far as Vegas buffets go. Plus, it's just really fun.

One thing to be aware of and to plan for, are the lines. And if you're hitting four buffets, each with ~hour-long waits... that's a lot of hours!

In summary, I ended up hitting the buffets at Paris, Flamingo, Harrah's, and Caesars. I would rank Paris first for selection and overall fun, Caesars first for quality food and a classier atmosphere. Flamingo was easily the worst of the 4.

Thanksgiving Day:
11am - Hungover-ly meander over to Paris, attempt to find the buffet, realize that oh! that huge line weaving out into the boulevard -- that's LE VILLAGE Buffet! Notice the $10/person 'Express' (read: cut the long line of grumpy hungry people), head in through the VIP double doors. Buy our Buffet of Buffet tickets as well as the $10 express pass, and we're in business! [In my mind, 2 hours is well worth $10, especially in Vegas. Plus, you can win it all back in the casinos, right??? ;-)] 

11:40am - The time we bought our tickets and received the BoB wristbands, meaning it's good until the same time the following day. Sit down, gorge myself. Crepe station had a line, no big, delicious. Most fun interior of the buffets we went to. Very large. Don't miss the tri-tip steaks tucked away in the corner! Creme brulee, yes please. Onward!

~5pm - Try to go to Planet Hollywood and overwhelmed by the line, head to the inferior but less daunting FLAMINGO (Spice...Market?) instead. Hey, I'm down for Golden Corral once in a while, which was more or less what the Flamingo buffet reminded me of. $5/person express passes, which we picked up because 1) we had a show to get to and 2) I enjoy cutting in lines, something that never got beat out of me in elementary school I guess. Whatever. Honestly not even that hungry post-Paris, none of the entrees were memorable. Chocolate fountain was delightful. Everything else was pretty mediocre, but the BoB novelty had yet to wear off, so no complaints.

~9:40pm - Fresh out of Absinthe at Caesars (was great!) where, of course, we drank the show's namesake. At this point, it seemed like a good idea to run into FLAVORS (Harrah's) before its doors close at 10pm, which was awesome. No line, grab a couple of sodas, a satisfying if generic second dinner. Yummy ice cream!

10am - Brunch at CAESAR'S PALACE, which has a surprisingly low Yelp rating for how much I enjoyed it. A short wait, and onto breakfast food! Easily the smallest selection of the 4 buffets, but by far the highest quality food. It's easy to do a mediocre batch of sausage, bacon, watery scrambled eggs, pancakes and call it a brunch buffet... but everything here was really top notch, and the omelette station looked promising. 

BUT!! Before I could get my second helping of breakfast items, the buffet transformed before my eyes to a completely lunch buffet. I was upset at first, craving more of the breakfast foods I had so carefully sampled in round 1, but it basically ended up doubling the selection, which worked out nicely. Grrrrrreat prime rib and ribeye. Hearty mac n cheese (the kind that's topped with a thick layer of crunchy bits, none of that watery shit). I'll save the rest for my proper Lago review since this is waxing long, but this was a nice way to end my BoB sprint-- with a smaller selection of some really choice items in a more luxurious, calm environment. Dessert bar was a little depressing in the sense that I was so full at this point, I could only admire the delectable selection of beautiful sweets before me.

Conclusion: BoB is a great way to invest your time and money, especially if you aren't too familiar with Vegas. You get acquainted with the mood of each casino, and by the end, you'll be a Vegas buffet expert. If you're willing to spend a little more, you can even skip the lines. Think of it as an adventure, don't take it too seriously, and you'll definitely have a good time! But it's not something I would do more than once.",uLBF79fcF0DGMW02vj2aVQ,3,1,4,yJl-Z-a4g71OwqtW-WdjNA

Six crazy yelpers. Twelve grueling hours. Seven AYCE establishments. This is the story of the BoB.

9am Lago Buffet (Caesars Palace)
My strategy was to eat a single breakfast plate. I went with a smoked salmon made-to-order omelet, some Canadian bacon, and some strawberry yogurt. I also had a couple of mimosas. Good, conservative start to the long day ahead.

10:30am Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo)
This initially looked like a pretty crappy buffet, but hidden treasures awaited. First of all, there was another section that we didn't originally see, complete with a crepe station. Then, we discovered an entire Asian section that opens up at 11am. With a nice view of the flamingos outside and more champagne in our glasses, this turned out to be a good buffet. The highlight for me was the Asian food - chicken feet, shumai, and some sort of sake dessert.

12pm Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace)
Easily the worst buffet of the bunch. The iced tea tasted strange. I went with a very selective plate of tiny portions. The only positive was that the beef stroganoff was pretty not bad.

1:30pm Flavors Buffet (Harrah's)
Though I had tried to pace myself, the surprisingly good Flamingo buffet filled me up more than I had planned. Still, we powered on. Nice buffet with a good selection. I enjoyed the Churrasco Beef from the Brazilian area, some warm crab legs, and more shumai. Their dessert section was also pretty impressive.

3pm Carnival World Buffet (Rio)
You know you're getting full when the first thing you do is sit down for about five minutes. Don't everyone get up at once! This was the last buffet that treated us to complimentary champagne (but we were in the VIP section, so don't count on that). I forgot how huge the Rio buffet is. Nothing really stood out, but I enjoyed some cold crab legs, more shumai, some freshly served beef broccoli, and some duck.

5pm Le Village Buffet (Paris)
Home stretch! The first and last thing I ate here? Why Crème brûlée of course. Other than that, just your standard fare of prime rib with some asparagus and mushrooms. Surprisingly, the crab legs were not as good as Carnival and Flavors. At least the waiter brought those out to us as opposed to us having to get them.

7pm Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood)
We made it! Diverse selection, featuring a Mid-Eastern section that you don't normally see. Highlights include roasted lamb, lamb stuffed tomatoes, and baklava. Crab legs were also available and sliced in half (length ways) for easy eating, but I was over crab legs by this point.

Dénouement:
All told, the BoB is a great deal. I would never do all seven again, but you would certainly get your money's worth with a couple of dinners and maybe a lunch or breakfast. If I had to pick two, I might go with Planet Hollywood and Harrah's for dinner, with Flamingo for a late breakfast / early lunch (so that you are there as soon as that Asian section opens up with its fresh offerings). The only problem is with lines. We were lucky in that we were hooked up with line passes.

Tip: pace yourself. If you eat too much your first meal, you might not have enough room in the stomach to utitlze the rest of the 24 hours.",rm-oUeqX0T3-SvaoGw2UJA,5,1,5,Hq78Fw8PKNy7HBAql7yPaA
4704247,2011-07-08,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Definitely a great deal if you plan it right - and we did!

The price is $44.99 if your a total rewards member, which is fast & easy to register if your not.  If you're a rewards member you can purchase the BoB plan at the register of your first buffet, and the deal expires within 24hrs.

For the price of BoB we had the chance to eat dinner on our first night; breakfast, lunch, and dinner on our second night.  
My husband was skeptical at first but on our second buffet he realized we had ate at 2 places that added up to $44.99.

I had seen this deal before on our other visits to Vegas and never thought about getting it, the price was cheaper too.  On this visit it was worth it!

It's a very popular offer and I saw many people use it.

*******
Let me show you why BoB is a great deal - with BoB we (hubby & I) each had buffets for 4 meals for $44.99 each (plus tax) and without BoB we each had 2 meals for $42(tax not incl)

Before getting the BoB we had stopped at Sbarro's to get 2 slices of pizza and 2 drinks = $20
After our BoB, we were still in Vegas and went to Chipotle to get 2 burritos and 2 reg. drinks = $22",hzK1T62UDUvetem3rwr2Zg,7,0,5,Jedw9z8gkrFQAIJInAcC5w

For those who are more on a tight schedule, I really wouldn't recommend doing this. You really have to devote one full day of doing this to get your money's worth. 

The price with a totalrewards card puts your total to 49.99 without tax. Make sure you print your cards out before you get to the counter, or they will send you back to get it or charge you 54.99 and make you wear a tacky wristband. 

START your buffet of buffets around 4-5. This gives you time to eat a late lunch, and maybe another dinner around 9. Most of the buffets close at 10. That's already two meals. Then tomorrow morning, eat breakfast, lunch, and you can also score another dinner. That's five meals for only $50! That's really a steal. With the high prices out here, you will definitely get your money's worth. 

Recommendations: breakfast at Paris Hotel, dinner at spice market buffet in PH, lunch at harrahs.

4715226,2016-09-11,8,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Here is the question to ask yourself.... Can I get the value out of 24 hours of buffets at several casinos for $59 per person?  I will cut to the chase for you with my answer...  I think it was a push.  Here is the skinny (cleaver choice of word for describing buffets): For $59, you can go to participating buffets as many times as you wish, you can buy and start your 24 hours when ever you want and at any of the participating buffets: Harrah's, Caesar's, Rio, Flamingo, PH, Paris.  My plan was to get late dinner, then brunch and dinner the next day.  I figured that would cover one and a half days of eating and as much as everything costs there, I would win.  Reality check after a huge dinner first night (my fault) and a huge brunch the next day (my fault) We only went back to the buffet for the third visit to get a diet Pepsi, some cheese and a small sugar-free dessert.  You may think that you can kill it at the buffets for 24 hours..... but.... you can't (or I can't anyway).  In the end, I figured it was a push, so I give it a 3 out of 5.

The buffets have good food and are clean and fairly nice and comfortable.  We went to Paris for dinner.  The highlights are different depending on your likes, but for me...  the sugar-free cheesecake was the best... The next day, we went to Harrah's for brunch... they had some pretty good tri-tip ... but again everything I tried was pretty good...  remember, I wouldn't consider this fine dining but an attempt at a good value.  Later that day, we were so tired from walking... it was actually very nice to have access to the buffet pass, we found ourselves in Paris just to sit down for a while and have a few sodas and some cheese.  We did not even do dinner that night.... it was just to much food, and I was just too full (again... my fault).

I will give you something to consider before you buy and advice that I will follow myself if I ever consider something like this again.  One: Think about where your hotel is in proximity to any of the participating buffets.  In other words, please make sure that one of the participating buffets is in the hotel that you are staying in.  I continue to forget how much walking is involved in Vegas.  You may think that you are saving money with this deal, but you will either be taking a long hike to them or spending money on a cab, uber, lyft, or monorail; this adds to your cost. Two: we found out after we purchased the Buffet of Buffets that the hotel we were staying had a similar deal with the neighboring casino.  It only included 2 buffets (side-by-side casinos) but we could have visited either within a 5-10 min walk. In the end, I wasn't disappointed.  Like I said, as for the cost, I think it was a push.  If I were to consider this again, it would depend upon the hotel/casino that I am staying in.",of1yXdhIyMoqxP4Mrcoe3A,13,4,3,Z7JgqoBGfMzfSfM1pliDSw

The Buffet of Buffets (Bob if you will) allows you to pay a little more than the cost of one of the buffets but gives you access to all the buffets you can make it to in the Harrah's owned properties (IP, Bally's, Rio, Ceasars, Flamingo, PH, Paris, Harrah's) within 24 hours -- there is a little upcharge for the seafood at Rio and Baccanal, both reasonable upcharges if you ask me.  You can buy Bob at any one of these individual buffets, and they will either give you a wristband, or if you are Total Rewards member, they will put the Bob on your card so you can just swipe in anywhere you go.

The reason for me Bob does not get 5 stars?  We were 4 (FOUR) minutes late (according to the time stamp on the receipt, and thier clocks) to one of the buffets, and they did not honor us getting in.

Day 1: We walked to Bally's and took the free shuttle over to the Rio. We signed up for the Member's Rewards Cards and went to the World Carnival Buffet. Our 24 hours started at 8PM exactly, which is when I said we needed to start, perfect! 

Day 2: We missed breakfast at Paris, which is what I was really looking forward to. But who really wants to get up early when they're on vacation? We went to Planet Hollywood instead and ate an early lunch there, about 11:30AM. 

We wanted play bingo at Gold Coast, which is across the street from the Rio. So we hopped on the shuttle again and headed over there. After our session of bingo, we decided to go back to the buffet at the Rio, around 4:30PM. I really wanted the won ton soup that they cook up at the Asian section. We didn't eat that much there, only one plate. We jumped back onto the shuttle back to the strip.

The last buffet we went to was Lago at Ceasar's Palace, since most Yelp reviews said they had the best dessert out of the buffets. I thought that it would be a good way to end the BOB experience and I'm glad we did. We sat down at 7PM.

My notes are: Rio had the best service, Planet Hollywood shrimp tempura was AWESOME, Ceasar's does have the best dessert...try the one that looks like a big chocolate kiss, it's AMAZING!!! 

The boyfriend and I are both big buffet fans, so we were excited to do this while visiting Vegas. I think that you definitely get your money's worth out of it.

Bought the pass at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet at 3:40 PM (that way we could squeeze in two dinners, since all their dinners start at 3 PM) 

3:40 PM Spice Market (PH) - was our first buffet and we were excited so we ate PLENTY and everything tastes promising. Tons of snow crab legs, and their prime rib + Yukon mashed potatoes were really good!! Everything else was ok.

8:30 PM Carnival World (Rio) - they had a bit of a line but it didn't take too long to get in. They had a huuuuge selection of different foods. Highlights: 
*Asian selection-made to order soup bowls (ie pho and udon), dim sum (their shu mai was pretty on point), bbq foods (crispy pork, roast duck, bbq duck)
*hot crab legs, ask for a little crab slicer from waiter
*snow crab legs agaaain 
*their Mexican station had guacamole!!! Weow
*GELATO.....I love gelato. I went back twice (sorry not sorry) 

I wouldn't get prime rib at rio..theirs was way too salty. 

8:00 AM Le Village (Paris) - where do I start..this is breakfast HEAVEN! And their decor is so awesome. Wait was long, about 45 minutes to get in. (NTS-they start at 7 AM). Highlights: 

**made to order CREPE station
**endless variety of egg dishes (fav were the EGGS BENEDICT-so good, and the lox scrambled egg)
**Lyonnaise potatoes, potato triangles, fingerling potatoes?? So many potatoes..
**endless variety of sausages as well. 
**sliced ham and slab of bacon, chef is available to cut for you
**lots of French pastries but some tasted old

I saw them making creme brûlée but they don't serve it until 11 AM :( we left at 10 AM. Would definitely come back to this one, it was amaazing.

2:00 PM Flavors (Harrah's) - you could definitely forget about this one. We ditched after two plates and left for Rio hahaha

But I did get raspberry gelato..and it was bomb. 

OVERALL-we went to 5 buffets for the price of $55 each person. $11 a buffet. Worth it especially since we couldn't enjoy Vegas to its fullest potential! Buy it during a time where you could make a 4th meal out of it. (Ie 4:00 PM)

Hour one.
Dinner: Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. A disappointment and poor start. The seafood was terrible, salty, and odd tasting. The line to get in took ~30 mins, but there were lines for the food inside. The Mexican and American food was decent. I wasn't impressed and it definitely screamed cheap buffet food made enticing via variety.

This time around, buffets sampled:

Planet Hollywood's Spice Market
Caesar's Palace's Bacchanal
Paris' Le Village

Best of these buffets IMHO:

Spice Market dinner: lamb kabobs, prime rib, crepes, soft-serve ice cream
Le Village breakfast: savory and sweet crepes, cheeses, cooked cheeries, poached pears, ham, assorted yogurts and croissants; service can be good: unlimited orange juice and coffee; omelette station
Bacchanal lunch/dinner: seafood bar (see review), fresh squeezed juices, dessert and ice cream station; decent spring rolls (though not authentic)

The mehs:

Spice Market: seafood boil, steamed crab legs, crab-stuffed sole (too salty!)
Le Village: sausages and smoked fish are too salty; service can be mediocre
Bacchanal: prime rib, cooked mussels can still be sandy; Asian food can be hit and miss

We never managed to do the 4th buffet as we had a 7 p.m. show to catch.  Including the $20/person on top of the 24 hr. pass, it came to $25/person.  The good thing is we were full-up.  The bad thing was we ate way too much salty foods!",TOy3Qf_Npdk3NfoYASR28A,2,1,3,otnIYU7clxe01392PxQB4A

First, a note... my husband and I do not have an eating problem.  We only intended to hit 3 or 4 buffets.  You can get your money's worth doing that.  But once we got a couple under our belt, then it became a pride thing to complete the challenge.  So here's how we did it.

#1 - Caesar's
We started with lunch on Friday.  The food and the atmosphere is great here.  But considering the size of Caesar's, I was surprised by how small the buffet is.  It seems they go for quality over quantity, which is not always my preference.  There was a line to get in, so keep that in mind when planning.

#2 - Harrah's
We were walking by the casino, and there was no line.  So we went in to check out the options and ended up getting a second dessert.  There's not a lot of buffets where cotton candy is available.. it was a nice, light treat.

#3 - Imperial Palace
It's an older property, and the buffet is not much more than a small cafeteria.  We got a quick salad, and moved right along.

#4 - Flamingo
I did another dessert here.  Don't judge... I'm a sucker for a chocolate fountain!  And if you're walking the Strip, the Flamingo is right next to the Imperial Palace.  So it was easier to get some chocolate and then go to dinner, rather than back-track.

#5 - Paris
We had a nice dinner here.  Again, there was a line to get in.  But since we had already hit 4 buffets during the afternoon hours, having some extra time to digest didn't bother me.  There's some nicer high-end items at the Paris, but with a higher quantity than Caesar's.  So it was one of the best of the bunch.

#6 - Rio
We didn't wake up hungry on Saturday, but the Rio Carnival buffet has always been one of my favorites.  And on weekend mornings, mimosas are included.  So knowing the hard part was over, we gathered up what was left of our appetites and headed back towards the Strip.  We would have had a nice leisurely breakfast, if we didn't have to keep an eye on the clock.  But there was one more stop....

# 7 - Planet Hollywood
In retrospect, I wish we had done this one earlier.  I had never been before, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't stuffed myself over the past 23 hours.  There are some great international items, including fresh made naan.   Unfortunately, I only had a few bites before I told my husband it was time to go home and nap.

A final note... your 24 hours start when you purchase the first buffet.  The time will be noted on your receipt.  If you're in line when your time is up, too bad.  There are generally lines at Caesar's, Paris, Rio and Planet Hollywood... some of them can be up to an hour, if you go at a peak time.  So keep that in mind, if you want to hit all 7.",oxJ4R-1TqBjegZHU6h1bKg,22,8,5,DpR3E6FJbTHqLlxRHnwetw

Pass Cost: $64.99
Surcharge: $25 Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet / $15 Rio's Seafood Buffet 

EVERYONE wants to get the most out of their pass but once you visit the places that add a surcharge, you're better off not paying for the pass. If you're strict with your budget, buy the pass and eat at the places that do not charge a surcharge. If you can get two buffet visits in with the pass, you've already gotten your monies worth. However, I didn't feel like we could eat three buffets in one day given the wait times and the lack of appetite one has after eating at a buffet. You also need to research how late some of these places stay open since most of them close at 10pm with being the exception (11pm).

Our 24 hr cost for the pass was just under $250 for two people since we visited the Caesar's buffet twice and the Rio Carnival Buffet (Yuck) within that 24 hr period. We felt the pass cost was justified given the Caesar's buffet offered mimosas / champagne that didn't make us feel bloated nor hungover later on in the day.

If I had to do it all over again, I'd pay for morning brunch without the pass and go eat at Earl's or Ellis Island for cheaper food as a night cap. I wouldn't recommend the Rio Carnival nor PH Spice Market buffet since they are much like your HomeTown Buffets and in my opinion the seafood was not really fresh. 

NOTE: The 24 hr pass starts the minute you purchase it. Your pass expires exact 24 hrs later so if you're stuck in line and your 24 hr period has elapsed .... you have to pay the full price of the buffet.",vRYjn0Ip0Zu7SnJYQp9P3Q,35,1,3,3SRTgK3NHHWKBcryk42nqg

For the simple fact that we ate a restaurant in Vegas where a cheeseburger was $15 you can see that it is going to be pricey to dine out here no matter which way you do it (unless you grab fast food or a slice of pizza). So you pay $54.99 on the spot or I believe $47.99 if you buy the buffet of buffet when you book your hotel, but either way you are saving a ton of money. If you do what we did and just buy the pass for dinner one night then you have 24 hours to eat as many times as you want so we were able to get 4 meals out of it (breakfast, lunch, and 2 dinners). You get a wrist band which is kind of annoying because you have to wear it for 24 hours but it's definitely worth it. Just avoid the typical meal times or else you will be waiting in the lines forever. We did breakfast around 10, lunch around 2:30 and dinner around 8 and did not have to wait but a few minutes in a very short line (shorter than I have waited to be seated at some restaurants back home). With the buffet of buffet you can eat at 6 different buffets (Harrah's, Planet Hollywood's, Flamingo's,  Imperial Palace's, Rio's, and Paris Las Vegas' buffets) for the price you paid and if you want to eat at  the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace you pay $15 more.

I took advice from previous reviews and started my 24hrs late, around 9pm! Purposely to hit dinner twice, unfortunately that didn't happened :(....

1st. Planet Hollywood : I really enjoyed dinner here! They had a great variety of food, enjoying mostly the Mideastern section. I was surprised that the flavor depth was there for this type of cuisine. 

2nd. Rio : We had breakfast, which is considered brunch on weekends (heads up). Loved all the selections except for the fact that the only other breakfast meat selection other than pork was a Mexican style turkey sausage that wasn't tasty! Other than that the food was delicious! The eggs are cooked to order any style! They have an array of breakfast breads/sweets! 

3. Harrah's: We stopped here for a late lunch, hints the missed dinner! The buffet here is a little smaller and has less selections but the food was tasty! I felt like the other buffets were a better pick! This was just buffet food to me!

5048070,2012-03-19,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I was torn on how to rate this deal. Overall, it is alot of food for a reasonable price-- $44.99 gives you 24hour access to six buffets (in Planet Holleywood, Paris, Harrahs, Imperial, Rio, and Flamingo). For an extra $15, you can now include the seafood Buffet in Rio as well. You can easily spend $20 each meal in vegas (and that's with the lower end places).

The hubby and I started out around 6pm at the Seafood Buffet in Rio--wasn't impressed (none of the seafood tasted fresh). Then went to Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet at 9pm. The selection looked alot more appealing and the food was more fresh but we didn't eat much since we were already stuffed from the Rio. 

The next day, at 11:30am, we started at Imperial for lunch--didn't see anything appealing (I probably had one tamale with a bunch of their salsa sauces), then went to the Flamingo and had  a small serving of soup and salad (their selection was even less than Imperial's), and then went to Harrah's--they had more of a variety than the first two, but again, nothing too exciting. We finished hoping buffets by about 2pm. We didn't stuff ourselves as again, there wasn't alot of foods that we had wanted to stuff ourselves with. 

We later went to Paris around 4:30pm for dinner. I was soooo very disappointed--their selection has shrunken drastically and the food was sooo unappealingly dry with flavors that totally numbed the palate (Not sure if it was the day we went???). We then went back to the Spice Market and finished off our dinner before the 6pm mark. 

We didn't go to the Carnival Buffet in Rio because we were there last year and had a bad experience so decided not to go back. 

I think this is how I would rate the buffets from best to worst as far as selection and quality of the food:

Planet Hollywood
Rio Seafood Buffet
Paris
Harrhah's
Rio Carnival
Imperial 
Flamingo

I probably wouldn't buy into this again. Every buffet had pretty much the same items (even the desserts look the same), with all the same grease, oil, fat and butter. I would probably invest in one good buffet (wicked spoon, wynn) and spend the rest of the time eating at local mom and pop restaruants.",BJRL058JIgpHJq4dRFLAog,5,1,2,tIexLEo3_RceeQ8pSttLDA

I love to eat myself but you really have to be able to stuff food in your mouth and be ready to eat more in a few hours to really get your money worth.  I also dislike the Las Vegas logic that friday at 1pm is considered the weekend already. That was a fail for my party, we end up having to pay the higher weekend rates.  

-The Good is that for the $65 or $70 flat fee you get automatic hey we can eat at all these places for 24 straight hours.  I loved the buffet inside of Planet Hollywood, we ended up there twice. That was the Spice Market Buffet. Highlights there were the cotton candy, mac and cheese and the Fish.  Also, the prime rib was straight on the money.   Great selection of food. Also the next morning, went to Paris hotel and got some late breakfast and Mimosas. All in all, not too bad considering we still ate alot of food. So that was three times using this buffet pass and it really should have been four but we decided to go work out instead of pig out.

-It sucks that you still have to pay an extra $15 for the RIO all you can eat Crab legs place, RIO village Seafood Buffet.  Also,  Bacchanal is one of the buffet that you have to pay extra for  - a great 2nd choice once the buzz dies down(at least that is the rumor).",AkIZlaQe7GUXttx_epYcfg,7,3,3,d7ZA71zABc_-XW5hbJdm6w

5219426,2010-10-18,10,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Lots of planning went into our ""BOB"" adventure. 

Objective: To eat as much as try as much food as possible in a 24 hour period. 

Methodology: 
We first scoured the websites of every buffet to find out the hours of operation, what was offered, and any little details such as if champagne was served during brunch. We then checked out the Yelp reviews of each buffet to help us narrow down. We also tried to lay out when each of our feeding times would be. We also considered doing exit interviews outside of some of the buffets to get the first hand experiences of consumers who tried the buffets (that didn't happen, we ran out of time). 

Parameters: We narrowed down to Rio, Spice Market, and Harrahs with Paris and Caesars as bonus options. We also had a Players Club card so it was cheaper than just off the street.

Findings: 
The buffets are only open 7am - 10pm. So there are 9 out of 24 hours that you cannot enjoy a buffet. 
Based on local observations and Yelp reviews, we automatically eliminated Imperial Palace and Flamingo as potential buffets. 
The Rio does not include the Seafood Buffet. 
If you get a Saturday or Sunday Brunch in, some of the buffets include champagne and mimosas. 

In Summary: The Rio was good and included the king crab legs which are a waste of time. The Rio had a good dessert bar. The Spice Market where we did brunch had unlimited champagne mimosas. We spent almost 4 hours in here and probably had a bottle of champagne each. Lots of precious time to try another buffet but worth it for the taste and value. Harrahs was just a mediocre buffet but a good finish to the day. Didn't fit in Paris or Caesars because we spent too much time at Spice Market. 

Recommendations: Skip the salad bar and pasta stations unless it's a specialty item. You can get lettuce and spaghetti anywhere and it takes up precious space in the stomach. It is OK to start with dessert. And take small portions so you can taste everything then go back for seconds on what you like.  And don't forget to wear either a free flowing dress or elastic waist pants.",P0pFmBdgsP4_ceJuRaMbBA,8,4,5,wrI9t9iDFT-0Tmym6SWuUQ

First, the value.
7 casinos of buffet to select from within 24 hours. If you can fit in four meals within 24 hrs, you're paying $10/meal. For Las Vegas, that's a pure win. When we went two days ago, it was $39.99 for members and I don't know how much for non-members, but why wouldnt you get membership for a player's card if it's free anyway? 
To be honest though, my bf and I only had two meals, while his family had more because they wanted their bang for the buck. Can we really fit in 4 buffet meals in 24 hours? Not for a 5'3"" girl who wants to eat everything in front of her. So it's only worth it for ppl who eat a lot. For me, I tend to skip meals because I'm lazy.

The quality of food.
Paris's dinner: Awful. So I've heard from our party. They said the oysters are alright but everything else was horrible.
Caesar's brunch: Meh
Planet Hollywood Spice Market: Okay. Alaskan King crab you can ask to get steamed up so that it's warm so very awesome. Don't try the sushi, it tastes like refrigerator.

Quantity/Variety:
Caesar's: very little variety
PH Spice Market: a lot of variety but food isn't great.

So yeah, I'm just gonna give it a three star. I've had much better buffets, but now that we're in vegas, what is considered expensive becomes a lot higher and what is considered good quality lowers. Sad but true. Maybe when I make enough money, I will go to one of those fine dining restaurants....",HyXK2GNR9i4SWpLQGOqQYQ,1,1,3,LCQDteJyKYkZDkF8gUa4Sw

If you are a true buffet lover, you should buy a breakfast ticket and stay there until close, that's the best way to save money!

5356029,2010-11-30,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Trying to feed a hungry family on the cheap in Vegas? The Buffet of Buffets is a good option. In a 24-hour period, you can visit seven different buffets as much as you want. 

The selection of buffets are widely varied. During our trip we tried Caesars Palace, Imperial Palace and Flamingo. The wait at Caesars was quite long for lunch, but in the end I enjoyed the quality of the food and service, and the environment was modern and enjoyable. 

We tried Imperial Palace because we happened to be close to it, and boy, that was a mistake! You could be polite and call the decor kitschy, but the buffet seems like an old run-down cafeteria. With a choice of other better buffets, I would avoid this one. 

We tried going to Paris (which we have enjoyed in the past), but the wait at 8pm would have been at least 90 minutes, so we wound up at the Flamingo. The Flamingo was a nice surprise -- it's not the most modern, but the dining room is clean and airy, and the selection is pretty good. Most people seem to be going to the higher-end buffets, so there wasn't a huge wait here. For dinner, they have a lot of Asian selections, including a build-your-own-bowl-of-ramen bar. We also wound up here for Saturday brunch which includes all-you-can-drink champagne and a bloody mary bar (the first bloody mary is free). If you get seated near the windows, you get a lovely view of the garden with live flamingos and koi pond.

If we were being strategic about our buffet visits, I would have skipped Imperial Palace and planned for either Planet Hollywood (which I have also enjoyed in the past) or Paris. Another buffet that you can visit is the one at Rio, but that would be lower on my list. The food is OK, but it's another room that could use some updating. I mean, seriously, could someone please replace the lightbulbs in that crazy 80's chandelier thing?

For $50, you get access to multiple buffets at hotels on and around the Strip for 24 hours, and you can buy the pass at any of the participating vendors. If you time it right, you can get four meals included: a late dinner on your first night, and breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day. Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.

Despite my above comment, I only visited three of the buffets during my stay. (What can I say? I'm not a big shove-massive-quantities-of-food-in-my-mouth-until-I-feel-sick person.) I ate at the Spice Market Buffet for breakfast, the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio for dinner, and the Paradise Garden Buffet for breakfast the following day. Out of those three, I found the Spice Market to be the best in terms of selection and quality. Although the buffets aren't as nice as the ones at, say, the Wynn of the Bellagio, you can certainly enjoy some nice meals for the price.

I only have one complaint, which is that when we went to Caesar's Palace and asked an attendant where their buffet was, they replied that they did not have one. It was odd since Caesar's Palace was printed right on the bracelet, but being that we didn't have much time before we had to run off to catch our flight, we didn't press the issue before visiting an alternate hotel.

My group and I ate at Rio's Carnival World Buffet, Paris's brunch Le Village Buffet and Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet. The food choice was more or less the same, and we weren't totally hungry since our planning of the buffets wasn't too great. We basically ate dinner five hours after the brunch, and we were not too hungry so we didn't get to stuff our faces like we had planned to.

Flamingo- we cud not visit because, we dt hv much time.

Caesar  palace  - extra bucks for buffet and parking. So we quited .

Rio- same extra price .

I really thought we could do at LEAST three, esp. given that we were within 10 minute walking distance of four of the buffets. I mean..we KILLED it over at the Carnival World Buffet when they had their $24 all day pass. Three meals in 12 hours? NO PROBLEM! *sigh*

I have to say that for those of you who buy the pass, in order to win, you need to:

a) check if the buffet has an Express Line (well worth the additional $10..got into the Rio buffet within 10 minutes as opposed to waiting over 1.5 hrs in line)
b) go during off-hours..either REALLY early in the morning or those weird hours that no one thinks of as meal times (2pm, 4pm, 9pm)

Bacchanal in Caesar's Palace: 1) Who wants to pay extra $25/person on top of what you've already paid for Buffet of Buffets? No!

1. Spice Market at Planet Hollywood
My favorite because of the location, setting, food and convenience. Super cute dessert selection like cotton candy on a stick! Solid prime-rib and surprisingly nommy middle-eastern food. We ate here twice. 

2. Carnival World Buffet at Rio
The food here is probably the best of the seven buffets in terms of selection and quality (especially the Asian station) but gosh! So annoying to get to Rio on foot from the strip, even with the free shuttle from Harrah's to Rio. 

3. Le Village Buffet at Paris
I don't know why this buffet is rated so high, but it was my least favorite by far. The prime rib was tasteless and chewy, the grilled asparagus were like burnt splintery chopsticks, and the marinated mushrooms were SO SALTY that my tongue just about withered up after the first bite.  Everything else was average.  But I do have to say that the décor is the most charming, from the little street lamps and candlelit windows right down to the costumed waitresses. Good for dessert and breakfast but not for anything substantial. 

We didn't bother with the other four, because our stomachs are mortal, and we heard that they weren't that good anyways.

Tips for surviving the onslaught of buffets.
-yes dear, that skinny belt looks great with your fitted top and secondskin jeans but change into the moo-moo tucked in the back of your closet. You're welcome.
-if you are secretly weight-conscious, drink lots of water and start with veggies and soup. You will think that you can just pop in and pick up a light snack but you will always end up eating a large meal and will complain about how much you ate for the next many many hours. Just accept it.
-if you are with the above person, bring headphones.
-if you want to eat as much as you humanly can at every buffet, ease up on the protein; you will be lugging a 20-pound frankenmeat in your tummy for the next 2 days and will be severely constipated 
-if you wanna hit all 7 buffets, prepare to make it an all-day event and get a bus pass to haul you from hotel to hotel.

I'm writing this review based on my 2nd Vegas trip a couple years ago, and I'm sure the price has gone up, but it was amazing! We had a five day pass and got to try all the buffets except one. I had my favorite three but they were all good. The first was Planet Hollywood, which had giant crab legs and gelato, and cotton candy lollipops! Second was the Flamingo buffet, which had a chocolate fountain - need I say more. Third was Paris buffet, which had a lovely French decor, and a crepe station, which I indulged in. My favorite was a decadent strawberry and Nutella crepe! If you want to try a lot of new things, esp sweets, and not worry about meals, it's worth it! But you must have a healthy appetite to fully enjoy it too! Next time I'm in Las Vegas, I hope this is still around.",67MpvghfET1-tISoH59Wag,1,0,5,fF7M0vnf6rsTjmzWXxfZ8Q

We tried the Rio and the Paris buffets, the food at both was incredibly mediocre. It's all about QUANTITY, not QUALITY, and be prepared for line waits of an hour or more to get into the buffets. We attempted to get into the buffet at Planet Hollywood, waited an hour in line just to get downstairs where the buffet was, once allowed downstairs, there was ANOTHER line with a wait of 40-60 minutes more. We gave up. The buffet of buffets is a good choice only if you're doing Vegas on a strict budget or if you don't really care much about the quality of the food you are eating. I was especially disappointed with the seafood. The crab legs were tiny and far too much work. The shrimp were simply boiled, nothing special, and there was not an oyster, clam or mussel in sight. The sushi was garbage too, no sashimi, no nigiri, just a few bland tuna and salmon rolls. I would never do this again and would warn others to think twice about it. Huge waste of time for terrible meals. My advice would be to save a little extra for your trip and eat at some of the decent restaurants and cafes found throughout Vegas. It will be well worth the extra expense.",h-gZ_DuR6JWs1nFxB7OwSA,0,0,2,4cDQTKJgXoy4pVxUQuIbUA

The 24 hour window begins when you first purchase the pass at whichever buffet you start off at. If you start at dinner, you can fit in dinner, breakfast, lunch, and then dinner again, if you are really dedicated. We bought the pass at 6:45 p.m. (after waiting in line for awhile), so you could easily fit in an early dinner the next night within the 24 hour window. 

We had dinner at Spices in Planet Hollywood and breakfast and lunch (at 3 p.m.) at Le Village in Paris. I enjoyed breakfast at Paris so much that I returned for lunch. Since it was a holiday week/weekend, the champagne brunch at Paris was $30 for Total Rewards members if you didn't get the 24 hour pass.

5746686,2011-03-16,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"If you don't mind centering 24-hours around okay-quality buffets, then this is for you.  It's a great price for a lot of food, depending on if you were planning on spending that much on food anyway. The quality isn't great, but the variety and excitement of trying different buffets is fun.

3 buffets during the 24-hour period is definitely doable and very realistic.  We chose to do dinner at the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio (8 pm Friday night w/ short line), breakfast at Paris (about 40 minutes wait at 11 am Saturday morning), and dinner at Planet Hollywood (no wait at 6 pm on Saturday night...though a HUGE line formed at 7 pm).  3 buffets was the perfect amount, since more would be too much food and too much time going from one hotel to another and waiting in line.  Granted our lines weren't too long this past weekend, I can't imagine doing more than this many buffets on a busy weekend.  

TIP: Go to the buffet you're looking forward to the most FIRST, and the one you're not as excited about last.  Do one good buffet for dinner, and the other one for breakfast/lunch.  Your last buffet definitely won't taste as good or be as exciting after all the gorging and excitement from the first couple you go to.

We decided to do the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio first, since I love seafood and was looking forward to that.  I parked in the Masquerade parking lot of the Rio, which lead directly to the buffet on the first floor.  We went and got our Total Rewards card first (which was a 20 minute line on a Friday night in March, this past weekend). It wasn't a far walk from the buffet.  Just a few minutes into the casino and you'll see signs.

Once we got our card, we got in line to the buffet.  Since the Village Seafood was new to the Buffet of Buffets, I asked to make sure we could buy our Buffet of Buffets there.  And sure enough, we could.  They used our Total Rewards card as the buffet card and gave us a receipt to put on our table while we eat there and hold on later to in case for some reason the card doesn't work.  Make sure to take the receipt off your table when you leave the buffet.  It has the Buffet of Buffets listed on there.

Of the 3 buffets we went to, Paris was my favorite for breakfast and lunch.  Here are the good and maybe unique things I noticed about each.

Village Seafood Buffet at Rio: (8 pm, Friday night - 10 min wait)
(2 stars - not that much unique food, and only worth it if you're okay with the following and really craving it)
- small halves of lobster tails
- warm plump shrimp in lobster tail mix
- oysters (frozen and thawed)
- crab claws (not fresh and kinda mushy)
- cold crab legs (though most buffets have this)

Le Village at Paris: (11 am, Saturday morning - 45 min wait)
(4 stars - LOTS of variety for breakfast and lunch)
- sweet crepes made to order (though they used preserves instead of fresh berries)
- omelets made to order (VERY nice guy serving us at this station)
- lox (Make your own bagel, cream cheese, and smoked salmon lox! I LOVED this and wish I got it first.
- small Mediterranean section
- lunch food served along with breakfast (breakfast is served until 3 pm, they said) 

Planet Hollywood: (6 pm, Saturday night - no wait...LONG line at 7 pm!)
(3 stars - nothing special or too unique, but good variety of food)
- Mediterranean, American, Mexican, Italian, Asian foods
- chocolate-covered strawberries (load up on these whenever you see them because they go quick; taste like fondue chocolate though and not real melted quality chocolate)
- good variety of food, though most sections were small and didn't have a lot of different foods
*PH was a PAIN to find. The parking lot is over on the side and also behind on the street parallel to LV Blvd. You can't get in from LV Bvld, so don't waste your time like we did.  THEN, we had to walk through mall about 5 minutes to get to the casino.  What a pain!  Maybe I missed it, but access to PH made me never want to go there again by car.

If I had this to do over again, I think I might not even get this Buffet of Buffets card, unless I want lots of food and don't care too much about quality.  I apparently tried the 3 that had the highest ratings and wasn't impressed with any of them except the Paris buffet.  

I think I might just fork out the extra cash and do either the Bellagio or Wynn buffets, which I heard great things about.  They're about $50 each though.  And definitely I would do the Paris for breakfast/lunch again.  Those two would probably add up to a bit more than what I spent on the Buffet of Buffets card with the Village Seafood added (about $60 total, with Total Rewards card).  

I think I'd rather spend more on quality over quantity. Plus, it was a bit of a pain scheduling our day around driving to the hotels and waiting in line for buffets. I think you may do that anyway, but with this card, you have to time it right to get in your money's worth for the 24-hour period, especially if you wanna do more than 3 buffets.",hxFuK5yfhvXTutTF76QtUQ,3,0,4,vvdiAWbXK6GCTlAUJOQNZg

Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat. It was seven hotels to be exact, actually, as they were on mission to complete...  *insert deep, booming voice* THE BUFFET OF BUFFETS!!!

And complete it they did! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ?select=cicuGUx9tyF5o88Ykc_0uA
I write today to tell the tale of the 3 bunnies' eating adventure on Easter weekend 2011.   

* SATURDAY *

Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo) - 12:50pm
- Officially got our wristband passes here + thus began the adventure. Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      

Lago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm
- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn't  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    

Le Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm
-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, crème brûlée, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  

The Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm
- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! 


* SUNDAY *

Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am
- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  

Flavors, The Buffet (Harrah's) - 11:30am
- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)

Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm
- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the ""Asian noodles"" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don't waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  

*****

Strategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). 

Priced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us 

   $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) 
+ $48 (1 extra BofB pass)
----------
   $261  

Split between 3 girls... that's DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn't a big deal.

And then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!",6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ,29,17,4,r24i26pf_Gd4--lu7WWNPQ

5850312,2014-11-12,6,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"I have been buying the Buffet of Buffet pass my every Las Vegas visit (2-3 times a year) for past couple of years, so guess I have developed some experience to share here. 
During my first couple of visits, I have been taking it as ""ROOM & BUFFET PACKAGES"" which included 2 buffet passes if you stayed at one of TR hotels in Vegas. This experience was disappointing for one reason: the Total Rewards staff in different properties (and sometimes even within one property) do not have the same information about their businesses and services. So if one person tells you one thing in one place, another person in a different place can tell you directly the opposite. Let me give you an example. When I booked my room for the first time with this package I called to my hotel (Bally's) to verify that I'm getting exactly 2 Buffet of buffet passes during my 3 days stay. The lady on the phone confirmed it. I went to Vegas, and at the Check-in another lady told me that I have only one buffet pass. I said that on the web-site it clearly says that ""Stay two nights or more with us and receive two complimentary Buffet of Buffets passes"". She confirmed it, and said that I'm getting two passes but I must use them at once (so I was suppose to be with a friend to use them both). It was disappointing... when I went to one of the buffets, I talked to a lady at the desk, and she said, that I can use both passes at different time and I should just ignore what the other lady at the Check-in said. So during that stay I ended up using both passes for myself and everything was fine. The next time I visited Las Vegas with a friend, and she was staying at the Harrah's and I was at Bally's again. We both had the 2 complementary passes. In my case at Bally's I already knew how to act and they didn't charge me anything for using both passes at different time, but in case of my friend at Harrah's, they'd charged her extra $50 for using both two passes. So at her check-out, I had to go to her hotel and talk with their staff to convince them that she could use her passes at different time. After about 30 minutes of arguing and calling the managers, and checking the TR's web-site they got convinced that what it says on the web-site is true, and we could use both of our passes. Although each time the situation got resolved in my favor, I still was very disappointed in Total Rewards. I just don't get how can their information be so inconsistent . So, buy the pass separately!

The above information and my disappointment in TR are the reasons I'm deducting 2 points out of my rating, otherwise I would give the Buffet of Buffets straight 5 stars for being the best Buffet pass in Las Vegas. 

Now let me give you some information about the pass itself. 
First of all, it's totally worth it! Withing that 24 hour period that pass works, you can have 4+ meals at any buffet, which makes each meal worth less than $13.

So this 24 hour pass gives you access to 7 buffets. Two of theme will charge you some extra money (from $10 to $25) per visit. Those are Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace and the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio.
The Bacchanal Buffet is a high-end Buffet, with very good food. It's not very large but there are some dishes there, that you won't see in other Buffets (eg. lamb chops). It's worth a visit. 
The other buffet that charges you extra is the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I walked  trough it, and I can't really say that they had anything that seafood sections in other buffets didn't have. So probably it doesn't worth a visit, unless you're really into a seafood.

The other 5 buffets are totally free if you have the pass.
The best food quality you will find at Le Village Buffet at Paris and Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. They both are about the same size, and have about the same food quality with the Le Village Buffet, probably being little ahead. 
I recommend visiting the Le Village Buffet in the morning, because they have fantastic crepe station there, and the entire atmosphere of that buffet will give you an excellent morning mood. Also in the evening they have complementary wine. So probably these two buffets are going to be your main targets if you have the pass. 

The next best food quality would be probably the Carnival World Buffet at Rio. They have very good service in here and the largest food diversity. As a matter of fact, this is the largest buffet in the World! Too bad it's pretty far from the strip.

Then comes the Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo. The food quality is a bit lower than in all other buffets, and in general it looks and feels bit cheaper. But when you will get tired from the lines and crowd at Le Village Buffet and Spice Market Buffet, you will come here and relax. 
I never visited the Flavors buffet at Harah's, but assuming it's the same level or may be even lower than Paradise Garden Buffet. 
Take into consideration that the better is the buffet, the longer are the lines: up to 2 hours, sometimes.",UPbFueJATfY3s07cpUvz0Q,41,8,3,EN4ePqJ016X5ZfXWlGwY_g
5853392,2011-06-28,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"When we came to Vegas last weekend, we made sure to take advantage of the Buffet of Buffets deal. This is a 24 hour pass at a great price to the best buffets on the Strip. We didn't get around as much as we hoped so we only hit up two different buffet restaurants: Paradise Garden at the Flamingo (where we stayed) and Le Village at Paris. We had hoped to go to Lago in Caesar's but we didn't make it.

We had lunch Saturday and Sunday brunch at Paradise Garden and both times the food was great, fresh, and we loved the view onto the Flamingo Habitat.

We had an early dinner at Le Village and all I can say is Bon Appetite! This place was amazing. We would definitely come back.

We'd wanted to try more restaurants, but even at three meals at only two restaurants this deal is worth it.

My girlfriends and I are Total Rewards members so we usually buy our 24hour pass with the TR card for entry.

I've personally only been to the buffet in Planet Hollywood (Spice Market Buffet), Rio (Carnival), and Paris.

The one in Rio I would say provides the most variety, from asian to italian to american. The gelato buffet is my FAVOURITE though - so many flavours and they're all delicious! The desserts are pretty amazing too. 

Planet Hollywood is our default buffet because we usually stay there and when we're hungover in the morning it's so convenient to walk downstairs right into the buffet for a hot breakfast. 

The Caesar's one was my favourite for breakfast before but ever since they renovated and renamed to Bacchanal it costs you an extra $10-$20 on top of your 24hour pass for breakfast/lunch/dinner respectively. I can see why because the buffet offers much more now with so many new stations added. We tried the lunch one and I would say it was justifiable to spend the extra 15$ 

Paris used to be better but they really downgraded the quality of their food. Still not horrible but not the best.

Overall I think there is great value in this buffet program especially if you can fit in 4 meals into the 24 hr window. It works out to be like 13$ per meal and you get appies, mains, and desserts. and even soft drinks! Can't really go wrong for that price.


** note the buffets are not open 24 hours so you would try and time it so that the pass will last you until two meals into the next day.",7DhwmWFGa4Ej9xHUehmFmA,17,5,4,_Z-vWK6VPpDee5oUD5rJEQ

We had lunch at The Flamingo because it was convenient. I wasn't impressed by this buffet. The service was mediocre and the food just so so.  Next time, I'll make sure we're closer to Caesars and try that out.

All you can eat buffet for 24 hours. You can go for dessert, coffee, breakfast, lunch, mid afternoon snack, dinner and more dessert. It is worth it!!!

So you want to know what you get for your pass? Spice Market at Planet Hollywood, La Village at Paris, Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo and Flavors at Harrah's . 

Spice Market at Planet Hollywood: They have a great variety of dishes. This place would be good if you want to enjoy various kinds of foods. 

La Village at Paris: We enjoyed the variety of foods from each province of France. The place is designed like a small tiny village in France. They really do have French food here and we keep coming back here over and over even if we do not have the buffet pass. It is one of our favorite places.

Paradise Garden at Flamingo: They don't have so many kinds of foods.  Their foods are mostly standard American. Quality of each food is fairly high. If you want to have a good American-food buffet, this place is great. They have a large dessert station with good cakes and pastries. They even have sugar-free desserts.   

Flavors' at Harrah's: So many kinds of foods (Mexican, Chinese, Sushi, Italian, etc.) in a large place. Quality of each dish is high. They have many dishes on small plates, which are easy and fun to pick. They also have many kinds of desserts, including gelato and cotton candy other buffets don't offer

Definitely a great deal. If you do not one buffet place, you can always use your pass to go to another.",38eJTQjXi5jNL6e9DOphcQ,0,0,4,23pVAzLnmEHA6Gi7HOYG5Q

We got the pass on Friday morning before 11am to get the week price, and we also got the discount with the Total Rewards card (get it when you get in Vegas!!). 
You basically eat one meal for $20 or less, so don't expect some amazing cuisine, even if it was pretty good! Reading other reviews some people always expect $100 dinners when they pay only $20...

- Friday breakfast : We went to the Harrah's. It was simple but pretty good, we had an American breakfast with pancakes, bacon, fruits, et little desserts. We decided to go there in the morning since we knew they didn't have a lot of choice, but it was plenty for breakfast!

- Friday lunch: Spice Market at the Planet Hollywood. Mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and meat loaf were amazing! They have a lot of choices and pretty good desserts, we were pretty full after that lunch!!

- Friday afternoon: We went back around 5pm to the Harrah's to get some delicious ice creams!

- Friday night: The Paris buffet, Le village, one of my favorite buffet on the strip! Crèpes are so good!! They have a lot of choice, and a lot of desserts!

- Saturday morning... we were back at the Paris for some more crèpes!!

The wait at any of the buffet was like 10minutes maximum, we probably went later than anybody else. It seems like 9.30-9.45am, 2pm and 8.30pm are good time to go!
Very good deal! I recommend it to anybody!!",eiTz0M0ZBiQUMt78GsPYPw,5,1,5,IdBu4wY6rLRov-PAXjCMMg

The pass allows you to eat at any of the seven buffets (located at Paris, Harrahs, Caesars, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, Rio, and Imperial Palace) an unlimited number of times for a 24 hour period. The total, including tax was about $44. If you eat three meals in that 24 hour period, it will average out to under $15 a meal.

For 45.99 with your players card * which you can sign up for on your way in* you'll get 24 hour access to a wide variety of amazing buffets.

Based on all the reviews I read, I decided on Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood.  Be prepared for a lot of time spent waiting in line.  We did our first dinner at the Rio.  It was ok.  The next day we had breakfast at Paris and we waited about 1hr.  Everyone raves about the crepes, but I didnt find them anything to write home about.  Canned pie filling and too heavy dough.  Fake ""whipped cream"" AKA whipped TOPPING.  They could have at least used real cream.  We got there around 10, but didnt get seated until close to 11.  I had one plate of breakfast food and then the buffet switched to lunch and that was pretty good. There was a lot of grilled items, mushrooms, steak, etc.  Our last meal was at PH.  Once again, fine, nothing special.   I'm somewhat of a foodie, so none of these buffets impressed me.  Next time we go to Vegas, I'll stick with Bellagio.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,1,1,4,toIuQMnK3mSGqT-O_OnLCg
5962831,2013-03-18,0,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"24 hours of Gluttony!!  We figured....we're not on a diet so let's go for it!!!  It costed $49.99 each for the pass, and we normally spend more than that in 24 hours on meals when we're in Vegas.

The choices are the buffets at Caesars Palace, Harrah's, Flamingo, Rio, Planet Hollywood, Imperial Palace, and Paris.  We were able to eat at 3 of them.  Planet Hollywood's Spice Market was our first stop for an early lunch.  The food was very good!  Our second stop was at Rio's Carnival World buffet which has always been one of my favorite buffet stops in Vegas.  It still tasted good.  Our last stop before the pass expired was at Caesar Palace's buffet the next day.  It was yummy as well.

Was the Buffet of Buffets worth the price?  Yes, it was.  We would have spent more if we had gone to each place individually.  I must say though, that by the time we ate at the last stop, I was not really hungry anymore.  It was pure gluttony!!  I don't think we'll ever do that again!",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,3,0,4,mNushputdG7Y7pkq7o5IFQ
5971815,2014-11-08,1,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Recommended - it's a neat way to try buffets in 7 locations for up to 24 hours.  They're not the best buffets on the strip, but then the pass is really meant to give you lots of food and selection for a low price.

Some things to watch for:
 - Get the Total Rewards membership (it's free).
 - The $49 price applies during the weekdays only for Total Rewards members.  ($59 if not a member)
 - The $49 deal is weekday oriented, with the price being $65+ on weekends
 - While it's valid for 24 hours, the buffets are really only open from 7am-11pm.
 - Two of the buffets (at Caesar's and Rio) have an extra upcharge on top of the pass.",N1ozXPKgvToSP-Q5bQNmzA,52,1,4,WsWNr3rYXI7OW_cMAqtrvA
5994847,2011-05-23,6,pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ,"Mom visits me from Korea every year and as usual, we went to Vegas.  I don't know why we decided to do this but we did.  I kept questioning our decision...really? Buffet for the next 24 hours?  Holy moly!  Yes, you heard me right; unlimited buffet for 24 hours for $44.99 for Total Rewards members (just go sign up at the total rewards booth) and $49.99 for non-members.   Ugh.

Given my reservations, this was not a bad idea.  It's definitely worth the money given that one buffet meal would have cost us about $18-$30.  So how many times could we squeeze in buffet trips in the given time without wanting to puke?  I'd say about 4 times MAX.

-Meal 1: Spice Market Buffet @PH.  This was where we started.  We had dinner here.  Overall, this was my favorite buffet of the trip.  They have different themed sections marked clearly with bold white lettering...ie. Mexican, Seafood, Mid-Easter, dessert, etc.  I gorged myself on pre-halved crab legs and pre-peeled shrimp cocktail.  My husband loved the cotton candy and the crème brulee was yummy too.  4 stars

-Meal 2 : Spice Market Buffet.  Since we were staying at PH we decided to come here for a quick breakfast before we set out for the day.  Breakfast was simple and standard.  The eggs were good and the OJ refreshing...and the coffee saved my life.

-Meal 3 : Le Village Buffet @ Paris.  The line was short here but for some reason we had to wait for 45 minutes!  The food was French-ish and quite mediocre.  I must say that I do like the ambiance.  It succeeds in taking me away to some sort of quaint rustic town.  3 stars

-Meal 4 : Lago Buffet @ Caesars Palace.  Once again, the line was ridiculously slow.  We had tickets to the Cirque Du Soleil LOVE show and we almost had to skip dinner after waiting in line for an hour!  Fortunately, we spoke to one of the managers and she let us slide up front.  Thank you! Thank you!  Lago had the smallest selection of them all.  It was teeny tiny with minimum seating!  The saving factor of this place is the quality of the food.  It was the best of the three I visited, however limited.  The prime rib was restaurant quality and delicious.  I would come back just for that.  3 stars

I enjoyed my Buffet of Buffets experience.  I don't think I'll do it again but it was definitely worth its while.  Besides, we had a good time hopping from buffet to buffet as if we were on a little mission.   But please factor in the lines when you're visiting these buffets.  They are no joke.",doK5Bf6OLlu2GdjL7x1_HQ,10,6,4,RZJqxdz77ClgCODRSH0XmQ
