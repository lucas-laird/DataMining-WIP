32133,2010-12-29,0,rdZ6xVABSoOVeAIiCaEj4w,"I was really hoping to like this place for my AYCE sushi since it's close to home and the reviews seem decent (although there aren't many of them)...but I'm sad to say I won't be coming back again.

There were 2 items that I liked, ahi poke and the baked green mussels.  I thought the ahi poke was presented really well and I enjoyed the crunch that the chips provided.  I probably should have ordered 2 of them and forget all the unmemorable rolls we got....but it was my first time here and I wanted to try everything.  The mussels were good too, but if you slather enough yum yum sauce on anything, it'll probably be good so it might not be saying much.

As for the rolls, to be honest, I couldn't tell them apart once they reached the table.  Everything looked the same and shared many of the same ingredients.  All 6 of us agreed that all the crunchy fried rolls were not very good....it was fried so you couldn't really taste the fish inside to tell what kind of fish it was or whether it was even fresh.  As for the other rolls, they were just ok.  I wish they had told us or advertise how many pieces a roll came in because we all assumed the usual 8 pieces.  By the end, we were trying very hard to finish all our food.

As for the nigiri, I only tried the salmon and tuna.  They were ok, not bad and not that fresh.

The service was ok.  There was only one waitress and I thought she was fine but I can see why the others in my party did not think she was very helpful.  My brother thought she seemed kind of pushy in having us order everything at the beginning so she didn't have to come back.  Usually we do order little by little during AYCE so we don't over-order, but she had us order a lot and only came back to take our dessert order.  Also she missed one of my orders.  I only know she did because it was the only half order of a roll that I selected and everything that came was way too big to be half an order.  I didn't bother to speak up about it because I was kind of glad she did forget it, I was tired of eating mediocre rolls.",sEx1Ua3yNjxBdJ_vJ9amfA,1,0,2,jqIcUC3Tqh2MYPeSaiHtZg
38714,2008-07-10,0,rdZ6xVABSoOVeAIiCaEj4w,"This place is HORRIBLE! I wish I could give it 0 stars, as that's what it deserves. I've tried numerous sushi places in Vegas and this takes the cake as the absolute worst. 

We visited for all you can eat dinner and ordered our drinks. The waitress brought us our drinks and disappeared. The Diet Coke was almost entirely syrup and the water had a awkward taste. Still, since that's somewhat common, we attempted to order food and enjoy the meal. Each of us (3 people) ordered rolls and some edamame and waited...and waited and waited some more. After 50 minutes they had brought us ONE roll. Should have known to leave right there, but we were trying to be kind (as they seemed understaffed) so we pressed on.

About 20 minutes later most of our rolls had come and the only way to describe them was mediocre; the shrimp was tough, spicy tuna had an odd texture / wasn't spicy at all and the crab in the Cali rolls tasted old. Again, we should have left but my friends didn't really want to cause a scene.

Finally (after 80 minutes) the final dish of our first order came out, something with beef. Anticipating some sort of Kobe Beef roll (think Roys) we dug in, but the meat was obviously burnt and overpowered the rest of the roll. The waitress finally came back and while we were deciding whether or not to try and order more, we asked her to take away the roll. She simply said ""I won't"" and walked away. Confused, I demanded she take the plate away as it was crowding the table. She informed me that we hadn't eaten the whole thing and were violating the all you can eat rules. Now while I am aware of those rules (very common) they are there to prevent people from being wasteful, not to force your customers to eat horribly prepared food. 
The sushi chef attempted to tell us that ""since it was our first time he would ignore it"" but this was the last straw. I informed him that there wouldn't be a next time because his food was horrible and his service was rude.

Brian's Beach is still on my top places to eat sushi. That being said the rolls are O-SO-Satisfying. They do half orders on most rolls so hey that is a plus to me. I say the more you try the more your out for an adventure through sushi land. Triple S is my all time favorite roll! If you like a kick in your sushi you must try the Almost Fire Roll and if you feel you need to try something out of the ordinary the Twist octopus roll is your way to go. 

I highly recommend eating AYCE if your a sushi eater and love to take your adventure of your taste buds of sushi to the next level. Lunch is $21.95 and Dinner is $25.95. It is totally worth your money...trust me!

I went here for my first time in 2008 and the dessert was AYCE. I came here again last month and they changed it. You can only order one dessert selection - either ice cream or mochi. :( What if I wanted one of each? It is suppose to be AYCE, right?

I was close to giving this place two stars but I reconsidered because not everything was that bad...I think.

The bf called in our order for pick-up and the lady told us it would be ready in 20 minutes. So we said great, sat back, put a movie in and 21 minutes later we were on our way to pick up the order. The bf got there, paid, I sat in the car, and waited. And waited....and waited. Mind you I was sitting in the car right in front of the place, and I pretty much could see a lot of things going on in the restaurant-- including our food being made by the sushi chefs, boxing it up, and handing it to my guy. So after waiting an additional 10 minutes, we finally headed home to feast on our dinner. We ended up ordering the sushi dinner which came with nine pieces of sushi and eight pieces of CA rolls, and miso soup.

The good: eel, salmon,California rolls, and most certainly the miso soup ( it was hot and yummy, probably the best part of the meal) 
The bad: avocado in the rolls were not fresh and very mushy. 
The ugly: speaking of mushy, I can't even begin to describe how bad one of the sushi was. It def wasn't fresh, it smelled funky, and when i swallowed it, I felt nauseous. 

So would I go back? Yes, maybe not for a while though. I have been to this place numerous times before but don't remember much about the experience so i could def give it another shot regardless of how bad that piece of fish was. Although I do think that it was pointless to call an order in for a pick-up just to find out that they make it when you get there. Maybe they have trust issues? Thinking one client might not pick up their order? Or because it's sushi and they have to make it right then and there? Whatever it is, I'm not going hold it against them, I'll just probably dine in next time.",kDUoBp9SgJSeS7-5443k5A,2,0,3,fuFScHCQ0mRQ7hcWPnm8jg

Brian Beach Sushi does 1/2 rolls if you want to try a variety, however, I usually do the full roll because 1/2 is just not enough for me. 

The place is a little smaller and intimate, so if you come on a busy night, be ready to wait a little while. But it is so worth the wait. SIGH why not open up one in the bay area cali =p",v3CW8CedzE0tjLUykeY6lg,1,0,5,kZnfqXHnfMFWRCMihAZ0cQ

The service was awesome. The two servers stay on top of taking orders and clearing the plates and keeping the refreshments flowing. The only down fall would be the ice tea.

The clouds gliding swiftly across the blue, as if they were sliding on a pristine sheet of ice.   Is there anything more tranquil and wonderful than a relaxing afternoon at a white sand beach?  

While the only thing close to a beach you'll find at Brian's Beach Sushi is the sandy-colored walls and some beach-themed decor, and the fish I guess, you'll leave feeling just as satisfied as if you spent a day at that perfect ocean paradise.  

For $27, you can enjoy the AYCE dinner menu.  This includes much more than your average AYCE menu.  The Towering Tuna Poke for example, is a generous and impressive way to start the meal.  The fried garlic chips that accompanies the tuna in this dish adds a masterfully delicious note to an already wonderful flavor profile. 

We also had the Gyoza which was lightly crisp and flavorful without swimming in oil.  Definitely give these delectable dumplings a go.  

The roll selection is vast and creative, more so than many other AYCE places in the valley.  Everything I ordered was fresh and prepared with a careful hand.  The freshwater eel and the red snapper nigiri were so great, I'm drooling a bit just thinking about them.  (Not really......ok maybe a little)  


The best thing about Brian's Beach Sushi is the relaxed, ""beach"" attitude from the staff.  We were told to take our time when eating, offered recommendations, and that if we left a little bit of food on the plate, it's no big deal.

A lot of my friends rave about Brian's Beach AYCE and even some say this place is better than other sushi spots (ie. Sushi Kaya, Oyshi, Yama Sushi). In my opinion, Brian's beach SUFFICED. The highlights for me were Towering Tuna Poke, Baked green muscles, and Gyoza as appetizers. Maybe Shumai too. As for rolls, Big B roll (shrimp tempura, crabmeat, avocado and thin sliced beef), SSS roll (Shrimp tempura & spicy shrimp roll wrapped with shrimp), SC7 roll (forgot what was it it but was good haha), and Tiger Roll. These would be my repeating orders anytime I come back.

Tried to be daring and try other items that I havent heard of, ""Paina Roll"" (breaded deep-fried tuna, salmon, shrimp & cream cheese) was one of them. DO NOT ORDER THAT. Hella breaded! Tasted like a shrimp donut like haha. 

They have typical desserts on the menu... ice cream, mochi..but one of them caught my attention, ""Homemade Tofu Cheesecake!"" Tofu & cheesecake? Had to try it. I don't know how to explain it. You can definitely taste the texture from the tofu and taste the hint creaminess from the cheesecake. Honestly, not my cup of tea. The taste was bland.

After waiting what seemed like 25 minutes or so (prob. the baked roll), I went home in eager anticipation to taste the food.

In contrast, Hikari has a limited overall menu, but have sashimi (and its AYCE). The bfriend and I are more of a sashimi type of people, but I figured, I really liked the idea of variety and choices so we opted to go to Brian's. We were hoping that the variety will be tasteful and has quality that it will justified our decision. 

We came in, and I knew exactly what to order for appetizers-- all the recommended items from other reviewers, of course (i.e. Seared Tuna Carpacio, Ahi Poke, Sashimi Roll, Green Mussels, Deep Fried Oyster, and etc)! Tried them, and honestly, none stood out; none was soo tasty that I would crave for it once I leave. In addition, we ordered 2 specialty rolls and 1 deep fried roll, and none of them were memorable. We also ordered sushi-- it was okay; it just didn't hit the spot. 

Brian's Beach Sushi is the place for you if you are a roll person. This place has an extensive list of Specialty Rolls, Shrimp Tempura Rolls, Soft Shell Crab Rolls, and Deep Fried/Baked Rolls. If you are a sashimi person, then you should go elsewhere (Hikari). The appetizer lists was decent, but none made an impression on me. But they might for you.

I'm from San Francisco and the even the fish over there does not compare to the freshness, the combination of flavors and textures used in the rolls Brian's Beach serves.  Brian (the owner) and Hiroshi are always there with huge welcoming smiles and working their butts off to prepare the most amazing sushi you will ever taste.

AYCE is most definitely the way to go, for you will get your money's worth.  Only $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner which includes the entire sushi menu, appetizers, and dessert.  In the past I've calculated what I would have to pay for each order if I paid for each individually, and on average I would have had to spend well over $70 to $80.  AYCE is truly an amazing deal for the quality (and quantity for that matter) of sushi you get.

My personal favorites are the Seared Tuna Carpaccio, the SSS Roll, The Ponzio Roll (made in memory of my boyfriend who passed away in 2007 and who was a frequent customer), the Ninja Roll, Tuna Poke Tower, and ultimately, their albacore sushi.  The most amazing albacore I've ever eaten and now use this as a basis for comparison whenever I dine at other sushi restaurants.

The best part about Brian's Beach is that it's success is entirely by word-of-mouth.  It has never appeared on ""The Best of Las Vegas"" lists, nor the Vegas Weekly and I believe it is better off that way, as it is a small, family-owned business that is always frequented by a loyal following and does not need to be tainted by the glitz and glamour of typical Las Vegas big-named restaurants.

At first glance i wasnt sure this was going to turn out good. There's a huge commercial sized dumpster almost blocking the front of the place so from an approaching angle all you see is the dumpster. The dumpster belonged to the hydroponics place next door.

The AYCE for dinner was 25.95, tea was included as well as some limited ice cream or mochi.

I thought the menu was a bit limited compared to other AYCE sushi joints but the size of the place and having only a handful of staff it made sense to keep the menu to winners only.

Anything that had slices of green onions i either took off or requested they not top off with, mainly for the reason that the green onions werent fresh, they were dry and a bit wilted. 

One big disappointment is their lack of a seared tuna dish. I asked and the waitress kind of understood where i was going and brought back what she took as 'cajun albacore' pretty much lightly seasoned albacore sashimi on rice with ponzu sauce poured over it. Nothing like i was expecting so i stopped asking.

The Dynamite they did a great job on. Possibly the best i've had in vegas so far. My buddy ordered it i tried a few pieces and it was pretty...dynamite...

The sushi bar was full and it semeed like everyone really enjoyed the atmosphere (myself included).  I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special which comes with: miso soup, white rice, pasta salad, potato salad, 8 pieces of California Roll, regular salad, and of course the teriyaki chicken.  For 7.95.  Holy crazy, Batman, that's a good deal.

The miso soup came out first and was good.  The tofu cubes were exceptionally delicious.  I let it cool some since it came out steaming and I like to keep some of my taste buds.  After that was the main dish -- and was it HUGE.  The chicken was good, regular salad was really good, but what really sold me was how amazing the California Roll and pasta salad were.

Okay okay, I know -- ""California Roll is not REAL sushi"" -- and most places I don't bother ordering it... But here I would make an exception.  It was so ... CREAMY!  That should not describe sushi, but it does!  It just melted in your mouth and sent you to beach sushi heaven.  Same with the pasta salad.  I was like, ""Oh, I'll try this,"" and then I was like, ""WHY CAN'T I STOP EATING IT?""  They put something awesome in their food.

With that said they have THE WORST SERVICE OF ANY RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

I haven't reviewed them until now because I am torn about what to say. It is one of my favorite places to eat, because I value the quality of the food over the service. But, every time I go I leave angry just because of how rude or inattentive they are! But I keep coming back because of the food...

I've recently been going to other places because all the waiters at Brians Beach will try to steal from you regarding their tip. One time I had a table of four people and they added 20% tip, I didn't notice so I ended up tipping on top of that which was a lot of extra money! Another time they added the twenty percent on top of my tax, which is definately illegal! I tried to correct them... But they said thats how they do it.....

Another time they added the tip to my bill unmarked to try and get me to tip on top of it..... Moral of the story ALWAYS CAREFULLY CHECK YOUR BILL WITH THESE PEOPLE.

I wish I could give them two reviews.

2358487,2011-04-20,1,rdZ6xVABSoOVeAIiCaEj4w,"Does anyone know the difference between fresh quality sushi? Perhaps, everyone is settling for a quality of AYCE sushi in Las Vegas that is redundant to a fishy pallet who thinks that is what they should call a Fresh fish. 

Raving reviews of this place and my verdict is OK! Quality was kind of disappointing! Some nigiri's were fresh, but most were fishy. A sushi chef in Japan once said, ""Nigiri and salmon roe is not supposed to taste fishy, but fresh and soft like butter! When it is fishy, it has been sitting around for a while""

The ORDER:

Appetizers:
Shrimp Tempura - this was good.  It was crispy and no excess oil in sight.

Fried Gyoza - It was a little soggy.

Tuna Carpacio - One of my favorites, although too much sauce but all the flavors were just right for me to click...Like

Poki - I did not like this at all. I appreciate the architectural tri-level presentation but the taste was too much tomatoes and lacked the taste of poki tuna which left my mouth asking...is this pico de gallo? 

Sesame Chicken - Not bad. Crispy on the outside but a little chewy in the middle. I am not sure if I really like it or if I am just interested in the contrasting texture.

Baked Muscles - I agree with an existing review that I recently read it is way too much mayo sauce.

Nigiri:
We paid for the dinner price during lunch price so we can have the uni, ameibi and toro. No luck just like all AYCE venues, they are always out of TORO! 

Salmon - Good and fresh.

Yellowtail - it was fishy...dislike!

Tuna - This was good. 

White Tuna - 1st order.... it came with the sauce (which bothers me because I like to taste the freshness of my fish and I wondered why it looked a little pink for a white tuna). So I ordered another without the sauce and it looked & tasted like their fishy yellow tail. Isn't White Tuna supposed to be white?? 

Uni - not bad.

Ameibi - This was sweet and tasty.

Red snapper - I requested with jalapeno on top. At first they forgot to give me the order and then when I had it...I kind of regretted the order.  Snapper was dry and chewy. Pepper was small and wrinkled.

Fried Shrimp head - all shrimp heads taste the same so this was good! 

Rolls:
Dragon Roll - I am not into rolls, so I can say it was OK.

NOTES: There were a lot of rice on the Nigiris and allow me to provide a picturesque description. The rice looked like the back of miniature Uhaul Truck....rectangular, thick and boxy!    

Would I come back here? As I have mentioned before, I am always in a challenge to seek for the AYCE sushi that is better than Xtreme Sushi...I always enjoy the fresh quality and small rice of nigiris at Xtreme Sushi and still haven't met it's match or better!

The salmon was sooo good! it was like butter melting on my hot frying pan of an tongue.  Scallop was intersting taste and texture.  Uni is always yummy.  Halibut, imo, tastes better cooked.   

They do, however, limit the amount of uni and sweet shrimp to about 1 per person.  For the first time trying out Uni, I thought it was interesting.  For the sweet shrimp, have the head fried, it's soooooooo good, way better than the shrimp itself haha.

They have a good selection of rolls, fried/snow crab/regular/handroll/special/ and something else I forgot.  I think the only roll I didn't like was the one with Calamari in it, too much sauce and it didn't mesh well.  

From the app list, we had the seaweed salad (yummy non-typical tasting seaweed salad), cucumber salad, beef teriyaki, salmon poki (not that much salmon, but still good) and the baked mussels (really well done).

The common problems with AYCE is the fish is either cheap, they limit the time and then serve too slow or to make the price affordable all they give you is rice.  But since I am in the land of buffets and AYCEs I would give sushi another try for All-you-can eat.

Brian's Beach was the first on my list based on you lovely YELPers and a couple of other random sites I checked.  The restaurant is pretty small with a couple of tables and a curved sushi bar.  Seating is quick and food comes out FAST!!  You can order ANYTHING on the menu for all you can eat including interesting appetizers and desserts.

The menu is not huge by sushi bar standards but is isn't too shabby either. Gems include Tuna Poke, Gyoza (dumplings), and standard fish (tuna, salmon, yellow tail), the sweet shrimp (with deep fried head) was tasty and the head was fried perfectly.  The items I haven't enjoyed have been Uni (sea urchin) tasted way too fishy and squid (way too chewy).  The rolls as a whole were not that great.  Some had WAY too much rice and there wasn't a huge selection.  Dessert was OK just your standard mochi, ice cream or cheesecake.  Be aware there is a charge if you leave 3 or more pieces left on your plate (not too unreasonable).

Why 3 stars you may ask... well I would have given it 2.5 but that isn't a feature to yelp.  I wrote this review based on two visits to this restaurant.  It wasn't bad the price was OK and the service was quick.  The problem I ran into (which haunts all AYCE places) is the amount of rice.  As for my issues with the Uni... buyer beware when it comes to high end fish at low prices... that and I am an Uni snob.

BB's lunch menu is just a little less costly than SM's. Both places do all you can eat. 

I believe dinner was $26 for AYCE. I calculate that I can eat roughly $52 worth of ala carte, so AYCE is most definitely the way to go ... for myself. 

Bf and I (aka the Power Eaters) began with three orders each of the hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon) and two of the hirame (halibut) with shiso (Japanese mint). The nigiri were all smaller than I'm used to. But this was totally a good thing because taste great, less filling! The hamachi and sake were both tasty, but lacked body; a little bit too much give in the texture of the fish. The same goes for the hirame. Although for the hirame, that wasn't a bad thing. I'm used to getting really stringy hirame. For the record, I'm not well versed in hirame and don't know the mark of good quality for hirame. I just know what I like. 

Normally, I would say smaller portions is the devil, but for AYCE, the opposite is true. Smaller portions are less filling, thus more variety is possible. Brian's Beach is good for this reason. You can order half rolls of most anything, save the soft shell crab rolls. 

Phase II, the gaijin rolls. We got Sam's Volcano, Almost Fire, and Kimmy rolls. All good. We also tried the baked green mussels. One order is five pieces. That shit should be illegal. 

Phase III, we also ordered the white tuna, which I thought was amazing, but bf thought it was just decent; ikura (salmon roe) with quail egg; saba (mackerel); 

They have Sapporo and Asahi, sake, and a few wines on hand. 

The place is small, prolly just big enough to accommodate 20 heads. 

The service was great and our sushi chef was very available. 

I ordered the Homemade Tofu Cheesecake, but it ""wasn't hard yet"" (It ain't easy), so I defaulted to green tea ice cream. 

I'd say I've found my southside sushi mistress. 

I think fresh fish in Las Vegas can be such an inconsistent thing that to fairly review a sushi joint (just in the realm of QUALITY OF FISH), you need to go back a few times. So I'll be back. A few times. 

Next time I'll ask for toro (fatty tuna, the bacon of sushi). 

I always get hungry when I write sushi joint reviews. Yelp will be the death of me. Death by Yelp ...

I went in around 8:00 pm and they only had 5 people at the bar with 2 sushi chefs and 1 server.  they had all this open table but the server only gave me the smallest table they could find since i was only 1 person.  it was my first time there so i did not know if the service would be fast or slow? so I ordered as much as i could at that particular time..  

First I started with the apps which was:
fried oysters which was too much panko and the oyster its self was small so all I could taste was the breading and not the oyster.

Poki Salad: I thought it tasted like salsa and not poki.. but then again Poke means cubed in hawaiian so I let that go.  I did however think that they did skimp on the tuna coz I couldn't even taste any tuna in there.

for sushi I ordered:
Tuna - it was the frozen kind

Yellow tail which was good since they served me the belly part.

Salmon - It was good 

Red Snapper - It wasn't snapper.  It was Talapia.  I asked the server if it was Snapper or Talapia and he told me that it was snapper.  so I ordered it.  then came out Talapia. 

Unagi (Eel) - it was bad to the point that it was spoiled. I put it in my mouth and then I spit it out.  I told the server that it was spoiled and all he said was "" so you didn't like it"".  No one even came to me to appologize.

Octopus - Chewy and warm

Squid - good but not great

Tamago - sold out which says that the chefs are lazy at that restaurant. since egg is the cheapest and one of the more important netta at a sushi bar since that determines the quality of the restaurant.

Tekka maki - no flavor.

Natto - warm and no taste.

the one bright spot for the meal was the sushi rice was made very good.  not too mushy and not too hard.  Since the rice is the most important  ingredient to sushi.  because Sushi means "" Vinegared Rice"".  

I'm sorry but I do not think I will be back to this restaurant every again.

Whoa! This place is quaintly situated inside of an unassuming little shopping center. I came her upon recommendation from a friend who said it was their ""favorite AYCE"" sushi place.

On this particular Monday afternoon, Chef Brian was there to serve up some of his sushi creations. OMG! Talk about a RICE overload! I've never seen so many rolls with sooo much rice. Don't get me wrong, I love rice more than most people (it may be cultural, no doubt) but they just got carried away with it! My date and I found ourselves asking for ""light rice"" rolls (which they didn't really accommodate), as it just got to be overwhelming. They use of eel sauce got to be a bit cloying, and sashimi was conspicuously missing from the AYCE menu. Hmmm!

We looked behind the sushi bar and saw the culprit right there in plain view: the world's LARGEST rice cooker. It looked more like the cement mixer they may have used while constructing the City Center property. Brian decided it would serve a loftier purpose for over-ricing the masses @ his quaint little sushi bar. Really, Brian?! Is THAT much rice REALLY necessary?! 

Perhaps it was (saves money on fish!). The fish wasn't the freshest in the world despite the fact that we were dining right ON the beach (Brian's beach, that is). 

Honestly, the whole ""beach"" theme began and ended with a large plastic fish that was hung on the wall that looked more like an anatomy chart of how to identify a FRESH fish (sorry, but I'm thinking they may have needed to re-read the wall didactic). 


All in all I was pretty disappointed by my rice overkill sushi. The hot sake was a great deal, though, and it was pretty darn delicious The servers and Brian were all VERY friendly as well. I really loved the service here, actually.


And now I will leave you with a song (as sung to the tune of Vanilla Ice's ""Ice, Ice, Baby!"")

Alright stop: collaborate and listen! Rice is back because Brian went fishin'. He decided to make some sushi rolls, but I'll tell you one thing the rice is outtta control.....Rice,  Rice Baby!


p.s. Best items on the menu: seared tuna carpaccio (nix the mayo), Ahi poke stack, and--of course--the Hot Sake!!",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,2,0,3,cKYwo9_VDrKOeylTeX0L5A

However, this place is my all time favor. Every time I go to Vegas, I will definitely make visit to this place. 

It was located off stripe and the drive is a bit far, but this place is worth the drive. Place is small, but always clean and provide great services. 

The food is at order as you go basis. They only make the food when you order it, which makes the food fresh and tasty (Unlike Todai.. yack). Also, usually I will think all-you-can-eat restaurant will like to stuff you with lots rice, but this place has proportional amount of rice. 

They also have a great selection of choice for you to order. Usually I do all-u-can-eat menu for only $25. I have referral many friends to go and they all love the food and environment. $25 for nearly a hundred choice? Cannot beat that!

Make sure to order:

Appetizers
Tuna Pokies
Carpaccio
Baked Mussel (takes awhile but it's fresh baked)
Seaweed Salad

Roll:
Big B and Big D roll
Hand roll
Saba

Dessert
Mochi ice cream (it usually runs about $2 per a piece in market)
Green Tea Ice Cream

I will highly recommend this place to anyone!",H5bXCqtNcwXMHM1TFkwe2Q,3,3,5,0FefcU0lJJ1r8aVXRNkyng
4669631,2010-03-20,1,rdZ6xVABSoOVeAIiCaEj4w,"I felt like I was at a tofu restaurant, not a sushi restaurant. 

Food:
The sushi seriously tasted like tofu, no  flavor. I probably tasted more of the rice, than the sushi. Maybe my taste buds were really really REALLY off that day, but I doubt it. No toro that day. Uni was decent.  The saving grace about this place was the non-sushi items like shrimp heads, oysters, gyoza, and dynamite. The most interesting meal of the day was the tofu cheesecake. Trying to cram an unhealthy cheesecake into a healthy food like tofu just boggles the mind. Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.

Service:
No complaints here, just nothing stood out. Felt like I just went there, order got my food, ate it, paid, and left. Didn't get the same good vibe from the staff like I did at Naked Fish, Raku, Hikari, or Sushi-Mon.

Price:
$22 for lunch from 11:30am - 4pm, $26 for dinner 4pm - 11:30pm. This is the going rate for AYCE sushi in town. If you're coming for lunch, you can pay for dinner price to get the Uni and sweet shrimp + shrimp heads. Worth the extra $4.

So if you don't like sushi, but want Japanese food come, to brian's beach SUSHI. Otherwise, go to Hikari or Sushi-Mon instead, they aren't too far away.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,2,1,2,XwvC4pHLRES9NV4SJ4IQ2w

presentation  - good
atmosphere  - poor
taste  - good

This WAS one of our favorite places to go. My boyfriend and I went pretty often to where they actually knew our faces. Last Saturday we went and brought three friends with us. Long story short- they handed me a plate of food at the bar my boyfriend and I where sitting where the corner of the bar turns. I offered my friends to my left a roll, as they where still talking to me I went to set my plate down and I thought I felt the table there but by mistake I dropped the plate on the floor.
The chefs made a horrible face at me. My boyfriend and I went to pick up the pieces and after a min nobody coming to clean up the mess my sister saw how bad I felt and came to wipe up the mess. Nobody offered to make me another roll even though I knew I'd be charged for the ones I dropped (and was fine with that)... they never offered to replace it nobody came to clean it up and they actually acted really angry at me for it. 
Considering we all spent a lot of money there before this, as well as that evening, you'd think they would realize what a mistake that was. I am a paying customer I didn't do it on purpose. If we wouldn't have been having such a good night I prob. would have made a bigger deal out of it. Instead I'm just writing this review. I really liked this place up until last week.

I know, I know ya never know who could be a slasher, rapist, serial killer, axe murderer.  I figured that because he was Filipino, it wouldn't be too bad.  Worst he could do is have a pilipino aksent.  Because of him, I found to love this place and met a great awesome person to befriend.  Still friends to this day.

Whenever I'm here I'm always given wonderful service.  The servers are always pleasant, kind, and patient.  I've been pretty lucky with getting nice people.

I agree when the reason why people come back to a place is because of the employees who greet the customers with all smiles, prepare the food, and serve the food.

Because of how convenient this location is to everything I need to get done on a daily basis, I often come here to dine for lunch.  Mostly, I'll just get their lunch special - Salmon and California Rolls.  Nothing spectacular, just the simple lunch I need to get me by through the rest of the day.  It is the simple ingredients that make the best food.  Their salmon is always fresh which is what I love.  I hate old salmon and can't stand it.  Some restaurants will serve old salmon, and you can tell because there's a foul smell permeating from the food.  :/",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,0,5,Td0eAS-_y0mvRqHe-Q6WWw

 I recommend you try the mountain roll, paradise roll, Denver roll, but ask for the sauce on the side this gives you more freedom to add to your liking. Also don't forget to try the tofu cheesecake for me is my all time favorite dessert and it is the perfect end to a good dining experience.  

Yeah I know that there is other sushi places out there that do a great job of serving some good sushi but Brian keeps the quality,flavor and balance always consistent, fresh and delicious.

We love sushi, but if you develop a favorite spot and visit often enough, you start to know everything that you are going to order before you eat.  I wanted to try something new, so we gave this place a try.  

We were hopeful to discover a new sushi spot, however this would not be the case.  First of all we waited about 20 minutes just to get a water and a hot green tea.  We didn't receive our first orders until about 45 minutes later.  The venue is small with 2 sushi chefs, but there weren't many customers there at the time.  They were extremely slow and took breaks to watch tv while we were waiting for our food.  We didn't get everything we ordered because they forgot, but it ended up being ok.  They added a ton of rice to all of their rolls and very little fish.  We ended up getting full on rice without getting to enjoy what we came for.

From all the times I've been there, there's only been one server. Therefore, if it's busy, you're gonna have to be fighting for the waiter. It's always the same waiter, too. I guess they only have one waiter?

If you want fresh and stuff, this might not be the place for you in terms of quality and stuff compared to places like Sushi Twister.

However, I really adore the Almost Fire roll here. I'd mostly just only eat nigiri at other places, but I'd always order this roll here. I'm excited to have it tomorrow, actually :0D.

As an Ex-Local, Brian's Beach was and still is one of our favorite Japanese restaurants in LV.  How much do we like it?  Let's see on a recent URGENT trip to LV where we had to drive over in the morning and leave in the afternoon, the ONE place that we had to make time for in that highly compressed time frame was Brian's Beach.

The service has always been exemplary, the food has always been excellent.  Our favorites include, the seared tuna tartar, Dynamite, the grape and bree quesadilla (WTF? uhh yeah, MUST TRY) and their assorted rolls and appetizers

One great bonus about this place is that the AYCE rules aren't limited to just the rolls, but also apply to the appetizers, so if you have someone with you that doesn't dig rolls, they can stick to the great appetizer menu

The ONE thing that I personally dislike is that the Seared Tuna tartar is limited to one order per guest.  - I can't blame them for that though, it's an expensive dish and I would seriously just chow down on a dozen plates of that if I could.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,0,0,5,1yELtK-WvbyR9VFQUHEmTw
