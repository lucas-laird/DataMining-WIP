645178,2015-06-26,0,QRmXzOeHPhRK-IrCwJVF2g,OMG! Talk about an awesome food experience. Had their Burnt Ends & Fries Burritos. This is definitely a must have. Some may get scared off by the Habanero Molasses if hot is not your style.. Which mine isn't.. But it's just the right amount of kick .. All the ingredients blend together perfectly. Find this truck and go there.. you won't be disappointed.,LMSwKAl2IdBOOzqyg7ojuw,0,0,5,qVmZN9pCbK1n2a1ssMn6NQ

Me and my cousins were at the Las Vegas beer festival and after sampling many beers we came across this food truck. I had the burnt ends burrito and I must say it's on my top 5 list of best burritos.

1060888,2016-02-04,1,QRmXzOeHPhRK-IrCwJVF2g,"I ate at Truck U BBQ in front of Atomic Liquors. It was a very delicious experience and sometimes I wonder if I should make the drive again to Atomic Liquors just to have a bite of their burnt ends burrito again.

The burnt ends weren't all that burnt, but had a tasty smoked and grilled flavor to them. The meat retained a lot of moisture because all I can remember is how juicy the meat was. You could taste the duck fat fries that were fried to a crisp, and the aioli sauce was very strong in the burrito. Overall the burrito was a very strong gustatory experience, and something reserved for special celebrations. I don't think I could eat this burrito more than once every few months because of how much guilty foods are packed into each bite. Truck U really knows how to make a memorable burrito.

If you've never had Truck U before, definitely check it out. The burnt ends and fries burrito will have you dreaming for more.",URb6znpCCVzd1kZvugedwg,1,1,5,PJBuZFa687naOXYEX9fwIw

Tried everything on the menu during a 3 day volleyball tournament and was never disappointed.  Can't wait to go back to Vegas and reload on world class BBQ.

Handle raw meat and go back to making food, handling buns, etc. Without washing, 3 different times. I left without my food and they chased me down to get it to me 10 minutes later.

1865180,2017-08-24,7,QRmXzOeHPhRK-IrCwJVF2g,"Barbecue is the way to my heart, and Truck U has won me over. I love the curves and edges of their burnt ends burrito, packed with smoky, meaty bits and crunchy, salty duck fat fries. The spicy sauces pack just enough heat to leave a little lingering tingle when you're done. The hype is totally real, and that burrito will be in my highlight reel of favorites for a long time to come.  Their fried chicken tacos are also pretty solid, with a cornflake crust, BBQ sauce, and ""jalracha"" for a flavor explosion. The flour tortilla was a good choice that held up despite the hefty filling where a corn tortilla would have fallen apart.  

Truck U only seems to be available for special events these days, but I'll be on the lookout for them whenever I see a gathering of food trucks. The indoor seating available for their kitchen takeover at Kitchen at Atomic was an awesome introduction to their eats, and helped make the bump in pricing a bit more bearable- $14 burrito, $11 for a pair of tacos.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,15,4,nmFXJZVVedr4eU81T5jFhA
1976762,2016-03-27,0,QRmXzOeHPhRK-IrCwJVF2g,"Food truck...they were at a beer fest I attended. Based on other reviews and pics of the menu, it would appear we were offered a limited menu. Ordered the bbq pork fries. They were okay. Lots of pork with good flavor. The fries weren't substantial, almost thought they were onion strings, which was a bit odd. I was expecting more potato in my fries. In the end, it felt mostly like I was eating forks full of pork. The fries were topped with a sauce and jalapeños, which was good. Not sure I would order it again, but it wasn't awful. 

Like all food trucks, order at the window and wait for your name to be called. The order was prepped pretty quickly. Didn't look entirely sanitary, but that's what happens when you order from a food truck?  Overall, the food experience was okay. But we tried food from other trucks at the festival were better. I would order there again if it was the only option, but opt for elsewhere at a foodie festival.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,0,4,vInSHelXkp3ECTr5Doldtw

I was sold. Deciding what to order was harder- choosing between the porcine pleasure of the torta, their decadent sounding krispy-creme sandwich or various incarnations of beefy goodness, I finally decided upon the ""Burnt Ends"" burrito. It took a moment that anticipation made seem arduous to endure as they made a fresh batch of their duck fat fries amidst the rush, but once that little donkey was in my hand I was one seriously happy girl. Tender, smokey bits of beef ensconced with habanero molasses bbq sauce, cheese and that pied-piper of deliciousness that are duck fat fries resulted in an extremely savory, satisfying bite. I devoured the entire thing quite gladly and left the event a very satisfied señorita. The only potential downside was that my hands were left greasy from what oils leaked from the bottom of the burrito, but even the oil was pretty tasty so make of it what you will.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,4,6E33Ppw2o_AhSI48kgHUag

The burrito has a nice kick to it, tasted like chipotles, and a hint of cilantro if I'm not mistaken. I have had this the last two times at first Friday and it is awesome.

This food truck changed my life. I discovered them while hanging out on the side of Atomic Liquors downtown one night and decided to split one of their ""Burnt Ends"" burritos with my boyfriend. ""$11 for a burrito?! This BETTER be good,"" I thought to myself as I drunkenly rummaged through my wallet, two days shy of payday.....

My god. It was FAR better than I expected. We decided we needed to get another one just before the closed up for the night because lord, it was just too good & one was not enough.

4107191,2015-11-15,4,QRmXzOeHPhRK-IrCwJVF2g,"After a positive experience almost exactly one year ago, I decided to give this truck another try. Once again, they overachieved.

Truck U Barbeque is a truck that promises ""slow smoked BBQ with a sticky molasses sweet BBQ sauce"" and ""Mexican food with a twist."" It's run by Chef Mike Minor, who impressively had a long stint at Border Grill and has been on TV somewhere too. It also provided me some impressive chili to-go last year.

This year, I took a cue from KD L's favorable impression. Well, sorta. I didn't see the pork tacos listed today, and I'll look for them next time. but I went for the Burnt Ends & Fries Burrito ($11 today). Delicious, tender smoky burnt ends were complemented by a habanero molasses coleslaw, Oaxacan BBQ aioli, Monterey Jack cheese, and duck fat ""fries"" (a la legit California tacos). Sweet and spicy flavors were so prominent, and while the so-called fries aren't properly fluffy inside, they provided a very welcome crunch and burst of fat. This isn't a light burrito, and I'm somewhat glad that I was able to split it halfsies with a friend.

Considering that the burrito is one of the most delicious savory foods that I've had from a truck, I can't help but go with five stars. Check out Truck U Barbeque at the next food truck gathering or wherever they post up around Vegas (perhaps Atomic Liquors, as evidenced by a quick glance at their social media listings).",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,5,5,jqZjyyxTuvCO5yDIoU0new
