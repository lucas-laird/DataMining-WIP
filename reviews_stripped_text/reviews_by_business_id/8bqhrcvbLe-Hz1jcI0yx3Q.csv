Nothing fancy, it had this rustic look... kind of reminded of me of Korea when I was little and my mom took me to a few places in Korea. It had this old Korea feel to it which I really liked. The menu was simple and small. There were more traditional soup/stew options than other restaurants in town which made me a very happy girl! My husband settled for the bulgogi and rice. Me on the other hand had a very hard time deciding what I wanted. Only because I wanted to try every soup/stew on the menu, but settled for the meat/seafood tofu stew.... which was simply amazing! The spice level was exactly right. Full of wonderful veggies, beef, shrimp, and mussels. We also ordered the fried veggie and meat dumplings (my favorite as a kid) and an order of shrimp fried rice. Made just like my mom made as a kid, with a fried egg on top. I was in food heaven! The wonderful side dishes (banchan) were abundant .... when you ran out of one, the waiter and waitress were on top of it. The food was delicious. It just reminded of me of good ol Korean cooking. The customer service in this place is one of a kind and out of this world! Needless to say, we will be back.",FV09hP2Nq6s_AwUWSkGJeQ,14,11,5,3OZqzmFeh3hmRBq5p8ubkA

I am a huge fan of beef soup and I tried many places, however Si Jang has the best in Vegas so far.

My boyfriend and I decided to try this place since there weren't that many reviews yet. 
We were greeted right away with no wait time.

We ordered the hot stone plate (bibimbap) and the beef soup. 
My boyfriend didn't really like their bibimbap because it took the rice a long time to get crunchy. Even after waiting for 5 minutes, the rice wasn't crunchy. This was a huge disappointment to us, because we love it when the rice has a nice brown color to it.

The beef soup came with rice and some noodles in it. The beef ratio was more than I expected. The soup was full of flavor, you didn't even have to add salt or pepper.

They have a lot of side dishes, but our favorite was the egg pancake? It was perfectly cooked and airy.

I can't wait to come back to try their other food! Highly recommend coming here for their beef soup, but if you want good bibimbap I suggest going to another restaurant.",B7e7gS9fPqKJ0o8hhhwG8Q,5,4,4,CcOpIaAg-EmD5ZODD3PH0w

I like their platter because they have both cabbage and lettuce for wraps. The cabbage is lightly dehydrated with salt so it is easier to wrap the meat with. Which is very considerate. The other place I had was raw cabbage and they snap when I try to roll them. Furthermore, the owner even personally showed us how to put each item in order for the wrap. Service was great as they instantly answers our refill orders. Would definitely come back to try other dishes.",bvHu6kqz44z9obSCQDLPfQ,1,0,5,cHv9i70n49ZElar8ffn1RQ

Ended up ordering the seafood tofu soup. Came with some delicious banchan AND a complimentary mung pancake. That pancake was so delish, I had to get a regular order! Anyway, I didn't get to order what I originally came for. The reason was they didn't have individual portions and no one wanted to share. They wanted their own dish. Hopefully later on they could make it a smaller portion.

Glad to say that the food is as good as the restaurants in LA. The atmosphere is cute and decorated like an old Korean street market. Btw, ""Si Jang"" means market.

I'm from LA and I don't write too many reviews but I had to when I visited Si Jang as it stands out from the plethora of mediocre korean restaurants in town. Much like the restaurants in Koreatown, you can find many different traditional and modern Korean dishes. They have individual and shareable soups/stews, handmade gyozas, noodles, and pork dishes. My favorites were the Spicy Buckwheat Spicy Noodle and King Pork Cutlet. 

The service was great and assuming they are a family operated restaurant, I felt like I was part of the family.

2952975,2018-06-15,0,8bqhrcvbLe-Hz1jcI0yx3Q,"I love the bone broth soup at Si Jang! I can tell it's the real deal because after refrigeration, the broth solidifies into this thick, white, gelatinous clump of hearty nutritiousness. There's hardly any fat layer on top, and I honestly thought it tasted better when I re-heated it the following day for lunch! The flavor can be a bit bland for some, but adding their seasoned salt to the soup can fix that. What confused me was that the first time I ordered oxtail soup for takeout, all I could see were what looked like chunky tendon pieces and no meat! However, I still finished it because it was so melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The second time I ordered oxtail soup, I was almost disappointed to see 2 huge and meaty oxtails instead of the tendon. I wondered if they mixed up my first order and gave me oxtail intestine bone soup that's also on the menu, but regardless, both soups were amazing and helped me through those days when my stomach just wanted simpler and healthier fare. 

Si Jang's open layout of kitchen and tables is casual and comfortable for the solo eater or group get-together. It seems to be a family business, and their customer service is attentive and friendly. I once tried their sizzling bulgogi beef on a hot plate, and it stayed so hot that I couldn't eat much of it without burning my mouth! The owner/cook noticed and kindly provided me with a chopped cucumber in sweetened vinegar and ice to help cool down my tastebuds. I still had to take most of the bulgogi plate home though. I think I'll be sticking to their bone soups! :)",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,1,0,4,Mpp85SHJSILbWMi4tN1XrQ

We had the ox tail soup, doenjang Chigae, pork bulgogi, bibim naeng myun, regular naeng myun and yook kae jang.  it was all good. Usually when order a variety of dishes you are expecting 1 or 2 dishes to not be that good because of the variety of spices it takes to make Korean food.

2956092,2018-06-24,0,8bqhrcvbLe-Hz1jcI0yx3Q,"Tired of the usual Korean BBQ menu in Las Vegas? Then you're in for a pleasant surprise at Si Jang. While this juncture has the regular Galbi or Korean BBQ we are all familiar with, they also offer some of the tastiest street food I've had in a while! This place has fantastic ambiance, taste, and experience. Whether or not you've been to Korea, Si Jang does an excellent job presenting the Korean street food atmopshere with their unique and nostalgic interior-You will see posters of classic movies, tobacco signs, iconic nickel plated makgoeli pots...Everything that makes you feel like you've stepped into Korea. This place seriously reminds me of my hometown in Seoul.

If you like Naengmyeon (Cold Buckwheat Noodles), you'll be delighted to know Si Jang currently has an incredible deal. Two bowls of Naengmyeon for $12.99. You can choose between Mul and Bibim Naengmyeon. If you haven't tried Naengmyeon before, it's served ice-cold (literally with pieces of ice) and it is down-right refreshing during the summer time. I can't think of another meal I crave more on a hot ass summer day like today, currently 101. Damn!

My favorite is the Galbi Jjim, which is braised Galbi with veggies in a marinated broth. The portion is good enough to share with another person or two.

The service is friendly, and the staff is more than happy to host big parties. There are tables in the restaurant to accommodate +8 people.

The only downside I can think of is that they do not sell alcohol! I asked one of the servers, and the reason is that they are still waiting to receive their liquor license sometime around July. Fair enough! Once that's set, this place truly has the potential to become my go-to drinking spot. If they offer more kick-ass deals like the two Naengmyeon for $12.99 during night time, this place will be a no-brainer hangout spot for me.

I will update this review once they receive it but until then, I am beyond satisfied with the quality and food at Si Jang. Thumbs up!",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,0,5,24QSM2iH6mr_NkvXYYs2yw

The deep fried gyoza was  not crispy and overly oily. It deflated after I picked it up with my chopsticks. The soon tofu tasted like seasoned water.

4146531,2018-06-17,0,8bqhrcvbLe-Hz1jcI0yx3Q,"This is my new favorite Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. It's not all you can eat BBQ, but they have tasty food at reasonable prices. 

The place is only about a month old and my Korean mother said it was good and took me. She and her friend went and thought it was the best Korean in Las Vegas and they were right.

We had the cold buckwheat noodles called Naeng myun. There are two types of naeng myun one in a icy cold broth and the other that is mixed in hot sauce. My mother is super picky when it comes to Korean food because 1) she's foodie and 2) she's an amazing cook. But this place had chewy, think buckwheat noodles that were seasoned well. The broth is savory and with a little bit of sweetness to it, and of course you can add your own mustard and vinegar. It's very refreshing in the summer. I had the hot sauce naeng myun called bibim naeng myun which just means mixed naeng myun.

My sister ordered the ox bone soup with mixed meats. The type of meats are cow intestines, stomach, tongue etc. I tried the soup, and it was very rich and savory without the gaminess. I'd order it with just the beef next time for me, but it was her favorite. The soup is white from all the marrow being boiled. If you chilled this soup, it would be gelatin.

We also ordered the bo-ssam. If you've been to Momofuku Las Vegas at the cosmo, they make a version of this, but I have to say Si Jang's pork belly is tender, slick, more velvety than Momofuku... but don't get me wrong Momofuku is miles above in the overall flavor and creative combinations... it's just that here it's simple but good. 

Si Jang means marketplace. In Korea, there are open markets throughout most of the cities and villages and within them they have foodie alleys of all sorts of food vendors... which is why the menu at this restaurant takes all the popular dishes from the si jang theme.

I'd definitely try it but don't expect the usual BBQ. Try something new in Korean cuisine. Koreans in general do not eat BBQ all the time. There is so much for to Korean food than BBQ.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,1,0,5,Vy2677nYZxx2_ckORpSUlQ

The seafood tofu soup lacks flavor.  There was 1 shrimp, 1 green mussel in shell, and tiny pieces of squid / oyster.  It does not taste like a standard SoonDubu at all.  I even had to sprinkle salt into in.  Where is the clam jus flavor? Very bland.

-The octopus plate is fantastic. The stone pot gives the rice a nice, crispy texture. There were plenty of octopus pieces. The dish was a perfect medium spice. 

-The bossam is a must get. Perfectly steamed pork with an array of Napa cabbage, garlic, jalapeños and radish. A great plate for the table to share. They also have a small size if you're eating alone. Don't miss this one! 

I will definitely be coming back here as much as I possibly can!",1X_AZ34t6j09BYaet1GA7A,2,0,5,NyzuhX7ngsKZ2DknKgZm5w

I brought my family here yesterday and the staff were more than happy to accommodate us at the last minute, even though they already had 3 reservations booked for the main area. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. Ice water was served right away, and then out came the banchan side dishes. Boy, was I impressed. From the presentation & tastes of the banchan, I could tell I was in for one heck of a meal! We ordered a total of 7 entrees (oxtail soup, soft tofu soup, braised beef ribs, hot stone plate w/ bulgogi, Napa wraps w/ pork, and the buy1get1free special on the buckwheat cold noodle) with 4 bowls of rice to go around, and walked out holding our bellies. 
I am so in love with their interior. It reminds me of the street vendors back in Korea.
The owner and staff were so attentive, quite the conversationalists, and we were given the utmost of service. The owner Daniel treated my dad as if they were old friends, even though they had just met. I'm extremely happy to have found this restaurant, their food is on point and can't wait to bring my friends here in the future.",lIXDiXM-gh1F1L4O-HxkQQ,0,1,5,WHCOsa3cggh2UpbY-1VNcA

We read some good reviews about this place so we decided to try it and it was the best decision in our lives!! Now that its summer and vegas happens to be in the desert, i noticed everyone around us was ordering neng myun which is the cold buck noodles. You can order 2 same or 2 different types of noodles for $11.95! It was literally the best korean place you can go in vegas! The restaurant seems to be family owned so they're definitely more friendly than any other restaurant out here. I recommend this place to all korean food lovers",HsixHy319KlWiqHufUqdqw,0,0,5,TNNATYc7Z1hwWcMwo7WFNw
