We were greeted by two really friendly girls but the good service stopped there.  It took a while to get a waitress and get a drink.  It wasn't even busy.  Then we we got our drinks I had to ask for straws.  We ordered and never saw our waitress again until we were almost finished with our food.  I had to ask another waitress I flagged down for a refill of our drinks.  Pizza was good but my husbands burger was not.  I'm so disappointed, as I had high hopes.

There are window's all along the sides of the restaurant that give a great view on to both of the rinks. Great selection of draft beers from microbreweries. I tried the Atomic Duck as well as the Golden Nite Pilsner. For food we had the chicken club rolls and a thin crust Rancher Pizza. I will definitely be back to try out more of the food and drinks.,SnPCKbqxNMEF5NQPW2zDRw,0,0,5,DFWemX23EYi_fDiCbIpIpg

Due to the event they had coolers with beers on the side of the bar so my buddy and i grabbed 2 beers and went to the bar to pay for them , while trying to pay the bartender Anthony was so rude and said those beers were not for us just for the event he snatched them and put them back ! so we had to order 2 other beers from the bar and he had a nasty attidtude then he goes and tells his manager that we grabbed the wrong beers to top it off he gave us back the wrong change i was missing like $6 and he never gave me a receipt so i had no proof! so i talked to the shorter manager can't recall his name and told him what had happened and he didn't care at all he said there was no way of knowing if he charged me extra because i had payed cash not debit . so then i just let it go i said it's ok it's just $6 i guess then  i ask Anthony for another round and he ignored me waited almost 15min and he still ignored me and served other people that got there after i did . So then the other manager named Chris came by and i told him and he actually helped and served us . Thanks to Chris for that but i'm never goin back to this place it's terrible and That bartender needs to be fired he is rude and disrespectful. you do not need workers like that in such a important place for Las Vegas .",w6aJNCQKTz3yEEafvTYdUQ,0,0,1,biibIqCYeZH5Wqz1K-HMpw

Yes and it's from Montana which happens to be one of my favorite states and the food is delicious! The cherry on top of the sundae is that you can catch the Golden Knight's practicing when they're in town!

The decor could use some work as it felt unfinished to me but I love the views of the ice rinks!

Honestly the food really surprised me. It's not just your typical bar bites. You can order thin or normal crust on your pizza and we opted for thin. The Thai pie was my favorite! Peanut sauce, seasoned chicken, mandarin oranges, scallions, red peppers, peanuts and mozzarella, topped with fresh cilantro. Tip* ask for peanut sauce on the side and drizzle it over the pizza! The BBQ chicken pizza was also fantastic and I don't eat wings but I loved the buffalo ones my man ordered. The menu offers burgers, salads, sandwiches, desserts and much more.

Anyways, onto the food. The pizza was decent but really this review is dedicated to the clam chowder. As soon as I received the dish just the looks of it told me this wasn't going to end well. I maybe had two bites and the texture was horrendous. How do you even call this dish clam chowder?!

It's a cool spot, located above the two new hockey rinks (ahhh get it... get it?). We walked around and watched hockey practice while waiting for our food. 

We ordered a large Spinach Salad (with candied walnuts, dried cranberries and bleu cheese crumbles) and a large Good Ol' Boy pizza (""a heapin' portion of extra pepperoni, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce.""). For two this was just enough food.

Came to watch a buddy of mine play in the beer league so i sat inside. Ordered 2 flights just to try all of their beers and it took over 15 mins for them to come out. There was only 2 other guests in the place. I finished them without her coming by to check on me once. Finally was able to flag her down to pay the tab only to take about another 15 mins just to bring the check. After the game we decided to sit at the bar and the bar tender seemed like he hated his job. Seemed like they were all out of beer he just kept saying nope were out of that. Finally we had enough and went to Chicago brewing down the road. Would like to check out the place during a game but the crazy high prices and terrible staff make me want to stay far away from this place,yB7iJSnU5SSVEQNt8pQLTg,0,0,2,A03RHVvTuzM8Zy01yfamwQ

2432561,2018-01-03,0,Zbq8tF7JmBBCqA69_gL5Uw,"I am writing this review based off of the last experience I had here at MacKenzie River which sadly may have lost a permanent patron in myself, the many I have referred to the establishment, and my family. It is actually quite sad because the first time I posted about our very first visit, I was extremely satisfied with the level of customer service by our server Renee, and honestly have never received even half the level of customer service since every time we've gone. Keep in mind, we visit the restaurant at least twice a month. I've looked passed other reviews on the poor service simply because I hoped they were false, but have succumbed to the sad reality that the service here is the exact opposite of the team they represent... Definitely losing in the customer service department.

Yesterday, my family and I decided we'd grab lunch at MacKenzie River during open practice. We entered through the supposed front entrance with the host counter (which is NEVER manned) and waited a good 5 minutes for someone to approach us (and never did). We and other patrons just mutually decided to seat ourselves as NO ONE paid any mind to us waiting in plain sight of the servers. My family and I sat directly outside the entrance to the kitchen overlooking the rink. 5 more minutes pass to which my mother decides to flag someone down. The waitress who she had flagged (who had passed is numerous times into the kitchen) stated she didn't even see us (highly unlikely). So the whole experience with her was one that made us feel as though she A. Disliked her job or B. Disliked us being there. There was nothing warm about her. I let the poor service go overlooked as my toddler seemed to be enjoying himself. Eventually, we were through eating and waited for our waitress to note we were completed and once again, we waited.... And waited... So much so I held on to my credit card with the hopes she would return to take my payment so we could leave. Finally upon her returning to our table, I literally just handed her my card (which I never do) so we could pay and leave. Upon getting the receipt to sign, I made the realization that she charged my card for the entirely  wrong tab. Yes, I admit I made my first mistake in not reviewing the check prior to, but I couldn't stand waiting any longer. She provided me the new receipts and we finally departed. 

Due to the angst I faced, I accidentally left my credit card (mistake #2) which I called and confirmed the whereabouts the next day. I spoke to one of the managers, Chris who was honestly one of the most gracious people I dealt with leading up to the other ungracious employees I encountered this evening. I entered the restaurant again at the ""host counter"" to see a waitress there gathering place settings. I ask her if Chris the manager was around as I had left my credit card there the day before. She replies, ""I mean, you can go check. Maybe at the bar they might have it."" Okaaayyyy... As someone who works in customer service, one thing I know is to handle an issue when it is brought to you NOT to pass it onto the next. And frankly, I specifically asked for the manager by name! So I approach the bar and this pleasant woman asks if she could help me, to which I again ask for Chris. She took my name and said she'd check, then proceeded to complete a task to which a male bartender asked if I had been helped. I respond, ""yes, I accidentally left my credit card here yesterday."" Instantly after responding to him, the female bartender replies, ""yes I said I would get it for you."" Excuse me?? I simply just replied to a question the male bartender asked and she replies as though I was asking him to do what she said she was going to do (and didn't). Thankfully for me, the male employee quickly retrieved my credit card in a swift minute that would've probably only taken the first two people I encountered the same amount of time.

It's really laid-back and you can be up close to a professional sports team practice without any hassle. This restaurant is run very well, the service is fantastic and the ambience is great. Sadly the food is really subpar. It isn't horribly expensive but the quality of the food they're serving is pretty bad. The hamburgers tasted like institutional lunch room style meat. The mac & cheese tasted like paste with a bit of flavoring and the chicken nachos, while unbelievably huge, were somewhat cold and they came out with very little flavor. The salsa was from Vons or somewhere. Very uninspired. I gave two stars to get management's attention. The food really was surprisingly pretty blah in this great setting.

The poutine was quite tasty. Go figure. Add gravy and cheese curds to fries. 

The smokehouse burger was a burger (high quality beef) with pulled pork and Gouda cheese. The fries had the skins on and were fresh from the fryer. 

Can't go too wrong with fried pickles. These were spears and very tasty. 

Nice selection of beers. Spartan lager was crisp and delicious

The Baja Fish Tacos consist of two flour tortillas with spicy breaded or grilled cod fillets, pineapple salsa, arugula and avocado sour cream.

I spoke to the manager and made arrangements for us on Sunday Dec 3. I went a week early to check out the facility. I'm originally from Canada and this arena really impressed me. When we arrived the manager did not live up to his word and we made some other arrangements for our large party. But once we met Chris Dejesus, the assistant manager, everything was much better. It was so much fun to watch the VGK - they were actually playing at T Mobile. We won this game in overtime. The week before our gathering people went in search of jerseys and T shirts. For some, this was their first time watching a hockey game. I ordered appetizers and a couple of pizzas for everyone. The food is amazing. The apple & chicken flatbread was delicious. Some of the other things we ordered were Cowboy Nachos, Cheese Curds, Mack N Cheese Bites. Wings. The desserts were fantastic also - the cheesecake and some kind of chocolate cake.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of the practice arena. There is plenty of parking in front of the building. Inside the restaurant there are tables, but most of the seating is bar style seating. There is a large bar in the middle, but the best seating is the bar style seating with a large window to the practice rink. 

We enjoyed a small Caesar Salad, Chicken Chili, and a large Rancher pizza. The Caesar salad and chicken chili were okay, but not good enough to order again. The Rancher pizza was pretty good. The crust was tasty with herbs and a buttery taste. The pizza was also loaded with toppings and the crust was substantial enough to hold all of the toppings.

The service was okay, but definitely could use some improvements. The good was that our server didn't take long to greet us after seated and took our orders without much delay. The bad was that our starters came at the same time as our pizza instead of first, we weren't given plates with our pizza, and we had to track someone down to get a spoon for the chili.

However the last time we were there which was yesterday Nov. 9th, UNLV was hosting an alumni party as well as UNLV playing against another team so it was crowded.  It has been crowded before and everything was fine, but this time the food WAS TERRIBLE. 
 We ordered 2 Reuben sandwiches which basically is corn beef, cabbage, thousand island dressing on grilled marbled bread.  Not much to ruin, right?  However I don't expect my sandwich to contain large pieces of fat attached to the corn beef!  Kitchen staff, just a word to the wise when you put meat in a sandwich make sure its meat and not the fat, no one ways to bite down on pieces of fat.  The sandwich was tasteless, thousand island dressing were you in there? didn't taste any.... just a shame... brought it to the managers attention and he bought us a dessert for not enjoying our dinner.  Nice thought... but we came for dinner, not dessert and our dinner was not enjoyable. 
 Consistency is very important in a restaurant.  I don't go for the beer or Happy Hour, I go for the food, and I thought we found a great place but unfortunately like everything else, you get the customers to come in with the perks (watching hockey being played) and then you slack off on your food.  Not good, so I would say the food needs improvement, managers check what is going on in your kitchen and make sure the food comes out the way it is supposed to.
 No one wants to pay for food that isn't acceptable.  It is a shame, because the food was good and now it isn't.

While maybe on the salty side from the pepperoni and the generic tasting tomato sauce, it wasn't terrible, though could have been left in the oven maybe a minute longer for a crispier crust.  At least it wasn't rolled out white bread with ketchup and cheese. Also ordered were an order of Slammers (sliders) which were very good, about four times the meat than White Castle.

It's not easy to find if you aren't looking for it, no signage downstairs to indicate that it's on top of the rink. It sits in-between both practice rinks with windows on both sides to watch. The idea of it is cool which is why I didn't give it one star. 

When you walk in, I guess you just sit yourself. There's a hostess stand but no one to staff it and no sign to tell you to take a seat. Another patron told us after we stood at the front looking confused for 5 minutes. Once we sat someone did come to the table to drop menus quickly. Then she sat at the table behind us to eat her shift meal which was awkward.

My husband ordered a Cobb salad, daughter ordered kids Mac and cheese and I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich. The turkey avocado sandwich was the best pick of the 3. The kids mac was swimming in cheese sauce which seemed very unappealing to me but my cheese loving daughter was ok with it. It came with a fruit cup that was supposed to have cantaloupe, pineapple, and grapes. It has pineapple and cantaloupe and grapefruit in a really strange sauce/syrup. Kids don't like grapefruit from my experience, the fruit sat. The Cobb salad didn't look bad upon first look. We ordered the large which was an ok size but not a large salad by any means. The greens weren't that of a normal fresh crisp Cobb, they were limp. The eggs tasted ""gassy"" and the chicken tasted old and rubbery. My husband felt everything was pretty old and definitely what you'd expect out of a fresh salad. 

Bummer it wasn't better! Will have to take my husband to the location out of state so he doesn't think I'm crazy for loving their food!",XchgtZ26DloBi5MeopkA6Q,0,0,2,sw0rYjNsj834w7z7Le1Jcg

The food is good, BUT, the tables are always dirty, I bring my own wipes. The joint is ALWAYS understaffed, you can't order and get your check paid in a 1hour practice window.. ALWAYS standing waiting for check unless I ask for it with my food or even right after I order......On game days.... FORGET IT!! I just want a salad, but if it's a game day you can't even move or find a seat and they never have the stupid snack bar open to just grab something. What's the point in having it?? There are actually people who JUST want food and don't want to sit like a sardine watching the game. Better to just eat before practice those days or I end up eating junk from the vending machine. I go here because it's the only option... not great.",DSZjwVTxsmqXTPbmx0fbaA,0,0,2,hBOikechVvvEBEAiY0x3mw

Just when you think Downtown Summerlin has it all, you stumble upon this gem.    We arrived at Happy Hour wondering if this treasure we found on Yelp even existed.  After asking around we went up a floor and stumbled upon the entrance.  Inside you were greeted with the warm glow of a pub surrounded by two skating rinks.  Listening to the sounds of the games and practice below was awesome.  Want to take a peak inside the rink?  No problem, open one of the two doors and you're there.  

We sat at the bar and listened to the Bartender tell us about the menu and the specials.  Apparently, they are owned by the Golden Knights owner and are not spending too much on advertising.  Selfishly, I hope this continues because I'm guaranteed a great seat if It kept under wraps. (Insert wink)

The must haves are the wings and the fried pickles to start.  The reuben pizza was so unique and tasty, I can see the sandwich in my future.  My husband had the sliders which were huge and tasty.  Finally, we shared a salad and the vegetables were fresh and the dressing was homemade.  

The drink pours were generous and not what you would expect in a building that must have cost a fortune to build.  I loved the GK pilsner.  I must admit, the first visit was so great we came back Sunday with the kids.  They watched a tournament and we supervised from the table area.  The only downside-plastic wine glasses for the obvious reason.  However, if that's my only complaint, I think they will be just fine.",Sme_0jk0mJPWIMjGzKqBbQ,3,1,5,pnWpPWDpB6WcpqvBtVTkOQ

5367243,2018-06-26,2,Zbq8tF7JmBBCqA69_gL5Uw,"New favorite bar alert-- I love this place so much and regret that I never came here during a Knights game. I can't even imagine how much fun that is. I plan on being a regular here so  I will update after I experience a Knights game. Go Knights Go.

I came here on the day they were having the police versus fire game. Very cool to see. The place was not that busy when we arrived and the service was a tad slow but it's okay.

The menu is not that big but they have some great choices. They even have mud pie for dessert which I was so pumped about because nobody really serves it anymore. The problem was that I was so full I could not order it.

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the grilled fish tacos. They were both very good. I thought the tacos coming in a flour tortilla was kind of strange but then I realized there was just no way they could put that much filling in a corn, so I was happy.

They have a good selection of beer. We had a Golden Knight Beer and it was delicious. I thought the 8.00 price tag was a little rude considering this is pretty much a locals bar and locals will not keep paying that much for beer when we have so many other local locations that are way cheaper.

They do have an app you can download if you plan to go there a lot like me. The first time you download you will get a free flatbread with a 15.00 purchase, so basically 2 beers. It also let's you earn money towards a future meal. Kinda cool.

Can't wait to return, prob going this weekend again. LOL! Thanks for a great experience.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,9,4,5,cd7WmnXETacv5NGhy02G4Q

I was actually surprised at how nice of a pub it was. It's huge and well staffed. I would give it 3.5 stars but our waiter was so nice I bumped it up to 4. With their happy hour prices being higher than most of the neighboring Downtown Summerlin spots, you are paying for the view. We ordered 3 beers and 2 appetizers and the bill was $60 with tip. The chicken wings were recommended by our waiter. They're baked first then fried, which makes for an extra crispy wing! The Thai curry sauce on the wings was full of flavor and had a nice bit of heat. We also ordered the poutine, fries topped with cheese curds and brown gravy. It was gobbled within minutes it was so good! The fries maintained their crispy texture despite being laden with melting cheese curds and gravy. I have no complaints about the food or the service, as neither disappointed. My only gripe is the happy hour apps are $8 and up, which isn't very competitive for the area.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,0,4,L53pEWEeUg-hkEZifkG8vw

I was pleasantly surprised that they have a happy hour 7 days a week. 2-6pm. We ordered (mainly) happy hour menu items. We had the Mac and cheese bites, cheese curds, fried pickles, and the poutine fries. All of them were delish! We didn't care too much for the poutine fries though bc they were a little soggy with the gravy on top.  My daughter had the kids menu mini corn dogs and fries. I was impressed she also got a side of fruit w her order. And she ate it all up (which says a lot bc my daughter is a picky eater). 

The staff was excellent. Always making sure we were good and even brought a second round of drinks before we finished our first round.  I'll def be back to try out other items on the menu.",Zm2rOksCSgNK_o0U1Vt-qQ,0,0,4,rR9LsUUfdl5Zlui7RpHXgw
5586277,2018-01-06,0,Zbq8tF7JmBBCqA69_gL5Uw,"Updated review: how does this place expect to be taken seriously as a viewing center for the team, in the teams own facility, when they cant accommodate their fans? It's absurd to expect people to show up 2 hours in advance so you can hope to get a table. It's also absurd to hold reserved seating for only certain groups of people, while simultaneously telling your core demographic that there's no reservations allowed. Guess I won't be bringing my family to one of the few ""family friendly"" viewing establishments anymore. 



I'm giving this place only two stars for the lack of seating for persons who are handicapped. Yes, I know this is technically a ""bar"", but it's family friendly, and for the games, there is not enough low top seating available. 
My mother is older and disabled, and unable to be seated in the taller chairs. 3/4 of this place is the high tabletops and high stools, which are not helpful to someone who cannot be seated in them. nor are they family friendly. 
There is plenty of space for more tables. I hope the owners take this into consideration and add more low top tables.",1JYMsM3kFNCFqI10JXATcQ,3,0,1,Kl8B1iAQ1xyPsbIZKjJ3hA

You call in early and they tell you they won't take reservations,  then you get here 2 hours before the game starts and every table is being held down by a single person.   Tables open up and the employees start cleaning them and telling you they are reserved.   The girl was friends with the people and she was clearly sitting them because of it.  

Bottom line is that the food isn't good enough to justify the wait or the hassle.  It's not better than the most average PTs food you've ever had.

We started with the Apple & Chicken Flatbread. AMAZING! We had half of the dish made vegetarian! This suggested by Tabatha so the entire table could partake.
