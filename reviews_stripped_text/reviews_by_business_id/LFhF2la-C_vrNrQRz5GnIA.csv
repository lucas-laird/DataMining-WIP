The worst thing is that I've been to at least four other burger king's and have had the same problem with the ketchup, but I guess that's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns!! You run a burger joint; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint?! Plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty. Just have sloppy made burgers. Worst chain ever!!!!",G-tMBxwYJ_0ShiY0pa5HFA,1,0,1,mFX8GylFXoB-24FBxaaTjg

I asked Wendy what comes on there bacon cheese burger. She replied by saying the same thing that comes on the cheeseburger, except with bacon. I have no idea what comes on the cheeseburger there because I don't eat fast food. I don't appreciate her poor attitude, and I'm sorry I was asking too much of her to tell me what comes on the cheeseburger. Maybe Wendy needs to get a different job where she does not have to interact with customers. I won't be going back there EVER",Y49pTBbbqrqjYcDkYI7kEg,1,0,1,_Wn3H7rPmBSiKmOWvfcGfQ

Burger King
Burger King is my favorite restaurant. I recommend going to burger king because it is cheap, not crowded and has kids entertainment. 
  Burger King items are really cheap.  No items are above six dollars,in fact everything is under six dollars. (even the  happy meals too!) The food there is so delicious and yummy!

Next, I would like to tell you that burger king is never crowded. (Like when I visited Burger King in february it wasn't even crowded!) But however, even though it's not crowded the Restaurant doesn't have  lots of money. There are lots of  Burger kings in in Irvine California. This is why I think burger king is never crowded.
 
The kids entertainment is so amazing! Almost in every Burger king has a playground for kids. It is humongous. They also serve a kids meal! Also the people there are so nice! The Kids meals includes a toy, a drink and some food. The meals are so deelishis!  
This is why Burger King is my favorite restaurant. It has great service and I recommend going to BURGER KING.",FOy46T5Fp553AMcHQWVuEQ,0,0,4,cBnjvTXeyyzTzsw5axQcdw

Best thing is when you get your food and drive off 5 feet cuz your so annoyed of waiting and then realize they forgot your fries! Smh
So save your time and go to another Burger King unless you don't mind waiting!",xfqPGK1jySZ89D1OUQFuXQ,0,0,1,aj1VpvcCE6FU2a_LbdKVQA

The burgers are fine just probably not the burger you ordered, have the wrong size, wrong flavor of soda...you get the idea.",ygT1tO9wVsz3x_Rf2Yzzeg,2,0,2,G1ouJzSuKTpsEe19UEzsRg

My 3 year old son is now saying, ""shit"" after one of the employees. Hopefully he doesn't start saying, ""bitch"" as well. My child never says bad words until now. The food was decent aside from a breakfast sandwich my husband had that was not freshly made. Won't be coming here again.",QOWhx147QYFvR5G7MRphow,0,0,1,ULdovSB8eUVsZglowC8hIg

So they went through all the trouble of installing electrical outlets at all the tables -- which is great for customers -- and then they cover them all up with outlet covers to block customers from using them.

Fantastic. I guess I won't be coming to this location again.",PcTpJtpIc3qwcxh10KRDIQ,0,0,1,jZer2E6DIgpzMfj5Vsv8TQ

The store is not necessarily clean on the outside we don't know what the inside looks like because we didn't go inside. But let me tell you that Whopper was delicious perfect perfect perfect thank you Burger King,EvCaC2UkS8HniRXVyGHhsw,0,0,4,-YM2Isud0NDvgGxAEOkx_w
