I have eaten similar dishes in other eateries without questions, but here the service is so genuinely nice and approachable that i had to ask if there was a particular way of eating the dish. The wonderful server  enthusiastically explained that they normally smash the tomato into the rice along with the butter (optional) and take a bite of the onion and chard pepper with the meat,  ah ha, and that is exactly how I would end up enjoying this dish.   

Another yummy thing to enjoy here is their cooked to order Sangak Bread which you can see cook in their special oven right before your eyes! this is easily enjoyed alone or with any of their yogurt, hummus, eggplant dips or soup.

I also recommend their homemade Iced Tea which is so refreshing and don't forget dessert.   Their baklava is on my list for next time but for the last couple of trips i cannot pass up on their Saffron Pistachio Ice Cream made right on premise... simply decadent!

The portions are huge, the eating experience is unique and the service is the topper and absolutely the best!",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,30,22,5,YfBif3Agw6EIIlaPlqLnwg

We were one of the first ones there and were seated immediately. We usually order the same appetizers and plates whenever we try a new Persian restaurant. We ordered the kashke bademjun for an appetizer and ordered the chicken and meat koobideh. They brought fresh bread which we watch them make right in front of us. The food came shortly after the appetizer (fast service.) The food was extremely flavorful and there was so much food we packed the extras to go. For dessert we ordered a baklava and drank tea with it. It was perfect! Also, I believe they made the baklava, but I never asked. It was fresh and delicious.

Appetizer was the delicious house made bread and I ordered the yogurt with shallots(cousin to onion and garlic). The yogurt is not as thick as I typically like it as i like it to be made with half labneh and half regular yogurt but nothing is going to be perfect for everyone. 

As an entree I got the beef chunks with the chicken breast chunks. They were both so juicy and delicious. The rice was soft and fluffy, with a side of roasted tomato, a side of roasted jalapeno and of course onion. 

In my family some people crush up the tomato into the rice and add the butter with the brown seasoning, personally I am not a big fan of that. The food here is very traditional and delicious. it is fresh and I will be back.

I was able to try the ground chicken skewer and ground beef skewer. The ground chicken was a little drier and not as tasty as the beef but the seasoning was great on both. 

The service was friendly to say the least, very personable and I felt comfortable there. There are many times that Persian restaurants make me feel very out of place but this was not one of them. 

For dessert i did have rose water ice cream which my girlfriend stated tasted like perfume but to me it tasted right. It is a floral tasting ice cream that has pistachios in it. 

I will be back and will make sure my family comes here when they are in town. I just wish they had a belly dancer or some kind of entertainment because in Cali (where I am from) typically they have that on some nights. I think it would be a great addition to this gem in Las Vegas.",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,2,0,5,1p0AHp5QJfTgtkcgDSnwjg

I diced the onion then mixed it with the rice then sliced the tomato so I could dab the chicken in the tomato juice.

The hummus and masto khiar were okay in my books. The masto khiar was a little too thin and there wasn't enough cucumber mixed in. The hummus did taste homemade but it lacked enough flavoring to make it really shine. Kashkeh bademjoon was okay 
but nothing that stands out. The house salad was nothing special. 

This was served with some warmed pita bread but obviously not made in house. 

The beef koobideh on the other hand was great - just enough onion and seasoning to bring out the beef flavor. The chicken koobideh however wasn't as good as the beef. The sangak was lightly grilled and buttered. 

The service was pretty good for a small place like this and friendly.

1) The place is understaffed. ( I looked through the window and there was 2 guys in the kitchen ( no head nets for 1 guy, one wearing bandana) and one skinny rude lady running around)
2) There was a Lady reading a foreign book in the corner with no food and she didn't look like a customer ( creepy)
3) They need a better music.
4) The menu is decent but not as good as other Persian restaurants in town.
5) Parking is hard to find and the 2 parking close to the store has a 9-1-1 tow sign on it. I do not know if it's even legal to call your business 9-1-1, people draw confusion between real 9-1-1 and tow company with 9-1-1 resemblance. ( rest of the front parking are taken by the dog grooming shop)
6) parking sign says Aria restaurant 10 min parking even though the place is called Hafez. So confusing....

I realize they are a small business and I did my best to give them a good review, but they need to stop putting as much oil in their food. People want less oil and grease these days and age.

As a former chef, I know why this restaurant put a lot of oil. Its because oil and grease are fulfilling so you would think they gave you a large portion, and also you do not have to taste the unpleasant cheap spices they use.

 Wonderful. The 8 yr old said ,'It's the best place in the world.'  We have never eaten Persian food before. This was excellent. We got a large player of kabobs. Grilled tomato and Serrano peppers along side.  Loved the different flavors. Served with raw white onion with a spice shaken over it and rice with saffron. 
Sometimes when you try a new food it is just too different to judge if you like it or not? Not tonight! I squeezed lemon over everything, added the onion and my mouth was smiling. 
We had twin 2year olds and an 8 year old with us. I couldn't believe how much the twins gobbled up! They kept eating and eating. 
Don't forget dessert- baklava and saffron,rose & pistachio ice cream. The ice cream was so so different, nothing like I've ever had before. I couldn't stop eating it. A little too different for the children so they devoured the baklava instead, leaving ice cream for us adults. 
The owner was gracious and made us feel comfortable.  
I'm giving it a 5star because it's one of those restaurants I want to encourage. The tiny obscure gems that serve excellent food without the pretense. Real food.

Thanks to Aria, I'm able to enjoy quality Persian food at my home away from home...Vegas!!  

Food - excellent:
Had the chicken kabob. Chicken was soft and juicy, rice was buttery and moist, and the veggies were grilled on the outside but not over cooked on the inside. 
Also had the hummus. The pita was fresh, not stale, as was the hummus. Got crisp, bright garlic and lemon flavored from the hummus but wasn't over powering such that I could still taste the chick peas...perfect in my opinion.

Ambiance - interesting:
There were lots of period Persian decorations on the walls. The overall interior was clean and well kept with an overwhelmingly beautiful aroma that hits you right when you open the door!  

Service - outstanding:
I called the order in but had some issues ordering as the menu on Yelp does not display the item number. Fortunately, the woman that took my order was extremely patient with me. She even re-confirmed my order when I arrived just to make sure I got exactly what I ordered. 

Price - reasonable:
Let's be honest, Persian food ain't cheap. In fact, I'm kind of used to paying $15.99 for a skinny skewer of chicken and a toasted tomato wedge. So, paying $13 for a huge plate of bomb kabob is a deal for me.

Left the LV strip on an uber and it took about 15 min to travel the ~7 mile journey from Las Vegas Blvd. Arrived at the place around 615pm for dinner and noticed how empty the place was. There was only a family there besides us. The place is located in a strip mall that seems mostly uninhabited. 

We decided to order the half/half tadig as an appetizer (half gheymeh half ghorme sabzi of course). We ordered a chicken Sultani and and a standard soltani as our entrees. 

Service was great and the food was fantastic. I definitely recommend leaving the strip to give this place a go. The food has me drooling again just 24 hrs later and I will definitely return here.

The waitress was very patient and answered all of the questions with a smile. We all ordered a variation of skewers, two with boneless chicken and one had the steak and chicken combination. For starters, one of us ordered a salad, one the hummus, and I ordered the Mast o Moosir which is yogurt with dill and seasonings. The hummus and yogurt dip came with a huge piece of freshly made flat bread. It's called sangak bread. It was so amazing that a couple of us ordered another piece of it to take home. The appetizer sizes were very generous. Both were delicious. The salad covered an entire dinner size plate and was piled nearly three inches high in the middle. The dinner portions are quite large, too. You get the meat with a lot of rice. You have the option of getting half of the rice and a house salad if you prefer it. The rice has some saffron rice on top of it. It is rather bland, but after adding just a little bit of salt and this amazing seasoning that comes in a sprinkler container on the table it was fantastic. The chicken and steak are well seasoned and delicious. The chicken was all breast meat which I liked. The meal comes with a chunk of raw onion, lime, a grilled tomato, and a grilled serrano pepper.

I started with a small bowl of barley soup which was very hot (temperature) and very good.

I wanted to try something different for the entr√©e, so I ordered the Fesenjan, a dish the menu describes in this way: Finely chopped walnuts stirred into pomegranate molasses with chicken (cooked for 12 hours).  The dish was very good and was something entirely different.  There is a sweetness to it from the pomegranate molasses but there's also a tang to the dish.  A wedge of white onion was served and I sliced this in small pieces to mix with the fesenjan to take away some of the sweetness of the dish.  The chicken cubes were fork tender and the rice with the chicken and fesenjan sauce was really good food.

I opted for some Persian style baklava for dessert.  It was very good and like almost everything they serve, made in house.

Service was excellent.  My being there was appreciated by the pleasant way I was treated during the meal and when I opted to pay at the pick up window if you've ordered take out.  The chef thanked me from the kitchen for stopping in.

Its owned by a sweet couple who were more than happy to explain the menu and even showed us an example of what the meal looked like prior to us ordering. We have never had this type of cuisine before, but our waitress was wonderful in explaining everything because we had a few questions. The tea had so much flavor, and we tried the doogh drink. Its a flavor we were unfamiliar with, but it was nice to try something new. Drinks were served with sugar cubes.

Our meals were very good in size and priced accordingly. My dad ordered the stew and it had more flavor than any other we have had. It was also very hearty and had a side of rice. The number 9 was big enough to share comfortably between two adults, and it was arguably the best tasting chicken I've ever had. I wish I knew how they seasoned it.

I would highly recommend this place to a friend, and I'll probably be back to share this restaurant find with my boyfriend, since we are on a mission to try new foods this year :)

5011479,2017-09-17,0,ufmokEGxGqEWIdvIVsNg_Q,"It's almost shocking that such high-quality food and a lovely, casual setting can be hidden away in a seemingly deserted Las Vegas strip mall. In fact, this is the second great restaurant hiding in plain sight around the corner from our hounds' vet (Rainbow Animal Hospital!), the other being the also-family-owned-and-run and also-excellent Mexican restaurant Serrano's.

In this case, Aria serves delicious Persian food. I tried the non-vegetarian version of the Eggplant Gheymeh Stew. It was tasty, filling, and just what I needed. The less daring of us ordered a chicken kabob and rice, and I was surprised to find myself with extreme entree envy: the charbroiled chicken chunks were out-of-this world! I would have happily switched plates despite thoroughly enjoying my own order. I can see myself easily becoming addicted to the chicken. Based on the number of to-go orders we saw, I assume I'm not the only one.

Aria has a lot of space, and tables, for a small, family-run restaurant. The decor is simple, but warm. On Friday night, a half hour before closing, the only staff seemed to be the couple who own the place, with the woman serving, and the man cooking. They were managing the steady stream of business quite well, but given that the food is made to order, and that it's extremely well executed, Aria is more conducive to a relaxing meal rather than a quick bite.

Prices seemed quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of the dishes. It was particularly nice to get my salad fix, in this case, a Shirazi (cucumber) salad, for only $4.

As we were leaving, I noticed an inviting outdoor dining area even more tucked away than the restaurant itself. I don't know when those garden tables are open, but I can imagine having a fantastic time dining out there.",nEABfoTu6n6qvLRD2_mX1w,1,0,5,1w4F5S3449GFLh2xg_xdHg

The hubby and I shared a hummus to start. We were given just 1 pita for it, but if you need more you can get some. The lady asked us if we needed more and she brought us another warm pita. Sides are really nicely priced at $3.50 that get a few to share to make yourself some meze platter.

We both got a 1 chicken and 1 beef koobideh plate. It comes with rice, grilled pepper, grilled tomato, some onions and butter for your rice. The koobideh was pretty juicy and well seasoned. I am hit or miss with chicken ones, but theirs was solid though both the hubby and I preferred the beef kind.

We ordered one square of baklava to share. Theirs wasn't overly sweet and the nuts were toasted nicely. Not bad at all. 

The lady who was serving us was kind and a very humble and gracious type of host. 

Kebabs are one of those things where I see the prices severely swing from cheap to spendy for some ground meat and rice. This place has good quality, good portions and the prices make it for cheap eats when $10 gets you a pile of food. 

I dig it. Many good kebab spots aren't convenient to us so I'm really glad that there is something in the area were normally around.

It's fairly a small cozy restaurant, a mom and pop place with who I assume was the waitress their daughter. This is just a guess. I ordered the combo chicken and beef kabob (kubideh) the portions were good with a roasted tomato and a roasted jalepeno, it came with a chunk of raw onion which I wish was roasted like the tomato. The flavor was very good. This place was a bit more pricey compared to other persian restaurants in Las Vegas for their entrees.

I also ordered the egg plant dip, kashkeh bademjoon. It was tasty and I know a very healthy dish. It came with 2 warm pita bread but my only complaint is that it should have come with at least 3 or 4 pita bread in my opinion to finish off the dip. The bread and dip ratio was off, not enough bread for the dip. Also $2 extra charge for 2 more pita bread which I thought was a bit just for bread. When it wasnt house made.

Always interesting to sample the kabobs and get their take on this classic recipe: ground beef, onions, salt, pepper and saffron. Their koobideh is super juicy and the basmati rice is heavenly in its fluffiness. I like that their food overall is not overly salty.

The lentil soup has a tomato base that was overpowering so it tasted more like a tomato soup - good but I would not order again.

5740396,2017-06-03,0,ufmokEGxGqEWIdvIVsNg_Q,"I'm a bit conflicted, because the service was very nice, and perhaps it was just the one item I got, but the day after having the Eggplant Gheymeh Stew, I had symptoms consistent with having eaten something with sodium nitrate in it, which would suggest lower food quality. The stew tasted ok, I would say not the best Persian food that I've had but good enough to get four stars. I can't say for certain that it was the meal I had but I do think it was. I'm sure other items on the menu would work better though.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,3,Vchs7UVKxkeJOrqtEBsrPw

The food tasted homemade and was very fresh.  You know the bread is fresh because you can watch them make it! And the portions are large. I think the key is that my pickier than picky husband said he wants to come back.",1KV7dH-ZQWPWvkLpjc0ymQ,0,0,4,yZwUAocOFnsTQIFv2bhRhA
