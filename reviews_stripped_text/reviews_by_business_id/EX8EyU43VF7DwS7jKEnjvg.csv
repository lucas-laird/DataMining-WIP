He had such a sweet demeanor that made my first outing a comfortable experience.  My lunch was a peaceful one. Thanks Jayson!! 4 for $4 is a great deal, too.

The chicken sandwich is spicy, the cheese is also spicy, and they add jalapenos.  I love spicy food and it was absolutely amazingly good. 

Service was pretty fast and friendly and I am always a satisfied customer.  Hope they let this sandwich stick around for a minute so I can enjoy it again.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,4,82L3eRBpFWHUT36Pu28GHg

A few sandwiches, some fries, some chili, and 2 salads. If it's a small order they'll be fine but they didn't get anything right on the order. My sandwich, which was just a cheeseburger, came out with a bun that was as hard as a brick and some black stuff they wanted to pass as bacon. They finally took care of this but only after 15 minutes of waiting. Feel free to come if it's a small order but otherwise stay away.",uQa5X0wX5QBpuYRbkBhfTg,0,0,2,VNu9n2Jc_e62gv1SoQEkMg

This has happened around 11p and even 12a as well. This evening you could see 2 employees just standing behind the dining room cashiers counter on their phones and it's been the same guy every time since the same one car is in the parking lot.

They can magically take the same order for lunch and dinner for five days straight ""taco salad "" and every order have something missing. whether it is the chips one day. Or the salsa the same evening. It doesn't matter what day what time they can never get an order correct they magically make something disappear.

3140069,2016-02-17,1,EX8EyU43VF7DwS7jKEnjvg,So this Wendy's usually provides terrible customer service as well as the quality of food. Hence that is probably why there haven't been that many reviews on this particular one. I visited here a couple weeks ago and had an order for my co-workers as well. When I asked for the fries to be fresh I got an attitude from the girl that was taking my order all because I requested fresh ones. The chicken nuggets that are on that value menu are a joke and I even question if it's actually the 100% chicken that they advertise. Generally I stay away from fast food to avoid  all these above reasons.,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,0,1,K0l0F4Q1R8KSr3eYpojvFg
3335022,2017-10-30,0,EX8EyU43VF7DwS7jKEnjvg,"This is possibly the worst Wendy's I've ever been to. We ordered 4 jr bacon cheeseburgers, fries and 2 drinks. 

We roll up to the window, pay for our food and checked the bag to make sure everything was in there. We noticed the fries were missing so we told them. The cashier said, ""you didn't pay for fries,"" and sat there and stared. We then replied, ""well can we please order some fries?"" To which she replied, ""you will have to pay."" Which  obviously we knew that. 

We then pull away and decided to check our burgers and realized they gave us some wack cheeseburgers with no consistency. Some had pickles, some didn't, and it was thrown together.

We looked for the receipt and we didn't even get one so there was just no hope for this order. We paid $15 for those 4 sandwiches and 2 drinks.",-PXJEs_9T0lRKpssxf3otg,2,0,1,UH2N8Xgd5FTVXudf6USBlQ

Customer service is absolute crap, and even after repeating the order 3 times at the drive-up and then another two times at the first window where they take your money, one would expect that the order would be right. Of course it wasn't. So we stayed at the pickup window, hoping someone would open the window and noticed that our order was not correct. Of course not! Instead we had to knock on the window several times, finally the manager came up asked about the order, and said oh we're really sorry have a good day. No offer to fix it no offer to check out what was wrong, we had to park and walk inside to get it corrected. That took another 15 minutes.",C2b35VOxP2LhqEn90f1lyA,1,0,1,WkT3Wp1Da0-pnikos5FFZw

5529218,2011-11-05,2,EX8EyU43VF7DwS7jKEnjvg,"I'm not a fast food burger guy at all.  It's been 17 years since I actually ate a Big Mac and at least 4 years since dining at a Wendy's.  But there was a coupon in the mail for their new ""Hot 'N Juicy"" (the jokes you could start in with are endless!!) burger and we went after some pleading from the wife.

I did read in an article about how the Wendy's executives scoured the country for the top burgers, spent thousands of dollars on research and this is what they considered their best effort after a year of trials.  So I was definitely curious.

We did drive thru and ate in the car since my wife was wearing a Batgirl costume (Yelp Justice League Pub Crawl on Fremont).  Our coupon was for a free single patty Hot 'N Juicy with the purchase of a small drink and small fries.  The bill appropriately for 2 orders totaled $6.66!

The verdict: Not bad but not great either.  If you like Wendy's menu, you will most likely enjoy this.  I would prefer a Whopper if I am blowing massive amounts of calories and fat on a fast food joint.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,4,3,3,jO8Gvkb38gCx02ysAQNdrA

Went through the drive when it was not busy at all. There was only one car behind and the lady handing me my food was in such a rush. I always ask for 2 extra barbecue sauces when I get meal. The only reason I choose Wendy's over McDonald's is because I love the barbecue sauce. The lady told me I could only have one, even after I offered to pay for an extra sauce. She said sorry we don't sell extra sauce. Like is it really that serious to be so stingy with the sauce. Like I can't even pay for the sauce???
