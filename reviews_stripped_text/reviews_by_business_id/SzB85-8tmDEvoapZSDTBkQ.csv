If you want some inexpensive mexican grub, this is definitely a place to come to.  My good friend told me that this is one of her fav mexican places back when she was in san diego and i can see why...their carne asada fries were quite tasty...my only gripe is that there weren't enough fries! the amount of carne asada totally overpowered the fries.  most people will prob think i'm crazy in wanting more fries over more carne asada but when the carne asada is considered a topping for fries, i better get a generous portion of fries.  In addition to the carne asada fries, i shared a fish burrito with my sister and that was yummy! no over flowing juice action that always happens whenever i eat burritos, where you feel sauce dripping down your hands and arms like waterfalls.  it had the right amt of liquid sauce as well as veggies and generous portions of fried fish.  As for my friend's fiance's chicken burrito, that was all chicken...so much so to the point that he said he couldn't think about eating chicken for a whole week! haha....so definitely come here to try the carne asada fries and definitely come here if you LOVE meat., otherwise, the amt of meat they give you may be a bit overwhelming.",nwHfqyK41oLvp_R0WkCA1Q,2,3,4,nwEVAgalMnW7en8e6vYCpg

Empty. Totally empty. The girl at the counter: blank. Total deer in headlights. No hello. No acknowledgement. Just a blank stare. 

Having never eaten here before and not being familiar with the menu, I strained my neck looking at the ceiling trying to decipher the menu. Then to wall on the right. 

I ordered my 3 rolled tacos with sour cream. She asked beef or chicken & I asked which was better...yeah, I got nothing. I really wanted her opinion & she just stared right through me. Completely non friendly, empty, emotionless. 

When I returned to my office I opened the box & saw nothing but cheese & sour cream. Okay, in we go. Bit into the first roll & here's what's odd; the ends completely hot & crispy, the innards cold. 

I was so hungry I didn't care. 

Until after I was done eating and I did. My stomach would not digest this mess. 4 hours later & it's still sitting there. 

Never again will I sacrifice hunger for nastiness, or $3.73.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,7,0,2,ok7XMAdr_dSw1nDOj7Okow

I've eaten at many of the pricey restaurants both on and off of the strip throughout the city because I always get a rental car to make sure I can get around to where I want to go.  I was in the mood for some Mexican food so decided to yelp it to see what was around.   Roberto's had the best reviews and it's no wonder why.  This was the best meal I've ever eaten in Vegas and definitely the best Mexican food I have ever eaten anywhere, with decent sit down restaurants costing 3 times as much for the same items included!!  I got a carne asada burrito and my wife got a chicken quesadilla and both items were unbelievably tasty!!

How can French fries make a burrito taste so much better?! The only thing I thought was ridiculous was the price to add sour cream. It's $1.10 just for sour cream!! $1.10 is just a little excessive I think .30 would be more reasonable. Not going to lie tonight I am planning on going to get my burrito then putting sour cream on it when I get home. :) when I die I hope these California burritos are in heaven and that it doesn't cost to add sour cream :),OVPa8yztKitfPq9Vw-PSJQ,0,0,4,D8dc8986fVamCLNW9HnYqw

Unlike crazy Grace C. who complained about them having too much meat, I welcome it with open arms.  I love their Carne Asada fries.  Whoever thought about putting juicy carne asada on top of fries is a genius!  Since moving back to LA, whenever I craved the fries I have to resort to going to Alberto's.  It's not bad, but it's not Roberto's.  The meat they use at Alberto's is sOo dry and veiny.  It's not just the most pleasant taste, but when you got a craving, you gotta satisfy it. 

We ordered the Carne Asada Fries, which were good.  Could use a bit more fries, but nonetheless just as satisfying as before... besides better more meat than hardly any!  It's all about getting your money's worth. The chicken burrito was juicy!  Large pieces of chicken, no beans, no rice...  just plain delicious!

First, let me say I like the set up of the serve yourself salsa bar.  I like that they have three kinds of salsa and that lovely melange of spicy carrots and onions .  That was the highlight.  The food left me disappointed.  I ordered:

1. 3 Rolled Chicken Tacos- they were the skinniest, hardest, blandest things I tried to eat.  I had them add guac to go on top.  I stopped after eating one and a half.  They were sad.  And that ""guac""?  Someone ought to be arrested selling that as guac.  It was like eating sour cream with green food coloring.  
2.  Steak Tacos - I have never had steak tacos so bland.  I doused them with the tomatillo sauce giving it much needed help.

The only thing that tasted fresh and was hot?

3.  Cheese Quesadilla - imagine that.  A simple quesadilla was the only thing I finished and enjoyed.

Roberto's is around the corner from the house and it is opened for 24 hours. For a person on the edge of starvation at 3:30am, this was the perfect spot.

There are pros and there are cons just like everywhere else, but my experience seriously split my decision right in the middle.

Price:
Really cheap in price. I would even compare some of the items to fast food prices. I paid less than 4 dollars for a chicken burrito and 5 dollars for a torta de asada.

Speed and Service:
Standard service and attitude. I didn't expect a burst of excitement at 3:30am but I do appreciate them not being sluggish and distant. Food was given to me quickly. By the time I packed my sauces, the food was ready and I was on my way.

Food Quality and Quantity:
As you would expect from the low prices, nothing is ever too good to be true. The very affordable prices start to reflect onto my meal as I sink my teeth into the burrito. Oh what a shame that the first bite just happened to be the worst. The entire burrito was bland and unbelievably dry! What I did enjoy was the fact that it was completely stuffed with chicken. If it wasn't for the lime and salsa, I wouldn't have finished it (but in all honesty, I would have because Im a human dumpster when it comes to finishing food). Now the (Carne Asada) torta was pretty good. It tasted like my expectations and there wasn't anything wrong with it. It also wasn't the best I've had, but I would reorder it for sure.

Overall, not my first recommendation during the day time but it gets a ""sure, why not"" as the hours pass into late-night.",BwVuXyUaB5vk3l6upF3GrQ,1,1,3,iuEEQSj3qaYumZta1jMwZw

I've heard a lot of hype about Roberto's food (A LOT), so I had high expectations trying it for the first time. 

We ordered a breakfast burrito and a chicken taco & chicken enchilada plate (#6). The best part of the burrito was the homemade tortilla. The rest was nothing extraordinary. The enchilada was good, with lots of meat, and a very tasty red sauce. The taco was okay, but I liked the fluffy shredded cheese they used. The beans were not great, and I love good beans. The rice was okay. The red chili was good (and reminds me a lot of the sauce at my favorite taco truck in LA). The green was okay.

The shop has a drive-thru which is appealing if I lived in Vegas. I'd definitely use that when I want to be fat and lazy. Inside the shop, you have to play Goldilock & the Three Bears, and try all of the tables to find one that isn't crooked. I like the posters on the wall of the story of Roberto's.

I've heard it's 24 hours-but I never usually hit it up other than normal work hours. Let's keep the long story short. Roberto's is basically a mainstay in Las Vegas and located all over the place. They have specials everyday of the week I believe, but I never take advantage of them. There drive through is always full so I opt to go inside and order and take my time eating. 

Basic seating, basic decoration, almost a fast food feel to them. 

But man, there Carne' Asada burrito never leaves me hungry and I have to loosen my belt notch a few notches after I eat it. If I finish it all in one sitting (which I usually do) I want to go to sleep in my comfy cubicle chair for the rest of the day. Doesn't help at work. Haha!

Anyway, do yourself a favor and get sour cream extra inside of it. The standard pico de gallo and verde sauce is good, and I love watching all the people cram all the free carrots and cucumbers into little baggies like there gonna run out (which they do sometimes as your standing there.) 

Always leave full & happy, with only a few bucks out of my wallet. I can't speak too much for the other items on the menu, I'm pretty partial to my Steak!

In various areas of Vegas lies a hole in the wall place called Roberto's taco shop. It's small, the waiters hardly speak English, and the kitchen is spotless.

My friends, Sheila and Kim, went to grab a few tacos for lunch. I haven't tried Mexican food since arriving to Vegas in fear of the terrible stomach pains legendary of cheap taco places. I decided to take the jump and ordered some need tacos and nachos with cheese. Being naïve, I expected taco bell portions. To my surprise, I was wrong.

Roberto's is a great place to grab authentic Mexican food. Shredded need or chicken in a freshly fried homemade taco shell and killer salsa verde, it was the best I've ever had since guam. Their nachos have fresh cheese melted on them, and the portions are huge.

Take time to visit the small places. Like Roberto's' you'l find amazing places to eat. I give them my personal 5 out of 5 stars.

We went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.

Cheap, greasy, delicious food was available at nearly all hours of the day.

On this visit, we picked up a couple of orders of rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, a quesadilla, and a couple of carne asada tacos.  The restaurant was incredibly clean, and the staffers were friendly, even at 10 pm on a Saturday night.

The food is DECENT at best. It's food, it's not bad, but it's definitely not authentic.

Shredded cheddar cheese in the main ingredient in this establishment. It's topped on everything, placed in everything. And usually stays like that. Cold.

In both my enchilada and my friends quesadilla the cheese was not melted completely. Still chunks of cold cheese. 

You can tell almost of their products are packaged or canned, with the exception of the salsa bar. They make the pickled veggies and salsas. The chips are relatively fresh, not stale.

Not super cheap like it is in California. It's a little outdoor type joint where you order outside and take it with you (or sit on the little chairs and tables around the gas station).

I seem to order the same thing whenever I go which is a breakfast burrito hold the meat with sour cream added. Despite the fact I have them take out the meat, they still charge me at least a $1 extra for the sour cream. ""No substitutions."" The potatoes are ALWAYS hard and uncooked. Don't know why I keep ordering this burrito. I have tried it for the last time and won't be getting it again. Sigh.

Tried the fish burrito and it was a fried type of fish, like a fish stick. Ug. I've had seriously KICK BUTT burritos in SoCal and wonder if I will ever find a replacement for the nicely seasoned soft grilled fish they use in theirs. 

The bean and cheese burrito is a good bargain for $2.50. 

Their rice is good. 

Portions are pretty good. Not too big.

There is not any other way to order the food except for stand in line outside the gas station while all the people walk past you, in and out of the doors to the shop. 

I guess this is sort of a desperation type of Mexican place for me since there is such a limited amount of places to eat in the area.

Short story:
Got charged for 3 large horchatas and received 2 smalls. No receipt.
Awful service.

Got off work late and decided to grab a quick bite for me and a friend, ordered Carne Asada fries and a carne asada burrito, with a large horchata. Pulled up to the window, cashier says it's $34. I say ""no way, I only got fries and a burrito, and horchata"" she said ""no you ordered 3 fries, 3 burrito."" After telling her I didn't order that she takes my money. Gives me my food with no receipt. My friend then decides she wants an horchata as well, since there was literally nobody in the store or in the drive thru line, I ask if I can add another large horchata. She takes my $20. Charges me for 2 large horchatas (even though I already paid for 1 large), hands me my drinks and I drive off. After I leave the parking lot I see that the 2 drinks were actually smalls! Which means I paid for 3 large horchatas and received 2 smalls.
My friend noticed her putting bills into the tip jar behind the window, so we're pretty sure she used what was supposed to be my change as a tip FOR HER AWFUL SERVICE.

Roberto's is the place to go for late night Mexican food. Plus, everything is decently priced. I will definitely be back.

I recommend anyone to give this taco shop a try. If you don't know what to order, try any of the following:

-Three Rolled Tacos
-Carne Asada Burrito
-Anything with Carnitas

Enjoy!",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,2,1,4,tKgPGD3QWS2NAtVITIW_VA

They wear gloves when handling your food you paid for, that is stellar service. The Robertos i went to on South Eastern is awesome as well, I think better but I live on the west side of Vegas so this gets my review. The Robertos on Owens is terrible and ghetto.

Great place, freshness everywhere! Fresh Pepsi products! From the jalapenos/carrots/onions bathing in the vinegar spiced juices to the tortilla and the innards of any burrito you want, everything is immaculate, polite staff, everything is clean minus the graffiti. I've had all burritos from Bean and Cheese to Carne Asada(I'll go further down the menu later down the road), AWESOME. They're the most expensive I have ever paid for a great place (big tacos $2.75 with meat, pico, guac) but ""F"" it, it's quality. Pure quality, love it. I dig this place over Del taco and Taco Bell for mexican food. I've been to a few other places but Robertos always hits the spot. Quality. That is what spells Robertos.

P.S. They have$1 chicken tacos every wednesday which are awesome as hell. Add sour cream, cold pepsi, jalapenos and carrot slices in the vinegar juices and OMFG...

I always come here, the only time I don't is when they don't wear gloves. If anybody doesn't wear gloves touching my food or I can't see the cooks wearing gloves handling my money in the kitchen, that restuarant doesn't get my business, i shouldn't have to lick cooks hands. So what if people don't like rules, don't make a career out of a fast food job you don't like. You don't like working there, piss off!",j7SH8LM1L8eExP2AO71UbA,1,0,4,i_LwDetfelrii98EqLlSxw

This is my Roberto's of choice. When the trifecta of hunger occurs (ie. hungry, lazy and cheap) I head to this particular Roberto's. I always know I'm going to get something delicious for a good deal. 

My favorites include their chicken quesadilla, carne asada fries, California burrito, rolled tacos or breakfast burritos, You can't really go wrong and there's usually a Roberto's on every other corner in town, so it's convenient and a safe bet. 

Now I'm craving a taco. ;-)",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,1,5,qxWe2cotdfODDIPqbGN4xA
5961733,2018-05-31,0,SzB85-8tmDEvoapZSDTBkQ,My carne asada fries were ice cold. The meat was over cooked and has been sitting. The cheese is rock hard. The fries themselves were white and contained a crunch not from cooking but from actually being raw. All in all the worst carne fries I've ever had. And I will not be returning to this robertos as they have showed me the quality of food they are willing to give their paying customers.,TJhffxixuC7MCNaaXNghmg,2,0,1,9INQHTovTTxgCedsUxRStQ
