She continued to smile and gave us everything we needed. I usually have too ask for condiments but not thus time, she was on top of everything. I wish I would've got her name so that I could give her a shout out.",xw98JcKxaBukMFszPf7CHw,0,0,4,D6AhVSM-obzjcHGH5sNfrg

I go in and was told I ordered off the lunch menu and it was my fault.   I order breakfast produced my receipt.   The employee was so rude and I asked for my money back.   Employee became very sarcastic and told me to have a good day when I said I was speaking to corporate.

A young black girl attempted to overcharge me at the counter for a whopper and when I questioned the amount and asked to speak to a MANAGER a very LARGE Black woman with a serious attitude came to the counter and claimed the POSTED menu price was not the correct price but she would give me a discount. The ground beef patty was cold and sandwich was the sloppiest mess (2 tomatoes on top of one another, rubber pickles, brown lettuce and a smashed bun inside of crumpled paper) I have ever been served. The fries were HEAVILY SALTED. The ICE machine was empty and the ketchup dispenser was empty. The MENS restroom trash can was overflowing and smelled bad. The receipt with my survey code on it was NOT LEGIBLE so I could not report this to their customer service area. I am a former Burger King customer and will never visit this location again while the current workers are allowed to continue working there. These young girls working here think it is cute to giggle and laugh about a service problem instead of taking care of their business and serving the customer good food.",obh_TyCsw4papDmBZRHDmw,0,0,1,_uHAef24PyfVKN_jCOW06g

We reached the second window to collect our order when we decided to add to our order. The employee was understanding & rang us up right away. The assistant manager opened the window and proceeded to yell at us telling us that next time we need to order from the speaker box. We had no problem jumping back in line but her approach was highly unacceptable. We stayed at the window to ask for cooperates number, with her demeanor we started recording, she continued to be rude and say she didn't have cooperates number, she got off at midnight if we wanted to handle this a diff way. Tried saying she was trying to explain the ordering process once she saw us recording but that is definitely NOT what she was doing. We ended up looking up cooperates number and filing a formal complaint. But this is beyond a negative review for this place. 
On top of the ""assistant manager and her professionalism"" she was very disrespectful to the employee at the window, yelling at him with her hands flying everywhere and neck rolling in front of customers. 
Just looked at other reviews for this location and it's hard to see why they haven't terminated such a person working in customer service. Something she lacks 100%.",UyGux56XENlRwBuGcHoBAg,1,0,1,h8VgyJYUEkeWvWixO8IDpw

We just went to the drive-thru at this Burger King and the girl (Ashley) was so rude. We started to place our order and immediately she cuts us off and doesn't listen. We had to pull up to the window to place the order. Once we got to the window, she huffed and puffed the whole time and threw us attitude. Our order was thrown into the bag, the burgers were spilled out of the wrappers and the onion rings weren't even full. Both orders were half empty. Once we got home, we called back and asked for a manager. Whoever answered the phone wouldn't tell us who they were and hung up on us. They then called us back to harass us and blame us for the hang up. 

I will never go back to this location. Calls have been put into the corporate office. Will update once we see what they are going to do.",JEdU91t2ucPw-e__2eXnfg,2,0,1,FK1MkPYFoiDKpHMpmGMSoQ

It is located in a super congested area with many stores right next to thrift shop. And they have a special right now that was only supposed to last for 1 weekend are you buy 1 whopper and get 1 free. Jema took my order and she was extremely sweet and pleasant. It was very nice of her to take the time to understand the order because the last time I went to Burger King what is a very unpleasant experience. Mind you, I haven't been to burger king in at least 6 years or more, so this is a very important trip.


Yeah, but my order still wasn't exactly right. So much for the "" have it your way""  mantra. I suppose it has changed to ""you'll eat at I give you""",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,1,1,3,3FgKhsQ0sp-kjyKM-Y0Z9A

The server: Roshay, was not friendly at all, has no sense of courtesy (no smiles or thank you's) and does not seem like she is enjoying her job. Along with her negative tone, I asked for ranch and napkins but she immediately closed the window and acted like she didn't hear me when I knew my voice was loud enough for her to hear. When I did get her attention 20 secs later to ask for ranch and napkins, in a very bad tone, Roshay explained and charged me an extra $0.27 cents. Because it's lunch time and I was very hungry, I took out my credit card, and paid $0.27 for one piece of ranch. This is the very very first time I've been charged for ranch and this is the very very first time I've gone through a drive thru without the server saying anything before I pressed the gas pedal, just silence. Very negative vibe. I understand that it may be very busy during lunch, but getting a negative vibe before eating should not happen to anyone, it makes the food taste bad and you lose most of your appetite.",GMKqYOAEOuv3-yHDBAphaw,0,0,1,j5cw_brzAnlKmndMjlBk1w
5254292,2018-03-15,0,nteAMOsI2DsTTR9v6G9E7A,"So I was in a hurry earlier today and was looking for something fast and stopped at Burger King. It has been over 10 years since I been there. My expectations were not very high. I figured a few bites of a whopper to hold me over for a few hours. Well, as I bit into the burger I was simply amazed at the taste of the whopper. Best fast food burger I have had, emphasize on fast food. If I knew that this would be the norm, I would go there more often. Service was average, which is ok. Ordered food, paid for food, got food. 

Management team, figure out what you did today at about 330 pm and keep it up.
