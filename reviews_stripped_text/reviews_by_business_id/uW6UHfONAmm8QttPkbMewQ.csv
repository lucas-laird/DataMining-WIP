I ordered the Mixed Plate: Furikake Chicken and Chicken Katsu with brown rice and mac salad (my friend ordered the fried rice, I am getting that next time). IT WAS THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN TOWN! Now, typically when I consume that much food all I want to do is go home and lay on the couch until it digests.... Boy was I wrong!!!! I found myself not even wanting to leave. After attempting to eat all of our food (it was huge). We decided if we wanted to stay and watch the rest of the performance it was only necessary to try some dessert. Well, we couldn't narrow it down to just one, so we tried 4 different desserts. We ordered the Chantilly Cake, Guava Cake, Haupia Cake, and the Coco Puffs! We couldn't decide if the Chantilly or the Guava was our favorite, but they were all delicious.

169553,2010-11-14,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"As others have mentioned this review is long overdue!  

Hubby and I have been here several times and it is one of the friendliest restaurants I have ever been to - the service is amazing and you feel like you are your server's only customers even though everytime we have been there the place is rockin' and packed!  

Unfortunately I tried L&L before coming here and that experience almost made me not try this wonderful little gem in the southwest.  I know... lumping L&L to all Hawaiian restaurants would be like comparing McDonalds to In-n-Out - my mistake :)

I love the traditional Loco Moco - the gravy is like a culinary orgasm and the eggs are always cooked perfectly!  The hamburger patty is always moist and juicy and the seasoning is perfect too!  It is mind blowing...  Plus they provide so much food (with a side of the best mac salad I've ever had) each time I have had to take over half home with me (and it is just as amazing the next day!)

Hubby gets something different each and every time and he has always been very pleased (and too busy mmmmming to talk much during our meals there!)

Make sure you grab some of their amazing banana nut bread when you are leaving - you will be way too full to have some during your visit...

I was thinking while I was writing this that I should keep my mouth shut and not share my experience - this restaurant may be even more crowded my next visit and when Loco Moco is calling my name - I do not want to wait any longer than absolutely necessary!",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,1,1,5,slzP4d3xBHXbsqNvgJK1Pg
177405,2014-07-20,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Its probably a lucky thing for me that this place is on the opposite side of town, because otherwise I might live here. I spent 20 years in Hawai'i, and I know my Hawaiian BBQ, and this is as good as the best I've had in Hawai'i and by far the best outside of it. 
The portions are heavy, they use great quality cuts of meat (not like the fatty gristly cheap stuff you too often find), and they serve with Aloha. My absolute favorite is the beef teriyaki steak which is always perfectly done. My girlfriend loves the fried poke salad, which I often share with her, and is truly great. If you're able to manage dessert after eating all of that, the Guava cake is definitely worth trying. 

Now aside from being the best Hawaiian BBQ in town, they truly live Aloha. I wont give all the details other than to say that yesterday I went there, and despite a bad situation (which had nothing to do with the restaurant) the management showed me an act of kindness that blew my mind.

214325,2015-02-01,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"We were interested in finally trying Island Flavor, so I arrived here in a party of three one weekend. We stood waiting at the front without being noticed for who knows how long. The cashier woman and the three servers went about their business acting unaware we were there. Not one glance and not a single 'Hi, just a moment please' or 'Have you been helped yet?' (you know, those simple phrases that every other restaurant uses to greet incoming customers?). After standing idle up there for an indefinite period of time we were miraculously sat down. 

So we quickly ordered realizing things would take forever if we didn't take action immediately. The food was good and they do give you fairly large portions for what you pay for. However, the restaurant's bizarre ongoing neglectful behavior ensued. As we were eating, another party sat down next to us and I witnessed as all three servers took turns coming by this table to give their happy undivided attention within a brief time span while we were barely serviced by our lone server during our entire stay. We thought of trying the Chantilly Cake, but after realizing what we'd have to put up with we just decided to pay. After not being able to get someone's attention again (even when calling out!) we got up, paid at the cash register, then drove off to find dessert elsewhere.   

From the moment we walked in to the moment we left it felt like we weren't wanted there and the people working could care less. When I read through Island Flavor's other one-star reviews on Yelp I found out that those people's experiences were very similar to mine. I don't understand this restaurant. It's like they deliberately ignore and sacrifice certain customers just so they can give everybody else the VIP Hawaiian treatment. Okay fine, I don't really expect to be given the same amount of attention the regulars get, but when it gets to a point that they start ignoring the basics of simple service (just to prioritize some customers over others) then that's not right. 

For those of you who were able to enjoy yourselves and give this place a glowing review, I hate and envy you very much.",kYqYJ7L-JFitKgNpzmd_Tw,4,0,1,e5TaNLG75QXYrlx0qftXIw

221445,2016-04-18,2,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I REALLY wanted to like this place. I even tried it twice to make sure they weren't just having an off day or something. I'm actually pretty annoyed that furikake chicken is under their ""review highlights"" because that must mean it's a popular dish, which is weird to me. I LOVE furikake. Seriously, if you put furikake on anything, I'm bound to love it. I was really disappointed with this chicken though... Again, I tried the same dish twice. 

Both times I tried the chicken, it was overcooked and dry. This is why I don't understand how it's such a popular dish. You must all have pretty low standards for food, I guess. 

I'm from Hawaii and I love finding all of the Hawaiian places around town to try, but this place did NOT satisfy. Maybe I should try some of their other menu items??? A little scared though because any restaurant that can't cook chicken properly is automatically sus to me. This dish just isn't right and they need to re-evaluate the execution of it.

This doesn't taste like food back home. I tried a lot of things on their menu and everything but desserts disappointed. Their desserts don't count since most of them are baked by Andrea's World of Cakes?

Roast Pork: Where's the meat? Why is there so much fat? 

Chicken Katsu: Why is it burnt? 

Korean Chicken: Where's the spice? Why is there chicken fuzz still on it? Eeewww!

Kalbi/Short Ribs: Why so stingy and too sweet?

Portuguese Sausage: What is that weird after taste? 

Lau Lau: Why is it so dry? Almost like shredded wet cardboard. 

Furikake Shrimp: What's so special about breaded fried shrimp with furikake sprinkles on it? Come on, lets get more creative here.

Loco Moco & Hamburger Steak: Sure, it's big but why is it so bland? 

Mac Salad: No, no. (shaking my head) So salty. 

Spam Musubi: How can you sell cold musubi left for hours on the counter? 

Kikoman ""cheap stuff"" soy sauce? You know everyone back home favors Aloha Shoyu!

There was a wait and there is no where for a waiting party to sit, so we had to go outside abs stand or sit in the car. 

The decor.....well there's no decor or even an attempt at one. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall and it shows for it. 

Food was good, the Chicken Katsu a bit flavorless but still good. The Portuguese Bean Soup tasted more like Pork and Beans from a can, it was just ok. 

Eating in freezing temperatures is not fun and the servers weren't the friendliest.

I always get the Ahi Poke with a scoop of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. It's very good, but on September 25 approximately 3:15pm, their credit card system was down. I had called in advance to place my order since I was not going to dine in. When I told the younger lady if I needed to pay with cash since the front of the door had a sign that said ""cash only"", she said yes. I informed her that I was not told that on the phone. She then proceeded on telling me that I could go to the gas station nearby and use their ATM ..I said no it's going to charge me, I'm not doing that. 

The whole time she did not apologize at the fact that I drove far and they didn't tell me it was cash only at that time . She then said, ""I'll try"" with an attitude. The card went through. She got the receipt for me to print and after I signed it she went to get the food, brought it back, and walked away. The whole time no ""here you go"" ""thank you"" ""I apologize"" nothing. 

Sad thing is that I would go very often and witnessed so many other issues. One day a group of three ordered their food and it took forever and they purposely left the food intact as soon as it arrived and left. 

The first time I went, they took 30 minutes to serve us and it was the wrong order. 

I really wanted to give it a shot because of their food, but trust me, some of the people that work there will not smile or serve you well unless you are Hawaiian. 

Also, be careful when you order ahi poke, they don't tell you they have an option of half a pound. They will always give you the full pound.

I have never ever finished and entree there.

For starters they have the best Poke' in town that come in different seasoning, Furikake and Shoyu, Sorry I forgot the other flavor. But all our good just depends on which you like better. I recommend sharing this though tis too much for one person, well at least to me.

I have tried every dish, and all are great. no joke. The have the best roast pork loco moco in town. It's like a loco mock, but no hamburger meat just lots of tender pork. They're loco mock is also bomb with huge serving. The kalbi ribs and korean chicken wings are so delicious, like finger licking good. I think they're fired rice is the best in town because it gives me flash back of my childhood, when my aunt first cooked and served me the first time i ever ate friend rice. Like that critic from ratatouille, when he took a bite and he remembered his mom making it for him. haha If you can ever make it on fridays nights, they have the best LauLau to me in town, this dish really reminds me for hawaii. I wasn't born in Hawaii but i do go there yearly, so this food is as good as it gets to hawaiian dishes.

Lastly, if you can save room for deserts. They are all great,a dn from what i heard they are made by the bakery next door to it. You must eat Huapia cake and Chantilly cake, I would say a slice but they way they serve slices, its like a small cake. haha

First off I have to say that the portions here are HUGE!!!! So come hungry or be prepared to share or take a doggy bag home.  The mixed plate comes with your choice of two items off the menu, along with 2 scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I've had the Portuguese bean soup, the Kahlua pork and cabbage, the Hawaiian style roast pork, and the chicken Katsu, and all were delicious.  Both times the pork has been done perfectly, tender and still juicy, which was a nice surprise.  I also liked the brown gravy that they served the roast pork with, it added just the right amount of richness to the dish.  I've also tried the lomi lomi salmon, and it was tasty too, but I'm just not a huge fan of salmon so I didn't think that much of it overall.

The service here is great, and the ladies, when they're not run off their feet, are happy to chat with you, and play do we know anyone in common from back on the islands.

Just a little disappointed that we saw 3 tables empty but they couldn't seat us.  They just didn't have enough servers to actually accomodate the people.  All the servers were stressed, kept running around.  Nevertheless, food came out great.  It was as good as we expected and yes, oxtail soup craving satisfied.  DH had the kalbi and steak combo and it looked more like a family meal to us.  Furikake chicken and poke bowl was bomb.  I'd come back definitely, but probably at an odd time next time.

I guess compared to Aloha Kitchen or L&L they might be decent.  What is also bs is that the first time I did not get mac salad.  So the next time I ordered it as a side thinking this was an add on, but later find out that it was supposed to come with the meal.  Portion sizes are big?  Huge portion sizes of crap.  You do not have to be from Hawaii to rate this place as good or bad.  Apparently they are popular, but the food sucks.

Pork Loco Moco - Pork was dried out to the point of cardboard.  Gravy bland and tasteless.

Loco Moco - Whatever they used for the burger was the cheapest ground beef you will ever see.  Looked and tasted like ground up cat food.

Poke - What kind of Hawaiian serves pre-frozen cheap Ahi for poke?

Fried Rice - This was a joke, mushy rice with some sauce mixed in.  Even the egg and sausage didn't help.  

Portuguese Bean Soup - Mediocre, tomato soup with too much flour, no smokiness, very disappointing.  

Lau Lau - Dried out and tasteless, might as well get the same frozen one from L&L because it is cheaper.

SERVICE - ""Oh my God this is great""",t3dxO3Y0MMfdqcaVYfeUPA,3,1,1,50ycGSm4x6YVFcyxMM0lYA

Me: ""You know! Like kalbi. WIth macaroni salad.""
My mom: ""What else?""
Me: ""Uhh, chicken teriyaki. With macaroni salad.""
My mom: ""Is that it?""
Me: ""Well they have some unique things. They have something called Kalua pork. It comes with macaroni salad too."" 

So I'm going to be completely honest. I don't even totally know what Hawaiian food consists of. I stopped by once to get lunch to go and ordered a 2-item combo with Kalua pork and tonkatsu. I really appreciated that you could substitute white rice for brown at no additional charge. 

The joint's in what looks like a deserted strip mall and the windows are extra tinted to the point where you're not sure if you're in Detroit or southwest Las Vegas, so I'm not ever sure if it's open or not. Either way, it's good to know we have some dining options in our neck of the woods.

Food was simply AMAZING! This place will not let you down and I definitely will be back!

KOREAN CHICKEN: I HiGhLy recommend the Korean Chicken. Although this place is Hawaiian based, do NOT be discouraged by the word 'Korean' on the menu you will NOT be disappointed. The Korean Chicken is coated fried chicken wings with some flavorful meat that will burst in your mouth! I kid you not my first bite was over the top! 

FURIKAKE SHRIMP: I also tried the shrimp which was part of my plate combo...It was also pretty good but nothing to rave about.. I think I'll stick to my tempura shrimp at the Japanese restaurants. But do not be discouraged about trying it I am extremely picky when it comes to shrimp!

TERIYAKI CHICKEN: It was also pretty good although I'm not too much of a fan of teri chicken in general. I personally get tired of it easily after a few bites. You need not worry about the flavor here as well, the teriyaki sauce is glazed with generous amounts all over and the portions once again are tremendous.

PORK WON TONS: Pretty good way to start off the meal although not necessary because you will be full by any of the plates that you order. Pretty much your typical fried won ton complimented with the sweet chili sauce that kicked it up a notch.

MAC SALAD: ehh the mac salad was nothing special to me I've definitely had better.

So what we gonna have DESSERT or disaster?

Dessert was definitely not a disaster... the portions are very generous in this aspect as well... definitely something to share.

MANGO ICE CREAM: Hmm couldn't know how to describe this but it being mango ice cream. It's so hard to pin point what I can compare this to because any mango ice cream I've ever tried is always so different in taste, yet always delicious. It came with about 3-4 scoops of ice cream.

KONA COFFEE PIE: This delectable dessert was great! Especially me being a fan of coffee ice cream... the slice was huge and the consistency of the ice cream was perfect. 

TROPICAL ICE TEA: Just to warn you all this is unsweetened. However, on my second refill I asked for 1/2 raspberry ice tea + 1/2 tropical ice tea= an EXCELLENT combo... not too sweet not too bland I would definitely get the same for when I come back!",OVlCNcpgFJgyu2ngnBkKUQ,1,0,5,SfbxGeE8LKWcR9jNRgqC_g

I have eaten here many times with co-workers and have always enjoyed the food.  I brought my family (party of 6) and ate, then paid the bill and left.  It wasn't until the next day that I noticed that they had put an 18% automatic gratuity on my check...the waitress didn't point it out to me when she brought me the check, and I even had problems with the machine so had to try to put it in multiple times while she stood there and still no comment about the added gratuity.  My fault for not looking first, but I am very rarely charged an automatic gratuity for 6 people and I would know because we eat out quite a bit.  So I ended up paying a 40% tip - sorry, the service is not that great.

I had forgotten my credit card so went back the next day to get it and when I brought it up they said there wasn't anything they could do about it since the bill had already been run the previous day.  Not cool.

This place is one of the better Hawaiian restaurants we have here in Vegas. When I lived on that side of town I would frequent often because of the thick and juicy Kalbi ribs and big portions. Now that I live further away I get their food delivered from roadrunner.com. 

My favorites are definitely the oxtail soup, although the flavor isn't consistent. Some days it can be the best oxtail soup I've ever had, and other days not as tasty. Again, they make my favorite Kalbi by far. Their spam musubis are great because they add Furikake to them. Their dessert portions are huuuuuge and delicious especially the guava and chantilly cake. 

The Kahlua Pork and the Roast pork are definitely not one of their better dishes. They both lack flavor that I come to expect from hawaiian food and a little on the dry side. 

Other than that, I really don't think you can leave this place hungry and anything on the menu. Oh and I forgot to mention, you can get brown rice instead of white. But we all know Hawaiian food always tastes much better with sticky white rice !",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,0,0,4,WyPs4Zl8K15J7IQ9WYdtZg

Just under 10 miles from my house.  The storefront had blacked out windows and I thought they were closed. Went inside and was blown away by the heat! It had to be over 90 degrees in there! Oh well hope my order doesn't take too long. Decided on Kalbi ribs and Teriyaki chicken. Also got an order of banana bread pudding and haupia cake. The portions were large. Both plates came with 2 scoops of rice and macaroni salad. Rice is rice and Mac salad was okay.. Kind of bland though. The Kalbi had great flavor ( I should know .. I'm Korean) but could've been a little more tender and was a little too fatty. I think the highlight was the chicken. They were super flavorful , tender and so juicy!!! The bread pudding was enough for 4 people and pretty yummy. The haupia cake was to die for !!! All in all I was pretty happy and would go again and try some other items on their menu.

1051028,2017-06-11,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"As a fellow local Hawaiian boy I can confirm that this place really gives a taste of home. I came to Island Flavor when it first opened, back when they had a huge bar in the middle of the restaurant. I met the owner and his wife, they were lovely people and it's good to see that their restaurant is so popular now and I am absolutely thrilled for them. 

Don't go spending your money at L&L or some other poor example of Hawaiian food. And I say that not only because Island Flavor hits the spot but because we need to support local businesses!! Not to mention, you get way more bang for you buck here. Would you really spend $10 at L&L when you can spend $5 more here and get literally triple the quantity than what they would serve at L&L. 

The restaurant is very clean, extremely family friendly and family oriented, and on Fridays they even have live music!!! The restaurant's lighting can be kinda dim and bothersome sometimes, but it's nothing too big to complain about. They even recently expanded and opened up a shop next door that sells all my favorite Hawaiian candies and snacks! 

Lastly, I love their mixed plates! It comes with two scoops of rice (with your choice of brown, white, or fried), mac salad, and your two choices of meats. The portion of the mixed plate is so big that it's enough to feed two people! I always get the furikake chicken and hamburger steak.

The waitresses are nice and attended to me 3-4 times. The ""big one"" has a strong Hawaiian vernacular which I liked

THE GOOD: Better roasted pork then most other hawaiian places, covered with gravy loco moco style while other Hawaiian restaurants actually use hamburger patties for their loco moco. I prefer this roasted pork, reminds me of turkey and gravy and will PUT YOU TO SLEEP - I saw someone on here complaining about it being mostly fat - He must've gotten the bottom of the barrel because mine was mostly meat with only 1-2 pieces of fat - HUGE Portions - bring a toothpick ;)

The Souyou chicken is like a bowl with ACTUAL chicken breast and leg pieces in the soupy teriyaki-like thick broth. Not too sweet which is good cause teriyaki can make or break a dish... teriyaki taste was perfect, not too sweet, not too salty - This was on special because it was thursday and it was $9 by itself - but the waitress was kind enough to suggest i get the mix plate with that on it instead which was only $13 (before drink(s) - the chicken skin fat was ACTUALLY EDIBLE... unlike L&L BBQ which is veiny, super fat and makes me gag. Great food period

The mac and rice were decent but nothing to brag about

THE BAD: The ""Tropical flavor"" ice tea was disappointing because I was expecting something NICE - it was REALLY just passionfruit ice tea and it was bland and not even sweet. I had to add a couple Splenda packs to make it good

All-in-all I would highly recommend this place. It may seem pricey but the portion size will leave you stuffed and makes it well worth the money - You could NOT eat all day, then eat one $14 meal here and be stuffed.",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,0,0,5,QtBCybgJW7LSRUViUKGdEQ

I ended up throwing both food always which costs me  at least 16$. It was so bad. Don't go here, they rush your food. And the place looks so ghetto and small. Tables and chairs, decor so outdated.

$12 for a combo plate with two diff types of meats. (meals come with 2 scoops of rice (they have brown rice), & a scoop of macaroni salad. I tried the furikake chicken X kalbi short ribs. Short ribs were good, not chewy & not too fatty. Chicken was a little on the sweet side but super crispy.
$9 chicken katsu loco moco. I had the gravy put on the side so my chicken was super crispy. 
$14 furikake ahi tuna. Fresh & big chunks. Flavoring was really good but just a little too smokey.

Hoisin Glazed Ribs - Good but a little extra saucy. The ribs fell off the bone and is great with the rice.
Ahi Poke - Probably the best part of the meal. Order the big big portion and share. If you talk to the staff nicely, they'd be willing to give you portions of each kind they have. My favorite was the shoyu or sesame. Light in flavor but not completely lackluster.
Kalbi Short Ribs - The flavor is akin to many of the korean style ribs but a little sweet.
Hawaiin Style Pork Roast - Great tender pork. Hands down some good flavor.
Loco Moco - It was Hawaiian food and we felt obligated to order this. Would we do it again, maybe but I'd have to reduce how much we ordered. I think since we ordered so much food, I wasn't able to enjoy this meal as much as I'd have liked.

So my love for their furikake chicken is unwavering.  I always accompany my meal with a some shoyu poke which tastes oh so good.  Swear every time perfectly done, fresh taste.  Definitely one of my go-to's for poke and only place I trust for furikake chicken.

Just recently went in and sat down and got served by Sunshine, if I recall correctly and no doubt loved her service.  My meal was perfect again with my aforementioned meal consisting of said furikake chicken and a 1 pound of shoyu poke ""appetizer"".  Loved the crunchy, flavorful, perfectly seasoned chicken and both meals had a simple arrangement with a very flavorful and great tasting kick.

I have to thank Sunshine because when I originally ordered I had forgotten to ask for my mother's opakapaka to be broiled instead of sautéed... I asked her and she said her food was being plated, but that it would be no problem and they ended up remaking it which I greatly appreciated.  After my mother's surgery she'd been advised to cut down on oil and therefore broiled was the way to go.

And I have to tell you the aroma off the opakapaka was phenomenal.  I love my raw fish, but have to admit when that plate of broiled opakapaka came out, I wanted to to take it from my mom lol... I did end up tasting it and by far I can say it will be the onlyyyyyy cooked fish I would not mind eating here in the valley.  I'm not a cooked fish fan (whether it's fish tacos, fried fish, baked fish), but this definitely made me reconsider that choice.

All in all thanks to Sunshine and the other servers who were just kind and attentive, thanks to the cooks for such great fare.  Thank you Island Flavor for everything, definitely 5 stars!",FaeY4ILFh6r1WpJDWc19Tw,2,2,5,fDFv_41YsJgrM2LTwripUw

I heard a scrumptious amount of pleasant reviews on the food here, and 3. It's Hawaiian food dude! Unfortunately I could not stay and eat inside the restaurant, but I did get to experience the ambience of the atmosphere while I was waiting for my order that I made to-go.

The menu also gave an option for brown rice too, hellyeah. There were other healthier options too in replacement of the macaroni salad, but that is too good to replace. So when I got my order, I bolted over to my friends house and opened my treasure box of satiation. The portion size, good. I like it. I can eat a whole cow and maybe half a horse, yeah it's kind of a curse sometimes. So I got the chicken katsu and half with the chicken teriyaki. I didn't expect the brown rice to be more of a mushy texture, but I didn't really mind it. It went well with the food in my opinion. The chicken was good, chicken teriyaki was good, and the macaroni salad, too good. I also ate the remaining 1/4 of my girlfriend's food cause she didn't finish it.

I might say the plate lunch I had at Island Flavor might be better than most places in Honolulu? wha? sacrilege?

Ok, they don't have fountain fanta fruit punch (which has a strawberry accent) like in Hawaii... but everything else--delicious.

The service is of a local flavor--the friendly kind. I wanted to try two things not typically ordered together, and the waitress was super flexible about it.  Yes!

The teri beef was delicious--and if it was salty--i only noticed it after the meal. But what I most appreciated was that it had a good char from the grill they have in the kitchen. Also, the cut of meat was not tender in itself (skirt or ny?) but it was handled perfectly. It had both a solid beefy taste and with the slices of meat going across the grain, each piece was mouth tender. It was a beautiful, expert touch. The teri sauce was solid--not like mainland style teriyaki--but local flavor.
The sweet sour spareribs--also quite good--a tiny bit oily. big piece of ginger, and turnips, carrots--it was good and hearty--like what you'd make at home.  not as good as the teri beef though. I ended up finishing all the teri beef and taking the SSS home. And PS--it tasted great as leftovers later that night.
mac salad was solid
Haupia cake--also world class. Reminiscent of Napoleans (Zippy's) in terms of the lightness of the cake.  I would not be surprised if the owner's used to run that bakery or someplace like that. All that cake for only $5!  

I'm so full again. Two meals in from one plate lunch (and a piece of cake)

Clearly these people know what they're doing. I have to really search to give any suggestions at all:
* Is it possible to make slightly better rice?  Pressure cooker might make the rice stand out too? The steamed rice scoops were pretty dense and was the weakest part of the meal. 
* I found myself waiting to pay for quite a while at the register.  It'd be nice if the wait staff took the payment--but hey, I won't complain.",9M8PtXcHhP5y4wgcR_Iv8w,3,2,5,2t8OHqB_uBctE-G5q3OXpQ

The disappointment is in their customer service. I remember dining in with a friend who knew one of the servers and the service was absolutely amazing even at busy peak hours! But other times dining by myself with other friends, the service was slow and even unfriendly. The aloha spirit should be with every customer, not just people you know. They will really go out of their way if they know you or if you're a regular there but for someone who dines every now and then, customer service is not always the best.

For example, I was looking forward to dining in today during my lunch break but our server's sassy attitude just killed it for me. Subpar service has happened in the past but today has been the worst so far. We walked in & no acknowledgement from anyone. They'd look at us but then look down or start talking to other customers instead. Not even a smile or ""I'll be right with you!"" I remember they used to do that a few years ago.

After several minutes of waiting, they sat us but no menus so I grabbed them myself. Our server took our orders with a stink face. Auntie, if you're having a bad day, excuse yourself and don't bring that attitude to customers! I said thank you when she set the food down, but didn't get a ""You're welcome."" she literally just walked away. A customer she knew walked in few minutes later and her attitude changed--she immediately smiled & was talking in a peppy voice! My friend even said ""Oh, there you go, there's her smile!"" 

Don't get me wrong, I'll probably still come back for the food but maybe delivery or take-out from now on. Like some people on here, I've noticed that the service has gone down hill over the years. It sucks cause I absolutely LOVE the food but today's visit will be memorable for the wrong reasons.",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,2,0,3,__ljUK0FKpfVPUz_o3yxag

1409482,2018-04-24,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Decided to come here for the first time to this location after work recently. I think I've been to their sister location in the north? (off craig and something by poke express) but correct me if im wrong xD 

I had put the order in on yelp prior to leaving work, but since it was so close to work, I still at to wait at the restaurant. 

Located just south of the Rhodes Ranch entrance on Durango, by windmill, it sits in a small shopping strip with some other places (totally looked but don't remember whats near by)

The restaurant itself is a decent size and was pretty busy, considering it was dinner time anyway.. Lol the kitchen was pushing out food really fast but it still took another 10 minutes or so for me to receive my food. Coincidentally saw Melissa because she was picking up food too xD 

I had ordered the ""Furikake Chicken"" to go w/ fried rice and mac salad. The Furikake Chicken is a deep-fried boneless chicken tossed in a furikake glaze. 

Let me be not the first person to say this, but to some people, me saying this may have more of an effect... HOLY THESE PORTIONS ARE HUGE ! Even with a fairly empty stomach after work, I barely ate half. The other half was saved for the next day. 

Not only was the amount of chicken a lot, even the fried rice portion was larger than expected. I'm not complaining about the amount of food. Its a great thing for the price you're paying. For me, it was two meals. For some smaller eaters, this could easily be 3 maybe 4 meals. 

I was a bit scared in the beginning because a friend of mine went to another location on eastern and said this chicken was bland. Mine was nothing but bland. sweet and savory sauce covering huge chunks of deep fried chicken, its like the Hawaiian version of orange chicken? XD ok not really... 

The fried rice was filled with ingredients. good size pieces of Chinese bbq pork. 

Not much of a fan of mac salad overall. It seemed like a normal mac salad. 

Overall, food was good. Overly stuffed from it. Wonder if other stuff is made to these sized portions as well?? time will tell... until the next time I work nearby :P",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,uMeuDNN7qZ3XbtxPALwv5A

You know that the food is good when you devour everything on the plates and don't even talk to the people you came with at the table. We had the furikake chicken, the kalbi short ribs, fried rice, and spam musubi. It was all so flavorful and would definitely recommend those items if its also your first time here and you are debating on what to get.

After a flight from SFO, we are super hungry. We ordered the stuff below:

Furikake ahi poke...ah good stuff. Came out a bit on the cold side, but the flavor on them cubes were on point. Not so powerful, but just right. Onions, hawaiian salt, fresh cracked pepper, and some oil

Chicken katsu... good but not great. Average taste, on the dry side. But still good when you're hungry.

Furikake chicken...dang! broke da mouth dis one. Geez, so tasty and flavorful and Im sure oh so bad for you but whatever. I'm in it for the taste. Love this dish.

Kalua cabbage...it's good, but the pork that I got was more on the fatty side. I like mines with lean pork. But it was still good, and not overly salty like some other places. 

Fried rice....also good, but not great. But I also compare fried rice to my faves at Side Street Inn and Big City Diner in Hawaii.

All in all, this place is really good. Come here for good food. And although we were way too full to eat their dessert, their haupia cake looked friggin amazing.",6kng4nyGuvPFJpXyi-ZIeg,2,0,5,YP5WAe6Miy2aM_88WxfaNg

Second time eating there, first time checking in with the Yelp app. Their Furikake Chicken is reason enough for you to be a regular at this place. Whenever I see a customer not eating the Furikake Chicken, I think, ""Come on maaaang"" O_O.

I did try the other stuff too. The Roast Pork is nothing spectacular and their fried rice is soy sauce with char siu pork. Again, nothing spectacular. 

Their Kalbi though is amazing. Tasted way different that any Korean or Hawaiian kalbi I ever tasted.

We got to the restaurant about 730pm and had to put our names on the waiting list because it was a Friday night and a little crowded.  We were told there was two parties a head of us and it's going to be around 20 minutes or little longer which is fine since we drove all the way down from  northwest las vegas.  We waited outside with the other two parties and  ten minutes had past and one party was called.  About twenty minutes later a young couple arrived and went inside but never came out so I'm guessing they must have tables available.  Its about 8:15 and we have been waiting for 30 minutes now outside in the  mid 90s heat so my wife went inside to check how much longer the wait would be but come to find out our name was crossed off the list and the couple  who had came 10 minutes after us was already seated.  So I asked the gentlemen at the counter the one I had talked to when i first put my name on the list why my name was crossed off and he said that someone said you had cancelled....REALLY!  Someone else had said I cancelled not I   but someone else.  I was shocked that I was told someone had cancelled our names that was not me. And the young man tries to blamed this on us and then says that there was still a bigger party ahead of us which I knew but that wasn't my point.  If you are running the front counter and the list pay attention to who comes first and who is waiting especially since you have a big window and can obviously see outside because there was no room inside to wait.  My point was that the customer who came 10 minutes later were already  seated on a table seating for four when they were a party of two.  Our name was put back on the list but we never got I'm sorry we made a mistake so we home.  I wish I was writing a review on how good or bad the food was but we will never get a chance because my family and I will never go back.

For dessert we had 1) Haupia Cake 2) Guava Cake 3) Coconut ice cream. These are all dishes we've eaten here many times before and we all agree they've remained the same. The amount of food was still the same. The prices to us were the same, reasonable, it's not like we looked at the prices and thought ""wow this is expensive"". The staff was the same, friendly and welcoming people we've been waited upon in the past. The place was going through an expansion process. Apparently they're going to knock out the wall to make the dining room bigger, which should help because this place gets really crowded. I just hope they also expand the kitchen too because more customers means you gonna need more cooks. So my take on the change in ownership is so far, everything is still the same, but how the new owners go from here is full of possibility. Still a five star and still the place recommended to anybody that asks me ""So since you're from Hawaii were is the best place to eat Hawaiian food in Las Vegas?"" I'll still say Island Flavor.",cnab2lH02dtnFeh-eQP-sg,0,0,5,iqrEM9sq-jQ-1fn6Je5cdg

My wife ordered the friend noodle special (Tuesday).  This is quite possibly the best friend noodle/saimin I have ever tried.  It's loaded with Cha Siu, Kamaboko, spam and topped with grilled Chicken Teriyaki.  

After talking to the owner, I ordered the Furikake Chicken which was fabulous.  It was crispy and full of flavor.  I also enjoyed the scoop of Mac Salad as well.  In fact, the flavors here are as big as their portions ""BIG"".  I'm going to have to try their Kalbi Ribs upon my next visit.

* Chicken Teriyaki - love the simple, charbroiled flavor.

On the plates: oxtail soup, furakaki chicken, kalbi short ribs with a side of bomb ass macaroni. Dessert called for freshly baked banana bread pudding.

This maybe my first check in however I am far from being a nube! As a regular I highly recommend the oxtail soup every visit! Hats off to the chef! The meat is always tender and the soup is a burst of ginger and beef broth flavor. The other must have dish is the spicy, avocado ahi poke. Somehow I feel compelled to say it makes a statement! I've tried the poke around town and nothing compares. It has the right amount of piscine taste and the avocado gives it the right creamy freshness. The furakaki chicken is a burst of flavor at your first crunchy bite and as you get to the chicken; it is tender and moist. The kalbi ribs are a tasty cocktail of salty, spicy and uuuumaaami!!! 

Last but not to say the least, dessert!!! This is my first time ordering the banana bread pudding; it was fresh out of the oven, topped with cinnamon cream pudding. I love how moist the bread was and the banana was not over powering. What a late night delight. 

I never dread the bill because the serving size is plentiful and the service is above par.

You learn, if you show up late for work, school or an appointment, there's repercussions.  And, on the extreme end, if you take your time walking across the street, you'll get run over.  Bottom line, there's no concept of polychronic ""Island Time"" where I come from.
  
Coming from L.A. also gives you the ability to quickly adapt to situations, and walking through the door of Island Flavor (on a Saturday afternoon) means you have to immediately switch to Island Time.  You're probably going to stand in line, with some element of uncomfortable heat, for quite a while, as tables slowly get cleared and diners (possibly drunk on carbs) take their sweet ass time moving along.  It's the nature of the beast of Island Flavor.  You put your best smiley face on and suck it up.

And, when you've finally been seated and placed your order, and 20 minutes later the waitress says, ""sorry, we lost your ticket"" and asks you to re-order, you keep on smiling.

On his advice, I got the furikake chicken. It's bite sized (a bit larger than bite sized) chicken that's fried, and doused in some sort of furikake sauce (google it so I don't have to explain it), served with Mac salad and rice.

Do yourself a favor and mix a little rice with the Mac salad. It's the gangsta move.

As always, the staff is friendly. Me and two of my best girlfriends went around 1 in the afternoon. It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, so finding a seat was not hard at all. 

It didn't take long for our waitress to get our drink orders, and bring it in a timely matter. I've noticed tho, that the prices has gone up quite a bit since the last time I was here a couple years ago. I was about to order the usual mix plate when I noticed the Daily Specials Menu placed inside the Menu Booklet. 

Menu Specials when I went there Last Week...
My Order: Kalua Luau. side order of sweet potato with sesame sauce
Friend 1: Furikake Chicken 
Friend 2: Pork Chop (on regular menu) 

The kalua luau was good, its different type of luau to my family luau. Our luau is more creamier, but this one was a bit more on the roughage green leafy side. But it was still so ono. I opted for brown rice and it also comes with mac salad. THe mac salad was a little too ""mayonaisy"" for me, but if my palate didn't change since i moved from the rock ten years ago, it would've been right up my alley! I ordered up a side of cooked sweet potato and the dipping sauce was divine. Just a great amount of sweet and salty to compliment the potato. 

The Furikake CHicken was broke the mouth. As much as i LOVED the Luau, I was picking the chicken off my friends plate just as much as she was picking the luau off of mines. We should've just switched our plates. I was under the impression it was a full chicken breast, but they came out as nuggets. Sweet and savory, with bits of furikake all over! Now i'm not a big fan of any kind of fried chicken, but I couldn't control my hand. It kept reaching over to her plate to grab more!  A definite must try!! 

Last but not least, the pork chops with smothered onions. Now what is NOT to like from this all time favorite. Now I've had charbroiled pork chops, teriyaki pork chops, char siu pork chops, apple pork chops, etc. But I love having just a regular, salt and pepper seasoned home style pork chops once in a while. That brought it all home. It was served with two scoops of white rice and a side salad with your choice of dressing. 

I didn't opt out for dessert this trip, but from previous visits, I do recommend the Chantilly cake and the Banana Bread Pudding! I tried the Kona Coffee Mud Pie, but when I got it, it was just a oreo crust with three inch high of ice cream and stuff drizzled all over it. Not exactly what I call a mud pie, but it was delicious as just Kona coffee ice cream! (It was still Ono! )

So far I have not had a bad meal here. Teriyaki chicken is good (and this is something I never order anywhere but I like theirs). Korean short ribs, roast pork, loco moco, katsu, and my favorite is the Poke Salad with raw poke. I like the wontons, purple yam, tomatoes, cucumber, and sesame dressing! Unfortunately, the price has gone up because of the cost of tuna over the years making it an expensive dish, but still good quality nonetheless. 

The staff is pretty friendly here and the one time my poke was not made correctly (too spicy and way too much sauce) they were more than willing to correct it for me.

1773301,2018-01-05,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"First time at this location but I've been to the Eastern location numerous times. I didn't know that this place was a sit-down restaurant which it makes sense to me now that the one on Eastern says ""Island Flavor Express"" in their store front. 
My boyfriend and I were craving fried chicken so we decided to dine here for their well known furikake chicken. It was pretty busy for a weekday night but didn't expect our order to take so long to come out. It took over forty minutes to arrive to our table from the time we placed it. We thought this place would be a quick eat. Although we didn't really have a designated server (I think) , I wish someone like our server who took our order would've told us that their kitchen was backed up or something at least.
Most of the workers didn't look so happy to work there especially the hostess/cashier in front had the most annoyed look on her face whenever people came in & she was walking them to their tables. The only server that was actually friendly to us & the other tables around was the guy server. As for the food itself , furikake chicken was tasty and large portion to share for 9$. I love the food at both locations & think that it's way better than other Hawaiian establishments around Las Vegas. It's probably just better to just order to-go or for takeout here.
Other menu items I recommend that I tried from their other location: THEIR SPICY AVO POKE (worth ordering by the pound) , chicken katsu , kalbi short ribs , and all of the desserts (their chantilly and guava cake slices are bomb).",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,3,0,3,NG0rNTQSBjShfRn6PxjHRA

Food: I had the Chicken katsu/ hamburger steak mix combo. The chicken katsu was definitely better than what you'd get at L&L or Aloha kitchen. Juicy white meat pieces and a good sauce. The hamburger steak was the real winner for me. The patty was well seasoned, but the brown gravy was what made it. You could tell that they made their gravy from scratch not not a box like some places *cough*L&L*cough*. 

Service: The lady was really nice and attentive. She seated us and took our order right away. I did wait a little bit for a drink refill though. 

Misc: Its pretty nice inside. They have a bar eating area with a flat screen TV to watch. We used a coupon from Restaurant.com to get our food for cheaaaaap which made this meal even better. I'll be back real soon. -1 star however because the mac salad here sucks. Its like they put boiled egg yolk into it. Weird taste and texture.",uDUjigr6CXJrOSh4Yz1lKw,0,0,4,u8nYDAKLKcTQ0ziyhY1yvg

1784549,2017-07-25,2,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Ancient Hawaiians ventured away from the islands in great, double-hulled canoes as far back as 900 AD, in search of food, new land, and entertainment, exploring Asia and the west coast of North America. They may have also been homesick, sailing back to their roots in Marquesas and Tahiti.

Back in June 2017, I traveled on double-engine Airbus 330 with Hawaiian Airlines to California in search of food and umm--well--entertainment. After a few days, in sunny Orange County, I drove to Las Vegas to continue my quest. Using GPS like my descendants will, the four-hour sojourn was successful, narrowly avoiding a five-hour delay on the I-15 when an RV blew up a few vehicles in front of me. A week on the Continent and feeling homesick, I searched for Hawaiian food.

My first stop in Las Vegas: Island Flavor off of a recommendation from a friend of a friend. I had the roast pork with gravy, and was thoroughly impressed with the service and quality of food. Heaping scoops of steamed rice, fabulous macaroni salad, and roast pork crusted with black pepper and smothered in silky, brown gravy. It was also a great place to meet other people from Hawaii on vacation or relocated to Las Vegas. Oddly, this was the best and cheapest Hawaiian food I've had, including everything I've experienced back home in Hawaii.

It can take awhile to get seated, due to the small amount of tables and seats available, but the wait is completely worth it. When you're seated, your server will be quick to get you your drink(s) and take your order. Never has my order taken more than 15 minutes -- they're really quick with your order, small or big! Speaking of big, their food portions are huge, especially for the price you pay! Most of their dishes are less than $10, but you'll feel that you are getting a $20 meal, portion and taste factored in.

My go-to meal is usually the furikake chicken. If you love breaded chicken and you love it sweet, definitely try this dish! You might even get carried away by ordering one for two people.

Food tastes amazing, and the staff there are just as great as the food! And let's say you prefer to take your food to-go, they're really quick and easy about that. I've ordered from their website plenty of times and had my food ready in about 15 minutes.

Nevertheless,  I will always be a fan of the Hoison glazed ribs! The Korean chicken, fried chicken, and katsu are also good too.

If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd certainly go there, but as an out of towner, I don't think I'll make a special trip just to eat there.

I had the Korean chicken, and it was good - the texture was great, and it was extra crispy, but although it had a kick to it, it could have had more of a kick, and it was a little bit too salty.  

The macaroni salad was also good, but still within the range of what you'd expect.  The rice, and if you have read my other reviews, I am picky about steamed rice, and here, they had the same issue as I have with  a lot of other places, and that is I found the rice to be too soft, and though I ate 75% of the two large scoops, I was not able to eat it all. 

I sampled some fries and I thought they were your everday run of the mill ""thick"" fries.   On the specials menu, they had cucumber kim chee for $2.00.  The taste was good, but we only got like a small sampler cup full, which would be about 1 1/2 banchan dishes at a Korean restaurant.

1848459,2014-06-04,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I have to say among the Hawaiian places I've tried all over the valley... This bar far is the most and most authentic! Portion sizes are huge and more than enough to eat there be full and take plenty home. I've had the Korean garlic chicken, the hamburger loco moco, Katsu chicken loco moco, kalbi spare ribs and the spamasubi. I have never been disappointed food wise. 

The place on the outside looks nothing short of standard and not anything special or impressive at all. It's rather spacious inside and average amount of seating for a family owned establishment. It's always a good sign when you see islanders eating coz you know the food is legit. Always people in here eating and always at least someone from Hawaii inside enjoying the grub there. 

The most recent time I went tho, I have to say the service was on the poor side. Granted, it was really busy that day, but we waited for our check and refill on drink from at least ten minutes. A server or cook from the back came out to help seat people and saw someone she knew eating and got caught up talking to that table for a while. We kept trying to get her attention until finally the customer that was talking to this server told US that WE should just go up to the counter to get someone's attention... Excuse me?! Poor form. That person should told the employee ""hey we'll talk later you have customers"" and directed her to us.! So naw we sat there and waited. And poor form on that server for having a ten minute conversation with a table when the placed is packed and we can't get anyone to notice that we want the check and to go boxes to dip outta there. 

Normally neglect of service is something I hold highly to food and dining establishments and take off a whole star for that. But dam this place is so bomb with the food... I'll let that one time slide. The customer service can make or break a dining experience for a person. And if the service is exceptional or good like it's supposed to be... It can sometimes make the meal all the more enjoyable. Tighten up on that customer service... Then it's top notch best Hawaiian food in town.",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,2,1,5,GZcFH1IlgSId8CUsy_lIeg

I've tried both of these at a few other places around town and Island Flavor is easily my favorite for both.

I started off my taking one star off for the crappy service. Ok sure i was kind of greeted right away, by a surly guy asking me if i was dining in. When i said yes, just me. He asked how many.   I used my hand and held up my index finger and said just one...me... Then he proceeded to lead me to a table and dropped off the menu and asked if i wanted anything to drink. I said water for right now and he looked so annoyed that i didn't have my drink order ready to go. He didn't bother asking if i had any questions on the menu just stalked off... When he dropped off the water, i asked him if he had coffee, he said yes and since I'm diabetic, i had to make sure that it would be just black coffee, i confirmed that info with him and yup you guessed it, he looked freaking annoyed that i was confirming that it would be just black coffee. Started my meal off with a very bad taste in my mouth. If the place had been crazy busy i would almost... And yes i said almost... Understand his surliness, but when you are in the food industry it doesn't matter what kind of day that you had or are having, you paste on a fake smile and smile to you guests. Maybe I'm overly critical as i am in the industry and i have days where i felt like crap but you know what? My guests never knew that i was having a crappy day.  He did improve towards the end of the meal... He was not exactly friendly but he did touch my table a couple of times to refill my coffee and to ask if i liked my food. Service(2/5)

Now onto the food.

After reading all the reviews, i was excited to try them again ...i thought that maybe i had gotten them on a bad day last time. So totally not. I was not impressed. The chicken katsu was just average. Nothing special about it. The furikake shrimp was very crispy and had a great texture but flavor was just decent. Nothing to write home about. I had to dip it into the the sweet chili sauce to get any better flavor. The fried rice that was $2 up charge was just too salty. And if i had a better ""relationship"" with the server i might have mentioned it but since he was the king of surly...i didn't say anything. The macaroni salad was just that. Nothing special about that either. :/ Food (2.75/5)

So overall, i won't be rushing back. I might stop by to give then a third try.. maybe third times the charm who knows? Being a little generous...i rounded it up to a 3 star. 

And the kicker, i did want to order cake but he didn't ask and after the attitude and surliness...it was too much effort on my part to ask for the guava cake.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,7,6,3,SVjf_lXPyWKHG7BKJLz2hg

Spam musubi is delicious. They make it with the spam in the middle with furukaki sprinkled on it & a light terriyaki sauce. We always order extra to keep for snacks later. 

Terriyaki chicken is super flavorful, thin pieces of white & dark chicken. 

Chicken katsu is very tender & perfectly fried every time. Nothing's worse then getting over fried hard katsu. 

Furukaki chicken is so delicious but very rich & salty. I can only eat a little, but it goes so well with rice & mac salad. Fried nuggets of chicken tossed in a furukaki glaze. 

Saimen is traditional saimen but they add wontons to it so it's like saimen meets Chinese wonton soup. I get it without egg bc it's little pieces of scrambled egg, not thin strips so I'm just not a fan of the egg. 

The portions are very large so we usually order 3 full plates & a musubi for everyone (3 adults & 2children) and it's more than enough. 

They deliver on bite squad but if you call in for pickup yourself it's usually ready in 10-15 min, even on busy weekend nights.

Upon arriving to the complex, it looks dark and like everything is closed. Once you open the doors to the restaurant, there's so much light and space!

When we came in, the two waitresses were busy with other customers, so they told us to sit wherever. We also had to get our own menus since we were in a hurry. I'm used to the type of service where they pamper you and can get annoying by asking you too many questions. This was the complete opposite, but the waitresses were super sweet so I can't complain! Plus since I told them that we were sharing, they brought out an extra plate. Some places you have to remind or specifically ask for a plate.

The portions are HUGE and extremely filling! We got the Teriyaki Beef (I'm not sure exactly the name) and the Chicken Katsu Moco Loco. It came out relatively quickly. Each plate came with the respective meats, two scoops of rice, and a scoop of macaroni salad. 

My mom and I shared the Chicken Katsu plate, which had chicken that was deliciously crunchy and well-made and came with some sort of BBQ sauce on the side. The macaroni salad was also good; it is light and a good complement to the flavorful food. My dad's Teriyaki beef was good and reminded me of Korean BBQ. It was slightly salty and too flavorful for my liking, but if you mixed it in with the rice, it was much better. 

We saw some other people get the Korean short ribs, which looked awesome so if we're in the area, we're definitely getting it!

The prices were relatively cheap! It was around $9-12 for a plate with meat, rice, and macaroni salad. I'm not sure what the poke was, but it was listed three times on the menu, each time ranging around $17-20, which deterred me from ordering it.

Thumbs up on the Korean Fried Chicken (loved the flavor, would have loved it more if it was boneless white meat used instead of the wings - like they do in Hawaii). The Hawaiian roast pork was on point! The Chantilly cake was good - satisfied the craving. I still like Liliha Bakery's Chantilly cake better.

Randomly came here on a friday night 30 mins before closing.
Called in ahead of time and they offered to put our name down on the list. Awesome.

They have plenty of tables for small and large parties.

Everything on the menu sounds delicious and best part?
ITS SUPER CHEAP!!!! Each plate is less than or around $10.
And oh my lord, SOOOO MUCH FOOD!!!

Each plate can seriously be shared between two people.
I opted for the combo plate because I wanted to try more than one thing.

Hawaiian Style Roast Pork & Furikake Shrimp Combo
The pork is cooked local style w/Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped w/rich homemade brown gravy and the shrimp is jumbo shrimp coated with panko and furikake fried golden brown and served with oriental sauce. The pork was VERY tender with a nice ratio of meat to fat. And the shrimp was crunchy and delicious. I definitely recommend both options. I did ask for white rice, but the cook accidentally gave me fried rice instead, which was even better!!! Because it was a super large portion of fried rice and had bbq pork meat in it and a nice subtle flavor. The mac salad was the only thing that was a very small portion, but it was good as well.

We also shared the fresh made ahi poke. It was good as well. Especially with fresh sliced onions.

The interior is fully decorated island style and staff are all hawaiians as far as I can tell. Staff members are also very friendly and easily make you feel at home. They always got local island music playing that just adds on to the experience.

My Favorites:

Chicken Katsu Loco Moco: Perfectly breaded chicken cut into strips, white rice, pair of over easy eggs and they're rich and thick homemade brown gravy (they're gravy is what sets them apart from every other hawaiian bbq eatery)

Loco Moco: Same as above except for the chicken, its a grilled homemade hamburger patty

Kalbi Short Ribs: Charbroiled, quite tender and soaked with flavor. If the bone was edible, there would be nothing left..

Korean Chicken: fried little drumsticks and wings tossed in their special sauce. Mild and uniquely flavorful, I can put these down!

Pork Chops: 2 pieces of grilled bone-in pork chops, topped with mushroom and onions. I always get a side of their gravy and pour it over and smother the chops. So So Comforting!

I've also tried their teriyaki beef and chicken, fried rice.. everything is great!

**Portions are HUMONGOUS!! As the hawaiians say ""Don't eat until your full, eat until you pass out"" 

**Full Entree Orders Will Easily serve 2! Prices are very reasonable! Service is great!

This is my first visit and the staff was very welcoming. These are real Hawaiian from Kona they tell me. This is not like the other places that are mostly Korean owned. This place takes pride in their food and it shows. The Kalbi ribs and fried shrimp is what was suggested. The owner hand cuts the ribs himself and marinades them. He said he never freezes the meat so its always fresh. The shrimp is hand cut and breaded with furikake sprinkled on it. I haven't had Hawaiian food this good since I was there last year.

I understand that a restaurant must raise prices over time to compete with rising food costs and Ive gladly paid for it.  However, it is terrible when a restaurant  reduces the amount of food given AND charges more.  Plate lunch food has always been about value and taste.  I can no longer justify eating at Island Flavor if I have to pay $15 for a plate lunch, which, to me, is no longer a value.  It was a surprise when I looked at my recent bill and saw upcharges that were not there under the previous ownership.  For less food and $15, I'll save my money and eat elsewhere, especially, if I walk away after a meal feeling like I didnt get my money's worth.

2003891,2016-02-14,2,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"My wife and I don't gamble, our clubbing days are in our rear view mirrors, and watching Las Vegas type shows are a little too pricey for us.  So, what the heck are we in Vegas for?  Our daughter and her club volleyball team are here for four days competing in the SCVA 30th Las Vegas Classic Volleyball Tournament.  Since we don't do any of things most people do while in Vegas, what else is there to do.  Well, I didn't mention the other thing people do, which is what we did here at Island Flavor.  EAT!!!

There are several Island Flavor restaurants in Vegas, but the one you have to visit is the one off of Durango.  Island Flavor resides amongst other tenants in a small strip mall.  We visited Island Flavor for dinner and from the outside you would think the restaurant is tiny, which it's not once you walk inside.  It's also dark from the outside because of tint they have on their windows, which is probably due to the scathing sun during the Las Vegas heat.  Once we entered, the restaurant was jam packed, meaning that we were about to embark on some good eats.  That was an understatement.  Our group of 5 had to wait a little while because of how popular this place is.  There's not much of a waiting area.  The decor is Hawaiian themed through and through with island decor all over the restaurant.  The staff worked hard to turn tables and provided decent customer service, but did the best they could considering how busy they were.

Island Flavor represented Hawaiian food really well.  As we walked into the restaurant, you are greeted by a display case filled with spam musubi, which should tell you what to expect.  I ordered the loco moco and ahi poke furikake.  Boy was I happy!!!  The ahi poke furikake was divine and tasty-licious.  It was fresh, seasoned just right, and combined with sliced vegetables.  I can say that Island Flavor's ahi poke can compete with the best of them.  I ordered half a pound, which was less than $8 and was a great appetizer.  When my loco moco was brought out, my group and I were amazed that it came out in a huge bowl.  Coming out in a bowl should tell you how much food you're getting.  It was massive and I didn't finish half of that dish.  It was doused with gravy, with cooked just right hamburger patty, had a bounty of rice, and was topped with two sunny side eggs.  Once I broke the yolk and watched it flow onto the gravy, hamburger, and rice, I was salivating before I took my first bite.  The conglomeration of everything really satisfied me except for one minus.  The gravy needed either salt or seasoning, but that meal with its massiveness is what I call true value for your money.

For my family of 3 and the amount of food we ordered, I really thought we got our money's worth and we were able to bring home leftovers.  I definitely recommend ahi poke furikake and the loco moco.  Although we don't do most of the usual Las Vegas things to do, we always do what Las Vegas is also known for, which is stuff your face until your belly hurts.  Thank you Island Flavor for doing this in spades.  Yummy-licious Big Time!!!",TdDxMS27vu0fXXxIvz16bQ,4,4,4,qNRJA3knzsTwu379E3yYRw

I ordered a mixed plate combo with furikake chicken and teriyaki chicken. The plate comes with 2 scoops of white rice, and a side of mac salad. I also added on 2 orders of spam musubi. My total was $18.49. Island Flavor is located in BFE aka Durango and Windmill, right next to World Of Cakes. 

The food was really good. The furikake chicken was something I have never had before but I enjoyed it. It's chicken pieces breaded then deep fried and tossed in a sweet sauce and sprinkled with furikake. Something new for my taste buds for sure. The teriyaki chicken was okay. The problem was it was literally swimming in teriyaki sauce and it was sooo salty. I love teriyaki sauce, but would for sure ask for the sauce on the side next time. Especially since I had leftovers. Reheated teriyaki gets thick and goopy, and is not the business. The spam musubi were decent size and still tasted good the next day. They wrapped em in saran wrap so all I had to do was pop it in the microwave and I was good to go.
I enjoyed the mac salad. It was creamy and just about perfect, but I did add a dash of salt and pepper to it. All in all, everything was pretty ONOLICIOUS!

I've been wanting to come here for years! We ordered two mixed plates. One with furikake chicken and Kalua pig & Cabbage. The other with kalbi short ribs and chopped steak and onions. 

After staring at photos of furikake chicken for years, my dream came true and was able to try it. Honestly, was a bit diappointed in the taste which is like something  you get a Chinese restaurant without the furikake. The Kalua pig and cabbage lacked the saltiness and smoked flavor you typically get. So, that was diappointing as well. The portions weren't a disappointment. Large enough to feed 2 people with mac salad. Can't believe I almost finished my plate. Oink..  

The kalbi short ribs were just like most. Good but not great. The chopped steak was decent and had a slight sweetness to it (sugar).

We ordered the kalua pig and furikake chicken with fried rice. The kalua pig and cabbage tasted really odd as if it had been cooked then microwaved. The fried rice was saturated in soy sauce and not thoroughly dispersed. The chicken was good but overcooked.  I just think they forgot about our order and then half assed it.

When you come here, it is not a fine dining experience. I mean, this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-elastic-band-before-coming kind of food.

There are a couple of things are worth mentioning. 

The salads - most notably the fried poke and teriyaki chicken salad are excellent. It's hard to get tuna cooked right - meaty, tender red on the inside, seared perfectly on the outside. Those luscious cubes of fish really made this dish shine. Grilled teriyaki chicken thighs had a nice char on the outside without making it too dry. Perfection. Served on a bed of romaine with a side of tomato, cucumber, purple sweet potato  and fried wonton chips- this salad is not a light affair with its creamy sesame dressing. Normally, I order this salad with the dressing on the side and leave most of the chips next to it.

Chicken katsu was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. The amount given is rather astounding - 3 fillets served with scoops of rice and macaroni salad. (One of our friends who loves to eat very light, was addicted to the macaroni salad. It was like watching a crack addict after a long period of abstinence.)

Steak and onions were packed with flavour. The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to a medium to medium rare.

The only thing I didn't find that appetizing was their roasted pork dish. The gravy was overwhelming although the pork did have a nice flavour to it. If it wasn't for the gravy, the dish would have been infinitely better.

Portions are really big - bring friends. I'm serious. 3 dishes could easily feed 4 really hungry people or 5 not-so-hungry people.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,4,V-5WQXYczPszkcdNSsyU5A

Is there no standard knowledge of basic service and etiquette here? Everyone working here seemed so careless and oblivious. No sense of urgency or organization. My friends and I entered and were not looked at, checked on, acknowledged, greeted, accommodated, nothing. I didn't know if I should've sat myself down or just wait and give them a chance (shouldn't have). Nope, just left to stand there like unwelcome guests as some lady at the cash register took care of some payment and then WALKED AWAY without acknowledging our presence. Hey guys, you do know customers enter through your front door, right?

After eating (which seemed like an eternity to get to that point), I raised my hand at least 5 times to ask question about the check, even speaking out to get someone's, anyone's attention. None of the employees looked my way. At this point I was beginning to question if these people were normal. A waitress briefly saw me with my hand RAISED and everything, but then she immediately changed direction and focused her attention elsewhere, striking up a conversation with a table of people she seemingly knew. Are you kidding me?? Fed up by now, I finally had to GET UP from my table to get this stupid little simple ordeal done and to finally pay.

It's not just the friendly/attentive staff, nor the delicious, never bland flavor of all their dishes, or the generosity in which they choose to portion their food, or the overall amazing atmosphere in this blessed eatery. It's the culmination and perfect balance of all those things.

Their spam musubi is to die for. Add a bit of Sriracha and you've got yourself a whole meal. All their entree items are a dream come true for a foodie like me. Beef teriyaki isn't the skin thick kind you get from L&L (smh), but rather steak like cuts of the cow. Katsu is perfectly fried and dont even let me get started on the Loco Moco. 

If you haven't, check this place out, if you have, then what the hell are you reading this for? Better be on your way to island flava!

I tend to order the half orders because one full serving is way too much! The only time I ever get a full order is if I'm ordering to-go so that I can eat it throughout the day. 

My favorite dish is the loco moco plate. The meat is huge!! They probably pack it there themselves because I rarely ever see such big portions anywhere else. It's a nice change from seeing the single beef patties on top of the rice like most other places. They're also very generous on the amount of gravy they pour over everything. Oh and the egg was cooked perfectly. I always get my eggs sunny side up and they have never messed it up here. Another one of my favorite items here is the furikake ahi poke. It used to be a lot cheaper per pound but now they sell it by market price. I believe it was around $14/lb last time I was there. Not too bad but it was definitely a lot cheaper before. They can do half orders for the poke too if you don't wanna spend too much. Another one of my favorites here is the katsu curry plate. Although last time I got it, the curry was a little salty. Not overly salty but I had to eat more rice to compensate. 

I've heard their oxtail soup here is to die for. I haven't tried it yet but it's on my list of things to try along with their guava cake. I can't wait! Island Flavor is my go to hawaiian food spot.

You can order a single entree or create your own mixed plate combination for a couple extra bucks.  Entrees are served with 2 scoops rice and 1 scoop mac salad.  Sounds like plate lunch time!

On our first visit, the server recommended the Kalbi and Furikaki chicken.  I decided on a combo of Furikake chicken and Kalua pork and cabbage.  The chicken was crispy and coated with a sweet glaze and Furikake.  The Kulua pork was a bit disappointing.  I didn't think it had enough smoke flavoring.  Hubby had oxtail soup.  The soup was very tasty although a little heavy on ginger.  Portions were very generous!

On our second visit I went with our server's recommendation.  Kalbi ribs and Furikake chicken.  Tummy was very happy.  A small complaint was that one piece was a little grisly.  Don't feel that's the restaurants fault.  The Kalbi was seasoned perfectly.  Hubby ordered the Lau Lau special which is served with Lomi Lomi and Haupia.  Very ONO!

The thing enjoy about this version at Island Flavor is the cabbage not julienne cut so dig in get best of both worlds kailua and cabbage. Or hell if want cabbage in one bite then kailua all you. Again not emphasis portion size got love LOCAL food best deal under ten bucks lunch or dinner. 

I tried the banana bread pudding. Honestly ok. I never really got any hint of banana in the bread pudding and not as dense. That just my personnel preference. Now the haupia cake still reigns supreme out of the desserts had at Island Flavor.

Anyways... 

Oh my goodness... I had the furikake chicken... To be honest, I tasted just a tiny hint of furikake on the glazed pieces of chicken. It mainly was a sweet taste that was yummmmy!... I also got hamburger steak that comes smothered in gravy with a little bit of onion and mushroom. A super heavy meal, those plates are good for sharing! My husband had the chicken katsu loco moco. Again, A huge serving that comes in a big bowl, also tasty... I later tried my moms leftover chicken teriyaki.. That too had a good taste that wasn't too sweet or salty, but full of flavor. 

I love the family vibe I get from this place. Big sister (aka our server) even told my husband she'll give him a slice of cake for free next time we visit! (After seeing him eye every slice of cake that came out of the kitchen)... We were too full to get a slice at the time.

When walking into Island Flavor, I felt like I was on vacation! Well, I was already on vacation anyway. I meant to stay vacationing on the big island of Hawaii. The restaurant wasn't busy and accommodated our group of five guys easily. Since I was the only one who wasn't craving spam and eggs, I went for my next best choice. The Chicken katsu loco moco.

The menu offerings looked so tasty, but I wanted to stick with the egg themed entree' at our table. When I got my loco moco, I felt like I was in a eating competition. The bowl that my meal was served in was huge! I had  generous portions of chicken katsu and rice. I didn't want to use the gravy, so I opted it on the side and get the katsu sauce instead. The chicken katsu was nice and crispy from the breading, yet tender inside with the chicken. The egg was a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg.

Fried Rice Omelet plate is huge perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Comes with a large portion of fried rice with pieces of char siu mixed in, topped with an omelet of who knows how many eggs, and also thick slices of Portuguese sausage.

Kalbi short ribs mighty tasty and probably the thickest cuts of Kalbi here. Not the best for those who are dieting.

Shoyu ahi poke very tasty perfect on it own or with beer on a hot day while grilling.
 
Katsu loco moco, I know weird huh. I've seen it all over the place but never thought of trying a non-hamburger loco moco. I've been missing out its actually pretty good. I guess whenever I'm feeling like loco moco I'll order regular hamburger most times and every other time swap out for a non traditional loco moco.

Huge slice of Kona Coffee Mud pie and other cakes and desserts. If you still have room for this congratulations to you.  Just like their plates, their desserts are big and delicious.

Last but not least the Hawaiian plate which is only offered Fridays, is the best way to end the work week and to start the weekend. The only day of the week they have lau lau on the menu. It comes with two scopes of rice, lau lau, lomi lomi salmon, ahi poke, mac salad, and haupia.

I ordered the mixed plate of kalua pork and furikake chicken. Omg the chicken was soooo good. The seasoningnof the cjicand the crispiness were on point. Unfortunately the kalua pork missed the mark entirely; it was wicked bland and way too chewy as if it had been overcooked - utterly flavorless.

My friend who had the mixed plate with kalua pork and roast pork had the same complaint about the kalua pork as well but she was happy with the roast pork, especially the sauce it came with. 

We also had the spam musubi which was good: sauce was appropriately sweet and not overbearing. I do wish the spam slice was thicker. 

We also ordered the ahi poke which they forgot and ended up coming at the end of our meal. The servers apologized but that was it. We couldn't really enjoy it as it came well after our entrees and it seemed like they rushed to make it - the seasoning tasted off.

For dessert, we took home a piece of chantilly cake. The cake and buttercream were soooo creamy and smooth. It's pretty sweet so if that's not your thing, steer clear. It's delicious both warm and cold.

Well I'm writing this review the morning after and I can tell you I feel like the same person I was before dinner and it truly wasn't all that. The breading is thin and crisp, with a strong sesame oil aroma and sweet flavor. They use a combination of light and dark meat. Furikake chicken is a solid 3 star dish- nothing more or less. The beef teriyaki was teriyaki... the sesame poke was great, though. The cubes of tuna melt in your mouth. Probably could have marinated just a little bit longer, but still delicious. Huge portions!

We also ordered the guava cake and it was both beautiful and delicious. It really doesn't need the whipped cream dollop, though! It mixes oddly with the flavor of the sauce. Our slice of cake was huge and was the best part of our dining experience. 

The restaurant was clean and I noticed they have received an ""A"" from the health department. Kinda funky lighting, but still a nice aesthetic. All of their tables have pull-out chairs, no booths. Service was friendly, but it took a very long time before our water was refilled, we were offered dessert, or we received our bill. We probably won't return before trying other bookmarked Hawaiian spots.",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,2,1,3,UM2eSxZA27c5Z7Tnt6DMRQ

2420473,2017-02-09,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I'm pretty picky with my Hawaiian food, but island flavor is pretty alright in a sense of portion.

I came in here and tried their furikake chicken and spicy avocado poke.

So lemme get to the good stuff first: their poke is spot on good; fresh and delicious. If you get their 1lbs option it's a pretty good deal and you can share with friends.

We also tried the slightly cooked poke option but to be honest, I didn't care too much for it. It just reminded me of teriyaki cooked fish, nothing really special.

My main course was the furikake chicken, portions were huge! It lasted me that meal and fed me the next day (but then again I don't like to waste food, so I'm a huge left overs kinda guy..) ha!

As for the disappointments though, the flavor of the chicken got boring quick, and the texture was way too tough and difficult to digest. The chicken was also a bit too dry, I think it was deep fried way too long. The sauce was a little too salty for my preference but if you want something to fill you up on a deal, I suppose you're getting your money's worth. 

Island flavor is alright if you want quantity over quality, and some decent poke but I can't really see myself coming back here again unfortunately.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,3,1,3,daW_GVa_Jqlv06Z3-JOHeA

The items are price friendly, super tasty, and satisfying amount.

Appetizer: Poke with avocado sauce is the best option, make sure you have 2 or more ppl in the party for this, it's  too much for one person and it's not a good idea to take it home since it's raw fish.

Main dish: I love the mixed plate options in here, teriyaki steak is a must for me every time. If you are a meat lover, I recommend you to try Kalbi short ribs with teriyaki beef steak. It just like in the heaven. (Honestly additional $2 fried rice taste just ok)
They also have special food item of the day, beef stew is my favorite, it might be on Saturday (not sure). 

Dessert: lava cake taste so good! Usually after my mixed plate I can't have dessert right away because I was so full, i just order it to go instead.

After reading the high praise this place (just down the street from me) got, I was excited to try it out. I ordered the Mixed Plate with Kalbi and Chicken Katsu. One thing many people have said about this place is the large serving size. I figured, by ordering the mix plate (choice of two items), I would definitely be able to bare witness to the large portions. I was mistaken. They made it look heaping, but it was an illusion. All in all, there were 5 short ribs, and 7 small strips of chicken.

It didn't get any better with taste. Okay, the Kalbi was okay, but I have, without a doubt, had better. My wife and in-laws are Korean. It's hard to beat authentic Korean Kalbi. So, I'm willing to let the Island Flavor slide on that. I can't, however, give any slack on the chicken. There was more breading than chicken, and it didn't have ANY flavor, let alone Island flavor. I'm guessing this is why they give you the small little cup of dipping sauce. After taking a bite into the unnaturally crispy strip, you can vaguely see a sliver of chicken.

The fries are good. But I don't visit restaurants just for their fries, except maybe Gordon Biersch.",33m3nh2a5RZsedS-s4HoNQ,1,0,2,r7c0Q7AAXNlKZ_aqHYpVjQ
2432555,2012-08-03,2,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"With my fiancé from the islands, I've pretty much adopted Hawaiian food into my diet and trying every single Hawaiian restaurant in town has become a requirement for us. Being that we both live in the west side of town, we usually don't stray too far from our frequent traveled routes, UNLESS it's to fulfill a foodie adventure. On this particular day, we decided we'd finally pay a visit to Island Flavor. 

When we arrived, I was immediately drawn to a plate of pre-made, saran wrapped musubis that sat on the register counter for 2 bucks a pop. I thought to myself, how brilliant is that?! We were seated and my eyes were drawn to one flaw-- Several teriyaki and sriracha sauce splatters on the wall. I know, I know... Trust me, I HATE being a stickler for something like that, but it made me feel like a saw remnants of a booger flinger on the wall. ANYWAY, back to the good stuff.

My fiancé and I ordered two mixed plates. One beef teriyaki steak and korean chicken and one chop steak & onions and korean chicken. When the plates arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the big portions. Two scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad, and MEAT GALORE! The food definitely tasted delicious. However, as a fan of thinly sliced beef, I had expected my teriyaki steak to be sliced thin as described on the menu, but it was not. It was actually the opposite of what I had expected--The chop steak was sliced thin and the teriyaki beef was more ""chop[py]"". Nonetheless, I ate it. 

I hope to visit them again soon to try a few more items off their menu. I think maybe next time even consider sharing a plate to leave room for some of their desserts that I watched longingly pass my table.",KEAP--MnBZtQ9kjjMU-RiA,6,3,4,C4tMOQLAu-bRc6tpIdTjkw

And until I had Island Flavor I never really knew just how good it could be.
I actually stopped in without knowing anything about this place and just went for lunch with my roommate Mason, who has been to Hawaii numerous times so I figured why not give it a try.

As a southerner I am fundamentally pre-programmed to like most of these dishes because they have the same principals of many southern dishes. Slow cooked pork, greens, rice, gravy, fried chicken steak, and a mayo heavy pasta salad as a nice foil to the abundance of savory flavors.

I had the pork lau lau combo which came with 2 scoops of rice a side of the ceviche style ahi poke salad and that coconut pudding that I could happily eat every day for the rest of my life. All of this was $10 and the portion was too much for me to finish and made for great leftovers the next day.

This place has the typical kitschy interior that you would expect with any small hawaiian joint. And the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful with making suggestions based on my limited experience with the cuisine.
Although this place is now a bit of a drive from me, and for anybody else who is not in the extreme SW, it is beyond worth the drive.

Furikake shrimp: Overcooked, dry, salty. Ate only one piece

Kalbi short rib: ALL BURNT! After cutting out burnt parts, not much meat left to eat. It was bland and lacked flavor, but I thought bland is rather better than too sweet or salty.. 

Chicken katsu: Dry and not so crispy. Katsu dipping sauce is too thick and salty. 

Spam musubi: I didn't try so no comment on food but when my husband ordered, he had asked if they have teriyaki musubi as that is our son's favorite. They said they don't but they can give us teriyaki sauce on the side. My husband said ok and surprisingly, we were charged $1.75 for the teriyaki sauce.

The atmosphere: It reminded me so much of home.  They had satellite radio playing Hawaiian tunes; a very nice touch.  It wasn't done up all crazy, just a few pictures here and there, a wall fixture of the islands.  It had a very personal feel to it.  It reminded me of places we would eat when I was younger in Waianae; the same fading color scheme and plants, same kitchen layout.  It actually made me quite nostalgic.

After Aloha Grill closed down and Aloha Kitchen kind of went downhill, I thought my only hope for Hawaiian food would be the Marketstreet Cafe at the Cal, and I only go there for the saimin anyway.  But my ""haole"" friend as he refers to himself, instructed that it was CRUCIAL I check out Island Flavor.  I am so happy that I did.  Amazing food, and great quality for the price.  I was afraid it would be more on the pricy side because of other reviews, but that wasn't the case at all.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the bill.

2554158,2017-08-25,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,This was the worst Hawaiian food I've ever tasted! I'm not sure if I just ordered the wrong food or what happened since there are such high reviews here. I ordered the poke shoyu and the mixed plate with chicken katsu and Kalua cabbage. The poke was okay the sauce was very salty to me compared to what I've had before but I was able to eat all of it. The chicken katsu didn't have any sauce I'm not sure if it's suppose to come with it or not but the breaded chicken itself tasted like chicken nuggets you'd get from a banquet frozen dinner and the Kalua cabbage had No flavor no smokiness or any seasoning and was SUPER dry.

This place was poppin, even at 8pm. About 10 people outside and two couples in front of us. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and was pleasantly surprised to see live music  being played inside. They have live music on Friday and Saturday evenings between 6-8:30pm. 

We checked out the menu and ordered the furikake chicken 5/5 with fried rice and veggies and the chicken Katsu loco moco 4/5. The servings were extra large which meant plenty to take home for leftovers. Overall delicious Hawaiian style food.

I wanted to try the spam musubi but they were sold out. Will have to give it a try on my next visit.

The desserts also looked very delicious but we were so full we didn't save room.

The service was great and very nice 5/5. And the 10% Yelp cash back made everything a little better :-)",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,7,3,5,roZr8_Uy_43nIXLGl45ing

2577710,2014-08-30,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Two year's ago when my Family and I first ate here it was decent, nothing crazy amazing, but decent for local food with big portions and good mac salad. We didn't frequent here much after two years cause its a ways from where we live and like I said, the food is okay, not worth the drive for us. Last weekend my cousin ate here and said their poke was ono and we should give this place another try; so we did! 

The service was awful from the minute we walked in, granted it was a Fri nite, we didnt know they played hawaiian music on the weekends so they where busy. The cashier/fill in server (heavy set girl) was rude as hell! Chomping a mile a minute on her gum, no smile, no greeting and says ""you guys got reservations?"" I said ""No"", She then tells us ""I gotta check if we can serve you guys den"", and walks off. Wow!!! Local kine style would be...No worries, we goin make room for you guys, not to mention the fact that I don't know of any restaurant that would turn customers away! We immediately felt unwelcomed/uncomfortable from the get. I'm local, born and raised in Hawaii, so the lack of Aloha ecspecially from a Hawaiian place put me off even more!

She comes back tells us kay can, as she's seating us I tell her ""sorry, I didn't know we needed to make a reservation"", she tells us ""no you no need, but mandatory that you do""... Huh?!?. As Im looking around, there is 3-4 tables with reserved signs. The table we got sat at, the one next to us(customers sat about the same time we did) and other tables with people already sitting had no reserved signs. Not to mention the fact that no customers came in after us for any reservations, just a couple people coming in to pick up their takeout order, so I don't get why she needed to ask if we could be served in the first place. The vibe I got was like, who you? You not our regulars, hurry up eat & get out! 

She seats us, right off the bat not letting us even look at the menu ask, ""what we wanted to drink"". I remember two years ago they had p.o.g . Was not even sure if they still had it? Wanted to at least ask my kids and Husband to see what they wanted to drink, we didnt even get the chance! Her attitude was hurry the f* up!, we ended up just getting waters after being rudely rushed. She brings us our waters and is ready to take our order, I was unsure of what I wanted so I asked if we could get a minute more. She looked irritated and walks off. She comes back 10 min later, giving me dirty looks. I'm trying to order and she's cutting me off while I'm talking, ""you cant order it like dat, what you said? On da side?"" Her attitude was just plain rude, again, like hurry the f* up! 

We get our food and it was not good. The lau lau plate was a chunk of dry, tasteless pork wrapped in one thin layer of luau leaves(luke warm in the middle and shaped like a rectangle loaf, looked nothing like lau lau) bummer it had no butterfish either. Worse part, as I'm eating my rice I find a short black hair in the middle...ewww! my Husbands terri beef meat was chewy and burnt, my daughter said her korean wings where dry and bland. The poke was ono and the mac salad was still as good tho. 

We already felt uncomfortable and just wanted to leave. Since we paid $50 for our food, we didnt want to just throw it out and thought we could give the leftovers to our dogs. We asked for boxes and got no bag for our 5 boxes, before we could even ask for a bag from a server (not the rude one) they ran off! You would think to give a bag if the customer got that many boxes no? 

Needless to say, we will not be returning here again. Rude unwelcoming service and subpar local food!",fYubasho7eQ5yU9jfT5ZNw,0,0,1,0rlTpzGK9j2RD0hcxOyUuA

    Huge portions, a beef teriyaki plate will feed my two year old, my fiancé and I for only 9$ but we order our own food and fight over the leftovers hehe. 
    As for the decor, it could be a bit nicer but it makes it more comfortable then a big fancy restaurant.

I went quite a ways out of my way to eat here. All the reviews gave me hope for a good meal. I ordered a combo plate of chicken teriyaki and kalbi short ribs. To order the ribs in the combo is an extra $1. The plate came with 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of macaroni and a mountain of meat. I could not finish it all so now I have leftovers for later. The ribs had great flavor but they were kind of fatty, though that is where the flavor is... The chicken teriyaki was moist, not too sweet nor too salty.  All of this was $13 and change plus tip. Oh, and the waitress was good at refilling my water when I needed it and she brought be sriracha when I asked for it so she's good people in my book.

My family and I have tried other places and Island Flavor has everyone beat!  We've been living in Vegas for more than 10 years (born and raised in Honolulu) so we have a very good idea at what makes up good ""local kind grindz""!

The food is so ono (delicious, for my non Hawaiians) and the portions are, as President Trump would say, YUGE!!! I had my usual mixed plate consisting of furikake chicken and steak and onions!  Yummy!  Wife had the same chicken and kalbi, younger kids shared a chicken katsu and older son and his girlfriend had two different versions of the loco moco.  Her loco moco had roast pork and his had chicken katsu.  Yeah, they were all good!  Wife and I shared a large slice of haupia ice cream pie for dessert. The whole meal was a festival of flavors in our mouths!

Along with the food, the ambiance of the place is worth mentioning too.  It always brings us home to Hawaii.  There's Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is decorated with Hawaii themed memorabilia and the workers are friendly, just like the people back home.

Bottom line: don't waste your time with the other places, they just don't stack up.  If you're craving truly authentic local Hawaiian food, then this is the place to be, period!",66ix4MMfGUOOM-iPbZWY6Q,3,1,5,tFce6J9TxWQOwbBbsWTaLQ

2627994,2017-01-24,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Island Flavor is a go-to spot for a LOT of my friends during their trips to Vegas so I figured my trip wouldn't be complete unless I went, too! I honestly went in with pretty high expectations because of all the hype built up by my friends and I was not disappointed. My friend and I shared the spam musubi, furikake chicken, and the hawaiian roast pork with gravy.

SPAM MUSUBI. WOW. Honestly one of the best musubi's I've ever had. Everyone talks about how it's so simple to make, but every time I've tried to make it isn't quite as good as ordering from a Hawaiian restaurant. The rice was perfectly cooked and the furikake in the middle was a nice, sweet touch.

FURIKAKE CHICKEN. Okay, the hype for this is definitely real. And I wish they had this in LA. It reminded me of orange chicken, but with a slightly sweeter sauce. The breading of the chicken was really crispy but the inside of the chicken incredibly tender. So. Bomb.

HAWAIIAN ROAST PORK. This was a bit eh for me. I love the gravy that Hawaiians enjoy topping on their meat and I was definitely not disappointed by the gravy. The pork was very soft and tender but it had way too much fat on it and was not that pleasant. It was also a little tooo peppery for my taste.

All in all though, I was pretty impressed by Island Flavor. Especially because of it's cheap price and huuuuge portions  Definitely will be coming by again!",QFiRMxKrZEt8puAv4vzPoQ,1,1,4,y8F66JTqTGcQZqYIPNPdxA

2645756,2014-10-17,22,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Aloha! I know it's odd getting Hawaiian food in Vegas but apparently, they do have a huge population of Hawaiians, thus the good restaurants you'll find here. Island Flavor is one perfect example.

We started with their very fresh shoyu POKE for appetizers. Half an order is half a pound for $7.25. It's hefty so it really is a steal! Color, taste, and texture of the tuna passed our standards with flying colors. 

With so many good things on their menu, it's rather convenient that they offer you the option to order a MIXED PLATE ($11.25) with two items and a side of rice (white or brown) plus salad or macaroni salad. Kalbi is an extra $1 but trust me when I say it's money well-spent. FURIKAKE CHICKEN and KALBI were my two choices. The chicken had a beautiful sweet and sour glazed exterior with seaweed flakes drizzled on it. Each bite had a good crisp and could make you work on a chew, but in a good way. The Kalbi beef was marinated and grilled to perfection pleasing my tastebuds while getting envious looks from others on the table who didn't order this. I looooove their macaroni salad here so don't be like my sister who opted to get a salad of greens and regretting it shortly after having a taste of my side order. 

The ROASTED PORK are shreds of meat doused with their own version of gravy that is out-of-this-world delicious. The taste reminds me so much of eating ""lechon"", a Filipino dish which is literally, roasted pork. In addition, their CHICKEN KATSU is remarkably right on the money. The breading was great in all aspects and how everything held together execution-wise was simply perfection. Our server messed up our order and gave us Korean chicken wings instead of the katsu in the beginning but she fixed it right away without even taking back the wings. Their KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS was bone-in with crispy skin outside and juicy meat inside. Flavor profile was good but I've had better. Bottom line, it's free so I can't complain.

It seems like the CHICKEN KATSU LOCO MOCO is the deal here so we also ordered that to share. An order is ginormous just like everything else we had. We only consumed half of it and took the rest home but the rave reviews on this dish is true to its words. A specialty not to be missed indeed!

Their GUAVA CAKE ($5) however was easily almost everyone's highlight on the table including those without a sweet tooth. Pair with it their refillable Kona coffee because there's just no other way for you to end a meal here. Ahhhfreakingmazing! Not only is it pretty in pink but the cake itself is moist and each layer of icing and guava syrup delivered its purpose giving you that tropical flavor you thought you could only get from the islands. Easily the best thing I ate here!

Service was a bit spotty, almost like on island mode but nonetheless they were friendly. With onolicious food, generous portions, and reasonable pricing, it's worth the little drive off the strip. 4.5 Stars!",kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw,24,23,4,WmGyYkGoq0cbjP485hgfEg

Hoisin Baby Back Ribs: Skeptical at first but dude, these rival the best baby backs that I've ever had.  Perfect crispiness on the outside.  Moist, fall-off-the-bone meat on the inside.  Perfect sweet glaze.  I think this was my favorite thing we tried.

Furikake Chicken: Wonderfully flavored.  Moist chunks of chicken.  Just good.

Kona Coffee: Yep... I'm putting the coffee on here cause it was good.  Another one I was skeptical of cause it came out of a typical diner style 'dennys' pot, but it was actually flavorful.  

Chicken Katsu Loco Moco: Probably had overly high expectations on this one, so wasn't as much of a fan as other people, but its still very good.  Gravy is flavorful and the egg just makes everything better.  

Guava Cake: We were all pretty stuffed after our meal so we were gonna pass on dessert.  We decided to share the guava cake though and OMG... so good!  Very light.  Not too sweet.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.  More coffee please!

The only thing I would complain about is the service.  Dude that waited for us was slow and didn't seem to care.  Yeah, you could call him laid back, but it was almost like he knew he was getting an 18% tip cause we had a party of 6 and didn't even try.

The salad was very simple just cut romaine with a couple of slices of some type of sweet purple potato (?), cucumber and tomato.  The dressing was really good and it was topped with all these crispy fried wontons.  nothing special, but pleasing.

Hubby and I always get the same thing - half a Furikake ahi poke order, and we share a combo plate of Kalbi ribs and Korean fried chicken.. with extra macaroni salad and fries.

My boyfriend and I were looking for some dinner options and stumbled upon this restaurant via yelp (thank you )

He orders the furikake chicken and i order the teriyaki chicken salad (watching my girlish figure.. pssh not really)

Anywho 
Furikake Chicken portion basically can feed 2 ppl (yup that huge of a portion)
and my salad was huge as well

both of us ended up eating only half of our dinner entrees and the rest was eaten for lunch the next day.

Taste wise?
Furikake chicken is so yummy! (yes i took a lil bit from my bfs plate cause it looked so appetizing) So crispy, soy saucy and sweet all at the same time

Teriyaki chicken salad came with a huge amount of creamy dressing - i only used half of it. It tasted of sesame oil/ garlicky goodness 
The salad had lettuce, tomatoes, crispy wontons and taro/ube in it! so satisfying!! wouldve liked more tomatoes though

Overall.. bomb food.. reasonably priced. This restaurant is here to stay",xdbL4b_vCIjxNtBwgBdv6Q,2,0,4,wFualqRDKvuZXetQZaL6Hg

We didn't have to wait too long to get seated, but there were plenty of people coming in and out. The only down fall was they seemed a bit short staffed, so getting our drinks and ordering took a little longer than what we were used to.

2797485,2014-04-20,3,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Was in the area around lunch time and I mean literally in the area because this place is really out there. About a couple miles west of the 215 off the Durango exit, you will find a little bit paradise at this location. Well, foodwise anyway. 

As you come in, you will see that they have plenty of tables. Since it was lunchtime it was a bit busy but I was still able to get an open table. I was greeted warmly and was sat down right away. 

Looking over the menu, I decided to go with the mixed plate combo of Kalbi Ribs and Kalua Pork. I went with Brown rice for no extra charge which is a plus. Lastly, it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad.

I got 3 nice pieces of Kalbi Ribs. I thought they were a bit on the salty end but still ok. The Kalua Pork came in a cup mixed with cabbage and basically in its own cooked juices. Good flavor. The Macaroni Salad was really good. I can taste the pepper that has been mixed into it. The Brown Rice was a bit dry like they cooked it early in the morning and it has been on warm the whole time. Overall I think the Ribs could have been a little less salty and the Brown Rice maybe could of had some kind of teriyaki sauce on it so that it wouldnt of been so bland.

Service was pretty good. Got everything I needed in a timely manner. I spent a total of 13 bucks and some change because the if you get the Kalbi Ribs as one of your choices, its a dollar extra. 

Overall, its not a bad to place to eat especially if you are in the area. Next time I am thinking of trying their Poke Salad although people have said that it has doubled in price. I guess I missed out on those days then. Once I try it, we will see if its worth the price.

Feeding my Hawaiian food addiction, we finally ventured to Egypt to eat here. I've eaten here before, but it's been years and wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered. After looking at pics prior to our visit, we opted for sesame poke, furikake chicken and kalbi short ribs. When our food finally arrived, we both knew there was no way we were going to eat all of it.

The poke came out first. They offer different flavors; furikake, shoyu or sesame. We opted for the sesame and it was delish.  Lots of onions for crunch, fresh fish and a good amount of seasoning. 5 stars.

I ordered the furikake chicken which comes with macaroni salad and I opted for brown rice. For everyone who doesn't know what furikake is, it's a seasoning containing bits of seaweed, sesame seeds and salt. The chicken was fried to a good crisp and the furikake added that extra flavor. The mac salad was good and creamy, a bit heavy on the mayo but it was still good. The only  thing I didn't like was the brown rice. It was just too mushy. It was like normal white rice but brown. I like the pieces of my brown rice not to be stuck together. Had to drop this to 3 stars cuz the rice was a huge disappointment. 

The bf ordered the Kalbi ribs. These ribs were like Kalbi ribs on steroids. (Only saying that for description.) They were huge, thick pieces of meat, not the thinner pieces you are normally used to eating. Good char on the meat and good ratio of fat. 5 stars for this.

Long story:
My sister was visiting with her baby and I wanted to take her, the baby, my dad and my brother somewhere near my area for a quick lunch. I found Island Flavor on my Yelp app and liked what I saw. It wasn't very packed when we came in and they had enough room for our small stroller. Immediately noticed our waitress seemed perturbed that we had brought the stroller in. As we sat down, my sister noticed that her child needed a diaper change so she asked the waitress if they had a changing area in their restroom. Nope. But that was ok, not all restaurants have this luxury. So she took her baby back to the car to change her there. She was back in around 10 minutes and as soon as she sat down, our waitress came by and asked if we were ready to order. We look up at her quizzically because I was sure that she saw my sister just sat down. The waitress scowling then adds, ""Are you ready? Yes or no?"" I chose to ignore her curt behavior at that moment. My sister quickly made a decision and we got our food. 

The portions were very plentiful. My dad and sister's order of kalbi ribs was pretty good. My porkchops however were bland and were not grilled as how I imagined porkchops would be. My brother's chicken barbecue was just OK but not as good as other hawaiian barbecue places. After we all got a drink refill, our surly waitress never came back to check on us. I even had to ask for the check from another waitress who I overheard talking to another customer. I believe she said that the owner was at the cash register and that our sour waitress was apparently the owner's daughter. Well, after what seemed like forever, the entire restaurant is almost empty and no waitress to take our credit card, we all get up and I hand our payment to the cashier/owner. I believe we have been perfectly reasonable customers and the baby didn't even make a big fuss so I'm very perturbed by this place. More unforgivable that an owner shows bad customer service at a hawaiian restaurant. The aloha spirit has left this building, folks.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,2,0,2,ul7kChEQkIh-yq9ZxBASTQ

He did a great job making people laugh, having some playful banter and just keeping the overall mood light and fun. Be sure to tip the performer too if you find yourself grooving along :D. I got the Laulau which is usually only available on Friday nights. It contains haupia (coconut-flavored) and smoked fish flavors, but I happen to be a really big fan of those seemingly conflicting tastes and would definitely order it again. The other Hawaiian staples all look delicious here and their portions are huge! You'll definitely have enough food for breakfast or lunch the next day and I would recommend everyone at the table getting something different so you can get a taste of everything. I've also been craving POG since I was last in Hawaii, so I was excited to see that they give 50 cent refills here! I was super appreciative that the owner took time to talk to us on a busy night and welcome us since it was our first time here. He even apologized for the not-so-long wait, which was actually the most enjoyable wait I've ever had at any restaurant.

YUCK! Then the roasted pork was so salty & dry. DOUBLE YUCK. We also ordered the Korean chicken wings, they were okay, that's it & the pork fried rice was bland & funky tasting. There was plenty of food, but it was horrible. We figured they may be able to redeem themselves with the Haupia cake.... .nope, it sucked too.

The entire staff is very cool, but service can be very much like a bottle neck from 95 going to the spaghetti bowl during rush hour, but what the heck, this is a Big Island restaurant....we all take our time, and get it right most of the time.

When I come here, I usually get the teriyaki beef, and Korean chicken combo.   The portion is are opu-busting, and teriyaki is very good.   The chicken was a pre made fried chicken, but the Hawaiian style Korean sauce this chicken is dipped in made it a keeper.   

Why the four stars, the Portuguese bean soup is too darn sweet, and have way too many beans, and not enough meat.  Also the mac salad was a bland Oahu style mac salad...not too impressive with those two items.

2901988,2009-02-05,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"THE INCIDENT
I found Island Flavor by mistake one day while getting gas at the local Short Line Express.  It just so happens while I was at the pump, I miraculously look away from the ever-changing numbers of the digital LCD and see ""GRAND OPENING"" for a Hawaiian themed restaurant.   It must have been fate that I saw it or close enough for me to see since I'm near blind as a bat.  Hmm, Hawaiian sounded good to me that night...yummo!  So, since I paid for my gas w/my debit card, I trudged my rear end into the Short Line Express for a pack of cigs and to ask the store clerk if she thought the restaurant was any good.  In her thick Asian accent, ""Oh yes!  Vewwy goo!!!  Goo, goo.""  Sho'nuff, she was right!!  

THE PARKING LOT
Because I'm lazy, I drive from the convenience store to Island Flavor, which is in the same parking lot, possibly 100 feet away.  HEY, they made cars for a reason!!!!!

Island Flavor is on the right side of a strip mall next to Short Line Express convenience store.  The strip mall also houses a dance studio, massage parlor, Familia Pizzeria (I just posted a review for this one), and some other small businesses.  If you are looking for an easy way to find it while driving, look for Bomas Bar & Grill.  Island Flavor is fairly new, in fact, I had to ""Add a Business"" on Yelp to review it.  When I got into the restaurant the server told me it just opened back in October 2008.

THE DECOR
Anyways, once inside there wasn't much ambiance.  I think they're still trying to find their niche to whom they will identify with.  Though, the waitresses did wear floral blouses with dark trousers.  In the center of the restaurant sits a large square granite bar which looks like it was supposed to be a hibachi grill or regular bar.  There's no alcohol back there or any cooking utensils.  Who knows?  I only know this because I chose to sit up there while I waited for my (take out) food; I didn't want to disturb any of the waitresses' clean tables.  Around the bar, there sits about a dozen or so plain dining tables.  

THE MENU
Ahh...this is what you really want to read...They serve all of the traditional island fare from...ahi, burgers, chicken katsu, KALUA PIG, kalbi ribs, loco moco, mixed plates, saimin, teriyaki.  For my fellow SPAM lovers, I did NOT see musubi.  Maybe we have to ask?  Okay, so this is how I judge Hawaiian restaurants...kalua pig.  Theirs was EXCELLENT, BOMB SHIZZLE, FANeff'NTASTIC!  The downside...their prices are a tid bit higher ($1-2 more) than your other Hawaiian restaurants.  To me, it's still worth it.  I guess you figured out what I ordered for take out, Kalua Pig (no cabbage) w/rice and a side of brown gravy.  The total was $10.51 w/tax included.

THE HOURS TO COME BY
Monday-Friday 11am-9pm
Saturday           11am-8pm
Sundays & Holidays Closed

THE CONCLUSION
When we dine or get take out here again, I'll update this review to include more of their menu.  Support the locals, this place impressed me with their food.  Oh yeah, my bf who had my leftovers thought it was EXCELLENT, BOMB SHIZZLE, FANeff'NTASTIC as well!",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,5,3,5,T6VZfYut0JtlkAL6wsoG5A
2911635,2016-08-02,7,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I love days like today. I love it when I discover a fantastic place that serves tasty and flavorful food, with generous portions, providing friendly service, .....and all at a good price. Today we discovered Island Flavor! 

In an effort to try as many different things as we could we each ordered a Mixed Plate Combo (which comes with your choice of 2 meats, rice/or fries, salad/or mac salad.) ($11.25 each, with an added charge of $1.00 for kalbi). I ordered the kalbi and teriyaki beef while my friend ordered the furikake chicken and hamburger steak. We both had the white rice and mac salad as sides and also ordered a side of fried rice with portugese sausage.

- Portion sizes are very generous! We actually ended up taking some of the food to go because we quickly realized how much we had ordered! lol Very filling and very satisfying!
- I tried all 4 meats and have to say that all 4 were tremendous! The teriyaki beef and kalbi certainly stood out for me in  big way. These are going to be two items that I will be ordering quite frequently in the future! So juicy and each item packed so much flavor!
- With that being said, this was my first time trying furikake chicken and I was not disappointed at all! Very crisp outer layer and juicy, meaty, and tender inside! The hamburger steak was also some of the best I've had in recent memory!
- Service was fantastic from the word go! We were acknowledged and seated right away. Refills were taken care of in a friendly and expeditious fashion. Everyone I interacted with was friendly and smiling. I can't think of a way it could have gone better from a service standpoint. Very, very satisfied.

This is a slam dunk as far as I am concerned. You can bet that we will be here many times in the future for both dining in and taking orders to go! What a great find!

I love days like this! Now I'm ready to lay down and take a nap after eating all that  delicious goodness!

The portions here are fit for a proper luau. You get an inordinate amount of food for most humans to consume in a single serving, so I highly advise splitting dishes unless you're the type to go HAM at buffets - which, in Vegas, wouldn't be hard to believe.

Mixed plate is my jam: 2 meats with 2 scoops of rice for about $12 is unbeatable. With kalbi (an extra $1) and furikake - my tummy is rumbling just thinking about how good it was.

Did I mention how much food you get here? I left a couple pieces of chicken on my plate because I was about to burst, and my hotel room didn't have a fridge for leftovers. Garrett O., where are you???

The overall environment is what you'd expect of a Hawaiian restaurant - friendly, laid back, chill. You feel like a part of the family by just dining here.

Being a business owner myself, of course I didn't want to leave my order uncalled for so I went down a few blocks and retrieved my order from Island Flavor. What a pleasant surprise!

I only ordered two plates: chicken Katsu and kalbi beef (?). The question mark is there because I swear when she confirmed the order it sounded so different than how I had pronounced it. 

That beef was insane! So tender and delicious. The Katsu was good as to be expected at other Hawaiian places I've been.

It's absolutely the best hawaiian dining place I've been to in Vegas. At other places, things are a but too dry, a bit too chewy, a bit too small. This place hit all the marks. 

My only gripe was the wings were a *bit* too salty. Just a bit. They've got just the right amount of breading, crunch, moisture, sweetness, and savoriness. They're just a skooch too salty. The Kalbi was the real surprise here. I always feel like Kalbi's a gamble. This kalbi was a good one. Not too sweet, not too chewy, not too fatty, and they give you a nice meat-cuttin' knife just to make it that much easier on you. 

This place is dope. I was in a hurry to get back to work, had a brain fart, forgot to leave a tip while paying at the register, I'll be back at 5:10, right after I get off work PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME. FIVE STARS.

2944617,2012-05-21,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"This was my first time trying Hawaiian bbq, and I must say, that while I enjoyed the flavors and tastes, I felt the execution was rather poor.

While we didn't have to wait for a table (party of 2-myself and my boyfriend), we did wait an extremely long time for a server to come take our drink orders. They seemed very understaffed for a Friday afternoon/early evening. Our server was very nice, and she even brought out a sample of their special stew for me to try, and she gave me props for even trying it, considering I'd never had Hawaiian food before. I ended up ordering a combination plate with chicken katsu and beef teriyaki. 

After the waitress took our food orders, a rather large party of 10 or so people came in, and she asked us if we would mind moving to another table to accomodate the party (pushing the tables/chairs together), so we moved, and she said she would give us dessert on the house, which I thought was really nice of her.

We ended up waiting around 40 minutes for our food. I was starving at this point. They must have been short staffed in the kitchen as well. I dug in to my food the second I got it. Their macaroni salad was divine. I have never had macaroni salad that tasted that good before; it was this creamy and salty sensation that hit all the right taste buds. I wish I had more of it. Their rice was just as amazing. I felt like I could have eaten 4 scoops of it instead of 2. 

The entrees weren't as good as I hoped. The chicken were cut into huge pieces, which I thought was a plus, but that katsu sauce was extremely salty and potent. I only put a dab onto each piece and it still overpowered the chicken completely. I didn't care for the sauce at all. It was so salty and meaty tasting (probably loaded with MSG) that it made me dislike the dish. I had better hope for the beef teriyaki, but that let me down as well. It was again, extremely salty, almost to the point of where I couldn't eat it. The meat wasn't cooked uniformly, some pieces were immensely rare, and others were extremely well done. The meat was also very fatty, and I didn't enjoy having to constantly cut off the fatty parts from the meaty parts.

The meal was really saved by dessert. Their mud pie was so huge! I have never seen one like that before. It was covered in whipped cream (yum), nuts, and a duo of caramel and chocolate sauces along with a drizzle of honey. It was perfection. I wanted to eat all of it, but alas, my stomach is only so big. I savored the parts with the crust the most, but this was definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

Overall, the service was good, the wait times were atrocious, and the food was hit or miss; thus, deserving of 3 stars.",-zWAApe_-ZLX5HfyAsaLQg,2,2,3,FaeJu5JQWhuB4hZR55RV-w

Ummm, I totally Yelped this place a week before going to Vegas and came here twice in three days.

So I totally live for plate lunch.  Note that my profile's ""last meal on earth"" is Hawaiian plate lunch, and my home city is surprisingly short on Hawaiian restaurants. (So short the number is zero.) So I had to get a fix in! Or two or five.

The meals here are so big that it just hurts. There's a reason why 90% of the bouncers at XS are Samoan. They don't get that kind of mass needed to punch creepy misbehaving guys in clubs by eating salad. I've made 5 meals out of my 2.

This is the most legit Hawaiian food I have had in the lower 48. Everything is seasoned well and tastes sooo bombbbbb. SO. MUCH. FLAVOR. 

Service - 5/5 All the waiters working here are legit! Either they got island accents or fake them like bosses. Love how genuinely nice they are. Service is not over-the-top or fake. Just nice people being nice and bringing me tasty things. (If you split a plate, don't forget to tip like you ordered two entrees! These guys won't make sheet otherwise!)

Food:
Basic menu is on website, but they have a paper insert with daily specials. So if you're calling an order for take-out, ask them if what the specials of the day are! Also, the desserts aren't on the menu. They are listed on the table (see picture). 

Aloha Friday: Come early so you can get a seat! This place is jam packed on Friday! They have the most amazing family come out and play bass, uke, and guitar while singing traditional Hawaiian music. I grew up on an island, and it felt like coming home. I didn't realize I was getting my soul healed while eating lau lau.

- Lau lau- 5/5 wrapped in delicious leaves, juicy, and the perfect saltiness when you eat it with rice!
- Lomi salmon- 2/5 This was almost all tomato and no salmon :( I guess it counted as my vegetable of the day?
- Mac Salad- the guy asked me ""Are you sure?"" when I said I was fine with the mac salad and white rice. Was he expecting me to sub a vegetable instead? Please, bee-atch. I'm not from California.
- Kalbi ribs- 5/5 These are BOMB! Way thick slices and grilled with a nice caramelization on them! They don't skimp, and the pieces are super big! 
- Furikake chicken- 5/5 Super crunchy exterior so that it stands up to the glaze and stays super crunchy. You know how Panda Express orange chicken gets all soft if it's been sitting there awhile? No flaccid chicken here, folks.
- Haupia cake- 5/5 I used to work at a bakery on island, and we made haupia cake. Theirs here is even better. The cake itself is perfect density, and the flavor is dynamite.
- Kona pie- 2/5 Ehhhh eat the haupia and guava cake instead! The coffee flavor isn't strong, and the other sauces they schlepp on the plate overpower any coffee taste.

I'm glad this place isn't in my home city. I'm not looking for employment as a Samoan bouncer at XS quite yet, which is what I would probably be if I lived in Vegas and continued eating here.

I wasn't very impressed with their food at all but I thought it was because it was more of a fast food restaurant. I read all the great reviews about Island Flavor and was anxious to give it a shot. The restaurant itself is clean and the staff is pretty friendly. I ordered the Hawaiian Special which was LauLau with a side of fried rice, macaroni salad, some fish and tomatoes, and a creamy white dessert. 

LauLau is tender BBQ'd pork served in some type of edible leaf. I was told the leaves were edible so I cut it all up and added the house bbq sauce. The leaf was very bitter and odd tasting. It completely ruined the flavor of EVERYTHING else that was in my mouth so I moved as much of it aside as I could. After that, the meal wasn't horrible, but it didn't really impress me either. My friend ordered the saimin which is a bowl of ramen in broth and sprinkled with egg, imitation seafood and vegetables. He told me the broth was incredibly bland.

I had a hard time choosing between chicken katsu and the katsu loco moco. They both sounded SOO SO OSOO OOSOOSOOO good! Not to mention the people around me were eating katsu loco mocos and I might have droooled a little...

But I stuck with ordering the plain katsu because I knew I wasnt going to be able to finish all of my food and so I thought it would be easier to save! Saving a katsu loco moco makes me think of soggy chicken katsu and Idk if I am really a fan of that.

Katsu was ON POINT. I love it when katsu is crispy and their katsu was just that! Omg and their macaroni salad was super delicious too. They have huge pieces of pepper and it really gave your mouth a little kick while eating it.. i enjoyed that. 2 scoops rice, a mound of katsu and 1 scoop mac salad for $9??? WIN. WIN. WIN. 

They also give you a nice container of sauce. Im a sauce lover so I NEED lots of sauce :3

This place is located in a plaza that's not hard to locate. The restaurant itself was pretty clean, and a little bigger than the other hawaiian restaurants I've been too. We were seated quickly upon arriving and the employees were all pretty friendly and attentive. 

Most of the menu items looked amazing, but thanks to Yelp I narrowed it down to two dishes. To be honest I really wanted to try a little bit of everything. We ordered the Korean Chicken (chicken wings fried Korean style) and the Chicken Katsu Loco Moco. I instantly fell in love with the loco moco. I've never had it in this style before and the gravy that it was covered in wasn't too overpowering. I was told the gravy is homemade in the back by the owner's grandmother (I'm not exactly sure if this is true).

I have eaten at some of the best places in the islands, including Helena's where I have gone multiple times.  I gots to tell ya that the food at Island Flavor is AT LEAST as good as Helena's, and in some respects even better.  Everything was fresh, and real, and traditional.  The place is family owned, with the family being from Kona on the Big Island.  Portions were huge.  The oxtail soup was to die for.  Even the macaroni salad, which I normally hate, was very good with not too much mayo.  This place is awesome, Brudah.  Mahalo.",Le-wJmJuLdSB1GAa47lByA,0,0,5,h5M59f8ESYOydl5eXVMmpg
3153972,2015-03-04,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"We tried this place about a month ago and had a pretty bad time. Firstly, we went with a group and the food took a very long time to come out. Of course longer waits are expected with a larger party, but it was a slow night and we waited much longer than anticipated. Then I had an extra wait because there was a mistake with my order (not the correct rice).

I wasn't really fond of the roast pork loco moco. I enjoyed the first bite but after that all I could taste was gravy. I only managed to get through about 1/3 of my meal because it was extremely filling, which brings me to the topic of our server.

Our server was the reason I was so irked after our visit here. After we got our food he commented on how little I was eating at least 2-3 times, and then again when we were on our way out. I thought it was very rude. The portions were huge and I actually ate all that I could eat - I am a paying customer, do not criticize me for how much of my food I decide to eat. It would have been one thing if I had wasted my leftovers, but I was taking it home anyway. On top of that, I thought he had an overall condescending and judgmental attitude while taking our orders and whenever he spoke to us throughout the meal. I am generally an easy going guest, honestly I can't even think of another time where I have ever disliked a server aside from the guy we had here.

Our last issue came when it was time to pay the bill. One person in our group paid the entire bill and didn't realize until after he paid that gratuity had already been added on the price. He said it didn't show on the receipt that he signed, and he didn't realize until we were on our way out that he had paid two times more tip than he should have. I didn't see the receipt myself so I can't pinpoint the issue here - but it added to the overall negative feeling of my experience here, especially because it was a large bill (and subsequently a large tip).

On the plus side, the hostess who greeted us on our way in/out was very nice. And again, portions are huge and gravy is plentiful - so if that's what you're into then I can see this being a nice place for that, but for us it was an awful experience.",k8okFWX0acPR8c4L7XM55A,3,1,1,FmxDvNYEuazSBz9J6nDbmg

I have a grand feeling that everything on that menu is just as delicious as the meal I had that night. 

Now, what really made me cry tears of joy was the kona coffee mud pie. That thing is huge! It easily fed our party of 4. The yummy coffee ice cream, whipped cream, oreo cookie crust and macadamia nuts was marvelous!

It wasn't our first time here, but tonight was the first time we were disappointed out of all the times we've eaten here... it's a Friday night, I was excited Bc there was live music which I always enjoy. my parents ordered the Aloha Friday special which is choice of pork lau lau or Kalua pig with rice, Mac salad, lomi lomi And Haupia... I ordered the Korean chicken, which was very good -- no complaints about that! However, the aloha Friday special was very disappointing.. Our server told us in advance that they ran out of lomi lomi and for both the Lau Lau and Kalua pig, it would be $7 extra and I told her that's fine.. Soo when we got the aloha Friday special plate, there was Lau Lau + Mac salad + rice and a bowl of Kalua pig on the side.. when we finished our plate, I asked the server if we're getting our Haupia and she said, ""oh, we ran out of that too."" -__- my only reaction was ""WOW!"" all I could do was shake my head.. if she told me that both the lomi lomi and Haupia they ran out off, In advance, then We woulda ordered something else but server failed to mention all.. seriously though, you might as well have said that they were sold out of the aloha Friday special instead of serving half the plate.. I basically paid for a full entree, but only get ¾ of the order.. That's crazy to me.. for the aloha Friday special, it cost me $18.75 ($11 for the lau Lau, rice, and Mac salad + $7.75 for the bowl of Kalua pig) that was NOT WORTH THE PRICE! Our server should've offered something to compensate what they ran out of OR discount the price of the plate!!! would you pay that much for ¾ of what you ordered?! hell no! I will post a picture to reference this review and owners and workers of island flavor, please tell me if that aloha special plate was worth $18.75 Bc I can tell you and others I've shared this with can tell you it's not!!! and then you got the nerve to charge me full price?! Or not even offer anything to compensate for the lomi lomi and Haupia?! I'm not one to complain but that just made our experience tonight, a horrible one.. I still tipped, only 10% because the service could have been better.. Our server didn't even smile once to us or the table next to us.. and she didn't even check up on us, not once.. Island flavor should really take this into consideration.. You shouldn't be charging your customers full price and not give them the full order.. It's not fair.. I left a comment on the receipt as well.. so please take this as constrictive criticism.. the next time we eat here, I don't want to have another experience like this..",djhTDOPd87TOdd7XVCep5g,3,0,2,jg9u_lwdoW6r5yHVUfZMcA

The roast pork is very moist with great pork flavor. The gravy on top makes it all the more savory. Smothered over some rice and bam! Just a good ol' fashion local kine meal. The loco moco is similar to ones I've had in Hawaii but that is exactly what we were looking for. The ahi in Vegas is not as fresh as it is in Hawaii so the poke wasn't all that great but that isn't the restaurant's fault.

- Two large scoops of rice
- Macaroni Salad
- Lau Lau ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lau_lau )

- Lau Lau ( Only after 3pm )  or Kalua Pork 
- Ahi Poke in Shoyu
- Haupia
- Lomi-lomi salmon

My coworker recommended it as a way to be aquainted with the tastes of hawaii. 

Let me tell you the food was AMAZING.  The pork was tender , flavorful and definitly a repeat. I quite enjoyed the ahi poke , mac salad.  Im not a huge fan of salmon , so i ate very little of the lomi-lomi salmon.  

I detest coconut , but the Haupia was amazing as an end to a terrific meal.

If you have a craving for local food this is the go to place in Las Vegas. Its a sit down restaurant but they also have counter service. The place is clean, everyone is always friendly. and the food is ONO!

Not many Hawaiian restaurants in the mainland make me feel like i'm back at home but Island Flavors does exactly that every single time. I've tried a lot of their menu but my favorites are:

1. Love their Oxtail stew- Its ONO period.
2. Any of their Loco Moco's- hard to finish off its a mountain.
3. They got good poke...best on Fri/Sat when fish comes in
4. Pocho Bean soup...very good, almost like my Aunty's-almost
5. Roast Pork...melt in your mouth! 
6. and of course their hand wrapped Laulau's- I think its served only on Aloha Friday. Its a good thing they only serve it on Fri or I would have to buy new pants.
7. Their mixed plate is like the Zip pac on steroids! So much food...and much better.

This place is a winner in my book. They would put a lot of local restaurants in Hawaii to shame. What are you waiting for? Stop Yelping for a minute and drive your okole to Island Flavors. And don't forget to bring your appetite because they pile it on. Trust me, you'll be taking food home unless you are sharing your plate with 2 other people.

I cannot even begin to explain how good everything is that I have had here.

Even the regular chopped salad is amazing with that dressing, those freshly fried wonton chips, the slice of TARO! Yes, fresh taro. Ughhhh, I have been back  multiple times and they are on point EVERY time.

I have had the hoisin baby back ribs (TWO RACKS OF RIBS, SO TENDER THEY FALL OFF THE BONE!), sweet & sour spare ribs (JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TANGY-NESS AND SWEETNESS), the Korean Chicken (DRUMETTES WITH A LIGHT SAUCE), the Furikake Shrimp (DEEP FRIED AND SIMPLE)... and my boyfriend is extremely fond of the Hawaiian Style Roast Pork.

There were three pieces of kalbi ribs and a decent pile of roast pork with gravy, two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. But one piece of the kalbi ribs was all fat, with very little beef on it.  I was not too impressed with this plate, as the whole plate was lacking in flavour.  The kalbi ribs could have been marinated longer, the roast pork was not that tasty and there wasn't enough gravy for the two scoops of rice.

Walked in, and as always, was greeted by a friendly worker and seated right away.  Service was friendly and quick.  Ordered our food and it was out within 10 minutes.  Food came out hot and fresh.

I had the Loco Moco.  Perfectly cooked rice.  Thick Beef patty was juicy and nicely seasoned.  I ordered over easy eggs but came out hard, no biggie...  And the gravy, Can't get enough of that stuff.....  I wish they offered the B.I.G. Loco Moco.  Choice of 3 different meats!

Wife got the Saimin.  Standard Saimin with the usual toppings.  Char-sui, kamaboko, eggs, green onions, etc....  The broth was a bit under seasoned.  Nothing a little shoyu couldn't fix.   The dumplings were good though....

Daughter got the furikake chicken.  She usually pounds her food but she barely touched it.  I finally tried a piece and it was hard and dry.  It's as if it was cooked, sat out, then refried to heat it up.  The sauce was good.

Son had the Korean Wings.  This is his go to plate.  He always orders it and it's always BOMB!!!!  Big freshly cooked chicken wings and dipped in a nice shoyu/sesame sauce.  Perfect every time.....",tLjLBYTklcYSoWWdxroMVg,3,0,4,QaBJmYUPZm15TRbK_zAN6A

The Guava Cake is extraordinary.  I know they get it from next door, but it's Island Flavor's recipe.  The guava is infused in the cake batter and you can taste a hint of it with every bite.  Not too over powering.

perusing the specials, I come across something that is only found on Maui(up until now) Guri Guri(pronounced goodie goodie) which is basically sherbet. I asked Aunty if its made, or if they got it from Maui, and she says ""Nice try bruddah, I not gonna tell you!"" LOL!!!!..they offer Strawberry and Blue Vanilla and for $4 it comes in a half-pound size poke container...That's dessert, but back to the food....

We got The Fried Rice Omelette and Furikake Shrimp and they were Onolicious as usual. Can't go wrong with any of the food here, just come with an appetite because one entree could seriously feed two people.

Still wanting dessert, we were gonna get the Haupia Cake but it wasn't on the menu.
what they did have was a Haupia Ice Cream Pie, so we tried that and also got a Strawberry Guri Guri. The Pie was okay, but not as good as a cake and the Guri Guri was good, but slightly harder from being prepacked.

Came here and got their misoyaki opakapaka & my mom got their oxtail.
I got the opakapaka bcuz I've gotten hounded by friends to try it; and I loved it but, was not expecting how big the filets of fish were going to be. Granted, I'm an idiot for even trying to complain about the size so I won't complain....it's just a shocker! I swear the fish filets were bigger than my fork. lol

Mom loved the oxtail. She said it made her heart warm. AWWW! lol
She said it's better than the oxtail from The California Hotel because the oxtail was all meat as opposed to The Cal's fatty oxtail. I liked how they had bok choy in their soup. Not something I've seen in other oxtails. Def adds to the specialty side of Island Flavors soup.

The workers all loved my mom and kept asking her if she liked the soup. lol Idk what it is about my mom; whenever we go to these fam local style spots, they always wanna make sure my mom is good. Which is great....adds to the family style establishment they got going here =)

The Hawaiian moral code to eat plentiful, and well is sure to meet those standards here. I did decided to get the chicken teriyaki salad. One word. AMAZING! The portion was huge!!! It had these huge slices of purple yams which were fresh, sweet, and oh so delicious. The sesame dressing? To die for! And it makes a great combination with the greens on the salad and the chicken teriyaki on it. 

The service was great, and our waitress was very friendly. Our waitress did slide a few witty jokes here and there. She also enganged in starting small talk which I think was very nice and hospitable of her. The place is small, but I feel that the envorniment and homely atmosphere makes it appropriate for the place to be small, and decorated with very small and simple paintings and decoration.

When I got it, it was really big like twice the size of Fukuburgers, but to be honest it was good but not as good as Fukuburgers. It didn't have that special ingredient or something. What can I say, I'm spoiled by fabulous flavors so maybe I'm just being picky.

The biggest con of Island Flavor is perhaps it's greatest pro -- it's the best Hawaiian place for miles. Thus,it is always full of patrons,with a pretty hefty wait time during peak hours. 

Price is in line with most Hawaiian joints -- if not a little pricier -- But they more than make up for it with the amount of food you get. 

Always feels like it's a little understaffed when you dine in,so I would recommend either calling to order out (or using the Yelp! App to place an order to go) or getting a delivery (they are on GrubHub and Postmates!).

3783603,2014-02-15,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I now only come here for the sole purpose of their ahi poke, furikake style. I freaking love that stuff. 

I'm basing this review off of my recent visit a few days ago:

When we walk in, we are immediately seated. Get our drink orders, take a few minutes to decide and all that jazz. Finally we go with an order of ahi poke for me, oxtail soup, a mixed plate of chopped steak and onions and chicken katsu, and a bowl of saimin (can't remember the name). 

Ahi poke - 5/5 like always. Huge chunks of fresh fish. I can never finish the last few pieces of the regular order but I'm still hungry when I do the half order. That furikake style is the way to go though. I'm never going to order anything else!

Oxtail soup - 0/5 which was very disappointing since it was $11 of pure saltiness. At first I was in denial and blamed it on the ginger in the soup but as I continued to sip on it I couldn't even eat it anymore. SO SALTY! The meat wasn't very tender. Very disappointed with this one. 

Chopped steak and onions & chicken katsu - 3/5 because the chicken katsu was incredibly bland. There was really no flavor at all and not even the katsu sauce could save it. They should have transferred some of the salt from that oxtail soup to that chicken. And usually I can never go wrong ANYWHERE with chicken katsu but wow I was disappointed since this place is a bit more pricier than Ohana Hawaiian BBQ. The chopped steak and onions was good though. Very greasy but it was good. Those onions even taste better than the katsu. 

Saimin - 3/5. It was just OK nothing too special. At least this wasn't salty like the oxtail so that was a plus I guess. I dunno maybe I'll give this another try one day. 

Service - 3/5. Does anyone ever smile here anymore!? I used to love the servers here because they were very friendly and welcoming but geez can you all at least pretend like you're in a good mood? It's a huge turn off when I can tell that workers hate their job. At least pretend like you want to be there! Our server especially was giving off a rude vibe. For the oxtail we asked for extra bowls so we can all share (there was 4 of us) and he only comes out with one. When we asked him again for more bowls he was like ""more bowls? Okayyyy but there's one right there."" Fool I'm not blind, I know how to count. Don't try to pull it off like were stupid or something. We obviously are asking for more so we can share and we told you twice. That set me off a little.. but I wasn't going to make his day worse so I let it go. 

I was really disappointed during this visit because I usually love coming here. Aside from the excellent poke, the food and service was just ehhh. Well I guess as long as I keep coming here for the poke, I won't be disappointed! :)",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,1,0,3,mkY2ZiUmilky8XWEPVjcog

The Chicken Katsu Loco Moco is amazing. No other Hawaiian restaurant offers Loco Moco with Chicken, always traditional with the burger patty. The gravy is what sets Island Flavor's Loco Moco apart from everyone else's.. Grandma's secret recipe is the best! I suggest asking for the gravy on the side because they give you a lot where you can take the rest home and make a whole new breakfast with it!

The Furikake Ahi Poke was very fresh and well seasoned. It comes in a half or full order but the half was a pretty good amount as an appetizer for two.
The Korean Chicken wings were very flavorful and crispy.. would be even better with a pint of beer. ;)

I'm sure they have many other delicious items on the menu but why bother with something new when it's pretty much guaranteed that you're going to enjoy the furikake chicken? I can attest that it is on par to some of the best plate lunches/chicken dishes that I've had back at home in Hawaii. Now, that's kind of BIG deal considering when it comes to Hawaiian/local food here in Vegas, I'm kind of a snob comparing it to real thing. 

Enough said and I think I've already said furikake chicken 10 times in this review already. Go out and get yourself some! The parking is no problem here. And the staff are pretty friendly from what I've experienced. They also have a smaller 'Express' location off Eastern/215 if you're in that neck of the woods.",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,10,11,5,6EspL-WIywbvxP4Pf2v54g

I had myself a combo of Hawaiian roasted pork w/ gravy and chicken katsu.  The pork had just the right amount of salt and pepper and although the gravy was an added touch, I could probably just eat the pork by itself.  Oh wait, no, with rice.  Gotta have the rice.  The chicken katsu was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Sampled the poke' and it was fairly good.  I say ""fair"" because I've tasted better homemade poke'.  I'm not really a fan of macaroni salad, but their macaroni salad is a level up from L&L's.  

That day I ""broke da mouth"" but I probably also broke some skin and gained another stretchmark.

3860254,2017-03-09,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"No joke, some of the best food I have ever had in my entire life! Here's what I tried:

-spicy avocado poke: incredibly fresh! It's not spicy at all but it is very flavorful. I preferred this one over the furikake poke (they have 3 kinds of poke)
-furikake poke: also incredibly fresh with much more complex flavors than the spicy avocado poke. This is 100% preference of tastes as one poke is not better than the other...it's just very different flavors. The furikake poke has more of a kick and spice to it but not spice as in hotness...more kind of like how pepper adds a certain heavy spice. I just prefer to taste the raw tuna and the furikake's seasonings are stronger than the spicy avocado tuna. Again, both delicious just your preference. 
-fried rice: I only got this as a side but man are they generous! It comes as a pretty big pile and they even add pork and chicken in it which I didn't expect. I thought it would just be like Panda Express fried rice, lol. I love fried rice over steamed. Very good pick!
-furikake chicken: one of the best things I have ever had in my entire life. Please skip all other chicken dishes and just do this one. The flavor and crispness is just...OMG unexplainable, lol. Don't read about it...just go eat it, lol. Words don't do it justice! It comes with a big pile of steamed rice and macaroni salad, like typical Hawaiian dishes.

Portions are very big, prices are fair, place is clean but very busy so come outside if their lunch and dinner rushes if you hate that. If not, just prepare for a mild wait. 

The only tip I have for management if they read this review
 is maybe to direct traffic a little better. There is a sign that says to wait to be seated so people come in and we all end up piling on top of each other by the front door blocking it to other customers coming in and out. After ten minutes of standing, we were all asked if we signed in. We didn't know we had to so about 3 families including us all went to the front desk to sign in. I'm fine with waiting but it is very disorganized. Maybe having a waiting area not right in front of the door and having the sign say to please sign in will avoid the messy traffic jam.

But, you will love this place. I cannot wait to go back!",TXZRWst2LMfaKRGF4DAxDA,1,0,5,05srwE7Kp-5_JT6KZZdDgg

I was so excited to bring my cousin that was born & raised in Hawaii and so sure she was going to LOVE and appreciate it especially because it wasn't on the main land what she ordered was really bad. The chicken katsu loco moko. The gravy was lumpy and thick it didn't look like gravy. It looked more like mashed potatoes. really tho!!! The chicken has no taste at all. I felt so bad because I raved, and raved about this place and the ONE TIME I take a family member there it was BAD. Really upset. I was so embarrassed.

3868117,2013-02-09,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I don't give 5 stars to many restaurants simply because everything must be perfect for a 5 star rating.  This place is very very close to 5 stars cause their food is so delicious. 
I live exactly 2 miles from Flava but have never been there.  I've driven past it a million times and judging from the outside it certainly doesn't look like anything special. It even could resemble a cheap take out place from the outside but it's certainly not.  Never judge a book by it's cover.  
Anyway, I had visitors from NYC coming to Vegas.  For some reason they chose to go this place which they said they go to every year when they come here.  When they invited me to go I was simply happy that I didn't have to go the strip to meet them. 

Well, the menu is very large and varied. The staff was excellent towards us, constantly refilling our drinks and all that good stuff. 
Since we had 7 people I was able to taste many different dishes. The raw tuna is excellent and you get a pound of it cut up into perfectly bite size pieces.  
The burgers, steak and onions, wings, pork were all excellent. 
I ordered the Snapper and I got 3 large pieces of fish of which I could only eat one.
So, for 14 bucks I had dinner and brought 2 big pieces of fish home with me which was another complete meal for me. 
I then finished up with the Mud Pie and as others have said it's not really a mud pie but still very very good and huge. I took half of that home as well. 
Now that I know of this place and it's so darn close to my house, I may become an addict.  Especially with the takeout and they do have a delivery service that will deliver for them but I forgot the name of the service but you can just ask them and they will tell you. 
It's very well lit up. Maybe a bit too bright but the minute your food arrives you forget about everything else and simply dig in. 
I'm so happy my friends found it or I may have never walked in to the place. 
Plenty of parking as well.
If you live in the S.West this is a must go restaurant.

The expectations of this place really lives up to the hype with everyone on yelp and word of mouth. Service was pretty standard the day we visited and there was a good sized crowd eating lunch. My mom and I brought the little girl we babysit throughout the week and we ordered fried poke stack, mahi mahi salad, and grilled chicken. 

Fried Poke Stack- this had a really good flavor. I'm guessing it was cooked with sesame oil and soy sauce. The portion was plenty enough to share which is why my parents were able to taste it. My parents enjoyed this as well because they believed it had a very homemade like-taste to it. 

Mahi Mahi Salad- really delicious dressing is all I can say. The only thing I would ask for is it would have been better if they used cherry tomatoes instead of slicing a tomato into quarters. But loved the dressing once again. 

Grill chicken- didn't get to try this because we ordered it for the little girl. But it came with three fillets. 

Banana bread- I was really excited to try this because Ursula U. had raved about it in her review. It was pretty good, but not the best that I've tried or anything I would crave for. It could be because it's made with Cinnamon, which is something I'm not a big fan of. 

TIP: everything is ENOUGH TO SHARE. Even if I'm a big eater, the portions here are huge!

Portion was exceptional.  A generous serving of Kimchi Fried Rice enough, for lunch and dinner.  You'll enjoy the sour kick from the kimchi, slices of chashu pork, onion, and soy sauce if it was not destroyed by over salting; which, was unfortunately disappointing.

Furthermore, the Korean chicken was sweet, and crispy, but like its Kimchi Fried Rice partner it's just too salty.  Unsure if the chef  was having an off day, but I expected to be blown anyway from the reviews.  Fortunately, the Macaroni salad was delicious.  It was creamy, yet light, and deliciously worth ordering on its own.

ONE star for the delicious food. OMG!!!! I ordered the kalbi ribs and it was sooooooo freakin good. The meat was well flavored and juicy. The fried rice with Portuguese sausage is a hit as well. I totally recommend these two dishes.   

ONE star for the deserts. The coco puffs are my favorite. I mean it's not like the in Hawaii BUT it's pretty close to it. I can't leave here and not enjoy deserts. Their guava & Chantilly cake is delicious as well.

FOR THE WIN!!!

In my previous review, I shared that we had an all day that was busy at the Adventuredome then watching the Fountains at the Bellagio. By the time that we reached our vacation rental it was past 8:00 and I asked everyone what did they want to eat for dinner?

Everyone replied, ""Anything with rice""

So, of course, I opened up my trusty Yelp app and typed in local food.

Well, waddaya know...there was a local food restaurant, ""Island Flavor"" RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.

If I wanted to weep with joy because I didn't have to drive very far!

I wanted to weep further because their menu made our stomachs growl happily.

I called up the restaurant to place a takeout order. I shared with her that all the plates were all rice instead of salad. She was really friendly and then asked if we ate brown rice too? I though they ran out of white rice and it didn't bother us to where I shared her that we did. But, she said, ""No, I'm going to give you that in a container on the side too."" 

After placing the order, she shared that they close at 10 and if I got there before then and the door was locked, I could just knock on the window and they'll open up for me. 

If you live near Durango, this place is very easy to find. 

Sure enough the door was locked but they let us in. After we paid for our food and was loading it up in the car, she came out and told us to wait because they were also including haupia with our plates. YES!!! I didn't win no jackpot but we got some good eats from Island Flavor!!!

When we brought the food in the kitchen, everyone just wanted to swoon not only because there was rice but the portions were HUGE.

Loco Moco: The hamburger and eggs practically filled the entire plate oozing with gravy.

Kalua Pig and Cabbage: This plate was HEAVY because it was loaded with kalua pig and cabbage.

Kalbi Short Ribs: Oh my heavens...if you were ordering this plate in Hawaii, you would have three regular size pieces that were cut on the thin side. But, Island Flavor didn't give me three...they gave me FIVE THICK PIECES.

Along with these plates, they included shoyu and whatever brings warm fuzzies to a local person who loves local island food. 

Breakdown of Island Flavor:

Food: The menu is extensive. Poke maybe on the pricey side BUT since this is the desert, you have to expect it. Overall, the menu caters to everyone who is visiting or moved to Vegas from the 808 state. I thought it would be like L&L or Loco Moco but nope, their flavors are more of the homecooked style that makes you miss your family back at home in Hawaii.

Customer Service: FILLED WITH ALOHA

Prices: Reasonable especially because the portions are HUGE

Location: Easy to find

Restaurant / Ambiance: Just right, clean and family friendly

Recommendation: FIVE STARS...it is a must go-to for anyone who never tried but wants to try local food from Hawaii, 808 visitors or 808 people who moved to Vegas and just misses the food from the islands.",hxCAVwUajMMdg3sPF5wjsg,14,13,5,HRnQv4nedcuE6qtjPDVBeQ

When we come and sit at the restaurant to eat sometimes the service can be a little off but that's when they suddenly get busy and there's only a couple people on the floor. Musubi's are bomb, I know it's easy to make but seriously the best in town. They're double the size of the other places and just fresher and tastes better. I guess the only thing I don't care for is the roast pork, many rave about it but personally I don't care for it, it's like flavorless unless u add all that gravy, I'd rather eat kalua pork instead. Beef stew is awesome, just like grandmas and any of the chicken dishes are good too. Don't forget to order dessert ! Cakes like theirs are hard to find here in Vegas.

3972410,2015-08-02,9,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"This was my first foray into eating Hawaiian food other than just trying some of these items from a buffet.  Three of us came here to share plates and try a number of different things.  Items ordered:

1/2 portion poke furikake style
Chicken katsu and kalua pig mixed plate
Kalbi short ribs and shrimp mixed plate
Roast pork loco moco
1 musubi 
Banana bread pudding
Chantilly cake
Guava cake
Haupia cake
Kona coffee mudd pie

There were three standouts in the savory items ordered--kalua pig, kalbi short ribs, and roast pork loco moco.  I've been a fan of kalua pig and this did not disappoint.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were grilled perfectly with the meat being very juicy.  I thought the marinade was a little sweet and I didn't care for the flavor of the small container of sauce we got in a small container.  The loco moco was good as far as the pork was concerned and the gravy was good.  There was just so much rice that everything else got lost in the rice.

The two combination plates we got both came with two large scoops of rice and one large scoop of macaroni salad.  There was just an overwhelming amount of rice.  The macaroni salad was quite good.

I enjoy poke but this was different than other poke I've had.  The tuna was crunchy in texture and not soft like other times I've gotten poke.  I don't know which is the way it's supposed to be.  The furikake flavors were good.  I'd skip the musubi.  A whole lot of rice with only a small piece of spam inside.  

For the sweet items, we got smiles from the server when we started ordering.  At one point he said, ""You do know we have large portions?""  With a laugh, our order continued until we had four slices of cake and a banana bread pudding.  Standouts here were the banana bread pudding and the guava cake.  My favorite was the guava cake.  The Haupia was nothing special and the chantilly was a bit disappointing.  Understand that I would not turn down any of these if offered to me, but I wouldn't order those.  I found the Kona coffee mud pie disappointing.  Stick with the guava.

Now I know why my friend, Candace C, says in her review that ...""this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-­elastic-band-before-­coming kind of food.""  Service was OK.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,12,3,4MJD9LqqtGVJDLrT37GrSw

I had the loco moco, the gravy is not your stereotypical brown gravy, this was a tan gravy that was very bland. Our friends say it wasn't that bad last time, but uh, not good. However, the hamburger patty was good and homemade. One of the kids we were with said he liked the loco moco from Aloha Kitchen better.
The furikake chicken was ok, looks really good but the taste didn't match the look. It was on the sweet side.

The chicken was well cooked, not dry, but the homemade teriyaki sauce was really salty. The rice helped, but only so much. The macaroni salad was a little bland, but there was a peppery finish. The white rice, was white rice, not too much you can say about it except it wasn't Uncle Ben's. I do wish there was more of it to help with the teriyaki sauce and I wish there was an option for brown rice.

The waitress was very attentive and made sure my ice tea never stayed empty for too long. The only other drawback other than the salty teriyaki sauce is the location. I wish they had a location closer to where I live!",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,0,0,3,WVf-IBV0lA-LJIzZ78nPgA

The menu was filled with so many familiar options it was hard to choose. My husband ordered Kalbi and my cousin, her husband and I ordered a mixed plate with furikaki fried shrimp and hawaiian style roast pork. Both came with rice (I had brown) and Mac salad. We also ordered fresh made Ahi Poke, mix of shoyu, sesame, and furikake style.  Everything was sooooooo delicious!!!

SERVICE
Fast, attentive, helpful and friendly. Awesomeness.

FOOD
I ordered Loco Moco: 10oz homemade hamburger patty on steamed rice topped with two eggs any style and brown gravy. Choice of original, roast pork or chicken katsu. Patty was good but my gravy felt like it had too much butter in it. 

I do want to point out that their serving size is HUGE. It seemed that all the other table asked for a box to take the left overs home. When my server handed me the order, I immediately started to wonder if I accidentally ordered triple mega extra large or they mistakenly thought I was participating in some kind of eating contest. Honestly, the dish that loco moco came in look like a bathroom sink. I could dive in and swim in this. What even.

No complaints because left over means you get to enjoy more. Plus the price is really cheap considering the amount they give you.

Island Flavor is as good as it gets. Easily my top favorite Hawaiian restaurant!",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,7,7,5,tmU3lvY5Ffj4WceSI-6lmg

We've been here twice now and I have to tell you that the Furikake chicken is at the top of my recommendation list. I've never had it before, but will have it many times again. I suggest trying something besides the teriyaki chicken or beef, only because you can get that anywhere. We tried Guava cake for dessert, thinking it might be too exotic for us but we were feeling adventurous (and they were out of everything else).

4014541,2009-09-30,5,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"We try to keep the review short today!  This place is ""Brok' da mout!""  Forget L&L or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ...you want the closest to genuine Hawaiian food?  You gotta come to Island Flavor!  Even the owners from Hawaii!  Big Island to be exact.

This place is phenomenal for local island food, the portions are local too...HUGE!  We had enough leftovers for another meal that's how much food you get.  Island Flavor is actually only 4-5 miles away from my house but we never came around to eating there.  Finally tried it because of my coupon from Restaurant.com.  Be sure if you go you are hungry cause these folks don't skimp!  You walk out hungry, you definitely went to the wrong place.  Four of us went, and four of us walked out stuffed with a doggie bag in tow.  If you don't like white rice (what kine' Hawaii local are you?) then don't come here you crazy carb-conscious workoutaholics!

Hawaiian food is usually a mix of cultures, Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino all combined.  Island Flavor's food made me fond of days spent home on Maui.  I had the Mixed Plate ($9.75) of  Teriyaki Steak and Teriyaki Chicken.  Their homemade teriyaki sauce was just right, not too sweet and not too runny.  Perfect for mixing with your rice and macaroni salad.  Macaroni salad with pepper and tabasco...yum!  The steak was tender even though it wasn't a very expensive cut (sirloin) and cooked great with a lil' pink inside.  Chicken thighs were big and moist.  The gf had the Mixed Plate ($9.75) of Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian Style Roast Pork.  There must have been 3 large rows of katsu, enough to share!  They were fried just right too, not heavy or soggy at all.  The roast pork was juicy and the brown gravy wasn't from a box, very succulent.  The kids shared a Mixed Plate ($9.75) of Korean Chicken and Kalbi Ribs, and Chicken Katsu Loco Moco ($8.75).  The Korean Chicken is so ONO!  Those golden fried wings with their special Korean sauce was addictive!  Very good!  The Kalbi was great as well, their marinade pretty close to what I remember as a kid, lots of sweet from the sugar and soy sauce and grilled on an open flame.  The Chicken Katsu Loco Moco was a big gut-buster.  A massive portion of rice (like 4 scoops) topped with chicken katsu, two eggs (sunny side up in this case...alright!) and their homemade brown gravy.  It's like heaven and hell on a plate at the same time!  Definitely not a calorie or cholesterol counter.  But oh so yummy!  

They serve lots of other things local Hawaii people love, Kalua Pig & Cabbage, Poke, Spam Musubi, and Pork Won Tons.  They also have oxtail soup, saimin, and burgers.

Needless to say, we did not finish all of our food and ended up taking half of each of our dishes home.  The leftovers were good reheated too the next day.  Just don't heat up your macaroni salad!  No good on that one.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,10,5,5,4Mf4NewIwr1I4grMYK5F4w

Then there's a heaping portion of chicken Katsu, the light brown gravy, and the egg on top.

I like the option of having the egg cooked how you like, although I'm sure a true hawaain may correct me on the style the egg should be cooked.

First, their food is excellent. My boyfriend said it's even better than local food in Hawaii. We've had a variety of different things so far. My boyfriend has tried almost everything that can be chosen for the mixed plate and he has liked all of them. He always upgrades to the fried rice, and I always steal some of his because it's so good. I've had the lau lau (special days only), which was excellent. I like the standard Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, and their sausage is really good. The only thing I haven't been super impressed with is their saimin. It was ok, but nothing super spectacular. Last night, they had friend saimin on special, and it was the best fried saimin I've ever had. Their poke is also good. I like the furikake style. 

Second, their portions are HUGE. I mean, we have a friend who can eat A LOT of food, and even he had to take half his mixed plate home. We always have more than two meals when we order their mixed plates. Seriously, it's like a pot of rice when you upgrade to the fried rice.  

Third, the people here are always super nice. Coming here really does feel like being back home at a local restaurant. Very local feel, and they always have some local jams on. They also had live music there once when we were there. 

Fourth, their prices are so, so affordable. For the quality AND quantity, they are ridiculously cheap. Yesterday, we got out for about $50...for 4 meals, 4 spam musubi, and 2 drinks.

They seriously should have an eating contest with these wonderful bowls full of NOM NOMness because id like to see the person who could kill one of these they are so damn big. The place is sort of like a hole in the wall but im not complaining as its close to home which is nice. The decor is sort of like what you would expect of the floor plan of a sushi restaurant with the center wrap around bar section where you expect to see a sushi chef behind serving it up. But its relatively clean and its not like i wanted to dress up to go eat island food. 
The good part, the grub! my brother said the Katsu loco moco was where its at so i ordered and maybe not even 10 minutes later the cook in the back who kinda reminded me of tattoo face from ""50 First Dates"" had my tasty bowl mounded with a heap of food. This bowl had to have at least 4 scoops of rice in the bottom, 3-4 full chicken breasts breaded and well cooked, 2 eggs, and covered in brown gravy and a sprinkle of green onions. Honestly i was overwhelmed by the amount of food as when i saw the $8 and change price tag i thought it was a lil bit much for what i ordered, till i learned that it could feed me for 3 meals. Well made with all the right flavors, my only issue ever so slight was that the eggs were sliiightly under cooked so the whites were still jelly like. Aside from this i was pleased with the food. 

Location/ decor - 6/10 would get a 5 but its close so thats a point 4 me
Service - 7/10 nice people, nothing special but not bad either
Food taste - 7.5-8/10 simple food, simple flavors but well put together
Value - 9.5/10 big food for very good price, one order can feed two

I did try the oxtail soup which was full of tender oxtail, and vegetables. The broth was a little too salty for my taste buds but i enjoyed the large, tender oxtail pieces and how they just fell apart when I touched 'em with my spoon.

I order the boiled sweet potato and the katsu chicken. Both dishes came out in a fairly decent time frame and were presented in a local style cafe. I will say This business isn't about how it's presented, it's about the food and it was all cooked to perfection.

Recommending here will be no problem for sure!! They are great with kids, so a family setting is assured!

The meal isn't too big, but there were definitely many items that caught my eye. I ended up ordering the furikake chicken meal while the boyfriend got the combo of furikake chicken and hawaiian roast pork. Each entree came with two big scoops of rice and macaroni salad. I'm not a fan of macaroni salad, but the boyfriend definitely enjoyed his. The furikake chicken was definitely unlike anything I've ever tasted before. It had the sweetness of orange chicken with the flavoring of furikake seasoning. Both worked really well together and even after I was full, I could not stop picking at it. My only complaint would just be that some pieces were a bit too hard, which ended up scratching the whole roof of my mouth as I tried to eat them. But that's a small price to pay for delicious island flavor!

At the end, the portions were just so gigantic that I ended up having leftovers that made up another meal for dinner, which only made my day better.

Anyways service was friendly and the portion sizes are extremely generous here!
 
We ordered:
-1/2 pound of Spicy Avocado Poke ($7.25) - tuna tasted fresh, the sauce they put on top had a nice kick to it, served with raw onions and wontons, the wontons underneath soaked up the shoyu sauce and was a little on the salty side, otherwise super good
-Lau Lau Special ($11) - steamed pork served in taro leaf with 2 sides, we picked side of white rice, mac salad and it came with some type of coconut jello dessert, mac salad was solid, the pork itself was pretty good could be seasoned a little bit more though
-Chicken Katsu ($9) - deep fried to perfection, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, came with side of mac salad and rice
-Mixed Plate with Roast Pork and Kalbi Ribs ($11.25) - kalbi ribs cost $1 extra I believe, had the mixed salad with a tasty dressing as one side, added on fried rice for extra $2 as other side, both the roast pork and kalbi ribs were so flavorful!
-Spam Musubi ($2) - they forgot to bring this out to us so we had to ask another worker to bring it, generous helping of rice inside, the seaweed didn't even wrap all the way around the musubi, regardless it was delicious

If you didn't know, there's a small population of Japanese-Americans that enjoy visiting Vegas and staying at the Cal Club.  An authentic Hawaiian restaurant seems out of the ordinary for a city like Vegas, but it makes sense considering this ethnic group that enjoys hanging out in Vegas.  It's a pretty small restaurant, so it gets pretty busy with the long wait times.  As soon as you walk in, you get a very authentic feel of Hawaii, with the smell of delicious legit Hawaiian food and friendly service from Hawaiian locals.

The menu is filled with all the best Hawaiian food you can think of.. and the best part about it is that the portions are definitely worth your buck.  My dad got the poke avocado dish, my mom the furikake chicken, and me the chicken katsu loco mono with a fried rice substitute.  My dad said that the poke with the house special sauce was one of the best poke dishes he has ever had.  I'm not a fan of poke so I never tried it, but it was like a salad assorted with poke and avocado and a light soy sauce looking sauce.  My mom's furikake chicken dish seems to be a restaurant favorite (according to Yelp).  The chicken is sweet and tastes like candy, with a crunch and furikake sprinkled on the outside.  It's similar to a mochiko chicken, but with a twist.

I get the loco moco every time I go, but they allow a mix of adding chicken katsu and substituting the rice with their fried rice.  This dish is HUGE, so I highly suggest sharing with 2-3 people.  The chicken katsu is perfectly crispy and the fried rice is filled with all the good stuff (including chashu).  The gravy is the real winner here that tops off the dish and makes it taste amazing!

Island Flavor has a very homey feel that makes it enjoyable to share good homemade food with friends.  One time when I visited for dinner time, they had a live band playing Hawaiian music.  I highly recommend this place when visiting Vegas!",ESF-d6-9wYCjKInxsJpy1w,0,0,4,cHaAgWabQ-FY04iZHquaUw

It's a hunger like no other. Luckily, over at Island Flavor, they give some of the largest portions that I have ever seen. It's like Hash House A Go Go-portions for Hawaiian Cuisine, except the food here is actually good.

The place was a bit on the empty side around 11am on a late Saturday morning. Seeing an empty place on a weekend always leaves me a bit hesitant to eat somewhere. But, I had a gut instinct telling me to eat here anyway. I'm glad I did. Here's what we went with:

Fried Rice Omelet - When this dish is served to you, it looks like a majestic mountain pile, capped at the peak with a generous amount of scrambled egg. Along with it, comes three giant pieces of Portuguese sausage, nestled around the edges of the plate. The fried rice, packed underneath, has to be some of the best fried rice that I've ever had in this town. It had a bit of a unique sweet flavor to it, mixed in with some small bits of diced pork. I'm pretty sure this serving was good enough to feed 3-4 people. I stared at this modern marvel for a few seconds before I dug in. It was beautiful sight.

Loco Moco - Another heavily portioned dish with a likewise amount of brown gravy, to boot. I sampled a bit of it. Not bad! the hamburger patty included with it was humongous, as expected. Loco Moco is much too heavy a dish for me to conquer on my own. I'd probably come back for this if I wanted to drown a day of depression in gravy.

4264745,2015-01-04,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,Ono! It was so nice to visit Vegas and have some delicious island food. You just can't get that where I live and miss it. Place is casual and has the local vibe. The mixed plate is awesome because there is so much to choose from.

We Ordered:
1. Poke (Shoyu)
2. Saimin Soup
3. Loco Moco
4. Kona Coffee Mud Pie

Poke is very flavorful and it being an appetizer, we were expecting it to be very small, which it was not. It was enough for me and the guy I married to share.

Saimin Soup, man, there was a lot of flavor that I was not expecting! First off it was a large bowl, and there was so much in the soup by my standards. Wontons, the pink & white fish patty thingies (I don't like 'em but they're always in Saimin), and the noodles. The broth was so tasty! I was expecting it to be bland, considering the broth was very clear, but it was so flavorful, yummy!!! 

Loco Moco, gees, this thing is huge and yummy! Enough said.

Kona Coffee Mud Pie, OMG... I love coffee ice cream and this is so MUCH better! Topped with whipped cream, macadamia nuts. 

The service is also a thumbs up! They're all so welcoming, very attentive and always really sweet when we come in.

Furikake chicken. Furikake chicken. Think of wet, sticky, juicy fried chicken with some furikake flavor. Favorite thing on the menu. 
The chicken Katsu is better than some of the other places I've been to in the city, but the meat to fried portion is still lacking.

We shared 4 dishes between 5 people and had leftovers. All for under 50 bucks! 

Chicken Katsu ($9): Crispy chicken katsu served with katsu sauce (blend of soy sauce, tomato paste, applesauce, onions, carrots). 

Furikake Chicken ($9): Favorite! Bite sized pieces of chicken deep fried and coated in furikake sauce. Can you ask for anything more, seriously? Must try! 

Kalbi Short Ribs ($11): About 4 pieces of short ribs on the plate! Marinade was on point and the short rib was nice and juicy. 

Saimin ($8.75): Noodle soup dish served with scrambled egg slices, fish cake, wontons, and char sui. Interesting, but not my cup of tea.

i went their for lunch since i'm from hawaii I'm always looking for a good place where they have hawaiian food.  

I have to say this place does not live up to the hype of my friends and everyone I asked about this place.  i ordered the mix plate where you can choose 2 main item from a list so I picked teri chicken and roast pork  which is a basic item for hawaiian restaurants.  First their menu is very limited, they didn't even have spam musubi.. anyways.  when they food came out it looked good. Nice big portions just like my firend said.  but when i started eating  the gravy was turkey gravy and not pork gravy.  the mac salad was too sweet in my opinion.  although the chicken was cooked perfectly, there was too much sauce on it and ruined the chicken..  the rice was over cooked and mushy.  i didn't want to anymore of that so I ordered the saimin.  which is another staple of hawaiian food.  when it came out it looked very nice.  it had wontons, fish cakes, bok choy, teri beef, scrambled egg.  but again when i tasted it i was very disappointed.  the soup was a instant soup bases.  the noodle was s&s saimin.  i asked for chinese hot mustard so I can dip the wontons in it.  what came out was wasabi and shoyu already mixed together.  right then and there i lost my appetite.  the saimin is not worth the $8.75  you can't have mustard with your saimin.  Oh!! they don't even have Aloha Shoyu..  I would really like to see this restaurant do good but they have to change their flavors and stop advertising like they have hawaiian pride when the flavor of the food clearly states otherwise....",m-2KR6qlnAwsPiK9l2C6kw,1,0,2,CdW7gr4KWdouFEatnBij-Q

I knew this was going to be good when the side salad rocked.  The freshest romaine lettuce I have ever seen in Vegas with fresh tomatoes, cucumber and a slice of bean cake.  A creamy sesame dressing with crispy wonton chips made a starter for what's to come.  The mac salad was very good.  The kalbi was tender on the outter region and nice and flavorful chewy near the bone.  You get 9 bones in this order.  The bbq is really good and has a slight char for more flavor.  The slow cooked pork was tender on the inside and chewy on the outside where the heat dries out the meat into a nice chewy texture. Not quite a chicharone texture, but almost.

It also had vegetables to actually eat and not just as garnish. The order came with two whopping scoops of rice and macaroni salad. I honestly couldn't finish it all. For dessert the waitress recommended their new guava cake. At first I was a little apprehensive, but I finally gave in. Thank goodness I agreed on ordering the guava cake since it was THE BEST CAKE I've ever tasted ever!! It was moist and you can definitely taste the guava flavor.

We had the biggest portion of Poke' ever,  pork with cabbage, and a mixed plate.  We had  2 to go boxes left over,  Can you say, cold cabbage and pork for breakfast.  Lol 

I ordered the cake for dessert, nothing compares to Saimin Says where we live...so that's why I deducted the star. Would have done a half star..but not an option. lol It wasn't great it was ok!

4414638,2012-07-30,4,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Not even going to lie, this place isn't close to the strip. If you don't have your own ride, don't bother. You'll spend more for the cab ride then the food itself. However, if you dig that island grind brah, have your own means of transportation, and don't mind driving out southwest of the strip then this is a good spot to try.

We had some peeps meet us up in Vegas from that cold country to the north of us. They requested ""Hawaiian"" and after some research, Island Flavor was the chosen spot. Most people would've probably said to hit up the Cal hotel in downtown LV, but since I've been there before, I figured a new spot would be more interesting.

Heidi our server was funny and very friendly. She had that legit Hawaiian accent and looked like she can beat me to a pulp if I acted up on her. She suggested the sesame poke to share. A full order is a whopping $18 so we went with the half order for $9. The tuna was surprisingly fresh, the sauce was perfect, and the block cuts of fish were generous. There was enough to share between four people. The full order would've been overkill. I've never found a place that served decent poke except when on the Hawaiian Islands. I think Island Flavor proved me that good poke can exist on the mainland. 

The entrées here are no joke ginormous. I had the katsu chicken loco moco. I mean, talk about a heart attack waiting to happen. Fried, battered chicken, over rice, TWO egg cooked the way you prefer it, topped with this thick and rich gravy sauce that dominates the entire bowl. I worked half way into it and instantly ran into a wall. It wasn't even a subtle build up to getting full, it was as if my brain told me, ""Stop now, you're done."" By no means was this a negative thing. The katsu loco moco gets an applaud by my standards and if you can conquer this beast of a dish, I give you mad props. It can easily be shared between two people.

Got to sample some other goodies from my company like the Korean bbq short ribs, macaroni salad, omelet Portuguese sausage fried rice. All were tasty but every ounce of my concentration was zeroed on my katsu loco moco. In the end, man lost, food won. Togo boxes please. On a side note, we ate the left over cold the following day and it was fine.

Overall, this was a pretty good spot. I'd recommend this little Hawaiian joint for those of you willing to drive a little away from the strip and try something different then fancy hotel food. The prices were decent and the service was great. There definitely was an authentic island taste here. Be ready and bring your Polynesian sized appetite because you're going to need it. Only downfall was that they don't serve musubi!",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,4,5,4,GxnW-60IEAb4iptDZmN-nA

I ordered Spam Musubi and Kalbi Short Ribs.  The server brought out the Spam Musubi on a little plate right away still wrapped in plastic wrap.  She could have at least unwrapped it. The Spam Musubi had a layer of seasoned seaweed sprinkles on the spam which gave it a little more flavor.

This was of the best Kalbi Short Ribs that I have had in a Hawaiian restaurant in Las Vegas. There were 4 thick, tender, juicy, perfectly grilled slices of Kalbi.  Just a little fatty.  It came with a steak knife.  The Kalbi was on a bed of rice and raw cabbage with a scoop of rice and macaroni salad on the plate.  The macaroni salad was good.

Once we were sat, our server gave us menus and took our drink orders.  We couldnt decide what we wanted to eat because we were craving everything.  We started kff with poke, Hawaiian style.  It had inamona (kukui nut), onions, ogo, and soy sauce.  It was so good!!!! The best poke ive eaten in Vegas so far.  We both decided to get the mixed plate ($11.50) but you add $1 if you choose a mixed plate with Kalbi.  It comes with 2 choices of meat, 2 scoops rice, & 1 scoop mac salad.  The portions were humongous!  We decided to get the katsu/kalbi, & korean chicken/furikake chicken.  We enjoyed it.  For dessert, we shared a guava chiffon cake.

One tip if you are going for dinner be sure to get there early. The seating is very limited inside and gets packed real quick especially with the large ohanas coming to eat, we tend to take up a few tables. Lol!
The menu is exactly like back home, traditional white rice and mac salad with every entree plate. Us Hawaiians Love our rice! Got some local classics to choose from...Saimin, Chicken Katsu, Oxtail Soup, Hamburger Steak and cannot forget Hawaiian plate!!!! Every Aloha Friday stop by to get your hawaiian plate fix.

Chicken Katsu- pretty standard. Their sauce with the katsu was delicious. Finally, a katsu sauce that hasn't been watered down!

Roasted Pork Loco Moco- I know there are a lot of amazing reviews on this but I thought it was just 'meh'. The gravy was a little lighter than I would like and it lacked a bit of flavor. Maybe it was just an off night? I feel like loco moco is a hawaiian staple, so to mess it up would be blasphemy.  I mean they didn't ""mess it up"" but I have had and (made) better. Again, it may have been an off night and it definitely won't stop me from coming back. 

Spam musubis- these were awesome and even had a layer of extra flavor in between the spam and rice. I'm not sure what it was but I know it was green and may have had sesame seeds? Whatever it was, we loved it!

Chantilly cake- DELICIOUS! it was as if chocolate cake and tres leches had a baby. 

Guava Cake- So good and so PINK! it wasn't overwhelmingly guava-y and not too sweet. Just right!

Our first impression was not as good as I would have liked. We ordered our food to-go and when we got home, we realized we didn't have the right order. Thankfully, it only takes less than 10 minutes to get there from our house. My bf drove back to get our order and he came back with a complimentary piece of guava cake. They were all really nice when we were there, so not mad at all. Definitely coming back!",eH8-DE48eh6xXnoKc6_lnw,0,1,4,s-Oh2ZEsJb3BndW2qPJEKg

1 star food.
Came here last night on a friend's recommendation. Did it live up to it? Not by a long shot. 
Poke trio: All poke lacked flavor. Poorly dressed/seasoned. Saku block tuna.
Furikake chicken: Too much sweet sauce and batter. 
Roast pork: Was actually decent. Tender. Gravy was good. But inconsistent. Again, loved the gravy.
Kalbi: Either really burnt, or just charred. Not a lot of flavor. 
Fried rice: Not so good. Poorly made. Don't get me wrong, it was a generous portion. Chasiu pork was overcooked. And there were lots of parts where there was just white rice and it wasn't evenly tossed together.

Now for the nitty gritty:
The pork chops were a disaster. Overcooked would be a nice way to put it. It's as if someone went out of there way to sabotage these. 
In my career, I've seen med, med well and well done, even x-well. But these chops-2 entrees worth, were a disaster. I felt bad for the person who made these. Whoever taught person how to cook should really re-evaluate what they are doing. 
When we ordered another entree since 1 of theses orders was sent back, it took an eternity for it to come back out. 

Our server was great though. Thru some miscommunication, a combo came out incorrect. She kindly brought out some teri-chicken to make up for it. 

They were kind enough to remove the two pork chop entrees from the bill. Nice of them.
And of course they added gratuity to the bill. Maybe they thought we weren't going to tip accordingly?

Simple rule of etiquette: When a restaurant has a lapse in food or service, they should never add gratuity. It's like adding fuel to the fire. A major slap in the face. 

BUT, in this case, they actually saved us some money. We would have easily tipped based on service, and in this case, we would have tipped in addition for the items they removed from the bill. But they didn't give us the opportunity.

I chalk it up to every kitchen has a bad day. But in this case, it was awful, but saved with some nice service. 
And it amazes me no owner, manager, or other came by to address the issue.",kIUVD6fHUTj5Rz1Z7DZtJQ,4,1,1,qtd830V7aa5Y_M8ugPwbDQ

Heard many things about this place and they live up to the hype. The restaurant is on the small side so go early to avoid the wait! But the cozy atmosphere makes you feel like you're in someone's home. This compliments the great service and family feel.

Back to the food though - Roast Pork Loco & Sunday's special Kimchee Fried Rice w/ Korean Chicken. Portions here are HUGE! We had leftovers for dinner and even had some for lunch the next day.

Roast Pork Loco - the pork reminded me of kalua pork, but less salty. Tender, succulent, and when mixed in with the signature brown gravy and some egg yolk .. I can't even. Words escape how amazing this dish is. Each bite delivered an intense pork flavor with egg and rice playing a supporting role. I would recommend getting a side of their mac salad as well to help cut through the richness of the dish. 

Kimchee Fried Rice w/ Korean chicken wings - The plate came with a mountain of fried rice, 5-6 wings, and a hefty scoop of mac salad. They make some juicy wangs here! Crunchy exterior, juicy interior, with a sweet kick taste. The fried rice also had a healthy amount of kimchee. They do not skimp on anything here!

Definitely got a taste of island flavor here! I cannot wait to come back to try their other dishes like the Chicken Katsu Loco and Furikake Chicken.",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,38,29,5,z5juoSaLgqA5vE3IhG40Xg

Strangely, the portion sizes were uncharacteristically average, the service was downright cold and bitter, and the food flavor wavered from tasteless to over-seasoned. The saimin had crisp ingredients, but it lacked flavor overall - the broth really was like water, and it was lukewarm. The poke had great fish quality, but it was so over-seasoned with onions and garlic that the quality of the ahi was obscured. The galbi was solid, but just that - good, and nothing more. The saving grace of the day was their perfect guava cake and chantilly cake - nice, generous sizes, and delicious layers of distinct flavor without being cloying. 

Thanks to their amazing cakes, I will be rounding the 2.5 stars to a 3. But it's a close call - the service is in serious need of help. We were not greeted by anyone upon entering. The waitress was curt, not very accommodating, and very impatient, and the only warmth I ever saw from her was with the delivery of the check. Pre-tip, that is. While I can't know what she was thinking then, that always makes me suspicious, particularly when the service was so lacking for the rest of the time...

The loco moco items are just too heavy and greasy for my taste.  There is often literally puddles of grease throughout.

The kalua pork is alright.  At least they actually drain it, unlike Ohana up the road.  The proportion of meat to cabbage is good.

The teriyaki chicken is too overcooked and rubbery.

Their desserts are yummy and have a homey taste and is really what keeps me coming back here.  Honestly those huge portions are just too big and I would rather have the option to do like a ""mini"" or half-order for half the money.  I don't want to eat this unhealthy food for three meals in a row.  Vegas is really bad about getting more money out of people by giving them huge amounts of mediocre food.

Although, I occasionally go to a wide variety of the many Hawaiian fast food places around this part of town, overall, Rice Trax is the best. And L&L at least is very consistent.

Although the poke sampler was fresh and delicious, the different flavors all ended up tasty of soy sauce and got a bit salty after a while. The Furikake Chicken was great, sweet from the glaze but a little bit salty from the furikake mix, and tender inside and crunchy outside! However, it ended up just tasting sweet after eating it for a while aha.

My only gripe about this place was how understaffed it was. I do not know if it is family run or not, but they basically had two servers on the floor who were not able to fully service all the large parties that were there.

4702392,2015-12-11,2,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"It's hard to ignore raving reviews claiming the best Hawaiian food in town (of course, I was skeptical). I haven't found a single place that emulates the Hawaiian dining experience I miss about home. I understand the appeal of Island Flavor with its large portions and seemingly bold flavors, however, it's simply not comparable to Hawaii eats (specifically, Oahu). Surprisingly, it's not even the best Hawaiian food I've had in Las Vegas.

The Spam Musubi was good. They add sauce and furikake around the spam and have an acceptable rice-to-spam ratio. I'm not a fan of adding other flavors, especially sweet, to my Spam Musubi, but this was subtle enough to still enjoy it.

The poke was sad. I ordered a pound of their Shoyu Ahi Poke (MP; $14.50) and I was rather disappointed. There was way too much soy sauce (yes, this is possible) and it made the poke salty. Also, the ingredients didn't have enough time to mingle their flavors together and the raw onions were too sharp (and I love raw onions). All things that could possibly have been avoided had the poke been made earlier. This is one of the worst poke I've eaten.

For my entree, I got a Mixed Plate with Kalua Pig & Cabbage and Furikake Chicken ($11.25), plus Fried Rice (add $2). I normally wouldn't order something like Furikake Chicken, but it seems to be a favorite here. It's deep-fried boneless chicken tossed in a Furikake glaze. Pretty tasty, albeit salty, but not something I desire to eat again. The Kalua Pig was so MEH. The pork was slightly dry and it needed A LOT more of that Hawaiian salt. This is one of my benchmark dishes since it's a personal favorite and this one made me very sad. The silver lining is that the pork and cabbage helped cut the saltiness of everything else! I'm torn about their fried rice. It's not the Hawaiian-style fried rice I was yearning or expecting, BUT it has an appeal. I don't like the prominent and slightly overbearing soy sauce flavor of their fried rice, however, it was still enjoyable (as long as I forget my Hawaiian-style expectation).

I also tried the Furikake Shrimp and Kalbi. I'm almost certain the shrimp is the frozen breaded type tossed with Furikake after frying. Shrug. The Kalbi, on the other hand, was pretty good!

Yes, the portions are HUGE. You can definitely share a mixed plate (especially with that enormous addition of fried rice) with two people and still be stuffed. Service was wonderful. All three servers on the floor helped us (yay teamwork!) and were extremely attentive - though they didn't refill waters.

I used to be quite a regular here, so much that the waitress already knew what I was going to order and she welcome me with a glass of lilikoi as I walked thru the door. 

Today's visit was quite the contrary; as I walked thru the door the older lady turned her back to us but I simply went straight to an open table. A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door, the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance. 

After the long conversation, the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating, the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us. 

Finally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite, the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently, they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that, my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize! 

My blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu, take it off don't double the price. The price was modified with a piece of tape.

4744411,2010-08-07,3,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Island Flavor and I have gotten to know each other pretty well over the past year or so.  Always in search of good local food, Island Flavor has become king of Las Vegas as far as I'm concerned.  First L&L...then Aloha Kitchen...and Ross J's...it was like climbing the ladder of local food with each one being better than the last.  And at the top was Island Flavor.  Entrees under $9.  Gigantic portions that will feed you for two meals.  Delicious, consistent food.  Make you feel-at-home service.  This place really has all of the ingredients for creating a regular customer out of me.  

My favorite dish to order is the mixed plate with Chicken Katsu and Teriyaki Beef.  Each plate comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad.  The katsu is breaded just right, not too thick, with the chicken still moist inside.  The teriyaki beef is out of this world!  Honestly, anything beef on their menu is amazing (from the hamburger to the teriyaki, from the steak and onions to the loco moco) and is highly recommended.  I've also had some of their pork dishes and was very impressed with them as well; I don't really like pork, but here is a place where I'll order it.  

No joke, I'm getting some intense cravings for their food as I write this review.  Yes, I was just there a week ago...but for a good 6 months or so I pretty much came here once a week!  Highly recommended.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,3,2,5,3Zu64Qqw4aWUffHrXfMQsw

If you want real Hawaiian cooking then come here. They even had a live band on Friday night I think. Anyway, they played my in law's favorites including I Miss You My Hawai'i. The lady was pretty good I guess, for she left him and the better half misty eyed. I was gnawing on my food but she had a pleasant voice for sure.

We ordered a bunch of items including kalbi, loco moco, and Kalua pig of course. We also ordered the coconut dessert which is white and gelatinous, served cold. I think it's called oompia? I can never remember the names properly and am pretty ignorant of customs and pronunciation. The first time I went to Hawai'i I thought they were all pretty rude bc they kept sticking their fingers at me driving down the road giving me the Shaka. I am not a fan of the 1 finger salute normally. J/K BTW. It was delicious. I am not a sweets eating person and I enjoyed it.

Don't get this place mixed up with Island Style on Sahara. The last time I ate there to satisfy my Kalua pork craving before a big entrance exam, it was pretty food courtish. The pork was overly done as in sitting under a heat lamp kind of overdone. Flavor was just lacking. Indigestion in bed was complimentary. They give you peanuts at that place but the unwelcomed flies that were fighting me for my food made it less than memorable. You do Kung fu chopsticks with the fly on one hand while trying to eat with the other. This kind of callanetics I don't need. Rest assured you need not worry about them here.

He works by the airport, I live in Rhodes Ranch.. he could not understand why we were both driving further from town to have lunch.  The answer is simple - Yelp reviews!  Because of this restaurant, he opened his own Yelp account.

So, we enter.  My dad looks at the menu, I have already stared at all of the pictures on the iPhone app and know exactly what I want.  My dad is quite perplexed by the menu, so I show him the Yelp photos.  When the waitress comes up, he lifts up my iPhone, shows the waitress a picture and says ""I want this"".  The waitress, without missing a beat, responds, ""the pork (something) and beef spare ribs"".  To me, this is the beauty of Yelp.  It brought 2 new customers and gave one exactly what he wanted based on a posted picture.  It was sooo cool!

Our food promptly arrives, and it was everything we expected!  My Beef Teriyaki was incredibly tasteful, savory and tender.  The Korean Chicken was basically buffalo wings with a kick ass flavor.  Any other restaurant, I'd ding one star and recommend they do boneless wings - I hate buffalo wings, but the taste was still so overwhelmingly good that I did not mind!

My dads food was perfect.  He let me try his, I let him try mine.  No wrong choices.  He almost got a full steak attached to each of the 3 spare ribs.  He could not stop raving about the flavor and taste.

Service was swift and meaningful.  I have nothing to say bad about this restaurant.  The check came (less than $25 for two huge lunches),  the portions were so huge that I could not fit all of the leftovers from two starving adults into one box!

The sides were really good too.  The Mac Salad was also very tasty, quite possibly my favorite Mac Salad now, and the Rice was nice.

For dessert we had the Haupia Cake, and they are serious about their dessert too.  A nice mountainous slice of fluffy Cake and the Whipped Cream looked like an avalanche..  It was great.

The menu was plain and had no pictures and the descriptions leave you wondering if it's going to be worth it or not. 

My dudes ordered the Loco Moco and I ordered the mix plate with my boyfriend. My rice was a few hours old. My third bite into it I found a mustache hair or small black hair. I was disgusted because none of my dude friends have black hair, we are all blondes from California, so we can't be a suspect. I was disgusted not only because the hair wasn't on the top of my food, it was in the middle meaning it was mixed and cooked into the rice. That is extremely unprofessional for a kitchen staff. They have strict rules and regulations out here especially with the tourism out here. The manager came and said he has 3 restaurants 2 in Hawaii and this ""hair in the food"" issue has never occurred. I find it hard to believe as a former manager for Pizza Hut  and to never find any random item in food. The manager kept trying to get me to order something else from the menu but my stomach was in complete turmoil from this situation I only could drink my fruit punch, which the only good side was the free refills. 

I came up to the manager and told him that I am going to just walk out and drop this issue and I left without paying because I don't feel my health is worth the price of the meal. He will be hearing form the health department soon.

4835590,2014-04-01,3,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"PROS:
     Portions - you could easily share with someone if you aren't into leftovers

     Quality of food - everything I had here was delicious. The better half did a ""pick two"" with the shrimp and Hawaiian pork and I had the chicken katsu. We would have ordered more if we weren't stuffed with leftovers in hand  already.

CONS: 
     Service - very wishy washy depending on the staff working that day. One of the girls is extremely friendly while one of the other servers always has a confused look on her face and doesn't bother asking if you'd like the green salad or macaroni salad, which I think are extremely different and can make or break a meal.

Some shoyu poke followed which was also mind blowing. Hoisin ribs completed the food-gasm that was this restaurant.

service is great! food is delicious! and the vibe there is super laid back and it makes you feel like you're at home, and they definitely treat you that way also.

roast pork loco moco, beef steak, hamburger steak (which is HUGE! see picture), spicy korean chicken, portugese bean soup, fried poke salad...soooo good!!!

portions are HUGE, so you'll definitely have left overs or you could share. they have a 1lb t-bone that i keep telling myself to try. and im going to!!!

they have, by far, the best gravy!!! i dont know what it is about it, but you know its made from scratch. its not that really brown looking gravy that looks and tastes like its a store bought packet.

if you've had all the other ""island"" food out here...you MUST try this place!!!",_Q7yi_5LzFIb1ny2hpfyYg,2,2,5,quKrY1JkAbo1cghi8Im3rw

Sometimes the service is great and other times it's like WTF!  The last time coming here was very irritating.  It was the last time we came here.  Never again.  I placed an order online, Yelp, and came to pick up 1 hour later.  They were super busy, when my husband walked in to pick up our food.  He came out and said our order wasn't ready.  Then we waited another 15 minutes outside and then I went in and asked what the hell is going on with our order?  I spoke to the manager to figure out where our order was and he was an a-hole.  He said I ordered off another app, they didn't see my order.  They DIDN'T start my order yet or even try to accommodate us.  He said they're busy.  They deserve a zero star for that.  We didn't pick up any food...you can imagine how irritated I was.  I had to call the app to cancel my order I paid them for already to get my refund.

We came here 3 other times before this incident.  I would say the food is amazing.  Only one time the service was great...the other two times...it was frustrating to flag down someone to take our order.  They don't do well when it's busy and no one looks around to help customers.

First time i stood at the entrance waiting for someone to acknowledge me and eventually seat me. I stood there for 5 minutes while people whisked past me without so much as a smile. I left.

Second time I was more patient, I waited the same 5 minutes being ignored, then got sat at a ""dirty table.""  I guess it wasn't filthy but the tabletop certainly wasn't wiped very well (sticky). I waited 10 minutes before any server came to say hi, she wasn't very pleasant. I asked if it was a long wait for food ilke BBQ mix and she said it depends. She was called away and didn't return for another 5 minutes so I left.

Third time I decided I just HAD to at least try their dang food but I won't go inside. I ordered Ahi Poke and Loco Moco to go. Poke was pretty good, gigantic chunks and a lot of it, better be for $20. The Loco Moco was horrid. Plain, bland, no flavor at all, hardly any gravy, it was just plain bad.

between the 7 of us we had 6 plates and the total was $62. i thought for a combination plate, $9.75 was a bit on the expensive side.. until i saw the portions. my mixed plate came with 3 pieces of short rib and at least 4 furikake shrimp.. possibly 5. i could have easily split my plate with someone. 

the shrimp was the better of the two choices i had. not that the short ribs were bad... but i liked the unique flavor the furikake gave the shrimp. minus points for using mae ploy sauce as a dip for the shrimp. don't get me wrong.. i like mae ploy sweet chili sauce.. but i like it when restaurants take the opportunity to create their own awesome sauce instead of opting for pre-bottled stuff. 

the mac salad was just okay IMO. i'm in love with L&L's mac salad i dont think its fair to take away points if i can't tear myself away from their version. 

service was good over the phone when i ordered and very nice when we went in to pick up the order. it was all ready for us on the counter.

Ahi tuna poke - Basically a huge mound of tuna sashimi.  I liked it, but sure what makes it so special.

We ordered the Ahi tuna, furukake style. Not sure what the difference is in styles, but it came out with huge chunks of tuna, like 3/4 an inch cubed mixed with sliced white onions.

He ordered the kalua pig with cabbage, and I had a mixed plate with kalua pig and cabbage and katsu chicken. We also got a side of the kimchee cucumbers. The portions are huge, but the food is on point. I felt like the kalua pig could have used a little more salt, but everything was really good. We barely made dents in our plates and took a lot of left overs home, which were just as delicious heated up later on. I also got a spam musubi to go, and that was soooo yummy.

This is where you will be asking for extra napkins, put on some shorts and flip flops and bring a large appetite for some good ole Hawaiian plate food / comfort food.  Stop it, don't count calories when you come here.  Fill up and exercise after...you nap off the great food.

When Island Flavor opened up in Henderson, the owner was telling me to come over to the regular restaurant on Durango.  Today for Grandma's birthday, we came here for lunch!

The place - What is it with all this development south of the 215 between Durango and Jones?  What a great deal of good food places coming from this area.

The parking - No problem in this nondescript strip mall.  Plenty of parking.

The place - This your basic table and chair dining room that is truly basic because it is made to be eatin and not to be fussin.

The menu - Wow,  Ahi Poke, Salads, Fish, Beef Stew, Opakapaka, Oxtail Soup, Chicken Katsu, Pork Chops, Kalbi, Korean Chicken, Rigs, Teriyaki Chicken or Beef, Musubi, Mac Salad, Tons of Rice.  This place is heaven for good ole plate food.

The food

Korean Chicken and Kalbi - This is the mixed plate I ordered and the Kalbi is just right. Yank the meat off the bone and it is all tender.  Not too much bristle and fat just and plenty of good ole flavor. One of the best.  The Korean Chicken is great. Fried and then a wet sauce is added to this that is so tasty with all its oriental flavors. I really enjoy this Korean Chicken. It is basically wings.  Love it.  Plump and juicy.

Korean Chicken and Teriyaki Steak - The wifey had this and the steak was melt in your mouth.

Loco Moco - Hawaiian breakfast over rice.  A huge bowl of goodness is what my son ordered. He can eat a lot but he only ate half as it was so big and he was saving his stomach for dessert.

Island Flavor Salad with Catch of the Day - The daughter ordered this and it was both huge, at least 12 ounces of fish, tons of sald, sweet potatoes and won ton strips. She was starving and could not finish this.

Oxtail Soup - Wow, the soup was good but the oxtails were like soaking in the soup and there was a lot of it.  Great taste, fall off the bone and a lot of it too!

Mudd Pie - Ummmm, that crust is the best ono thing I can ever imagine. Is it a crushed oreo that is made into a crust?  I don't know. It was a large piece of pie and the Kona Coffee ice cream was good but I did not eat most of it. I instead ate all the crust. That was so delish!

Chantilly Cake - An interesting cake that I cannot really tell you if it is good or bad as my mouth was full of that crust from the Mudd Pie.

Chocolate Ice Cream - The daughter was expecting a scoop and she got like a huge sundae shaped bowl full of chocolate goodness.  I did taste it and it was very good for sure!

This place is so good. It is fun, tasty and comfort food at its very best, if you like Hawaiian Plate Food.

4974860,2014-01-05,4,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I don't particularly enjoy writing negative reviews, especially for a place that I once loved and highly recommended. 

Because we absolutely loved their kalbi short ribs, we decided to order a party tray from them. (1/2 pan size kalbi short ribs = $80) Imagine my disappointment when several of the short ribs were blackened, as in burned. They sat on the bottom of the tray and went unnoticed for awhile. We were wondering why our guests weren't eating them and that's when we saw the unsightly pieces. My mom went to the restaurant later on that week to let them know. They took down our phone number and said they would call us to talk about it. No one called. A few months later, my mom returned and went in to talk to them and again was told someone would call us to talk about it. We were told that usually the owner would have checked out our order before it went out, but on that particular day, she came in after we picked up the order. Therefore, she never saw the order go out.  Again, no call from them.

Because I was so disappointed with that experience, the food and the lack of customer service, I decided to just not eat there anymore.

After almost a year of protesting, we finally decided to order food from there again. I initially tried ordering Pork Lau Lau on a Friday, but was told they didn't have any. I ended up with the combo Kalbi short ribs and furikake shrimp. My short ribs were blackened again! However, the Husband's order of short ribs were just fine. Also, the shrimp just didn't taste that great anymore. My Mom always orders the oxtail soup and always comments on how fatty their version is. You can see chunks of fat on theirs that probably should have been trimmed a little. (I'm all down for a little fat, but theirs is just too much.)

Their tuna poke salad, both raw or cooked, was pretty damn good...especially the dressing. But it's since doubled in price and not really worth it anymore. 

Overall, I'm pretty sad that Island Flavor isn't in our repertoire of food choices these days. Quality and service had just gone down since they first opened and I get a sour taste in my mouth when I think of them now. With their current 4.5 star rating on Yelp, they won't be hurting for business I'm sure.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,18,5,2,YIGvdAC5MhDp9j7fV7sHfA

Portions are massive here. So massive that even an appetizer can get you full (well for me it can)- but even that wouldn't stop me from over ordering every time I'm here. The Tuna Poke with Furikake is AMAZING so be sure to start every meal with that, the entrees are all good (I always tend to get the mixed plate with Steak & Onions and Kalbi Ribs- also comes with a side of rice and Mac salad) while the boyfriend feasts on his Loco Moco with sunny side up eggs and a side of Spam Musubi since this place makes it the best according to him. 

I'll admit that I haven't ventured out to try new things since I'm always craving that one thing every time I visit, but I'm sure it's all good nonetheless. The reason I knocked down a star is that I used to be OBSESSED with their Haupia (coconut) Cake only to find out that it doesn't taste the same; perhaps a change in bakeries I guess. To what was once creamy, light and fluffy now tastes overly rich, gelly (with a lot of gelatin substances) and heavy.

After a long day of hiking at Red Rock, hubby and I stopped by here for dinner. When you walk in, you're not immediately greeted. Instead I got the feeling that you're supposed to be like family and seat yourself. The environment is pretty laid back. I actually felt like I was in Hawaii.

I ordered a combo with Korean short ribs and Hawaiian style pork. It included a fat piece of the tender pork and 5 pieces of short ribs. SO good and  very very very generous portions. Flavor was all there. I didn't touch the two scoops of rice. Macaroni salad was typical.

Hubby ordered short ribs and katsu. Katsu was well fried with a crispy outside.

I would definitely come back here again.

Quickly greeted and sat (I hear it's lucky to be sat so quickly) and the server was kind. There are many different selections and most of it being TASTY, SAVORY, and LARGE portion of food. I got the mixed plate which comes with two scoops of rice and a small side of macaroni salad.

We were exploring Las Vegas and heard about this place. The restaurant felt quite homey and the menu was simple with plenty of options to choose from. 

I had the Kalua pig and cabbage while my boyfriend got the Furikake chicken. The Kalua pig and cabbage dish was soooo good with SO MUCH MEAT. The meat was soft and juicy and the cabbage made the dish complete. The Furikake chicken was addicting as well. I don't know what they put in the marinade but I love it. Now, both of these dishes were ginormous and we were overly stuffed in the end. Each dish could easily be two dishes.

I was already almost done w the food when the same server noticed and said, ""they cooked it? I wrote raw on it."" And insisted that I get a new plate, corrected, and prompted took the rest of that away and delivered the new plate, with Mac salad and everything. Probably the best service I've gotten in Vegas!

5013547,2014-08-13,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Small joint that has a long wait. The service is rather slow, then again they only have 2 cooks, and like 2 servers, even if the place is small, they do make a lot of things on their menu, so you have to be patient if you want to eat here, especially if you have a moderate to large size party. 

As for the food, I ordered the roast pork loco moco. When I think of roast pork, I always think I am going to get some charred to crispy pork skin to go with the meat, I didn't, but what I was treated with was some really tender pork meat in a relatively large bowl. It might be the most tender pork I have ever ate. The bowl is large, and they do give you a lot, when I say a lot, I mean that you can probably share with a friend, there is so much rice in the bowl, it is overwhelming. The gravy was decent, nothing too special, you can order the egg however way you like it. I thought overall the roast pork loco moco was decent, needed some seasoning, it was a tad too bland. I obviously didn't finish, so I had it packed up for the road home.

I tried some of my friend's chicken katsu and I thought that was pretty delicious, right amount of crunch, great flavor, chicken wasn't overcooked. I felt like I probably should have ordered that instead, it was also a good size for one person. 

They also have several juices, I tried their guava juice, it was a good drink to cleanse the stomach from all the bad toxins incurred from the previous day.",DFih6Bhiw6_slNN5z39c4g,0,0,3,gYp8roDrmmhtYkTPxREHgw

I swapped the regular rice for fried rice for $2.00 and it may have been the best Hawaiian BBQ fried rice I have ever had.  They obviously make their own BBQ pork (char siu) because the mountain of fried rice had some nice juicy pieces.  It was a flashback to some Sam Choy fried rice where they prop the bacon up on the sides!  I had some of my wife's lomi salmon (great) and the poke (amazingly fresh big chunks of tuna).

5042266,2012-04-08,4,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Yesterday was an epic random celebratory luncheon.  Try saying that 5 times. LOL. 

We all know how I feel about this place.  Love it.  The food is total comfort.  The staff is AH-MAZE-ING.  I truly feel like I'm back home in Kona, Hawaii when I come here.  Partly because the owners and most of the staff is also from my hometown.  

The ONLY suggestion I have for this place is to expand.  Either expand the current location or expand to another location on the east side of town.  When we arrive, there was a wait and the entire restaurant was filled.  Maika'i Island Flavor!  Business is booming.  

I got the mix plate for 10.50- In my mix, I chose the chicken katsu dip and roast pork.  The chicken katsu is perfectly breaded and then drenched in their Korean sauce.  SOOOO GOOOD!!!  THE BEST chicken katsu I've had.  Every time.  The roast pork.  Believe me when I say that the roast pork outshined the katsu for me.  Tender, marbleized and served with a light brown gravy.  I didn't want that dish to stop for me!

For dessert, I got the Kona coffee mud pie slice for $5.50 and the Chantilly cake slice for $5.00.  The price sounds a little steep but trust me, you get your monies worth.  These cakes are served with whipped cream and both, a raspberry and lemon drizzle.  I'm in heaven.  The Chantilly cake is like a German chocolate without the coconut and the mud pie is an orgasm in your mouth LOL.  The Oreo cookie crust held this monumental slice of heaven together.  

Although everyone at the table got so many different things, my cousin got the shoyu poke which I have to rave about.  This poke was accompanied with onions, green onions and soy sauce.  If you've ever had the fortunate opportunity to try poke, you need to get this dish.  The raw chunks of tuna were fresher than fresh.  The soy sauce was perfect for the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This place always does it for me.  It's a shame I never go as often as I should because of the travel time.  When I do though, I'm always confident that my entire experience will top notch!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,7,4,5,hzImz_YMWzFt_3AbfNnMQg

We shared a combo plate of Korean chicken and the Hawaiian pork w/ gravy (which we added a egg to make it into a loco moco). The korean chicken are crispy little wings and drumlettes with a really tasty sweet and tangy sauce. That would be awesome if you can order a bucket of these like how chicken wings places serve it because we could definitely eat more of these. The pork wasn't shredded like I expected but slices off a big roast. It was a bit dry, but the flavor was pretty good. Wish we ordered just the Korean chicken, but we've never been here so wanted to try more than one thing. The serving was plentiful for both of us so the portions here on the heavy side of things. 

I read a lot of positive reviews for their cakes so we decided to get a Haupia cake. That was really delicious. the layers of cake was moist and light, had a good custard, nice coconut flavor that wasn't overpowering. If this was a place near our house I think I would come more often for cake than food. 

The server was full of Hawaiian hospitality and checked on us often.

The place is the real deal, best Hawaiian food I've had anywhere outside Hawaii. The crowd of people from Hawaii patiently waiting for a table in the Las Vegas summer heat at this unassuming strip mall of storefronts is testament to the quality of their food.

The people are sweet and friendly. Service as quick as can be with the crowd they manage along with the steady stream of phone-in orders coming in. When we came there was live Hawaiian music which set the perfect luau, sit diwn fir dinner with family mood.

The poke is the authentic kind, four flavors: sesame, spicy avocado, shoyu, and Hawaiian style - not the overly trendy kind popping up all over the mainland. Available in half pound or full pound.

Their laulau was is moist and perfectly seasoned and balanced - not too salty or fatty. Proof that it is fresh and made inhouse not frozen or reheated. Their kalbi has that great savory charbroiled flavor, not the overly sweet teriyaki that most Asian lunch joints try to pass as kalbi. The rest of my group shared the loco moco, chicken katsu, Hawaiian roast pork, and furikake chicken and wiped it out!

The servings are huge! Suitable for sharing by more dainty appetites but just right if looking to have a kanak attack!

The tables and chairs are spaced moderately from each other so while your party is still granted some form of privacy it's still close enough to catch parts of the conversation going next to you.

You hear stories about places back in the islands, memories growing up, uh-oh's from the party last night, grandma's funny joke, the usual gossip, and loud bursts of laughter just to name a few. Bottom line is, everyone is enjoying themselves and that's the atmosphere you would expect here. The menu has a good selection and if that's not enough, throw in a page of the day's specials and homemade desserts.

The interior decor nothing great but there's just something about it that makes you feel as if you were in someone's kitchen which is nice to me.  The staff and cooks are real islanders so they really know the true island flavors when it comes to cooking what we like.  Most of them even have the pigeon accent, a rarity to find people in vegas that are really from the islands.  The music they play really true to the culture, not no Jack Johnson like what other island theme restaurants choose to play.  The lady serving me was so kind and reminds me of my lola (grandma).

They are not selfish here with their servings. This is the first restaurant where I couldn't finish a loco moco (beef patty, eggs, rice, and plenty of gravy).  I only finished halfway and was already full with no room in my tummy reserved.  It was good because they made it just the way I like my loco moco, heavy with gravy baby.

5120240,2018-04-24,8,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"My favorite Hawai'ian spot in Vegas! I LOVE going here. (Prefer this location over the express location near me, in Henderson.) There are a variety of local kine grindz to choose from that are a unique to this place. 

You wouldn't really think about going to a Hawaiian restaurant for a burger, but I LOVE their Big Burger! You're probably wondering, ""Really?! Why?"" There's a unique seasoning they use in the ground meat that makes it one of the best burgers I've had so far in Las Vegas. The patty is thick and seasoned well, served with thick cut fries. 

My go-tos are the furukaki chicken and furikake shrimp. They usually have the Hawaiian plate on Fridays, and other daily specials. Check out their white board near the front.

You can also make your plates low carb by asking for mixed veggies (sliced and sauteed squash) instead of rice and macaroni salad. 

Make sure to save room for dessert or take it to go ;-). They have an amazing Kona Coffee Mud Pie, which is my go-to. Goes great with the Kona coffee they serve. They have a great list of other desserts as well. 

In December, they had Punalu'u French Toast!!! So ono! (So good/delicious!) It's definitely a must try. It's made with bread from the Punalu'u Bakery, the Southernmost bakery in the USA, on the Big Island at an area called South Point (the southernmost point in the USA.) They also sell loaves of it next door, at the Island Flavor Market. 

** Note: Or they use to! :-( Found out on my last visit they don't sell Punalu'u bread anymore. (Please bring it back, if can! :-) ) 

TIP:  Also check out their market next door for Hawaiian food, snacks, slippahs, 100% Kona coffee, chocolates, t-shirts, hats etc. 

There's always that Aloha service here from all the staff and it definitely makes me feel like I'm home.

**I noticed on my last visit a week ago, that the portions were smaller, and some prices went up. I hope they go back to the serving size they had before. Mahalo. Still my favorite place to get Hawai'ian local kine grindz!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,10,12,5,OR0vB9ghE4ETGYJh_986OA

Typical Hawaiian restaurant vibe, so how's the food compare??

Kalbi Ribs...very good! Tender and juicy, not as fatty as 808 Plate (much cheaper though!), but still a great rendition.  This is my go-to dish that I compare all other Hawaiian spots...they are a solid #2 in my book so far :)

Shoyu Chicken...good stuff! This was a daily special...very tender and flavorful. Quite a bit more sweet than I was expecting...not too much soy taste.  Grandpa ate up every bit!

Spam Musubi...just the right spam/rice ratio, with a little bit of furikake like seasoning! Yum!  It's actually one of the best versions I've had...so easy to mess up such a simple staple!

Guava Drink...yes please!  These are very tasty and hit the spot while eating all the great food here.

I'll definitely be back... the location is the only holdup for me!

It was my husband,  myself, my 8-year-old, 5-year-old, 3-year-old, and our baby. it took forever for them to come and take our order. I sat for a good 40 minutes waiting for a refill on my water. They never brought one of the things that we ordered and yet it was on our final bill. And I was very surprised to see that they had included the automatic gratuity at 18%.  I was even more surprised to see that they kept the gratuity amount the same even after they removed the item that they didn't bring us... We normally tip well over 15% but in this case I don't feel that the service warranted an 18% tip... I'm glad that we looked over the bill because they never mentioned the automatic gratuity.

I stopped in for a late lunch. I was actually surprised to find a sit down restaurant with waitress service. For some reason I had always imagined this to be a counter service place. Clearly, I was wrong! 

I ordered the Portuguese bean soup and the Kalua pork and cabbage. Given my limited experience with Hawaiian food, I had never had this bean soup before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The taste was yummy, but I was surprised to find lots of sausage. Probably a bonus for some and expected by those familiar with the soup. The sausage was flavorful, but I only ate a couple of pieces. I confess: I was hoping for more beans!

The pork was super tender, and I adore steamed cabbage, so what's not to like? I found myself wanting to pour BBQ sauce on the pork and make a sandwich like the Southern girl I am, but I was pretty sure they would look at me funny if I asked for BBQ! If anything, the pork could have used a little more salt, but I was impressed at its smoky flavor. 

It may be a sin, but you are able to sub the mac salad with a green salad, which I did! I really appreciate this healthier option. The green salad is huge and comes with a couple slices of a sweet purple yam, delicious!

I have been searching for a good Island/Hawaiian restaurant since moving to Vegas 10 years ago and after being sadly disappointed with some of the local spots (L&L and Ohana, not that they were horrible, just not a do again place)

But lately I had been craving some good Katsu and hawks in Lau Pork that didn't taste processed or fatty.
So I looked up my favorite place back home and copied the number one meal I would order and did a yelp search and Island Flavor popped up...
I figured with over 900 reviews and 5stars it can't be bad right!?!  Right!!!

It was soooo good
With it being just the first time ordering and we needed it to go as we had a ton of presentations to prepare for we ordered delivery (the only complaint but worth the wait as it took 60mins to get to us)

We ordered just the basics for the first time

Chicken Katsu (extra sauce on side)
Steak Teriyaki 
Lau Pork with gravy (extra gravy)
Furikake Chicken

We got bot white rice and fried rice
It also came with macaroni salad (good at first but a little much after the first few bites but not needed since there is so much fooooood)

I have to say the fried rice was so amazing, I have never had fried rice that tasted so good, fresh and delicious, it could have been a meal in itself, a nice little grill to it and mmmmm.

The Katsu did not get soggy and was fresh and tender
The Teriyaki Steak was fork cuttable and I didn't even mind the crispy fat pieces (like fried pork belly but steak)
The Pork was so tender and my mouth is watering as I type this and thinking that I must order this for dinner tonight.

I have suggested this place to a few friends since and all of them have had the same experience with everything ordered.

None of us have been disappointed and I don't think you will be either...

Fried poke salad ($10.25) - I was feeling adventurous. I can't say I enjoyed this very much but I guess it's more just my weird tastes. So I love seared tuna and I imagined it'd be like this. The problem with poke is each piece is a different size so the cooking is really uneven. Some pieces were burnt and grey and dry, some were pink and pretty, some weren't cooked at all, etc. I should have realized this before I ordered but that's my loss !

Hawaiian mixed plate - we got this with double rice, kalbi short ribs and kahlua pork. My husband was so ecstatic - the first place we've found where you can get the pork with no cabbage mixed in! This was tasty but not as fatty and wonderful as the pork in Hawaii. The kalbi ribs were incredible, husband declared them best ever. Delicious!

No doubt a neophyte regarding Hawaiian culture as well as cuisine it was with two friends that I sat down amidst the spacious confines of Island Flavor for dinner Saturday night, and going in with modest expectations based on what could be gleaned from reviews of those more accustomed the results were at times precisely what I'd hoped for, and occasionally far better than I'd originally been led to believe.

Admittedly at least 'familiar' with some of the styles comprising the genre, a number of Asian influences  noted amidst fried and roast meats with rich sauces rarely lacking in salt, it was just moments after 5:15 that I entered the sparsely decorated space and with the room half-filled by a mix of ethnicities that included several island natives it would not be long before drinks were filled and menus were navigated, a three-course feast soon to follow as  light mid-tempo music echoed from speakers overhead.

Well trained in service, the majority of the staff clearly longtime employees of the restaurant and happy to answer questions related to portions as well as preparation, it was with a duo of cultural staples that the sampling of Island Flavors began, and although neither would have been a preferred order if dining on my own both the snappy tuna and  Spam Musubi proved mostly what was anticipated, the former loaded with umami while the later, perhaps fortunately, saw the saline pork product mostly lost within the roll of warm rice.
 
Warned that portions run large despite costs that hover around $10 per plate, it was onward to three entrees that the evening progressed, and although the fried shrimp were a bit overcooked while the chicken was mostly flavorless without sauce, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in either the smoky shortrib or tender kalua pig, an equally well cooked piece of pork found strewn amidst rice beneath two sunny-side eggs and a rich brown gravy that, on its own, could have likely served a family of four.

Leaving at least four cups of rice behind, along with a few bites of macaroni salad that was actually quite enjoyable with plenty of creaminess packed in each bite, it was with an ""all-in"" approach that sweets were ordered up, and despite warnings and raised eyebrows from more than one staff-member the finale to follow was almost entirely worth the indulgence, the $5.50 Mud Pie a bit of a disappointment due to gritty ice cream while each cake from nearby Andrea's was presented at a bargain $5 per large slice, the faintly coconut Haupia not unlike something one might find at a wedding while the chantilly and guava came across sweet yet balanced, the quivering bread pudding taking a far less subtle approach with each banana-packed spoonful making a strong case for best in the city, or at the very least a good reason to come back.

Purporting no expertise in Hawaiian cuisine, but hoping to learn more in the coming months and years, Island Flavor represents a tremendous bargain to those looking for something familiar yet different with service and setting far superior to most eateries broadly grouped as 'ethnic,' the desserts a particular strong point even if they are mostly outsourced.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,8,4,g40cpREznX4xWN_R1kbi1w
5295254,2009-06-08,3,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Wow. This place is amazing! 

A few people at work keep telling me about this place. I swing by on a Thursday around early evening time to try it out. The inside of the restaurant looked like a place I would see in Hawaii. It wasn't over done but it was nice. The place looks like it could fit 100 people easily. What did scare me was the place was empty. Well, when I first walked in, I did see some ladies sitting on a table... but to my surprise they were the cooks and help just sitting around waiting for hungry patrons like me.

After telling them I wanted to order to go, they handed me a regular menu menu with daily specials and let me at it. They had the typical things you would see on any Hawaiian restaurant menu. What thing I did notice is that they didn't have any Spam entrees. After a good five minutes of looking over the menu, I decided on the following:

Beef Teriyaki Steak - (Bottom sirloin marinated with our special Asian sauce then broiled to perfection and sliced thin - $8.75) Wow. When they say Steak, they mean it! I have never seen Beef Teriyaki so large. Its like regular Beef Teri on steroids! Check out my pictures on how huge the portions are. The beef was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order this again.

Hawaiian Style Roast Pork - (Cooked local style with Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped with our rich homemade brown gravy - $8.25) Yum! What makes this dish work is the homemade brown gravy. The roast port was tender and soft. Large portions as well. Great dish. I would definitely order this again as well.

Korean Chicken - (Golden fried drumettes $ wings tossed in our delicious Korean sauce - $8.75) Yay! This dish was awesome as well. When I first cracked open the box, I just saw crispy chicken wings. I scooped some rice and pick up a piece with my fork and placed the chicken on my plate. I licked my fork and damn.... it was over. Just the taste on the fork was really really good. I had to dig in. So many flavors hitting my taste buds! I love this dish! Would definitely order again.

Each dish comes with two scoops of rice and a side mac salad. The mac salad was good as well. Overall.... I love this place! The food is awesome. The portions are large the price is comparable to other Hawaiian joints. I would seriously recommend this place to my friends and everyone else who reads these reviews. You will not be disappointed.

I was craving Hawaiian, after all. Kevin said the place is typically busy during the week, so I'm glad we easily found an empty table on the Sunday afternoon that we visited.

We decided on a half pound of ahi poke and an order of furikake shrimp. The waiter asked if we wanted a half or full pound of poke, and even though I had to resist, I'm glad we said half pound. It was plenty of food for two people. I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp, but I could tell it was expertly made. The crispiness was on point. I also loved the freshness of the poke.

This place used to be good. There has been a decline in pretty much everything from service to food since the change in ownership. 

I'm very disappointed in the new ownership and staff. I ordered take-out, which included 2lbs of pokè. I got home opened the boxes and realized they gave me the wrong food and I only had 1lb of pokè. I left the food that was right so my kids could start eating and went back to the restaurant to get the missing pokè.  

I brought the wrong food back to the restaurant and they asked me whether or not I touched or ate the food- which I hadn't. Apparently they also gave me the wrong pokè and asked me where it was at. The girl didn't want to give me the food I actually paid for unless I brought back the pokè I ""took."" The girl even asked me if we started eating the pokè and if we could bring it back. I didn't want to argue with her and said just give me one of my pokè so I can go. 

I saw her take the food I had brought back, re-bag it up, and give it to the guy who came in asking for his takeout just a few minutes later.  I was completely disgusted.  I worked in a restaurant for over 10 years and repackaging food that may have been contaminated is a health code violation.

I was expecting L&L style cuisine the norm for most Hawaiian dubbed restaurants. But was greatly surprised to to see the menu. It still has some classic L&L dishes u would expect. Kalbi ribs etc. 

But it's the non L&L dishes the caught my attention. Portugese bean soup (one of my favorites), Aloha LauLau Fridays, hoisin baby back ribs, Korean chicken and roast pork loco moco to name a few.. I have tried all of these and they are delicious.

The steak was delectable. The Korean chicken was perfection in taste and crispiness. The galbi was a disappointment. It was tough and chewy, unlike my amazing ribs. When I lifted one to take a bite, the meat slid right off. My plate was one of the few that went back bare, but I swear I shared.  The sesame poke was amazing and the serving is generous for $9.95. I might eat that when I am craving a ""light"" meal. We ended the night with some dessert. The banana bread pudding was good, but so dense. One bite and I was done. Then again, I did inhale a whole piece of the kona coffee mud pie. Sorry guys, you handed me a spoon and turned your back. I cannot resist ice cream.

I got the Furikake Chicken--Boneless chicken deep fried and tossed in a furikake glaze and Kalbi Short Ribs--Tender short ribs marinated in a Korean sauce and broiled to perfection. Two scoops rice and Mac salad finishes it off. The chicken was crispy chunks with lots of flavor, the kalbi was tender and so good! 

My husband got a mixed plate as well, Teriyaki Chicken--Boneless, skinless chicken thighs marinated in a homemade Teri sauce and broiled, he also got Hawaiian Style Roast Pork--Cooked local style w/Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped w/rich homemade brown gravy. Also came with two scoops rice and Mac salad. Both so good. Teriyaki sauce is well flavored and the pork tender.

Of course we had to have dessert, tonight's choice, Chantilly cake, Chocolate cake, Chantilly frosting (evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, butter, vanilla extract). Moist, rich frosting, good choice!

I zipped over and picked up our order and shot home to the wife with a bag full of Hawaiian goodies.

Don't get me wrong, the steak was good, but could've used a little seasoning and to be less reliant on the teriyaki alone. The rice was good sticky rice and the macaroni was pretty good too.
The furikake shrimp was a good size portion, 7 large butterflied shrimp, but was a bit on the overcooked size and a noticeable dark brown was given to the panko crumbs. Again, good sticky rice and my wife enjoyed the side salad.

The terms ""broke da mouth"" or ""ono"" are used when you have consumed foods that are so delicious, full of flavor that you can eat it till you go into ""polynesian paralasys"" hahahaha! This place cooks and serves their food as if they were still back on the island, plated with ""choke"" (lots) of food and with lots of local flavors.  All the other restaurants out there in vegas attemp to serve you what they call ""hawaiian bbq"" but Island Flavor doesnt sell theirselves to be a bbq spot, they stick to their name and serve you exactly what you want, Hawaiian food and more. The best Kalbi, well-done everytime and their chantilly and haupia cakes are just like home, maybe even better. Poke is fresh and the loco-moco's, three scoop rice, huge hamburger patty and choke gravy witht the mac, winner! Go in for the authentic Hawaiian plate on a friday or saturday night when they have live hawaiian music. Very laid back, everybody is family; auntie, cousin, uncle.

My personal favorites are the korean chicken wings/drummettes and the fried poke plate!  Now, how do you fry poke...isn't the point for the fish to be raw?!....normally that is true but they serve a seared poke that I would describe as mini ahi tuna steak nuggets...served with a huge portion of rice and mac salad.   They offer to cook the poke all the way through, but don't do it unless you want to ruin your meal...just a light sear is all you need for the fish to have a melt in your mouth feel =)  

I've also had the katsu loco moco (katsu covered with a fried egg and copious amounts of gravy) and this is not for the faint of heart....I believe my take out box felt like it weighed 5 lbs...this order quickly puts me into ""droopy eyelid mode"".....in other words food coma...so be forewarned.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,4,3,4,Te3rdDvzWLONQYO4mYimig

5516037,2017-02-19,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Being from Hawaii, it would seem redundant for us to eat at place like Island Flavor, but one of our friends, who lives in Phoenix was in the mood for plate lunch, so our Las Vegas connection told  us about this place.  It is easy to find in Durango, not too far from Silverton Casino and Hotel.  The place was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes.  I could see from the orders coming out that the portions are huge!  Make sure you go hungry!
I ordered the teriyaki beef and Korean chicken mix and the chicken was outstanding!  The teri beef was tender and flavorful.  Others in the group ordered, chicken katsu, kal bi, and teriyaki chicken. Each one that came out was piled on the plate and seemed to please all my friend's palates.  Most of the plates were priced below $10.
If your a Las Vegas resident, you could take the leftovers home for lunch the next day.  If your visiting, you might want to share your plate with someone in your party unless you KNOW you can finish it.  If you share, you might have a little room left for dessert, which looked and sounded good, but none of us had any room for it.",wsPi76dAKxTp4YyNHnb8SQ,1,0,5,DqE1A7llgK2kRYY-yWy8Sw
5517490,2016-01-06,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"We drove from the North end to the Southwest on this cold and rainy night. Did I mention we had to drive in fog. Big deal, right? Well yeah if your night vision sucks, and you've NEVER had to drive in fog, ever...in your life.

We were invited back to give it a second shot and I amq so glad for the invitation because I probably wouldn't bothered coming back just because I originally felt I wasn't missing out.

For a Tuesday night and all the rain...I was so surprise to see how full the restaurant was. It was busy. We were quickly greeted by Mark, who then became our waiter for the evening. He was such a delight to have. My son spilled water and he literally did not lose his delightful vibe as he was cleaning it up. I felt so bad. I give Mark 5 stars for his professionalism and welcoming feeling.

Tonight between us all, we had  ordered the furikake poke, kalbi, kalua pig and cabbage, opakapaka misoyaki, chopped steak and onions, and the furikake chicken. When you get the furikake chicken...your eyeball will fall out its sockets because of the portion. I saw that thing from afar and was so shocked. More so, this plate was for my 6 and 2 year old son...and it could easily have fed me as well. Note for next time. I gave it a bite and definitely loved the crispy chicken and the glaze used over it. The furikake was definitely evident.

My husband had the opakapaka (pink snapper) and of course he loved it! The misoyaki sauce used over the fish was light, and had a sweet taste to it...it paired well with the fish. I can't tell you much about the chopped steak my 8 year old had, because he literally devoured it...literally. Since I had ordered the kalbi and kalua pig combo, but really cared for the kalbi...I shared my kalua with the hubby. Kalua pig was legit.

Then there I was, with the kalbi I had tried the first time we visited. The one that I said was missing that island flavor I was looking for. Okay, well...Kalbi came out with a vengeance because tonight's kalbi was exactly the flavor with the char I was looking for the first time around. It did NOT disappoint. 

Seeing the place a second time around....I say they have a better menu selection wise than 808MP. They offer fried poke, and I slapped myself for not ordering that tonight, but I came for the kalbi. So you know what that means...I will officially be returning. They serve BIG portions and it is definitely worth it for the price you pay. I can officially up the star it deserves.

Highly recommend if you are craving Hawaiian food.

There's no bettah compliment I can give a Hawaiian restaurant. Island Flavor is located in an unassuming strip mall on Durango. It's probably a good 15-20 minute drive via freeway from the Las Vegas strip. It is worth the drive. Trust me... Drove up and I knew it was gonna be good cause there were people waiting outside to be seated and also I could hear a small group (3-piece band) inside singing Hawaiian music. It was great. I felt at home... It's kind of how Hawai'i makes you feel. Aloha all around.

 I ordered the chicken katsu loco moco after seeing photos of it by other Yelpers (mahalos!). It came served in a giant bowl. Let me just say that I feel classic loco moco dishes or any variation of a loco moco should be served in a bowl. It's only fitting. The katsu was delicious. The batter was light and chicken was not dry. The gravy that was generously poured over tasted great with the katsu and the bed of white rice. SO ONO... Sadly I was a weakster and could only finish half of this heavy handed portion of a meal. Even our waitress was giving me grief saying I cannott leave if I cant even eat half. HAHA.... Apparently, I didnt hit the required quota. I will make sure to represent mo bettah next time.

And of course we couldnt leave without having the coco puffs... I havent had them since when I was fortunate enough to attend my coworker's wedding on Oahu in which she had Liliha Bakery supply coco puffs & green tea puffs instead of slices of wedding cake... It was so good & so appropriate. Quite possibly one of the more delicious sweet things I've had in my life. Now Island Flavor's coco puffs are not exactly the same as Liliha's original version but they are delicious in their own right. Totally worth the $6 or so for the half-dozen. They top it with whipped cream too but that really isnt even needed. They are great and are a taste of Oahu for sure.

I will make sure to eat here next time in town which is thankfully enough next weekend... I'm gonna bring some of my friends that havent been there before & I'm sure they will like it as much as I do and spread the word as I have.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,3,1,5,StER0OFBmbNfDqcKB32I0A

Literally minutes after writing the previous one star review I got a message from the owner Bruce.  He was so kind and apologetic that he offered to give us a full refund on said dinner.  He continued to guarantee that all of his food is prepared fresh daily and that the turn over on food is so quick that food never sits.  I believed him.  This particular situation prompted him to look deeper into the problem as far as checking in with vendors that supply his restaurant to try and find the source of the problem.  

Due to the overwhelming amount of concern, professionalism and care that he has given me and my friends...I think I'm gonna write this off as a fluke accident.  It happens to the best of em. Besides that Furikake chicken is too good to ignore!

I was very pleased that I got four big pieces of Kalbi and there was meat on them bones, not a lot of fat, which can happen with this dish.  There were also two big scoops of white rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I ate one scoop of the rice and didn't touch the mac salad, but only because I am trying to be more protein-oriented and eat less of the bad carbs, but you gotta have some rice with your meat, right?  The kalbi looked and tasted like it just came off the BBQ in someone's backyard; after three pieces, I was fully satisfied.  I'm just sad that we couldn't get any of the Spam Musubi before we left.

5659862,2014-06-02,2,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Went here this morning (6/1/14) because I didn't have all the ingredients I needed for ossobuco. I decided to pop on over to this place by myself before I headed off to work. With nearly a 5 star rating, my expectations were through the roof.

You know those movies where token ""not whatever race everyone else is,"" walks into a bar and everyone turns around and looks at them and a soundtrack of a disc stopping plays in the background. Umm, yeah, that's what it felt like when I walked in. I was the only white person here and everyone turned around when I walked in. Super strange. Plus, two tables of people kept staring at me during my meal and trying to make eye contact. Whatevs.

Anyway, I guess I was channeling Michael U. and decided to try more than one item off of the menu. This is how I wound up spending $34 (including tax and tip) on a meal just for myself that consisted of soup, salad, and a piece of cake. Yeah, I can't order like that on the regular, regardless of the fact that I walked out with enough leftovers for another large meal.

I ordered:
Hawaiian Style Saimin $8.75
I am convinced that the egg had to be rancid in this soup. It smelled and tasted off. Noodles were very grainy tasting and the broth was bland. I picked around the egg. Would not get again and would suggest you refrain from ordering this.

Island Flavor Salad $13.95
The Opakapaka (pink snapper) was great! This salad comes with a TON of dressing on the side and luckily, it is delicious. Loved the combo of flavors. The only thing that would have made this better is if it had some chunks of citrus thrown in to the salad. Would get again.

Guava Cake $5
BLAND. Tasted like nothing with Cool Whip for frosting. I was served this in a to-go box for whatever reason, but it worked out because I didn't eat the whole thing so it was already ready to go.

Service was whatever. I would have loved a water refill at any point in the meal. Seems as if there are a bunch of regulars because the waitresses were chatty and friendly with everyone. While the salad was good, I don't know if it was good enough to warrant another trip back here.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,6,5,3,Y47K1adKmoUt8-lqki-uyw

now onto the food: i ordered the hawaiian plate which included lau lau, rice, mac salad, haupia, salmon lomi lomi, and tako poke. and my cousins ordered the chicken katsu loco moco and two item plate special with kalbi ribs and teri chicken. the loco moco gravy is like no other i've tasted before, and with the chicken katsu, to die for! the teri chicken was standard, but not dry to a plus in my book. the kalbi ribs were just right, and the lau lau made my freakin' trip! a little bit of pork for the fattyness and flavor and chicken for variety. add some hot sauce on everything, and i was damn good to go!

if there is one complaint, they were a little slow. but since i now live in nyc, i'm used to being super rushed. i've forgotten what it's like to be laid back and relax! i def need to fix that one, maybe a trip back to visit nanang and tatang in kalihi?!

all the food was delicious and i would eat here all the time if it wasn't for these three factors: i don't live in las vegas or anywhere near it; if not eating it all day everyday would make me a fatass, literally; and i need variety in my life when it comes to food. i can't just have hawaiian food for the rest of my life. but it's not to say that if it was all there was left to eat in this world, that i wouldn't be happy as all hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",MDsrQ8PtiYWkcGvlVqb8sw,0,0,5,wF3whUUK-jANTiMJU5GOKQ

Furikake chicken are boneless chicken pieces deep fried and tossed in there special Furikake sauce. The Furikake chicken was out of this world!

5688691,2011-01-07,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"I love this place. Everyone from the server to the cooks in the back are very friendly. When we got there I ordered the terriyaki chicken plate (to compare it to the other terriyaki chicken plates) oxtail soup, chicken katsu, and I believe some type of pork. I can't really remember much about the pork because of all the other food I ordered but let's just say from the several bites I had it melted in your mouth.

Let's start with the terriyaki chicken. I have to say that this is the best terriyaki chicken at a Hawaiian restaurant. L&L's is too fatty and chewy, Aloha Kitchen always requires you to remember to ask for it with no skin, and there are a couple other places that weren't so memorable. It sounds strange to say but the chicken tasted like ... chicken. Real meat, not covered up in fat and that chewy gristle, just meat, that might not make any sense but if you've had that chewy gristle you know what I'm talking about.

The same goes for the chicken katsu. The chicken was solid meat and the breading was crispy and clean, not soggy and greasy like some other places. Same goes for the oxtail soup, while the oxtail was extremely fatty (I never knew ox carried so much fat in their tail) the actual soup was not greasy but crisp and gingery. It tasted a little bland at first but once you start eating the oxtail and bites from a couple other dishes the soup actually complements the flavors.

If I'm craving some Hawaiian food, this would definitely be among my top choices. However it loses a star because believe it or not I'm a fan of the canned mystery meat known as spam. They don't have any spam dishes and their spam musubi is pre-made and sits out on the counter which means first come, first serve and if you get there at night then you're SOL. But even if you were to get it, you have to eat spam musubi that's been sitting on the counter for awhile, for some reason it's not made to order, kinda weird but all in all a good spot.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,3,2,4,flacSh86UNd8m5zhb0z40w

Since we were such a large group it took a bit to come out, but the wait was well worth it! The portion sizes were ridiculously huge, so I had enough for both lunch and dinner!

I got a combination plate with the Hawaiian roasted pork and the Teriyaki beef. The roasted pork is something dreams are made of! It is almost like turkey, but slices of fork tender pork covered in the most delicious brown gravy. This was the highlight of my meal and the white rice just balanced out each bite. The teriyaki beef was also good, a little chewy, but I loved the sauce. I also tried the Chicken Katsu covered in the Korean chicken sauce. It was crispy and delicious! I wasn't a fan of their mac salad, although I tried it a couple of times just to be sure.

5765930,2018-03-30,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Overall: Island Flavor serves up some good food, and the service is great.

Food: 4

Mixed Plate with Kalbi Short Ribs and Furikake Chicken: For the price, this dish was very worth it. There's enough for at least two people, maybe even three if you don't eat a lot. The kalbi short ribs had a nice char, and it had the actual smokey taste of being cooked on a grill. The furikake chicken was crispy, and it had a really tasty glaze. It might even be better than orange chicken.

Sweet & Sour Short Ribs: I know a lot of people who would absolutely love this dish, but it wasn't for me. The short ribs were tender, but they were drowning in a bowl of sauce that was too sweet and too sour without any balance.

All orders come with two sides. The usual is white rice and macaroni salad, but we subbed the macaroni salad for stir fried veggies in both. The white rice is pretty good and similar to Korean rice, so its higher starch content makes it a little sticky. The stir fried veggies was mostly zucchinis and it was well-cooked.

Service: 4

The servers were really nice and they even thought to bring out extra plates for us to share. They were pretty attentive, and they stopped by frequently to ask if we needed anything. Although the thought was nice, I would have actually preferred if they didn't ask quite so often (~4 times in a one hour lunch). The shop is small enough where I can flag one of them down easily if I needed anything.

Ambiance: 4

The restaurant is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. It isn't a super large restaurant, but it has plenty of tables and it doesn't feel cramped and it's pretty clean.",scWPwwaZeZsk0OzJ856z-w,2,0,4,Lhu7bIdY5U77zmIYrqI5Xw
5778770,2014-07-16,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"When this place first opened, I used to drive all the way from Green Valley just to come here - I was addicted to the amazing haupia cake (freshly baked at the bakery next door). The food was also good, enormous portions and the waitress Heidi was so crazy and fun. Over the years, quality and size went down significantly, so I stopped going a while ago. It's ironic because I now live on the SW side of town, and drive to Island Sushi, which is down the street from where I used to live. Anyway... 

I've kind of rediscovered Island Flavor because a couple friends still really like it. I resisted for a while but finally gave it a try, and the quality and large portions seem to be back. I think all the original people are gone, so maybe it was sold, but they got rid of that huge counter that took up the whole middle of the restaurant and added more tables and chairs. New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch. 

The owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion. I'm sticking with the haupia cake.

One day I walk in and all of a sudden, my favorite dish, the Kalbi Short Ribs went from $11.99 to 16.99.  I bit the bullet at the time because one thing they were known for was their generous serving.  They usually have gave you 5 strips of the short ribs. I told myself $11.99 was a steal, $16.99 is a huge jump, but I guessed the portion was worth it. 

When the dish came, they now only give you 3 strips of short ribs.  So I can't blame anyone but myself.  I just ate it, and left. L

I will say this, their service was, and still is one of the friendliest in town.  The cooks are still doing a great job as the ribs still tasted good.  This where the 2 stars come in, it's one star each to thank to them for their hard work.  I simply can't give these new owners any more of my money.  It's not the prices, I spend a hell of a lot more at other establishments, but the way they did it was not smart.  It's the principle.  

My quest begins for a new Hawaiian BBQ place...if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!

Response to owner - I trust that you know the quality is even better.  Quality of beef was never an issue for me.  That's why I always went in the first place.  The quality is still great.

We were told that the lau lau leaves are flown in on Thursday to make/prep for Fridays.  Anyway, it was worth the wait!  Delisssshhhh!!!  I called and ordered take-out and less than 20mins later upon arrival, my order was ready.

We ordered (for 4 ppl to share off each other):
1 - Aloha Special plate (Lau Lau)
1 - Aloha Special plate (kalua pig)
1 - Chicken Katsu w/gravy on the side
1 - Chantilly (giant slice)

Lau Lau: flavored well and generous amounts of pork and fish
Kalua pig: also flavored right w/a generous portion 
Chicken katsu: Nice n crispy w/CHICKEN inside (other places are tight on the chicken to the point that u find yourself only eating the breading) WTF?!!
Chantilly cake: YUMMY!!!

***Bonus: the Aloha Special plate comes w/haupia!!!  Love love love it!!!  I felt like I was at a luau back at home  The haupia does NOT disappoint***

I've also tried the oxtail soup. It is heavy on the ginger, and the meat was a bit tough, but the broth was above average. Don't expect the same type of flavor as California hotel. I think they use bouillon cubes or some heavy MSG, so it isn't as salty. 

The beef stew on Saturday's is super popular, but I didn't like the taste too much. It sorta seemed like they added a lot of cornstarch, flour, gelatin, or something to thicken the sauce and I was not enjoying the flavor. 

Still yet, for the service as well as their standout items like the loco moco, furikake chicken, and their chicken katsu, this place is a solid win when it comes to bang for your buck.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,3,4,5,C7x7xr32va80lvcyJES9UQ

Most recently, I tried the Portuguese Sausage with 2 eggs, Hoisin Baby Back Ribs, and Furikake Fried Chicken. Everything, I mean everything was good. The sausage plate came with rice and mac salad. The sausages were sweet and not too salty. The rice and mac salad just sealed the deal. Drizzle that egg yolk and mix with the sausage and rice, and get ready for some hit the spot goodness. 

The baby back ribs were near perfection. Pork meat nearly dropped off the bones and the Hoisin glaze was quite a unique sauce experience. The glaze was sweet but not that overly sugary taste you would find at a traditional bbq joint, but more of a refined sweetness. Not sure how to describe in words. Just order the rack.

Furikake chicken was delicious. The texture was crunchy and no where near soggy. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Paired that rice, and my goodness. You can't stop!

The location is off-strip, but on the way to Red Rock. In fact, it's nice to get away from strip madness on a Vegas strip. Regardless of the location, this is one of my to-go places on every one of my Vegas excursions.",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,2,0,5,WivGvyFCIgDu6lWp3wigGA

Portions: HUGE. One plate could feed three of us had we known they were going to be so big. Kahlua pork is mild, but super tender. I could've used a bit more salt on the meat, but it was still good. Sweet and sour pork ribs were tasty but almost a little too salty. Furikake chicken was bomb. I added Sriracha and it became super bomb.

My only complaints are regarding the rice.
Brown rice - too much water so I basically had two scoops of brown rice mush.
Fried rice - now this is where I think Island Flavor failed because their version of fried rice is basically white rice with some lapcherng and veggies doused with soy sauce. I've eaten and seen fried rice made enough to know we weren't eating fried rice. The portion was a potful. No joke.

COCO PUFFS = yum. I have no idea what the buttery yellow stuff is on top of the chocolate cream puff but it's ONO.
Mud pie = good. I liked the chocolate cacao or coffee nibs in the kona coffee ice cream. Really nice touch. Could do without the flavored syrups on the plate though.

Staff were friendly even though very busy.

My default order here has been the kalbi and Korean or furikake chicken with fried rice. I suggest that you washit all down with a POG or lilikoi juice for the ""local"" feel cuz that how we do it on the island. 

Just be warned that the plates here are massive! Just look at the pictures of the massive mountain of Ono-kanack food. Always get leftovers. You want to save room for the Ono deserts like the Kona mud pie or chiffon cake.

5918745,2011-07-21,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"Finally tried Island Flavor for the first time today.  Been hearing only positive comments and recommendations for this SW Hawaiian eatery in a relatively undeveloped part of town, and the experience lived up to expectations.

The portions are way more than generous.  Sides?  They can serve you a ""side"", but it will still be entree portion.  Just about everyone who dines here, leaves the restaurant with the tomorrow's lunch pre-packed.  The desserts are just as big as the big island, and the ones I tried (Banana Bread Pudding) was delicious.

I tried the mixed plate with the Kalbi Ribs and Hawaiian Style Roasted Pork (serve with gravy), plus the Ahi Poke (Shoyu) and sampled the sesame and furikake ones as well.  I personally really enjoyed the sesame ahi poke. But I think the Poke Salad (entree sized salad) also looks very delicious, and I will most likely try that in one of my future visits.

Besides the good food, the price is reasonable. You are definitely not going to leave this restaurant feeling like you can have a Big Mac Combo.  It is perfect for a family or hungry & growing teenager, football team, etc.  

It is perfect for anyone that wants good food, generous portions for a reasonable price!  The friendly service is added to the package for absolutely no additional charge.

Are you an ahi poke fan? This is the best value and taste for the money in all of Las Vegas.  Sesame flavor is probably the best, but everyone's preference is different, so try them all (just not all at one time, unless you have an army to help you finish it). No joke!

Food:  4/5   Some misses, but most are hits. Definitely worth the drive to this part of town if you are in the mood for Hawaiian food ""local"" style.

Portion:  5/5  How many different ways can you say the portion is huge?  Each plate is enough to share for two regular people.

Service:  4/5  Friendly service. 

Location:  Can be a long trek for some, considering the location, but I think it is worth it.  If you are visiting from out of town, unless you have your own transportation, I would suggest passing this one up (trying to get a cab out here back to the Strip would be a hassle and costly).

Price:  5/5  For the portion, it is definitely worth it.

Ambiance:  4/5  Hawaiian inspired art works adorned the walls, but I didn't pay it much attention when I saw the plates of food at the pick-up window.

To be fair, it's been a constant struggle to find good Kalua Pork in Vegas. The only thing I enjoyed was the Kona Coffee Mudd Pie, which was shared between four people since the slices are huge! Never came back for years, until very recently. 

About two months ago, we ate dinner here with friends and the restaurant was very busy. I think we waited at least 90 minutes to get a table. But the wait was worth it because the food was delicious! I ordered the Furikake Chicken, which was very very good. Huge portions, wasn't too salty and they put the right amount of sauce on it. I think I also had enough leftovers for two meals! The Guava cake was awesome as well! I have had bland ones from other restaurants, which basically tasted like yellow cake with whipped cream. But this one had a good guava flavor. Service on this day was great too. Even though they were busy, the servers were attentive and refilled our drinks promptly. After that, I was like ""My bad, Island Flavor is pretty good.""

Wrong! The husband and I were in the area last week, so we decided to eat dinner here. Everything was pretty horrible except for the Guava cake. They were not as busy on a weekday. I ordered the Furikake Chicken again, and it was not good. The chicken was lukewarm. Ewww. Did they even take time to cook it?? I felt like the chicken was made hours earlier and all they did was warm it up in the microwave, threw some sauce and furikake all over it and called it a day. Yuck! Even the brown rice was lukewarm and cooked with too much water! None of the servers refilled our waters. What happened??

So yeah.....maybe its just luck and it depends on who is working. I'm giving them 3 stars because I know their food and service can be really good. Sadly, its only on certain days.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,7,2,3,QTEROR58xQOkX0QiXYBY3w

My favorite dishes to date are the kalua pig, chicken katsu, korean chicken, Lau Lau, oxtail soup and the poki is great. 

Things I personally have come not to like are the roast pork loco moco and the fried rice with Portuguese sausage, both a little too salty for my tastes, but many other people seem to enjoy them.

It wasn't very edible because it was the end of the day food, and I called the next day to let them know that I wasnt satisfied and they made sure that I got the same meal waiting for me when I went down to pick it up at no additional cost. This is the meaning of customer service!!! I love this place and would recommend that anyone who wants to try Hawaiian food here in Las Vegas make a trip to Island flavor!",UF5S9-XHsCBaPBL_ShBvkQ,1,0,5,J3bMbACPUKghviQWM92UMw

Will be a loyal customer of this establishment forever. Thank you Island Flava!",SeGAMSvCzT7HcTivGvss9Q,2,0,5,6U6knGpqM39rnt0o5y0upQ

Getting the food to go so once consumed I'll let you all know how the food was.Well, I ate the whole thing lol and it was really tasty.  Short ribs have a tendency to have more fat than meat but this place gives plenty of meat, nice flavor, tender...perfect. The Kona Pie was really good but the crust was a little too sweet for my taste. Chicken teriyaki was pretty good also. This place is the real deal so if you want more of the authentic Hawaiian food flavor come and give this place a try. Have a wonderful day and happy yelping  your fellow yelpie xoxox",RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,3,2,4,zUJ7cp9gH2EIVUl1ciZ2Qg

Your roasted pork loco moco was absolutely to die for!  Even after my boyfriend and I split the one order that arrived in a huge pho bowl, we still were absolutely stuffed!  

Their poke is also good as ever, I recommend getting it furkake style.",yy_KQA1FtwilaG-7LB4BgA,1,1,5,AwrxnhMelXzx4cr91hlhaA
5960070,2014-05-07,5,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"After a nice dinner out with my friend, we decided we wanted a little dessert to top off our evening. Thinking about all our options in the area, we finally decided to head to Island Flavor. I had never been before, but my friend kept raving about their cakes, so I was excited. I opted for the guava cake and my friend ordered the Haupia cake. I also ordered a kalbi plate to-go for my fella.

The guava was delicious, but the Haupia was my real favorite. Both were incredibly fluffy and light. Delicate flavors, I can't wait to come back for their desserts alone. Service was quick and refills were plentiful. 

Our takeout order was ready quickly and we were on our way. I couldn't resist taking a bite or two of my fella's kalbi plate as well. The meat was flavorful and cooked well. It had a nice smoky flavor and the mac salad was one of the better versions I've had. Not overly creamy and complemented the meat and rice perfectly.

The food was great and I look forward to coming back to try the rest of their menu.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,5,4,_9CuCr_KeYIwZN578Ql1aw

I highly recommend the furikake shrimp, furikake chix, opakapaka misoyaki style and the poke with furikaki! So ono! Broke da mouth kine good! Beware the sweet potato is not the american sweet potato. Also leave room for dessert, though it may be hard because the servings are huge! But the mud pie is delicious and huge. You could share that between 3 people. It's actually a good thing this place is far because i'd be here all the time!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,1,1,5,CW4jfdbbpfx_W9Tus1bzcg

The both come with a side of white or brown rice and a scoop of macaroni. The kalabi short ribs were marinated in a Korean sauce and the furikake chicken was crunchy white meat.,eLPZ-HpGMlLTZKuEB5ZEJw,0,0,5,4BMdnILa9PjpZ3wLAsywKw

- My sister used to live in Las Vegas and this was always the one restaurant that I always had to visit 
- Island Flavor comes from the lovely Big Island, with a couple of locations still there 
- Live Hawaiian music on Friday and Saturdays from 6-8:30pm - this is the time frame when the restaurant gets packed, but it creates the best atmosphere!
- Leilani, our server, is the veteran waiter and has been at Island Flavor since the beginning.  She showers you with authentic and joyful aloha - she made us feel like family!  
- If you're on Yelp's cash back program, this restaurant offers 10% cash back! ;) 
- In short:  Delicious Hawaiian food, fantastic service, live music - perfect! 

What we ordered: 
- Kalbi short ribs price $11.50 - A full order comes with four delicately smoky, sweet, perfectly cooked ribs (not overcooked, still a tad pink on the inside).  Just get it! All plates come with choice of starch (white rice, brown rice or French fries) and choice of mac salad, sautéed veggies or salad.   
- Mixed plate of Korean fried chicken and Kalua pork with cabbage $11.50 - Leilani, our lovely waitress, suggested we try the mixed plate, where you can try more options.  The Korean fried chicken was probably my favorite thing we ordered - extra crispy on the outside, sweet with rich glaze and incredibly juicy on the inside!  The mixed plate portion of the Kalua pork with cabbage was simply perfect. 
- Opakapaka cooked misoyaki style $15.95 - The misoyaki style is a wonderful way of cooking the opakapaka - the fish retains moisture and the misoyaki sauce is a mixture of savory and a tad sweet.  The opaka was a little on the dry side though. We ordered this dish with the fried rice, $2 extra, but it was definitely worth it!  Soft sticky rice, with generous chucks of pork, it was very moist and savory. 
- Spicy Avo Poke - I refuse to eat poke on the mainland, but when Leilani suggested it, I trusted her and I'm glad we tried it!  Huge cubes of firm ahi mixed with avocado, crispy wonton crisps and drizzled with a spicy mayo sauce.  It was actually very very good for mainland poke! 
- Kona coffee mud pie - $5.50 - By the time we finished our dinner, I was stuffed beyond the comfortable level but my friends powered through and got the Kona coffee mud pie.  I only got a bite of the deep rich Kona coffee and dark graham cookie crust.  Let's just say they had no problems finishing it even though we were so stuffed!",dka-nwnZEak9Qn-xOxYqyQ,1,0,5,BBBVeL7ak06fqhLa5Azftw
5995165,2017-10-30,1,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"The furikake chicken happens to be one of the most popular entrees there, but it's not exactly my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but I just don't see myself eating it every time I visit Island Flavor. Also, it's not really that good as leftovers which is a bit of a disappointment. 

On the other hand, I do like the teriyaki chicken, Korean BBQ, and the teriyaki beef. It's so flavorful to the taste that you just want more. Also, the portion sizes are so big that you're sitting here thinking you should probably save the rest for later. With that said, the prices are just right for them. 

Often, I get a to-go order because they're quick and I avoid the rush which is fantastic because sometimes it can get so busy there. Not ideal when you're famished. 

Overall, I would recommend this place for the taste of their entree, price, and portions.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,3,1,4,kdkzkiCqJFk6nY7z5VMCXw
5996404,2017-05-16,0,uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,"We lived very close by to this Hawaiian spot and one day decided to come try it. Since that day this had always been the spot we go to when we want Hawaiian food. The inside is kinda small but the food well worth coming here. On Fridays there's a family of 3 that sings which is awesome. Everything we've tried here is great from the appetizers of the poke took the desert. Everything is very big portion sized. My husband go to drink is their fruit punch. I like the pog juice since it's something I grew up drinking. When I'm with my husband we usually get the mixed plate since the portions are so big and we add Mac salad so we each can have one. My go to is their chicken Katsu and my husband likes to get the Kalbi or furikake chicken. 

They do get busy sometimes and the wait could get long. The service is great though. I've brought my parents here and they loved it. Overall, we love this place and come back every so often.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,4,muj3W-jvuuqqMVDjkYracQ
