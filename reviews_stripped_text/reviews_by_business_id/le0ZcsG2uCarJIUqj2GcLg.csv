731557,2017-11-20,0,le0ZcsG2uCarJIUqj2GcLg,"So it's a Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas, it's a few hours past lunchtime and a few hours before dinnertime...hmmm, what to do?  I had a fun experience on a food tour a few months back on the Las Vegas strip with TasteBuzz food tours, and I saw that they offered an afternoon tour in downtown Las Vegas.  I decided to sign up on the website, and with one click I signed up and experienced yet another enjoyable tour!  

What makes the tours with TasteBuzz so enjoyable is how well-thought out they are.  Not only are you experiencing the array of tastes and flavors of the food on the tour, but you also get to explore the city with an incredible guide!  The downtown tour starts at one of the city's most renowned and celebrated streets, Fremont Street!  While on Fremont Street you really see how much the landscape and streetscape changes as you pass through the one of a kind Container Park, then into the bar hopper's paradise of Fremont East, and suddenly you enter an area (with so many things happening at once including people zip lining, extraordinary street performers and on this particular day a concert) known as The Fremont Street Experience.   At this stop Kathy, the guide, brought us to a food truck that serves up the most tender and zesty barbecue you will ever have!  Prior to indulging in the food here, we were educated on the different styles of barbeque including what distinguishes the styles of barbeque found in different parts of the country. 

In downtown Las Vegas it is really remarkable to see the contrast between the casinos downtown and the megaresorts on the Las Vegas strip.  During the tour you have the opportunity to step inside and capture the essence that makes these casinos so legendary!  There will also be some unusual sites to take in at these properties while touring!  Actually, you get to go to an unexpected place to find a piece of history that forever changed a nation!    

You also get to eat some items from the menu at a local's favorite restaurant including a food that the entire world adores!  In addition, you get to find out about the champion chef that is behind it all!  There is so much more tremendous food and sightseeing on this tour!  Both of the tours I have been on through TasteBuzz food tours created experiences that feature great food, great people, and magnificent sightseeing!",OGCNFT8kMXLgmLEwjoMSow,1,0,5,jnGXEMEchvBD6Q8kwbd8qQ
1359801,2017-11-06,0,le0ZcsG2uCarJIUqj2GcLg,Great afternoon learning about Las Vegas and the Strip and sampling delicious food at 7 restaurants/shops.  Kathy was a very knowledgable guide and took us to some places that are definitely hidden gems on the Strip.  This was a wonderful change of pace from the usual casino activities.,hqLZsho2e6l_owHUvLk5Zg,1,1,5,zQdrd5mIAnLaSwIwoiLl-w
1705230,2018-05-01,0,le0ZcsG2uCarJIUqj2GcLg,"We had a great time with our Strip walking tour. We lucked out as it was just us and our guide Nesah and trainee Jennifer. They met us promptly at the Cosmopolitan and we started tasting after a little interesting history of the hotel. We enjoyed the hidden gems they shared with us at the Cosmopolitan and then headed over to the Bellagio to see the gardens. Next stop was in a curio shopping area that we would have passed by but with Nesah, we were introduced to a great hot dog and corn stand plus a cool area to visit. We journeyed on to the Linq area and sampled steak with asparagus. Dessert was a bonus with gelato covered in espresso and we ended with Hawaiian cookies that we even got a baggie to go of treats. Nesah was great and we enjoyed her expertise and just her company. A lovely way to spent time on the strip and we highly recommend it!",cl8DfZVPnHERoEjbK4lG0A,0,0,5,K0jIv-FLhAH86E38sJiz0w
2141598,2018-01-18,0,le0ZcsG2uCarJIUqj2GcLg,"This tour was amazing! Our tour guide Kathy was very friendly, professional, upbeat, pleasant and easy to love. She was very thorough while providing the tour and always went the extra mile to make us feel good. My husband doesn't eat corn on the cob and while we were sampling at another restaurant she ran over and when we arrived to the Mexican restaurant they had a serving of Mexican street corn carved off into a bowl for my husband. 

The tour began at the container park off Fremont street and ended not too far away about 2 blocks from the golden nugget hotel. 

We visited 6 different places and the tastes were good sizes. We had pizza, jerky, popcorn, hotdogs, milkshake, meatballs, Hawaiian Mooshibi and saw very cool sites and learned a lot about downtown. I would definitely recommend this tour.",X8Cnvd2T4iwAqkBJ9OT_Pw,0,0,5,Lv5ADkSKYG-QITs533eKgg

3938715,2016-07-01,0,le0ZcsG2uCarJIUqj2GcLg,"I meet Kathy through a friend who told me about her food tour.  My first impression of her was that she was enthusiastic, upbeat, well-spoken, informed, and knowledgeable of the restaurants and events happening in Vegas.   Kathy did a great job showing me all the places around Vegas. 

I really love food tours.  I know it's touristy, and I'm sure I can do it on my own, but there is something about checking out 4-5 restaurants and visiting tourist attractions with a group of people.  Whatever suites your comfortable level, these groups of people can be your friends or a group of strangers.  It's all about sharing the experience together!

I fully recommend this tour.  It was a nice balance between fun and educational.  We all have different styles and tastes, so be sure to express what you hope to do and what you want to eat.  This will make your tour worth the experience.",O_PVgC-k8NV11CWVTaYHCQ,2,1,5,4DszGI0CZm-MmYAJq2GcsA
3948003,2018-04-07,0,le0ZcsG2uCarJIUqj2GcLg,"My husband and i look for Foodie Tours each time we vacation. We decided to do the Taste Buzz Downtown Delights Foodie Tour on Fremont street while in Vegas a few weeks ago. It was fantastic! The guide was thorough and knowledgeable about the area. She took us to areas we had never experienced even though we have visited Vegas dozens of times. I have been to Fremont Street before but never like this. She took us to little know and also well know places and taught us about things we would have never found out about on our own. I had no idea there was a piece of the Berlin wall in Vegas.... and in a place i would have never in a million years found.... even if i tried. The food was delicious and very filling. I'm not sure how the other reviewer could have thought there was not enough food? We could not finish everything that was offered to us. The selection of food choice was carefully thought out and skillfully assembled. Fremont street has changed since i visited many years ago. I enjoyed learning about the history and renovation stories. My husband especially enjoyed the jogger on Fremont... wearing only stilettos, a thong and pasties!! TOUR BONUS!  You never know what may Happen in Vegas!  We revisited some of the places and had a full lunch at one of them the following day.  I have recommended this tour to a group of my friends who are headed to Vegas next month. You will NOT be disappointed!",0RlLudgPci8uGdSqaG_4UA,0,0,5,5MSXsY3uMgSySoSDR4dW1w

Starting off with a couple drinks and some tasty fare, Kathy was incredibly knowledgeable and confident in her choices for us.

Trying the food at all the different spots was so much fun. You don't get too full and of course, it ends with the best part, dessert. Highly recommend this food tour as a finale to any trip to Las Vegas. With so many places to eat, she narrows it down to what's good so you don't have to.",lYhHi85OEyyyi4FtWz7prQ,0,1,5,3hDCfpMSwZpP3F_0ROS-UA

We saw so much we wouldn't have seen otherwise and the food was incredible. Especially Cheffini's hot dogs. Still thinking about them today....,VNotYpDLCa4fnYvWyphBww,0,0,5,A0a5clN_6F8hQyYXHGbuoA
