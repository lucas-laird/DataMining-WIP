1. When the delivery driver dropped off the food she completely over reacted and flipped out when I opened my door and my extremely friendly shi tzu ran up to greet her.  She acted like she was about to kick my dog and nearly threw the bag of food in the air.  I told her my dog is very friendly and there is no need to act that way.  She told me she hates dogs and walked away all rude. 
2. Opened my bag of food and it wasn't even my damn order!!!  
3. Called Denny's to get my food order fixed and they had no idea how to handle this huge mistake.  I spent 15 min on the phone with them while they tried to figure out how to handle this and get me my correct food I ordered as well as telling them I don't want cold food, I ordered hot food. 
4. Almost two hours after initially ordering my food from Denny's I am still starving and now I don't even have time to eat my breakfast when it gets here as I have to go to work... hungry...  besides..it's lunch time now!

We stood at the counter waiting for at least 4 minutes while the servers were running around taking more orders for all u can eat pancakes, all while seeing us waiting patiently.

The Grand Slam breakfast is a good deal which allows personalized variety.  I had two problems here: the syrup comes out globular - it doesn't pour out of the container.  Syrup is supposed to be warm and flow.  It comes out in globs.  It is very obviously filled with HFCS.  Is sugar too expensive for Denny's?  I suggest not serving pancakes if they cannot offer decent syrup.  Also, and this is the worst part - they had NO water!  They brought me a glass of water from the soda machine - when I told them it was seltzer, they knew, and said their soda machine was broken and ""a little bit of seltzer leaks in the water.""  It wasn't a little bit - it was 100% seltzer - undrinkable.  They told me ""sorry"" and I had to eat my breakfast without any water.  This is not acceptable, and in my opinion, a health hazard.  They should have offered me bottled water, free juice, or something.  I thought about going int he bathroom to get a drink out of the sink, and then this got me mad enough to write this review. We will not be going back.  Too many other options here in Las Vegas for decent breakfasts.  I wanted to mention, too, that when we paid the bill in the front, the lady asked me how it was (she appeared to be the manager). I told her ""there was no water!""  She said ""I know!""

I was pretty hesitant because I always check out reviews on YELP, before I go anywhere! And the 3 stars was scarin' me man, but we reaaaally just wanted some food so went anyways!

We walked in, were politely greeted by the host, and were promptly seated. It was about 9am and wasn't too busy at all, a few customers here and there.The host asked us if we wanted drinks and handed us our menus, very nice guy! The waitress, her name was Debra I believe, was very nice and always checking up on us to make sure we were okay! 

Food took quite a while to arrive, maybe about a 15 minute wait. Who can cook food that fast anyways? No biggie. The food itself was delicious. I ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich, with french fries on the side, not bad~ I also ordered the $2 pancakes from the value menu, it was okay, a bit on the dry side though!

The boyfriend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and zesty nachos. He liked his grilled cheese, and man the nachos were da BOMB.

Pretty cool that they're open 24 hours, that's always a plus! And OH, they have BACON everything! Bacon burgers, bacon desserts, bacon shakes! I personally hate bacon but if you like bacon, check it out!

3227805,2014-09-15,0,rwfZVEomWWGb-1wrvCpRuQ,"I prefer to write reviews of places I like, but everything here was so wrong, that I couldn't just ignore it.  

My husband and I arrived for breakfast at about 8:45 am. The distracted hostess seated us relatively quickly . . . in a booth that should have been replaced years ago. The dent in the booth was so deep I felt like I was going to hit the floor. Nonetheless, I scooted over to the undented section and looked at the menu. 

I decided on the waffle slam as a treat, cuz I love waffles, crisp on the outside and light and fluffy inside. It comes with two eggs, plus bacon and sausage (I swapped out the sausage for more bacon) and a cup of bold coffee.  Then, we waited for someone to stop by. And waited. Eventually, the hostess asked if we had been helped yet and went to tell our server. We waited another five minutes or so and she arrived and took our order.  My husband received his OJ right away, and she brought cream for my coffee.  Ten minutes later, still no coffee. Eventually, I was able to flag down someone else who had my coffee sent out.

Breakfast arrived another five or so minutes later. Cold. Over cooked. With only one egg. The waffle was so crunchy that it arrived in four separate pieces that someone pushed together to try to make it look whole, and the butter never melted on it, because it was lukewarm. The single over easy egg was about room temperature. Eggs with runny yolks really need to be hot to be enjoyable, even if there is only one on the plate (I don't even know how that happened since ALL dishes usually come with two eggs). My husband couldn't even touch his hash browns because they were burnt. 

Our server came by ten minutes later to ask about our food, but I couldn't even say anything. All she needed to do was look at the plates before serving to see that it was not serveable. No one even offered a refill on my cup of coffee. We ate what we could (the bacon was immobile, like the kind on a buffet, but edible), and when the bill did not arrive, got up to get it from the front. At that point the overworked server gave it to my husband. 

At the front, when asked how everything was I told them it was terrible from service to food, and especially management (poor training, poor scheduling, etc.). They asked us to wait, but I was DONE waiting and left while my husband paid the bill. And, yes, they charged us for a full two-egg breakfast despite only receiving one egg. So, the next Yelper to make the mistake of going here, please make sure they give you my second egg without an extra charge. 

Oh, and my husband HATES sitting.  We are usually in and out of places in 30-45 minutes because he gets antsy. We spent so much time waiting that we didn't leave (despite not finishing breakfast) until an hour and a half after we arrived. Sheer agony for him.",-tiPkTkiT60-Kv7nqVdgiw,2,0,1,GdJGv8J0cj07LGVuO47nHg

4014384,2015-12-03,3,rwfZVEomWWGb-1wrvCpRuQ,"Breakfast of Champions!  OK, more like breakfast of maybe semi-pros.  When was the last time you saw Michael Jordan at a Denny's?  That's right, never.  Although doesn't Shaq or Magic Johnson own a few of them?  Can't remember.

I like this Denny's location much better than the one closest to my home.  This one is bigger and the décor is a bit more inviting.  Service seems quicker & more hospitable.  Plus this Denny's turns over people at an alarming rate, especially on a weekend morning.  Long wait lines disappear pretty quick!

Not that I eat breakfast at Denny's all that often.  And really, Denny's for the most part is synonymous with breakfast.  I look at the lunch & dinner menu and I just shake my head.  Why oh why does it seem like it caters to older (much older) people?  Not saying it's bad, but just seems so old-fashioned!  So, I just stick with the breakfast stuff.  

I like cheap, and when I want an OK breakfast for chump change & am sick of $1 breakfast sausage burritos from McDonald's, I end up at Denny's.  Yeah, you go to their regular breakfast menu and some of that stuff costs you a few fingers!  More than $12 for some of their damn omelets!  $10 for a friggin' breakfast sandwich!  Unbelievable!  So I go with the little, all the way in the back of the book, value menu.  Get items priced at $2, $4, $6, and $8!  More my style!  Save the rest of that money for some Lipitor prescription later.

I often opt for the $4 Everyday Value Slam - its got 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (I go with sunny side up), and either 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links (I usually ask for 1 bacon strip & 1 sausage link).  All you need for a growing middle-aged man!  

But this particular morning I was feeling extra manly and won a gangbusters of cash the night before at the casino...went home with $20 profit WOOT WOOT!  Changed that sucker for all $1's homey!  I felt like ballin' so I went with the BIG bad boy - the $8 Grand Slam Slugger!  2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (over easy this time), 2 bacon strips AND 2 sausage links yo!  With a side of well-done hash browns, baby!  Plus it includes an endless cup of coffee AND a small cup of juice...orange for me, boi!  Breakfast just got BIG PIMPIN'!

Felt like a million bucks eating this thing!  Pancakes were light & fluffy not to mention drenched in butter & warm syrup, dippin' my bacon into the runny egg yolk & ketchup just like I like to do, even the damn coffee was pipin' hot & fresh like Beyoncé's backside (yeah I got 99 problems but hash browns ain't one).  Don't forget the Cholula!  But whoa, had to knock it down a star because of the cholesterol overload!  Halfway through I was boggin' down, this Grand Slam Slugger ain't no joke!  Watch out, it'll put you down for the count!  Just too rich!  I felt like I needed some kind of vegetation on my plate to counter all of the oily goodness.  Even a piece of parsley would have been good to gnaw on.  Ended up taking a to-go box with about 1/4 of the Slugger left.  Be forewarned - cold, rubbery pancakes make bad, BAD leftovers.

Great bargain for all the food & drink you get!  The $8 Grand Slam Slugger from Denny's will be my go to breakfast meal from now on, except I'll probably end up sharing it with the wifey.  Yeah, 2 for 1!  Save that money!  For Lipitor & a crossfit membership!  No joke.

I asked him to repeat what he said because I'm thinking maybe he can't make me a smoothie. But he repeated ""I won't make you a smoothie"".
To this I become upset because he could have lied and said, hey you know what my machine is down or whatever and I would have been fine. But the fact that he said he won't just pissed me off.
That's ridiculous.
I don't blame him personally because the restaurant should be better staffed to handle all customers no matter what time. Not one person doing everything because that can be difficult. But I do blame his attitude and rude way of telling me he won't.
I had to walk out of the restaurant to prevent myself from yelling at him for telling me he won't do a smoothie.
I'm going to pay for a smoothie and he wants to tell me he won't?
That's dumb.
So his name tag said Michael but the name on my receipt is Nathan B.
It's a white male in his early 20s. He's always there at this time. He's always making sure his black suit jacket is nice and clean instead of checking on customers. He wears a black vest like he works at a high class restaurant.
I always have an issue with his service because I come often late at night but it wasn't until today that I had it.
