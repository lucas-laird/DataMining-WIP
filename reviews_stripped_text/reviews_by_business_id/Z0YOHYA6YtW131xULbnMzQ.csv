it brings back memories of good old filipino home cooking with their ox tail soup served with two scoops of white rice.  the meat on the ox tail basically falls right off and the broth is amazing.  nice big serving with 4 pieces of meat in each of our soups.  we also ordered the $4.00 steak and it tasted like $4.00.

service is pretty quick once you get thru the 30 min wait in line.  the only other bad part about the place is that they only serve the ox tail soup between 11pm and 11am.",spPNnBVj4h46oVWgsh7gJw,0,0,4,X7yohDujz5996rvNs5O-zg

I must admit- I was awestruck the first time I visited this establishment.  I was taken aback by all the traditional breakfast fixings and their super afforadable prices for breakfast ($5.25).  So I definately made it a point to revisit this place my second trip.

That's where everything went wrong.  On my second visit, no hash and portuguese sausage were present...all morning.  I stood in front of the empty buffet tray desperately awaiting someone to acknowledge this catastrophic mix up.  I stood in front of the empty tray for nearly 15 minutes refusing to start eating my hawaiian breakfast (which was getting cold in my hand) without hash and these portuguese sausages.  To my horror, they brought out enough hash only to feed a family of ethiopian midgets and portuguese sausages most hated cousin, kielbasa.

 Parking was free for me because the gate operator was gone. I did see signs about validation requirements throughout the parkinglot. The only plus is that they serve oxtail at after-clubbing hours, the downside is that it is served at after-clubbing hours. The oxtail is MEDIOCRE. The broth is too salty and the oxtail itself was a bit dry. If you are Asian or familiar with oxtail soup then you will be disappointed about the oxtail soup here. If there is a line to be seated then it isn't worth it. I arrived at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday and was lucky to be seated right away. If you come after 11:30, you will probably have to wait in line.

852530,2006-11-04,2,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"alright..alright...the market street cafe at the california hotel is probably one of the best local and Hawaiian secrets here in las vegas.  for one thing there are hella Hawaiians in this place.  the cafe is your basic vegas 24 hour cafe.  it serves the typical steak and eggs, omelets, chicken finger, and house salad dishes...blah.  everybody here in vegas comes to eat here for the oxtail soup.  fricking hella good.  you can't get this anytime.  you have to wait till after 11pm to get this dish.  so i imagine this  stew with chunks of meaty oxtail, carrots, peanuts, and mushrooms simmering all day long till it gets served in a huge soup bowl with a couple scoops of rice on the side.   when you get this dish drop a couple of spoons of rice into the soup.  Then, pick your fork at the oxtail, the tender juicy meat just falls off so easily off the bone and plops back in the stew.  you then take the meat and dip it in this little dish filled with ginger and cilantro, but i take it to another level and squeeze some lemons onto the ginger with some Tabasco sauce to give it reggie's extra zing!!!!  this meal is totally cheap, and probably one of the best comfort food after a night of heavy drinking.  be warned, everybody around here knows about the oxtail soup.  when you get to the cafe around midnight, you'll notice a long line snaking out of the restaurant.  when you walk into the cafe, at each table you'll see at least one person with a bowl of oxtail soup.  YES....it's that good....",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,3,3,3,WZHvhvptVRZrD-sGH92-_g

873007,2017-01-30,1,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"Saturday, 8:30pm:

I had the $9.99 Prime Rib Special with unlimited salad bar, one side of baked potato or rice, one side of canned green beans, and fruit jubilee ice cream dessert. It was located at the Market Street Cafe which is open 24 hours a day.

Wait Time: At 8:30pm on Saturday night, there was a wait of about 30 mins. We would have waited longer, but were lucky because they came through the line and asked for parties of two and allowed us to skip the line. From what I hear from the cashier at exit (you self pay when you leave), she said it is ""always busy"" there. There was a line still when we left an hour later.

Appetizer: Salad Bar

The unlimited salad bar was a nice touch (3/5 stars) - it included only ice berg lettuce vs what I would have preferred to be mixed greens. There was Mac salad, potato salad, and a big bonus ""imitation crab salad"" which was surprising to me as I have rarely seen that before in a salad bar. One thing of note was that they seemed to have ""real"" diced hard boiled eggs with normal white color and yellow yolk. This is opposite to my recent experience at Sweet Tomatoes which seemed to have more processed lighter pale yellow colored yolks and very bleached egg whites. Overall the salad bar was decent but nothing to write home about.

There was no bread option included.

Main Entree: Prime Rib

Prime rib (4/5 stars) was about equivalent to a nice prime rib you would get at a good buffet and possibly 2 steps below the famous House of Prime Rib in SF (which btw costs like 6x the cost). I would say it is about 10oz in size, medium cut.

Sides:

Green beans (2/5 stars) - The likely canned green beans were not as good as the ones you get from Ellis Island steak special -- under seasoned and soft.

Baked potato (3/5 stars) - It was a baked potato. Not as good as those found @ Sweet Tomatoes. Furnishings except for sour cream and butter, although I believe there was bacon bits available in the salad bar.

Dessert: Fruit jubilee ice cream

Very good (4.5/5 stars). Vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream, a crispy cookie, I believe strawberry jam at the bottom.

Service: Server was very nice and attentive -- definitely felt the ""Aloha vibe.""

Overall: solid 4/5 stars. Good balance between quality and cost.

""Would I Come Back Again?"" Rating: Emphatic YES.

They only serve it late night, so make sure you don't come here before 11pm if you want the oxtail soup.

The name is deceiving, though it does offer all day breakfast - there are many Hawaiian items on the menu. Most likely because, being located in the California Hotel, it caters to the heavy Hawaiian tourist clientele.  

Upon arrival, we were dismayed that there was a long line wrapped along the entire corridor and our hopes were dwindling as the staff was counting off how many parties in each group and it seemed so out of reach that we'd be able to eat in this century. 

Alas, we saw the light at the end of the tunnel and was able to get seating right by the entryway.

Not everything on the menu is offered at all times. However, they have this lovely section on the menu, labeled under ""Graveyard Specials"" (11 pm to 9 am) where we got a NY Steak for $6.99! I ordered the Oriental Soup Combo ($7.29).

Now, I know you're probably wondering what quality of meat do you get for $6.99. Turns out, something overcooked and tough, with texture resembling muscle fibers.

In hindsight, we should have probably ask for it to be prepared Medium instead of Medium well, tis' bad 3 am judgement.

But looking on the bright side, it came with a side of fries and warmed frozen green beans, so it was salvageable(?).

I had high hopes for the Saimin wonton soup. The noodles were slurpy and cooked perfectly, the broth was savory and warmed my soul, having sold it to the blackjack dealer earlier. The wontons were tasty morsels with hearty filling, however the wrapper had been soaked too long and fell apart in my bowl. The char sui was gummy, and inedible. The medium sized shrimp was appealing, but unsure if I could trust the crustacean, I passed on consuming it. Loved the fresh spinach in the soup, and ate some of the fish cake, but I've never been a fan of the artificial coloring of the fish cakes, even when I lived in Japan so, left some of those too.

I was so sad to let some go, but at least we felt we got our money's worth which is always a nice feeling in Vegas.

We went around 5am after a long night of gambling and there was no line. It was super empty... I'm sure the rest of the world were soundly asleep in bed. 

Ordered an oxtail soup and they didn't charge us a sharing fee.... I thought there was one but it was totally worth the $10 bucks it costs. The oxtail soup pieces were huge and super tender, came right off the bone. The broth was flavorful... I would have liked to see more veggies in there, but I think the star was the oxtail anyway. The only other complaint was the soup wasn't piping hot; it was more lukewarm, but that was fine. I was exhausted and the soup hit the spot.

- (2) oxtail soup: I only tried a spoonful but the broth was flavorful, generous portion of the oxtail itself. Tender, fall off the bone goodness was the consensus. Was it worth it? Yea for $10.99-not bad

- chili and rice: this was good, I thought it had too much beans but that's just a personal preference. I don't know what Zippy's is but supposedly that's who makes it(?)

- New York steak: comes with a side of green beans(probably from a can) and mash potatoes with gravy. Cooked medium rare. I didn't try it but bolt other said it was Meh. 

- Won Ton Min: Saimin with pork dumplings-I didn't try it but the friend said the won tons tasted like a ball of ""dough"" nothing special 

- Island short ribs: braised ribs in their homemade house sauce. Omg this was soooooo good! Super tender and flavorful. Served with rice and canned green beans. The mister devoured it.

I opted for the 4 dollar (it may have been cheaper, haha) steak. I HAD to order it, it was so CHEAP. But now i see WHY it's so cheap. Unfortunately, the last few steaks that i've ordered have been from Ruth's Chris, Maestro's, and Donovans. So I HAVE to say (and this shouldn't be surprising) that I was disappointed. I like at least 1/3 of my steak was straight up ligaments. I spent at least 10 minutes chewing one bite. My jaw was hurting after 30 minutes (aka after three bites). So i  ate the veggies (green beans). They tasted like they were microwaved. So then I stuck to my rice. No one can ruin steamed rice. Or can they? (just kidding, the rice was fine).

I feel bad giving a low rating, because shouldn't you expect such CHEAP food to not taste good? Whatever, my food experience just wasn't a good one. Plus, we waited at least 30 minutes in line before we were even seated.

It was like some nasty slab of meat that could not even be cut w a knife. All of the people in our party agreed. We complained to the waiter who then told us we were not the first people to complain that night and that many others complained as well. What did he do? He took the prime rib off our bill and charged us for ""all you can eat salad bar"" that came with the prime rib. Whoop di do!! Prime rib is $9.99, all you can eat salad bar is just a few dollars less.

When I received my meal, I first tried the green beans. I will say this again, nothing is worse than frozen green beans. When you reheat them, they might look like fresh green beans, but they tasted like chewing on a sock. Horrible.

Let me get to the steak. I don't know where these Vegas casinos are getting their NY steaks, whether it's the California, South Point, Station Casinos or whatever.. I know it's all coming from the same damn place. Tough, leathery, and extremely fatty (on the outside of the steak..)

I gave this place 2 stars because they didn't screw up the french fries.

Two words when you go to this place, Oxtail, and Soup. That's all you need to remember. If I would have ordered that I would have given this place the 5 stars it deserves.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,3,2,2,4wvJCMwvBYjjrVz5lLqkVg

The Market Street Cafe welcomes you in ""Denny's style"" dining where a hostess seats you on vinyl or you can belly up to the counter. You pay at the cashier on your way out. 

Late-night dining alone, I chose the counter and took advantage of their after hours menu (which is heavily discounted). I don't remember specific prices just that they were very low. 

I'd always heard about the Hawaiian specialty, Oxtail soup. So I ordered a bowl of that and sat back to see what might come to me. I had visions of a HUGE ox head impaled on porcelain in the middle of my bowl. Perhaps still moving, even looking at me. 

""Where you from?"" Ollie the Ox would ask. 

""Ummmm...Co-Co-Colorado,"" I would answer nervously, looking around to see if anyone noticed me talking to an ox in the bowl. 

""Hmpf,"" he'd reply in a huff. ""Must be nice. I'm from Hawaii but they BUTCHERED me and send me to YOUR FREAKIN' BOWL! All for $5.99! You have penny???""

At that, the ox would lunge across the counter at my throat, and...

Okay so that didn't happen (see photo). Out came a harmless, sizable bowl of stew complete with tasty ox, vegetables, and other spices. It was very good and I'll be back to order another. It comes with a side of rice and fresh ginger, all in all a whole meal - not just a soup.  

It took a while to get my check so I could pay. Meanwhile, another guy got tired of sitting there waiting to order so he left in disgust. Only when I stood up as if I was going to leave did someone come over and present the check to me. 

Okay so what did I expect for a few bucks? Ruths Chris servers? No big deal really. Just be prepared.  It's all good and I recommend giving it a shot if you're ever near the California Hotel & Casino. 

Just watch out for that ox.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,2,1,3,zuiv7G_ShSjeuX1xTgAfIQ

A friend of mine from LA (not even a local here) told me about this oxtail soup. Being a fan of all things soup, I HAD to try it. Luckily this friend was also in town, so I was able to enjoy it with her.


As soon as you get to this place inside the California Hotel, you will have to wait in line. I'm convinced everyone is waiting specifically for the soup. Afterall, this soup has magical healing powers. Ok....maybe not. Well...maybe?

Once you get seated (after 10 mins or so), you order. Don't bother with the menu. Although it looks decent. Go for the soup.

The soup is only served after midnight and is $8.95. Your choice of White or Brown Rice. 

Couple quick notes:

1. Service is good. Waitstaff is attentive and refills your water/diet coke regularly.
2. The food is solid. THe soup had a VERY flavorful broth, with a good amount of oxtail. I ""murdered"" my soup. Nothing was left but empty bones.
3. Soup could've been piping hot. It wasn't cold by all means, but it wasn't ridiculously hot like at most other joints.
4. Although I skipped the menu, I later found out that there are other deals here. Worth checking out. But only after you try the oxtail soup.

So hop to it. Thank me later. But when you do, send me a bowl of oxtail soup. Because this place? It's LEGIT!",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,2,2,4,2raLZ7ixaOg_HVGCRUNymA

We came right around 10:45a. Waited awhile at the hostess stand. Several staff members passing, no one acknowledged us waiting. Finally the hostess shows up and seats us right next to the buffet (many other seats available). So I asked the lady that brings our coffee about the oxtail because I didn't see it on the menu. Unfortunately, I was too late! But I was also starving so I considered the buffet since we sitting so close but of course, it was about to close and having had a look at it, it looked that way. Everything looked like it had been sitting out for a while. Which is acceptable being that they were about to close it. So I decided against the buffet. Our waitress shows up. We ask for a few more minutes. Then she shows up again about 15 mins later. In the meantime, they are clearing the buffet and couldn't be any louder about it. Metal trays sounded like they were being thrown in the cart. Sitting so close, I couldn't even hear my self think. Let alone have a conversation. Me and my bf both ordered the prime rib scramble and a side of bacon. Waitress walks into the kitchen right after taking the order and comes right back out with the side of bacon. Obviously taken from the leftovers of the buffet line. Fine, that's forgivable. What's not forgivable is the horrible prime rib scramble. Absolutely no flavor! I never use salt after the fact but this desperately needed it. And the meat was definitely leftover. But how old, I couldn't tell you. It was gray in color and rubbery. I wouldn't even feed it to a dog! That being said, we cashed out after a few bites. Should've spent that $26 on video poker!",7SDQllMBoiDgsaLcLekq3A,0,0,1,iiOg2aHXGGSYM7M3wRgfuA

For years I've heard about the oxtail soup (served 11pm-9am) and how great it is. Well, it's not. Not even close. Wasn't tender at all. I had to pry at it with my fork to get it off the bone. Heck, I make a better oxtail soup than that! I was pretty bummed since I was really looking forward to it. And not only that, the rice was really dry too. Come on, man. Maybe it was an off night since it was busy but consistency is key, right? 

Yeah I get it, it's late night so most people don't really care about the quality of food they just want something to fill them up. But I'm not most people so...

Points for having an extensive menu and being open late (and early obviously). The Philippine breakfast was good, so there's that. But the service kinda sucks. The wait isn't too long considering how busy it is. But once seated, you have to flag down your server for everything otherwise they won't come back to your table other than to bring your check.

Unfortunately, despite getting seated right away, we weren't attended to right away at our table.  Don't get me wrong.  The server was nice but when one is tired and hungry, niceness can only get so far.  

When she finally made her way to our table, my sister-in-law ordered the infamous oxtail soup (now priced at $9.99), my brother ordered the wonton min, and I customized my omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon, & spam.  The food itself was okay.  Nothing to shout on rooftops about.  My omelette was okay, though the combination of spam and bacon made it super salty towards the end, since there were big clumps of them at the other end of my omelette.  The hash browns were okay.  Didn't taste the wonton min but my brother seemed to like it.  I did taste the infamous oxtail soup.  It comes with a cup of rice which my sister-in-law devoured.  The oxtail is cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone easily.  The broth is pretty good but I suppose that since I am Filipino, I'm accustomed to eating oxtail with a peanut sauce (a dish called Kare-kare).  So although the oxtail and the broth was good separately, together, I was looking for something more.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.

Did I mention that our food arrived and we still had no drinks at our table.  When I flagged the waitress down and asked for water, she only brought one for me.  It wasn't until she noticed the shocked look on my brother's face that she made her way back with water for both my brother and sister-in-law as well.

1829565,2017-11-02,0,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"I've been coming here for years with my family. It's one of those Las Vegas cheap specials that are hard to find anywhere else. 

Three words: PRIME RIB SPECIAL

This prime rib dinner special is $9.99, which is ridiculously cheap for the amount of delicious food you get. It comes with an 8 oz cut (pretty good portion) of prime rib, container of au jus sauce (OBSESSED with this), soup of the day or salad bar, green beans, a side (french fries/rice/mashed potato/baked potato/etc), and cherries jubilee ice cream. Phew that was a mouthful. 

The prime rib can be a hit or miss in terms of dryness. Most of the time it's good. I always, always cover my prime rib with all of the au jus sauce to let it soak (yes I know it's so bad for you, but it's so good). This deal ends at 10 PM I believe so it's not one of those midnight specials.

The service is always average to good. The bussers are always very accommodating. When I go to places for a super cheap dinner special, I don't expect exemplary service anyways. This place has Hawaiian vibes to it which is cool. I've tried the club sandwich and oxtail soup here also. Both are very good. I would love to try their loco moco, but that desire gets overpowered by the prime rib. You have to grab a ticket when you go into the parking garage. If you hand the ticket to the restaurant's cashier while paying for the food they will validate it (thus free parking). I always make it a point to bring my out of town friends/family here.

1841668,2010-05-02,0,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"Market Street is a place I've grown to like.  That's because I've been coming here for so long, that I've pretty much settled on a handful of dishes I order whenever I'm here. Although there are a couple of things I'd still like to try.  Plus, not that I'm a late night eater, but it is open all night, and their prices are good. 

That said, my favorite soup here is not the Ox-Tail Soup everybody raves about, and honestly, I've never tried, but would like to one day.  No, my favorite soup is the Oriental noodle Soup, which is saimen noodles, fish cake and won-ton dumplings.  I probably get this entree three-fourths of the times I'm here.  The noodles are good, the broth is good, the fish cake and dumplings - it's all good, filling, and for a soup, doesn't bloat you up.  This entree is a four and it's my favorite on the menu. 

Other entrees I like here are curry, it's a thick sauce, which is what I like about it.  The spaghetti and chili is also pretty good.  I've never had the burgers, here, though and I'm interested to try. As for the other sandwiches, they are okay.  And the banana split for dessert fills the need if I know I won't be visiting Lappert's upstairs later on.  

I hardly ever order anything that includes rice and or vegetables as the sides beacuse I find myself only eating the main item, but not the sides. The main entrees are okay, but it's the sides that are disappointing.  The two main sides are rice and vegetables.  For a restaurant that has a lot of Hawaiian customers, the rice here can be really disappointing, and the vegetables are also disappointing, too.

They have a breakfast buffet that is a pretty good deal - the selections are pretty limited, but the food is okay and less than six dollars, you can't beat the price.",BmlwF7AX5gTpSXtyNdqpfg,0,0,3,aPShKo9ura9wA_VSNON_XQ

3. Only order the Graveyard Special Ox Tail soup. Order anything else on the side, but ALWAYS GET THE OX TAIL SOUP NO MATTER WHAT. 

Believe me on #3. My husband ignored our group on his first visit, got a french dip sandwich, and spent the rest of time complaining about how disappointing it was.

If you visit at the stroke of midnight, expect a wait, Cinderella. The wait hasn't ever been too long, but if you're drunk or hungry, it will feel it. Now, assuming you order the soup, you won't wait long for food. It comes right out and gives instant satisfaction (AKA warm soup belly). The ox tail has never been anything but fall-off-the-bone tender and in plentiful portions. I've taken leftovers home at least twice because there was so much meat! The broth is great as is, but you can also add the cilantro and grated ginger that come with each order. For sure eat it with the accompanying side of rice.

Couldn't wait to try this place out because everyone kept raving about the ox tail soup. The only thing is, they actually don't offer it until after 11:00 pm. Everyone in my party was disappointed because we went to downtown for that particular reason. 

The place was kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the California Hotel. Because of all the renovations, the entrance is actually blocked by a large tarp. The wait for our large group took a long time, and when we were finally seated we saw at least half of the place empty. 

The staff on the other hand was very helpful and tried to accommodate everyone. 

I ordered the Philippine breakfast which did not disappoint. It came with tocino, rice and eggs. 

I also ordered a side of macaroni salad which tasted really bland. I was excited because it is after all a Hawaiian themed hotel so I figured they would at least have good macaroni salad. 

I will probably come back for the ox tail soup because everyone can't stop talking about it.",jwNAw2CkV9obmNq_u4bbQA,9,7,3,N_ILSx-Cmfc9ccf8y9ATQQ

When we were finally being seated, getting into the booth was an overwhelming fishy smell, the table next to us was eating the butterfish special.   I couldn't even think about what I wanted to order, I knew I wasn't ordering that though,  the smell was so horrendous, the women eating it even commented on how fishy it was. Yuck. 
My husband and I decided on the oriental saimin soup.  We got the kalbi rib appetizer and our kids ordered chicken fingers and the mahi mahi sandwich. 
The only saving grace of this meal was the saimin,  we ALL ate out of the two bowls.  The kalbi ribs were swimming in teriyaki sauce, without the sauce they might have been pretty good, the meat was nice and tender and easy to eat, however the sauce made it undesirable, they came with a little bowl of mac salad and don't know what kind of mayo they use but it left a weird aftertaste. The chicken fingers were your run of the mill pre-frozen fried strips, nothing special and not horrible but he didn't even finish one strip. The vegetables were ice cold as were the fries,  we just hate cold limpy fries. And the mahi sandwich looked good but my son didn't really care for it and I wasn't about to taste test it.  Salad bar came with one of the meals, we loaded a plate with a little of everything and little of everything was taken away. No good. Oh, and we had the chili with rice, the first bowl of rice was covered in oil! Waitress said it was butter, that's still disgusting. She brought us another bowl, better rice but it wasn't good Asian sticky rice. And the chili wasn't good either. 

Seems like we should have ordered oxtail soup by all the reviews but we'll never get to try it now since we won't be back. 

We usually eat upstairs but it's been twenty years since we have eaten at the cafe so I wanted to give it another try.  We are so sticking with the upstairs restaurant from now on.",qcy7HQ8agUyYXm3bTLTnnA,0,0,2,DSDkt0s16S2LoP3GqlHm8A

Portion size was generous filled with three large pieces of ox tail bone in and several loose pieces of meat, scattered carrots, celeries, and mushrooms. The ox tail is super tender, it falls off the bone, does not need to wrestle with them.

I was happy to find Oxtail stew as one of the specials, so I ordered that. My s/o ordered the butterfish plate. Being of the Caucasian persuasian from Texas, I asked her if she knew what butterfish was. Not wanting to seem unlocal, she assured me that she knew what it was. 

So I asked her if she was sure she wanted it with a baked potato. She thought about it for a second and said, "" Maybe I should get the rice."" I told her it might taste better with rice.

The watress assured her that the butterfish was ""ONO"", I was thinking more like ""oh, no"" 

In like less than 5 minutes we get our dinners, the oxtail stew was lukewarm and the meat did not fall off the bone. It tasted ok, but being served lukewarm was a downer.

My s/o takes a bite, looks at the butterfish and tells me, its a little different than what she remembered. I tasted it and told her, tastes like butterfish to me, then she tells me, ""Oh I was thinking moonfish""

Oh, well... because she didn't like her dinner I never got the chance to go back for a late night Oxtail soup run. It'll have to wait till next time.",rBGOrIJtdLqobcBCQZFtqQ,1,0,3,C_Iwqf2ke-bm05lW1BD6uA

Now the bad part, I was there on my last day on the 6st between the hours of 0830=0900 am. The person behind the counter that takes the orders (not the drink servers) had an bad attitude that morning and I think a few days ago as well. I think she needs a break or relocate to a less demanding customer services position. So I figured she was having a bad day whereby we all have them but again when I went to pay my bill at the register, another lady looked like she got runned over or burnt out or even depressed. I asked the lady next to me ""everyone is having a bad day this morning"" and she nodded yes. I think she needs to be relocated to another work site like the kitchen. She have me my change and left irritated. Some workers needs to remember about who pays them and good customer service is a must even if you are having a bad day. I have no ill feeling with women but I do when you expect good service and you don't get it. 
Overall, the food was excellent and affordable but the staff needs some reality check. A simple thank you and/or a smile if you are mute will do it.

From the get go you will notice employees with the Hawaiian uniforms and Hawaiian workers and guests! How ironic being the name of the place is California. Nonetheless still a place that caters to all ethnicities.  It is rumored that liaisons contact Hawaiian travel agency and tourist a package deal to get tourist I stay and visit...which is smart marketing!  Asides from loose slots that gets customers playing a while without losing all their money quick...it is the food and specials that are the perfect perks to reel in the big catch!  They have various places in California hotel...but Market Street Cafe is the main attraction.  

First and foremost it is the oxtail soup that receives the most attention.  It's familiar taste to Asian cultures have a similar taste to Filipino's bulalo soup and other Hawaiian, Korean and what not.  Also, since their special for oxtail soup starts at 11pm it is great for a late night hang over cure as well! Beware tho at peak hours especially for specials...the line gets long. But if you run into it...need not worry....it goes at a fairly steady pace.  The other special they have before 10pm is the Prime Rib! To have it done at medium is at its best! The tender and juicy cut of meat mixed with salivation of hunger melts this hunk of chunk so smoothly!  Anything higher in cooking is fair game...still tender but the taste comes different and more like corned beef....usually places that cook prime rib at this level be a little tougher but still have that prime rib flavor...so again I recommend medium.  With this price coming in at an amazing $9.99 one must be reminded not to forget it comes with an all you can eat salad bar that includes macaroni salad (a crowd favorite especially Hawaiians) and fruits! Plus you get a warm cherry/cinnamon vanilla ice cream sundae like concoction with a cone like wafer on the side.  

You have to remember this place is old, but respectable.  Might not be a place for fine dining but for a casual and deal breaker and wanting it to hit the spot...this is the place!

There usually is a line, even at 2 am!  Heres the trick.. it's served from 11pm - 11 am every day.  So it's all a crap shoot but try going around 3 or 4am the line might be shorter AND it gives the ox tails a few more hours to stew and get softer. Mmm... ox tails...  or even go in the morning before lunch.. 

as a whole the place is okay nothing fancy, don't expect too much.  maybe even 2 stars if it wasn't for the ox tail soup.  Just stick to the plan... don't stray from the path... stick to what works.. The specials... NY Steak, Prime Rib, and Ox Tail soup (sorry i forgot what time the NY steak and Prim Rib specials are)

here is a list of the nightly specials http://static.boydgaming.net/california/media/downloads/MSC_dsi_10_2009_01.pdf

I tried the friday special ""Kalbi and huli huli chicken"" not that great, i have to say... it was definitely not hulu huli chicken... more of a baked teriyaki chicken?  would not get it again..  like i said, stick to the game plan..  although a few things on the list do intrigue me... Sunday, black bean sauce pork riblets, and Monday's Ox tail STEW (11AM-11PM) and i did see butterfish (Gindara or black cod) which i love in Japanese restaurants but I'm still on the fence trying it at this place.  Hey sometimes you gotta step outside the box right?!  So sooner or later i'll give these a shot.

Think i had the Tuesday night special one time too (LauLau and Chicken long rice) i think it was okay..

Pros: Late night ox tail soup, cheep breakfast buffet, Vacations Hawaii coupons if you are from Hawaii and booked thru them. 

Cons: Some of the food is just okay and nothing special, so pick and choose wisely.

Tips:  1.  They offer brown rice on request, don't do it!  I don't know what kind of rice it is but it's really gross!  Maybe uncle Ben's instant brown rice??  
2.  Wait a little longer to get the ox tail soup (don't go at 11 when they start offering it), it will be more tender the later you go, give it time.

After a long night of partying hard during our first night in Vegas, it was time for a night cap meal. 3am and my cousin and I had anti-hangover food in mind. That's were I remembered the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside the California Hotel.

When we arrived around 4am, we were about the fourth ones in line. But, the dining area was packed. Our wait didn't take that long since we were only a party of two. Once we were seated, I searched for the oxtail soup entree. I read the fine print on the menu regarding the oxtail soup special. The menu states that the soup is currently served from 11pm to 9am with a $9.99 price tag. With it being 4am, I was elated to try it out!

Our waiting time for our food was around twenty minutes. It was understandable since the cafe was always packed. When our food arrived, it looked like I had one big piece of oxtail. But that wasn't the case. Under the thick cuts of celery and leaves of cilantro, more pieces were under there. There were also meat pieces embedded at the bottom of the huge bowl! The meat was that tender! This dish was also accompanied with a small plate of white rice. This place knows carb control. As for myself, I would have filled up my bowl with rice until there was no broth left. The broth of the soup had me in shock! It actually tasted like how my Dad makes his oxtail soup, but with different vegetables. Full of flavor and the right kind of saltiness.

Market Street Cafe had my home cooked meal waiting for me. But having my Dad pop out the kitchen, that would have been just too weird!",xxMg8OyUtXFNJ2QXDXF4dQ,12,9,5,LZ-QHn-MVHtfH3ZI116O3g

This is probably one of the only places in Vegas where you see and dine with other Hawaiian locals. As pretty much everyone here has said, their speciality is the oxtail soup ($9.99 or hawaiian coupon plus $3.00) starting at 11 pm. Everytime I eat it, I try to think what ingredients are making that delicious broth. Their prime rib dinner for $9.99 with soup or salad bar and dessert is a steal also. The one negative i would  say is sometimes their eggs have too much of a butter flavor.

When I said take a look at the Menu, it took awhile due to there being lots to choose from! 

We had a table of 6 and we ordered pretty much everything from breakfast to lunch. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and all I have to say is WOW! These were probably the best Eggs Benedict I have tasted in a long long time. I also ordered a short stack of pancakes which were also pretty tasty.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to get anything else because our tummies were QUITE SATISFIED. The soup comes with a bowl of rice, which is the filling part. SO GOOD!

I will go there soon and try the other tasty meals they have! The menu looks bomb! HAWAIIAN FOOD FOR THE WIN! =) But in meantime, if you are looking for a late night grub after the clubs, this has to be it!!

I will leave you with this...

2566360,2013-01-05,0,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"It's crazy but I've been going to Market street café for decades. Literally I remember going here when I went with the family to Vegas as a child. I've eaten here every Vegas trip that I can remember and while the food isn't the best I still look forward going to eat at the breakfast buffet.

Parking:
Unlike most Vegas hotels you actually need to get validation

Atmosphere:
Nothing special here other then the hordes of Hawaii people ready to gamble. Your standard Diner feel

Service:
Since 90% of the customers are most likely staying at the Cal and most likely have food vouchers that come with the Hawaii package then mostly everyone is eating for free. That tends to make waiters work a bit less then what you would expect at a normal restaurant. Watch out because at times there can be long lines & waits of 20+ mins. Do yourself a favor and sit at the counter where you don't have to wait.  Also watch out for shift change times(10:30-11pm) service can really really drag then.

Prices:
Like most restaurants in Vegas the prices are pretty good. Expect to pay about 5-8$ for most meals.  I particularly like going for the breakfast buffet for the best value. Sure you'll find some typical Hawaii food items(Portuguese Sausage!!) but for $6+ you can't beat it. Also be sure to look out for the late night NY steak which can be a good bargain

Food:
So you get what you pay for, nothing is going to ""wow"" in the Market Street Café but you should be more than satisfied if you're staying at the hotel and want to get a bite to eat. If you're not staying at the hotel and maybe you want to get some food that you might find in Hawaii then it's also a great spot. Just be sure to befriend a hotel guest and ask them to spot you some meal coupons.

Conclusion:
The Market Street café has been a staple of Hawaii residents for decades and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Just don't expect  5* food and expect 1* service(unless you stick with the buffet).  If you're in town and want a bit of Aloha go check it out.",9fF_T3pQu3ay1oA7h_VYNA,2,0,3,7FrTZVnA11R_66bwpINQlw

What we come here for?? OXTAIL Soup! Served only from 11pm to 6am, the soup is just the perfect way to end a long night of partying in Vegas. It's a simple beef broth cooked with tender oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts. What makes this dish superb?? Cilantro, ginger bits, and Kikkoman soy sauce. Eat your meat and soup as you would with rice but add the seasonings on top of it. Ooh la la! It makes all the difference! It is served with two small cups of rice on the side but the bowl of soup itself is huge and can be shared by two people. Imagine what great value this was years ago when they were serving it for $5! Now it costs $10..hey, blame it on the economy! Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good deal. 

Oxtail soup is not the only good thing here. They have quite an extensive menu of breakfast options that are of great value, too.

I came here LATE night with the girls while we were in town for a bachelorette party. I say we arrived here around 3:30 am. This place is about 8 minutes off the strip. 
 
When you walk into the casino from the parking lot, This place isnt too hard to find. You just walk straight across the casino and BAM, there it is on the end. Try to hold your breath while walking through the casino because it smells like 100 year old cigarette butts, ashtrays and dusty funk.

Our waitress was attentive, and she took our order pretty quickly. We ordered 3 ox tail soups, one Hawaiian breakfast and I got an extra side of hash browns. What's an after drinking meal without some kind of potatoes?

Our food came quicly and we dug right in. About half way in when I came up for air, I noticed my hash browns had not arrived. I reminded the waitress , and she brought one out right away.  I actually wished I had forgotten it all together because they were not crunchy and were more like mashed potatoes and oil on the inside. 

The oxtail broth was a little on the salty side, but the oxtail itself was fall off the bone delish.

Of course it being 3am, there was a table of young guys staring impolitely at us while we were gnawing on those ox tails. One of them actually had his phone out and appeared to be snapping photos of us. Oh well.",EhMqNhy7u4cl_hHHfuBrpg,1,0,3,LTEwhV55i4VS0OjlhAuUdw

Well, walk towards main street and walk into CALIFORNIA CASINO, and hit this place up is 24/7 open and is very well known for their oxtail soup (never tried it because a tail with white in it just didn't sound too appetizing).

Here you will find a mix of Denny's type of food fused with Hawaiian elements. Being a European from across the sea, I believe that equals unhealthy food, however; from an American perspective it might sound as ''comfort'' food.

The reason why this place didn't earn its full star is simply because the variety of items they have. Sure, they have all night specials that are screamingly cheap. And that's the only reason why I would come:

''Have to stay around Fremont St., being up late (past 12AM) and in need of hot food.''

In they day time I would avoid this place at any time since there are greater places to fill your tummy. If you come at night, make sure you have still some patience since  lines can get very busy and the restaurant is very big and always filled, resulting into long wait times and not-so-special service (more like conveyor belt service!), but that's o.k. for the price of a fast food meal.",1Ul_McORuTug361tWcucrw,0,1,3,5T9YrtV3_eFtksMFxYKpVg

If you're eating from 11:00PM-1:00AM, be prepared to wait in a long line for a table. What is everyone coming for that late? The oxtail soup, of course! It's only served from 11:00PM-9:00AM(?), and people will wait for it! It's especially busy on the nights the Vacation Hawaii groups come in, so watch out for that. The oxtail comes out in droves, and it arrives at your table nice and hot. The meat is so tender, and the broth so flavorful, that you can't help but like it. While it is good, and soup is always great late at night, it's not something I'll always order. If anything, we'll get one bowl and share it between 4 of us, and order something else.

Some other things I like to eat here:  Island Style Shortribs, Philippine Breakfast, and the cheap breakfast buffet. They also have Hawaiian Sun Guava Juice, expensive, but still good!

The real drawback though is the inconsistency in service. When it's busy, I'll get my food quickly. When it's slow, I'm in the restaurant for over an hour. Sometimes it's ok, and the waiters won't forget anything. Sometimes they'll forget about us altogether. It's because of this that I dropped them to 3 stars.

She brought out my saimin and it had obviously been sitting there a while.  The broth had cooled down and the noodles were soggy.
""Sorry.  Sorry, sir.  We'll bring out your plate soon.""  It was a good 10 minutes or so before he got it.  At least his food was freshly made.  :-/

1.  Prime Rib Special.  If I'm there after 4, there's no question about what I'll eat.  Tasty prime rib, soup or salad, baked potato, green beans almondine and cherries jubilee for dessert.  All for $7.99.  It used to be $6.99, but the price went up about a year ago.  Still, best prime rib special in town.  In my dozens of times eating the prime rib, I can only remember being disappointed once.  Even then, it was good and I didn't feel ripped off by paying eight bucks for it.

2.  Things made with fish.  If I'm not there in the evening, I stick to things made out of fish.  The fish and chips, butterfish, etc are all pretty good.  I've tasted catfish from friends' plates - also good. 

Lunch and dinner specials all come with the salad bar or soup.  The salad bar has declined in quality a little bit, but I think that's how they kept the prices low when food costs started rising.  There used to be sushi and spinach and a few other things, but now those things are gone.  It's pretty basic, but has more than enough to keep you happy - especially since it's not an additional charge with a daily special.

A few people have mentioned the service and I think it's really hit and miss.  Sometimes it's awesome and your glass is refilled before it hits the table.  Other times it can be tough to get someone to come over.  The number of customers fluctuates so drastically that I think they  have a hard time knowing how many servers to keep on the floor.

Its such an oddity to find, but a welcome comfort to know that this place (and the California Hotel) is just a short ride over from the Strip, in case one gets tired of mega-fusion-hybrid cuisine.

The restaurant and amenities themselves are run-of-the-mill Old Downtown Vegas... vinyl, faux-brass, fake dark-lacquered-wood tables, awful carpeting, etcetera etcetera.  But spacious for the most part, and accommodating to bigger groups... we ended up having a party of 8, though I saw a few parties in the restaurant numbering in the dozens.

The service is top notch here!  From the smiling older Japanese auntie who greeted-and-seated us, to the young howsit-brah who served us, to the big-as-a-house but cheery and laid-back Polynesian securing the front... it was very homey and unpretentious...

The food is decent, for diner renditions of generally home-cooked Hawaiian-Asian fare.  The oxtail soup is plentiful with meat, tender from cooking all day long in the fairly flavorful broth.  I personally expected/would have liked a slightly tangier broth.  The Portuguese Sausage and Eggs over rice looked delicious in its simplicity; a breakfast plate that brings me back to my youth.

This really hits the spot after a night of heavy drinking. Las Vegas has a lot of options for late night dining but this is a great place to end your night. It's located only two blocks from the Fremont experience in the Californian casino. 

The line can be long sometimes at this time of night, especially if there's an event going on in the downtown area. The trick is to designate someone to wait while the rest of your party gambles. 

The service is average for a sit down cafe. As for the food, the special comes with a big bowl of oxtail and a scoop of rice.  The oxtail was juicy and tender, and the rice compliments it perfectly. I recommend ordering an extra scoop of rice to soak up all the broth.

I keep coming back for the oxtail soup. They only serve it from 11pm onwards, but once they're out- that's it. $10.99 you really can't go wrong. Too bad you cannot to-go it. But it's worth the wait and the drive to get their oxtail soup. 

They serve really good breakfast as well. My husband had this chili omelette from Hawaii, and said that the chili omelette they serve here tastes the same!!

I'm Filipino and they have a good amount of Filipino employees that will definitely make sure that you are well taken cared of. 

All the employees are so nice and friendly. 

My last visit, I left my phone on the table, covered with napkins I used. And they were very honest to turn it in to the security. What's crazy is that my ID and debit card are in the case of my phone. I was so worried that I left my phone. There's still good people in this world.

The salad bar definitely caters to their Hawaiian and Asian customers which is very unique. The baked potato was nicely done and came with butter and sour cream.  The green beans were mush and inedible but my expectations were pretty low because this is typical for this caliber of restaurant.

The biggest disappointment was the prime rib.  I got mine medium rare and my husband got his done rare.  They were cooked to the correct temp; however, the meat was devoid of flavor and was very fatty.  The beef rind was bland and I actually needed to add salt and horseradish to make it edible.  

If you want big portions for a great price then definitely eat the prime rib dinner here.  However, if you want better flavor with less food at the same price I recommend Magnolia's at the Four Queens.

The food menu is extensive and has a lot of Hawaii-local foods. They have daily specials that change from day to day. And it is basically great for every type of meal! We came for dinner - so I decided to try their Friday Special, Oxtail Stew. If you are a fan of beef stew, definitely try their Oxtail Stew!

Sarah M.'s Ate Annie recommended we go to this place for a late dinner, and I'm sure glad we went here.  That is some beefy soup.  Good as is with their two scoops of rice, this is hangover medication in soup form.

I woke up this morning in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Got in line for Market Street Cafe, and after what was almost half an hour, got seated.  The ox tail soup was definitely a major highlight of the day.

Cilantro? Minced ginger? Chili paste? Aloha Shoyu? None of that is necessary to add to my ox tail soup.  It totally hit the spot as is.

Market Street Cafe as a whole is basically those 24-hour usual cafes found in any casino.  You would totally overlook this if you didn't take the time and noticed their graveyard specials.  And the best special?  Ox tail soup.

After getting settled at our hotel, we got back in the car and headed to downtown (so much cooler than the Strip).  We wandered through Main Street Station and then over to the California.  Somewhere along the way, we saw a sign for the Market Street Cafe, offering a turkey dinner for $10.99!  ""Score!,"" said we.   We could not think of a more perfect option for Thanksgiving in Vegas.

Despite the maze outside that suggests you must sometimes wait in line for a table, we were seated immediately at a comfy table towards the rear of the restaurant.  

Service was quick and friendly.  We did not have to wait long for our turkey dinners and, frankly, they were pretty dang good.  All of the sides were tasty, but I was completely enraptured by the sweet potatoes, which is something I never cook on my own.

At the end of our main course, we were (pleasantly) surprised to learn our dinners included a slice of pie.  They were out of pumpkin pie, but I was able to get a slice of the custard pie, which I probably would have ordered anyhow.  It was not too sweet, which is just the way I like it, and quite yummy.

One odd thing:  The menu states ""cocktails are available 24 hours a day,"" and I ordered a glass of red wine ($3.50!) to have with my meal.  The waiter told me it must be served by the cocktail waitress and would be a separate check.  ""No problem,"" said I.  And, I waited, and waited, and waited some more for my drink.  The waitress finally appeared, just as I was getting close to finishing my meal.  She apologized and said someone else had called in sick and said she was the only waitress on duty that night and was being run ragged.  ""No problem,"" said I, again.  The wine was served in a plastic cup, and, this being Vegas, I was able to take it to go.

In addition to the decent food, good service, comfortable setting,  and beyond decent prices, we ended up having a nice chat with the folks sitting at the table next to ours.

HAWAIIAN SPECIALS
Of course the reason you go to the Cal is for the Hawaiian specials and the Oxtail Soup is no exception.  The Oxtail Soup is good.  And if you're around Downtown, it's probably worth stopping in and trying. 
-- Is it anything you can't get at home? Hell no.  
-- Is it cheap?  Hell yeah.
Note:  Oxtail Soup is only available as a late night special so you'll have to wait until 11PM for it.  The line gets a little long so be sure to bring something to do while you wait.

DON'T EXPECT MUCH (i.e. MY LAU LAU STORY)
In addition to the oxtail soup, once I decided to push it and get a lau lau.  And naturally the taro & pork were dry & there was no butterfish, so being that I didn't have any poi, this didn't go down easy.
...Nowadays, I usually just get a side of portugeuse sausage & rice.  Why?  Just because.  I think they serve Redondo's but I can't be sure.  It's not sweet so it's not Purity.

CHEAP GRINDS
In any case, if you're used to the strip, this is going to be the cheapest meal of the week for you.  2 people can eat for $12 and change.

GOOD BLACKJACK
They also have $10 3-2 Double Deck Blackjack here with typical rules (Hit on S17, Double Down any 2 cards, split aces up to 4) which you'll want to stick around to play for a while.

CONCLUSION
It's a good place to visit if you're from the islands or your just happen to be downtown around 11PM.  You can hit the tables and eat some local food at the same time.  Not bad.

3-stars.

The line was ridiculously long for the time of night it was, but it made sense since they only serve OX Tail from 11pm-9am. Anyway the host sat us at the very first booth right by the line and closet to the cashier. We think it was a trap to make us have a bad experience....seriously we waited for 20 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge our existence, she was nice. But nice didn't get us our food before people that got there at the same time as us Had already ordered, eaten and left.... We finally ordered, got our food maybe another 15 minutes after. At this point were just hungry, she then says "" I have a big party back there (I'm guessing the main dining area)  so it's okay if I don't come back"" I was confused at first and when she left I turned to my boyfriend and asked if she really just said that? That was a little much for me, I'm all about service and although she was nice, I still wanted to walk out. She was totally serious too, she walk by one time very quickly and said are you good and walked a way again. She never came back, in fact my boyfriend had to get up after waiting for the check for a good 15 more minutes and find her to get the bill.... Really???? Ugh! What a night ruiner. Anyway moral of the story, don't sit in the booths in front of the restaurant unless you want to be stuck in limbo for a good portion of your night.

In a group of 12 people, there were only 2 people in our group who FAILED and ordered non-Oxtail.  Why would you eat anything else?

I've been about a dozen times and have tasted the other foods and am never impressed.  It's either Oxtail or nothing.

My party and I rolled in hungover and hungry around 9AM. By that time, the last call for ox tail soup had already been heralded and so we were SOL.

I ended up  ordering the Combination Siamin: The saimin was good. The broth wasn't too salty, there were a lot of goodies in it including kamaboko, char-siu, spinach, and some other stuff I can't remember. I couldn't finish the broth but I just about finished all the noodles. The waitress was nice enough to bring me some chili (sambal) sauce so I could make it spicy to my liking. 

My bf and his friends ordered the breakfast buffet, which was a deal at $6.25 and the buffet included: corned beef hash (the canned variety), bacon, biscuits and gravy (good!), eggs, sausage, french toast, and a good assortment of other breakfast items including fresh fruit.

This is a great place if you are looking to spend under $10 for breakfast buffet, OR, if you are really drunk in the middle of the night and just need some soup (which is always the case with me!). I realized this is the best place to eat anytime in DTLV for cheap since they are open 24/7.",NbJ6_D4pmNbR-Xi5gjSY1Q,3,2,4,2HVpI3rOSpckMdbmGvARDw

Food: The food they offer here is a mix of American and Hawaiian food, with emphasis on Hawaiian food. There's a few filipino dishes I recognize, but for the most part it's considered a special. Of course, I have to mention the Oxtail Soup, a special that only runs from 11pm-9am in the morning. So if you're a late night owl, this is definitely the dish for you! It's their most popular dish. Although in my opinion, it's a little on the pricey side, it's still a good comfort dish. I've tried the Corned Beef Hash, Steak and Eggs, and Philippine Breakfast (Tocino and Eggs with Rice, my personal favorite). They're all pretty solid diner foods which you can't go wrong with, especially if you like breakfast food (again, my favorite meal). 

Environment/Ambiance: It's located in the California Hotel and Casino. Older looking diner, it doesn't really scream Hawaiian theme. Kinda dark and dreary especially at night, but always busy and full of patrons. 

Service: Service is pretty quick...once you're seated. Sometimes it takes forever to be seated but that's just an indication of how popular this place is. For the most part, our servers have been pretty welcoming, polite, and friendly. We've had maybe one bad apple that we've had the pleasure of being waited on by. 

Tips: Try the Oxtail soup! And if you get the Philippine Breakfast, pour the fried garlic on EVERYTHING! You're welcome.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,3,2,4,SDQcgG-unyaTFfNJ9nS64Q

It's a tradition that my family and I come here on Tuesday mornings for their yummy breakfast buffet. Why Tuesday? Because coming to Vegas Columbus day week early Monday morning has been a tradition for us for the past few years. On Tuesday, the boys hit up the golf course while the ladies hit up downtown Vegas for good food and fun slots!

Breakfast buffet is under $10 a person and offers a variety of stuff to choose from: Ham, sausage, eggs, rice, bacon, biscuits, gravy, hash browns, fruits, corned beef hash, oj and coffee...oh my! One plate and you're stuffed (unless you're like me and must have two plates!). There is usually a wait in the morning but it goes by pretty fast. The food is good for being under $10. It's not to die for and not the best or gourmet type but it's good. 

I typically waddle out of here and waddle my way to the bar for a bloody mary...then I waddle my way to a slot machine and stay put for about an hour. That's when you know you're in food coma!

So, after a long night of dancing at Tao, a bunch of us headed here for the famous oxtail soup!

There was a long ass line and it was 4 am. I think we waited about 30-40 minutes. I was tired and cranky already, so wasn't too happy for the wait.

But, when we sat down and ordered, the food came within 10 minutes. 

It was so good! I loved the oxtail, perfectly cooked and huge, seasoned well and had good meat and some fat on it. There were about 6 oxtails per soup, but I was only able to finish 3 1/2 tails. I loved the minced ginger and cilantro on the side. It gave the soup a nice kick. 

Sigh.. I wish I could have some now. $8 for a bowl of oxtail goodness!

It's like having your grandmother's homemade cooking right in the heart of downtown Las Vegas. 

The service is a little bit rough though. It's like dealing with the soup nazi from Seinfeld. You don't know what you want? Okay...we'll move on and good luck trying to get the server's attention again. Ever. Call me crazy, but I think that's what makes this place enjoyable and is fine by me.  A piece of advice: get well acquainted with the menu while you wait in the ridiculously long line (because their oxtail soups draws a crowd.) Once you get seated and pleasantries are exchanged, you quickly tell the server that you want the soup (because why wouldn't you order the soup...that's why you're here) and whatever it is that you want and that's it. They'll come with the soup and whatever else you ordered pretty as you please and the servers will check on you exactly two more times after that. Once for some refilling and the next for the check. 

Come here and come often. This is one of the best places to have oxtail soup. You won't be disappointed.

As good as Mama made, maybe better?

Market Street Café is located inside one of the smaller, older casinos downtown, The California Hotel.  We went on a rainy Monday night after a show, and there was absolutely no line to contend with. I consider our timing lucky after reading all the reviews about the wait.

The bowl is a deep, ~ 8"" bowl, filled with lots of meaty, fall off the bone oxtail and an exceptional tasting beef broth.  It also had carrots and celery.  I don't know if the veggies are always this way, but ours were slightly undercooked, still crunchy.  Just the way I love it.  You are also given a bowl of steamed white rice, a small cup of cilantro and even smaller ""pill"" cup filled with pulverized fresh ginger.  Sink your teeth into those bones, then slurp away!

If I had any complaints, it would be.... I couldn't finish it.  Ended up bringing half of it home with us.  And.....our dogs suddenly forgave our being away for 3 days, they were in hog heaven with the bones.  And the leftovers were just as good as the first time around.

Sure, it's been a while but can't forget how delicious this stuff was. 

I participated in the Color Run over the weekend and went to Market Street Cafe in the California Hotel by the recommendation of a friend. Located on the first floor, this place is easy to find. The restaurant is really big with ample seating. 

Those in my group were craving breakfast food. One ordered steak and eggs, the other ordered a breakfast special. It was your typical breakfast, nothing extraordinary. But what was awesome were the prices! They also have daily specials, which I opted to get. I ordered the Island Short Ribs for $7.95. It's a large serving of braised short ribs in their absolutely delicious sauce. Fell right off the bone and not overly sweet. A side of veggies, brown rice and macaroni salad also came with the dish. I'm picky about my macaroni salad, but Market Street Cafe does an amazing job to get the macaroni salad just right.

I'm fortunate to live in downtown Fremont where there is a casino hotel that caters to the Hawaiian community, The Californian.

Inside there's a restaurant I go to have breakfast before I go to work.

The Market street cafe has many local Hawaiian offerings, the Oxtail soup being the signature star of their menu offerings. [Note: this oxtail soup is offered after midnight through until 9am, perfect of your coming in from a night of partying in Las Vegas, sober up with this amazing soup!]

The menu has many delicious choices to choose from and the prices are amazingly low.

Because I'm usually in a hurry, I opt for the breakfast buffet. It's just below $7.00 and your choices are awesome!

Eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, corned beef and hash, biscuits, gravy, cheese blintz, French toast sticks, fruit, cottage cheese, pastries, etc.

If I go on, I might get hungry again...lol

Main Street Cafe offers lots to choose from, a variety of breakfast dishes, comfort foods, your usual eggs and pancakes, steaks, toast, and they even have filipino breakfast, say whaaattt. They have late night/early morning specials (the ox-tail soup which everyone loves), which cannot be ordered to-go, and some of them get sold out so you have to wait until the next day to try again.  

We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and I'm pretty sure we could have eaten here every single day, if we wanted to, because there is such a vast selection of many different items to choose from without getting tired of eating the same thing. The breakfast buffet is delicious and reminiscent of a breakfast buffet at your typical Waikiki boutique hotel. Soft scrambled eggs, portugese sausage, white steamed rice, bacon, fruit, biscuits and gravy, and I love that their beverage choices include pineapple juice (although it is the teeny can that I can drink and finish in 2.5 seconds and makes me feel awkward when asking for another one... and another.. and another). 

Plus everything on the menu is soooo affordable. Even the breakfast buffet. Any buffet below $9 automatically gets 5 stars because I love affordable food PLUS the food is actually good, which is a bonus at cheap buffet's, lol. 

Love the food, love the affordability, love the casualness, love the look-and-feel of this place. Minus 1 star because their limited-time specials get sold out and I didn't get any ox-tail soup last time I visited. *sad face*",F7jcJIwAspQZ9VLrabZDiw,1,1,4,12v1oFRFu9Yue41CzHkgow

The coupons covered the meals, so I decided to look over the menu.  The waitress suggested the island short rib and I was a bit apprehensive because I'm not a big meat eater, but when on vacation, all rules go out the window.  

I'm glad i took her recommendation because the meat was soooo soft. It fell right off the bone and the sauce made it even better.  It came with veggies and I asked for brown rice.  The Mac salad was okay, but who cares because the short rib was thick and juicy.  I felt a little guilty eating this, but it was all worth it.

We usually only order two things from the Market Street Cafe... their oxtail soup for and their Zippy's chili spaghetti.  

Of all the oxtail soups that I have tried, this one is my favorite.  The meat falls off the bones and the broth is flavorful but not too salty.  The soup comes with some large pieces of oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts.  It also comes served with ginger, parsley, and a side of rice.  I like to mix the ginger and parsley with soy sauce to dip my chunks of oxtail in.  The price has been rising slowly over the years.  It is now $9.99.  Still worth it in my opinion.  I order this 99% of the time.

We also like their Zippy's chili spaghetti.  It is the same chili that is served in the Hawaii chain, Zippy's.  The only thing is that they give you tons more here than they do at Zippy's!  What a steal for about $6.  The actual entree is called Chili rice but you can substitute for spaghetti.

3445687,2017-02-19,1,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"I had Market Street Cafe's graveyard specials bookmarked for quite some time, and now that I am on a night float rotation this month, I decided to check it out during my weekend off time. 

Market Street Cafe is located inside the California Hotel & Casino in downtown Las Vegas. There is an attached parking garage and I think you can get parking validation by dining at Market Street Cafe, but I found a street parking spot closer to the hotel entrance. Street parking is free after 10PM, though no street parking allowed between 3-5AM or so due to street cleaning.

The graveyard specials are available from 11PM-9AM (or was it 7AM?). I came to try the famous oxtail soup that is ONLY available during this time. It's clearly a very popular dish at night, as I saw several other customers order it, and they have a bunch of spoons and ginger/cilantro sides prepared for this dish.

Before getting to the food, there was a considerable line out the entrance when I arrived around midnight. The line moves quickly, though they seat based on availability, so a lot of smaller groups got seated before larger groups. Since I was dining alone, when the hostess came through the line to take down party sizes, she recommended that I sit at the counter. I was therefore extremely lucky and bypassed the entire line and got seated at the counter immediately. =)

The full menu is available at the bar/counter. Service was mediocre, but there were two servers and my water got refilled. The interior is basic but clean, very much like your typical diner.

I ordered the oxtail soup (comes with a serving of white rice), as well as banana fritters, both off of the graveyard specials menu. The oxtail soup was very tasty (though a little salty at the end when drinking the final bits of broth), and came with a generous amount of oxtail. The bowl is quite large, and with the side of rice, it is definitely a filling meal. My waitress actually forgot about my banana fritters and gave me a check with just oxtail soup, so I had to remind her about the fritters. The fritters ended up not being all that special, and I would argue that they are not a necessary order. The dish here was basically crushed nut-filled fried wontons served with sliced bananas, caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with whipped cream. While the banana fritters were tasty enough, it wasn't really what I was expecting after Googling banana fritters. 

Overall, I think the regular Hawaiian food menu is probably great all day, though the graveyard specials are nice too. I have made better oxtail soup myself in a slow cooker, but the oxtail soup at Market Street Cafe is not bad at all for $10.99 + tax.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,2,1,4,rw4th1Z3JFrU2fqy3JCCmA

3480159,2017-02-22,4,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"I rarely find an oxtail dish that I don't like, which leads me to think that when you hear ""best oxtail"" you are in for a treat. Lets hold our oxes just a minute and discuss the cuisine of these dishes. Jamaican, Vietnamese, Filipino, African, Hawaiian. Not a single one similar to any other. Not a single reviewer even mentions the varieties.

The oxtail served here is a late-night graveyard dish usually on Fridays after 11pm. That is when I came. It makes no mention of style, just accoutrements. When you look at the menu being decidedly Hawaiian you sort of assume that if it's not specific this is the default and it is. Compare it to the curry styles or the African style or Filipino kare kare and this doesn't hold a candle to them. This is not bad, in any way, but it is it's own thing. A latenight broth. It's clean, on the clear side, salted, but not rich in umami which makes me think it's made separate from the likely parboiling of the oxtail. Carrots, celery were floating, but I didn't get the usual mirepoix most beef stocks start with, lacked depth. Sure the cilantro and ginger helped, but they were merely aromatics and not flavor enhancers. The tail chunks were huge, meaty, fall off the bone, no gaminess. It's messy, but to clean them you gotta get in there. Rather than do rice I saw someone order a side of ramen, that would be better if there was more soup, I'll try that next time. 

Philippine Breakfast was blah, tocino only, no longanisa, sunny side egg was good, rice was good, but not GFR. No tomatoes or basically anything else. The bacon side was huge, the sausage side was portugese and not Filipino or American, though it was clean profile. 

Steak & Eggs were hit and miss, 2 medium rare's and 1 was cooked correctly, the other medium well-well. That got sent back. I understand it's harder with these thin steaks, but we know it can be done. Even the correctly cooked one was a little tough. Eggs were good. Sour dough bread was ok, even better with a heavy spread of butter. Their latenight side offerings are limited and they don't readily substitute/accommodate. 

Service is ok, they only serve alcohol from a casino server so that takes time. The service is usually packed at night and they are a little understaffed making refills an issue. Décor is meh, seats are not uncomfortable, smaller party sizes generally get seated faster or try the counter. Lots of people get theirs to go.

It's an ok spot with some good dishes, but certainly not the best Hawaiian food, Oxtail or service around. I'll give them the latenight and large menu, but if your most famous dish is that inconsistent and mediocre I gotta be just real close, late and real hungry. I'd recommend to anyone wanted lots of oxtail meat in a broth, not a stew that isn't Jamaican, African, Filipino or Vietnamese because it's good Hawaiian oxtail, but wouldn't last in richer seas. If you want Hawaiian food and it's before 3pm you are better off going to Aloha Kitchen off Decatur.",864nL0po2ldN8TPgbSiwOQ,7,7,3,eQyaG9ulsSLd5wrQWnK63A

Their main draw seems to be the Ox Tail soup, which is served in the middle of the night. I have not been able to try it because I've come multiple times around 11pm on various days and the line is always looping around and packed. It is only served from 11pm to 7am. I usually get the loco moco (rice, spam, egg, gravy) and Hawaiian Sun guava drink. Definitely as unhealthy as you can get, but works for nursing or preventing a hangover. The food here is not gourmet or even close by any means, but I have yet to get food poisoning. I did get the runs one time from the greasy breakfast buffet. If you're sensitive to oil content I'd recommend avoiding it. Someone also pointed out that this place seems to not serve much fresh produce. The side veggies that come with the specials look like they're from a frozen bag or a can. The fruit in the breakfast buffet are definitely canned. Except for the bananas. 

Service is can be slow because they're always busy and most of the people working here are probably from Hawaii. If you've been to Hawaii you'll know what I mean. If it is just you go sit at the counter. You can just walk up there without waiting and other from the person standing back there instead of waiting forever for a table.

The oxtail soup, though cheap is over-hyped. Yes, the meat is tender...yes it's comforting after the club, but the flavor is just ok.

I came one morning and ordered a bento. As I ordered, the cook told me that the wait might be 20 mins as he had to take care of a large order before mines; I was fine with it as I had some time to kill. 
As I waited, a seriously line of old Asian ladies came in behind me. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to stay in my spot in line or move forward and pay.
After it seemed like the large order prior to mines was done, the cook looked at me and I said, ""do I stay here and wait for my order or move forward and pay?"" He said, ""oh, you didn't move up in line?"" I said, ""no because I wasn't sure...it was my first time here..."" 
He motioned me towards the cashier and asked if I wanted a drink. I said, ""yes, a pepsi!"" 
He came to the front with my bento and pepsi in hand. I asked him how much it was and it said it was ""on the house!"" 
WOW!!!! That was really nice of him. I gave him whatever tip/dollar bills I had. 

Other than the service, my bento was ONO. Chicken katsu and spam :) the teri beef was more like teriyaki steak...not the kind of thinly sliced teri beef I'm used to, to which I normally don't care for anyways. And in this bento, their teri beef was my favorite part of the dish.

Luckily by then there were plenty of tables open ( I heard this place gets packed around 2am).   Walking through the casino, I didn't expect much from this place.  The casino itself is old, smelly, rundown and empty.  

Food:  I ordered the ox-tail soup with no greens and extra ginger on the side.  It comes with a bowl of rice.  Friend got the Hawaiian breakfast.  As soon as I tasted the ox tail soup I was in heaven.  It was perfectly flavored and the meat was so tender.  They actually give you a huge portion of meat!!  Us ladies just dug right in.  Now I know what all the hype is about.  The soup is deeeeelicious!!!  5-stars!!  I tried a bit of my friends Hawaiian breakfast and it was also really good.  The meat was not overly salted.  

Service:  It was average.   The waitress forgot my friends order of hasbrowns but once we brought it to her attention she brought it out right away.   I'm not going to complain too much seeing as they must be tired working those late hours.

Ambiance: it's like an asian Denny's.  Also, I was very disgruntled with some of the people sitting near us.  A table full of immature, gross, uncivilized guys.  Didn't their mothers teach them not to be a D-bag to ladies?  I don't appreciate them secretly snapping pictures of us and staring.  It's rude.

Their oxtail soup is a great midnight treat, and you can't go wrong with a new york teak that is four dollars.

I eat here every time i come to Las Vegas, no matter where i stay.  I love being around locals (people from Hawaii) and enjoying good food.  The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the service isn't wonderful.  Then again it depends, any given day you could get good or bad service.

My boyfriend ordered their $10 country fried chicken steak with mashed potatoes and a corn with the salad bar (no dessert). First of all, the salad bar was so delicious! It was almost like Souplantation, but actually better! Their macaroni salad and imitation crab salad was very Hawaiian and delicious. They even had a broccoli dish where it literally tasted like the Joan's broccoli at Souplantation. I definitely had my full at the salad bar, but then the actual main course came. 

The prime rib with juice and green beans were absolutely amazing. The medium rare was perfect for me and the green beans were definitely buttered up or something because I couldn't stop eating them.

Here's a quick breakdown:
Restaurant ambience- similar to a Cocos or Dennys, you will hear your table neighbor's conversation and visa versa
Service- nice but hurried and infrequent. Thats mainly because the place is usually packed
Prime Rib- pretty good for casino special prime rib (much different from the steakhouse variety). My recommendation is if you want medium rare ask for rare, want medium ask for medium rare, ect. I learned the hard way by asking for medium well a couple times and I got what most outside of the caveman era would consider well done. 
Salad bar- at its best average at its worst,  umm lets just say cousin Eddie from Vegas Vacation migh
t consider it to cross contaminated to dine from. 
Cherries Jubilee- this comes with special. Its a large scoop of vanilla with heated cherries on the bottom and whipped cream. A really nice addition to the special and though I'm not a big dessert person I do enjoy this little bonus. 
In summary if you want a meal that is going to be a great value and get you full in a no frills environment then MSC hits the spot. Also I assume the Oxtail is great because every time I'm there half the place is chin deep in that stuff",bW2fmK-FnGDvAVQo-PH1Nw,1,0,3,CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ

FOOD:
Oxtail Soup of course! A type of comfort food for me that pleases the taste buds and soothes the stomach. This dish is so popular here that the servers usually ask how many your table is ordering before they ask if you want anything else. 
They have a pretty large menu that includes your typical diner food but also has a section that includes Hawaiian and Filipino dishes. Aside from the Oxtail Soup, everything else I've tried here has been pretty mediocre. I've tried the Steak & Eggs, Tocino & Eggs, Prime Rib, and Corned Beef Hash. All these dishes are nothing special and a little overpriced for what you're getting. 

AMBIANCE:
Good ole' old-school Vegas casino diner.. the only thing missing is the Keno screens. You'll find a lot of Hawaiian people taking breaks from gambling.. usually a quiet buzz from these zombies needing to refuel. 

SERVICE:
Pretty quick service, you're usually right in & out of there. A lot of times you'll run into a long line to get in but it usually goes by fast. The servers are always very friendly.. no matter how late into the night it is, they never lack politeness.

We arrived around 10 PM tonight, and met ""Maria"" our hostess.  Man....she must of been having a bad day because she did not smile once when she greeted us, and seemed like she didn't want to be at work.  Not a good first impression for customers.  

Well we finally get seated and the first thing she ask me is ""Are you ordering the prime rib?  If you are you only have a few minutes.""  I told her I think I'm gonna get the oxtail soup.  She tells me ""if you are gonna order the soup you have to go outside and wait back in line until 11p.""  I told her no that's fine, I'll order something else.  

She storms off, and proceeds to mumble something to her fellow coworker. While waiting for our waiter...she keeps staring me down like I did something wrong.  Again as she walks by my table she tells the waiter that I have to go back outside if I am ordering the soup.  I'm thinking in my head...wow what did I do to piss her off. I've been nothing but polite to her and the rest of the staff.


Well we finally get our food and guess what...we find a black hair in my son's wonton soup.  At this point I am furious because of all the smart remarks she told us, and the digusting hair in our soup.  Fortunately the waiter did not charge us for the soup and one of the other entrees.  

So unfortunately I did not get to try the oxtail soup, and have given 1 star for the rude service.  I did file a complaint with the supervisor who was polite and had me write a statement, as ""Maria"" has been a problem before.  

Maybe next time I'll come back to try the oxtail soup when Maria no longer works there.  By the way I have a weird feeling Maria put the black hair in our food but have no way of knowing.

Walked in around 1130 and was still able to order it so don't be discouraged! The wait for parties 2+ seemed a bit longer since we were led to a table right away. 

Service was pretty mediocre, it took 10 minutes before someone even greeted us and another 5 just to order. Also if you're used to drinking fresh water in Hawaii I beg of you not to drink the water here!!! I thought people were over exaggerating when they said it tasted like pool water but seriously... it 1000% does, yuck. My throat still feels nasty.

The oxtail soup had a massive amount of tender, fatty oxtail compared to Hawaii where it's so expensive and you only get a few pieces. The soup was average and the veggies weren't cooked cooked long enough, bummer for all you mushy veggie lovers like myself! The cost definitely outweighs all the cons - only $10 for this huge bowl of awesomeness.  Perfect dish to regain energy and warmth :)

All in all its a great bang for your buck, not sure if I'll I'll be coming back since there's so many other unique restaurants to try in Vegas.

A solid choice for local/Hawaiian food that makes me feel right at home. For those not in the know, the California Hotel or 'the Cal' is a hot zone for people from Hawaii when they visit Hawaii. It's the laws of Hawaiian physics. We all flock here for some reason. Either the cheap food, the  low rolling gambling or just being around other people from Hawaii has everyone coming back for more. 

Ahh yes, back to those fond memories. After a night of drinking, gambling and good ole Vegas debauchery in downtown, stumbling into Market Street Cafe at 1am and saying those two magical words, 'oxtail soup,' is a blessing. The order comes with a side of rice as well. The soup is delightful and the meat (if you can get it off the bones) is tender. Adding ginger and cilantro to the soup give it even more flavor!

Besides the oxtail soup, there are many local favorites on their very extensive menu. One of the better deals for dinner is their prime rib + unlimited salad bar + dessert for only $9.99. It's quite a steal and the prime rib is decent. There are daily specials that are written on the board out by the cashier. 

Depending on the day and time of year, the line for this joint can be pretty long but hang in there. It moves pretty quickly and we're always seated in no time.",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,11,9,4,wEdRuW3cX7RVmTRE-D_qTw

We meet here in the morning every day of our vacation and make our daily plans, talk about our wins from the night before, and discuss family happenings (such as new babies, upcoming weddings, and the old days when my grandparents were alive).

Because this restaurant is open 24/7, sometimes there are long lines while it's empty at other times. It's all timing. ..

Oxtail soup plus $3
Breakfast buffet with oatmeal (ask for the oatmeal)
Prime rib dinner with salad bar
Miso butterfish plus $2
The Daily Specials like the Braised Short ribs and Kalua pig and Cabbage

3863617,2017-10-14,0,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"There is only one thing to drool over this restaurant. THE OXTAIL SOUP.

Let me give you a little bit of a background as to why this soup is phenomenal to Filipinos. In Manila, after a good night out with friends, people do love to eat and what better way to cap the night (or day) is to have good bowl of soup. Bulalo Soup in particular. And preferrably in Tagaytay (a 2-hour drive from the metro). Bulalo Soup is very similar to the Oxtail Soup. But instead of the oxtail, they use beef bone marrow. And this is very nostalgic to Filipinos. So the semblance of the oxtail soup somewhat sends the palate close to home and tugs the heart. 

When dining into this restaurant be mindful of the time you are visiting. Apparently, the soup is not on the menu 24/7. It may either be in a Friday special or served pass 11:00 PM only. Me and my friends came in at 10pm. They are not allowed to serve it just yet so we had to wait a while longer. We ordered other dishes in the menu and were definitely a surprise because it is actually good. I tried the fried Saimin and the Lau lau and it was very tasty. We ordered the oxtail soup at exactly 11PM. I was curious as to why they only serve it that time so I asked. Our server said it takes a while for them to boil the oxtail because they slow cook it until tender. 

We're done by 11:30PM and going out, about 20-30 people started to line up so I guess 10:30 is a good time to drop by to experience that hearty soup served with cilantro and crushed ginger with a side of plain white rice. The soup is good for sharing and extra soup is just $2 additional.",le1BODzfvrpLrslzDASXBA,0,0,3,DqI6R4nOsggGj_GGTiwETg

After standing in a line about 50 yards deep I was surprised how fast we got to the front and were seated. There are a lot of great items on the menu from Eggs Benedict for under $8, to the Lau Lau, short ribss and much more but I came for one reason and one reason only. I had been told that my Mom has made this for us when I was younger but I honestly dont remember.

The large bowl of broth had plenty of bones with meat coming off the bones. The soup is seasoned very well and I would compare it to a Mexican/Hispanic dish Cocido which uses a different meat but still has a similar taste and texture. If there was one complaint is that a couple of bones had a lot of fat on it but again, I have the same issue on even some of my favorite cocido restaurants. Its going to happen.

My wife tried the Wanton soup but I must explain that she is a very picky eater and does not like vegetables so the bowl of Oriental Soup Combo that the very nice waitress suggested was out of the picture. She ate some of her soup but said it had a strong odor. I tried it and could not pick up any unusual or bad smell.

We also ordered the banana fritters. This was a little deceiving but still very tasty. They give you about 3-4 wanton wrappers with a nut medley inside. It is very good. They also give you a bowl of ice crean and about a half a banana cut into 3/8"" slices. Half is being generous. 

The service was fast and they filled our water glasses often. The waitress was very nice and patient with me when I asked her dumb questions like ""do most people put the rice into the broth?"". She suggested not to and I didn't; what do you think.

Another favorite after hours meal is the LocoMoco - hawaiian favorite of rice with two eggs, meat patty, and gravy.  Those are the only two items I've tried here, so this review goes to them. 

Giving it 4 stars because although the soup is only $10, you need to take a $25 cab ride from the strip to get to the restaurant.  And that means about $50 for round trip.

I met a good friend from Toronto and he chose this place because the buffet to which we had planned to go at the Fremont was closed for renovation.

They still have a $9.99 prime rib special and that's what we both ordered.  It comes with soup or salad bar, baked, mashed, fries or other options for starch, and cherries jubilee for dessert.  I asked for the rarest piece of prime rib they had and I was off to the salad bar.  My friend got the soup of the day, a corn chowder.

The meals came quickly and my prime rib was a nice reddish pink color.  We both ordered baked potatoes and Sandra--our very 'Aloha' server--brought small containers of butter, sour cream, and horseradish before the dinners were ready.

This is not prime rib from some fancy, high priced restaurant.  It's a basic slice of prime rib, thin, but it had good flavor and it's quite a bargain for what you get.  The baked potato could have used a bit more cooking but it was otherwise OK.

The dessert, cherries jubilee, is simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some cherries in a sweet sauce.  While not the real thing, it was an enjoyable ending to the meal.  Since my friend uses insulin and can't have the ice cream, I fell on my sword and had both.

With Boyd owning this casino and picking up other properties around the valley, I'll go farther afield with my dining offers than just the Suncoast.  I enjoyed my dinner here.

It did not disappoint. We trekked it over to the downtown Fremont St area in the middle of the night after a good night of clubbing. This place is located in the California Hotel. We kinda didn't know what this place was called. We just asked a worker about where to find the oxtail soup and he pointed us to this direction. 3:30 in the morning and still a line - we waited about half an hour to get seated. There were plenty of empty tables though - I think they were trying to stagger the parties to alleviate the service and kitchen from getting overwhelmed. But yeah it still bugs me to see that they had the capacity to be able to seat us much faster. I learned that this area and this restaurant too tend to cater to the Hawaiian crowd. From the décor to all the restaurant and shops, it's like their home away from home.  Even the menu at this restaurant had a bunch of Hawaiian dishes. So yeah, we ordered a whole round of oxtail soup for the table. Some people shared and they were smart. So much meat! It's 4 pieces of giant oxtail and fat in a broth with a few veggies, a side of cilantro and ginger and a bowl of rice too. So good and worth the wait, I suppose. The meat is a bit fatty but super big and meaty and fall-off-the-bone delicious. The broth is surprisingly not too oily which is good to slurp up without guilt. And the rice helps with a different texture. Noodles would've been super delicious with the soup as well. We were starving after a long night and I don't anyone finished, not even the guys with their huge appetites. It's only $10 for a bowl.  That's a steal. It's like a pound or two of meat and oxtail can normally go for like $5+ per pound.

SERVICE
Many of the workers here have +10 years of experience in the service industry. Experienced, yet it's the same ole task they do everyday so customer service is rusted, if that makes any sense. Not much attention to detail and constant waving down for them is a must. 

FOOD
Rule #1 here is always order their water with lemon. Water here has a strong chlorine taste. Otherwise, order their diluted coffee or sodas. 

When I say I have visited this place countless times, I mean +100 times over the years. I have tried almost everything on the menu. They have daily specials that are $8.99. Salad bar is good choice if you come in around the time their breakfast buffet ends (11 am) because that's when they switch the breakfast buffet with fresh salads.

My favorite and probably the most ordered dish is their prime rib. Comes with choice of white rice, brown rice, cole slaw,  baked/mashed potato, french fries along with green beans out of frozen package that you can find at any grocery stores. It comes with a dessert at the end, which is their vanilla ice cream. I ask for their prime rib to be cooked medium rare and comes out perfectly 90% of the time. They have multiple chefs there and some will cook your rare medium prime rib to well done. 

I also like their beef teriyaki plate. I like the flavor, albeit too savory for my liking. Beef used for this is always cooked to perfection. It's a small portion.

Chinese chicken salad is another one of my favorite. You can't really mess up on this but I appreciate that this is a big portion. Keep in mind this is always made freshly to order so it will take 15-20mins to prepare.

Oxtail soup. I personally am not a fan, but my company enjoys this dish a lot. Served 11pm to 9am and is a huge portion. It's one of the most popular dish here.

I have no clue why I am even reviewing it since almost every Yelper on here has given enough details on how good it is. I just would hate to over-hype it for anyone.  Bottom line, you have to try their Oxtail Soup yourself.  My only wish is that it was serviced on a plate full of rice.  

Market Street's portions are huge and the prices definitely cheap.  I recently had a full pound of their NY Steak Strip for about $12.  Not the best steak in the world, but good enough.  Back to their Oxtail, hooked up for sure. Enough to serve the average two people.  But I always seem to kill it on my own. 

Couple of Tips:
-Oxtail is only served after 11 PM.  This could have changed by now, but I never take the risk and just make sure I'm in after 11 PM.  

-The line is long, but not as long as it looks.  If you're a single or party of 2, doesn't take long at all.  If you're a party of 4+, can take at least 15 minutes.  Also there's no wait if you're sitting at the kitchen bar.

Sorry I was so hungry that I only got to snap a quick photo of the Portuguese bean soup which was creamy and delicious. By the time I realized I didn't take a picture my plate was empty. Even if the service can be hit or miss and the wait can be long I'll definitely be back,BTnK7RpNqyoisPfuXXL3gQ,0,0,3,CSvF-u8tTXCB0D_3lNCh8g

i like the short rib. the sauce was good. the beans were good. i bet it will be exponentially better if they were hot. 

the soup was cold & weak. seems diluted to me. have to add some salt to awaken the beautiful flavors from the bones, carrots, celery etc. 

found hair (looked like human pubic hair) stuck on the side of the bowl. alerted the waitress and she told us it was oxtail hair. for a private chef, i dealt with animal hairs when cooking often. this clearly do not look like animal hair to me. 

the manager came later and explained the same thing that it is common to find the oxtail hair in the soup. she eventually apologized & later we found out she comp our meal.

The soup was accompanied by a side of rice. The soup was composed of cilantro, ginger, celery, carrots and huge pieces of oxtail. It was quite delicious but I found the oxtail itself was difficult to eat as you were constantly trying to peel the meat from the caverns of the bone. 

I also thought the broth could have used more flavor but generally speaking it was still good.  I wasn't able to finish my bowl because the portions were very generous.  The ginger was one of my favorite part of the dish as I thought it gave the soup a very diverse flavor.

It's a 24hr cafe serving typical breakfast/burger type meals while offering diversity to the menu with their Ox tail soup, silogs, and $5 dollar steak specials. keep in mind they only serve the real cheap eats late night.

Myself I ordered up the Loco Moco. It came in large soup bowl with steamed rice, a beef patti (1/2lb), fried egg, and gravy. Giving you a heads up this meal is the reason for my write up. Compared to other joints they're making it happen flavor and quality wise better. Beef Patty tears into beefy chunks, the rice is steaming hot, and the gravy gives that depth of comfort your looking for when you eat Loco Moco Bruh! This meal is not gonna spare you on calories or sodium but if it's your last meal on earth then you went out like a soulja...Again not a chef but let me emphasize the gravy has character. I'm thinking it's stock based and possible butter if not drippings added for richness.

Other dishes sampled

Ox tail soup, just the broth for me tho. Warm, chinese spiced broth w/ hints of star anise. Chunks of carrot and celery to add sweetness and color. The broth is not served hot enough for me to order, I would need it to be piping hot. The Ox tail cuts served were on the large side. Noticed smaller cuts of Ox tails are usually more tender in most cases, my preference.

Pork tocino or tocilog. This was actually pretty good too. Chef grilled that sliced pork until it caramalized the way it outta to be. It's gets better, if your an eggs feign they serve the meal with 3 instead of 2! If your wondering what's Tocino it's marinated cured pork, usually thin sliced pork butt or possibly thick cut bacon. This should be approachable if your not into filipino food.

$5 Steak Special, 8oz grilled NY Steak strip with fries and string beans! If nothing above motivates you this might.

Not much too say about the decor of the cafe other than outdated. However, the place speaks for itself. It's easy to picture how it probably boomed back in the day. Looking at the staff they probably been here since. Service was not bad, the waiter kept an eye for us and filled up the water whenever needed.

The hostess was nice as she sat us toward the back of the dining room. Now I am not one to complain about where I eat, but some of you might turn your nose up and the place. First of all, this is not new Vegas, its old Vegas. Things are well taken care of in this place (think Denny's) but have an older feel. They have midnight specials, which cannot be beat by anyone else around town! Cheap prices on good cooking!

Our waiter was nice, as he brought us water and our silverware! Boyfriend ordered two bowls of their oxtail soup and two sides of rice. 

When the waiter brought our bowls to the table, all I could think was. How am I going to finish all this? There sitting in front of me was a piping hot and smelling delicious oversized bowl of  the tenderness looking meat sitting on the bone (psst don't tell anyone but I found out that it isn't really ox meat it's the meat from a cow)with cilantro, carrots and mushrooms.

 The side bowl of sticky rice was piled high. The rice was okay did not eat much of it, but the soup was fully loaded with flavor definitely leaving the bones in makes the broth that much better. 

Since this was my first time eating the meat from the soup, I was not as graceful as my boyfriend was while eating it. Instead, I tore into it with a knife and fork and when that did not work, I used my fingers to get the meat off the bone. Yes, I am not happy to admit that but just could not think of putting the bone near my mouth and chomp chomping away at it! 

Not 100% full we decided on having a little sweet snack before leaving. Ordered the banana fritters, which were pretty filling as I could only managed to eat two before being totally full!

Make a note people before coming here: Oxtail soup is not served during the day it is only served after 11:00pm...  

This place is totally worth going to DTLV for late at night!",coKnuxLznH0FHb34m4ZLCw,8,10,4,klnOnIwCMT5Gic7TfJxvJQ
4351297,2018-03-29,2,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"First a disclaimer. I am not giving this place 5 stars because the food is off the hook amazing. It is also not white tablecloth service and frankly it is just a casino coffee shop in a casino not known for glitz or glam. In fact, it is removed from The Strip and here you will definitely not see groomed hipsters inside, celebrity chef restaurant openings, or Maserati's stacked up at the curb. 

What you will find is that Sam Boyd's California Hotel and casino has made a name for itself over the years catering to the people from the Hawaiian Islands whether they come over as tourists to spend money or those that have moved here and are now locals for jobs. This is a niche market that they cater to but they have done it very well. For that, it rings the bell and wins the prize. 

The one thing that HI locals thrive on is food. Not fine dining cuisine but more like local comfort grindz. At the MSC, they are right at home and it shows. Walk in at any time and you will see many Hawaiians chowing down on stuff that seems out of place in the NV dessert. Ox Tail Soup with ginger and green onion, Saimin, Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, Miso Butter fish, etc. Most definitely Hawaiian style local grindz served here at very reasonable prices. On my latest visit, I'm staying on The Strip but drove over for the $6.25 Luau Breakfast Buffet (think all you can eat scrambled eggs, steam rice, portuguese sausage, bacon and corned beef hash along with some other less important things like breads, cereals, and fruit!) That is the deal of the day and they validate my parking ticket just for eating there! No can go wrong!

In a city that has become known for high-end dining with high-end prices to match, the Market Street Cafe is a great comforting Island style find in the middle of Las Vegas and a great deal all the way around.",WHe5tyJbVpkvO_3meMUrdg,5,6,5,iqIAdEoQxwXVecIBtrlpcA

The food is really bad.  I can't understand why there is a long line to eat here.  They do give out $7 coupons in the hotel and casino and I think that's the reason this place is so crowded. People will eat horrible food for free or for a few bucks.  I didn't have a coupon.  I tried the salad bar and the saimin.  The one item in the salad bar that I was expecting to be good was the mac salad and it was horrible.  No flavor whatsoever.  It was bland.  It needed some salt and some egg.  The mayo didn't even have an egg flavor like Best Foods mayo.  The saimin was advertised to have char sui and fish cake.  It was 3 paper thin sliced of komobuko and 3 small nuggets of char sui.  My mom had the mahi mahi that was battered in egg and fried.  The batter came really dry. I looked like egg foo yung but the egg was way over cooked.  My sister had the prime rib and she asked for it medium instead of the typical medium rare that the roast is cooked.  The meat had a grayish tint to it like they put the steak in a microwave to get it to medium from medium rare.  The meat was tough.  Just a poor cut of meat.

I think their fries are a little dry so I usually order mashed potatoes with my prime rib. After several tries, their prime rib is at its best medium rare (I usually order my meat medium), so I had to adjust my preference. It's juicy and chewy and I feel like my testosterone levels are kickin' in whenever I'm eating a big piece of meat. In that case, I have to balance it out by eating ayce salad. 

I really like their salad bar, especially their broccoli salad and bottomless edamame. Their ""crab"" salad can be a little too salty at times, so that's a hit or miss for me. I'm not a big fan of their coleslaw, I don't even know how to describe it. The rest of the salad selection is pretty average (in a good way). 

I've also tried their oxtail soup (once) and thought it was too salty. It's also lacking some veggies. But I won't mind giving it another try. Some of my friends swear it's THE best hangover remedy lol. Its usual diners are Asian families getting their local food grub on and old folks eating after bingo or something.

The flavor wasn't bad at all but I did wish there was more meat than fat on my plate & the texture was pretty tough. It did seem like they just bought and dumped Korean BBQ sauce on it than actually having marinated meat. The plate also came with macaroni salad that I was craving since they serve Hawaiian food but it was disappointing and flavorless. As for the oxtail soup, the flavor reminded me of Filipino nilaga mixed with a watered down beef stew a little sweet, salty, & savory. It wasn't like OMG this is the best thing ever BUT it wasn't that bad either. My family enjoyed it & appreciated that it comes with a side of rice but did say they all thought it would be even better if it was hotter in temperature & I did notice the meat easily falls right off just how it should if it's cooked for 96 hours!

4655380,2016-02-08,8,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"I am a fan of the casino cafe (or Diner as they call them in New York). Sadly, the casinos are gradually replacing them with newer restaurants. In downtown Las Vegas, we recently lost the El Cortez Cafe to Pizza Lotto and the Golden Nugget Cafe to Claim Jumper. I believe that the old school casino cafes compliment the casino experience along with good food at reasonable prices. And so, when I met up with my brother on the Fremont Street East District, we'd walk to the Cali where I'd take advantage of some good old school cafe food. 

    The Market Street Cafe is both the Cali cafe and a restaurant serving Hawaiian food. Their oxtail soup has become a Las Vegas legend. This is no accident. The Cali caters to the Hawaii market and is the epicenter of the Ninth Island casino scene. Market Street Cafe also features a diverse menu with a range of reasonably priced comfort food and daily specials. I usually order the $9.99 prime rib special. This includes the soup and salad bar; a choice of baked potato with sour cream and butter, rice, or mashed potatoes; with cherry jubilee a vanilla ice cream based dessert. 

    Market Street Cafe is a popular dining spot along the Fremont Street Corridor. Just like the last few times I dined here (including before I became Daniel. S Yelper),  a long line is the admission to this dining experience. The long line is the prelude to a restaurant that fills to capacity. The line usually moves along. 

    Immediately after ordering, I headed to the soup and salad bar, which is usually included with the dinners. The only flaw with the soup and salad bar is that the soup was nonexistent. I was satisfied with the salad. The salad bar also featured corn salad and pasta salad. 

    The impersonal waitress soon delivered the prime rib dinner. It was a nice cut of beef with the exception of a couple of fat spots. Overall it was flavorful. With the prime rib, a jus sauce added an additional layer of taste. Complimenting the prime rib was a baked potato that I flavored with butter and sour cream. This was nothing like the baked potato that I recently dug into in the Triple 7 Restaurant in Cali's sister property Main Street Station. It also included green beans that they can keep for the pigs in the North Las Vegas pig farm. It was halfway into festing on the prime rib that the waitress added an additional item onto the table. It was my dessert. Placing dessert on a guest's table when they are half way into the meal is an ABSOLUTE NO NO. Talk about hurrying somebody! Talk about unprofessional service. And let me talk more about poor service. The unprofessional waitress failed to ask me if I wanted a Pepsi refill. So following the cordial rule of dining, I tasted the cherry jubilee that is really vanilla ice cream after finishing the prime rib and baked potato. I just made it to the ice cream because it started melting. 

    After paying around $13 to the cashier and showing the casino cashier my receipt for the parking validation, I walked past the banks of Cali slot machines filled up yet slightly annoyed. As I waited for the light to turn green at Ogden Street, it was clear to me that I will be dining at and yelping at least nine Fremont Street restaurants before and if I do go to Market Street Cafe.

Make sure you call in advance just in case. They start serving at 11pm, but I guess they have ran out before. You don't want to make the trip all the way out there for nothing. 
Location/ambience: dive cafe located in a grungy Asian-dominated hotel in downtown. A type of place I would go for a specific dish and that would probably be it. I could totally see this place in Triple D. 
Service: lots of older Asian servers. Pretty friendly. Our service was fast   Apparently the wait could be really long on some night. No complaints today. 
Food: the server knew right away what we were after. 5 oxtail soups. We also threw in a NY steak plate since it was only $6.99. Soup came out with. 5-10 mins. Good size portion with 3-4 big fatty pieces of oxtail. Also comes with 1 big scoop of rice and side of cilantro and ginger. The soup base flavor was delicious. I love how the cilantro and ginger favors accompanied it. There were some veggies included. Once u dump the rice in, it becomes a very hearty stew. The oxtail was a tad tougher than I would have liked. I wonder if we had come in the early morning, would it have been more tender (longer cooking time). It also got s tad messy trying to extract the meat from the bone. But the flavor was just so good. Every bite was delicious. You definitely get food coma after. The NY STeak was just ok. But for $7! How can u complain. 
Value: I thought was excellent. $10 for this dish in Vegas is good and worth it. 

I kinda wish that this place was closer...but then again they would be charging $19.99 for it. I would definitely return.",pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg,1,0,5,TUiYoa7R3WzaDRd84R5XdA
4702408,2014-01-25,2,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"I've been here a couple times in the past, but never cared for it. Even for the ""Hawaiian"" fare, it was all just a shrug. I know everyone raves about their Oxtail Soup, but I haven't had it. It's not one of my favorite dishes (even when my mom makes it). Anyway, I have visited twice recently because my brother has been receiving dining comps and I rarely say ""no"" to a free meal.

During my first re-visit, our sister joined us and we ordered various breakfast and dinner options. I had a hankering for Corned Beef Hash (the non-homemade type), so I ordered it with eggs. Canned corned beef hash is so wrongfully tasty. I seriously don't understand my taste for it (or Spam), but I know that other people who grew up in Hawaii understand. Anyway, it's nothing spectacular and it's unfortunately salty, so it needs rice (which sucks since it already has starch from the potatoes!). My sister ordered a Loco Moco, another popular dish in Hawaii made of rice, hamburger patty, eggs, and brown gravy. I don't eat this dish often, but it's still enjoyable when it's made well. This particular one wasn't very good, mostly due to the substandard gravy. We all chose the AYCE salad bar as well since it was so inexpensive ($5.95). It's not expansive, but completely worth it.

The second time, my brother and I decided to try their Breakfast Buffet for $6.25/person (6AM - 11AM). SIX DOLLARS AND TWENTY-FIVE CENTS!!! That is insanely cheap. Completely ridiculous and awesome. They offer scrambled eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, bacon, grilled ham, biscuits with sausage gravy, corned beef hash, hash browns, French toast, various canned fruits, and a few other items. One plate of rice, eggs, and just five pieces of Portuguese sausage would cost you more than $6.25 at another restaurant. It's a crazy deal. Oh, and you also get free juice with your buffet. A can of Hawaiian Sun juice? YES PLEASE! I also took home an order of Zippy's chili and rice which was cool that they have it. I used to love Zippy's chili, but it's not something I crave anymore.

Okay, so the food isn't top notch and I thought I was going to have a heart attack just by looking at the breakfast buffet (seriously though, the red heat lamps are slightly blinding) - where are the vegetables?! But for the value, my goodness, it is worth just the few good things they offer! Just beware the hash brown...it was disgustingly dry and tasteless. Oh, and it's really difficult to screw up bacon, so you're safe there!

For a really inexpensive ""Hawaii Eats"" meal for any hour of the day, this is worth visiting. Just leave your expectations at the door and trust me, you'll have a good time.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,4,4,22z0n2VZnxFrI62yJa_BNw

We arrived at Market Street Cafe in the morning and there was a line! We purposely came early but the line was already around the corner.

Apparently they have a system here of who prepares drinks and who you can order from. So I had to order coffee and food from two different people. Odd. Customer service wasn't great overall.

The coffee was horrible but the oxtail soup hit the spot! They gave decent portions of oxtail and it was cheap compared to Hawaii.

We came here twice and our first time coming here was absolutely horrible. When we first sit down, our server doesn't even come to our table for 15 mins. Then he finally comes to us and asks what we would like. I was really drunk so I wanted Chicken Fingers which comes with either soup or the salad bar and french fries. I requested soup and then that was the last time we saw our server. He never brought out the soup, never checked on us, and didn't even bring us drinks. Another server ended up taking over for him because she felt bad for us. However, the soup and the chicken fingers were got good at all. Soggy tenders and soup that tasted like it had been sitting out for quite some time. Gross! (1 star experience)

Then our friends came with us a couple days later to get the Prime Rib Special and this experience was COMPLETELY different. Our servers (ya we had multiple servers) taking care of us. It was great! They continuously refilled our water, was very attentive, and brought our food out super quick. The Prime Rib Special comes with your choice of potatoes (mashed, baked, fries), soup/salad, and a dessert of Cherry Jubilee. The Prime Rib was actually pretty good, especially for 9.99. Also the salad bar wasn't bad either, pretty basic, but nothing awful about it. Don't go too wild on the salad bar though because this special comes with a lot of food. Lastly, I don't actually like the taste of cherries, but when they gave us the Cherries Jubilee dessert, it was really tasty and I really liked it. (5 star experience)

Matter of fact the only Oxtail soup I've ever had!  Haha! I know I'm not pure Asian I guess.  Just my DNA says I am!  

Regardless, my bro was raving about this place months before our trip to Vegas.  So I had to try it.  Needless to say, it was yummy and phenomenal!  Oxtail is very fatty and gelatinous so if you can't handle that then this soup isn't for you. Oxtails have strong muscle fibers thus the meat itself, when slow cooked for a period of time comes out perfectly tender.  The broth is what really kicked it into gear for me.  Very beefy at least 10x more then regular beef stew I would say.  With some salt, pepper, and mixed vegetables this bowl of scrumptious soup was out of this world - well at least you can get it at one place!  

The place itself is inside the California Hotel off Fremont.  Very dingy and old hotel with coin slot machines; for the kids, coin slot machines predated paper money or voucher slots.  You can even stick them into what we call ""Pay Phones"" and make calls!  Who knew!  You get the point.

The line to get in can sometimes be as long as the club lines (not if you are an Emerald card holder) but it moves at a decent pace and you get to see a bunch of interesting folks. When you are done you pay at the cashier up front!

4974847,2006-11-14,0,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"Oxtail soup...oxtail soup...that's all I ever hear about is the oxtail soup.  And it's not just from the locals that are talking about it...it's from the native Hawaiians who are visiting or have relocated and all the other tourists talking about this infamous oxtail soup.  

Served only after 11 pm until about 9 am or 11 am, you'll wait in line for a hour just to get a taste of it.  At $5.95 a bowl, you get two scoops of white rice, a few hearty chunks of oxtail and a light broth with carrots, peanuts and other good bits.  My favorite part - the ginger and cilantro mix they give you so you can toss all that shit right into your soup.  Yum!  And it's not a heavy dish...it's light and doesn't make you feel sick like typical late night fare does.  So, why only three stars then?

Well, because it's only served after 11 pm and I'm damn tired when I get there.  And the line is always so long!  (I waited an hour last night for this stuff!)  They need to hire more wait staff so they could open up all the tables in this restaurant and get us all seated faster.  Everyone is in line just for the soup and nothing else.  Just take a look around you and that's all you'll see.  They won't allow you to take this order to go, which is just as well because people like me would call in an order of twenty soups and they would never be able to put up with the supply and demand of that!  This hotel is located in the downtown area, away from all the glitz and glamor of new Vegas.  So, if you don't have a car, you're less likely to make your way down there.  After a heavy night of partying, you can only hope there's at least one sober and awake driver willing to take you to the California Hotel and stand in line with you for this soup.  And also, if I'm sick in bed or just want to be a brat, I can't beg or plead for my boyfriend to bring this soup home to me because he can't!  Damn!  

The sad part about my first experience with this soup was that the broth was lukewarm.  This was disappointing.  When my sister and her husband ordered a second bowl, it came out piping hot, and what a difference!  I should have asked them to nuke mine a bit so I could have had that hot piping experience for sure!  Next time - I want it hot hot hot and another side helping of freshly grated ginger and cilantro please!

Update! 03/29/08 - Went back last night after a long hiatus and I think I'm done with their oxtail soup.  (I can make it better at home!)  The price went up!  So now it's $7.95!  The line was short when we got there on a Friday night way after 1 am.  Sure, there's TONS of people ordering up this stuff, but I spent the whole time digging my teeth into the oxtail trying to pull the meat off.  Patrons were watching as the oxtail slipped from my fingers and fell into my bowl of soup.  By the time we left, I was in some major need of floss!  (Maybe I've been spoiled 'cuz when I make it at home, the meat gingerly falls off.  No gnawing necessary!)

Update! 04/27/08 - Only went b/c my parents were craving the oxtail!  I had the Banana Fritters ($3.25), it came with four pieces of banana wrapped in wonton skins and deep fried, additional banana chunks, a side of caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with whipped cream on top.  The skin was way too thick on the deep-fried bananas.  The only saving grace was the caramel sauce and ice cream. 

My dad had their $4.00 Half a Pound New York Steak, it came with vegetable, rice, fries, or mashed potatoes.  Not a bad deal for four dollars, huh?

Service - I never mentioned it before, but for the most part, the service is good.  The waitstaff are laid back and friendly, and a good bunch of people working here late at night.

After recovering from a nasty cold, I decided to drop in for, of course, the oxtail soup. To be real, its not that outstanding. The broth is very simple with a skimpy addition of some veggies, but the oxtail bones are so soft and meaty which is all I really care about.

Here's where things went wrong. Let me first mention that the soup was warm, not hot. There was also a black hair in my soup but I couldn't be sure where it came from. It could've been mine for all I know, so I didn't complain. By the time I got home, I was feeling a bit queasy but attempted to sleep it off.

1.  11:00 pm or later
2. Counter seating is first come first serve.
3. They are super busy so some patience is required.
4. The soup broth is a tad salty but rice served on the side compliments it.  Served hot and overall is tasty. (Not as salty as a nice Pho broth).
5. Plenty of oxtail accompanies the bowl - cooked perfectly, succulent & Delicious.  

Overall this bowl if soup is pretty darn Awesome!

Next time I will ask for extra oxtail on the side for an up charge.

Worth the taxi fare and drive time from the otherside of the strip!!

I went with the regular steak and eggs, which comes with toast of choice and either hash browns or white rice.

I also had their soup of the day, which was some chicken corn cream soup, tasted exactly like it sounded, nothing special.

As far as Hawaiian specialties, there weren't that many.  Instead, there were lots of traditional American dishes, which were good.  Just not exactly what I was looking for.  I got the hamburger steak patty with gravy, thinking it was more like a loco moco, but it was pretty much a salisbury steak.  I chose rice, and it was all pretty good.  However, the green beans I could've done without.  

The kiddo got the braised short ribs, and again, good, not great.  Could've been cooked a bit longer because they were a tad tough.  The hubby got the chicken fried steak, and it was, as you guessed it,  good.  I'd think it would be pretty hard to mess up chicken fried steak.

Service was efficient and friendly.  It was like my Lola was serving me dinner.  I actually felt pretty bad for asking for refills.  I had the urge to get up and get my own Pepsi, like a good grand daughter does for her grandma.  She was sweet.

2) HAWAIIAN FOOD!: they have spam and eggs, saimin, and loco moco!! definitely, gonna try this next time

3) OX TAIL SOUP: have to say, this thing was DELICIOUS!!! It's gingery so if you don't like ginger, don't order it. It even comes with a side of ginger and cilantro. It's warm and the meat is soft. Really, it's the perfect meal after a long night of singing along to your favorite DJ's songs

My husband and I both ended up ordering the Prime Rib Dinner for $9.99.  I won't lie at first I was a little sad that I couldn't get the Ox Tail Soup barbecue they didn't serve it until later, but when I realized what a great deal the Prime Rib was I quickly got over the feeling.  This dinner not only comes with a healthy serving of prime rib with green beans and a potato (or rice), but you also get an unlimited salad bar and ice cream for dessert.  Granted my stomach really couldn't fit the ice cream at the end, but it is nice to have the option.

I would have give then that last star, but there is always a line and they have a lot of time restrictions on some of the meals.  Also, don't be fooled by a short line because the line moves painfully slow. This is especially true when you are super hungry, so try to plan accordingly",QfFQvV6tcSg2cnbZORK3sg,3,2,4,m2JaqI3tFJyyb0Kxh_3A9A

They have cheap eats, including full breakfast for $3.99, chicken fingers/fries for about the same, and of course, the Oxtail Soup!  11pm till ???

Oxtail soup is a generous portion for only $9.99!  I think there was about 4 large bones with plenty of meat and a side of rice.  Super tender meats and the broth is yummy.

The banana fritters is a good dessert...fried banana wonton like items, with icecream and fresh bananas....and some caramel type drizzle!  Very good, and it's only about $3-4.

Service is lacking here...you'll get your order quickly, but almost every time we are here, the servers aren't very friendly, don't offer refills, and are not very personable.  So minus one star...but still a great spot to hit late night!

If you don't feel like eating prime rib, try some of the local food they have on the menu. Definitely worth it.

I have witnessed servers sigh and roll their eyes at my grandparents when they get confused about menu items, this has frustrated me overtime.

I did state in a previous review that whenever something is deemed as the 'best' ever, I am usually disappointed. I think this was the case. All of the hype over the soup had it so built up in my head, that it could never live up to my expectations. OR maybe it was due to the fact that the gentleman at the table next to me was obnoxiously eating the soup and making very loud noises and groans while he ate. I don't know -- it didn't ignite that kind of passion in me. I guess I just didn't get it. I would say that the soup was pretty good but I'm not drinking the koolaid like everyone else. I liked how big the portion was (big enough to split) and we had amazing service, even though they were extremely busy. We noticed that at least 50% of the restaurant (if not more) were ordering the soup, so it seems like the secret is out!

all of your friends can't decide where to go and you end up here.

Please tell me I'm right? It seems over the years that's always the reasons why I'm here at this place. No, I'm not saying don't come here, I'm just saying the food here has been great , has been average, and has also been awful in different times I've been here. 

Most recently, we came here for the breakfast buffet because it was the fastest thing on the menu because you can just line up and eat right away. But the item I love (Portuguese sausage) was so bad that I couldn't even take a bite. I mean, how you can fuck up an oily sausage? That's like saying I overcooked chicken thighs. 
It was just dry like dust.

Coming here and be able to sit with all of 12 of your friends at 2am talking about nothing , like an episode out of Seinfield, is pretty priceless here. And being able to do it over the Oxtail soup (which was okay) or my usual club sandwich has great memories that money can't buy. 

Oh Market Street Cafe, you really need an overhaul of your menu. Keeping some of the favorite local grinds and maybe just focus on a smaller menu to make it more tasty. While you're at it, please change your seating arrangement. There's always a time and date where people are backing out and hitting other people / waitresses here.

       - Specials - Cal Prime Rib is good till 11pm. After that, most poeple get the Oxtail soup for their late night specials.
       - Prime Rib and Steak - Better get it medium rare or below or it'll probably be pretty dry.
       - Line - During rush hour, there is a pretty lengthy line. I'd recommend coming right before or after that.

**Ordered**
       - $9.99 CAL Prime Rib - Decent Prime rib for the price. Served with salad bar, side, and their cherries jubilee dessert. This is a very popular choice since their salad bar and dessert are so good.
       - $14.50 One Pound T-Bone Steak - Served with salad bar and side. It's a large steak for the price. It's not top notch, but I'd get it again. 
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap bite to eat. Value over quality is what you're getting here.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,1,3,DC-zV3CFaSvjveChpdFvaQ

We ordered one oxtail soup, a side of fries, and a side of bacon since we weren't super hungry. We asked for an extra plate, and the server told us it was $2 for an extra empty plate. So we just said.. ""Oh ok, never mind then. Thanks."" So my one friend ended up finishing the oxtail soup. Ok, no big deal. Of course when we get our check, they end up charging us the $2 for the extra plate that we never got. Immediately we brought that up to our server especially if we didn't even end up sharing. I can tell that she didn't wanna deal with it. Right away, she asked us if we wanted to talk to the manager. We addressed the issue to the manager. She said (I kid you not), ""Nope. Sorry, you're gonna have to pay for it. There's 4 of you and 1 entree.""...... and she walks away. I know that it's only $2, and I wouldn't have minded. It was the way that they approached us that frustrated us. 

After coming here quite often, I would say that I am satisfied with the service half the time, and the other half, we end up walking out pissed off....... But we still come back for the oxtail soup!",_tjEaaTXE4M0Z7uK8Y11cw,1,0,3,UM8_st2XRoIpMs2O43bYlw

Nothing beats a large steaming bowl of meaty broth on a cold night either. The added garnishes of chopped ginger, fresh garlic, and cilantro makes the broth better. For such a complex dish, it is a bummer that the liquid tastes like straight up beef broth from the store. Other than that, the whole experience was great. The Asian fried chicken was moist and flavorful. It comes with a side of vegetables and a choice of carb. The NY steak is nothing to right home about and was not cooked to our specification, but it was decent. I would suggest one of the two first items.

The service is attentive and quick. We were able to get in and out within an hour. The best part is that three meals cost a total of $26. Late night menus are the best to soak up all the alcohol and prevent hangovers.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,1,4,StU_JyVzNNUYYTgP1vZoKw

Also they serve rice on the side and you can trade it for brown rice, which is a huge plus for me.  By the way the dish plus tips and tax for a total of $12.  Totally worth it, will find time to eat it again.  

They also got NY steak for like $7, seems like a lot of good options to choose from.  I think I will get the oxtail soup again next time I come, but hope I can being a friend or two here next time so I can have them try the other dishes.

===Food===

Oxtail soup: By far the best oxtail soup that I've had. The broth is delicious here! I definitely recommend getting this here.

Steak & eggs: Surprisingly a very tender piece of meat with 2 eggs, toast and your choice of rice or hash browns. The steak was around 6 oz. so it's a little on the smaller side, but it was very good. 

Prime rib dinner: The prime rib was pretty good for the price. You definitely can't complain when it comes to this entree. 

AYCE salad bar: Your typical salad bar with all the toppings. Make sure you wear some loose pants!

5448290,2011-07-07,2,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"This place is known for their late night oxtail special, so after a long flight that came in late, that is what we went straight for. The busers serve you drinks and guess what, mine was not paying attention when he put my water cup down and it spilled ALL over me. WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS, ARLENE! Luckily, I had already put my Louis bag on another chair and was not wearing anything expensive. A supervisor came by to ask if I was okay, and I just said that I was fine and that it was just water. Of course, spilling a drink on someone is unacceptable and that set my mood for Market Street Cafe for the rest of the trip. Unfortunately for me, I was staying at the Cal and had meal vouchers for this 24 hour restaurant.

On to the food. The oxtail was NOT the absolute best thing I have ever had. Yes, it was fall off the bone soft, but it was so fatty. Plus, the ends were dark colored as if it is old meat. The soup is salty and they skimp on the vegetables. Also, for all the mess that we make eating the dish, I wish they would provide an extra small bowl for the bones. I like how they put the ginger and cilantro on the side so we can add it to our taste liking, plus I prefer no cilantro at all.

My favorite time to eat here is breakfast. Do not get their prime rib scramble since it is probably leftovers from the night prior. I like the made to order omelettes but my absolute fave is the Philippine breakfast. It comes with tocino! The busers in the morning come around frequently to refill coffee, but never asks to refill my orange juice. My last morning they tell me that it does not come with free refills. Well that was my first time hearing of that, and if my cup is empty, why wouldn't you even offer regardless of charge. Stay consistent people. I have gotten free refills on OJ before! I do not care about the charge. I just want to stay hydrated in the 101 degree weather!

Lines are long, especially at 11pm when the oxtail special starts, but it moves fairly quickly. The vouchers do not cover everything. For example, oxtail is a dinner voucher plus $2. Sometimes they apply less than $2 to your meal and you pay the balance. It's confusing.

It's inside the California Hotel in old Las Vegas, but definitely worth the cab ride there.  I paid a $26 dollar cab fare to get there from the Hard Rock Hotel last summer when our total meal only cost us $14 bucks, lol!

They have a variety of late night eats available, the majority of our table of seven had tocino (sweet pork, a Filipino delight!), eggs and garlic rice.  The seventh friend got spam & eggs, it looked scrumptious!

You've got families, rough necks, elderly couples, drunk chicks wearing 300 dollar shoes, random gamblers and lurkers.

What I saw was a collection of letters, heavy on the vowel count and in a configuration I have not seen before. Trying to blink my eyes back into focus and reboot the brain cells that got short circuited from trying to process her name was time enough for Server X to bounce. I let it go for the moment and planned to ask her about it upon her return. The food arrived. Delicious comfort food was just what I needed. I didn't see purple on the menu, but would have been sooo good. Distracted by all that was going on at the table Server X slipped my mind. When the busboy came to clear the table I asked him, ""Hey, that girl that set the table for us, what's her name?"" Dude was pretty tall and when I asked he stood upright and stared out into the distance. From the low viewing angle I could still see the blank look on his face. Awkward silence ensued. A good 10 seconds passed before he responded: ""I don't know."" with shame in his eyes. WTF... then, ""Nobody knows how to pronounce her name."" And he quickly bounced. She never returned.

During this period they offer to serve a limited menu upstairs in the Ohana conference room. It's great that they keep up with their sanitation standards but unfortunate for us it was occurring during our visit. 

So this review is solely based on our dining experience on this occasion.

First, all guests were told they'll begin serving in the Ohana room at 11pm, instead doors didn't open until 11:15pm...bad

The seating in the Ohana room was arranged in banquet style round tables so we had shared a table with 2 other parties.....it was a good 15 minutes before everyone around the table got use to it

When my highly anticipated bowl of Oxtail arrived, it was only 3 pieces of oxtail with lukewarm broth, it was a disappointment.  I asked the waitress what happened to the peanuts, celery and carrots? She said ""peanuts was no longer served in soup due to allergy reasons"". So why the missing vegetables?  We couldn't help but noticed that other later patrons had the veggies in their oxtail soup....BAD

Then half way thru my soup, our waitress came back with a bowl of diced carrots and celery, claiming that the cook forgot the veggies and she offered it around our table.  She was nice about it but it was a very laughable situation.  We also noticed they were carting in many bowls of oxtail soup to a corner microwave to be reheated. Really? Granted there was no kitchen nearby, so this whole setup was a bad dining substitution.

With so many bars and hotels in the area though, we figured we would just wing it and see where the alcohol took us.  The one thing we knew for sure though was our last stop of the night - Market Street Cafe's famous ox tail soup!

Now I know - when it comes to post drinking/clubbing food, the usual suspects that come to mind are classics like burgers, pizza, and burritos.  But ox tail soup?  A little unexpected...much like the line!  Parked in a corner of the California Hotel casino, it was pretty surprising to see so many other people there.  I guess that just shows how popular they are for late night eats.  

The roughly 20 minutes it took for the three of us to get a table seemed agonizingly long since we were so hungry, but the wait was worth it.

The meat tasted great and it was oh so tender - so easy to pull it off the bone!  The broth was flavorful despite being on the lighter side, but I thought it could have used a little more richness to it.  Still, not too bad as it was.

The rest of the menu looked decent from what I saw, and I especially liked how it offers so many island/Hawaiian dishes (they have saimin!).

If you know, you know what I'm talking about. Good stuff.

Lines can be pretty long but to me, for the most part...moves at a good pace. Service isn't so bad either. Out of all the million times we've been...it's been pretty personable. Never had a rude waiter/waitress. Has a decent menu similar to foods found at a Dennys or some sort. However, I'd prefer to eat here over a 'Dennys or some sort' because of the other food options like a tocino breakfast, zippys chili, and specials like their miso butterfish. Us Hawaii folks living out in the desert always appreciates some nostalgia or likeness to home. 

They have pretty good walkway space between tables so if you must bring your stroller in, don't feel afraid to do so. If you got those.humongous double side-to-side kine strollers...leave 'um brah.

If you aren't in the vicinity, there's no need to rush on down...unless you're in the vicinity and you've had a night of gambling and drinking while family is in town, and need some soup to sober up. =D

Then I'd definitely recommend. Enjoy!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,1,1,3,lE6On5Q-rDsG5_IDP_TD3Q

Their menu is pretty extensive, but some of their entrees come straight from Hawaii! Definitely a must for locals. I'll include this in my California Hotel review, but most of their guests are from Hawaii. The restaurant itself has that local vibe to it. 

Onto our dinner. We ordered the Wonton Min, Korean Short Ribs and the Chop Steak.
The Wonton Min's broth was so delicious it reminded me of home. For me there's saimin from Hawaii and then there's the traditional Japanese Ramen. Unless you're from Hawaii, it's really difficult to find that local tasting broth. It's difficult to explain so I do apologize but you'll just have to try it for yourself! Now with the Korean Short ribs, I was expecting thing cuts of ribs, like Kalbi for example. However on this plate was a thick, tender, piece of short ribs. Literally the meat fell off the bone and it was flavored so well. Lastly with the chop steak, I wasn't expecting much. However, it was simply delicious. Sure the meat didn't feel like a prime piece of steak, but it was tender and the taste of the sauce with rice and macaroni salad mixed so well together. The texture of bell peppers, onions and celery was also very satisfying.

As you get seated down in this packed restaurant, you can see everyone eating out of a bowl, sopping up spoonfuls of broth. The melody of slurps swells in the air and it's almost unanimous what should be eaten here.

The oxtail soup is a savory dish with a rich broth and meaty chunks of oxtail. It has flavors of both savory and sweet inside the fatty meat. 

For those who never had oxtail before, don't be afraid of this dish. Think of it like eating some delicious, tender beef shanks. The bone-in flavor seeps into the meat, making the broth and meat that more delicious. It's something you have to try.

They also have other delicious items that go for very cheap after the 11 PM hours of the night: the chicken strips & fries, New York Steak, Won Ton Min. Okay, so they aren't the best you can eat, but they are still good, and with being able to buy all three of those dishes up top and not top $15, that's pretty damn good.

The place is a good bargain for late night eats if you're out late gambling or drinking. Of course, the oxtail soup is the way to go, but with prices so low, you're free to explore other dishes at cheap prices.

It didn't have much flavor to the broth so I added a lot of shoyu and mustard. It came with wontons in it that wasn't mentioned on the menu because I figured you would only get them if you ordered the wonton min.

Located inside the California Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas at the Market Street Cafe. 

Come here between 11pm - 9am for their graveyard specials. NY steak for like $7. Oxtail soup for $10.99. I had heard so much about their oxtail soup so I had to try it. Around 1030pm people are already lining up for the oxtail soup. The soup was lukewarm so definitely ruined the whole experience. I like my soups boiling hot. Aside from that they are very generous with the portions of oxtail. The oxtail is huge and very tender. The broth was clear and flavorful. It comes with a side of rice. Definitely should substitute it with ramen instead ! 

My bf ordered the Oriental Soup combo. Comes with noodles, wontons, fish cakes and vegetables. The broth was savory. 

Overall the food is okay. The prices are very reasonable. Their service is okay. Cant expect much because they are always so busy. If im in the area I might give it another try but I wouldn't make the drive out here if I was staying on the strip.

For what you pay (dirt cheap) & what you get...........it's a real good bargain! I ordered the steak & eggs (they make the eggs anyway you like it), you get a choice of rice or potatoes, and toast on the side.

Service is fast.........got in & filled my big belly, and was was outta there in no time!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,6,6,4,GXXjtX3NAHp8-Hyiq65Gsw

I asked a waitress for a different cup of coffee, thinking there may have been a fluke w/this pot... 'Nope, it's just weak-@ss coffee. A good cup of coffee makes a great first impression, bad coffee can be equally damaging.

Also, because I was super hungry going in I ordered the Filipino breakkies. 

Oxtail soup - HUGE PORTION!!! Definitely sharable in my opinion. They give you a little side of ginger and cilantro to add to the already seemingly flavorful broth and a small bowl of white rice. I accidentally dumped the whole container of cilantro into my bowl before I could even try the broth so I can't say if there was any difference, sadly. Hence, me saying ""seemingly flavorful"" broth. The meat was so fall off the bone. It makes you wonder how many pots they got goin on in the kitchen to get them allllll to be that way. The meat was also super fatty! Like REALLY fatty. I ate some but not all of the fatty goodness because I was too scared to eat anymore of it. I wish I had an even bigger stomach to be able to fully enjoy the soup!!

Filipino breakfast - comes with rice, eggs your way, tocino, and a nice little cup of fried garlic. Hearty portion and very typical Filipino breakfast. The tocino was nice and fatty just the way I like it. All it needed was some vinegar!! 

Fair warning! I came in on a Thursday night and there was a line to get in. It moved along quickly but I heard the weekends are horrible!

We decided to go there late one night when we needed a break from the slot machines and gosh darn it, the line was ridiculously long.  It was about 3 am and the line wrapped around 3 times in the normal lobby/waiting area.  They weren't exactly taking customers in the order they came in but in the order which it was most convenient to seat certain amounts of people in your party.  If a table for 4 opened up, they would take the next party in line that had 4 people and so forth.

The baked potatoes were clearly cooked earlier in the day and reheated for us when we ordered. The saimin was doughy and overcooked.",UyUJ2dAPVTwAELPV4dAqyw,1,1,3,wpaJICVzRsa5LwnsMGu25A

(See review). Because of my underwhelming experience with the Portuguese sausage at the Garden Court Buffet (see review), I asked my server if it was spicy as I prefer it. She couldn't say for sure as, not surprisingly, both hotels used the same product but encouraged me to try it anyway. So I ordered that along with a stack of pancakes. As it turns out, the sausage was pretty good while the pancakes were just okay. The meal did serve its purpose, keeping me filled for several hours. 

If you're already staying at the California or Main Street Station, or just went on a long gambling run at either, it's probably a decent, convenient choice to get some grub. I just won't order the pancakes again! LOL",kVyOe_qIsGAlk0wo9n9_9g,0,0,3,0n6cAzNz6sGrTzeKYPy7hw

I thought the food would compensate for it but even the wait for the food was long and when I finally got it, it wasn't even good. I ordered the golden shrimp w clam chowder, mashed potatoes and string beans. Clam chowder was salty. Mashed potatoes were okaaaay. String beans were soggy, and the shrimp? Not even crunchy. Funny texture and just not good. The woman serving my table wasn't even a good waitress either. She mentioned her shift almost being over when I asked how her shift was going. Also, when she was serving us our food, she literally handed one of the plates to my cousin rather than placing her food ON the table in front of her. She didn't even state which plate was who's when she gave us our food. My cousin also asked a diff waitress for napkins and the waitress didn't even make eye contact w her and when she gave my cousin the napkins, she literally just placed it on the table and left. AAAAAND, when our waitress came back, after serving us our food, she didn't bother coming back to ask how it was. Lastly, she didn't come back to refill our waters at all. We had to ask. Overall a 1. I would give this place half of a star if I could, honestly. I'm very generous w my reviews too! But this place is just not it.",0q7r4AQicfVYxcf4aP0z8A,0,0,1,Zww94CIS0Cslgd4N_dYRDw

I say it's worth it. 

Come after 11:45pm, since the line is pretty around 11 when they start serving. Be prepared to wait. The cafe is pretty large, so they can seat quite a few people here. 

The prices are quite cheap for many of the other items, so if you happen to have a stick in the mud in your party who doesn't want to try the soup, there are plenty of other inexpensive options. They aren't as good as the soup, but it's still pretty good for the price.

Definitely just what you're looking for in a soupy delight. I try to get it every time I'm downtown late at night.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,4,orNeVxdhshubC2BoXDMwmQ

Let's just say if I'm ever in the area, I'll go to Fremont Hotel to get an oxtail soup and be satisfied. I had their teri burger and while it was big they used the sweet teriyaki sauce, not the authentic teri sauce most locals know. Burger didn't taste all that bad but it doesn't come with french fries?! How do you not offer burgers with french fries? Who does that? And sub in macaroni salad instead. Blah! Portions are huge! My grandma ordered a hamburger steak plate that could feed 2-3 people. My aunty got their saimin, wow. I'd be there for days eating that thing and their side teri chicken comes with two pieces. So that's pretty much the only thing going for them. The Filipino guy behind the register not very friendly, and the young Filipino girl was nicer. This happens to be a local favorite but I think it's only because of its convenience.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,12,11,3,Y7NJ3wNgJ4XSrVrffErkpw

Prime rib deal comes with 1) soup or ayce salad bar 2) prime rib (potato, green beans) 3) cherry jubilee dessert 

The salad bar isn't crappy either with decent salads, toppings, etc. I was expecting a dry prime rib but wow I was surprised with what $10 can get me. Not bad at all! Of course not Lawry's status but pretty good. Lastly, the cherry jubilee is such a nice finish to seal the deal. Loved how it comes with a wafer cookie. 

Mai was our server and her service was excellent!",q4jhCWLkC6WA5ZiN6hWf9w,6,2,4,IaOHTz_recIUyYdeAZP9_w
5979177,2014-12-21,0,Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ,"This is a review solely for the Oxtail Soup, and for service strictly after 11 PM.. because I've literally never been here for anything else.

3 stars for the oxtail soup because of its inconsistency. The meat is always fall-off-the-bone tender perfection. The soup itself, however, is all over the place. Sometimes it is bland despite handfuls of garlic and cilantro. Sometimes it is so salty you end up eating all the rice with just a splash of soup. Sometimes it is heaven-on-earth perfection. And when it is good, it is very very good. This would definitely be a 4 or 5 star review is they could just stick to the perfect Goldilocks medium every single time. 

The service is perfectly fine, a little aloof, but at this hour they do a perfectly pleasant job of dealing with the drunkards trying to pre-empt their hangovers with oxtail soup. 

Whenever we go out in downtown, I secretly wish that someone suggests getting oxtail afterward, because every time, I hold out hope that the soup will find that perfect balance.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,1,0,3,pHn90zFnIPtCEMfpe1_jRw
