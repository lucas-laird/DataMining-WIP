Half priced appetizers (which are basically meals) 12 wings for $4?!?! And they are the best damn wings around! The fish and chips are incredible and only $10. This is owned by Ellis island so they have their delicious beers and root beer. I love the country friend steak, it's like $6. (Also they must make their own ranch because it is like crack!)

The order was fixed, but we were never offered drink refills and we both ate our entire meal without a beverage.  
Service at this location is always poor.   Even sitting at the bar we were treated to some of the worst service i have received at this location.

If they cut back on them, it would be perfect. Also, it only had crust on the top, so I guess you could consider it healthier since it would have less calories.

Of course I have always loved coming here, they have the best fish and chips I have ever had!   

The menu isnt huge but its satisfying.   I ordered corned beef hash patties w/eggs, toast, potatoes and sausage Patties, the portions are HUGE.    $6.49 for my meal by the way and you would think the food would not be that good for that price but nope, delicious!

He ordered a Ham steak breakfast, the ham (of course I tried a bite) was melt in your mouth!

The restaurant is clean, comfortable, quiet.    The waiter we had was great, kept coming back to fill up the coffee and I ordered a pink lemonade and asked if I could take the rest home with me and he brought me a brand new one.   :)

This individual definitely let us know he had no desire to be at work and prompt service isn't on the menu. Apparently we were out of line to ask to have the football game on the tv. It was a Sunday evening, and we wanted food and football. Our waiter told us he was busy and would get to it. He did put the game on, as soon as we walked out the door. I'm guessing asking for drink refills was too much to ask. Since we NEVER were able to get a second drink. I have never had a waiter make me feel like I was an inconvenience until this night.

2491347,2016-09-11,0,CAxHrXoPrbf0e0AYFPhv6g,"Being so close to where we do 'business', the Pub is often our choice...and the price is decent---Oh, Oh, new menus (again!) probably higher prices too? 

Sometimes the service is terrific (Adam, Carlo, Alicia) sometimes the service is NOT so good (nearly every Sunday morning).   Management always trying to save a dime. 

Occasionally in the evening we will experience a truly well-cooked, well-presented meal.  We can tell when there is a visiting/substitute cook.  So sometimes our meal/service is 5 Star, but not often.  Usually mediocre, but at least it is what we ordered & looks like it too.

However:

9/10/2016:  Stopped in for a quick meal and a HARD ROOTBEER...being phased out we hear, too bad....On sale now $1.50 a glass!

Ordered the Chicken Fingers that I've ordered a hundred times (been going to the Pub for almost 10 years) expecting what I've ordered for years.  Instead some small, strange shaped pieces of overly deep-fried crunchy chunks.  Horrid!   Didn't want to cause a fuss, so nearly broke a tooth trying to eat.   Waste of $$.  Tried to peel off the thick granite coating, but impossible since there was so little chicken fused to the outer rock formation.

Adam was his usual accommodating self and tried to explain, even getting more of the 'chicken fingers' since the hard chunks were so small...simply more of the same brick-hard batter posing as chicken fingers.  The kitchen should be ashamed.

Ellis Island, you must give something better than this,  there are plenty of restaurants in L. Vegas.  Get a decent cook who doesn't over-cook everything to rock hard and hire a few more servers.  Quit messing with things that have been on the menu for years---wouldn't it be fair to let customers know when something this dramatic happens to a menu item?  If it's not making a high enough profit for you (Oh, those chicken fingers used to be so good), then take them off the menu.  So disappointed, I may stop going to the Pub altogether.",40q-dNXq-n066YCsQayAzw,1,0,2,ubN0snyH1MioBzb1vAoXzA

The food is typical pub food. The fish and chips are amazing. Yes, there have been some screwup and inconsistencies, hence the 4 stars,  but overall the food has been good.

3391812,2014-12-29,3,CAxHrXoPrbf0e0AYFPhv6g,"Hmm I'd love to give this place a higher rating, but one of their ""company policies"" holds me back. On Christmas, after spending the day with family a few friends and I decided to hit up our local bar for some after Christmas libations... and after a few hours we found ourselves very hungry. I guess eating non-stop for the last few days had our tummies trained. Unfortunately, the kitchen was closed for xmas so the bartender recommended Village Pub and this was the closest location. I downloaded the menu and called to confirm takeout. I spoke to Jamie on the phone and she informed me that she could not take my order over the phone. I would have to come down in person before she could take the order. This was really frustrating as we were only a few blocks down the street and it would have been nice to place the order, so that when I arrived it would be ready. I had already volunteered to go pick it up. Completely inconvenient to wait until I arrive to be able to place the order and then sit at the bar while the food is made. I was appreciative that they were serving food on Christmas, but this company policy will limit my return in the future, regardless of how good the food. 

Another complaint that I had... I ordered the Prime Rib Special at$15.99, but was informed that there would be a $2.00 up charge for takeout. I don't really understand the logic behind a $2.00 up charge on the special, especially because it was more expensive that either of the other entrees ordered (Steak and Shrimp $12.99 or Chicken Parmesan $12.49) I was also charged $.50 for cheese on my baked potato. I just feel like this is all in poor taste. 

Once I arrived at the bar, Jamie was very friendly. She made me a $4 Vodka/Water while I waited for the food. Obviously, I don't hold her accountable since she informed me this was all company policy... I mean you can't really argue with that. 

As far as the food, it was ok. We were hungry and it definitely did the job. I did appreciate that Jamie or the kitchen staff made sure to include creamy horseradish for my prime rib and extra sour cream for my baked potato. There was also lemon that we assumed was for the fish. That was a very nice touch.

During Football season my friends and I like to come here to watch, especially the morning games on Sunday. The game specials are great! And we spend a few hours there for a great price. Not to mention the morning bartender is wonderful and we can't wait to come back.

This past Sunday my team was playing the 5:30pm game, so the regular staff we're used to wasn't there, but we've had this bartender before and we put our orders in which came out in a timely manner. The issues started when the rest of our party arrived and things started picking up in the game.

The extra 3 people at my table put in there orders within 5 minutes of arriving; drinks came out quick, all was hunky dory. Then a few minutes later one of the teams scored a touchdown and a party across the bar cheered loudly for a moment and laughed because the rest of the bar was quiet. We laughed as well because we were cheering for the opposite team, then this was when things got weird?

The bartender (who is mentioned in another review concerning the same game) seriously scolded the cheering party for being ""too loud"" and said this wasn't a ""PTs or Kopper Keg"". Excuse me? You're a bar that has the game on THREE SCREENS one of which is a HUGE PROJECTION SCREEN. No one had complained, and in fact aside from my party and their party, there were a total of 3 other people in the bar, who also said out loud ""None of us complained"".

Needless to say this bartender acting this way was a total buzzkill, and not to mention my friends had waited almost 30 minutes for an order of chili cheese fries and 25 wings. Seriously?

We left and went to PTs since the bartender suggested it, and I like to be loud and actually be able to CHEER A FOOTBALL GAME without being scolded like a child. I will not be coming back when she's at the bar, you can guarantee that.",QwF1v-bnTPECj2nYEQczBw,3,1,1,BbFS9n6PRH9Qm4Qm9vjRRQ

Very super slow service. The place wasn't even that full of people. But the server was slow AND forgetful. We (and other customers) had to ask for things more than once. A meal that should have only taken 45 minutes to an hour took two hours, due to the slow service. 
We were seated right away, because you're allowed to seat yourself.
We got menus in about 5 minutes.
It was another 20 minutes or so before our order was taken.
Then, the real waiting began. You know the jokes, ""They're waiting for the chicken to hatch."" Etc.
The chicken pot pie was LOADED with peas. It had WAY too many peas. Otherwise, it was good, but definitely not worth the wait.
My dining partner had a steak. He said it tasted okay, but he ordered it medium and it was clearly well done. He said it also was chewy like shoe leather.
We ordered a scoop of ice cream for dessert. How long does it take to get a scoop of ice cream? Apparently, it takes a really, really long time. The employees were chatting it up when they could have been scooping the dang ice cream.
Also, said ice cream, when it finally came, it had to be the cheapest brand they could find. It was just not right. Couldn't eat it.",Vwwp4QxVhmP7uNJz4pdkDA,1,0,2,IfYEqOqWW8SS-pkr4UYg8A

When the cooks come out to serve me my dinner, I start drooling for reasons unrelated to food. ;) And if you're into machines, it seems to be pretty good.

If you've ever been to PT's or any other local bar/casino/restaurant you'll find that the Pub is about 1000 times better.  And yes, its a bar/restaurant, darkly lit, woodsy, with cool old fashioned booths and chairs.

Steak Fries: the best in the entire state.  In fact there are no better fries anywhere.

Cobb Salad: it's huge and better than the Cheese Cake Factory, which is 2nd only to The Pub.

Turkey Burger: if you don't eat red meat and have to make a choice, choose the turkey burger.  Simply amazing and there is no better in the entire city, Las Vegas included.

Fried Chicken: if you've had the fried chicken at the Rio Buffet or Tuscany (which is the best in the city) this is just as good.  All about that buttermilk batter I think.

***And finally but not to be forgotten: Fried Shrimp - undeniably the best and I'm comparing to any restaurant in the city, even $40 a plate places.  Nice big awesome shrimp!  All about that batter.

Really, you can't go wrong.  

Oh and since a lot of the bad reviews have to do with time problems, if you're in such a  huge rush, go and get some crappy fast food and waste someone else's time.  I'm sure everyone will appreciate it.

We tried their Light Beer and their Stout beer and they were both delicious and we ordered more of them later on.  We placed our order and everything came out quickly and correctly from the kitchen for all six of us. 

I ordered the Bleu Burger which came with bleu cheese, bacon and sauteed mushrooms on a ciabatta roll (YUM).

4655153,2015-02-01,5,CAxHrXoPrbf0e0AYFPhv6g,"IT TAKES A VILLAGE 

   It takes a Village to bring good food and fun times with decent prices to the people. Throughout the Las Vegas Valley , when it comes to good food and fun times at decent prices, and a down to earth bar to enjoy an Ellis Island beer, the Village Pub has the people covered. 

  Ever since I moved to the Las Vegas area in 2004, I have been a fan of the Village Pub. It was in the last year that I really spent time in a Village Pub at the Desert Shores location before and after walking along the ethereal shores of Lake Jacqueline. I predict a review for this location in the near future. The thing is that Desert Shores is around twenty miles from my place. The Eastern Avenue at Wigwam Lane Village Pub is convenient to my work and home. During the past three late Saturday afternoons I spent time here after work. Each of the three times spent here, I  intentionally ordered a different entree. This review is a report of my three experiences here in the month of January, 2015. 

January 17: 

  As soon as I walked inside, I set eyes on a chalkboard menu displaying the outstanding daily specials. Recently on a Friday in the Desert Shores Village, I ordered the $8.99 fried shrimp special and truly relished every bite. Once I looked at the regular menu, there was no need for the Saturday $13.99 rib special.

   Once you walk inside this Village, you feel like you are dining in England. This is a divided Village with a smoky bar separated from a smoke free restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is dark red with walls adorned with paintings and tvs. In its unique way minus windows it is a Village in a world of its own. 

  I ordered the Greek Penne Pasta ($9.99). It included soup or salad. I ordered the cup of the cream of broccoli soup. On all three soups, cream of broccoli was the soup. The Greek Penne Pasta with the chicken and penne pasta was decent. But the coffee needs improvement. 

January 24:

   The speed of service is not their strong point. Their were some long gaps in service. Especially from finishing the meal to the check. But in the Village, people are not rushed. 

   I ordered the Chicken Francise ($10 .99). Instead of the soup I ordered the house salad. The Chicken Francise was a good choice. On the plate was a sufficient portion of a chicken cutlet sautéed in lemon, white wine, butter, and garlic, over rice pilaf and veggies. It was both delicious and filling making my taste buds feel like a Baron of the Village. I was looking forward to my next experience here. 

  After the diner, I hung out in the bar. I enjoyed an Ellis Island lite draft while playing Keno. What I don't like about the bar is that they discourage you from paying when you get the beer. This isn't the most persistent service which results in a wait from when you want to hit the road to when you can pay. Overall Jamie is a good bartender. 

January 31:

    Today I opted for the fish & chips ($9.99 and soup or salad $1.99 extra). I had overheard the servers telling the customers that the fish & chips are their favorite. The menu boasts that it is simply the best for over forty years. Their three large fish &  chips are Icelandic cod dipped in a beer batter sauce made from Ellis Island beer. As I delved into their fish and chips I enjoyed the taste of the Icelandic cod dipped in tarts sauce between bites of steak fries and sips of Coke. But it wasn't the best. How could it be? When I chow down on fish & chips, cole slaw is the food companion of choice. I strongly think that Cole slaw would of improved the fish &  chips dinner. In my opinion hitherto now, Miller's Ale House serves the best fish & chips. 

  After the dinner, I hung out in the bar. It was a similar experience to the 17th.

The Village is in my future:

   There are dinner entrees that I am looking forward to enjoying at a Village Pub in the future. They include the pasta mariana with meatballs, chicken parmesan, and a burger. What I anticipate happening is that I will be enjoying them in a different Village Pub regardless that I am a fan of this location. Preferably this location will be along the ethereal shores of Lake Jacqueline and or another Village that I will become acquainted with.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,7,7,4,Hv6T9exiRByWg39SeWod4Q

I asked my server what their signature dish was and without hesitation he said the fish and chips. That is what I ordered along with a glass of merlot.

That means same fantastic beer and even root beer!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,2,2,5,tY5-w1JEtlIr9HrpykzOfw

We were staying at the Hampton Inn and the hotel driver suggested this place as an easy option to get a decent dinner. The restaurant side was closed for the night, but the bar area stays open 24 hours and always serves food. I must say, the food was better than expected from a smoky bar. It did the job and a refreshing beer helped. We could have ordered pizza to our hotel room, but this as a better option. I'd go back if I was in the area.",x9SbZ_7sP0JobHl-No9R9w,3,1,4,pFwJOrilnoJKAP1yLtxiXg

Mom and I usually get the steak special but I haven't had anything bad here.  I have tried the chicken fingers, potato skins, breakfasts and brownie dessert. Everything has been a win so far! The prices are good and I never leave hungry. 

This is one of my preferred bars to munch at. :)",rpWCcNQD7nGVUYoU6vzCFw,0,0,4,VrcFrur-hGak0yBnWwpDkw

My mom and godmother go out to eat with their husbands quite often, and this Village Pub location is a favorite of theirs. I always found this interesting, because they are all very picky, and I figured pub/bar style food wouldn't be their thing. 

My mom decided she wanted to go here for Mother's Day breakfast this morning. An odd choice I thought, and I wasn't sure if I could bring my daughter in, but she reassured me I could, and I was up for trying it out.

I was pleasantly surprised the moment we walked in the door. There is a cozy restaurant completely separate from the bar, and I LOVE the decor!!! It brought me right back to Old Vegas, which I love so much! It honestly looked more upscale than I was expecting.

It came time to look at the menu, and I was pleasantly surprised at the breakfast options, as well as the prices! You really get your money's worth here, and the food is great! Our waiter was wonderful too... such a warm and pleasant man... I wish I would have gotten his name.

I'm so glad my mom suggested we come here today... I predict we will all be back many times!",Rg5nSgIU0bKVy4A-t9-Usg,0,0,5,2NBqBS_imDg8OgfthkKf6Q
5847969,2013-04-05,2,CAxHrXoPrbf0e0AYFPhv6g,"Vegas has the advantage of giving us Two Worlds. One is the world of the Tourist Elite; The finest hotels, clubs, amenities, entertainment and dining are all here for them... and we can enjoy some of them on occasion to ""splurge"". The other world is our  world; The ""Locals"" World. Casinos with better deals and smaller lines. A room for $30 when you don't feel like driving home. Fremont Street when the Circus isn't in town. Bars and clubs with 1/2 off specials and table/bottle service that doesn't cost a car payment.
 And a 24 hr bar/ fine enough dining venue for a 24 hr person. That place/s is the Village Pub.
Their Steak and Daily specials are not to be outdone in price or quality. The room gives you a ""Classic Vegas"" feel with big red booths, wood trim and a service that makes you feel like you ARE the Big Wheel in the room.  The sports bar is sealed off so no smoke to affect you. They have locations all over town so there's always one nearby. And the prices? The way I eat (BIG)... you can sit , eat well and enjoy for what you would be paying at McDonald's. Nuff said.",AStHl7m__BTiheHzpXvmRQ,1,0,5,8vN7wvQGHnoZPFrnLSfSRg
5894085,2010-11-27,1,CAxHrXoPrbf0e0AYFPhv6g,"Yes, I know it was the day before Thanksgiving, but having 2 people on staff, which seemed like they were the cooks as well is unacceptable. First it took us 5 minutes to get seated. The dining room is no bigger than 2 large bedrooms put together and there were only 5 tables occupied. Finally someone showed up and sat us down......10 minutes later we are asked for beverages......10 minutes later they arrive. Let me remind you that everyone as either waiting or eat and their were only 5 table occupied!!!! I was out with my bf's family and we sat soooo long waiting to place our order, my bf had to get up, walk back into the staff area and ask someone for ice cream or something sweet and quick because his father was going into a dangerous level of hypoglycemia. The delivery of the ice cream was the fastest service received that night. After seriously an hour, we received our food. In the mean time a couple sat down, wait, waited, waited, and go up and left. If the food wasn't good, I would have sprouted horns and become the customer from HELL!! Lucky for them the food was satisfying enough to sooth my rage. When asked for refills, they never removed our old cups and soon all the multiple cups of 5 adults crowded our table. The food was good and cheap, but the service was MUY MAL and I will never eat here again. Crappy service is worse than crappy food and to top it off, they weren't even apologetic about their horrendous service speed.",YyfIAWAdJhdwO0_xyiVkUQ,3,1,1,rZ_Im0Pb0XiJCqskuJl0qQ
5905078,2012-02-01,0,CAxHrXoPrbf0e0AYFPhv6g,"Better than average food for a bar.  Good prices, especially for their specials (some of 'em not advertised).

Steak and Eggs breakfast is specially priced before 11am on weekdays and before 2pm on weekends, but their coffee sucks... really bad.

Orange Roughy is great.  They also serve the best fried chicken in LV, however I'm not sure they sell it anymore.

Service is haphazard... which isn't a bad thing.  The same waiter that serves you probably won't be the same person that brings it to your table.  It's more like a team than an individual server.",T2y6TokoIIhXniks0ifCTA,0,0,4,VG_BlahstUNgBohXzctwmg
