Worst experience of my life. I would not recommend this place to nobody,ELqyBuPLKFHzULljjt2iLw,0,0,1,etMQ5EZq2bQsXzk5U0ok1g

603190,2015-09-24,0,S0yP4IZmwVpeqxSe0R2Fvw,Way over priced. Girl taking our order was extremely rude and pushy.  She did not even give us a second to think of what we wanted on our subs and gave an attitude as if we were holding back this big line. We were the only customers there!!! Avoid this piece of trash establishment. This place is a disgrace to the subway franchise.,kBs3wAdejG9GA1uHN8QVZg,1,0,1,tTzLoDG_gaF1nPL8Od6pKg

This is a rip off!

Not a typical subway!

Expensive!  More expensive than usual subways!

Jacked up prices!

Long lines to pay double or triple the usual subway bill.

I can find a thousand better and cheaper places in Vegas.  Even if plowed under, you could manage better!  There is a McDonalds next door that has typical McD's prices. Go there.

Stay away!",_SOtTEyFAyMM11pyd-6QGg,1,0,1,-E5-wgKjya_uGL24yRJMLQ

Giving one star due to the $$$$, holy cow, highway robbery, just wrong.!!!!  $29 for 2-foot longs, 1-six inch and a drink...",KEcHrihlI3fn_4J13F2z_A,1,0,1,mRYwhCSYc2SDXaL5hrt0sg

Price: $10.83 for a tuna foot long (no guac or extra toppings)

Service: took 1 minute before the sandwich artists stopped chatting with each other and greeted me. after the sandwich was made, it sat on the counter for another 5 minutes before one of the 3 sandwich makers checked me out for that outrageous price.

Veggies: wilting. weirdly whitish. 

Location: depressing.",2DfFsw2S5a2KqzqkIF8MWQ,2,0,1,nenBfAYSD7extGYV4sXExg

They were making face while making sub sandwich as if we are annoying them by telling them what we want in our sandwich. They just ruined the mood. If possible avoid this subway. In addition to this, sub is expensive too than the other subways I have been too!",KOSxlEm93B0r6KPBmpaOdQ,0,0,1,wA1JA8yX_7jNGJElmcUNKg
4273538,2014-04-17,0,S0yP4IZmwVpeqxSe0R2Fvw,"Super expensive but somehow there was no option in Circus Circus for veggie eating folks. 
The staff is rude. I asked them to change their gloves because they had just served meat and they literally started throwing stuff inside the sandwich. Although we were the only ones in the restaurant that time, they started hurrying as if it is crowded. Service is very poor.
The dining area was not clean.",Z6ppH2rKrhtZGiEV286SsQ,0,0,1,Lput2A6ZWlr7mJHEB6uMvQ

5939851,2017-05-15,1,S0yP4IZmwVpeqxSe0R2Fvw,This subway franchise doesn't participate in Corporate Subway promotions. Their price of the sandwiches are inflated at least 25%. Now if you have the Circus Circus Player's Club Card you cannot use your points here. Customer service is dismal. This has to be the worst Subway in Las Vegas inside the worst MGM property that they own. MGM really should sell this property like yesterday.,HAx6BZefc86jPtbgivE1sA,1,0,1,fe25cf7njWuAgJdtUGzZlw
