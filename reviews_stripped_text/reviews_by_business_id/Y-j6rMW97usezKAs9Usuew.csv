Zucchini sticks were bland and cold in the center.  Pot pie tasted like celery and there was 4 small pieces of chicken, also cold.  The meatloaf is the worst thing I ever eat, cold and hard... No amount of pasty gravy made it edible.     Then the check came and I was so angry that I wasted that amount of money on worthless food!",wEY8mnSM6P1v0PAwNcN_GQ,1,0,1,TTRIs9DtR9U8QB4nqpynlw

This is my 2nd time giving this location at the Suncoast Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas a try.  I went for breakfast around 10am on a Wednesday.  Service was absolutely horrible.  No one seemed to care.  I overheard servers complaining to each other about other customer complaints about the food.  The prices are outrageous!  I wanted a simple eggs, bacon, & hashbrowns with a side of pancakes combo like you would normally get at any other breakfast restaurant, but nooooo!  The only way you can get that is a hidden special on the back of the menu that only offers 1 egg, bacon, & 2 pancakes for $10.25!!!!  If I wanted hash browns I was told that is an additional $4.25.  $4.25 for hash browns that should already come with the meal?  Really??????  Plus the cup of coffee was $3.00!  Ad all that together plus tax & you are spending well over $20.00 for a breakfast of 1 egg, bacon, hash browns, 2 pancakes & coffee.  Think about that for a second.   I don't care how good the pancakes are supposed to be.  That is highway robbery!!!!!  That made me angry plus no one cared to serve me after I made my comment about the price & the lack of being able to put an appropriate combo together so I got up & left.  They didn't even care.  I will not be back.  Went to the Bagel Corner in the casino instead & had a great breakfast for a decent price!",q6jteRunPErj7P-JDhVz4A,4,0,1,Pg3idXT334PeSlE70MTmcQ

First, how could there be a line when at least half the tables were available.  I mean cleaned and ready for customers.  It was 15 minutes before we were seated.  Then another 15 minutes before a server, not actually our server, came to the table to say our server would be right with us.  This server did take our order and we waited 20 minutes for the food.  Presentation was so poor we lost our appetites.  The manager said it was a bad day and three people were being let go at the end of the day.  Not information we needed.

However we were pleasantly surprised.  Our served was very friendly and the food was excellen. We had pancakes and French toast and did not disappoint. It was in true Dupars fashion as they make the best pancakes and French toast and was just like what we grew up in at their So Cal locations over the past 45 years.

211920,2016-06-08,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"My wife and I have dined at Dupars twice with several friends and family members so I've had a chance to try a few different dishes.  While the pancakes were good the other dishes we've tried weren't.  On my most recent visit I had an open face turkey sandwich, my wife had the french toast and my father had the hot tri-tip sandwich.  My turkey was dry and the gravy was cold.  My father's beef was dry and tough.  My wifes french toast had not been soaked in egg long enough and was plain bread on the inside. When paying our bill my father was asked how his meal was.  When he informed the cashier that his sandwich wasn't very good she replied that she had also tried the beef and agreed it wasn't good, she also whispered that there had been other complaints.  Glad to hear that at least the food is consistent.  Not sure why the management wouldn't want to do anything to improve the situation but based on what appear to be a quickly dwindling number of diners it doesn't seem like this place is long for the world.  The poor quality and apparent lack of desire to improve is even more annoying given the prices for what is simple diner food.  It's hard to imagine why the Suncoast dumped their own coffee shop to bring in Dupars.  While the old coffee shop was hardly high end dining, the prices were low the service was friendly and almost everything on their menu was better than the equivalent dish at Dupars.  I guess the Suncoast must have made what they think is a good financial deal to bring in Dupars; too bad they weren't as focused on providing good value to their customers.",Rdqn24QoxtkOQKNqRyyY8Q,1,0,1,ReWjoP_A2mPpZ7TlCR4sgg
306558,2016-06-29,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"We tried this Du-par's location inside the Suncoast Casino for dinner and we were  disappointed.  I know that Du-Par's is known for their breakfasts, but their regular menu looked pretty standard so we decided to try it out.  

We waited for at least 20 minutes before someone acknowledged our existence (we actually had to flag down a server), we were given water and coffee and we sat again for about 10 minutes before our order was taken.  I will give props to our waitress, she was only person on staff that seemed to know her way around a restaurant.  

When our food finally arrived, it was sub-par.  I ordered a hamburger and the meat patty was gritty, meaning I had to remove at least 4 major hard objects from the patty (Yuk!).  The coleslaw was tasteless and contained way too much mayo.  The onion rings held some promise, but they were undercooked.  My dining partner tried the Turkey Ruben and seemed to be pleased with the sandwich (hence the two stars) but not the coleslaw.    

I have eaten at many Diners, including Du-Par's in LA, and one thing is common to all, you get your coffee cup re-filled constantly until you have to say, No More Please!  Not once during our meal at Du-par's did servers walk through the restaurant with a coffee pot and re-fill customer's mugs.  This is just basic diner service that people expect.  

I was hoping for a good outcome here, and I really don't write bad reviews unless the experience and food is sub-par and overpriced. I felt obligated to warn others and recommend visiting any of the many other nearby restaurants before considering this place.  Also, for the  late-night breakfast special seekers - despite it being in a casino, there are no deals offered by this Chain restaurant.  So don't bother unless you want to spend a fortune for pancakes at 1 am! 

A note to the Suncoast Casino:  There used to be cafe style restaurant here, it offered was tasty, quick, and relatively inexpensive food AND had a second menu offering Chinese food. I don't mind change, but was hoping change would mean a better dining experience!",uLp2Rz4Jpy4FA3NsTnOZ6A,3,0,2,FutfX4nP7MAgRdyHv9BsGw

We went for dinner it was okay I found the food to be Bland I got the pot pie filled with potatoes and sauce not much more or anything else, I thought I saw a couple peas and maybe a carrot or two and about 3 or 4 pieces of chicken. My wife got the eggs and chicken fried Prime Steak...she liked it ... but we were both kind of sticker shock with the prices on the menu... side of hash browns 5.95..  so 26.00 bucks for just her breakfast...my pot pie 16.00...2 sodas  ..6 bucks.

Waited another 1 hour until we got our food. Food was cold and bland. A table in front of us was complaining to the manager that the food was cold and they don't have time to wait more because they already waited hours for their food.

446178,2016-06-02,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"I confess.  I am passionate about pies and other freshly baked delicacies. As a kid growing up in Los Angeles, everyone seemed to have a favorite neighborhood bakery that was so special that your mouth would water just thinking about it.  For pies, (and great breakfasts) my go-to place was always Du-pars, and remained so for more than 40 years.  Now, my family lives in Vegas and what passes for a piece of pie is often found at a buffet--and it is usually pretty awful.  Imagine my delight when I discovered Du-pars has recently (less than 2 months ago) opened in the Suncoast Casino on Alta, and is open 24/7!  A recent visit confirmed that their pies still have no equal.  They also feature great breakfast items 24 hours a day, but on our visit we decided to try some dishes we normally would not order at a ""coffee shop"".  We had salmon and a New York steak dinner.  We couldn't have been happier. Salad was fresh and crisp.  Vegetables were just right--not overdone and mushy.  My baked potato was piping hot and cooked perfectly... and my steak was one of the tenderest and most flavorful I have ever had.  I tasted my wife's salmon to see what she was raving about and it, too, was perfectly executed and delicious.  The best part?  I had a great steak, salad, vegetable, potato, coffee, and an incredible piece of pie for less than the price of an ala carte steak at a steakhouse.

737924,2016-04-16,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"Was happy to see a new restaurant opening inside Suncoast.  We were unhappy that we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated, although there was only one couple in front of us.  The problem was that the hostess is also the cashier, and she had to check out 4 parties who wanted to pay before she could seat anyone.  It appears she is also the pastry clerk.  A couple was waiting to buy pastries, but they finally left after waiting quite awhile.  We waited another 10 or 15 minutes to order our meal.  The waitress was unfamiliar with the menu items and couldn't explain what certain things were.  I guess understandable since they've only been open a week, but you would think all the help would have been trained better and given a taste of each menu item that might be different than mac & cheese or a burger.  Took another 15 or 20 minutes to receive our food.  My mashed potatoes and vegetables were almost cold, but the meatloaf was hot as it should have been.  Du-par's touts they are famous for their pancakes, but if you order them, you don't have the option to order a side of eggs, ham, or whatever.  Also, if you order a regular egg breakfast, you don't have the option to have a pancake instead of toast.  We were not given a dessert menu or given any options so have no idea what they have other than pie.

770251,2016-08-03,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"A 72 year old Las Vegan that has eaten in many casino restaurants.  This was by far the worst food and service I ever experienced.  Five of use visited Du Par's at the Suncoast Casino.

First, service very bad.  We ordered bar drinks and after 15 minutes asked what the problem was.  Response was ""they are on the way"".  After another ten minutes we asked staff to check in the drinks and waited about 10 more minutes before he brought them.  Oh, the place was not busy.  

Second, the table setting was with the cheapest paper napkins made.  And, when drinks finely arrived they were simply put on the hard table which let wet water from the glasses run on the table.  No coasters.  We had to ask for extra for soak up the water and no help offered.

Third,  the food was worst then the service.  Only one person would rate a 2 star and the rest a 1 (only because you can't leave the rating blank.  We were not asked if we wanted a salad with the meal.  Anyway, I had halibut that was very dry but I ate it because I was hungry.  My baked potato was probably the best food four of us had.  I usually like the potato skin but it was so incrusted in salt I couldn't eat one piece.  Speaking of salt, all the food was very salty.  Also, I like pepper on my potato (I never salt anything) but the shaker was encrusted with dried pepper and whatever I had to retrieve shakers from other tables.  My wife and two others had salmon which was tasteless and drenched in some sort of sauce.  The menu should have stated ""served with ??? sauce"".  With the salmon was mashed potatoes with a horrible gravy.  The gravy had looked like jell on top of a canned ham.  It was also very salty.  The veggies were way over cooked and simply dumped on the plate.  Back to my potato.  I came with sour cream and three foil wrapped butter patties.  The sour cream was in a small plastic cup which was okay.  The butter patties was laying alongside my hot potato.  By the time it reached the table the butter was beyond soft.  One hell of a job unwrapping liquid butter and getting it on the potato.  Even McDonalds serves butter in small cups like the sour cream.

The bottom line is worst eating experience ever in Vegas.  I can't believe the Suncoast would have such a poor quality restaurant.   Maybe a good manager would help. If I can't get a okay meal at a casino I simply will not visit casino.",38DgfkBmmVuWhcC6oVOkZA,1,0,1,qvmRpQmSFFd2AzKI-9wWhQ

We didn't order that, so he took it back and we waited for another 35 min for the steak and eggs.

Having already sat there for an hour we were just ready to get the hell out of there, we didn't want to wait another 30 min for them to remake it. Server said he would take it off the bill for us. When we were getting up to leave the gentleman who seated us came over with a plate of food (us thinking he remade it for us on the house) and rudely said what is wrong with your steak and eggs? You don't want it?! After explaining what happened he said to us you are still going to pay for it! Ummm are you effing kidding me!!! How rude!!! We told him we are not paying $25 for that and the server said he would take it off. We were so stunned how rude and inconsiderate management was about the whole situation!

It was so much better than the type of omelette you get at a Denny's or IHOP - it was slightly creamy inside - not undercooked, just perfect.  most places nowadays, anything with scrambled eggs is rubbery & overcooked - but this was about the best omelette I've had in quite a while.  it came with hashbrowns that had a little more flavor than most others - I have a feeling they may cook them in butter...and the toast came with blueberry preserves, very nice.  the only tiny complaint i have is that they do not have any salsa.  i like salsa with most any omelette, and salsa is actually the number one most popular condiment in America now, so i think they should buy a bottle or 2!  however, they really did try - since they had no salsa, they made me a small dish of fresh pico de gallo - isn't that great?  our server was very nice, friendly & attentive.  we will make this one of our regular spots.  can't wait to try the pancakes.

Crisp edges, melted ""real"" butter already poured on the pancakes, warm syrup, lite texture and the overall flavor will make you a repeat guest.
If you order coffee, the pitcher is left for you to help yourself when needed.
The coffee here is above average.

Honestly I've had a lot better hash elsewhere there's is made into a thick patty and is definitely on the dry side. Our toast was also very dry the bread was probably getting old. However the best part of the meal was the short stack pancakes loved the crispy ends!!! And their homemade strawberry and blackberry jam was remarkable, super fresh and tasty perfect spread for the delicious pancakes.

Suncoast made the right decision to put in a good name but who ever it was that decided to use a classic traditional well known name like Du Pars was out of their minds if they did not follow a formula that made this name famous in the first place. i guess i missed the part where Du Pars sold out to some one who has no idea what they are doing while running a good name into the ground. i can't imagine that if this place ever served a good breakfast it must have been back in the 50's or 60's when people had brains & good taste. the pre opening hype last year made me think that they were going to do something exceptional & original. the reviews speak for themselves and this many people in agreement that this place is a flop is an accurate representation of the service & quality this place offers. there's plenty of places in vegas that serve good american food & the people who write reviews on yelp* have a good sense of right & wrong.",nbr1n6nOWT0wHPl7U4voPg,1,0,1,5fUZyQedd1RQBr2FQrZByA

This little gem started in L.A. in the 1930s, and has a few locations throughout that area. They expanded to Downtown Las Vegas over a decade ago, and recently created this outpost on the northwest side of town a couple of years ago. While the downtown LV restaurant had recently closed down, tourists and locals alike can still have the opportunity to try these one of a kind flapjacks.

What makes the Du-Pars pancakes so much more different and better than it's competitors? It's very hard to put into words. It's simply the perfect pancake in terms of its flavor, and texture. They are fluffy and moist on the inside, with moist being the key word here. There is a slight crisp to the outside as well, which doesn't exist in other pancakes. The pancake is not too sweet, and the flavor is complex. It's truly a work of art. What I also like is that it is presented with melted butter, which also elevates the flavor of the pancake.

(Quick tip: ask for the boysenberry syrup to go with your pancakes, you won't regret it.)

While you are here, grab a slice of pie, they are very well prepared. I would choose Dupars pies' over Marie Callenders any day of the week, and to be quite real with you, it's hard getting a decent pie in this town. 

This place is also open 24/7, and while I do come in at weird times to this place (between night and morning, I'm not too sure what that's called), the service every time has been friendly and helpful.

I know that this place gets dogged on their other menu items. I have not tried anything besides the pancakes and pies, so I cannot comment on any of their other offerings. But if you want the best pancakes you'll ever have in your life, and some outstanding pies, then Du-Pars is the spot for you.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,22,23,5,U8WIlt7NkmN-kMd9fYfUhA

Once it arrives- big disappointment. The beef stew looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. Gravy was dry around the plate. Would be nice if it came with bread or something to soak up the excess gravy. I got a side Caeser salad. So salty and my breath still reeks of garlic a day later! The corned beef hash patty was soooo salty and DRY!!! Such a disappointment. It crumbled as you tried to get your fork in it. We all tried 1 bite in disbelief of how bad it was.

The servers were extremely professional (but not unfriendly) and great at their job. Now for the food: First off, the dinner roll. What the hell?!?! That thing was so delicious! Few places pay any attention to such a small detail, but customers (and especially foodies like me) notice! As I said, I'm in love! For dinner, boyfriend ordered the Bacon Swiss Burger and I ordered the Country Chicken Breast dinner. The food came quick and the food was plated nicely, you can tell they take pride in what they serve. The chicken was moist (an impressive feat for thinned out and fried chicken breast), the gravy had sausage in it (rare nowadays!) and the mash potatoes were perfect as were the sautéed fresh veggies.

The sandwhich was like 6 small sandwiches put together to form this colossal sandwich of mouthwatering fresh ingredients. There were no saggy tomatoes and no dead lettuce.

 A colleague ordered their traditional ceasar salad. He finished it all so it must have been good. We also ordered their famous pancakes.

Let me tell ya, biting into that sweet buttery-soaked pancake was like biting a piece of heaven's clouds. Its like you left sin city and stumbled upon taste bud heaven. This pancake was so fluffy, that it expands in your mouth all the while packing a punch of flavor. Once the flavor is all soaked up,, its now ready to melt into your mouth.

The pancakes were excellent.  Thankfully they have a 3 pancake ""Vegas stack"".  2 is too few, for me, and 5, ridiculous.  

Here's the issue.  At full price, the 3 pancakes cost $10.  You can walk 100 feet down to the buffet and get the buffet for a few dollars less.

We used to frequent the one downtown and even though it was a pain in the ass to get to we still enjoyed the old school vibes and of course people watching on Fremont!

I always order the same thing...two egg breakfast with bacon and hash browns and we split a single pancake for dessert. Something about their food just tastes better than many other joints serving the same stuff. Real butter? Fresh eggs? Real potatoes? Freshly squeezed orange juice? Warm maple syrup? Not sure but it just works for us. 

If you haven't tried the pancakes here I highly recommend at least getting a single one just to see what I'm talking about. Hands down the tastiest pancake I've ever had.

This place is pricier compared to others but I can taste the difference in the quality so it's worth it. I also don't enjoy coming over to the Suncoast and smelling like cigarettes.

For my full stack and a side of hash browns, I paid $15. The waitress was super nice, but it took much longer than one would expect to get a plate of pancakes. 

I agree with other reviewers. The Suncoast had a great cafe before that was always busy when we went. If you are going to replace it with something else, they should at least offer some awesome specials. I couldn't get a plate of pancakes with bacon and eggs because it was after 11. I couldn't sub a muffin for a pancake on any of the other breakfast because they wouldn't allow it. For a place that is known for their pancakes, they should offer them as a side choice to any breakfast meal. This is Vegas for goodness sake. We can go to any casino and get a great meal for less than $15. I was so excited to see Dupars in the Suncoast (a place I go to often), but I would rather have the cafe where I could get an awesome prime rib dinner or a ham steak and egg breakfast for way less than I spent on some pancakes and hash browns.

This restaurant is located inside of a casino, which for me, kinda sucks. I'm not a fan of casinos and restaurants inside of casinos. I don't know why but the fact that I have to make my way through a slot machine maze and pass a slew of table games to eat aggravates the shit out of me. I instantly feel manipulated. 

If any of the other restaurants on this list are inside of a casino, I will not be checking them out. I prefer mom and pop places with local owners and local customers. The casinos make enough money. They don't need to make my breakfast dollar.

Anyway... 

After parking the car a half mile away from the entrance of the casino, and waking another friggin' half mile through the casino to get to Dupar's,  I was ready to sit down and enjoy a good meal. 

The place was understaffed, and even though most of the tables were empty, there was a line of people waiting to be seated. We waited a good ten mi it's before being seated. The hostess told us they were short staffed and I get that, but again. The casinos and the businesses within them should always be prepared. Customer service is key in the casino industry.

We asked for a booth because Dupars has HUGE plushy red leather booth chairs that look like the old time classic vegas decor. We sat down and I immediately felt hugged by the feel of our booth. It was comfy!

The breakfast menu is slim. The menu has both breakfast and lunch items on it because again, this is a casino joint. Casino joints have to cater to all, but I was shocked that only two short pages were dedicate to breakfast items. The rest of the menu was for lunch and dinner fare.

There's a history blurb written in the menu about Dupars opening in the 1920's. It also mentioned that they were known to have the best pancakes in the world rated by Esquire magazine. So of course we ordered ow pancakes! We wanted to see what all the fuss was about. 

We placed our order and everything came to the table in a decent amount of time. The pancakes were HUGE, but nothing about them was special. The sausage was typical run of the mill pork sausage links (they did t have patties) and the syrup was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

Antonio was our waitress and she was great. We loved the waitresses old timey uniforms, but honestly, the only thing that was good in this place was the waitresses attitude, the old timey uniforms and the giant red booths.

 Once we were in our booth, it took about 10 minutes for someone to take our order. 
 The prices are way out of line for a locals' casino restaurant. Fourteen dollars for a cheeseburger? Really? My wife ordered the country fried steak ($26) I ordered a patty melt ($13.50).
 One hour later, we were still waiting for our food when the waiter comes up and says there was a ""mix-up"" in the kitchen. Maybe the POS needed a reboot? He took our order again and said it would be right out.
 We did receive an order in about 5 minutes. The patty melt looked OK, but nothing to write home about. My wife's ""Country Fried STEAK"", looked pale and pasty. When she cut into it it was chicken, not beef.
 We decide to leave. I asked for a manager to explain how totally disappointed we were in the service and the food. Got the standard ""what can I do to make it right"" speech and i explained that we had spent enough time there and would not be back.

They tasted good until I got eggshells in my pancakes. A large piece that should not have made itself into my pancakes. A rookie mistake by the cook. You crack eggs into a bowl and then add to batter in case shells get in. The next thing I got later in the day was a cheese Danish to take to my room for breakfast. Big mistake. The Danish was hard and tasted stale and had very little cheese. I doubt they were made fresh that morning. I suspect they were made off site, frozen and thawed out each day.

As we are always looking for new breakfast options in the Summerlin area, Du-Par's offered a seemingly simple, but quality homestyle menu with delicious baked goods.

I passed a billboard on the way home one day displaying a stack of butter soaked pancakes with syrup poured over them. They looked amazing and the sign stated ""voted best pancakes in America"". Although I'm definitely a waffle man,
These looked excellent and I noticed the restaurant was in the Suncoast, which is not far from my house. Since then, I have tried the pancakes a couple times, a spaghetti dinner, and fish and chips. All the food was excellent, but Du-Par's has a very bad issue with the service end of their operation. 

From the very first interaction with the always rude host staff to the unattentive, uber-relaxed paced serve staff, each visit always leaves us with an annoyance to speak of over the drive home. The servers are so slow, it's unexplainable. Where do they go? Every single time they disappear.  On multiple occasions, the credit card machine has been down. There are ATM machines in the casino, but those withdraws come with a fee.

We will be back to Du-Par's. The food reminds me of home, and I love a good bakery case. I just hope they focus on the service end of their business, because people living in this area expect more.  

Other note: if you see a baked good you want when being seated, order it immediately and have it boxed to-go. Don't wait until after your meal, because it will more than likely be gone. As stated before, Du-Par's has a great bakery case and when something is gone, it's gone.  The cinnamon rolls are BOMB!!",09TLMTWynFwmHwcUl53ytg,1,0,3,Wr65_JhHl6mvhNPp5_Usjw

Having diet restrictions I asked the waitress what I could replace the fries with.  I was going to get steamed vegetables if that was an option or coleslaw.  I was told that I could only replace a potato selection with another potato selection.  The first place I have EVER had someone tell me that.  I said I couldn't eat potatoes and was told that was the ONLY option.  With everything else being closed and being with a friend I didn't want to get up and go to another place with a less restrictive accommodation to dietary restrictions.  I asked for more time and looked over the menu and found something else which was dry and tasteless.  What a mistake for the Suncoast to put a place like this in where they used to have a fairly decent cafe.  I will NEVER eat here again because of the lack of flexibility when ordering and the food being overpriced and below average.

We get our food 25 minutes later. The spaghetti was hot but the meatball was cold so we sent it back to get it remade. 10 minutes later they send us the same spaghetti but reheated. We know this because original came with 3 meatballs and we tasted one and it was cold and the ""new"" one came with 2 meatball and a fork mark. We flag down a manager and he apologized and said theres going to be a compensation for the inconvenience. 10 minutes later we got our new spaghetti with corrected meatballs. 

After we were done eating, we go to the cashier and we asked about the compensation the manager talked about. The cashier flags down the manager and then the manager tells us the compensation is ""remade the spaghetti.""  We paid and left angrily.

We go to the suncoast customer service to complain but they tell us that Dupars is not owned by Suncoast so theres nothing they can do about it but encouraged us to write a comment card so the suncoast head boss can see it.

Just shocked how bad it is considering the brand name and history of the So.Cal establishments.  The manager did make it right when my parents did not eat their food and took it off the bill.

And it's unbelievably expensive. $3 coffee that is barely on par with gas station coffee, $3 ice tea that has got to be the weakest tea on the planet, a toasted sandwich where the bread was cold and hard, limp and soggy coleslaw drowning in sauce, and pies with so much sugar they were barely edible. 

If I could give a restaurant negative stars, Du-pars would qualify. There seem to be nothing fresh on the menu and I believe I could supply a restaurant from Costco and it would be better. 

Don't bother complaining to the staff; when they ask how was everything and if you say anything less than something complimentary, they have no idea how to handle that kind of feedback, they will just stare and say ""sorry."" 

Really! 

Sorry! 

Du-Pars CEO, Biff Naylor, and Suncoast General Manager, Kerrie Burke, should be embarrassed. They should shut the place down and sell off the equipment and furnishings because the restaurant is a failure!

I know that because one of the promotions going on for a limited time is to pay for certain meals an amount that is equivalent to the time you arrive between four and six.  There are 5 selections and you a required to buy a drink.  The choices aren't things I normally get.

Another limited time promotion is 50% off when you pay with slot club points, any day, any time of the day.

I had been to Du-par's in the Golden Gate but I was never blown away by supposedly having the best pancakes in the world.  I looked over the menu and decided on their chicken pot pie.  I was brought the iced tea I ordered quickly and a short time later the pot pie arrived.

A bit different in shape, this was oblong in a boat shaped dish.  There was a good number of chicken pieces, randomly cut.  The pieces weren't identical cubes.  The sauce was fine.

Pies are the thing that Du-par's does well and there's a wide selection.  For dessert, I had coconut cream pie, something I hadn't had in a long time.

The meal was OK, service was good, and the 50% off made the $15+ price palatable--no pun intended.  I'd return for a sandwich or just some pie but this isn't a place that I'd make a regular stop unless I was at the Suncoast.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,11,3,6-ExH0qaDvmivEnkP110rw

I heard about Du-par's before and it being an institution of sorts in California since 1938.  Well I think something was lost in translation when you folks moved here to Las Vegas!  Needs work!

The wifey and I were on a late date night and kept hearing about Du-par's just opening on our side of town.  We figure we'd go in for dinner.  But a big red flag awaited us - a brand new restaurant, barely a month old...with no line, and more than 90% of the tables EMPTY??  That should have been our cue to move along and eat somewhere else.  But we thought to just give it a chance, how bad can it be?  Ugh..wish we just turned around and left.

Service was slow.  Even with no one in line, and only 3-4 tables being taken, it still took us 10 minutes to get a booth.  Not cool!  Thankfully our server was pleasant, although looking a bit bored.

We got the menu.  First thing that caught our eye.  The prices.  The friggin' prices!  Not kidding here, their prices are easily $2-4 more on entrees than your average diner like Denny's or IHOP.  Really, your food Du-par's..is that special?  I felt like I might as well have gone to a place like Cheesecake Factory right across the street because yes, the prices on Du-par's food is near the same.  Wow!  This better be some great food with huge portions!

Maybe it was what we ordered.  But I refuse to pay that much for a cheeseburger, let alone how much I paid for my damn sandwich.  But no, the food really did not impress us, especially for the price point.  Famous or not, I don't care, I will gladly take my @$$ to TGI Friday's to save $10 on my check.  Jesus.

We didn't even order 2 full entrees because the prices are so whack!  So we ended up ordering to share:

-Du-par's 'Legendary' Buttermilk Hot Cakes (short stack) with melted butter & maple syrup
-Classic Triple Decker Club - Roasted turkey, bacon, avocado, mayo, lettuce, tomato on your choice of bread & served with fries

Food didn't take long to come to the table - but was our experience so so so AVERAGE.  The club sandwich was just not one of my favorites, it was really just OK.  Dry, not enough mayo, and the bread wasn't toasted enough.  Lettuce and tomato were soggy in parts too.

Needless to say the standout were the hot cakes.  The were tasty - buttery, light but at the same time rich, and had great flavor and texture.  But honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to come back to Du-par's again for these hot cakes.  Nor do I wanna deal with the prices.  Do you guys know I can go to Denny's and get a huge Grand Slam that comes with coffee & juice...for only $8?  Now that's a lot of food.  These 2 hot cakes barely fed the wifey & I...and they cost the same.

Our bill after tax for just our two plates of food came out to $27 and change!  Without tip added! OMG!  So expensive!!  I'm a value guy (OK maybe bordering cheap) and for me this is low in my book.  Not enough food for the money.  In a place like Las Vegas I can go to another 5 dozen places easy at this time of night and still get great food for way less money.

And sorry Du-par's, that's exactly what I did.  Haven't been back to you since.  You got an extra star for the standout hot cakes, but it will be a while before you get my business again.  Famous doesn't always mean good.  Infamous is what I'm thinking now.

4054714,2017-02-10,5,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"We were excited to hear that Du-Pars was coming to this side of town last year. In fact, it's almost a full year since they opened in the Suncoast Casino.  The downtown location is a lot busier, a lot smaller, and just a pain in the butt to go to. This location is much more convenient. 
I have never had to wait in line and the food is just as good. My advice to all first timers is to get their hotcakes.  Their hotcakes is regarded as one of the best ever. The secret to their stack is the amount of butter they throw on it. It's completely drenched in butter, which is why you'll never have a dry or tasteless stack. It's good. I'm just not sure if they're the best all time. The rest of the food is your typical breakfast items that you'll find at any other breakfast joints around town. The portions are big and there's something for everyone. My typical meal at Du-Pars is their Burger Patty Breakfast. This meal is an 8 oz. burger patty, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast.  And of course, I'm throwing in a small short stack.  Price really depends on what you get here.  We have a lot more places serving breakfast in Vegas with a much lower price ticket. As for service, it really depends when you go.  The weekends seem to be the best since it's busier and there's a lot more employees working.

4491426,2017-02-01,3,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"I've tried Du-pars for both breakfast and dinner but I think the breakfast and the desserts are the clear winners here! 

Let's start with dinner shall we? I chose Du- Pars Ultimate Trio ($16.25) where you get half of a sandwich, soup or salad, a choice of French Fries , potato salad, fresh fruit or cole slaw  and a dessert . I chose the Corned Beef sandwich even though I had the waiter rate the sandwich selections and the one I ordered was towards the bottom of the list along with the tuna. The tri - tip was what he suggested but I ignored him and was disappointed. My sandwich had thick tough slabs of corned beef and mustard...that's it ...no tomato ..no lettuce ....no mayo either. I personally thought I could have made one better at home. I happened to be there on Clam Chowder night (Wednesday & Fridays) so I tried that it tasted a bit too fishy for me. The potato salad was okay if you are expecting eggs, mustard etc in it you will not find it in this salad. 

The Blueberry Cream Cheese pie deserves a whole paragraph dedicated to  it's deliciousness! There are certain tastes that bring us back to childhood some may say Grape Hubba Bubba gum...Pez but one of mine would definitely be a blueberry cheese cake that my aunt brought over from Philly. I never thought I would ever taste a cheesecake more delicious so for most of my adult life I have shunned cheesecake till the moment I tasted Du-Pars cheese pie. It is a light pie so it doesn't feel as heavy as other cheese cakes . It took me to a place where playing Barbie dolls and reading Bop magazines were my life! That pie was euphoric!! 

The breakfast is also tasty! I ordered the legendary  short stack which is two hotcakes ($8.25) . I always say I'm not a pancake person but the buttery cake with a little hint of crispiness on the edges were so good! I wouldn't pass up the pancakes here it would need to be one of my main dishes. The blueberry muffins had real blueberries , the banana cream pie was heavenly! 

The breakfast and dessert here is a must!!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,4,4,-4T3DsMSC-VaTyRLgsc_9Q

The filling had very small pieces of carrots, peas, and celery and was mostly potatoes and white meat chicken. It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever and the gravy was thick as paste! The server was very friendly and professional, I complained to the cashier on the way out and he refunded half of my bill.

Boyd Gaming and the Suncoast totally misjudged this business decision.  The apparent outrageous rent is reflected in the menu prices.  Without a complete overhaul of the menu, reducing prices between 25-45%, this restaurant will never be successful.  Drop by at lunch or dinner to visit a Ghost Town.  You can't judge a restaurant by the reputation of its pancakes (even though my friend's pancakes contained egg shells - management even took pictures).

Sad a salad has to leave you hungry; pathetic a bacon, tomato and avocado sandwich on two small slices of toast costs more than $14. Sad you have to reject fries because they are almost raw inside.  

Sad du-Par's is of poor value.  Sad that the Suncoast did not convert their restaurant real estate into three sections:  coffee shop, Chinese, Mexican.  Even the Briggs restaurant is near 'sub-par'.

My family wanted breakfast for dinner, so we ordered the following: full-stack French toast with blueberries,full-stack pancakes, and three orders of hash browns. The total came to nearly $35.

The pancakes were nothing like the perfect pancakes that I had repeatedly experienced at the downtown location. I didn't even get the clarified butter on the side. In fact, they gave me the cheap butter with the gold wrapper. The only good thing about the pancakes was the warm maple syrup. 

Our hash browns looked so good. A little crispy on top, but soft in the middle. It's a shame they were extra bland! Even ketchup could not make up for their lack of taste.

5356612,2016-11-03,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"Since the Cubs last series game was on the casino's big screen, we decided to first have dinner at Du-Par's.  We had read the advertisement for ""Beat the Clock"" dinner specials from 4-6:00 daily (if you arrive at 4:00, you pay $4.00).  We walked into an almost empty restaurant at 4:30 & chose one of the big red booths.  Service was immediate, but here is what they don't tell you:

You must each purchase a $3.00 beverage & we chose coffee & tea (it was dark Lipton).  The coffee came in a small cup with Du-Par's on it & then you must wait til' it's refilled by a server.  We ordered  ""salmon on a bed of spinach w/red potatoes"" & spaghetti & meatballs.  The white sauce contained no spinach, there were 2 small pieces of potato, & a miniscule piece of salmon.  My partner's spaghetti & meatballs contained 2 tiny meatballs that tasted of just ground beef & small portion of pasta that tasted of Chef Boyardee.  His was accompanied by a half white toast & mine w/o bread or roll.

Du-Par's regular menu for B-L-D is expensive & espec. for a big coffee shop.  Even the pies in the case look anemic in size & they brag they're made fresh daily.

Perhaps this restaurant reminds oldsters of the good old days, but for us it was just another rip-off.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,3,0,2,AQ_alfZ9XGPH14SB6dXtTg

As a food writer, I pray to find places like this where everything is made home made, and attention to detail is evident every where you look.
Du-Par's bakes the best banana cream pie I ever ate,  and Leo was in agreement too.

5653832,2016-11-08,3,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"My hubby and I had got up early a couple Sundays back to get our hike on before others had awoke. On the way home we were starving so he asked if I wanted to stop at Dupar's for breakfast. I had this place bookmarked so in we went. I had no familiarity with this restaurant at all. Evidently it has quite a story out of S.Cal. 

Our server was Desirae and she was terrific. I never had to ask for anything as she anticipated all of our needs and that is what I like when I go out to eat! We ordered the avocado, apple bacon omelette with Swiss cheese and a short stack of the pancakes. I also had two glasses of the freshly squeezed orange juice. It was so GOOD!!! There were not a lot of people dining at the time we were there so it was rather nice just being able to relax after our hike.

Our food arrived shortly after ordering and the omelette was very tasty. Of course, they could have provided more avocado but for some reasons restaurants never give you enough avocado! Onto the star of the show.... The pancakes! Oh my!! These pancakes were beyond good, they tickled my taste buds something fierce! They were dipped in a butter sauce, add the syrup and bam so damn delicious! I have never had such light, fluffy and flavorful pancakes. They were epic and unforgettable. All
I can say is I can hardly wait to return for more. Like all
good things, I must eat them in moderation and after I have earned them post a good workout as I know they are not without massive fat and calories! I have read other Yelpers reviews of this location and most prefer the downtown location.

My party ordered a house salad, chicken pot pie, a order of chicken tenders that came with fries, and strawberry milkshake. They were all disappointing unfortunately except for the house salad. Everything else was pretty awful... I took a bite of the chicken pot pie and had to spit it out because it was chewy. I only ate one of the chicken tenders, packed the rest, but ended up tossing it once we left the restaurant. The milkshake had a hint of flavor, but it tasted watered down. I was so sad...

Besides the food, they had timely and friendly service. But since the main purpose is to eat when you go to a restaurant, I'm giving the place a 1-star rating.",CS6YDEJWD4HNB6U86T_5rA,1,0,1,pC96MpI5dhQlCeK42HQeaA
5675531,2017-09-25,0,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"I originally took my hubby to the location in Downtown San Diego when we visited last year, and he fell in love with the pancakes. He claims they are the best he's ever had. He was really excited when I told him that there is a location in Vegas. I am just disappointed that Du-Pars is on the other side of the World from where we are in Henderson and wish there was a closer location.

Du-Pars is located inside the Suncoast casino. We parked in the garage behind the hotel and the restaurant was pretty easy to find. Like most places in Vegas, I hate having to walk through a smoky casino to get food. I wish more places like this would open stand alone locations, but I understand the draw of opening in casinos.

They are open 24 hours (I believe), which is fantastic if you have a late night craving for pancakes! We've only been for breakfast and we've both always enjoyed our meals. The service can be a bit spotty and it takes forever to pay your bill (since you pay at the host stand). I feel like they are always short staffed and should have someone seating guests and another up front settling checks, instead of just one big line of people.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,3,-P1RSnsCxIVXSK-SQrZb-g

My other associate ordered the fish. It was dry and the breading was greasy. 
The third person in our party ordered the eggs benedict, and thought it was very good.

Our review is probably moot, because only 20% of the tables were occupied at 7pm. If that persists, they probably won't be there for very long.

I have to say the clam chowder is the bomb!!
It had big pieces of clams and was creamy. Good stuff!
4 stars because the breakfast wasn't the best. We ordered omelets,  they weren't too bad except when you order 3 cheese I would have expected  a lot of cheese but there wasn't a lot.
And it said homemade hash browns well they are far from home made. They seemed like a deydrated kind and they just don't cook enough the outside is crunchy but the inside are not the best tasting.
Service was pretty good, the waitress we had was good she was on top of everything.
She did tell us that the pancakes were awesome there so that maybe worth trying.
Would we go back? I'd say maybe on a Wednesday or Friday for the clam chowder again and to try something else for sure!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,12,8,4,OjrLKEkqvyvKb4e1ziTStQ
5821415,2016-06-13,2,Y-j6rMW97usezKAs9Usuew,"Wow, so stoked that there's a Du-par's in Vegas besides the one in downtown. For those of you who are unfamiliar with their food, they're known for their pancakes. The batter is different than any other pancake I've ever had in my life. It's got a slight chewy texture, and the flavor is amaaaaazing. 

It's a bit pricey (almost $10) for a short stack of three pancakes, but totally worth it. 

I really liked their hashbrowns (asked for extra crispy) eggs, and their pork sausage links. The corned beef was delicious. 

Awesome service! 

I'd definitely skip their muffins. They taste rally strange with a bread-like batter rather than a fluffy cake batter. I also got recommended to eat their biscuit, but it looks like a brioche bun and totally threw me off guard.

Either way, I will always be back here for their simple, amazing buttermilk pancakes.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,9,2,5,j9IBgVBkz3T1bEcm_UiWTg

Tiny servings of lemon chicken, broken egg  yolks, buttered toast--when I asked for dry toast---long waits each time for ordering and getting food...and a prancing, gloating manager who was doing nothing to help the chaos that was totally destroying the work of the wait staff....at one point they brought me a side salad littered with debris and lettuce leaves turning brown....I called over to the preening manager and told him his salad sucked big time---he took it came back five minutes with a good looking salad.....so far TODAY....we were seated promptly, and got water promptly, and the waitress took our orders within 9 minutes of sitting down...now waiting for our food. I ordered a side salad and it arrived promptly and it looked like clean food and tasted good.....oh their young manager showed up....he's about 7 feet away from me...we made eye  contact and I know he saw my dirty empty salad  plate just to my left arm....and he just kept gossiping with the cute ladies at the cashier's counter....one waitress serving seven tables and the manager is not helping bringing the food orders out...the waitress is literally running between tables.....

I don't get it I see lots of service personnel at the back area at an alternate cashier machine...why does it appear only one busboy and two waitresses actually working...well the food arrived...it was probably cooked on time but NOW everything is just WARM food.....nothing like congealed cheddar cheese on my wife's cheeseburger....or her ""what must have once been delicious French fries but now have that warm not so crispy taste texture ANYMORE....

if I had known this we should have gone to In-N-Out for our cheeseburger and McDonald's for our Fries.  We ordered two pancakes...and NO they no longer have that sky-high fluffy look  OR that indescribable buttery sweet taste.....my Ham n Eggs were just barely warm...the sunny side up eggs didn't look like the described Extra Large eggs--just normal large eggs served yucky warm....the ham steak was large BUT cooked DRY---brought home most of the ham steak for the dog  He won't care cause he didn't have to pay $11.99 for that meal..
