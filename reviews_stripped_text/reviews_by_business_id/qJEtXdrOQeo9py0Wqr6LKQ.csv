But this location on Durango needs some serious help in the service department.  We have given them a try 4-5 times now and every single time the service has left a lot to be desired.  

Today I went to go pick up my online order (which should only take a couple minutes) and the cashier was so overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to handle a customer complaint that she literally left the cash register and didn't come back for several minutes.  All the other employees were standing around, looking at the growing line and shrugging their shoulders going ""We don't know where she went.""

That was only one of the several stupid things I witnessed during my 15-minute struggle to get my online order picked up.  I don't care how much closer this location is to my house...

It is great tasting fairly priced pizza, located conveniently near by. Huge amount of toppings and cheeses, generously doled out with a friendly smile. The folks behind the counter were friendly, well trained and appeared to enjoy what they were doing. So unlike lots of places in town, these young people seemed to have pride in their product and their work.They have been well trained. Only one thing was lacking. My wife and I were both very disappointed to learn that at the end of the ordering process and while paying for our order, we get the news that they were out of wine. We are retired seniors and enjoy wine with our meals. Being OUT of wine is an indication on a Saturday evening shortly before 6 PM of poor management.
Not that there is a shortage of vino in the area between the liquor stores and supermarkets minutes away in the same center. At the very least there should have been an appropriate sign in view prior to having customers wait In line to place their order and then only at the end to learn there is no wine in house. We will go there again but inquire about wine availability BEFORE we get on line.

1001651,2018-02-17,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,Food is good and staff works hard. They need to figure out a better method to handling a rush of customers. Waited in line for an hour.,Ya9zn32Qeb-X9CUHyhVgSQ,0,0,4,ebAjO8yKhJkvzHvdYwydTg
1012077,2018-05-08,1,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,"UPDATE: Since someone felt the need to tell me that ""they weren't slow on ""Pi day, the customers just didn't know what to order because they were all new,"" let me just reiterate that while their Pi day wait was exceptionally long (2.5 hours for a relatively short line), their wait time is ALWAYS horrendously long. Always. I have literally gone when there are fewer than 10 people in front of me and it still takes 30 minutes just to get to the place where I order. I have watched the employees MULTIPLE times take their time. They are very slow and I don't know if it's because they are new, not well trained, or have been trained to be slow, but it's definitely not solely the customer's fault. In fact, it has been my experience that most people seem to already know what they want to order. But even if there are customer's who don't know what they want to order before they get to the front, it seems that if you're consistently having that problem and it's significantly increasing your wait time, then you should figure out a solution. Have a larger menu, have signs encouraging guests to have their order ready, offer menus so people waiting in line can plan, have signs explaining how the process works. Lots of potential solutions. Don't sit there and blame the customers. Do something about it. 

I actually went a few days ago because they offered double flame day. That was when there were fewer than 10 people in front of me and it took 30 minutes to get to where I could take my order. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised at the short line (had it been any longer, I would have just left). And then it took 30 minutes. To get through less than 10 orders. I shouldn't have been surprised.

Anyway, in case you're just wondering if my experience on Pi day was an isolated incident or a serial offense, I'm just updating to say this happens every single time. So buyer beware, if you're going to Blaze, be prepared for a longer wait than you're expecting. Really no less than 30 minutes + 5-10 minutes to get your food.  

----------------


I love Blaze pizza, their pizzas are delicious, and totally worth it. However, the reason for my low review is that the wait time is ALWAYS absolutely horrendous. Even when it's a short line, it takes way too long to get people thru. I don't know if it's just this location or what, but every time I've gone to Blaze at this location, the staff are just incredibly slow, making the wait long. 

I think this location did not have Pi day planned out well. I anticipated a long wait, but I didn't anticipate this. We waited 1.5 hours, and we were still over an hour away from ordering. So if we had stayed, we would have ended up waiting 2.5-3 hours. You'd think they'd be prepared, since they were offering pizzas for $3.14, but clearly they were not. Bummer. 

And yes, I do acknowledge that any time a company has a great deal going on, there's going to be a longer than normal wait. But I'm pretty sure literally every other similar style restaurant (Cafe Rio, Chipotle, Zupas, etc.) would've had their stuff together & gotten people thru quicker. 

I guess I just keep hoping this place gets better with their wait times, but I'm pretty much givin",hN5gz8s11EXRuxkKG7q-Zw,0,0,2,hbqJ0jmgRPLxCXECmBS3NA
1021502,2017-05-30,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,"I write this review now, based off an experience I had awhile ago... 1/20/17 to be exact. This was before I started yelping and I actually sent in an email to the specific location on that night, but never received a reply or acknowledged. REGARDLESS, the reason I write this review is because I could not let an employee go un-noticed. I have worked in a fast pace pizza joint myself and I know the stress employees are under. 

My family made an order and my mom being the overachieving mom she is- she got a salad for her meal because she is trying to be healthier. Well, when I picked up the order and went home there was no salad. She was DEVASTATED because she worked all day and just wanted her salad. So being the marvelous daughter I am... (; I drove back for her. 

An employee -Glenn- greeted me immediately to ask what was wrong. He heard my concern ((which was calm and polite because again I've been in this position and they were so busy) and made it his personal priority to stop what he was doing to ensure I got what I needed. He was attentive, worked with a purpose and had a great attitude about it. The manager then came over and offered some words as well as a free pizza card. (This wasn't necessary at all, but they insisted). 

This was my first time ever to Blaze and I will be back again JUST FOR this great service. 

Mistakes are meant to be made, and it happens. 
More people need to realize this. But if you can acknowledge a mistake with grace and handle it... you're an even better employee than someone who does something perfect every time.",3BjkwAISuKTymGrNBDUO8Q,2,0,5,tn9c2ZsTOctny8LVX-Rlxw

My girlfriend and I initially came to this location one night after work because we wanted to try it. Little did we know it was one of their very first few days of being open so the line was out the door and into the parking lot- kind of a madhouse. We decided to try one of the other locations (Decatur) but that line was out the door too! We were hungry so we were going to wait through that line, if it was that long the food has to be good right? Right!

Fast-forward a few weeks after this location's opening, and we've come several times (2? 3??) and the pizza, service, and atmosphere are all reasons we can't stop coming back! 

The prickly pear agua-fresca is a unique drink option along with their selection of lemonades and Blue Sky cane sugar soda. Prices are decent, we get out at around $23 for two pizzas- one on a high rise (+$2) and two soft drinks.

The experience of making your pizza is extremely fun and easy. Choose as many ingredients as you want and watch them pile up. Extra cheese? No problem.

In the past 4 months I have eaten at Blaze at least 3 or 4 times a month. (Yeah, I know, I know...) I try to go in the afternoons/evenings because that is when Asia is leading the shift. Any other time I have gone, the employees are either rude or seem... dead inside? And most of all, if Asia is not working, they WILL burn your pizza. Now some people like burnt food, but I prefer everything I eat to be just cooked (or even light cooked). The first couple months I ended throwing/giving away three pizzas. By the fourth one, I finally asked for a remake. Since then, if Asia sees me, she always checks the guy on the oven and I haven't had problems. 

Made the mistake of going in during the day earlier this week. Took forever even though there were only three people in front of me and no one behind. Had to deal with the same surly attitude (from some tall guy without a name tag)... Made sure to tell four different people to cook it light... and of course it came out burnt. I didn't have to say anything because even the employees were frustrated - I think they could see the disappointment in my face - and gave the guy on the oven a hard time. But yet again, I had a burnt pizza.

If you want a good experience, go early afternoon or late evening. However, if Asia is working, I will say the line will move fast even if it is out the door.

I wish the tables had napkins on it rather than finding the communal napkin station. Aguas frescas were delish and not too sweet. The pizzas are thin. The flavor was good.

Fast forward a few months, 6/5/17, I walk in around 6pm and the place is somewhat booming but no line. I get in line and the first guy to greet me was very nice and welcoming. The girl who stepped in next was very sarcastic and rude and overstepped the first guy, saying ""No!""when I said I would like the thick crust pizza. She said about the first guy, ""he's just to nice to say no."" Meanwhile the first guy held a smile and could tell he really did not appreciate the girls words. She then proceeded to criticize me for getting half of the classic red sauce with half spicy red sauce saying, ""what, can't handle the spicy one?"" In a very snooty tone. I dismissed it and continued. She then went on to help other guests and the next guy to help me did not seem to want to be bothered. He could have had a bad day, but still. He looked down the entire time and did not say a single word, making me feel awkward for basically speaking to myself. Not very personable. He then put my pizza in the oven and walked away. The cashier was friendlier than the rest and made small talk, which made me happy because at least not all of the employees were rude. My order was made to go in less than 10 minutes.

2318579,2017-02-08,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,"Really impressed by Blaze. I'd waited a while to give this place a shot, even though I live less than a mile away, but I'm glad I made the lunchtime trip on a whim. My only previous experience with ""fast-fired"" pizza was at a PizzaRev located in Henderson. I felt like it was just alright compared to what I'd heard, so I was hoping that the reviews here weren't just hype, and they definitely weren't! 

Highlights:
- The menu. Their suggested/specialty pizza menu has a good variety of tastes and serves as a helpful framework for exploring their options when you're a first-timer, like I was. 
-The dough. So, this is pretty much always going to be a preference thing, but I lean towards softer, thicker crusts when given the choice. The default crust here was a perfect balance between thin & crispy and doughy. 
- The pricing. I like simple pricing, so Blaze is right up my alley. $7.95 for as many toppings as you want. That's hard to beat. 
- The drizzles. At the end, you can add a complimentary drizzle over your pizza, and I was pleasantly surprised by how many options for drizzles there were! A great way to finish off the perfect pie :) 
- The space. I went during prime lunch rush time on a Wednesday and there was plenty of seating and the line paced really quickly. 

Stuff that wasn't my jam:
- If you're indecisive or a first-timer, you may feel a little rushed. The staff doesn't really make you feel that way, but with how fast the line moves, you may want to wait to step in line until you've got a good idea of where you at least want to start. 
- The seating area, while spacious and well set-up, looks to be geared towards bigger groups. So if you come solo or with a friend for a quick lunch, you might end up taking a big table and feeling bad about it when a family walks by. 
- Parking. There's just not a ton of spaces near the entrance. Granted, there's plenty of spots nearby, the ones right in front of Blaze are mostly handicapped spots. So, unless you've got that pass hanging from your rear view mirror, expect to walk a bit.

Overall, I loved my lunch at Blaze. Decent price, great taste, and great service from the staff. I'll definitely be back!",fFGs67RhFZEsSPEXT_5wpQ,3,0,5,C71xFwDlzN-durx8EphvqA
2323321,2017-05-17,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,"The food here is pretty good...been twice and the pizza is nothing incredible, but it is definitely tasty enough.  It is not super high end pie or anything but it is certainly not little Caesar's.  The price is acceptable for what you get...the place is not cheap but is not super expensive.  The main negative issue here is the wait.  We went to this place LITERALLY 3 times before we ate there...on each occasion we went in, waited anywhere from 2-5 minutes and decided to leave because the lines were ABSURD and moved terribly slow.  The staff is largely comprised of high school kids, which starts becoming problematic when you see them talking and BSing a ton.  I am all for having fun at work, but when you have lines almost to the door, you need to be working fast and not screwing around.  For a place that supposedly cooks your pizza in a matter of seconds practically, there is no real excuse for the line to move so slow.  We almost had written the place off entirely, but on the 4th try, the line was short enough that we managed to get through.  If I could get in and order lunch/dinner and be seated in under 10 minutes, it is the kind of spot that I would return to but with a line requiring 15 minutes PLUS just in line..no thanks.

We love the pizza here, and appreciate the vegan-ability of the options, but the last time we were here, we accidentally got bacon on our pizza. I understand that probably seems pretty silly to most omnivores, but it was borderline traumatic for us. Like, boom, dead animal smokehouse on your veggie pizza & 3 hrs of trying to wash the flavor/memory away.

I presume it happened because the veggie-section is done after the meat section, instead of vice versa, and some little stray bacon bit came along for the ride from somebody else's pizza into like, some spinach or whatever that we got.

I actually might cry, because this is the only pizza worth having this side of the Mississippi, and now I'll prolly have to settle.

Maybe use some tongs/a utensil for the veggies? I dunno. I'm just gonna go cry now.",D9m4JQ7bM-or5sw54L5Dhg,0,0,1,pb-881o_0WORsTEThKQ-aQ

My family and I love love love Blaze Pizza because it's inexpensive, tasty and the service is always excellent. The only downfall is how freaking busy this place can get! However, when we came to pick up a pizza to go, the line was pretty short (about 5-7 people). It was a Wednesday afternoon and they had just opened the place for about two weeks. 

When you first walk in, it feels like a chipotle but with pizza options. You pick your dough, sauce, cheese and toppings. As you make your way down the line, you get to build your entire pizza to your liking. Then it's baked in an pizza oven, which is why it's so freaking tasty! The dough is always perfectly cooked in a pizza oven. 

We got our usual gluten free dough with marinara sauce, sausage, mushrooms and artichoke with Parmesan cheese. But you can order whatever you want. There's 50 different meat, vegetable and sauces for you to choose from. If it fits, they'll put it on! Remember though it becomes more difficult to eat the pizza when there's too many toppings! You can sit down or take the box to go. 

I definitely recommending coming here! If you visit during dinner times, it'll be at least a 30 minute wait or longer, especially on the weekends.

Regarding the menu, it's simple and straight-forward with a few pre-selected ""favorites"" that are standards.  Of course, you can also create your own pizza with whatever you'd like.  

For this review, I just went with their standard BBQ chicken pizza.  It was perfectly cooked, and it was finished quickly.  It was Father's Day and while it wasn't too busy, there was a decent line that they were able to get through quickly.  From the time we paid, until we got our pizza it could not have been more than five minutes.  Top notch! Well done team. 

Wood-fired pizza is pretty easy and hard to mess up.  Having said that, if you have a bad temp setting or someone who doesn't know what they are doing you could easily end up with a crispy pizza that has a soupy middle.  

Happy to say that didn't happen.  Between Blaze and my other standard, Pieology, I would have to say I preferred the crust on this bad boy of a pizza.  

Overall, Pieology still rocks a better BBQ chicken, but it's a very close second here.  

Where this location probably takes over is in service. Fast, friendly and very clean.  The decor is relaxing and modern.  When you pay for your food, you should get a good experience.  If I had to pick right now, I'd pick Blaze.

If you haven't been here before, Blaze is almost like a Subway or Port of Subs for pizza. While they have a preset menu, you can build your own pizza at more of a flat rate. That's nice in comparison to other places that tend to nickel and dime customers for each topping. The original crust is thin but fire grilled, and the pizza comes out fast. The crust has a very subtle but pleasant smoky note due to the fire. It isn't overwhelming though, so don't be afraid! 

What I liked about this spot was that they are upfront and open about nutrition. The menu shows the calories for their set menu items, and their website has a nutrition calculator for build-your-own pizzas. In addition to that each topping label also has its calories listed. You can choose how healthy or indulgent you want your pizza to be. Their selection of toppings, cheeses, and sauces is nice and expansive. Some choices were rather unique that you don't typically see, such as sautéed onions in addition to normal red onion or a spicy red sauce or a garlic pesto sauce. Since it was our first time here, we didn't experiment too much.

We went with a half-and-half pizza. My half was turkey meatball, mushrooms, sautéed onions, olives, bell peppers, and original red sauce. My husband's was more of a meat lovers with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and mushrooms with red sauce. The turkey meatballs are actually really good. 

While the prices are fitting, I think some might consider the size of the pizza a bit small in comparison to some more commercial pizza joints. A part of this is due to their niche. They promise fast, fresh pizza from the moment it's built to the moment it hits your table. The larger the pizza, the longer it takes to bake. The pizzas are cut into six slices, but it is filling. 

I'd really recommend you try this place out. It's a new spot, but the customer service is awesome. Jesse was funny and personable while helping us with our toppings. He even did a little ""salt bae"" performance for us while sprinkling on the bacon. He was so great. They also have some unique drink selections to go with the usual Coke or Dr. Pepper, like Prickly Pear Agua Fresca. They also had a soda brand at the fountains I wasn't familiar with called Blue Sky for root beer, orange soda, and I think a cherry cola.

I managed to score about 8 free pizza coupons when they first opened here, and I took maximum advantage. I happily pay for a Blaze Pizza, though, I've not had a single bad experience, a single bad pizza, a single unfriendly interaction. 

If I had to nitpick about something, I'd say the ricotta could be softer and maybe slightly saltier; if you try for a white pizza or isn't quite right. My opinion, your mileage will almost certainly vary.

If I'm looking for a Sicilian style crust, I have to look elsewhere, but when a really good this crust pizza is on the agenda, Blaze rocks.",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,0,0,5,gGtN0IzeSh-BBmIcRNMJfQ

My girlfriend ordered a salad & there were 6 other people ahead of here ordering special ingredients on their pizza. Her order was complete & just sitting on the counter but, she wasn't (after asking the manager) allowed to go and pay at the cashier; instead she had to wait till all of the other 6 finished ordering their pizza's and paying for them before she could pay which took like 10 to 15 minutes extra. Then, they wanted to over-charge her for the salad. It normally costs $3.95 and that is the price on the menu that u order from; but, when she tried to pay, they tried to charge her $4.95 because they said the price went up a dollar but, they forgot to change the menu prices.

The line was quite long during the middle of the day on Friday, but seemed to moved along pretty quickly. Standing in line I downloaded their rewards app and was pleased to get a free drink on my first visit!

I like that there are several crust thicknesses and sauce choice. We both went with original crust, I had classic red and he the spicy. We dod the build your own because why not! After a multitude of toppings being added, we waited a little over 5 minutes for our pizzas to be done. They came out crispy around edges and nice and soft throughout. The first time we went we both got pesto drizzle, our second trip he got buffalo and ranch drizzle.

I enjoyed the classic red flavor but apparently the spicy just isn't that spicy. I also LOVE the blood orange lemonade and he likes the root beer. 

The place is very spacious and simple design that was appealing. The music is quite loud there and that is about my only complaint. 

Definitely a place I would regularly go to and make a different pizza every time!",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,2,0,5,oqU1jFkZkEKpzkFbltekrQ

Toppings- Blaze has more topping choices. I don't recall seeing roasted garlic or kalamata olives as an option elsewhere. They also have really amazing side or entree salads!! Drinks- they have fun agua Frescas and lemonades!! Efficiency- it only takes a few minutes for your pizza to Cook in the oven so you're encouraged to pay and wait at the counter for it. It gives you literally enough time to pay, full your drink cup and get back to the counter to pick some final toppings. Which brings me to my next point. Pieology doesn't give you the option to finish your pizza off with drizzles of pesto, olive oil, bbq sauce or hot sauce. The arugula though..... is really the selling point for me. 
The cons? Only one. The pizza crust is not nearly as crispy as Pieology ends up being. 
Overall..... blaze will be my go to do it yourself pizza.... however, I'll enjoy a Pieology when I'm near one!",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,3,2,4,Wh9Crdy6GSSpJhlMAbzQJw
5859332,2017-05-01,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,Their pizzas are awesome! I always do the build your own. The crust has a great crunch and taste. It's addict so beware. The staff are always nice.,ids1gkkNKGCCn8M1s1v9uQ,0,0,5,Ddcr3whHVSO6DCgEW1S1yg
5886241,2017-02-05,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,"was very good, had a nice selection of toppings and cheeses. Blaze was a little pricey though $25 dollars for 2 personal pizzas and 2 fountain drinks. What made up for the price was there selection of refreshing drink choices like lemonade mint aqua fresca and prickly pear aqua fresca just to name a couple. Overall = will come again.",H1YDtMpci9ryfX5oNLi6tg,0,0,4,L0dmCT9sKR8wAIy-HOpMFQ

Sometimes there is a wait but not once the pizza is being fired, that only takes a couple minutes. I like how simple it is when choosing my crust and toppings.

Blaze pizza has created a fan when I want an affordable and delicious ready to eat pizza.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,4,XoZQpiCWYg5P254bQRRTdg
5927908,2018-02-25,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,"Very close to a Neapolitan Pizzeria where you get your own personal pizza. The ingredients were definitely top notch too between roasted garlic, ricotta and even arugula! I would love to see prosciutto, but hey, for the price point, it's very good. You won't go wrong stopping in. One other thing I want to bring special attention to is the fact that all of the employees had amazing manners, were professional and polite! It is very hard to find that in this world and that for me really makes it that much better! I will definitely be back!",AapTaQ78p_SpQqj8mySt3Q,0,0,5,dZ-opCrHruzmLCJZMcSa9g
5938416,2018-05-25,0,qJEtXdrOQeo9py0Wqr6LKQ,This place has turned around we had several bad experiences here and stopped going for awhile last few times where good . I have been using their app and for the four times I went I have one flame even tho I have given them my phone and they said it was good I got a email from blaze saying go here four or three times and get a free pizza so I jump on it and I emailed the company to see if they would help me out and just said sorry just another reason I don't like this place sometimes,I9ij14zrH2KmmUrm9Vnjhg,0,0,1,l2TLjsLrYREro7rqRc0-Mg
