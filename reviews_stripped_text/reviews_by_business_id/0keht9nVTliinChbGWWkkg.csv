And for $70 per person (including tax and tip) it should be memorable. ordered individually, had the tortilla, the curried goat, the calamari, and the oxtail stew (the best of the dishes).

I picked a random wine when we sat, which was phenomenal. We ordered a paella and a few starters, and everything was such good quality that I was so surprised at the price. I see people comment on it being expensive but they must not know what people charge for great food. This food is such a great deal. Each dish had qualities that really made me feel it was from a competent chef, and the flavors were spot on. The paella was cooked traditionally, and perfectly.  I would run back to this restaurant to share the paella with a friend. On top of the food quality the front of the house staff were so kind, helpful, and fun.

733169,2015-06-14,0,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"Oh my gosh!!! What a rip off.. Don't expect this resturant to last long... which is such a pity.. Love Spanish food especially tapas including Serrano ham, tomato bread & of course sepia a la plancha which are on EVERY menu in restaurants in Spain. Last two items not on this menu!!

As our friends know we travel a lot to Spain (have a house there) they told us about this resturant and asked us what we thought .....

Well here it is:: 

resturant is nicely laid out and spacious except for our table ..which was facing the kitchen and right beside the waiter station!!! The Sangria was just ok...Costco's sells a better bottle. The gazpacho soup was as good as any I have had in Spain but unfortunately the same cannot be said about the calamari tapas. I really don't know how to describe the taste!! The coating on them was slightly spicy with a taste of chorizo!! As for the size and price ..very small and very pricey!!

For our main dish we ordered the mixed paella..again very pricey for what it was and very very small. Our waiter told us that one was enough for two people ..no it wasn't. One is just enough for one person!!! Very very skimpy on the shell fish plus only 2 small pieces of chicken and 2 slices of chorizo.. Really!! The table next to us (4 people) had the paella also and the dish was exactly the same size as ours!!  You should have seen the portions they each got....I bet they went to McDonalds after!!   However, the taste of the rice wasn't too bad but could have done with more saffron. 

BUT THE SHOCK OF THE NIGHT WAS .......when we received the check!!! 
$9 for a bottle of water!!!!   Not sparkling but flat...I know there is a water shortage in Las Vegas but seriously!!  

I had such high hopes for this resturant, staff were nice including the manageress (from Spain) whom I'm sure is horrified for what passes as Spanish food at this resturant. I can't understand some of the rave reviews this resturant has got except to say that they don't know any better.  
Please don't think that we are snobbish and /or cheap...it's just that we know our food and the Resturant business!!! And NO we are not professional food critics ..we just live to eat NOT eat to live!! And NO we will not ever be going back here nor recommending it to anyone..I'm a great believer in the saying "" Happy about something tell a few.. Unhappy about it tell everyone!!",nJ3CzutV8-PIWKgX9JuX2A,2,0,1,_cAQ5aeDLAoi8DaBAAGpXQ

The chef on the morning news channel gave it high recommendations, last time we take that guys advice.

The Positive- the hostess, manager, waiter and bus boy  were courteous and very helpful. Atmosphere, location and decor very nice. 

 The Negative- the size of the portions reminded me of a funny commercial. We had four tapas and left unsatisfied. Ceviche always comes with chips, I almost went next door to get some from Laredos.  The price for each portion was highly over priced. It made me miss Firefly!!!

And a pet peeve of mine with tapas restaurants is they serve 3 of everything. People often dine in pairs so if 2 people are dining and there are 3 shrimp you end up splitting one in half which is annoying. The presentation of the food was beautiful and the Lamb chops and flan are definitely worth taking note. Would I go back? Maybe.

1352576,2015-05-23,2,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"Horrible food and experience. Went a few weeks ago, but was so bad that it has taken a while to calm down and get rid of the bad taste.  I will try to only hit the main points; from the moment we walked in early and the hostess wanted to give us a table way upstairs in the attic. Told her we would wait for one downstairs, and then automatically she found us one. Maybe we didn't fit ""the preferred demographic"" to sit downstairs. 
Waiter was very nice; but not his fault the Saturday duck special wasn't available on that Saturday night. Many other tables nearby were also disappointed too when told that there was no duck.  Ordered the seafood paella.  Got a pan of greasy, undercooked rice (crunchy) and some mushy seafood.  Waiter never checked back. 
Asked for manager and she said it was fine. Since only opened a few weeks, asked if she might offer a discount for it. Gave us 10%'off cost of paella only, not apps or drinks.
After leaving saw Alex chatting on phone in front of next store business and tried to talk to him. Finally got off phone and told him about experience in his restaurant and he was not interested. 
Told a bunch of friends in other Tivoli businesses about experience over the last few weeks and they said they, too, had the same experience that we did.

1814558,2015-04-10,2,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"My boyfriend and I were talking about paella earlier in the week, and I saw that Tapas was opening, so actually went on opening night. So there may be some glitches that could be sorted out later. 

The good: everyone from the hostess to the bartender to the servers were very friendly and seemed genuinely excited to be there. The space is nice and comfortable. One of the dishes, Manchego cheese on toast, was excellent.

The bad: the rest of the food was just ok. We had the mixta paella and an over-salted dish with cauliflower. This would've been easier to get over if it had been reasonably priced, but it was outrageous. The paella was $56 for a serving that was allegedly for 2 people, but seemed skimpy. Our Union Jack beers were $10 each. Our bill, before tip, was over $100 for paella, 2 beers, and two tapas. This kind of cuisine is supposed to be pretty casual.....have some drinks, sample small plates, chill with friends. In an interview, Stratta said that he hoped to create the kind of simple but delicious food that people will eat 2-3 times a week. For that goal, these price points are way off--much higher than neighboring Brio or Cantina Laredo.

Nice dining room and patio, and the service was decent, but the food was terrible. 
Chicken croquettes - these were just wrong. They tasted weird and had very little chicken inside.
Charcuterie plate- just meats and bread. No mustard or pickles or anything. The chef should be ashamed to send this out of his kitchen. 
Baked clams - only 5 on the plate for $15, soooo not worth it. Over cooked and rubbery.
Papas Bravas - not crispy. Sauce didn't taste good.
Shrimp al ajillo - this was sooo small. The shrimp were cut up into little pieces. I bet the whole dish only had 3 actual shrimp.
Curry lamb - 3 small medallions for $15. Under salted and very fatty. Sauce was ok.
Bacon wrapped dates - these were good, but not great.

2614542,2015-04-29,1,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"Read about this new Tapas Restaurant in the RJ and my wife and Iove Paila.  When we arrived at Tivoli we saw this beautiful picture of Paila in the plaza and couldn't wait to eat some.  We ordered the fried oysters and to say they were very small would be an understatement.

We ordered the lobster seafood Paila for two and couldn't believe the pan they brought out.  No clams, no mussels, as shown in the picture, four tiny pieces of lobster and two prawns - both of which were overcooked.  The rice was burned - the little bit that was on the bottom of the pan.  The obvious reason for it being burned is that it barely covered the bottom of the cooking pan.

We have eaten Paila in San Juan,  NYC to SFO and have to say it was always good or excellent.  This was the worst Paila we have every eaten.  

In fairness, we did bring this to the attention to the waiter and the hostess came to the table and asked us to explain our disappointment.  We did and she apologized and said she would bring it up with the chef.  They also discounted $25 from the bill which was the price of one of the dishes.  

Service was spotty and when the waiter brought our bill he simply dropped it off and never mentioned that they had made an adjustment.  None the less we gave him a generous tip - he just served it and didn't cook it. We went home hungry and disappointed.  

Mr. Stratta might get away with these high prices and lousy food in a strip hotel - but it won't work in a Las Vegas neighborhood.

We arrived a couple of minutes late (maybe ten?) for our 7:30 reservation.  Granted, this was a complimentary evening, so people really weren't interested in leaving in a timely manner.  We were served quickly at the bar, and enjoyed our wine before dinner.  We weren't seated until after 8:00 though.  Heard from others the sangria was top notch too.
When we were seated, our server Cripian (hope we got it right) was awesome.  Kept our water and wine refilled, and gave us the lowdown on the menu.  We ordered several tapas plates to start - black kale fritter was my favorite dish, and the baked clams and baked monte enebro were great too, although a little less healthy.  I ate the rest of the monte enebro with a spoon after we finished the bread...
The bone marrow dip was just okay, as were the romaine hearts.  The manchego cheese was simple yet flavor-packed.  My husband loved the ""patatas bravas"" and ""albondigas"" - he even ordered seconds!  The dill/mint dip that came with the lamb curry had me scraping the bowl.
Dessert wise, we tried the churroa and bunuelos.  I thought the spicy chocolate dipping sauce for the churros was great, and scarfed them down.
Overall, other than the initial wait, the experience was great.  Hats off to the chef - can't wait to come back!  Overall 4 1/2 stars - a wonderful first night!",QOPynttPn0m-AWqTEa_zpw,3,2,5,E9H5r3frPir7jgdsGYpZQg

I know I must sound ancient but it was a dish with such a wow factor with the saffron, wines or maybe Pernod favors unlike anything I have tasted before and I so wanted to savor that taste again.  Unfortunately not even close.  Come on Las Vegas aren't you tired of these outrageous local prices and inferior product.  Maybe it's the rental prices but I rather doubt that.  Such a disappointment and we drove so far to try this restaurant.

We had an eggplant dip that was the consistency of sour cream and the seafood paella.  Nothing had any flavor and the paella shouldn't be on the menu.

2996934,2015-06-19,3,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"If you've ever paid $100 per person or more and gotten food and service that are much worse, then you'll understand what a bargain Tapas by Stratta is. We've paid more and gotten less many times, at big name Strip restaurants like Twist, Guy Savoy, Giada, Mix, Andre's, and many others. Compared with Strip restaurants, prices are lower, and nobody in town does tapas or paella better!

On the other hand, if you want huge portions for low prices, go somewhere else. Go to The Cheesecake Factory or Chili's. The negative reviews here all have something in common - people are looking for cheap eats, and they don't understand that the prices are actually very reasonable for the quality you get.

Alex Stratta is no dummy, of course. This is a neighborhood restaurant, and he knows that things are different from what he was used to on the Strip. I've heard that he's lowered prices significantly already, and he's made lots of menu changes as he learns what his customers like.

The paella is the main attraction, and it's absolutely first rate. I haven't had paella in Spain, but I've been to the best places in New York, and Tapas by Stratta is just as good. It helps if you ask them to make it extra crispy, like it's supposed to be, which many people don't know. If the rice is caramelized almost to the point of being burnt, it develops a terrific nutty flavor.

We've had about half the items on the menu in our 4 visits. The flavors are wonderful and bold, and the chef has a keen eye for presentation. These are traditional tapas, very well executed. There are plenty to choose from, and they often have daily specials as well.

The wine list isn't huge but it's well chosen. Service is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is very nice, especially the outdoor patio. We've had excellent experiences every time, and we'll definitely be back regularly!

People seem to either love this restaurant or hate it. Those who love it can appreciate the quality, and they understand that this kind of food isn't available anywhere else in town. Those who hate it - well, they're looking for something else, and there are plenty of cheap mediocre restaurants for them to go to.

My jaw about when I got my first item. It was five small clams dusted with Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs.  $14. It tasted like someone put a piece of clam and garlic toast.  Our second item was some empanadas which were pretty good, but small, extremely small. $8 When I told the waiter that I wasn't impressed with the food, he made no attempt to alleviate the situation. He just said, ""I'm sorry.""  The paella was good.  I would recommend only ordering this. The seafood and chicken was cooked well. The rice had a good crunch. It did not feel overly greasy.

3519427,2015-07-16,5,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"When a restaurant's two biggest issues are price and food, you're in trouble. I never got to dine at Stratta's Michelin-starred restaurant at Wynn/Encore, but expected much from his new tapas place. Dinner for two was over $100, a bit much for the minuscule amount of food served. Some food is decent. There were a couple dishes that I would eat again, like the creamy, fondue-like baked monte enebro and the chocolate almond cake. I loved the alternating layers of soft, spongey cake and the layers of almond cream. But, the portion size of that $7 cake is much smaller than any buffet dessert of single serving dessert from a bakery. If you get four bites out of it consider yourself lucky.

As for the other food... I'd pass on the stringy, chewy pancetta-wrapped medal dates. The three meatballs that make up the albondigas dish were dry, but the sauce was pretty good. Sopping up the sauce with the accompanying toast was the best part. The quiche-like tortilla de patata had an almost rubbery egg exterior that was surprisingly difficult to cut through.

Add to that two cocktails that were pretty good and you have our whole dinner. Leaving underwhelmed and hungry, we can only imagine how soon this place will disappear like most other restaurants in Tivoli.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,14,9,2,of4E-5YPBLRMOzPYYbb9sA

FOOD: Great range of flavors and options on the tapas menu . . . everything that we ordered was outstanding.  I especially enjoyed the Roasted Cauliflower with dates, black olives and almonds.  Manchego, Octopus, Lobster, Padron Peppers and Empanadas were all excellent.  The two desserts we had were off-the-hook: Flan and Arroz con Leche. Looking forward to my next visit and a crack at the Paella!

BEVERAGE: Full bar and modest wine selection with a variety of imported and domestic wines . . . white Sangria was very tasty.

SERVICE: Very friendly and accommodating staff . . . we were seated very promptly, order was taken very professionally, server was very well informed and food was served quickly and promptly.  This was a Wednesday night at 8:30 and the dining room was less than half full but I have a feeling that these folks know exactly what they're doing and this was a representative experience.

ROOM: Long and narrow with a nice bar area and a very large and comfortable patio with big chairs and plenty of space.  Indoor/outdoor bar is a real plus at Tivoli Village.

VALUE: Chef Stratta is one of Las Vegas' most revered and well respected chefs . . . so this is a quality, not ""value"" driven restaurant.  Food quality was excellent and on-par with any traditional tapas restaurant I've tried across the country (LA, San Francisco, New York, etc.) . . . prices are appropriate and wine/cocktails are fairly priced.

Remember, these are tapas - i.e. small plates, so it's like getting slapped in the face with your own wallet and still leaving hungry. And the punch line to the joke - they open at 5 and Happy Hour ends at 6. Yes, it's a whole hour, but I don't see anyone very happy about it. A fact that is not lost on the patrons, as you could count them all on one hand.

And the biggest joke of all, the food was not even good, in fact it was bad. The calamari was undercooked and tasted like dry flour. I am certain they must make something that doesn't taste like you kissed the Pillsbury Dough Boy, but at these prices, one can hardly afford to stick around to find out.

The few workers I came in contact with did not look happy to be there, perhaps it was because the place was nearly empty.

A quick look at the menu can tell you everything you need to know about this place - expensive. Don't bother cracking open the piggy bank for this one.

P.S. Walk a little further down the way to Kabuki, their Happy Hour will actually make you happy.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,21,8,2,ebCeGyJqZK2nPoCDg0y48g

We went to the pre-opening night and met friends that had a different reservation time.  Since the restaurant was so busy, we had no expectations of being able to sit together.  The host staff promised they would do their best to seat us together and went out of their way to make it happen! 

After being seated, our waitress was quick to take our order and we had our food delivered hot to the table surprisingly quick given how busy the restaurant was.  We tried a good cross section of the menu including Saffron Aioli, Patatas Bravas, Stuffed Piquillo, Medjool Dates, Bone Marrow Dip, Moroccan Chicken, and Curry Lamb Kabob.  Everything was perfect just as we've come to expect from Alex.  It was impossible to decide what our favorite tastes were, which became more of a heated discussion after each new dish arrived.

3972372,2015-04-12,4,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"*** Note:  Three of us were guests of PR people for Stratta.  There was no check nor gratuity but was taken care of by our hosts. ***

Six of us ordered a lot of things from the menu and shared everything.  Items ordered were:

Foie gras conserva
Spanish Osetra caviar
Potato 'tortilla'
Roasted eggplant dip
Baked Monte Enebro
Paella Valenciana
Black kale fritters
Fried oysters
Medjool dates
Bacalao
Grilled octopus
Bone marrow dip
Chicken croquetas
Patatas bravas
Saffron 'alioli'
Frozen nougat
Arroz con leche
Chocolate and almond cake
Bunuelos
Churros

The top dish of this meal was the paella. The Valenciana has rabbit, snails, and broad beans.  The rice was crisp on the bottom and the proteins were perfect.  Next in my favorites is the baked Monte Enebro.  The melted cheese topped with caramelized onions and pistachio crust was excellent.  The cheese flavor was strong and the pistachio pieces made a good texture enhancement.  My third favorite was the Bacalao cod.  The salted fish was very flavorful with the olives and fennel especially adding to the flavor.  If you come here, a must would be the frozen nougat for dessert.  It is delicious!

The other tapas plates we tried were good for the most part but there was nothing that grabbed me.  The Medjool dates were good but there are a number of places that do dates just as well.  I found the foie gras disappointing and the bone marrow dip was OK but lacking in the flavor I get from bone marrow from the bone instead of melted into a dish.

The restaurant just opened so I have to give the servers a little slack.  Everyone was very pleasant but it was the little things that pull down my opinion.  We were not given fresh plates during the tasting but got them before dessert when the table was cleaned for the desserts.  In cleaning, a server took my water glass and it wasn't replaced.  There is a lack of bread--toast points, etc.--with the tapas.  While there wasn't much foie gras to the serving, three small triangles is not enough to try the foie and the apricot jam that accompanied the dish.

You're almost paying Strip prices for Tivoli Village tapas.   The meal was certainly OK but I'm not sure I'd come back save to have more paella or nougat.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,4,3,EXyYiG8hSbBdlhd4Oeo3Jw

The downside is the food. We eat out at nice restaurants at least once a week but on top of that we also cook avidly and we are both in the hospitality business. With that said, I feel like the food is quite insulting.
The fried calamari was sloppy, the sangria tasted like water, I didn't see any filet items on the menu whether beef or chicken although they had good protein options for their paellas. 
I think more menu items need to be added and the executive chef needs to take some steps to avoid sloppy plates making their way to the tables. I honestly find better value at Firefly when looking for Tapas.",cee_8_lznPifCmOodouwEw,3,0,2,sU8c7bQVAWk-xbBoLOq9tw

5279542,2015-04-13,3,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"Undoubtedly a beautiful development, the sort of place that seems miles away from The Strip - or even Summerlin, really - anyone who has lived in the Las Vegas area for more than a few months is likely to have heard the difficulties faced by restaurants inhabiting Tivoli Village, yet earlier this week it was none other than former Michelin 2* Chef Alex Stratta who decided to challenge history, his Tapas by Alex Stratta opening in the space formerly inhabited by Poppy Den with a menu that immediately had me thinking ""he's going to do that, there?""

Last seeing Chef Stratta's cooking at his Wynn flagship in September of 2008, one of my first fine dining experiences in Las Vegas, it was just after 6:00pm on Saturday that myself and five others sat down at a small table just inside the lively al fresco dining patio and with service that was exceedingly professional, if not a bit overbearing with descriptions, guiding the rest of the evening a large order was crafted in several rounds, a total of twenty tapas tasted over the course of three hours bookended by refreshing glass of sangria and some of the richest, sweetest sherry I've tasted in ages.

Taking a surprisingly traditional approach to Spanish small plates, the menu divided into six sections with several options available to please most dietary restrictions, it was largely in items from the menu's front side that selections were made and although prices trend a bit higher than they probably should for dishes like the $25 Foie Gras, $10 Croquetas, $15 Fried Oysters, or $18 Deviled Eggs with Caviar and Bottarga it would be a fool's folly to question the quality of any of the ingredients or preparation - each on par with the best versions in town.

Convivial in atmosphere, with plates intended to be shared despite portions that do trend small, other classic options selected amongst savories entailed spot-on presentations of Patatas Bravas as well as Potato Tortilla and although requests for extra bread had to be made more than once both the Baked Monte Enebro with crunchy pistachios and the unctuous Bone Marrow Dip were absolute showstoppers, the former an absolute must order for anyone fancying funky cheeses while the later was silky smooth and complicated without being fussy one bit.

Executing standards like dates as well as octopus with a deft hand, and somehow finding a way to present crispy fried kale as a novelty amidst accoutrements both sour and sweet, diners looking for more bold flavors would be well served to order a plate or two of the unexpectedly chilled salt cod with citrus while those desiring something slightly less 'fishy' should turn their eyes towards the intensely flavorful roasted eggplant with dainty chickpea crisps or the deceptively described ""Saffron Alioli"" that seamlessly pairs soft bread and caramelized onions to light heat and aromatic sauce that saw both bowls eventually wiped clean.

Denied the 'daily specials,' which are not yet ready to roll out on their pre-specified days of the week, it was with much anticipation that one of the restaurant's four signature paellas was presented to the table and showing the gusto of a chef willing to take chances the Valenciana iteration of the dish proved to be the undeniable star of the evening, an enormous portion priced a bit aggressively at $26/pp with both the bunny and escargot shown off in full form, with little done to mask their characteristic flavors, while rice ran the gamut from a fluffy top-layer rife with aromatics right down to the blistered bits that stuck to the pan, a bit of scraping well rewarded with plenty of concentrated flavor that added even more texture and just a touch of char.

Transitioning to sweets with a double espresso on ice that saw itself, like water refills, long delayed it was perhaps unsurprising that desserts at Tapas were mostly authentic old world recipes with top-tier ingredients and skilled staff serving to add panache, and although the airy Bunuelos, perfect churros, and cake tinged in chocolate and sherry were all admittedly quite good it was a trio of spoon soft delicacies that undoubtedly stole the show as rice pudding proved a textural masterpiece rivaled only by Border Grill for best in the city while a chilly semifreddo speckled with fruits and nuts was everything a holiday fruitcake is not - soft, smooth, and something craveable year round.

Still new, with kinks in service and pricing yet to be worked out, Tapas by Alex Stratta faces an uphill battle selling traditional tapas in a development where Brio has wait-times while more innovative spots sit empty or shut their doors, but clearly harboring the sort of passion and talent ready to reward those willing to take a chance with some of the city's best Spanish Cuisine this is the sort of place that Tivoli and Summerlin needs, whether it knows it or not.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,6,3,_6aL7fWO1MzYRzdW5g7SHw

5490218,2015-05-25,0,0keht9nVTliinChbGWWkkg,"I had a wonderful meal and experience Saturday night. I had previously enjoyed a meal during the restaurant's first week of operation while they were still working out the kinks that any establishment has when opening up. Yesterday evening I had noticed on their Facebook feed that they were having a special comprised of a roasted duck confit with a farmers market stone fruit & kale salad. 

Intrigued, I decided to drive over and have another meal. I couldn't have been more pleased. My hostess was able to seat me immediately, made sure to ask my preference and placed me at a table in the main dining area downstairs. My waiter then immediately checked in with me, and I asked for the night's special (which also included a Tumeric-infused vodka cocktail, very effervescent and a great palate cleanser). 

Service continued to be great as I was brought out the special in what felt like no time at all. The meal was what I'd hoped it would be - simply presented yet full of flavor. The salad's sweet crispness was counterbalanced by the duck's earthy, salty flavor. Ingredients were fantastic quality and execution again was precise. I'd only wished i'd had it the first night I was there.

From there, I ordered a number of other tapas on the menu, some from my previous visit like the sweet onion crocas and calamari, as well as new ones like the baked clams. Personal favorites are the albondigas (great meat and sauce combination) and the jamon iberico (you don't know what you are missing). Again, everything was plated simply but elegantly; nothing was thrown together. The flavor combinations though are where Alex and his team's talents really shine through.

This food is simple yet bursting with flavor; this isn't regular bar food that you toss down your throat with a cheap beer. This is fine dining-quality flavor distilled into a relaxed, comforting format that is inviting to any diner. The deserts are also some of the best i've had in the city period. The grilled crepes alone are on point, and their arroz con leche was great. 

However, the personal touch really made last night great for me. I had a chance to speak with one of the managers, Magdalena, who told me about the night's special, how the ingredients were sourced by chef that day, their plans for Happy Hour, etc. She was pleasant and great in listening to my opinions on the food, answering my questions about the menu and representing the establishment with poise. 

I've read the previous review from last night and can say that while I respect her opinion, I wholeheartedly disagree with her assessment of the establishment and think that a couple experiences that don't meet your standards shouldn't bury a restaurant that is still new. I find these reviews of comparison between Tapas and Alex's previous restaurants unhelpful at best; he's not doing molecular gastronomy here, he's been there and done that. He doesn't need to further prove himself. The food at Tapas is comfort food deconstructed and refined yet retains comfort. 

I look forward to coming back here again and seeing what Alex and his cooks create next.",8zJoqM77JfYFHOC41Oc_kw,1,1,5,cj6sCJ03x254Sccm2S2-RQ

One person had the salmon main dish.  We were told it was wild caught, Washington State salmon.  The small sample of salmon was served raw on a bed of inedible vegetable bits.
