I like to go here for lunch, and that is one of the only drawbacks.  It is insanely busy sometimes and hard to find a table, especially when people sit and chat at length after they have finished eating.  A lot of day working people use this as a lunch destination, so it's a bit annoying at times. The service is great, though.  Even at the busiest times, they are timely with the food.  The other detail I'm not crazy about is the kale salad.  Since it's mature kale, it's a bit tough, and it would be nice if they used baby kale or chopped it up a bit more.  Also, sometimes the dressing is a bit lip-pursing and sour.",BC4xcFm-RwukdzkLehpQ4w,0,0,4,WexvdDgQIcha8G152wVLTg

The service is always very prompt and I love that you can get some clean items so you don't feel guilty when eating out. I had the salmon with a walnut pesto sauce that came on the side but I added it on my salmon and it was delicious! It came with two side choices and I did quinoa and grilled asparagus. Minimal to no seasoning which I like as it's better that way. 
Their juices are all so delicious too! Really good sizes and they are nice and thick that you almost feel like you are drinking a smoothie.

I needed a meal to take to work so I called my order in.  I was in the mood for something healthy and satisfying and the dude on the phone recommended the bison cheesesteak wrap.  Got there about 10 minutes after ordering and my food was ready to go. The wrap held up nice during my commute to work. When I finally got to eat the thing I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of meat with the perfect proportion of veggies and low fat cheese, and the spinach wrap added a nice touch. I had it with the sweet potato fries, because hey, we all need to cheat on our diets once in a while. They were bomb too! Will definitely keep this place in mind for quick healthy food options.

I get the concept and I'm ok paying the extra money for quality and service. But they just simply do not staff enough people. We know you are a profitable business (New locations opening). Spend the money and staff your restaurant. 40 min wait for simple wraps is stupid. This happens to me on a weekly basis. I owe a business right down the street and will no longer allow any of my staff to eat here because the wait time is too much. Ive given too many chances to fix the issues including internal complaints to management. You might as well go sit down for a nice leSurely meal at Archis next door at the price and wait time it cost to eat here. No more G&P.

It's not even organic ! Why $8???!? The acai is sorbet and not real 100% acai- you can tell because the sorbet is sweet so they added sweetener into it,
If you ever tested real acai fruit you probably know that's it's not sweet.

This last check in. . .I actaully tried their food for the first time.  Every other time that I have gone, I got smoothies.  More on them later. . .

I got their daily special of Turkey chili with cannellini beans.  TBH, I got it cuz it was warm and I was actually cold that day. . .LOL  But I gotta give them props. . .if you had not told me that it was ""healthy"" I would never had thought that it was.  It was freaking delicious!  The mouth feel was just like a meaty chili, flavor had just the small amount of heat that just made you want to take another bite.  It came with some lavash which added some great crunch to the dish.  I would go back just for this dish.  It was that good!!  And to think that it was acutally healthy for me. . .*gasp*  LOL  (5/5)

The second dish was kind of a fail for me.  I love chicken lettuce wraps and I order their ""RAW cashew"" chicken lettucs wraps.  The look of it was cute.  They served it on little butter lettuce leaves with a little micro greens on top.  The flavor was NOT like a chicken lettuce wrap.  The Texture was NOT like a chicken lettuce wrap. . .and like a dummy I didn't realize until that I bit into that it was a ""RAW"" food which meant that nothing was heated.  So it was a cold mealy scoop of cashews mixed with something on a lettuce cup.  I DO NOT reccomend.  Unless you are totally into RAW foods. . .I am guessing if I was that I might have liked it??  I honestly don't know what I was expecting BUT I was thinking with the words chicken lettuce wrap in it that it would feel like chicken and taste like a traditional lettuce wrap in my mouth?? (1/5)

Service. . .ALWAYS impeccable!  (5/5)

Smoothies. . .including the veggiechino. . .yes u read that right. . .a vegetable smoothie with espresso in it. . .OMG DELICIOUS!!!  (5/5)

So I said okay went to Starbucks and got change I still wanted to try this place despite one red flag. I asked what was in the Veggie Burger he said it's right there on the menu read it, I thought that was very rude as this was my first time here I thought he could tell me. Then I order a Smoothie when I got the smoothie it had a very bad taste and I asked if he could change it to another one as I only took one sip. He said no, so then I asked for a refund he said no.

Standout items include any/all of the salads (particularly the ahi), and my guy digs the ostrich burger (don't forget the bbq sauce!). Love how you can customize everything, whether adding products to the shakes or ingredients to the salads (the tofu is perfect) or opting for a gluten free bun or cabbage wrap for your burgers/sandwiches. 

Location never seems to get too busy but is conveniently located. Staff are attentive, outgoing, and genuinely nice guys happy to make recommendations. Going to try the protein pancakes next!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,20,4,yYWvFnf85CVhuJ3nYnncJQ

Menu item are kinda pricey as expected but it's not cheap to feel and look good. But you can either pay now for healthy food option or later with your health. 

Regardless if you do try them out you won't be disappointed. I order the Cali Wrap with spinach tortilla and no added avocado but the whole meal with tofu fries was under 300 cal. What? Unheard of. The wrap was big filled with yummy grilled chick a bit dry but flavorful. Tofu fries was crispy and on point I didn't miss the potato. I got the green shake with almond milk which was good and creamy. They also have awesome cucumber lemon water which was refreshing.

I can tell you that every location the food has been spot on. They have a nice diversity of healthy options, whole create your own menu section, options for smoothies really enjoy, and never had bad meal. I ended up getting the Turkey Club Wrap with tofu fries. I think might have been the first time getting wrap. The best parts about it was instead of the normal wrap went with the spinach wrap. Talk about giving the wrap not only different flavor and look! I thought was prefect compliment for the whole dish. It had ample amount of turkey and love the dressing mixed in with the greens some fresh tomato. It nice size wrap one that filling. The tofu fries. Fried tofu especially hard tofu. Beautiful thing. It not only healthier but taste better then fries, Not at all greasy. It crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could order whole basket of fries if I cold. The seasoning they out on the tofu is addicting.

You can tell not only from the sign that just opened plus get first review. LOL! It feels new, smells new, and things that tradition with the signage and logo. I believe this is the only location that the menu its electronic. I know the smoothies looked even more tasty. It rolls over couple times or least once. Each time keep showing different smoothie on the menu. It making me thirsty waiting or thinking about what am going order for lunch. I like the menu. They sell different nutrition bars Q-West bars to couple other brands. The cucumber water nice touch. Me not really fan of but hear it not only healthy but not many places that offer it. I would say probably about the same size as the other two locations. 

The service nothing but five stars for me. They greeted us right after entering, offered help with the menu if needed it, friendly, and love the positive vibes. The best part about third location is super close to the house. So now truly if ever need Greens and Proteins fix literally bike down the street or five min drive.

I was unaware of the opening and luckily my coworker called to ask to see when they opened and luckily enough, it just happened to be the day when they had the soft opening.

I have been working in the food and beverage industry for a few years and I know how things work when a restaurant opens up. It has only been a couple of weeks since this location opened up and I have to say that they have been doing a great job accommodating to the clientele, This location is near a business center where major companies are located including: William Hill, Hakkassan and multiple law firms and physician firms. This location is busy! It may not be near a gym unlike the other two locations, but it is still pretty busy. I am impressed with the way the staff is working so hard to maintain great service for a new spot that has barely opened for less than a month. I have to give a shout out to Daniel and the rest of the team who constantly give their best to making a great dining experience!

I have been to the other locations and I have to say that the serving size in the location seems more than the other two. I feel like I am actually getting my money's worth here! I love building my own menu or ordering the food from the menu. The service, the food and the quality is consistent from the other two locations. There has never been a bad experience with me from the food or service. I am very happy that there is finally a location near where I live and where I work!

Upon walking in, the employees are super nice and the restaurant is extremely clean and simple. The menu is placed on the wall and there's also paper menus as well. I wanted to try their jicama fries and their tofu fries and a bunch of my friends recommended that I try the drinks as well!

Their jicama fries have a nice crunch to them and not too much spice or seasoning so I added lime juice to it but next time, I think I'll add chili to it to give it a little kick. The tofu fries were delicious!! Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- definitely not starchy like potatoes but they were good. The seasoning on the outside of the fries was delicious! It wasn't too salty or too spicy or anything but just right. The strawberry watermelon drink I had had a scoop of protein in it and it made it into a creamy shake- perfect as a dessert and a way to get fruits and protein into my body after the workout. Stephan had the margarita pizza and it was delicious too. The crust was nice and crispy and the sauce and cheese to pizza ratio was on point. 

Price wasn't too bad, the 6 pieces of tofu fries are $2.00 and the plateful of jicama fries are $4.00. Not bad considering I don't have to chop and peel to eat jicama. My smoothie drink was I think $5.99 but I added whey protein so it was an extra dollar. Not too bad for clean eating food.

And I love the bison burgers, I go back and forth on the jicama fries or the tofu fries, they are both so good, in completely different ways. The egg dishes are light, and tasty. I have never had a smoothie from here, but I see them making them like crazy, so I assume they are a local favorite.

There is a reason why this company has different locations popping up around the city.
Once people discover it, they love it! Don't miss out!!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,5,2,5,vbRzjL_rO981jlty3V-rdw

Once we got our food and realized we were still missing some food I informed the staff and once again there was no urgency to get us the rest. 

When I asked the staff why our food was taking so long they gave me a sorry excuse. I use to work in the food industry so I'm not stupid. I feel pretty confident in saying that they probably forgot my order or messed it up but instead told me it was the pizza dough.

I've been here twice to date -- once for a coworker lunch and again on a solo breakfast trip. I'm a fan of their Flamingo location since I'm trying to trim down and eat clean. I like coming here since this spot gives me options to choose from outside of ordering salads. On my last trip, I ordered their Green Ginger Limeade (green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, and opted out of the addition of Stevia). I make green smoothies at home and haven't thought of this combo. It's naturally sweet and green grapes and ginger tone down the addition of spinach. It's a quick and tasty way to get your fruits and veggies in.  I loved the blend of flavors and strong ginger kick. 

This spot isn't just for smoothies or fresh juices. They offer up a health conscious menu - sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads and more clean eating grub. I've sampled their bison burger and chicken satay in the past and both have  been tasty options. The have a prime Southwest location and may be found within the shopping center (same one as Starbucks, Cracked Egg and Archie's) on the corner of Sunset and S. Rainbow.  I really enjoy having the option of grabbing a nutritious treat around the corner from our office. My coworkers and I have secured this spot as part of our lunch rotation.

I'm a foodie so in turn I'm also a fatty. Not to say all foodies are, but I am.

I've wanted to try one of these health driven food places and decided on Greens & Proteins and the staff definitely made my visit. They were taking dine in orders when they were closing in 10 minutes. That's awesome. Disclaimer: I wasn't the jerk coming in 10 minutes before closing: I was leaving.

I tried their famous tofu fries with special dipping sauce and a bowl of turkey chili that night.

The first thing that popped in my head was how big the portions were. $5 for 12 tofu fries and $5-$7 for a giant bowl of chili. I took my leftover soup home and it legit filled the take out cup. The chili was the perfect balance of being unique, healthy, and tasty. After I was done I felt fine full but in a pleasant way as the soup wasn't loaded with sodium as most soups tend to be. 

With all that said this fatty felt like this place was approachable. They have a lot of similar items on their menus as other healthy casual dining places in the Vegas valley like wraps, juices, smoothies, and grilled chicken. They also have some stuff that someone who wasn't eating a healthy diet would find appealing.

We had accidentally came across this place I caught a quick glimpse as we were driving to the gym and immediately decided to go here after our work out for lunch after looking at the menu and seeing bison and ostrich! 

I had the ostrich burger and my boyfriend had the bison burger each with a side of jicama fries. It was so good we didn't even talk during our meal! We were totally glued and hypnotized by our meal!

The cucumber lemon water is delicious and fresh. 

My boyfriend had the straight to the heart juice (lowest calorie option) and boy was the probably one of the best unique juices I have tried in a long time!

This place is so good and healthy they aren't afraid to publish any of their calories from the meals to juices to even the sauces. This is extremely helpful for us as we count calories and are very strict with our intake. 

We will be back and are looking forward to trying different things on the menu (however it'll be hard to stray away from the straight to the heart juice)

The management and employees are excellent. The place is clean and has a very nice feel for it. It's quiet and bright. Great for a quick lunch by yourself, business lunch, date with your significant other, even a dinner! Highly recommend!!

I remember my first visit, he was so welcoming and offered me samples of some of the delicious juices. Mind you, this isn't a weekly type of place for me to frequent, but when I do, I'm always well taken care of by the staff. The wait might be long, but you have to remember this is NOT FAST FOOD! This is food with your health in mind as they're grilling away in the back! Every time I take a bite into the food, I just take the love and quality in the food. I could have easily spent about an hour getting this same meal prepared, but I rather have the big guys in the back do their thing! I love the turkey burger with the vegan cheese. I'm no vegan but man do I love me some vegan cheese. Go ahead and charge me that $.90 extra baby, I don't mind! I've totally made it a habit now to get either vegan cheese slices or shredded vegan cheese during my grocery trips. 

The sweet potato fries are also very much made with love. The last time I think they were a bit too soggy, but it's probably my fault for ordering to go and getting stuck in 45 min worth of traffic.

I ordered a friend the bison wrap and there were definitely no complaints there. This place knows good food, and always takes care of you. Last time I went with both my kids, my youngest had a really bad ear infection and was so irritable she couldn't even sit still. The cashier was kind enough to let me sit in my car and bring the food out.

I think small things like that, going out of her way to help make mine easier, are the reasons I come back to places.

Ordered their new taco addition... some kind of steak one. and I really couldn't tell what I was eating. Flavors just didn't work together for any effect.

Their green shake smoothie was also so-so... had better.
Place seemed to have traffic during lunch hour, so perhaps I just picked the wrong items? Would try again but yeah the initial discovery was less than impressive. 

Also, way too expensive for the small portion and the smoothies. I'm from NYC and their smoothie prices rival or exceed NYC prices of similar joints.
