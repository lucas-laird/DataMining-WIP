I got the surf and turf burrito; everything came from a steam pan so nothing was actually hot just lukewarm and when they added on the half cup of guacamole, it all turned lukewarm. And really, who wants that much guacamole on their burrito. The tortilla wasn't even warmed before making the burrito. The chips... oh the chips. Remember that horrible ""baked"" chip fad that hit the country in the mid 90's? Well apparently Zaba's bought out the stock when that product went under. Cardboard. It was basically salted cardboard. I could forgive cheap and disgusting chips if the salsa was any good but unfortunately the fresh salsa sucked. The tomatoes were translucent and looked like they had been frozen at some point and salsa verde was flavorless and disappointing. After spending $30 on a burrito, fish tacos, two chips and salsas and two sodas, I took about 6 bites (I gave it a fair shot) and then went next door to Panda Express. If you want good, fresh, Mexican food, this is not the place. If you want a crappy knock off of chipotle with higher prices than by all means, try Zaba's.",g72B0TkD6sJs-SHZs6mO5A,0,1,1,8Oxm9qvFI27U78P-Lparsg

They were definitely right.  While I think I prefer the quality of Chipotle's ingredients, I like the options that Zaba's has more.

Chipotle has better rice and barbacoa (Zaba's shredded beef is the closest thing), but Zaba's has better chicken and I love that you can get potatoes as well (and they're good!).  Zaba's spicy salsa is really good, too. One cool thing is that if you get one of their bowls but don't get many ingredients they will give you a discount.  I think a chicken bowl is normally around $7 but since I got one with chicken, rice, and cheese only they only charged $5 or so for it.

Everyone told me that Zaba's has larger portions than Chipotle, but I didn't really sense that from the bowls.  Employees are very cheery despite being very busy during their big opening week.  I'll definitely be heading back.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,4,idIGDXrPpCF0uZsp_RlYtA

On a Sunday afternoon the restaurant was not busy so we were helped right away. It took me a minute to review the board because they have quite a few options. The variety here is definitely better than Chipotle. Pricing seemed reasonable for their options as well. The inside of the restaurant was clean.

I ordered a bowl with steak and my husband had a burrito. We shared chips and salsa and Zalapeno balls. My bowl was good and definitely tasted fresh, but nothing overly special. My husband had the same opinion of his burrito. The chips and salsa were good. I did really enjoy the salsa. The Zalapeno balls were bland and not something I would order again.

I'm sure some of the seasonings or whatever might be different, but still basically the same.  They do however add a potato option to burritos, or I guess whatever you are getting.  My burrito was MASSIVE.  Bigger than Chipotle for sure.  I still love Chipotle, but with none close by me, this is its equal replacement.",Ig4SpbxDIZwkQR2IPxxnLw,0,0,4,Rc1augu3gNMQ_XJ3-cVBTg

The street tacos are good. I get them every time! The Street tacos come with a Corona which is actually my favorite beer. I do not drink alcohol anymore so what would have been my favorite thing about this Mexican Grill feels like a slap in the face.

They have a specific self-serve beverage bar that is the coolest thing they have and no joke serves probably 1000 soft drinks but I go there to eat Mexican food not to fill up on liquids. I wish they had more food options and more traditional Mexican beverage options other than horchata.

I've been to other locations throughout the years, but it was my first time visiting this one. A chain mexican grill, like Chipotle. Service and food was decent. 

I got the carnitas bowl (slow-carb style, 4 Hour Body) -- no rice, black beans, carnitas, veggies -- onions, tomatoes, a few lime wedges. 

I love spicy and can handle the heat but it was a bad choice to add both sauces, as it was too spicy for me! The carnitas was decent, not bad. 

Lots of booth seating, not busy or crowded. We went around 7pm on Thursday night. 

Beers and a few alcoholic beverages served here as well.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,8,8,3,ZDRkrNr19kH6zYlaLKH7GQ

Meal ended up costing $25. Every guest that came in spoke Spanish so maybe it's a little more authentic?

5390426,2015-10-21,4,aTvmLm3YfTs_L290fEolEw,"3 star average for my beloved Zaba's?  Say it ain't so!   I had to scan through all the reviews to get myself prepared to battle and defend Zaba's honor but, you know what, I know where most of them are coming from.  This location just opened in April, and even I, the most diehard of Zaba's fans since I've been visiting their establishments since I was a UNLV student over 15 years ago can admit that I had some shaky experiences here early on.   I think a few times that month after they opened I literally drove across town to the next nearest Zaba's to get my fix.  

I'm happy to report that half a year later, everything is fine and well now!   The shredded beef is consistently seasoned to my liking (a problem early on), and some of the newer staff members then were a little light-handed on portions and have since come around to providing more bang for the buck.  

My usual order is a shredded beef salad with corn and green salsa, but on the weekends I splurge a little with burritos or tacos.   and sour cream.  and cheese.  and chips.  Okay so I always get chips.   I find myself not getting the chicken at this location as much as I used to get it at some of the other ones.  I tend to like it when it gets a nice seasoned char, and more often than not here it doesn't look like it has that nice burnt exterior.   I'm a charred chicken connoisseur.   I'll be honest though I find myself not being upset at the chicken because deep down my heart lies with the shredded beef anyway.   I like Chipotle's Barbacoa but find Zaba's version usually superior, especially when it's seasoned well which as of late it has been.   Then the green salsa here is better than any Chipotle offers IMO.   

My only 2 disappointments are as follows:  

1)  The chips are tasty, but I feel like there's never enough salt on them here. Finding a salty chip in a bag here sometimes is as difficult as finding meaningful lyrics in a Justin Bieber song.  

2) Coca Cola Freestyle.    PEOPLE!   It's 2015.   This isn't a thing anymore.  But I swear every 5 or 6 visits I get someone who stares at it in amazement like it's a portal to Narnia.   Or you get someone who has to examine every option of flavor of Diet Coke Zero before settling on Regular.   Clearly Barqs , Dr Pepper, or Cherry Coke are the only acceptable options anyhow.   

I've given it praise before, but let my close out this review by telling you how much I love the ZIP program they do here.  For every 10 entrees you purchase, you get a free one.   The best part is double point Sundays.   So if you make it a point to come in Sunday and order say, 2 entrees, you're 40% of the way to a free entree.   I come here so much I average a free entree every week and a half.   Another win for the common man.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,2,4,R2Yv8GidmLelKffc8qrFyA
