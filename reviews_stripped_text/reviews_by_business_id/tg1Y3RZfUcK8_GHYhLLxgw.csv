I went back for more and even manage to get a few to take home. The other selections were just as good: chicken, brisket, potato salad and some mac n cheese. I judge my BBQ by the ribs, had to find these guys on Yelp! to give a rating to match the food, 5 stars.",-Ex9DZ2N0Kfs3fWEUOtP_g,0,0,5,5d4H7p23FNLhkyedmo2dtg
