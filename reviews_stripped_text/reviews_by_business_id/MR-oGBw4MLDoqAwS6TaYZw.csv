255573,2014-12-21,0,MR-oGBw4MLDoqAwS6TaYZw,Love their chocolate frosties. Other places have imitations but Wendy's are the real deal. I love to dip the salty fries in there for dessert! Ive never had a bad experience. This location is clean and provides quick service. Theyve never screwed up an order. I come here all the time.

267878,2015-03-21,0,MR-oGBw4MLDoqAwS6TaYZw,The main reason I like Wendy's is their burgers. The meat taste like actual hamburgers. Like if I was to make it myself hamburgers. I'm talking about ground beef!!! Chili is good too. Value menu has decent items as well. Gave it 4 stars cause I don't go inside and I usually get the same thing. A double w/cheese and healthy option side salad combo.,-Z_9lclipijqcc65Xozrhw,0,0,4,krQrX8WZjzzjIDWFt5ZaEg

1287405,2014-12-11,0,MR-oGBw4MLDoqAwS6TaYZw,"Wendy's in general is one of the top national chains. They have incredible chicken sandwiches (especially the spicy ones) and their more pricey burgers are borderline gourmet. Some of the burgers reach upwards of 7 dollars with tax but it's worth the money as the quality is that of what you'd expect from a pricey restaurant.
Even the cheaper burgers have great quality of all ingredients.

As for this location... there are some downsides and some upsides.

Many reviewers on here point out flaws of fries being cold and burgers being dry... I was surprised these reviews until recently when I went at a different time then I normally do.

I usually go at 10PM or later for a quick ""lunch break"". Recently I went in the afternoon and noticed the fries were cold and hard and the burger was put together rather sloppily.

As for drive-thru performance (I usually use this method) they're usually extremely quick to have the food in your car and the demeanor of the employees is usually positive.

It seems their afternoon shifters are a bit shoddy. I'd recommend going here after hours or maybe give early mornings a try.",QGxqWdgZLPzdzu30DhhDog,0,0,4,MEzin4cJX_67C1puf1SQ8Q
1378880,2016-01-14,0,MR-oGBw4MLDoqAwS6TaYZw,I have stopped at this location before. I'm very disappointed in the last two times I have tried giving it another chance. My chili on one visit less then 2 weeks ago was so hot that my daughter was done with her meal before I could even eat mine without burning my mouth. Now tonight my fries are not even cook all the way. Really!!! How hard is that?,nCqPEGmZ_y__XGLItoz1pw,0,0,3,Um5AB3LFhcNHPAsJcA9epg
1955533,2013-04-11,1,MR-oGBw4MLDoqAwS6TaYZw,"I used to work here as a manager about 20 years ago and boy, has it gone down hill! I remember that when they cook hamburgers, they always have to have a few on the grill, even when it's slow so the customer doesn't have to wait. Once they have been on the grill for awhile, they put it in a holding pan and use it for chili. It has almost a rancid grease smell to it in the pan, but once it is boiled down, it tastes fine and is virtually grease-less. Once it hits that pan, it should never be served.

We went about 3:00 in the afternoon and ordered 5 single combos. Three of the five tasted like they took them out of the chili meat pan, the other two tasted ok, although dry. Did they have only two burgers on the grill (and overcooked)? Did they take the other three out of the chili meat holding pan? I guess we will never know for sure. I never complained to the restaurant manager, but did email corporate. I never heard back from them.

Avoid fast food, but...AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!",RlLgB1KEx29dUllGSmuKaA,0,0,1,gAWUw8x1s1yukWiRiU0m8A

He said they ""came with tomatoes so I had to get tomatoes."" I told him I always ordered them without tomatoes and he huffed and said very rudely ""well you will just have to wait then because we have to make them special."" I said okay then I'll wait. He said to pull up. I told him the order was wrong because he put down half size salads and he said ""just pull up!"" He was very nasty. When I went to the window I told the girl that the man took my order down wrong and to please check it. She said yes he did he wrote down half size salads instead of a full-size salad. I asked her to please change it. She changed it and told them to make them 2 full sized salad and Jorge came over to the window and said to the girl ""she said half size salads."" The cashier said well she wants full size salads. Jorge looked out the window at me, gave me a dirty look, shook his head at me, turned around and kept shaking his head as he walked away. I asked her if I could please speak to the manager about how rude that man was, and the cashier said ""he is the manager."" I honestly couldn't believe it! That manager is a rude, rude idiot. If I hadn't pressed the issue about no tomatoes I would have just driven away thinking that they didn't make them that way anymore and he would have lost a $17 sale. Apparently he doesn't care about making money for his company, and it is very apparant in his rude, obnoxious, nasty attitude. I really feel very sorry for his employees, because if he treats the customers like that, then he probably treats his employees worse.",DK71L7eRHNIKa0UhRHRZCg,0,0,1,oE_bXVX0eM1XUUkyhieIwA

Once I order an item I hear ""ok is that all?"" after each item. It comes off very rude. I understand time is important at fast food restaurants, but this happened to us TOO many times. I called to complain but was not taken seriously, so I decided to review it here on Yelp. Not only do they rush you, but food is continuously missed. It's okay if it happens once in awhile, but literally 1 out of 3 times I go here, they forget something. Usually small things such as nugget sauces, or condiments such as salad dressing or sour cream for potatoes...but that is still quite an inconvenience. Sucks because it is the closest Wendy's to our house. You need to learn how to balance good customer service while managing your time & accuracy of orders! Do not forget your customers!

Allowed to simmer for hours, this mixture of nicely seasoned Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, pieces of tomato, onion, celery, and lean beef drenched in a great kicky sauce is hard to beat.  So much so that I almost never leave a Wendy's without ordering Chili along with a burger and fries.  My square and rather flat quarter-pound burger topped with a single slice of American Cheese, and a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, pickles, and ketchup on a soft bun was quite tasty.  But, alas, the skin-on fries were sort of dead tasting, with no hint of salt.
