The service is not typically Chinese restaurant.  The wait staff is attentive but not distracting.  The food took a big leap forward also.  Their beef stew in red wine is a dish unique to Fortune and is to die for.  The chef left the silver skin on the beef because Chinese diners like that chewy texture.  Tender meat and flavorful.  Another unique dish is the pork chop in red bean curd marinate.  Got to eat it on site thought because it gets hard by the time I got it home.  The pork belly with pickled vegetable is tender melt in your mouth.  Even the lean meat part is tender.  Hard to find a dish so well made.  The pull chicken salad is seasoned just right, not too much sesame flavor and the jellyfish is crunchy but not chewy.  They roast their ducks on site so its crispy and yummy.  Because it is located off the beaten path to Chinese food, their price is lower than in Chinatown.  Good food at a low price, I am there.",8xUzj8aCDOWrhykVcWggXA,0,0,5,jimMDzvufgn4Nkzw_3eAPg

I can tell you that we are anticipating our next trip to Vegas so we can try some other selections from their menu. We ordered two combo plates from their lunch specials menu. I had beef chop suey and wife had sweet & sour pork BOTH WERE VERY TASTY, especially the S&S Pork! The sauce was the best I've had in a long while. The chunks of pork were delicately coated and fried so that they had such an amazing crispy texture to every bite all lunch combos come with egg drop soup (TASTY) fried rice (just ok) and a large egg roll which is AWESOME! All for only $5.95. They have a very large lunch specials menu to chose from, ranging from $5.95 to $7.95. Very reasonable. The restaurant itself isn't very exciting from the outside, almost uninviting but DONT LET THIS KEEP YOU FROM TRYING IT. It is clean inside and staff were very pleasant. Next time we will order separate entrees, I have a feeling they give you not so special fried rice for the lunch combos so just order the steamed rice if you get a combo. BUT DO TRY THEM OUT.",L3V4_6HCrnFg-uEUA4gs9g,0,1,4,TzItyw8mP-obMUlXnVfT5A

The service was really good; although I did feel like they needed to learn a bit more english to make ordering more smooth. However, there was a lot of waiters so you never have to get their attention for more than 5 seconds before they come over

The food was really good and you can taste the freshness. The lunch specials are so worth it too. I will come back again whenever i come back to Vegas!",aiBw101z2PPHP5IQL1t4OQ,0,0,5,ikNRpJfra9uUH5Y95u-tLA

The food was excellent and good sized portions. We had pork chop with spicy salt and pepper, sizzling black pepper steak, garlic on choy, and chicken with jelly fish. We devoured everything. 

Waitress was very nice, great service. When I'm back in town, I will def be back again.",9nnCjA0otgIrRMrzwCueHw,1,0,4,w5yR399PwsFRaIY3n99IOw

Upon walking in I was surprised at how much cleaner the place looked . 
 The service was on point and the staff were incredibly friendly. The food was exceptional and very well priced. My entire family was impressed as was I. 
 We will be returning very soon",THQIu1BODr6Cjexz9GT0KQ,1,1,5,8jK_1EyWbuhMFZyZJQ0Pgg
