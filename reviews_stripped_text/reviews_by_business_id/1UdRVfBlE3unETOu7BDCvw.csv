213940,2011-02-17,2,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"My husband and I along with another couple decided to try out Nagoya for the all you can eat sushi special. Let me just say that the four of us are well seasoned sushi consumers and have eaten at many sushi joints around town. This was by far the most horrific restaurant experience any one of us have encountered.

First of all, the rice was under cooked and there was a massive amount under each piece of nigiri. If you want to call a paper thin slice with holes, that when holding it up to the light you can clearly see thru it, nigiri. We told our server about the issues of the rice being undercooked and the sheer mass amount of it, also the fact that the nigiri was so paper thin. She said that the next round of orders would be taken care of, with no apologies said. So, taking her word for it we stayed. Big mistake!

This time the rice was cooked all the way but nothing else had improved. We complained again and told the server to give us the check. Again, no apologies were said from the server. At this point, I was so beside me that I had to talk to a manager and when I asked for one the server told me that there was not one there. I then told her that we did not even finish our meal and how dissatisfied we all were and if there was anything they could do about it. She said no rudely then strangely disappeared into the kitchen.

I continued to demand to speak with a manager or owner and she kept giving me the run around then disappearing back into kitchen area. At this point, I noticed a man in the back corner staring at us, so I walked up to him and asked ""are you the owner?"" He replied, ""yes, you go sit down, I not talking to you, you talk to police!"" I was trying to reason with this man and let him know of our experience, but there was no reasoning with him, seeing that he would not even talk to me.

All we wanted was an apology from someone, the next round of sushi to be right, or even a discount. We were not looking to get a free meal, just an enjoyable one. Well, lets just say that none of this happened and we paid the full bill, the cops arrived, and we left still feeling hungry.",amPLLw80aEykVh4PE1jzOA,0,0,1,oeTthXH64xsHjEQaRfbiag

684708,2012-06-30,0,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"This place was Terrible! My friend and I were looking for a decent place to eat when we stumbled onto Nagoya. I was hesitant as soon as we walked in at 3 p.m on a Friday afternoon and we were the only ones in the place. I ordered the Ayce and some water that taste like tap that had trout dipped into it. Started with saba and albacore nigiri. The cuts were extremely small served with huge globs of rice. I actually cut off half the rice to balance out. The albacore was the worse i ever had.  Dry and a slight fishy smell to it. The Saba was no better. Moved on to rolls. I got the unagi roll. Once again it was mostly rice and small slivers of Unagi except this time smothered in mayo. Ordered two more rolls with the same terrible results. Meanwhile the waitress kept asking us if we wanted to try some Sake. I don't mind be checked up on but this felt like a hard sale of sorts. She literally tried 4 times to get me to order it. Well, the last roll came ""a mayo, salmon, rice concoction"" I took one bite and wanted to puke. I decided at that point to call it quits. I asked for the bill and the waitress rudely told me she was going to charge me for the last roll. She explained that I need to eat it all including the pounds of rice slopped up on the plate. I told her there was no way in hell I was going to pay for that roll. She didn't charge me. However, she did charge me dinner price for the ayce. I told her we had ordered several minutes before 3 which is the cutoff for lunch. She refused to lower the bill. It was BY FAR the worse sushi restaurant I had ever eaten. I wish i could give it zero stars.  Heed my warning. THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING AND RUDE!",EdZBSI4OyDQlf52KEf2t5Q,0,0,1,LRWEtQ6bud7hpem7zHAQng

The servers were very attentive and my water glass never went empty.  The food came quickly and my yakisoba was sizzling on a small cast iron plate.  

The food was ""average"" price.  My yakisoba was $12 but I would have liked to have paid $10.  I do however like the sesame seeds that were sprinkled on top.  It really made a difference and I love me some sesame seeds.

The restaurant was very clean and well staffed.  I think they had areas for hibachi which makes me want to go back even more.  I'll dream about it until next time.",YUNzd4DX-KpCRWyLQ0WmtQ,0,0,4,Oo7qAtUcTasAAy3ul4beaA

But honestly I may have a new favorite and it is the popcorn lobster... This is a dish that will be one of my regulars. Of course there was the all time go-to which is a California roll. Shrimp tempura rocked!  Spicy Shrimp roll had great texture and the flavor was unbelievable.

mmmm I am getting hungry all over again.
Honestly I believe this place to be 5 star food. 
But what ruined this night out was my waitress.  She didn't really pay attention to our order... even though she wrote it down. I am glad I wasn't super thirsty because refills were NON existent.  Then she never came back. 

25 minutes we sat... waiting ... for a refill.. more sushi.. maybe dessert? But no... waitress.. not anywhere .. 
Finally Tonya another waitress looked over and asked if the waitress had been back .. .I said no and that we had been waiting for a very long time. 

She immediately bowed and apologized... 
She brought us our check which only had our drinks on it... Which if we were not completely awesome people with integrity ... we could have taken advantage of it. But we quickly brought this to Tonya's attention, her eyes widened with how honest we had been and she thanked us. Then brought us a corrected bill.  Which we paid . We also gave a tip .. and told Tonya that it should be for her because she was working her butt off. 

I would like to have more of a sense of humor about the waitress situation and I think that if I go back - I will ask to sit in Tonya's section ... But even with good food... it sucked to be ignored.",Pn4W0F3wc6B5fAEwpKY0rQ,2,0,3,i-yekMI1_nIhWNKJTXAkZw
1140750,2010-07-19,0,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"I am always looking for a better place than the last for all-you-can-eat-sushi. I've been going to Oyshi down the street for a couple of years now. A couple months ago on a whim, we decided to try Nagoya after seeing an AYCE sign on the front of their building. It turned out to be the best AYCE sushi place I've been to to date. 

The menu is very extensive, with a large variety of rolls, special rolls, and sushi. There are also a lot of appetizers and unique items on the AYCE menu as well. One unique feature is the availability of Korean items. The food is very fresh and prepared very well. We didn't really have anything that we didn't like. I've had the red and red roll and the lobster affair roll each time. The tuna, yellowtail, salmon, halibut sushis, and oysters we tried were all very fresh. They also have a full Korean BBQ menu. 

At $23.95/person, it is the lowest priced AYCE sushi place in town that I am aware of. The location of the restaurant is not the best, which is why I assume that it's not too busy. However, over the last month or two, there does seem to be more people. The dining room it self is clean, decorated nicely, and has somewhat of an elegant feel to it. I really hope they get busier and survive. I've always compared AYCE sushi places to Oyshi and no other place has ever been better until Nagoya. I have recommended it to all of my friends who now only come here for AYCE sushi as well.",jodPtzKf6CrxxlubsFyyIQ,1,0,4,alKEjxeDVoZRmboQw5sMOA

1566535,2011-11-06,1,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"First time here today, and definitely not too bad. It's not the best place I've been to, but I'll admit, I got my fill and was able to kick my sushi craving. I would definitely like to come back, especially since it's a little bit different from selections I've had in other restaurants.

The only thing I found confusing was that, reading the menu made me believe that appetizers and other categories were all under the ""All You Can Eat"" menu. I mean, I guess it couldn't hurt to redo and organize the menu a little, but no big deal, I guess; we still got what we wanted, and it's just a little detail that can be easily over-looked.

The guy taking our order and helping us for most of the night was very friendly, and was very immediate to our needs. Not so much with the lady who took over for him, I guess, as she was very pushy; it was like she was getting us out of the door while we were still finishing up our food. Also, it seemed that while the nice guy checked up on us every ten to fifteen minutes, it took such a long time to get the check from the lady.

The sushi was very delicious, however, despite a few flaws, as I suspect it's not as nice and fresh as it can be, but it wasn't bad. The flavors are enticing for the most part, and I genuinely enjoyed the taste. The combination fried rice was where it was at for me, and my favorite roll out of all that we ordered was the Crunch #2 with calamari. I hope to try out things outside of rolls whenever I return to Nagoya, though.

But, overall, a pretty good night for me. I may have seen and had better, but it was still nice, for a bit of a change, and I want to try some of the 'weird, new' rolls that I'd definitely never seen in other restaraunts.",IWQkdTTn9FslPeSiih2l2Q,1,1,4,ftnnQv_esk3gOBRtpaAOVQ

Immediately the sushi chef was annoying as in the fact he kept trying to make us stuff when we hadn't even had a chance to browse the roll menu. Asked for separate checks from waitress & could tell from the tone in her voice she didn't want to do it but I persisted. Between the 2 of us we ordered a spicy crab hand roll, superman burrito & a rainbow roll. We didn't want to order a ton since we had to go back to work & didn't want a sleep coma. Rainbow roll was very fresh tasting (as it should be.) A little more rice than my liking as I've gotten used to another place that doesn't give you hardly any rice. Superman Burrito was good but again too much rice. tasted excellent though. Owner was very friendly & made you feel welcome.

2261624,2010-11-21,0,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"My friends used to go to the location on Fort Apache all the time and I would tag along occasionally.  My friends developed some sort of odd relationship with the staff.  Whenever the staff would see them coming from the parking lot, they would hold the door shut so my friends couldn't get in.  Yeah, strange, I know.  But my friends like to mess with people so I guess the staff caught on and reciprocated.  They would let them in eventually.

Anyhow, the owners opened a new location on Rainbow and my friends started going to this location because it's closer to their home.  One of them wanted to do the AYCE Korean BBQ for his birthday, so there we are.  With a large group of people, it is super fun.  

Everything on the AYCE Korean BBQ menu in red, you get automatically.  Everything in black you have to order.  The whole table must participate.  You can get some sushi rolls, noodles, baked mussels, garlic edamame (yum!) etc. so it's fairly unique and there is something to please everyone.  Except for ice cream and baked mussels, everything on the list is AYCE.  And it's only $20 per person.  

They've got those ""order accordingly"" signs all over the place threatening to charge you for food you don't eat.  But they aren't nazis about it. But the signs did make some of our guests feel a little uncomfortable. (""If I don't eat every last bit of the fried rice, will they charge us for it?"" No, they won't.)  The signs are a little tacky, but most AYCE sushi places do this so c'est la vie.

Everything tasted very good to me.  The only thing I miss is all the little sides you get with normal Korean BBQ places (e.g. pickles, kimchi, random potato salad, etc.).  Unless I'm with a large group, I think I might stick with Maru for my Korean BBQ fix, which is more traditional and close to home.  And I've got my regular sushi place (Sushi Fever) so it won't replace that either.

They have some inventive items - such as the Superman Burrito roll - and they taste pretty good.  It isn't the freshest or the best sushi in the world but it's solid and it does the trick.

As a non-fish eater, I appreciated that they have Steak and Chicken rolls on the menu instead of veggie or tofu only. I ordered the Steak roll, which the waitress said was five pieces, but received 8 instead. That wasn't the first of the miscommunications. We went in at 6:00 and were the only table in the restaurant, until another group of four showed up. We ordered, then about five minutes later they ordered; the same waitress delivered our food to their table. She had a 50/50 shot and she missed... hope she doesn't take that luck to the tables.

My friends ordered the all-you-can-eat dinner for about $26, which considering the price of rolls, is a great deal. I ordered one roll (steak) and the dinner box, which cost as much as their all-you-can-eat. The chicken was really fatty but the teriyaki sauce and the katsu breading were really good. 

Also, and this may be standard for Japanese restaurants and I just don't know it, but the waitress told us we could only order one Mochi dessert per person. We were totally willing to pay for more, but she was firm that it was one per person. Okay, you just missed out on additional revenue... whatever.",PcqqldYB1hi0Mb6cwb2caA,1,1,3,qPej11IUyI4Q0sXZZr754w

We ordered a few spicy hand rolls to start, they were good. But when we started ordering off of their all you can eat menu the waiter said (more than once) that ""You have to eat it all or we charge you"". Great thanks. We only ordered a few rolls for two people, so to repeat this comment was really unnecessary. 

The menu said that they offer half rolls, which is fantastic. We asked if we can have that for every roll we ordered and he agreed. Then--every roll he brought out was a full order. He wasn't paying attention to anything we said at all. 

Another waitress/busgirl came over about 5 times asking if we were OK. It was overkill. Everything about this place just turned me off. The staff seemed bored because of the lack of business. 

The last roll was called ""lasagne on fire"" or something like that. It was terrible. It tasted like a bad tuna salad wrapped in old rice and smothered in a thick mayo and spicy sauce. I tasted one piece and we left the rest. Worst roll ever...I came home and puked my guts up (Sorry for the visual), the mayo taste was like lingering death. 

As if it wasn't bad enough, at the end this busgirl gave us a tutorial explanation of how their ""rules"" work there as far as ordering etc.

3674435,2010-07-06,0,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"Was so excited to find a AYCE korean bbq, only to be really disappointed all around.  I'm from Los Angeles and was hoping the korean bbq would be similiar to those from L.A.   I was wrong.  

First, we went on a holiday weekend (saturday night), and the place was empty.  A waitress led us to a table where we can cook our own meat.   She explained that ""red"" items on the menu will be brought out automatically, but the ""black"" items on the menu would have to be ordered.  We asked for the garlic endamame and spicy tuna roll.  I will admit that that spicy tuna roll had a lot less rice than other AYCE sushi places - but that's because we weren't having AYCE sushi, but AYCE korean bbq.  /shrug

The waitress checked on us frequently, but everything about her was fake and it was obvious she was just going through the motions and didn't care at all.  To prove this point, our waitress took orders for 3 different types of meat (bulgogi, kalbi and cow's tongue).  She brought out the bulgogi first and while others have wrote that the staff cooked the meat for them, we had to cook our own.  She would come by from time to time and toss the meats around, but left the cooking to us.  After bulgogi and kalbi, our grill was completely crusted from the marinations from the meat.  At this time, the waitress forgot that she didn't bring out the other meat and brought it out only to dump it on top of the crusted grill - note:  cow's tongue is unmarinated and she completely ruined the flavor of it.   We didn't have a chance to ask for more meat cuz all she wanted to do was turn off the grill and be done with us.  We were the only patrons - you'd think they would try to please their only customer rather than shooing them out the door.

Overall, I would never go back.  While $20 for AYCE sounds reasonable, it seemed too much for the quality and quantify of this place.  Service made it even worse.",R7U15ERxFhow3ipUJBI4RA,1,0,1,k5_GrmlfITqYadH3Jjn1Fw
3698994,2012-07-17,0,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"I frequent this restaurant quite a bit because it's right behind my house and I love sushi. As far as sushi places go, it's not the absolute best  I've ever had in my whole life or anything, however it's still extremely good and the service is also really good 90% of the time unless they're particularly busy.

Their fish is always top grade, and the tuna is especially good. The only thing that's ever really been off is the rice. Sometimes the rice has a weird consistency like it's been sitting around for awhile, but very rarely do I get sushi rolls with bad rice. Most of the time it's excellent.

There are of course some rolls I prefer over others but this is more of a taste preference as opposed to something being ""bad"".

Their beef udon is also extremely delicious, especially with a few sprinkles of fish seasoning or chili powder.

The service is very friendly and the staff recognizes me now after going there so often so they're particularly pleasant towards me, and they can often accurately guess what I want before I order, which I appreciate.

The atmosphere is pretty nice too, it's got sort of  modern ""club"" feel to it. Everything is kind of dark and dimly lit and they have paper lanterns hanging around the sushi bar to tie in the Japanese theme. The only thing I don't like is they usually play really annoying club music but again, that's just a personal preference.

All in all, I really enjoy this place and will continue to go often.",wGI0HA85_RDLAhcF12_KJQ,0,0,4,bAY1rRL0WBk4-9tkEV1n6Q

Korean marinated sushi is what it is. Secondly, the name says it's all, when it called a ""Japanese and Korean BBQ restaurant"", an third, like the others yelpers said, the place was dead. All of these signs, yet I still decided to let my friend talk me into eating with her here. 

Literally 4 other people when we came here at 8:00pm, we were sat at the bar and presented the AYCE menu, which always baffles me, let's see how many rolls we can change the name of and trick the white person. My first roll was not good, so I gave them a second chance and ordered something else, which of course tastes the same but the salmon on top looked old and dry. By this time I had lost my appetite, it is then you make the decision to waste $30 on dinner and call it a loss or chance getting sick on sub par, not sushi grade fish.  I called it a loss. 

The waitress that came to refill my tea kept sniffling, and then I saw here wipe her nose with her hand and then go in the back, come out and do the same, I know she didn't wash her hands. Then proceed to lean over me and do the same. At this point I'm pissed because this is not only common sense, but clearly rude and not hygienic.

3934627,2011-04-25,1,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"This place was one bad experience after another.  

The exterior looks like a neighborhood pub that has been bought by a new owner.  It is very uninviting with no windows and one ominous door as the front enterance.  Once inside, it is modern with a clean estetic.  You immediately walk into the sushi bar, but all table seating is partitioned off by room dividers.  

When we went, 6 pm on a Sunday evening, I think there was only one other table seated.  Over the course of our meal, only two other tables were seated. You would think that with as many servers as there are diners that it would be great service, well I tell you not the case.  

First order of business was drinks.  I was not presented a drink list and had to ask for the list of sake.  I want to say that there were four choices for cold sake in each in varying sizes.  I ultimately decided on the flight as I felt the small bottles (starting at $17 for 300 mL) were over priced.  

We ordered all you can eat sushi.  It included the entire menu.  We first ordered some Hamachi Kama, to which the waiter asked, ""is that on the menu? can you show me where?"".  He then went to check with the chef if they could make it for the all you can eat, which they later told us they were ""out of"".  

We asked for no wasabi on the tuna sushi so that our daughter could enjoy it as well.  All of the nigiri came without wasabi, nor did we have wasabi or ginger on a side dish for dipping either.  Again, for an empty restaraunt, it was disappointing to have to ask for a plate or something as common as wasabi and ginger.  The sushi itself was not cut very well and the rice was horrible.  The rice was not cooked evently, nor was it seasoned for sushi. 

Next item to arrive was some Chilled soba noodles, the highlight of the night.  It was very tasty and just the right amount for the three of us to share.  

We tried to order a natto (but was told they do not have it).  

By this time I had finished my flight of sake and ordered a 300 mL bottle.  To which I was told they do not have it.  They had a larger size at $65 per bottle, but i was not interested in paying that much for it.  I was even told that if I did not finish the larger bottle, I would not be allowed to take it with me.  My choice of Sake was served as part of the tasting flight, so I found it really irritating that they were unable to come up with a solution to sell me some sake.  It was if we were a huge inconvinence to them.

Much of the other items ordered were just so so, and the service was very poor at times too.  When I ordered half rolls, I would receive 10 pieces.  The Sushi Orgasm, was good, but if I was ordering it a la carte, I would not pay $14 for that plate of 5 small slices of tuna with some mayo on it.",-Lwil_Hq5y3wiwmovDe-uA,1,0,1,ND4Yj638mYrrP9HELOSRYg

2) Too much sodium in their side dishes
3) Too much batter on everything tempura

I was fairly disappointed in this place as it was my first time tonight and I was craving sushi.  So I decided to try the AYCE which is actually a pretty good deal compared to other places in Vegas.  

1 star definitely for the garlic edamame
2 stars for the quick turnaround on food orders and the fact that they offer half orders

We ordered Gyoza and it was overcooked and salty.  The sushi we ordered was fresh, but the sushi to rice ratio was not fair.  My friend and I were way too full to fast and believe you me, we can eat.  The tempura shrimp tasted like straight up batter with no shrimp inside.  The tempura ice cream was the same way; not enough ice cream for such a bready shell.  It should have had more crunch to it.  I forget which roll we ordered, but it was good minus the rice ratio.  The hamachi and sake sushi was fresh; but the rice again was too much.

I will try this place one more time just to check out some more of their wide selection; but for now, I can only offer 2 stars for this place because of the dissatisfaction to my crave.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,3,1,2,qlARTbzgAZp20yHLYg4m2A
4048068,2010-09-24,2,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"It's been too long since I've written a review but to be honest, I've just not been inspired by any of the places I've visited since my last review in May?!?!? and I just won't ever write negative reviews so if I don't have anything nice to say, I just don't say nothing at all and never go back...

I've been to Nagoya on Ft Apace and really liked the sushi, but it was BY...(Before Yelp..get it?  AD, BC...BY)..okay, back to the serious work of writing informative and interesting food critique...I've since moved to Blue Diamond and have ineffingcredible sushi a mile from my door!

I am picky and my tongue and tummy can ferret out spoiled, bad, slippery within .003 second of it being in my mouth.  I will put spit it out in a napkin and ask for the bill within 12.  

Nagoya is an AYCE place but I'm all about Sashimi Baybeee.  I'm a HUGE fan of a competing Sushi spot in the GV that I've been a loyal fan for 9 years.  I VERY rarely go anywhere else, until now.  The GV spot makes KILLAH Tuna Karai, but Nagoya does it in delicate slices that melt so wonderfully in  you mouth instead of chunks.  They are both good,  but on a date, you want delicate.  They are both the bomb though.  Please see my pic of the three items I had tonight so you'll know what's up.

How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...

The Tuna Karai Sashimi is comprised of thin slices of tuna laid in a circular pattern over a bed of  cool fresh shredded radish, and a spicy sauce with bountiful flavors is poured over the top leaving a delicious soup of vinegary, spicy, sweetness pooling at the bottom of the radish pile perfect for use as a dipping sauce once the sashimi is gone and all you have is the radish and sauce left.   I don't know the recipe but I detected a hint of sesame oil and seeds, finely ground red pepper, small diced jalapeño for POW, but the ""pow"" was perfectly balanced with the cool, refreshing, crispy texture of the shredded radish, and the tang??? I think, of the rice vinegar??? maybe...not sure, but the sauce is magic.  This is my favorite dish because it's so clean, the flavors are crisp, fresh, refreshing, the dish itself is light, and healthy.  Just my opinion but if you try it, you too will be a fan.   Joon was my Sushi Chef tonight...I just sayin'...Michaelangelo painted the Mona Lisa,  I'm sure all the Chefs are good, but so Joon is my guy.

Next course was as clean as you can get.  No sauce, no fuss, no muss...Halibut and Yellow Tail Sashmi...very simple, very clean, but with Raw Wasabi...if you like it hot, go Raw.  A little dab will do yah.  The Halibut has a clean flavor and light texture.  I ordered  by accident once and have been a fan every since.  I was surprised at how much I liked it.   The Yellow Tail was good too.  Very delicate; it just melts in your mouth.  Fresh!  Put a dab of Fresh Wasabi on it and enjoy the fireworks in your ears and sinuses.  Does anyone else's hair follicles burn when they eat Fresh Wasabi?  

I was sitting there eying the thick, roasted cuts of grilled  Unagi calling my name and pondering whether I should have another round when Joon presented me with a dish, not on the menu, called Japanese Nachos...Hoooo (enter your favorite four letter expletive right  here, right now!)...WOW!  My life is forever changed.   Okay, you know the basic construction of a nacho snack topped with stuff, now let's imagine how a culinary genius, like Joon, hooks this up.  First, there is a soy wrap with a thin layer of rice pressed flat into it and deep fried for a crunchy texture. On top of that 1""x1"" ""chip"", a perfectly proportioned scoop of Spicy Tuna, a little larger than a melon ball, is placed on top.  Then there is a thinly sliced jalapeño pepper set on the top of the tuna.  A half order is four pieces, and a full is eight..  I had the half order, but next time I go, I will be gettin' that full order.  Let's not mess around, I'm just doin' it.  I'm just sayin'.

When you look at the pic, you will see the four pices surrounding a bed of shredded radish and lightly drizzled with Eel sauce (kabayaki sauce) and a KILLAH creamy chili hot sauce which is Mayo based, but not too heavy on the application so I'm down and it works for me.  Not a big fan of mayo sauces, but this one worked perfectly for a beautiful symphony of flavors, textures and temperatures dancing over my pallet that left me resonating like right after my first kiss with the love of my life.

Bliss, just pure bliss...

So that 'possible charge for wasted food' is only for people who order a lot and have plenty of left overs. So it's better to finish what you ordered first, then go at it a second time, or third time...

I fell in love with their garlic edamame from reviews on here, and am so thankful for it! However, I am constantly craving it when it isn't sushi night.
I am not a sushi snob and eat the americanized rolls and stay away from the 'scary' items. So I may not be the best person to rate sushi!  
But Nagoya does my type of rolls well. Their tempura is always fresh (unlike Oyshi which pre cooks their shrimp tempura and lets them sit out until used) and sweet, the way I like it.  Their spicy tuna is spicy without being overbearing. 
I don't feel like they use too much rice in the rolled pieces, but perhaps in the Nigiri they do. One thing that I don't like is that some of their rolls are ---- long and others are -------------- long.  So you expect your next roll to be one size, and next thing you know, you have a monster roll in front of you.  They do offer half rolls, which I need to learn to take advantage of.

Came on a Friday afternoon around noon. This place was DEAD! However the decor is amazing! Really looks like a modern lounge more than a resturant! We got seated in the korean bbq area. I like how it is seperate from the dinner lounge ( because of the vents and smell lol).  
They have a pre fixed menu that they give you. Noted on the menu in red. 
Salad (salad dressing was wierd), miso soup, goyza, chicken wings (more like sesame chicken..BOMB!!). fried rice (had to order two plates! The best fried rice, it wasn't sticky and had a ton of flavor!), 
All you can eat meats we got were bulgogi nad kalbi. The bulgogi was very good had a alot of flavor however the kalbi I have had better. They also have marinated chicken and pork belly.

You can also order other things off the menu such as sushi and other appetizers but you get so much out of the pre fixed menu that ordering other things seemed impossible to eat!!

Once you get passed the boring facade, you walk into a large restaurant establishment with a bar to the right, sushi bar in the middle, tables to the left, and bbq tables on the further left

The Husband wanted AYCE Korean BBQ, and there's only one way he can get it - if I order it with him.  (It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)

Adult prices: $19.95
Kid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95

A little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.

As the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!

There are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:

* Garlic Edamame ""Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)
* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)
* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)

The kitchen list has about six items, and we got:

* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)
* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)
* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)
* Fried Rice (Vegetable)

From the Korean BBQ list of four items:

* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)
* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)
(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)

From the Classic Rolls list of seven items:

* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)
* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)

For dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.

The staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.

Service was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  

It was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.

Overall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,9,9,3,IZqkjIN7sujvHRANcZvByw

AYCE menu: food was ok. I ordered uni and hamachi kama but they were ""sold out""...which I don't see how since their restaurant was empty.

Service: They lost our order list and found it sometime later so we got a huge pause in between our dishes. They even messed up our dessert orders for vanilla when we ordered green tea tempura ice cream. None of them really smile at you. 

An overall bad first time experience. I don't think we'll be coming back.",E3JYy7_-e-K6OLAGUg9U_A,2,0,1,Bpo0nDKvEPbDQkPoEyGgeg

       - Tempura batter - I could hardly find my shrimp in my tempura
       - Rice - Their portions of rice are insane. The fish are sliced so thin that a couple were literally see through. They even had rice in their dynamite. Who does that?
       - Freshness - Average.
       - Portions - The slivers of fish that were given on both rolls and nigiri made me question if they  believed fish had gone extinct. I was able to see the rice beneath the half sliver of Uni I got.
       - Advertised - They did not have hamachi kama as promised and did not honor their half roll policy.
       - Decor - I must give it to them however, the ambiance inside gave a very modern and hip feel.
**Price**
       - $23.95 for dinner(3pm-11pm) AYCE Sushi
**Ordered**
       - Uni (Sea Urchin) - Mediocre quality UNI on an over filling bed of rice.
       - Saba (Mackerel) - Good quality piece. It tried it's best to cover the rice beneath it.
       - Popcorn Lobster Roll - A very good roll. I've never seen another place offer this. One of the only things I enjoyed here.
       - Red & Red Roll - Tuna one spicy tuna. The ponzu sauce was good.
       - Aged Tofu - Tasteless
       - Screaming Orgasm - I believe that the seared ahi tuna slices were indeed anorexic and malnourished.
       - Oysters - Not bad. Partially frozen in the middle though.
       - Chicken Wing (garlic) - Dryest and worst chicken wing I've ever had.
       - Shrimp Tempura - 4-1 tempura batter to shrimp ratio.
       - Croquette - Ordinary but not bad.
       - Tempura Ice Cream & Green Tea Mochi - Out of a box generic taste.
**Recommendations**
       - I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have a passion for rice and disliked thick pieces of fish.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,0,1,4ML3-upluyXG-x5r_ZKsFA

Sushi quality: The cuts of fish that were served to our table were poor.  One piece of nigiri looked like they took scrap pieces of fish and threw it on some rice.  You are not supposed to see the rice of the nigiri through the holes in the fish. More importantly, there shouldn't be holes in the fish!!

Additionally, the fish scraps provided on the nigiri were dwarfed by the mountain of rice upon which they sat.  I'm not sure what others mean when they say that Oyshi provides a lot of rice to fill you up and that Nagoya does not.  If anything, assuming such a claim about Oyshi is true because I would disagree, Oyshi borrowed that practice from Nagoya's playbook.  A little fish with your rice? Yes please...

Service: VERY SLOW.  My group placed its order and we waited... and waited.. and waited. Finally, food started coming out.  People were getting their nigiri and some rolls. Fine.  However, it seemed as if the people in my group that were ordering a la carte menu rather than the AYCE were getting food much faster than the AYCE participants. (Possibly a tactic to fill you up? I can only speculate.)  One person finally received a few pieces of the sushi that she ordered when we sat about 30 minutes after most others had received things on their second round of ordering.  We thought that they lost her order.

I received a roll ONE HOUR after it was ordered.  The place was pretty busy but ONE HOUR for a sushi roll is ridiculous.  It wasn't even a roll that was deep-fried.  If you can't handle the size of the restaurant and the demand from those customers, hire more staff or close a section. 

Lastly, when we were seated those in my group that were not ordering AYCE asked the waitress for a regular menu.  She stated that they didn't have a regular menu and that all they had were the AYCE menus.  This seemed strange and it was slightly upsetting to see another couple sitting across the way with regular menus.  Seems odd to lie about something like that...  

I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon, if ever...",VP-p52m1JDG6Qm92zlBCgg,3,1,2,Fn4GrBdifXQpd9mH5xMHhg

My food was alright, but didn't have that umm ""fresh"" taste. I am all for trying new places and this wasn't horrible, but I've definitely had better. One thing that was okay is their all you can eat was like $24 and I ordered 3 different rolls which would've been more than $30 if I ordered them by themselves. Maybe if I was just going to grab a quick bite I may go again, but I think I'll stick with my usual sushi spots from now on.",I6amR7obmvnJWT-D-J6u7A,0,0,2,B4UriDtEbKxp0aLI6YgOhA
5574263,2012-03-07,1,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"I walked in here a couple of afternoons ago and this place was a ghost town! There was a family in the dining room and one other guy at the bar. This place is close to home so I wanted to try it out. 

The nigiri was fresh but it just didn't taste as good as I'm used to at Goyemon. The rolls were good and I loved the added options for side dishes. I actually ordered the chilled soba noodles and I don't see that at very many AYCE places.

The server was attentive but ordering from the sushi chef was hell. He screwed up my first two orders. I got spicy tuna roll first out when I actually just ordered tuna nigiri along with my other nigiri orders. I would have complained but he lucked out and spicy tuna is usually my second order anyway. 

I won't go back here. Goyemon has my heart!",aGNvO5rjmeHspcpGZNOoQw,1,0,2,7kPuAXjhsXFb1uVRWD50JA
5748861,2011-01-26,1,1UdRVfBlE3unETOu7BDCvw,"Went for sushi and had a mixed experience.  The freshness of the fish was fine, but the quality of the sushi chef was lacking.  Basic things like cutting the rolls so that the pieces are at least close to the same size and packing the rice so that it doesn't fall apart should be a given.  I enjoyed the taste of most of their rolls, but have some attention to detail.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,1,1,3,E0uvpOJ4rRd8A3QjKYfjoQ

Since we( my wife and I) were sushi hungry.  We decided to go for the all you can eat for 23.95 which included many varieties of sushi, rolls and appetizers.  Don't do it!!  It is a ripoff.  They want to filled you up fast so that you can't eat anything else.   To be a little over exaggerating, the rice is as big as my fist, the sushi on top was as thin as paper.  The rolls were extremely big - the rice that is.  The fish weren't too fresh either.  Sea Urchin was on the menu limited to one order per customer - well, they were out.   Hamachi Kama, that too were out!!  The service was horrible.  It would take a SOS flare to get their attention.  That was my first time and 100% sure it would be my last.  

Overall, totally disappointed.",hDofJbts96Mu_aIntlad5A,4,0,1,FsFIttVoZdqo2p6Hml6S-A
