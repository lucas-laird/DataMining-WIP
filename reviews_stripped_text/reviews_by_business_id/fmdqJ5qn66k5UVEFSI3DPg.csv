If I could give zero stars, I would. Besides being massively overpriced - $5.79 for a personal pan pizza - I think several of us on the plane ride back got food poisoning!

My gf and I both got pizza before the plane ride back to Honolulu, as did a third of the people on the plane. We both felt throwing up, and just before the half way point, someone did throw up on the plane. It smelled REALLY bad but you know what? It smelled like pizza hut food! I'm pretty sure that person got food poisoning from here too. When we were there, the workers were saying something was wrong with one of their ovens.

This is all speculation of course but my gf and I both felt sick. I was trying really hard not to think about feeling sick because i felt like I was going to vomit a couple times before I forced myself to sleep.

Service here sucks too. The workers are foreign and very annoying. Plus they're SLOW and the wait is so long.

Bring food before your plane ride back. Don't go here. I feel so bad for the person that got sick on the way back!",V9gDT71lAuIQsS6mYLFmBw,1,0,1,RLOvgOWlyq8YI1NDNdKjow

Pizza was fine, regular pizza hut fare, service was inline with any other North American airport.  I went to the Terminal 2 location yesterday and was happier to pay for this than to pay for the food onboard the flight...besides, they were out of food when they got to me at the back of the plane...LOL.",q6XnQNNOEgvZaeizUgHTSw,0,0,3,DKg1h0ZUHsKHpBGXaO4nZw
