840128,2018-01-02,1,0JBqWzaSuOBHUo56RirJpg,Worst experience ive had at a jack. I had about like 4 dollars in coins and the lady working in the drive thru on new years day around 11:30 at night told me to count the money myself and to put it in little bunches for her but when I already had count it and told her how much it was. She then told me she could refuse service or I could walk around and of course I wasnt going to walk-in I clearly went thru the DRIVE-thru for a reason.,4YUG2UpKrpsltuF9vuKABQ,1,0,1,hWNHy1qSv6d2XKuP2TUyIA

My wife went through the drive thru to get our family something to eat tonight. When she got home we noticed they didn't put my chicken club sandwich in the bag. We checked the receipt and we were charged for it. We called the restaurant and the girl said we had to come before 10 o'clock tonight. We would get the missing sandwich and a free drink. The gas would cost more than that to get there. 

Nothing like efficiency for people wanting a $15 an hour raise.
