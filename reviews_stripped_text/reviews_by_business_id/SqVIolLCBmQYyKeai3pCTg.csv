Surprisingly, out of the blue, the gf was recovering from the flu and said she was craving McDonald's french fries.  Before i could get out the door to make a Mickie-D run the gf yells out asking for a filet of fish, "" anything else ? "" , she calls out for a chocolate shake, too.  Yep, I guess she's feeling better !

So i order:

Large Fries - $2.09
Chocolate Shake - $2.79
Filet of Fish - $3.79
20 piece chicken nuggets - $4.99
Diet coke - $1.00

My first thought - dang, Mickie d's ain't all that cheap, $3.79 for a filet of fish ?!  Seems high to me.

The taste ?  Holy cow - some of the worst food we've had in a very long time !  My guess is the nuggets were sitting out for several hours - we ate 4 of them and stopped.  The fries were limpy, wimpy, limpy.  The filet of fish was ok at best.  Shake was ok.

I don't remember... a while back.  But this joint was still fairly new.  We came here on the way to the airport to drop off our weekend guests at the McCarran for a quick bite to eat.

So we go in.. and there are flies.  FLIES.  all over the place.  I'm weirded out and the employees are acting like nothings wrong.  I'm not sure what to do at this point and I've suddenly lost my appetite.  So I approach the counter and I ask... what's going on?  And the young man at the counter was at a loss and kinda giving me the ""get out of here"" look.  So, I made a judgement call and decided that we needed to get out of there.  

I'm not talking about 1 or 2 flies that the auto door can bring in.  It was like walking through a wall.

 A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes.

4654882,2013-06-24,1,SqVIolLCBmQYyKeai3pCTg,"After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango.

  I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack.

  Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy.

  Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat.

 McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done.

It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby.

The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.

He does not know when to keep his mouth shut and he does not listen to what you say. He speaks at you not to you.  Super rude and disgusting 


This McDonald's is the closest to my house so I give them my business instead of the McDonald's my client Owns on Rainbow.   Every time I ask for something it is a fail!   The first time I asked for my order to be made fresh not only was it not they gave me the wrong order.  My daughter and her sleep over mates begged for McDonald's so I got them some of this stuff.    Well trying to call there is futile as they never answer their phone.  We had a movie appointment and I didn't have time to get the food replaced so we chucked it headed to the movies and are overly priced popcorn and hotdogs because by that time we were all starving.  So I talk to Pan finally but not after anyone called me back after leaving a message no after feeling very put out by not getting to speak my mind to someone.  Well I let him know about my experience and he was super sweet and professional offered me everything replaced and I said listen just make sure it gets better.  You're close to my house you'd be the only one I'd visit.  Well we go there again a few weeks later and the order everything was fresh and I notice he is the one who hands my my food. Hmm ok he's on it! I was very pleased.  Well this morning I'm like you know what I deserve to be bad I go and get a chicken biscuit meal I'm country it calls to me.   Well I get home and it's burnt I can't even eat it and I don't want to go back out and get a new one.  Do you guys compensate for gas or time when messing up orders as frequently as you do??  Does Pan have to be there every time every day to make sure your quality stays consistent and good.  And it's not hard they have a routine and way of doing things so you memorize and repeat it is not hard. It's tedious yes however a impel enough to know.  So I just called there to say hey look at this I took pictures it's ridiculous.  And I'm just like ticked off that I'm going to eat my apple and my chest morning is gone.  Boo for your inconsistent service and letting product in which I received even go out of your food window or service counter.  Shame on the workers who passed this out.   I just called corporate and the lady is like I can offer you a coupon for a free meal. What do you mean for the meal I just paid for that will get tossed in the trash. I just bit he hash brown and it's so bitter and disgusting I call back this assistant manager answers I tell her about the situation and she says oh is it the hash browns ? Oh so you know and you let this slide ? Wow have pride in the work you do whether it McDonald's southwest or you're Bill Gates.  For goodness sake you are continually ripping people off as they are not getting a product that should be expected I a certain fashion anytime you go and purchase it.",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,3,3,1,q2IjAGISMWs1QYxf8faNOQ

You do have to put up with the horrible parking lot/ gas station traffic if you park and go in the dinning room is loud/small with tons of little kids running around (no playground for the kids and the parents seem to let them run wild)

Napkins are by the register not by the the straws or the soda machine so make sure you grab a few when you pay for your meal or you will have to push your way to the front to get them afterwards. 

There are other McDonalds near by and you are better off visiting one of them.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,1,2,tCn0Vf3duFLU2-Rq29TizA
