The service was great. Food comes out hot and fresh and the portions are huge. 

I like to get the Lula kabob when I go here. It's ground beef but it's so flavorful that it stands out among all other ground beef experiences I've had. I've also had lula kabobs at other establishments and they're easily the best. The lamb is super tasty here as well. I'm not  crazy about lamb in general but they do it well here. 

I love the salad that comes with entr√©es. Entrees come with salad, bread, and your choice of rice, fries, or half and half. The fries are good too. 

The portions are good too. You get so much bang for your buck. And the menu is pretty diverse. Besides the meats, they also have salmon and shrimp.

The first time me and my family went in it was amazing!!! The last three times I've gone it has been horrible! Staff is lazy. Cooks don't do things correctly. Food tastes completely different then before. You can tell they got cheap on their quality of meats and produce. Over heard the staff talking bad about guests after they complained about their food. Big no no! The guest they were taking about even heard it....I felt pretty bad for her. Also when ordering pita bread please do not throw them in the microwave while your guests are watching!

I tried the beef and chicken kabob. I really liked the texture of the meats, super tender and juicy. However, it was a little bit on the blander side. I wish they offered some kind of garlic sauce to dip the meat in. I got a taste of the lula beef kabob (ground meat) from my buddy, and that was much more flavorful. I'm gonna have to get that next time. The salad that comes with the entree is really refreshing. They also give you a jalapeno pepper that's super spicy so just a heads up. 
The menu is pretty diverse and also offers some vegetarian options.

At 10 I started to wonder what was the delay and I had heard nothing so I went online to check and the restaurant closes at 9:30. Called GrubHub who also got the confirmation they received my order. However, it soon became apparent that they simply toddled off home and no one ever bothered to tell me they weren't going to be making and bringing me my food. So at 10 almost everything is closed. They could have at least let me know so I could've had more options sooner but instead they let me sit hungry for an hour and never even bothered to tell me they would not be making the food.

I decided to go with the combo so I can try the lamb chops, chicken and beef lula (ground and formed into a skewer, just like kefta) and a beef kebab.  The lamb chops were tender, cooked til pink and the flavor was spot on with barely any gamey taste.  The lula both had great flavor and it's a second favorite to the chops. 
I went with half rice and half french fries.  The jasmine rice cooked in either butter or olive oil with chicken stock was not what I expected, but obviously went well with the amount of protein on my dish.  Next time, I'm skipping the frozen fries.  What was I thinking asking for well done fries and got less than mediocre steak fries. I can knock it, since I've tried it now.  

The decor is modern, with gray and white tones to set that contemporary look.  I like it, but you would never expect it judging from the outside.  I think it took the place of the Chinese restaurant that I may have done take-out a couple of times. 

The hummus is a classic and you can't go wrong with the simple ingredients- garbanzo, olive oil, tahini, lemon juice and of course paprika to garnish this beautiful spread.  

The waitress and staff were helpful and on point with refills. Next time, I'll have to give the gyro a try, which is usually my go-to dish.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,6,5,4,4hZ7g6RHL-f9AGHZmx0pQQ
