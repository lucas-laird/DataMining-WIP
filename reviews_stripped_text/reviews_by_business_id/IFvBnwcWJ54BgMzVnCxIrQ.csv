Add on a pickle and some nice cold potato salad and I'm set. The service is friendly and fast.

I looked over the menu and decided on The San Francisco sandwich on sourdough with macaroni salad. I had a really hard time deciding on the sourdough. My first instinct was to get it on an everything bagel, but the pumpernickel looked fabulous, as well as the wheat, and the marble rye. I then saw the high crown on the sourdough loaf and the rest was history. I also ordered an everything bagel with plain cream cheese while I looked over the sweets. I had remembered hearing good things about the coffee cake and the black and whites. Decisions decisions. I chose a whole coffee cake, why not, it was $2.50 a slice or $5.00 for the cake. 
I took my order to go and headed home. 
I opened my order and inhaled it. There was so much turkey on the sandwich and the sourdough was soft and pillowy. The Mac salad was very creamy and the noodles perfect. The bagel was good with a chewy texture, the only downside was it could have used some salt in the everything mix. I added a pinch and was happy. The cream cheese was silky creamy and there was lots of it. 
Later in the day I unwrapped the coffee cake, while I prepared my afternoon tea. One bite and HOLY MOLY was it good! Tender crumb, moist, so much flavor. Mmmm. They also serve Chieti coffee, which is locally roasted here in Vegas for $1.85 for a large cup.
While the sandwiches are a little on the higher price side they are delicious and that coffee cake is absolutely scrumptious. I will definitely be back.",plLPOMp3k7h8-B9NBDA00A,1,0,5,c2Lr9jpGuuTLXRpR6twvGw

This is a super cute lil ol' husband and wife owned, neighborhood bagel house. They have, by far, the best nova lox bagel in town! We always order the Lox Platter $13.99 - Nova Lox, perfectly ripe tomato, red onions, capers, a dill pickle spear and your choice of bagel and cream cheese. I typically get the sesame or everything bagel and scallion cream cheese for this. It's superb and such a great value for all of the high quality lox and fresh goodies loaded up on the plate. Make sure to request your bagel toasted, it is sooo good!

If you don't feel like getting that much food, they also offer a lox sandwich as well, about $10 or less. It's also generously stuffed and usually I can only finish half. Their bagel sandwiches and platters are piled high with a lot of fresh ingredients. The bagels are baked fresh daily with a unique variety. We love the cheddar bagels, sesame, onion, garlic, everything, cinnamon raisin, and they also offer French toast bagels! Their bagels are huge with a desirable soft and chewy consistency, which also crisps up nicely in the toaster. The different cream cheese options are hand-mixed in house. I love the scallion or the cheddar jalapeño cream cheese.

As with a typical New York style deli, their deli case offers a nice selection of bakery sweets, NY Silverlake Cookies, fresh baked bread, deli meats, cheese, prepared deli salads.

This is a locals hang out and it gets very busy, especially on the weekend mornings. It's also nestled amidst the Sun City Summerlin senior living community, so you'll definitely catch a lot of regulars.

I just went for a quick lox bagel to go but it was loaded up and came out quickly. No complaints. A great start to a morning or a lunch destination for sure. Prices are on the higher side (my bagel was $9+ after tax) but the quality is good and people are nice.,JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,4,mHKZtt1hxax5vKKJ3DAovA

We got the Sliced Lox Platter ($13.99): Lox, red onion, tomato, capers, dill pickle, and your choice of bagel and cream cheese. I opted for a lightly-toasted Sesame Bagel and Scallion Cream Cheese. We really enjoyed this platter. The lox was delicious - great flavor and texure. The bagel was also great and perfectly chewy. This is probably one of the better bagel and lox I've had in town.

I also took a 1/2lb. container of Chicken Liver and it was all right. Nothing to write home about (I'd prefer it in the form of pâté), but it was enjoyable with French baguette, fresh onion, and fleur de sel.

I do wish they were closer since I don't buy several bagels at once and would prefer to stop by for the lox platter or a sandwich. Unsure about future trips considering the drive.

Located on North Rampart Blvd under various names across the years, Life's a Bagel opened in early 2016 in the same plaza as German Bread's Bakery, the team formerly behind Sterling Bagel taking a calculated risk in opening so close to the Sun City Summerlin population, many of whom have already established their favorite New York City replacement in the form of The Bagel Café.

Not seeking to copy the success of their nearby competition, the space as well as the menu substantially smaller, Life's a Bagel instead focuses squarely on its eponymous bready rounds, more than a dozen varieties made each day with housemade Cream Cheese, Lox and various Deli Meats offered alongside a handful of cookies and cakes both imported and made on-site.

Not going so far as to boil their Bagels, a legitimate gripe for native New Yorkers looking for the authenticity found back home, Life's a Bagel nonetheless achieves the effect of a malted exterior and dense center with a thin skin by way of a recipe that shortens fermentation, the Egg version rich and far better than those found commercially while both the Cinnamon-Sugar shellacked French Toast and gooey Cheddar are more like something that would be found at Einstein Brothers than Panera, the crumb lightly stretchy and taking well to toasting, but just as good eaten as served.

Importing Italian Cookies from New York based Silverlake, a good choice albeit a little disappointing since The Bagel Café produces their collection in-house, a better choice comes in the form of toothsome Coffee Cake riddled and topped with Cinnamon Streusel, the Black & White Cookie perhaps the best in town with a cake-like case topped in slick frosting that makes no attempt at sugar restraint. 

***Not a Bagel expert by any means, but having tried some of the best, Life's a Bagel serves a good product despite not adhering to traditional methods, the Coffee Cake and Black & White showing that with a little more effort these folks could potentially raise their game.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,3,LSlqRrsf8MJnHcjBisNs3w

I decided on the Nova Lox Platter with an onion bagel. I was pleasantly surprise how delicious and fresh all the items on my platter were, from the smoked salmon to the onions and tomatoes. One of the best lox bagels I've had in awhile. And my rate was based mainly on this dish and the friendly staff that we're welcoming and helpful.

Bagels here are soft, but not too soft, chewy, but not too chewy, and have a really good bite. I don't know the machinations of making a bagel are....really...like what yeast, or what they boil it in? But whatever is happening back there has made magical yields. 

Also, of course, I will mention pricing. This place is really reasonable for quality of food and product. Nova Lox Sandwich $8.49, with lox nothing short of amazing. They have $4 breakfast sandwiches. And...just an array of items at a good price. 

They have a really good selection of sandwiches, breads, and spreads. So far in the 20x I have come through, my favorites are the everything bagel, pumpernickel bagel, egg bagel, smoked salmon spread (bomb) and also they have an everything croissant (wuuttt).

I can't get enough of the scallion cream cheese and the bagels are always fresh. I ordered a cob salad and the produce was fresh and even chopped per my request. The meats are great and the sandwiches are huge!! Great service . Definitely will recommend this place to others.,AXBLrwsZ8mcruTJZQPshxw,0,0,5,BNmVCEoV0NAywC36Btz-nA

Unfortunately we are moving to Mountians Edge, I am certainly going to miss this place! I usually stop in once a week for a piled high bagel sandwich which comes with one side, or a big bowl of soup. The soups are great, but get there early for it because they tend to run out by 2pm which is when I would pop in. The bagel itself is always good because they are baked fresh daily. The vegetables on the sandwiches are always crisp and fresh and the meat and cheese is always delicious. The meats are deli fresh, not that store bought cheap stuff. The sides I've tried are chips (kinda hard to mess those up) and the macaroni salad. The macaroni salad is great! It has amazing flavor. Their little cookies and cakes that they bake from scratch are also lovely. Very reasonably priced for everything too. I'll certainly be stopping by while in the area in the future!!",IK3ESfOGnftvxFRoBXiLlw,0,0,5,YSsA3Qf36RQCTTltvtIeBQ

My only real complaint here is that they put a little too much cream cheese when you have them prepare a bagel for you. Not a big deal though. It's the only authentic Water Bagels I can find in town. The coffee is pretty good too.,4_x6qrBcYNhXwWm9UZBUOg,0,1,5,nq2in9JVjORuzo5RO-5nZA

Bagels are better than Einstein's, and the sourdough bread makes me feel like I'm back in The City - HIGHLY recommend!",BmXFqkusXnF013Ueg1fD3w,0,0,5,5P1kis3DVqOxS3YF6pCQ8w

When you mess up an order causing an extra 50 miles to be driven, the appropriate response isn't ""meh, it happens.""  At least fake an apology.  What else will happen is me never stepping foot in there again",ilq8Zjr_YLbyL-AhMRReZQ,2,0,1,nNFQhDxSH0gzj8jiHKyclQ
