If you go to Fogo de Chão at busy days it is difficult to get the best cuts, but ....  for instance during lunch - they come up only with the good stuff - I would assume they know that they would not get rid of the sausages :-) 

Super attentively waiter(s) - some were very good and others even better.

After having the super disappointment at Ruth's before I was close to give up the dream to have descent meet at Las Vegas - but thanks to Fogo I have had my perfect finish at Las Vegas.

All the meats are so good, but I would suggest leaving room for the Rib Eye and Filet Mignon.  They pass those around later in the meal.  You could ask for them too from the waiter.  Go easy on the chicken and pork.  They are good, but the Filet Mignon and Rib Eye are too die for.  Melts in mouth good, barely have to chew it.  The salad bar is so fresh and so many choices.  It's also more fancier than most BBBQ.  This is a nice place to go for special occasions.  The price is $50, not too bad for a fancy restaurant.",aRo6zfre7CXAkloqNwAAJg,0,0,5,2DKl1yspJAUrRmEotPAKtA

Looks very elegant inside with a stunning wine cellar. As we came in and sat down the staff was extremely friendly. Very welcoming. This was our first time at a brazilian steakhouse so having our waiter explain the red light and green light for meats was exciting for the kids. The salad bar was to die for! the chicken salad was one of our favorites along with the hearts of palm, proscuitto, and apple salad. The variety of fruits is a treat for desserts and our children. When the meats first around the Gaucho chefs seemed to be very knowledgeable. I was blown away by the variety of unlimited meats! Filet, Ribeye, Lamb Chops, Parmasean crusted pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, ETC. Im sure I'm missing more but those are the ones which stuck out most. My wife eats her meats medium well and i prefer medium rare. The chefs were on top of our table entire experience. My servers Julian and summer were very quick to refill our waters and cheese bread.

My husband and I have ate at this place 3 times at this location and 2 at the flamingo location. But we prefer this location due to the people (their service) and price here. First off wide selection of meat. They have chicken, pork, lamb, and shrimp. A great salad bar. If you havent tried brazilian food you have to try it here, its sooooo goooood. (Awesome) All the servers for the meat are awesome but the one you have to check out is Chris (Geller). He is down to earth, very friendly, smiles all the time, and will go out of his way to get what you want and how you want it. The first time we went here he was the main server that stuck out cause of his personality. Also, Robert. This guy went out of his way to make sure I had fresh, soft cheese bread. It is one of the reason why we go there you can only get this bread at this place.  Another person came out after knowing I was waiting for fresh one that was in the oven but still gave me the other batch. But Robert came and apologized for the other servers mistake and got me the fresh one. His another one very friendly and down to earth. The managers are very friendly too, they go around saying hi to everyone and making sure your doing ok. These managers are what managers are suppose to represent - Milton, Chris, and Caleb. All these people work so hard to serve us and give us a great experience and excellent service. I'm telling you guys you won't regret it. The food is I can't even describe but soooo good you'd want to come back for more plus with the service. Honestly places like these are hard to find great food and with outstanding customer service.

966802,2016-05-23,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"Such an unfortunate experience, as I adore Brazilian steakhouses. Came here on Mother's Day, celebrating not only Mother's Day, but also a birthday. It was noted on the chit, as the hostess asked about the celebration prior to seating. After that, it was never mentioned again. Seemed odd to inquire about such things if nothing is going to be done. That was a very minor thing in the grand scheme of our visit here. 

Seating was a little delayed with no obvious reason, as the restaurant was almost completely empty and we had a reservation. Once seated, service was slow and painful. She was polite while at the table, but that was rare. She informed us upon arrival that the kitchen was already a little backed up, so the sides would be taking a moment. Ok, no worries, things happen right? Well, we didn't receive the mashed potatoes until 45 minutes after seating, we were constantly asking for bread, & the bananas were never refreshed after the initial serving 30 minutes after seating. The meat was far and few between and most of our time here was spent with no food on our plates, with gaps of 15/20 minutes without seeing a single item. We finally flagged down our server and requested meats, but those never arrived, after waiting an additional 15 minutes. We then asked for our check and chalked it up to a loss. I've never left a Brazilian steakhouse hungry before, but we all definitely did that night. 

Not sure if they were just having an off night, but I wouldn't waste my money on another visit here when I can easily go to Texas de Brazil, or any other Brazilian steakhouse for that matter, and get better quality EVERYTHING.",gP41WaMGvgVn2TbGMhtGcQ,1,0,1,Zx5uVEcswgxHVJsKqo6hsw

The zucchini at the salad bar is usually one of my faves, but today they were way over cooked and were too mushy. The mushrooms are also usually my go-to side with meats but they also weren't that good.

Didn't need reservations since we were 1 of 3 tables in restaurant. I like to use Open Table because of the points you can earn and redeem for gift cards and used a $20 card here. I did some homework before stopping by. They were running a holiday menu with special pricing at $50/person. Kids 6 and under are free and 7 to 10 are half price. Not bad since it was NY's day. We walked in just before 11:30am (our reservation time) but they weren't open yet. The posted hours stated 11am but it was NY's day and everyone was still recovering from their hangover. 

The restaurant is nice. It was like a sauna inside. The restroom was like an oven. Take a seat, order some drinks, and get started with the buffet. Try the traditional Brazilian cocktail, Caipirinha, $9. Sort of like a margarita and martini mixed into one. The selection of food is wonderful. Lots of fresh veggies and cheeses to choose from. I enjoyed the sweet potato casserole. I appreciated being the first person to dig into it. I made sure to hook myself up with lots of marshmallows. 

The meat will start coming after you return to your seat and the meat sweats will follow. Green means bring me the meat and red is I'm good for now. They started out with the chicken. Great flavor on that tiny piece of chicken leg. A few minutes after eating a server brought out some mashed potatoes and plantains. Then it happened. A serving spoon fell off the plate and shattered a water glass. The glass went flying everywhere. I noticed it fall into some of the food. I immediately took my son's plate and everything he just brought us. He thought I was crazy for passing back all of the food but I explained what I saw and he was apologetic. I did not like that he swept the broken glass on to the floor with my son right next to the glass. Not sure what he was thinking. My wife got a little freaked out because she pulled up her napkin a few minutes later and took some glass off of it. My mother-in-law wanted to leave but we just had them bring out new plates. We enjoyed the rest of our meal from there. 

The different cuts of meat were very good. My favorite was the flank steak and beef rib. I was surprised to see my daughter chow down on the different pieces of meat. I was impressed when she asked for a slice of the NY steak and beef rib. One thing you need to try is the cheese bread/muffin. OMG those things were to die for. Also, if you are into asparagus they have some cucumber sized pieces, albeit they are served cold. One more dislike I had was the same guy who broke the glass brought us some sauces about 20 minutes after we started our meal. It would have been nice to have them earlier. 

I appreciated that they brought my daughter a complimentary dessert for her bday celebration. We were celebrating over the weekend since her bday was coming up midweek. I wish my parents took me out to celebrate my bday. Haha! The food is good. I would like to try them out again without my kids. I love my kids but I didn't think it was the best place to bring them. I was more worried about what they would or wouldn't eat. Give them a try. Happy eating!",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,14,9,3,_thNjRQ0wCdDgSQH_5b3HQ
1413810,2017-05-14,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,Mother's Day early dinner for our family of 6. Very disappointed with the meat mostly rare/raw. We have equally consumed and discard the same amount of meat. We usually go to the Flamingo location and we have been there several times and really never had a problem with the way they serve their meats. We decided to try the Summerlin location to support our community but they need to step it up. They need to prepare and cook their meat well. I understand other people like their steak rare but man... most of it are literally raw. I'm always a fan of Fogo but this one is disappointing especially for a special occasion and spending serious money for dinner.,wvyaM-o_DA8CsPTUsUTHOg,0,0,2,pL8btaA2Yt5THst49wJtsA

1438082,2016-06-14,1,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"Came here to THIS location for the first time, during this years Restaurant Week :D I had once had Fogo de Chao for the first time, a few years ago, when it was participated in Restaurant week. We had liked it so much, we had looked forward to it the coming years... but for 1-2 years, they did not participate. BUT ! It came back ! woo !

We had a 12:30P reservation. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated by the window. Service was amazing. The waitress was super nice. Our waters were never empty and quickly refilled with any sort of depletion. 

We were told to check out the salad bar while waiting for drinks and the meats to come out. Salad bar had a wide selection of fruits, veggies, cheeses, cured meats and a few hot dishes (didnt really look but looks like brunch items). As their flyer states ""Fresh seasonal salads, exotic vegetables, imported cheeses, smoked salmon, cured meats, and more. Fogo feijoada (traditional black bean stew with sausage) served with rice, fresh orange and farofa (baked yucca flour with bacon), seasonal soup, and more. Visit as often as you like."" 

The main course seems a bit more ""reduced"" than we had originally experienced before. The flyer online states:

-----------------------------------------------

Continuous tableside service of signature cuts of meat. Prepared, fire-roasted, and served by our gaucho chefs. Choices include:
Picanha* (Sirloin) - Prime part of the top sirloin, seasoned with sea salt or garlic
Alcatra* (Top Sirloin) - One of our largest steaks, tender and thinly sliced
Fraldinha* (Bottom Sirloin) - Flavorful cut, with strong marbling
Cordeiro* (Lamb) - Fresh leg of lamb
Lombo (Pork) - Parmesan-encrusted pork loin filets
Costela de Porco (Pork Ribs) - Marinated and slow-roasted for tenderness
Linguiça (Pork Sausage) - Slow-roasted and savory
Frango (Chicken) - Bacon-wrapped breast or tender legs

Traditional Brazilian Sides - Warm pão de queijo (cheese bread), crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas. Served throughout the meal.

Dessert - Choice of chocolate mousse cake, key lime pie, or tres leches cake.

-----------------------------------------------

When we were sat at our table, the waitress had asked us if we were dining normally or part of Restaurant Week. Originally we did not know there was a difference. She had swapped the cards you use to show if you had more interest in more meat or not from a regular round one to a heart shaped one. 

Later we had looked at the flyer and had realized selections like lamb chops, filet mignon, rib eye, etc were not available to the ""restaurant week diners"". 

We had seen the rib eye brought to us but the guy quickly realized it was not part of ours and walked away saying hed return. Another had brought lamb chops to us like he didnt care. The lamb chops was flavorful but quite overcooked to point where some end pieces of the bone would break off easily and the meat be overcooked a bit. 

Aside from that, the picanha, alcatra, leg of lamb were delicious ! my favorite cuts of the day. We never saw the pork ribs or pork sausage. Chicken leg was pretty decent. Crispy outside, juicy tender inside. Friend noted his was a little on the dry side. 

Warm cheese bread with a side of herb sauce was delicious. The herb sauce reminded me of this cilantro herb sauce my friend had introduced to me. Worked wonderfully with almost anything. Brightness from lemon with a nice, fresh herb flavor, and olive oil. 

Dessert, 2 of us got the mousse cake, 2 got the tres leches, and i got the key lime pie. Mousse was nice and chocolatey. Really rich if you add the frosting and what not on top. But the cake base itself was nice and moist. Really the ""regretful"" cake. As for the tres leches. Super sweet, moist, but definitely sweet. ""diabetes on a plate"" as we nicknamed this. The key lime pie was the ""healthiest"" of the 3 but only by a little. Still a dessert in the end. Nice bright tart flavor from the key lime without the whipped cream top being too heavy. 

Overall, still a pretty good meal and to a good cause. Worth the price for lunch and the yearly meal. xD Service was amazing as said previously.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,3uk1AvdFIvqPLPqaLlnxoA
1479672,2016-02-02,2,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"Fogo de Chao has great food and service; the atmosphere is upbeat and elegant. This is definitely the restaurant you want to be dining in when starving. It is seriously very difficult to say no to the many scrumptiously smelling meat selections that are offered by tableside service.

The concept is the same as with other Brazilian steakhouses. There are numerous meat selections of beef, lamb, pork, and chicken. Patrons control the frequency by which meat is served with green and red chips that stand for ""yes please!"" and ""No thanks!"" respectively.

There is a great salad bar with a selection of vegetables, cured meats, olives, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, fresh cut fruits, imported cheeses. Served tableside are scrumptious garlic mashed potatoes, slices of crispy polenta, and caramelized bananas. 

My favorite selection of meats were the lamb chops "" and the leg of lamb or ""Cordeiro"" followed by the garlic / sea salt seasoned sirloin. However, you will be offered filet mignon, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, rib eye, pork ribs, bacon wrapped chicken breast, port sausage, and encrusted parmesan cheese pork loin.

Fogo de Chao offers a full bar service and amazingly scrumptious desserts. From the bar, I enjoyed a Brazilian national cocktail called the Caipirinha. It is made with limes, sugar, and a liquor called cachaca. It was good, but the excessive taste of lime did not blend well with some of the meat choices - like the parmesan cheese pork lion. 

I had the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The chocolate cake has a warm molten chocolate fudge center. This was very good; the ice cream was a rich complement to the chocolate. Although I did not get to try the New York cheesecake, I was told that it was the best cheesecake my friend has ever had. I believe him too because he refused to share even one bite. 

I wish Fogo would offer a cold gazpacho at the bar and tableside fried mozzarella, salmon, and grilled shrimp.

I love the male wait staff uniform - the pants are very sexy!! Our wait staff included Summer and Matthew. Thank you for a great dining experience.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,6,3,4,xKYt-29cpCM40ivrf_Cfhg

I used to live in LA and I would go to Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills every now and then. I love their atmosphere - this is a perfect place for a large gathering or a date as it is very upscale.

The salad bar is very fresh and has a wide variety. I always get the roasted peppers, asparagus, and mushrooms. There are other quality ingredients.  If you're not hungry, just go to the salad bar and veg out. 

They bring in some side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes, crispy polenta and the brazillian banana.

I tried all the meats that they had and my favorite meat selection: Lamb shank and bottom flank. They even had bacon wrapped chicken.

The service was impeccable and the staff appeared knowledgeable. 

I will definitely dine here again!

Service: The service was excellent. The Gauchos were attentive to the guest, the drinks were filled all the time. 

Ambiance: Upscale summerlin location great for dates, and the drinks that were prepared were good.

The quality of the meats here have really impressed me. At Texas de Brazil , the meats were so salty and got cold fast. Over here , it didn't get as cold fast. I could eat in a timely matter. Also , I did not have to down my water. Everything was perfectly marinated and seasoned. The top sirloin was my favorite since I really like my meat rare. Ask your server for the chimchurri sauce ! The meats didn't really need sauce to begin with but it adds a really nice flavor to it. Also loved the plantains which was kind of like caramelized bananas with brown sugar. I ate like ten of those lol. I must say the salad bar and dessert selection are a bit better at Texas de Brazil but you come here for the meat anyways. The meats were definitely worth the $$$.

The food was great, table service was so-so. 

The only down part of our visit was this. Tonight was cold out and they sat us next to the windows. The windows are single pane and let in alot of cold air. Plus we were seated near a side door which also let in alot of cold air. Almost half way through dinner the wife was cold. 

Continued with dinner and it kept getting colder. Me, I'm dressed in a polo shirt and jeans and a bit chilled. The wife is now dressed in layers. One more thing, there's a vent right above our table. 

The heat kicks in but someone left the a/c on. I got so cold i put on my jacket. We told one of the servers who went to double check this and assured us it was the heat. I'm bald and wanted so bad to put on my skull cap I was so cold. Never felt the heat what so ever.

1. Service- our main waiter was a little clueless (he was white not Brazilian and had no idea how to pronounce anything, rookie mistake) but the Gauchos were very good. The 2nd meat to come around was Picanha but all the outside pieces had been taken. I told him I would wait, and he winked at me knowingly. From then on he brought EVERY Picanha over to our table first so I could have an outside piece. This kind of watering is worthy of a Nobel Prize. Overall the meat flowed continuously, drinks were refilled (although the water is garbage, def spring for bottled/sparkling as Summerlin water is borderline Waco water) and sides were brought out continuously. 

2. Food- Most things measured up pretty good, here are the things that didn't quite meet top of the line fogo standards 

Pao de queijo -these are the cheesy poofs. They were very thick and dense, not large and airy which is how i prefer them- they clearly need to work this out as whoever is making them is out of it

Bottom Sirloin- this was a little light on salt for my tastes. The whole point of this meet is salt

Beef Rib- I didn't see anyone else ask for this, and they don't bring it out unless you ask. As a result I think it had been sitting in there a while too long and was therefore kind of dry

Picanha- pretty good, but some pieces the fat was still very white/not cooked

Limeade- not quite nailing these. Don't get me wrong, still quite good, but they are not as creamy/frothy as a well established fogo, and some of them had very little lime taste ( I say some as I drank like 40 of these)

They also didn't seem to have Filet, or non garlic ribeye- but it was lunch so who knows


Overall: This is better than the strip fogo for sure, not quite as good as the best fogos I have ever been to, but its 2 miles from my house so I will prob be eating there every other day.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,6,3,5,2s3YQIowNp3BDD6C65b6og

From the moment we entered the staff was very welcoming & helpful.  One of the men bringing the meat to the tables was from Brazil... Did not catch his name... He was Excellent! 

The meats were all excellent ... Two of them really stood out. 

Filet was tender & delicious.
Rib-eye was the very best... Tender, tasty, juicy. 

They talk about their house specialty meat ... For me it was ok, but nothing compared to the Rib-eye which was my absolute favorite. 

The harvest table has a wonderful selection of salad bar type items, plus more items which you would not typically find on a salad bar.  The beets were very good as was the Caesar salad. 
Asparagus were jumbo size! 

They bring polenta to the table & it is crispy & a real treat!  We asked for seconds! 

The fried bananas are like a dessert, so you may want to try those before ordering something sweet!

Love the fact that there are so many different types of meats cooked multiple ways. It's always a fun dinner when you are a Lil unsure what you will be eating. Their house special was amongst the favorites at our table along with the lamb chops. A definite must try. 

Though the food was pretty great, the service on the other hand was quite questionable. We started with one server but somewhere in the middle of the dinner we realized we had a new one (we assumed). The original server was nowhere to be seen but another couple servers kept checking on us. There was no handoff, introduction or update just a simple disappearance. We were sat in the middle back area so we did feel we were skipped or missed quite a bit when the meats were being walked around. There were a few occasions when we had to ask for them to come to our table or ask for certain meats to be brought to us. At one point a couple people were quite irritated since they couldn't get food.

I've always loved Fogo, but this one probably has the best service of any of the locations I've been to. This is likely the case because it never gets too busy here, and I've never seen 100% of the tables full. Not even on Saturday night! Seriously service is good here. They constantly come by asking if you'd like a change of plate, if you'd like additional sides or have a special meat request.

Don't fill up your belly too much at the salad bar though because the meats are excellent! Especially if you're a steak lover like me! While they also have chicken, pork, and lamb, my favorite cuts here are all beef! Filet mignon? Yes! Picahna? 2 slices please! And of course my ultimate favorite, beef ribs!

It was a couple days after when I received my bank statement. They added $93.74 on the tip amount which my total ended up being $368.44.

She never did bring a dessert menu.
Also, server disappeared forever, she never brought the mashed potatoes that are to come with the meal. On our 2nd round of meat we just asked some one else for it. Additionally, soft drinks are non refillable. They charged like $4 for an 8oz bottle of Diet Coke, never offered another. I would have happily purchased another bottle if the server had come back. 
As far as the meat itself goes, I received a very fatty piece of some bacon wrapped garlic steak. Didn't eat it. I asked for the bacon wrapped chicken, it never came. I guess they were ready for us to go. 
I did, however, enjoy the ribeye. The butternut squash and coconut soup was very good. 
Market table was mediocre at best in comparison to Texas de Brazil. The rice literally tasted and had the texture of Uncle Ben's ready rice, the microwaveable version. Beans had no flavor.

2734876,2016-12-16,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"I went to this location last night with my roommate and this time around our experience was not the best.  


We searched on google to see what time this place closed and it said 10pm.  We left our house around 9pm and arrived around 9:15pm. (We dont like being the type of people to show up to a place 2 minutes before they close).

I felt like that was a sufficient amount of time to dine without feeling that we were holding the staff hostage and from going home.  I am a server so I know what that feels like.


Diego, our server was very nice and performed his spiel as expected.  He did ask us how we liked our meat cooked and I liked medium rare and my roommate liked medium so we compromised and said medium rare plus. 

We were one of theee parties in rhe restauraunt one being a party of 8, the other a party of 4 or 5 and then us, a party of 2.

As soon as we flipped our service cards to green I felt like they were attacking us with cuts of extra well done meat that had been sitting there in the heat furnace for awhile because there weren't many people in the restauraunt.


Once they filled our side plate to capacity in less than 3 minutes, I had to flip my service card over from green to red to stop the meat overload.  Now some people may think this is great service but this felt rushed and they didnt even give us time to let the flavors of the meat marinate in our mouths.  

The Gaucho kept circling around our table with meat in his hand as if he was a vulture waiting for its prey.  This made us feel kind of uncomfortable because it sent the message to us that we needed to hurry up because they were closing soon and they didnt want to be there one minute past 10.

When we flipped our service card back to green, the attack of the meats began again to the point where I could not even distinguish the different types on our plates.  We flipped it back to red and he kept bringing more like they wanted us to hurry up!

I didn't complain because I did not want to enforce the stereotype that black people complain about everything and that we don't tip.  I'm a server and can attest to ""serverism"" - servers discriminating or assuming certain ethic groups dont tip nor have any type of class.

I did mention in a tactful way to Diego that the meat was a ""little overcooked."" And he did offer to re prepare whatever meats we wanted at the temperature requested..thats the only reason why I am giving this two stars.

Despite the rushed service and overcooked meat, we still left a $28 tip (23%) when I really wanted to tip 15 to 18 percent but I'm still trying to fight the stereotypes that black people don't tip correctly. 

I probably wont come here again just riding on this last experience despite me coming here for my birthday a few months ago and when the restauraunt was packed.  The service should have not felt so rushed especially when they werent even closed yet.",GJ68vqS-3M3R2OeAqQOCcw,2,0,2,PINwVet-tM7D_U0YkUmv1A

2827292,2017-08-08,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"I have eaten at several Brazilian Steak Houses in the past. When walking in this establishment, first impression is good decor. The food was reasonable , but the service was way off base from start to finish. Example..

Given a crappy table when other good tables were available, the place was 40 precent full when we arrived. I should have called em on it.

It took 30 to 40 mins for someone to ask us for a drink ? I had to ask for drinks.

A full drink menu was not supplied. Only expensive cocktail's. I wanted a beer, but that was a verbal process.

After ordering drinks, 20 to 25 mins and nothing. Again I had to ask where our drinks were. Remember this place was not busy.

Drinks came when we were 70 percent thru the meal !!!

I had to ask for the desert menu. At least 50 percent of the items were not available !!! We ordered three times as each of the items became unavailable.

We didn't have a dedicated server. Just random people filling our drinks and desert order.

The staff appeared unrefined, although the guys serving the meat appeared to have their act together.

400 dollar bill with tip and I felt I could have gotten better service at McDonald's. When I left I was bemused. Not recommended, I will not return.",yx3lO-jTllBoa2zQHYwK6g,0,0,2,v1p8mr68my1gwOsFXhwn1A

2911698,2016-08-23,5,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"This is the Fogo De Chao located in Downtown Summerlin, actually right next to Public School 702.

We came here last night with some awesome friends to celebrate a birthday. We loved our experience at the Flamingo location so much that we wanted to share a like experience with them on this special occasion.

It was alright. It definitely was not nearly as good as experience at the Flamingo location back in April, but it wasn't terrible either.

(+) We came in on a special promotion. For $30 at lunch or $40 for dinner, you would have All you can eat at the salad bar, plus all you can eat to 8 select meats, plus 1 choice of desert. This is WELL worth the price and only runs through the rest of August.
(+) Highlights for me food wise was: the bacon from the salad bar (damn, damn, damn!), the caesar salad also from the salad bar, the flank steak, and the sirloin steak. The bacon wrapped chicken certainly gets an honorable mention as well.
(+) the addition of the dessert was a nice touch. You have a choice between a NY cheesecake, a chocolate cake, and a tres leches cake. Portion was generous and my chocolate cake was scrumptious!

(-) Meat was noticeably much saltier than what we experienced at the Flamingo location...and this is what stood out to us at the time when comparing it to Texas De Brazil. A bit of a letdown.
(-) I'm sorry but I was NOT feeling the lamb. 
(-) It was very noticeable that some of these people (employees) do NOT like each other and it  kind of took away from our experience. Nasty and crude comments directed towards each other come off as unprofessional and tacky. 

The promotion is a great deal and well worth purchasing, but I would go back to the Flamingo location the next time I feel the need to do a Brazilian steakhouse. All that said, it was still a good meal and still worthy of 4 stars.

4 stars.

Yay! I'm a fan.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,13,12,4,YOXrC6XSsb7Vf6d42TWvbw

Beginning of our dinner was going great, servers were attentive & on top of making sure our drinks were full & had clean plates between servings.

It was when we mentioned we had the complimentary dinners that things started to go down hill. Servers didn't know what they covered & didn't even bother reading the back of the card where it said it included a free meal, drinks & dessert. We were charged for the drinks & dessert. We also had the manager point at us several times which made us feel very uncomfortable. Don't know if it was because we were getting a free meal or because they didn't know what the coupon covered. Either way that was plain rude and if they wanted to speak ill of their customers they could've done so in the back not right in front of them.

I'm still trying to understand why a place of this caliber would think this is ok, or did I just go here on a day someone forgot to dim the lights? I need answers. 

Other than that the staff was amazing. The salad bar was not the best. I had a few things off it and the potato salad was completely tasteless along with the Brussel sprouts. 
The mashed potatoes, plantains and fried yucca that was placed on our table was great. 

Meat selections here are great with the exception of one: the bacon wrapped steak was fatty and awful just as someone said above, I think they could very well remove it from the meat line up and no one would miss it.

To be honest I have to say I enjoyed Texas de Brazil much better and that really sucks for me because this location is right in my neighborhood unlike Texas de Brazil. 

Is this place worth the $49.99 per person, yes especially for me I am a lamb lover so that alone wins me over. But I think I may have to take a drive out of the neighborhood next time I'm in the mood for a Brazilian steak house.

The dining room design and arrangement is open and bright. Plenty of room between tables. The room was conversation friendly. 

Service was friendly and prompt. I would have preferred that the pace of the entrees been slower. Although the red and green sided disk indicates that you request service or pass is explained the wait staff continues at a fast pace like drivers ignoring a red stop light. However, there is no food shortage just ask for your preference or wait for the server to come around.
The variety of protein is plentiful. There are ten differently prepared entrees of  beef, pork, lamb, chicken and pork sausages  

Several sides are served at the table. Cheese bread, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas.

The salad bar has a wide selection of cold items plus a soup of the day however I recommend passing on the salads in favor of the great meat and poultry. The soup of the day was Butternut Squash which was flavorful but I would have preferred a thicker broth.

All of the roasted entrees were well prepared and the degree of cooking was available for all.

There was no line and the restaurant was fairly empty. I didn't mind, but you would expect a place like Fogo de Chao to be busy, especially on a weekend for lunch, but maybe it's more filled during dinner time. They have the salad bar you can get food from and they provide great service and courtesy bringing around meat and asking if you need anything. It's possible that it was because it was lunch, they didn't have a lot of the selections I was hoping for. Their side dishes that they brought out were really good, the bread, bananas, and mashed potatoes. At Texas de Brazil, the bananas were my favorite part of the meal, and I was hoping the same for Fogo de Chao, but they make their bananas a lot different and not as good in my opinion.

They bring out 3 sides (potatoes, fried bananas and fried polenta dusted with cheese). 

After tip and cocktails, we ended up spending around $270 for a party of three. For the price, I am probably going to stick with Via Brazil. I found the cuts of meat to be much better and the variety of sides and salad bar a bit nicer.",Clj5WdwsjRRBvN5byPvdlA,0,0,3,CX3YFpDenuCp6Or8ktytPw

We arrived just after 7 and met 2 friends in the bar. Our dinner reservation was for 7:30. Our friends had drinks and the bartender told us he would be with us in just a minute. He was busy tending to the other couple at the bar. 20 minutes later we were a party of 8 and we still hadn't gotten a drink order in. When the server said our table was ready I said we we would take it as we couldn't order drinks at the bar. I was hoping she would take the hint and get a server right over to take our drink order. 

So 8pm hits and we have been sitting at the table for a half hour. We finally have someone approach and take our drinks. After 3 people he says thats all he can remember and he will have to come back for the other drinks. I'm frustrated. I ask him to write down everyones order so we don't have to wait another hour. We get our drinks and now it's just getting comical. The wrong bottles of wine are brought out. The Vodka Diets are brought in two cups. One Vodka and one diet coke. I guess it's mix your own drink night.

Our group is pretty easy going so we are just gong with things at this point. close to 8:30 I finally ask a lady walking by if she or anyone could take our order. 

Some of our group only eat fish and I looked online and noticed they had a menu you could order so meals off of. Our server wasn't aware of any menu. She walked around confused then pointed out the back of the drink menu and pointed out a shrimp option. Then she said they had a fish sea bass but it was big so we wouldn't want that. Ok then... We all went standard dinner.

Everyone was nice so the service was more comical than upsetting. We were hoping that the food would make up for things. It did not.

The Salad bar had 20% of the items missing and nothing got refreshed thru out the night. The sides they brought us were cold and we got two small plates of everything for our whole table to share.

We would go on to order drinks that never showed up. The same server took one of the wives order three times and not once did her drink come.

Our favorite thing was we noticed that after the first round of food we stoped getting served. Our friend at the end of the table went Red with his card. As soon as he went green again the table got served. Back to Red.... No food for anyone. 

The food was mediocre. Some of the cuts were tasty but nothing really stood out. The whole group mentioned that Texas De Brazil blows them away.

At the end of the day nobody got sick so they were the big loser. Had they been taking drink orders I'm sure our bill would have been $500 more for the evening. 

Service 2/10 ( I only give it 2 because it was so bad it was entertaining)
Food 5/10 ( The Salad Bar was destroyed/sides were cold and not enough for the table/ food was ok when they did bring it around which was few and far between)

3625453,2016-03-11,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"I made a reservation for my husband's birthday through their website, but when I called to ask if we can come 10 minutes later, they said they had no record of my reservation. It wasn't a problem to walk in however. They are fairly new at this location, so maybe they're still working out some kinks. 

Before going into detail, let me say that the my meal was tasty and my husband enjoyed his steak. My daughter loved it, as she never experienced this type of restaurant before, and we allowed her to order desert for my husband's birthday. My fish portion was on the smaller side, especially considering it was $42. The salad bar was just ok. The soup was great, but I did get sick before even leaving the restaurant. Sorry TMI, but i'm keeping it real...maybe there was a cream or something my stomach couldn't handle in the soup. It tasted good going down as did the fish, but again, my tummy was not happy. The bathroom was really nice, thank god. Very clean and well kept. To be fair, I eat clean and typically don't eat rich foods. My husband said the meat was good. 

My husband got the full experience since he's more of a steak eater than I am, and I opted for the Sea bass only. Based on the website, I thought I was getting shrimp cocktail included but that's extra. My 6 year old was free, so that was a bonus. However, some of the servers did not offer her any meat. My husband shared his. Maybe that's what they mean by ""free."" I thought they'd be serving her. I did ask one of the servers to share the lamb chops with her, since that is her favorite. He obliged, but I had to ask. It worked out ok since my husband allowed her to taste other items, but I thought they might offer to place meat on her plate. I'm sure she's a better eater than most 6 year olds, so perhaps they didn't think she wanted any.?? 

The manager was nice enough to tell me to try some meat if I would like, as i'm sure he noticed I scarfed down my fish much faster than my husband could finish his experience. I declined as I was full, but i thought it was a nice gesture. They were still handling only about 2 other tables, so I sure hope they don't have to waste all the meat that is leftover when the restaurant is so empty. Perhaps that's why he encouraged I try some. 

On a Tuesday night last week, it was fairly empty. We arrived around 5:30 and there was one other table but they left shortly after. Two other tables were seated towards the end of our meal, So there really wasn't much of an atmosphere other than the servers who were all within sight and seemed very friendly. 

I was hoping to love it, so we could go back for Easter but I think I'd prefer a full sit down meal. The service was very good and food was fine, I just wasn't blown away. I've been to this style steak house before so I knew what to expect, but I thought I'd be more impressed with the salad bar and fish. Again it's a steak joint, so maybe I shouldn't review them for the fish but this is really a review for the overall experience and I did get full feedback from my husband on the steak and how it faired against other steak house. I might try it again if my husband requested it, but I don't think it's a place I'd crave.",hdd74MAafrVX8PHoRponGA,1,0,3,PWq8HmsKhEQmColqT5pP4w

Brazilian is really new to me and as a chef, I am impressed with how the meats were cooked. The service was really great, Minh and Chris in particular was really attentive and wanted us to get the best experience.

The only down side is when you get to taste the 7th steak, it gets tiring. I wish there was a sauce so there would be different flavors. 

As for the price, it is quite expensive. But hey, this is a really good experience. A good place to have a date or bring a family member to lunch/dinner.

3876224,2016-03-22,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"I love Fogo! It doesn't get any better for carnivores like me. If you want to eat a seemingly endless amount of delicious, perfectly seasoned steak, hot off the skewer, look no further.

Let's be honest though, I've never ordered any food off the menu. This place was built for the full experience, which is start with a light salad from the salad bar, and then eat as much meat as you can without having a heart attack.

If you go for lunch, the prices are about $35 each. Dinner is around $50 each for the full meat skewer experience. If you're like me, you can easily eat $35 worth of meat in one sitting (vs buying it at a restaurant) so while the prices may seem steep compared to many other places, you can truly get your money worth.

There's something like 17 varieties of meat that comes out on skewers, if I remember right. Anything from Sirloin, New York Strip, Ribeye, Filet Mignon, a couple varieties of Chicken, pork with parmesean cheese sprinkled on it, lamb, and a few varieties of meat wrapped in bacon. I found that basically all of it was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and all the servers who bring the meat are extremely friendly and courteous. And quick! If you leave your ""meat coaster"" flipped to green (indicating you want more meat) you will have a meat mountain on your plate within a few minutes.

My last visit, we went for a friend's birthday, and they also told him he could pick any dessert on the menu free of charge. He chose the raspberry cheesecake, which was a very generous piece and it was also delicious.

I mean the concept of  a Brazilian Steakhouse is phenomenal! I mean who doesn't like an endless amount of all you can eat steak, chicken, filet, ribs, sausage,  ect! 
The salad bar was a huge disappointment, they say it's the same as the other locations  but it definitely is NOT. The meat taste very different as well in my opinion.  Our waiter that night told us that it was different because the cooking process was completely  different. The caparinhas are an absolute must! It is a signature Brazilian drink that is to die for!

3950419,2017-01-01,2,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"My wife and myself both work as waiters on the Strip. Had to work New Years Eve. So, we decided to treat our family to a New Years Day lunch to celebrate the New Year. We decided to try this place. We were really looking forward to it. But it was a let down. When we made our reservation, no one mentioned that they would be charging dinner prices for New Years day lunch. When we walked in, the place was very very hot. The waitress told us that it's very cold when they get there in the morning, so they blast the heater. Well, ok. But once it's time for business, shouldn't the customers comfort be a consideration.

They tell you that they work in a team. But honestly, it leads to impersonal, amateur service. We were a party of 4. We ordered water. Another waiter then brought the water. But only brought water for 2 of us. We had to flag down another server and ask for 2 more glasses. The food was good, not great. One thing that I found really dumb was, after we had been eating for almost 30 minutes, a waiter approached and asked if we would like to try their sauces. 2 people in our party were almost finished. He ended up bringing mint jelly and horseradish sauce. They were really good. But again, this was not offered until our meal was almost over. 
It wasn't busy when we were there. When we we seated, there was only one other table. And only 2 other tables came in during our meal. But still, what you get is a bunch of waiters standing around, completely indifferent to the customers needs. Service would be so much better if you have one waiter, who would then know what is happening at your table, and can anticipate your needs. 
And then, as I mentioned above, when the check came, it was dinner pricing ($50. per person), instead of the normal $40. per person for lunch(our party was 2 adults, and 2 daughters). Working on the Strip, I know many restaurants have higher prices for New Years Eve. But none have higher New Years Day lunch prices. 
I gave this place 2 stars because the meats were fairly good.

Had a friend who is suffering from Cancer, wanting to celebrate his birthday.  At the last minute, he changed his mind from wanting ""fish"" to ""steak"", I said, ""I KNOW THE PERFECT PLACE!""  Having never dined at the Summerlin location, I decided this would be the perfect chance... 
Boy was I wrong.
Sunday Night - 7 :15 PM - The place has no more than 9 tables of customers (NOT ""busy"") - We get seated and our waitress had ""attitude"".  She acted as if the LAST place she wanted to be, was in that building, let alone working...  
Our table was missing the ""tongs"" used to take the meat.  I mentioned this to her.  She rolled her eyes and said, ""yeah, I'll get you some.""
And didn't.
We had our salad bar (which was missing the soup, when I asked, the girl stocking the salad bar said, ""We ran out""  I thought to myself, ""Sunday night, 7 PM - and they RAN OUT OF SOUP?"" ) Ok - we move forward...  The fact that the salad bar is not NEARLY as impressive as the Flamingo Location - it still had a nice selection...
Finished Salads, no sides delivered yet?  We did get bread (same girl with attitude), I mention, ""Could we get our tongs?""  She gave me a ""look"" and said, ""I said I will get them for you!"" (that was 20 minutes prior...)  I smiled and said, ""OK, thank you.""  We finish our salads and flip our coasters to Green.  Here comes the first selection of meat.   The guy carving cuts down a slice and says, ""You must grab it with your tongs"" - I told him we had asked for tongs twice and didn't get any - HE rolled his eyes and said, ""I'll get you some"" - he goes and tells someone else - they grab tongs in a hurry -and suddenly, HERE COMES MS ATTITUDE with MORE tongs!  We now have four sets of tongs!  The meat service was ""meh"" - All but one meat server seemed to NOT want to be their also?!?  (I have a feeling they have management issues?!?)  Desert time!  My friend wants the Vanilla Ice Cream and they inform us ""sorry, we ran out - you can not order ANYTHING with vanilla ice cream - oh - and we ran out of the chocolate molten cake, too""

Being a regular at the Flamingo Restaurant - who's Wait Staff, Management, AND Quality of food is FAR better than the Summerlin location - I will NEVER set foot into the Summerlin location again.  

FLAMINGO ONLY FROM NOW ON!

4074526,2016-02-22,9,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"Disappearing servers, empty salad bar, cold pão de queijo (cheese bread), cheap quality meats and ill prepared meats are just a few of the serious problems that plague this location. The one by the Hughes Center is WAY better than this Downtown Summerlin location. I wondered why it was so easy to snag a reservation for 4 on a busy Friday night. I'm hoping that means the word is getting out about how crappy this location is! 

I couldn't believe how empty the salad bar was! There was hardly anything available! Mostly just pieces of lettuce and fruit fanned out in a pitiful attempt to hide the fact that there were missing platters of food items. It's like they had the bare minimum that's required by the franchise. For shame!

The service was among some of the worst I have ever had anywhere. Our guy dropped off water, drinks and a few of the ""freebie"" side dishes and then disappeared, never to be seen again. Did he quit? Go out to smoke and get run over by a bus? Who knows. The meat gauchos weren't any better. While personable, it was like pulling teeth to get them to stop by our table. We had to BEG for some of the ribeye and filet -- and even then we were given slices so small that I COULD EAT IT IN ONE BITE. I understand those are expensive meats but when all you bring out of the kitchen is the chicken thighs and sausage, it starts to annoy me. This is NOT a cheap meal by any means but I felt like the restaurant was trying desperately to save as much money as possible -- at my expense.

The meats we did manage to get served were tough and either sorely undercooked or overcooked. The house sirloin was as tough as shoe leather. Nobody at our table could cut the dang thing and I chewed so much I thought I was going to have to go get a set of dentures afterwards. The ""house special"" ended up being spit into a napkin. 

The freebie side dishes were an afterthought. Everybody loves those little cheesy puffs of deliciousness, the pão de queijo, but our small basket was super stingy (TWO for our table of four adults). Adding insult to injury, they were served cold and never replenished. 

As I sit and write this review I get even more angry and upset about this entire dining experience. It was horrible. So bad that I have zero interest in ever setting foot in any Fogo de Chao again.  will never, ever go back to this location and I will shout from the rooftops to everyone I see so they won't spend their money at this disastrous restaurant.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,19,7,1,2Fw4B9GLgKBclGZGsmQR8Q

First, we asked for mint jelly for lamb, I asked 3 times, 3 different people told me it was coming and finally 30 mins later it came. Well, my lamb was beyond cold and I had to waste that piece of lamb.
Next hubby asked for beef rib and it finally came cold, on a small serving plate, rather than sliced off the bone. The beef was cold and yup, that took over and hour to get, he was full by that time. Sadly, he had asked about 5 times to get his cold beef ribs.
Finally, the watermelon had been sitting at the  salad station for quite a while and really looked unappetizing and was warm. Usually when you ask for new food, they will bring you a personal plate with a few slices of watermelon. Nope not tonight. Was told that's the watermelon we have for tonight. WTH?

I've been to the other one once or twice and to Texas De Brazil, many times, over the years. But this one is my favorite!!! The service is excellent! From the front door with the hostess and every server we encountered; everyone was checking on us, with regards to our overall dining experience, our meat preference, taking away dirty plates, giving us new ones, refilling our drinks, and getting side dishes- bananas, polenta (yummy!), mashed potatoes, bread (they all help each other out). 

I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. The lobby is smaller than the other one (Flamingo/ Paradise), but there is a single soft bench for waiting customers. The bar is to the immediate right as you leave the lobby. I loved the beautiful wood (it is a caramel hue) that was carried out throughout the restaurant floor with the trees in the middle of the food stations. The same wood is used in the bathrooms (very elegant, clean, too). Unlike the other one, there is outdoor seating.  

We had my birthday promotion to use (before it expired 12/22) on saturday (12/16/17- Side Bar/ quick shout-out to my mom who turned 81 on this day!) for lunch, so we (my husband, my son, and I) got here early. Not much of a crowd, maybe five other parties, besides us. Our little picky eater loves his meat. He kept saying yes, to everything meat-wise (sausage, chicken, pork, beef, salami, proscuitto, etc.) Hubby loved it. (I noticed after the 1st visit to Fogo, that the meat is not as salty as compared to TDB.) My favorite cut of meat, here was the bottom round, similar to Flank Steak (my fave at TDB). Hubby loved the Filet Mignon. 

Here were my favorites from the salad bar: the croutons (these were so buttery, oh my gosh, they were excellent), the meat and potato hash, butternut squash soup, assorted cheeses, smoked salmon with capers (this was excellent!), asparagus, roasted peppers, dragon fruit (*had to ask what it was*), and mixed fruit (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and black berries). It is smaller than TDB, but the quality is excellent. I might be missing a few other things, but this is from memory. 

For my birthday, we got to share a complimentary dessert, Tres Leches cake, and it was delicious!!! 

(I prefer to come for lunch since we can walk around the shopping center a bit. I didn't overdo it. It's taken a few years, but I am applying the 80/20 rule. I don't like being overstuffed, so it's insurance, because I don't want to have a bad night.)

4425964,2016-09-25,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"Came here with a 5 o'clock reservation for the first time yesterday to celebrate my wife's birthday, Hostess was kinda odd and we felt like we were rushed to decide which ""experience"" we wanted, weird vibe already?

Our Waitress didn't seem very courteous at all, but doing the ""have you dined with us before?"" with no emotion routine was getting even better. She even left us without saying anything about half way thru our meal, yes we both kept looking around to get refills on anything, I believe a ""manager"" even noticed us and had another waitress to start attending to us. 

We always judge the food first, service second obviously because that's what you're there for, the food. 

The salad bar was very skimpy with a ""small"" selection and looked like it's from any one of the cheapest buffet you can find from any casino buffet, not impressive at all. Some items with no description, there are no excuse for that at all. The spicy bacon with red pepper chips was a surprise and not in pleasant way, but in a wholly crap, is this red pepper chips on my bacon too spicy hot rude kinda way! :( haha
 
Now for the meats:
The ""House"" picahna was at first the most tasty, followed by the beef ribs, the pork chops, flank steak, filet mignon, then bacon wrapped chicken, chicken. The Rib eye, pork ribs, wasn't good at all at any point.
What I mean at any point is after requesting the other meats, both me and my wife we're noticing the inconsistency of the meats themselves? I guess you can say maybe it's different ""cooks"" back there, sorry I can't say ""Chefs"" because they would never be that inconsistent but hey they should come out pretty close to being consistent in texture at the least? All in all the meats were just average in both flavor and seasoning, more bland than anything. Nothing like a good steak house at all. 

Service from the Gauchos was pretty consistent except for the bigger/tallest gentleman that after being there half an hour started to put his blinders on and kept passing by our table, yes with both our ""GREEN"" ticket passes ""ON"", we both noticed you buddy! Haha, you even hired someone from the ""other"" Brazilian style restaurant.


First off, I'm sure you're probably the most expensive restaurant in a Downtown Summerlin's restaurant row by far, act like it! You've even got the concept wrong or management wrong, because the whole ""EXPERIENCE"" just did not come close to half of what you get from ""TEXAS DE BRAZIL"", yes I said it, and I hate to compare, but you just don't. Maybe it was an off time and day (Saturday @ 5) or maybe it was the staff and shift, but something is lacking a lot and I sure do not recommend it because you should be busy and rocking like all your neighboring restaurants right next to you!

If you've ever dined at other ""Brazilian Steakhouses"", you would know that TEXAS DE BRAZIL sets the standards for all and is the ""PREMIER"" Brazilian Steakhouse.

Birthday dessert was a pleasant surprise at the end, that's where your second star came from. All in all a very high priced dining experience that with a little help could be what everyone would expect, good off the strip restaurant.",qIOCztyFIOMm4oryf3xcZQ,1,0,2,1Nh40itVQQu5HfTl6rijsA

While the staff is very nice and accommodating, the food just was not good. Firstly, the salad bar area does not hold a candle to Texas De Brazil.  There is just not much variety. Now for the meats. Salty beyond belief, extremely fatty, sliced toilet paper thin.  Just not good. The polenta that came as a side was hard as a rock and dry as a bone. Frankly I would not  have liked this if it was free let alone almost $100.00 for two. Sorry Fogo, will not come back.

I want to talk about my Thanksgiving Day experience though. I decided to treat my family to Brazilian BBQ for a couple of reasons. My mom was fully prepared to wait in line at a casino to eat at the buffet. I know I would have been the one waiting in line while she played ...I had no patience for that! Especially when I walked through Red Rock Casino after we ate at Fogo De Chao I knew I made the correct choice because the lines were insane! Plus my mom has never experienced a Brazilian steakhouse. If you have never experienced one you need to go especially if you are a meat lover!    

I would describe it as a roving meat buffet. They have a circular piece of paper on the table for each person. One side is green (keep the meat coming) and the other side is red (Please stop I'm stuffed) . The servers will bring things like garlic sirloin , New York Steak, chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage ,lamb etc right to your table. We are a beef loving family so we ignored most of the non beef items even the turkey. My brother was enjoying it he said,""This was the best Thanksgiving he's ever had!"" ( very loudly) That says a lot because my mom is an awesome cook who always had a great spread of food for us during the holidays.  . My mom was also equally impressed . She loved the food and wanted to know if there was one in San Diego. The waiter said there is on in the Gas Lamp District. 

They will also bring warm sides to the table like mash potatoes, plantains, and fresh bread. You can get lighter selections at their all you can eat salad bar. They have pineapple, mango , tabbouleh, and other veggies and fruits. Whenever I eat here I like getting their limeade to go with my meal. It's made of freshly squeezed limes.It's very tasty!  My birthday just passed so we celebrated it along with Thanksgiving. Fogo De Chao let me pick one of their desserts to have for my Birthday treat.

We came to dinner with a group of 5 and while we had a TON of fun, there were definitely some need for improvement. I was really surprised - in a chain restaurant like this, the service is usually solid and they operate like a well-oiled machine. That wasn't the case for us.

One of my huge pet peeves in a restaurant is when you get food before your drinks. We had bread on the table and at least one round of meat before even one drink was served. After that, it took another ten minutes to get our bottle of wine.

The gauchos were all super nice - but a lot of the meat was overcooked and just so-so. We talked to a couple of the gauchos and the manager, and they ended up bringing some rarer meat after the first few rounds.

I didn't spend much time in the salad bar (as my boyfriend would say, ""that's how they get ya!"") but I did have some great cheese and Italian(?) meats.

4895916,2015-12-23,3,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"I came here for a friends birthday and was anxious to see how this dining experience would be.

Overall the experience was just ok. The food was good but the service is definitely lacking. It may be because they just opened but I do hope it gets better. 

I will speak about the food first. 

The salad bar was pretty good but I didn't want to get filled up on that so I only went up once. The meat was really good. I have to say I enjoyed the lamb chops the most. I could have had that the whole meal and been pretty satisfied. 

As I noted previously the service could have been better. 

As you may or may not know to be served at Fogo you are given a chip. You turn it up facing green to be served and turned down facing red to not be served. The people serving seemed to do a good job coming around at the beginning of our meal but towards the end even if people at our table had the green chip turned up they wouldn't come around to serve us.

Our waiter also disappeared half way through our meal and never came back. Usually when servers leave for the night they announce this to the table and let the table know who the replacement server was but this never happened. This made it very confusing towards the end of the meal. 

When we first arrived we told the hostess that we were there for a birthday and thought this would be conveyed to the waiter so he could assist us with a birthday dessert. This did not happen so in the mist of wondering where our waiter was and waiting on dessert we were left in limbo. When we asked another server when we would be asked about dessert we were given the response that they were waiting for us to tell them what we wanted for dessert. Since we were never given a dessert menu this would have been hard to do. At this time we conveyed again that it was a birthday and they final brought over a birthday tres de leche cake. 

This cake was very good I must say. 

I'm not sure if it was because we were there towards the end of the night (we left at 9pm an hour before close) or if it is because this newly opened but I feel the service should have been better. I don't think I'd come back again and if I did I would wait a little while for the service to improve.",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,12,1,2,mkqr97WyPohcoaqOIwOmWQ

So from time to time I would get a small sample of meat.  Didn't really care for any of it.  Some Filet h came by, my husband got some, he raved about how good it was, so I grabbed a piece of his, it was amazing!  Service was great up until this point. So I ordered ordered a Filet Mignon for myselfe, even though I was soooooo full already.  So we waited, and waited and waited I know it had to be minimum 30 min we waited.  By then the fullness has set in, and I was just ready to go.   They said give it a few more min.  So we did, when it finally came, I got a couple of slivers, it was really good, and tender.

I'm not usually the biggest fan of these types of places. For one, I feel they're overpriced. And secondly, I haven't had amazing meat that made me feel like my dinner was justified. Also, a lot of these types of restuarants overseason their meat. I've been to quite a few that the meat is so salty, you drink a gallon of water while you're there. 

The main reason I'm writing a review is because of their service. This place, by far, had provided the best customer service to us. They were so friendly, thorough, and just generally very polite. Each time I got up, someone (even the manager) would rush to pull the seat out for me. 
They made sure we enjoyed the food we were having, and they even offered us tastes of a couple of wines that we were inquiring upon. Even some upscale restaurants don't go out of their way for this. 
The reason I'm bringing this up - we have spent $300-600 on a dinner, and the service wasn't even CLOSE to how this place treated us. 

Overall - their meats are really good. They're cooked perfectly and not dried out (another thing I've experienced at steakhouses.) I personally love red meats to be cooked medium rare, and all of their red meat was cooked that way. That's always a good sign. Otherwise, please don't eat red meat.

WHAT'S GREAT?

The service...it's almost too good. They are always asking how you are doing, like literally 20 times per sitting. This weekend when I saw a server approach me with no meat, I asked them how they were doing before they could ask me...it got comical. The gauchos (servers) remember specifically how you like your meat and always come up ready to cut me some rare. Also, I always sit down and request to have the following: mint jelly, horseradish sauce, orange Brazilian steak sauce and chimichurri. Without fail, all 4 sauces come to my table in little bowls with spoons within minutes and I'm off to the races. 

The papaya cream dessert is insanely good.

They always have $25 off discounts on their facebook page or sent to my email during certain times of the year and the small print even allows you to use multiple discounts at the same table occasionally. $50 for two? Total? Sign me up.

It's a small dining room so you don't feel like you are in a factory where they are pushing you out to clear your table for the next guests, (Hello, Texas de Brasil).

WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT?

The salad bar is lacking...I miss the cocktail shrimp of Texas de Brazil, the lobster bisque of Via Brasil and Texas de Brasil. I definitely miss the beef carpaccio of Texas de Brasil and the melted mozzarella/oregano they have at Via Brasil. They do have a peppered applewood smoked bacon which is excellent, but I'll take beef carpaccio over bacon any day.

The meat is very good but not in the great category...by no means is it pampas planet hollywood bad but I think my recent 5-star experience at Via Brasil opened my eyes comparatively. 

Maybe this is great? They keep messing up the pao de queso (cheese bread) time and time again (and it is something to avoid when you hit a Brazilian steakhouse), but when it's hot and fresh, it's impossible to resist. Of the 6 times I've come here, twice they've totally forgotten it and I didn't ask, because hey, more space for meat. The other three times it was rock hard, cold and made hours prior, easy to avoid. One time they got it right and it got a hold of me like spiderman turning into the black suited spiderman. Get it off me. 

Overall, I've never walked out disappointed, leaning more towards stomach pains and disorientation. The service is great, the food is very good and I highly recommend a visit.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,6,7,4,-tx_g6mRoGIxR7i6jUIrwA
5146195,2015-11-13,3,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"Fogo de chao regardless of the location is always deserving of 5 stars. I've been to the locations in NYC, LA and here in the fabulous Las Vegas. 

However, this location is exciting since it's much closer to us. Even more exciting it has a patio seating area! I mean I'm still iffy on the thought of enjoying an exquisite meal on the patio but hey if the mood is right and weather is real nice you might just find me there. 

This is a Brazilian steakhouse (look it up) so come ready to devour perfected, various types of beef, lamb, chicken, and sausage and more. The salad bar is filled with unlimited amounts of heavenly calorie filled ""salads"". Forget I mentioned calories because at fogo no ones counting besides your scale the next day.

A couple friends and I decided to have a casual dinner (yes we have casual dinners at Fogo). We're regulars at the flamingo location! I think we'll remain regulars at that location. The consistency there is impeccable and honestly it's worth the extra drive. If you're not a casual $$$$ dinner type then I highly recommended you check out Fogo for a special dinner. The flamingo location is more intimate. I was disappointed in the lightening at Summerlin. I like my dim lighting seating arrangement. Personal preference and personal mood will depict this for anyone. The lights were too bright and the salad bar was smaller at this new location. In addition, each table had a plastic number card? Come on now that is so tacky. 

I would like to note that they were very attentive to our table hence we were 1 of 4 tables there. Also, we got there an hour before they closed. Specifically, we enjoy the lamb and we had to wait a few minutes for them to prepare it. Oh and if you're a lamb lover than don't you dare forget to order the hot sauce, jelly and chimichurri!! It'll server you right and while you're add it finish your dinner with an order of creme brûlée! Just do it and when your pants don't fit tomorrow; just remind yourself of the mouth watering dinner you enjoyed yourself. Overall, it's priceless!

5194012,2017-09-11,4,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"I realize that many businesses in Downtown Summerlin are struggling with high rents and lower than expected customer visits. I have heard this from many businesses and I can appreciate the struggle. The issue is when service or offering is terrible or declining when they offer this excuse. You must maintain the service and product offering in order to gain clientèle and loyalty. I really like this location and chain, so I hope they can pull it together.

I recently visited this location for a work lunch 9/8/17 and the restaurant was very slow (6 tables including ours) for lunch. The issue was not with the meat selection or consistency in keeping our plates full. The issue was with the ""servers"" never providing sides or requested drinks. Several members of the party ask for condiments and sides more than 3 times, and they simply never came. Two people at the table of 5 ordered non-alcoholic beverages that never came.

There were at least 3 people asking if we needed anything, but none of them actually followed through with bringing the requested items.

Stevia was requested with iced teas, and the server said that they had this - they have had this on four prior visits. It was discovered that the management now thinks its only necessary to carry sugar, sweet n low, and splenda and told me that I had to use what they carried. We decided to cancel our beverages and stick with water. The math on the up-sell of beverages, especially in a struggling restaurant, you would think they would have it together and ensure that every person ordered beverages.

The men's bathroom was dirty and needed a deep cleaning, otherwise the overall condition of the restaurant was very good.

I hope that this chain will bring in a better quality management team before this location joins the many closed storefronts in this mall.",Q7IoE5m2heQKThuVq3SYFA,12,4,1,eV-6tIWvtao_2dDy85bePQ

If you've never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before, it's essentially an all you can eat buffet where some of the food comes to you. There are people walking around with spears of meat of all types: garlic chicken, flank steak, filet mignon, lamb chops, etc. they eventually come to your table and ask you if you want any (answer should usually be yes). Everything else that you eat with the meat (veggies, fruits, rice, soup, beans, cold cuts, etc) can be found in a buffet table nearby. Fogo's food quality is amazing. Their meat is very well prepared and amazingly seasoned. The food in the salad bar is also delicious and complements the meat well. My advice is just to try everything, even a little bit of everything if you want to share with someone else at your table. 

The ambience of the place is pretty classy. I'd probably dress up whenever I come here to eat and eat here in special/celebratory occasions.

We had a reservation for dinner on a Sunday because we figured it would be packed. All Fogo locations I've been to are always busy. But we probably didn't need one for this place because they had lots of empty tables. There was no hostess in sight for a good 5-10 minutes. The salad bar is smaller and had limited offerings.

I normally get a Brazilian lemonade to wash down all the food I devour. Those things are simple and easy to make (you can find the recipe online). But you can tell they used whole limes rind and all because the lemonade was super bitter. They didn't use enough condensed milk otherwise, the drink would've been frothy and sweeter. Blecchhh! I asked for another glass of lemonade and it was worse than the first one.

On with the food...if you want a specific type of meat, you can ask for it and they'll have it to you in a few minutes. Not at this location. ""It'll be an hour and a half because we slow roast it"" said two different gauchos at different occasions. I get the slow roasting part but were they not expecting to feed people?

Months ago I had thee most amazing Brazilian steak house experience at Texas De Brazil!!! I figured they are like sister restaurants right? This should be amazing as well. Boy, was I wrong! I got the ugly red headed step sister version of Brazilian Steak houses this night. 

Not much salad bar selection to choose from. Not much meat selection to choose from either. All night we had the same meat, sirloin, come to our table. Like, WHERE'S THE REST OF THE COW? Ribeye? Are you there?! Lol! We literally had to ask 3 different waiters if we could please get some ribeye. 15 minutes later they tell us they had to go make some. Wow. Did I mention this place charges $50/person? Again, I could count how many customers there were in the restaurant. In fact, there was more staff than customers! I kid you not! So why is the struggle real right now?!?! WHY?! 

So whatever, our sides are getting cold and we are all getting pretty annoyed so we throw in the towel. Of course we have to order dessert, which by the way, is sold separately. Their Tres Leches cake, DELICIOUS! And that's about it. Great staff, not much selection, meat was okay, dessert was delicious, price was ridiculous for that experience.

My friends noticed that I barely touched any of the items from the buffet on my plate, as they barely touched theirs. More meat choices would have been a way better outcome.

The food, wow the food was delicious!! The amount of fresh food was overwhelming but I couldn't have asked for anything less.  I tried just about everything and I was never disappointed with every single bite.  They had many different types of meats to choose from! It was so hard not to love them all.  The fried bananas were wonderful and the mashed potatoes were creamy and satisfying. 

The entire staff was friendly and on top of stuff. They pulled out our chairs and pushed us back in. It was a fantastic dining experience.  

This is a must try at least once!! You won't be disappointed I promise.",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,1,0,5,Cd-u48EiazMkk7yN6TSl9Q
5659913,2018-02-26,1,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"My husband and I go here a couple times a year because they always have specials, such as bogo vouchers on Valentine's Day - each person gets a voucher for 1 free meal the next month. I'm fairly certain that they do this offer for Mothers' & Fathers' Day.

Ambiance is nice, the meats are good, but why 3 stars?

The salad bar doesn't hold a candle to the salad bar at Texas De Brazil. Not only are Fogo's choices not as good, the salad bar is considerably smaller for the same price. Chimi churri isn't on the salad bar, nor is it delivered to your table, so you'll just have to ask for it.

Also, aside from the cheese bread (amazing) the sides are horrible. The plantains are overcooked into a mush and the semolina sticks are always cool and tough. Getting a water refill is like pulling teeth.

If you want beef ribs, good luck. Before we had even sat in our chairs the last time we ate here (2/14/18,) I told our waiter we'd like to have beef ribs because we know that it always takes a long time to get out. We were assured that they made extra for Valentine's Day. We finally got beef ribs 4 or 5 more requests later, right before we got the check, about an hour and a half after we originally asked for them. The table next to us got a free dessert because they were upset that they asked for picanha more that 8 times while we ate - and it never came.

Service is spotty, salad bar is meh, but unlike Texas De Brazil at Town Square, you can actually hear yourself think and they don't overstuff the dining room with tables so that you're squashed between a million other people. 

I know we'll be back, I just wished they had the salad bar of Texas De Brazil (lobster bisque!!!)  and that service was more uniform.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,2,3,PvivsACVzkVBFe05SZaDOA

When we arrived the hostess was not there and waited to be checked in , a server notice we were standing there and asked if we needed a table . As he was walking us in the hostess took over.

The servers were not attentive at all , we had to ask for our side dishes and drinks .
The salad bar was good but everything was about empty.",M5Gip06dS8bpVO-e3XzApA,3,0,2,CZEJYk0Kt-LfW2pHrq9kEw
5661213,2016-04-25,0,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,Came here because we had a free dinner and it expires soon. The restaurant here is smaller than the fogo de chao off flamingo. As soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess and sat right away. They have 2 beers on tap but have plenty of wine and cocktails to choose from. The meat cutters were all nice and if we needed it a little more done or if we wanted a certain meat they were more than willing to get it done. Our server which I forgot her name was also very nice... Always made sure water was full and had clean plates. I'll def come back again!,oZ9NBQVAIXhTAUlUIPRBsQ,0,0,5,4hJxFQaWOWwqAAUv8OBVqg

throughout my whole experience, we received the greatest service from the FOGO staff. morgan recommended the best meats and knew her pairings with the sauces. my favorite was the chimichurri and the hot sauce. the meats were non stop and everything was delicious. i loved their PICANHA steak and couldn't stop eating it. it was seasoned so well and i love how it was thinly sliced with a bit of fat on the side. i couldn't stop asking for more. my card was always on the GREEN GO side. 

the market table provided a variety of veggies, cheeses, deli meats, salmon, rice, and many more! i like how you can keep going back for more. the server was saying that fogo is an all you can experience. my favorite was the fresh mozzarella cheese, quinoa kale salad, prosciutto, and baby corn. the brazilian cheese bread was the BEST part of them all. i couldn't stop eating them! very addicting. fogo also provides caramelized bananas to help cleanse your tasting palette. i thought it was very accommodating and a good idea. 

the service is top notch at fogo. my party and i felt so welcomed by the friendly staff. our drinks were constantly refilled and our plates were always changed. the staff also had this tool to clean the crumbs off the table and thought it was great! the restaurant is super clean and very modernized. i would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or a special occasion. i can't wait to come back for more!",vhDXdBeje8e7xYIIFmbYpw,19,15,5,0OwklwxorlYAeT--VY47kw

I have always had excellent service and think the Market Table (salad bar) is one of the best in this town. The meat service is overwhelming at times but that is the fun of the meal in the first place. I would give them 10 stars if that option was available !!

5821452,2016-09-07,1,bMZBkFrTI6uSYQB6XYnvnw,"So I've been to Fogo de Chao twice in my lifetime. First time was at the homeland of Sao Paolo, Brazil. I wasn't impressed then, as all the meats were overly seasoned and way too salty.

The fogo de chao in Las Vegas was better--not super salty and just enough seasoning. I carpe diem'ed on their ""summer feast"" special,  and since it included my favorite meat, the piccanha, I didn't care that it excluded a few items. 

Everything was good, but this place was much smaller than I had anticipated. Most Brazilian churrasco's I've been to have been much larger with a lot more areas for food. This place is smaller than Texas De Brazil, with fewer options.

And, the Pao de Queijo was SQUARE! Man!!! They gotta stay that cute round shape ya know? It kinda ruined my experience a bit, but the flavor was there so I was semi-content. 

Will I be back? I think the one visit was enough for me. I'll need to head back to Texas de Brazil one more time to compare.

The summer feast came with a dessert. The tres leches and the chocolate cake were both mehhhhhh. I'd skip these next time.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,3,4,YRczY_uOds8lW6uUA9U2jQ

The meat choices are varied and include beef ribs with meat sliced from the bone.  The very attentive staff will call over any of the gaucho servers with a cut of meat you'd like.  Filet, parmesan crusted pork loin, ribeye to name a few.

I think I should only have to say no thank you once when asked for after dinner drinks or desserts. Besides that part of the meal, we had a great experience, good food, and the drinks were good...
