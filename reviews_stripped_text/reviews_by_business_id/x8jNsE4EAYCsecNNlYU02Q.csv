I had a lot of special instruction for my sandwich also and they got it all correct and then some. I'm ordering more tonight for my nephew to try! So glad I found this place!",eiHrtUN3GqOppB9wNzMZAg,1,0,5,9C1sK1XrPgvLR2Ge-XBq2Q

1186441,2018-06-27,0,x8jNsE4EAYCsecNNlYU02Q,"Just ordered 2 meals from this place.  All I can say is I probably won't order from here again.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and my son ordered the chicken Alfredo.  On a good note the food arrived at my door and was very hot.  That's the end of my good review.  First off my expectations dropped dramatically when I looked at my meal and realized that they chopped up packaged, previously frozen chicken fingers as the chicken breast.  The rest of the meal continued to meet that high standard.  The marinara sauce was flavorless and soupy.  The pasta was over done and there was too much cheese on it.  My sons meal could only be called Alfredo in that it was a white sauce.  Other than that it was also flavorless and so loose that it didn't even cling to the pasta.  I don't know how their pizza is but the lack of care and poor food product they put out for the two most expensive items on their menus does not give me confidence they can do anything well.",sx3pDgr-_DCEWqWUX_0jNg,0,0,1,18wT-ynU5rIkz4kyPiVEeg

The service was quick, they called me before I got there I was expecting a 30 or so minute wait but within 10-15 minutes of calling in my order, it was already ready to go! Will definitely come back for middle of the week late night munchies!",A682Wp18J6QK9qS40B4srQ,1,0,5,LSlqCbgfslxR1Vw_0ED9iw
2467382,2017-08-19,0,x8jNsE4EAYCsecNNlYU02Q,I have been to their other restaurant on the east side many times and I love it but it was a bit far from where I live.  I was so excited to hear they just opened a new location in the west side right in the walmart plaza on Ft. Apache.  Had to try to see if its just as good and it was the same amazing taste.  Their pizza's are the best in town.,UOa_TNDEvBZS_9d7CYzaXA,0,0,5,O922pzA4uOyT52_qsfVnAQ

Whatever you do don't order the ""chicken piccata"" It was more of a bowl of spaghetti with lemon juice with sliced bland tasteless chicken. (I didn't take a pic

As for this place. I think we eat here more then anywhere else. Love their pizza, wings sandwich and even salads.

4683451,2017-09-01,0,x8jNsE4EAYCsecNNlYU02Q,We ordered 2 Breakfast Sandwiches at 3am. I call at 3:50am to ask what the status was. The girl had major attitude and tells me another 30 min really 1 hour and 20 minutes for 2 breakfast sandwiches and an order pancakes.

The guy who answered the phone just said ""okay"". And I asked if they could take this food back and send me th order again. and they were nice enough to do so. 
Last time I ordered Mexican burger from them, there was no meat patty in it. I am vegetarian and therefore it is perfect. This time there is a meat patty in it. So I call back again telling them I'm confused and I wanted no meat. 
The person on the phone said ""let me call the owner because this is the second time you are calling with issues with the order."" I apologized to them for the inconvenience and offered to bring the food back to them.",fldb9RZliap4O_cFKsvLHQ,0,0,3,9Tg5x3vePnPh--mpCCSA6Q

They already know my name and what i usually order lol. We've tried so many different menu items, and each one has never disappointed us. Their delivery is also super fast and the food always comes very fresh and still super hot! Their customer service is also definitely on point as the cashiers and the driver are all so friendly! They have lunch specials too and the prices are so good for what they give you! Definitely will continue to order from them!!",HBMQZrTaiupY5Ns7QM9L8A,2,1,5,HF4BIw8ukuw3wgd-REadWw

Totally ruined the salad for me and I ended up not eating it. I ate some of the chicken off it though, and the chicken was pretty good. Was really disappointed about the dressing though. The onion rings were okay. Maybe if I went in they would have better service. But don't really know.",9umiUnXJaEMhyvbVatLKrw,0,0,2,JK6BqATI35bERVxo4l4tGg
5422012,2018-03-13,0,x8jNsE4EAYCsecNNlYU02Q,"Ordered the chicken fettuccine and it was very, very bland. The sauce did not have any flavor to it at all. I called the restaurant to not complain, but rather to give them a heads up in case they overlooked that step and can remedy it before serving it like that to other patrons. Well, the person that took my call said I just had to add salt to it or request flavor the next time I order! I'm not one of those people that adds extra salt to food. My taste buds usually appreciate the flavor that already exists to the recipe. This place seems very inexperienced with the restaurant business. I will not be ordering from here again. Zero flavor and zero regards to customer service.",8C2wcfFiXqfY-dkNUl-6TQ,1,0,1,uZFzT6zu8rZO65nMJJWcXA
