It's unfortunate that someone reviewed 1 star due to misinformation. Went to this establishment but hesitated at the door since I noticed it was a little less than 5 minutes till closing; but a gentleman (Rod) came rushing out and invited me in! Talk about customer satisfaction! Ordered the Ribeye (medium well) dinner with fried rice and vegetables, cooked to PERFECTION. Enjoyed a nice conversation with the workers while waiting for my dinner. I will definitely be coming back to try other menu items. Most establishments wouldn't have bothered to welcome customers in right at closing, THAT deserves 5 stars on its own :)",hTAa0ZNBRBObSLF5SBeAdw,1,1,5,iimhNAfmc7U3mHP6mCGhjg

The sushi burrito is H U G E .... Way too much for me to eat, and not the sort of thing that you want to put in your car for leftovers. I felt bad throwing so much away. Split one with a friend.

That being said; I did not *love* the burrito.
It was too 'wet' - and while there was a decent amount of fish, I could hardly taste it over the sauces. Also, being so big and so wet, it was not easy to eat.

The menu here looks great, and I think that there is tons of potential for good food at a good price. Even though this wasn't a mind-blowing visit, I'll definitely be back.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,0,4,K2pYj4G7ac6qVfzEVwOqIg

Chef ""George/Jorge""  knows his stuff, and is pretty hilarious! (a trait of demo chefs) The staff is super friendly. They all have past experience from Benihana, Osaka and Sushi Fever.

Now if you're a fancy plate-and-setting snob and want to see a show, this place isn't for you. The food is amazing, the service is quick, and the price is cheap.

The dipping sauces were good but they only gave us what I think was one portion so that wasn't enough but the plastic sauce containers weren't even half full so we could have used a lot more.

This place ain't no Benihana's. No show at your table, but it does its job. The chicken teppanyaki is a steal at $8.95, and it also comes with your choice of soup or salad. The portions are humongous, and it tastes pretty good as well (too much butter though). 

However, the spicy tuna was terrible. I'm not sure if I had a bad batch of tuna or not, but it did not taste fresh, and it had a really funky taste to it. I ate two pieces and threw the rest away. Shortly after, my stomach started to hurt, and then I had the runs. Yikes.

I don't recommend getting their spicy tuna or anything spicy tuna related, but their teppanyaki plates are definitely worth a try.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,5,5,3,zgdAGC-ze8IN8uiUb5WIgQ

I came at a time when it wasn't busy, so service was fast.  I ordered the ribeye entree, which comes with a bowl of miso soup.  

The miso soup was served super hot and darker and richer than the miso soup I normally get.  Great so far!  

They were very generous with the rice, so it looked as if they skimped on the meat and vegetables, even though they didn't.  There was more than enough meat to fill you up.  The meat was medium rare as I requested, juicy, garlic and super buttery, which is just how I like it!  Grilled veggies (zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and onions) full of flavor as well.

I was exited to try this place out. Better than Benihana or Osaka?? I'm in!!
As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by this cheerful Asian guy, Rod. The other guy and the lady working here was also very nice with the smile on their faces. 
My scallop entrée came out in less than 5 minutes. Looked nice but not as nice as the picture that was posted on Yelp. After I took a couple of bites, I noticed the scallops and the veggies were drenched in oil. It was almost like floating in oil. Scallops were oily but tasty. Veggies tasted nothing but cheap quality oil, not edible. Brown rice had hard pieces, like they over cooked in microwave. Tasted like old frozen brown rice.
Rod checked on me when I was eating. He was talking to me about Japan (he was stationed in Japan for a year) and gave me 10% discount card for next visit. He was so nice, I didn't say anything about the food. (He smelled like cigarette smoke.)
I only ate the scallops and a little rice, but I felt like I was so bloated. I got major heartburn 10 minutes after I left here. I had to stop in CVS and get Pepto-Bismol. (I hardly ever get heartburn. I can eat 8 pieces of KFC Fried chicken and never got heartburn). I felt grease was coming out from pores on my face (Eww).

First of all (and this is just based off of my choice in food), I do not like cream cheese with my sushi. I usually try to avoid it if I notice it's in the description. But they didn't really display anything that shows a description of the ingredients in their Sushi Burrito so I got it not knowing it came with cream cheese. Once I discovered there was cream cheese, I honestly tried to tough it out hoping it would get better, but no such luck.

Their lobster and scallop entree would also have to be another favorite, delicious and unique flavors and texture. 

They also have sushi burritos and poke bowls that are absolutely fresh! The burrito is pretty big, I asked to have mine cut in half. The poke bowl had a sweet with a hint of spicy flavored dressing coating the fish, texture was definitely on point.

Within minutes, my main entree came. The grilled vegetables were plentiful and good. The chicken was well-seasoned too and I thoroughly enjoyed the fried rice. I really had no complaints.
