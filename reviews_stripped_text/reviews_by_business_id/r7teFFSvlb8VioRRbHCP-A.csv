This place is a very small hole in the wall. You order at the counter and sit at old cafeteria tables. That's no problem but the cash register didn't work and she couldn't open it even. I said I'd get change from the other food place beside them but they didn't have change for a 20, two tens was all that's needed. She started on my food and I went for change. Finally a manager comes in and tried to swipe my new un-scratched card over 20 times before his machine worked. 

I ordered a salad and the $5 breakfast meal. Instead of pancakes they subbed bacon for me, that was nice. They didn't have ice tea had to get hot tea. The bacon was thin and short pieces. The eggs were overdone not medium and runny like I asked for. Salad was okay until I bit into the egg I paid $1 extra for, big mistake couldn't finish the salad even. They did cut up the lettuce fresh but there was 3 eggs in a big bowl I should of known to cancel that when I seen it. 

Hope this review helps them improve and give customers a realistic review of this new place. 

The manager walked past and didn't ask if I was good. I'm the only customer, no one came in the whole time I was there. He asked how I was after walking back in but darn near shut the door before turning around and asking. Obvious other reviews are friends saying best service. 

Good luck if you try them. Take care",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,10,5,2,YcMfYIPtqpVatJPZP1Ogxg

4183619,2018-02-19,1,r7teFFSvlb8VioRRbHCP-A,Great spot! I'm usually in a rush in the mornings and this place is perfect for that. They offer a wide array of breakfast options that can be enjoyed in a time crunch and they have an extremely courteous staff. I usually get the egg and cheese sandwich with avocado slices and it keeps me stuffed until late lunch time. Highly recommended,YQLIJAq_kxnBfaWP9MgLWg,0,0,5,Tkxn8e-l6Lys1FlcrnhuhA
