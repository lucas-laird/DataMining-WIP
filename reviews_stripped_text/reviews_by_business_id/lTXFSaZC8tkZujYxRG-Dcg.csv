However I don't like the SoCal version of the Pastrami, and I wasn't there for a breakfast burrito, so I ordered a burger. It was 1030 am. I ordered the original combo with cheese, $9+. Service was quick. The amount of fries with the order was huge and pretty good.

I had the pleasure of meeting the owner and his father while ordering after a brief conversation of hamburger options and suggestions for my wife and I. 
And let me tell you. The meal did not disappoint!
And the facility is Spotless clean and well kept. 
I ordered a double cheeseburger and added bacon and avocado. 
My wife had the el caliente. 
Being a big eater I usually want another burger. 
Not today ! 
My burger was delicious and was it ever filling. 
Juicy, well seasoned and and fresh vegetables. 
The el caliente was the perfect spice with delicious jalapeños with just the right heat. 
Crispy well seasoned fries. 
I tried an order of onion rings which were colossal with a really flavorful r-burger breading 
Fresh Ranch dressing complemented the rings and everything was spot on!!!

1976664,2018-03-17,7,lTXFSaZC8tkZujYxRG-Dcg,"Apparently a chain from California, R Burgers opened a couple weeks ago and I've popped by for two positive experiences for breakfast and lunch. I love that you can get guac on anything, and it's so fresh!

BREAKFAST: Hit up the drive thru after a nearby workout, ordered the ham bfast burrito add guac. They also have a trio option with all of their meats if you really want to go hard. Burrito was the size of my forearm, came with two cups of their tasty house salsa, and half of it filled me up. Finished the rest for lunch. The mix of fresh scrambled eggs, crispy hash browns, and a bit of salty ham worked well with the fresh avo and acidic salsa. Might be my new favorite in town!

LUNCH: Opted to dine in this time for their signature R Burger that comes with guac and two thick slices of bacon, with their zucchini fries. Oh man. Burger was fresh and the toppings worked well, I do wish they could cook to med-rare instead of nearly well for a juicier burger. Barely made a dent in the portion of zucchini fries, which were served with a house-made ranch. They were so good but I can't put away what looked like four whole vegetables. Super filling lunch, everything was tasty, around $12. 

Service both visits was polite and fast, interior and exterior were clean, food was hot and fresh, portions more than ample. I don't eat fast food often but I know I will be back when in the area for work and/or a well-earned cheat meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,16,4,d82dpCj0m_SEguTc-wn7HQ

I had the signature R burger with zucchini fries.    Topped with avocado, bacon,lettuce, tomato, onions, and thousand island sauce, the burger was cooked well-done.  The entire burger was thick, and it was delicious.   The zucchini fries are ridiculously giant. 
They were good with ranch.   Ask for a box because I doubt you finish all of these if you are dining in. 

My wife, had an original burger.  Essentially the same minus the avocado.   She surprised herself at how quickly she finished it.   Was she super-hungry?  Was the burger just really good?   Probably a combination of the two. 

We also ordered some chicken fingers and fries for the kids.   Plenty of value with the portion for what you pay. 

What's amazing is their menu is so extensive.   Breakfast all day includes breakfast sandwiches, omelette, pancakes, french toast and more.   Salads, tuna melts, pastrami and other hot sandwiches, provide even more variety to satisfy your appetite.    Are you craving tacos and mexican food?  They have that too!

The inside is remodeled and looks better than how the former Burger King left this establishment.   When dining in, your meal is brought to your table.  Fast food, done well.   I'm happy to say we have another solid fast food option no matter what time of day it is.

By Cali I mean you will items like a carne asada burritos to a pastrami sandwich on the same menu. The onion rings are huge, the chile fries are a big portion only, the burgers are huge....do you see where I'm going at? 

As for the taste I would say it is very good! Depending on what you eat you can compare some of these items to bigger chains and see for yourself. The onion rings are better than Farmer Boys version. The Chile Cheese fries are better than Fat Burgers take on them and plus for the price its a steal. The Chorizo and Egg burrito is more tastier and less greasy compared to Robertos Tacos.

Now it's not fine crystal mind you, but there's nothing I hate worse then eating breakfast off a styrofoam plate with plastic utensils.

If I liked the breading on the zucchini fries and onion rings, I'd give this place 5 stars.  I like having onion rings and zucchini sticks with a little bit of crunch to the breading.  Like carl's jr zucchini and burger king's onion rings.  Although you get a ton more food than you would at your average fast food place, you are paying a higher premium.

Now, I was thinking it was going to be a diner or restaurant and was kind of baffled when we landed at what I thought was a burger joint. I look at the menu and they serve breakfast, burgers and mexican and at this point I thought this experience was going to be lack luster. We get our drinks, choose our table and wait. 
We waited briefly, as about 5 minutes later we are brought our food. As she laid that oval plate (about the length of my forearm) I was wowed. Then she also gave me my own bottle of syrup and i felt as though I was at a friends or family members house.  I wasn't peeling back the top of or chewing the corner off of a syrup packet, I had my own warm bottle of syrup. Now i look at the plate and see for sausage links, what I can guesstimate to be 3-4 eggs scrambled and 4 halves of french toast. The thickness of the french toast is about the length of your fingertip , from tip to the first joint.
Now I try the french toast and it is delicious! Its warm, fresh and you can taste the hints of vanilla and cinnamon. The sausage links was hot and the skin snapped when I bit in to it. The eggs tasted like I make at home. 
The portion was great for the price. The hospitality made the atmosphere super welcoming. For me, I love french toast and it is also in my opinion something very simple to make, so if they made this so well I can not wait to come back and try more of their menu.

I tried the drive - thru for the first time about a month ago and got only a burger - the bun was amazing and I was totally enjoying a real sink your teeth in burger  - even though they got my condiments wrong then I crunched on some gristle.  Ew.  Ok but they were new and it was real meat, that could have happened if I made my own at home so I cut them some slack.  
Today my daughter & I went back - cheat day!  Look out!  We went inside this time because I had plans! They wouldn't split an order of onion rings and zucchini so I got both knowing my son would gladly eat what I couldn't finish at home.  The photo makes them look amazing I was so excited!  Then the order arrived.  Two plates stacked high with dry orange food? 
Not kidding here's a picture next to some ketchup for reference.  I looked at the woman, ? , she said ""yes, that's how they come"". Ok, I'm adventurous I'll try it.  Who wrote those other Zucchini reviews?  What did they eat that was so delicious?  They could not have possibly have had what I had placed in front of me!  The zucchini had no flavor & my daughter said hers was oddly stringy.  I moved on to try an onion ring.  Do you remember Tony Roma's onion ring loaf?  Wasn't that to die for?  That's what I walked in thinking I'd get a version of.  Nope dry cornmeal breeding that the dude at the next table said looked like a plate of oranges.  This was not worthy of my cheat meal and certainly not my $12.  I brought it all back up and said I couldn't do it.  This is where ALL the employees started ""what's wrong with it?""  With a ""what's wrong with you?"" Attitude.  The cashier had such a mom attitude I could tell she was dying to tell me ""that's what you ordered now you go sit back down and eat it!""  Finally the manager came out & I just said I ordered the picture and we both know this is not the same thing.  He was very nice and gave a full refund that included my soda.  In all fairness my daughter ordered a tuna melt and she said that was very good.  I live close by so I'll try one more time, maybe breakfast is their thing?  For now 3 stars.  Not because it's orange like their onion rings, 100% because of the teams condescending attitude.  I feel for that poor manager.  Update: Changed to 4 stars because the gentleman is the owner, not the manager and he cared enough to respond...",tI2Z3Onpf8BurgEYhM5UEw,0,0,4,I8y6jgjRke-l-_a7gIMl_w

The drive thru lady is always great but today there was a new girl. I asked for extra ranch and she says they are .52 cents more. Farmer boys will give you as many as you want. It's not about the money its about spending $12 to $15 on fast food and getting nickled and dimed for a condiment. So I said ok can I get some ketchup. She says it's in the bag with an attitude. When I get to work to eat my food there are 3 ketchup packets. It's like going to McDonald's. They act like this stuff is gold. I wont be going back to RIP OFF Burger again.

I went through the drive thru. There was a little bit of wait, but not bad. The cashier was very friendly and fast.
Their menu is mostly burgsers, sandwhiches and fries, with a few mexican food selections.
The R burger was as I remembered, juicy patty, fresh lettuce, onion, avocado and buttery brioche bun.
The zucchini fries were great super crunchy with seasoned breading. The ranch was also great, it tasted homemade.
Pastrami burger was loaded with thin sliced pastrami and cheese. Very good.
Portions are generous and priced reasonably.

I pass this location often and always told myself that I need to stop in and see what they have to offer. I finally gave this spot a try and so glad I did! The service was spot on, food delicious, and the restaurant was the cleanest I've ever seen for a ""burger"" spot. 

Since it was my first time here, I took a few minutes to look at their large menu before deciding on the Veggie Burger and a side of Zucchini fries. Since I'm used to places giving you small portions for a side, that is what I expected with the zucchini fries, but no..when they brought it out, it was a full plateful! My burger was also large and filled with all the delicious and fresh veggies. They definitely don't skimp on their serving sizes here. 

My veggie patty had lots of flavor to it and had a good consistency to it. It wasn't dried out like many places that offer a veggie patty. They top off their burgers with red onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles and 1000 Island dressing. I think the dressing gave the burger a nice unique taste to it. The zucchini fries were amazing!! The zucchinis were moist, but because of the batter on the outside, they weren't soggy. They were crispy without tasting or feeling all greasy. The portion was large enough to share with several other people. I ended up taking most of it home and having it the next day. All I did to get them back crispy was to pop them into the oven for a few minutes and they were good as need. I'd definitely come back just for those!

The employees were very nice and they cared about their customers. They came around to each person's table and asked how the food was and if there was anything they could do to make it a better experience. They made sure to go around and pick up dirty trays, sweep and clean off tables as soon as people left. 

A positive experience for me.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,41,35,5,N5cuFntn88bWTrBrYKleaw

Welcome R burger!! I was taking the pups to the dog park and on the way I spied R burger and made a mental note to try it , my curiosity got the best of me and I stopped on the way back home, I ordered the Patty melt with a side of chili cheese fries , they made it into a combo and I was pleased , the drive home was excruciating as I was inhaling the aroma of a cooked to order burger and my dogs luckily latched in their puppy seat belts were curious as hell trying to find out where all that heavenly scent was coming from!! Anyway at home I opened my bags and boxes and was happy to see my extremely large order of chili cheese fries covered in a rich chili and tons of melted cheese!! But the best part of the meal was the patty melt! A nice size patty of ground beef cooked to perfection and lots of ooooey goooey melted American cheese with sautéed onions all layered between two slices of buttered and golden grilled rye bread!! The taste was heavenly and took me back to my LA days!! The fries were tasty and chili thick and of course you can't go wrong with melted cheese , but they did have a fishy taste to them , idk if they have a fried fish sandwich but maybe that's where that taste came from , by cooking both in same oil ?? They were good but they looked great just the taste was a bit off, will try them again though eventually! I have been back again and got the patty melt again cuz it is crave worthy lol this time tho I got the onion rings which are huge , in size and portion !! Wish I took a pic but they were hot and I was hangry !! They did taste great and were huge and crispy fried , served with a decadent homemade tasting ranch dipping sauce !!

4699927,2018-05-21,10,lTXFSaZC8tkZujYxRG-Dcg,"Solid 4 stars for the new burger spot in Las Vegas. Originally started in California, R Burgers actually serves more than just burgers and fries. They offer breakfast goodies like pancakes, eggs, and breakfast burritos too. 

The menu has something for everyone. I've had their grilled chicken salad and it was fresh and hearty. Dressing options included ranch, blue cheese, balsamic vinaigrette, and honey mustard. They used romaine lettuce and the portion was big enough for seconds. Chicken was grilled to order, so it was juicy and well seasoned. The burgers are the real stars though. I want to say if you like In-N-Out, you will like R Burgers in the sense that it is very fresh and made to order. Their Original R Burger includes avocado slices, which are always fresh and bacon. Cheese is extra. Speaking of cheese, they also have a grilled cheese sandwich on the menu. Simple, yet oh so good. The bread is buttered on both sides and the cheese is melty. The prices are ok. It's a little more than average, but I wouldn't say it's super overpriced either. I'm ok with paying a little more for better quality when I want a quick burger. 

The service in the drive through and in the restaurant has been pleasant and fairly fast.They do cook to order, so it may a take a little bit. The inside dining area is really clean and surprisingly well decorated for a fast food place. Everyone I have encountered with there has been friendly and helpful.

I love that I can drive thru and get this great quality of food. It takes a tad bit longer then your average fast food drive thru but, I am thinking it is because the food is made to order and extremely fresh. 
I tried the cheeseburger it was delicious, and again fresh the bun was awesome too.. the burger itself was a big sized burger and, was packed with care in a paper wrapper and a small box. I appreciated that it was packed with care for the ride home. I also tried the chili cheese fries YUM! Great chili! I am tempted to get a chili on a burger on my next visit. Also tried an order of the fried zucchini also yum! Served with delicious homemade ranch dressing. I don't think you can go wrong with any thing on the menu. Another note on the zucchini it re-heats great in the oven or air frier, I was able to enjoy them for a couple days. The portions here are huge. I had no idea when I was ordering hence why I ordered so much food. I thought I was getting a fast food sized portion. The chili cheese fries were a great value, it was a large styrofoam container for only a couple dollars I was shocked.

I noticed an earlier review of their veggie burger stated that it came with too much sauce and the burger was bland.  However, for me the amount of sauce was perfect and didn't seem like too much, and while the burger seemed like the Original Gardenburger that you get in the supermarket, it was still fine, although smaller than I expected.  They were generous with the avocado, but it is expensive to add on and I wish they would have the option of getting half the avocado for half the additional price.  I didn't try their fries, onion rings, or zucchini, but I was told they use canola oil to fry them with for those that may be interested and I will probably try them on future visit(s).  

When I lived in Southern California (La Habra and Whittier areas), there were a ton of these type of independent and local chain drive-thru burger/mexican food places and I assumed every city had these and was shocked that I couldn't find any of these type of places in the Las Vegas, NV area (aside from one other place which doesn't offer vegetarian options (other than side items) and is poorly rated on Yelp.  So I am very happy this place is here as it is close to where I live and I find the drive-thru very convenient.  However, for vegetarians, I would rank VegeWay on Jones in the Southwest area and the black bean patty at Smashburger higher as those are fantastic and I think both are homemade as well.  I also wish they would offer a bean or veggie burrito alternative (aside from their breakfast burrito) assuming it had a lard-free tortilla.  That would be nice!

The pastrami sandwich was very good are large. Had the original burger which had a lot going on so difficult to get a feel for the burger itself, but was good. The fish taco was exceptional lots of toppings and great taste.
The fries were average but the onion rings are an issue. They use full onion slices so they are very large with limited breading. Vastly undercooked and soggy. They need more breading and longer fry time to add some crunchiness.

I like to try smaller hamburger joints when I spot them and I'm not in the area often so I made a quick turn around and went to check it out even though I wasn't really hungry.

I decided to get their basic original burger with cheese just to give them a try. I have to report It was a very good burger. A nice thick patty. Not too big around, but I'm guessing it's in the 1/4lb range. A nice size for the $3.99 (+.60 cents for cheese) price.

What made the burger a standout was that you could tell all the ingredients were fresh. From the beef to the lettuce, onions, tomato, etc. it all tasted very fresh and tasty. 

Best burger I've had in a while. Definitely a step up from a Carl's Jr. for example. I'd rank them right up there with Five Guys and In N Out for taste and quality.

I'll definitely be making my way back in the future to try more of their food. The onion rings looked great and the fries looked fresh cut I think, but I wasn't hungry enough to get any this time.",TjKqZy-x4omeM5y9Eg68XQ,1,0,5,1BQwXGgIYTCN2Q_7l2LA6A

I enjoyed the zucchini fries, they are up there with Farmer Boys Zucchini Sticks. The Fries were standard. I was disappointed with this restaurant visit. I have to try it again. Those Zucchini Sticks are awesome!",f587WkOuLAotgXOVAybylA,1,0,3,CG9m-L8bHAERkYM7c3Th3g

The omelette had cheese inside topped with chili and more cheese. The zucchini fries are crispy and thick. The original burger has a thick burger patty, shredded lettuce, thick slice of tomato, thinly sliced onions( I wish they were sliced a bit thicker), and thousand island dressing. I'm definitely going back to try other items on their menu.",MyoPTXH9L8S_rmrssY4D3Q,0,0,5,JxRqR5LUdFrzzB0IHSkPIA

We ordered a Colossal burger combo with a drink and upgraded to the fried zucchini and a Topper burger wrapped in lettuce, at no extra charge. The burger patty in each burger must have been nearly a half pound. They were seasoned just right and cooked to perfection - nice and juicy. All of the toppings were fresh and crisp. 

The Colossal had tons of pastrami in it. The pastrami was delicious and added lots of flavor to an already flavorful burger. The Topper was topped with grilled mushrooms and onions. Could've used a few more mushrooms. The lettuce wrapped around the burger was just thick enough so it didn't fall apart and made for a nice substitute. The fried zucchini were hot and fresh when brought out to the table. The breading on it wasn't too heavy and, again, seasoned well. 

The restaurant was clean and the service was fast and friendly. Definitely deserves a return visit.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,1,1,4,BYKse3AWz0TxVG--rNtY7g

It was the first time coming to this place and they were very helpful. I got the #5 and my daughter wanted chicken strips. Soon after our food came to the table, my daughter was sad when she saw how delicious my burger looked lol .. I ate half of it and then decided to share with her. She kept my burger and said next time we come, she wanna get a burger !! I definitely recommend having a burger here since that's all I tried. They do offer all day breakfast and also have some Mexican food to choose from.",0GTanD35lGadNgiDp_a8cQ,0,0,5,O9zA-tIMoUh64e6n_DgQdg

The first two times we got the signature R Burger (#7). It was great both times, & comes with a lot of fries. (I recommend the ranch. Delicious!!) Today we decided to try something new. My honey got the Pastrami Sandwich (#9). It was HUGE! He let me taste it and it was very good. His only critique is it was a little dry. If a bit more mustard was added it would have been even better. I got the two taco plate with carne asada (pictured - I didn't think to get a picture of the Pastrami Sandwich though). My main reason for leaving this review is I didn't see a review on the tacos previously. The tortillas were a little flimsy, but the held on to the very end. I didn't end up with a huge mess. They put a lot of meat in the tortilla so it fell out as I went, but I mixed it in with the rice and beans. Very delicious meal & you get a lot of food for the price. We also got chicken taquitos to split and they were fantastic as well. Bottom line - you get a lot of great food for what you pay.

5576531,2018-06-20,0,lTXFSaZC8tkZujYxRG-Dcg,"R Burgers is the definition of deeeelicious.  They literally have everything a classic diner would have..breakfast, burgers, tenders, fries, shakes, and just to throw you off they even offer some Mexican entrees!  I didn't see one employee that didn't have a smile on their face.  All the staff I encountered during my visit at this location were very pleasant and eager to please.  I got the signature R burger and zucchini fries.  The zucchini fries were definitely crispy (which I appreciate b/c who in their right mind likes flimsy fries!?), the serving was massive, but I would change the fact that they have literally no seasoning on them.  It's a good thing they are served with ranch, which by the way I think is homemade because it was phenomenal.  Definitely couldn't have been store bought.  The burger was not dry and the avocado on the burger was v fresh.  The store is clean and if you dine in, they bring your food to you and you can leave it when you're finished.  LOVE THE FOOD HERE.

5805583,2018-03-17,0,lTXFSaZC8tkZujYxRG-Dcg,"Now I'm basing this review off the two times I've went.

I remember seeing this place as a future spot for R Burgers but forgot all about it. Luckily my brother lives in the area and my aunt who lives with him told me about this place, so of course my other half and I had to go and try it! 

The first time we went, the drive thru wasn't too bad. We ordered from their vast menu, a grilled chicken sandwich, beef and chicken taquitos, fried zucchini and a chocolate shake. For starters, the grilled chicken sandwich is huge! It definitely is a filler, the only thing is that the buns get super soggy so it gets mushy fast. The beef and chicken taquitos aren't bad, it's paired with their guacamole and pico. We thought they came separately like just beef and just chicken but both of ours were mixed up, i mean of course we gave each other the different ones, you may have to clarify more. Fried zucchini is excellent! Perfect breading and it comes with homemade ranch! And the chocolate shake was just like eating chocolate ice cream! 

Now the last time we went, which was yesterday, it wasn't as great as the first time, but maybe it was because it was busier than normal? Drive thru wait was a bit longer, and confusing. This time we ordered the R burger with cheese, a strawberry shake and zucchini fries. When we got up to the window the lady was about to give me someone else's drinks, I said no those aren't mine and she said oh you didn't order the coke and Diet Coke, I said no, the strawberry shake. Then she said oh, gave me my total and I waited. When she finally gave me the food I drove away. I really didn't realize the price until my girlfriend said something, I looked at the receipt and saw she charged me for the person behind me's order. I called the place to let them know I was charged differently and the woman that answered was like what did you get, I told her and she's like so you were charged $.34 more, I said yes. And she said would you like to come back and get your change or credit it for next time. I just said it's only $.34 it's ok, I don't live in the area. I just wanted to call so it doesn't happen to someone else. Anyways back to the food! The burger was delicious, again the buns got super mushy and it wasn't as enjoyable, so I ate it without the buns. The strawberry shake was on point, it would be hard to mess it up. As for the zucchini fries, they weren't as great as the first time. They looked rushed, the breading was sloppy and they weren't cooked all the way, as you could see the uncooked batter. 

But of course, I will try it again to see if they work out the kinks, I believe they've only been open for a month. But on the plus, they serve a bunch of options and breakfast is served all day!",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,2,2,4,Ewx2ASltep5yKATwISniPg
