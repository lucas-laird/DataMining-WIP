A dining companion ordered the house special breakfast omelette.  She, too was very disappointed in this expensive brunch entree.  She described it as ""blah"".  No potatoes or toast is served with this omelette.  At $15 one would think it would be served with a something.  Want a side?  $5 more.  Another dining companion ordered a burger ""medium"".

First, its customer base is much older than I would have thought and the conversations overheard provided some entertainment. This was actually a good thing because the food took an unusually long amount of time to come out. 

We all ordered from the restaurant week menu which supported the local food bank. The food was barely warm and not that tasty and actually rather bland, refills of drinks took forever and the server was barely around. None of us finished our meals and we didn't care to take them with us either. This place is all hype, don't waste your time or money.

I've had much better food that was much better priced and in an atmosphere more around my age group. We all decided it was our first and last visit to honeysalt.",Vdlbnz9pCnVQTX_fpnOwSg,3,2,2,L_h-k8Fx9KzEopg38qljIw

They have special evenings that they offer farm to table menus. 

Food is great!

Service decent. 

They are great on recovery, my husband received burnt brussel spouts and not only did they replace them, but the chef came out to check on the replacement spouts. 

I make reservations everywhere possible to minimize the wait time. One visit, image a reservation, the hostess informed me that they were just setting up the table. They do not have a waiting area so I had to carry my baby's car seat throughout the wait, which was fine, until 20 minutes passed by. I then realized that other parties were being sat before us, when they had just recently arrived. When we went to inquire about our table, the hostess replied, ""oh I forgot about you guys. I'm sorry"". We got to our table that was not even set for the number of people that we had for the party.

We decided to have the special menu for the holiday. It was completely forgettable. Underwhelming. Ironically the food lacked salt and sweetness. The oyster starter was a great start but it went downhill from there. Scalloped potatoes was bland and cool to taste. Steak was done well, not a huge wow factor on the seasoning. Sea Bass portion was small, skin was good but lost when pomegranate sauce was introduced. Best part of the dish was the Farro. Desert was bland. Could of used some of that honey in the title. 

The only saving grace of this experience was the wait staff. They worked well together and were well trained. The night cost me 150 bucks without booze and we left underwhelmed from the experience.

59930,2013-05-10,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"There has been so much hype about this place that I could not wait to try it out with my girlfriends for dinner.
The decor is adorable, very rustic chic. It's open and airy even when it got packed. One of my girlfriends and I arrived early for pre-dinner drinks at the bar. The service was a bit slow but very nice. I ordered a delicious vodka mint drink and she a strawberry prickly pear one. Mine was the better of the two by far. We were promptly seated at 7 and the waiter was quick to take our appetizer order. The table shared teh Charcuterie & Cheese platter and it was delicious if not a bit expensive at $21. The blue cheese with the honeycomb was divine and the marcona almonds were wonderful, a new favorite for sure. Service slowed at this point, while it was getting busy it was not so packed that we should have to wave down our waiter. My sister and I split the duck salad (called My Wife's favorite salad), it was delicious though the pieces of lettuce were a bit large in my opinion. We also split the waygu burger which was one of the specials. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bacon jam and egg really were a wonderful combination. The homemade chips were lovely and not too greasy. One of the girls in our party had the brick oven chicken and she was pleased with the chicken as well as the mac & cheese it was served with. By the time we were ready for dessert service had slowed considerably as the restaurant had filled up some more. It really seemed to get busy the later in the evening it got. We decided to get four different desserts and split them. The Brookie (a brownie cookie combination) was ok but I would not order it again. The triple layer cake was moist and had a really good flavor and the ganache was perfectly done. The two favorites were the apple pie in a bag which was devoured and the bread pudding. The best thing on the desserts however was the caramel salt ice cream, I wish I could have purchased a gallon to take home. 

I am only giving this restaurant three stars because it is so pricey for what you get. I have no problem spending money on good food and good it was but it was $30 good not $65 per person good.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,2,0,3,7pNmliF85cP2W92zkGKoOA
74195,2013-08-04,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I would rate this as 3.5 stars solid, so since half stars aren't an option I'm going with 4 (because some of the things I didn't like are more of a personal preference thing.. more below.
Ate there with my husband on a Friday night with reservations. At 6:45 the restaurant and bar both looked packed. It's a small space, homey-feeling with brick walls and a medium to loud noise buzz. We were seated near the open, very clean and efficient looking kitchen and between that and the dining room there was a long, sort of console type table where they finished the dishes (drizzle of oil, etc) before taking them to the diners, which I thought was a neat touch.
On to the food: I was really looking forward to the creamless corn soup with arugula oil, but was disappointed. I know that corn has a sweetness to it but I really think that this dish had to have been augmented with sugar because it was way too sweet. And other than that, nondescript; the arugula oil finish really didn't add anything to it or stand out as a contrast, so all I tasted was grainy sweetness. I didn't even eat half of it, hubby had a few spoonfuls and even though he has a palate much more inclined to sweetness than mine he agreed that it was just too much so for a soup.
However, that was the ""worst"" thing we had all night.. The turkey meatball pizza he ordered was fantastic. Great chewy/crispy ratio to the dough with the crust nicely blistered in a few spots, and the meatballs had great flavor. My only beef (or should that be turkey) with the dish was that it said ""shaved horseradish"" on the menu as an aspect of the dish (and the server even issued a caveat when we ordered it ""that has horseradish on it, is that ok?"") but I never even got a hint of it nor did he. I'm not sure if they forgot to add it, or if it was so little and/or mild that it didn't come through, but I actually adore fresh horseradish and would have liked to taste it. Maybe I'll ask for extra next time.
Along with his pizza he got the mac and cheese side which had kale and Anaheim chilies in it. Man let me tell you, this was GOOD. I usually avoid peppers because even the mild ones don't get along too well with my stomach, but somehow this had just the right amount of pepper flavor infused through the creamy yumminess and enhancing it as a whole. I couldn't stop stealing bites of it, and repeated that performance when he heated up his leftovers the next day. I'm not sure the kale added much, just small bits throughout but hey, it did make us feel virtuous for eating more vegetables. 
My main course was the bucatini with fennel sausage, also very tasty. I'm a sucker for bucatini when I see it on a menu, I like that toothiness (not really a word) that it gives being thicker and more substantial than spaghetti. I think the fennel sausage might have been made in house, it had amazing flavor that reminded me of the Italian sausage I grew up on; mixed throughout the pasta in irregular size chunks rather than slices or crumbles. Also had chopped broccolini which was tender-crisp, and was finished with pecorino cheese and just a very slight heat from red pepper flakes. I would definitely order this again. I'm in fact eating the leftovers now as I write this review..
 I wasn't too pleased with the dessert that I ordered to go and tucked into later that evening. It was billed as a ""coconut chocolate layer cake"", and I freaking LOVE coconut cake, and never see it anywhere. It turned out to be a chocolate cake with some coconut filling/flavoring between the layers. Minor thing I guess, but when you are expecting one thing and get another it's disappointing; I certainly could have asked for clarification before ordering though. The cake was just ok, not particularly memorable and just a touch dry. Hubby finished that off for me the next day.
 They had a good beer selection and wine list, we had the Estrella Damm Spanish beer that ended up going really well with the food we'd ordered. Minus points for the busser taking away my husband's 2nd glass of beer as the meal wrapped up, before it was empty. Pet peeve! In general the service was very good though, friendly and brisk but not too obtrusive and a manager stopped by our table to check on our meal as well. Overall:  neat place, liked the vibe, most of the food and a lot of the little touches. In cooler weather we'll return to sit on the patio and try some of the other dishes that sounded very delicious including the backyard burger and the charcuterie pizza.",G9dwfHMqyWo-plZQVGZUcg,0,0,4,Jm4Y7q_c-wXbH6icd_FBcQ

90418,2013-03-07,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt meets chic with organic with their modern country decor and their menu inspired by farm fresh ingredients. I love the way they've stuck to their theme with a bright, inviting dining area and a wide view of the kitchen.

My two friends and I were excited to try multiple dishes, so we decided to split each of our entrees. Their turkey bolognese and the meatball pizza were filling. Both dishes had turkey meatballs which were light and lean, but they were simply okay in my book. Also, farro pasta has a different texture than your typical pasta, so keep that in mind while ordering.

My absolute favorite was the Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. Just couldn't say no to a crispy, succulent fried chicken breast accompanied with cole slaw on a toasted bun! The dressing complimented the slaw and chicken very well and brought it all together.

Their service was nothing less than exceptional. Our water glasses never went empty despite how busy they were for lunch. What struck me as unique was that they included a notebook for feedback with the bill. Thought that was a cute and novel idea to get customers' opinions immediately.

As much as I loved their charming interior and excellent service (rounded up to four stars for that!), there's just something lacking about its food that doesn't reel me in.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,3,2,4,nVg0lM0CwXdnG8LZDdz_Kw
95618,2016-03-31,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I decided to go to Honey Salt to see if it would be a good spot for my mother's 75th Birthday celebration dinner. I had read so many good things about the restaurant. From the service to the food it was not good! They are not good at gluten free either.

Our server seemed very overwhelmed. I asked for a taste of one of the wines by the glass. He dropped it off and left. Other servers would wait for me to try it and then get a full glass if I said yes. It took him 20 minutes to come back and ask me if I wanted that wine.

We ordered the beet salad. That was the highlight of the meal. The flavors were good but the red beets were undercooked. 

We told our server that we are both allergic to gluten. We ordered the scallops and the ahi tuna and planned on sharing both. We had to send back the tuna. It was tasteless and the texture of the fish was not right. While our server said the dish was gluten free, I am pretty certain there was soy sauce in the dressing on the spinach (I only took one bite but my tummy does not feel so good today). We chose not to order another dish. I told the server I thought there was soy sauce in the spinach and showed him on the menu where it said soy vinergerette (Yes I did ask him about soy sauce in the dish when I ordered it). He said it was citrus dressing and that hadn't been changed on the menu. I could be wrong but there was nothing in that dressing that tasted like citrus.

The scallops were below average. If you are charging $32 for scallops they should be great. They were cold so the searing on the scallops got lost. They also tasted as though they sat in oil for a while.  The cauliflower was also cold. If you want great scallops go to Mon Ami Gabi.

124313,2012-12-18,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"It's not very often any more that I'm excited to try a new burger in town, and when I do I really have to make a conscious effort to not set myself up for disappointment. Honey Salt recently opened in Summerlin, and as an overall foodie I've been very excited to try this new spot. While I didn't make it there too often, I always enjoyed Nora's that used to be in the space, both the menu and farm-to-table concept of its replacement gave me much hope. So after impatiently waiting a few weeks to let the crowds die down I finally ventured in there for dinner one night (and ran into foodie friend Splurgemonkey). Did it disappoint?

The space itself doesn't look too different from what I can remember; the exposed kitchen is still on display for you to enjoy all the madness that goes on with food prep. There is a large faux brick feature wall with the Honey Salt logo, and some nice, simple decorations on the walls. The room is quite loud even not at full capacity, but at our small table for two it was cozy enough that we didn't have much of a problem. There are several menus depending on the time of day which I won't bother replicating here. The food is all regionally grown, and you can tell by the menu offerings and quality of food you receive that they pay attention to what they're putting in their dishes. I've heard many positive comments through friends and online about their meals, and really wish I could have had a bit more than the burger, but that's what I do and I was still expecting something great to come out.

What did come out was one perfectly crafted burger, but had absolutely no stand out flavors whatsoever. The meat was really great quality; it was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I ordered, but had no strong beef flavor, no char flavor, no seasoning, nothing. The $1 optional egg on top added very little, as did the lettuce and tomato even though they were all of very good quality. The butter pickles were the only strong and good flavor I noticed in there. Even the bun, which had a good sweet smell to it, had almost nothing going on. This could easily become the perfect burger if it had a secret sauce or just the right additional ingredient. All the other food we had that night was so flavorful and delicious, this should have been too. My girlfriend's steak had great seasoning, and some fantastic sauces with it; why did that beef get a different treatment than this one? In fact, adding the roasted Anaheim salsa that comes with the filet or even the potato bacon hash to the burger would make it incredible, but I shouldn't have to order a side of either to make their offering better.

Oddly enough, the fries were fantastic; they were cooked crispy and consistent throughout. They had great flavor and were better than a lot I've had around town considering how unassuming they looked. I was very saddened by this burger; as I said everything else we ate that night was heavily seasoned, flavorful and delicious, but this burger was so plain and frustrating. For $15 I really couldn't recommend it, that's just far too much for a Summerlin location even considering the quality of ingredients. Our entire meal, which included two cocktails, an appetizer, two main dishes and a dessert, came to $115 with tip, which I found to be way too much for an off-strip location. I usually skip dessert when I'm out so this is a bit odd, but my girlfriend skipped getting any sides with her meal which would have easily increased our total even with subtracting the cheap-ish dessert. Some of the other dinners I saw around our table looked great, although maybe a bit small in portion size given the cost. If you're looking for strictly burger advice here, I can't recommend Honey Salt at this time, and would rather send you across the street to Flemings.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,4,0,2,Y-G-wLYU0QX7lT4pIZjUVA

165829,2013-01-20,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"After reading numerous reviews about their Biloxi fried chicken sandwich ($13) being described as ""Chick-fil-A on crack"", I was definitely intrigued. I'm an avid Chick-fil-A fan, and in fact, it is probably my fave fast food chain. Unfortunately, the closest location is in LA, but whenever we are in the area, we will make it a point to stop by.

I have to vehemently disagree with the other reviews on this one. When I order a fried chicken sandwich, I expect a certain amount of crispy, crunchy texture. Honey Salt's rendition is more like a grilled chicken sandwich, albeit a decent one, and lacks sufficient fried goodness. In addition, the Durkee's dressing sauce was utterly forgettable. Not only are Chick-fil-A's chicken and selection of sauces vastly superior, but it's also a much better value. Alternatively, I'd rather get the southern fried chicken sandwich at the Cheesecake Factory across the street in Boca Park. The chopped salad that it comes with was an utter disappointment as well. It consisted of radishes, edamame, carrots, kale, pumpkin seeds, cubes of sharp cheddar cheese, and mixed greens. An interesting collection, but ultimately the flavors were neither harmonious nor enjoyable.

The blueberry pancakes with lemon curd ($13) had a nice, fluffy texture inside, but lacked any sort of exterior crispiness, the hallmark of a really good pancake.

Dessert was the highlight. Their triple layer cake ($9) was very interesting and tasty. It consisted of dense chocolate cake layered with fudge and banana cake with cardamom and coated with buttercream frosting. Although it is a bit pricey for the portion size and it could be more moist, this is the one item we would probably order again.

As for the service... let's start back at the beginning. After being seated, our server, Julie, asks us what kind of bottled water we want to drink. We decline and ask for tap water. She then asks if we would like to snack on some edamame while we peruse the menu. I'm thinking it is complimentary, ESPECIALLY since I do NOT see edamame listed ANYWHERE on the brunch menu, so we say okay. After we make our brunch selections, the bread basket comes out with some sort of bean dip. At first we are a bit confused. Is this what she meant by the edamame? Is this an edamame dip? If so, why isn't it green? BTW, the bread and lavosh was totally unremarkable. Several minutes later, we get the edamame sprinkled with some citrus zest. We end up adding some salt and pepper because it so bland. The shocker was when we get our bill and it shows we were charged $7 for edamame! We were both instantly infuriated. We wouldn't have ordered edamame to begin with and certainly not for $7! Not in the mood to argue with the server and/or manager, we tipped less than we normally would and even wrote a brief note why. We can tolerate slow, inattentive service to a certain degree, but not deception and trickery to run up the bill. As we looked around, we noted a few other tables who had said yes to the edamame as well. We found it odd that none of the other numerous Yelp reviews/tips mention the non-complimentary edamame.

In summary, the food itself rates about 3 stars. Deceptive, aggressive upcharging knocks it down to a 2-star experience overall.

Consider yourself warned. JUST SAY NO TO THE EDAMAME! IT'S NOT COMPLIMENTARY AND DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $7!",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,3,1,2,CR54EBNJgT4O-aoLAD0rNg

This restaurant is totally overrated and no way is this worth four stars. I love steaks, so I know the difference between a good steak and a bad one. This was a bad one. I ordered a medium rare flat iron steak, and they cooked it super well done. The outside was crusty, fatty, and tough to chew. I said the outside had a ton of fat, but that was until I saw the inside. There was a ton of fat in the center, so out of a five ounce steak, only about two of them were really edible, let alone tasted good. I ordered one side that was not brought out the correct thing, and then when the correct thing was finally on the table, it didn't really taste good. The only reason I gave this restaurant two stars rather than one is because the bread and the drinks were good tasting. Also, we never really had a waiter. One person poured water, and then we were left until we asked if we had a waiter, and the dealed with the manger, and never really got good service.

We were there for late lunch on Saturday and had a delightful time.  We didn't have a reservation and were immediately seated at a table behind the bar.  All of the decor, from the pictures to the china, was just right.  It felt homey and sophisticated at the same time.   I could see how much effort and care Kim & Elizabeth put into it (which makes it that much more special). 

I started off with one of the salads in a glass (Green Goodness Juice) which was delicious.  Very fresh and healthy but also filling.  I followed that up with the grilled cheese and Tuscan bean soup.  I'm something of a grilled cheese addict and this was one of the best I've had.  The sourdough and truffle fondue blend hit the spot.  The soup was also wonderful; very fresh with lots of flavor.

I live in San Diego and didn't have time to personally check it out but needed a nice restaurant close to the hotel for all of the out of town guests convenience. I contacted a few other restaurants in the area and Angie (the event coordinator) was much more helpful and responded faster then any of my other contacts so I decided to risk it and I'm sooooo glad that I did. We had 11 guests and everyone was raving about the food, especially  the monkey bread! I arrived before they opened hoping they would allow me to put up a few decorations, not only did they allow me in early, they kept checking on me and offering drinks. The manager introduced himself to me before the party arrived and then came back to greet the whole table and ask if he could do anything. We had a preset menu for the group, but they accommodated by making small changes to the meals on request at no extra cost. I also was only paying for lunch so I let the group know that alcohol would be separate (since I know my friends well, that could get pretty pricey quickly) and told our server that we would just figure out all the drinks at the end, but he made our lives so much easier and separate drink tickets for each person so there was no confusion. All of our food with our multiple changes came quickly and correct. Everyone at the table loved their food which says a lot if 11 People at a table were all impressed and didn't have a single complaint. We also had plenty of leftovers that we saved for the bridal party to snack on while getting ready for the wedding. The restaurant decor is also really cute.

I visited twice, service impeccable both times. Just before Christmas, our group had the fried chicken, scallops, a pizza, roasted cauliflower, tomato burrata & quinoa salad and the bean soup, it was all good, but not great, just seemed like something was missing from making the items taste awesome or worth the $200 bill.  I decided to go back again to give it a second chance, this time we tried the burger , caesar salad, yogurt spinach and bean soup again.  

Unfortunately the medium rare burger was all rare, literally soft raw meat falling from patty on to plate. I told my mom to send it back but she has fear of doing that, so she managed to eat 70% of it, not wanting to waste the $20, but it turned her off and she does not want to return. Her french fries were incredibly salty that they literally burned/irritated the roof of our mouths and tongues, I am assuming this is just a bad batch.

I enjoyed the bean soap first time but second time it was very bland, as was the yogurt creamed spinach.

All of their salads were delicious and the scallops good but I think VG scallops taste better.

I would recommend checking the place out as it is so pleasantly designed but not sure if the food will knock your socks off.

361759,2013-04-21,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Finally made it out to Honey Salt. I've heard great things and Yelp surely seems to like them. 

We went for lunch and my first impression was very hip decor. It looked like a restaurant you'd see as ""up and coming"" or ""trendy"". The doors were open, the patio was set, and it was a really warm atmosphere. Lots of people in the restaurant and it seemed really inviting. 

The food was great! I got the Grilled Octopus Nicoise. The Octopus was cooked perfectly. It wasn't chewy at all and the flavor of the dressing paired well with the Octopus. The ingredients of olives, fried egg, and potatoes were a great combination. I have never had potatoes in a salad before (aside from potato salad of course). It was surprisingly a great salad. 

The Fiance got the Backyard Favorite Burger. She really liked it. I tried a bite and I thought it was delicious! She added the fried egg and it paired really well. The seasoning of the burger was savory and it was cooked perfectly. 

From the review, you might ask why I didn't give 5 stars. My only complaint was the size of the  menu. There was a large option for salads (Market Greens) and sandwiches (In Bread We Trust). I realize I came during lunch and that menus at a nice place like this generally are smaller. I was just looking for a bit more selection.

I will definitely be back for more. There were many things I still wanted to try and the dinner menu has several things that look amazing!",GQQieareg5cwIAHw7stigA,0,0,4,NcM7rKGqktGuxpK5rm8Hzg
364522,2013-03-04,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"After reading some media hype about this new local restaurant, I invited some friends for Sunday brunch.  There were 3 of us total (not counting the wee-little one in the baby carriage!).  Overall, the restaurant is beautiful, the food was very good, and the environment is welcoming and chic.  For me, the food (and drinks) are a bit overpriced warranting a 4 stars instead of a 5.  

We arrived around NOON about 30 minutes after they open and were seated right away.  As we left around 1:30, there were still some empty tables.  

FOOD - My share of the bill was $47.  Whoa is right.  Here's what a $47 Sunday brunch off the Strip will get you.  For starters we shared the New England Fry.  It was yummy, but a small portion for the price.  Two bloody-orange mimosas set me back $20.  Again, overpriced for a mimosa.  I ordered the Filet Mignon stacked sliders with egg and cream spinach.  It comes with a side of roasted potatoes.  All in all, it was good - but didn't quite give me that ""OH MY GEEZ"" awesomeness I hoped for.  For dessert we shared the Cookie Platter, which includes 3 large warm fresh-baked cookies.  

The brunch menu was a bit odd to me.  I would like to see a few more breakfast items on the menu that are not pancakes, french toast, or monkey bread.  I'm not looking for IHOP food here, but I think the chefs could be a bit more creative  with their use of other breakfast foods.  


Am I glad I tried Honey Salt?  YES

Will I be back to Honey Salt soon?  PROBABLY NOT (unless they announce they offer two-for-one drinks!)

420922,2013-01-12,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Very nice surprise for a neighborhood restaurant. 
There was an enormous amount of help at the door and on the floor, maybe because it was a Friday night. At first, I thought that a guest opened the door for us, but soon I realized the wait staff is very casually dressed with jeans and any-top-they-could-find.  All and all, this garb approach is interesting.
The restaurant is a cavernous big floor with tables in the center and settees at the walls. Sitting six of us, meant to slide 3 adults in the settee for the full length of the table, where I thought that maybe they should pull the tables to allow easier seating. Since they were smaller tables placed together, this would have been easy to accomplish. Back to the cavernous big floor. Because there are very little materials in the restaurant that would attenuate some noise, the place has a tendency of becoming very loud, in addition to that, the music is kept at a high volume, in other words, if you want to talk to the person sitting across from you, you'll find yourself shouting. However, this loudness adds a sense of electricity around. I think most people dining around us, were enjoying themselves as we did.
The food is good; we shared four appetizers, but did not come with serving spoons or forks. This made sharing a bit strange since the only utensils you have are your own and using a fork that was already eaten with, would certainly prevent your table guests from dipping into that dish. We resorted to sliding things off the plates with knives. 
I had the NY Steak, which was well prepared with a hint of sea-salt over it. I enjoyed it. I did not enjoy as much, the spinach that came with it. The sauce they were in, was just too thin. Eating the spinach with a fork meant trailing thin sauce across the plate. I opted not to eat it. As with the appetizers, the four sides we ordered to share did not come with serving spoons. Same results as above. Personally I only tried one and would have enjoyed trying the others if I could only spoon them.
I tried the swordfish and that was well prepared, but as with any fish or seafood, if it is not ""impeccably fresh"" it will make its presence known. I realize that in the desert, getting the fresh ""catch of the day"" can be challenging.
We enjoyed this place, but giving five stars would have meant that everything was perfect. Maybe on our next visit I will be happy to add that additional star.",9wIbXqBLqYQa-Dgfkj5NVA,0,0,4,W4AJSak-VjsnC60LMR3b3A

I visited Honey Salt about a month ago on a business trip to Las Vegas. I try to stay away from The Strip at all costs when I come to Vegas...this restaurant fit the bill perfectly!

The restaurant is decorated in the design du jour of the 21st century...this rustic-farmhouse-chic thing...which I really enjoy! The walls are covered in exposed brick and mismatched mirrors. It makes the place feel less stuffy, but still cohesive and ""farm-to-table"" feeling.

I ordered the caramelized sea scallops with charred cauliflower, vanilla bean cauliflower puree, and truffle sauce. IT WAS TO DIE FOR! Some of the best scallops I have had in a very long time. I also had a key lime tart for dessert...INCREDIBLE! I wish this place was closer to my DC-home.

I will be back! Maybe tonight!?

They bring back the steak, freshly garnished, only to find it was still pretty rare, overly chewy, and just a horrible way to finish a meal.  By this time, not interested in finishing, and my dog has a $31 steak to consume over the next few days.

The scallops were cooked to perfection, the ahi tuna was so good and the Brookie and apple pie desserts are amazing as well. Service was impeccable and not just because we were there for a comped meal, my friend and I are both food photographers and bloggers and shared lots of pics of our meals on social media,  but you can tell they really put emphasis on service.

I got to try several other dishes on the menu that I hadn't had two nights before I got the grilled octopus again I tried the trout which was cooked so perfectly and we have the orange chocolate bread putting for dessert.  The maple bourbon cocktail was so good too.  The menu is reasonably priced, definitely a lot cheaper than the restaurants on the strip, perfect for a date night.

The food is just how I like it.  Fairly simple dishes made with great quality ingredients.  I really like the fact that they offer grass fed beef, and they also have organic chicken, and some decent vegetarian options.  The Mac and cheese is one of my favorite sides. It has Anaheim peppers in it which make it a little different. Everyone should do themselves a favor, and get the apple pie for desert. 

It's a little pricey, but worth every penny.  That just means I can't go every week. They also have some of my favorite servers around. They are all really nice, and great at their jobs. I have nothing bad to say about anything here.",AtQYz6I10rcXoSN4SrgW1w,0,0,4,il1ae-sS_Zi2tLzh7vCHag

We were seated promptly and the décor was lovely. The service staff was very friendly.

My fish special arrived and it was raw ( not just rare) with a huge blood line running through the center.  When I pointed this out to the waiter he stated that that was how this fish was suppose to be (someone else at the table had the same entrée without the bloodline and properly cooked). I then showed him that even with my knife, I was unable to cut the fish.  He apologized and returned it to the kitchen.

After 15 or 20 minutes the entire table had finished their meal and had their plates cleared...I had not received my entrée.  It should not take 20 minutes to re-fire a small piece of fish.

Elizabeth...If you are going to walk around checking on people's experiences (as you know a restaurant owner should!) make sure you stop and check on everyone....not just the people you already knew socially!

Be advised you will either need a car or be prepared to take a 15-20 minute cab ride if you're staying on the Vegas strip.  I got there around 2:00 and was surprised that the restaurant was still about 75% full.  I took that as a good sign since I showed up at an off peak hour.  Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and provided attentive service.  I decided to go with the Ahi Tuna Tartare Tostada.  The tuna was fresh and light and the yuzu slaw provided a nice acidic kick to the rich tuna.  

The only thing lacking was a little bit of salt.  I probably could have asked for a salt shaker, but it wasn't that big of deal so I just went with it.  All in all it was a tasty dish.  There were several other things on their menu that I would like to try, so if I'm ever in that part of Vegas again I'll be sure to stop by.",9U93GIZX00iEgfOTsW1taw,0,0,4,yMqf9F78ol_bGJIfxi38KQ
674598,2014-08-31,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"We decided to go to honey salt  for brunch to celebrate my mother in law and sons birthday. I made a reservation as we had 8 people in the group and placed a note on the reservation that we would be there celebrating  the two birthdays. Upon arrival I checked in with the hostess and let her know we had a reservation at 10:30am for 8 people under the last name Torres. She said "" oh yes okay"" and we were seated by who I assume is the manager. 

The table was nice and spacious and we were seated next to the kitchen which was neat. Our server was very gracious and attentive as was the rest of the wait staff. We never had to ask them to remove plates or fill water, they were always on top of everything. 

My mother in law ordered the peaches and cream pancakes , myself and two others ordered the steak and egg sliders my husband got the fried chicken sandwich and my children got the ""kids"" cheeseburger, we also got a pizza for the table to share. Everything tasted very good, and for the most part everyone enjoyed their food. My only plight with the food is that the portions are very small for the price and we ordered the cheeseburgers well done for the kids, one came medium rare the other medium. I didnt say anything because my son didnt notice and had eaten half of it. I also ordered the blood orange mimosa which was so so. 

Now the reason for two stars, not one person acknowledged that we were celebrating birthdays. I work in the industry, as a host, at one of the busiest restaurants on the strip. We acknowledge every celebration, every guest every time, especially if its noted on the reservation. This small gesture makes all the difference to your patrons who are spending their hard earned money at your local establishment. As we left I confronted the hostess, I saw on her iPad she didnt even check me in for my reservation but instead placed me as a walk in, then when she actually looked, saw my reservation and the notes. I asked to speak with the manager who could obviously care less and offered me a brownie to go which I declined.  My son is seven and he would have been very excited to have his birthday not only acknowledged but a desert brought out so we could sing to him and my mother in law.

All in all the food and wait staff deserve 4 stars. The management, host and customer service get a two. And I feel thats being generous.",koT8J5JIYI9j13HYgE1Nsw,2,1,2,__ww0HQLTFBeuw8j1t5xsg

The restaurant is open and airy, and it is fun to watch the kitchen and plate finishing table in action.  The (identical looking) wait staff was attentive and helpful (suggesting the $27 pork chop vs. $37 filet was refreshing to see) and the drink list was creative.

I don't know if they were looking down on us for coming in with a baby or just unorganized because we didn't even get acknowledged for another 15 minutes at least.  We were very thirsty and excited to try the bloody Mary's that were the whole reason we went there because they were suggested as some of the ""best"".  We were about ready to just get up and walk out but Finally - someone came along and asked if we've been helped yet - we said nope.  She said, well, I guess I will take your order then.

754686,2012-11-19,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Place gets packed early, walked into a charming atmosphere definitely not on the strip anymore but of course a neighborhood feel. The ambiance is cozy, with a beautiful brick wall and the HS logo on it. The bar is ok, not the greatest or exciting bar out there, to be honest it really looks plain, doesn't really fit in with the restaurant. They have an open kitchen which is great, you can witness chef Kim expediting the food and making sure it goes out right, much respect for that. Now onto the food, the menu isn't large as it shouldn't, their concept is fresh farm to table, and that is a very much the trend right now. We started off with the new england fry, which is a take on fried calamari but with fried clams and shishito peppers, the shishito was great touch but the calamari and clams was mediocre, nothing crazy or exciting, something you would expect at a bar such as BJ's or the yard house. Our second was the mama's salad, which was a frisee salad that consist of duck confit and quail egg on top. The salad was definitely light and fresh, duck confit was a bit dry and tough, quail egg was good, cant go wrong with that on a frisee salad, they also added pomegranate, didn't care too much because we werent really able to pick them up with a fork and didn't think it added much, the vinaigrette was pretty light, it would be better with a little more acidity and seasoning, but overall it was nice. Our first entree we chose was the swordfish that accompanied with sweet sauteed peppers, artichokes, potatoes and basil oil. The swordfish came with two pieces it was a bit funny because the bigger piece of the fish was on the dry side and the smaller piece was moist and delicious. The dish overall was a great dish that all the flavors really came together with the sweet peppers, artichoke is another great fresh ingredients that is delicious. What i would of expected after eating the dish is to ask why not choose ingredients that is more seasonal? although it was a good dish but peppers and artichokes are ingredients anyone can get year round, as their concept is farms to table which means the farmers can provide the best of what is in season such as winter squashes or also brussel sprouts, but thats just my opinion, and I can understand that this is not my kitchen or menu. Our second entree we asked our server Monica which one she would recommend and she chose either the chicken or filet. We chose the chicken that came with mac and cheese with kale and asparagus. Chicken dish was very comforting, chicken is chicken, ours came out moist and tender with a crispy skin, but the mac and cheese with kale really make the dish, it was so comforting takes you back to childhood and it was perfect and also the kale was so good in it. Our server was extremely nice and charming, but there were times when we actually felt rushed, before we could be done with our dish there would be some other guy or girl coming over and say,"" are you guys done? can i take this now?"" the first time or second was ok but doing that 3 times is just kind of embarrassing, can we not enjoy our food? and company? instead of stuffing everything down quickly. i mean i guess i would understand if there was a long waiting, even though it would still be wrong, but there were empty tables around, so i think they are a bit too attentive and just let the guest enjoy the food and experience. Overall I believe we had a good dinner, it is nothing crazy just good fresh ingredients with a great comforting feel, entree took a little while, but I can understand because I do also work in the field. The price is reasonable, again this is fresh farms ingredient cant really beat that!....I will like to visit again, probably in a few weeks because we only tried a few items, their menu consists of more favorites and pizzas, but I am excited to try their chicken sandwich for lunch, because i heard so much about it and i love anything fried chicken!",dlvoYrfz5p87vtZDsSV0kQ,0,0,3,XMqAEdJ0jMARm5kUYUck0A

The staff here seem to look down their noses at diners which is comical as this restaurant is located in a strip mall and its interior looks like a barn.  The food many on this site seem to like was overpriced and less than spectacular.  I have been there for dinner and brunch, and was disappointed by the fare and service both times. The turkey meatballs, which are touted as one of their specialties,  were tasteless and hard. The pizza dough was also hard and the toppings lacked any depth of flavor.  For brunch I ordered the  hash which was hands down the  absolute worst hash I ever had the misfortune to eat.  The cook must have known it was horrible as he tried to compensate by dousing  it with an enormous amount of salt.  One could get better tasting food at the  Cheesecake Factory  right across the street  at Boca Park without the snooty attitude and for far less money.",YVAJ4Xddij0Y2Nl48fDdFg,2,1,1,wBgb-6fj2Iyq7cV5CN4Vew
828577,2012-12-24,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I think 30% of the people rating this restaurant don't understand how to use Yelp, or for that matter the internet in general. No one cares that one time you thought about going there but changed your mind because you are insecure and felt like the hostess was judging you and gave you the stink eye, or whatever other nonsense you've just made up in your head. That's not how this works fools!!! 
Sorry but this is not a one or two star restaurant! Don't get me wrong, this is not Joel Robuchon or Guy Savoy. What it is, is a great neighborhood restaurant that offers an elevated dining experience in an area that is desperate for something better than another Chili's or Olive Garden.  I understand for a lot of people this is considered a pricier restaurant, it is definitely comparable to ""Strip prices,"" so I can understand that it may not be for everyone. Being someone who eats on the Strip almost everyday, I don't mind paying the slightly higher price to be in my own neighborhood and eating something comforting and delicious. 
I've had a really positive experience on all 3 of my visits. Through, a bit more expensive, I prefer the dinner menu over lunch. On my last visit I had the mac and cheese, which was so delicious; it has a slight spice from the green chiles and the kale provides a nice break from a sea of cheese. We shared the scallops which are similar to my favorite preparation Kim Canteenwalla used at Society; served w vanilla scented cauliflower puree (ask for extra puree!) The burrata salad was good, but needed some salt. The chicken sandwich is great, very moist, and perfectly breaded, I wish they didn't use honey mustard as it really overpowers the flavor of the chicken, but should've made their own sauce to complement it. The bread pudding is a must, but do it with the salted caramel ice cream!! The apple pie can be skipped, its a miss; heavy crust, boring flavor. 
Overall, this is a great gem. I would say its a solid 4 stars, but I had to up my rating to make up for all of the silliness on here!",vA-q5dCmK75Ox5YkU9ADRA,7,2,5,X3mQqxyMrUXTz8ZBOGRcOw

A busboy tried to pour a refill on the coffee and reached across our guests and splashed everywhere. Pretty untrained. The decor is a strange mix of upscale and fake antique-ey. Doesn't work.

Also, two casual suit guys who appeared to be the owners were hovering near the pass, drnking their drinks and playing with their phones. (Counting customers to estimate their take?) Looked bad. Slow food too. TVs in the bar really ruined the feel, as the bar is at one end of the dining room and wide open to the diners.

manager apologized and tried to make up for it with desserts. just want to warn vegetarians and vegans for the future.
 
In response to Daniel: 

ONCE AGAIN, I CLEARLY STATED TO MY SERVER: I want the chicken on the side. I am a vegetarian. and I do not want the chicken to even touch my salad. those were my exact words. ALSO, it was not one piece of chicken. I found 3 pieces in the salad. after taking a few bites, so who knows if I accidentally ate some.

and I didn't allow your mistake to ruin my entire dining experience. however, putting meat in a vegetarians dish (when CLEARLY stated multiple ways) to me, equals putting coconut in someone's dish who says they are allergic to coconut.

- Magic Hat Beer: we were excited to see this Vermont beer on the menu. Nice job.

- One of the steaks that came with spinach....this was my husband's order, and he loved it.
- Scallops: ok, here's where it got weird. I love scallops and cauliflower, but for some reason this dish didn't work for me because it made me immediately feel nauseous.  I kept eating thinking it was my imagination, but no.  The sick feeling just got worse with each bite I ate, so I didn't finish my plate.  My husband tried it and said something wasn't right either.  The scallops seemed fresh and cooked well, so maybe it was just the combo of having had drinks, then mac and cheese and then scallops with the puree.  Too much in one go?

We were started with bread and in place of butter was white bean puree with pink peppercorn. Awesome! I had to ask what it was because I just couldn't place it. I'm not often fond of the texture of beans, but this was luxurious. The pink peppercorn added a bit of fruitiness and subtle heat. I couldn't get enough.

We shared a Caesar salad ($9). It was crisp, lightly dressed and delicious. Frank had the filet ($32) with potato bacon hash and I had scallops ($28) served on a bed of cauliflower puree and drizzled with truffle sauce, and we shared sides of kale and anaheim pepper mac & cheese ($7) and brussel sprouts ($7). 

Outstanding! Everything is so fresh and rather simple... the ingredients just shine. We pressed our luck and tried the apple pie ($9) for dessert. That, too, was scrumptious.

1012078,2016-07-03,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"The husband and I were really excited to try out this place after hearing so many positive reviews from our friends & reading them here on Yelp. Sadly, there were several things that left us feeling pretty disappointed. 

The good: Their ambiance and decor is pretty cool. It kind of has a modern vintage vibe. It looks & feels like a foodie restaurant for sure. 

Our server was extremely attentive & patient with us while we figured out what to order. (We had 2 servers, a girl & a guy. The guy was especially attentive.)

The disappointing: When we arrived, the server offered us water. Great, except that it was luke warm and tasted kind of gross. We had to ask for ice. It was just strange to me that they wouldn't offer chilled water or at the very least have glasses with ice. And she only filled up my glass halfway. At least she did leave the bottle at our table.

The server didn't bring out the bread (more like cheese cracker things?) until after we had ordered, despite asking about 10 minutes before we ordered if we wanted her to bring it out. And she wasn't even the one who took our order. I was a little confused why it took so long. 

We ordered the hummus to share, and honestly, I was pretty disappointed. I love hummus (and I'm not even that picky about it!) It was fine, but not anything special. And some of the pieces of pita bread tasted (and looked) burnt. 

I ordered the margherita pizza. Again, I was disappointed. I have had many different artisan pizzas and I wouldn't order it from here again. It just felt like nothing special. I will say I liked the tomato sauce (though my husband said that was his least favorite). 

Husband ordered the burger with the egg & bacon extras. I tried it. It was fine & he liked it, but again, nothing special. 

I didn't finish the pizza & the server offered a box. I didn't realize he was going to take it to the back. I'm honestly not a fan of restaurants boxing leftovers out of sight & I think they should consider changing that policy. What really weirded me out is that he dropped the check off, picked the check up, ran my card and brought the final check back. And then about 5 minutes AFTER that, he brought my leftovers back. Yeah, I'm not going to eat that now  Do I think they likely messed with it? Probably not. But why in the world would they take 10+ minutes to box up my leftovers? 

Honestly, so many of these things would have been forgivable if we had an awesome experience or if there were not so many disappointments. But everything combined together just made the experience unenjoyable (And I actually didn't even write out all of them). Frankly, I was really surprised because it just seems like it'd be an awesome artisan restaurant! Maybe we just got a lackluster menu (I know their menu rotates). Maybe we went on a bad day. Who knows. But I doubt we'll be back. Bummer. $50 for an only okay experience is just not worth it to us. Especially since we only ordered the from (less expensive) lunch menu.",hN5gz8s11EXRuxkKG7q-Zw,1,1,2,mEWAclnl1GFYsvsSF6ceTw

My fiancé and I arrived here last Tuesday night. It was slow but that might've just been because we came on a Tuesday. We were slightly greeted by the hostesses. The main room had plenty of opened seats but we were seated around the corner by restrooms. We sat down and were given our menus from the grumpy hostess. We concluded that our casual attire was what got us banned from the man dining room. Note to self: wear a furry vest, lots of shiny jewlery and your biggest Louie bag. 

Our waiter was awesome. I felt bad that he had to come around the corner every time to check on us! Sorry man, we weren't up to par!! 

Now I've been here a few times and the food had always been so-so. I keep coming back because I'm always with someone that hasn't been here. I love Mac n cheese so I always get that because it's pretty hard for a place to mess Mac n cheese up! Playing it safe. My fiancé got the steak and I ordered the linguine and shrimp. My linguine was good, my only complaint was it was a little cold, but I survived. My fiancé enjoyed his steak however, he said he would've rather spent the money at another place where we could enjoy the vibe of the restaurant and not be embarrassed of ourselves.

1030894,2014-10-03,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt was my first experience of food in Vegas off the strip and I was surprised. A friend who is a dessert chef recommended this restaurant and agree it was a good find. 

As other yelpers indicate, it's basically in a small strip mall with a few major chain retail stores. Despite the odd location, it has a nice ambiance with outdoor and indoor seating at night. The inside of the restaurant is posh with a NY feel to it, quite dressed up, something that you'd find in a city not in the middle of a strip mall outside the strip. 

I was quite impressed with the food. While prices are high, the food was delicious, prepared well with good quality ingredients. I had the whole mediterranean fish which was seasoned well. Our table also shared the meat balls, and octopus as appetizers along with the cauliflower side. One thing that our table loved as the butter that came along with the bread basket which was addicting - a little salty and sweet at the same time. 

Service was a little hit and miss for me. While we did go on a Saturday night, the service at the beginning of the meal was attentive. However, as the night went on, over a two hour dinner, the service trailed off and it took awhile to get our check, dessert, and boxes for left overs. 

Overall, good place for food and would recommend to locals. As for tourists, it's far off the strip and there are a lot of other good places to eat that are closer and more convenient.",nWno55Yp3f9A9yMSGgBdnQ,2,0,4,s6oric3RusaTvxNWGkxBKA

Just get that. Zero complaints about that. Perfect cook, great bun, good slaw, good honey mustard I think it was. That sandwich makes everything alright in the world, if only for a moment.

1048486,2013-08-09,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"We went to Honey Salt the other night and had an only okay dinner, with some odd features.  

We did have a reservation and were seated pretty quickly, but unfortunately in the least desirable area of the restaurant, the long skinny portion next to the bar on teh way to the restrooms.  This is an unfortunate space to begin with, but it was particularly problematic because there was a large party of about 14 near us.  This seemed to cause our waiter a lot of anxiety, which was reflected, I felt, in the service we received.  

We ordered two mixed drinks to start, and then looked at the menu.  They have a four course prix fixe option, and we got that to share, plus an additional soup and salad.  Of the six items we ate, none were outstanding and several had some issues. 

The prix fixe comes with an amuse, a nice portion of gazpacho.  That was very solid and served in a demitasse type cup, for a nice presentation.  

The next course was the salad, which was described as a bing cherry/greens salad.  At the same time, my dining companion got the creamless corn soup, a regular menu item.  The soup was very good and was a nice portion size, and came piping hot.  It had a very nice corn taste and was seasonsed well.  The salad was a disappointment.  The roasted bing cherries were a very minor element, and the overall flavor and presentation was uninteresting.  The vinagerette was barely noticeable and the greens needed it for more flavoring. 

Our next courses were the special Alaskan Halibut, which came with ""potatos confit, red pepper sauce and a corn salsa"" and the mozarella tomato salad from the regular menu, with the chocolate.  The Halibut itself was great; cooked well and flavorful.  But the companion elements severly detracted.  First, the potatos were simply discs of cooked small potatos.  They had no flavor and more importantly, they were served cold.  So there were small chunks of cold, unseasonsed potatos undelrying the halibut, which simply didn't belong there. The salsa was also cold, which I could understand better, but would have benefitted from being at least room temperature. 

The mozarella and tomato salad was quite good; I think the chocolate is an interesting touch but I think it could be shaved or cut more finely, to allow a better distribution in the salad. 

Finally, the marscapone cheesecake in a jar from the prix fixe menu was very good and a nice finish. 

The other problem with the meal, in additon the uneven food, was the extremely rushed pacing.  Our server kept assuring us that our next course was ocming, while we were still finishing the previous course.  It wasn't clear if he was anxious because of the large table, or there were other issues, but the pacing was way way too quick.    We were done in about an hour, which included the cocktail portion....I don't think we will be back soon.",esaN8m_u5te-GZi2dAdD_Q,2,0,3,rr9HqAo2ln5y-hlw3012oA

1057571,2013-01-31,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt is a lovely restaurant in the Summerlin area.  I was drawn to the place because of its solid reviews and the attractiveness of the website. The site promised creative, delicious food in a homey atmosphere. They more than delivered on the food.

Our dinner was fresh and creatively prepared.  We started with the butternut squash gnocchi and ""My wife's Favorite Salad."" The gnocchi was flavorful and seasoned well, but the salad was a thing of beauty. It had a lightness to it that was offset but the duck confit and poached egg on top. I will be attempting imitate that salad in my own home. I could have ended the meal with those two items and been happy, but there was one more outstanding dish to come.

I ordered the caramelized scallops and Hubby ordered the grass-fed filet. I suggested he leave the steak to the steakhouse professionals, but he was (as he often is) in a steak kind of mood. I adored my dish. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the cauliflower puree was a perfect accompaniment to the dish.  Hubby did not love the steak, but I wouldn't hold that against the place. He stated that the meat was high quality, but didn't like the preparation (steak sauce with salsa). 

In general I noticed a liberal use of pepper and different salts in most dishes. They are all about living up to that name. I really liked that element. 

For dessert we shared some salted caramel chunk ice cream. It was complex and rich. After a few bites we had had enough. But I am so glad we ordered it.

ATMOSPHERE:
If the review sounds less than totally enthusiastic, it is. Even though I had a fantastic meal, I only plan to return with others. At their request. Because I could not convince them to go someplace else. 

Why? I did not like the atmosphere in Honey Salt. The website promised ""homey"", ""eclectic"", ""warm"", and ""comfortable."" I found the space to be anything but. It was ""eclectic"" in its décor, but certainly not in its clientele. 

We went for Friday night dinner and were surrounded by a pretentious crowd. And there is nothing wrong with the ""ever-so-fabulous"" set. They keep the doors open and lights on I am sure. But I was not expecting that when I walked in. And a room filled with polished, peacocking, fabulous people is the antithesis of warm. For me. 

Even the décor and service was very...considered. There was little authentic warmth except from the bussers who were very attentive indeed. 

As a result I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have liked.  But I don't blame Honey Salt---""faux comfort chic"" is just not my thing. But judging from the crowd/lines/buzz, it suits other people just fine.

OVERALL: 
People really should try this place.  Honey Salt might not deliver on the atmosphere, but you will absolutely not be disappointed in their food.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,6,5,4,IkCSwEJiXU9yIdWjYmJ8HQ

The dessert menu was a little disappointing.  I enjoyed the McConnell's ice cream very much, but none of the other offerings were too tempting.  My friend let me try her Triple Layer Cake which looked very homemade (not meant as a big compliment) and was just OK.

We were sat immediately at a great table,  the host was nice,  so that started off well! 

Bloody mary's were tabasco on ice, horrible flavor.

We had the monkey bread which sounded amaZing on paper,  tasted like store bought 3 day old bread with some good caramel sauce.


I asked how the corned beef and hash was,  the response was ""its good but if you dont like it,  we can get you something else"".  Not a very convincing statement about their food. I ordered it anyway as I figured they would do a good job on a dish like this.  After the 29 minute wait to get our food, 1 look at the dish and I knew it was not done correctly.  The eggs were cooked basically all the way through to being hard boiled,  the vegetables were not cooked at all,  the carrots literally crunched still.  The corned beef was mediocre but still quite dry.  It was truly unfortunate and disappointing.

It wasn't until we had been sitting for a long while, the rest of the table was completely done,  that the server finally stopped by to say ""you didn't like it?""  As I had a whole plate of food still sitting in front of me.  She did take it off the bill and I ended up just eating the remains of my sons kid chicken fingers.  Not the experience you want for your wife's birthday brunch.

Quite frankly,  no reason to be back.  Long wait for food,  food simply not good,  seemed very understaffed and the manager seemed quite disengaged (maybe its his first day).

1126424,2014-05-18,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"NEW ENGLAND FRY ----- I am a huge fried calamari fan, so of course after seeing pictures of the ""New England Fry"" all over Yelp's Honey Salt page, I had to try it for myself. It came with fried calamari, fried clams, shishito peppers, and cured lemon aioli sauce on the side. My Bf and I came with 4 other people, so it was slightly embarrassing when I was the only one who ordered an appetizer (meant to be shared with the table) then smoked the fried calamari dish on my own in under two minutes.... just kidding, I would do it again with no shame. DEFINITELY recommend trying this if you are a calamari fan like I am. 

MY WIFE'S FAVORITE SALAD (duck confit, arugula, frisée, pine nuts, pomegranate, sunny-side-up egg) -----  it's not a large entree salad, so you won't be completely full if you order it alone, but would be good after sharing an appetizer. Duck tastes great and don't let the egg throw you off... I usually don't like sunny side up kind of eggs, but it is really good!

CARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS (charred cauliflower, vanilla bean cauliflower puree, truffle sauce)----- for the price, I don't think this was worth it, but I really liked the dish overall-- great flavor and texture. The scallops were very small and I'm pretty sure I finished the entire thing in five minutes while everyone at my table was still taking their time with their food. 

My Bf had the curry and he was not impressed. That's probably because curry isn't really an American food so you can't really expect it to be as amazing as the curry you'd find at more ethnic restaurants. My friend & her husband also split the fried chicken which I have heard was really good from multiple people. I wanted to try it but since I was already ordering the scallops, I didn't want to be THAT fat girl. BUT the next time I go, I will be ordering the fried chicken for sure!

I am not really a huge fan of American food, but I would come back here for sure if I am in the area. (I also find it hilarious that this restaurant is located in whitest shopping center ever: Ann Taylor, Gap, Pottery Barn, PF Changs... hah!)

Nice looking space - not a big fan of all the mirrors on the one wall but wtf do i know about restaurant design.  I dig the openness to the kitchen.

Felt a little out of place since we were in our post- work out gym clothes.  We got the sense this place is the go to lunch spot for  women shopping nearby or after having their hair and nails done.  

We shared the turkey meatball pizza ($14 ) as an app.  Meatballs were very tender, nice crust - slight crunch followed by pillow center.  Overall, very tasty.

gf went with the fried chicken sandwich.  I choose the burger.  The FC sammie came with a salad - very fresh, crunchy veggies.  The fried chicken was tender with   mustard-y cole slaw.  Could've used a little more seasoning but overall well prepared.  ( i believe $15)

The burger also needed more salt otherwise it was PERFECT.  Juicy, juicy, juicy - great flavor.  We agreed to was a better burger than the Barrymore.  Fries decent especially since they provided a side of the tomato jam for dipping. again I believe it was $15 ) 

We finished with the bread pudding ( with a carmel/toffee sauce ) - excellent ( $9) and the baked alaskan ( $10) - sadly a miss.  the Meringue was great, the cake, very dry/stale, the ice cream - very good when eaten on it's own.

Definitely worth trying again for dinner or brunch.

The chicken was flavorful and moist when bitten into, though was not as crispy as it appeared. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict was creamy and light, matching the vegetarian benedict well. But in my opinion, the benedict would have been better if some sort of meat accompanied it, such as ham or thinly sliced beef.

Over time I have sat in Honey Salt over a meal and discussed everything from love, travel and where life takes us with some huge laughs for good measure.

Never a dull meal here really and the service is great. New Modern American cuisine has been on the rise the past few years and I do have to say Las Vegas has a great share of restaurants that serve such fare. I have been to several New Modern American restaurants that I just wanted to say out loud ""Try again. Next."" So it is great to find one that serves wonderful updated versions of food we all grew up on. 

A few of my favorites over time have been the Turkey Meatballs, the flat breads, 
Mac and Cheese, S & P fries, scallops, Scottish salmon, Brussel sprouts and Biloxi fried chicken sandwich. The cocktails are great and do the job! 

Happy Hour is one of the best times to go for great prices on food and cocktails. My friends and I sometimes go here and share plates which is totally acceptable to do! Sometimes you just want a try and this is a great place to try different things. Over time our palates change and It is about time that restaurants updated the food we grew up on.

Before figuring this out, however, we ordered a few appetizers that we couldn't cancel. We got the lump crab lettuce wraps and the meatball slider (with mozzarella instead of ricotta). The crab wraps were okay, but very salty. I probably wouldn't order again. The slider was a meatball slider. Nothing interesting or fancy. I could have done without both of these.

We also got some drinks off the happy hour menu. I tried the blood orange fizz and the mojito with the weirdly spelled name. Moscito? Both were good. My friend got the pomagranate margarita and liked hers as well. These are a good deal for the price.

I loved my chicken sandwich and scarfed it down in record time. My friend also enjoyed her burger with an added egg and bacon.

I've been reading about this place on yelp for a while now even before it opened. So last night while out drinking, I was trying to decide where to eat I thought it would be a good idea to try the new restaurant everyone was talking about.
The place is very nice, it has this charming feel to it decorated with antique mirrors  distressed antique chairs and waiters wearing plaid shirts giving it that casual family-friendly feeling. I can't wait to move in!
For comparative purposes I ordered the backyard favorite burger, being the most common item on the  menu (and cheapest 15.00 for dinner) and let me tell you. It was the best burger I've ever had! Even better than Buchi burger and I love Buchi burger.
The service was outstanding and smooth as if the place had been open for months. No need to wait for the restaurant to fix the common new restaurant problems, the place was in business the day they open! I can't wait to come back ( with my blood Alcohol level lower than .08) and try all the other items. I was told that the caramelized sea scallops are to die for, I will have to order that next time even though the price for that is about four gin and tonics.
All in all this is a wonderful new restaurant and I'm glad I tried it. Thank you yelp for guiding me to this great place!

There is attention to detail everywhere and it is pulled off with aplomb. After reading about this place and being welcomed upon first appearance, I was looking forward to the food. The grilled octopus app was outstanding (I am loving the increasing popularity of this wonderful dish) and only had my mouth watering for the main course. Unfortunately, that main course fell short of the lofty expectations. I had the curry chicken and my date had the salmon. Both were unimaginative and mediocre. (On a side note: It shocks me how many bland curry dishes are out there. It is such a powerful spice, yet there are oodles of pedestrian examples.)

She kept coming around to all the tables, talking to the patrons to make sure that everything was satisfactory.  We shared Edamame as an appetizer and had 2 different dishes for our main course, the chicken which was crunchy and juicy and served with mac and cheese ($20) and the curry dish with rice, both very flavorful.   We also had wine by the glass but it was enough for me.  Two very nice touches are the tasty bread and crackers and the complimentary warm molten chocolate cupcakes.  We had ordered the divine apple pie and ice cream and bread pudding as well. They even have hamburgers and fries for $15 as well as more expensive dishes.  The service was beyond excellent.  The only problem was that it was noisy and we had trouble talking to each other.

Last night was my BF's bday made the reservation a couple days earlier. Honestly i couldn't remember if I told them it was his bday or not so i called back shortly prior to our arrival.The first time i called the girl was very short, when i asked about doing a dessert but confirming no signing (we are not fans of ppl signing at restaurants) she was very quick to get off the phone. I figured maybe she was busy so i waited a bit and called back.The next guy who answered confirmed this would not be a problem & even asked for the spelling of his name. He was very friendly and when i asked to possibly pick the dessert to help save time etc. he again, very nicely, said not a prob then confirmed the dessert & confirmed it would be the man at the table to deliver it to.

Upon our arrival the hostess was friendly and quick to acknowledge us. Our waiter (i think his name was Casey) had a great personality. The noise level was quiet high & the music choices didn't seem to fit the style of the restaurant.

The food was good but not show stopping. We had the sea bass & salmon - both dishes had good flavor, nice presentation & were good portions for the price. 

After finishing our entree's the waiter asked about dessert - at this point i was a little worried. I stalled for well over 5 mins to hopefully give the waiter some time just in case ----- no deal. After declining he quickly brought the bill. I checked to see if maybe they pre-charged the dessert and were possibly going to bring it out shortly but no charge was there. So again i stalled, this time for at least 10 mins. But did they bring it --- Nope! No comment & well no dessert....

Not a nice ending to a bday dinner, but hey thats why there are many restaurants to choose from. So if you are planning a bday dinner with a lil surprise - this is not your place.",V08eVTVVTPzU29OU3Wm2jA,2,1,3,7gQhpf6i1yh0TKYS_s-isg

The folks sitting next to him could not take their eyes off of the weapon. The guy carried his son (about 2) around the dining room to make sure everyone saw the weapon.

I have dined here several times, the first time with some of the staff who work there as servers.  When I walked in for the first time I was immediately impressed by the look of the place and my excitement for tasting the menu escalated.  

On that particular visit I ordered the burger.  One of the people I was with suggested that I order the burger with a fried egg, so I took his advice.  It was so delicious!  I particularly liked the little ketchup squeeze bottle that they give you with the meal.  

For dessert our table enjoyed several different dishes including the apple pie in a brown bag and the salted caramel ice cream.  Everything was amazing!  

Since my first visit I have been back multiple times to try different menu items + to introduce the menu and little gem to other locals. 

My most impressive experience was on June 1st when I brought in 15 women (Women of LV) to taste Honey Salt for the first time.  It was my mother's birthday so we also celebrated there!  I knew my mom would love this place and be very impressed with the food.  

Every single person was very happy with their order and the table ordered several items including the grilled cheese, an ahi dish and several of the different salads.  No one complained about any of their dishes, and I was impressed with the delivery of the table's items.  No items were forgotten, and everyone received their meal so no one was sitting without food in front of them.  

I have also taken my daughter to this restaurant (8 years old) and she still talks about it.  She wasn't very impressed with the mac n cheese ""please"" but she really loved the edamame option for her side and the coloring place mat she received.  To me, that's a win that she enjoyed the healthy stuff more than the junk food.  LOL!

For dessert, I shared the bread pudding and salted carmel ice cream with my friend. Both were amazing!

Their octopus app was refined and balanced, very well constructed. First a base of a wonderful romesco sauce, some patatas bravas (tasted like roasted fingerling potatoes) resting on the sauce, topped with beautifully grilled octopus garnished with herbs, an oil drizzle, and a drops of a cream sauce all pull this dish together. I dare say it certainly gives the dish at Milos a run for its money. Their burger had a nice blend of meats in their custom grind, I ordered it with the fried egg of course. I enjoyed the burger, but it paled in comparison to both appetizers. The brown bag peach cobbler had a nice crumble and a good amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg which I found to very pleasing. Great service this meal from Andrew and a very good overall experience.

I returned to Honey Salt just 2 days later to have Sunday brunch with my sister, brother in law, and my young nephew who were visiting from LA. We ordered the blueberry pancakes with lemon curd, corned beef hash, and biloxi fried chicken sandwich which were all quickly devoured by the 3 of us. What a great meal! Some of the best pancakes in town! Perfectly cooked, fluffy and moist with ample blueberries. The lemon curd was a perfect complement to the blueberries. Not that it needs it, for I could easily finish all the pancakes with just the lemon curd alone...but a little drizzle of the maple syrup is a nice addition to this plate. The corned beef hash is very good as well. Toasted slices of crusty bread topped with finely diced pieces of corned beef and potatoes finished with a sunny side up egg waiting to be cut so the yolk can run. The biloxi fried chicken sandwich was one of the best HOT fried chicken sandwiches I've eaten (Bunk sandwiches in Portland has a remarkable COLD fried chicken sandwich). Again exceptional service, this time from Joanne who was very pleasant and helped us with our food selection and continually made sure we had everything we needed. 

Will definitely be coming back for brunch SOON!!! Hopefully for the truffled grilled cheese, crab benedict, and the caramelized banana and nutella french toast!",jGKMAlMNbgonyeZBdqMpEg,1,1,5,3V3JfUt2AU1rNUKxskg-Gg

Why does an upscale restaurant have a tv at the bar? Sorta confusing as to what type of restaurant it wants to be.

Decor is very inviting and makes you feel like your in the country. Our server was a bit out there and seemed like he was constantly distracted by other patrons. I ordered the summer drink ( forgot what it was called) but it was very delicious. My husband ordered the beet juice which was equally delicious. We shared the burrata heirloom tomato salad which was good, but lacked taste, possibly need to add some salt and pepper.  My husband had the burger and I had a quinoa fresh chicken salad. The burger was okay, tastes like a burger you make on the grill at home. The chicken salad lacked flavor. On the menu it said there was avocado and citrus vinaigrette. The avocado was there hidden under the chicken, which was pretty moist but the only citrus vinaigrette I tasted was the orange slice on top of the chicken. The presentation of each plate was nice and fit the style of the restaurant but the flavor did not match to it. Our bill came out to be $70 +tip. Pricey for lunch and the lack of flavor. I don't think I will come out here again, but it was worth a try. Also the bathroom decor was a bit off. The ladies room had hotel keys mounted on the wall and the male restroom I heard had baseball cards mounted on the wall. Kinda random and didn't go with the space inside the restaurant.

It definitely ruined our brunch. While our server was nice and friendly, I saw him probably two times in our entire meal.

The manager had to bring us boxes then we had to wait another 30 minutes till our server brought us our check and another 30 minutes until he took our check so that we could pay. We ended up setting a timer and we were there for an extra hour then we needed to be. We finished our food very quickly even though we received it very late and the lagging and lack of service really kind of made us both grumpy. I didn't like that no one was ever around for me to have a refill, I finished my soda before my food even came and I had to eat my entire meal without a beverage.

They know what to highlight since the first thing you see when you walk in is the table covered in delicious pastries. 

They're still working a few of the bugs out, but overall everything was good. The portions are small, which gives you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything on the menu. We had the Veggies and Hummus to start, as well as the Yellowtail Crudo. Both were really tasty and great for sharing. For dinner, we split the Whole Wheat Pizza which was delicious as well, topped with lots of veggies. Lastly, we ordered a side of the kale and pepper mac n' cheese. If I can make one recommendation...do not skip this, it's so so so good.

Most importantly, their cocktails and desserts are divine. Cocktails are strong, so pace yourself, which might be difficult when they taste so yummy.

1566536,2013-01-07,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"My mother's birthday was yesterday and my stepfather decided to take us out to a place that his friend from work recommended to him. Apparently it was supposed to be pretty good, and so, we became the judge(s) of that.

Walking in, it seemed to me that the place had a bit of a nice quirk to it. It felt a lot like coming in to someone else's house, but also, it felt like it had a small touch of upscale that matched the stores nearby like Ann Taylor and Banana Republic.

Before I could fully admire the interior design, however, I immediately felt out of place. The hostess was dressed as if though she came from her high school Prom, the guests were in suits and dresses, and even the servers were all cleaned up rather nicely. And seeing as I came in with jeans and a chunky sweater to brave through the cold, it felt a little odd just being there. But the staff were all courteous and friendly, and they didn't give us any weird looks or silent judgments just because we were underdressed.

All in all, though, the ambiance here seems to be a bit far from the same casual you would probably feel from an Applebee's or Chili's. But at the same time, aside from the attire, it's pretty easy to feel comfortable here. The lights are dimmed nicely so that it's not overbearingly bright but also not too dark so that you are still able to see, and the candle on the tables add a nice little touch. I also quite like how the kitchen is visible. Just something about being able to see food being made seems a bit more - how should I say - comforting for me.

But anyway, on to the food.

Backyard Favorite Burger -- I never got to try it, but according to my stepdad, it tastes very homemade - a rather fitting adjective for the place, I must say. He also mentions that it tastes very fresh and has a rather nice crunch to it, though I'm not sure if for the texture or for the flavor. Nonetheless, I trust his word on it.

12 Oz. Cedar River Farm NY Strip -- Mom and I ordered it to be cooked on a medium, and it tasted better than I expected. We don't eat much so we shared it. Comes with a bowl of creamed spinach and french fries, which I felt was a tad odd to go with a steak and it seemed as if though they were just there for me. The steak was fantastically done, however, and it was seasoned and prepared very nicely. It seems I don't regret changing the order from the Filet Mignon just for the sake of having more to share.

Warm Bread Pudding -- The three of us split this as a dessert to top off a rather delicious dinner. It was served nicely and warm (as the name states). The bread is laid over a delicious toffee sauce and is topped with salted whipped cream and honey. It was very satisfying, and not too sweet that I stop after two bites but definitely no ordinary bread pudding. I think this beats my mom's, actually. (Hah!)

One complaint I do have with this place is the volume of their music, considering how hard it was to have a conversation with my parents and communicate with our server.

Another is the fact that while our server was so friendly and attentive throughout our visit, he seemed a little forgetful, somehow. There were quite a few mistakes that I felt were odd to make. Such as giving my mom a Sprite instead of a Coke? He did end up forgetting our order for the Turkey Meatballs so we ended up canceling it which took another guy to tell him to do so. And also, he forgot that my stepdad doesn't like ketchup on his burger and that he ordered mayonnaise on the side. I'm sure it could be discussed and easily fixed, and we easily forgave him for the mess-ups because he was that nice.

Overall, however, we had a wonderful experience and we've already considered on what to try on our next visit. Definitely better than I thought.",IWQkdTTn9FslPeSiih2l2Q,2,0,4,Vdgs_GcZLZd-kUn-vKRvKA
1571018,2012-11-20,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I hope that my bad experience can be chalked up to a bad server. I ran into a good friend of mine that night on our way out and he was positive about it overall. If it hadn't been so expensive this would have been a 3-star, but for the price I expect more.

Let me start with the good! 

My fiancé and I had an appetizer of 'Paleta Iberico Ham', and it was delicious. Really delicious. I followed it up with the 'Scottish Salmon'. This came with a quinoa pilaf under the salmon, and the two together were really great. The fish was cooked excellently and the flavors of everything went great together. 

For dessert I had pumpkin cheesecake. It was fantastic. I hate pumpkin and this was fantastic. Really really good. My fiancé was given a 'Brown Bag Baked Apple Pie' complements of the house (more on that later) and declared after her first bite, ""Oh wow, this is frickin' DELICIOUS!""


The bad!

Our waiter wasn't good with English, which made communicating with him difficult. He was not very attentive and our drinks --just plain water --spent a good portion of time during our 2-hour dinner sitting empty. We also spent a good portion of time waiting for him, either to come and take our dinner order, deliver dessert menus, take the check, etc. This 2-hour dinner should have been 1:15 at most

As a side dish to my salmon I ordered French Fries. They were stale, and seemed to be the kind that came from a frozen bag and were heated in the microwave. Absolutely disappointed in the fries, especially since they cost a ridiculous $7.

The biggest problem we had on the night was the 'Grass-Fed Filet Mignon' which my fiancé ordered as her main entrée. The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked, and she clarified that she wanted it pink throughout but with no red (in most places this is medium, in a strange few it is medium-well). It was made VERY clear that she didn't want anything near rare. 

Rare is exactly what she got. She cut into it, and there was a ring of perfect rich deep pink about 1/8"" from the beautiful crust on the outside ... and the inside was completely raw. If you've ever heard of ordering steak ""black and blue"" or ""Pittsburg rare"" this would fit the bill exactly. That's way too underdone for her liking.

So the steak had to go back. When it was returned the inside was again not quite up to medium but she accepted it because she was hungry, and the steak had taken quite a long time to get back. By the time it had been heated and redelivered we had finished my entire salmon and waited a few minutes with no food at all. The second cooking made the steak pretty tough (especially for a filet mignon, even one cooked twice) but the flavor was definitely there.  I will be trying this filet again when we go back.

The last problem is a minor one: the house steak sauce that comes with the steak is super sweet. Way too sweet to go with this steak and bacon hash. It's completely out of place.


Let me close by saying that the steak definitely had potential. It was seasoned perfectly, came with a killer bacon hash, and had great flavor, but they need to figure out the difference between medium and rare. I can't say that it was a problem with communicating with the waiter or a problem with the kitchen but I'll find out next time. The fries were just bad, and there's no saving them. And the service definitely needs to be addressed. I'll be going back and updating the review accordingly.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,4,1,2,Xn_D-8vAeXDt8VcQXmco_Q

I came here on a random Monday night and the place was packed. Great vibe, good looking crowd (albiet of the older Summerlin-mom-looking type...Vegas peeps, you know what I mean). Our table wasn't quite ready so we started with drinks at the bar. The bartender was friendly and was definitely hustling because she was the lone bartender at a full bar. They have some yummy specialty cocktails. I had the mickey...2 actually :)

Our food order:

-tuna tartar
-iberico ham (comes as a plate with cheese and asparagus)
-turkey bolognese
-brick oven chicken

I was so full and couldn't contemplate dessert. My favorite bite was the turkey bolognese. Very hearty and the homemade noodles (farro pasta) were perfectly al dente. Note that they were out of the scallops and the chicken curry...at 8pm. So I don't know if those dishes are truly that popular or if their supply ordering was off.

1633074,2013-10-15,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I randomly stumbled across this off the strip restaurant when looking at places to try on an upcoming trip to Vegas (thanks to Yelp as usual!). It only took us about 15 minutes to get to and it was really nice to feel a bit more like I was enjoying a local pick and not a super touristy casino restaurant. The prices weren't cheap by any means, but for a treat on vacation and for good quality food and service it's worth the splurge for sure. I loved the shabby chic look of the restaurant and my favorite part about the place was the large butcher block out in front of the open kitchen that they would use to finish dishes before bringing them out to the table. It was fun to watch them add a drizzle of this or a dash of that as a finishing touch. The service was also great without being over the top.

I started the meal with a delicious citrus and strawberry cocktail. They also had a few beers and wine that sounded good as well. As for the food... everything on the menu sounded pretty good but I definitely had my eye on the Charred Octopus. The scallops or salmon would have been my typical choice but the chicken was enticing me because it came with their mac n cheese which sounded awesome. My fiance didn't want to split the Octopus as an appetizer so I ended up getting just that and the mac n cheese... no entree needed! It was still too much for me to finish. I loved loved loved the octopus. It was perfectly cooked.. not chewy at all and had a great charred flavor. The fingerling potatoes, avocado, romesco and aioli it was served with sounds like a lot but they complemented the octopus perfectly. I loved that I could make each bite unique by mixing and matching the accompaniments. The mac and cheese was super rich but well balanced with the addition of kale. I couldn't even finish half of it though which worked out since I munched on it later that night after coming back from some casinos. 

My fiance got the meatball pizza and it was great. I probably would have gotten a plain margarita pizza because the crust, sauce and cheese didn't really need much more but he said he liked the meatballs. His only complaint was the caramelized onions were a bit too sweet but since he ate the entire pizza after his large salad it didn't seem like a deal breaker to me. 

We were rushing to get to a show so we didn't make time for dessert but I did see a few steaming cups go by that intrigued me and after asking what it was I decided to finish dinner with a cup of their tea. They bring you hot water in a cute cup with your own individual mini honey bear and then bring you a box of Harney and Sons teas to choose from. The mint green tea was delicious with a touch of honey and was the perfect end to my meal. 

Dear Honey Salt owners, please open another restaurant in Tucson so I can enjoy that Octopus on a regular basis!",8eC6EOsLTmfVk_35t3ZQqg,0,1,5,P6S4oiUjMSOlIpR_mhKWxQ

Greeted up front and seated immediately in the back by the restrooms (Strike 1)..
Not sure if it was because we didn't look rich enough to be seated with the rest of the crowd.. Lol

(Strike 2, 3, 4) Our server was Casey... He deserved maybe 1 star to be nice... NO WHERE TO BE SEEN or get a hold of especially when were all the way in the back. Came to ""check up"" on us about 3 - 4 times for a total of 1 min each time. Saw him mingling and chit chatting with the other tables but no attention to us of course. I give him 1 star for knowledge of the menu and food.

We ordered -
New England Fry : fried calamari with fried clams, huge calamari (I prefer my pieces to be smaller), and fiancé pointed out that batter didn't adhere to well. No big deal but we've had better.
Garden Mule (cocktail) : strong, ginger drink, not a fan.
Sea Scallops : REALLY GOOD dish, scallops perfectly cooked, drizzled with truffle oil (my favorite!), served on a bed of cauliflower purée!
(Strike 5) Pork Chops : dry, bland, not worth $27!
For sides we had Grilled Asparagus and Mac N Cheese - with kale, not too cheesy, and went well with my scallops!
Kids Chicken Breast with side of Fries and Sundae ($19)- good but over priced to be considered a ""kid's meal"".
Desserts were a Brookie - brownie meets cookie topped with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream ; Brookie could have been more moist and warm, but the ice cream was delicious!

Service, seating, dry pork chop and prices killed the 30 min drive and experience to Honey Salt.

1694610,2017-09-19,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Been on a negative trend for reviewing lately, so I'm glad to be able to drop this 5'er for Honey Salt. What's the formula for a 5-star restaurant in Las Vegas that caters to locals? Read on and discover. 

Turns out, the formula's not rocket science. I've been three times now and can attest. 
First, a 5'er must know what it intends to be, and then be able to pull it off in a genuine, honest fashion. HS has been there, done that. 
Second, you must have: knowledgable and affable waitstaff that doesn't intrude, does pay attention even when you-the-customer are distracted as I was over a baseball game, is timely and demonstrates foresight to your needs, does the bill right the first time, doesn't make excuses, doesn't rush and doesn't lag. *manNod to Paul, good show*  Even the hostess was attentive to seated customers when she wasn't greeting people at the door. No one has tunnel vision in this place, nor are they territorial. Love it. Functioning like a Team. A-Team. 

Next, a 5'er must have comfortable, spacious interior that doesn't crowd customers on top of one another in a desperate attempt to seat more cashcows. I place a custom HS cloth napkin on my lap and am already happy. Ooo, marketing that works. Honey Salt has a high ceiling and cushy chairs and benches that are quality even for short folk. Our feet touch the ground, flat! They have dining room seating, bar seating, a private dining room, and outdoor seating. You have a view of the kitchen from almost every corner of the joint, giving you that scent and scene of fresh and personal. Knock down that fourth wall! (*thespian joke for the uninitiated)

On the element of freshness, the waitstaff, GM, and other proud employees will tell you all you need to know about the local farm-to-table they are able to promote here in this desert oasis. There's a hydroponics display at the entrance, an example of where they source much-if-not-all of their greens and herbs. Ask and they shall tell. No secrets, no mysteries. 

An enticing happy hour that will pull even the most closed-minded tourist off the Strip. Many/most drinks are half price. They are on a current trend of half-pricing select plates on Mondays, too. Get it while it's hot. 

Demographics of customers. I've seen it all here in my three visits--elders, middle-aged couples, young couples, singles (yours truly), and even mildly well-behaved tykes. Somehow, it all works. And I dislike tykes in casual upscale places!  But it works here, and again the waitstaff are a central reason for that being the case. There's a mood for everyone, as well, from the happy hour music and bar-TV selections (placed so as not to be distracting to diners) to the dimmed ambiance atmosphere of late evening that settles and comforts our high-strung Las Vegas-weary spirit.

Last but not least, to the food. Prior to this last visit, I've gone with a group or with another friend, so I've tasted just about everything. All has been stellar, no MEHs, not a one. The first visit was as a stop for a group mac&cheese tour. There were four that day, and the reason I came back was because HS won handily and is in the runoff for when our last tour concludes. 
And do you KNOW what 5'ers don't need? A blasé basket of boring bread and cold, hard butter when one sits down, or nothing at all. That display always strikes me as a casual, ""fk you for coming here, thanks!""  
So good on you, Honey Salt! I laugh at myself for being so taken by their complimentary start, but it's unique and oh so perfect: crisped parmesan lavash with their signature honey butter drizzled with olive oil. Light and incredible flavors to get your 'buds a'whirling. A+ from the get-go. 
A brief visit to the dessert table, there aren't many places that can tempt me to splurge, but every time here it has happened. From last visit's brown-bag apple cobbler whose named begged it to prove itself better than it sounded (WAY better, plain awesome), to today's strawberry shortcake which took a little extra time to prepare as they whipped up a fresh batch of cream. The dessert menu is another that rotates seasonally, so always be sure to come back for more. No tired old flourless chocolate cakes here, rest assured. 
And a final honorable mention to the drinks, in a department all their own. My wines, my beers, and a rotating offering of 'tender-inspired personalized cocktails, all have been just right to compliment anything you happen to order. There is care and precision at every turn, taste, and sip. 

I was so perfectly content slow-dining by myself today. Honey Salt is cozy, fluid, upscale yet casual, and diverse in plates and flavor. You will SUCCEED here, diners, I assure you.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,8,8,5,cRDxpwBbsaX2P687qk5yEw

We ordered the sweet potato soup which was amazing and piping hot! We also ordered the turkey meatballs but they came out cold in the center, they tasted alright though so we didn't bother to send them back, just wish they would've been hot.

For the main dish my boyfriend and I ordered an ahi tuna salad which was delicious! (But a very small portion size!) and the chicken curry, which was also a small portion size. The chicken curry was good except it was served with some sort of crunchy flatbread that wasn't complimenting to the dish. Also there were large chunks of bone in the curry which is to be expected, however it seemed like every other piece had a bone!

My boyfriend loved the cucumber mocktail, so much so he ordered two! 

Overall, this place is decent for the price, however your experience can go widely different directions based on you order. Or you can do as we did and order a couple things to share just in case some dishes aren't up to par.

Honey Salt tries so hard to be cool and innovative but they fail miserably.

Menu - full of those pathetic dishes that feature a zillion ingredients and loose focus (and flavor)
Service - seriously amateurish and annoying
Wine list - generic and uninspiring
Atmosphere and decor - I guess this is their idea of cool but the husband and I agreed that this place could be anywhere in a past-its-prime area of Brooklyn and would blend in perfectly. Again, totally boring.

Honey Salt should be called Vanilla. That would be more appropriate.",buvchQ89fp29NlUUTiui-w,6,4,2,0_RNNigZhaXCVpFc0yXxLw
1765694,2016-04-24,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,I really enjoyed this restaurant. The Scottish Salmon was great. Also I honestly love the pre-meal bread and butter they bring out. It is an awesome combination of salty and sweet. The broccolini was also good.

The owners (or at least the interior designers) must've had some social media obsessed teenage daughters because everything in here is so aesthetically pleasing and instagrammable--even the exterior of the restaurant!!! IT IS SO CUTEEEE. 

My friends and I were having way too much fun taking pictures for yelp than looking at the menu. Waitress came back a lot to ask if we were ready, which I guess is a lot better than being ignored. We got the half carafe of sangria. You had the option of red or white wine but the waitress recommended red, so we went with that! The carafe was about 5 glasses of sangria, so it's a lot more cost efficient than ordering a single glass of sangria by itself. The sangria is served in wine glasses, which i thought was kind of weird since there was a huge straw sticking out of it. But still, it was very tasty. The sangria was very sweet. I liked it!!

I ordered the eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was very tasty and rich. The English muffin was buttery and perfectly crispy. All in all, one of the best benedicts I've had in my lifetime. I also got a bite of my friends' foods. My friends ordered the fried chicken sandwich and the breakfast pizza. The fried chicken wasn't super crispy. It was slightly sweet which I didn't mind. The sandwich also came with a Caesar salad; I think the dressing also had some lemon in it because it was very bright. I liked it. The breakfast pizza was cheesy and eggy goodness. The crust of the pizza was crunchy and was a good contrast to the creaminess of the cheese/eggs. I would order the breakfast pizza again.

All in all, I had a great time at honey salt. I can't wait to come back for their happy hour.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,5,4,5,5v4DE1UqEpL19HqB3z_5HA
1781306,2014-12-28,8,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Ode to a Biloxi Chicken Sandwich-

To those who compare your greatness to ""Chikfila on Crack"", I thumb my nose. Your crispy exterior is the perfect texture, the pure definition of fried chicken. Your moist interior is most complemented by your buttered bun, crisp pickles, and expertly-seasoned coleslaw. I, not a fan of coleslaw, delight in the acidity and brightness it brings to your fatty-delicious flavors.

And oh!, the house Durkees dressing: so reminiscent of a honey-mustard sauce!, the sauce that makes this sandwich so much more than a sandwich! Coupled with this sauce, you, dear sandwich, have that certain je ne sais quoi that makes me keep coming back for you over and over again, despite the pleas of other appealing menu items.

Alongside you is Elizabeth's Caesar salad, a disconcertingly simple combination of crisp kale Romaine lettuce, shaved parmesan, and another delicious sauce concoction: black garlic dressing. Oh, were I a rich man, I would pay quite handsomely for your recipe. 

Perhaps someday, an evil soul with a genius culinary mind will combine your flavors of crispy-juicy chicken and pungent, flavorful garlic sauce, to create another savory sandwich. Until that day, however, I remain true to you, beloved Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,4,3OK9QzhQhtE6r317L5-wRA

1797840,2013-01-12,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"So close to the five stars...  But just slightly lacking on the service side.  It was a Friday night and this place was PACKED!!!  Crazy busy.   We had an 8:00 reservation for five.  We all came early thinking we would meet for a drink but it was way too busy so we went across the street to Martini.  At 7:58 we rushed over to meet our reservation, EXCEPT they weren't ready for us....  Until nearly 8:30.  Sadly we left half full drinks that we could have finished if they had chosen to use the phone number they had solicited when we made the reservation.  
Initially they sat us at a four top with three (not petite) gals jammed in on the sette.  They realized this and moved us to a six top, much better situation.  They also immediately poured us sparkling wine to thank us for our wait.   We received two or three glasses a piece which was needed because our server was not ready to have a table sat.  We waited about 15 minutes to order wine and he was not ready to take our appetizer orders at this point.  We finally ordered our meals at 9:15.  
Now the food - 
Appetizers - 
yellow tail - amazing!!!!
Iberico ham - the combination of flavors on this plate are surprising and fulfilling
new england fry - although fabulous pales in comparison to the others above.
Entrees -
Scallops (three of us had these) perfectly seared, cauliflower puree so yummy with the buttery flavor of the scallops.
Scottish Salmon - a bit on the salty side but flavorful, fresh and just plain yummy
BURRATA, ROSSO BRUNO & TEARDROP TOMATOES - delicious and fresh
Sides -
Brussel Sprouts - My personal favorite.  A bit heavy on the bacon, in fact more bacon than brussel sprouns which saddened me because they were so good.
mac and Cheese - Plain and simply delicious
Roasted cauliflower - Fresh, great combo of flavors
Spinach - good but for me a bit on the salty side
Dessert
We all shared the bread pudding and the salted caramel ice cream..  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.

1813721,2013-11-12,5,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I was meeting up with a friend, who raved about this place both times that she had been here. I had also seen decent reviews, so I was excited to finally try Honey Salt.. However, I am beyond disappointed. 

With the help of Yelp, earlier this morning, I made a reservation on the Yelp app for 1pm. I stated that there would be two adults, and one infant...and that a high chair was needed.

My friend got there before I did, and waited for our table. It was very busy. The hostess watched me struggle with my stroller, my daughter, and the door. She informed me that they don't allow strollers by the table....No duh, that's why I asked for a high chair with my reservation.... I parked the stroller in the corner by the bar, and met my friend at our table. 

She was the only one with a water. The waiter didn't bother bringing water for the table. I waited about ten minutes before our waiter asked me what I would like to drink. My friend ordered a pretty decent bloody mary, and I ordered a margarita....

My margarita came...in a martini glass? Honestly, it was one of the worst margarita's I have ever had. Of course, our waiter, Nick, was no where to be seen. About twenty minutes went by, and I felt compelled to do a complete 180 in my seat, to find him standing, and just kind of staring... He came over, took our order, and cleared the disgusting margarita.

We ordered the Turkey meatballs (10) to share, I had the burger (topped with an egg) $16, and my friend had the salmon (20).

Our waiter dropped off our food a little while later, and we didn't see him until after he cleared our plates...Meaning we were waiting for water. The meatballs were the best part for me...they should have an entree of those. The burger was just OK. overly salted ( I know your name is honey salt, but come on) and didn't have any flavor besides that. The french fries were good.

The french fries were good.....not really what I want to look back on and think about when our bill came to $70.....for lunch!

For dessert we ordered the pie in a bag, and opted for the salted caramel ice cream instead of the vanilla. The dessert was quite good. But like I said, french fries and good dessert really doesn't save from the blah food, and terrible service. 

The table next to us had a blonde waitress, who really seemed to care about the ladies next to us. She has around to them about 4 to 1 (ratio) of our waiter.

The check comes in a guest book, I felt free to let them know that the service was bad, and to look forward to my Yelp review.... Walking out, the hostess was gracious enough to stop texting on her iPhone to say good bye...

It's funny how their menu talks about ""getting comfortable"", when they really don't make you feel warm, welcome or comfortable.

I don't think I'll be back.",bhmJrMRVc2sbk8XP00ravw,24,5,1,37i1EmAHkheiy-R24QzEvw

Beer and wine selection is great. I love IPAs, and they had several in bottles, so I got to try a new one. 

I tried the Roast Chicken. My date went for the special that night, which was Halibut. They were both absolutely fantastic, though we both slightly preferred the chicken. We tried the bread pudding and ice cream for dessert.....also amazing. 

The service was just the right amount of attention.

1876829,2014-06-17,22,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"From acclaimed Michelin star steakhouses to the trendiest gastropubs, from AYCE buffets to authentic Asian food, Vegas has a ton of restaurants. 

Unfortunately, almost all of these restaurants are not dog-friendly. I even heard that you can't walk dogs on the Strip because they wanted to keep the peddlers and their dogs off Las Vegas Boulevard. 

Therefore, trying to find a dog-friendly restaurant will require you to leave the Strip and head over to the more residential areas of Vegas. Perusing the Yelp app, that is how the wife and I stumbled upon Honey Salt, a glorious restaurant in the Summerlin part of northwest Las Vegas that feels like Palm Springs, CA... complete with wealthy white people and golf courses.

Like morons, we decided to do a late lunch with our four-legged son, Charlie, in the hot desert that encompasses Las Vegas. Blame our stupidity or the fact that we are so used to taking him around with us everywhere in Southern California that we did not realize how fucking hot it gets in Las Vegas. That is why when we arrived at Honey Salt, their spacious patio was empty. However, almost immediately, one of their workers, Mauro, came out and set up a patio umbrella for us to shade us from the hot desert sun. I'm sure he was thinking, stupid tourists! 

As we were waiting for the umbrella to be set up, our mindful server, Louis, brought out a bowl of water filled with ice cubes for Charlie! He even brought out two glasses and a pitcher of ice water for the dumb humans! First impressions go a long way and we were definitely impressed. 

We ended up ordering two of the ""Family Favorites"" off their lunch menu. The Mary's Free Range Chicken ($15) and the Ahi Tuna Salad ($17). 

The Mary's Free Range Chicken is served with red and white quinoa, beluga lentils, shaved fennel, radish, avocado chunks, and a citrus vinaigrette. While the chicken was very good, the grains definitely stole the show. This hearty conception was delicious and the citrus vinaigrette made it really refreshing. True to their name the citrus vinaigrette provided the ""honey"" and the grains provided the ""salt"".

The Ahi Tuna Salad was equally amazing. Yes, the wasabi pea and ginger crusted ahi tuna was great and the baby spinach with cream soy vinaigrette was delicious. However, the real star was the sea beans and julienned Asian pears salad mixed in what was a sesame kind of sauce. This single salad had both ""honey"" from the sweet Asian pears and ""salt"" from the sea beans. Freaking awesome.

All in all, the service and the fresh farm-to-table food was really impressive. It's definitely a hidden gem in the Las Vegas desert. Next time the family is in Vegas, we will wait for the sun to go down so that Mauro won't have to break a sweat for us.

* The complimentary Parmesan crisps served with honey butter were very addicting and they have an extensive beer selection.

* Honey Salt is located in the inconspicuous Rampart Commons shopping center with a Chico's, Gap, and Pottery Barn at the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston. If exiting the Rampart exit off the Summerlin Parkway, the shopping center will be on the right.

* Honey Salt must be doing something right because they will be opening up another restaurant in the Summerlin area!",j1981ubRRPjeRTx9UkMJ5g,27,24,5,LQB3hN1DcJEI5T3xWCtFpw

Our appetizers were terrible. The portions were extremely tiny, the tortellini was a weird lukewarm at best and cold on the inside. This.. fish salad didn't mesh well and had zero flavor. 

The main course - lobster risotto was bad. The risotto part was wayyyy over salted, I needed water after every bite (which our waiter kept forgetting to bring us). The lobster that was on top was so tiny and when we did have a bite of it lacked... All flavor. I'm from New England originally. That is not what lobster should taste like. 

The other main course was Rib Eye and is the only reason this is getting a star. Meat was cooked well and veggies were good. 

The two desserts were also lacking any flavor. The red velvet bread pudding, if it wasn't for the raspberry on top would have been like eating sponge air.

I bring some work clients and interviews to lunch there, and while I appreciate sandwich / salad / and limited entree options personally, some out-of-towners may want to graze on a steak or eat something heartier before catching a flight.

Nothing but the best wishes for this amazing restaurant.  I hope this is a sign of more to come for Vegas.",UUXpD55BsnpeXN6HKo-XUw,0,0,5,VdP7naGqlyLiULw4hugFKw

1910830,2014-01-12,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"This is a review for their Brunch Menu.

First thing is that the hostess, when I made my reservation and said, ""thank you,"" replied back, ""ok.""  I knew I was in for a trendy meal.

It reminds me of an LA or NYC brunch.  The service is very good, and the ambiance is very swanky and hip.  The food is reasonably priced, but it's not cheap.  It lost points on the fact that a side of two eggs (for my 1 year old daughter) was $5.  The kids' meals were $10+ in most cases.

Two of us got breakfast dishes, and two got lunch dishes.  The size is small to intermediate.  The taste is a solid 3-4 stars.  Overall the best description for Honey Salt, is... average.  It's so unremarkable that I had to use a thesaurus to find words for average.  (Moderate, mediocre, ordinary, common, regular if anyone needs a word for future reviews)",xtB67YuRwbbNFAuwbolqfg,2,0,3,hIr4a-fQnzijMVfjGjF7Hw
1913316,2014-03-11,6,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Pretty Meh.

I had heard all the hype about Honey Salt and it sounded really up my alley/perfect for me. I went last night for restaurant week and while it was a passable meal it certainly wasn't blow me away good. 

Service- this was great, no problems with it.

Bread- I was excited to get soft butter- I HATE when you get bread and the butter is frozen... but unfortunately the bread was super hard. REALLY hard. 

Turkey Meatballs- this appetizer was actually pretty good. You get 6 meat balls which is pretty beefy for an app. I liked the cold cheese that came with them and overall would rank this high.

Chicken/Mac and Cheese- Here is where the real trouble started. Presentation was a bit odd- the chicken comes on top of the mac and cheese and there is a brown sauce over everything making the mac and cheese a little watery. The chicken was a little overcooked for my taste- I am willing to gamble cook wise to make sure the chicken tastes moist and this chicken was very well done- you could see the stringy grain on the inside when you cut into it. The skin was crisp and delicious though. 

Desert- this was the low point for me. I got the apple pie and my roomate got the Brookie. The apple pie was sort of luke warm and a bit bland. The vanilla ice cream was very strong though and I appreciated that. The Brookie we thought was a big disappointment. It seems genius- combine a warm cookie sunday with a warm brownie sunday and on top of it salted caramel ice cream- this seems like heaven. But, the devil is in the details. The cookie/brownie wasn't really warm and the cookie being on top made it really hard to eat- as soon as you poked through the cookie (which took some effort) the whole thing sort of collapsed. The salted caramel ice cream is super strong tasting which i liked but my roomate did not. 

Overall I was disappointed but I will probably give them another chance. Sometimes restaurant week menus are not representative of the place and there were a lot of things on the regular menu that sounded good.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,7,5,3,wSAe2bjydYEg5QZ3s5SBFA

Yes yes it has a lot of good reviews

So what's wrong?

Well the Bang to Buck ratio is horribly tilted toward buck and not bang. I ordered the 14 dollar 'Grain Power' with free-ranged chicken and what came out didnt exactly rate up to 14 dollars. 

Was it good? You bet your sweet ass it was good! Some of the best tasting chicken i've had in a while. Tasted like it was raised, killed, then grilled with love instead of cold and faceless with the intent of making money.

So what's wrong? Well everything was just sooooooo and I actually left still kind of hungry but not hungry enough to shell out a few more bucks for something else.

Service could be improved as well. One would think when you write down the orders for a large table you make little notes of who got what right then and there instead of making everyone wait...lets be nice and round down, 10 to 15 (probably a lot longer) while you sort out the bills.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,13,8,3,6nlMUQuvgOT8WtAphX7WIg

1944238,2013-05-15,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I've dined at Honey Salt 4 times and have tried to love this place.  Really Really tried.  I live and shop in that area so its a convenient location with a beautiful decor.  I've dined at Honey Salt for lunch, after dinner drinks/dessert, and twice hit that strange part of the day between their lunch menu and their dinner menu.  Each time, the food I ordered was attractive in presentation, yet just average on taste.  However, it was consistently poor service I received that prompted this review.  

Upon arriving during my last and final trip to Honey Salt, my husband and I were again seated in the narrow dining area near the bathrooms despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty that afternoon.  I asked the hostess if it would be possible to sit in the main dining area (for once) in order to enjoy the sunlight that could be seen through the front entrance.  She told me no and her reason was that the staff ""needed to get ready for the dinner crowd.""  Now, first of all, I'm not sure what made the future dinner crowd more important than current customers in front of them, but I clearly saw several staff members leaning near the kitchen window visiting and laughing loudly.   They were at ease, enjoying the lull of the afternoon.  This was not a bustling rush to prepare for dinner.  This is the only restaurant in Las Vegas that has ever denied my rare request for a seat change. I wondered what trick the two-three persons that were actually seated in the area we requested performed for such prime seating?

We decided to move ourselves in order to an outside table under an umbrella.  We alerted the hostess to our decision and then waited for someone, anyone to take our drink order.  There were other diners on the outside patio as well but as their server assisted them, no mention was made to us about any impending attention.  We also noticed at this point how filthy the patio was.  Trash was piled up against the patio fence and although several servers came and went from this area, not one made any attempt to clean the area of any of the debris.  After some confusion regarding who should take our drink order, three staff members approached our table and took down our umbrella.  They said absolutely nothing to us but continued their own conversation while they worked.  We thought we were being pranked.  One of the staff members carrying the umbrella away, missed hitting my husband's head by centimeters yet made no apology or comment what so ever.  

I hope that these concerns don't sound petty; poor seating, abbreviated menu selections, dirty environment, rude staff...and perhaps each could be forgiven if the food was great- or even good.  But for just ""ok"", I'll take my business to the Triple George Grill, Marche Bacchus, or to Vintner Grill where I can get great food AND great service. I know the owners of Honey Salt have a successful history in this industry, and in Las Vegas in particular, so I regret the experience I've had at their restaurant, as I""m sure its not the experience they have worked so hard to create.  However, they have lost a valuable local customer and I have to encourage readers to avoid Honey Salt until some significant changes are made.",rUC_zcdiyfInBjZHTPVevg,1,0,2,JOCKnK5smBspBsfxzVU6bQ

Had a shrimp cocktail, roasted cauliflower and turkey meatballs.  Lots of food actually.  The shrimp cocktail had 4 nice sized pieces of shrimp.  They were plump and delicious.  The sauce was nice as well.  The turkey meatballs were amazing and the sauce delightful.  The cauliflower was really really good.  Lots of oil-moist and really tasty.  Forgot it was a vegetable.

It was too windy for us to sit outside so we enjoyed the great ambiance of the inside dinning area.  The service was above average but certainly not the best I've ever experienced.

In regards to the food, it was very good but certainly not anything close to what you pay for.  The owners have done an excellent job of marketing the restaurant and food using key buzz words and making food items sound very exquisite.  However, the $19 hamburger didn't taste any different than something I could get at a chain restaurant.  The best thing we could compare it to is an expensive Marie Calendar's or Mimi's Cafe.

Their menu changes seasonally, some of my other favorites are the fried chicken (and fried chicken sandwich) and the turkey bolognese.

My only complaint is, tonight we witnessed the hostess and another man (not sure if he was a manager, but he wasn't a server) arguing right in front of us. While this isn't acceptable at any restaurant, I'm sure the owners here would be especially horrified. It was a busy night and I can understand tensions are high, but save it for after closing.

I sat at the bar it was Sunday morning and place was busy but not crazy the bartender was very nice guy who recommended the french toast and the breakfast pizza. They have a full bar. The bartender spent some time talking to me about the history of the restaurant and  I asked about the menu and set up. The manager was walking around the whole time I was there making sure everything was going well and was even the one who brought my food out to me. The French toast which was made with brioche bread and had a cornflake crust on it with a strawberry sauce and fresh whip cream was the winner I would have drove 20 mins just for that ate every last bite. The breakfast pizza was good also but did not shine like the french toast. I will say though the eggs on the pizza were very creamy and prepared about perfect. The pizza was just a little more normal for a dish where the french toast was a really different take on french toast with multiple elements jammed together.

My coworker offered to take me here for dinner one night after work for my birthday. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Monday eve, they were not busy and we were seated right away. We were given bread to start that came with the most delicious salted honey butter. I could have eaten the butter with a spoon. Travis, our server, suggested to me the Biloxi buttermilk chicken sandwich. It comes with two fried chicken patties, coleslaw and a delicious honey mustard sauce. It also came with a caesar salad on the side. The sandwich was bomb. I put the housemade butter pickles on it, and I dont even like butter pickles, yet this little addition really made the sandwich come together. The salad that accompanied my sandwich was a little dry, but nothing a little extra dressing couldn't fix. My meal was washed down with a tangy, yet refreshing cup of pomegranate iced tea. 

Even though I was pretty full after dinner, I couldn't leave without dessert, after all it was my birthday. I decided on the bourbon bread pudding and it was really good.

2092961,2013-01-02,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I honestly believe that the best thing about this place is its decor.  As Misti had said, it has a country, old/rustic but refreshing feel to the interior, and the place is great for first dates.  Service was great- the chef is preparing food in front of the kitchen, so you can actually see him doing work.  It's a very nice touch, bringing diners close and engaging them in their beliefs and methodology of how they work the restaurant.

However.. (which is why they don't garner the extra stars), I don't believe the food is quite there yet.

I make it a habit of trying steak tartar at every place I go that offers it, and maybe I'm just used to steak tartar that's made in the traditional French way, but there was something off with the tartar.

My friends had scallops, which I think was the greatest thing they had going for them- they are huge, and very robust in flavor.. something that's difficult to accomplish with scallops.  I had the swordfish, and that was lame.  It takes a great deal of know-how to bring the flavor out of a fish, and it wasn't there with the swordfish.

The curry was also mediocre.

All in all, if you're looking to find traditional taste in your favorite, classic dishes, do NOT expect anything out of their food.  They have a much, much different take on their dishes and recipes than other restaurants (which really, is what they're going for).

I guess it just wasn't there for me.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,4,3,3,yH4PLmvun0Z0mEqM40WNtw

I don't remember what kind of bread  we had but the soft butter that probably had honey in it but I wasnt paying attention had olive oil and black lava sea salt. AMAZING!

Lunch is $20.14 for a three course for restaurant week. What an amazing deal right? I ordered the HS Market Salad and the Beehive Smoked Cheddar Grilled Cheese. They brought out the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich instead but it wasnt a big deal. I ate it and had no regrets. Everything was amazing, the portion of the food was perfect.

-Customer service was superb. 
-Food came out at a timely manner.
-Riki was our server and he really was nice and recommended a lot of our food choices for the night. 

CONS:
-The restaurant was really small so limited seats but we came at a good time so it wasn't a big issue. 
-Prices are kinda high for the portions. 
- Noticed that some of the items on pictures from previous diners weren't on the menu. They really took a lot off and the dinner menu was seriously lacking. My husband had to request for them to make the burgers. It wasn't on the menu.

Ordered 3 backyard burgers.
Husband and siblings liked the burgers but the fries were overly cooked. He also said that it tastes like Smashburger. 
Ordered 2 scallop ceviches, parents liked them a lot. I thought it was really salty. 
I ordered duck confit salad. It was very salty and it was also highly recommended from yelp reviewers but I don't really see the hype. Sorry guys.

In the end the group's conclusion was that the food was very nicely prepared but that the manager was the least favorable part of our visit. His apologies were patronizing and unconcerned. The problem seemed to extend to small groups, too, since there were others openly complaining about wait times. Needless to say, our conference attendance for the day was badly affected and our request for acknowledgement of mistakes was met with a combative manager who must be further trained on dealing with difficult situations. If I rated the food, the grilled cheese sandwich was excellent so I would say 4 stars. The wait staff was also 4 stars.

We had a reservation for 7pm and they did not have a table for us when we got there.  Their excuse was that they weren't expecting this many people.  For a popular restaurant they should know how to plan ahead.  We got seated at 7:30. 

It was really crowded and cramped.

A few food and drink items were sold out.

I got the chicken and it was overcooked and tasted burnt.   Also, the mac and cheese was submerged in au jus which just got it soggy. 

Easily too expensive for how much food we got.

The service was friendly but pretty slow.

I thought the atmosphere was very nice.  It is in a very nice area and it is very nicely decorated inside.

They did give us a free drink and dessert for waiting so long.

The pizza is pretty good but maybe I am spoiled by my favorite five fifty at Aria.  However the Caesar was really good and so was the bread pudding.  
2. Avocado toast was kind of like a healthy fat version of bruschetta.  Good if you like tomatoes and arugula.  

Service 
1. 5 stars all the way!  So helpful and the hostess was friendly which really sets the whole experience!

I have heard about Honey Salt for awhile but hadn't gotten a chance to go when I was asked my preference for a 2nd date location. Btw, this was the only good part of that date...

The place is nestled in the corner of a fairly nice shopping center with lots of parking. I instantly notice the great patio and take note that I'll be hitting that up when it gets just a touch warmer. Walking in it's a relaxing, eclectically decorated place with wooden tables, half booths, and nothing matching in a kitschy way. The bar is beautiful and there is an open kitchen in the back. 

I ordered the caramelized scallops and my date orders pork. I also got one of their sangrias, which I must say was fantastic. I'm pretty picky about Sangria after having enjoyed these fabulous ones at a restaurant I use to regular in Denver. I also make my own. They can't be cheap wine with splash of oj. They need to be solid sangria with brandy and spice. I was very pleased with their offering. 

The food came quickly and the service was outstanding. I wish I had gotten the girls name. I know she said it but I've forgotten now. She was fantastic. I luckily got a taste of my dates pork which was just as excellent as my scallops. Sadly date was in a hurry so there was no dessert but I definitely loved everything about it (place not date) and can't wait to go back.

I don't know why the hubs keeps wanting to come back here. In my head, Honey Salt is trying too hard to modernize/upgrade modern comfort food classics -- when there isn't much wrong with the the original in the first place. Sigh. Okay. Moving on.'

We've come back twice since our first visit.

We came for dinner once and lunch more recently. Dinner was a vast improvement compared to the horrible brunch last visit (see previous review) so we decided to hit it up during Restaurant week for lunch this week.

Going to this joint during lunch is pretty much another episode of the ""Housewives of Summerlin"". I swear one table of two probably had enough ""cosmetic enhancements"" that is worth more than a house. Yup - this is the atmosphere here.

We noticed though that they had this power lunch deal - $20 for a sandwich, soup/salad, fries and a choice of two desserts. My hubs reviewed their power lunch deal and was like great! That includes their Wagyu beef burger and he wanted to give it a shot. As it was listed under the sandwiches, you would assume that you'd pay the same power lunch price. BUYER BEWARE: 3 dollar surcharge on their burger option.  Which is bulls^&t because no where on the menu does it say that they charge $3 extra for the burger.

Whatever. On to the food.

I got the Caesar salad with kale, their version of a Cuban and fries with a raspberry sorbet. The Caesar was decidedly okay - it wasn't anything special - the dressing didn't have enough garlic/lemon punch to it. I also like a good anchovy kick and it just wasn't there. The Cubano was definitely lukewarm borderline cold. The thin layer of what looked like italian ham didn't offer enough salty porky goodness to offset the dry/flavorless roasted pork. There wasn't enough mustard, it definitely needed mayo and more pickles. The cheese wasn't really melted on to the sandwich either to get the gooey factor. Overall - a pass for me. The fries were okay - pretty much your standard fries from anywhere.

The hubby's hamburger was okay as far as he was able to say but the patty was definitely underseasoned.

The bread pudding was good. Nice caramelization and not overly sweet. The raspberry sorbet was nothing special though and I probably wouldn't recommend getting it again.

Overall, I think their food deserves a 3. Considering the prices they charge for the okay cuisine, this place is over priced by a long shot. Plus, the deceptive prices they have on their menu makes this place a 2 starred review. I really don't feel the need to go back here.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,10,5,2,9BmCCxko0R5XUd2KjWZ6lw

The first visit my girlfriend and I sat at the bar since all the tables were reserved. The bar had a unique beer selection and the service by the bartender was good. I had the cheeseburger which was very good, and my girlfriend had the mac and cheese, which by the way is some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Overall no complaints the first visit. 

The second wasn't so great when I brought my parents. When we first came in it seemed the hostess didn't know where to seat us as she was arguing with a server about it. Once we sat down, no server came to our table for quite some time. As I looked around for our server I could see several servers discussing amongst themselves, pointing to our table deciding who was supposed to serve us. As the servers were trying to sort it out, luckily a busser/food runner came by and took our drink orders. When another food runner came by for my mom to pick out a hot tea flavor out of the case, she asked what flavors they had as the restaurant is dimly lit and she forgot her glasses. The food runner was taken aback and began picking up each tea bag trying to figure out which one was which. I think we went through two bed baskets and multiple reassurances from the busser that our server was on her way before our order was taken. Lack of menu knowledge was apparent when even the server didn't know how some dishes were cooked when asked. I like the food at honey salt even if I think it's a bit overpriced.

2210921,2012-12-14,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"A wonderful addition to the Summerlin area and a great place to enjoy some trendy ambience in Boca Park.  My party enjoyed our evening from the moment we stepped in: the restaurant features an open-concept floor plan, allowing one to see and be seen, with plenty of dark wood and chic light fixtures that add contemporary decorative flair.  Our server was very friendly and obviously wanted us all to have a positive experience, stopping by several times to refill water glasses and to check that everything was to our liking.

Honey Salt states that they are ""committed to providing fresh and innovative food"" (website) and they do indeed follow through.  Our collective entrées included the Scottish salmon (served on a bed of quinoa pilaf, braised fennel, house-made peppadew chimichurri sauce; $25), the free range brick oven chicken (served with kale and anaheim pepper mac n' cheese; $22), and the caramelized sea scallops (served with charred cauliflower and vanilla bean cauliflower puree; $28).  All were delightful, fresh, and delicious.  I especially enjoyed my chimichurri sauce with my salmon, as the bright flavours complemented the delicacy of the fish.  My hubby's scallops were fantastic!  The chicken was not overcooked at all (whew!) and the mac 'n cheese was so yummy.  For dessert, we shared a warm bread pudding (with the most lovely bourbon toffee sauce) and a (huge) slice of the triple layer cake (2 layers of chocolate fudge cake, 1 layer of roasted banana cake all iced with brown sugar buttercream).  Good thing we shared....sort of.  So good!  

I don't have any complaints about the food as everything was excellent.  The ambience is trendy and slightly slanted towards youth, but anyone can come here and enjoy a terrific meal.  My only critique about the actual space is that it would have been nice to have a bit more, er, space between tables.  Because of this, at times I felt like I was in a cafeteria.  A very chic, expensive cafeteria, but still...!  Honey Salt is not an inexpensive place, but then again, you get what you pay for....and you get quality here.  

I am DEFINITELY coming back to check out the lunch menu....and to snag another piece of that triple layer cake!  Make sure to take a look at the salt and pepper shakers display at the front of the restaurant -- so cute!",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,2,0,4,ZbBDWvL_jl0XAn2x54_P_Q

Definitely a hidden gem in Las Vegas.  Downfall: so far away.  
Located in a corner of a shopping plaza by Boca Park.

Appetizer: Charred Octopus was delicious, but the grilled octopus at Milos in Cosmos was better
Entrée: Caramelized Sea Scallops and Colorado Lamb Porterhouse were both amazing.  However, I was not a fan of the sofrito in the lamb dish.  It looked like a salsa.  The acidity of the tomatoes didn't complement the lamb for me.  

It was a beautiful night so we decided to sit outside.  I was entertained by everything. Beautifully labeled ""honey salt"" - the beer glass, the plate, my napkin....  I was surrounded by fresh plants and gorgeous string lighting.

The food was good. Tried the grilled cheese sandwich and soup combo, both were super tasty and just the right size for a quick lunch. Went there specifically for their bread pudding which was very good. Nice and chewy and rum sauce was excellent.

The bad: I was not greeted when I arrived in the restaurant to meet my friend who was already sitting at a table. Our waiter was somewhat dismissive of us. I saw him attend to the table next to us various times before he even came by to ask if we needed anything or refilled my water. It was a little weird considering the atmosphere is very warm and inviting. Frankly, the service turned a four or five star experience into three. 

I did see the manager walking around and observing the tables. They definitely take pride in presentation which I appreciate, and the music was low enough to have a proper conversation.

There was zero wait on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, but it was still fairly busy.  I agree with others that the seating is a bit tight.  However, the decor is amazing and the fluffy pillows on the benches are so cute!

The bread basket had two tasty kinds to ""choose"" from (I put that in quotes since I ate them both).  I ordered the Biloxi Fried Chicken since it seemed to be the thing that everyone raved about most.  I was NOT disappointed.  Not sure if I can roll with the pickle thing though... the sandwich would have been just as good without them in my opinion.  I was in love with the sauce and slaw combo on the sandwich and felt that it really pulled it all together.  The chopped salad... no words.  I loved it.

Fiance opted for the Backyard Favorite Burger.  He said it was good, but really just like any other burger.  The fries were good (I know this is a fact, since I ate about half the basket myself).  He did agree that my meal was better than his.

Service is where the last star was lost.  While our server was very nice, he did let drinks run dry when they should not have been.  Other than that, Honey Salt is definitely worth returning to.

I was a little disappointed that the main course (chicken) was served on top of mac and cheese and then surrounded in a sauce that made the mac and cheese lose all sense of cheese-ness.  The chicken was a tiny bit dry but that was probably because it was a really really generous portion of meat.  The french fries were a tiny bit underdone, but I did arrive at an odd hour.  Food did take a bit of time to come out, probably again due to the odd hour.  Some items were a tiny bit pricey, but you are paying for a farm to table experience so that's how it usually goes.

2289841,2012-11-10,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"The evening started out pretty good.  The place was packed and we were quoted a 25 minute wait.  The bartender was nice and our wait was only ten minutes.  The place was packed in the middle of the week for dinner, so I guess this is the new hot spot in Summerlin.

After waiting a while, a server delivered some bread, some basic white rolls, but didn't really explain what it was served with. It took a few tastes to figure out but, I think, that the spread was some sort of bean dip.  Not really my thing.

We tried the New England Fry - calamari, Ipswich clams, and Shishito peppers.  It was ok.  The Caesar salad was amazing.  They also offered a kale option for the Caesar salad.  Not sure what that option was about - if they just added kale or substituted kale for lettuce.  It was really too noisy to get details.

I tried the chicken curry and it was mostly carrots.  A lot of carrots.  The raita that came with the dish was good, but once that ran out I stopped eating.

Service was odd.  Various servers kept pouring ice water into my club soda, which was annoying, especially since the house water does not taste good at all.  And my husband ordered a beer, in a bottle no less, before our entrees came.  But the beer did not arrive until after we finished our entrees.  It was comped but by then we were ready to bail.  It took a while to get a check.  Our server had tables scattered through the restaurant so our server was hard to catch.

They have outdoor seating but even though the weather was nice, the tables were set, and there was a wait, no one was seated out there.  It was the same type of outdoor seating Nora's had - a stunning view of the parking lot and Banana Republic.  Maybe the servers didn't want to bother with it?  So the jury is out on the outdoor seating option.  Frankly, I didn't notice until after we left or I would have asked about it.

My fault for coming to a restaurant within the first few weeks it is open.  I think I'll give it a few months and try again.  The chicken sandwich was not offered for dinner so I'll have to try lunch.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,5,1,3,bWvQJdT6fSR9mVk70FOlww

2323334,2014-08-19,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Went here for dinner based on the reviews and overall I found that the food was very good, but it is really overpriced.  I noticed numerous other reviews say the same about the prices.  One lady I saw said she did NOT think it was overpriced, and quoted that she paid $35 for 1 entrée and 1 appetizer at lunch.  You don't think $35 for a lunch with appetizer is overpriced?  Man, I wish I could live in that world.

The stuff we had was typical ""high end"" fare...exotic sounding ingredients in small, well presented portions.  For 2 people for dinner, we had 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 1 entrée, and 1 dessert...no wine/drinks of any sort and the bill was $100 flat including tax without tip.  The prices need to come down about 20% in my opinion, although I could live with 15%.  As it stands, we really enjoyed the food but it isn't the kind of place we will justify going back to any time soon.  I like great food and I have no issues spending big money on great food, but it is just too overpriced, even for an overpriced haute cuisine type place.

The grilled octopus appetizer was very good.  A nice char with a good blend of flavors from the romescu, potato and avocado, but at $16, it was about $4 too much.

The prawn appetizer was tasty, although they were overcooked.  Also, 4 large prawns in a flavored broth is a bit much at $15.  

The free range chicken breast entrée was very good as well.  It came with a little portion of their tasty mac and cheese, with chile and white cheese (cheddar I believe).  Cripsy on the outside and pretty juicy inside.  Very good, but again, at $23 for 1 large breast and some mac and cheese, it is about $4 too much.

My wife had a nice little peach salad, which was good, especially since peaches are in season.  It consisted of 1 peach, halved, then topped with some kind of cheese and nuts and some other items.  Not exactly a massive serving, and if I remember correctly it was $14 or $16.  1 peach...cut. in. half.  Come on.

The one thing that I felt was pretty fairly priced was the dessert.  I had a peach pie, which came with a nice scoop of ice cream, and it was a pretty decent sized serving, and for $9, it was pretty on point I felt.

Also, they have a delicious little bread basket which is on the house and they even refilled it, so obviously I appreciate that there are other house costs like the free bread that have to be covered, but at these prices you better eat a few baskets.  Not hard to do mind you, especially with the tasty little mix of butter, salt, honey and olive oil they provide.

Overall, the food was great and we had no issues with the service as some others have described.  However, at $100 pre tip with only house water to drink and $118 with tip for 2 people and only ONE entrée and 1 dessert, it was just WAY too much.  $85 pre tip would be acceptable, $75-80 would be better.  Would I return?  Sure...but not anytime soon and probably only on rare occasions.  For that kind of money, they are other places I enjoy and other places I want to try, so I just can't justify working into any kind of regular rotation.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,1,1,4,eigKhUsrgtglY3k6EGFQfg

We started off with an awesome server (thanks Adrian!) who was not only well versed in the details of the menu but also extremely thoughtful and fun to interact with.  Followed by craft cocktails, which were both great, you can't go wrong with half off at happy hour either.  The food was just as good, we shared both happy hour plates and dinner, all which were excellent.  Wrapping up the night was the best experience I've had with restaurant management since I've been in Vegas, Katie Strzelec worked out a complication we had using a gift card and could not have been more gracious or easy to work with.

2342344,2017-09-21,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"We were looking for a nice place to have lunch and a few drinks. Wanted somewhere with an outdoor patio.. decided to try Honey Salt. A bit of construction going on in parking lot and neighboring shops, but we didn't mind. Their our door seating on this sunny,  glorious Las Vegas afternoon was empty and we were worried they weren't seating outside because of construction. However, the very friendly hostess assured us we could sit
 outside and put the umbrella up for us.

Our waitress, Fatima, came out soon after and immediately got us some water. The service, food, and atmosphere was excellent! 

At the end of our dining experience, we asked a few questions about the history behind the place and the food, and while our server wasn't quite sure, she let us know she would find out. We were also asking why menu wasn't posted online, as the 3rd party site that shows a menu was outdated. All three of us had no problem choosing meals on the current menu, but still think a current available menu online should be offered...

We were soon greeted by one of the managers Katie, who gave us a bit more info and also left us with a few drink coupons for our next visit. We have no complaints about our experience at Honey Salt, just a suggestion o  posting current menu on your website... we brought a very picky eater and tried to do our research beforehand and what we thought she would like wasn't available. It turned out all great because she LOVED your tomato soup and grilled cheese. Thanks to all the staff for a lovely lunch at Honey Salt!

It was a little confusing at first, because the hostess showed us to our table and then another man brought our drinks and finally our server came over to help us. Good service, just more people than I am used to. 

Feeling underwhelmed by the choices and their prices, I had a small latte and the monkey bread ($9). My friend Sam had the frittata ($13 if I remember correctly) and a cup of regular coffee. The monkey bread was basically a jazzed-up Cinnabon with a boozy bourbon sauce...tasty but cloyingly sweet. The latte was just okay, with the espresso notes mostly getting lost in the milk. 

The vibe is strange in here because at first glance it appears to be a cute cafe, but there are connecting booths by the wall that make it feel more like a cafeteria. We sat an elbow's distance away from a group of people having a business meeting which was slightly uncomfortable. 

Maybe I'll have to come back to check out their dinner scene, but as far as brunch goes Honey Salt has pretty standard fare for an upscale price.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,5,3,3,t9JpZi3-y9P-H9CwixMebw

2373526,2014-03-04,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"We were just around the corner and yelp'd nearby restaurants and Honey Salt popped up!  I had actually heard about this place from a friend a few months ago, so we had to try it.  I was especially interested in trying the fried chicken sandwich, but silly me- it's not on the dinner menu!

Just a few notes:
-We were seated right away.  The first thing we noticed was that the restaurant's name is LITERALLY on everything, haha.  
-It's a little dim in the restaurant, in fact the older groups surrounding our table were actually using the flashlight apps on their phones to read the menu.  
-My boyfriend and I were wearing jeans and a t-shirt, which made us stick out like sore thumbs!  
-The chef was hanging out in the front the whole time and didn't greet any customers or walk up to any tables, including the special event that was going on.  This may seem nitpicky, but it seemed weird that he was just kinda doing nothing the whole time!
-Meal sizes are small.  Not a complaint, just an observation in case you're reading this and planning a dinner on a budget!
-There is a large seafood selection!

First, based on a recommendation from our server (very friendly), we ordered the grilled octopus ($16).  It was tender and had a nice char; the sauce underneath and the other components all fit pretty well together.  Unfortunately, the bus boy took our plate without asking if we were finished!

We shared the special ($30 for two 5oz. Lamb porter house steaks, cooked medium rare).  It was perfectly cooked and I swear I tasted some type of Indian/Mediterranean flavors in the jus.  Not a lot to savor, but we're supposed to be thinking quality over quantity!

Finally, we ordered two desserts- the brookie and bread pudding.  I love a good bread pudding that is moist and drenched in sauce.  This was not a great bread pudding and I was pretty disappointed!  It's a HUGE serving comparable to a rubix cube and SUPER dry.  There was not enough sauce and it wasn't gooey or sickeningly sweet like bread pudding is supposed to be!  The ""brookie"" is a chocolate chip cookie housed in a brownie with salted caramel icecream on top.  All components were good, but I'm not so sure either dessert was worth the $9.   ***FYI, 2 desserts is too much!***

I'm pretty sure he might have been the GM, and he was great. Not really sure what happened to our server, but he stepped in and took charge.

And this was to celebrate my husband's birthday, so I wanted to take him to a place I had been before and thought would be great.  So disappointed.  First, we received stale, hard dinner rolls. Last time they were fresh, crusty on the outside and light as air inside, but this time not so. The butter to go with the dinner rolls last time was filled to the top, you could see the honey and black salt, but this time it was half filled and hardly any salt and no visible honey. We ordered the fish fry; delicious. Next, we ordered our main dishes with a side of creamed corn. We got the main dishes, but not the side of corn. Our waitress never came over after the main dishes were served until 15-20 minutes later, our main dishes almost gone, to see if everything was ok, at which point we told her we never got the corn. Another 10 minutes later the corn arrived. I was already done with my meal when it arrived. Then we waited another 10-15 minutes after the table was cleared before our waitress came over to see if we wanted desert, and because we had a movie planned, we could not take a chance with her poor service to order dessert and get our bill, so we declined dessert, got our bill, paid, and as we were walking out a tall gentleman, who assumed was the manager or owner asked my husband how everything was, and my husband said, ""You don't want to know."" And apparently he didn't because he let us walk right out without asking us what the issue was.  Sorry to say this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and we will probably not be returning. And a closing note--this place was empty when we arrived at 6:30 p.m.  I would overlook poor service if the place was crowded and the waitress had a lot to tend to, but tonight that was the opposite.",OLMJAVCqKuoz3HRUhK8Cug,1,0,1,1jg0P3zcUxCbhmcg0BD0OA

I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night. Place was dead...(not a good sign)

Location is pretty bad - stuck in between a pottery barn and a boutique shop - outside doesn't look like much.

Inside - very chic and cute. They plate your food out in the open for all the tables to see which I thought was unique.

Staff was very friendly and management stopped by to check on us. Sadly, our waiter could care less about us. Never checked on us even though our table was right next to the stand where they plug in your orders. He gave off the worst vibe...killed our mood. We had to ask for the dessert menu and water from other waiters and staff!

The Food:
The food was actually pretty good. Small portions and high price for the amount of food - don't be fooled by the pictures. But the quality and flavor was really good. I must say, the presentation on all of these dishes were fantastic!

Tuna Tartar - So Good! Flavor was amazing and fresh!

Beet Salad - Great flavor and presentation

Steak Salad - Steak and great flavor...just not very much of it

Salmon (what they recommended) - could have been better - Salmon was overcooked - pass

Scallops - Slightly overcooked but the sauce was amazing! The flavor of this dish was excellent 

Blueberry Bread Pudding- needed to be served piping hot - not luke warm - pass

Apple Pie - needed crumble of some sort or nuts - it was ok

Brookie - Awesome! Especially with the salted caramel ice cream.

Order a bottle of Cabernet - didn't expect much but it wasn't good at all. (On the menu it was marked as $30 for the bottle, on my bill they hit me for $50...so beware!)

I've been to Honey Salt  a few times since they've opened. And when I say limiting, I try to stay away from bread, pasta, legumes.
Both times for lunch I had the steakhouse salad and absolutely loved it. For dinner, I've had the Filet Mignon and their Fried Chicken. With the Filet, I've ordered it once and then my next trip my husband ordered it. Both times it wasn't cooked to order, it seems cooking steaks might not be the cooks strong suit. We both eat our steak medium: mine came our barely cooked at all and my husbands was medium well. But the filets were good and grass-fed. 
The fried chicken was a special that night, and it was awesome! The only thing I didn't care for on that plate was the corn salsa - but I'm not a huge salsa fan. And the chicken is free-range. 
The best part about this place is the desert - the brookie is to die for! Don't order it alone though or you'll feel guilty for weeks. The brown bag pie is great, along with the salted caramel ice cream. mmmmm",utb6bhr1Fx7_Z5hZnPq_dQ,1,1,4,FY2fGNGGFJwFlpOOl7RoLg

The 2nd time was similar to our most recent disaster and we were hoping at the time that it was just an off night but it's obvious that it wasn't. My family came in from out of town and my wife and I took them here on the night of Sunday, April 23rd. We had a reservation and got seated immediately as the restaurant was mostly empty. The waitress took our drink orders - My Dad ordered a Stella Artois and we also ordered pitchers of Sangria. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to come back with waters and to also say that they're out of Stella Artois. No exaggeration - My Dad tried to order 4 more beers only for the waitress to come back and say that they don't have them anymore and need to update their menu. He finally says to just bring him any type of light beer similar to a Stella Artois only to be brought a beer that was as hoppy as a Sierra Nevada. The waitress finally brings the pitchers of Sangria after this debacle and it's completely watered down and gross. Manager comes over and apologizes and tells us that the Sangria is pre-made earlier in the day and must have gone bad.. he grabbed a straw, tasted it, and agreed. 

So we finally get some drinks and at this point we have been seated for 45 minutes and have finished the basket of bread. We ask for more bread and are told that they are all out of bread for the night... sigh. We ordered a couple appetizers/salads including the crab meat lettuce wraps which were delicious and the kale caesar salad which was also very good. Our dinner comes out and at this point we are seated for close to 2 hours. My Dad couldn't catch a break as the waitress forgot to ring in his flat bread so again the manager comes over and apologizes and says it will be made on the fly and out in a few minutes. 15 minutes go by and his pizza arrives under cooked and flavorless while all of us have pretty much completed our entrees. We didn't say anything about the flat bread and just chalked it up as a loss as my Mom ended up sharing her scallops with him. 

It's really unfortunate that they don't have their stuff together at all as the food and ambiance for the most part is great. As much as I want to love this place, my wife and I left there embarrassed that we brought our family there and unfortunately won't be returning.",dqDx3RduvEC--7j54h5GJQ,1,0,2,_HZYSluRbSNvwKYEVPjr1w
2468741,2012-11-11,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt earns a solid 4 stars in my book.  What they do, they do well.  Plenty of enjoyable options to eat, an incredibly welcoming atmosphere, and an attentive wait staff are all wonderful reasons to come by Honey Salt. 

Some of my highlights from Honey Salt: 
1. The Scallops!...actually the scallops are good, but the cauliflower puree and truffle sauce that they come on are simply delightful and elevate the dish a great deal!

2. The Midnight Rambler--Bourbon/Honey/Orange/Bitters/Ginger!..It is a Bourbon-forward, balanced drink...I think it is anyway...see my note below on consistency   

3. The Anaheim Pepper Mac-n-Cheese!  Why doesn't everyone use Anaheim Peppers with pasta and cheese?  They play so well together!

4. The Steak Tartar!  Capers and Pickled Papaya?...um, yes please!

5. The wall of mirrors won't ever get old for me.  Love the feel of that side of the room especially...and the general inviting feel of the space as a whole.

The bottom line for me on 4 stars and not 5?...
1. I enjoy unique/creative approaches and most of what I've tried at Honey Salt is fairly straight forward, with a subtle change here or there...I guess I was just hoping for a little more from this Farm-to-table style spot.

2. Consistency...I'm hoping they iron this out.  If they don't I would drop it a star or two instantly.  I enjoyed The Midnight Rambler a great deal on my 1st visit.  On my 2nd time to Honey Salt I received an unbalanced shot of bourbon with some hints of the other ingredients.  The lesson learned here?...See Leann (sp?) at the bar for a sure bet.  Same thing happened with the Free Range Brick Oven Chicken...wonderfully moist the 1st time--dry and tough the second...I would hate to have someone else order this thinking that I liked it if was not executed perfectly!

3.  There are a lot of tables in Honey Salt.  They also have a great wait staff that is on the ball and moving quickly to keep you satisfied...the overall outcome of this is like watching an ant farm while you eat.

2491126,2016-03-28,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Dined solo at Honey Salt this month and had a great meal.  I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted with a smile, menus, water and the specials.  Bar tender was very attentive along with the other staff. While eating at the bar, I did not feel that they were not pushy or overbearing- they kept their space but did their jobs as well.  I can definitely see why some people have trouble with their service.  There was not a designated hostess in sight (I wonder if they all serve and host.)

The restaurant itself wasa little loud and dimly lit, but the space is open which lends to that.  Both the drink and food menus have something to offer just about anyone.  I ordered the steak salad and was not disappointed. Cooked to order which for me is rare (no pun intended)

For dessert, I had a lava brownie that was oh so good... I would go back just for that. 

Tip: Wine Wednesday- any bottle of your choice for 1/2 the price. Can't/Don't want to finish? they'll pack it up for you along with receipt.",fRH_D8HIeHw_7xgPGkjuVw,1,0,4,nRTTVcLsKOiPmp_BzFaR6g

So I took the opportunity to go to Honey Salt on an impromptu day off this week with a friend. About as perfect a dining experience as I've ever had. The ambience is in inviting and open. The music was good the whole playlist I was there. The waiter and assistant were both wonderful. Helping guide us through this dining experience. We were recommended the scallops and the scampi. The Poke appetizer was light and delicious. The scallops (which usually are not my favorite) were divine in the truffle oil and the scampi were huge. The Mac and cheese was the right blend of cheesy and creamy with just a hint of spicy. Had to get the brookie as well for desert topped with salted caramel ice cream. Everything was good to the last bite. Best dining experience I've had all year and this restaurant and food choices get my highest recommendations!,X8FXx55SqlUqE4h4vcSLtQ,0,0,5,OETLaP8f2SvnRPn81b6kBQ

monkey bread was prefect for sharing.  warm, sweet, and gooey.  texture of the bread seemed as if it was warmed up in the microwave....?
steak and eggs sliders tasted like sausage seasonings with a good slab of beef and good slab of eggs.  comes in 2 sliders with a side of potato wedges.  some wedges could use a bit more time in the oven/fryer.  nice caramelized onions.
persimmon toast was simple but fresh.  2 toasted slices of bread topped with ricotta/honey, grilled persimmons and arugula.  comes with a shot of green juice.  healthy!
bfast pizza was a good size.  flatbread topped with bacons, cheese, and scrambled eggs.....it was odd so we asked for sunny side up eggs which looked gorgeous.

We were seated without a wait thanks to our reservation that we had booked a few days before. We were immediately greeted upon arriving at our table by Adrian. He asked if we would like any drinks to start and would give us a few minutes to look over the menu. He returned back with waters and gave us recommendations on his favorites to share before our main course. 

We took his advice on the appetizers and got an order of the monkey bread to share. They were to die for and the plate was cleaned within minutes! With our server being 1/1 I decided to take his advice and order the breakfast nachos with steak for my main meal. Again, Adrian did not disappoint with his taste selection. The rest of my party was also pleased with their food orders and we all left with a great first experience at the Honey Salt. 

Our server made the experience an easy first by guiding us through the menu and making selections that were exactly what we were looking for. His welcoming sense of humor and attention to detail, such as assuring our glasses were always full or making sure to stop by and check how we were, made this experience unique from other restaurants.

First and foremost, I have to rave about the monkey bread because it was the first item we shared. Omgggahhhhhhh *eyes rolling back*, it was just amazing. Theeee best monkey bread EVER! I don't think I'll ever make them at home again haha. It's perfection. That alone is enough to bring me back.

Everything else was good too. I was expecting more from the Ricotta pancakes the strawberry preserves was pretty over powering that the pancakes did not stand out. I especially enjoyed the frittata with bacon.

We made reservations and once we arrived to be seated there was already complications with the transitioning from the brunch menu into the dinner menu.  When we had initially made the reservations, the website stated that the dinner menu would start at 2:30; the whole reason why we made reservations at 3pm. That was mistake number one and the had to wait another 30 minutes at a table in order to order from the dinner menu.  We waited 40 minutes until our food arrived.  The steak I ordered was suppose to be a filet mignon, well done and was not cooked to my preference, so I had to send it back.  It took another 10 minutes and when it came back the steak was a strip steak not a filet and just bland; no seasoning whatsoever.  I would not recommend this restaurant, especially for the pricing of the food and the service was horrible.  The managers did nothing and did not apologize for the wait or cooking oversight.

This time around I can honestly say it has been less impressive than my past experiences. This last experience is disappointing because I have always spoke highly of the restaurant based off of the food and service. The food was mediocre compared to the pricing. Normally the pricing doesn't faze me if the food meets the price.  However, if I have to return an items due to under and over cooked temperatures it's disappointing. Also the menu that is supposed to be based off farm to table and seasonal ingredients hasn't dieviated from the last time I was here. The menu lacks imagination from the previous chefs before hand. Staples items aren't failures but lack of execution and change are. 
The service was ok. Not horrible but not the best as expected based off the business brand nor previous experiences... I often found myself asking the busser for service because he was the only around.",PSnqob8TEMz0K7cXGcaYig,0,0,3,E4ZlYylKJgWQhCbFTYCCDQ

We decided last minute to go in for their happy hour and, if we were in the mood, stretch it out into a full blown dinner.  Luckily, its Restaurant Week so there was no hesitation in deciding to stay for dinner!

One of the things I like about Honey Salt is they allow their customers to take part in the happy hour menu from the main dining room...a novel idea that I think more restaurants should allow for.  We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and the lump crab lettuce cups.  The latter was so good we ordered another!  Their cocktails were outstanding, as usual, and half-priced for HH.

They had a 3-course prix fixe menu specially for Restaurant Week and it was a knockout and fairly priced at $40.17 per person.  My wife chose the New England Fry for app, Steak Frites for main, and the ridiculously tasty fudge brownie/chocolate chip cookie/salted caramel ice cream dessert.  I had the Caesar salad, grilled Scottish salmon for main, and the vanilla panna cotta.  Everything was perfectly executed and delicious.  Service was spot-on as well - personable, efficient and attentive.

Honey Salt is a great place to have in our neighborhood and I'm glad they're here.  Consistency with restaurants isn't always easy to come by but Honey Salt manages to pull it off every time.  We'll definitely keep going back!",pY8HETTYFEgQZUTTdGBwhA,0,0,4,5_Qr4iRFifmC9OkeDSbU1A

The ambiance and high ceilings along with an instant greeting made me feel very welcomed. I loved the attire of the staff. You knew who was doing what depending on their matching outfits. I met a fellow foodie Kim, who I know from being a foodie. So this was a perfect place for a lunch date! We had both already looked up the menu and knew we wanted to try the turkey meatballs, so we decided on the meatball pizza as an app. Came with caramelized onions and a very fresh ricotta cheese. However the tomato sauce was too bland for my personal preference. I went with the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and Kim had the grilled cheese (that has a way fancier name than that). The chicken was fried to perfection and so juicy. The sweet mustard style sauce on it was so good I'd buy a bottle! It was also served with a chopped salad that was quite unique. It had radishes, edamame, and chunks of cheese. Way better than fries! I had a bite of Kim's grilled cheese and it was pretty bomb too, but I liked mine more. 
I also had a Bloody Mary as a cocktail, OMG why doesn't everyone make this drink with jalapeño vodka??! So smart! 
A little overpriced, but I guess that's Summerlin for you. The service was very good, til the end it got a little slow while waiting for our bill. I brought my boyfriend a green goodness juice, made with Kale, apples, fennel, celery and whatever other green things I'm forgetting.

I've looked at the menu before and it didn't look or sound like anything special. After dining here for 'In Between' I can officially say my friends tastes buds are shot. 

I ordered the Wagyu burger medium rare and was quite disappointed to have it delivered medium. The burger was still tasty however it was nothing spectacular. I do have to say the burger does reign over Gordon Ramsey BurGR at Planet Hollywood and Holsteins at Cosmopolitan. 

The fries that came with the burger were too salty and almost ruined the entire dish. 

I do have to say that the selection of tea was more exciting than the meal itself. The Organic Bangkok was an amazing tea with coconut from Harney & Sons. I'll be ordering that in the coming weeks. 

I was hoping since the  service started off great it would end great. Unfortunately the check was presented before the dessert menu. And I was looking forward to try the apple pie. Perhaps next time.

Overall a cool place, but not a destination restaurant and a bit pricey.  It is hard when a new restaurant has such a big hype, because if one thing goes wrong it is a let down.  I waited at the bar for my friends to arrive- not one person offered me anything.  Asking if I wanted a water would've been a nice hospitable touch.  The hostesses are very friendly, which makes it a welcoming environment when you first walk in!  

Table: We sat and I glanced over the menu and was searching desperately for some cool, home-made breakfast bakes, and some fun noshy items to share, but monkey bread was all we came up with so we started with that.  I ordered a cappuccino and unfortunately it came out luke warm and I had to return it.  The monkey bread was good, but it was drowning in butter and was missing something..a bit heavy on the bread and not enough flavor.  The server was polite, but not as on top of things as I expected reading the service reviews.  We tried the salmon, breakfast pizza and heirloom salad.  ALL the food was good, but a bit overpriced.  If this restaurant was in San Fran or LA it wouldn't stand out at all.

Summary: I will definitely try this place again for dinner if I am in the area visiting a friend in Summerlin, but wouldn't go out of my way.

The look is very nice. They've opened up the middle where the bar was, and the restaurant is open and warm.  The bench all the way across one side is nice, and the mirrors are great. I think it has a great look and feel to the space. Much better to me than Nora's did. 

Like a lot of the other reviews, I think the noise is too much. They have music on pretty loud, and the way it's set up the noise of the other customers is enough and it becomes hard to hear the people you're sitting with

I really wanted to like it. I had a really nice night out. The problem is the food is disappointing (other than the bread pudding which was awesome), as it's average at best. The waiter was really nice and meant well, but didn't do so well. And, the noise is really an issue. I liked it, but no hurry to go back.",3MO--ENqKScLFQFuW1751g,0,0,2,XAY7ksyRwwGIjX4yMwNKWQ

Monkey bread cinnamon rolls, berry ricotta, breakfast pizza and corned beef hash. I also had a coffee and a blood orange bottomless mimosa.

FOOD: We came here for Sunday brunch. The menu was extremely limited. One of us ordered a lemon chicken salad , there was no trace of lemon and she said the dressing didn't taste citrus like either. Not sure if that's even what they gave her, but it's what was ordered. She also said the avocado was missing from her salad. Other friend ordered a chicken caeser and she was happy with it for the most part. Both of them said the portions were very small for a $15 salad. I opted for a bacon burger. It was $17. The burger itself was very good, however the fries were ice cold. After a 12-15 minute wait our server came back with fresh fries...but my friends were already done eating. 
SERVICE: server was very nice, but it was clear she was either under-trained or had too many tables. Regardless, she was extremely overwhelmed, and told us so. She did have a good attitude, and we were patient.

The spices that were mixed in this dish blended perfectly making my tastebuds sing! Naturally I couldn't say no to dessert. I ordered the bread pudding and I was blown away!

2633113,2012-11-26,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I'm going to buck the trend of raves here but, will definitely return, try more dishes and give them time to work out service kinks. Jen S. set up a Sunday UYE luncheon which I'd really been looking forward to in this lovely, completely revamped spot.

I'd already decided perusing menu online that the quinoa/lentil salad would be my dish, as I'm pescy/veg these days; Tien had the same dish but with the intended free range chicken atop. While my dish was tasty, the value vs price factor was not there for me. Others raved about the ""Crack Chick Fil A"" sandwich and the burgers (I tasted one of Anthony's fries and it was good) the salad accompanying the chicken looked terrific and oddly, was almost the size of my whole dish (see photo) Everyone enjoyed their food, but the service hiccups were many: the meal took close to two hours and servers seemed downright confused splitting checks, delivering the correct dishes and keeping on top of water refills. I specified that I'm a fan of a very spicy Bloody Mary, and it was anything but...only saving grace was (once we figured out which was my drink on the several checks delivered) seeing that it was only $7. Christina enjoyed the pumpkin cheesecake and the bread pudding (huge!) was ordered by a few folks who seemed to really dig it, too. 

Again, the space was bright, airy and whimsical and it holds promise, but for me, the best part of my meal was the delightful company of fellow Yelpers. For a $28 lunch, there just has to be more: in portions (adding soup or the Green Goddess juice?) and service that is less scattered. Will definitely allow them some time to work on growing pains and still have hope for HS as the food was very good and the fresh/farm to table concept is welcome in Summahood.

* note: After this review, I was contacted to come back & identify myself. Not my style.*

I did, however, bring a Yelp Hurricane Sandy Fundraising flyer which the Hostess brought to Kim (who was sitting in Dining Room between lunch and dinner service and would not even address me or greet me) he sent Hostess back to relay ""they are a new business and cannot help."" I felt bad for her and was so turned off by his attitude = never support them again and I've stuck to that. 

They seem to be doing fab with the ""see and be seen"" Summahood crowd. More power to them. The Ipswich clams were on my radar, but rudeness trumped that desire.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,7,5,4,oVZx5qmq7GbD9JmLdgBrPQ
2640860,2013-06-05,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"This place is awesome! I am so so so so so so so happy we finally got to come here. My husband & I have been eating out a lot lately, and every place turns out to be meh, very mediocre, but this place lives up to the hype. It is FANTASTIC! We came on a Saturday & made reservations for 8. When we showed up, our couch was ready & we got to lounge while looking through the menu surrounding by their cute decor. It is very garage sale chic. 

We started off with the Cape Cod Fry or whatever it was called. It was delicious! Less than one month ago, I was at Disneyland and ate so much fried garbage that I vowed to never eat anything fried again but my husband really wanted this, so I succumbed and was happy we ordered it. Everything was very lightly fried (there were peppers, clams, and calamari rings) with high quality ingredients. For our entrees, I ordered ""My Wife's Favorite Salad"". Oh my goodness. I eat a lot of salad. Usually at least once a day, but this was my favorite salad ever. The duck confit was magnifique with that poached egg that oozed yolk all over my lightly tossed greens. I sometimes do not like fruit in my salad, but the pomegranate seeds & orange slices in this salad made it amazing. There was sweet, salty, crunchy, and indulgent (that fatty duck) which made this the perfect dish. 

My husband ordered the Filet which was SO tender. Oh my goodness. They gave him this steak knife that wasn't serrated so I was wondering how he was going to cut through this thing. That crappy knife cuts through this filet like butter. It tastes like butter. It melts in your mouth like butter. For $32, this steak was WELL worth it. If you're craving steak, DO NOT GO TO OUTBACK, come here instead! You get it on top of a bacon potato hash which is amazing! I wasn't a fan of their steak sauce though. It tasted like A1 with BBQ. Next time, I would ask for it on the side. We also got Mac & Cheese on the side (so yummy, cheesy, and creamy) as well as roasted cauliflower with kale (this was alright). For dessert, their baked in a brown bag apple pie with their salty caramel ice cream is a MUST. That ice cream definitely has chunks of salt in it, but is so good with the apple pie. They balance each other out perfectly, which is great, because I tend to dislike overly sweet thing. Overall, I am SO excited that we finally tried Honey Salt & we will certainly be back.

Tip: Make a reservation. My in-laws showed up on a Monday night. 1 hour wait. We came a couple of Fridays ago, 1 hour wait. Just make a reservation if you know you're coming. This place is always packed because it's AMAZING!!",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,3,1,5,Ec9qmBMAc8BkgF07eMmiwg

Waitress was very friendly and attentive. 
Tried the Tuscan Bean soup. Nice with a light broth, beans and vegetables. It could have used a little salt, but overall good.

The place was covered with rustic bricks, great artwork, good-looking servers with matching good service.  A ""boutique"" restaurant with ""boutique"" food - a cross section between the comfort staples and froo-froo fare that does not skimp on seasoning.  

The New England fry-d calamari and mussels were divine - light, crispy with a tangy/slightly spicy sauce.  The charcuterie pizza had different salami and ricotta and fennel was excellent (but I thought it could've been served without the spicy oil).  My ahi salad was almost perfect - the spinach with pickled onions were... haunting, lol, for lack of a better term.  I so want to replicate it at home.  But the seared tuna's crust I think could be improved.  Maybe a little more salt and heat to play off the already sweet bed of jicama and asparagus.  The backyard burger my husband loved, but my brother in law complained about the salt levels.  The burger platters came with your own catsup bottle.  How can you not like this place?

2696910,2013-09-11,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I had high expectations...I always screw myself when that happens. But for all its hype, Honey Salt just fell short for me.

The service was good. Everything came out in a timely manner and everyone was friendly. I liked the decor too. Understated, with a touch of elegance.

The complimentary bread service was delightful: a soft, sweet whole wheat roll and crispy lavash. But it was served with a bland bean purée. There's a couple of things I have a problem with here. I understand serving it with the lavash, but the roll? Nah, homey. That thing screamed for butter (I asked for some and they obliged me). Also, the purée had some crushed pink peppercorns in it which, to me, didn't make sense culinarily and was a bit off putting.

For an appetizer, we shared the ""New England Fry"": a combination of clams (with the belly) and calamari. I'm not sure what they battered them in...maybe semolina or polenta? But they weren't as crispy as I'd like them to be. The creamy sauce had a little kick, which I liked and it was served with blistered whole shishito chiles. I would've preferred them sliced and pickled because the dish could use some acid. Overall, the flavor was there, but lacked some finesse.

My wife ordered the salmon. Pretty ordinary. It was also rare in the middle. I like my salmon med rare or medium, but this was rare. The garnishes (peppadew sauce and quinoa pilaf) were good by themselves, but couldn't stand up to the big flavor of the fish. Overall, this dish felt muddled and confused.

I chose the scallops. Definitely the star of the show. The roasted cauliflower and herb salad it was served with were delicious. I did have some problems with this plate, though. Lets just keep vanilla where it belongs, shall we? Good in dessert. Does not belong in my cauliflower purée. Also, I detected no truffle flavor in the ""truffle"" sauce. The scallops, though, were perfectly cooked and this more than made up for the minor indiscretions.

The Mac and Cheese was very good, as well. I liked that they added some peppers and kale to it. It gave the flavor a subtle vegetal quality which was welcome.

Overall, the food fell flat. Kinda like this review. Meh...",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,9,4,3,-Sb_qD4kwNAG0htVJ200MA
2700038,2018-04-10,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"My family went here yesterday because we had an out of town visitor. We have a young child so we typically go one to any restaurants website first to scope out what we are going to order. I looked on their own website and decided on the Shrimp Scampi. 

When we arrived, they were not busy at all. There is much construction go my on you could hardly tell where the restaurant was. The construction guys are indiscriminately dropping pieces of the facade off the roof and down to the cement walkway where customers are walking so watch out for falling objects! We were seated and the waiter came right over. Their happy hour ends at six and a few people in our party wanted a glass of wine. They asked if they could get an order in during happy hour which was ending in about five minutes. The waiter grumbled but agreed. I was the DD so I ordered a coke. I looked at the menu he gave us and didn't see the Shrimp Scampi dish so I asked about it. The waiter told us that the menu changes seasonally and that I shouldn't trust websites like yelp to predetermine my meal (he said this in condescending way and with a bit of attitude for some reason). I told him that YOUR website advertises it on the menu, and he said ""well someone should change that then shouldn't they?"" And he walked off. 

He brought out everyone's wine, and asked if he can get us anything else. I asked for my coke that I ordered and he said, ""oh yeah I'll grab that"" and kind of stood there. I told him I'd like the drink now as no one is ready to order because at least three of us were going to order the Shrimp Scampi. 


Two people ordered the Scallops which were extremely salty but other than that were ok. The other two people order a burger and salmon which they said was fine. I ordered the chicken which was super dry, the Mac and cheese looked old, and I didn't even try the broccoli that was served as a side. At the end of the meal I asked for a coffee which was like warm and very weak and some people ordered dessert. The dessert seemed to be the best thing we had as everyone agreed they were good. 


The reason for the two star review was that our waiter gave me attitude for inquiring about a dish on their own website and the general mediocrity of the food in addition to the heavy construction going on.

2716861,2015-02-17,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I've heard a lot of rave reviews about Honey Salt, but was a little disappointed after finally trying it out. We went here (party of two) for Sunday Brunch and were able to OpenTable a reservation for noon (placed reservation at 11am) so we didn't have to wait. We ended up waiting anyway, with a party of 8 walking in just after us but still getting seated first (after overhearing they didn't have a reservation, but they knew someone). 

It took a really long time to talk to a server, whom we saw only once more when he came to bring us our check (that we had to request from someone else). Also, the servers don't wear nametags and wear jeans/plain shirts, so it can be hard to tell who is a customer and who is a server.

We ordered the Monkey Bread to start, which even though it wasn't to my taste, my boyfriend said was the best he'd ever had. He ordered the steak & egg sliders with breakfast potatoes and raved about the potatoes. I ordered the backyard burger and it was a decent burger, but nothing to write home about. Prices were a little steep. 

I ordered a soft drink, he ordered an ice tea, and our glasses sat empty for most of the meal after we polished off our drinks halfway through the monkey bread starter. Not sure if you have to ask for refills or if you are charged extra, but that was a little annoying. 

One other thing - this place is LOUD and there is very little to absorb the noise. I've been in larger and equally packed rooms and not had it be as loud as it was here.

Cons: Overpriced, tendency to overcook.

Honey Salt is a homey, well-rounded, professional American high-end sit-down restaurant/steakhouse. The restaurant's ambience, color arrangements, furniture designs, and setup were phenomenal; couldn't have asked for more out of this type of American cuisine chef-run place. The Charred Filet Mignon was overcooked fairly heavily (though I requested Medium). Entrees overall otherwise were phenomenal, with a wide range of taste profiles and menu options, also with your traditional Free Range Chicken and Filet Mignon. Appetizers were great as well: I highly recommend the octopus and balsamic tomato salad. The octopus appetizer dish had good portions, and an AMAZING sauce for $15.00 which was a decent deal for large portions at such a high-end venue. Unfortunately, the suckers on the tentacles of the octopus were slightly charred/burned, and some were quite underdone. If you find a well done piece, you are guaranteed to love it. 

I would recommend trying the: octopus appetizer, balsamic tomato appetizer, quinoa appetizer, Free Range Chicken entree, and Medium/Medium-Rare (they tend to overcook) Filet Mignon. 

Thanks to Honey Salt for a overall fabulous restaurant experience!",uo_pVsOEkfe-6LwsWGOnkg,1,1,4,GO3D_qaMAenzQV6jIa25Uw

I spend half of my year in Vegas working and frequent many of the local restaurants. Honey Salt is one of my favorites. Although good food and good service is a must have, my colleague and I look for a wee bit more than that. At Honey Salt, we have gotten to know the wait staff, the support staff and the managers. When we arrive, we are greeted warmly, and treated as one of the family. I hate to throw out the Cheers analogy, but heck, it's like Cheers. 

We have frequented other restaurants where the atmosphere is a bit too stuffy for my liking, so we don't return. The Honey Salt Restaurant  is like comfort food that calms and satisfiesLiving in a hotel room for half the year, it's therapeutic to be greeted with wonderful smiles and a warm reception. 
Our last waiter, (see photo), Adrian, is attentive and works hard to make sure that our visit suns smoothly. Be sure to order a salad so he can pepper it up with his Samurai Sword pepper grinder!
I won't embellish on the menu, it's all delicious. Add great cuisine with a warm friendly staff and you have a winner.",hQB0AtziNj7dNGzOdQixtQ,0,0,4,_HuMvLt0oPR1sj2GxNS1-w

At the end of the meal the manager came by our table to ask how our meal was and we mentioned that $3 charge and he was not very accommodating, stating that there is protein in the gravy so they have to charge, he acted as if we were just trying to get something for free and believe me, $3 is not going to break me. He asked about our experience and we told him. So many people say ""everything is good"" when asked ""how was your meal?"" and the restaurant doesn't get constructive feedback. But when you do provide feedback, restaurants like this take it personally. BTW, the manger ended up taking it off the bill, but it wasn't without attitude.

What a GREAT meal!!!!

Service was flawless...the server, did not get her name :-(, mad props though, was super friendly, able to answer any questions, and had a great sense of humor and definitely made my friend and I feel welcome.  The assistants were great about clearing plates, refilling drinks, etc...

We were there on a Sunday morning and she stressed getting breakfast items because it is the only day of the week they offer breakfast,

My friend and I started with sharing a bowl of fresh fruit and had a nice surprise of fresh mint that added a little extra to the flavors.  I enjoyed a great breakfast frittata with potatoes, tomatoes, and other vegetables.  It was hot and super delicious.  My friend had a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which she could not put down!  I could see the juiciness of the sandwich and hear the crunch!  She really loved it!

Despite being stuffed, we shared a giant caramel chocolate crunch slice of cake.  It was rich and delicious.

The food overall was average if not a little overpriced. The restaurant has overall very hip feel and their menu has some nice health conscious choices too which I did like.

Free range chicken power grain ""salad""- basically a salad of lentils and quinoa mixed with some nuts and berries. I liked this a lot. It was very filling and more healthy however the dish lacked seasoning. Maybe using a little citrus vinaigrette could have brighten the dish a lot. The chicken also was basically a plain grilled breast which also had no flavor. Adding a seasoning rub wouldn't hurt.

Cubano sandwich- this was a nice sandwich. The bread was soft however the filling was a little sparse. Claims that the dish came with ""French fries"" but these were basically potato chips. They were nice and very crispy, but not French fries.

Bread pudding- this was a decent dessert. Very thick and rich. I love the sauce which had a hint of alcohol in it. Very comforting. 

(I will rant about the Service- normally I don't comment on service, but this was the worst service I've had in a very long time. We were seated and 10 mins passed before anyone came to the table to even offer us drinks. This was at 2pm- so not during a rush lunch hour. Supposedly our waiter was backed up so the manager had to come and take our orders. Then after we placed our orders, another 5 mins passed where we never got our water cups filled and we didn't get any of the starter bread crisps that were on everyone else's table. I had to flag a random bus boy down to give us some water. Then after another 10mins a different worker came and gave us our entrees and just left without letting us ask for refills. No one gave us utensils so we sat there for several more mins before I could flag someone down for utensils. Just horrible.)",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,4,1,3,xdxy0uowkdlIU0QCLdo3nw

2787453,2014-09-07,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Every time I go to Vegas, I look for restaurants that are off the strip. I have found great dim sum, Italian, German, and so on. On our last trip at the end of July 2014, I took to Google to assist me in my search for a restaurant. Using the search words, ""Las Vegas off strip best restaurant,"" led me to Honey Salt and I am glad it did.

There were four of us staying at a hotel on the strip. We braved the over 100 degree afternoon temperatures to travel to Honey Salt (HS) for dinner. A relatively short drive to the northwest of the strip. HS was just making the transition from its limited afternoon menu to its dinner menu when we showed up. Evidently afternoon diners are not seated in the main dining room and are instead seated in a much smaller side area. Management accommodated us and seated us in the main dining room despite the fact that the dinner service was not yet ready
.
We ordered pork chops, grilled octopus, turkey meatballs, and the New England Fry, along with sides of roasted cauliflower, macaroni and cheese, and french fries. Great tasting bread and some sort of large (very large) triangular cheese cracker were served with whipped honey butter before the food we ordered arrived.

The pork chop was very thick but was super tender; amazingly tender. It was served with an apple coleslaw that complemented the pork chop well. I like applesauce with my pork chop (hey, you can't break some childhood habits) but you never get that when dining out, so this was a nice surprise and a nice adult substitute for apple sauce.

The grilled octopus was also good - it wasn't rubbery or difficult to chew as some octopus can become. 

The New England Fry consisted of calamari and Ipswich clams with a nice dipping sauce, all very delicious. 

The calamari wasn't soggy, wasn't too small, and the breading wasn't over done. 

The turkey meatballs were served in a red sauce and did not disappoint. They were just the right size. 

The french fries had the right consistency - not too crunchy, not to soft - and just the right amount of salt. 

The roasted cauliflower turned out to be the favorite for most of us (3 out of 4 isn't bad). 

The macaroni and cheese was also delicious, but I thought it was much too salty. Another of our group thought the salt ratio was just right, but she loves extra salt on everything. I thought the salt content of the macaroni and cheese overwhelmed an otherwise excellent product... they might want to rethink the amount of salt they're putting into it.

Because I was the designated driver (yes, we did drink and drive responsibly while in Las Vegas), I didn't drink any alcohol aside from taking a sip of my dining companion's wine, a Malbec. I don't recall the vintner, but it was a good Malbec.

Dessert consisted of three items. A glass with a layer of chocolate pudding, then a layer of butterscotch pudding, topped with mascarpone and chocolate dust, with salted caramel popcorn on top of that and on the side. It went down fast. The next was chocolate cake that had layers of chocolate mousse; also delicious. And then there was a brownie dish (I forget the name, but we know it as a slutty brownie) with a side of ice cream. All three were very good and worthy of ordering again. 

And we had coffee with the meal and even that was good, but we did have to wait for the temperature of the cup and the coffee to go down so that lips did not blister.

The wait staff was excellent, personable, friendly, and on top of things. Water glasses did not go empty. Requests were met with smiles and a seeming desire to please.

The decor is pleasant and the place has a cool vibe to it. Even the wait staff, the two female bartenders, and the management have a cool vibe.

We'll be back and, judging from our first visit, it will be a pleasure to do so. The owners and staff should be very proud of this place. We've already provided the info to this place for several of our friends who will soon be in Vegas. Sometimes getting off the beaten path (the Strip) is so worth it.

(For the reviewer who was upset because the staff at HS didn't acknowledge her seven year old child's birthday and complained that the staff could have brought a brownie or something to the table so that their whole group could have sang ""Happy Birthday"" to her child, you could have and should have bought the birthday dessert for your child and you could have made that experience happen instead of complaining that it was someone else's responsibility.  Yes, it would have been nice if the restaurant had offered a complimentary brownie while you were seated, but as your child's mother, it's your responsibility to make memorable experiences for your child, not the restaurant's.  Take responsibility for your own failure and own it, don't put it on someone else.)",-XexoBnwNbx_uYxIoZhosA,0,0,4,s5cSTFSxsb_xuGbM6W0r8g

One of the couples at our table split a Caesar salad, made with half kale and my wife and I split the Burrata Salad. Both salads were great. I'm still thinking about that Burrata. 

So, I somewhat begrudgingly ordered the Brick Oven Chicken because it came with the Macaroni and Cheese. I mean, who goes out and orders chicken? Well, it was pretty much the best chicken EVER! The yogurt-creamed spinach that came with my wife's steak was great as well.

I told the server/manager on the floor and he apologized and brought it back to the executive chef who was also shocked at how raw it was. They fixed the plate but it was a huge let down. I shelled out $26 for a plate that came out raw and was tossed around again, no discount, no compensation.

2865401,2012-11-15,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt is a newly-opened restaurant near Boca Park. I would best describe the menu as American where the food is farm-to-table inspired. I ordered the Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese which includes cheesy true fondue, rustic sourdough and a cup of tuscan bean soup. In short, it's a grilled cheese on sourdough with a cup of bean soup. It was still one of the best grilled cheeses I've tried. The prices are on the steep side for what you get at Honey Salt but it does tout healthier and tasty options. Since they're fairly new and probably still working out kinks in their system, service can be extremely slow at times. Nevertheless, I'll be returning to try their warm bread pudding which I hear is divine.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,0,0,3,DBBgXe3N8rrei9R6u3Gf3w
2874484,2017-06-27,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,I got to eat at this cute little place for restaurant week. That's a bonus star right there that they care about the local community. Our server even told us about their specials and how the chef grows the produce himself and brings it farm to table. She let us know that the Meatballs and the Farmer's Toast are specialities along with my choice of the Biloxi Fried Chicken sandwich. Boy! Was it a big portion served with perfectly crunchy housemade chips. The busser was attentive to detail and overall great service. We finished with a simple and sweet panna cotta and the brookie was the prize of the desserts. It was a perfect dream of chocolatey goodness. Thanks for the experience! Will definitely be coming back for some good cocktails too.,yxtwZzmnCYiMatSeT65rAA,0,0,5,gw19TtPuX_QWHOEA2C0cfw
2877618,2017-03-21,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"What I loved about Honey salt was their salmon.  I haven't been there since last fall and went for lunch yesterday.  I ordered the salmon and grilled vegetables.  For $20+ I got 2 little squares of salmon about 2"" x 2"".  My friend ordered a the same thing and got a similar portion.

What a rip off!!!!  It was the measliest portion and I can't believe they serve it that way with a straight face!  In the past, you would get a beautiful salmon steak.

Also, we got there at about 12:25, please was maybe 1/4 full (it started to fill up later) and the service was incredibly slow.

Reducing portions, raising prices and slow service.  That's just not the way to get people to come back.",q_CAgG4x-1K0jTRUtzJz2Q,0,0,1,wlnZ6UoepDouFBOUQwk_9g
2878522,2015-07-25,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"LOVE! They provide these thin baked cracker things paired with a sweet butter to tide you over for a bit. I know I sound like an idiot describing that but I can't think of the proper term for them. For dinner time they have the same things but also include fresh baked bread. They have an awesome lunch special for about $21. You can get an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. Their Caesar salad is to die for as is their meatball appetizer. Their Fried Chicken Sandwich comes with a honey mustard and coleslaw and two pieces of the best boneless fried chicken I have had in my life. It is so moist and simply melts in your mouth. For dinner I've had the scallops, which were impeccable. For desert I've had the strawberry sorbet and the brownie, which came out so warm and deliciously gooey. 

Beverage wise I've had their Garden Mule which is a modified version of a Moscow Mule. I've also had a blood orange soda and a fancy tea. Everything was amazing. 

They have complimentary salt water taffy at the hostess stand which is AHMAYZING!!!! They also have a salt scrub in their bathroom for you to test that they sell out friend. The salt scrub is great and leaves your skins so soft and hydrated. 

My only complaint is that they will rent out the restaurant for private parties but won't notify on any of their social media that they're close to the public. I arrived once and they were hosting a private party so I drove all the way there for nothing, which was extremely annoying and inconvenient. Especially when I was so looking forward to stuffing my face with nummy food. The other complaint was that I called ahead to make a lunch reservation and it wasn't put down. So I arrived and I was told I didn't have a reservation. Luckily it was not busy and I didn't have to wait for anything but I'm sure it would've been a different story if it was busy.",MZINn-irLWvJKe7jd0_ctg,0,0,5,bR-bdn1IrR1YmUMg_aSVrQ

We are Bay Area transplants and the vibe of this place definitely reminded me of home/SF restaurants. We were seated promptly and were able to take in the decor of the restaurant. I think because we went so early after it opened that we didn't get to experience the best of Honey Salt. Although the food was good (had the scallops), service was lacking:

1) we had a constant rotation of bussers/waiters/servers/I'm not sure what they were
2) we never got any bread
3) slow on refills
4) long wait for food due to bad expediting and the workers seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off
5) they delivered the wrong food to our table a couple of times

Employees look like they can wear any type of top they want, as long as it's plaid, so guys, don't plan on wearing plaid when bringing a date here. 3 stars for the atmosphere and food (when we got it), I would have ranked it lower, but we were in good company and giving them the benefit of the doubt that they have gotten better since.

Since happy hour had just started, the place wasn't too crowded yet so we were able to easily find a seat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the Mosc-ito to start which was very light and refreshing. It had a good balance of flavors between the alcohol and the other ingredients. Next I tried the Midnight Rambler and it was delicious; they definitely don't water down the drinks here like a lot of craft cocktail bars do. When I was going to order a second drink, the bartender offered to make me his version of an Old Fashioned (friends who are regulars here tell me that he makes a lot of custom off-the-menu drinks!). I watched him make it which was fascinating since he lit a cinnamon stick on fire and told me to blow it out and stick it in the drink after (that was a first!). The drink was delicious and I left the bar pretty tipsy so you know that's a sign of a good time!

I was told there was glorious soup there. It was a salt/sugar/honey scrub. It smelled great and they also had room keys on the wall. Thought that was cool. We got seated and had Nick as our waiter. He was the best part. He kept our glasses full and kept us entertained while we waited for our food. I just ended up order a bowl of fruit and the endless mimosas. I don't think my glass was ever empty and I liked that. My friends order some pizza and random sausage that was apparently it was delicious but they did not share. RUDE.

2952822,2013-04-01,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I feel Honey Salt is still trying to find its identity; both in the food and interior design department.  The dining room is too open; reminded me of a high school cafeteria...too cramped and far too loud.  I was seated along the far wall of tables with half booth, half chair.  They seriously need to remove about 5 tables from this row and space things out a bit. Diners do not like to be sitting on top of one another; there was literally 6"" of space between the tables...""ummm excuse me, may I borrow your pepper?""  Not a fan...far too loud and cramped.  Call your interior designer back out and get some aesthetic acoustic panels installed; that will go a long way (trust me I know, it's part of my business).

Onto the food...well, everything was so-so.  Turkey meatballs were undersized and not all that flavorful.  The salmon (ordered medium well) was nearly raw in the middle. It was a nice flavor and portion size but the cooks need to know how to prepare to a proper temperature.  The brown bag apple pie was pretty tasty...not really sure what the brown bag has to do with it but it's a unique presentation and tasted pretty good.

The service:  Started out slow...the table wasn't greeted for about 10 minutes; to his credit the place was packed.  BUT, after that our server proved himself.  I believe his name was Nick and he did a fantastic job after the initial slow start.

- 1 star for poor design concept and noise
- 1 star for barely above average food taste at quite a premium $

I arrived on-time for my 7pm reservation but had to wait for my table to be made ready which took about 5 minutes.  That showed me just how popular this place really is!!

My guest and I each ordered the prix fix menu and decided to get the opposite of each other so we could taste everything!

For starters I had the turkey meatballs, which were served very tender with a tasty red sauce on top, they were gone very quickly!  I had a few bits of the Caesar salad which was very fresh and crisp.  There was also a bread basket, the butter which has both a hint of honey and salt (HAH) was really good!

Next up was the oven roasted chicken with Mac & Cheese.  The chicken was tender with only one bone, which allowed me to enjoy it instead of hunting for bones and fat to pick out.  My guest had the scallops, she said they were amazing, I've never had them so I have no standard to compare to.

Finally was dessert, the best part.  First a bread pudding served like a tall square cake, and a apple crisp a la mode.  I'm not even a bread pudding fan, but that thing was amazing, so warm and soft.  I love apple crisp and this didn't disappoint, but next to the bread pudding it was definitely second place.

Besides one MINOR things thing that was not perfect, our buttermilk fried chicken was a bit over cooked, everything else was spot on delish!

We had several apps to share - 
Mac & Cheese -OMG-YUMMERS!!!, 
Shishito Peppers -a bit too spicy for us, which was surprising because they are rarely hot. Maybe because we are late in the Shishito Pepper season?
and Alote Corn- Which was so, so good! 

Dinners were a success. I especially liked the gnocchi! And the Buttermilk Chicken sandwich is always a hit!

Save room for dessert!! We ordered the apple pie, and a toffee crunch pudding.
The pie was delicious in a super classic, can't go wring kind of way. I say that with love and respect!! The caramel toffee pudding on the other hand was surprising, sweet, crunch and the hit of the night! But I confess, we are all a bunch of sugar fiends!!

Honey Salt was a nice restaurant, but I felt the lunch menu didn't give you a lot of options. I really would have loved to try some of the stuff on their dinner menu (which I didn't know was on their dinner menu until our party of 9 sat down for lunch).

FOOD - 2.5/5
Fried Calamari - 4/5
These little sea creatures were lightly battered and fried excellently. The batter almost reminded me of tempura batter because of how light the starch was. The dipping sauce it came with didn't pair well at all (too creamy).

Market Salad - 3/5
Although the salad had a lot of ingredients (edammame, cheese, carrots, etc) all of the pieces were not the same size. I didn't like the cheese cubes being twice the size of the veggies. There were more salad toppings that actual lettuce and kale too.

Still Water - 0/5
Where I dine, I've never been charged for water. The server only gave us two options for water, bottled or still water. Why the heck would you trick people into ordering water they will be charged for *WITHOUT* telling them about it? That small carafe of still water cost $4 and it tasted like tap water.


SERVICE - 3/5
Service itself was ok, but the wait staff could have been a little more attentive to our large party that was seated right next to the kitchen. 


OVERALL - 2.5/5
The best part of our meal was the company and a plate of calamari, which cost as much as an entree (just saying). 

Not sure if I would ever be back in the area since it's way the heck off strip in Las Vegas. Pass for me.

My boyfriend and I went with a couple friends for dinner on a Thursday night that wasn't particularly busy. We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated right away. The decor is an eclectic mix of shabby chic meets rustic farmhouse (it would be an absolutely fabulous venue for a wedding reception!). 

The food was for sure the star of the show. There were four of us and we wanted to try a variety of things. We started out with the deliciously seasoned hummus with an olive oil drizzle and grilled pita bread. We couldn't keep our hands off of it. Next - calamari that was so incredibly good! Not chewy at all (which is a total deal breaker for me when it comes to calamari) and the aioli dip paired perfectly with it. My boyfriend and I split the Caesar salad and it was excellent. The dressing was fresh and flavorful. 

Entrees. I went with the caramelized sea scallops. They were grilled to perfection and I thoroughly enjoyed them with the exception of the vanilla bean sauce. It made it slightly too sweet for me but the rest of the entree was smashing. I would most definitely get it again, just without the sweet sauce. My boyfriend decided on the charred filet and it was cooked perfectly. He's very particular about the doneness of his steak and the chef did not disappoint. The fingerling potatoes and asparagus were a perfect compliment to the steak and he was most definitely satisfied. 

The service was outstanding. Our server, TJ, took care of us and was extremely knowledgable on the menu and answered all of our questions. He was helpful and accommodating without being overbearing and we enjoyed our conversation with him. We'll for sure request him agin the next time we come in. The manager stopped by our table to ensure that everything was okay and we appreciated the extra attentiveness. 

The menu changes periodically, almost making it feel like a different restaurant every time. Breakfast is supposed to be amazing and I'm looking forward to trying that out as well.

It's so cute inside... kind of a country chic look.  Casual but stylish.  The tables and chairs don't all match and the chandeliers are a charming touch.  The space is open with high ceilings so that may contribute to it being a bit loud inside.
We got there a bit before noon on Friday.  It wasn't super busy... just a handful of tables were sat.  But when we looked around at 12:30pm it seemed like the place was 3/4 full, so they do a good lunch service which is good to see.
The menu has a nice variety on it, and the cocktail and wine/beer list has lots of good looking choices.

I started off with the Mosc-ito.  I could drink this all day.  It wasn't sweet... it wasn't harsh. It was like a Moscow mule and a Mojito... It was light and refreshing.  Perfect for a hot day.

For lunch, we did their 3-course Prix Fixe menu for $21 per person (note... the whole table does not have to do this).... choice of soup or salad, a choice of sandwich and a choice of strawberry sorbet or pumpkin bread pudding.  Since there was 2 of us... we got 1 of each of the desserts so we could try both.  Score!  Anyways...

I had the market salad and the backyard burger.  My girlfriend had the soup and the Farmers Toast (open faced) Sandwich. 

My salad was very tasty and I noticed on the menu that it comes Entrée sized too... which I would totally do again.  The salad was crisp and had pepitas in it which IMO totally add a different texture which I loved, and the dressing was like a light creamy vinaigrette.  My burger was cooked just right (medium) and had good flavor.  The bun it came on was a brioche bun I belive... it was great but it was too much bread so I ended up not eating half of the bread.  Oh!  And it came with fries.  The fries were cooked just right... crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Because I knew we were going to enjoy dessert too... I didn't eat all my fries.  But I wanted to.

The soup my GF had was the sweet corn soup and she said she really enjoyed it as well as the Farmers Toast which was very pretty looking, and she said it tasted as good as it looked too.  Hers also came with fries.

Our desserts of sorbet and bread pudding did not disappoint.  The strawberry sorbet was sweet but not too sweet and had bits of fresh strawberry in it.  The bread pudding was rich and decadent!  

For the 2 of us... the bill was $68.  Not cheap but we had a drink each and both enjoyed a 3 course meal too.  Definitely was NOT hungry until much much later that night.

I'll definitely come back!",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,3,2,4,ThmgzXby3S7CC-8WYrmHVA

The unique dishes they serve come out beautifully staged and full of flavor. Make sure to save room for dessert. Sharing the Brookie should be a requirement although I am sure I could eat it all by myself. 
There is a bar (with tv), booths, or tables to sit. It can get a bit crowded, but for me that makes the eating experience a bit more intense- if that makes sense. I like seeing others enjoy the food as much as I do. There is patio seating, that would be big for a big group.

3014538,2014-01-30,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"After driving around to find some fried chicken, I finally parked at Honey Salt for some lunch on a beautiful, cool day.  There is outdoor seating but the indoor seating was so nice and bright, it didn't matter where we parked for a meal.  It's very modern and comfortable inside, with mismatched chairs that create a cohesive dining area.  After scanning the brief menu, I landed on the one thing I heard so much about--the fried chicken sandwich.

First, the appetizer of turkey meatballs arrived.  The meatballs were moist, flavorful, and the sauce with ricotta was just perfect.  I could eat a whole order on my own and be satisfied for lunch.  I did not crave it the next day, but it is good eats.

The chicken sandwich arrived right as I took the last bite of my meatball appetizer, presented freshly with a side salad and stacked nicely.  I had high expectations for this sandwich, and as I took my first bite, the honey mustard hit first, followed by the salty coating of the chicken, then the creamy slaw and pickles.  The bun was really good and held up to the sandwich.  The flavors played well together, the chicken was hot and moist with that crispy exterior, and the side salad cooled my mouth down, complimenting the sandwich far better than fries would.

Despite the positive experience with this sandwich, I am shocked that it's one of the best fried chicken sandwiches in Vegas.  I understand that the texture and flavor profile are great, but this sandwich did not leave me satisfied the way I expected to be, and I wasn't head over heels in love with it.  I give them kudos for great flavors and textures, but I cannot say that this was the best fried chicken sandwich in town.  It is in the top 5, but not in my top 3.

The day after eating this, I didn't crave it again or believe that Honey Salt would be a regular trip for me.  Although they have a great cocktail and food menu, I felt as if I didn't belong.  That, and the food wasn't good enough for me to become a regular and true fanatic.  Still, it was an enjoyable lunch and I wouldn't adamantly stop anyone from eating there. I would, however, suggest KFC or Chik-Fil-A for a chicken sandwich over this $14 one.

Happy eating.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,5,3,3,EHXV1WpX-BFmpQ72D4TYog

The patio is beautiful, but it was a little too cold and windy. The inside decor is decorated with soft warm colors and old farm style tables and chairs. The ambiance is perfect and fits the farm to table theme perfectly. 

     We were sat inside and greeted by a friendly and knowledgable server (I love their uniforms)!! Bread and water were brought to the table (everyone went nuts for the homemade butter). I couldn't eat it being vegan...but we ordered quite a bit of food... So I was glad I was able to save some room! 

     I ordered the Cabernet, and it was an excellent choice. My boyfriend and I split the vegetable pizza (vegan), the grain power salad (vegan), the broccolini (vegan), and the cauliflower which came out on accident (vegan). The grain power salad was unbelievable!!! It was so delicious! The flavors and textures were amazing and it's a dish we will definitely order again. The veggie pizza... It was really really good. The sauce wasn't over powering and veggie selection on the pizza was perfect... Just needed more mushrooms :). The broccolini was very simple but Cooked perfectly, I probably will ask for sautéed garlic next time. The cauliflower... My least favorite. It was really just okay. We didn't order it, it came out on accident and they just let the table keep it (nice touch). It was good, just prepared too simple for cauliflower. 

     The service was impressive. They stayed on top of the table and made sure everything was done right. Everyone was super nice and accommodating.

3038627,2013-03-23,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt  - lives up to the hype, or at least, in my opinion. : )

Ordered: NY Strip Steak with yogurt creamed spinach, ""my wife's favorite salad"", and the turkey meatball flatbread.  

What I would recommend: The NY Strip Steak and ""my wife's favorite salad""

I did quite a bit of research on this restaurant before going, so I would like to believe my expectations were very high.  The restaurant is smaller than I imagined it to be, and a little nosier than I would have liked.  

The service was very attentive when refilling our drinks (never refilling too soon, nor too late).  The energy is lively and fun.  I really wanted to try the chicken sandwich, however, we went to dinner, so I settled on the turkey meatball flatbread and my guest got the NY Strip Steak (highly recommended).  

The steak was perfectly cooked and possibly one of the best $30.00 steaks I've ever tasted.  

I asked the waitress which salad she recommended so she responded, ""my wife's favorite salad"" The salad includes a duck confit, pomegranate, and a perfectly cooked poached egg.  At first I was somewhat skeptical to order this salad, since I did not know how well the flavors were going to mix.  But oohhhhh boy, I was glad the waitress recommended it.  DELISH! 

The tables are somewhat close to each other (especially if you sit in the booths), but other than that it was comfortable.

Now... One of my favorite parts to the restaurant was when our bill came to the table.  Each waitress carries a guest book with them and presents it with the bill.  Anything from love notes, small drawings, and thank you letters can be found in it.  I think it's a pretty cute idea, personally.  : )

If you have not been, Honey Salt is definitely worth going to.  The bill for two came to about $75.00 for apps, entrees, and drinks. A breath of fresh air for Vegas, and for that - I'll be back.",-PUQqO7rbjmdQ0KwYcbGAg,2,1,4,pO8R6Zd3luev4o7btDbv_g

They have a full bar that is operated by mixologists, so the cocktails are always great. They also have an acceptable wine list but I wouldn't go as far to say their wine is tended by a true sommelier, but they don't claim it is so no knocks there. 

The interior decoration is very unique, cool and light. I'll call it ""rural hamptons summer cottage"". The eclectic decor makes it feel very casual and comfortable. I think in the evening rock a blazer over a tshirt, during the day shorts and flip flops should be good to go. 

I'm docking a star because when I've gone the wait staff has been truly slow. I think it might be that their hiring apathetic college kids that feel ""above"" the wait position. They're friendly enough and genuine human beings, but there is no hop to their step, and you can sense a certain apathy towards their  position. I actually saw a manager confront our waitress discreetly, and direct her to get us our check ASAP. On one hand it was cool the manager noticed how long we were sitting there waiting, on the other, for the price it was lame we had a ineffective server. We waited on simple stuff like our menus and water after we were seated, and check ins were few and far between. 

If you don't mind a leisurely wait. This is a must try Summerlin dining experience. If you do entrees and cocktails for two (at least a couple drinks/person), budget $100+. Definitely do not miss this!",ao1mBK2Wvwd-L0FiyC_lKw,0,0,4,kSeUa8aUfyOdJPArtwHIzA

I loved their decor, plates and glasses. I made reservations and after checking in my party of 7 got seated in about 5 minutes. I also love any restaurant with an open kitchen! This way I have an eye on how my food is being prepared. I also appreciate a simple menu. Some restaurants have pages and pages of selections but here at Honey Salt it is simply all on one page and easy to read. My waiter Riki & his helper Tuval? were both super helpful and friendly. I would recommend Riki as your waiter. 

Tonight the special was 4 piece mix white and dark meat fried chicken. Honestly this was the best fried chicken I've had anywhere! Super moist and tender and its rare that a breast is tender. Usually this part of the chicken is cooked well and dry but here at Honey Salt they have perfected it! 

I personally had the 8oz Filet cooked Medium for $32. This price is much more comfortable then when you go to a steak house and they charge you $50! My steak was cooked perfectly and tasted awesome! One thing I regret is substituting my hash for rice. Being Asian and from Hawaii, I need rice! with everything! period. I was able to taste the hash on my dad's plate which tasted really good.

My sister ordered the baked chicken served with broccoli and mac & cheese? She didn't care for it but I loved it. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The mac & cheese also surprised me because it was really good. 

For dessert I had the Brooklyn something? It was a chocolate chip cookie on top of a brownie and finished off with Vanilla ice cream on top. It came out warm but the cookie was still crunchy! I was in heaven! The Triple strawberry shortcake had freshly sliced strawberries, strawberry ice cream and there was another layer to make it the ""triple"" but I forgot what it was. I think it was whipped cream or vanilla ice cream I couldn't really tell. 

(Reason for minus one star) My only complaint is the $8 price tag on their Fiji water, and I ordered 3 bottles of this! I mean, seriously!? $24 for 3 bottles of water!? Honey Salt, I love you but please reconsider your mark up on the water.. Thinking back about this now just makes me upset and I wished I would've asked to speak to a manager. $8 for a bottle of water is just ridiculous! On their food menu it says $4 but when I asked Riki he said the $4 price tag is for a different bottle of water and that because I got the Fiji water instead. I guess being from Hawaii we are spoiled with tap water.

Besides my bottled water misfortune, I still enjoyed the last meal of my vacation. They say Las Vegas is the 9th Hawaiian Island so you can bet I'll be back. I look forward to coming back to Honey Salt and I highly recommend this little gem. Make the drive away from the strip! You won't be disappointed!",L4eJCq5P-bZrtnNeyHFp5Q,1,1,4,CUnhZePKSZ9x1ZGU7BZKkw

I can tell that the Chef (owner) is passionate about high-quality, sustainable food with cleaner ingredients...which is important for someone like me with allergies AND prefers to leave the garbage out of my meals...I must know EXACTLY what's in my food....not your secret recipe, but the ingredients for sure! The eggs benedict with the fresh from Denver smoked in house Salmon is my favorite! The breakfast potatoes are freshly cut potatoes (not the icky frozen junk) and worth the $5 up charge for a side. According to the staff.....real freshly cracked organic eggs are used in all of their egg dishes. Our brunch for two usually runs in the $40-$50 range (drinks included), but again worth every penny......attention to detail in the kitchen is a wee bit off at busy times, but be patient as they will work to get it right for you. I'm in deep like with this one :)",lbomijqM_BT-6mtBaFyGWw,1,1,5,o_PaRwqKypVn2QNPhyxYDw

3167822,2013-11-23,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I think Honey Salt was one of my first bookmarks and it took us forever to come by. We came for dinner and honestly, it felt a lot more ""fancy"" then I thought it would be. Maybe it's different for lunch? I don't know. Either way, the decor is pretty cool...a wall of mirrors and the bathrooms covered in baseball cards! That's friggin' awesome!

So, this is my fault for not checking but I was bummed to see that the fried chicken sandwich is a lunch item only.  Instead I went with the meatball pizza which was surprisingly good. The turkey meatballs were hand made and the horseradish shavings topping it were delicious. My wife had the brick oven chicken which was also really tasty but I thought it was a tad overcooked. They serve it almost like in a bowl with natural jus that really sets the flavor off. I didn't get to try the mac n cheese served with it but she was in love with it. Our waiter suggested a Brookie for dessert which was also really good. The brownie and cookie were both super soft and the salted caramel ice cream is awesome.

Everything sounds good right? Well the food was easily 4 stars and the service would have gotten 4 if we wouldn't have been here 2 hours. We got seated fast and the waiter came out quick to get drinks then it all fell apart. About 40 minutes after we order, our foods nowhere to be found and our waiter comes out to tell us a mistake was made and our order didn't even get put in. From there, it took another 25 minutes for our food to come. Our waiter was super apologetic and even comped us the dessert but waiting over an hour for food is just crazy.

3171999,2018-01-06,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Just the right combo of delicious dishes and groovy atmosphere. You're not likely to find many restaurants in the area that are as nice. It is more a casual dining experience than a place where individual dishes are stellar. The food is very good, very comforting, and my biggest complaint is only that it is lacking in seasoning at times (Salt, of all things). Think of this as bumped up comfort food with little twists. And I mean this in the very nicest way.

This is for a recent lunch we had here: I love chunky, crispy grilled cheese sandwiches, and they've got them here in spades. The accompanying soup did somewhat resemble baby food (but all pureed soups tend to have this against them). The flat breads items are mostly little pizzas packed with toppings and flavor. I like the addition of pomegranate seeds on the one we had. A filling lunch to be sure. 

I find this to be one of those solid 4,5's that just needs a little extra to get it to perfect, but not quite there yet. Our opinion of the food is that it is the area they can improve on the most. The interior is very smartly laid out in a design sense, so no problem there. I do agree that the serving staff is spread a bit thin. Our server doubled as bartender and that did give us a hiccup on the speed of service.

The decor was nice and cozy. 

While we were waiting at the bar for our table, the bartender recommended to  try their sea scallops or the herbed chicken for main entree. He also noted to try the calamari.

So we did try 2 out of 3 recommendations and ended up somewhat disappointed. The calamari appetizer was soaked in oil and the breading was not even crispy. My bf said the calamari was even undercooked. For the main entree, I ordered the sea scallops which were good but needs a little more salt. The scallops were tender and juicy but my bf said again that it was slightly undercooked. I didn't notice it since I was so hungry and just ate it. It came with some cauliflower purée and roasted cauliflowers. My bf ordered the Red Snapper filet which he said was okay. He didn't like the veggies that came with the dish, 2 pieces of snap peas and 4 pieces of pickled eggplant. He said it was an odd combination.

Service was okay. I think their dishes are over priced. The food was okay-good but nothing special.

Started at the bar for one of the amazing drinks, the bar tender was inattentive although there was only one other couple there, didn't acknowledge us for quite some time.
When we were seated to eat, no one came to acknowledge us for a very loooong time, finally after awhile they brought water but the waitress didn't 'pop over' and no one offered to open our wine for at least 10 min...the restaurant was not busy so that couldn't have been the reason.
I ordered the Big Eye Tuna Tartare which was AMAZING and the Sea Bass which was so delicious and tasty that when it was gone I wished there was more!
My friends both ordered the tasting menu which included the entree of the Waygu Steak but the waitress didn't ask how they wanted it cooked.  One came perfectly med rare, the other well done and then we couldn't find anyone to come back to fix it!  I was waiving my arm in the air and a waiter walked RIGHT BY the table!  Another waiter (not ours) did come to our rescue and fixed it quickly and while later our waitress finally showed up to see how we were doing.
And no one payed attention to our wine glasses being empty so I reached into the bucket to get our bottle and pour when one of the busboys came over and did it.
After dessert we sat and sat and sat and sat waiting for the waitress to come back so we could request the check...
Service was totally inattentive...and although we enjoy spending a relaxing evening we felt ignored and the time lapses were much too long and inexcusable for a restaurant of this caliber that WAS NOT busy!

I went with one other person for dinner and had an experience that made sure I won't be going back. When I called to make a reservation at 7, they said they could only accept at 645. No problem, just found it interesting how vacant it was inside throughout the time we were there. Once we were seated, the server was not attentive. The bean soup lacked flavor, the pork ragú was not a cohesive dish, and the chicken didn't match the description on the menu. The person who brought out the dish was rude when we asked why the description didn't match the plate. Also, the pasta under the chicken had a unidentifiable kick that was not addressed on the menu. 

Waiting for someone to check on us so we could get the bill took 15 minutes. Finally we were able to reach the bus person who was helpful and the manager brought over the bill. He apologized and offered to bring out a brownie when all we wanted to do was leave.

3237197,2013-03-14,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I can sort of understand why Honey Salt is so popular, its an upscale yet casual place which Vegas is seriously lacking off strip. While I commend the owners independent spirit, my problem with Honey Salt is that it just wasn't very good. Spending over $300 (with tax and tip) for a party of four we'd expect to have an amazing meal to brag about and believe me I love talking about great experiences. 

To start we'd never been to Honey Salt before so we asked to be walked through the menu, the concepts and what Honey Salt is all about. Our waiter seemed nervous and was quite scattered in his explanations.  He was attentive through out our meal, as well as his assistant, he never really relaxed around us. 

Here is the run down on the food me and the Mr shared (laundry list style)..

Steak Tartare was the best dish from what the Mr and I ordered. Nice portion size but suffered from being under seasoned. I mean you'd think a restaurant that has the word salt in the name would at the very least use it.

My Wife's Favorite Salad sounded great but there wasn't a single piece of arugula on the plate, just tons of frisée. Meanwhile the duck tasted kind of off, not that it was bad, just tasted like it had been in the fridge to long. Im super sensitive to that flavor and usually send it back but the Mr said it fine. 

Margherita Pizza had a great crust.. crispy and light while remaining chewy and toothsome this was pretty good. Again great ingredients but lacked seasoning, namely salt! 

Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken was sort of my fault. I had read so many great things about it so I may have had to high of expectations. So when the plate was put in front of me my expectation turned to disappointment. When you order a chicken off the menu and it costs $23 you'd expect more than a single breast. I guess I should have looked at the pics first. Then further disappointment struck when I tasted it, no fucking salt! The skin was not crisp nor the flesh tender and moist. For me this was the most disappointing dish of them all. 

Cookie plate was for dessert and all 3 cookies were moist and chewy. My favorite was the brown butter chocolate chip cookie. Lots of chocolate and had that light cookie crunch connected to a chewy center, just needed and ice cold glass of milk and I would have been in a cookie coma! 

I know Im in the minority with my review of Honey Salt and I hope to return one day to see if we have a different experience but it'll be a while.",p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,6,3,2,rCrGPxwczwxCRg7uT10llQ

For starters it's water to give us time to review menu selections.  House water served in carafes and poured frequently for us, even though the carafe was in reach on our table.  

Still had about half an hour of happy hour left.  Basil blush cocktail struck my mood.  Made with gin, grapefruit juice and syrup, plus a leaf of basil.  Ginger mule with a cucumber slice for Ness.  Dominique let us order a double dose of happy hour drinks to beat the remaining half hour before it ends at 6pm.  It's a two for one basically.  That's why you gotta get here for HH.

Appetizers that will actually fill you up.  Check out the HH menu; pretty decent.  And that Margarita Pizza YESSSSS please!  A basil leaf for each pizza slice - how it should be too.  Aromatic and comfy food.

If you're a spicy type who wants a sweet thing for a partner, go with the buffalo cauliflower.  Roasted with sweet red bells that bite your tongue; complimented with blue cheese.  Have leftover blue cheese with the Biloxi chicken nuggets.  LipSmackaramazzz. :-)*

BROOKIE must have for you chocoholics!!! Brownie center melta-liciously good. Topped with some premium quality caramel chocolate - chocolate chip ice cream.  But the chips IN this ice cream!!!  Let's just throw confetti and cheerfully applaude like a graduation ceremony! :D With a chocolate chip cookie resting in between like a spoiled loved and hugged up baby.

Dessert/ sweet dishes- 5 stars, 
food for brunch : 4 stars, 
ambience: 4 stars
Service: 5 stars

We came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch with reservation and yet there is still quite a 15- 20 min wait for the table.  So we end up just seating at the corner of the bar table with full menu service. We mostly ordered egg Benedict, the billoxi chicken sandwich and a bread pudding to share. I have to say the savory is alright but not blown my mine good with the high expecting after the reviews I read. But the sweets are really exceptionally good and took me by a surprised. Since the food took quite awhile (like over 30 min wait) we are also comp with a monkey bread that also brought excitement before starting all the dishes.

Monkey bread- it's sort of like cinnamon bun but better and drizzle over with heavenly melty salted caramel. Oh that scene is just breathtaking for me. I am still trying to savor it while writing this review. 
The bread pudding- it's sort of like the monkey bread, but with a great hot and cold sensation from the very well chilled ice cream and blazing hot bread pudding. Most places don't get the ice cream cold enough to get the great contrast. But you got to eat it quick before it all get melted. And I love how they uses smells throughout the restaurant to give you the "" honey salt"" experience. You will greet with the senses of honey or maple once you entered and when you are out of the restroom ( they also use a honey or vanilla smell of handwash) I thought its a very clever touch for the experience.

Service was great too. The guy by the bar made my friend some special drink and promise if she doesn't like it, he will re-make it for her. So the overall experience is memoriable.

The service was perfect, my water was never empty the timing and delivery on courses was perfect and even though it was a busy Saturday night they didn't rush us  out the door. 
The ambiance is beyond warm and charming. A little East Coast Hamptons meets Napa. As a native Portland Oregon'er I was excited to see that the bar had the Blazer Basketball game on and I had a birds eye view from my seat..They lost in overtime but I will save that rant for another blog. 

Anyway, if you are looking to get away from the strip and cozy down for classy yet casual evening MAKE A RESERVATION at Honey Salt...You only live once so make sure to order the damn Brown Bag Apple Pie.

3264949,2014-04-21,6,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Came in today for Sunday dinner. Greeted and seated immediately at the table with the  couch by the restrooms(one of my pet peeves ). 
I feel like we didn't get enough attention compare to the other tables our server had. I did come in work out clothes, socks and slippers. But that shouldn't explain the poor service. 

Ok let's talk about it-
got seated and they dropped off 2 water glasses with no ice and a vase of water. I guess they don't like their water cold here. So I asked if we can have ice with our water and he comes back with 1 glass of ice, so my girl and I shared this one glass of ice water our whole dinner. So dinner..

We ordered:
-New England fry
-kurobota pork chops 
-scallops
-asparagus
-Mac n cheese
-kids chicken & fries 
-garden mule (cocktail)
-Brookie (dessert)
-Dutch chocolate ice cream

let's start with the New England fry. It was basically fried calamari and whole bellied clams. It was good but nothing spectacular. The batter didn't adhere to the seafood well.

We ordered a garden mule to share since we just went bar hopping last night..one drink won't hurt right? We weren't very fond of it. she chugged it so she wouldn't taste it lol. 

Entrees: 
Lady ordered scallops with cauliflower purée and greens. We both liked this dish. Seasoned well and plated beautifully. I had the kurobota pork chops which were pretty bland and it didn't help that it was dry either. I had to ask for more sauce but even that took forever because our server was never around. the only good thing on that plate was the slaw but that's not the reason I paid $27. I was unhappy with my entree and match it with neglected service, it was pretty much downhill. 
We also had Mac n cheese and asparagus as side items and both were pretty tasty. 

Dessert:
'Brookie' brownie and cookie combo topped off with salted caramel chunk ice cream. Sounds good enough right? while, the idea is good...the execution could've been better. the brook was a lil hard. I was expecting moist and soft. That salted caramel ice cream is to die for! Best thing I had tonight other than our one & only glass of ice water. 

Our dinner wasn't crazy expensive but at that price point..I'd expect more attentive service and staff actually coming around more often checking on us, filling our water. Instead of dropping off a pitcher & food and not see a server til check time.

For our first course we had the Burrata and Heirloon Tomato salad and the Elizabeth's Caesar.  The tomato salad was pretty good, the Burrata was a lot creamier than a regular buffalo mozzarella, which I am used to.  It took a minute to get used to the texture but overall, a good version of a caprese salad.  The Elizabeth's Caesar was very lightly dressed.  Much to our disappointment.  If ordered again I would ask for extra dressing on the side. 
As for entree's we recommend the Caramelized Sea Scallops.  Perfectly cooked and the cauliflower two different ways (charred and pureed with vanilla bean) was a great accompaniment.  
For dessert we ordered their signature ""Brookie.""  Basically a chocolate chip cookie pie with brownie filling.  Served along a salted caramel ice cream, this dessert is worth the trip to Summerlin.  Their bread and cocktail selection is also very good. 
As for service, our waiter was nice.  However not very attentive.  Never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks until we were completely dry.  We would have gotten another if he came around quicker.",dnTutCg2Prv02RkQedU7qQ,2,1,4,yBB5Gf-atOGYKI-cfey44w

The grilled cheese was out of this world. I think they used  gruyere cheese and another blend and it was so amazing (that was probably my fav)

I went against my Yelp instincts and ordered something that didn't get a lot of reviews - a Waygu burger. It's one of those basic things that any restaurant should master but I was in for a major disappointment. Medium rare turned out to be well done; bacon jam... where's the bacon jam?; the burger was bland and tasteless. As for the service, I had to ask for ketchup three times before finally getting it 15 mins later. And we waited for 30+ min for our meal to arrive. Nice.

Others ordered a chicken sandwich which they said was good (it is also highly rated on Yelp).

I came here for my birthday lunch after deciding The Strip wasn't an option and I was craving my favorite salad for a healthy start to the day.

Man-friend ordered the chicken sandwich which is our thing wherever we go, and this one really disappointed. It had the texture of a cafeteria chicken sandwich and overall was very lackluster.

I'm pleased to say that after spending brunch there today, I can definitely say it lives up to that expectation. Fantastic service from beginning to end. We must have stopped by at the perfect time on a Saturday morning because there was absolutely no wait for a table. 

I opted for bottomless mimosas; tried out the Bellini & blood orange - both good - however, I preferred the latter. We shared the monkey bread as an ""appetizer"" - it was fantastic and a must try. I ordered the Nutella French toast; it was recommended by our server and she did not let me down! My boyfriend ordered the weekend frittata with grilled chicken added. It was light and fluffy, very tasty. 

Overall, it was a fantastic brunch and I would recommend trying it out.

I'd like to say- this place usually rocks, and the wait staff is friendly. I love this place for special occasions... but visiting on a random afternoon? A few factors bummed me out. The busboy was more attentive than our waiter. There were ZERO other people in the establishment (not counting the bar). We ordered a sorbet for dessert and it was placed down ROCK HARD... it was so obvious the waiter even said something about it. He said he'd soften it... but at that point it was unappetizing. Then, I asked for some honey butter to go- because it's amazing- and he didn't bother with it after saying yes. I chose not to remind him, because it's not like he had a lot of other things keeping his mind occupied in a mostly empty restaurant. Spending $75 on a lunch should at least warrant following through with requests.

Overall, Honey Salt delivers with food quality... the sea scallops are amazing... and when it's hopping, I've had zero issue. It's odd that the service went down on an off time.",-on2hNUiASICH9wlylxR8w,0,0,4,pKEdhXohKQ1Qe0uONGpBwA

I spent several hours looking for a quiet place with good food that was OFF the strip.  I'm am in Vegas visiting while my boyfriend works.  I'm pretty big into fitness and eating REAL FOOD which (if you've ever visited Vegas before you know) it's pretty hard to find along the strip.  

Honey Salt is an adorable place hidden in the corner of a shopping mall in a nice part of town.  They have an awesome hipster vibe with a gorgeous brick wall on one side and a wall with mirrors of different sizes scatted around.

We started with the salt and pepper fries.  They are just regular fries, nothing too crazy about them (they are good).  I know this is weird, but my boyfriend and I dipped them in the honey butter that they serve with the bread.  So good having a mix of salt and sweet!

I had the special that day, braised lamb with chickpeas and carrots.  Simply amazing.  A perfect blend of flavor and spices.  My boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna entree. It looked delish, but a little small.

Finishing the night out we had the peach pie with coffee. Can't say enough about it.  Fresh, yummy... you've gotta try it!

My friend and I shared an order of turkey meatballs (6 pieces) and they were tasty. However, my entree, a chili rub pork tenderloin, was overcooked, so the pork tasted a bit dry. My friend ordered a brick oven chicken breast and it was also overcooked and dry. 

I actually liked the sides (shaved brussel sprouts, grilled pears, and fig mostarda) that the pork came with. The fig mostarda was especially delicious. The brussel sprouts gave the dish that crunch factor. Had the pork not been overcooked, this would've been a really good dish.

I still like the place overall. Love the set up and the decor. Good ambience. Good service. Convenient to get to. Plenty of parking. If you've never been and you're in the area, it's worth giving them a try, but I wouldn't make a special drive just to eat here. There are plenty of other good American restaurants in town.

Food: 2/5
Their quinoa salad was amazing: Light, refreshing, and fluffy. Everything after was average or lackluster. Their burger was balanced, but the chicken was reminiscent of Jack. Thin meat, not particularly tender, no juice. Bun was good, but average for a gourmet burger. The salad might have saved the meal, but the cheese chunks were cloying. Key Lime pie was too tart: I felt the top of my nose slightly sweet. 

Value: 2/5
To the owner's benefit, I appreciate their participation in Restaurant Week to benefit charity. That kindness is not being disputed in this review. What is being disputed, though, is if I will come back here regularly. At the price point of $30 per person, I have had friendly and attentive service, balanced flavor profiles with rare ingredients, and pleasant memories elsewhere for American upscale casual. Especially since the regular menu adds up more, this actually further decreases value. 

Mood and Stomach after the meal: Hmph.

The food is good, not great. Maybe my expectations were too high. 

The good:
- lemon chicken salad 
- margarita flat bread
- chicken sandwich (comes with a good caesar salad)

Not good:
- burger
- turkey meatball
- apple pie

If you want to try this place, Monday is a good time to come. There is a salmon and chicken dish I wanted to try but it's only available for dinner. I recommend coming for dinner on a Monday.

I was outside since I brought my dog with me. The employees were really nice and accommodating. They brought a bowl of water for my dog.

We got the gnocchi and the grilled chicken. Two separate entrees. The gnocchi was good. It was my first time tasting it and I thought the sauce was good. It was the right size. I don't really like soft textures like that but it was bearable because of the size. The grilled chicken was so good. It was juicy and the flavors were great. It wasn't overdone or anything. It tasted just right.

The servers were great. They were really attentive and nice. I definitely recommend this place. I don't know if they rotate their menu though because last time I was there, I had a burger but they didn't have any burgers this time.",9k2et25tG8kSj9Q3hqj9xA,0,0,4,9blt8mul-Zas4xnvoAMpJQ

July's Review: We were all dressed up to celebrate our fourth anniversary together and this year, I had my boyfriend decide where to eat while I decide what we do. Per my review at the VooDoo Zipline, you can tell we definitely had a fun anniversary activity! (Again, thank you fellow Yelpers for your suggestions!) My boyfriend and I ordered some appetizers alongside our main dish and I appreciate that they came out little by little; if we were bombarded with a table full of food I don't know what I'd do lol. While we sat and waited for our food to arrive, we were given a small basket of bread and I'm not sure what kind of butter they use or what they put in their butter, but it made a simple piece of toast taste like HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. When we finished eating, our server knew it was our anniversary, so he came out with a small plate of cute little muffins and across the plate, written in chocolate, said ""Happy Anniversary"" It was perfect. Just before leaving, as it was time to pay, they handed us our check tucked inside a journal and I saw so many entries from couples, families, etc and so I decided to leave a cute little message too. Very unique!

October's Review: We dressed casually this time, both hungry for something delicious and since we both liked eating here and liked the service and the ambiance, we opted for something we were familiar with. It was nice and cool out so I was finally able to wear some of my fall/winter clothes (can I get a hellll yeaaaaah?!) and because of how good it felt outside, we dined out at their front patio. The dim Christmas-y type lights that were strung above us created something that felt just a little intimate. It's all about ambiance! I'm not sure if their menu changes every once in a while but the menu looked like it had made a few changes on their dinner dishes. I chose the Salmon dish (I forgot the name) and let me tell you, IT. WAS. ON. POINT. The chopped warm pears added to it took me by surprise but I quickly recovered when they just melted in my mouth. My boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon (I wanted to devour his food, but lucky for him, he stayed a good distance away) which he said tasted really good. Our food was cooked to perfection! It was a little chilly out, but our bellies were nice and warm. Once we were ready to pay, they handed us our check within the very same journal we were given before. I flipped through the pages to see if our very first entry was still there, and it was! This time Elmer wrote in it.

At Honey Salt, it is simply all on one page and easy to read. The decor, lighting, music, furniture and staff definitely makes the place. The food is just a bonus. 
We started out with fresh, organic juices. For our main dish, I ordered crab cake eggs Benedict (which by the way was delicious). My friend ordered corn beef hash.

We tried several items and I don't think we had a bad thing to say about any of our selections (most were recommended by our server Juan). 

From the appetizers we selected the Calamari, Meatballs, & Chicken tacos .. Out of the 3 MY fave were the meatballs .. My friends really enjoyed the tacos. 

For our entrees we selected the Biloxi fried chicken sandwich, the Tuna seared ahi salad, the sausage pasta (don't remember the actual name) and the mac and cheese..Out of the four I had two faves, the mac and cheese (which I don't think I mentioned has Kale! and the sausage pasta!)

I had the salmon. It came with crunch artichoke hearts, israeli cous cous, and a pesto. It was refreshing and delicious. The best salmon I've ever had, by far.

My husband had the flat iron and was not disappointed, either. It wasn't a strip steak, mind you, but it delivered. It was tender, and accompanied by smashed potatoes. YUM.

We shared a side of mac n cheese, and it was by far the best mac and cheese I've had in my lifetime.

The BEST part, however, was dessert. We tried a brookie, and we scarfed it down so fast, I probably could have eaten two more of them. I'm going to have dreams about the brookie. It was to die for. I know I say that about everything, but I'm serious this time. I could die and go to heaven and only want a brookie for every meal for the rest of my life.


Next date night we are going to try the sister restaurant in Tivoli, Made.

He then babysat our meals in the kitchen and delivered them to us personally. After he brought us our food, he returned often to check on us.

3455214,2014-03-16,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"This review is for their Spring 2014 Las Vegas Restaurant Week Menu. 

Almost everyone whom I've spoken to has raved about the food at this Summerlin restaurant. Now, I can finally add my say to its long list of accolades. 

Appetizer - Elizabeth's Caesar Salad: A basic but pleasant starter to dinner. The salad was lightly dressed with black garlic dressing and parmesan cheese, and garnished with a puffy chickpea chip, which my friends and I wished were sold in bags at the restaurant. 

Main Course - Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast: Moist and tender, the chicken breast laid upon a bed of mac and cheese with kale and Anaheim peppers. The downside of this course was the saltiness of the mac a cheese. I tasted random patches saltiness in mine; whereas, my friend's was consistent. Another friend ordered the Caramelized Sea Scallops that was buttery, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I hate to say it, but I should've ordered that instead. Though, don't get me wrong, the chicken and mac were good. 

Dessert - Brown Bag Baked Apple Pie: This one of Honey Salt's signature desserts. It's absolutely delightful tasting, and it pairs well with the scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. 

Service - Not bad. Our waiter was on top of it even as business picked up --  I would suggest making reservations no matter what  time of day you decide on visiting. 

Overall - This is my new Summerlin dining spot. With a variety of appetizing menu options, as well as a Sunday brunch feature, how could I not come back?",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,3,4,uNsuwhAUw7DwvrcyK9lK4Q

What finally made me cave and try it? I saw an article on some local news site about their grilled cheese. They use Barely Buzzed cheddar which is cheddar cheese rubbed with espresso and lavender and a gooey truffle spread. I saw this sandwich and knew immediately that I had to eat it for lunch, so I made reservations for this afternoon and IT WAS AWESOME.

My husband and I also shared the tuna tartare, which was super fresh and tasty and delicious. I am a sucker for any mixture of raw fish and avocado. The crisp flatbread they serve to start was very nice, too.

The not-so-great: service was a liiiitle slow and my jalapeno bloody mary was TINY for a $10 drink (though tasty).

3517497,2012-11-24,5,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"If Honey Salt is supposed to give people a glimpse into the culinary home life of owners Elizabeth Blau and Kim Canteenwalla (as mentioned in an article in Las Vegas Citylife) then I'm hoping they'll adopt me so I can experience that culinary excellence on a daily basis.

The tuna tartar ($15; ginger, cilantro, soy, lime, crunchy quinoa) was strip-quality delicious. The burrata, rosso bruno and teardrop tomatoes salad ($15; figs, basil, blood orange balsamic, extra virgin olive oil) was tasty and fresh, as well. The portion size was plenty big to share.

The wife and I split the filet ($32; potato bacon hash, roasted anaheim salsa, house steak sauce). Much cheaper than a filet on the Strip, it was a perfectly cooked filet that was as tender as expected. It was sitting on top of a crispy hash and surrounded by a wonderful sauce. The salsa that accompanied the dish gave it some bold flavors and earthy notes without taking anything away from the beefiness of the steak.

Our kid had the kid's cheese pizza ($8). The chewy and airy crust was delicious. But, the elongated look typical of flatbreads made him pause and question if it was really a pizza. He's picky and suspicious like that.

Desserts were excellent as well. The toffee sauce made the bread pudding ($9) a hit. It was so warm and comforting, it was like giving a big bear hug to your stomach. I'm a sucker for pumpkin cheesecake ($9; toasted butter pecan crust, salted caramel, spiced pumpkin seeds) and this sweet and creamy version didn't disappoint. The petite size of the dish was perfect for one person. The kid went with the ""Grow-your-own-sundae"" ($5). It's a great interactive dish for little ones with Oreo ""dirt"" that they get to sprinkle on to their ice cream. Gummie worms and candy rocks are included on the plate to add into the mix. A tiny bottle of chocolate sauce is also a part of the dish. It can get a bit messy, but kids will love it. Mine sure did.

The low point of the meal was the service. It looked like our waiter was working another section of the restaurant and was also given our table (in the section closest to the restrooms). Unfortunately, it felt like we were an afterthought. 15 minutes to get drinks. Almost half an hour for our kid to get a lemonade. Long periods of time between courses. Slow to get additional drinks, the check, to pay for the check, etc.

Elizabeth Blau did stop by to ask how we were doing and she was great. Obviously, she's a pro at this and when we mentioned our issues she listened without getting defensive and did what she could to correct the problems -- making sure our next round of drinks were promptly delivered, sending the manager over to speak with us as well, and getting the sundae for my kid. Having an owner that cares about the customer makes me hope that service issues will be corrected in the future. Our visit was the second or third week they were open, after all.

I love that the place is kid-friendly but still cool enough for date nights or adults-only get togethers. Summerlin and the west side definitely needed a spot like this. There's no doubt we'll be back, unless the owners decide to take me (and my family) in. Then we'll be eating at home (their home) all the time.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,13,7,4,9OddcvtEOaZzdqJyIQkuvQ
3519825,2013-05-19,13,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"A fellow yelper suggested this place for lunch and I had been wanting to try it so she made reservations for us. At first when I walked in I noticed they were packed so was glad a reservation was made. I was seated at a half booth half chair type of table. I never mind these but in this instance I felt cramped. It kinda seemed like a space that was left over and they decided to cram 2 more seats into a corner. If the table were larger it would have made a better difference. I just know next time to request a different table since this one seemed like the only one like it.

The lunch menu was short and simple but had something for everyone. I decided to order the ""Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese"" that was accompanied by a cup of ""Crushed Pea Soup w/Bacon Lardons"" priced at $13. I was so pleased with it! The sandwich had such great flavor and I kept wanting more. The pea soup was simply delicious. I can't say enough about how much I liked this and I will for sure be back to order it again! The server was nice and kept checking on our drinks and how we were doing.

They have daily specials and I noticed they offer a kids menu. Some places offer you a mint or root beer candy when leaving but Honey Salt had salt water taffy! There is a fun guestbook before the hostess stand you can sign. If you feel like eating at the bar you can sit there and order from the menu as well but if there are any happy hour specials I didn't see any posted but there is a TV.

First, our Greeter. He was pleasant. He was quick. He was brief. He was almost too brief because it felt like he took us to our table and left. However, never rude just brief.
Our Server, she was AWESOME! She made the whole experience to be GREAT!! She was attentive, she was quick, she was pleasant, she was interactive and she was funny and fun!
Now for the edibles. I ordered the sea bass and it was very good; notice that I didn't say great? It was just very good. Presentation was good. Prepared perfectly. Seasoned perfectly. The brussel sprouts were on point along with the bacon in it. And although I like onions, the pearl onions in the dish were a bit much; this would be my only negative part of this review. Now, the chicken noodle soup was actually the BEST part of my meal. It was PERFECT! 
Some may believe this write up is not a great one. Here's the thing, they have another restaurant called MadeLV and I actually like their food MUCH better.

Caesar salad... Steak tartare.. Shrimp cocktail and bread pudding for dessert. Nothing else to wash it down but water 

Caesar - it was one of the better tasting caesar sald,, close to the made in front of your face at Bellagio's prime.
Tartare - excellent flavor. Great complimentary crunchy pita likr carb. Soaked up the  flavors.
Prawns - were huge. Five pieces in normal with a complimentary balanced cockrail sauce, not too tangy, not too radishy.
Bread Pudding - components put together. Delicatably warm, flavorful, comforting. Get a side of ice cream to go with it or extra cream.

Service was mediocre, but he seemed to be new. Food came out quickly, but the server was just getting a handle on things.

It is nestled in the corner of the shopping center on the NW corner of Rampart & Charleston where Nora's Wine Bar used to be. I love the decor and we always see many of the same staff which is comforting and a great sign of a successful business. We always feel welcome and they are always very accommodating with our two boys. The menu selection seems limited to me, so I usually end up getting the salmon every time. Shannon absolutely LOVES the chicken fried sandwich. And this is coming from someone who won't eat anything fried. I like the little touches of 'honey & salt' like butter served with the bread has honey & salt in it. And in the bathroom, the soap is made to seem like honey salt. The best part of the HS experience is the salted caramel ice cream. My personal favorite dessert is the apple pie in a bag, but they don't seem to have that anymore. Now they've replaced it with a peach pie in a bag and I'm not a fan of peach pie.

As you step inside, the atmosphere immediately sucks you in, so homey, a little bit of pintrest, and so inviting, great combo of color, wood, and stone in perfect harmony,
Honey Salt could easily make you feel like you were in Napa Valley wine country.
Mismatched chairs, random mirrors, chandeliers, and lamps placed along the banquettes(so comfy, makes you wanna grab one of the pillows and take a nappy-nap
after a fantabulous meal!) Check out the decor in the restrooms too-Sportscards and restaurant menus in the men's room, Hotel key cards in the women's room...total coolness. Love the Service staff attire too....Flannel looking collared  shirts, jeans, and Chuck Taylors? SWEET! Even Chef Kim Canteenwalla was rockin' jeans and chucks with his chef whites...Now that's what's up!

Lavash and Potato Rolls with white bean puree arrive as we place our orders, and wifey decides on the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich -Two crisp juicy chicken breasts with slaw and  honey mustard on a soft brioche bun served with Honey Salt's version of a chopped salad full of romaine, kale, carrots, white cheddar, radish, edamame, and avocado...a very good compliment to the very tasty sandwich that has been nicknamed ""Chik-Fil-A on crack"" (I never had CFA, so I wouldn't really know)

 I go with the Backyard Favorite Burger. A huge burger(ground from tri-tip, chuck, and shortrib) that protrudes outside the pilowy soft brioche bun topped with sweet tomato jam, butter lettuce, tomato, red onion, and beehive cheddar...only slight knock was that the fries weren't hot like they should be... Now this burger has got to be one of THE BEST in town, not only hands down, but hands, face and knees down, like bow down status! Simplicity at its finest and executed flawlessly. Order this bad boy medium rare and get that fried egg on top and you won't be disappointed!

Quality ingredients alone will draw me back here and  its not about quantity(quadruple bypass @ Heart Attack Grill anyone?) and the price point is not absolutely ridonkulous like on the strip ($50 for Carne Asada? What is it? Kobe Beef stuffed with Foie and Truffles???)

I had called and spoken to the hostess regrading their hours. I was not told that there was an ""in between menu"" beginning at 2:30. I was told that they served lunch beginnig at 11:30 and that dinner started at 5. Please note the website says they open at 10:30am, so this is confusing.

I drove 300 miles from West Los Angeles and arrived around 3:45, an hour after they stopped serving lunch.The manager was kind enough to let us order a sandwiche off of the lunch menu, however. The ""in-between"" menu is severely limited, although I did order the burger off of that menu.

We were seated and ordered. This is when the rude, inconsiderate and bad service began. The man that delivered our food who I believe was a manager just put the plates down. He didn't say anything. He just brusquely placed them on the table. I ordered a burger and wanted condiments, but he scurried off before I could ask for mayo. 

I had to flag down our server which took about five minutes. Meanwhile, my food was getting cold. One of my biggest pet peeves in restaurants is when I order a burger and then am not served condiments in a timely fashion.

Our server asked a busboy to bring mayo to the table. I swear that kid ran over to Whole Foods to buy a jar of Hellman's. It took several minutes to get the damn mayo!

Not once during the meal did our server come over to the table to see how everything was. We were not offered drink refills. He waited until we had cleared our plates and then came over and asked, ""Is everything okay?"" 

We chided him for not paying attention to the table. He tried to make up for the bad service by bringing two tiny brownies over. Too little too late.

To Honey Salt's credit the food was great. My companion had the Cubano Sandwich wich was exquisite. I had the burger which was excellent. We both had espresso which was very good.

I am giving this place two stars because the service was non-existent. I don't mind paying $14 for a cheeseburger, but I want decent service to go with it.",QyjgMm_MTCsjXefZAhY4Ew,4,2,2,ipgO8z6A8GGjjvZeQTePOA

My friend had the fried chicken sandwich and Caesar. We had to share. The food was so amazing. Reminds me of what a great place to eat is....
Funny how Vegas talks about hospitality and food and being from Charleston, SC I am usually disappointed but this place delivers ....even the hostess was awesome.  Kindness, genuine knowledge and love for the food and helpfulness. You know the staff likes working here and that feels good.
Other places in this city should bring their waitstaff and cooks in to learn from the quality that exists here. 
You cannot pass up on dessert either when you know you will be treated this well. It was mouth watering and we finished every bite, though we could of shared.

3674014,2018-05-28,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I came here for brunch yesterday, arrived exactly at 10:30 and were the first ones seated. I do wish this place was open a bit earlier for brunch, since I'm starving by the time 10:30 rolls around on the weekend. 

We had several of the dishes including the Breakfast Nachos, Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Prosciutto Pizza. My favorite amongst these was the Biloxi Fried Chicken Sandwich. What makes this Fried Chicken sandwich different and in some cases better than others comes down to the coleslaw topping, honey mustard sauce, and the Sweet Brioche Bun it comes on. The chicken itself was moist and not overly crispy, which I liked. Be careful since this sandwich does come with a lot of honey mustard sauce (which I like), but I know thats not for everyone. 

The breakfast nachos were good, but nothing spectacular. I did feel like the components of this dish could be integrated better together since most of the bites I had came with different toppings. I also think the nachos would be better with a poached egg, and I do think it should come with more cheese since mine were sparse. 

My least favorite dish was the Prosciutto Pizza, since the crust was too thick and overtook most of the pizza. Same like the breakfast nachos, I felt the toppings on this pizza were scattered sparsely around, and each bite I tasted something different. I just wish there were more toppings and less crust. 

I got the lemonade here, and I was disappointed to taste it wasn't homemade or fresh. My partner got an Iced Americano, and she really enjoyed it. Her words were ""it's really strong"". 

Honey Salt overall is a cute brunch location for the weekend, but I don't suggest coming here if you are looking to be blown away by the finesse of cuisine. Because of the great service, I'm giving this place a 4, but I would really like to see Honey Salt upgrade their menu.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,2,3,4,fMIuObd9_tmiIe8v5FPeZQ

I ordered the Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. I admit that I didn't know what Durkee's sauce was, but this was honey mustard sauce, plain and simple. According to Google, that's not what Durkee's sauce is. And I do not like honey mustard sauce,  anyway. Also the sandwich was so wet because of this sauce and the coleslaw that the brioche bun fell completely apart after picking it up and taking just one bite. Maybe a different bread/bun would work better.  Also, the chicken was very dry. I must say that the Caesars salad that came with the sandwich was excellent. My kids ordered pizza from the kids menu and they loved it. Another really good thing was the parmesan (I think) crackers that were brought to the table. We loved them! 

Our server was very friendly. He was very nice to my kids. But once our food arrived we had trouble getting him to come back to us. There were only maybe 4 other tables of people there, so it was not busy at all. He was busy talking to the other servers at the server station for a very long time. Then he was talking for awhile to the hostess. We even got to the point that I had my credit card in hand just waiting for him to come. Instead of bringing our check, he brought the dessert menu. I had been trying to wave at him for quite some time, our napkins were on the table, and we had our leftovers ready to go, but he brings the dessert menu? Nice guys do not necessarily make good servers.

3698123,2014-02-10,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I've never tried comfort food until I came here. I tried their truffle grilled cheese, and their ceasar salad for brunch. My oh my was it delish! I'm a big grilled sandwich person so trying this sandwich definitely had me impressed. Perfect consistency with the truffled cheese to the slices of bread. Their ceasar salad is EVERYTHING. If you're looking to have a nice salad, I'd recommend this salad. I'd also highly recommend their fried chicken sandwich. Most people go there to have that sandwich and having a bite....or two from my friend's, I would've cose this as my second choice if I had.

We also had their bottomless mimosas for $20 that day (every Sunday) with your choice of the classic orange juice and champagne or blood orange and champagne. Now, the blood orange mimosa is very tart so if you don't mind it I'd highly recommend it. That's all I was drinking for two hours. The servers were super attentive, ensuring our glasses of water...AND MIMOSAS were always full! Seeing as though they might not have been able to keep up with our thirst for mimosas, they were so kind to just send us a carafe to fill ourselves in case they could not get to us in time (NO JUDGING FROM THEM HERE!). They checked back at a decent rate maybe three times during our meal just to see if we were ok and carrying on a light and funny conversation. High five to the servers their and their guest services. Bottomless mimosas do come with a warning: THEY ARE CREEPERS, YOU MAY FEEL BRAVE TO DRINK A LOT OF IT, BUT I ASSURE YOU YOU'LL FEEL THE AFTER EFFECTS BY LATE AFTERNOON.

I was also impressed by the cleanliness and aesthetics of the bathroom (clean bathrooms are a big deal for me. 1. because it tells me how attentive the establishment is. 2. I like to get comfortable after a big meal.). They even had this nice salt scrub to soften your hands with which was very different from most bathrooms I've gone in. Love the salt scrub? No fears! They tell you exactly where you could purchase them. Brunch for 4 with 3 of us taking the bottomless mimosas we left at a tab of about $130 excluding tip and tax. Well worth it for a nice brunch with the girls, or in laws!

This is a great ""occasion"" restaurant that would be perfect for a date, anniversary dinner, or birthday dinner....I say ""occasion"" because it's got that price point that's just a step above normal/everyday restaurant, but not quite fine dining prices.  I wrestled with the prices all night because the entrees I think are fairly priced, but some of the other items like drinks and desserts, are insanely over priced.

DECOR: The decor is really simple and elegant.  This place so reminds me of the places I love in Hillcrest in San Diego.  It's got a ""down home farm chic"" feel to it.

DRINKS:  All 5 of us in our party got the Mosc-ito because we love us some ginger beer.  This drink is a cross between a Moscow Mule and a Mojito.  Very good, a bit sweet.  At $12, it is a pretty expensive cocktail.

FOOD: I got the turkey bolognese ($18) and enjoyed it immensely.  Really flavorful, a perfect portion so you weren't carb stuffed, and neat looking noodles.  Two of my friends got the Brick chicken with mac and cheese ($22), and they both ate every bite.  My other two friends shared a salad and a flatbread pizza.  The salad was tiny for the $9 price tag.

DESSERT: This gets its own section because the desserts here are amazing.  A little apple pie that comes in a paper bag, bread pudding, and the OH MY GOD salted caramel chocolate ice cream.  Here's my beef:  all the desserts are $9.  For a freshly baked to order pie - yes, fair.  For a bowl of homemade bread pudding - yes, fair.  But for 3 scoops of ice cream???? No, not fair.  You're telling me EACH SCOOP is $3???  It made me sad because the salted caramel chocolate ice cream was delicious, but I will probably never get it again because I refuse to spend $9 on ice cream.

THE BREAK DOWN: 

The Ambiance...
Immediately I went to the ladies room before ordering. A complete bias, but I love a salt scrub. It was an offering for use at the wash tub. Great touch. A sucker for service, I purchased a jar immediately. 
The decor is quaint. Country. Comfortable. Welcoming. And an odd juxtaposition from the outside strip mall. Though it kinda makes you forget the brash reality that VEGAS is just outside. 

The Food...
I had the turkey meatballs. Simple and straightforward yet extremely complex! It's not easy to achieve a perfectly moist turkey meatball while balancing the flavor with caramelized onion and the delicate flavors of ricotta. Well balanced and I would order again and again.

My mate ordered the filet Mignon medium rare. Conversely it arrived well over cooked. Being in the food service industry, you come to understand that what's most important is the recovery. Theirs was on the level of Waldorf/Ritz-Carlton. The over cooked steak was quickly carried away and soon replaced with a juicy well prepared better version of itself. It was delivered by the manager who apologized and stayed in wait until it met his approval. The pursuit of excellence!

While we didn't order dessert, we were offered two decadent brownie bites. I'm not much of a dessert gal but this I'd order and recommend. It was compact but offered a powerful punch. The perfect ending to any meal. 

I also enjoyed their version of a Moscow mule which was muddled with cucumber, basil and a few other things. Perfection!

what i ate:
- corn soup: creamy sweet corn soup, I'd definitely suggest this as a starter. it wasnt too creamy, there was some texture. and the flavor was pitch perfect, not too sweet, not too salty, not bland at all. 
- casear salad: my friend raved about this salad and after having a bit I could see why. The flavors were bold - black pepper, garlic, parm, everything melding together perfectly. The crunchy romaine and kale begged to be consumed
- asparagus: crisp but a tad too salty for me. 
- mac + cheese: OMG where have you been all my life?! This was the BEST mac + cheese I've had. Creamy, cheesy, gooey. The pasta wasn't mushy, it wasn't too cheesy. It was just so good. There were also bits of kale in this to give you the idea that this is a ""healthy"" dish. Saw right through it, but who cares, just eat it! The only drawback is that there is no way you can finish this in one sitting (it's a bit rich), so be kind and share!
- burger (med rare): perfection! Seriously, I asked for med rare and that's what I got. This burger made me so happy to eat. Fries were crispy. 
- steak: the bite I had was delicious!

Pros:
- FOOD! Everything I ate was so delicious. I'd come here just got the food but that wasn't the only awesome thing about this restaurant
- service: we had a large party full of rowdy hungry girls and he was able to handle us with ease
- reservations: making the rez for a large party was a breeze! They were also sweet enough to give us the back/side area of the restaurant, apart from the main dining room. Wasn't expecting that, but much appreciated. it gave us plenty of room to spread out and we even had a extra table for gifts
- decor/ambiance: perfect. Relaxed and elegant without being stuffy. A great place to come on a date, or with a group of friends
- great for large parties or snack, just make a rez!
- down the street from the red rock casino!
- menu was diverse enough with a range of options and different price points (my burger was only $15!)

Cons:
- definitely a locals spot, so I don't imagine I'd come back as I'm usually closer to the strip when visiting, which makes me sad. so sad.

I'd been here before, shortly after it opened and while I had a good experience, I don't remember it blowing me away. However, last night was incredible. 

Between myself and my date, we had Heirloom Squash Soup, Turkey Meatballs and a Sunday comfort food special - Fish and Chips. We devoured every last bite. And don't even get me started on the bread basket and lightly salted sweet butter that required seconds. For dessert...a Cracker Jack sundae with salted peanut butter ice cream and hot fudge with the crunchy childhood treat sprinkled throughout. Let's just say, this creation put the ""crack"" in Cracker Jack.

The service was spot on with every person who visited our table. And the atmosphere and decor were fantastic.

The ambiance is very cozy and welcoming, not what you would expect for the type of food but neither are the prices.  I thought everything was priced pretty reasonable for exceptional food.  

We started with a trio of appetizers.  The lump crab lettuce cups were delicious and simple.  The Ahi tuna poke was on point.  Most places give you more avocado than tuna but not at Honey Salt! Definitely a must have! The bacon flatbread was probably the most disappointing of the appetizers as it was just to simple and in my opinion, nothing special.

For my main course I opted for the special of the day which was a New York Strip, available Oscar style as well which I did not opt for.  The steak was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. It was served along side a chimichuri sauce which was delicious but not needed for such a perfectly cooked steak.  The unsung hero of the dish however was the carrots! Yes, I said carrots.  This was my first time ever having carrots which had apparently been grilled.  Oh my god they were to die for!  Next time I'm going to try and see if I can just get a giant plate of their carrots!

The Anaheim pepper Mac and cheese that accompanied it was perfect, not too spicy. My wife loved the scallops and our friends each had the steaks which were juicy, tender and cooked perfectly. 

The service was attentive and timely. The decor and lighting are especially pleasing and comfortable. It is an open room, but with the tables somewhat crowded together. 

The cocktails that my wife and her friend ordered we're undrinkable, we sent them back and got something more to their liking.  But the drinks were strong and took overlong to get. The beer list is small but adequate.

I'm sorry to say it will probably be my last visit.  We came on a Sunday and there was a brunch menu.  I ordered the Honey Salt Benedict.  I have to say it was pretty tasteless except for a bitter taste I kept tasting.  I think I isolated it to the english muffin part of it.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his Steak and Eggs.  However, the eggs were sunny side up and there was no toast included.  The meal was expensive to begin with and then they charged $5 for 2 pieces of toast.  That should have been included - what do you dip in the sunny side up eggs?  The last straw was when we used the gift certificates.  Our meal for the above mentioned and 2 sodas was almost $50 (quite expensive for breakfast in my opinion).  We were planning on using the remainder on the certificate as part of the tip but we were told that we wouldn't get any change back from the gift certificates (but only when I asked).  It would have been nice to be informed - we would have ordered something else to use the whole certificate.

3850745,2013-10-13,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Usually when a local joint like this is getting a lot of buzz, it rarely lives up to it. This place is no joke though. A must try for any Las Vegas local. I had a fantastic meal with great service and atmosphere.

For two people w/ 2 entrees, 2 cocktails, and 2 desserts it came out to under $80. We came in for Brunch, but honestly, we didn't even order anything from the Brunch specialties. Here's the rundown of what we ordered:

Entrees:
(1) Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken: everyone raved about this on Yelp so I had to try it. Probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Honey mustard took the already perfectly cooked chicken to another level. My friend also fell in love with the Brioche bun.

(2) New England Fry: Unlike any fried calamari or seafood I've had before. Great texture and flavor in this one. Definitely worth a try.

Drinks: 
Their drink menu has one of the best selections of beers and cocktails I've seen at such a reasonable price.

(1) I originally ordered an ""Autumn Crisp"" (bourbon and pumpkin butter) which sounded amazing, so I was a bit disappointed when they said they were out of pumpkin butter. I switched my order to the ""Cherry Wood"" which has Woodford Reserve bourbon, cherry jelly, and lime. It comes in a little mason jar that you shake up at the table. Had a great refreshing feel and paired perfectly with the food.

Desserts:
This is what took the meal over the top for me. So many great selections.

(1) ""Brookie"": This is a cookie baked into a brownie with salted caramel ice cream. Is there any more I need to say about this?

(2) Bourbon Bread Pudding: Again, had to follow the Yelpers and order  the bread pudding. Usually when I order more than one dessert there's the issue of one overpowering the other. One is so much more flavorful and enjoyable that you just don't even want to take another bite of your ""red-headed stepchild"" dessert. This was not the case here. I took a bite of the bread pudding after the phenomenal ""brookie"" and was still blown away and surprised by the flavors. There was even a hint of pumpkin in it. Not sure if this was added just for the season or if this is standard. I even brought some home and warmed it up in the microwave and added my own ice cream and gave it to my parents (who usually don't like bread pudding) and they were in love. 

Don't wait around on this local gem. Take your family, a loved one, or just a good friend to this place and TREAT YO SELF!",cpQLUmF3_inyBki9trgO4g,0,0,5,Yo10cSOiFy7ydLBUcL8bJg

My favorite dish would have to be the chicken. It has good flavor and is served with broccolini and their macaroni and cheese. Good sized portion.

3875236,2012-12-13,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Finally had a chance to try the trendiest place in town to eat at. I do live on the south side so it was journey traveling all the way here just to grab a bite for lunch. I've passed Rampart Commons numerous times, but never actually shopped at any of the stores. I immediately notice that more than half the cars are luxury cars with range rovers appearing the most, welcome to Summerlin I guess? 

Anyway so Honey Salt is tucked in the corner, a larger sign would probably help them to be more noticeable not that they don't already have good marketing tactics. Apon walking inside from what I remember the walls are mainly composed of bricks. The restaurant is definitely trying to give off that farm vibe, but definitely modern and classy at the same time. A chandelier in a farm though? Haha, I guess that was an accent piece.  I already knew I was going to order the chicken sandwich because of what Misti and Anthony had said in their reviews. Chick Fil A on crack ay? Prior to our food arriving we received our bread and these crispy things almost like pita chips but much thinner. The bread was very similar or even identical to what Filipinos call ""pan de sal,"" but this was a wheat version. Nothing special but the cripy things were rather good and fun to dip with into the white bean dip puree according to my friend? Our food came out pretty quick maybe 15 minutes or so? My friend raved about how good the kale salad was the last time she was here to the point she even dreamt about it. Thankfully the chicken sandwich came with a salad that had kale in it and I was looking forward to it since I've never had kale before. The chicken sandwich was rather stuffed, but that's what I expect when paying $13. The breading on the chicken was pretty good, the honey mustard was probably my favorite part. Usually there isn't enough sauce on sandwiches, but this was the prefect amount. Nice slaw inside the sandwich as well. Overall it was good, but I don't know if it's something to do back flips over if you know what I mean? The side salad was mainly composed of edamame, a little bit of kale, a lot of these seeds (I don't know what kind it was), but which was good. Maybe some type of vinaigrette would have been nice? My friend ordered the meatballs and offered me a bite and that was okay too. Our server Julie was pretty good except I felt like at one point we kind of lost her. The service was definitely better than what I expected based on the early reviews of when they first started. Lastly we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert! OMG soo good probably one of the best pieces of cake I've ever had. 3 layer cake with banana cake in the middle. I thought that was a really nice so it wouldn't be too overwhelming with the chocolate. The frosting outside the cake was light fluffy and not too overly sweet.

3877233,2017-10-18,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt has all the fanfare, decor, and even clientele of a bougie LA brunch spot. Even the menu sounds amazing and appetizing. However, the brunch food fell quite short of expectations. 

While I loved the open kitchen and the breakfast and brunch offerings, I was taken aback by how flavorless my meal was. We ended up trying the $10 avocado toast with local tomato and arugula. It was basically two pieces of burnt toast cut in half spread with avocado with halved cherry tomatoes and a sprig of arugula. Let's face it, overpriced avocado toast just isn't the same if it's not in California. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. 

For my meal, I tried the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which sounded amazing. The chicken came out somewhat dry and the slaw was flavorless. I couldn't taste the house dressing at all. If only the chicken had been dressed with something more flavorful, like maybe some honey or salt. What a revelation that would have been! 

The house corned beef & hash featured cubed beef with roasted vegetables and two poached eggs. A pet peeve for anyone eating breakfast should be poached eggs that are overcooked. One egg was runny, while the other yolk was rock solid. Again, the dish lacked any seasoning and was improved only with tabasco sauce.

There are 2 surprising things about this place:

1) it's very spacious, I definitely expected it to be smaller
2) Everything was absolutely worth my money.

I absolutely loved everything about this place, from the decorations, the atmosphere, and of course the food.

I came here knowing I just wanted a salad. I sat down, looked at the menu and decided I had to get their anniversary special! $20 for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. They also added a nice little grass juice in the beginning. 

Squash soup: A little thick, good taste, not too flavorful but I still liked it. I was scared to finish it because I wanted to be able to try everything.

Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich: ""winner winner chicken dinner!"" When this line was created, I'm pretty sure this sandwich is what they had in mind. At first I thought this sandwich would be a little too much, but it wasn't overly fried so it didn't make me feel like I would die from a heart attack. The salad it came with was addicting, they put kale. It was a nice balance with the fat sandwich.

Brown bag apple pie: The presentation was adorable. I wasn't super impressed with the dessert, but it was a solid 7. I really liked the crust and the vanilla bean ice cream was a nice touch.

Ordered the corn soup, eggplant dip to start and the grain power salad & mushroom pizza. Complimentary savory crisp basket while we waited. Dishes rolled out quickly. The corn soup was best described as Autumn in a bowl. Perfectly seasoned and smooth. The eggplant dip was delish. Acidic twist and garnished with spicy fried chickpeas and pita. The ratio of pita to dip was off but had crisp leftover from prior.  Pizza was satisfying and cheesy and def better than the ketchup mess I had down the street from here last week. So another plus. The grain salad was very filling and lots of fresh avocado. The touch of mandarin was delightful. Overall, the ambience was relaxing and fresh.

I ordered off of the restaurant week menu and was happy with the appetizer the fried seafood (forget the official name) its actually i'd say some of the best fried calamari and mussels in the city, their seasoned perfectly and have patron peppers to accompany which was nice. I'd come back for that alone. 
The entree on the other hand is where they lost two stars.. I almost deducted 3 honestly. So to start I had the seared sea scallops. They looked beautiful and were plentiful 4-5 nice sized scallops. The problem arose when all of them were still grainy, and not a little grainy but A LOT grainy. I ate two whole scallops and nibbled on the remaining two and almost every bite was grainy. I know their goal is farm fresh food straight to table, I would have preferred and they cleaned my scallops a little bit longer and delayed it at the table than have grainy scallops. Dah well. 
For dessert we had the brown bag apple pie with the salted carmel ice cream. The ice cream was to die for, the apple pie not so much, but in their defense i'm not a big apple pie fan.

3971000,2013-10-29,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I was surprised when I came to Honey Salt for the first time last night to find that they were having their 1st Anniversary special, a three course dinner for $29.99.  They had a burger special, too, but instead of the scallops I had planned to order, I went with the prix fixe anniversary menu.

The meal started with an amuse-bouche--a demi tasse size cup of their squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil.  It was very tasty and it's a draw to get me back to try more.

I was brought the standard metal container with two slices of bread and two of lavash and some honey butter.  The breads were good.

The first course was a salad with pork belly.  The pork belly was cooked nicely and the greens had a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  There were red and yellow plum tomatoes in the salad.

The second course was ahi tuna.  It was seared perfect;y with a red interior.  The ahi was served on red and white quinoa and some of their house made salsa.  The seasoning of the quinoa and the ahi were excellent!

For dessert, the only course with a choice, I went with their butterscotch pudding.  It came in a glass jar and on the lid were some Cracker Jacks.  The lid was removed by the server and placed on the plate.  There was a layer of cookie crumb beneath the pudding and then some chocolate pudding below.  Great!

Service was as good as some of the top restaurants on the Strip.  I never had more than a few sips of my iced tea when the beverage person was at the table refilling my tea.  When I got coffee with dessert, he was back twice to refill my cup.  My server, Erik, was a pleasant, genial man and he made me feel welcome for my first visit to Honey Salt.

I randomly found this on Yelp and was intrigued with a restaurant so far away from the Strip with such high reviews.  Luckily we had a car to get out here because it was about a 22-28 min drive depending on what part of the Strip you're staying at.

I made a reservation, it really wasn't needed when we arrived on a Saturday around 2:30pm.  The place is CUTE.  Decor was very country chic.  

We got some Monkey Bread and those were bomb!  Almost a dessert.  So sweet and guilty feeling.  

I got the breakfast pizza while my husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich with a salad.  We also got a side of breakfast potatoes.  I thought the breakfast pizza was just ok.  It's fully cooked eggs on a layer of spinach with chicken sausage and cheese.  I like my breakfast pizzas with some potatoes and a broken yolk.

My husband's sandwich was bomb!  Very delicious fried chicken sandwich AND that side salad was very good!

Nothing to write about regarding the breakfast potatoes. just the norm.

Customer service was prompt and courteous.

I was hoping they would have their lunch menu because I wanted to try the lunch set price but on Saturday and Sundays it's only a Brunch menu.

3993369,2012-11-26,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"It is was a heavy heart that I give Honey Salt only three stars. After reading all the articles in the paper and the early reviews by other yelpers, I was really looking forward to trying the restaurant. 

First off, the food does not disappoint. The biloxi fried chicken sandwich is appropriately described as ""Chick Fil-A on crack."" Not too salty, crispy and moist chicken along with bread and butter pickle chips. The chopped salad that accompanies the sandwich is also magnificent. A light dressing compliments the flavors of the coarsely chopped ingredients, so you can actually taste the edamame, carrots, etc. I tried the backyard favorite burger the next time I went to Honey Salt. It is cooked to order and made even better with the egg. 

Two issues about Honey Salt that really disappointed were the service and the value. I felt the prices were just a touch expensive for the amount of food you are getting. Next, the service was lacking both times I went. The first time, with a large group of fellow Yelpers, there seemed to be a lot of confusion especially at the beginning and end of the meal. For the UYE I mentioned seperate checks for multiple parties while making the reservation, I was told that would not be a problem, but when telling the waiter this before placing our orders, it seemed to shock him a bit. There was some confusion while we were placing drink orders and lots of confusion when trying to get our checks. The second time going there, the situation only seemed to get worse. The waitress not being able to describe the portion of the food accurately, not placing my order correctly, people walking by while not offering to refill my ice tea, even pouring hot coffee across a customer and spilling some. By themselves these are little errors, but they add up quickly. You don't expect such errors from a more experienced waitstaff, so I am hoping they will work themselves out given more time. 

Being so close and serving such tasty food, I can't imagine myself not going back. Unfortnately, with the prices and service issues (hopefully temporary) I don't think I will be able to make it a local hangout spot.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,6,1,3,x9xTtSKne1rzixaXFJmC2g
3994022,2013-05-15,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"We had dinner at Honey Salt on Monday, May 13 (not our first time there). Many reviews complain about the service, but I have to say that in my many times dining there (15+), I have never had a negative experience with the service. The hostesses are incredibly nice, and often Elizabeth herself is there to greet you, usually with some kind of compliment! I've always found the waiters and bussers to be extremely helpful and friendly, whether I'm there with a huge table of 10 or just a table of 2.

The decor is amazing - a HUGE improvement from the former restaurant in this space (which I actually thought had excellent food, just no atmosphere). Honey Salt is casual chic and they went to great lengths to achieve that feel: eclectic mirrors on the walls, booth seating around the perimeter, and my absolute favorite part - all of the chairs are different!

The wine list is not huge, but the selections they have are great, and their specialty drinks are really really tasty. The food is the only reason I do not give this restaurant five stars. It is definitely tasty, but just not stand-out impeccable five-star quality. The curry chicken can be hit-or-miss, the steak is delicious but just not over-the-top special, and I would say the same for the appetizers. I will say that the food has been improving recently, and they have added several new items to their menu like a delicious ceviche (that is served in a really cute way, and I'm a sucker for that). My favorite thing on the menu is actually the burger, which comes with a fried egg on top!

Overall I love this restaurant and absolutely plan to keep coming back!!!

Plenty of shrimp on each tortilla along with a yummy homemade salsa, diced avocado and a creamy Sriracha aioli which topped them off.  Every bite was a piece of heaven but the portions were small.

No surprise here...it was Saturday night at 7 and it was busy!

The bread and crackers were scrumptious served with whipped butter topped with black salt and honey.   Yum. I always salt my bread and butter do I was ultra pleased that they had done it for me!  My little guy housed about 5 of the cheesy crackers and they gladly brought us more. 

Our server was busy. We didn't see much of him but we were well taken care of by the team. They are right on top of removing dirty plates and such. Our server did spend a little time on the menu before we ordered which was nice. 

We ordered Mac and cheese for my little guy. Super delectable. Hubby had squash soup and chicken. Squash soup was very good but under seasoned. They provide a nice table side presentation with a cute glass pitcher. His chicken was seated and cooked to chicken breast perfection. The caramelization was a visual treat. It was seasoned nicely. 

I had the special Cobria with acorn squash purée, roasted Brussels sprouts and a bacon vinaigrette. It was delicious and I was pleased with the texture of the fish. It was under seasoned and I did not like the very large blood line down my filet. The portion was perfect. All in all, a little salt added at the table and yum. 

I also tried my mom's pork which was scrumptious and cooked to perfection. 

Make no mistake, honey salt is not cheap. My fish was $29. Kids meals are $8. Soup was $8 and chicken was $23. Hubby had 1 beer which made dinner circa $100 for 2 adults and a toddler with 1 drink, and no dessert. It's certainly a nice meal and we took out of town guests.

Nice patio.

Cons:
The prices are pretty high. For food that includes sandwiches and salads, you are paying in the teens for each dish. Drinks are equally expensive.

We waited another 15 minutes before our appetizers came (missing one we ordered) and another 5 before our beverages arrived (missing one we ordered, yet again). The wine ordered came in strange ""mouthwash"" glasses that were hot...yes...HOT. When we notified our waiter of the missing orders he apologized and ran off yet again. Finally, nearly 45 minutes after we ordered our entrees the food finally came...and with all the built up anticipation fell completely flat. The scallops were sandy, the chicken was dryer than the saltine challenge and the bolognese and curry chicken unremarkable. Portions are tiny and served in a manner that would suggest dining at a much nicer establishment. I had high hopes for this place but it was sorely lacking in service and quality for the price. Maybe if they spent more time working on service and less time hand stamping their menus with honeysalt logos I would have enjoyed it more. Might try in three months but I would stay away for now...",HnkRyaqvu8B3UGXmWrPZJQ,2,0,1,KNctxyUG0kJv2k4oEQivYQ

Once I walked in, I was instantly impressed. Honey Salt definitely reminded me of a few of my favorite places in SoCal (La Jolla area to be specific), so I felt at home. We were seated at a large table right in front of the kitchen so we could see all of the action. 

We ordered the whole wheat veggie pizza as an appetizer but we weren't impressed. It was just meh. Even the vegetarian at the table didn't go back for seconds. The cracker/chips that were on the table were amazing....or maybe we were just starving. 

I went for the power lunch which included a salad, fries, your choice of sandwich and a dessert. My salad was great...and yes I've had places to screw up my salads before...then there was the Biloxi buttermilk chicken sandwich that makes my mouth water as I type this. A cracked out version of the chick-fil-a sandwich is an accurate description! I was satisfied with it. Even had the buttery bun with a sweet honey mustard sauce that put my taste buds in heaven. 

With the power lunch you get the option of the bread budding or a raspberry sorbet for dessert so I decided for the warm bread pudding but was not impressed at all. At this point I was so full from my salad and sandwich I wasn't bothered by the bread pudding. 

The staff was always attentive to us and made sure we had everything we needed. I will definitely be back. The apple pie and burger is next on my list!",4A83_zUaPBUn5Nc7eeOgtA,3,2,5,_9weIgnZrgTAiRwYZEESaQ

This restaurant has been put together with love and precision and it shows.  I don't care how busy this place gets, they always have their game face on and I believe everyone genuinely loves working here and it shows.

Lets get to the important part, the food.  The menu changes based on seasonal offerings, but I have yet to have something on this menu that I did not love.  I will focus on our meal yesterday for lunch.

They always bring out a complimentary bread with a spread, yesterday it was a thin crispy wafer like bread with a compound butter.  It was delicious, crunchy and light, perfect for lunch.  I started with the Smashed Pea Soup, hubby started with Calamari.  The calamari was fried, but it was not oily and it was very flavorful.  My soup tasted as if the peas had just come out of the garden and were made into my bowl of soup on command.  The soup was just plain delicious.  

We then had the My Wife's Favorite Salad (name of salad) and The Caesar with Chicken.  My salad had duck confit (you read that correctly), spring mix and frisee with slices of mandarin and a fried egg on top.  It was ridiculously good and I am happy to learn that is it a standard on the menu because I will have to go back for this and soon.  Hubby loved his Caesar, but was not thrilled with his chicken addition.  He found the chicken lacking in flavor and moisture.

The service, as mentioned above, was very good.

The ambience was cute but a little too much decor in my opinion. Seems they are going for a rustic, French, farm theme? But it's quite confused and could stand some editing. It's a pretty large restaurant and was going renovations to make even more space.

The rest of the food was good- nothing that stood out particularly- but nothing that was terrible either. Those Parmesan crisps though???? I dream of them.",cPfy1Ot91-HlFTjfuXPkvA,2,1,4,cSuJxCjPL61Lxq8BcSkXAg
4146520,2018-05-30,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I finally had a chance to try brunch. I'm usually at Honey Salt for weekday lunch and dinners. 

First of all, the service is impeccable here. The wait staff know what they're doing. They're friendly, informative and always checking to see if everything is great.

Second, the food is tasty, perfectly seasoned, and the right portions. Although, there are times, I wish it was less, so I wouldn't eat it all.

I'm not sure if Yelp saves all of the past reviews, so I won't go into the other meals I've had. For brunch, my friend had the chicken salad, and I had Elizabeth's Caesar with a side of salmon. I love the salmon here. Just a few doors down from Honey Salt they have salad and salmon too for not too difference in price, but the quality and flavor, so much better for the money at Honey Salt. 

The fruit platter is more like a bowl. There's enough fruit for 2-3 people, if you're not making fruit your main meal. I loved the pieces of mint in it. We tried the monkey bread as well. It's more like a cluster of rolls with caramel sauce. It's fun, I think, if you have a few people to share.

Honey Salt knows desserts. The chocolate Society cake is amazing. The banana is an interesting twist. At first, I was more hesitant about the banana, but now I really like it. On this meal, we had the brownies and the brookie with a scoop of ice cream. The brookie is a killer dessert - a little bit of everything you're craving in a dessert. Seriously, I would go to Honey Salt just for the desserts. 

Finally, in comparison to other restaurants, the cost quite is reasonable.

Very nice ambiance inside, very comfortable but cozy.  Kind of a shabby chic vibe, kind of modern/hipster, but nicely balanced.  Our server was Scott and I can't say enough good things about him.  He was attentive, kind, knowledgeable, funny, you-name-it.  We got there early and so we were the first ones seated in the large dining room (we're old, we eat early); he came over and greeted us, got our drinks going, explained a bunch about the place since I mentioned it was our first time.  We felt very welcomed and it was great!  

I ordered the Mary's Brick Chicken which comes with a small portion of mac'n'cheese and kale.  The whole thing was perfection.  I've never had a more tender chicken and it's my favorite meat so I eat it a lot.  I'm usually very blah on mac'n'cheese but this one is so flavorful, we're definitely going to have to go back for more.  It has a slight kick to it but I'm a total spice-wimp, it's really very slight.  Loved, loved, love it!  Husband ordered the charred filet mignon which came with a couple of sides as well.  He also loved everything.  Filet was as tender as it should be and cooked exactly as it should be.  The veggies were delicious.  

The sides that come with the ""Plates"" are very small so if you are very hungry or tend to have a big appetite, you'll want to order an additional side.  I hate large meals so it was great for me!  

We ended up having room for the ""brookie"" which is a brownie with a cookie on top of it, topped with salted caramel ice cream.  It was fantastic - except for the one issue I run into with every a la mode dessert I order: not enough ice cream!!! I want to have enough ice cream for some in every bite of the brownie/cookie and that didn't happen.  The ice cream was the best part too!

I came here a few weeks ago with my hubby while waiting for my car to get serviced at JL. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and helped by a very friendly and professional waiter. 

I had tea and a salmon dish with quinoa and a touch of cranberry and veggies which was super tasty and cooked just the way I had requested. My hubby ordered a green juice and turkey meatball pizza which he liked very much and I also thought was very tasty. 

Our total bill came out to be $49 and cents but not including tip which I thought was a little bit over the top for the amount of food we were getting but was glad I tried it. The steep price tag won't deter me from coming back and I'm looking forward to trying some other things on the yummy menu that might be a little wallet friendly.

Overall the service was fast and friendly and the food was delish but I'd say that the average lunch will definitely set you back about $40 + and if you think that's worth it then I'd say go for it but if your looking for a cheap meal then this might not be the place for some peeps.

As a huge (figuratively & in reality) fan of the shop local, eat local, drink local movement, Honey Salt encompassed all this as they source locally for their supplies. And it is in the perfect location as my manwhore lives in Queensridge. It could really have been our go-to non-casino place. 

Atmosphere was very nice, big change from the wine bar that was there. Fat people seating was decent. Sturdy armless chairs. Hip friendly.  (see below for further info on this) 

Food: broad selection for most everyone. Free range chicken cooked to perfection. tender steak. great sides & decent drinks. 
Brunch was full of interesting food. I had the Bananas Foster French toast. Delightful. Shared Turkey meatballs that had perfect caramelized onions.   Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken - just like my grammy used to make (except in Alabama) 
 
So why only 3 stars? 

We went 3 times, Lunch, Dinner & Brunch. All 3 times, despite having open tables in the main area, we were seated past the bar next to the bathroom and where they put the ""families with kids"" - which we are one but he's 22. Normally we wouldn't care except that it is a virtual runway to the bathroom. My only reasoning on why this would happen on 3 very separate occasions is that we don't exactly fit the ""hipster"" image they wish to cater too. We are older (with black AMEX cards I might add) we are a racially diverse group & we are on the plumper side of plump. 

Service: as we were seated in the ""back 40"" - we had to wait. wait for drinks. wait for food. wait for our check. While the aforementioned manwhore was annoyed that they didn't remember us until I pointed out, different times, different staff, he did manage to have a few choice words with the manager on duty. 

It's sad because I did like the food but unless we get takeout or my son & I go alone, I'm pretty sure we wont be back.",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,4,3,3,0bOOaORwLhIjTOBw2TFkqQ

Turkey meatballs were a nice start from the 3 course meal. Satisfying; neither salty nor overtly meaty. The marinara sauce complimented it rather than drowned it. It also had onions to taste, but I detest onions. 

Main entree was lovely, grilled salmon in a bed of black and red quinoa with hidden mandarin oranges! It gave a rather subtle but zesty flavor and the quinoa wasn't too mushy. Grilled salmon was soft, didn't make me feel like I had a mercury overdose, and wasn't oily. Each slice of it was velvety to my tastebuds. I normally don't eat grilled salmon but this definitely deserves a thumbs up from me. I also had a small bite of chicken sandwich to try - it wasn't dry, slightly smokey, but the honey mustard overpowered it for me as it was too strong for my liking.

Dessert definitely filled me up since we all ordered the Brookie- basically a play on words of brownie and cookie topped with ice cream. I liked how its not too sweet (the ice cream gave the brownie and cookie a nice hint of sweetness) and it reminded me of brownies that my mom used to bake me when I was young.  

Overall, our dining experience was satisfactory. Although I did like how the restaurant boasts using organic ingredients and exercised the farm-to-table concept, the food didn't really stun me as I hoped it would. It might have been because it was the hottest day of the year (close to 117 degrees) so coming in felt rather draining. I'll probably give them another chance on their half off Monday menu.",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,9,8,4,LDROXZxXmxS9-kRft0UvLA

I love the decor and ambiance. Service was just ok as my husband had to chase down our server to pay. I had asked for a more private area since I had the baby with us and just in case she decided to scream her head off we wouldn't be the center of attention. 

We started of with the New England Fry.  Yummy seafood with just the right amount of crispy and not overcooked.  I decided to go for the Banana Foster French Toast in hopes that it wasn't too sweet. My husband got the all popular Biloxi chicken sandwich. My French toast was amazing...the cornflake crust and the thick bread with caramelized bananas soooooo good.  My tummy rumbles just thinking about it. It definitely was just the right amount of sweetness which my palate isn't too sweet. I was super excited to try the Biloxi buttermilk chicken sandwich as many people have compared it to the famous chick fil a chicken sandwiches but I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't in love with the sandwich and I didn't think it was OMG good. It was decent but I wouldn't order it again. Maybe it was just an off day but in any case I wasn't impressed. 

Overall service was ok for a Sunday during brunch. They weren't packed or anything like that.  This place is pricey for brunch but I would like to come back for dinner and try that.

I've gone for lunch a few times and always ordered the same thing. Mainly because the menu is small and what I order suffices without being completely outstanding. The caesar salad and the Biloxi buttermilk chicken sandwich. A pretty smart combo. I love a salad that looks and tastes like it should be breakfast in the Hamptons. Ooh, try the starter bread crackers and dipping sauces. That honey and salt is delicious. 

My only wonder would be that I don't feel there is an outburst of flavors; but I think that's their point.

Everyone was really pleased with their meal. For dessert I shared the bread pudding, which was very good. Our waiter also brought us out a plate of petit fours since my friend's salmon took a little longer to be prepared, which was a very nice touch.

The restaurant is decorated really cool, rustic-chic. The concept looks like it was taken out of the pages of a Food and Wine photo shoot, where they go on location to a famous person's barn or vineyard and the kids are running around in Anthropologie clothes while their parents are carving up a whole pig and making cocktails. Very Little House on the Prairie meets Crate and Barrel.

The menu is short, portions small. We ordered the free range oven chicken breast with mac n cheese and the linguine and clams. The linguine was good! You should order that :) No strong seafood-y taste. 
The dessert menu looked like it had a lot of potential. Come to Honey Salt for dessert and drinks or brunch, rather than dinner. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice, however I think you can find better for the price range.

The food came and everything and I mean everything, had such fantastic flavors & presentation. We enjoyed the Caesar Salad, Mac n Cheese and Meatball Pizza. BRILLIANT! And finished off with a scoop of ice-cream that MELTED our minds. Salted Carmel Chunk! Booya!

Yay for you Honeysalt!! Give your boy Paul a raise. He's a hell of a server and asset to your restaurant.

The only thing I would have liked is a more intimate ambience. I can tell they've worked the space the best they can but it was just too open and slightly noisy. But don't worry. The flavors in your mouth will make you soon forget where the hell you even are.

Very solid food but nothing great or memorable. And for the price, you want something memorable. The decor is great! Very homey/cool. The service was good, if a bit rushed. 

We started with the New England fry, which was very good, if a bit small for 15 bucks. Not too greasy for a fry, and the sauce was delicious. 

I also had the fried chicken sandwich, which was solid, but not great. Slaw was good, the chicken was good and the mustard sauce was ok. But, the side of homemade potato chips was pretty lackluster, underseasoned, and a bit of a letdown. Pretty much any side (fries, a great potato salad etc.) would've been better.

I finished with the strawberry shortcake dessert. It was OK. Not too sweet, but almost not sweet enough. it honestly could've used a compote or some other sweet element. Again, fine, but not something I'd order again.

4346382,2018-01-04,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt is pricey and forgettable, it just isn't a very memorable restaurant food-wise outside of the charming rustic interior that's admittedly impressive to the naked eye. While the interior is nice to look at, you can't eat it so here's a review of the actual food:

- Biloxi Chicken Sandwich (brunch): Average at best. The chicken had a nice initial crunch but it was dry and gummy towards the end. If you want a proper fried chicken sandwich, you can't do better than Yardbirds inside The Venetian. It comes with a caesar salad which I thought was a strange salad to couple with a fried chicken sandwich.
- Honey Salt Benedict: Wife really enjoyed this benedict but the portions looked small to me for the price (see photos).
- Cocoa Puff French Toast: Very sweet, overly so, and difficult to finish.
- Coffee: Excellent, very strong per my wife. 

Service: Hit or miss, this time, a miss. We came in for brunch on New Year's Day and we had 3 rotating servers for some reason. One of them kept delivering the wrong order to us (two times) before finally getting it right. She seemed out of it (either hungover or just fatigued) and we had to keep directing her to the parties that actually ordered the food she was trying to give us.

Expect to spend $30 per person for brunch with tax and tip.",dJtFy2jc1R5cSBab4BLORQ,5,1,3,f5YH9pSfbde7SGesB7FSzQ

They had cute napkins that had the restaurants name on it. My chicken sandwich was really good. Portion size is big so we had to take it home. My boyfriends burger was good too. I tried some of his Caesar salad and it was delicious. I liked the croutons in it as well. The ice cream that came with the brookie was amazing.

I was impressed with service. We warmly welcomed in like being invited into someone's home. Our waiter, Travis was genuinely kind and a wealth of information about the menu and restaurant.

The food was outstanding. The lavash is not your basic lavish. The combination of the light texture and cheesy flavor is great. For our meals we had the Southern chicken sandwich and the burger. The chicken sandwich had so many lovely flavors and the chicken had a tasty, unique seasoning blend that is obviously made in house. I almost didn't order the burger because I was worried that might be a boring choice, but I'm so glad that I did. So juicy and flavorful, definitely not your average beef burger and instead a blend of several flavorful meats. We topped the meal off with an amazing huckleberry bread pudding.

i love everything about it! the food, the staff, the drinks, the decor. it is all quite lovely!

Food:
charred octopus- i usually hate octopus because its chewy and not pleasant to eat. but this appetizer was so good. the octopus was soft and tender and the charred parts gave it this wonderful flavor of goodness. perfect balance

scallop ceviche- came in this cool little carrier almost like a wooden toolbox or something to fit in with the rustic theme of the restaurant. fresh no sand or ""sea"" smell just GOODNESS

caramelized sea scallops- super delish. I've been on a scallop kick and these are so GOOD! just perfectly cooked on each side to brown it. YUMMMMMMMM

prime rib special- they had a special the night i went for prime rib. it came out grilled which is not what I'm use to but i think i liked it even more grilled than the usual. need some sort of sauce or horseradish or something to accompany and it would have been perfect.

backyard favorite burger- gotta add the egg. came with a little tin can of french fries that weren't anything special. but the burger was quite good and would def recommend for burger lovers

side of asparagus- nothing special. its asparagus!

DRINKS: they have a good drink selection of cocktail and twist on classics. there is a drink that comes with an ice ball that is very similar to an old fashion but EVEN BETTER!! i might of had to0 many of them.  :) I might have to return just to drink these ice ball old fashion type drinks. think its called midnight rambler?

We started off ordering the turkey meatball pizza. It was just ok.  I found the tomato sauce and meatballs to lack flavor. They were both very bland and some of the pizza crust was burnt, which I do not like the taste, so that was a turn off.

For my meal, I ordered the Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese, which was tasty. That I would order again. As far as the Tuscan Bean soup that went with it, I enjoyed the flavor of the broth but I felt like the beans were too thick and heavy for the soup. 

My friend ordered the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken, that was great. I really liked the house durkees dressing. It was the perfect amount of sweetness to blend the flavors together well.

Overall I felt it was ok and may or may not go back. It was very busy when we went so maybe the kitchen wasn't on their ""A"" game. I will say though, for the price we paid, I did expect a little more then ""ok.""",7_sPLoQotRRkxMFJlxbM0A,0,0,3,72tvcMEM_7u4rWhpc0m8_g

When you pay over $60 for food to go, is it too much to ask to have someone greet you when you walk in?  Usually, the bar takes care of to-go orders.  There was a bartender there who made eye contact with me, and continued speaking to the one person sitting at the bar.  The person seating customers takes me to the end of the bar and tries to get the bartender to ring me up, and the guy literally put his hands up in the air implying, ""I'm not doing it.""  He motioned over to some girl sitting behind the bar having her dinner with another employee.  Without even looking up from her dinner, she said, ""Just use my number and ring her up.""  The warm, welcoming feel I usually get from the restaurant was nonexistent.

I probably would not even be writing this review had it not been for what I discovered once I got home.  I specially ordered the Brown Paper Bag Apple Pie for the Salted Caramel Ice Cream, and was UNBELIEVABLY disappointed to find out that we were given plain, boring vanilla.  

That coupled with the fact that I have received better service at Outback just did it for me.  I've have taken several friends to Honey Salt, and recommend it to anyone I know who wants to try a new place.  That won't be happening anymore because this experience did it for me.  $60 for take out, and no one even wanted to take the time to ring me up which would have taken 3 minutes out of their lives.

Served alongside a small salad of edamame, kale, cheese, carrots, radishes, seeds with a light vinaigrette. A glamorized chicken sandwich that I don't think is worth $13.00.
The Tuna tartare was good, but as my daughter says, ""it's pretty hard to mess up tuna tartare"". A small portion and overpriced at $15.00.
Service was ok. This place seems to cater to a typical pretentious Summerlin crowd. Overall, nothing special and not worth the $40 lunch bill for 2 for an app and fried chicken sandwich with one soda.

What I mean is that food aside, all the details were perfect. The design language was consistent from utensils, to seating, to the interior design. The exposed but artful brick wall is easy on the eyes. It was playful, verging on eclectic, but not kitsch or pastiche. An interesting touch is the free salt scrub in the bathroom.

It doesn't take itself too seriously but is excellent where it counts. Great dining experience stripped of all pretentiousness. Wait staff were very attentive, helpful, and pleasant.

As for the food, we had the chicken sandwich, grilled octopus, grain power salad, burger, roasted eggplant, Margherita pizza, burrata/fig/tomato/chocolate salad, peach pie, and ice cream.

The grain power was definitely the best dish. Flavorful, light, and all the ingredients worked well together (shaved fennel, baby clementine, mint, red and white quinoa, avocado, chicken, dill, sunflower seed(?)). The burger was ok. The grilled octopus was good, very tender. Roasted eggplant was good. The margherita pizza was solid, and just the way I like it: very thin, light sauce. It was maybe a bit a bland a touch too cool when it came to the table. The burrata salad was good but while all its individual ingredients shone (loved the bittersweet chocolate) they didn't combine into something more than the sum of its parts, like the grain power salad. Peach pie and the ice cream were also good.

We decided to share the turkey meatballs for an app. I really liked the sauce, it had a very homemade taste. For an entree I had the caramelized sea scallops, so good! They were cooked so perfectly and were so delicious. My boo had the chicken breast which looked very good too. He let me steal some mac n cheese which was very rich & tasty. For a dessert we shared the brookie. I literally would come here everyday only for the brookie. That thing was to die for!

The decor and setting is a mix between a restaurant and a surban mother's home. The service wasn't bad but it was lacking nonetheless.

Again no, he left it there for the entire meal. The food was just ok, honestly I would have been more satisfied at the chipotle up the street.

I went to Honey Salt for lunch twice and I do not see myself going back.  I feel bad about it too, because I was excited after reading the reviews and looking over the menu.  I also really looked forward to the cocktails, and after trying three different drinks I realized they sounded good and looked pretty, but were not that good to drink.

Tried a few things:
Margherita Pizza: Bland and boring.  Even the waiter tried to steer me towards ordering another pizza and I should have taken his advice.
Cannellini Bean Soup: Once again a bit bland.  I make better bean soup than this at home.
New England Fry: Good, but not a lot for the price.  The sauce that came with it was not good at all.
Buffalo Mozzarella and Tomato Salad: Best thing I had here.
Honey Salt Caesar Salad: Big disappointment, the lettuce was chopped to bits and not fresh.
Grilled Cheese: Good, but greasy and small.
Roasted Salmon: Weird mixture of citrus and salmon, not even remotely worth the price.

The best part of the meal is the desert selection.  The caramel chunk ice cream may be the best ice cream you ever have.  I also really liked the cookie plate and bread pudding.

I am hoping that over time this restaurant can live up to its buzz.  If they revamp their menu, I might give them another shot.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,2,1,3,-UVG1gRhOdBdBTZ3OIMQtw
4579958,2013-03-18,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"When you come in, you are blasted with the very cute and tasteful shabby chic decor. Definitely a girl place. Perfect for girlfriend lunches and girly happy hour. I went with my boyfriend and he agreed that it was pretty feminine, haha! Oh well. Restaurants are about the food so whatev.  

Appetizers:

-Three words. Kale. Caesar. Salad.
We were completely blown away by this salad. It was coated in salty-parmesany, caesar, goodness! I would come back just for that alone! Since everyone and their momma's these days is on the Kale train, Honey Salt is smart to add it to the menu  (you can either get the Caesar Salad with kale or romaine)

-Shrimp cocktail. 
I didn't know shrimp got that big and could taste that sweet! The cocktail sauce was pretty standard but the shrimp was yuuuummmmmm.

Main Course.

My boyfriend had the filet mignon (medium rare). I took a bite and it literally melted in my mouth. I'm not a huge fan of cow, but man, that was delicious!

I had the chicken curry. It was okay, nothing mind blowing and I probably should have asked if they could turn the heat down a notch. I should know not to get ""curry"" anything unless it's at an authentic Indian restaurant. They served it in cute mini pots. One had the rice and the other had the curry. There was also something they served on the side that i THINK had mangos in it. The sweetness of the mangos really complemented the spicy flavors of the curry and added a cooling effect also. 

Dessert.

Bread Pudding.
I've never been a fan of bread pudding, but our waitress (who was super nice and attentive) recommended it and the girl KNOWS what she's talking about. It was hot, cinnamon-y, smooth, and fragrant. Plop on the vanilla ice cream and the deal is DONE. sooooo gooood!

I'll definitely come back to this place but maybe not as often since they're a little on the pricey side, which is totally cool because the quality of their food is great. I see a lot of girlfriend lunches at this place in the future!",eH8-DE48eh6xXnoKc6_lnw,3,1,4,4x5ANMHiGsnMMqYe0oZkvw

All I can say is, Wow! This place is awesome! You would usually have to travel to Manhattan or L.A. to enjoy a dining experience such as this. The menu items are a bit pricy, but well worth every penny. There is outside seating, but it was way too hot to eat outside today. The dining room area is nice and cozy. There is a small bar up towards the front of the restaurant. The kitchen staff looks extremely professional and organized. There is an expediter that checks every dish leaving the kitchen. The staff is very friendly and efficient. My Iced Tea never got less than half full. The busser did an excellent job!

The food was outstanding! This place is a hidden gem. The apps are around $15. The entrees run between $23 to $33. The sides are about $7 and the deserts are around $9. They even had a pre-set menu at dinner time with part of the proceeds going to a local charity.

The Food:

Bread basket - Excellent!
Served with potato bread, lavish, and honey/salt butter.

Tuna Tartar - Excellent!
Very fresh and tasty.

New England Fry - Excellent!
Fried clams and calamari with a tangy mayo on the side.

Free Range Chicken breast with Mac & Cheese - Excellent!

Grass Fed Filet - Excellent!
Cooked perfectly Med Rare.

Seared Scallops - The BEST ever!!
The truffle sauce served with the scallops is unbelievably good. Wow! So good.

Parmasen Fries - Good.
Just fries. Nothing special.

Bread Pudding with Salted Carmel Ice Cream - Outstanding!
I hate bread pudding, but the person I was dining with said it was one of the best ever. I even tried it and if bread pudding did not sound so gross to me, I would probably enjoy it.

Peach Pie in a Bag with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream - Outstanding!
Served in a small dish covered with a brown paper bag. The peach pie is served with the crumb pie crust on top of the peaches. So good!

I don't usually get this excited about my reviews, but that was an incredible dining experience. Highly recommend. I will be back to this place often.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,6,2,5,no5zhj3Ed20QQW7aIieiwA

Environment: the location is in pretty empty plans deep in the corner. The decorations were cool, seemed like a French theme with chandeliers and plate decorations. There is outdoor and indoor seating. 

Service: I really liked my waitress. She was very sweet and was constantly checking in on us. I did feel like the busboys were standing around making it a little difficult to get to the restrooms. 

Food and drinks: the drinks were delicious. I was especially happy because they had half off during happy hour. I had a peach vodka drink that I would say is the best, the watermelons tequila drink, whiskey with berries and Moscow mule were good too. Their happy hour snacks were pretty good, but now super memorable. 
I had the chicken nuggets which was good, but the sauce was a little too sweet. The margherita pizza was good, not super toasty, but I enjoyed it. The guac and chips were good, but I wish the chips were warmer. The strip steak was okay as well, it tasted a little too smoky and dry, although it did appear medium rare as I had requested. The carrots looked a bit creepy too, but I guess organic carrots appear that way.

Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere. I liked the drinks much more than the food, but enough that I would come back for the happy hour.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,3,1,4,Ab0CVpE1O45izL0KTXT-iA

We sat down at 6p and made reservation on open table. Took server 5 minutes to greet us. By that time we were irritated because it was way too long of a wait. No apologies just why can I get you to drinK. Really? No upsell or suggestive sell? 
We ordered all of our apps and drinks and then had to flag down the waiter to order our meal. Truly felt as if we were not important. A party of seven with a bill of $350 clearly isn't trying to be cheap but yet we were not taken care of and had to ask for bread, drinks and refills on n/a beverages. 
The two managers walked around the room quite a bit and never once did they stop to ask about our experience. Really poor table touching.

Fatima was great! She was attentive and made sure our mimosas were never empty. They have three varieties (or more since they can mix them!) and each were amazing. Though I suggest the blood orange mixed with Bellini. 

Food wise, we had the much talked about monkey bread to start. While I'm not a sweets guy, this was amazing and did not have me wanting to run to the dentist. The brioche was soft and warm with just enough caramel drizzle to make you want more without killing you with sugar. Entree wise, I got the biscuits and gravy and damn! Simplicity elevated and done right. Everything from the warm cheddar biscuit to the bacon gravy with seasonal veggies added in came together to form a complete bite.

4649974,2014-10-19,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I had heard about Honey Salt for quite some time and finally decided to give it a shot. It's an adorable local restaurant with a shabby chic sort of vibe. Luckily I arrived pretty early in the evening because they got quite busy towards the end of my dinner.

I was eager to try some of the seemingly vegan friendly options listed on their online menu, but none of the things I wanted were available and/or actually vegan. The server I had was really friendly and seemed to believe I could order whatever and the chef would ensure it would be vegan. This was not the case.

I started with the shishito peppers and was informed the portion would be quite large. They were really good peppers, but were under seasoned and the portion absolutely could not be described as large. Due to the steep price, I refrained from ordering another. For my entree, the server suggested I allow the chef to create a spaghetti squash based pasta. This sounded great so I obliged. I was thoroughly let down when a sloppy plate of severely undercooked squash arrived with some dried out artichokes. This is all that was in the so called pasta. Need I say more? 

I had to return the ""pasta"" and order something else. I would also like to mention as an Italian, this couldn't possibly pass as pasta. At this point, my mom who was my dinner guest, had finished her pizza. I still had not received the quinoa dish to replace my dismal squash entree. The quinoa dish was at least edible, although I would NEVER order it again. 

Overall, I was pretty disappointed. Their food is grossly overpriced (at least for veggie dishes) and for having what appeared to be 4+ Chefs (not line cooks) working, pretty sad. They could definitely use some new talent in my opinion, which is pretty biased due to several close friends. I am fortunate to know several very highly regarded Chefs that may have forever thrown off my palette so that mediocre food just isn't acceptable. I was also married to a Chef for 9 years, that could also have skewed my opinion. 

All in all, this is a nice local spot and may even be great when eating meat and other living creatures and their by-products. What do I know, I'm just a vegan environmental policy advocate. Try it out for yourself! The cute vibe and emphasis on locally raised agriculture is enough to warrant a visit.",KzcGWMHryaiQGfqzN0nYsA,3,3,3,LSEqJXL3E02pg-BZNE-_wQ

There are no booths for secluded conversation in its big open dining room.  There are no nooks to settle into.  The music is loud and annoying when you are trying to have a nice meal with friends/family.  Overall, this place is too open and too loud.  And I am not saying this as an 'old, crotchety' person.

Honey Salt gets five stars for atmosphere, service (we had our meal at the bar which is our preference) and most of all for the food. My husband had the hamburger and said it was his best memory of a hamburger - and the French fries (or Man Fries as I think they are called) were just plain perfect - I should know - I ate half his order. I also had the tuna tartar - it was light and had no heavy oil so many restaurants add. The freshness of the fish was the taste. The poached egg on the duck confit salad warmed the dish and added richness and flavor. We passed on dessert this time but only because this was my second meal out today!  I already know I will be having the cookie plate on my return. Home run for our area and our taste buds!  Congratulations to all involved pulling off such a great experience the first few days opened speaks volumes to how wonderful this restaurant will be for years to come.

If I had known that, I would've ordered endless mimosas and had three. So that sucks. 

Other than that...we had a great experience. The food was great. The staff seemed to all get along, which I like to see when I'm eating. I don't like feeling like restaurant staff is disgruntled because that probably means I'm eating boogers. 

I would definitely go back. And with my new knowledge of mimosa pricing...I will leave a little more tipsy next time.",fiAoyQHLa9Mz8QvsXzqVzw,1,0,4,hbwQ8epnkrhkWEJZboAR4A

The ambiance is lively and decor is modern country shiek. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Our waitress was attentive and super accomadating. I ordered the frittata and my friend ordered the breakfast nachos. They have an open kitchen so you could see some cooking action. The place filled up very quickly with lots of families and a whole mix of just really happy people getting their brunch on. Food came out in decent time and when my friend saw the size of the nachos she wanted my frittata instead. It was her birthday so I was more than happy to give her my plate. She really enjoyed the frittata and I thought the breakfast nachos were quite tasty. Large freshly fried nacho chips with heaps of guacamole and toppings. So filling. This is a great clean and fun place to go out for brunch especially for large groups. The place is quite big. What made this place really stand out for me was that my friend wanted to see the curtains over by the kitchen ( she's into interior decorating ) and the manager and waitress happily walked her over to let her take a closer look. Which I thought was very thoughtful and kind of them. Prices are moderately on the higher side, but for the quality of food and great service it was worth it to me.

Oh, and could the name be any cuter? I had the opportunity of dining here with two of my favorite girls, Lily and Teresa. We all love food, so we get along pretty well.

You start your meal with some rolls and crisps and white bean dip. Yum. We tried the CHARCUTERIE PIZZA (the cured meats and Bellweather Farm ricotta were wonderful, fennel was a little overpowering), TURKEY BOLOGNESE (this was yummy; ground turkey with organic farro pasta, that really great ricotta again, and fresh basil), and ROASTED CAULIFLOWER (major yum factor and this was just a side dish!). We also enjoyed our specially-crafted cocktails.

Prices are a little steep and even though everything was delicious, all of us felt that it just warranted a shrug. We just weren't wow-ed. The menu is fun and their ingredients are inspiring, so I definitely want to try other items.

I got the turkey meatballs and my husband got the New England fry for apps, we got grain power (salmon with quinoa, avocado, etc and chicken sandwich for main courses which we spilt half half so we got a taste of each and for dessert I got the strawberry shortcake and hubby got the brookie (brownie cookie). Everything was seasoned well and tasted great, I don't have a bad thing to say any of the dishes we got. I feel like we got them at a steal of a price for $20 per person. I'm so full and seriously thinking about a nap right now. We talked about going back next week just to have the exact same meal again before restaurant week is over, it was that good. The only thing i wish it was so far from us, we live in Henderson.

The drinks were AMAZING I had the berry drink and the green drink made from fresh green juice made earlier that's day. Plus we tried their signature honey salt drink, it was great.

4744384,2012-10-30,14,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt is the newest restaurant to open in Summerlin, tucked away in the corner suite that was once occupied by Nora's Wine Bar at the NW corner of Rampart and Charleston.  Offering a menu inspired by comfort food with farm to table ingredients, as well as a seasonal cocktail menu, I can easily see this restaurant becoming a locals favorite.

There are three menus that are available depending on the time of day you dine in.  Lunch is served from 11:30am - 3:00pm (http://honeysalt.com/menus/lunch-menu/), dinner is served from 5:00pm till closing (http://honeysalt.com/menus/dinner-menu/), and there is an ""in-between"" menu served between lunch and dinner that seems to be a scaled back offering of the lunch options.  I stopped in during lunch and dined at the bar, where I started with a Midnight Rambler: a specialty cocktail made with bourbon, bitters, honey and orange peel.  The honey added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the drink without overpowering the bourbon; my kind of drink!

For lunch I had their Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich: creamy slaw, durkees dressing, brioche roll, served with a chopped salad (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/honey-salt-las-vegas?select=lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ#lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ).  This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.  There are two pieces of chicken that are lightly breaded and very juicy, which gets complimented by pickled and mustard flavors from the other ingredients.  It's one of those dishes that is so good that I'll have to convince myself to order something else the next time I visit...

A big surprise was the salad that is served with this sandwich.  Don't let the ""chopped salad"" description fool you, it's a salad served with cubed cheddar, edamame, carrots, radishes, avocado and I think kale.  Very good salad that came together well texturally; I would order this on its own if I wanted a lighter meal.

Overall Honey Salt screams quality.  I'm pretty darn sure this review will get bumped to 5-stars after I try some more things on the menu.  Will they be successful?  Time will tell.  Or you could listen to me and eat there now, before word spreads and you're no longer able to walk in without having to wait for a table.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,33,23,4,vLlMeq1ZgJnwoS2NLDAQ1w

The outside seating area is so cute, something you dont find too often in Vegas off the strip.  There's an adorable little green fence around the table with beautiful strings of light above.  The interior decorations are perfectly adorable and chic as well.  Be sure to try the taffies and the salt scrub in the bathroom, it is AMAZING.  My first time I went for lunch, second time dinner.  I was rather surprised at how well the restaurant transforms from a cute place to a nicer, more romantic. and chic place at night.  The lunch and dinner menu are different.  I currently like the lunch menu more, it has more variety for sure.  That being said, I have only tried three things on the menu so who am I to place a judgement? For lunch I had the Ahi Tuna salad and it was GREAT. plenty of tuna (that was of very good quality might i add), fantastic dressing, and it did not feel heavy or too rich, eespecially for lunch.  The bread and crackers before hand came with their special butter, it was all quite delicious!! I split bread pudding for desert and it did not disappoint one bit.   Rich, fresh, and flavorful, with the perfect amount of mascarpone on top.  Both times I had coffee which was great.  I am usually pretty picky about my coffee! The second time I came for dinner and had the shrimp alfredo.  It was certainly good, but I did expect more flavor.  It was intensely salty however;, and for me that is saying something because I usually love lots of salt on my food.  That being said, my servers and bussers were FANTASTIC both times.

When we arrived the children's menu was less the. A children's menu.  The items on the menu were priced $1-2 dollars less then the regular menu.  $9 for a kids cheeseburger then an additional $3 for a kids drink is not very child friendly.

When my boyfriend and I walked in the place was full and there were a few parties waiting to be seated. I went in the middle of them and approached the host stand. She greeted me for a minute but I am not sure if was her boss or just a co worker she started talking next to her in her ear and she finally realized we were still standing there. I asked if it was going to be a long wait and she said we will seat you don't worry. I thought the response was strange but I said ok. It was less then 2 minutes of wait and she responded with an apology. I think restaurant week had the place a bit overwhelmed. Ignoring that part the waiter and busboy were very friendly. I ordered the free range chicken breast and my boyfriend the salmon. Both we were extremely pleased. One note, I ordered the side of Mac and cheese along with the chicken breast that the waiter informed me the chicken came already with. I am so glad I ordered the side though because the au jus sauce the chicken comes with made the Mac and cheese in the entree just taste like pasta. The side was so much more flavorful.

On our last day in Vegas, we were all burnt out. But luckily, we found a bit of charm.

Honey Salt is that upon first glance. You walk in, and it's like going to your mother's house. But let's assume your mother is white, southern, and is best friends with Trisha Yearwood. It was modern country chic in Vegas, something that I was glad was not overrun by being on Las Vegas Boulevard.

I had:

*Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken - $13
It was a delectable sandwich who didn't miss a mark on offering an experience. I always say that a restaurant truly has guts for carrying such an item, and they didn't disappoint. A wealth of ingredients in a beautiful chopped salad that was used to accessorize a glorious chicken sandwich. Battered chicken that was not too heavy but not too light with a great slaw sandwiched between a brioche bun.

Lunch companions did the Backyard Favorite Burger and the Street Tacos as well with no complaints.

Food to back-up a beautiful space made for a wonderful experience.

Service did not also disappoint, Nicholas was friendly, polite, and had personality. It's a local spot for sure as it is off the strip, on this Monday it was Summerlin Ladies who lunch (we saw your champs, girls).

Will definitely be back for sure. A spot not to miss.",qGi0xjK3HM3Lfr6kSwKZdw,1,0,5,uOjvkzsyZto7GiD02gW53Q
4813951,2017-02-23,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I couldn't find a place that offers brunch with bottomless bubbles on a weekday. Honey Salt doesn't either, but they do offer bottomless bubbles for lunch, which is good enough.

Their ""All You Can Drink Bubbles"" for $18 include a mimosa mixed with either orange or blood orange juice, or peach purée.

If you're hungry, ""Honey Salt Power Lunch,"" which includes an appetizer, entree & dessert for $21, is the best value. I suggest the ""Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich."" I ordered the ""Lump Crab Lettuce Cups,"" which were delicious, but for $16 & only given three, definitely not satisfying.

I have been to Honey Salt twice, both on a Monday around noon. The service is very slow, which I could understand if it was packed, but it's a ghost town. They could not keep up with how much champagne we were drinking & never provided enough for everyone each time they refilled it. The last time I went with a group of 6, we had to flag servers down a lot & were there for almost 4 hours.

Our server was Adrian and he was excellent. We had a few questions and he answered them promptly. My wife and mom had the seared scallops and they were cooked just right. Seared outside and my mom wanted hers cooked all the way while the wife wanted them cooked the way the chef recommended, a little raw on the inside. The sauce on them was very tasty. I had the strip steak with heirloom carrots and smashed fingerling potatoes. Steak was ordered medium but was medium rare. I've found that's how it is most places, so I like medium rare but if you order that you get essentially a raw piece of meat so I now order medium and most of the time I get what I want. Carrots were good and potatoes were out of this world. Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Chimmichurri sauce was drizzled around the plate and was really good.

First off, the personal touches from the bath salts in the bathroom to the custom napkins, and the little items for sale in the front. LOVE.

For the food, I think it may be hit or miss. Clarice C and I shared the French toast and the fried chicken sandwich. Pretty sure the fried chicken sandwich was the best sandwich I've ever had! The side salad had really fresh ingredients and great flavor. I wasn't too crazy about the French toast and found it rather soggy. 

The employees were really friendly and focused on making sure that all the guests felt welcome and seemed very knowledgable about the menu.

Overall, Honeysalt has a lot of personality and I think the food has a lot of potential; it'll just require another visit!",7Q6nBHl6NJ9gbJ900FkkAg,4,1,4,Er5S7HlAKbF9CBRn5uWzYA

I got the seared scallops in truffle sauce.... To die for! They are slightly pricey but they are worth it. They melt in your mouth! I'm dreaming of them right now. 
I also got the calamari. Perfectly fried goodness. I loved the sauce they came with. 
The last thing I ordered was the tuna taretare. Very delicious as well. Sometimes at other restaurants they dress it in a lot of sauce and you can't taste the tuna that well but the sauce here made the tuna shine. 

Overall I would def come back! This place is nice for date nights. It has really cute decor, and is lit very dimly.",UzcvzQlG7jsVGIsI4H7cIg,1,1,5,7lFCi0Tf2JzE9YvHweuG5g

There's currently construction going on around it, but it's still open and fully functional. The place is very homey on the inside, with a cute mini boutique when you walk in. They sell unique gifts, including bottle lamps, salt and pepper shakers, recipe books, etc.

The food itself was well prepared. I got the biscuits and gravy, which was delicious. I enjoyed the broccoli that came with the entree, as it added an interesting touch. The coffee was the best (I don't even like coffee and I liked their coffee).

Overall, great place with friendly service & yummy food. Wait is long but worth it! Would return the next time I visit Vegas, if I have the means to get out here again.",97SsUShPcqF71hX7Nrvq4w,0,0,5,dyP_-GAbO8IwdCLS5vqPcA
4843250,2014-05-05,6,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Oh, the hype!  I had wanted to like Honey Salt; I really did.  Don't get me wrong; they do not serve bad food.  They just serve it in flavors that are catered to palates that hardly ventures out the perimeter of Summerlin. 

Upon arrival, we found the outdoor dining area to be directly outside the entrance of the restaurant.  They picket-fenced the area and hung christmas lights overhead, but it still seemed odd to be fifty feet away from Talbots (a women's clothing store).  I do give them credit for trying though. 

Upon walking in, the bar sits on the left and the dining area sits on the right with the open kitchen toward the back of the dining area.  The decoration is a relaxed chic - California style with a Hampton twist.  I like it very much; it's tastefully done but not so much that it feels pretentious, which is what seems to be what Summerlin is all about, unfortunately.  (Tivoli Village, anyone?)  

We waited at the bar for our entire party, and the bartender was very nice.  I tried the Garden Mule, and it tasted like a mojito to me.  It had a huge basil leaf in the drink, and I am not sure if the basil was not washed properly, but my drink had this pesticide taste to it.  (Know what I'm talking about?  I may be crazy, too...)  I took the basil out, and over time, it tasted better...  Not sure if it was the removal of the leaf or as I was finishing the drink...

The staff at the bar was very nice and offered us water and all the things a good bar offers.  No problems there. 

Upon being seated at our table, we were greeted by Casey right away.  We were explained the menu, and Casey was extremely helpful with the wine selection of the night.  We went with the Nobilo Icon Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2012 at the price of $43 a bottle. 

Now getting down to business. 

The bread basket was good.  Nothing to write home about, but I must warn you about how good the butter is.  Beware, because you will want to eat the butter with a spoon.  

""Getting Comfortable"" (that's what they named the appetizers:
We had the England Fry and the octopus.  The octopus was good, but it was not spectacular (and not for the price either).  It's good enough to share between two persons.  The England Fry was nothing special at all, and I mean nothing.  I can make better shishito peppers at home...  and find much better calamari and fried clams elsewhere!  

Everyone I talked to raved about the scallops, I had the scallops.  For $31, you get six scallops (which is more than you usually get at other places) and a handful of cauliflowers.  The scallops were cooked right, not over or under cooked, but it was, once again, uneventful on the palate other than the overpowering truffle sauce.  If you like truffle, then you may find this dish fulfilling.  But I personally like my seafood with a hint of truffle, as how truffle should be... 

The bf had the sea bass, and as soon as the dish arrives at the table, I knew it was going to be not good.  It looked dried and overcooked, and it tasted like it.  I was not at all impressed with the sea bass at all.  I would not recommend it unless dried fish is what you like. 

One of our friends had the duck confit salad, and it looked boring, which I personally think it's hard for a duck confit salad to look boring.  It's duck confit!  I digress... 

Our other friend, the husband of the friend who got the duck confit, had the curry.  It did not seem like he was ecstatic about the curry.  His wife actually literally said it tasted like ""dirt.""  To reflect accurately, she did say that she does not like Indian curry.  

All in all, was Honey Salt terrible?  No.  It obviously has its redeeming qualities to deserve a 2-star from me.  I think the owner scaled the flavors of the food just right for the Summerlin clientele. (If you do not know what I am talking about, maybe you'll like this restaurant, and I encourage you to try it!)  

However, I am afraid Honey Salt can be easily overlooked for another ""trendy chic locally grown restaurant"" that seem to be sprouting up in the Summerlin area left and right.   

I personally, unfortunately, will not be coming back soon...",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,10,4,2,pj2OOwqTtwmPHj87UVIzGg

In the ladies room, there were hotel keys all on the wall and it made me happy to see Disneyland hotel keys. haha. 

Anyway, enough about the bathroom, let's talk food. 
I ordered the grilled chicken and it was okay. There wasn't enough sauce on there for me to dip the chicken into and so I had to carefully calculate the amount of sauce I put on my chicken, but the last bites of my chicken were very dry. There were mac 'n cheese beneath my chicken served with some veggies. Those two soaked all the sauces in, and I'm pretty sure that's why there wasn't enough sauce for the whole chicken. I also think it's pretty pricey for the food they serve.. 
Our server didn't really check up on us, he just kind of walked around and asked us how we were once throughout the whole night.

An immediate plus is that the ingredients used are all artisanal, farmers market products or grass fed all natural meats.
Had the grilled octopus (nice big chunks of tender octopus) and Caesar salad as starters, margherita pizza (probably least interesting dish) and Carmelized Sea Scallops, which were very good but had just a touch too much vanilla.

I was torn between two choices. I didn't know if I wanted breakfast or lunch. I either wanted the blueberry pancakes or the Barely Buzzed Chedder Sandwich. Since I was more in the mood for breakfast I went with the pancakes. That means I need to go back for lunch! :) 

The pancakes were awesome. They were drizzled with lemon sauce which I love because blueberry and lemon flavors go so well together! The portion was just enough. I felt satisfied but not overly full.

4938530,2015-02-02,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Unfortunately this review pertains only to the service of Honey Salt as we chose not to eat at the restaurant after our experiences with the staff.  We were in town visiting last weekend and were excited to try out Honey Salt based on their Yelp reviews.  We had made a reservation for 7:30pm, but as our plans changed, we arrived early at 6:30pm.  We knew that it would be at the height of the rush hour, but thought there was a chance that somewhere in that next hour they could fit us in.  We waited.  And waited.  Were ignored - and waited.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we asked how much longer it would be and were told that they needed to fit the 7pm tables - got it.  Waited.  Between 7:15-7:20, our patience began to expire as our original reservation time was approaching.  When we asked how much longer it would be, we were met with attitude and excuses about why it was taking so long - not once was there an apology, and not once did they acknowledge us.  We were made to feel like the unwelcome guests - like more of a nuisance than appreciated customers.  At this point we notified the manager that we were leaving, and were again met with abrasion and excuses.  To the manager's credit, he did give us a call some 10-15 minutes after we left to 'give us his number,' at which point we let him know all of this could have been manged with a simple apology or acknowledgement of the situation on their par - it was far too little too late.  Very disappointing as the food looked great.  I think this place would have been awesome if it didn't have its head stuck up its rear end.",AHcl0IosnAaPzJOMZZ_RWg,0,0,1,6_qUmVx2Aj8nGYci9tl5qQ

Our waitress recommended a seasonal apple cider Sangria and to be honest I regret her pleasant recommendation. By far the worst Sangria I've tried.

The Truffle Grilled cheese was absolutely amazing and I enjoyed every bite. Worth every calorie!! $13

I ordered the Weekend Fritatta (w/o chicken) and it was pretty bland. $14

My first time sampling Monkey Bread and it was delicious. $9

Dessert was a bread pudding banana foster with ice cream and it was warm sweet and yummy!

4958326,2014-08-13,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Had dinner at Honey Salt on a Wednesday.  It was slow before 7, but after that the place filled up.  The restaurant got loud, annoyingly loud, as it became full.  It was a little hard to have a conversation at our table of 7.

To start, I had Elizabeth's Caesar salad.  This is a large appetizer salad made with a combination of kale and romaine.  The dressing is nice and garlicky, moreso than typical Caesar dressing.  There is a lot of parmesan, and it's good quality parmesan.  It adds a lot to the salad.  I'd order this again.

I went with the free range brick oven chicken, which is served with the Anaheim pepper mac n cheese and kale.  The chicken has nice crispy skin, and was sufficiently juicy.  The mac n cheese was good, but it was just that.  It wasn't memorable, and it didn't have much pepper flavor for me.  The overall meal was put together well, and the components went together to create a solid dish.  But, it just didn't blow me away.

Service was decent, but like I said, the place was very crowded after 7 pm.  So, it's understandable that we didn't see our server every 5 minutes.  He was friendly, and the other wait staff was pretty good with water refills.  I'd return.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,6,2,3,WOIIRwJ6JVdPwqILiJPedA

Everything here was average, nothing spectacular or outstanding. Service was ok, the food seemed to be slightly undercooked and had a couple of odd combinations. 
   First we had the New England Fry: Calamari and Clams fried in a batter with what looks like an aoili sauce. I didn't have the crispness on the batter and both were raw.
   For dinner I had the snapper which was good, but they added a marinated eggplant that just seemed to throw the plate off. My girlfriend had the scallops which were also good, but seemed to need to be cooked about a minute longer. We added the garden vegetable which were green beans, snap peas and pea lentils. They added a little mint, which was pleasantly surprising, but still left me feeling like it needed to be cooked just a minute longer. (In their defense, the waitress did say that it's slightly sauteed).
 
  All in all, it was an average meal, but this place should have $$$$ next to it as this and 1 glass of coke and a sangria costs $120 with tip! I would have been a bit happier if I had paid $60-$70.",Sgsdctj3N6ZsjcFIQIHKjA,1,0,3,TbFpjz1mfT-FDNVuNnvrEQ

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Curry and unfortunately he was no too impressed with it. The sauce was thin like soup, and we are a very critical couple when it comes to curry. We've tried all types and we prefer curry with thick sauce so that was one thing I would mention if thinking of trying the curry. The flavor was good though. 

The Big-Eye Tuna Tartar was pretty darn delicious too. It also had quinoa, but a crunchy version. Double yum! And dessert was great too.

This is almost as good as it get for Las Vegas.  Most of the large establishments on the strip are very good but generic... or what I call crowd pleasers.  The menu here isn't large, but the flavors were excellent.

Server (Monica) was excellent.  They had 2 parties of 25 come in just before us and they managed to get our food to us in a very timely manner... drink too a few seconds longer but she pushed to get ours through before the huge party!  And she didn't have to tell me... I saw it happen.  

Octopus was great.  I was nervous because the pieces were slightly larger so they tend to be tough and chewy sometimes but they were perfectly done.  

I also had the chicken curry, which was wonderful.  Great flavors.  No complaints :)

I really liked the cooks attention to detail and the fact that they didn't really play it too safe.  Most dishes had a variety of flavors (sweet, savory, salty, etc.) which can be hard to do.  For example, I think (not 100%) they had a honey butter with olive oil and sea salt... great combination.

The Brookie alone would have been enough to give five stars. The following few times I went, the service was terrible.

My most recent visit was to try their new three course tasting menu for meatless Mondays.  I have been seeing great vegan and vegetarian menu options at my favorite restaurants lately and was excited to try what honey salt came up with. Let's start with the food...

Our first course was a green juice in a very tiny glass. It is the same juice they serve on their brunch menu and was good as usual. Our second course was a mushroom dish that literally had two mushrooms on a plate. They were seasoned well but, seriously, it was two mushrooms. The next dish was a risotto that was horribly undercooked and chewy. It was pretty plain and topped with a handful of peas. Desert was a bowl of mixed fruit that included moldy raspberries. To top all of this off, our server made us feel like circus freaks for ordering this menu. Sorry, honey salt, people who eat plant based diets are not weirdos and do enjoy eating actual food.

We were told once we got in that we would have to wait because they had to check on their reservations for the night???? Hmmm. Ok, I guess they get busy. So they did sit us around 10 minutes after we arrived. We ended up sitting at our table at least 20 minutes. There were people that had gotten sat after us that were getting served. We started giving dirty looks to anyone we could and were just about ready to throw in the towel and leave. Finally one of the waiters.. that we were giving dirty looks to.. came over and asked if we had been helped. So, he got a waitress to come over and take our order. We ordered some drinks which i cannot recall the names but where pretty tasty. We ordered a fllet to share. The filet was cooked well. I was not too impressed with he potatoes on the bottom as they appeared to be a large smashed tatter tot. I also got the orange zest edibame which was good but appeared overpriced at $7. We next ordered the apple pie desert and the brooklyn brownie. The brownie with the cookie that I read so much about.. was ok. It didn't knock my socks off or anything. The apple pie desert on the other hand was delish. It comes served which looks like a paper bag around it. 

The decor was modern. Liked the funky mirrors hanging all over, the salt in the bathrooms for hand washing and the old looking lamps to light the place. They do have a cute patio area which no one was taking advantage of.. I guess it was still in the 60 out so probably not too appealing for many. 

It was also interesting to check out the crowd.. as I sat waiting to get served for 20 min.... there was a good mix of people dressed to the nines and people dressed in sweat pants. So come and wear what you like!

Taking up fellow Yelpers' recommendations, my wife and I, along with a friend, went to Honey Salt for late lunch on a week day near the end of March. We are so glad we did, as we really enjoyed our luncheon experience in this charming restaurant, which offers good food, comfortable ambience and excellent service! 
 
After getting through its entrance door, we were cheerfully greeted by its friendly hostess. We were very pleasantly surprised by its spaciousness and its casually comfy and ""pop-artishly"" elegant decor, not to mention its beautiful bar with large marble counter. Around 1:30pm on a week day, the place was almost full, especially at the bar - A good sign!

The free bread basket was very good. For our late lunch, we had Fried Clam/Calamari appetizer ($14) to share, which was very tasty with a seasoned light batter.
- Backyard Favorite Burger ($13) cooked to order. Our friend loved it, saying that it was juicy, tasty and cooked to perfection for her. She cut a piece for me to try, and I totally agreed with her.
- Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($13), which was good with tasty batter, but the chicken breast itself was a bit too dry for my liking. I had to ask for some honey muster to dip the chicken in (Not a bad idea, I might add!). This entree also came with a chopped salad which was very fresh.
- My wife had the Steak House Salad and was impressed how tender and juicy the steak was, as well as how FRESH and delicious was the salad! My wife is critical of any food. So, when she said it was great, I believed her. Besides, she wouldn't let me be my own judge of that by offering me a piece of the steak anyway!

- To top our meal off, we enjoyed sharing an apple pie in its own hot dish with a scoop of icecream on top ($9). The pie tasted heavenly, especially over a cup of coffee or tea!

Throughout our meal, our waiter was very attentive; other serving staff kept our glasses of ice water and coffee cups full; cleared our finished plates at the right time - all without our asking. Wonderful! 

When we were leaving around 3pm, the dining room was still about half full. The friendly hostess came by to say goodbye and told us about their menu for brunch and dinner. She also showed us their small patio outside of the entrance door - which we had missed earlier. She sure did make us feel welcome. 

Getting out of the door, we also overheard another customer saying something to the hostess, seemingly something about their impressive restrooms? - Hmm...that's intersting! As none of our party visited the restrooms that day, I couldn't help but wondering...!

We loved this place, at least for lunch, and will definitely go back to try out its dinner menu; well, also to find out what makes their restrooms so impressive? 

AN APPEAL TO THE MANAGEMENT:
- I do so wish that Honey Salt would offer HAPPY HOURs! It has such a nice bar and a good drink menu, and yet, no Happy Hour? PLEASE!?

5029226,2013-06-29,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I was very excited to eat here last night as I had been wanting to for awhile now. The ambiance is very cute! Really exquisite yet simple decor. Outside, they have the cutest patio seating with lines of lights strung above overhead the tables. Unfortunately, there is a heatwave in Vegas so no one really wants to be out there in 117 degree weather, but I could imagine it being nice in beautiful weather. I was happy to sit on the cushioned couch inside complete with a couple plush pillows to lean back on. 

Our waiter was really nice and quite fashionable with his wrist accessories, but wasn't the best server I've had in my opinion. He informed us of all the ingredients coming from local farmers markets and from Pahrump. Everything is organic which I thought was awesome! Our bread selection was delicious and they brought out an interesting dish which I asked our busser what it was since I couldn't grasp what the flavors were. It turned out to be white bean purée with some fresh red chili peppers mixed in. Really yummy! My friend ordered Magic Hat beer and the waiter brought him a sample before bringing him a glass of it which was really cool.

For our dinner appetizer we shared the steak tartare. I was very impressed with this dish. The mix of flavors with the papaya...FANTASTIC. I've never had anything quite like it before. 

For our entrees, we took the waiter's recommendation of one of their most popular dishes which is the baked scallops. I've had some pretty good scallops at various restaurants, but these just melt in your mouth! Highly recommend it. Some people may not find it filling to their senses however, just to warn you if you are a heavy eater. 

For my dish, I ordered the oven-baked free-range chicken that had mac and cheese mixed with pepper and kale topped with brocollini. Sooo good! The chicken skin was surprisingly crispy which I love and the meat itself was good, but not the most tender I've had. 

For dessert we opted for the warm bread pudding with honey and salt whipped cream. It's very good and quite filling so it's good to share between two people! 

Overall, I had a pleasant dinner here and was happy with my visit. I wouldn't mind coming back again.",runIV_idgvT6jeNcT1CyMQ,3,2,4,ujGcK52T0a9dO0RrgHIYAw

Tonight, this was another opportunity to Yelp a potentially fantastic place, so I wasn't going to turn this down at all! This restaurant is located on the other side of the valley butt I've heard amazing things, so I needed to see this place for myself.  

First off, let's talk about the mall this restaurant is in.  What a beautiful place!  Soo different from what I'm used to in Hendo.  Summerlin and Boca Park really shows it's money!  When you walk up to the restaurant, you can tell it's going to be amazing.  There's an outside patio lined with picket fences with lime green chairs and tabletops, sheltered with oversized white Christmas lights.  My description makes it sound cheap, but soo not the case.  It was super whimsical and created a VERY romantic feel.  When you walk in, you'll notice a cute bar to the left, merchandise wooden shelves to the right and a beautiful restaurant ahead.  Exposed brick wall, low chandeliers, dim romantic lighting, a montage of framed mirrors.  What an amazing look and feel!  The table tops were chunky wooden tables, only helped build amazing character.  Our server was extremely detailed and attentive.  It seemed like there was a server and server assistant.  We were always helped on.  One thing I noticed:  They refresh the entire table before each course.  Everything!  Down to the utensils.  Their dishwasher must be working overtime.  

Speaking of food, the servers first brought a basket of ciabatta type rolls and cheesy bread crisps.  The star of the show was definitely the honey butter with EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil). I literally wanted to spoon that by itself.  It was so delicious. Butter seemed whipped, sweet and the oil brought another creamy element.  So good!  For appetizers, I got the New England Fry for $15.  It was Ipswich clams and calamari, fried, blistered shishito peppers grilled and served with a sriracha-lime aioli.  WHAT AN AH-MAZE-ING app!  The batter was light, the aioli was insanely delicious and long stalks of peppers offered so many different textures and flavors.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  For dinner, I got the Braised Beef Short Ribs for $29.  A nice portion of tender short ribs, served over a bed of creamy polenta and topped with a carrot and baby mixed green salad.  The short ribs.  OH-EM-GEE.  The short ribs were fantastic!  Super marbleized and sooo tender!  There was a brown gravy reduction over it and brought a nicely salted flavor to the meat.  You literally could cut it with a butter knife.  The polenta was creamy and delicious.  Great side dish to the meat.  It was flavorful, yet didn't steal the show.  The carrot salad was accompanied with a balsamic reduction and the baby mixed greens offered a light and crispy texture.  Man, this dish was off the chain.  It was so good, I NEED everyone get their butts in and try it. 

The entire experience that night was top notch.  Every detail was not left behind and super appreciated.  Even when they brought our checks, they put the bill into a note book, full of little drawings and poems, written by other restaurant guests.  Not to mention the bathrooms have an exfoliating coconut salt mixture for you to use on the way out.  This is the ultimate date night experience. You NEED to take them here, trust me! If you're ever in the area, please, please try them out.  Honey Salt, thank you for an amazing experience!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,4,2,5,pYqiZ-zLmVkcym_nePscNQ

They forgot the egg on the burger which we asked for twice, my flatbread/pizza was soggy and inedible after sitting there for 8 minutes like literally falling apart which is disappointing 

The interior is very cute. It's like a vintage rose/rustic theme. Their prices are fair but I could go anywhere hipster for cheaper food. Their lavash bread though on the other hand is fabulous. It's dry, flat, and cheesy which is perfection. I would comeback probably for drinks and a light snack to share with someone. Their dessert though is fantastic!!!!

They started us off with parmesan crisp and some whipped butter and some water. They gave us room temp and we had to ask for ice a few times as they brought some out a cup at a time to share among us six. 

I picked turkey meatballs for my starter. This was pretty good meatballs and the sauce it was in was solid. I liked the ricotta and the onions with it. It needed some yummy bread with it which it doesnt come with though.

Entree I had the Biloxi Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich. A bit messy to eat, but I liked the mustard dressing that was on the chicken sandwich. It came with a bowl of a chopped salad with kale, greens, avocado, what seemed to be raw squash cubes and creamy dressing which was just okay. Not a bad option, but nothing special. 

Dessert I got banana bread pudding which was a substitution since they ran out of one of the options. I love bread pudding and this was really friggin good. The only thing is I think it needs ice cream for contrast than just whipped cream. That was probably the best part of the meal for me and was better than the strawberry shortcake that was the other option. It was also a huge portion and I couldn't finish it, definitely enough to share. 

Service was alright, but good thing we weren't in any hurry to go anywhere.

Say yes to the 'Honey Salt Experience' - a charming term introduced to us by our equally charming server Adrian. What does this entail? 
1. Main of one of the recommended house favourites
2. Brookie (half brownie, half cookie, 100% delicious - comes with ice cream!)

Hubbers and I finally tried this place before embarking on our Christmas shopping adventure, and I can say with confidence we made a good choice. I had the special of the day - eggs benedict with shrimp, bok choy, roasted tomato hollandaise - and hubber had their fried chicken sandwich. We did not regret our choices. I don't even have a picture for you because it was all gone before I even thought about taking a picture. Uh, yea. 

If you're an eggs benedict fan (who isn't?) then you must try one of theirs. I really appreciated their take on hollandaise and the meal overall wasn't overly salty like a lot of other restaurants. Million thumbs up. Cosy, wonderfully decorated place with fantastic people working there. I'll definitely be returning to try their other dishes!

Tonight, we drove all the way out to give it another try and since it was 5pm on New Year's Day, we called first. The receptionist answered and immediately put us on hold for more than five minutes. We figured we'd just continue driving since the reason she didn't pick back up was because they may have been busy. The second we get to honey salt, we are told at 5:45 that they are ""no longer accepting guests"" due to it being New Years. First off, the receptionist should learn how to take phone calls better, secondly, if you're no longer accepting guests, lock your doors so people don't think you're still open for business, and lastly, it's Las Vegas for crying out loud... maybe you should consider adjusting your hours instead of closing at 5 and 6pm-you'd probably have a lot more business.

5094867,2013-09-15,13,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Cali cuisine in Nevada.  Why not.  Balanced, fresh, with the appearance of being healthy.  Ladies that lunch, not burgers and beer.

Note:  This review is based on multiple lunch and dinner visits (breakfast in Vegas, isn't that called lunch?)  

Food, if it sounds Californian, it's good.  Skip steaks, skip chops, pass on burgers.  Simples.

Standout starters include a toothsome grilled octopus atop a bed of fried potatoes topped by an earthy, nutty, peppery romesco sauce.  Excellent balance playing off the bitterness of the octopus.  The Tuna tartare, vibrant and refreshing.  Ginger, cilantro, soy and lime give it a great aroma and acidic zing, creamy avocado for richness and toasted quinoa to add welcome texture.

""My Wife's Favorite Salad"" an excellent interpretation of the classic arugula salad with duck confit topped with earthy pine nuts, tart cherries, and a light poached egg.  Duck fat and egg yolk; the perfect dressing.

For mains, the caramelized scallops are excellent.  Perfectly cooked, no little golf balls here.  The puree of cauliflower with vanilla and truffle sauce work so well to enhance the sweetness and oceanic flavor of the scallop while cloaking the dish in an earthy perfume.  My only complaint is how UGLY the presentation; a splat of pure, scallops tossed in, sauce dumped on the plate.  ""Mary's free ranged brick oven chicken"" over a kale and Anaheim pepper mac and cheese, very good.  Simple, well cooked chicken, moist and flavorful.  The mac and cheese rich with a good backbone of bitterness from the kale.  Complex.  Perfect foil.

If there is any weakness, it's the pizzas.  They are correct but uninspired.

Comfortable space with a homey feel.  Friendly off Strip service.  Even better off Strip prices.  Family friendly.

5100314,2012-11-20,3,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Kim Canteenwalla is the master behind Society at the Wynn and Elizabeth Blau is a restaurant consultant. This husband and wife tag team are the creators of Honey Salt. As a former Summerlin resident and current frequenter of Boca Park & Tivoli Village, I spend a few days out of my week chilling in Summerville. Variety-wise, Honey Salt adds to the rather short list of fine dining selections on the West side of town. Vintner Grill is in short proximity to Honey Salt, and they've definitely got some competition going. 

The night my friend and I went it was literally at max capacity. 99% of the tables were filled and the bar was topped out. The hostesses were a little less than hospitable when we mentioned we didn't have a reservation. I know, new hot-spot faux-pas but we made plans a little last minute! They squeezed us in anyways but they didn't seem particularly happy about it. Our server however was incredibly friendly! However, I had to ask for the wine menu about 3 times until it got to me... twenty-minutes later. 

It took a while but the bread basket finally made it to the table. It had a moderately impressive variety of breads served with a seasoned white bean puree. It was excellent with the crispy flat bread but didn't mesh with the potato rolls. But hey! I enjoyed this healthy alternative to thousand-calorie butter.

As an appetizer, we started with the beef tartare ($14). HS's interpretation is of a sweeter variety. They take filet mignon and mix it with egg yolk, pickled papaya, capers, and a thick soy sauce. You can really taste the flavors of the papaya pull through. I usually prefer a savory beef tartare but it was still pretty good.

I'm going to excuse the lack of timeliness on the short period of time they've been in operation. Our server was friendly in person but he rarely came to check on us and failed to let us know our food was going to take an age-and-a-half to get to the table. I ordered the sea scallops ($28) for myself. As we observed the restaurant operation fail, we weren't expecting any of our food to be cooked very well. But surprisingly, my dish was cooked perfectly! The scallops were served alongside charred cauliflower atop a bed of vanilla bean cauliflower puree. WARNING: If you don't like truffles, be sure to tell the server! This dish is served with a heavy, and I mean heavy, serving of truffle butter. My friend is really sensitive to truffles. But while he loves scallops, the truffles ruined it for him--they were everywhere! I on the other hand love truffles so I thought it was amazing. Unfortunately, the dish was finished with a sprinkle of rock salt. But not only did they put too much on there, the rock salt didn't dissolve fully so it was a little sodium-heavy. *crunch*

My friend doesn't eat red meat so he went with the the chicken ($22). Generally speaking, restaurants have a hard time impressing me with chicken. Chicken is so... lack-luster. But whatever they're doing to this chicken they better keep doing it. The skin was flavorful and crisp while the inside was moist and juicy. The anaheim pepper mac n' cheese was pretty good and it was served with some sauteed kale. One of the better chickens I've had and it wasn't even on the strip!

Other than the scruffy service and sodium overload, I love everything about this restaurant. The feel of the diners, food, and decor all work together to create a luxurious but comfortable eating experience. It makes you feel high-brow while still being down-to-earth--if that's possible. I'm sure it will take a month or two to get their bearings but I have high hopes for Honey Salt!",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,10,3,4,XPW3HAVZtSn4ZTMXazglOg

Decor: lovvved it... hommie... warm... comfy

Service was really slow at the beginning.  The busboy was very good about bringing us water and bread, however we waited for about fifteen minutes and there was still no server, so I had to ask the busboy for one.  All the servers in the restaurant seemed super rushed, yet none were rushing to help our table.

Finally when a server did come, he too seemed rushed, and mentioned that he was just helping out the actual server for the section.  I don't think our actual server came until the end.  Either way, all the servers were pretty scarce for most of the meal.

The beer list wasn't anything too special, so I settled on the cocktail: Salty Sun of a Gun.  Nice interesting bourbon based cocktail, however I normally like a stronger fuller taste.  More potent, maybe?

Charcuterie Pizza was spicier than I imagined.  Interesting taste though, as was the New England Fry.  Not your typical calamari dish.  There was a definite kick.  Oh, and the lemon aioli uhhhmayyzinggg...  I was taking the bread, and even my pizza crust and drenching it in the aioli.  

But the dessert, that's what took the cake - literally.  We ordered the Triple Layer Cake thinking it would be too sweet, but it was soo subtle.  In the finest sense.  All the flavors mixed together go so well together.

This is a family owned business and you can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients. Always a plus. 
I had heard a lot of hype about this place, but I'm usually not to keen on the ""new hip"" place. I hate going to newer restaurants when they're busy and just crowed with people. Of course, that's what they want :) I've had a lot of people tell me that they like places just because they're new and cool - not because of the food. So I was kind of nervous, especially because the food here is not on the cheaper side. 

For dinner we had - 

New England Fry - Clams and Calamari 
Caramelized Sea Scallops
Grass-fed Filet Mignon 
Side of their well known Kale and Anaheim pepper Mac & Cheese

I will tell you, I was not disappointed with ANY of the dishes. The clams and calamari were cooked perfectly and they weren't like rubber like you find at a lot of places around town. 
The Scallops where amazing. The had this vanilla bean cauliflower puree and true sauce that really made the dish absolutely delightful. 
The mignon was cooked perfectly as asked and have a very distinguished taste. 
And on to my favorite - the Mac & Cheese. Never have I had kale in my mac & cheese, but my goodness...it was quite a charming surprise! It has a nice spicy cheese sauce from the peppers and it so was nice and creamy. Perfect combination!

They have a really nice ""homey"" feeling to the restaurant. Very creative decor and they have good service. They were booked, so if you go in when it's that busy, do expect a bit of a delay. DEFINITELY make a reservation before going in for dinner. They also have a large variety of specialty drinks!

We found the entire staff to be extremely friendly and knowledgeable. There seems to be a great familial and friendly culture between the staff which explains the experience and the vibes.

For food we ordered the ""power grain"" chicken salad with quinoa, radish, cranberries, and lentils and the ahi tuna salad with sea peas, Asian pear, and spinach.

5158526,2018-04-09,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"We stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon. At first, we weren't sure it was even open because most of the plaza is getting a face lift and the construction is very apparent and fairly disruptive on that side. It was a nice day out, but the outside tables were empty because of said construction. Oh well, inside we went.

I was actually kind of surprised when we walked in. It's bigger than I expected, with various tables and booths. Also, a nice looking and well stocked bar. We were seated and our hostess was friendly. We were given menus and offered 3 different kinds of water. 

I ordered the green juice ($8), which was decent. And we inquired about the iced tea- made in house or from a fountain? I never really thought we got a clear answer.. Our very nice waiter seemed confused. Maybe it's how we worded the question. I still don't know the answer, though. 

The lunch menu was straight up disappointing and small as hell. As a person who doesn't eat gluten or dairy, there was only one appealing thing- the lemon chicken salad, hold the mozz, dressing on the side. My forever PIC ordered the Biloxi chicken sandwich with a caesar salad. The salad was average all across the board. I am borderline salty about paying $13 for cold, cubed chicken, canned chickpeas and sunflower seeds with olive oil and lemon juice as a dressing.. Oh wait- can't forget the scant pieces of avocado tossed in there. Alas; after a 90 minute yoga class, I was starving and ate it.

My forever +1's sandwich and salad looked ok and was reported as good. The chicken to everything else ratio wasn't as great as other reviews/photos had boasted. Although I will say, the side salad was generously portioned. It looked like it was more than half of my regular sized salad. Maybe it's to make up for the lack of protein. Oh, and none of our food was 'instagram worthy'.

This one guy who wasn't our waiter, and I don't think he was the bus boy either, refilled our glasses and was perfectly nice, but smelt like an ashtray. Totally reeked of cigarettes. Farm to table? Nah, tobacco field to table. 

Apparently brunch is where it's at here, but coming back for that or dinner (with lunch being totally out of the question) would be a hard sale for me.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,0,2,4st3rUElu6TIJyFusi875A

We weren't super impressed with the Mac and cheese
It had some kind of tangy flavor that just didn't sit right with us - although as a disclaimer: we are from the south and have a certain expectation with it comes to comfort food like that.

We arrived at around 4:45 and as we walked in we were looked upon by what turned out to be the manager (petite, dark haired female) I say looked upon because she didn't smile and/or greet us in a friendly manner at all, she looked annoyed and asked if she could help us..?? Well.. We would like a table for 2, please (duh). Instead of taking the opportunity to upsell appetizers and drinks until dinner service started at 5, she matter of factly told us the dining area was not open so we could not sit in there, she pointed to the small area on the bar side and told us we would have to sit there and we would have to order of the limited menu. Much to her dismay we sat down. 
This is where the 3 stars come in, Erik, our waiter more than compensated for the rude greeting. He was friendly and courteous, he EVEN let us order off of the dinner menu!!! He brought us some very refreshing White Sangria, an awesome salad for my friend and I to share and made recommendations for dinner which were delish. Overall the food was great, Erik was great!

5190760,2013-02-09,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"2.5 stars for their MEDIOCRE FOOD and SLOW SERVICE.

Went for dinner on Friday night. No reservation so that meant waiting an hour for a table. My advice, make a reservation!

The place was poppin. Packed indeed. Most hipster place I've been to in Vegas, like I've been transported back to Portland. Cute decor with nice artwork.

So after the hour wait, we are seated. Our waitress is very nice although the service for the rest of the night is quite poor. We have to ask for the bread, which is disappointing btw--4 large Doritos with 2 wheat buns...really?!  

FOOD ordered:
- New England Fry - fancy way of saying calamari rings: NOT GOOD. SO DISAPPOINTING. The batter was soggy and when you dipped the ring into the dip, it got stuck!! What a tiny bowl of calamari for $15.  First disappointment of the night!

- Scallops entree ($27?): 5 decent sized fishy tasting scallops. Very rich in flavor but they give you no side to enjoy it with! We ended up having to order mac & cheese on the side to go with it. 

- chicken + mac & cheese entree ($23): this dish is served with the chicken breast on a small pile of mac & cheese. Legit like 6 spoonfuls of generic mac and cheese. Kraft Mac and Cheese has more flavor. The chicken sauce was all on the bottom of the plate so I didn't get to dip the chicken into it until I had eaten most of it. Dish failure.

- mac & cheese side ($9): this was actually more tasty that the mac that came with my meal. We had a hard time flagging down our waitress to order this side.

Total bill, plus a few drinks came out to ~$100. After our plates were cleared, the waitress plopped down dessert menus in front of us without a word. As if we really wanted to stay for dessert.

BOTTOM LINE: over priced food, it was too busy in the place for us to receive good service.  

I'm sure others have had wonderful experiences here, but mine was not enjoyable.  I know they were busy, but you have to be able to provide good customer service during the rush...which Honey salt did not.

Yes Honey Salt is that good! The head chef here is a friend of a friend and is really cool and has a great pedigree. Another friend is actually friends with the owner, but that doesn't mean I'll be biased on my review though, as I prefer to be brutally honest.

As soon as you step inside, you will notice the great ambiance and the interior decor. The theme of this place is very quaint and romantic especially at dinner time. With the brick walls and candles, and friendly staff, you will feel right at home even if it's your very first time here. I've already heard good things about this place and was finally able to try it out, and I'm happy I did.

I ordered the New England Fry as a starter and the Mos-quito (mojito) and the Caramelized Scallops as my entree, also the New England Fry. The New England Fry was good but I've had better fried seafood in other places. The Mos-quito was a very refreshing drink and had a nice blend of sweetness and flavor. Caramelized Scallops had one of the best plate presentations I've seen in a long time and was literally the best scallops I've ever tasted. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I tried some of the Shrimp Linguini and it was very good as well.

The outside patio dining area would be great in spring but not during the cold winter here or hot summers. Also make sure you make a reservation in advance especially during the weekends for dinner because they tend get fully booked.",Hze9r06sEb-EXEFPwwBTIA,6,3,5,0OHd6Pzi3mZtkiHh6QCajA
5199245,2012-11-09,22,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"When I heard ""Chick-fil-A on crack"", the chicken sandwich at Honey Salt shot to the top of my gotta-try immediately list. I grew up in Georgia, so I grew up on the fil-A (wheat bun, extra pickles). I've even been to a Dwarf House. 

With two golden-fried chicken breasts, slaw, special sauce and pickles, the sandwich absolutely did not disappoint me. Sure it was a bit intimidating when it arrived in all of its 6-inch tall grandeur, but I gave it a good squeeze, cut it in half, and immediately devoured every last bite. It had a winning combination of sweet and sour, and the chicken was nice and juicy. For $13, I would definitely order it again and again. It is served with a side chopped salad that has some unexpected ingredients including kale. In case you were wondering, I ate every last bite of that too. 

The restaurant is open, airy and rustic. I can't get enough of such inspired spots. From the chairs to the napkins, you can definitely see that there is passion for what is being executed. It is perfect for lunch dates, moms, first dates and more. The also have patio dining, but you can't have alcohol outside. 

Service may have been a tad slow, but I think that will improve with time. 

I have also had the opportunity to sample a couple of other things, and from those, I would also recommend the scallops (the truffles really work in this dish), the curry (a sweeter variety, but good) and the tuna crudo as a starter.  

We will be back. Next on my list to try: Midnight Rambler. (It's their  bourbon cocktail.)",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,48,38,5,ON9ONnvnQ3PeaeDC71qMiw

I ended up sitting at the bar and having a kale caesar salad and a beer. I enjoyed the salad a lot and figured I'd find the time to give them another try.

So a few weeks later I came with my girlfriend and I'm super happy I did. The waiter we had was awesome and very friendly. He was also quite boisterous and even cheered some of our dining options. I had the scallops with cauliflower purée which were heavenly. The scallops were nice and flaky and moist. The cauliflower purée made me want to try my hand at something similar at home. I also got a side of the mac'n cheese. I consider myself a connoisseur of grilled cheese sandwiches and mac'n cheese, so believe me when I say it was good. It wasn't amazing, but the texture and sharp flavor of the cheese went well with the veggies.  To wash it all down, I had a cocktail with cucumber soda. It really hit the spot and went well with the meal.

Finally what great meal couldn't benefit from a little dessert. I got the salted caramel ice cream with was quite salty and delicious. I liked it a lot, but I have had better.

5251318,2014-02-05,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",5gGMfEiTpZaAGlpRcvCM4w,2,2,3,B4tz9-3R62_FFZDK5Ud0XA

5257742,2014-09-03,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"My actual experience here is more of a 3.5, but I'm rounding up.  

First the good: Despite being in a strip mall, the restaurant has successfully turned the interior into a nice dining space and even has comfortable looking outdoor seating for those times it's cool enough to sit outside.

The waitstaff was great - friendly, professional, there when we needed them, gone when we didn't.  We were a group of ten, and when we arrived they had set up a long table in a smaller section of the restaurant which gave us more privacy.

Food portions were reasonable, and the menu was well rounded.  The only drawback was the food itself.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either, and at these prices you'd expect something better.

I started with the wood oven baked prawns, which I asked to come out as my side with dinner since no one else was having an appetizer.  They came out ahead of the meal despite my request, and were fine but not spectacular.  Fifteen dollars got you four prawns.  The prawns themselves were incredibly fresh tasting, however they picked up almost none of the flavor of the seasonings.  I ended up using the sauce to dip my bread, just so I could taste it.

The roasted cauliflower was described as good - in fact it got one member of our party to change their mind about cauliflower - and the mac & cheese was tasty as long as you didn't get a bite with a piece of pepper (too spicy).

The bread - oh my god, the bread.  This may have been the best part of the meal.  Our server brought out plenty: fresh made rolls, baked together in little stars, and Parmesan flavored crisp flat bread, all served with a light whipped butter with black sea salt.  When we quickly ate our way through the first batch our server was happy to bring out more.  

For my main course I had the caramelized sea scallops ($31 for five scallops).  The scallops were nicely darkened on the outside and just slightly overcooked on the inside, but not to the point where it affected the flavor or texture.  These were deliciously sweet and large enough to be a decent main course.  They came with charred cauliflower (poorly seasoned - but better when dipped in the leftover sauce from my appetizer); vanilla bean cauliflower puree (delicious, but overpowering on the scallops so I'm not sure what it was supposed to be eaten with); and truffle sauce (mmm mmm good).

The desert offerings looked delicious, but I chose a tea instead.  My friends who had the chocolate ice cream and the strawberry shortcake both described them as good, but not great. 

Overall the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, great staff, and good ingredients.  Now they just need a chef who can live up to the rest.",NDfcFPPzHqvnCu9rEg2GfA,2,1,4,heSMJ_VLVDaFEVG9dKbL9g

Being that this was last minute plans, no reservations were made (which I highly suggest right now as they were supper busy when we arrived).  Thankfully, two people were just leaving the bar and the hostess snagged the two seats for us.  

The restaurant had a very open and well lit floor plan.  It was basically a large rectangle.  

The one page menu was great.  Very concise but still had many options.  We didn't have a terrible large amount of time to dine so we decided to skip the appetizer round.  My friend ordered the free range brick oven chicken.  The chicken was good.  It wasn't dry but it was basically rotisserie chicken.  What made the dish however, was the kale & Anaheim pepper mac n' cheese.  That was delicious!  I would definitely recommend getting the mac n' cheese even by itself.  I ordered the charcuterie pizza.  The dough was very good.  Thin and crispy just the way I liked it.  The only comment that I have for the pizza was that being charcuterie was in the name, it could have used more cured meats.  I would not have minded paying an extra $2 for more meat.  The description also said fennel salad on the pizza which I did not see and I do not believe I tasted anything like fennel on the pizza that night.  I think it would have been a great addition to have the salad on the pizza after it came out of the oven and perhaps a slice or two of the cured meat on top if the salad.

The service at the bar was wonderful.  Very attentive even as drink orders from the restaurant kept spilling in.  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and would definitely return (with a reservation) to dine again and try other items on the menu.",0fKCfLixNcnickTwCfwf0Q,3,2,4,xTgUPtNCBY6WLg3WKj6BVw

Warm Bread Pudding with Bourbon Toffee Sauce, Honey, and Salted Whipped Cream

Returning to dining after a bit of shopping our arrival at the highly touted Honey Salt for brunch was met by the expected crowd - the large, warm, and rustic dining room near full - but unexpectedly by one of the coldest hostesses I've ever encountered; enough that we nearly considered walking out until another young woman stepped in, welcomed us and assured us it would be only a short wait for a table, and subsequently seated us in the center of the dining room.  Say what you will about ""first impressions,"" this was the sort that most certainly stuck out and probably colored the rest of the 'experience' aspect of Honey Salt - service lacking in nearly all regards as our waitress, Julie, neglected both empty glasses and dirty plates as she bustled around the room.

Moving past service snafus to that which was presented on the plate I must say that things improved dramatically as soon as the bread basket arrived and focusing mostly on the sweet half of the menu crafted by Chef Esmeralda Serrano - whose work I was familiar with from her time at Tableau - every single plate that landed on our table was outstanding, particularly the Monkey Bread style sticky bun whose delicate balance of light acidity and sweet honey wowed with each bite and the thick, custard laden bread pudding whose richness found levity in a puffy cloud of whipped cream flecked with salt.  Not generally one to order savory at breakfast/brunch, it should be noted that even my friend's sliders were excellent - the beef so tender that it formed a sort of smoky stew/scramble with the fluffy eggs and cheese.

Having heard similar negativity about the service at Honey Salt I should only hope they iron out these kinks sooner rather than later because much like Raku this is cuisine more than capable of competing with the best of what can be found on the strip, but in order to be worth the travel a front of house matching the skills in the kitchen will be indispensable.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,3,3,PGkD79HWZYdZsi0pWJO6ZA

Dinner started at 5pm so we arrived at that time, so we thought. The young but nice hostess informed us that we were 4 minutes early so we would have to wait to be seated. ummmm k. We had a drink at the ever welcoming bar (great 4 minute early service). 20 min later we re-approached the hostess who sat us, the place was still rather empty.
     Bread and bean dip- divine. Ceaser- to die for. Chicken- amazing, juicy and crispy....How? Salmon- came super raw- like seared on one side for a few seconds raw, I showed the waiter (super amazing guy) I figured that is how the chef prepared the salmon. He said no, that it was raw and took it back. No worries, I sipped my wine and enjoyed the great scene. The manager brought the salmon back (over $20 plate)- same piece and seriously black- they just threw the same salmon on the grill and cooked the heck out of it, like it was some backyard barbecue! Seeing how it looked like a cat got at it I told the manager this won't do, just cancel the order.
   He returned a short time later and said the chef was sorry, that he is making a new plate. The manager was so sweet I didn't want to argue, he said he just wanted me to leave happy. YAY for customer service. The second salmon was PERFECT- so yummy. 
    Martinis are great too- Dessert was the BEST I have ever had (pumpkin cheesecake), like a delicious cloud in your mouth good. I can see how people don't agree with the price to food ratio- we left satisfied but not overfilled, we think it was because it was healthy food.

The last 3 times I've been there the waiters are lacking in customer service and never wait on you (no asking how your food is or if you need anything). I feel a SNOBBY vibe when I go here now and before it was very comfortable. The food is NOT CONSISTENT. I've had the scallops when they have been amazing and I've also had them when they have been rubbery. Whenever I order the grain power salad it's never consistent in portion size, the last time I took it to go, it wasn't enough food for a child, also the dressing sometimes has no flavor. For the prices they are charging (And NOT ORGANIC) I at least want my portion size to be consistent and the flavor to be amazing every time. I've also seen many times waiters or a random person garnishing the food with there bare hands and I don't think it's sanitary.
I will give Honey Salt another try, but not for a while.",G5aqrt4Mt-xqQXOwA0Uyxg,0,0,2,9-yophmv3aMw9D1UCYDS-A

For an appetizer, we tried the new england fry. The menu said it was clams and calamari, but I think there was only calamari. Not really a problem, but some notification would have been nice so I don't analyze my food wondering which is which. ""I'm pretty sure clams don't have spindly legs or look like O's."" Deductive reasoning at it's finest.

He had the caramelized sea scallops over a vanilla cauliflower puree and also a truffle sauce. The hint of vanilla and truffle provided a lovely earthy note.

I had the mediterranean sea bass over roasted mushrooms and wilted spinach. Perfectly crunchy skin with flakey moist fish, flavorful mushrooms and spinach. Just perfect, perfect, perfect!

Overall, I wouldn't order the new england fry again unless I was specifically craving fried calamari, but the entrées will surely be repeated again someday and suggested to others.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,4,2,4,US2gtaTy-j4HWY9lfBUHPA

Both came out quicker than our marys so not sure if the bartender was slammed or the food isn't that fresh. Both items were the only thing on the plates. Some type of garnish would have been nice.

Homemade strawberry ice cream, strawberry jam, fresh strawberries and mascarpone cream. The ""cake"" it came with was light. This was just fabulous! 4.5/5

The sandwich was on point. Juicy, crispy on the outside. The sauce was served on the side and it was this mustard-sweet concoction. There were two sweet pickle spears served on top.

My husband drinks an appalling amount of diet cokes every time we go out to lunch, and they must have brought him refills half a dozen times, which was impressive since the place was so busy.

The tortilla chips always stay crisp and they are bathes with this amazing gruyere cheese sauce and avocado and a mild roasted tomato sauce and topped with eggs to your liking.

5357403,2017-08-30,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"Honey Salt is a cozy little neighborhood restaurant located in Summerlin on the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston, featuring a farm-to-table inspired menu that balances amazing ingredients available for the Las Vegas foodie that wants a little more. The menu is great. If you are looking to try something traditional, then try the Grilled Scottish Salmon served with Artichoke, Spinach and Fingerling Potatoes, or try the Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast with a side of Mac n' Cheese, Kale and Anaheim Peppers Natural Jus. If you are looking to venture out and try something different then you need to try the Caramelized Sea Scallops with Cauliflower, Vanilla Bean and Truffle Sauce they are delicious and probably the best in town. Sides like roasted Rainbow Carrots seasoned with Spicy Honey, Curry and Rosemary, or the Cauliflower Couscous with Pine Nuts, Mint and Green Onion erupt with flavor. Lastly the homemade desserts and hand-crafted cocktails are delicious and should be given a chance. Now for the reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I'll start by saying that they used to be great but somehow have slipped dramatically in the past year or so. First they seem to have a plumbing problem that they can't seem to fix at the bar & restrooms. Some days are worse than others but the fact remains that there is a problem which doesn't sit well when you're wanting to eat. Second problem is that the consistency is almost gone. They have days that the food is delicious and reminiscent of the past and other days which are more often than not lately subpar and quiet frankly embarrassing considering their reputation. Third strike is the service and just like the food there are good days and bad. A few of the servers are amazing and not only do their job but do their job very well including picking up the slack and doing someone else's job when the other servers can't seem to pull it together. So I guess the question is why do I continue to go back? Well the answer is for a couple reasons. First is, even on a bad day the food is still better and healthier than most places in Summerlin due to their fresh ingredients. When a restaurant is using all fresh ingredients and their specialty is farm to table they simply blow away the competition even on the worst of days. It's like going to the grocery picking up wild caught fish, fresh organic vegetables driving home cooking it yourself, (even though you might not be a chef) and it'll always be healthier than any chain restaurant. So this is why I continue to eat at Honey Salt and always will until they really start to make unforgivable mistakes.",tUJJr2fvXDLbo34i3UGAvg,0,1,4,VX3zn1Zhg-UDdzkLlFWaSg

That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  

Again, overall the place is well lit and looks great.

Upon entering the vicinity, I almost felt like I am going on a cruise ship or I was on a boat? maybe cause of all wood & mirror that they had going on around the room.  I really liked their decor but there were some parts of the place that it did not flow quite well.    I don't really know if the restaurant is trying to go for a  ""down to earth"" or ""want to feel high-end but still have a casual feel"" style. It just feels pretty off. 

Ratings (out of 5)
Service (3.5) 
Been here a couple of times and the service was a hit-or-miss for me.  They all wear very casual attire, which i am not sure if I liked it, but there is that sense of personal feel when talking with the waiters because they feel really relaxed and they dont feel like they have to as professional as they should be.

Food (3)
I have ordered the calamari: it was greasy, bland, and not worth it at all! The portion was pretty small for the price.  I even tried squeezing some lemon over the calamari to add some taste, it did help but it was just way tooo greasy ! 
 
Next the backyard favorite burger with fries:  I did like it & it almost tasted like the burger I would get at holstein at the cosmo! The fries however was really soggy, i felt like it has been sitting out for a while :(  

Atmosphere (3.7)
Like I said earlier, I really liked it but it was off for some reason. But it does have that down to earth feel like im going on a cruise.  

Overall, 
I would come back and try other items on the menu such as the ""chick-fil-a"" & some meat entrees. :) It's a nice restaurant and i think everyone will enjoy their time here.",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,2,0,3,GYtUWHvmfXAUal6NtPP5eQ
5373386,2012-11-12,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I am teetering between a 2 and a 3 star review for Honey Salt. The food was overall enjoyable. The service was attentive in certain aspects, but the pace was truly horrific. 30 minutes before we received our first cocktails. 45 minutes before our food was able to be ordered. With our three course meal, the experience took three and a half hours. Good thing we were not on a time restraint. Normally, I wholeheartedly support the slow food culture, but I need an appetizer to come out in a timely manner to help quell the hunger. By the time the food started to roll out, we were enjoying the cocktails and each others company. 

Cocktails:

Mos-quito- A mojito made with ginger beer. It had a bite and the right amount of herbal notes to make it a refreshing drink.

Queen Bee- Sweet as honey and goes down like candy.

I forget the name, but it is made with jalapeno vodka, St. Germain, and cucumber soda. Hands down, the best. 

Bottles of wine are also very affordable. Going to Lee's to get a bottle of Nickel and Nickel ran about the same as us ordering it at the restaurant. 

Appetizers:

Steak Tartare- Group favorite. Even the anti-raw food committee enjoyed it. The best of all the first course dishes. With the bread, it helped to fill empty stomachs. On it's own, it is a parade for the taste buds.

Yellowtail Sashimi- I am not a big fan of this fish and still found the dish palatable. The slight spice of the radish and crispy of the jicama gave new sensations to a normally disagreeable taste.

HS Shrimp Cocktail- Once you have one, you have had them all. Nothing wow worthy.

Paleta Iberico Ham- All the components were there. They were all pleasant, but the minus eight vinegar was not as prevalent as we were expecting. 

Buratta Salad- I adore buratta. Mozzarella stretched, filled with cream and more soft cheese which oozes once cut. Delicious.

Margharita Pizza- Simple, classic, and not bad.


Entrees:

Caramelized Sea Scallops- Scallops are best when not cooked all the way through. Ours came out to the table at an odd temperature. The flavors were good, but the whole dish was cool. Do they cut their scallops in half? because the pieces looked small.

Scottish Salmon- Forgettable. The pitch is more impressive than the follow through.

Turkey Bolognese- Farro pasta cooked well and the blend of ingredients complemented each other well.

Free Range Brick Oven Chicken- It is hard to impress with chicken, but the skin on the bird was phenomenal. It was crisp and had a crunch that would rival a kettle chip. The mac and cheese needed a kick. When paired with the sweet pepper side, it was amazing.

12oz. NY Strip- By far, the best deal on the whole menu. It was tender, juicy, cooked to perfection, and cannot be beat at $28. 


Sides:

All of them, yet the sweet peppers were the only ones that stood out on its own or when combined with something else.


Desserts:

Tried them all, there was nothing super impressive. The bread pudding was the strongest offering. The bourbon toffee sauce was an essential factor.  I would have been happier with just sipping on the nutcello.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,10,2,3,i6s5PPi1w0mpIpsfbK1Cug

I ordered the caramelized scallops with truffle sauce and was on cloud 9 eating my fat and juicy, little butter pillows of taste bud delight.  My boyfriend on the other hand was suffering through the 4 course special with wine pairings.  First course was a bean soup served in an amuse bouche sized portion, then the mushroom risotto, which he didn't finish.  The main course was a steak paired with Cabernet.  He said the steak had no flavor and the wine tasted like a GSM instead of a Cab.  

His 4 course meal came with a dessert, but they had run out, so they offered free range of the dessert menu.  We chose the chocolate coconut cake, which was just ok.  Our friends dining with us ordered the Brookie, which is a chocolate chip brownie with salted caramel.  The ice cream alone was amazing!   

The place is in the former Nora's wine bar location across from Boca Park.  They have done a nice job inside with modern, but rustic secondhand style decor.  It's absolutely adorable and charming looking. 

Overall I was very surprised at what we discovered, because my boyfriend isn't a picky or fussy person at all.  In fact, he is just the opposite and I tend to be a bit more particular.  I'm kinda bummed because I would like another crack at those scallops and the Brookie dessert, but I don't think boyfriend would be overly excited by the idea.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,3,1,3,YXhbgyI_dmMucJMwBalQUw
5398711,2013-01-08,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"That chicken sandwich is no joke!!! I enjoyed this restaurant the week before Christmas with 4 others at lunch time. I had to try the chicken sandwich after reading the reviews on here of course! It came through with flying colors too. The taste was spot on, and the combination of crispy breading with crunchy cole slaw and pickles elevates it to another level. The most amazing part was the chicken itself. I don't know if it's because it's organic or what, but the chicken was so tender, juicy and full of flavor! I usually don't think of chicken as having much flavor, which is why so many sauces and breading are added, but this meat had actual mouthwatering flavor. The chopped salad that accompanied the sandwich was a very substantial side dish that could be equally successful as an entree itself. It was delectable and unique with the faintest taste of salad dressing. Chef Kim came over and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant being an inspiration of his and his wife's to expand their home entertaining. He pointed out furniture and a chandelier that came from their personal home. He also expressed their love of re-purposing furniture, and cited various items that had a previous history of serving another purpose. I absolutely loved that the bathroom walls are lined with plastic hotel cards (keys) to various destinations that the owners had traveled to. Some even had their names on them. 

The service was outstanding. The day I was there, the place was packed and the service still remained efficient and friendly. We all 5 left there amazed by our dining experience.

Overall, good food yet they were either understaffed, as restaurant was full, or they are slow at service, yet either way service needs to improve.

I consider myself pretty knowledgable about restaurants and food in general and I just consider my recent experience as unexciting. The food is a little on the expensive side (very comparable to strip hotel prices) and just blah. I understand this restaurant is big into the farm to table mentality (so over this catch phrase) and utilize mostly local vendors but really $170 for lunch for six with no apps or alcohol and one ate from the children's menu. Half of us had water, our splurge was a couple desserts.

   I guess the biggest letdown was the less than stellar food. My daughter had pasta with butter and cheese on kid's menu, no cheese and it was maybe 3/4 cup of pasta with olive oil salt and pepper, $8. Side of kids edamame, $4. Then my husband had the burger, $17, overcooked, forgot his bacon he ordered with it and the fries, well let's just say they need to change the fryer oil. So... While it was not awful, our lunch today was just very blah. In retrospect there are so many other places I would have rather spent my money.",1AjgRPD5b3eEs1jJ9jRftQ,5,5,2,XcsePuUnEWhEwUfLIXA4-A

Our party was seated quickly and service was just slow enough to allow for lots of conversation without dragging at all. The food was excellent, including the vanilla cauliflower purée that accompanied my scallops (everyone was surprised)!

All of their chicken dishes really were the stars of the show though, moist and tender from fried to brick, tangy and a little spicy from the curry. A real treat!

Another awesome point was that they had the salt scrub they sell ($30...so I didn't buy any) to sample in the bathroom and it was pretty phenomenal.

Waiter was very friendly and served our drinks quickly. Our Caesar salad was very good and fresh. There was also a side of flatbread that coupled well with our salad. 

I ordered the popular Biloxi chicken sandwich. The coleslaw filling was so wet that the brioche roll could not hold itself together. The chicken itself was too dry for my taste along with the soggy roll, I knew I would never order this again. 

My daughter got a cheeseburger cooked medium well. As the waiter was bringing her cheeseburger out, it was very appealing to the eye. It was huge and she was very satisfied with her order. She was going to try to bite it, but the size of it made her want to cut it in half.  After she cut it, a one-eyed glaucoma patient could see that the burger was raw, or very, very rare. The raw juices were oozing out onto the plate and grossed us both out. This made the remainder of our lunch stop right there.  The waiter offered to correct the meat temperature, as he phrased it, but we were no longer hungry. He removed the order from our bill.

5456043,2014-10-28,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I was in Vegas last weekend and enjoyed lunch with my pal that lives in Summerlin. We originally tried going to a breakfast spot ten minutes away, but the 45 minute wait prompted us for a Plan B...so glad Honey Salt ended up as our Plan B.

We were seated right away and were quickly greeted by a gal that brought us water and the complimentary cheesy crackers with butter.   My friend asked if they had chocolate milk for her 5 1/2 year old.  They don't normally have it on their menu, but they managed to make one for him, which he loved.

We both ended up ordering the same thing off their Power Lunch menu.  I thought the courses were going to be served one by one, but the cesar salad was served with the fried chicken sandwich and fries I wanted.  Everything was very tasty and I enjoyed it all before the strawberry sorbet came out after we were done with everything else. The slaw in the sandwich could have been served as a side, it was very tasty.

Ambiance here reminded me of the hip and cool restaurants that you'd find in downtown San Diego (The Gaslamp) where I live.  It's a great spot for locals to enjoy since the food is great and the restaurant itself is very pretty on the eyes.  If anything, I would have probably enjoyed my salad first instead of it coming out with my fries and sandwich since I was alternating what I was eating with the three options on my plate all at the same time.  I know, first world problems.

It can be a little confusing when trying to find out who your server was since the gal that originally poured our waters and brought out other drinks did only that.  Our actual server barely showed up to take our order and another guy brought out our food.  Very little interaction with our server guy, I actually preferred the gal since she was a lot more friendly with us and made us feel welcomed.

I loved the honey lemon(?) salt scrub that they provided in the ladies room, that was a nice touch.  I love salt scrubs, but after learning it costs $30 to buy theirs in a mason pint-sized jar, I didn't love it as much as I thought since I refused to spend that much to take one home with me, lol.",R_S07piLpe_LHU0yKyYOzg,6,3,4,cY_NhgTWYFIIisd2FqkOqg
5461033,2016-07-18,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"This is a cute little hidden restaurant within the same plaza as PF Changs right in the corner so it can be easy to miss. Their ambiance and decor has a sort of modern vintage vibe. One wall is decorated with framed mirrors while the other is a brick wall their ""Honey Salt"" written across it.

Our server was attentive and got me everything I needed without me having to ask for it.

We decided to go with the Ahi Tuna Tartare as a starter and then the Seared Ahi Tuna and Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast for entrees. Our server brought out our starter and then the bread & butter afterwards, thought that was a little weird - not a big deal.

Ahi Tuna Tartare: Comes with a few pieces of toasted bread. Full of flavor as soon as you bite into it - but it is quite small. 

Seared Ahi Tuna: Boyfriend loved it but he was still hungry afterwards. Came with a little side salad and about 6-7 pieces of ahi tuna. I obviously stole a piece and the flavoring was amazing on it.

Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast: I was afraid that this would be just a lump of dry chicken at first glance but it wasn't! As soon as I bit into it, it was juicy, it tastes even better if you dip it into the natural jus. The skin was also nice and crispy which adds more texture to the dish. Below the chicken was a few pieces of macaroni which I pretty much ate in one bite.

Overall, if you're starving and expecting large portions, don't come here! The price can be a bit high but I understand that the quality of food makes up for it. This wouldn't be a regular go-to spot for me but I would consider coming back on a special occasion to try some other dishes.",IPGCGImT5tsLWWpLbvmLZQ,0,0,4,X1Rhr5EUyqBJwY55ZCKzuA

But I digress.

Fortunately, due to seeing pics of their tasty foods online, the Missus and I decided to pay them a visit.

The ambience has kind of a ""Hip Homemade"" vibe to it.  Their drinks (blood orange mimosas) are tasty and colorful, and while I like their chicken tacos and burgers, their fried chicken sandwich is to die for.  I'm trying to be better about my eating by not fixating on just one ""favorite"", and while everything I've tried has been full of flavor and very good, that fried chicken sandwich is the business.

Prices are reasonable, service is pleasant, and I really like the atmosphere.  The bathroom walls (well, men's anyway - I can't vouch for what mysterious marvels the women's bathroom offers) showcases a full wall of classic baseball cards, which is fun to browse through all the old players, and it's in a good spot near Boca Park.

I had read about Honey Salt and had been wanting to try it for a while.  I hadn't had cause to be near Boca Park.  But a friend of mine wanted to go out for Saturday brunch and I remembered the lovely things I had heard about this place.  (ahem, endless mimosas)

We both agreed to endless mimosas, so our lovely server started us off with blood orange.  Our second round was more of the same and our third round (which we couldn't finish, I know weak) was a concoction that our server made up.  It was the best yet, but two was actually my limit.

I asked for some recommendations from the menu.  The server mentioned the bacon grilled cheese with tomato soup and I was thought that sounds amazing!  And it was.  The large and crispy bacon pieces inside of the melty gooey cheese took me to heaven.  The tomato soup has a little bit of a spicy kick.  Also, there was so much food, I got to take half of my sandwich home and enjoy it another time.

I had really intended to eat one of the delectable sounding breakfast options, but alas, all that means is I must return to try the french toast or eggs benedict or ...

The decor was nice and comfortable, throw pillows on the benches.  I like that they left a water bottle at the table so we could refill ourselves.  The service was one the money.

So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called ""Breaking Bad"".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  

The creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  

I got ""My Wife's Favorite Salad"" consisting of duck confit, arugula, frisée, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  

We split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  

Our super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting ""The Brookie"" for dessert which the menu describes ""chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream"".

The flatbread was crispy on the outside and airy in the inside, perfect! And pretty good with the avocado spread but no cohesion with the ahi. I just picked off the ahi from the top and ate it separately. I'm no chef but I could tell you this dish needed an acid element! I wish they had done something to tie the ahi (""star ingredient"") better into the dish. Pretty plating, but basic flavors. I was disappointed and was left thinking ""that's it?"" And for $18 if I recall correctly. I was going to check out but got talked into the salted caramel brownie dessert, let's give them another shot. Waaaaaay too sweet to even enjoy.

I first went to Honey Salt for restaurant week and was pretty significantly disappointed. At the end of the day the food was just okay, nothing special, and no matter how awesome the honey salt butter actually was, delicious butter can only go so far. Although hot damn the butter went pretty far.  If I had made a review on the restaurant week menu it would be 3 stars at best.

And yet, I was coerced into coming back. Reviews are just generally very positive so I wanted to give it another shot and ultimately that was a very good decision. I've been back two times once for dinner and once for brunch.

Dinner:

Squash Blossoms- an interesting appetizer certainly, basically fried squash and cheese but fairly tasty I will say that.

Salmon- honestly it was a great salmon dish. A lot of vegetables, salmon cooked very well, pesto all over. Overall a very satisfying dish.

Peach Cobbler- the big seller here is the seasonal dessert. The opportunity to have desserts that change with the seasons is very fun and worth coming back for. The Cobbler was really amazing too. Really got the peach flavor coming through.

Brunch:

Monkey bread- very tasty sugary delight. A huge plate too. Could have made me full all on its own if I was a lesser man.

Eggs benedict- As far as eggs benedict goes I'd say it was above average. Did it blow me away? No. But It's far better than anything I can do which is more than enough for me. 

As a side note the decor of the restaurant is also really nice. It's a really cozy feel and the brick designs work really well.

So the key question here is why 4 not 5 stars. Obviously Ive claimed the food is pretty good and it's a fun environment.  But the key word here is 'pretty.'  There was nothing that blew me away in terms of the food. The dessert was the closest but one dessert item just simply isn't enough to seal the deal.

5558154,2017-12-18,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I made a brunch reservation for myself and six of my friends.  When I arrived a 14-top walk-in had just taken up the table I reserved so we were relegated to sitting outside.  In December.  It took me asking twice and an additional 15 minutes for the server to come get our drink order.  Throughout the meal we didn't receive a coffee refill without asking and then waiting at least five minutes.  I ordered steak and eggs, medium rare and poached.  I got a medium well steak and raw eggs.  The egg white wasn't cooked and they were ice cold.  I would have sent it back, but I didn't see him again for an hour.  When we finally tracked him down to get the bill, we asked for it to be split.  He told us it would ""take too long"" so I began to split it on my own.  He came back and slapped the newly separated bills on the table and left.  

I am embarrassed because I highly recommended Honey Salt.  It fell far below my expectations and I feel foolish for recommending it to my friends.  It was an abysmal experience and was no where near the $25 per person cost for inedible food and horrible service.

Not too long.  The restaurant was very loud in the main area but we were seated on the side which was much quieter.  

We decided to save room for dessert so we did not have appetizers.  For entrees, mom had the short ribs.  They were pull apart tender.  Really tasty.  I had the leftovers the next day and they were really tasty.  There was flounder fish special on the menu that night so that is what I had.  The fish was flaky and soft.  There was fennel and citrus on top.

We also had the salt & pepper fries.  Crispy on the outside, soft inside.  Not too peppery.  I had the white sangria to drink.  It was very tasty, bubbly.  They have a full bar so mom had a Bombay Sapphire and tonic.  She enjoyed it.  For dessert, we had the brown bag baked apple pie with vanilla ice cream.  The apple pie was really yummy.  The crust was nice and flaky.  Soft apples.  Ice cream was good too.

Two hostesses and the manager all made me feel like I was a superstar as I walked in.  My first thought was I was the only customer but the place was nearly full.  My daughter and I were seated at a table with a couch (of course the 8 year old got the couch) and the atmosphere was welcoming and lively.  Our waitress was cute as a button and very helpful about the menu.  She made some suggestions and ultimately I tried the free range chicken.   I was prepared for the dry stringy meat that made me gravitate away from chicken at many restaurants.  I don't know whether it was the free range, the cooking style, or some magic pixie dust but this was the best piece of chicken I ever ate.  The skin was crisp and the meat moist and flavorful.  The sauce was delightful.  Even the mac and cheese underneath was superb.  My daughter got the pasta with brown butter and parmesan.  Although we were a little surprised the pasta was elbow macaroni, she still loved it.  The whole wheat rolls and flatbread with a bean puree were very good as well.  For desert, my daughter had a snow cone (first time i have seen that in restaurants.  What kid doesn't love a snow cone.  I had the brown bag apple pie with vanilla ice cream.  YUM.  I WANT MORE.   Their drinks are also creative.  I only tried one martini because I was driving but next time, I will find a designated driver so I can try more.

All in all this is a great addition to Summerlin.  I was a little sticker shocked at the final bill partly because they don't list the prices well for the kids menu and partly because the items are a little pricey but it is well worth it and still cheaper than most places on the strip.

Needless to say, try their Smoked Beehive Grilled Cheddar Cheese during LUNCH. It's such a delicious combination of flavors, I can't really describe it.. a little salty, a little smoky, and a whole lot of cheese.

We also tried Mary's Free Range Chicken. I've never had quinoa before so it was a little interesting for me.. but the chicken was tasty and tender.

The food was super simple. I ordered the Margherita? Flatbread, which was a fair enough size to share with two people as a snack/appetizer? or one person can eat it as a meal (which is what I did). I was very content after my meal? but it does get soggy since it had fresh toppings.
My husband ordered Backyard Favorite Burger, which I assume was good since he didn't complain about it.

-Mac & cheese: my FAVORITE on the happy hour menu. The touch of kale and the the nutty & salty crumbs really took the dish to another level. My only problem with this dish was how long it took to cool, I kept burning my mouth it was too delicious.
-Turkey meatballs: not my favorite, the sauce tasted a bit bland
-Pork belly taco: super yummy! The sauce really makes it!
-Eggplant dip with pita: had a light flavor to it, but I loved the play on texture that they did with the dish. I think there were some nuts and something crispy in there, but overall yummy.

5674614,2014-07-15,2,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"This review is strictly regarding brunch - I've not ever dined at Honey Salt for dinner.

This was also my 1st time at the restaurant and I really didn't know what to expect.  I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday morning. She was seated first, since she was a bit early, and I arrived shortly after.  We we were seated on the side of the restaurant, away from the main dining room.  I found this strange, but my friend mentioned that it was very hot in the restaurant when she walked in, and the hostess recommended sitting over there because it was cooler (I didn't notice the heat).

First of all, I love the decor and vibe of this place.  It's very ""shabby chic."" There are lots of little knick knacks displayed throughout the restaurant and cute art on the walls.

The tables are very close to each other. Luckily, there was nobody seated next to us, so this wasn't an issue.  But I could see it being awkward if it were a busy night.

I was torn between ordering the bottomless mimosas ($20) or the ""create your own"" bloody marys ($22). Once I decided on the bloodys, the server actually talked me out of it - saying that they were much smaller than just ordering them individually, and I would have to do all the work (obviously). I wish I would've just ordered this, but our server convinced me that the bartender makes an awesome bloddy mary (I am very picky about them).  I ended up disappointed. There was just something ""off"" about the drink - it had very little flavor, and although I asked for it to be spicy and also made with horseradish, it wasn't spicy enough and I had the server bring me extra horseradish. Maybe because it was fresh horseradish? I don't know. For my 2nd drink, I ordered the blood orange mimosa, which was very good. 

For food, we started out with the monkey bread. It was a large portion, definitely enough to share ($9). We didn't come close to eating it all! I am not really a sweets person, so I only had a couple of bites.

I was set on ordering the weekend frittata, but my friend changed her mind at the last minute and also decided to order it. So I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict ($22). This was absolutely delicious! There were 2 house made crab cakes, topped with asparagus, 2 poached eggs and hollandaise.  I tasted the frittata and it was also really good! It was much larger than expected and had tons of flavor. She chose to pay $2 extra and add chicken, which I probably wouldn't have done. 

We splurged and had dessert (YOLO, right?!). We shared the Triple Strawberry Shortcake. It looked more like a large biscuit, halved and filled with strawberries and whipped cream. It also had a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  Not sure I would order it again, but as I mentioned I am not a huge sweets eater.

Our server was friendly and helpful. She had a fun, upbeat attitude which is always a plus.  Brunch was good, but there was nothing that wowed me so much that I would drive to the other side of town for.  But I am definitely glad to check another bookmark off my never ending list!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,8,4,4,S6o7zgiqNt9BSSuo9eEuSg

You get complimentary bread & crackers with bean dip with your meal.

Service is mediocre but they're friendly. Friendly and nice, but their service system lacks efficiency. It took what felt like 30mins to get our check. That is REALLY lacking and annoying. 

Food is definitely 4 stars as of right now.

ORDERED:
The Mary free range chicken, aka Grain Salad. That's a 4/5 rating :o). 

This originally would've been a 4 star rating but since I wanted to leave in a timely manner and couldn't, I'm docking that extra star. I mean, we told a total of two servers that we wanted our bill and that we wanted it split. After the second server came over to confirm that, it still took him awhile until he actually got our checks. What's up with that? And it's not like they were short staffed because there were a few of them running around. The 5 of us just sat there wondering when we'll get our checks.

P.S. With your checks, you'll get a little guest book that a lot of people can sign (almost like a yearbook) and leave comments. It's a neat idea so thumbs up for that.

Last note: whie the food was decent enough for the most part, there's really nothing that stood out that will make me want to come back. :/",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,1,3,ubv_4_o6qMFW4vwwgkiQRA

It's been described as ""feeling like a pottery barn."" I quite like the ambiance, the mismatched furniture and chandeliers, it really takes me away from Vegas and makes me feel like I'm at a hip restaurant in a cool city. 

My husband and I first decided to check it out for lunch. He couldn't resist ordering the fried chicken sandwich and I went with the backyard burger. The fried chicken sandwich was juicy and delicious. I can see why people compare it to Chik-fil-A. The burger was seasoned perfectly, I really enjoyed the tomato jam since I'm notorious for picking my tomatoes off of my burgers. The shoe string fries were a perfect side.

More recently, my friends and I decided to check out their brunch. We started with some monkey bread for the table. It was ooey, gooey, and so delicious. It is perfect for splitting with the table and the hints of citrus really counter the sweet honey sauce. I settled on the steak and egg slider and it was a great decision. The steak was super flavorful and the entire thing just worked well together. I also felt somewhat healthy since there was creamed spinach. The breakfast potatoes were more like wedge fries, but I'm not one to complain about potatoes in any form. I also split some peach pancakes with a friend and they were delicious. There were peaches baked in, but could have used some more peaches on top. 

It wouldn't be a girls brunch without cocktails and they have a full bar. I had a delicious strawberry, prickly pear, lime, cocktail with citrus vodka. My friends all went with the bottomless mimosas, but weren't impressed with the $20 price tag.

The app was a Caesar salad. I don't like Caesar salads. If you do, you might enjoy it, but it is something I just can't get into. 2/5.

The entree was salmon with some seeds and grains. The presentation was nice, but the dish overall was a little underwhelming. Not bad, just not substantially impressive. I'd say 3.5/5, good enough to get again but not to seek out.

Sadly the two listed desserts didn't work with my allergy. So, the substitute was some strawberries with whipped cream. I appreciate the substitution, and it was enjoyable, but I can't say it was anything special. 3.5/5

I ordered the Filet Mignon stacked Sliders with scrambled eggs, creamed spinach, beehive cheddar.

The sliders also come with a side of roasted breakfast potatoes, those were also VERY bland in my opinion. I felt like they needed some extra spice, or I was tempted to ask for....you ready for this? KETCHUP. 

Service: 5/5 Stars

To begin- they need to take the curry off the menu ASAP.  What a horrible dish!!!!  I'm a bit at fault for ordering curry in a place like this, but I didn't think that they'd butcher it the way they did.  This dish was inedible.  It didn't taste like anything.  The only flavor profile I got was spicy, it didn't even taste like curry.  It was watered down spice- haha- really though. Gosh.  Disgusting.  Served with a bland mango/pear chutney, dry basmati rice, and a basic ass yogurt sauce that had no taste.

Pork chop was salty, octopus had  components that worked together, but was salty as hell.  Pizza dough on the appetizer was good, but the ingredients it was topped with were nothing special.  Last, the brookie (cookie/brownie) was hard.  The only part that was moist was right under the salted caramel ice cream.  Cookie was inedible cause it was rock solid.

Our server was really basic too.  He didn't seem very genuine, didn't make me feel like I just had a great experience.  He was just going through the motions of being a ""server"". 

I've been here twice now.  One for lunch, and now dinner; I will not be coming back. 

I'm not going to lie, but the thirty minutes it took me to get here, only to throw away $22 on an entree I took one bite of, def added to the salty experience.  Waste of gas, waste of $$$, waste of time.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,7,2,2,tZbTExQ6TdAJx_8W7QiScQ

At first glance, the menu is very promising.  Starting with the bread service, the crispy flatbread and butter is a nice little twist.  Next up, My Wife's Favorite Salad with duck confit.  It was as good as advertised.  This was probably the best dish of the meal.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, the chicken was very dry.  It could have used a lot more of the durkee dressing.  Also, the slaw was a bit bland for me.  I thought the sandwich itself could have benefited from some form of acid to brighten it up.  My wife ordered the farmer's toast with persimmon.  It was ok, but overall too sweet with the persimmon, honey and wheat bread.  My kiddo was happy with her mac and cheese and DIY sundae.

Service was subpar in my opinion.  This was surprising as we were one of the first ones in the restaurant and there were only a handful of tables occupied with an equal amount of servers.

I want to like this place so much more as it seems to a lot of promise.  The sad truth is that I may never try it again as we normally stay on the strip and the Red Rock stay was a one time deal.",GF-UBIwA0gEcUbAkve6s3A,2,1,3,en8gL6n7iHbEwqESUqtUxQ

But if you have a hearty-sized-stomach and cares more about your appetite rather than how your plate looks -- well there's a Cheese Cake factory that serves larger sized portions and offers just about the same quality taste, just across the street (just sayin').

- New England Fry (too greasy and they only gave us 3 shishito peppers which was the best part of the app). 
- Burrata & Heirloom Tomatoes ""Kim's style"" (kudos on the combination of chocolate and homemade mozzarella cheese, but the portion was way too small even though the server said it would feed 2 people).
- Grilled Scottish Salmon (It was OK.  Just ok.  Nothing to write about.  Seriously.)
- Chocolate Buttermilk Crunch Cake (served as layered cake.  Very sweet.  Nice dessert.)

Overall, if you're looking at going to a nice romantic place, I suggest going to an upper scale steakhouse or French restaurant.  Just cause you'll end up spending the same amount of money for a lot more food and ambiance.

5845953,2017-11-28,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"TL;DR This place is well worth visiting if you are in Las Vegas. Lots of complaints about the table near the bathroom so if you can, ask for a table elsewhere. Sea scallop and free range chicken are bomb. I would recommend and come back to this place when in Las Vegas. 

This place did not disappoint. I was surprised that the place was not packed with the food was above average. This review has been sitting in my drafts for awhile now. I have been to tons of places in LV that are packed, but the food taste like garbage diving soup. Enough with my bad experiences in LV, lets talk Honey Salt.

The ambiance was great. It had a rustic, hipster feel to it. Love the decor overall and the mirrors were unique. You can feel the character the mirrors had on the wall. Every place has to have it's own style, and I feel like the mirrors were it. It is all the small details that matter the most and this place has it. The bathroom was decorated nicely and was very cool. I feel like you wouldn't like it if you don't like places with personality. The salt scrub was a very nice touch and goes that extra mile you never expected. 

I have been told constantly that restaurants serve stale bread to enhance the taste of the food coming out. Honestly it just ruins my appetite. Usually shitty bread comes with shitty food. Instead of bread, we got chips and boy were they fresh. Still hot out of the oven, crispy, and flaky. With their homemade honey butter, OMG it is almost to die for. The butter was amazing. With a starter like that, I couldn't wait to get my food. Just writing this review is making me drool. 

Calamari was great. Probably one of the best places in Las Vegas to get calamari. My review probably will do no justice for it so you should just try it yourself. I think it might be the bread they use, but it just has that crisp you rarely find even at fancy restaurants. Crisp is key.

I think the best test of a restaurant are their scallops. The sea scallops here were great. I am tired of going to places where the scallops is never fresh (in California. We live next to the ocean FFS). The sauce is superb. The scallops alone are only half the battle, everything else depends on the sauce and it was spot on for me.The subtle vanilla fragrance enhanced my dining experience for sure. I wish it was a little more caramelized, but to all their own. 

I only tried some, but the other main dish that was amazing was the free range chicken. It was absolutely succulent. In combination with the crispy skin it was a great compliment of flavors with a contrast of textures in my mouth. Honestly the chicken alone does no justice so be sure to portion out the skin with the chicken. Some people like crunchy chicken, but I like my skin crisp and boy was it crisp. It's not soul food, but it was some good chicken.

Anyways this review is getting pretty long so I will just end it here. Try it out.",Q3_SHSsOVwdgBzovw8Vy3A,0,0,5,YmsWeth1YnEcELlypzTk1A

Note that the dishes are seasonal so you may not see the dishes I talk about below on the menu.

The fried chicken was out of this world.  I have had many upscale, foodie fried chicken dishes and this was 2 out of 3 (Stripsteak still tops the list).  Juicy, crispy, perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.  Also the scallops with parsnip puree and cauliflower was to-die-for.  I wanted to literally pick up my dish and lick it clean.  

They also have a great selection of specialty cocktails and wine.  They also homemade non-alcoholic beverages, which is a huge plus in my book.  More restaurants should have these options - helps the restaurant and provides non-alcoholic options besides tea and soft drinks.

Only negative is that in the winter, the restarant can get very cold and drafty with the location of the front door.

Calamari: 5/5
Its super crispy and cooked to perfection so it wasn't chewy at all. There was a perfect amount of breading, the sauce it came with complemented the calamari incredibly well, and it came with fried lemons that were surprisingly delicious.

Margherita pizza: 5/5

Mac n' cheese: 5/5
Mac n' cheese is the holy grail of this place. This is hands down the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. Most places add truffle oil and breading and it's good.

Our server took quite a while to come over to our table but once she did she was super friendly. 

Honey Salt was offering a three course lunch for $20 for RW. I chose the Elizabeth Caesar, the buttermilk fired chicken sandwich and the brookie. My other half chose the turkey meatballs, backyard burger and the brookie. 

The salad was quite small but packed with flavor. I didn't try the meatballs but was told they were okay, just a little dry. The chicken sandwich and burger were very big. My chicken sandwich had two large pieces of fried chicken. I thought it was good but not great. The coating was quite soft instead of crispy. My other half loved his burger. 

The brookie was definitely the highlight of the lunch. A soft warm cookie baked int to a soft warm brownie with a wonderful salted caramel ice cream. It was the perfect ending.

I've since been back twice for lunch and their in limbo (you're too late for lunch - but too early for dinner) menu.

Food is great. I've never had a bad dining experience in that regard. Fresh whole wheat pizza, perfectly cooked turkey meat balls. It has all been delicious. But...

The service is getting progressively worse. the servers the past couple of times have been bad. Really rude. Even the hostess was rude. (Yeah and a frowny face should never be used to greet people...ever).

You'll find that even though the place is fully staffed, your server is struggling with a 4 table section of 4 tops. Our hipster plaid wearing man server was never around, and when he was, he was conversing by the bar completely oblivious. 

In such a competitive restaurant market with us industry folks, I find it hard to believe that this place wouldn't have better service. Maybe the lunch staff is comprised of the minor leaguers, and the dinner is major league. Might just have to steer clear of the lunch hour crew until they get it together.

*dinner: Mac n cheese is amazing, and the grilled chicken is to die for. Don't forget about the brown bag apple pie. 

*lunch: the fried chicken sandwich, turkey meatballs, veggie whole wheat pizza. Delicious. They do two fresh juices off the salad menu that are really good too. Lemonade is not fresh, and that makes me a little sad inside, but that's just one minor faux pas.

Five stars for food.",ocbOc0jy1TjEhJIvuVpoPg,3,1,3,eoyQbRB0Hjhum_8XiNN2Ag
5948047,2018-06-10,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I really wanted to like this place, truly I did. My Aunt is a ""foodie"" and goes around the world scouting places she likes and when any of us (family) are visiting, or living, in a city or town or country even, she scouts out places that we will like. 

My Aunt told me about a year ago to go to this restaurant was ""known"" for the best grilled cheese-perhaps it was true or not, it was not on the menu for kids it was just a grilled cheese with bacon on the adult menu. 

I was spending a nice day with my kids as we are leaving in two weeks for the summer and I went to Primm (guilty pleasure-Powerball) and then the Outlet Mall to get them some more clothes for the summer. I tried to make a day of it as it is roasting out (which is why we leave) so I decided to take them to Honey Salt as they did not want to eat in Primm. 

It is a half hour north of where we live and we arrived and it is in a very upscale shopping area and looked really promising. I was very excited as my son is a poor eater and I prayed he'd eat a grilled cheese-but alas there was only the grilled cheese with bacon, which he would not have eaten, but I am sure they would have made just cheese, however, he wanted French Toast-which was big enough for the kids to share. It was probably amazing as he is very picky and gobbled it up, my ""good eater"" daughter did not really touch hers. 

The atmosphere for a trendy upscale restaurant was pretty loud and as soon as we walked in I did not feel it was really going to be kid friendly. As we entered a woman, with a child, told me to be careful there was glass behind her (prelude to our finale). We were seated at the very corner near the kitchen and our very nice and friendly waitress and other staff came over several times to tend to us (service was excellent). 

So, the meat, literally and figuratively, of my review is my own meal. I had a Steak and Eggs and substituted the potatoes for a Ceasar Salad. The salad was very good, albeit quite small, and my food was pretty unappetising. I say this because it was cold. The steak was cold, the eggs were cold and very hard/rubbery. I did not want to send it back as it was warm enough to eat and so I just ate it. 

I will reiterate that the staff was generally, well all really, quite nice and very attentive. Unfortunately at the end of our meal my 2 year old daughter was running on the booth as I was trying to pay and broke a glass. Anyone who has a two year old, or has had children knows it is very hard to control them at 2 years old. I also saw no need for them to have chunky water glasses at every table, obviously, as was the case when we entered, my child was not the first to break a glass. She broke a glass and both a woman, who I believe was the manager (as a friend of mind knows the owner Elizabeth and said she is in Vancouver right now), as well as a really nice staff member who was cleaning it as I apologised came rushing over. 

The woman did not speak to me as I profusely apologised, though the man cleaning was very nice and said, ""Don't worry"". The woman seemed very annoyed and I tried to get the bill settled as soon as possible and was trying to keep my son out of the glass, when my daughter jumped and fell off the booth. The gentleman picked her up and she was crying and I had to hold her while I signed as quickly as possible so as to be able to just leave. 

I totally understand that it is unfortunate for kids to break things, and in some ways is a parental responsibility, but the review is not even based on this nor the way the woman who came over seemed utterly annoyed with us, it was about the atmosphere and the meal. Just ""trendy"" in an L.A. way where you have a quasi cafe/restaurant with lots of people socialising and talking very loud and waitstaff who are super busy and yet very attentive and food that is not really worth it. I truly hate giving anything but stellar reviews but sometimes you just have to be honest. I felt horrible but I did not need to be made to feel worse by the woman who came over to the table, it actually stressed me and I was trying too hard to get the kids out of there fast enough.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,1,3,xa1HKZ9bcuWzyiUY-c14Ug
5951247,2013-10-21,6,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"My friend, who is a local, recommended Honey Salt for the Burrata and Heirloom Tomato salad with the shaved bittersweet chocolate add-on. The artfully-plated salad comes with figs, basil, balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. A truly creative take on the classic Caprese salad that brings your taste buds a flavor-packed symphony of sweet and savory tastes with low acidity and plenty of umami. I also tried the Backyard Favorite Burger, which comes with beehive cheddar, tomato jam, butter pickle and a side of french fries. Ketchup comes in a mini squeeze bottle - ours was on the low side.(It would be nice if they topped off each bottle before sending it out.) At $14, the medium-rare burger was a very disappointing 2-Yelp-stars in terms of flavor and juiciness, especially after that amazing 5-Yelp-stars Burrata-tomato-chocolate salad. Absolutely nothing stood out about the beef patty, bun and accompaniments. Next time, TWO Burrata and Heirloom Tomato salads!!!!!

Other notes:
Free wi-fi!
Shabby chic decor. (It's so hot right now.)
Our server sported Ray-ban wayfarers sans lens and spiky styled hair (plus, the requisite hipster ultra-skinnies).
The restroom sports an interesting ""wallpaper"" collage of hotel and business key cards and the like. I spotted Carl W.'s Fiserv!
Desert air dried out your hands? Smooth and soothe them with some complimentary salt scrub at the restroom sink. 

Yummy salt water taffy at the hostess stand. Try the birthday cake flavor!",UiGjeRQyDE8rxgE-0hisaw,7,9,4,A_CyrU5H3docmE6KCwLGRw

5959842,2015-01-17,1,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I have had Honey Salt on my peripheral radar for some time, but always felt rather lackluster about actually trying them. I finally got the opportunity to give them a try for lunch and without keeping you in suspense, the food and service were as lackluster as I had anticipated.

They were pretty busy during lunch time but we were seated immediately. It took a while for our server to acknowledge us and throughout our meal this remained an issue. He would be attentive for a minute and then he'd disappear, promising refills and spare utensils and then not delivering on these requests. I resorted to flag several waiters and busboys down for a spoon to be able to eat my soup which was cooling off quickly and get refills on tea and water.

On to the food. I decided on the fried chicken sandwich since it seemed to have universally positive reviews. This came with fries and I opted for a cup of soup and bread pudding for dessert, which me and my dining companion shared.

The sandwich was nothing to write home about, it lacked any originality and didn't have much flavor. The fries were hard and under seasoned and even the soup was dull. None of the flavors did anything for me. The bread pudding was fine, but it was not memorable in any way. 

All the food just seems overly pretentious and lacking any sort of excitement in the flavor department. Even now, over a week later, I can barely remember anything about the food. 

I don't see myself coming back any time soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,2,BRIfrJoLa7pxHrXIKwZQIQ

It's hidden in the corner of the shopping center so you'd never really see it unless you go into the parking lot. We order their flat bread pizza and the shrimp tacos. OMG....the shrimp tacos are so delish. I really didn't want to share, but I gave it up in the end. The Meatball Pizza was eh...not too sold on flat bread pizzas. I ordered the Brookie for dessert and I'm soooo glad I did. So a Brookie is the product of a chocolate chip cookie mating with a brownie. No Seriously! They smashed together and topped with salted caramel ice cream....i could taste the love! I will definitely be back for more!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,2,1,4,6MGOghaid7sH2hRhvjxnoQ
5973561,2013-05-30,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,"I love the atmosphere.  It is rustic yet homey.  Elegant, yet comfy. 

A friend and I met for lunch and since we weren't too hungry, we both ordered salads.  She had the Caesar salad and I ordered the Big-Eye Tuna salad.  Both were quite good, but nothing special.  The service however, was very attentive and friendly.  Our water glasses were never half full.  It was quite crowded when we came for lunch on a weekday, letting me know that it is quite the popular lunch spot. 

There is outdoor seating, but we opted to sit inside where we were able to enjoy a nice long conversation with some lattes to conclude our meal.  I love that it is a family owned restaurant and that the menu is farm to table inspired.  It looks like I need to try the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken and their huge selection of desserts in order to truly appreciate this little Summerlin gem.  I will definitely be back.

5989935,2014-05-19,0,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,I really like the idea behind Honey Salt - the juxtaposition of the sweet & savory ...but I think they take themselves a tad seriously.  Great for cocktails and you can expect a solid satisfying meal for 1/2 what you would pay on the strip.  Waiter was slightly uppity...I think that might be where I got the too serious vibe.  I just didn't feel like he was genuine at all - more like he was doing a sales pitch.  The other staff we encountered seemed cool enough.   The mac n cheese was some of the best I've ever had.  They serve Pok Pok drinking vinegars and I appreciated their beer selection.  A little far to go if you do not have a cab and are staying anywhere close to the strip.
