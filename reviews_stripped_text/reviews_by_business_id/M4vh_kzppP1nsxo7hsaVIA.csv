This place was very good and for the price of 20.99 on Tuesday Seafood Buffet. Now it didn't have much for seafood as I like. I enjoy crab legs and steamed shrimp. It didn't have crab legs. And the shrimp was cold. I did ask the cook at the pasta station if he could heat them up and boy did he go out of his way. He sauté them in butter and garlic and added some other spices and they were amazing. The carving station was nice with moist roast beef and turkey. The sausages was good as well. There was 4 types sushi but not what I would eat, and the fried shrimp was good. The pasta station was unique and an abundant of deserts. I did not have any since I was so full.

Das Essen ist unterer Buffet-Durchschnitt: man wird satt, aber lecker ist anders. Okay, ich habe schon schlechter gegessen (wenn auch selten), z.B. am damaligen Riviera Buffet oder an verschiedenen Autobahnraststätten. Aber hier kann ich wirklich keine Empfehlung aussprechen, es sei denn, man hat Comps oder echt großen Hunger und man steht gerade zufällig genau vor dem Buffeteingang und will nicht mehr weiter laufen. Aber selbst dann würde ich mich lieber noch woanders hin schleppen, selbst im Golden Nugget gibt es bessere Alternativen.
Die Essensauswahl ist typisch für Vegas-Buffets: von jedem etwas. Leider ist hier alles suboptimal zubereitet und ziemlich geschmacksneutral. Die meisten Sachen sind Convenience Food (also fertig angeliefert und aufgewärmt).
Die Raumatmosphäre ist okay (wobei der Buffetbereich tatsächlich etwas von einer Autobahnraststätte hat). Wir hatten Plätze mit Blick auf den recht belebten Poolbereich. Das ist auf jeden Fall ein Pluspunkt, denn viele Vegas Buffets sind komplett geschlossene Räume (ohne Außenfenster).

Came early for the seafood buffet.  Granted, there should have been more seafood.  But there was just enough of a selection to stuff ourselves silly.  Snow crab legs(whole and still attached to the center of the crab), shrimp, and a Cajun steamed bag of prawns, some pieces of crab thrown in along with a piece of corn on the cob and some yummy spicey sausage.  The crab was good and sweet, the Cajun basket was awesome.  And of course there were other meats there like pork and a sad piece of meat they claimed was prime rib.  Which I consider to really be the only thing wrong with this buffet.  There was plenty of bunny food options too, fruits tons of carb dishes, and of course dessert.  Lots of dessert options and the right size since you should already be stuffed by then.  The Crème Brulie is yummy!
Lunch, we got there as they were trying to transform from breakfast to lunch.  Missed out on the bacon.  But the omelet station went on through the lunch serving while we were there.  So score on that.  
Breakfast was delicious.  The waffles are small but don't let that fool you.  They are so fluffy on the inside.  Omelets, get an omelet.  There a couple different areas for the eggs and each one is a little different.  One is plain, one with cheese, and one that has bell peppers and ham mixed in.

And like someone said before, check your coupons once you check in.  m-f is 2 for one at breakfast or lunch.  So if you are only here for the weekend, they are no use to you but if you are on a longer trip like we were, those coupons help stretch those stripper dollars you worked so hard to save up!",iucJuwfCtLT9yIPWFr0T8Q,0,0,3,yesPBtR_Vnghd8rfSNQ63A

I rely on Yelp reviews to help determine where I might eat when away from home, so I wanted to add one here in support of the Golden Nugget Buffet. We had dinner around 7:30 on a Sunday - no wait to be seated. Plenty of freshly prepared food to choose from. I had prime rib, mashed potatoes, veggies, orange chicken, meatballs, and a couple other things that I could fit on my plate. Everything was hot and delicious. The orange chicken was crispy on the outside, tender breast meat on the inside. Prime rib was perfect for anyone's taste - I had an end cut that was so tender, but there was rare as well for those who prefer that preparation.  There was also a made-to-order pasta bar that looked great, but I was already loaded up with so much else!

My teen boys were in heaven with the large selection of items they enjoyed. Ravioli, short ribs, peel and eat shrimp (deveined and split for you), fried shrimp, sausage and peppers, and of course, the desserts which included hand dipped ice cream in 10 or so flavored to choose from.

It's a buffet like most buffets you've been to. Maybe a little better. But not the top tier. If you're staying in the hotel, it's a good spot. It's not a go out of your way place. It is a place of convenience, when you're lazy, hung over and checking out like we were. 
But I like that, my boyfriend and my little situational adventures. Bloody Mary's that are spicy. Pineapple juice, and the offer of refills.

After we finally got in after about a 30 minute wait (9:30 am), we knew why the wait was so long.  There was only one ""seater"".  Paying was quick, but with only one seater, one slow seater, we noticed many open, set tables stay open for at least 10 minutes before anyone was seated at them.  We experienced several other buffets where the staff busted their buts cleaning off tables and seating new parties.  The breakfast food at this buffet was decent, and it actually had the best selection of items at its salad bar.  One weird feature about this buffet is that there are yellow lights above most of the tables which makes it hard to differentiate colors on your plate.",NqAnYIVAvx0L7i-znjtE6g,0,0,2,w1Re9YNJWwgnaTd1Ws1EaQ

We went out there Sunday night - the seafood buffet is ONLY Friday and Saturday. Every other night they basically only have shrimp. While they were decent certainly nothing to write home about. For some reason they had ""warm plates"" right next to cold shrimp - dumb. 

As far as the rest of the food, pretty poor. The sushi was very limited and while it was relatively fresh (watched the chef making it), it was very bland. The meatballs and pasta were awful, as was the Chinese food. 

The only thing of note in my mind was the desserts. They were plentiful and in a size such that you could have a few tasters without having to pick a single one. 

As far as the staff, generally career waitresses who seem to care less. Was drinking a soda and they kept refilling it with warm soda and never added ice. 

Maybe the seafood buffet is still good, but I would t hit this buffet again unless you enjoy desserts at a slightly lower cost than the strip buffets.",uhd9OA8RidwPEW77gUJunQ,1,0,2,qBKfMPdSYsqzuj4vFn6v-A

My boyfriend and I came to the Golden Nugget for their champagne breakfast two days in a row. Not only was the food awesome, the mimosas were flowing, and our waitress serenaded us. And man oh man, she could sing! What a wonderful unexpected treat! 

The buffet choices weren't overwhelming, and what items they did offer I felt they did well. The prime rib was tasty, the hot items were appropriately hot. The seafood section had fresh ceviche and peel and eat shrimp. The cream gravy they had for the biscuits and gravy and/or chicken fried steak was some of the best gravy i've had in a long time. The little mini egg rolls in the chinese food section were hot and crispy, and the corn beef hash was just right. The deli section had amazing smoked salmon and other deli meats...and the english muffins that pillowed the eggs benedict was crispy and not soggy! Bonus!

We will definitely make the trip back to the Golden Nugget for Champagne buffet! We've never received such amazing service at a buffet, ever. If Diane is working, ask for her! She is by far one of their hidden crown jewels. You won't regret it!",e3mddy1mb8hDIeldgA4f9g,3,1,5,Fl09EVLDPGx32MRaRg1vvw

They are good for breakfast and lunch and our book came with two of them.  This buffet is good but not worth full price.

There's not much to say about this place other than the food is very average.  The buffet itself is relatively small, so there isn't a huge amount of variety.  If you're looking for a better selection, I'd recommend going in 15 minutes before they switch from breakfast to lunch.  That way you pay the breakfast price and get to choose whether you want to eat breakfast food, lunch, or some combo.  If you're there for breakfast time, I do recommend the omelet station.  I was surprised to see they had eggs Benedict as well, but it was nothing to write home about.

The waitress let us take a tour of the buffet first to see if anything appealed to us and then we went back to the cash, paid, and got our seats.

The buffet was nice, honestly, they had a lot of great options for meat an seafood lovers. Unfortunately not a whole lot for vegetarians, but we made it work. I mostly filled up on the salad bar an cheese pizza. My hubby got a delicious cream pasta made that was really good as well as an omelet. 

The desert bar was nice, and had a great selection of sweets.

The one thing that threw me off, was the woman working the salad station. She kept taking her dirty rag and pushing all the dropped food back in the bins. Not appealing, and for sure, not very sanitary.

I finally got a chance to go back, looking forward to this dinner outing last Halloween after the parade, and took some friends.  Wow, was that the wrong decision, and it was just so disappointing; hard to believe this buffet is so bad now.  I heard ever since Steve Wynn sold the hotel operation, it's gone downhill--of course I hear this all now, when it would have been great to know beforehand.  

Food was very mediocre at best, and table service was also on that par, even though the lady from Hawaii was very nice.  She got so distracted--and it wasn't even that busy--that she neglected us most of our time there.  Had to ask for drink refills all the time.  Food servers behind the counters were not all that friendly either.  Paying $26-27 for dinner on that Friday night for that service and food made me sick.  I would have rather had a hot dog at Coney Island!

Upon my return home, since I wasn't staying at GN, but on the strip, I wrote the management through the website, by email, and even by postal mail, direct to the hotel.  Here is my note:

As a long time (30+ years) patron and advocate of the Golden Nugget, I regret to say that I am extremely disappointed in our recent  dinner at your buffet (Halloween night).  I brought a party of four (My wife and another couple, our best friends) to eat dinner.  It was their first time, but my wife and I have eaten there many many times in the past years, however, we have not even been to Las Vegas in the past 10 years.  

I assumed things would be excellent (quality, selection, service, etc.) as they always had been (historically).  That was far from the truth, and unfortunately it made me feel terrible for recommending the GN's buffet for our dinner that night, to my friends.

Food quality was the most disappointing, having no comparison to even the TI's buffet which we had the night prior.  Selection was rather limited and poor, and although table service was ""ok"" (lady from Honolulu), most of the servers behind the buffet stations were not very hospitable, energetic, or welcoming.  The dessert guy was the only exception.

I am scheduled to stay (with my wife and son) at GN in December, but I guess we'll not be eating at the buffet.  It's so disappointing that the quality of your hotel's buffet has gone down so much!  It was always the BEST in downtown!  

We didn't try any of your other restaurants, but wonder about them.  In the past, we've tried Lily Langtree's, the Carson St. Cafe and a steakhouse (I believe), all of which used to be very good.   Now, I'm not so sure.

Anyway, I just wanted you to know about our disappointment.

Location: Golden Nugget Casino second floor. Take the escalator up like you're going to see Gordie Brown. But don't.

Atmosphere: The line to get in moves fast. Laid back and casual. Nice view of the pool if you choose to sit near the windows.

Cleanliness: No issues. Never had a dirty glass or piece of silverware here. The buffet is kept up and very clean.

Service: Diane is the best! We've been here about a dozen times and had her as our server every time. She's attentive, fun, easy-going, and brings you a smile when she brings you another mimosa. Love this girl a lot.

Food/Drinks: Bottomless mimosas. Need I say more? Seriously the best mimosas downtown. Champagne Brunch on Saturdays and Sundays for only $17. The meat carving station and the omelet station are both worth the wait. Really nice prime rib. The garlic chicken and spring rolls are my favorites for lunch and the eggs and corned beef hash are my faves for breakfast. Average salad selection, but you can throw together your own Caesar if you're feeling adventurous. The Dreyers Chocolate ice cream is truly the best ice cream ever. I'm not a big pastry fan, but if that's your bag, you'll probably like the selection. They have a ton of cookies and pastries to choose from. And they have this bread pudding with bourbon sauce that is pretty tasty. But let's be totally honest here. I come for the meats, eggs, and mimosas.

Price: Inexpensive. Especially if you play poker and get the comp. Play cards at their poker room for four hours and receive a $10 voucher to redeem at either the grill or the buffet. I recommend the buffet.",PP7mV3SKVhtkuhwUDHUJXQ,4,0,5,jR_xW5D_JvS8jkm1e9MHDg

I should've lowered my ""low"" expectation. The reviews are mixed so we must've picked an off day to eat dinner here. 

Nothing really stood out expect for the pizza alfredo which the pizza guy hand tosses and makes from scratch. Everything else was just blah. The roast beef was dry and tasteless. When the guy served it me, he practically flung it on my plate and looked angry. When I asked for the au jour sauce, he acted like it was inconveniencing him. I was handing him the bowl to put the sauce in but he ignored the bowl, grabbed my plate and dumped the sauce all over my food! Literally. I mean he didn't just put it on the meat, he put it all over my whole plate. Sheesh, who does that? My plate and the rest of my food was drenched. 

The fried chicken which was now drenched in that sauce was also tasteless. The mashed potatoes were good, not fantastic but good and yes they were drenched in that dumb sauce too. Like I mentioned the pizza alfredo was really good. Even though it was drenched in that stupid sauce, I really liked it. In fact that's all I ate after that.

As for deserts. it looked very good but looks can deceive. The pastry guy was putting out new deserts and me being one who likes to talk to anyone (annoying right) told him the deserts looked awesome and asked him if they were made in house. He said they weren't and that they were bought at a store! LOLOLOLOLOLZ! OEM! I would never admit that. I did have a good laugh though. The deserts were dry. Nothing special.

Desserts were pretty good. Fresh, moist cakes and a variety of ice cream flavors to choose from. I don't remember the price going in, which I take as a sign that it wasn't ridiculously priced. I want to say it was around $20. Not bad at all.

 Even though it was Veterans Day & several local places were offering FREE Buffets for Vets (like myself) including the Main Street Station Casino right around the block, this was not on my agenda and I proceeded forward to try this one.

 It didnt start off well as the elevator door kept opening up even though nobody was there to get on & it wasnt going down. So I took the escalator down to the gift shop & bought a paper & went back up to the buffet on the 2nd floor. NBD. 

Then, once seated, there was the issue wt the lighting once again and I asked to be moved to a place wt better light so I could read my paper. I was gladly moved to a seat next to the full window overlooking the pool and its Aquarium, VERY COOL!! However, I did notice that at the pool ALL the guest were laying directly on the lounge pads & NO towel was being offered or laid out for them. I'm surprised as this is VERY unsanitary. Whatever, I'm not going there and laying on someone elses sweat & suntan lotion mess & its .NOT my problem.

At $12 it was a little pricey for lunch but FINALLY this buffet selections actually had some flavor to it, unlike the previous reviewed buffet. The Collard greens actually had real bacon in them and were very good & required no salt at all. The Beef Teriaki wt brocoli was actually ""over sauced"" & to rich but when mixed wt the Pepper, Onions & beef/chicken was very good and the perfect mix of all the ingredients blended together. And while there was no sushi (insert sad face here), there was shrimp cocktail wt medium sized pealed shrimp and a crab salad, both of which were not bad at all.

Also the Shreded  BBQ beef was very good and full of flavor. I didnt try the fried chicken or anything  from the carving station but it all looked real good and of a high quality.

The waitstaff didnt seem that friendly & helpful as my water glass went empty for quite sometime as they all casually walked by until a nice oriental lady offered to refill it even asking me if I wanted something else to drink . I didnt, but thanked her just the same.

The desert station wasnt that impressive and seemed to offer alot of mini cream puffs, cheesecakes, & the likes. I wasnt impressed at all and when I asked the lady scooping the ice cream what flavor one was she had no idea. LOL! I had a scoop anyway and I have NO IDEA what it was either (Maple? Butter Pecan? Carmel???) but it was good with a half slice of mini pecan pie.

 Overall I'd say that out of the 3 buffets downtown, for lunch, this is the best and the table views overlooking the pool & aquarium rock and must really be sensational at night!!",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,1,1,3,o50VqCCsP3-clZHe4CGmnA

I liked it because of the extra brunch offerings.  
I'm usually not a fan of breakfast buffets because it's usually the same ol' heavy standard breakfast foods.

Everyone went the usual route of eggs, waffles, breakfast meats, etc.
They all went to get custom-made omelets.  Normally, I would have been right there with them getting my favorite spinach-mushroom omelet but got distracted by other offerings in some of the other stations.

I went for the veggie mixes and was delighted to find a goat cheese-grape tomato mix.  (This was the main dish for me!)  Also had some grilled fish (mahi mahi?).  There were several sugar-free breakfast desserts to tempt me, but went with the yogurt-granola mix.

We were staying at the casino and after looking at the menu saw that the brunch was reasonably priced at $19.99, at least as far as Champagne brunches in Vegas go.  The inside of the restaurant looked very clean, had a view of the new pool area out of the window and did not have very much decor to speak of.

The food here was actually pretty good.  It had your standard omelet making station as well as other brunch favorites like eggs benedict and blintzes.  Beyond that they also had a little seafood area with peel and eat shrimp and crab salad, a Chinese food section, salad bar and carving station.  The servers here also kept the mimosa's coming.  Half of my flute probably got filled up 10 times or so while I was sitting there.  They start you off with a flute of it and then have a server walking around with pitchers of it who top you off.  This may go towards the fact that I ate a buffet the night before but I think that my favorite part of the meal was the ceasar salad that I made and then topped with chick peas and beets.

You can't be charging Strip buffet prices for crap food. Well, I mean you CAN do that and the Golden Nugget DOES do that, but you can't expect it to go unnoticed.

A dish of ""steak"" is filled with small cuts of very tough meat that are smothered with a sauce that is actually worse than the crappy gravies Heinz sells in a can.

The carving station turkey managed to taste like fish. It's a miracle, because I saw the guy cut the meat off of a turkey carcass. But it didn't taste like turkey.

Surely the pasta offerings would be better. Wrong. I think they fill their cheese ravioli with toe jam. It's terrible. Terrible.

I have a standing rule: I never rave about a restaurant's mac'n'cheese or mashed potatoes. I believe that those two items are simply impossible to screw up and none is truly as AMAZING as people claim. However, I can honestly report that the Golden Nugget Buffet's mac'n'cheese could very possibly be the worst ever created by human hands. Mushy, awful, chemically-tasting artificial cheesy nastiness. It's truly crap-tastic.

Do yourself a favor. Take the $25 per person that you would spend here and bet it all on black at the next roulette table you pass. It's a better value for your money.",c4_JCsqCNgwTlzwTK5RF5w,16,10,1,-9jeyntTJcsQk_TT-PRmkw

While I approve of moving the buffet upstairs to its new updated area, the buffet itself has really suffered. This used to be a four star buffet in food quality, service, and layout. Now it rates a two. 
The layout of the buffet is such that the omelets and carving lines block access to most of the hot dishes. The selection of fresh fruit us limited to cantaloupe only, there is no shrimp or crab at lunch. As a matter of fact, the only thing they have a passable assortment of is desserts. 
The quality of the food has also dropped substantially. Dried out turkey, pressed canned ham, and soup from a can is not what I want to eat. If this is their idea of good food, I know that I am not going to try one of the nicer, more expensive restaurants. Why throw good money after bad?
I can't understand how a restaurant chain can take over a hotel casino and screw up the restaurant. The only reason I can give is that Landry's wanted to greatly increase their profit margin.",BxjfNncvXwf9a1PJIDz3pQ,0,0,2,8YRMDHQCj9vv3mLczUnf1g

Since it's in Downtown Vegas (and away from the strip), even the dinner prices are excellent.  The buffet was approx. $35 for dinner and soft drinks, juices and water are included.  The booze was cheap, also, so worth getting if you want a bucket of beer or something.

Sure, this is The Golden Nugget, which isn't as fancy as the Strip casinos and hotels, but it's great in its own vintage, nostalgic sort of way.  The buffet was large and offered tons of stuff from pizza to soup to fresh carved meats to salads.  Obviously, tons of sides available like mashed potatoes, veggies, breads, rolls, etc.  

I thought the food was tasty.  I've been to better, more upscale buffets, sure, but this place was good and the food was well-made.  There was no trouble getting in and we didn't wait long at all to be seated.  Drink service was quick and no complaints about the servers.

The Golden Nugget Buffet is the worst buffet I have ever encountered. 
In 20 years of food and beverage I have never seen specials listed as ""Chef Special with coagulated sauces and chunks of mystery meat. The seafood salad was in chunks of imitation crab that was not even broken up and was hard as a rock with a pungent seafood odder coming from it. 
I went to the pasta station hoping to find some fresh items and the mushrooms on the station were black and the sauce wasn't an Alfredo sauce it was also some coagulated cream sauce that the cook after preparation scooped piles of parmesan cheese on top of. 
For $18.99 not only did I leave with a literal bad taste in my mouth but the service was horrific as well.
The server came to refill my daughters coke with watered down coke that had no carbonation in it at all, he showed up three times to the table and didn't even speak once to us.
When leaving I was handing my parking ticket to the hostess in the front who was yawning and when I approached her she put her arm up and continued to yawn and pointed toward the cashier who let me know I could validate downstairs.....

I was kinda surprised to see so many overwhelmingly negative reviews of the Golden Nugget Buffet here on Yelp.  Maybe these folks went in expecting gourmet restaurant quality meals made to order, but with the convenience and price of an inexpensive buffet.  Personally, I didn't have particularly high expectations for a high-volume chow trough on top of a casino.

We ate here twice in a row during our stay at the Nugget: a weekday lunch ($13) and weekend Champagne Brunch ($19, +a $5 surcharge for 'gratuity' as we were part of a larger group).  Both meals were hit-and-miss: fresh fruits, salads, made to order omelettes, and some of the side dishes were great, but pizza, pasta, and several other items were bland and/or incredibly greasy.  This is why variety is key; if one item is crap just get something else!  Lots of desserts to choose from, too.

For some reason the process of getting patrons into the dining area was ridiculously slow, but once inside the service was good-- especially when it came to providing mimosa refills during the champagne brunch!

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I were staying at the Nugget again I'd probably do the buffet again just because of it's convenience and relatively good value.",5VaOUbsODRiqG3pGjYSnHw,1,2,3,DZ_AthRRe5WBMdfcYPlo1g

They had this huge round of roast beef at dinner.  I had a slice it was so tough I could not cut it with my knife.  The other meat on the carving station was baby back ribs.  The ribs were better than average.  The salad selection was limited but very good.  The Greek Salad was very tasty.  The dessert  section was big but I don't do the sugars so I could not tell you how they tasted.  I did scope out the bread pudding for a friend of mine Stephanie in St. Louis just on the maybe she would eat here.  Stephanie the bread pudding was average sorry.  The two stars is the parent company that owns this should know better.  When the Golden Nugget buffet was under the old management it was head and shoulders above this one.  That is just not right..  They charge enough money to put better food out.  I just don't know why they won't step up to the plate.  For goodness sake Main Street Station is better as is the Paradise at the Fremont.,BnBQ0UU9uSiI_0cbCZ4lsw,0,0,2,YcCyCKBhmLqq5U2_cdFa1g

A price under $20.00 was printed on this sign for breakfast. But no price was listed for lunch or dinner. You guessed it, we payed over  $20.00 for our meals. 

The food was fine however. My wife enjoyed her prime rib. Even though when she asked the person carving for an end cut, she didn't receive one.

We asked to be seated with a view of the hotel pool and the shark tank. Too bad the pool was drained for winter time repairs. The sun was position perfectly so that the shark tank and other aquatic life were only shadows or glares from the sunlight.

I ate a little of everything.  Prime rib, cod, pork loin, and Turkey, all from the carving station. There was shrimp displayed, but I don't care for shrimp. But still,  nice to have more than one selection. 

Vegetables on my plate included mashed pitatoes, asparagus, green beans with bacon.  That's right I ate asparagus without being told. 

Cold cuts were cut up and presented very nicely.  Almost made me not want to ruin what was on display. Yeah I don't think so.

Turned out to be a descent outing. Here's to everyone having joyous holidays

The service by our two waitresses were awesome. They quickly came and took our drink orders and were so nice! 

The food selection was amazing. There was a huge selection of prepared meats, salads, pastas, and vegetables. There was a mix of Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Soul Food, and Asian flavors in the buffet. So, if you had a particular type of food that you liked you could find it or vice-versa. I loved that they had a deli bar with a fresh selection of meat and cheeses. I was able to add some cheese to these flavorful beans and sausage soup that I had--so delicious and the cheese just brought out more of the flavor! My plate was filled with a little bit of everything! I so wish I had a few extra stomachs or just more room in my one so I could have gone back a few more times. I am always a little unsure of buffets, but you could tell that the food was freshly prepared and put out for dinner time. 

The dessert selection--no words to describe how it was. I have never seen such a great selection of desserts anywhere. They had everything from pies, cakes, cookies, cheesecake bites, ice cream, 

The only thing is I wish that the buffet was a little less expensive. For it being off the strip and $25 it was a little pricey, but I feel it is worth for the most part because of the food selection and service.

My SO on the other hand, loves buffets. 

We were pleasantly surprised!
Perhaps it was that we weren't expecting much, but for a Sunday brunch at $16.99 this place was pretty good. Here are the highlights:

Scrambled eggs were really delicious, mixed with ham and peppers.
Country gravy was traditional and very flavorful
Linguisa sausage was spicy
Pizza sausage (my SO liked this although I thought it was ok)
Ranch dressing on the salad bar was the yummy kind
Corned beef hash was pretty tasty
Tater tots were yummy
If you like macaroons these ones are seriously very very good.

Some of the things that were a miss: the desserts were very bland and we were unimpressed for the most part. Except the macaroons which were delish.

There isn't a lot of variety but I was so full so quickly and for the price it was really quite good. 

They had shrimp cocktail and peel and eat shrimp, both of which were nothing special. And there fruit was very typical. There was nothing special on the salad bar either.

The food itself was pretty well seasoned though and for mass production buffets this place was honestly, better tasting than the buffets I've experienced at The Rio, Paris, Flamingo or anywhere else on the Strip.

All the food was warm, the service was steady, and our refills came often.

My logic was that for $16.95 I could find something to fill my stomach and get back to work. WRONG. The sushi contained no fish. The roast beef had the texture of a Goodyear tire. The Italian food was so bad I am horrified to think of what they have done to the cuisine of my heritage.
The chicken parm tasted worse than the dollar frozen food. The ravioli's were bad tasting mush and the sauce or gravy was pathetically prepared.
After that the limited selections left next to nothing to chose from. A mall buffet in northern Wisconsin blows the selections here away. I next moved to the dessert hoping I would find something edible. WRONG. The deserts were bland and I tried several.
One last point - at $16.95 this would have been a very bad mistake. Actually it was 28.95 plus tip.

The good-the honey ham from the carving station was great, as were the scrambled eggs, the breakfast sausage links and every desert and fresh fruit we tried. The desert station was all around great, especially the creme brule and cheesecake.

The OK- the French toast was so-so, as was the bacon, and yougert/granola station. The omlete station was pretty standard but was fine.

The bad- the only thing I had that was bad were the sausage patties, they were pretty dry and bland, go for the links which were great.

First time visiting Freemont Street. Our friends were starving when we arrived so finding food was on the top of the priority list. We settled with The Golden Nugget so we didn't force anyone into a major case of hypoglycemia. 

Considering we paid 20 bucks, on a weeknight, I was expecting something somewhat decent.... aaaand I was wrong. Everything had this wired gray hue to it. Mixed greens and spinach on the salad bar was wilted with small pieces of rotten lettuce intertwined. The romaine and iceberg was the only thing that looked edible. The beets were a strange hue of gray(ish)-red.  I wish I had taken a picture. I didn't even dare touch them. My fiance had a small portion of fried rice and chow mein on his plate and I couldn't believe he would even dish that stuff on his pale. Both looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for about 5 hours. SO dry and greasy looking. *gag* Steak offered was too tough to even chew through. My friend and I LITERALLY had to spit it out into our napkins because there was no chewing through that stuff. Simply horrible. Mashed potatoes tasted old and stale. Desserts looked like something you would find at your grandmother nursing home (then again, so did everything else). Apple pie had a filing that looked like it had come straight from a can...only with no apples in it. Just this wierd apple-jelly-goo. Its hard to mess up sugar, guys! They somehow managed. 

The only thing on the buffet that tasted even remotely decent was the carved turkey and scalloped potatoes. Oh, and the ice cream from the ice cream counter was edible.

I am giving this place a low star rating because of 3 items that ruined this Vegas buffet experience beyond repair.
1. Coffee- This was the worst coffee I have ever tasted. Was it even coffee? It tasted like bitter muddy water.
2. Breakfast steak- It tasted like freeze dried meat you get out of a military MRE. I nearly vomited after putting this abomination in my mouth.

The woman behind the counter did see it all and came over while I apologized and she stuck her hand into the pot of cream of mushroom soup, retrieve the lid, wiped it off from A towel on the back counter and replaced it back on top of the pot. I mentioned to her she should not be serving that soup to anyone because it's now contaminated with the lid and your hand. She just ignored me and walked away.

Since we already commited to walking all those stairs, we decided to give it a shot since the ladies guarantee us that dinner was about to start and some good seafood was coming out.

Right when we sat down, our waitress greeted us with bottomless mimosas! We quickly turned our frowns upside down, nothing like a little booze to cheer up our wallets. 

The food was so so, I just snacked a bit here and there because I wanted the dinner seafood selection. Raw oysters and crab legs! I was the first person to attacked the tray of oysters and something smelled a little fishy. Should realized it was a bad omen, but I continued down the line and got a plate of crab legs. The crabs were delicious, but the labor was just not worth it. After I finished up the legs I went for the oysters, it tasted a little off and warm. Needless to say, it didn't measure up to par so I stopped eating it. As I reached for my mimosa to wash down the weird taste, I noticed I was low on refreshment. I realized we switch waitress and that bottomless mimosas were only during lunch and not dinner. How disappointing...

Our drink orders were taken within 3 minutes and we were off to check out the buffet. And what I found was a very limited selection of items, in fact I will go so far as to say this was the most limited selection buffet I've been into in Vegas to date. But the thing that irritated me the most was that several of the stations had empty trays. As in no food. Some new items came out by the time we went back to check it again but it was too little, too late. 

The live stations were also a disappointment. The meat carver was working with a ham that was about gone by the time we got there. And 2 other stations were unstaffed. But it got worse. The ham was tough to chew, and the sushi, beyond missing some tags to indicate what kind of rolls were being served was tough to bite into. In fact one could buy better, more edible sushi at your local Smith's than you would find here. 

I honestly REGRET that I chose this buffet for the wedding party we were with, and there is no way, absolutely NO WAY I can recommend this buffet.

 We got there around 6ish and the food tasted fresh and was served hot. Nothing dry or stale here. I think the Chinese section was my favorite. the cook there was very funny and kept making jokes with me and my wife. He made this buffet very enjoyable. 

My favorite was the Chinese dumplings and the meatballs. We normally Eat at the Caesars Buffet so I am not comparing it to that. I am giving this place 4 stars for the value and atmosphere/customer service.

    After seeing the world's largest golden nugget on display, I caught sight of the Buffet sign. I meandered the maze of slot machines and card tables and eventually climbed the stairs to get to the buffet. Twenty(ish) dollars got me in and seated at a table where the two nicest ladies helped me out with beverages and taking away my plates. 
    My first round was certainly meaty. Pig, Cow, Fish, Crustacean, Fowl....no species of God's creation was safe from my appetite. ""Sure I'll try that."" ""Can I get a slab of each please?""  ""Oooh. Let's get some of those!"" I'll admit. My eyes were far larger than my stomach with this trip. Everything looked way tasty and smelled wondrous. I was also kinda sorta guilty about how many species of animal were about to be sacrificed to me.
    After plate number one I was considering throwing in the towel. Then one of the nicest ladies comfortingly said to me; ""Take your time. Digest. You can stay all night if you want!"" Thank you nicest lady. I really wish I remembered your name.  I broke out my game-boy and began playing video games for a lil bit to digest and clear out some space. Thankfully, I carry that thing for just such occasions. 
   After ten or so minutes, I made a stab at food sortie number two. I wanted to make my Mom happy, so I got a plate of salad. Crisp green veggies and red tomatoes. Even more numbers on the species list I suppose. All was refreshing and crisp and as good as these things can be.
    After the veggie plate, I decided to make a run on the dessert station.  I made sure to grab a full sized plate for this trip. Pies. Cakes. Cannolis. Moussey things and creme brulee things. I tend to overdo it on the dessert round. Of course, by this point, I was super stuffed and while unable to completely finish the things, I was able to manage a sampling of everything.  
 
   The buffet is great.  It's very pretty. It's very tasty. I'm sure Santa would have been happy. Or Jesus. It's his birthday...right? Happy Birthday Jesus!

Don't you tired when there are a lot of people who riffle through the food at a buffet? And what is left is a big nasty mess! Well, you don't have to worry about that when you come to the Golden Nugget Buffet! I must say it's rather clean, and very well presented.

I've eaten there mostly for breakfast & dinner in the past, and have always had a pretty pleasant experience. 

I was just here the other day for breakfast.........the breakfast buffet is not really large with a lot of selection, but what they do have is probably sufficient for you to fill your tummy. 

I do like that they have a carving station, and a chef that will make you fresh eggs or a fresh omelet.

Besides all the nasty breakfast meats - :Link Sausage, Bacon, Portuguese Sausage, Chicken Fried Steak, Spam, etc., they do offer a healthy fare too like oatmeal, cereal, or fresh fruit.

As for me, da local boy in me gotta have his Spam! Yes, if Spam was healthy.........I swear on my deathbed that I'd eat it everyday! That's how much I love Spam!!! 

For you folks (NFH) = Not From Hawaii..........Hawaii people eat the most Spam per any capita! 

Spam is da Hawaiian Steak Yo!!!!

See this link yourself - 
http://www.thehawaiiplan.com/why-do-hawaiians-love-spam/

And don't get me wrong, I didn't only eat Spam here.........I also had a fresh egg omelet with everything in it! And I must say the omelet was deeeeeeeeeeeelicious!!!!

To add some healthy junk in, I ate some grapefruit, then to ruin by healthy eating, I proceeded to eat a slice of cheesecake & bread pudding! LoL! 

Hey man, it's all about moderation right? LoL! 

Service here is pretty good, as the waiter or waitress is pretty attentive. They also leave you a big pot of coffee (if you're a coffee drinker), that way you won't have to keep bothering the waiter or waitress for a refill. How's that for efficiency?

Well, if you're ever in the downtown area, check out the Golden Nugget Breakfast Buffet.......pretty inexpensive too at just $12.99 per person.",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,13,14,4,m7bKx1cvmtDYsCMPjtrn7A

We ate there for Sunday brunch (yesterday) right around 10:00am. It's $18 for champagne brunch even if you don't want champagne. Everything was cold except the omelette/egg stuffs the guy cooked right in front of you. No hyperbole on that. Eggs, bacon, pizza, veggies, fried shrimp, rice, eggs benedict...it was ALL cold. We started trying things we didn't even really want just to see if it was cold. It was.

Fine, ok. You're hungover and you're just going to drink $18 worth of bubbles. Wrong. The service is sloooooow. You'll be lucky to have three or four flutes of champagne in an hour. They don't exactly take the time to fill the glass up to the top either.

If you get suckered into eating here by your friends, stick with the guy making the omelettes and eggs. That'll be hot. And you can toast the bread yourself, so you know that will be good. The omelette guy will, however, cook the ever living bejesus out of your omelette so that it's dry.",qJW4saNoJPll_b0y4PUZDg,7,2,1,Ct_1Xw_vU0uG7T5Iica0QQ

Waffles were soft.  The only fruit is cantaloupe and melon.  The omelet was good, and the bacon was crisp, that was the saving grace.  Service friendly but not great; it took a long time to get drinks, we didn't get refills and a manager had to bus our plates.  The main cashier was RUDE, and would not speak to us.  Literally zero words, we asked her questions about our coupon and using our Laundry's card together, and she would not even look at us.  Just told us the total.  It was weird, not gonna lie, felt like we were beneath her to even answer our questions.  There was a long line and she took the card, so we just moved on but it sucked to be treated that way.  It was really crowded too, but only because it was hard to know what line to get in to get food.  It was a crowd around one area, then dash to go next; everyone was polite but no one ever knew who was next or what you were waiting for (omelet station to the left, scrambled eggs to the right, syrup to the middle....ayyy).  Even with a 2-1 coupon from the hotel,  this isn't worth it.  I'm on vacation, why eat gross food with bad to terrible service?",GGPghxUw9iQLB9hi1h-dZg,2,0,2,zaUoffK6Pxy5f6b7d5h_2g
