24098,2013-07-24,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,If you like beer you'll love Aces and Ales. Over 20 craft beers on tap and a Tuesday special where you can try 6 and a different food each week for $20 was worth it. I had fish and chips with a side of pretzels. The food was great and the presentation is not at all what you'd expect from a bar. The people around me were pleased with their sandwich and nachos too. Misty the bartender was helpful and very friendly. My one complaint would be the prices a little on the high side for me.,sNqnKBO0r7VlwOr9A-vdaQ,3,3,4,KpS9GLCSYR_yFN1nMX79wQ

Well we had been sitting at the table and she had ignored us while flirting with some guy at the bar.    She then informs us that she saw us walk in and it didn't matter we were too late and the ""system"" wouldn't allow the sale.   Well our money spends just as well in a different establishment.  I was ready to leave.   My partner likes the beer selection and after working all day it was time to eat.   Jennilee then disappears after taking our order.  Never asks if we need anything, if we needed more drinks, are we still breathing.   Now the place was not busy.   There was 1 other table, 3 guys at the bar and a few people playing pool.

303468,2012-08-24,7,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"I wanted to love this place.  Everyone else loves this place.  But I don't.

I must be an oddball.

Anyway, I actually like the atmosphere here.  I like that it's dark and kind of divey with plenty of seats either at the bar or at the tables.  I like the super friendly servers.

I've visited a couple times and although the menu rotates, it seems to be heavy on (very) dark beers.  It's the summer and it's hella hot outside- can I get something a little lighter?  Plus, the prices seem a bit high to me.

As for the food, they have a decent selection for a bar and I'm impressed at the number of vegetarian options they have.  I've had the parmesan fries, fried cheese curds, and veggie pizza.  The parmesan fries are really good and the portion is large.  I have a mad crush on the cheese curds and like that they come with three different sauces depending on your mood.  I would come back to Aces and Ales for the cheese curds alone.

I was completely unimpressed with the veggie pizza though.  The dough was raw in the middle, there were too many toppings so it was watery, and the mushrooms were old and funky.  I let my husband eat it.  He's not picky

And just a fair warning not to get here starving.  Our food took forever to come out.

I think I'll give Aces and Ales another go if I'm in the area.  But it's much too far to make a trip when there are plenty of other places closer to me that I know I like.

I can see why there's so much love from people who appreciate beer more than I do.  I'm guessing I'm a dummy that doesn't know any better.  Oh well.

PS- Be prepared to get some odd looks and maybe hear a record scratch if you walk in as a newbie.  There are definitely regulars here that notice new faces.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,12,4,3,WT4GNv6qxK07B2MdCuPemQ

370646,2010-12-17,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"Hmm, let's see here... The beer selection is good for Vegas. The first bartender was friendly, but she couldn't tell me much about the rather eclectic draft selection of about 15-20 beers, which is on a chalkboard by name only--you don't know what a SuperBrau Fallen Angel is? Too bad, that's not on the board and the bartender might not know much about it.

Another reviewer mentioned something about a soapy glass. When I read the review I thought ""wtf"". When I got two beers here in soapy glasses I thought ""SERIOUSLY WTF !@#$%?!"" I know it's the desert, but rinsing glasses is neither difficult nor expensive.

Now for the real issue--the prices and service. I ordered a Tenaya Creek Hop Ride, a local IPA which was listed on the chalkboard. It came in a 10oz goblet (for a 'normal' IPA? really?). When I went to pay my tab, they'd charged me $8 for a Moylan's Hopsickle triple IPA, which they didn't even have! My other beer was a trippel, which was $6 for a goblet. I tried to ask the bartender who'd given me the check, but he was so quick to drop my check I couldn't ask and so slow to come back I'd run out of patience. I left no tip for the first time in 5+ years and got the hell out of there. I'd understand a bartender in a hurry on a busy night, but it was 8pm on Monday night and there were maybe 15 people in the whole place for two bartenders.

I understand Las Vegas is less of a beer town even than Salt Lake City, but this place is inexcusable even in Las Vegas. Soapy glasses and incompetent service shouldn't happen anywhere, especially not at a place in BFE across from a trailer park that charges this much. Looks like it's back to drinking beer from bottles in the hotel room for me.",c6_e-Ju3GqrTkgi6AlOktw,6,1,1,aAFhbPAbEMGyQsajnKu8tQ

471877,2013-08-19,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"The food and service here are mediocre at best (the mac n cheese is pretty good but the rest is nothing to swoon over). The beers are good (particularly since most bars in Vegas have subpar beer at best), but overpriced. They are clearly trying to stand out as a kind of gourmet pub... in a part of town that is far from gourmet (try ""seedy"" and ""sketchy""). The food and drink here are worth the price you pay total for a Groupon - not the amount on the menus. 

Although the actual food and drinks aren't terrible, the management is awful. If you have a Groupon - BEWARE, particularly if you live across town. They will deny your Groupon for ""special events"" that aren't listed on the voucher or in the fine print. So, if you're like me and you traveled to this place to try it out with a Groupon, they may deny it even though it's not written anywhere on the voucher.  

This place may be worth a look if you live nearby, but I don't recommend it to anyone going out of their way.",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,3,0,1,TwZ4stYmRa_pnHQRfavWLg

523235,2017-02-06,1,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"My dad and I went over to do Karaoke on Monday night a couple weeks ago... The Karaoke guys were good.. 1 of the bartenders has an AMAZING voice.. The only negative from that night is that the sign said it started at 930... Dad looked it up online it said Karaoke started at 9... Then the reality of it was Karaoke really didn't start until 10...The guy at the table next to us had ordered a pizza and it looked and smelled amazing....

This review is actually about our 2nd visit.. On Friday 2/3/17  my dad got home from work and asked what I wanted to do for dinner.. Then he suggested we go get a pizza at Aces & Ales... I agreed and we were really looking forward to it... We only live up the street so we make the quick drive over there... There are only maybe 5 total people in the bar and it's around 6pm when we get there... Super excited to try the pizza and extra hungry... The bartender is behind the bar.  My dad sits down in a booth and I walk over to the bar and ask if I could grab a menu from her.  She turns to me like I  have completely bothered her... And she says with a really bad attitude (especially for a person in a customer service industry) ""Can I finish what I'm doing first"" ... Both me and my dad work in customer service.. My dad is in sales and I work C/S over the phone... If either of us had spoken to a customer that way there would be a problem.. So I stood there waiting patiently while she did whatever it was that was soooo important behind the bar... (she wasn't interacting with another person IDK what she was doing)  My dad has a real problem when someone is rude to his kids... So he stood up and said he didn't want to stay because of her horrible attitude... I agreed... Which is too bad because we really really wanted to try their pizza.... As we were driving away we talked about it... I said maybe she had a rough lunch shift.. But after thinking about it every time I have been over there (couple times just to play a couple games of pool) the same bartender, short, dark hair, thick black glasses if I had to guess I would say head bartender) she has been there... SO then I think no she probably just started her shift.. with that attitude I definitely feel sorry for the rest of her customers that night... Too many people work in customer service that really shouldn't... I would have to say that she is one of those people... 
We ended up just going right up the street to Sam's town and ate at TGI Fridays... Pizza might have been better but I can tell you with absolute certainty that the service was 200 times better...Jennifer as TGIFridays was super awesome....",qYGYXf1PBLdeirYkexC3fg,1,0,1,eBDWGmgL58YUxxNBk9bA7Q

Usually we are greeted and the bartender always says HI I am blah blah. Today she was hurried and rude and ID us which is annoying BUT I get it.  I went and got my purse, she says ""oh you came back"". We sat at a table, she asks for my I'D and says ok momma..whoa..im not your mom. I let it slide...she returns about 10 minutes later takes our order brings the drinks..then about 15-20 minutes later returns with most food...then couple minutes later returns with the other food. About 30 minutes later, we are waiting...and I get up wait at three different spots trying to just get the check and boxes to take food to go. A woman says she is super busy today and that guy is sucking up all of her time, I say oh is she new I have never seen her. Apparently she is a night time bartender.

We end up paying and she said Jeff would be there in 20 minutes, we leave and call in 30 Jenny answers and said Jeff is to busy to talk to me and passed along the message for me saying that is says on groupon they have the right to refuse service...um hello Jenny & Jeff it was NOT about that we were served...even if it was rudely. JENNY also said Jeff would NOT be calling me back anytime soon. LOL Jenny jokes on you and Jeff and the lack of customer service because we all have choices where we go.

578266,2014-11-15,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"This is by far one of the best places to drink beer in Las Vegas. Sure, there are large chains that have more beers, but no place else has the constant variety Aces offers. At last count there were over 40 beers to taste. At each visit, the beer list is a drastic departure from your previous visit. They even have tap takeovers where breweries small and large get to showcase their selections. Certain bottles will always be available, but if you're looking for $2 miller lite, this is not the right place. 

Because there are so many options, I suggest a tasting. On Tuesday, there is always a tasting and food special. As far as the tasting, you get 6 of your choice and on Tuesday the bartender throws in one of his favorites gratis. 

As far as the menu, everything we've tried has been excellent from burgers and sandwiches to specialty Mac and Cheese. But the real stars as far as food are the Tuesday specials. They made a lobster bisque in a bread bowl one week that wasn't just good; it was astonishing. 

Lastly, the staff is friendly and engaging. Not sure what beer you want? They'll give you a sip before you commit. Confused what to eat? Tell the waitress or bar tender what you're drinking and they'll give you options for pairing.

     The taps have about a week long stay here, epic. I understand if you find what you like, you usually try to stick with it, but call me adventurous. I am always game to taste the 31 flavors. In addition to that, they sometimes pick up some extremely rare, or in some cases, ""mistakes"" from notable breweries. If I'm not mistakened, they featured the Lucky Bastard by Stone Brewing Co. I think the bartender mentioned it was made by error whilst doing another one opf their signatures, but they still went with it, and distributed only 60 kegs. A & A picked up 2, and I was extremely fortunate to taste, and buy a growler of the accident child. Dee-lish.
      Only downside is the PA system when they have live entertainment. Too much feedback, and sometimes the people performing, for lack of a better word, suck. Other than that, if you're a beer snob, you gotta come down there. Do a tasting, don't just stick to one. Get it while it's there, cuz they are constantly updating the beer menu.

We ordered drinks so few and far between that we became bored. The food came out slow and I even had to cancel the dessert because after over an hour and ordering it twice it still hadn't come out. After waiting an hour for my check I ended up approaching the server station to get it. That's when they offered to take the dessert off the check. I had six 4oz beers, two appetizers and the who thing took almost four hours.  The manager witnessed the conversation at the service station and didn't try to resolve our obvious dissatisfaction. Granted we did not ask for him specifically as we just wanted to leave. I really appreciate the beers and festivals that aces and ales have but they really need to work on the servers.

This is more of a Vegas issue than an Aces and Ales issue in my opinion.

The beer selection was pretty awesome, and only cost $4 each after the initial souvenir glass purchase of $15. We shared an order of the Nachos, which was more than enough food.

Beware: The cigarette smoke in this place is pretty overpowering. The bartenders cater to smokers. Smoking isn't technically allowed by law; however the bartenders supply smokers with Altoid Can ashtrays.

If you're a beer aficionado, then this is the place for you.  It is a dive bar, and it is in a sketchy neighborhood, but that seems to add to its charm for some reason.  For it's wide selection of beers, you will be happy to know that the prices are extremely reasonable.  The smoke isn't overwhelming either, and the place is well-ventilated, so you can actually breathe inside.

My friends ordered nachos, sweet potato fries and jalapeno poppers.  All three were delicious, but I found the most enjoyment from the sweet potato fries.  

The bar was large and roomy, with pool tables and your standard bar games like shuffleboard and Golden Tee (which I am just as bad at as I am actually playing golf).  The only con I can think of is that I didn't think it was a great place for live music.  Stage lighting is kind of bleh, and they have a railing in front of the stage for some reason, so if you're short like me it can block the musicians.

The guy that was there was about to get off the night shift, but he was very helpful, told us about all the beers available, and about the special beers they were releasing on black friday. Good guy. We decided to come back another night and ordered some beer. Beer didn't come. When asking the girl bartender, who took our order, she blamed the other guy for not bringing the beer and kept saying she wasn't even working right then. Beer still didn't come. When asked again, she once again blamed the other guy for not bringing it yet, and that she would go get it right now. 10 mins later she  finally came whipping around the bar with 2 beers and 3 waters. She then proceeded to spill all but one drink on herself and our feet. Then she disappeared into the kitchen. 10 mins later the cook came out to clean up the mess and also told us the girl bartender was pretty drunk. Sure enough, once she came out of the kitchen, she went back behind the bar and was taking shots. Then she sat down at a table with customers and began smoking. Awesome. I hope she didn't drive home after that evening as she couldn't even walk straight. It took us another 20 mins just to try and pay for the one beer that made it. The girl never talked to us again and the guy didn't seem to worried about taking our money. We should have just walked out. I don't plan on returning to this location ever.

Our server was knowledgeable enough to mention their vintages and even confirm we were okay getting young bottle of the Abyss.  Price-wise everything was pretty moderate, or compared to the beer prices on the strip...much cheap.

We also enjoyed all the food items.  A friend got the seared tuna salad and was pleased with the light sear on the tuna.  Their BBQ burger was excellent as well.  We also got the cheese curds and pretzel bites, I highly highly recommend both.

1088991,2013-01-24,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"Craft beer has blown up in the last five years, and I have joined the revolution myself within the last two, so on every new trip I plan out of town, seeking out local craft beer bars and breweries becomes my first priority. On our most recent trip to Vegas, I visited the overpriced Public House on the Strip, The just ""ok"" Triple 7 and Ellis Island brewpubs, the spectacular Tenaya Creek Brewery, and finally this little gem: Aces & Ales.

This bar was about 5 miles from the strip so it seemed each day we never had time to make it out there, so the last night I planned to hit all the local spots we missed throughout the week, that might have been my only regret saving this place till last. We arrived at around 2:40 in the morning, it was the last stop on a whirlwind bar crawl before we flew out that morning. I had a Groupon with me for $30 that only cost me $13 if I used it between midnight and three. I came in the doors thinking one no one would be there, and that the bartender/cooks would be pissed I was coming in with 20 min left to redeem a coupon, but I could not have been more wrong.

The place still had a great local gathering, and our luck Monday night was Karaoke night, its three in the morning and there are still about 10 people waiting to sing Karaoke. We joined in and signed up to sing, then made our way to the bar. I apologized in advance to the bartender and he was like don't worry about it man, I don't get off till 8 in the morning this place is open all night. Talk about culture shock, I can't imagine a place in Charlotte running those kind of hours and still pull a crowd as well.

The bartender Russ talked our faces off for 3am and was cool as hell to boot, he gave us the low down on growler prices, grub deals, and his favorite choices from what was on tap that day. He also told us we just missed a beer festival they had that weekend, another reason to kick myself for not coming here earlier. He also said they go through kegs daily, so each night something new is on tap. We took a couple of his recommendations and were not let down. I added some notes to my phone so I could bookmark my favorites, The Bruery Autume Maple, and Nectar Ales 2011 Black Xantus coffee stout, and then we grabbed a couple appetizers. The Wisconsin fried cheese curds were the best thing I ate the whole week in Vegas. Seriously they are bar food at its FINEST! My wife got the Beer bites, they were like little miniature pizza pockets covered in garlic, served with an amazing beer cheese dip, she loved them as well.

The service of our bartender Russ was above and beyond for a couple of tourists visiting Vegas at 3 in the morning. Tack on the sweet Karaoke system, the most affordable and nicest selection of craft beer I found in Vegas, plus the amazing appetizers, and this place was the highlight of local spots for our entire vacation.

We started with beer bites which is some variation of beer dipped deep fried bread.  And you get this variation at other bars and even some restaurants but I found them really tasty here.  I was really caught off-guard and surprised.  They were so tasty it really riled up my gourmand tongue and I wanted to try other foods here.  So we added the cajun mac and cheese.  It was also pretty outstanding.  Now I'm really starting to wonder about the food at this place.  Who ever went to a place that was a bar first and yet served really great food?  Crazy.

Just enjoyed the 2nd annual strong beer festival 2/3 days. Was kinda tired of driving and we tried A LOT of great beers,so many that I had to rearrange my favorites list. All of them are craft beers :)

We are getting to the point to where if they haven't quite gotten our names down, they certainly know our faces and hand us the list of craft on tap!
I love places like that.

This time we tried food (I kept hearing it was awesome, and I've only ever gone there to drink!) We had fried cheese curds, wings, and parmesan fries. I though all were amazing,especially the fries!!! They tease you when someone walks by with a tray of em. lol

The music was awesome last night and we met some people both in town and from CA that were all there for the same purpose-drink beer you can't find anywhere else!
SO of course I'll be back. :D",q5afJ8gTV5TPEOkzyeJ_WQ,5,4,5,lgPTy54P1QWAiA_9T8dZqg

When it was time to leave, we gave our bartender a $20 for tip because to our surprise she was great. We paid and left. The next day I noticed a 20% tip added to my amount. I called to speak to a manager and ended speaking to the bartender from our visit. I asked if there was an automatic tip charge on each bill. She said no and I left a message for the manager. The next day the charge was corrected and I received a call from the manager. He explained that some backs automatically put a 20% charge on tickets. WTF! This guy must think people are idiots. I let him speak and was trying to hold back my inner thoughts. I will probably not go back. So if you go to this bar definitely pay with cash.",F2ORpML3xjAYzkqrc3_c3Q,2,0,2,YURbfcC4nSow1Snd0Yp_cQ

She ""forgot"" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  

Video poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank.

We stumbled in late Thursday night for some late night dinner. We asked if there was service to the adjoining room (since there was no open seating in the main room), and one of the bartenders was cool enough to come over to serve us. We didn't even care that it took her a while to get to us, I was just happy she was willing (we would have left otherwise).

Jason's Juicy Lucy burger was stuffed with cheese, bacon and chorizo. He ordered it medium-rare but is seemed more rare, a lot of the burger wasn't cooked at all. He enjoyed it anyway, and the onion rings he got were also delicious. He also ordered an Arrogant Bastard Ale. I just got a plain cheeseburger and fries, cooked medium. The burger was well done, but the fries were phenomenal. Possibly some of the best I'd ever had. 

While we joked about how our burgers seemed to be on two ends of the spectrum, we also noticed that Jason's beer- now half gone- had expired nearly 6 months ago. When we let our server know, she mentioned that it was fine and she serves the same brew that has an expiry date of 2007 to guests that still request it, only IPAs need to be thrown out. Nonetheless, she offered to get us a new bottle, which we declined since we were about done with our meal anyway. I was just really surprised that they knowingly serve old brews, and still charge $12 a bottle for it. We aren't sure if we got an accurate taste of the beer, so we'll likely pick up a bottle at Lee's and try it at home.",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,4,1,2,emSXvhGFIuERusZnv-FWQA

Aces & Ales is a local bar with tourists (me - but I am not touristy), locals and bartenders from other bars all looking for a good cold beer without any sequins or women wearing feathers. 

There are two areas with pool tables, video poker on the bar,  a long comfy bench to sit back and watch sports and a character or two wandering around to remind you that this is Las Vegas.

The focus here is beer.  The food compliments the beer.  The sports on TV are a reason to sit and have more beer.  I want Aces & Ales to move to the Mojave Desert so I don't have to drive 4 hours to feel at home.

Food :  fried cheese curds - strangely good and addicting
             house mac & cheese - yum

If you answered yes to these two then Aces and Ales is your place. This place is way off of the strip but if your tired of 3 foot margaritas and domestic watered down beers, then get your ass over here and drink the good stuff. 

I came here for the 2nd Annual Strong Beer Festival that lasted all weekend. They really stepped up to the plate and hit a home run on the brews they got in. Really rare stuff that is tough to find in bottles let alone on tap. They set it up for 27 new beers on tap Friday through Sunday. Check the site for a list of stuff as there are just too many to list. 

The food there is your typical pub food and was ok nothing to spectacular although the Rosemary Garlic Fries are to die for. Pizza is pretty decent but my advice is don't get the fish tacos as they were not good at all.

I had looked at this place's website a few times, but had never made it over here. Moving from Denver I can be a bit of a snob when some place tries to say that it brews beer plus I've been into bourbon lately so I wasn't sure if this place would really be what I was looking for. I had tried to go to a PT's (see previous review) and left because there was no working kitchen. I had my heart set on a burger and read on yelp that this place was good and they a good selection of bourbon. So I decided to head over.

I pull up and am a little worried as the neighborhood isn't THAT great, but I'm hungry so I go in anyhow. I walk in and I'm pleasantly surprised how clean it was. I found a nice table a bit away from the bar, get out my computer (I was there to work and eat) and grab a menu off the table next to me. The bartender was super friendly, came over, and got my drink order. When she brought that back we chatted a tad about a few menu items and under her suggestions I stuck with a burger.

The burger came out incredibly fast. It was big and juicy looking with homemade fries on the side. I have to say that this is the best burger that I've had in Las Vegas. The meat was good and flavorful, the fries were tasty, and the service was great. I have to say that this is now my new go-to place when I want to grab a drink and some food.

***03/01/2013***I've down graded my review after a TERRIBLE experience. I went in last night really just wanting some food and a drink. I walk in and it's pretty crowded so I find a table and sit down with my computer. I was ignored for about 15 minutes. When someone FINALLY came over she goes, ""Have  you been helped?"" I really wanted to say, ""Yeah, this invisible drink and food in my hand is really helpful."" I ordered a drink and she then tells me, ""We have a party who has reserved this table in about 10 minutes."" RUDELY. I then ask where I can sit. She tries to tell me I can sit at the bar, but I point out someone is smoking right there, she snobbishly goes, ""Yeah, the whole restaurant is smoking. We have a back room."" I tell her never mind and she, with an attitude, goes, ""Well sorry then."" I left. Little does the chick realize that I tip very well and drink well too. Oh well, I won't be back in a place that has their staff dress like sluts and treats people crappy. I don't care how much I liked their burger.

Hubby had the Nogne O, which he quickly proclaimed to be the best beer he has ever drank.  I am not a beer drinker, but greatly enjoyed my ahi tuna sandwich (the wasabi mayo was lovely!).  I WANTED to try the deep fried oreos (what? what??), but I was too stuffed from my sandwich, piggie that I am.

I'm giving this place 4* because of the cig smoke.  Yes, yes, I KNOW that casinos are allowed to have smoke -- and Aces and Ales has a few electronic gambling machines -- but the smoke really bugs me.  Before all you smoky types tell me not to go to places with smoke, I will say: I normally avoid smoky places!  I wanted to support my hubby's fledgling yelp search and check out Aces.  We won't be back for a while, partly because of the smoke, but mainly because of how far it is from home (we live in the NW part of town, aka California....ha).

The receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.

I was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.  

I don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.

Normally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.

He ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.

Now I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.

2352789,2015-07-01,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"This place didn't disappoint, from reading the reviews about it and deciding to do a visit here. Since honestly, those who say the beer options can be a little limited near the Strip are right. It was a good stop to go to after Pinball Hall of Fame, since it made up for the fact that the beer options at some of the stores selling beer were often limited, save for some limited exceptions.

Didn't try the food(I'd like to next visit), but the service was friendly. I like how laid back it was, that you could play pool/billiards here if you wanted to in a side room, and that the ventilation was actually very, very decent for a smoking bar. It was the furthest from feeling like an overwhelmingly smoky bar, and they got the ventilation issue down correctly!

There are local city buses that do run out to this area too, both on Nellis Blvd. and Flamingo Road. Unlike some reviews I saw here, Tripadvisor, etc., the nearby area didn't feel creepy at all. I can see why some might be creeped out by seeing RVs and a trailer park, but it's fenced off from Nellis where it didn't bother me at all. I am more street savvy and watchful for dangers on streets vs. outside, so YMMV. Las Vegas' bus system does have a real time bus tracker, and there's a bus stop across the street so you can time walking leaving this bar, and catching the next bus on Nellis. There's a 24/7 Walgreens you can run into at Flamingo Rd/Nellis Blvd/Boulder Hwy, in case you have to kill time transferring to the Flamingo Rd bus, or vice versa.",6AKefJkxjEulK4TkmrLyEw,2,0,4,wC9C26w2KagJmdk-Q3bjOA

What other place gets Deschutes Jubelale, seriously?  Even craft beer nerds from San Diego or Portland would be at least moderately impressed with Aces.  Sure, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  It does sort of feel like a dive bar.  But the craft beer selections here are the best that Vegas sees.  From Port Brewing to Double Dry Hopped Stone IPA to Belgian sour beers, Aces is the place for the true beer nerd.  

The food has also improved since my last review.  I love the salads.  Try the Tuna Ahi Salad or even just the Caesar.  Awesome stuff.  If you don't like healthy food, the rest of the menu will definitely give you a delicious heart attack... at least you will die happy!  

It is worth mentioning that Aces has events almost every weekend.  For example, the owner of Stone, Greg Koch, seems to visit annually.  Other great breweries that are new to the Vegas market take over the taps at Aces to offer their finest selections.  Parking can be a PITA though, so be prepared to park behind the gas station out back (not in front!).  SNAFU, the local homebrew club also has their monthly meetings here.

It would be superfluous to underline the same noteworthy qualities this unique bar has, but as the saying goes, ""repetition is the mother of learning"", so here goes: 
 
Off the beaten path location that only adds to charisma of the place...check! Extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff...check! Hearty choices of food perfect to accompany beer...check! But, first and foremost...prime and diverse selection of craft beers that you can't find anywhere else in Las Vegas...double check! 

As the incomparable Shakespeare would say ""A quart of Ale is a dish for a King!"" and this adage does not go to waste at Aces & Ales! 

However, all things being equal, I want to add something that has not been previously mentioned. From my own point of view, the secret weapon of Aces & Aces lies with the magnificent server Debra. When there was no food, she personally served us her amazing stuffed artichokes! They are so unequivocally succulent and sinfully delicious that they should definitely be on the menu! When our glasses were almost empty, she was quick to suggest other beer options based on our previous choices! When we felt like sharing stories, she was a perfect listener. Debra was attentive without being intrusive, the most distinctive quality a bartender should possess. She made us feel at home without being regulars! I have to give this shout out to her because she made the whole afternoon truly wonderful for us!  

When you go to Aces & Ales, you get more than a buzz, you get an unforgettable and unique Las Vegas experience. Was it Edgar Allan Poe that said:""What care I how time advances, I am drinking ale today""?

I like the other location in Tenaya better just because of the selection. The main reason I come to Aces and Ales is for the beer so if given the choice I would go to the wests side version for proximity and tap list. 

Still Nellis isn't bad for this area and they have a solid rotating list. Staff is friendly and the biggest plus is their back room with shuffle bids and a bunch of tvs which offers this location a nice party room which the other Aces doesn't have.

The food is pretty tasty, particularly the many variations on mac & cheese, but not worth going out of your way for.

I love going to places where people are outgoing & friendly. It really makes you want to to return. I wish I can add another extra 5 stars for having such a great bartender.

Firstly, the place doesn't give a hint of the glorious temple of craft beer inside. I mean, plenty of bars mention beer in their name ""The Copper Keg"" and consider Blue Moon to be a ""craft brew"". When you go in your only real indication that at first is that the beer mirror decor is of a much rarer caliber of brews.

The tap list bitch slaps places like the Yard House and Pour 24 on their wannabe faces. This list was chosen by a master. A Master of masters. The Bottle list is a ""what's what"" of the last five years of craft brewing. One wonders how the owners get these beers. The taps are even available in smaller sizes so you can sample  some of the pricey exotics.

We got the tasting sampler. The waitress (Misty, who was spectacular BTW) made a passing comment that made me to believe the tasting/sampler was a Tuesday thing, and if it is I recommend going on Tues, because for $20 we got lots of large amazing samples (they MADE us pick one and yet it was the best) and tamales(?!) for some reason. But hey, Tamales! Also we got Chili Cheese Fries. These were spectacular as well.

They have events here, and the upcoming one looks spectacular if you enjoy good beer. Apparently Alice Cooper also plays here too. I'm sure that's lovely. 

If I were a less honest man I would give this bar no stars, because it was getting a little full on Tuesday and I always want a barstool. This bar does have one negative, and that's it got smoky when I was there. I know poor smokers have been thrown out of almost everywhere, but if it was perfect for me there'd be no smoking. However, from the service to the selection to the prices I would've originally assigned this place one f*cking billion stars. So maybe take one from that. Yelp only allows five.

Stone Double Dry Hopped IPA
Stone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers

Stone Imperial Russian Stout Bourbon Barrel
Stone Smoked Porter w/Vanilla Beans

Big Dog's Sled Dog Stout

The Pizza was awful.....0 Stars.  I'm a Pizza lover too and I'm very tolerable about bad Pizza....but this one was soooo bad.  The crust was tough like cardboard and the ingredients were subpar.

Tap selection was not only impressive and prices very reasonable, but they have an electronic board for the tap list that shows the approximate QUANTITY OF THE KEG and changes its color from green to red when it's low. F'in genius! I love that and I wish more places would do it, because it just pushes the beer snobs like me to drink something we may have otherwise passed up, but then regretted not getting when they're out of it next time.
A nice round-up of pretty much everything good you can get in the area, including Sierra Nevada Narwohl, Stone Double Bastard, Maui/Jolly Pumpkin Sobre Humano, a couple of Speakeasys, a Dogfish, a Uintah, etc.
The food menu is actually pretty impressive too. They have a few pizzas, one of which has spaghetti on it. The bartender (who was really nice and helpful) insisted that it sounded weird but was delicious. We got an order of Beer Bites, which showcases their pizza crust, and is served with a homemade, mustard-based sauce. The sauce was a little weird, but I love that they're trying something unique. Bread itself was excellent. The people next to us got a pizza... Food envy...
I'm a beer bar guy, but I also like sports. And they have lots of TVs. This is a problem at many beer bars who often have no TVs or maybe one, in a corner, with a 14"" screen. Why can't I watch a football game while drinking an excellent craft beer? So this may be exactly what I want from a beer bar.
Downsides are, of course, the smoke. They also get a pretty weird crowd for a place that serves what could only be called ""gourmet beer."" A lot of MIller Lite bottles passed around while we were there. Didn't think much of the music either, but I'm probably more snobby about that than I am beer.
Staff were awesome. Really can't say that enough. Willing to answer annoying questions and give tastes. Very knowledgeable about the beer. They also have a pool table, but it's in a separate room, so it's not really noisy.
I also have to give props to the bottle selection. They have an enormous menu and a cooler full of specialty bombers that they've collected and will sell for a collector's price. If you have someone to share with, I would recommend going that way, if you can resist the taps (which is tough), because it's just that good.",P-7VidyXqOGd6zBnT85pDA,1,2,4,pqtZlSavT6Ga5mjirw1how

4107169,2018-03-16,4,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"So far, 1 for 1.

Aces & Ales is a bar that's surprisingly close to my ""Northern"" Henderson home, enjoying its own home alone in a small lot just off Nellis about half a mile from Boulder Highway. At first glance, it doesn't look like anything special inside, but a wall of tap handles from depleted kegs and the updated draft list itself (also available on their web site), which is chock full o' interesting craft beers.

Happy Hour was just the right opportunity for me to show up. It's 4-6pm and midnight-2am daily, except for Sundays (when it's all day). Draft beers, wine glasses, and cocktails are $2 off, as are appetizers. Also, pizzas are 1/2 off at this time.

I've been exploring the world of craft beers for a while, and Aces & Ales has reportedly been one of the best if not the very best bars for that sort of thing in town. I finally showed up so that I could try my beloved Canadian Breakfast Stout ($8 happy hour, $10 regularly for the 8 oz pour), aka CBS. It's a pricey limited-release bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout by Founders Brewing Co which I'd completely enjoyed before at a different bar. This time, the coffee was far more prominent in the flavor profile compared to the expected maple and vanilla flavors, so I didn't quite love it as much as my first time, but I appreciate that Aces & Ales was offering this particular beer on draft.

Next, I picked up a glass of the Modern Times's Mega Blazing World ($5 HH, $7 normal for a pint), having not tried this ""imperial"" version yet of one of my favorite San Diego brewery's amber ales. This one barely had the typical amber-ness because of hoppy flavors filling the palate before and after it had warmed up. I liked it though, and it didn't taste very bitter at all.

At this point, I wanted to order Black Market's French Toast Vibes, but the bartender asked me if I wanted a small taster instead, perhaps thinking that I hadn't liked my 2nd beer's flavors because I'd slowed my drinking pace so much (no ma'am; I was feeling the alcohol). I accepted the offer and got to sip on a surprisingly cinnamon-y and syrupy stout, which I'm sure I would have enjoyed had I ordered the full 11 oz pour ($6 HH, $8 normal).

Instead of that, I picked another option, which was North Park's Mocha Massage ($7 HH, $9 normal for a 11 oz pour). This is my first taste of another San Diego brewery, one which a beer-loving San Diego friend had lauded before but not been able to fit in my hectic day trips yet. It's also marked on the menu as an ""exclusive,"" which the 'tender said was because it's not distributed through normal channels in the Las Vegas area. Instead, someone had driven there, gotten special permission, and ""imported"" it. Anyway, the Mocha Massage is easily a top 2 if not favorite coffee stout for me, with huge coffee flavor in every sip but low bitterness.

I almost let the occasion pass without ordering any food, but with the $2 discount for appetizers, one of the two Devil's Eggs variants ($4 HH, $6 normally) sounded too good to pass up. It's four pieces of what appeared to be large eggs (maybe jumbo?) and this recipe was topped with smoked salmon and flavored with dill, oil, and lemon. The eggs were delicious and not overcooked, the smoked salmon was as delicious as my drunken palate could have appreciated, and the other flavors were balanced. I was very happy that I changed my mind.

Aces & Ales simply rocks (including the music, which was heavy on alternative rock with some classics thrown in). I haven't seen much more from a bar than a wide variety of rotating craft beers, good food (well, at least the one item), regular check-ins by bartenders, and relative proximity to home. and the weekday happy hour visit was a lovely time. I will be back again for their happy hour and/or Sunday all-day happy hours.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,5,prXhbzFYcbQrT-YMD-mqVQ

My most recent visit, however, left something to be desired. The joint was filled to the hilt (AFC/NFC Championships + Winter Beer Fest = crazy go nuts), so understandably service may not have been as awe-inspiring as last time. But the beautiful ladies serving us were a bit rushed, occasionally pushy, and slightly clueless in terms of communicating with one another. But let's get to the point, shall we?

Winter Beer Fest = $15 for a SMALL commemorative glass (cool), $4 to fill said glass with whatever (meh). Those not choosing to participate (like myself) HAD to pay for $8 pours. There were no other regular-priced pint options of ANY kind. I mean I am super happy to have gotten some of these heavenly concoctions into my tasting arsenal. Don't get me wrong. But it is hard to justify $8 for EIGHT OUNCES of something when it doesn't ordinarily cost as much. Boooo. I felt slightly ripped off; I don't mind paying a hefty penny for variety, but I don't feel the same ""WOW!"" factor as I did before. Plus, it's too dark.now.

Anyway, A&A is definitely worth the side trip if you're at all into the brewed alcoholic beverages. Stop by between 11-3 (am OR pm, I believe) for happy hour -- check in on Untappd to see your name scroll by on the sweeeeet electronic beer board -- but try to avoid anything that has the word ""Fest"" attached to it!",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,2,2,4,FvxuFYLWaAXzVrbWZee94Q

On our way to A&A we got a little lost, but were able to find it. It is situated on the East Side of town near Sam's Town & Boulder Station. The first thing I noticed other than the very full parking lot, was all the microbrew and craft beer posters and ads on the outside of the bar. Not your typical ""Coors Light"" or ""Corona"" signs here. Walking in we were greeted with a fairly large bar area to our front and some pool tables to the left. The bar itself is pretty large with lots of video poker is that is your thing. Because it was pretty full, we went to the back of the bar area to find a table. Once the waitress made her way over to our table (it took a while because it was so busy) she was very friendly and helpful. After that point she was great for the rest of our time there. Looking at what they had on tap at that time (not for the Festival) and it was a good mix of styles and local and non-local brews. 
As far as the Festival goes, the selection was incredible! Many different styles from many different brewers. The staff was very passionate about these beers, and it was obvious.

4315033,2014-08-03,1,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"Truly an Ace!! This place is not your typical bar and a huge relief after seeing so many PT's pop out throughout the valley.

Layout: We got here on a Monday afternoon at around 5 but soon after began to pile up for their huge karaoke night that started at 9pm (unfortunately we didn't have enough time to stay for it).  When you first walk in, there is a decently sized pool area on the left of the bar.  Continue to the right and the main bar is situated in the center with a few tables surrounding and a lone billiards table on the opposite end of the bar.  The area we sat was decorated with old beer levers, tap levers? whatever they're called but was really cool (the beers labeled on those levers are not all available for drinking).

Service:  Our server was really nice and warned us that he was new but was motivated to make sure we got great service.  Later towards the night the billiards table ate my money and the bartender working there was very friendly as well
*to play billiards ask for the balls first, once you're done and all the balls are inside, insert your four quarters to get them out.

Food: Now being at a bar across town, I didn't want to opt for the traditional wings and wanted to choose something more original and specific to this location.  The selection of food is just right and you're not too overwhelmed with selections (like at cheesecake factory).  We picked the shrimp mac and cheese ($12.5), arrogant bastard onion rings ($6) and the Eddie Spaghetti pizza ($20).  The shrimp mac and cheese was probably the cheesiest i've had a mac and cheese.  Literally the cheese could be stretched from one end of the bar to the other.  Macaroni itself wasn't tough and there were a generous amount of shrimp.  Overall mac and cheese was like a 4/5.  The arrogant bastard onion rings were PHENOMENAL!! The batter on the rings were none that i've ever had before, so crispy, onion will preserved and just so much taste in that ring.  It comes with bbq and ranch but the ranch is enhanced with a blend of herbs to give it such a rich garlicky, cilantro-eeyy taste.  The pizza was also amazing and massive (16 inches).  The pizza has a spaghetti base with the cheese, sausage and pepperoni placed over it.  This was a delight!

Alcohol: As the name suggests, there are only ale based beers on tap.  I think I saw someone drinking stella from a bottle but the menu features mostly ales.  The menu is extensive in terms of beer and other alcohols, literally like 6 pages of alcohol so I leave this part of the experience up to you! The only drawback were the serving portions of the alcohol.  They're not served in mugs or cups but in a shot glass that fits 2 big shots.  I mean the alcohol was there and got me feeling good, the content was a bit small.

Overall: This place is a hip bar that offers a great alternative to your typical bars in Las Vegas.  Good selection of amazing food and alcohol, a fun and friendly environment to just hang out with a friend or to party and sing along with potential new friends.

I do understand why certain high ABV beers are served in a goblet but a tiny white wine glass does permit of at lest one eye brow to be raised.

great ever changing draft beer selection that doesnt even warrant a look at the bottle list. Ive had the pepperoni pizza that left much to be desired with the pre made frozen crust but the belgium pomme frittes are astounding to be modest. fried extra crispy with copius amounts of maytag blu cheese and REAL CHOPPED BACON!!!!!! trust me one appetizer is a meal for two people.

the staff is extra friendly and while some may not be as beer savy as the patrons they are definitely eager to get your feed back.

this place puts Freaking Frogs draft list to shame. Not sure about the bottle selection but like i said no need here! their draft list changes faster than your kids fashion sense. Plus they are consistently hosting amazing brewer shindigs and events.

We came on a Monday around 6 and it was fairly busy. We were able to grab a table in the corner and a server came by quickly after we sat. He gave us a menu of what beer they had available and I was sad the girly ones were out (pale ale & hefeweizen). He then asked if we were first timers and let us have a taste of one of their beers based on our preference. It was still too strong for my taste. We then ended up ordering a beer that said something about having raspberries and the Nip Slip martini which tasted like lychees. Both were good, but verrrry strong! I was babysitting my drink because I knew a lightweight like me couldn't handle it.

Now onto the food! It was what I initially wanted to try here, beer came second. We got the arrogant bastard onion rings to start off the meal and paired it with the shrimp mac and cheese and Eddie spaghetti pizza. Talk about carbs overload!! And they don't skimp on the servings, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees is more than enough for 2 people. We had to take home most of the pizza and half of the onion rings home. 

Arrogant bastard onion rings: everyone has raved about them being the business and I would have to agree! I didn't care much for dipping them in the BBQ sauce, so I asked for a side of garlic aioli and it worked much better. 

Shrimp mac and cheese: it came with 2 pieces of garlic bread on top. It was some of the cheesiest mac I've ever had. The best way to describe it would be a cheesy version of shrimp linguini, with a touch of lemon butter. It was different in a good way, but having it as mac and cheese was just throwing me off.

Eddie spaghetti: advertised as a deep dish pizza and it's ADDICTIVE. I was sad to see it wasn't truly a deep dish when we got it, it was more like a regular pizza topped with spaghetti and sausage and pepperoni. But my disappointment left me after my first bite, it was delicious! The pizza crust was buttery and crisp, reminiscent of pan pizza.  

We played a couple games of pool also.  We made the mistake of putting in money first.  Don't do that!  Ask the bartender for the balls and use your money at the end of the game to give the balls back to you.

My husband loves the craft beers.  The sign outside says $4 pints, all beers, all days.  So, we go inside; it's very loud.  Not very many people in there at all (for a Saturday around 6 PM).  We're handed the large menu with the bottle beer selection, other drinks (I'm a wine drinker), and dinner menu.  We were also given a sheet of paper with the craft beer selections. Between the lighting and the very small print on the paper, you couldn't read the selections.  We were told there were boards posted to the left and the right of the bar, but DAH, we were seated and wanted to relax and order.  I ordered a white zin and while the bar maid told me the brand, wasn't recognizable; it was awful.  Why not get a Sutter Home or Berringer like a lot of bars.  Reasonable prices and not bad tasting.   My husband order his beer and gee, guess what, it was one of ""the beers"" that didn't come in the $4 pints.  He ordered a second beer, different type, and guess what again, it still wasn't the $4 pints.  When he ordered his second beer, he told the bar maid when you come back we'd like to order dinner.  Long story short: she came back with his beer; no mention of food; & when we saw her again, we asked to settle the tab and went elsewhere for dinner.  Doubt we'll every go back.

I'm fairly new to the craft beer scene. In fact, I used to not care for beer at all. I'm really enjoying what I've discovered recently. My buddy is a beer snob and has been schooling me on the finer points of the brew. Honestly, it all goes over my head. I just know what I like.

We finally made it down to Aces & Ales because of a Deschutes-related event they had on Saturday night. My friend is all about this Oregon brewer and he didn't want to miss this opportunity.

As soon as we stepped in the door, we wasted no time. I asked the bartender about her favorite Deschutes. I put my trust in her and ordered the Jubel 10. It was probably a little strong for my first drink of the night. At 10%, it definitely got me going and I never looked back. It's not really my type of beer, but I still enjoyed it.

Next up on my itinerary was the Hop Henge, followed by the Hop Trip. I thoroughly enjoyed both beers, but I'd give the edge to the Hop Henge. It's a little sweeter and exactly what I hope a good IPA would taste like.

I took a break from the Deschutes and tried the Sah'Tea by Dogfish Head. It's supposedly infused with some chai tea. It was OK, but not really my cup of tea (pun intended). After that, I rounded out the night by switching back to the Hop Henge.

Somewhere in the midst of all this beeration, we ordered an interesting menu item - Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds. It just sounded intriguing on the menu and it was even better in real life! Those cheese curds were perfectly breaded and fried, and were incredibly light and delicious.

The down side to all this hoppy goodness is the price. We spent a good amount on the night, but you get what you pay for. We also got to meet the owner of Deschutes. He offered to give us a free round, but by that point, our ride had arrived so we had to bounce. Our consolation was a free Deschutes glass.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,9,11,5,Rz7Aa7fQsLt_cBhVv87_Sg

4720991,2017-05-04,1,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"I really should have done a review on this place before, as we are regulars and love this place.

First off, if your into craft beer, this is probably your best spot to go in all of East Las Vegas (though there are plenty of good places in Henderson to). They have twenty drafts that are constantly changing. Some beers may only last a week, some longer, but they don't have anything permanently, so there is almost always something new.

Prices are very reasonable, with most 16oz pours in the $5 to $6 range. They always have a few high gravity pours that run $8 to $9 for 8oz, but they are usually worth it. And they will almost always let you taste whatever you want. I usually only get the expensive stuff during happy hour, when all drafts are two dollars off. They even comp the 16oz pours if your gambling ($1 average of course).

Speaking of happy hour, it's 4pm to 6pm everyday but Sunday, when happy hour is all day long. If you have a growler they will fill it for half price on Sundays. This makes most of their beers $10 for a growler fill, and $22.50 for the pricy stuff. Honestly you can't beat that price for 64 ounces of high quality beer.

One more note on happy hour, they have half priced pizza and food specials. There half price pizza is obviously homemade and blows PTs half price pizza out of the water. Most of the delivery pizza places I have tried around here aren't near as good, and you can get a pie for under $10 during happy hour.

And all there food is good. I've never had anything here I didn't like. They are known for their mac and cheese and have some great sandwiches.

Oh and we love the staff. All the bartenders are friendly and do a great job. Dani and Kim are who we usually see (based on the hours when we come in) and they are great, but everyone else we have met had been good to.

I honestly have friends and coworkers that have told me how lucky I am to live down the street from this place. They have two locations, though I have never been to the other one, but I can attest that the Nellis location is awesome. If you are a fan of beer and/or bar food, and you are on the east side, this is a must try.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,3,0,5,2niuAtYFG2jCOW4iYTWigg

This place is for beer connoisseurs. My favorite feature is the keg TV, yeah, I'm not sure what else to call it. They have a few flat screens throughout the bar that display what is on tap and how much they have of what's on tap left. Example: You'll see the beer name ""Moose Drool"" and next to that a little picture of a keg, if the keg is fully lit green, you're good! They have a full keg waiting for your consumption. If the keg only has a little red color at the bottom of it, you better order your next beer quickly b/c they're almost out.

The pizza/bar food is good, especially after you've had a few. They could speed up service to the tables, but if you're hanging around enjoying some beverages then you shouldn't really be in a rush anyway. They have a lot of events and growlers! You can purchase a growler and ANY beer on tap to fill it! Bring it back and refill it with whatever you want as many times as you'd like. Of course, there is a charge, but its minimal for what you're getting.

The dudes who run the place know a lot about beer and are always happy to chat with you about particular beers, styles or breweries.  They also have festivals (Winter Ales, Strong Beer) throughout the year where folks can come in an get smaller samples of special beers. (NB: these are not your typical beer festival where an entrance fee covers unlimited tastings; you buy a small (7 oz) glass and then pay a reduced price for a 7 oz tasting of beer.)

They have a large menu that even includes a few vegan and several vegetarian options!  They also serve booze if you wanna bring a beer-hating date.

They sell (unopened) bottles of rare beers to take home to enjoy, and also growlers of draft beer.  Prices are a little on the high side, but worth it if you love craft beer.

When we walked in, it was very dark.  Extremely dark, to the point it was hard to read the menu.  I guess my eyesight may be getting worse as I get older....

The wife had the chili.  This was served in an interesting way, in a dish with tortilla chips.  They were good chips.  The chili had a nice crust of melted cheese on top.  Unfortunately, it didn't have much chili flavor.  It's like someone made chili without a majority of the seasonings.  I certainly liked the presentation, and it has potential, but needs some heat, or at least flavor.

I had the juicy lucy.  This was a VERY solid burger.  4 star burger.  Chorizo, American cheese, and onions cooked in between 2 large beef patties (the toppings weren't exactly inside the burger as in a traditional juicy lucy.  But, I won't complain when you give me so much flavor that the large burger can't contain it).  A very soft bun that somehow was strong enough to hold it all together.  I put a little mayo on it, but it probably wasn't needed.  An excellent burger, and one I would gladly order again.  On the side, I had fries.  They were also very good.  They had parmesan and garlic on them.  No ketchup needed...

I will say, I am not entirely schooled on the smoking laws, but the server let 2 people smoke at the bar.  The first one was not close enough to bother us, but the second one was.  Maybe smoking is completely allowed here and I missed the sign.  The wife left early due to smoke.  Maybe this was a one time thing, but it's something we will have to consider before eating here again.

After checking their tap list online, I saw they had Dogfish Head's Immort Ale.  Since I had never had that, or seen it available in LA, I made the effort to get there.  It's not located near most of the other areas I go during a stay on The Strip, and it does require driving (which is a never-do for me in Vegas) or a substantial cab fare.  The closest recognizable landmark that I saw was Sam's Town.

This place is huge, but it was empty when I went in the afternoon.  They have pool tables, darts, and video gambling machines.  They had classic bar food that I did not see or try.

The beer prices are reasonable.  One great thing is that the ALWAYS have Rouge Hazelnut Brown Nectar for $4.  If you go here with a girl, have her order that and she'll love it.

The bartender was more beer-knowledgeable than a typical Vegas bartender, but she was not knowledgeable enough for me.  I had to guess at some of the beer styles based on the names, and she did not know who brewed some things, or where they were brewed.

My best advice:  Check there tap list online (they have daily specials too).  If there is something that interests you that you cannot get at your favorite craft beer bar back home, go here.  Actually, if you're a craft beer fan, go here and support.  They also support homebrewers, and the local club hold their meetings there twice a month.",bnbzD42aiJwtAuLl8EfLww,6,6,4,MF52R47BlcCg0u6TEmX6Ag

So you buy the commemorative cup and get a free first cup ($15ish I think) and it was $4 after that....or just $8 for a regular goblet. The ""tasting cup"" was sizeable, about half a usual goblet. I like the idea of getting various taste and some of these are rare so I have no complaints paying the per taste than the usual- drink yourself to a coma- flat rate.

Got to try today-  Sierra Nevada Chico IPA, Samichlaus Bier, Deschutes Red Chair, Deschutes Black Butte XXI, Rogue John John Juniper, Kasteel Donker, Red Hook IPA (they were pouring for free!), Joseph James Red Fox.  I got some onion rings and they were solid bar food rings. 

The minus was that it was hot inside. It was packed in there so I'm sure the body heat doesn't help, but this place isnt really well ventilated and made for it being stuffy.

I was going to try to go to all days, but it was hard to do. Just getting here is hard....I think next time it might be worth my while to buy a growler of beer to bring home something worthwhile a trip (price depends on the rarity, but growlers are pretty reasonable- $15-$20+).",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,8,4,Ry1BU_dPEmzZK9mIBplC5w
5083383,2015-08-12,0,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"For me Aces and Ales is the best bar in Las Vegas.  There are a few things I really care about when I go to a bar and those are Beer selection, and the food.

The bar itself is very unassuming, and in a less then desirable area in the shadow of Sam's Town on the east side of Las Vegas.  Inside the bar is dark, with gaming at the bar, and seating at tables around the outside wall.  Several pool tables and a shuffle board in a separate room by the entrance. Overall the appearance of Aces and Ales is very unassuming, and on the surface docent appear to be anything special.

Aces and Ales has a rotating Tap list that is never the same twice.  This means you will always have a fresh selection of beers to choose from.  I have yet to find another place in town that has a better beer program.  They also have amazing Tap Takeovers a few times a year with different themes.  This is typically where you will find the ""whale"" beers that you will have a hard time finding else where.  Overall this is the place to go if you are looking for good beer.

Bar food is something I truly love.  Simple food like cheeseburgers, fries, and chicken wings are made so poorly at so many places around town.  Aces does all of these things right.  The Eddie Spaghetti is in my opinion the best pizza in town. They make incredible burgers, there fries are always crispy, and there chicken wings are always amazing.  I cannot say enough about the food at Aces and Ales, they have managed to elevate the run of the mill bar food to something really really amazing.

The worst thing about Aces and Ales is that you have to choose between all of the amazing beers, and food options they have.",4VvvaddDORTcmkUS8zQE6w,2,0,5,yZ63SsNan5ZDrmjIZ9uBlQ

I am a beer-drinker, but nowhere near the connoisseurs that frequent Aces and Ales. There was a special selection of Rogue brews on tap starting tonight, and the occasion brought out some deep beer lovers--avid home brewers, the Beer Meet-up organizer. In addition to sipping the suds on tap, they brought out special bottles to share. Passion was in the air.

Because I am just a lowly drinker, I can't say that I am the most qualified to determine the quality of the beer selection, but based on the survey of the crowd, this is the place to be. I trust them. They did mention Freakin' Frog and Yardhouse, but for straight-up quality and not quantity, they agreed Aces delivers best. I tried the Rogue Hazelnut: delicious. I also tested a Belgian ale. The name escapes me, but I wish I could have handled an entire glass! I had to drive.

When I arrive, I was starving, so I ordered some grub. I was impressed to see a veggie burger on the menu and sweet potato fries. The veggie burger was a pretty standard Morning Star-esque patty, and it came on a sesame seed bun with a nice stack of lettuce, onions, tomatoes and pickles. It was charred agreeably. The sweet potato fries were a tad salty, but I finished every morsel of sustenance on my plate. Overall, it was a solid offering for bar food. I would not be afraid to come here hungry.

As for the physical atmosphere, the bar was a large, clean and comfortable video-poker bar with pool tables. Nothing trendy or thematic, but I was impressed by the lack of overbearing smoke, and the fact that one TV station was dedicated to music videos on FuseTV.  Plus, the co-owner is the guitar player for Alice Cooper. That earns bonus atmosphere points, as does the friendly staff. 

I am torn between 4 and 5 stars. I am a sucker for bold interiors, and Aces is a straightforward bar. Still, I know that most of the people coming here see everything through beer goggles, and if designer ones are your thing, then this is 5 stars all the way.

Their beer selection isn't as vast as the Tenaya location, but they still have GREAT beers at great prices.

Crafthaus (my FAVORITE local brewery) Centerpiece Sour:  AMAZING.  I'm new to the sour beer side of things, and I just loved this.  
Delirium Tremens:  My second favorite beer of all time, I had two of these.  This beer is SO much better on draught, rather than out of the bottle, I will definitely come back here the next time I want one, instead of buying a bottle at Lee's. 

I also tasted a handful of other beers that my friends ordered, including 2 scotch ales that were delightful, and a gingerbread porter? (I was drinking, so I don't remember if it was a porter or not)  They were all tasty. 

Shall I talk about karaoke?  
Everyone who reads my reviews knows I'm a karaoke junkie and snob.  
As a former KJ myself, I'm really picky about my sound, and queue management.  

Kool Katz Karaoke did a phenomenal job.  Their sound was great!  Their selection isn't as big as some other companies, but they are willing to try to find songs for you if you write them down.   And their books are kept up to date, which is a HUGE undertaking.  Mad props!

The KJs all sang too, which is a pet peeve of mine, but there wasn't a HUGE crowd of singers that night, so it didn't bother me much.  

The regulars who go there to sing are all AMAZING, but don't fret if you're not the best singer.  They were all supportive and encouraging!

All the appetizers were delish....and OH MY GOSH the deep fried oreos were amazing. Im pretty sure I am gonna dream about that.
The boys drank/sampled at least 20 different beers, and were ready for more, but carrying out 15 grown men from a bar would 
not be easy, so thankfully they had enough....for now.

Monday nights they have a huge karaoke following. Starts at 12 AM. Karate Karaoke. You can earn you way up to a black belt. It's a great way to meet people and to people watch.

Aces and Ales is located on the East Side of Las Vegas near Sam's Town. If you are not a local, it is not more than a twenty minute ride from the strip and it will give you more of an affordable/local selection on beer.

Aces and Ales has over 20 taps that constantly change throughout the year. Some of the local taps they may have on include selections from Big Dog's Brewing Company, Tenaya Creek Brewery, Joseph James Brewery, and Chicago Brewing Company. Outside of that, they tend to have fantastic selections of some of the nation's best craft breweries such as: Epic (UT), Stone (CA), Deschuttes (OR), Lagunitas (CA), New Beligum (CO) and much more!

The food selection is amazing for bar food. They have some of the best bar pizza in town and some interesting creations such as the Eddie Spaghetti Pizza or the Metallica Meat Lovers. The Mac and Cheese menu is very good as well with many different selections to choose from. Every Tuesday each week is a special event known as Tuesday Night Tastings. In this event, the chefs at Aces and Ales create an appetizer or dinner item that comes with 6 4oz tastings of beer for $20. Some of the most recent TNT offerings included a Krispy Kreme Burger, Lobster and Crab Bisque, and Baked Oysters.

Aces and Ales also has some very big beer events! Every first Friday of the month is SNAFU---Southern Nevada Ales and Fermenters Union. This is a homebrew club that meets at Aces and Ales and partakes in sharing their brews and stories with each other. Every Sunday is Black Market Crash where all beers are $4 and there are half-price Growler fills. Aces is also known for its festivals including Stone Domination Tap Takeover Weekend, Strong Beer Fest, and Winter Beer Fest. On many occasions as well they will have brewery take overs (most recently as of 3/19/2013 by Epic Brewing Company and one by New Belgium) 

The ladies and men that work here are some of the most friendliest staff you will find in Las Vegas. They will gladly talk beer with you and as well give you recommendations based off your own personal preferences. 


Over 20 taps always pouring great beers! Outside that, the staff is super friendly! Bar food is killer....go for the Belgian Frites or fried cheese curds. This is by far the best beer bar in town.

5541542,2010-06-06,2,-OEIW0dO96-492qa_luxaw,"Vegas Baby!!! One of our favorite destinations to visit for both work and for pleasure. It has become a yearly April tradition - driving up for the broadcast convention, walking the convention during the day, and then, hittin the town at night. But every year - there's always the same dilemma. Once we're on the town, where do we go for good craft beer?

I wouldn't say we are beer snobs because we don't make other people feel bad about their lack of beer knowledge. We just enjoy good craft beer. Okay, rather, good craft beer is a necessity in any place we decide to dine or chill.

We made our decision. Our first stop would be Aces & Ales. We decided to fly to Vegas this time around so we were a little concerned about the cab fare. We were staying at PH Towers on the strip, and the cab ride wasn't bad. It was well worth traveling off of the strip. Our previous experiences in Vegas had taken us to Triple 7 Brewery (mediocre at best, although cheap) and then Burger Bar (super nice servers, okay selection) and a little pricey. Aces & Ales seemed right up our alley. It ended up being the best decision we made.

We cabbed at about midnight and the driver pulled in to the empty lot. You can't miss it - there's a huge, TALL sign that says Aces & Ales. We walked in and the bar was pretty much empty except for a few locals. We expected it to be quiet though since it was a Monday night and it was off of the strip. We were instantly greeted with open arms (I was wearing my Bear Republic shirt, my fiance his Russian River). The super friendly barman Eric instantly chatted us up - and the beer talk began. He showed us the menu - and it was awesome! Not only do they have an insane amount of bottles to choose from, they have an amazing selection of beers on tap - very unique - things we have never experienced before. As soon as I saw Dogfish Head Red and White and my fiance saw Dogfish Head Burton Baton on tap - we knew we were in for a long night. We never thought we'd actually experience good craft beer in Vegas!

Then, we met Ryan, one of the owners of the bar, and he was soo nice! It was like we had known him for years - and we talked for hours. And when I say hours I mean HOURS! Before we knew it - it was 4AM!!! That was the coolest part for us! Amazing craft beer available 24 hours a day! I am soo spoiled by our visit. Needless to say we left VERY happy, and with a few good to go bottles under our belts.

We were told that Keri, the other owner of the bar would be there on Wednesday, so on our way home, we made a farewell stop to Aces & Ales. He was beyond nice - and it was just soo great having conversation with people that actually know good craft beer! Every staff member we met was super super nice also. We only wished we had a few more hours in Vegas (they were having a Deschutes Jubelale tapping that night). But that's just an example of what types of beer the get in (and they were nice enough to have a sample of it before we left :)

The atmosphere is soo cool - pool tables - poker machines at the bar, and Flat Screens which would be great for Sunday football. Just enough of Vegas to make it Vegas without the inflated prices and snobby people. Prices are inexpensive. No $8 Coronas here like they are on the strip. They also have a happy hour from Midnight through the morning.

We've since been back numerous times, and were fortunate enough to go back for their Stone Brewery Event, where they even got CEO/co-founder Greg Koch to fly in.  It was an unbelievable experience - getting to try rare collaborations before anyone else!  We also ate there a few times - and couldn't believe the quality of the food - especially for a bar!  The onion rings and sweet potato fries are to die for!  

I can't say enough about how great our experience was. If you are ever in Vegas - make you sure you stop by!",CK6w4REQliKRmBtJ-YArOA,2,4,5,c7iSIeYnfIf1aJk7P6497w

I was very impressed with the selection of beer, as I love microbrewery beer (sorry still can't get used to calling it ""craft beer"").

We stuck mostly with some of the Dogfish Head beers, including Midas Touch (my favorite saffron beer that I've had at Todd's Unique), Red and White (has a little Pinot Noir juice in it), and Black and Blue (blackberries and blueberries).  I loved the black and blue the most out of all of them.

It was fun hanging out and meeting Misti, Jacob, Jen, and Jade.  The food looked really good too (Misti and Jen ordered sweet potato fries), but I had eaten at the M resort buffet earlier in the day and I was too full to eat anything.

I would definitely come here more if I lived close to here.  I also think the prices are a little hefty.  For now, when I want my beer fix I go to PT gold or 32 degree bar at M resort for some hefeweizen.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,2,4,YQMIIyLEvI1XPXcySL3FAg

I don't want to pay the outrageous prices at Yard House...plus, they may have ALOT of beers, but none of them are really that out of the ordinary or unique (IMO).  My skepticism continued when I entered the bar, it looks just like any other bar in Vegas - dimly lit with a large bar, filled with smokers and video poker machines.  The beer list is definitely what sets them apart.  They had a great selection, which included one of my favorite beers, which is just now becoming available in the area.  The waitress was friendly, and when there was an issue with our tab at the end, she fixed it quickly with no arguments.  My Mom and I shard the Wisconsin fried cheese curds and an order of the garlic parmesan fries.  Both were really good, but the fries were really amazing.  The garlic aioli dipping sauce was SO delicious.  I would love to try other things on the menu.

Seemed like a large crowd of locals, but the bartender was very welcoming.  She went over the tap list with us (which was pretty extensive for Vegas) and then she offered up the specials which were a coconut porter or a pineapple hefeweizen.

Take a look at the rest of the reviews for A&A. A lot of people make the trek out to this place--that says a lot. Let me mention again that it's at Nellis and Twain. It's not the best of neighborhoods but we've never had a problem with that.",6THXbAhvo60OGr-1lwSeLA,4,4,5,HXeQNUpJ_2xaGUsJr-U_DQ

Once you've been there a couple times, the bartenders get to know you and remember your name, they always have a GREAT selection of craft beer on tap, and the atmosphere is great for having a night out with friends.  Misty, Jenny, and Kim all do a fantastic job tending to customers, even during the busy times like the annual Winter Beer Festival.  The food is amazing, get the cheese curds!!  Also, try any of the grilled cheese plates, they're a great deal at $8 and come with fries!  Delicious.  No other bar can compare when it comes to craft beer on tap!",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,1,2,5,9Sr3dLBXgpotKMkRXtwHOg

My dude got me into this place after getting me into craft beer (I was a willing recruit for that, though I give him all the credit). It's a bit out of the way for me, living in Henderson, but I still manage to get over there quite a bit. I mean, holy crap, they've got taps for days here with some really awesome stuff, and they get switched out all the time. Check out their website for the newest additions. There's around 18 craft beers on tap at any given moment (with still more in bottles), ranging from local to nation-wide stuff. They've done events around Deschutes and Rogue, as well as Stone, I believe. They also do an annual Strong Beer Fest in the fall, which I got to attend last year (that still sounds weird to say -- feels like earlier this year!). We've gotten to know some of the bartenders quite well, and they always take care of us (Jenny, Misty, and Kim, I'm looking at you guys). I've also had probably around half of the things on their ginormous menu by now (the menus themselves are literally ginormous, evidently a printer error, but their selection isn't bad either), and I've only ever been slightly disappointed in one thing (the ahi tuna sandwich). Ok, maybe also the cheese curds, but that's only because I'm so in love with the ones over at Rum Runner. Otherwise, I can vouch that their appetizers, mac & cheese, pizza, sandwiches, wraps, and grilled cheeses (new menu section for those!) are all super delicioso. Between all the beer & all the food, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask them to start sponsoring a gym membership for me. How dare they have such awesome offerings.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,3,2,5,h_4vZHBaa2uXc1cpxsNR3Q

I got the Meatallica pizza last time I was there and it was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  Big too!  Leftovers carried me through the next day as well.  Sara, the weekend graveyard bartender is awesome sauce.  Only complaint I have is that it's sooo far away from where I live, so I don't go as much as I'd like to!",dpr6pJo-OkayVuoYkmf2hA,1,1,5,XJ0yvLHBC7hIi2ByUIoMvA

When I saw the Groupon available, so I was excited to get it to force myself to try it out. I waited until two days before the Groupon expired to redeem. 

We came tonight to watch some Monday Night Football and get some beers and grub. I'm not a beer connoisseur, but I do enjoy trying different types and was excited by all the variety here.  

I ordered The Cheese, mac and cheese. It had amazing cheesy goodness. My fella got the wings and my mom ordered the pastrami on rye. The mac n cheese and pastrami were my favorites. I really wanted to try the fried cheese curds, but maybe next time. The food was excellent pub grub and there were tons of other things on the menu that I'm excited to try.

As for the service, it was excellent. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive. She made excellent drink suggestions and kept our drink refills coming. I was very impressed with the service. 

Looking forward to coming back again soon. I won't be a regular, for the simple reason that it isn't conveniently located to my house, but I'm excited to try their happy hour and getting the tasting glass on my next visit to try more beer varieties.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,7,5,8e7g6vd0qmrYexErQ56SvQ

There are so many delicious beers to try and some bottled ones to take home. Next time I'm going to not DD so I can try more!

Happy hour snacks: holy grease fire, batman! We had the beer bites, parmesan fries, onion rings, a couple of the grilled cheeses, and a cheese pizza - everything was tasty but I think we just weren't drunk enough to really appreciate the amount of grease these things were soaked in. 

Like many other bars in this 'hood, it is smoooookey in here but you (unfortunately) get used to it after a while.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,3,2,4,jENIvCdfSLfFzfeXBRxjVA
