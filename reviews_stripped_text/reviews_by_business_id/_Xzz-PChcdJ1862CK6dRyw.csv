Food: 2/5
We tried the sampler that comes with 3 half toasts. The House Favorite was decent and so was the Sweet Tooth, but the Breakfast Crunch was not appetizing. The granola tasted stale and the peanut butter had a weird after-taste. In my honest opinion, it is ridiculously expensive for toast I could have made at my house. 

Service: 0/5
When we first came in we weren't greeted nor did any of the workers care to explain their menu. We were just looking at the menu and were not acknowledged at all. The staff came off as very snobby. 

Drinks: 0/5
I had the nastiest latte and cappuccino of my life here. I ordered a latte with 2% milk and it didn't taste like there was any espresso in my latte. It tasted like overly steamed milk. My sister ordered a cappuccino with almond milk and it tasted like the milk was spoiled. We threw the drinks away immediately because it was so awful.",3zf53USnWVkoESWD-RswJA,11,1,1,j_B9TulGqKKqSzRHDNCwCQ

I'm from Los Angeles and the only thing I can't figure out is why they opened this in the middle of Las Vegas rather than in So Cal (probably an economic decision). Yes it's expensive but is it worth it? Definitely, if you are in Las Vegas this is a must try. Healthy menu with all real ingredients and no sugar added to anything. That's what I look for when eating out. This place has the cutest decor. I would totally decorate my future home like this. I actually have the same pink velvet on a bench in my apartment. They have gluten free sourdough and sweet potato toasts too. Anyways go here, it will not disappoint!",pC9GmiKIo7bWrNOJO9K0Kw,1,2,5,rY4vMWEjP1VEx_6W-WYG7Q
1635433,2018-06-10,1,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"I had high hopes for this place and it hardly reached my expectations. 

This café has a modern, minimalistic, LA-style to it with their clean lines, subtle baby pink accessories, and a pineapple wall accent. 

However, the taste of the food is just average. I ordered an iced 12oz matcha latte and their signature ""Just Beet It"" toast. All of which cost me $17.02; this is definitely a bit of a higher end cafe. 

The toast itself costs $10: toast, beet hummus, avocado, feta cheese, and some greens sprinkled on top. It was good. Nothing about it stood out. I didn't see a sign if the ingredients came fresh from a farmers market or is organic, so I don't understand charging that much for it. Makes sense if it is, but if not, might as well add a side of a small salad, or small healthy cookie, or some fruit so the plate doesn't appear so bare. 

I understand that we're paying for ambiance here, but $10 for toast placed on a pink plate was not worth it. The toast was presented well, a 4 out of 5 on the aesthetically pleasing scale, but I could make this at home for far less $$. 

What killed me the most about this place was my iced matcha latte ($4.50). It tasted like a cup of almond milk with ice. I couldn't even taste matcha. Not sure if it was just today or if it consistently tastes like this. 

The service here is wonderful though. They're very welcoming. One of the workers opened the door for us to allow us in. The register also crashed while I was waiting in line and the cashier apologized for the delay. Someone returned after awhile to ask us if we were doing okay and how our meal was going. 

Café decorations wise, this place is great for a foodie's instagram. Meal is presented well, but leaves you with an unfulfilling feeling that makes you even more hungry; unsatisfactory for how much the toast costs. Overall, a good place to try once, but won't be returning.",Y7E4Q4xHfuW4w1o5KUNWuw,5,1,3,YTjSkPpD69nO49tlsVqu_Q
1688786,2018-06-03,0,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"I've been anticipating the opening of Toast Society, toast is so popular right now I couldn't wait and it is right down the street! We went the second day it was opened and luckily we went at 10a there wasn't anyone in there and the crowd came right after. As soon as we walked in I was in AWE the place is absolutely gorgeous. The color scheme is chic and beautiful yet minimal. We were greeted by everyone and they were so helpful and welcoming. I opted for the ""flight"" it comes with three of your choice. They all sounded so good! The ""house favorite"" is absolutely AMAZING. I've never tasted something more amazing! I wanted to come back for seconds later that day. I also opted for an iced matcha unsweetened, it didn't need extra flavoring. The flight came out and the presentation was mouth watering! I've already spread the word to friends  and family! I'll be back at least once a week!",LBnjYRrpTKgtGkW0ea7Ecg,2,3,5,NRj0LWLkUs6XctoQj_nh7A
1993595,2018-06-22,5,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"Met up with a Yelp friend here between various appointments and we were so paralyzed with indecision that we ordered two toast flights (3 half toasts) to try all of their options. Add on a couple lattes and a tip, and breakfast was $50 for three slices of bread and some coffee which is kind of insane. Like, I did it, but I still can't really understand why. And it was actually quite a nice morning.

The service is polite and friendly and the toasts are actually good. The Lox, Just Beet It, and the House Favorite were my top picks- my preferences skew more savory than sweet. Turmeric latte was mostly milk but props for having alternative milk options available (coconut and almond). They also have smoothies and yogurt bowls!

TLDR: Modeled after toast cafes in California, with the price tags and style to match. It's a gorgeous spot, don't get me wrong, and the food is actually pretty tasty, but everything is a couple bucks higher than it probably should be. And yet, the people will come.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,12,4,pvWgcQrHblgJjZ4LTdZyfg
2228541,2018-06-12,1,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"The space is adorable and so very girly. The food is amazing and the bread is dense yet chewy. The prices are pretty high and def a $$ place and not $ as shown. Most toasts are $11. The toast flight, which has 3 half toasts is a whopping $16.50, but it's so freaking good and while you can make it at home, the quality just isn't the same. For instance the beet hummus... It has chunks of slightly tart beet in it. Never seen that anywhere before. Generous amounts of cheese on there too. 

The staff is very nice and service is quick. Come see Natasha!!",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,3,2,4,zc8h1wjIvsD1g12-MRlfUw

I first heard about this place from following RachelGoodEats, as she is one of the co-owners for this place. This unique and creative idea for a cafe/restaurant is absolutely amazing and just what Vegas needed!

I am a huge avo toast fanatic, and this place was has one of the best avo toasts I have ever had. I got a toast flight with the house toast (avo toast), the sweet tooth, and the goat and Pear toast! All amazing and all given the option to use sweet potato toast or glutten free toast.

This cafe is super hip, young, and fun atmosphere. It is also an Instagram worthy place and I will be coming back for sure!",5qBTq4XLs-3ch4AxRXXNmg,3,4,5,58WGSy5JDIGwgbNEr2VoaQ
3333657,2018-06-09,0,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Lunch on a weekday wasn't too bad of a wait.  My toast was made fresh and out to me in less than 10 minutes.  Fresh ingredients and really picture-worthy dishes.  Though very niche with only toast on the food menu (smoothies and coffee as well), I do really like the flight of toasts where you get to choose 3 to sample.  I began with the lox toast.  The toast itself was a hard wheat (not a connoisseur on toast but that's what it seemed to be to me).  Lox was chewy and fishy and fit for a bagel; but still third best of the toasts.  My next indulgence was the beet hummus toast.  Really easy to eat hummus that didn't overpower you with the flavor of the beets.  Harsh cheese and a lot of salt from the toast actually complimented each other a lot to make this my favorite.  The avocado toast was as good as any in town.  Fresh tomatoes, sliced avocado, and again fantastic, heavy cheese.  A complaint of mine was that these dishes, although they look awesome, are simply impossible to eat.  There's no ""sandwich"" option so everything either falls off or gets all up in your face with each bite.  Tasty, but a fork and knife type of meal.

Restaurant itself is very clean and bright and relaxing.  Prices are high for a meal that might not fill you up, but the presentation is probably worth a little upcharge.  I paid a little less than $17 for my flight.  Overall a cool little spot.  Few outdoor seats and takeout somehow available (weird, as I'd think they want it to be presented a certain way and take out always looks worse).  The workers are very nice and are constantly out and about on the restaurant floor seeing if people need anything else which is nice for a minimal, casual-service restaurant such as this.  I would definitely come back, especially if the menu gets updated.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,2,1,4,jKD4vyNxeTocSzTpn-S79A
3354082,2018-05-30,2,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"Yes! Score! A ""toast"" of thanks to the clever ladies who just opened the now trending Toast Society in the Southwest!  During lunch hour I swooped in to take a splendid journey through the crafty and flavorful concoctions by ordering the Toast Flight, for $16.50 you get to sample three halves of any toast, so I pulled the trigger on the Sweet Tooth (cinnamon, strawberries, banana and Nutella spread), the House Favorite (cherry tomatoes, feta, micro greens, smashed avocado, sea salt, olive oil drizzle), and Just Beet It (roasted beet hummus, micro greens, feta, and avocado).  All three were phenomenal ""toasty"" creations that starts with quality bread and layered beautifully with quality toppings. Photo worthy and definitely coming back soon to try more. Furthermore, the decor is light and appealing, indoors has plush pink velour seating against the wall, outdoor seating, and a refreshing coffee and smoothie line up. For now, hours are 7am-3pm, so make sure to bookmark this classy place or head on over. You deserve it!",LC_o79IQTseA2Qi41v_rMg,7,5,5,0w3IqmSPk0AbZLornhco8g

Overpriced toast flight that's average in taste and unfulfilling. Turmeric latte with coconut milk doesn't even include coffee, you have to add the shot to it...ps no one mentions that to you when you order.

Best of luck TSC. I hope you'll improve as you learn and grow and listen to customer feedback to evolve.",wb0wLO0waKCmEhwmgMdSkA,2,1,3,lC5giEYiv8cnnMDWsl3RVA
4352262,2018-06-28,0,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"Definitely had high expectations for Toast Society since they only offer toast and drinks. The photos online were absolutely insta-worthy, but the real question was whether or not it was any good and worth the price. There are already so many places in Vegas that relies heavily on the aesthetic and look of their food more than the flavor. I'll just cut to the chase and let you know that the toast is worth it.

We got the house favorite, toast flight (house favorite, toast & lox, perfect pear), chai latte, and matcha latte. 

The toasts themselves are tasty and packed full of flavor. The ingredients are simple but good quality, and all my avocado toasts at home pale in comparison to Toast Society's. The house favorite was creamy from the avocado and feta, slightly nutty from the sesame, and fresh from the tomato. It's truly a match made in heaven. The pefect pear is lightly sweet with a good bite from the goat. It's a good toast for those who want a sweeter toast without smothering it with sugar. It's a fresh take on an old classic.

The drinks were hit or miss for us. The chai latte was great. A little sweet in my opinion, but my friend loved it. It's more up to personal preference, but I'd definitely get the chai again but I'd get it a little less sweeter. The iced matcha latte was a total miss for me. I got it sweetened, but I don't think there was enough sugar. I didn't taste too much of the matcha since the milk was overpowering everything else. At that point, it was more of a matcha flavored milk. There are other places in vegas that can do matcha very well, so maybe opt for a different drink like the chai.

Overall, very cute cafe with great toasts that surprised me. I loved it and would come back when I'm feeling in the mood for some good toast. It's a little pricey but it's something I'd go every once in a while. The drinks are decent, but I wasn't a fan of the iced matcha latte.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,1,0,4,dLmHbh12bKi8o_PmOZ58Ng
4382759,2018-06-22,0,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"My expectations for Toast Society were high after seeing friends posting on social media. Toast Society definitely exceeded my already high expectations! 

First impression is that the café is adorable inside. I loved the modern desert feel with cool cactus wallpaper and surprisingly comfortable pink chairs. Over the counter are large menu boards showing the toasts, bowls, smoothies, coffees, and tea options. 

The woman that helped us (maybe the owner?) was very friendly. She chatted with us while she took our orders and made our drinks. Later she checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. I love when business owners have pride in their business and appreciation for their customers.

Sharing is a must when dining with a foodie friend. We each ordered a flight of toast which is three halves so that we could try all six toasts. I loved all of the toasts, both sweet and savory. The toast was quality grain bread and all of the toppings were fresh and light. 

If I had to pick I'd say my favorites were The House Favorite and Perfect Pair. The House Favorite ingredients worked so well together and the quality sea salt really enhanced the flavor. The Perfect Pear really did perfectly pair the goat cheese and the sweet ingredients of pear and honey. My Chai Tea Latte was also delicious and a drink I'd order again.

I'm sure a common complaint about Toast Society will be the cost. I'll admit that at just over $20 before tip for toast and a latte it is on the pricey side. In the end I felt that it was worth the cost for the quality of the food. The ambiance of the shop made for a fun spot to meet up with a friend too. A little pricey? Yes. Worth it? Yes.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,2,5,dITCXf0Lr2H3rLUlSqz9fQ
4417718,2018-06-21,1,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"I know what you're thinking...$11 for toast?! I know. It's crazy. The mom in me says I can get a whole box of diapers for that. BUT...it's amazing. The hipsters were right, and I won't be buying an house anytime soon thanks to this place! I kid...I kid...on with the review!

I got the House Traditional: toast with avocado, microgreens, cherry tomatoes, feta, and hard boiled egg. The flavor profile is complex. My  main concern is that the toast would be similar to what you would make at home...when you always get the edges too crispy and it cuts your gums. Not the case. The bread is really thick and just slightly seared on top. 

The interior is pristine and minimal and gives you a sense of ""ahhhhhhh."" It's just peaceful to be in. I couldn't budget eating this every single day, since I'm pretty thrifty, but this is definitely a healthy treat.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,5,2,5,a2K4J7AGFN97eWDunP_GBQ

I've tried the avocado toast, the pear and goat cheese and the PB honey one.

The bread that they use is super soft and dense and overall I like the toast here.
My only suggestion is that they should used a poached egg rather than hard boiled and it should be included in to the price.

One thing I really don't like is their smoothie prices. $9 for a small maybe 12-16 ounce smoothie is ridiculous. That's something I'd expect in the cosmo but not in the suburbs.

It's easy to feel kind of ripped off here. I'd come here every once in a while if I'm really craving it but overall just an average experience.",XOCyTfXy26xi4gZeun9v9w,1,0,3,n5clPqgUHa68yJBtNdoy1w
4910440,2018-06-06,0,_Xzz-PChcdJ1862CK6dRyw,"Once again, another cute cafe has popped up in Vegas, this time, with a unique concept: health-centric options with an emphasis on the ever so trendy toast. I heard about this cafe the day it opened and I was very excited to try it out, telling many of my friends about it. Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing albeit, unsurprising. Don't get me wrong, this place was incredibly cute, with pale millennial pink and cacti/succulent/pineapple/geometric shapes as the overall theme; however, the food was incredibly overpriced! As I said earlier, I wasn't surprised by this since most trendy places are shooting their prices up as well, but my line was met when I paid almost $15 for a chia seed bowl and a simple drip coffee with almond milk (my friend paid $18 for a toast and drip coffee which was even more absurd). The food was sup-par, which made it even harder to accept the large amount that they charged, and what disappointed me the most was that my coffee was not hot and the amount of milk was barely noticeable. It's quite a shame with the potential that this place had, but I was not impressed.",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,2,1,3,abpcFdLwJTbUJnYdOOWpzg
