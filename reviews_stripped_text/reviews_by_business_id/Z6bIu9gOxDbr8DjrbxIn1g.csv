While visiting Vegas for my bachelor party, some of my friends and I wanted to get sushi while we were in town, so we ended up at Hyakumi for dinner. We were seated at a teppanyaki grill and introduced to our awesome chef! 

We were served delicious cups of hot and cold sake and Japanese beer. We each ordered a sushi roll, fried rice, and chicken or beef hibachi. The sushi was sensational. The fish was fresh and colorful. The spicy tuna was my favorite. Nigiri is also served. Combined with the hand cut rolls, there are nearly 40 different varieties. The hibachi was amazing as well. I got teriyaki chicken that was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful.

The girls and I enjoyed doing sake bombs and joking around with our grill master as he lit things on fire, made a lava volcano from perfectly diced onions, and flipped his weapon of choice (spatula) in the air. 

All in all, we had a wonderful time! The food and atmosphere was great, so I wouldn't mind coming back for more sushi the next time I'm in town!",rGyxhmfO0lvOHswUndr0xQ,1,0,4,YsfQXvTfG2Zx4AE5TM4o3g
