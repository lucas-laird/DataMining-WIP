I'm a lover of all that is sushi and so when I had one of my common sushi cravings and I just happened to pass by this place, I said to myself, ""why not."" BIG MISTAKE. I was actually just going to get take out cause I didn't feel like eating there. So i went to the bar for take out orders and was not even greeted by the bartender with a menu for like 15 minutes! Then when he finally gave me a menu he has the nerve to tell me, ""i'm running a little bit late and i have to set up for tonight. do you mind just writing your order down for me?"" At first I thought that was so lame, but being a server myself It thought, ""yeah, why not. it happens. i'll give him some slack."" So i specifically wrote down what I wanted and was still very nice to the bartender. He took the paper I wrote my order on and I had to wait. Then when my order finally came he got two things on my order wrong! He didn't even take off his mistake. I was more than willing to NOT take it with me. Duhhh! It wasn't what I wanted.

Whatever... this actually happened a few months ago and I can barely remember all the things that I was so mad about because I know that there were more things that I was quite upset about. I was really livid. I've never been this unhappy about take out in like.. forever!

Sushi wasn't even that great! Yuck! Overall, I would NOT recommend it. I would actually recommend against it. No wonder the place is so dead all the time. I drive by this place all the time and they never seem to have too much business.",hMhR3gETfQ60S4agBkTJPw,1,0,1,GZf67dZq-yy_50AO49oWzw

They have selections that will satisfies anyone's budget. They can order from an entree of $13 all the way to +$50. The portions here were also generous. If you have group of people and everyone's on a different budget, this is one place that everyone will be happy. Just be prepare that the entire meal is around 2 hours if you're planning on watching shows or trying to get into the clubs. 

You order whatever meat you want and the chef will put on a show for you and cook your meal in front of you. They do all the chopping and flipping right there on the hot grill. The BF and I shared the scallops and ordered an extra side of fried rice. It was accompanied with soup and salad. I like this place more than Bennihana's back home for one reason and its because of the sauce. Hamada will make the sauce for your seafood right on the grill. Something about the grilled scallops and a freshly made lemon sauce with sesame seeds tastes soo good. They also have other selection if you want sushi rolls to their bento combination meal sets.

From the look of the parking lot, there were only a few cars parked; whereas, the two restaurants next to it where full of cars. This should have been our first clue not to enter the restaurant. The staff were very nice and quick...which they should be because there were hardly anyone inside. The prices were way too expensive for the food they brought out. We ordered some appetizers: gyoza (not bad, but it seemed like it was store bought), and a sashimi appetizer (big mistake as it was way too expensive $13.95 for two tiny/thinly sliced of salmon, 3 tiny pieces of tuna, and 2 tiny pieces of white fish and it wasn't fresh at all). For the main course, we ordered the Love Boat ($54.95)...again, big mistake! The Love Boat included some California rolls (not bad), steak and chicken with some kind of sauce (NASTY), shrimp and vege tempura (not bad, could be better), siomai (tasted like store bought) and some eggrolls (tasted like store bought). Overall, we spent $84+. Never will we come back to this restaurant. Was very disappointed and the lack of customers on a Saturday night should have warned us not to come in.

Went to the original, main location.   Ordered the sushi dinner (~$30), some dinner combo with a tuna tartar, shrimp tempura, terayaki chicken, a delicious rolled beef-with-scallions thing, and some salmon roll (~$34) and a spider roll (~$10).  sushi dinner was one each of salmon, tuna, whitefish, squid, egg, squid, surf clam, and a set of tuna rolls.  the dinner combo was HUGE, more than any one person could reasonably eat...   all the food was very good - on par with the better sushi restaurants I've had in Boston, NY, or Portland.  Spider roll was very good - well sized, and the crab flavor came through.

overall, we spent ~$100 on a very big (too much food) meal for two, at high quality (no liquor or beer).  Would definitely go again, but the sushi dinner and the combo and extra roll were about right for 3.",p3pXTVupsCIEAbEzmFY-Zw,0,0,4,Tm29ZAr_9InxXuzL7CD9-A

This place is close to my house and I knew it was open, so we stroll in and there is no one in there. Maybe 1 other table. Ambiance is nice, but I have to comment on our crazy ass, yet mildly entertaining waitress. So we sit down and she comes over decked out in Geisha attire straight out of Japan and I think of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and those pictures flash into my head. I order the Oohlong tea, some sushi rolls, and my miso soup. I am not kidding when she does the ""miso soup dance"". I don't even know how to describe this, imagine a young asian woman with a black version of Anna Wintours hair cut do a chicken dance and sing a strange, vaguely English song, about miso soup. I look at Alex, and i'm like "" Can I please have some of whatever she is on?"". Kind of amazing. My tea was spectacular, I swear I would go back just for the hot tea (I love tea in general). The Miso soup was good, but the sushi was just mediocre at best. I have definitely had better. The Anna Wintour Geisha came back and was on top of us and very sweet, and even did another little dance about my tea. Tea, 2 sushi rolls, and miso soup came out to $17. Which is pretty cheap for Hamada. Then again, when you go to a sushi restaurant you expect to have good sushi, right? So I would go back to try a few of their other menu items but I don't know if i'd do sushi again.  The interior is beautiful, and the waitress gave me an experience to remember.

After fifteen minutes, I got the hint that my business wasn't important to them, and went somewhere else.  There are a lot of terrific Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas.

The perfect low-key atmosphere that is nearly impossible to find in Vegas, good quality sushi, a knowledgable sushi chef, excellent service and good company.

Coming in to dine here is somewhat uncomfortable because the decor is outdated and the place looks like it's falling apart. Definitely not visually impressed by the interior.

Now, as for the food. It's OK. I've only had a chance to get have a taste of the appetizers, the soups and the sushi. All of the above is OK tasting. Nothing special. Nothing extraordinary. Fish/rice portions on the sushi were good; not too much rice and enough fish. Fish wasn't the freshest I've had but it's not bad either. Soups had a good portion of noodles and what not. The alcoholic beverage menu might need some help as I'm not very impressed by their somewhat slim selection of sakes. 

Service is always really good and on point. The front of house staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The only time I experienced a wait and somewhat slow service was during valentines day one year.

Hamada seems to be part of this upscale tradition taking place.  The interior is spacious yet relaxed with low lite mood lighting and a surprisingly well stocked fish tank. The Sushi is very good just about anything you get at Hamada is usually good. I personally would recommend the Beef Negimaki. On a side note it is important to know that Hamada attempts to be as authentic as possible as occasionally the Japanese wait staff seem to have trouble  with English, some may find this to be unprofessional I found it oddly endearing.",S1i_tRtWRzHL1soN-tpM2A,0,0,4,wwcu2dYbZQXdZRY_ApzZ-w

The restaurant was pretty empty, and we were seated immediately.  We sat at the sushi bar and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered 5 different rolls, and the sushi chef was pretty quick.  We had all the rolls out before we had finished the second one.  The rolls were a pretty typical size--not huge, but also not tiny like some other places I have been to.  Everything was great!  My husband is new to sushi so we stuck to the classics: spicy crab, rainbow roll, Alaskan roll.  But we also got a salmon skin roll, which was interesting, and the California Bomb (not included in the happy hour special), which was great.

The service was good, but I have to admit that the place was dead, so there was no reason to have bad service.  I will definitely be going back for more happy hour sushi, so we'll see how it goes.",BgF9Iy2wKPLYAcU-1Kfq_w,1,1,4,G_HVe4wpypNilDqeR3fh4A

A group of 16 of us were seated at back to back grills in the Teppan side of the restaurant.  We placed our drink order (glass of Cabernet) with the Mamasan and then enjoyed the company and conversation for what seemed to be a very long time before we were given our menu.  Not sure if it was slow service or if time stood still while we all chatted.

If you've never been to Hamada, the Teppan side of the restaurant is identical to Benihana.  A chef grills your order in front of the group of people seated at the table and puts on a show with the food.

I decided to order the NY Steak & Chicken combo ($35).  The Better Half ordered the Two Lobster Tail dinner ($65).

The chef comes out and starts with the grilled Shrimp and Veggies.....then does the whole Volcano thing with the Onion.  Very entertaining, but predictable if you've been to Benihana.  I can't wait for someone to come up with a new act.  Then he gets into our entrees....I thought he did a great job cooking the Chicken and NY Steak.....both were cooked just right and had a lot of flavor.  I love dipping the Meats in the Sauces they provide for you.....although I have no clue what those Sauces are...ha!

We continued to eat and drink into the night and they made sure our glasses weren't empty.  A few of us did shots of Japanese Brandy and also had some Dessert, which was a Green Tea Ice Cream.

If my Japanese mother had been with us, she would still be there the next morning chewing the staff out.  

How many times would I need to repeat myself asking for *chopsticks* at a Japanese restaurant?  And water?  And green tea? Should I really beg to pay?  If you didn't want me there, you could have given me the check when I first walked though the door.  

The food was good.  The sushi, teriyaki, and udon were all good.  If only I had the water or tea to wash it down with.  One server, one water/bus-woman who I guess is also the cook.  And this was at 9:00 PM.  

The prices are high.  Not as high as other sushi places.  The menu selection is positive but I can't get over the service and I feel bad leaving the tip I did.  No customer should leave feeling he was forced to give an insulting amount.

Atmosphere: 4/5  You walk in this place and you feel like your in Japan. I liked the decor a lot of fake plants with a Japanese sand box in the middle (it was actually a rock box but I figured food + kids = dust everywhere). The lighting was very dark it helped disguised the fact they barely had anyone there. I was there about 6:30 prime dinner hours and that place was EMPTY.

Sashimi: 3/5 was delicious... fresh big chunks. They better be for the price! For an assorted boat of sashimi was $40 bucks. I basically inhaled it

Nigiri: 3/5 Great portions big fish and good amount of rice. I really liked their rice with the nigiri. It was a bit sweeter than most places.

Shrimp Tempura Boat: I'm not a fried food type of person but my boyfriends little brother loves Shrimp tempura. I can't give you a good opinion on shrimp tempura because I'm already bias on the friend part. 

Teriyaki Chicken Entree: 0/5 I was so surprised how SIMPLE and HORRIBLE this dish was. I literally could've gotten better Teriyaki chicken from PANDA EXPRESS. The presentation was even horrible. A scoop of rice, teriyaki chicken, and edamame 

Seaweed Salad: 0/5 What a rip off, this seaweed salad was mostly cucumber salad. They should call is cucumber salad with a dash of seaweed. What a joke.. 

Service: 5/5 Service was great, your waitresses are really nice and they get into character so well. Dressed in Japanese kimonos 

Price: 0/5 Super expensive $$$$ for 3 1/2 people our bill came close to $300...and I was still hungry after.",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,2,1,2,JN-mOCsVRh8f4uxXN-2ZCA

for $25, you can sit for 2 hours and order as much sushi as you can eat.  or for $30, you can get sushi with tempura, teriyaki, etc. too.  watch out for the ""rules"", like no sharing, must eat all the rice, must finish all food before you can order more food, etc.  the watiers lurk around probably watching for rule breakers, but i was able to sneak off about 6 pieces of sushi to my cousins.

i usually shy away from all-you-can-eat sushi places, especially if it's a half teppan/half sushi place, but i also trust my cousin's japanese wife's taste.  the fish really was pretty fresh here.
