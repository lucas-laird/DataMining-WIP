It has a great handy location outdoor by the pool and was very nice in the morning. The food was very average for a hotel of the Venetians standard - I had a club Sandwich for lunch - which was OK but the fries were cold and soggy. I had a breakfast Burrito was OK but very greasy - the salsas were good - would be a superb hangover breakfast but I wasn't hungover. Service was OK.

I love the setting and I love that I could dump my stuff down on my pool lounger and then wander over to have some breakfast in my swimsuit.  The patio is mostly shaded under lots of big patio umbrellas so it stays pretty cool.

For breakfast, they have some lighter breakfast options, full breakfast entrees, and breakfast cocktails as well as fruity frozen drinks.  On my first visit, I had the French-style omelet which had asparagus, mushrooms, Gruyere cheese and came with fried potatoes, a grilled tomato slice and toast.  It was delicious.  The omelet was just very tasty - everything went well together.  The potatoes were excellent.  They were super crispy, did not seem oily and were seasoned with sea salt.  They were addictive.  Since little things can make me very happy, I was pleased that my whole wheat toast was served with no jelly but with both strawberry and blackberry preserves.  It made my day.  I only had coffee with my breakfast (I saved the cocktails orders for the pool bar) but it was very good and it kept getting refilled.

I liked my breakfast so much on the first visit here that I went back two days later when I was at the pool and got exactly the same thing.  Everyone was nice and the service was fast and efficient.  I will definitely look forward to having a poolside breakfast here again the next time I'm at the Venetian.",tIP5tmJzK2jFKJh6lE-_Ag,0,0,4,dN0hx9fknvfJlug4e2H53Q

Today Riva displayed some of the worst service I've seen a very long time.  Food and drink that took painfully long to be delivered on an afternoon where the restaurant was perhaps 75% full.  25 minutes to refill an iced tea?  Yikes.

Food was 3.75 stars with extra props to some nice grilled shrimp on my fellow diner's salad.  When you are paying 18 bucks for a sandwich or a salad, though, there ought to be something special on the plate.  Sadly, the other sandwiches were good, but not great.

having a late lunch at riva was our plan b. we didn't expect the pool to be quite crowded, but the day was hot and there were no empty lounge chairs. we decided to start our bachelorette party weekend by filling our stomachs first. my plate of popcorn shrimp and calamari was huge in quantity, but not in flavor so much. i had a slice of salmon pizza (smoked salmon with creme fraiche on very thin crust), and thought that was outstanding. 

we were starving so devouring somewhat of mediocre food wasn't a daunting task at all. needless to say, tasty sangria and bloody mary helped us to overlook the spotty service as well. 

mr. puck can do better, especially if he is to compete with all the celebrity chefs in sin city. maybe all his effort goes in to cut. if you don't expect too much from a poolside restaurant, riva is not a bad choice to refuel your energy. besides, their food is not meant to be thoroughly enjoyed. who wants to look fat in her swimsuits?!",23_DfS0ojdNS-MFGF_SjsQ,3,4,3,zrdsi273Jny5q0_-MLIfRw

On the way out, however, had to get one of their yard-length frozen drinks.  The cocktail waitresses by the pool don't sell these; you gotta get them from Riva or from the bar in the Ventian Retail shops area.  Got the Lava Flow, I think for 18 buck, with refills being cheaper. Super sweet, for sure, but hey, doctor it up with a bit (or a flask) of your own rum, and poolside just got better =)

3350363,2013-07-13,0,e-P17ZVKGvnBT58pqtxQeA,"I try to make it a point to eat at as many different restaurants as I can when I am in Vegas.  This time, I found my way to Riva by Wolfgang Puck by the Venetian pools.

THE MOOD:
The restaurant is located in the middle of the hub bub of the Venetian pools.  Riva is prime location because it is a bit elevated from the pool deck so you get to soak up sun and people watch at the same time.  The Vegas sun can be awfully hot, but not to worry, there is mist that is gently sprinkled as you eat and umbrellas.

THE FOOD:
I ordered the Margherita Pizza, but they ended up giving me a plain cheese pizza.  I don't usually send food back, so I just went ahead and ate the pizza anyways...Meh.  I also ordered a Bellini.  Andrew D. got an omelet with potatoes.   The food overall was average tasting.  Pizza was a bit on the oily side and crust was really hard.  Andrew D's omelet was not extremely tasty either.

THE 'TUDE:
The hostess in the front is great at what she does.  We were walking by the restaurant and she was great at convincing us to have a seat in the shade from the sun.  As for the waitress we got, she was super slow in coming around and I don't believe she ever checked in on us.  Not only that, but we had to wave her down for our check.

OVERALL:

Unfortunately at that point toast was Ice Cold and was not replaced... Strike 3

SERVICE:
slow and staff is very unattentive , but the person who refills our drink is the only person who is attentive.  it wasn't busy but it looks like they are very unorganized . after the first person took our orders , although i believe he wasn't the waiter but he is probably trying to help his co worker taking orders, i assumed because the second and the third guy whos taking our orders have the same uniform except the first guy who is in dark blue polo shirt .

Second guy came to our table and asking for our order and after we gave again our order, the third guys asking if we are ready to order . it was like circus 3 people taking your order without other knowing . the first person told them he already took the order after we got totally confused who is the person in charge.

After we finished eating it took them so long to process our bills

FOOD:
I did order the American Breakfast : just what you normally get in american breakfast . I asked for scramble egg, bacon instead of sausage, with half cut of strawberry , too stingy for a fruits and 1 very thin sliced of orange for simple decoration. with one piece of white bread  cut in half served with 2 jam and butter.  portion are pretty small but price is standard.

Despite being one of about 5 occupied tables, our server was scarce and barely gave us the time of day. I had to refill my water with my own water bottle. Never was able to flag him down for condiments like ketchup. Had to ask a different server to find him so we could get our bill and then THAT SERVER FORGOT. Eventually we had to get up and grab our own server who didn't even realize our food had come (despite the fact that we've been here about an hour). He got the check but again was gone so fast we didn't even have a chance to ask him if we could charge our breakfast to our room.

Also, just FYI, the receipts have no way to bill to your room, so you will have to track down your server and have them write it out--but NOTE if you have not made a separate call to the front desk to authorize charges to your room, they will tell you that you (not them, despite being part of the hotel) have to find some way to call them.
