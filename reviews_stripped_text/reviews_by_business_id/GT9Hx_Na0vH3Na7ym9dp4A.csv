The people here are so funny and great, I love just coming after work and  relaxing with a cold bud, and sometimes when the game is on. Well that's even better!",G2vljP_LAtF2s8jq9cxESA,0,0,5,ab8w7Dju9FGNYZ3X4XUlAQ

I'm sitting here...played a hundy, bartender walked past me a few times (no eye contact, even though I swear I asked for service...maybe my voice doesn't work right today?) and there's only like 6 people here...I had to yell to get attention and I'm gaming like a hungry person...I never had to ask, I'd have to cut them off...they'd come and take my drinks and bring back a fresh drink without hesitation. Ally...apparently, has an at home issue that she needs people in the bar to recognize. I don't go out to bars to hear the problems of a bartender...I go to game, drink and forget about my shit for a while...can't do that here anymore. For this...I'm out! Sorry guys. I will still come here, just not when this mopey personality is here...",x2c5o85kZPEKV1MSmUeWSw,0,0,1,jWCZoncf9cZlXZFN9wWcWw

Personally I loved this aspect of it. It is a San Diego or Los Angeles Charger bar. Staff was friendly and talked shit, made me feel at home. The wings were freaken amazinggggggg. I didn't want to leave but I am not a charger fan and they were going to play next. All the Tv's go to the Chargers. Fantasy Football is my choice of football so I went back to the strip! Next time im in town I will go back and demolish those pigs wings. My Fiancee and I murdered 4 pounds of wings. Left an impression there!",ADOO452wPBt0IgWRCu5jkA,0,0,4,jQKoVREIaZYBPC0mr3K-cQ

They have a nice large bar with gaming(smoking), a section for people to watch the game (non smoking), a large pool area with six pool tables.  Bar is very CLEAN and bartenders are amazing!  I may be biased but DONALD is the best!  Worth coming in and checking this bar out.  Stop by grave shift from midnight to eight am!  Bar is 24/7   #gravelife",7FGaox4G5LG361eZkx4o_Q,0,0,5,PPgjtTdl_HOqzrqs7fLI5Q
2755088,2018-02-10,0,GT9Hx_Na0vH3Na7ym9dp4A,The food was horrible!!! The food in the pictures definitely changed Chicken fingers?... no a chicken breast breaded in cornflakes and cut into odd little strips after cooking with no flavor and soggy coating.  Sloppy joe tots....in theory a good idea but executed with way too much sloppy sauce (salty) and not enough meat to be called sloppy joe.  The chicken fingers in the photos are definitely different than what u get.  Never again.,4xXnT-tA-eOo3Y-uDaLEOA,0,0,1,PVsLSI4DZg7VhlDq3zLeZw

Way, way off the strip but theest places usually are.  They welcome all kinds here, yes Faider..oops i mean Raiders fans i'm talking about you. If you looking to watch a SAN DIEGO game, have some fun w/ friends, throw back a couple of beers and crack jokes all on good fun then this is the place for you (San Diego Chargers Fan)

I plan on spending my sundays there with my dallas friends. The GM and bartender alyson is awesome ,i followed her from her previous bar. So when i come in she knows what i drink and i normally dont have to ask. She fun,bubbly and creates a good atmosphere.  The gaming promotions are 2nd to none ,easy sign up process. Also ive met crystal another bartender and had a blast with her on st patricks day, my friends and i enjoyed the night. While they were very busy alyson and crystal never let us go dry on drinks. And the wing king inside omg the pig wings are amazing",erOYLc3hZfQJ8fldMKfHKQ,1,0,5,XQUrDzzsCKKqtXCm96KcJw
