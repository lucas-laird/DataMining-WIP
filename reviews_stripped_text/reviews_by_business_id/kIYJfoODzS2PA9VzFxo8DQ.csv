I did not realize they were in the neighborhood, until they had the new sign up.  It was busy during the weekend, but they were able to get my food out hot and ready.  If you are looking for traditional Filipino food then this is the place to eat, there is nothing hipster about this place.  It reminds me of how my mom and aunts used to make it, but better (Sorry mom and auntie!). I had their Goto and it was delicious, along with their halo halo which I believe is the best compared to other places.  I just wished they were open late at night after going out to just have their goto soup.  They do party trays and can host your huge Filipino party at their place for a good deal (No mess, no fuss).  I am looking forward to trying out the rest of their food and gaining an extra 10 pounds. I would recommend this place for traditional food...if you are looking for some new idea or fusion, this is not it. Just good food!",EUo_Z-KeI2dyD_oUZqbxqg,0,1,5,H4Zxm6jRgwyy_9iYl7S5dA

It's small but it feels very homey and welcoming. It's new and they don't have a big sign or anything noticeable for their business. They had a small paper sign (which was sad, in that it's very easy to miss and see it)
 
All of the employees are extremely friendly and good people. They always talk to you with a smile on their face and they spoke to me as one of their own kids/ family members. They're very genuine people.

I got the lumpia Shanghai, which came with I believe 6 pieces and Kare-Kare. Their Kare-Kare was flavorful and wasn't bland, which was good. Their lumpia was good as well. 
And for dessert I got halo-halo and Ginataang Bilo Bilo. Their Ginataang was fresh but more on the thick side. It was still good!

Goto Queen is different from other Filipino restaurant kitchens in that the food has a fresh, authentic taste. Other places you can tell the food has been sitting for a while. This was fresh tasting. 

Also, the pancit had two different noodles which I really enjoyed. It was hard to discern that there was any meat in it but it was still worth trying. 

Sisig was my favorite. The balance of pork,onions and vinegar made a very yummy dish. I would order that dish again. There was a good portion of pork meat, fat and a few pieces of crispy skin. 

The atmosphere is very enjoyable. Our server took the time to explain the dishes to me. I have never experienced that in other places. The employees were friendly and helpful.",kn4lbh5vEsqeo5SbHWS_HA,0,1,4,Hi4P1t_-EHprZLtP__F9Xw

3596133,2017-05-11,0,kIYJfoODzS2PA9VzFxo8DQ,"Coworker and I decided to try a Filipino spot near our office (they are extremely hard to come by) so we were excited to find Goto Queen was nearby. There are a couple of downfalls and this is coming from the one that got stuck in the office while my coworker went to pick up the food. First, there is no online menu which was really hard to know what exactly I was going to get. Some of the photos on here were helpful but everything I wrote down was apparently not available at the time. I wanted the 2-item lunch combo with beef caldereta and lunchon. None of these were available and ended up with Pork Adobo & Menudo (coworkers recommendations). They were both ok. It comes to taste - it wasn't awful but I definitely prefer the spice to the adobo I typically have. Goto Queen was a bit more sweet tasting - which totally threw me off. Second, the portions. Considering I spent about $10.00 on this meal - the portions aren't that big. I just got a huge portion of rice and very little meat to come along with it. Taking the meal to go might not be the best because everything is very juicy and usually in some broth of sorts and it gets messy! Perhaps this place is best when you dine-in as opposed to take out since the photos I see on here usually show good portions and at least you get to pick your own when you are there.

I think I will give this place another try since the food wasn't terrible - just not what I am used to. Maybe next time I will get the lumpia and hopefully they will have the beef caldereta available.",fHYF5oxuVCnb_bj2Y93zvA,1,0,2,eTHskLmfRaQfTw4Iawd5_g

Service: 5/5, like I said they're fairly new so they may still be working out some kinks here and there.

Their name is not on the plaza sign along with other businesses in this plaza, which may cause difficulties when trying to find it; however they have a huge sign above the restaurant. 

They temporarily only have a small menu that reads: 1 item combo ($4.99), 2 item combo ($5.99), 3 item combo ($6.99).

On my visit, I tried:
Fried chicken: Extra crunchy & seasoned just right, just how I prefer it.

Kare kare: My brother's go-to. They put everything kare kare usually comes with + tripe, which he loves. Sauce on point. A must try.

Lumpia Shanghai: How can you not love egg rolls? Tiny pieces of high cholesterol. Mmmmm.

Bangus: My favorite item to order when I go to Filipino places. Crisp to a T. 

The cassava cake was probably the best thing I've had here, along with the bangus. All the desserts, especially the leche flan, are A1!!!!! Definitely need to pick some of the desserts up when you're here.

Our go-to Filipino place isn't open for lunch anymore and the glowing 5-star they have - that's how we ended up here. Interestingly enough, those perfect reviews were written by people with 0-5 reviews or no profile picture. Ay naku, it was probably the titos and titas that wrote the reviews!

The windows were plastered with pictures of their menu items. It's a carinderia/ turo-turo place where you point (using your finger or your pouty lips) at the item you want. My parents told us never to go to places like this when I was growing up but I didn't know what to expect and we were already here.

You grab a tray. Pick what you want to eat. I got garlic rice, lechon and lumpia. 3/4 of my plate was garlic rice and they put my lechon and lumpia in separate containers for some unknown reason. I think they change up some of their menu items daily. I was hoping to try their pancit palabok because I haven't found a place in this town that makes a good palabok. But they didn't have it the day I went.

Garlic Rice:
It wasn't garlicky enough and it needed a bit nuts re salt (this is coming from somebody who is salt-sensitive). The rice is old, dry and hard. 1/5

Lechon:
Wow! They actually have chopped up lechon. But they gave me the fattiest bits and not enough meat. The skin is fantastic though. Crispy crunchy goodness! 4/5

Lumpia:
Pork lumpia. I love lumpia but not this version. The carrot flavor was overwhelming. The meat and veggie flavors are supposed to balance each other and that didn't happen here. 1/5

I've been craving for some hot soup on this cold day and thought there's nothing better than a bowl of Goto, just like what I used to do when I was growing up in the Philippines. They're goto really tasted good. It's authentic Filipino cooking. Although they have food on display, cafeteria style, they prepared my goto after I ordered it. I saw that they have arrozcaldo too and bought some too because some people in my household doesn't eat beef. They're serving portion is good. I also bought 2 orders of their 2 items combo. I wanted to try most of their food that's why I did that. I ordered their fried chicken, pork sinigang, sinigang na salmon head and sautéed  mongo. I ordered them all to go, and was quite surprised by the big portion of rice when I got home. One order of the 2 item combo rice is already good for 2-3 people unlike other Filipino restaurants that just gives a cup of rice.

Anyway, here's my review for the food. The Goto is really good. It has tripe and bits of beef in it. Maybe they can add a little bit more of rice in it, but aside from that, it's really tasty. The arrozcaldo had a lot of chicken meat and 2 hardboiled eggs. It's also good, but is not a big fan of ginger, and it has a lot! As in every spoonful of arrozcaldo has strips of ginger in it, and it's not enjoyable to bite into a piece every time you put the food into your mouth. They could also add a little bit more of rice in it. I understand that sweet rice eventually melts into the soup, but perhaps combine it with some regular white rice, so that there will be some visible rice in it, when served. Just a suggestion.

The fried chicken is essentially marinated and is as good as my mom's home-cooked fried chicken. I didn't get the chance to taste the sinigang na salmon head because my hubby devoured it in an instant. He said it's good too. Their pork sinigang is also good and is just the way I like it. Not too much meat in it though because they used the bony parts of the pork, which I think what added flavor to the soup. And lastly, the sauteed mongo is also tasty. It had no meat in it, but they used shrimp instead.

The food is good and authentic. The customer service is also good because they are instantly there, ready to serve you. The place is clean. Overall, I can affirm that I will come back here to have my goto cravings satiated. I would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for those minor details that I mentioned above.",MHiKdBFx4McRQONnuMbByw,0,0,4,8Cd_1STWAFPZxcUJhfXbXQ
