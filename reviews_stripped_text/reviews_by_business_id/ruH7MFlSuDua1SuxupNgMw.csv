2090638,2017-08-19,0,ruH7MFlSuDua1SuxupNgMw,Don't let me name fool you. When I think of a deli I think of lunch meats and sandwiches. This place is far from that... they have hot food cooked to order. Anything from hotdogs to chicken wings. I had the wings and chicken strips and they were good. Nice flavor and season.,07UWbgojyCyyQMIRgplw3Q,1,0,4,B1MFv_kjSG0lRCyKB1QQIw
2200212,2018-04-30,1,ruH7MFlSuDua1SuxupNgMw,"The deli is located just off the sports book.

Food and drink are reasonably priced but the staff get slammed often so it takes a bit longer to get the food.

With the buffet closed, this place has gained in popularity since the cafe is now the only dining option aside from the steakhouse. 

Their sandwiches and fries are made to order. 

Drinks are refillable which is a plus.

Their staff work diligently to get things out so they deserve.

I like their pastrami and potato salad.

Don't eat here often but when I get a comp it's tempting to visit when the cafe has a line out the door.

I'll be back for sure especially during summer.",Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,3,1,4,Op0QSr8pfMfMbJg4rH8WBg
2765884,2017-10-19,0,ruH7MFlSuDua1SuxupNgMw,"Sometime in the last few months, they've replaced their foods with nasty, inferior, low quality garbage.  Used to have very good, ""real"" hamburgers. Used to have good chicken fingers. Used to have a good 1/4 lb. hot dog.  The burgers are now pre-made nasty patties... maybe soyburgers or something else. They definitely aren't made from fresh beef like they used to be.  The ""1/4 lb"" hot dog is now about 2/3 of its previous size, it definitely is not 1/4 lb anymore.  It doesn't even fill up a regular hot dog bun anymore; it used to be oversized for the bun.  Also, the hot dog doesn't taste like a hot dog anymore. They are now disgusting and have made me sick the last two times I was there.  Their chicken fingers (or tenders) have never been that good, but now they are much worse.  They have tons of breading on them and the crumbs go all over the place just by touching them - it is as if they have several layers of breading.  And something is very bad with this chicken, can't even eat half of the nasty order.

Also, they've reduced the amount of fries that you get with a meal.  You now get only about 1/3 of the order that you used to get.   Last time (and VERY LAST) I was there, I had 8 fries on my plate, not even full fries either... just chunks and scraps.  

This place has slid way downhill.  I can walk here in less than 10 minutes from home and I used to eat here way too often...    but now the food is garbage.  You now would get much better food at the McDonald's inside walmart at Boulder Hwy & Nellis.",-vTIOBkGfZ6JdP0RROs6Fw,0,0,1,Dj_BJ6Q5pFv8_il_87eQNg
3867333,2018-05-27,0,ruH7MFlSuDua1SuxupNgMw,First off there very rude and act like they don't want to take your order.  Also none of them speak English and don't care if they talk behind your back.   Also the place is filthy and gross.  No one cleaned the tables or chairs in the whole 44 min I was there.   The place was very unsatisfactory and unsanitary and also the back by the cook looks very disgusting and dirty.  Good luck getting served.,3xBw5qsDxPY1BBHnaKoksA,0,0,1,sURHUi3vWf_QBloVAwaDZw

4721002,2017-06-10,0,ruH7MFlSuDua1SuxupNgMw,"As far as I know, the Deli at Eastside Cannery has been there since the Casino first opened over 10 years ago. I'm not sure how I'm the first person to review it, but I'll tell you this place has some decent deli food.

This is the Eastside Cannery's only fast food option. It's right next to the Sportsbook, which also has an entrance right next to it so you can walk in and grab something to go if you want. It's what you would expect from a Casino deli. Their menu is sandwiches, burgers, chicken wings (and fingers), soups and salads. Nothing here is unusual, it's all typical American food, but its done well.

They have good chicken wings, a very good tuna melt, good burgers, a great fruit plate, and a very large chopped salad. Almost all their meals (with the exceptions of the salads) come with a side, and their fries are pretty good to.

If you gamble in the Casino, even a little bit, you will probably get a two for one (or better) coupon to use every month. Their prices are already reasonable, with most items at $7 or $8 dollars.

Honestly the food here is probably average, its good but nothing special. The reason I am giving this place an extra star is the constant comps and discounts they hand out and the great service. The last time we were here Christina was very friendly. She had great suggestions and was one of those service with a smile people that seem genuinely cheerful.

If you feel like a sandwich or giant salad at a reasonable price, you might want to stop by here.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,2,1,4,50nYr4TbyCkgsfdePSX1kQ
