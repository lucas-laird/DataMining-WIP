We waited about 20 to 30 minutes to be seated which was fine as they were busy at the time. After we sat down though our waitress was nice she was really slow at attending to our table. Once our food finally came to our table it looked as though it had been sitting for awhile. You know when you put fresh beans on the plate they have a moistness to them.. These looked like dried old beans along with this on my fiance's plate he also received a taco where literally the shell wasn't cooked, it's as though they took it out of the package onto the plate no heating at all, the waitress didn't believe him so he had her physically touch the shell which was raw and she agreed and seemed taken back by it. The main course of his dish was cold on the inside which brought him to believe it was frozen then just reheated. As for my plate im vegetarian and found something suitable enough for me the volcanes, I asked the waitress to leave the cheese off to the side as I'm more vegan than vegetarian. After waiting for about an hour to get our food a different waitress finally brought our plates and there on my meal the cheese was on top. Since we'd been waiting so long I was like screw it I'll just eat it. Though I found out the guacamole and the pico have jalapenos in it which im allergic to unfortunately so I sent the plate back and since they aren't really a vegan friendly restaurant I settled for the Spanish rice which tasted like it came from a box. For all the hype this restaurant puts out it was extremely over priced for what you get and the service is horrible. I wouldnt recommend this place. The only reason I gave two stars was because the ambiance of the physical restaurant itself was nice.",xJU_8kB-QVdK-_BOotvi9Q,0,0,2,wkpqXCNE3heeD-uexZ1NaA

So tonight I read some Yelp! reviews which sounded promising. The listing said they were open until 10pm.

We arrived at the restaurant at 9:30pm only to find the ""closed"" sign up and the staff sweeping the floors. I spoke to a lady and reminded her that they had just told me 10pm and she shrugged. So we took our business to nearby Lindo Michoacan who stay open until the hours posted on their sign. We won't be back. What a shame...",cdFB_a_ZXF7qGVKP2mYikA,0,0,1,FXt7F4e-ncrq5pYstUVwxw

The first time I came here I wasn't sure if I'd like the food and plus it was a Friday night, at least the wait wasn't too long (about 20 min) and hey it was happy hour. 

When we sat down, the server approached us and introduced herself and took our drink orders. I wasn't too sure what to try because they all seemed delicious. I ended up ordering the Ribeye Tacos...YUM! My cousin ordered the tamales and I had a little sample...totally worth trying.

The second time I came here I tried the Quesa Tacos because the server said it was one of the best items on the menu and I wouldn't be let down. He was right!! I ordered the Quesa Tacos with carne asada with a side of queso rice; I totally recommend trying it and trust me you can probably share because the tacos are pretty filling and the rice is amazing. 

The third time I came here I tried the shrimp tacos (grilled), yeah I don't recommend it at all just because it was salty and just not that great. However, my cousin ordered the Empanadas and had a little bite of it and it was really good. 

BTW if you check if you get a free fried ice cream, so make sure you check in and show your server because dessert is a perfect way to end your meal.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,0,4,avx1RLsFHu8Z5M4HVWBRzg

5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

This is our new fave Mexican place in LV. We still heart Casa Don Juan, but it's way on the other side of town.

The decor is nice, but maybe just a tad dark on the bar side. They brought out chips, salsa and bean dip, all of which were delicious. Best chips and salsa BY FAR that we have had in LV. The food was really really good. My wife had crispy tacos -- she loved the carne asada but didnt care for the chicken. The 13 year old had the ground beef taco and liked it. I had the Quesa Shrimp Tacos, the house specialty, and they were very good (the corn tortillas were ok, not great). The shrimp was SCRUMPTIOUS! Overall, the food was very good. Warning: the portion sizes are HUGE.

I can see what other people are saying about the service. Our server was somewhat indifferent. It took quite a while to get our food. But it didnt ruin our meal, and I wouldnt let it stop you from trying the place.

It was a bit pricey -- $50 for 2 sodas, a 2 taco plate, a 1 taco plate, and the special tacos.",4PAbEV_aep8BYVZPzVGrnw,1,0,4,bjhD8FUGXw5dQc5dl-P74Q

To add insult to injury, it is WAY over priced.... two street tacos were $13... three burnt, small taquitos also $13... save your time, your money, and your stomach and go elsewhere.

My husband, who has a cast iron stomach got sick and could wait to get home to run to the bathroom. Next day - he is still sick.

The environment inside is very nice. Decor matches the obvious theme, the lighting is at a slight dim and the bar has a sort of cantina look to it. Every time I've been the staff has always been pleasant and personable, always willing to strike up conversation besides the typical ""What can I get for you?"" routine.

The first thing they bring out are tortilla chips made in house, along with bean dip, verde salsa and a black salsa. The chips and dips are so good that you can get full from eating so many, they are that delicious. They have a crisp airy taste and taste like they just finished making them. When I say the chips are baked in-house, you can genuinely taste that they are. Amazing way to start a meal.

My first visit there I ordered the Milanesa and man was I blown away. Everything seemed to be cooked perfectly. The portions are huge so unless you come with an appetite plan on leftovers. My second visit I ordered the quesa shrimp tacos and just when I thought their food couldn't get better these tacos proved me wrong. The only way I can describe their food is to let your taste buds do all the talking for me. I decided to try out their dessert and their tres leches is delicious. I was given complimentary coffee with it which was an amazing gesture in my book. Be sure to check in as sometimes you'll get a free treat to top your meal!

We tried this place for the first time Friday night.  I am always happy when a restaurant opens up here in Centennial.  Now let's just hope it can STAY open!

There were good things about Leticia's and a few not-so-good things. 

THE GOOD
Our chips and salsa and waters were brought to our table right away... like within 3 minutes of sitting down.  I like that.  The chips weren't anything special by any means, but both types of salsa were very flavorful.  I especially liked the chipotle based one.

The menu had a lot of variety, lots of things I would have liked to try.  It was hard to decide what I'd try first.

The prices were very reasonable for big portions.

My shrimp tacos were excellent.  (The rice that came with them was a different story, but more on that below.)

I'm embarrassed to admit that we ate through a whole basket of chips and a whole cup of that chipotle salsa.... but happy to say that we didn't even have to ask.... they just brought us more as soon as we were done.

The service staff seems to work very well together.  They seemed on top of things everywhere we looked, and were definitely good to us.

THE BAD
My husband's seafood enchiladas were definitely ""meh.""  Very bland tasting, with more of a pasta-type sauce on top.  But even more bland was the rice that came with my shrimp tacos.  UGH that was some nasty, dry, tasteless stuff!

Our desserts were very fairly priced, but just kinda ""meh"" too.  He got the fried ice cream, which had a kind of stale-tasting shell around the ice cream.  I had the sopapillas, which were ok.  I mean it's just fried dough with some cinammon and sugar.... there's not a whole lot you can do with that ... but I have had better.

If I were going with my kids, this would be up in the ""good"" section, but because we were out on ""date night,"" I'll put this here.  This place is VERY much a family restaurant.  Like I said, that can be a GOOD thing if you have kids... and I would definitely think of taking my daughter here ... but if you're going for a date night type atmosphere, I wouldn't choose this place.  There were LOTS of kids... pretty noisy.  

And I'm apparently in the minority here since it seems that every restaurant is doing this now.... but I don't understand why there has to be TVs playing sports on every wall.  At a sports bar/pub?  Yes.  At a Mexican Cocina?  I don't get it.  

All-in-all we liked our experience there pretty much.  I won't be rushing back, but I wouldn't mind going again to try some other stuff.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,0,0,3,Bw0EYeuJV0J_daQ73j1hIg

From the outside my Man was like are you serious this place is gonna have canned beans (bcz looks like a americanized unauthentic place w/ 99% non-authentic people going in & out)I'm like the reviews say the owner cooks & it's really a family run spot. 
Going inside its decorated how my dream kitchen is (style wise).
We were seated in ""Lucian's "" section. He seems bothered by all of the customers demands & months of unfamiliarity with ""mexican"" food.
I ask what he recommends he points out three of the highest priced plates. I choose the ""Quesa Tacos"" - I get something saucy w meat inside two cold unfresh corn tortillas - the beans were Eh (maybe canned!)The rice was white rice w green chiles & hot sour cream or something creamy (I dunno)
Kids meal had cold limp fries that maybe were fresh cut in house at one point- not tonight- the chicken fingers appeared hand made.
My man had a wet burrito it was a good size for 13.00
Chips weren't warm like another review said they would be-they had a cold styrofoam texture & salsa being chipotle not my thing but tasted cool.
was 55.00 for 2+kid
Tacos & burrito... Burnt out server

We always loved this restaurant (despite the usually slow service) but May 1st 2013 will have been our last time ever eating here. 

I am a couple months pregnant, my 6 year old son and my husband were given our entrees and as I leaned over for my second bite of fajitas I see a roach hanging out on  the table between my dinner plate and my fajita platter! 

My husband scooped it up with a napkin. We all just sort of froze out of disbelief! When the waiter stopped by a few moments later, my son announced there had been a roach on our table. My husband discreetly handed him (Mario) the napkin. He didnt seem too frazzled by this. 

Mario informed us that the owner have been spending a lot of money trying to fix their bug problem! Umm??? Hello??? They know they have a serious problem and they are still serving costumers??? 

I left the table and went to the car. When my husband showed up I asked him what they did or said about this. He said they gave us 3 dollars off our meal! Wow, thanks!

Every time I drive by I see hoards of people waiting outside so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. My friend and I got there at about 5pm on Friday. It wasn't too busy yet although there was a bit of a wait and the small lobby area was full. After waiting about 15 minutes we were seated in the dining area. It's super crowded- tables are very close to each other in an almost claustrophobic way. We were served chips and salsa first. I notice other reviewers raving about the chips, and I almost wonder if we were served something different than everyone else? The chips we got tasted like any tortilla chips you could buy at the grocery store and were not warm as some stated. The salsa didn't stand out as anything different than what you'd get from Chipotle or Zabas. I ordered the ""build your own burrito"" and my friend ordered the shrimp tacos. My burrito was made as ordered with red sauce ""enchilada style"" and carne asada inside. I agree with other reviews that the food was quite salty and to me the carne asada was really fatty. The serving sizes were large which was good considering that I found the prices to be a little on the high side for the type of restaurant this is. My friend said that her shrimp tacos were tasty but nothing to write home about. Frankly, I actually prefer Zaba's burrito over the one I had at Leticia's for less than half the price.

Me and 2 others walked in. The girl at the front of house was unattentive, all over the place, and annoying. We asked for a table, after 10 minutes of her walking around in a circle she brought us to a booth. ""Oh you wanted a table?"" Not a good start.

Two of us ordered the fried whole tilapia, one ordered the special, a Mexican stew. After an hour of waiting, the waitress came and told us that there was only 1 whole tilapia in the kitchen. Couldn't she have told us that before? I ordered the cod special, instead, since there apparently wasn't enough tilapia.

After 2 total hours of waiting, the food comes out. The stew has burnt beef (black!), the whole fried fish is salty and old, and my other cod special that I ordered was so greasy I couldn't eat it. Our entrees also had this fried potato thing (unpeeled raw potato inside) and ""rice casserole"", (undercooked white rice mixed with cream cheese and spinach), both were appalling.

 After a half-hour of ""negotiating"" with the manager, he took most of our bill off, and offered us free flan desert. OK flan, nothing special.

She left to check on them and after a few minutes she came back and told us that she had forgotten to put our order in and that they would take a while more to come out. Our coffee finally came out by the time we were almost done eating the menudo tasted old by the way. We sat at our booth finished our coffee and the waitress never came back. Finally after a long wait I flagged her down and asked for our check. That took a long time to get when she finally brought it to me I handed her my credit card without looking at the check. This woman walked all over the place with my check and card and I had to wait a very long time just to pay. I finally got up and walked over to her and told her I needed to leave and that she needed to run my card and give me by receipt and card back. I have been here before and I have never seen a waitress that is this disorganized she is too busy yapping and sticking her nose in other customers conversations. She did not charge us for our coffee but I would have rather she put in the order when she said she would that way we could have had our drinks with our meals. The restaurant was not busy when we got there and our order was easy. I just don't know why this waitress can focus.,Uo9DHY1Py6PoNq8z21L_6Q,0,0,1,1ixdDUYanrCd_yYJ1ta6Gg

I was a little worried about how crowded it might be for a Saturday night, but we were able to sit down at the bar without a problem and our wait time for a table was reasonable. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, and it never hurts to have the bartender card you when you're nearly 20 years beyond the drinking age. 

The complimentary chips, salsas and bean dip were delicious. The food was good, though the only complaint I can come up with was not being able to find much of the guacamole in the enchilada I ordered. The shredded chicken was extremely tender if not a bit bland, but the lettuce and salsa on the plate were fresh and helped to pick things up a bit. The rice and beans (usually my favorite part of a Mexican dish), did not disappoint. 

Unfortunately the portion size was so large that we didn't have room for the fried ice cream we had planned on getting, but that just means we need to go back again soon.",n4Lwy3-YnEfNRoOtcMRVKg,0,0,5,Bbshsf3Yr9Ma1zTQUeknsQ

I come back for the ambiance and to keep trying to find that one dish that makes me crave coming back.  Saturday we brought some out of town friends here for dinner.  Looking for somewhere they haven't been before we thought this was the place that wouldn't disappoint.  

We were greeted by the hostess as soon as we walked in.  There were people waiting but we were seated right away.  The waiter came to take our drink order.  He was very friendly and offered up some recommendations.  He brought out the complimentary chips and salsa.  There was two types salsa - one smokey (not good) and the other was a tomato based salsa and was very tasty.  It also came with a warm bean dip which because a favorite of the table.  The chips were an ""eh"".  Nothing special and not even sure if they were freshly made but with the salsa/bean dip you didn't really notice.  We did order some of the freshly made guacamole.  It was pretty bland and was in need of salt, but I would rather put my own salt on guacamole anyway.

The BF and I both ordered the street tacos.  The waiter said they were what he usually ordered and so we thought we were good to go.  I ordered ground beef, chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas.  They were so good and I think I found my craving for this place.  It really was so much food though.  I only ate two and picked at the 3rd one.  It came with rice and beans and I only had a couple bites of rice.  I do love the rice here...its a no nonsense rice-tomato sauce and diced onion is my guess.  The BF and I also split a Mexican style corn on the cob (they cut it in half) that came topped with a white creamy cheese sauce and seasonings on top.  The corn itself had little cornels so it was just blah to me.  I might have to try this corn again because I'm not quite sure how I felt about it.  It was much different than I've had before.

The middle of our meal the owner stopped by our table to make sure everything was going good. I think he has done that every time we have been here.  I always appreciate an owner or even the manager that can take time to acknowledge their customers.  A simple effort but not many do it.

As our dinner started to wind down the karaoke crew started funneling in.  I had forgotten that they do karaoke on the weekends.  So we extended our drinks and our stay to watch some people strut their stuff.  I believe the starting time was 9pm.  Pretty smart to bring in a new crowd just as the dinner crowd is thinning out.  I hope it brings in some added business for them.  Really fun to kick back, catch up with friends with some good live music in the back ground.  

Overall, the service is very personable and caring, the food is a delight, the ambiance is cozy and after 9pm on the weekends live karaoke lovin.  Score!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,9,5,4,koKFnEUIbZ5S3kLiQaIioQ

Husband eats his cause the three employees who came over had no idea what he was asking for. And I can't stand guacamole so I had to have mine redone. Well 27 minutes later they come out (way after hubby was done) I stopped one waiter at about 20 minutes and said just forget them I don't want them and they came anyway so I ate 2 of them and they're cold.. ask for the check. I really couldn't fathom they charged for mine. Honestly I wouldn't have asked for any discount cause we just don't do that but the fact they didn't offer or anything just put it like it didn't matter. I think we'll have to pass on our go to Mexican restaurant for quite a while. Seen a lot of new faces and maybe they changed management or something.

I came here with my girlfriend and two kids for lunch on a Saturday.  As we walked in, we noticed two other parties in the dining room; the place was not busy.  

We sat down, ordered our food, and waited.....waited....waited....  The entire time the manager (I think) was gabbing with the waitstaff about nothing important, right next to our table.  We were pretty much ignored throughout the meal.  The waitress brought out two scalding hot cups of soup, literally seconds before our entrees arrived.  On top of that, she placed the soups directly in front of our 4 and 5 year old eaters.  Common sense isn't always so common.  

I mentioned the poor service to the manager, who just said, ""Sorry,"" and carried on chatting with his waitresses.  

The food was bland at best.  I know I""m only giving a little attention to the food here, but probably just as much attention as the cooks gave it in the first place.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,5,1,2,tzdk7NdMUTId3DlcivTJnQ

Called in for some soup and salsa and chips I think. Anyway... my someone goes to pick up the soup and left with some degree of burns down her side and stomach. When the people packaged it on on top of the other... the soups were so hot that it melted through there insufficient styrofoam and plastic lid containers... spilling all over my someone. My partner turns around and walks back into receive help and needs to have the order filled as it's now all over her and the side walk. Here is where it gets worse. Not only did the staff not seem to care she was burned.. but they never even said ""sorry this happened to you"". We don't have expectations but I guess you would just think human to human you might show some sort of compassion... so the customer service in this moment was terrible and disappointing.. honestly very below standards. So let's flash forward to the present. Being as vegan as possible here we try to order a vinaigrette salad with no cheese as well as potato taquito with no cheese and no crema anywhere etc. they also bring over two salsas and some refried beans. A second server comes over for some reason and we ask to swap the refried beans for the black. Mind you this is a complimentary spread with the bar service we also ordered. We get DENIED this request and told there would be a charge. Then dude disappeared. Our original server returned later.. our food runner comes out and guess what is all over the food and salad... cheese. Oh and instead of the rice and black beans that came with the entree, it was black beans and refried beans?!? The server was very polite and very efficient, apologized and returned quickly with re plated food. Technically the rolled tacos were cross contaminated at they did end up in the refried beans from the first plate.. but we caught it so not too big a deal. When you check in you get a free margarita.. flagged down that guy from earlier who blew off our dietary request for black beans with the comp spread.. also blew off my second drink request. We went to the bartender and her ran it out directly. There was also a nice gal who refilled our chips and salsa. So aside from the inept, rude guy who seemed to visit our table for no reason other than too blow us off... our needs were mostly met and salsa and chips were good. The potato option is nice for vegans and veggie eaters. But I don't think we will be back all the same. It's the bad apple and the 2nd degree burns that kinda ruin it.

I will go back but perhaps try a different dish.  The atmosphere is cute and exactly what you would expect for a nicer mexican restaurant.  Entrees were $16-25 a piece though and I thought that was a little pricey for the area and for the food.",4EiFaBpiifBhGbPwQ7O-bg,0,0,4,9-TSjqw2LlAirGgwgeUlHA

Parking has never been an issue.  That being said depending on when you arrive,  the wait could be an issue.  My advise is be prepared as the inside and outside waiting area's are small.  You could opt for a seat in the bar to wait or dine.  But is you have to wait..where ever that might be..hang in there because it it all worth it.

The inside of LMC is full of character and when you are eventually seated, creates a vibe where you can focus on your family and drown everything else out.

The chips, salsa, and bean dip are divine.  Many a visit I have sabotaged myself.  DON'T DO IT!  It might take you a few visits to learn this and STILL on my most recent visit I failed to heed my own advise.  BALANCE!  Don't spoil the meal with a belly full of this mana.

My personal favorites (so far) are as follows...

The Queso Fundiso, it's fun to say and fun to eat.  Make sure you add the fungus (mushrooms).  It's makes this gooey and cheesy combination with the delicious tortillas POP!

Next up is Leticia's award winning ""Quesa Tacos.""  This consists of a blend of melted cheeses cooked in a delicious sauce.  You can choose shrimp, chicken or beef, carne asada, or many other meats.  The beef and the shrimp have been my favorites.  You can control the heat of the meal to your liking.  The Pobalano rice is phenomenal!

On my last LMC adventure, I thought I would try something REALLY different.  ""El Molcajete"" is the prehistoric version of the popular flaming fajitas. Primal but even more delicious, it comes in a smoldering bowl which looks like it was made out of volcanic stone.  A slab of tender carne asada, cheese, ranchero sauce, with shrimp. There was also some greenery hanging off the side which I thought was poblano pepper.  WRONG! After looking at the website, it was a delicious piece of Mexican Cactus.

The Margarita's...............................You will just have to experience them yourself.

The service though one time or two seemed overtaxed.  But the other staff tries hard to fill in making the experience seamless.  When everything IS in sync, no one cane beat it's tasty and friendly efficiency.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,7,5,5,IYgFBiW5ky41d9UfG0B2tw

QuesaTacos wrapped in a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese, stuffed with our grilled shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce ""Mild, Medium or Spicy"" your choice of tortillas and topped with our chipotle cream sauce, served with our Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas, Additional filling choices of gilled Chicken, shredded Beef, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Birria, Chicken Tinga or any Sautéed Vegetables.

I had two original shrimp tacos.  My son had regular tacos: two Al pastor and two Birria (goat).  I gave him one of mine and took one of his birria.  FMR, they were delicious.  The Quesa Taco was superior, and the birria was tender and sweet.

When we sat down, we were brought chips and three bowls of dips: one fire-roasted salsa, one bean dip, and one an avocado-tomatillo sauce.  Excellent.  Even the beans and rice which accompanied my taco plate were spiced and cheesed.  I've never had rice in a Mexican restaurant as flavorful.

Leticia's is a nice-looking restaurant.  The décor is pleasing to the eye and they have patio dining.  I opted for the inside.  To start, they offer chips with a tomatillo sauce and a darker salsa which was really good.  They also offer a small dish of refried beans.  I ordered the Carnitas plate which comes with your choice of soup (they offered two) or a salad.  I got the salad with the house vinaigrette.  That vinaigrette was fabulous!  The Carnitas plate came with refried beans, rice, guac and pico de gallo.  The pork was fork tender and fragrant.  The corn tortillas were warm.  I totally enjoyed my meal.  The service was good, albeit intrusive.  I like attention to my table, but not so much where everyone was stopping by the table to ask how everything was.  The waiter stopped by, the busboy stopped by, the host stopped by.  I fully expected someone to walk in off the street to stop by and ask about my meal.

We sat down and browsed the menu, everything sounded yummy. It took 15 mins before anyone came over to take our drink order. They brought chips and 3 different salsas!

They give you the option of red or green enchilada sauce. Everything came and looked amazing and smelled even better. Sadly that was not the case. My enchilada was warm, not hot,so you didn't get that yummy, cheesy feel when you cut into it.

I'm not sure if I'm more pissed at the restaurant for being sub-par or this many yelpers being fooled by such simple bullshit. It's my fault for being on my dying cell phone and not taking the time to read the reviews. Otherwise I would have dismissed this place IMMEDIATELY when I realized  ""multiple salsas"" was the CONSISTENT 5 star standard for a quality establishment!  Are you frickin kidding me?

Food.  I'll try to take my shitty experience out of this equation for the moment and ask why people love this bland cookie cutter On the Boarder franchise-esq, no heart, soulless food? After finally be able to put in the order (after 20 min wait) we waited another 20 mins (I know because I timed it) to get a cold to semi-warm plate, the carnitas was over cooked, tough (that's a HUGE accomplishment if you know how to make it) and bland. Had a nice piece of bone in there too. The beans had that nice dried crust layer on top like it had been sitting under the heat lamp a little too long but was too far to get the heat. 
That salsa everyone loses their shit over, was okay. El Torrito and On the Boarder has that too, so does Rubio's technically. 

Service: This was just stupid. And I'm kicking myself for not walking out. Went on a late Sunday afternoon after hiking Mt. Charleston (needless to say, hungry). The place is hardly busy. One girl comes over to take drink orders, says she can't take beer orders, but the the bartender can who will also be our waitress. I don't know why she couldn't have given our order to the bartender when she informed her of our table. 10 mins later, bartender comes (Natalie) ""You want something from the bar?"" Place DRINK order. I've been watching her from my table 15 ft away flirting with some douche face at the bar. Beer comes out in a glass so cold the beer is slushy. I'm not only a pretentious dick, I'm also a beer snob. I like to taste my beer, frozen glass = no taste. In spite of my annoyance, I asked nicely If I can have a glass that isn't iced. Natalie ""They all come like that.""  Me, ""how about that (soda) glass that isn't frozen or run one under some cold water?"" 10 mins pass, flirts with douche, comes back, replaces beer in different frozen glass. Now takes FOOD order.
Food comes out like it's been under a heat lamp and the beans have that nice crust on them. We pick at our food. Flag  Natalie down for our bill, and get the hell out of this pit.

1. I am gluten INTOLERANT- This does not stop me from having ALL of the wheat based foods. NOW, don't be disheartened ,oh fellow GF kin- there ARE options and they are drooliscious!!
2. Honestly, I think that number 1 fully encompasses my thoughts on the contents of this place....
3. I asked for EXTRA salsa TO GO!!! You know, the salsa that comes with the chips and salsa at most Mexican restaurants?? YEAH....I went HAM on that salsa.
4. They didn't charge me for it like other places would...super thumbs up. 
5. It's family owned to the point where the owner HERself comes out to greet the customers and even cooks some of the food alongside her chefs- GIRL POWER!!",nRE1JWGAez1NQYO1LKyfZA,0,0,5,N-Gfk0BHfMfNQg0aP50-_Q

The first time we came was December 2014 and we were highly impressed!  The atmosphere is very authentic and fun.  The service was great and the food was delicious!  We were raving about our great experience for days.  My boyfriend and I thought we finally found a worthwhile Mexican restaurant near us. 

Sadly, our most recent experience is probably going to be our last experience for a while.  The server seemed a little overwhelmed and we saw more of the busboy then anyone else.  Being a Tuesday night it wasn't jam packed.  Our burritos were beyond mediocre and I could've made a better one at home.   

The menu is a little pricy for Mexican food.  What we were once okay paying, now seems like a rip off.  I have no problem paying more for great food and the experience.  The past few times I've gone have been disappointing and I walk out feeling jipped.

When we arrived, it seemed others agreed with him as there were a lot of parties waiting to be seated on a Saturday night. 

After about a 20 minute wait, we were seated and promptly greeted by our friendly server. He got our drinks to us quickly and loaded us up with fresh chips, salsa, and a tasty bean dip (all free of charge!). The salsa was a bit too spicy for me and also a little runny, but the bean dip was just so addicting and delicious. My friends and I were all but fighting over it!

When the time came to order, I chose to go with their ""award winning"" quesa tacos with carne asada. I was so very pleased when they arrived. The tortillas were so soft and fresh, the cheese was stringy and flavorful, and the spicy sauce tucked between the two tortillas was insanely good. I don't handle heavy spice well at all and this was just perfect for me. The steak was tender and juicy. It was all great!

The included sides were the meaty beans (similar flavor profile to the bean dip) and a cheesy rice casserole. Both were yummy but the tacos were quite filling, particularly after loading up on all of those chips and bean dip!

Overall, this is a great place to stop for some delicious Mexican food, very much worth the drive. Good food, good service, and good prices! Just be prepared for a bit of a wait if you come on the weekend...but it'll be worth it!",WdezEW3GjYnCeOmTCxX1TA,1,0,4,_Mlvv5vA_9xl2T-bbgyK1g

Our wait wasn't that long, though the restaurant was incredibly busy. Our waitress had absolutely no people skills and was clearly in a rush to get through ordering and move on to a new table. She was also seemingly unable to answer any questions about the menu.

We ordered drinks and they were forgotten about until our entrees arrived, which was only minutes after the chips and salsa arrived. This kind of ""speedy"" service is nothing but rushing a guest through dinner so they can turn over the table faster. This resulted in little time to enjoy the chips, salsa, and guacamole we ordered.

The food was sub-par. The chips didn't taste fresh, the guacamole was covered in cheese (that wasn't specified on the menu) which completely took away from the taste of the avocados. I ordered the enchiladas (one red and one green) and both were tasteless. The sides of rice and beans tasted as if they had been sitting under a lamp for a good hour or so which wouldn't surprise me given how quickly they arrived. I also ordered a house margarita that tasted more like pure sugar than anything else.

The first time we sat at a booth by the bar and a college football game was on so it was a little loud but we could easily carry on a conversation. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering questions, and we were promptly served our beer, waters and chips with salsa trio.

You can choose from family style or individual selections and we each chose seperately. My mom got Guisados de Casa -chile verde which was really good. The pork was super tender without being mushy or fatty and was seasoned well. I got chicken fajitas which were excellent....two people could easily share this. My husband got spicy chicken quesatacos...they were okay but the poblano casserole served alongside was awwwesome. 

Our second trip was just as successful. We went on a weeknight and it was much quieter. Our waitress was helpful, although not quite as prompt. Very friendly however! My mom went with spinach and mushroom enchiladas which she liked but I probably wouldn't order...I felt like they needed something to brighten them up and cut the heaviness of the creamy sauce. My husband and I each ordered grilled fish tacos with soft flour tortillas. I have had fish tacos from Ensenada to Costa Maya to Belize and I can say 100% that these were the best I've ever had, and it's hard to top eating them while sitting on a white sand beach with turquoise water staring at you. 

The fish was perfectly seasoned and light, super fresh tasting with a perfect fish to sauce ratio. The veggies were also perfectly proportioned and every bite was just as perfect as the first.  We mentioned to the server how much we enjoyed them and she told us on Monday nights their street-sized tacos are all available for 1.25 each!

Chips and Salsa start the meal, like almost every Mexican Restaurant here in Las Vegas.  That is not the case in the places I have been in Mexico... but I'm a fan anyways.  And Letecia gives you three dip choices...  A traditional salsa, salsa verde, and bean dip.  All are excellent, though my favorite is the bean dip. 

The entree's are excellent.  They boast a variety of creative tacos that will really get your tasebuds firing.  But I was all about the mole poblano on this trip.  Now I have had some great mole's in Mexico and every one is different from the next.  Here in the states, most places get too caught up on the ""chocolate"" part.  In reality several Mole's don't even include chocolate and those that rank among the best in Mexico don't emphasize the chocolate.  The sauce has dozens of ingredients.  I was really excited to try Leticia's.  Unfortunately, it came across too chocolate for me.  This will probably appeal to a lot of people... but not me.  Everything else was great and all my party enjoyed their food.  It was all excellent.... but I just didn't care for the mole.

Topping off your meal with fresh Churo's is a nice nod to Mexican street food and truly delicious.

The service was excellent and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  I like Leticia's a lot!  I will be back often for the tacos and enchiladas... but not for the mole poblano.

We got the cheaper one to try because we were unsure of how good they were. They were great! They were stuffed with meat (not skimpy at all) with onions and cilantro and they give you some guacamole, limes and some come with sauces to put on them. 
They also have happy hour from 2-6 and have a bunch of small plates for $3 and $5. We tried the shrimp ceviche and cochinita pibil that were both $3. They were pretty good too.

When the busser came to the table he was unaware of what the salsa was called that he was serving but was very rude about it. It was like he was upset at us because he didn't speak English. His name was Rosalto. We asked him for To-go boxes and he became annoyed because we asked for one that the taquitos fit in as he brought us a bowl for them. We asked for a cup for my moms tea and he rudely said ""you can't put your margarita in there"" we said it's for our tea. When he came back he physically reached over the table to grab the cup out of my moms hand, then all a sudden he spoke English. We said it's tea, he then walked away and started muttering words to other servers about us and then stared me down as we walked out the door.

And I am definitely in the latter group.  I can only imagine my disappointment and confusion had I read the reviews before eating at this restaurant.

We went on a Sunday around 2:00.  The hostess was unfriendly and unwelcoming, but nonetheless we were seated quickly.  The restaurant look and feel is very average.  No unique decor, no ambiance, just your basic looking food house.  Very misleading from the outside appearance, in my opinion.

As I perused the menu, I was particularly struck by all of the specific rules, guidelines, directives, footnotes, etc.  Split plate charges (even on kids meals!), drink substitution upcharges, different type of rice charges, etc.  I actually read the whole menu cover to cover because it was so silly.  I actually found myself wondering if the chips and salsa would be charged to us, or not refilled for free.  Hey, I understand businesses have to make money, but the food is already way overpriced and expensive, the special rules just make it absurd.

Anyway, so the super tiny basket of tortilla chips and 3 varieties of salsa/dip were brought to our table by an apathetic busgirl.  The waiter soon followed and placing our orders was an easy, quick process.  We ate the chips in about 4 minutes, so we flagged down the busgirl to get a refill.  I was surprised to learn that the chips and salsa were, in fact, complimentary (haha), but we ended up receiving our first refill after our food was already delivered to the table (so about 20 minutes from the time we asked).  Which, hey, great, we didn't fill up on chips and salsa, right?

So, I had an order of ceviche and a carnitas street taco.  The ceviche was fine.  Not good, not bad.  Just basic.  The street taco was absolutely disgusting.  At first, I was impressed with the amount of meat, but when I realized it was very little meat and mostly globs of fat, I quickly lost my appetite.  That was made worse when I smelled my husband's ground beef tacos, which, I swear, smelled like cat food.  My husband, who eats everything, ate about a half of his taco.

In the end, we chalked this up to a ""learning experience,"" and paid our bill and left.  We are not the type to complain to try and get something for free.  I sent in feedback online, because I think it's important for the owners to know the details, but I haven't heard back.  I can't say I'm surprised, and I will never step foot in this restaurant again.",zwzB0nCc-dzNMR_qewcogw,5,0,2,W656uI-Iqg-e_tUfOYMgHg

 With that being said, Leticia's definitely has the best Carnitas in Vegas.  Overall, I think their food is excellent.  They have some of the most tender, flavorful Carnitas I have ever eaten.  I've also had their Carne Asada burrito and the Milanesa; both where the steak was also tender and flavorful, and not tough and chewy.  I've had better chips & salsa at other places, but I can't complain when it's free (part of the meal).  Of the numerous visits, I've only had one visit with slow service, and our food took 30 minutes to come out from the time we ordered.  All other visits, the service was great and the food came out fast.  Prices are decent for lunch specials, but I haven't eaten dinner there yet.
I haven't been disappointed with the food there yet, and I would recommend this place to anyone.

It has a nice atmosphere and I bet it would be a neat place to take a stroll at night. 

The service was just average, even a bit slow at times. Nice enough but it took longer than expected for condiments and few other items to show up at our table after the food arrived. I had the empanada lunch special with grilled shrimp. At $9 it was a reasonable portion, served with rice and beans. It was crazy heavy on the onions. I like onion for sure, but I couldn't taste anything else. The onion overwhelmed all the other flavors in the dish. Rice and beans were pretty standard, nothing to brag about. 

I also tried the shrimp a la diabla. It was much better than my own meal. Nice and spicy with a good amount of tiger prawns. I didn't try a margarita, perhaps it's the star of the show?

Sometimes it takes us forever to come up with a decision, other times it doesn't. But thanks to Yelp, we found this place and both agreed on it right away. 

Right away, our drinks arrived along with our chips and dip. Dip was beans, tomatillo sauce and a chipotle roasted salsa. All delish and packed with flavor. I don't usually like beans, but these were pretty good. The bf also put in an order of guacamole with crab. Their guacamole was also really good. It was thick and chunky with big pieces of crab on top. 

Now for our main dishes. Since I was getting full from chips and dip, I opted for a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a side salad. My cup of soup was a huge serving for it being in a cup. It was ok, nothing special. It was a little on the salty side so I wasn't able to eat it all. I also got a side salad, which was AWFUL!! When it arrived at the table, there was so much cheese on it. Then I noticed the reason why it was covered in so much cheese was because the lettuce was old and wilted. I asked our server to just take it off the bill and she was shocked that my salad looked the way it did. She was nice about it and took it off. The bf's carne asada burrito was the highlight of the meal. The meat was so tender. Although the burrito was on the smaller side, it was packed with so much meat, cheese and beans that we both got full from it. 

Definitely a good spot for Tex-Mex food! Since I live so far away, I doubt I'll be eating here any time again soon. If I'm in the area, this will definitely be a one of my options though.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,3,1,4,2-v-h-udugkfGOHrVT_QcQ

Located right off the freeway in the Centennial area, it reminded me of Tavoli Village actually. It was a very cute location and secluded. Upon walking in at 6pm it was pretty busy. We waited only about 20 minutes though. When you check in you receive a free house margareita so I took advantage of that. The beau got a guava jalapeno margareita. Oh that was delish!

Of course a red and green salsa and bean dip w/ chips came out. I always appreciate that because sometimes you just have the munchies as you wait for your food.

So I ordered ceviche with crab. oh my goodness, that was one of the best ceviches I ever had. The crab just made it extea amazing. It wasn't too sour because I hate when it is. It was the perfect amount. I had to order fresh guac of ocurse. Their guac is topped with a slice of queso which is apreciated also. You can also add crab on the guac, we didn't, but that sounds like a good idea! i love crab.

I got pork/beef pozole. I honeslty have had authentic home made pozole so in my mind I always compare it so Leticia's pozole didn't really cut it for me but the beau really liked it. It didn't have all the spices that I craved in it I dont know what was missing. 

We also ordered carne, chicken, shrimp Molcajete. That was a lot of food. It was sooooo good! that is something I reccomend if you are dining with friends because that could be easily shared. 

The waiter, I forgot his name, was amazing. He really helped us in information about the menu and ordering the right foods. He was awesome! everything came out in a reasonable time. We did order a lot of food for 2 so it was appreciated it did not come out all at once because we wouldn't have room on the table and that was all due to our waiter. 

I ordered a CocoFlan to go because I was so full but I needed dessert for later. That was amazing. The chocolate cake was very moist and the flan wasn't too sweet. It was perfect.

The chile rellenos (I had the cheese and also the beef stuffed rellenos) are not even worth rating as average.  They were severely undercooked, and normally you don't need to take in a knife to cut rellenos.  I was literally cutting through what seemed like raw chile.  The rellenos we have at our employee dining room tastes better than theirs.  And Leticia's is not cheap.  

Their award-winning tacos were delicious however, and that's what warranted them that extra star.  Their fried ice cream was also very good.

One thing that threw me off was the girl who first took our drink orders. She was under 18 so she couldn't bring me an alcoholic beverage which is what I wanted so there was some mix up with who I was supposed to order the drink from and how it was going to get to my table.

Unfortunately the experience went bad pretty quickly for us.  We showed up around 4pm on a Saturday night, nobody was waiting and half the restaurant was empty tables.  We were told it was a 10-15 minute wait.  Marginally confused by that we assumed it was because of a lack of servers or because we were 2 adults with a baby and stroller and just maybe they were waiting for the right table for us.
After 15 minutes we were sat at the first table in the place that didn't look like it was normally used, it was missing stuff that other tables had and one side was 3 inches taller than the other.   This started our discomfort, it also was very hot being right near the door.  Overall we didn't think this was the end of the world and were excited to try some hopefully great food.
We started with a pitcher of margaritas and chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa were very good, we thought we had found a great place.  It came with 2 salsas and beans with excellent flavor and the chips were homemade.  The margarita was so so, a little sugary and didn't taste alcohol but definitely not a deal breaker.
Everything went wrong with the food and how they handled it.  I ordered the Hamburgesa Poblana and my wife ordered the Leticia's Award Winning Quesa Tacos.  The tacos were OK, definitely not what a lot of these pictures showed.  Our server forgot about us a lot and they seemed like they had sat under a light for 10 minutes before coming to the table.  Not near as good as we hoped but edible.  The Hamburgesa Poblana was one of the worst things I've ever had.  At first I noticed the bread was dry and it was forgetting the sauce it said it came with.  I waited ten minutes for the server to get some sour cream hoping to make it better.  After finally getting that and adding it I realized it was missing the bacon, avocado and toreados.  I figured oh well at this point eat it and move on.  A few bites in I had to stop.  The meat was pink and barely cooked, everything was soggy, the bread seemed days old and somehow this burger tasted fishy.  I couldn't do it.  I waited another while to tell the server I was sorry I couldn't eat this, it was missing things and not done right and we'd appreciate our check,  She was nice enough about it, did try to push us on dessert (I have only ate chips and margarita at this point and just wanted to leave) but then came back with the check.  On the check was a charge for the sour cream which was supposed to be on the burger in the first place.  I ended up grabbing a manager and she tried to help but I still left spending $45 for some sugary margaritas, a stale meal for my wife and a burger that isn't making me feel well.  Overall I appreciate the manager at the end trying to help (She did offer to comp the burger next time to try it again but I can't bare the thought of a next time honestly) but I can't recommend this place or come back.  Maybe we just had a bad experience but it isn't a good feeling leaving a place paying $45 for what we got.

An order of 3 queso carne asada tacos, guacamole, french fries (for my nephew), and one lemonade ended up costing $68.  That would have been fine if the food was gourmet-level, authentic Mexican food but it tasted like Roberto's. If I wanted to eat subpar, greasy food I would have just gone there and paid their prices. One of our orders was supposed to sub a side salad for beans but the order included the beans with no salad in sight. The boxes had no markings to distinguish the spicy tacos from the mild. A few bites in, my cousin bit into a hair baked into her food so everybody was grossed out and that dish had to be thrown out. 

We also notified one of the staff that the prices aren't accurate on their online menu and he said that they already had 3 complaints about that earlier that day. Seems like they should either honor those prices or change their online menu so diners aren't in for a nasty surprise. The food was cold when we picked it up and they were very stingy with the condiments. When we asked for salsa, we were given a miniature to-go sauce container and told that if we wanted more it would be an additional $5. Don't order take-out from here unless you want to be nickel and dimed for every little thing.

Good:

chips and drinks out right away. Some reviewers say the chips are nothing special but they were delicious. Just salty enough and a little thicker than the standard chips. The salsas were pretty good but the bean dip stood out the most. We also ordered a small guac which was huge and it was so good. You can get a side of jalepenos to mix in yourself. 

The horchata was super fresh tasting if you like that. I personally like the less authentic manufactured ones but this was also good. 

The service here is great. Our server actually recommended the smaller guac when we were gonna order the large. 

Bad: 

The rice and beans were not that good, which is the case at most Mexican places. I've had authentic rice and beans an leticias dry flavorless rice was pretty bad. The beans tasted no different from canned retried beans. 

While we both enjoyed our entrees, thy were nothing special. I had the fish tacos. The sauce was good but the fish did not taste good. There was too much lettuce and cheese. My girlfriend had beef tamales. Everything was good but the enchilada style sauce.

The sauces they make for enchiladas and such are incredible, I had the chicken mole enchiladas and they were amazing.  I have also tried all kinds of dishes of others and they were all good.  The bad experience I had was the time I went with some real picky eaters, we had all kinds of special requests and the waiter was rude and basically said that they couldn't figure it out.  Then the meal came completely wrong (surprise).  Also on another occasion a guest got carnitas and it was just big chunks of fat (and I eat carnitas all the time).  

They do have a deal on fridays I think when you can get 1.50 street style tacos and they are awesome.

They've been fairly busy each time we visited but they get you seated quickly. One reason behind my 4 stars is their waiting area. It's extremely small and with the cold weather right now, no one wants to be outside. Last night was a busy night and you could barely get in the door to put your name down. They also don't take reservations so with large groups waiting for a table, it was hard to even find a place to stand out of the way from employees and guests coming/going.

As far as the food goes, I haven't had a bad experience here. As soon as you sit down you're greeted with warm chips and 3 dips, one of which is a bean dip which my wife absolutely loves. They also serve a guacamole style dip and a spicier red salsa. Each one is good, the salsa has a good spice to it and they each have a great fresh homemade taste.  

Being a cheese fanatic, on our first visit, I had the QuesaTacos and they are spectacular. Last night I had the tamales and even those surprised me since most ""restaurant tamales"" just aren't that good. I love that they will let you choose two styles in several dishes like the tacos and tamales I've had. I decided on 1 green sauce chicken and 1 red sauce beef tamale. My wife went with shredded chicken enchiladas. The food came out extremely fast and was even brought to us by the Executive Chef of the restaurant. They plate the dishes with generous portions of rice and beans . My tamales were delicious, the masa was moist and fluffy, both meats were juicy and even by themselves had great flavor. The only thing I did not like about the tamales were the onions. I'm usually a fan of onions but they basically threw on some slices of raw onion that just didn't quite work with the tamales. All in all, a great meal and my wife loved the enchiladas as well!

With the $15 for $25 deal, our bill came out to $5.49 (without tip) which included two dinners, one soda and one beer. Beer being another reason for my 4 star review. As another Yelper noted, they serve their beer in frosted mugs which for us beer guys is a little disappointing.

I also ordered the fish tacos which were $13 on the menu the check showed $13 + $1 for Fish. excuse me? you charged me a dollar for fish when i ordered fish tacos?? lastly the fish tacos came with ONE wedge (for 2 large tacos) of lime which had not one drop of juice so i showed the waiter the lemon was dry and asked him for a replacement.  He took so long my tacos got cold and i ended up using the lime from my margarita cup instead.  He finally showed and apologized for the long wait.

3248190,2011-03-12,0,pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ,"Over the last year or so my taste in Mexican food has grown more sophisticated.

Circa 2009 if it had cheese and Mexican spices I was generally happy, but recently I've found old favourites like Guadalajara at Sunset Station and Cafe Coyote aren't hitting the spot like they used to.

My wife and I went to Leticia's for lunch today with a groupon and I've gotta say that I've found my new favourite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Even though it's a huge hike north to go here, the food was so good I am sure we will be back often.

The chips looked worrisome, but looks are deceiving, they are fresh as can be and absolutely delicious. They come out with some very good bean dip, and a pair of excellent salsas (one red, one green) - No ""spicy pasta sauce on a bowl"" here - these salsas taste how salsa should taste.

We started our meals with the Mexican corn which was very tasty without being overwhelming and I followed this with a plate of Nachos. I was really pleased with the use of good quality Mexican cheese and the options available so I could tailor my nachos to my specifications. I went with carne asada (incredible quality for a nacho topping) and chiles toreados. 

Now, I'm something of a nacho connoisseur - if I see them on the menu then chances are they are what I am ordering - these were some really special nachos. It wasn't just the quality of the cheese. It wasn't the delicious carne asada and the fresh and tasty chips. It wasn't even the wonderfully roasted and flavourful whole green onions that laced the top of my food. It was a combination of everything. The best nachos I have eaten in Vegas by some distance.

My wife ordered vegetable enchiladas with mushrooms and spinach which came with a white rice casserole with crema, cheese and peppers. A real change from the ""Cheese in a tortilla with sauce"" that's often her only vegetarian option at Mexican places and we both really liked how Leticia's offers more to have with your meal than just rice and beans. Thought has really gone into this menu.

Overall, a great meal in pleasant surroundings. An absolute no brainer to award this one 5 stars.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,2,1,5,Csm2uk8cG0RlVW2Gwgb-Xw

The most recent experience is I was given a incorrect meal after waiting a very long time for it to arrive.  During our wait our water glasses were not filled and we were not given any extra chips. I asked to speak to manager who basically told me that there  would be no charge for my meal but my son's meal was still being charged ""$20.00 for a build your own burrito"". So I waited for him to eat. It was a horrible experience once again. Anyone considering going to Leticia's please look for another place to go. I am not a one time customer who had a bad experience.

When the Mrs. and I were discussing lunch plans on a Sunday afternoon, mexican food was mentioned and we were off to ""that mexican place right down the street."" The atmosphere was great and we were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess. We were seated in an area near, but away from, the bar. Chips were on the table almost simulatneoulsy with us sitting down with three different types of ""dip"" to induldge in. The bean dip was outstanding. Great flavor with whole pinto beans, along with a mixture of the standard consistency of bean dip. The bean dip was accompanied by a red sauce and a green tomatillo sauce. Both were very good and full of flavor.

We ordered their mexican style corn as an appetizer. Corn on the cob, grilled to perfection and covered with crumbled bits of cotija cheese, melted butter and thick creamy mexican cream. This is a must have. I would have been satisfied just powering through these for lunch. I chose carne asada tacos for the entree. You have the option of hard, soft or ""puffy"" tortillas. The waitress was more than happy to allow me a different type of tortilla on each taco. I opted for soft and ""puffy."" Both were great and I would describe the ""puffy"" as kind of like the torilla bowl you would expect to get a taco salad in. The carne asada was thee best I have had in Vegas. It was tender and juicy with plenty of spice and flavor.

The Mrs. chose the ""hamburgesa."" You may be asking yourself ""why would she order a hamburger at a mexican food joint?"" One bite and you just might say ""this is the best hamburgesa I've ever had."" I have had hamburgers at mexican restaurants before that are obviously just on the menu to satisfy someone who didn't want mexican but went along with the crowd. or was coerced by family or friends. This was anything other than your standard hamburger. The patty was handmade and seasoned to perfection. It comes on a torta style bun, complete with tomato, bacon and avocado. The french fries were crinkle style and mighty tasty. 

The menu says if you check-in on Yelp and show the waiter/waitress, you will get a free dessert. We couldn't take advantage of this, as we were stuffed and in the beginning stages of our food comas. Although nobody was seated at the bar yet, it did look like pretty cool place to hang out, catch a game on the TV and enjoy your favorite libation.

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back to work my way through a menu that includes ""Baja Style Fish Tacos"", ""Rib Eye Tacos"" and ""Carne Asada Nachos.""",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,4,4,5,2CVyABjbSsFoEvpAuZD18g

Lunch started two very good salsa's and warm bean dip, and was quickly followed up with a very tasty tomato noodle soup!

Apparently the table we were supposed to get would not accomodate a high chair or it would have been in the way. So they would get us another table.  15 minutes later we're still waiting. I took my son to the bathroom and noticed a large party had just left and the staff was pulling apart the 3 tables they had used. I figured that one of those would be for us; the space looked perfect to fit the high chair.

NO, fajitas were terrible & bland. We ordered fajitas for 2, but there was barely 4 ounces of meat, mostly onions.
I easily cook better than the food here.
Oh so of course you can add 1 back because of the cost.
NO, it was $18, that's right $18 per person; a total of $36. There are many other places where you can get much better, for less.",BGdFXPaIYA1h1Zq2X-8egQ,1,0,1,LDyrXcF1HgfSQuijzLVe1w

We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.

I was so pleased with the ""Happy Hour Menu"". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the ""Cheese Quesadilla"" and ""Chorizo Taco"". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.

I tried the ""Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos"" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.

The ""Fried Ice Cream"" is very yummy!

My experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same. Excellent.

The patio is amazing, and so cute, and when the weather is good, to sit outside and chat and eat does not compare to sitting inside with a/c and a loud restaurant- so that was a bummer. Multiple times. The other thing is that I got my world rocked by the vegan tamales on a previous visit, and tried to order them on the next few visits, and was told that they were out of them.

I ordered the carnitas and the meat was tender and savory , the rice actually tasty, and the tortillas homemade. Comparable to my San Diego Mexican food.

Mexican Corn, Salsa Macha, Pozole, Ribeye tacos ala carte and a boat load of churros for the kids.

For me, this was almost a religious eating experience. My husband feels it is the best Mexican food in the city and we have eaten around.

Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  

I decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!

A few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.

But we used to live a couple of miles away in Centennial Hills, and now that we have moved to Henderson, our ""couple of minutes"" drive changed to a ""little over a half hour"" drive.  But, um, we still do it...  Here's a quick list of why:
1) Best Margarita in the valley.  Well, if you like them... I know, every place makes them differently, but here they use multiple fresh squeezed lime slices and that works with the pattern of fresh food here, and it's really tasty.
2) Best interesting drink - the Pomegranite Margatini is totally unique and I can't even list all of the ingredients here...  But it's one of my wife's favorite drinks of all time!
3) Ignacia - oh, yeah, the Margatini is generally only a good drink if she's the one who makes it.  Everything she makes is awesome, even if she's taking care of the bar and the entire dining room at the same time...
4) Ignacia again - sorry to be redundant, but beyond drinks, she knows the food and what mama's making, and knows what is good, and very quickly learns what you like!  Which is invaluable... Even if you don't know what to order, just let her do it.

Unfortunately, the last time I was there a larger party was seated next to us and we literally did not get any attention from our server again. Someone else dropped our food off at the table and we had to wait several minutes and then chase someone down to get our drinks refilled. Finally, we had to ask a busboy passing by for the check.

Molcajete de Mariscos, served spicy -  Lobster, clams, shrimp, mussels, & fish in a special sauce, white arroz poblano (rice, peppers, & cheese casserole ).  Served in a hot Molcajete (three-legged round bowl, which has been carved out of basalt).  The seafood was all perfectly cooked, the broth was spicy but not too hot.  The broth was flavored of roasted peppers, tomatoes, & seafood broth (not fishy).  The arroz served as a balance to the bold flavors of the broth but very tasty in its own right.  Something that impressed me was the white fish being flaky, the shellfish being tender, not rubbery, and the lobster meat being easy to pull out of tail, but not overcooked.  I highly recommend this dish

Pastel de Tres Leches - A very moist desert cake topped with citrus & whipped cream.  I am not a great lover of cake, but this is sublime.  Moist & flavorful, Leticia also infuses some type of cordial or liquor in the cake.  The flavor is creamy with a mild citrus flavor.  If you're a choc-o-holic, maybe you should look elsewhere, but, I consider this a great desert.

Standard Margarita - Buy them by the pitcher, on the rocks.  They put the ice in your glass and the pitcher remains un-diluted.  Every drink is good with their perfect proportions and better than average tequila.  The Cadillac Margarita is expensive, but excellent.

The only problem I ever have at Leticia's has been service.  Since I am a regular, that typically isn't a problem, so I may not be the best to assess their service.  Regardless, the staff is always warm & friendly with many regulars, and very friendly regulars at the bar.  

Of special note: During warmer months on Mondays, street tacos are available in front, on the corner of Norman Rockwell & Farm Road.  Reduced price and, in my opinion, even better flavor.  On Saturday nights, after 8, there is karaoke in the bar area. Gustavo (restaurant partner) typically sings and gently cajoles the regulars into giving it a go. Very fun.
 
The restaurant itself is very clean and is in the location that was previously Joey's Seafood Only.  Parking is generous with street parking on Norman Rockwell and a well lit parking lot behind the restaurant.

We took my niece there for dinner.  We got there a bit early so seating was no problem but when we left there seemed to be a wait.  

Started off with their chips, bean dip and salsas.  LOVED the salsa verde.  My niece raved and she is 8!!  The beans and other salsa were just fine.  My niece ordered off the kids menu and had the chicken burrito (came with beans rice, a beverage and dessert).  She really liked the burrito.  

My husband ordered the Latecia's Quesa Tacos which had a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese stuffed with shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce ""and topped with a chipotle cream sauce.  It came with a  small individual cheesy rice casserole  topped with crema and chile and a side of beans (he picked refried).  I stole that tasty little rice casserole right from under his nose!  I would come back for that and their grilled mexican corn on the cob!  That corn was super tasty!

I had their Taquitos dinner which gives you a good variety to choose from.  I chose the beef picadillo, chicken, and the most delectable  Potato and Cheese wrapped in  corn tortillas and fried crispy. All were topped with guacamole,  Oaxaca cheese, cotija cheese, crema and pico de gallo.  I had a side of black beans and cilantro rice.

4038762,2015-04-09,0,pomGBqfbxcqPv14c3XH-ZQ,"- The Skinny:

Food Quality: 5 Stars
-  Real Mexican food in Vegas! Tried the following with my family:

El Molcajete (Mexican style Fajitas) - Grilled Carne Asada, or Chicken (you can add chicken), Tiger Prawn Shrimp, seasoned grilled nopales (Mexican Cactus) served sizzling in a molcajete salsa Ranchera , chile & onion toreados, Queso Oaxaca. Served with mexican rice, guacamole, pico de gallo and choice of tortillas. We had the carne asada & added Chorizo. 

Tasty! But not as much meat as other places. A little spicy if you are sensitive. Chorizo was pretty salty. My wife used the left overs to make eggs the next day, sooo good!! 

Enchiladas Del Mar (Seafood Enchiladas) - Shrimp And/Or fish in Leticia's white Cream and Cheese sauce or Chile de Arbol spicy sauce. Served with a Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas. 

This was really good and different take on a Mexican classic! 

Pozole -  tender beef and pork, slowly cooked with a blend of red guajillo sauce and Leticia's special spices and hominy. Served traditionally with a side of tostaditas, lime, chopped onions, cilantro, chopped lettuce, radishes, oregano, crushed chile and avocad (Chicken Pozole also available).

I didn't try it but my brother enjoyed it.

Quesadilla - Large flour tortillas with house blend of Oaxaca melted cheese, served with guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.

There was A LOT of cheese in these, easily shared by 2 people. Well made and tasty. 

The table Chips, Salsa, and beans were really good too!

Drinks: 5 Stars
- The Mango ""Agua Fresca"" (Fresh Fruit Water) is AMAZING!! The Horchata was also good with a little creamy instead of watery taste most other places have.  

Pricing: 5 Stars
- What you would pay at most sit down Mexican spots. Good portions! 

Service: 4 Stars
- Nice, friendly, attentive, they do a good job! There was a bit of a wait.

Atmosphere: 5 Stars
- Really liked the decor of this place, they really have a that Mexican culture feel. Even the Caucasian host was in a traditional dress!  

Comfort: 5 Stars
- Plenty of seating, comfortable seats and tables. 

Location: 5 Stars 
Plenty of parking in that area, easy seen from the road and simple to get to. 

- The Fat: 

Went out to eat with my brother and his family. Only my sister in law had been there and she loved the place. We weren't convinced though because not to offend, but she's a white girl and were all Mexican (our parents were born/raised in Mexico) so we have more a say so on Mexican food ;)   

We really had a hard time deciding on what to get cause the whole menu looks delicious! We were pleasantly surprised by the food. My wife and I love ""Molcajete"" but it's hard to find a good one, none the less, a place that even serves it! there is a lot of ""soup"" in the molcajete bowl so my wife used the left overs to make eggs the next day, sooo good!!

I really enjoy the ""Enchiladas Del Mar"" and would get that next time. The Mango drink is to die for! If you want a different Mexican food experience far from the usual sit down Mex chains, go here!",snGMkVwMG6mq12R90qmqOg,1,0,5,lryTesLdBV4a1rhTCy_dDA

The buss boy was right away to the table and bring some complimentary chips and 3 different salsa. That was a great start since the salsa and the chips were delicious. 
The server was the Bartender ""Morri"". He was very nice and definitely acted like a bartender not a server. I usually eat alone and love to eat the bar since bartender are not use to serve food and are always happy to get a larger tip than the couple bucks for cocktail they get. Unfortunately this time it looks like Morri had not idea about food or the menu. When I inquiry about vegetarian or vegan, he had no idea what I was talking about and offer me some shrimp and chicken items. After looking at the menu I decided to go for the ""Spinach and Mushrooms Enchilada $15 (add Veggies for $2). The dish was excellent! I am not sure why I had some Veggies since they were almost inexistent in the enchiladas.But one more time it was absolutely delicious and I will not hesitate to come back to have it again. Just for info, I leave close by to the one in Tivoli village and I choose to drive 16 miles due to the review on Yelp. 
I am sure Morri is an excellent Bartender but if management decide to give him some table, maybe they need to train him especially if he is going to type the ""add veggie button"" at 2.89 instead of $2.",8e2KqFt1W67MA3ah09IYbw,2,1,4,R2O1U9hpWBGsR_nkbBGlhA

Not our first time here, we come often. When we arrive, told no more seats at the bar area, she's closed and we're sat on the other side of the restaurant. Server explains no happy hour unless in bar area. Once I explained what we were told, server checks with the manager and comes back with a no can do! So, of course I ask to speak to manager,  who comes to the table and still claims that even though that section is closed, she offers us to move to the bar, but there are no seats open. She is not able to honor the happy hour prices. Basically she said it's a promo to get people in; what I get from this: once they get 10-12 at the bar for happy hour, there's no more happy hour pricing, which is false advertising! Shame on you! We left! There's Happy hour all over town, we went to Lindo Michoacán and were treated wonderfully.

We wanted to go somewhere some what nice and we've heard a lot about this restaurant. We were seated immediately - which was great. But, we didn't have a server approach our table for about 15 mins. There were only three tables including ours in our whole area.. Soo not sure what took so long. After our server finally came and took our order - we did not receive our food for about 30 mins after that.. Our order was small and simple, and yet everything we got was wrong. For an appetizer we ordered elote - which NEVER even came to our table. I ordered a chicken burrito with guac and pico - I received a chicken burrito with those ingredients PLUS unwanted sour cream and jalapeños inside. My husband ordered a carne asada burrito chimichanga style - he received a carne asada burrito enchilada style.. For someone that doesn't like a lot of sauce, that's horrible. Being hungry and frustrated, and no server in sight - we ate what was given to us. Later, the servers station was directly behind our table, and we could hear her saying we did not receive our elote. She came to our table to present us with our check, pretended to look around our table and asked ""oh? You did not receive your elote?"" No mam.. And to your surprise we know Spanish and heard you saying you knew we didn't. Don't really appreciate playing dumb. She proceeded to open our check and show that she did not charge us for it. Again, obviously you knew - don't appreciate the act. How about apologizing - or at least asking if we still wanted it or not before removing it off our check?! On the check we were also charged additional fees for the unwanted toppings we never asked for. No idea what her name was - our busser referred to her as Flaca.. I'll at least give a shout out to our busser, who did a great job covering our servers butt refilling our drinks and chips and making sure we had to go boxes. Overall, my husband and I were debating on $5 Little Cesars and decided we should have something nice - I'd rather have the $5 Little Cesars than this $50 crap experience.

Found Leticia's in the area after a quick search.  When I walked in, the place has an odd smell, maybe it was the furniture or ventilation?  It wasn't an encouraging first impression.

Decor is nice, wood furniture with lots of Windows.  Service very friendly.

When the chips and salsa came, it came with a red, green and bean dip.  Both salsas had excellent flavor and respectable spice level without burning your mouth.  Love bean dip, but this one had a hint of cloves which I don't generally care for.  It grew on me, however, I wondered if all the sauces were going to have ""twists"" on the traditional versions.

I ordered one chicken enchilada green sauce, one shredded beef in red sauce, and one crispy tacos.  When it came out, I got concerned again, since the presentation was really nice.  In my experience, the Mexican places with fancier presentation often lack authenticity. I usually go for no fanfare.  

To my surprise however, the chicken enchilada may have been the best I ever had.  Fresh bright flavor including fresh oregano, tart tomatillo sauce and really tender chicken breast.  Generous amount of meat too.

The shredded beef was super tender and flavorful, and the taco shells were lightly fried just the way I do them at home.  Both very good, although the chicken enchilada was the star on this day.

I'm really picky about authenticity, and Letticia's pleasantly surprised me at every turn.  I don't know if I'll ever be back in this remote area, but the locals have themselves a gem in this one.

If you're a stickler for quality and authenticity like I am, you'll really appreciate this place.

I will vouch for the deliciousness of the Pozole Blanco.  I loved all the fresh veggies that you can add in proportions to your own liking.  I also learned (from having leftovers - the portion sizes were generous...  I had leftover soup from ordering a small) that the avocado in the soup (this soup, at least) was still bright green the second day when I reheated it for lunch as it was the first day.  Cool!

I live down in the Anthem area and can't think of any Mexican restaurant that quite met up to what I saw or experienced this day.  Although I do love Las Cazuelas - gave them 5 stars, too - but their menu is pretty tiny compared with Leticia's although it has the mom and pop atmosphere.

I was to full at this point to order dessert but usually if I don't pig out to much I get the fried ice cream which is also awesome! 

Overall, amazing food, great ambiance, and the staff is friendly! I wish I knew the name of one of the bus guys because he is hilarious and makes me laugh every time I stop in.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,3,1,5,zK58zRTTrmJkfSjHadEZjQ

I will start by saying I love the decor on the inside and outside and the bar area looks great. 

The waitresses were very friendly and were doing a great job at serving our table of 7. The menu was okay but a bit pricy. 

I ordered 2 tamales rice and beans dish for $10.89 my hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas rice and beans for $13.89 + a beer with tax and tip included came to $35, which was a little too high.

The meal itself wasn't too fresh or tasty. My tamale was a little too spicy and no taste, the rice was dry and looked like it was sitting around for hours under a heat lamp. The portion sizes of the sides were just not enough.

In a nutshell I don't mind paying good money for food, but this was definitely not worth it. I'm only giving this joint 3 stars because the service was friendly and the tamale was edible but that's all.

We've been to Leticia's more times than I can count in the year that I've lived here.  We've brought every one of our house guests to Leticia's - and that's a whole bunch because when you live in Vegas people come out of the woodwork to visit.  Everyone we've introduced to Leticia's has fallen in love, just like we did.

Some of our favorites include: Poblano White Rice Casserole (I order it on the side no matter what else I'm ordering), El Molcajete, Quesa Tacos, Sopa de Consomme (which I get to go every time I'm sick) and their bean dip.  The chips are dangerously addicting.  We've never had anything that was bad.  Also, the service is great.  The first time we went our waiter, Mario, was so fantastic that we request to sit in his section every time we visit Leticia's.  He know's the menu inside and out always gives the best suggestions!  

Also, I have to say, I am allergic to MSG and normally stay away from ordering anything with sauce and almost never order soup in restaurants.  If I eat anything with MSG in it I get a horrific migraine the next day.  I have never had a negative reaction to their food.  Before I ordered the soup I asked if they made it in house.  The chef got on the phone and said it was made in house and from scratch.  I wish there were more restaurants like this one!",S7_0FQTMcKPhQzKNFas9rA,0,0,5,vtRxVruad4v15TWLNwhp0g

We had yet to find our spot in the vegas valley for good Mexican food, so we went into this restaurant with open minds. We were greeted by friendly faces, and immediately brought to our table. They brought out a basket of chips (absolutely delicious ones) and 3 dipping options. There was a red salsa, a green salsa, and a bean dip. Both of the salsas were delicious and my daughter scarfed down the bean dip. The menu was large and impressive. Lots of options for all. 

My husband ordered the Nacho plate with carne Assad.  The portion was massive, and the plate was overflowing with delicious toppings. I am not a meat eater, so I didn't not try the steak- but he kept talking about how deliciously seasoned and tender the carne Assad was. He really enjoyed his dish, and had plenty more to take home. 

I ordered a build your own burrito. I found it to be slightly pricy- because I ordered mine with out any meat. BUT, with that said, I would come back and order it again and again. It was massive. It was so tasty, and I couldn't get over the size. I  got my burrito smothered  in green sauce, which I would totally recommend for any green sauce lovers out there. The beans and rice served with my burrito was equally as delicious. That's saying a lot because I'm not one for Spanish rice. I find most restaurants make it so mushy, but this rice was flavorful and had great texture. Obviously, I was not able to finish my burrito in one sitting. 

My four year old ordered off the kids menu and she enjoyed all that was on her plate. Again, the portions were impressive and we had enough to take home as another meal for her. 

I would come back here in a heart beat. I live on the opposite side of town so I'm sad that I'm not closer to this yummy spot. I'm certain the next time we get an itch for Mexican food we will gladly make the drive out from Henderson just to experience their yummy food again.

We were served their chips with a cilantro dip, what I think was roasted tomato salsa and beans.  We had heard so many good things about the restaurant and I was a bit disappointed.

I had the chili relleno, and enchilada platter. The pepper was tough and a bit bitter as was the red sauce on enchilada. Hubby had the empanadas which he said were ok. My friend had the crunchy chicken tacos and liked them very much.

As a third generation Mexican American, I've had the privilege of growing up around the culture and experiencing some of the  most authentic of authentic cuisine on both sides of the US/Mexican Border.  I ordered the batter-less chile relleno stuffed with nicely seasoned shredded chicken. The beans and rice were fresh.  The 2 for 1 Margaritas were also  well appointed if you know what I mean.

The second time we went was a tragedy. We arrived with friends for a double-date night, signed in and waited outside with lots of other people waiting as well. After a half hour and noticing other, new tables getting seated before us, I enquired of the hostess what the deal was and found out that we'd been totally skipped on the list about ten patrons ago. After expressing my displeasure, we still waiting about five minutes, then on the way to the table, my friend fell due to water on the floor. Apologies? Manager rush over to gush on us? Nope...just a, ""Sit here"" in a booth a little too small for four grown adults. The food was still good though.
Third time, tie breaker, we arrived on a Sunday after church and sat outside and it wasn't very busy. This time the service was prompt and the food delicious. The beautiful weather on the small deck didn't hurt either.

But somehow it's lost its way for me. Look at my previous reviews over the years to look at the trend.

It's become inconsistent. It's better during daytime, probably because the owner is there. There are times also for dinner the food is SO salty, SO greasy. Servers are either wonderfully attentive and super friendly or horrible and will never check on you at all. Horchata is sometimes perfectly creamy and spiced and sometimes so cinnamony. It's like being at 2 different restaurants. 

Thinking back, out of the last 6 visits, once both the food and service wasn't good, 2 visits the food was good and service wasnt, 2visits where the food was bad and the service was good, 1 visit where food was amazing and service was too. Most of the good food was earlier in the day. These 6 visits have been the past year, I've gone less and less when we used to come frequently.

They also raised their prices from opening to now, by quite a bit. Most of my favorite dishes have gone up $3 since I first started coming here a few years ago. I like the food and probably would still frequent even with their raises every year if it was still as good consistently, but I think some of the items are priced too high for what they are, they are definitely higher than most competitors aside from Lindo which also prices rather high. 

Go during lunch as they tend to be better then. Also it's cheaper so that if you were iffy about the food, you just didn't pay $15 for 2 enchiladas. 

What is (usually) good here is the carnitas, the chile verde, the mole poblano, enchiladas and I think their mocajete is solid. 

I just wish they would up their standards a little bit again. I might look for a new Mexican food place.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,4,3,_kEcEehKUnomyY9MgDIjOw

I ordered the soft tortilla soup and it was great with the subtle tomato flavor with a squeezed lime is a good balance to bean and starchy flavor.

You can also appreciate the care they put into their chicken enchiladas, it's baked perfectly without being overcooked, the shredded chicken is moist and seasoned perfectly.  It's a great deal for $11 and change.

And I have almost always had a bad experience when we're seated. The waiters/waitresses seem so rushed, so annoyed and just generally pretty rude.

If I'm here with a smaller or larger party,  it's made no difference. Each time, we have been waiting too long or just had a server that doesn't seem too keen about helping us. 

The bartenders are awesome. They have a few new ones that have been excellent. The food each time has come out perfectly and delicious as always. The main reason we come to this place.

I've tried a little bit of everything here...but my favorites are probably the Burritos and tacos!

You can essentially customize your own food here, from the salsa to the ingredients, and of course, the meat! My particular burrito was made with Al Pastor and Red Guajillo, Black Beans, and House Blend Cheese. This was a BEAST...had to take the other half to go! Really loved the salsa...it was actually a bit spicy!

I also liked the Queso Fundido : Chorizo, Gouda, and Menonita Cheese. Super cheesy mix, with tons of oil and fat...just like chorizo should be! It was almost too cheesy actually, with it being super stringy and a little difficult pulling apart! But that's what friends are for...to help you with your cheese!

Even the complimentary salsa and chips are great, and bottomless if you enjoy them as much as us! 

Prices seem a bit steep at first, but the quality of ingredients, taste, and portions make it worth it.  Wish the portions were smaller with more reasonable prices to reflect that...ie a burrito at half the size, but around the $10 mark vs $15.

For starters the owners are wonderful people.  The food is absolutely spot on every time flawless and as authentic as you can get.  Nothing on the strip or anywhere else in Vegas comes close.  I travel to San Diego for business and I visit a section of the city called old town. It's filled with Mexican restaurants and cafes and none of them come close to this.  How sad to be so close to the Mexican boarder yet we have better Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Try this place once and you'll be addicted just as I have been since the day they opened.,dXMcoSlV2sYvNZz__smM0g,0,0,5,qsrVNV0Z8WGHd6mdvSImzw

All he received was a tablespoon of guacamole and when he asked if he could get a little more we joked about how he better not be charged for the additional tablespoon sized guacamole they brought to the table yet we were charged $2.50 which was ridiculous. Only saving grace to my disappointment was the two child plates. We ordered a child chicken enchilada meal and a child beef taco meal.

Anyways, more about Leticia's: the food is eclectic; however sometimes the basic ingredient of salt is missed and the food comes out a bit bland. The flavor aspect, especially from a Mexican restaurant is missing. Additionally, the prices are pretty exorbitantly high for the quality of taste that has dwindled over the years. Their Happy Hour makes me want to cry, *whispers* It's expensive, too! Honestly, I have come to the conclusion that Leticia's survives as well as it does partly because of it's location. It sits in an upper middle class neighborhood within the upper middle class part of NW Vegas. It's also the most authentic Mexican restaurant for miles---of anyone says Lindo Michoacan is authentic, I'm going to remind them of their cheesy and stereotypical atmosphere, their bland food and their salsa that tastes like a rip off of Heinz Ketchup. Also, I think Leticia's survives so well is also because of their puffy tacos and green salsa; yes, I'm dead serious. They have this amazing green citrusy/avocado salsa that craves the attention of most pregnant women, tacos lovers and salsa fanatics. Anyways, Leticia's will always have a place in my heart, especially because I live 2 minutes away not the NW Valley , but I will now drive 40 minutes to Juan's for my Mexican food infatuation",PS0efv5ppyUgJkoW3VQf4w,0,0,4,Bf2HF3LC7VdA6hfDImBfFg

We just moved to the area and don't know our neighbors well enough to ask for any suggestions.  It has been hit or miss when it comes to the ratings on Yelp for more than one place since moving to LV.  I will say our visit to Leticia's was a HIT!

We took our two kids with us and had a little bit of a wait to be seated but it was no more than 10 minutes.  We sat in a booth right next to the kitchen so we could smell the food.  We were brought chips, beans and 2 salsas and asked for our drink orders.  My kids ordered sodas while my husband had a Blue Moon and I had a blended strawberry margarita.  We dug into the chips, beans and salsa.  I enjoyed the tomatillo salsa while my husband liked the red salsa and we both loved the beans.  The children ordered off the kids menu; my son had a bean and cheese burrito that came with beans and rice while my daughter ordered a hard ground beef taco which also came with beans and rice but she only wanted the rice.  My husband ordered the street taco platter which offered 3 street tacos with choice of carne asada, al pastor, carnitas or chicken.  He had 2 carnitas and 1 carne asada served with rice and beans.  I ordered the Ensenada taco platter which offered two tacos of your choice of fish or shrimp which I had one of each.

The food arrived fresh, hot and quick.  My husband devoured his taco platter leaving nothing behind.  I would say he enjoyed it!  My son ate all of his burrito and brought his beans and rice home.  My daughter only ate her rice and have of her taco because she was so full.  I only ate the fish taco and a small portion of my rice and beans.  We packed up our leftovers in their to go boxes, which are great and will reuse them!  All in all, our total bill was just under $60 for the 4 of us without the tip.

Pros:
1. Nice variety of offerings on the menu
2.  Chips, salsa and beans.
3. Portion size.

Cons:
1. When my daughter asked for no beans, I asked if they could give her double rice instead.  The kitchen didn't do that.  It wasn't worth sending back for more.
2. Parking- it's a little strange.  There is a parking lot behind/next to the restaurant but it seems odd.

I was losing hope until Leticia's came along. This Mexican Cocina has got it going on! I love the vibe and decor of the restaurant. My first visit was on a Friday night and boy was it packed to the brim in there! The wait was about 40 minutes. If you come during prime time, be prepared to wait a while.

Complimentary chips and salsa are pretty good. I really like the chips. They're warm and super fresh. Vegetarians be warned! The bean dip has chorizo in it. My husband can't get enough of that bean dip. The chorizo gives it an unexpected sweet taste. 

The menu is hefty and prices are a little higher than you're average Mexican restaurant. I was ecstatic to learn that Leticia's had potato and cheese flautas ($13.98). Whhaaa! I'm all about that vegetarian flauta life! The entree comes with 3 flautas and a side of rice and beans. The flautas are topped with guacamole, pico, and authentic Mexican queso (the tasty white crumbly cheese). This entree is way too much food for me, but I do my best to eat all I can, savoring every bite!

The Mexican rice here is where it's at it. I am particularly picky when it comes to Mexican rice. The Mexican rice at Leticia's, however, reminds me of the rice my mom and grandma make. I get all nostalgic eating that stuff! 

Service could be better, but it's sufficient.  

In a nutshell:
Food: 5
Ambiance: 4
Service: 3-4

Of course I'll be back! This is the only legit Mexican restaurant I've come across in Vegas.

I am latino myself, so let me start by letting you know the extent of knowledge of GOOD, homemade latin foods (I am Spanish, with Mexican, Columbian, and Guatemalan relatives). My wife, 2 kids, and myself visited the restaurant after just moving to this side of town, in search of a place comparable to Viva Zapata's (North east Vegas), and we found Leticia's and gave them a try. The bean dip was plain, but the salsas were good, although for a family of 4, they really should increase the amount chips they give. We started with the grilled corn, which was good, but you really can't mess up an easy classic like that. My kids ordered the bean and cheese burrito (my son added the asada steak to his), my wife orded the Chile Relleno with an enchilada, and I ordered the Cecina A La Tampiquea. My son was disappointed to find out that they did not ADD the asada to his burrito, but instead, made it a burrito with ONLY ASADA. My son is a big fan of refried beans, so that literally ruined his appetite, seeing as he had to eat chips until they fixed his order (15 min. later). My wive's look on her face after taking a bite out of her chile relleno tipped me off. It was GROSS! Under cooked batter with ABSOLUTELY no seasoning! MY wife had to scrape the batter off to eat it, and worst of all, when I asked management about it, they said they got too many complaints about it being to ""egg-e,"" so they had to change it; awful. The worst part of all, was the sauce! The sauce they add to the Chile Relleno was, without a doubt, plain tomato sauce from a can. There is NO mistaking it, that was NOT a salsa Colorado. My steak with mushrooms, bacon, and cheese was good; under-seasoned, but good. My issue with my plate was, WHAT MEXICAN STEAK IS COVERED IN MUSHROOMS, BACON, AND ONIONS??????? Great if this was a steak house, but that's not what this place is. The enchilada that is paired with it was bad. The tortilla they used for the enchilada was far too thick, over-cooked, and taste-less. What really ruined it all, in the end, was the customer service. After complaining to management about all those issues, all they told me was about all the praise they get from their clientele, and looked at me like I was nuts. Seeing as I was the ONLY latino there, was that a hate crime? Anyhow,

In conclusion: bland, un-traditional, non-clever, and SEVERLY overpriced ""Mexican"" food.
Save money, and go down the street to Roberto's or Chipotle. They may not be the best, but on this side of town, they're much better.",ZrFCMgeX15e6H_XRFWsKCA,0,0,1,Mav8OiLJhPdZ8kHN6rY9oQ

But went this past weekend with my daughters and when they brought our food, rice/beans were a bit cold but the tacos were pretty warms all our plates.  I noticed the rice and beans was cooked and left for awhile in their pots. I'm a cook I know. So, you need to get your money's worth, my daughter paid for the dinner,  I am teaching her that your paying for this food, don't ever accept what it is.  Your a customer and food needs to be hot and cooked well.   So I asked the waiters about it and they were very understandable did take it back and gave us a whole new hot plate of food.  It looked fresh.  But there are no excuses to ever bring your customer a cold plate. I didn't get that.  That's my point. I hope that when I go there again it doesn't happen.  If it does I will walk out and not come back.  It's a shame because it's really a nice place to enjoy your food and great atmosphere.",36Qy6Gk9apXUgT6lJ1BKhQ,2,2,2,MaQU-pVHMyTOHEs9meEfGA

Today, however, closed the deal for me not to give this restaurant my business. We wanted to celebrate a going away party so I called for a reservation for 10. The hostess was ok but from the get go gave me the impression that she was not happy with reserving for a party that size. After putting me on hold and asking the manager she told me that they would have to have a $150 deposit which would be not refunded if I do not cancel at least 2 hours earlier or if at least 75% of my party doesn't show up. That would mean that if 2 people cancel last minute, not only they would get the revenue of 7 people, but they would get an extra $150. Since when are local restaurants turning into airlines??

Regardless I said ok here is my Amex and exp, but then they wanted my security code. Say what??? For a reservation guarantee?

I told them that if they are adamant about getting my code I will take my business elsewhere and their answer was ok, I am sorry.

Their Mexican corn was a fantastic little surprise that I never see on most other menus.  Whatever you do, DO NOT order a bloody mary here.  This was without a doubt the worst bloody mary I've ever ordered.  They politely agreed to swap me out for a beer when I explained the predicament.

1. I am a San Diego native transplant to Vegas: anyone who has ever been or lived in San Diego knows what ""Real"" mexican food tastes like.
2. I am a super picky meat eater. Can not have bones, fat or Gristle...make me gag!
3. LOVE MEXICAN FOOD!!!
With that being said...Leticias is heaven sent! 
We have been searching for a Mexican restaurant that is worth the money, not americanized, and tastes like it was made with love!
The way for me to tell if is going to be good is at the very beginning with the chips and salsa...which at Leticias are always fresh and the salsa is flavorful with a hint of spice. They also serve them with a bean dip that must have chorizo in them...DELICIOUS!!!!  Which brings me to the next most important items...Beans and rice!!!  When I order my favorite dish here my rice is a casserole! White rice, cheese and chilies...OMG...delicious...just the right amount of chilies and cheesy goodness! I have the shrimp Quesa  tacos, medium heat!  My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Packed full of shrimp, melted cheese and the flavor...wow..I have tried them spicy also...and I like spicy usually ...but medium for me was perfect. My man orders the Mojcaete...a hot bowl with ranchera sauce, shrimp, queso, carne asada and cactus...served with rice and beans and tortillas...it is a huge bowl of yummy goodness and you can't get any more authentic than this dish!!! We have been several times...NEVER left unhappy. ALWAYS delicious. We have tried other dishes...but now we go for these 2 dishes! Well worth the drive and every single dollar we spend.

The salsa brought with chips when you are seated ( and you server acknowledges your existence) its so delicious it makes it a little hard to write this review. We had to ask the busser to take our drink order, then about 10 mins later we had to ask him to have someone come take out order. With a 3 yr old and 1 yr old in our party it was getting ridiculous. Our busser (great young guy) hurried around the restaurant doing as much as he could for several tables I saw the servers standing off to the side talking. As we waited for our food another patron was up front complaining she had only seen her server once and was NOT happy about her service. One of our water cups was dirty and when the guy came around to refill it was with carbonated water and had to give us all new water (no biggie) the food FINALLY came and the kids were beyond starving (took about 30 mins) I could understand if the place was busy but there were 4/5 tables max... The food was a little cold but tasted great. The place is clean and the decor is very nice. The music and the salsa were my favorite part. We left a nice tip (for the busser) it's sad to think this kid worked as hard as he did for a woman whom we interacted with twice to get the tip.. I'm not sure the salsa is enough to bring us back.

Food is good so I can't knock them on that, but the service by Saul is some of the worst. I've been in the restaurant business for over 20 years and this guy might be one of the worst servers I have ever encountered. He is a disgrace to people in the industry. All he does is smile like an idiot to your face, because he is clearly overwhelmed all of the time. He went from a buss boy to a server which was a poor decision on behalf of management, but even worse is that they keep him in a position that he will never succeed at. What makes me most upset about this place is the lack of management or ownership presence. The restaurant appears to always be busy, and it's because it takes and hour and a half for a three top to get entrees only. Pathetic!  
They truly need the help of a good consultant to go in and show them how to be operators of their business since it's clear that they are not capable of managing this place themselves. It is currently doing good volume, but if another place in the area opens up that is decent I don't think this place will make it which is sad. The lack of ownership presence on the floor shows they have no respect or appreciation for the customer. Good restauranteurs are involved in their business during peak times so they can evaluate what the business needs to improve on. It's clear they aren't watching their social media reviews which are done by customers taking time out of their busy day to tell them either what they are doing well or what they need to improve on. 7-12-16

Update: After this review was posted the GM emailed me with a response to how things were handled. I appreciate the fact that they take reviews seriously, and the importance of customer feedback. Great job! I had to raise my review from a 1 star to  a four star, because they do have great food and that's the reason most people go out to eat. 

First review:
I frequent this place a couple times per month because the carnitas are very good. 
My last few experiences have been less than stellar. Customer service has fallen off drastically, and there is no management presence so the staff does whatever they want. Nobody has ever come back to ask how everything is and if they can get anything else before they bring the bill. The last time I was in which was yesterday the very inexperienced server rang in both orders incorrectly and when we finally had to track him down it took another 25 minutes to get one carnitas taco. How it takes 25 minutes to put pre cooked meat on a flour tortilla with some onion and cilantro is mind blowing. There was no manager to complain to. It took an hour and a half for two people to eat which makes it clear why it always looks busy in there because they don't turn tables very fast.

Last night we went and the hostess told us it'd be an hour wait unless we want to sit in the building adjacent to the restaurant.  We figured why not?

It took almost 2.5 hours to eat dinner.  I was miserable. 
We were forgotten about for long stretches. Had to ask for things three or four times. 
Every other time I've been there I was brought chips, a green salsa, a brown salsa, and bean dip.  No bean dip last night.  And three empty baskets of chips for 14 people. Cups sitting empty. Waitress made no effort to remember who ordered what so when the food was delivered she was just holding it and shouting what it was and you had to speak up if it was your's. 
I got the quesa tacos and they were bad.  The shrimp were missing from them and they were dripping grease and the cheese was burnt. Waitress completely forgot my cup of fideo soup and about 10 minutes after I reminded her about it she brought out a stone-cold BOWL of fideo soup.  I just pushed it away.

You come hungry and leave happy and full. Not only are the award winning tacos they offer award winning but you get some extremely good chips and salsa. Don't forget the several flavors of salsa (and even yummy dipping refried beans too) they offer and definitely try the amazing guacamole. The guacamole isn't just a little bowl of green mash either, it is a flavorful mix of chunks of perfectly ripe avocados, tomatoes, etc.., and even some incredible fresh Mexican cheese that adds that perfect touch to finish off the guacamole perfection that it is.

The chips salsa and refried bean appetizer was delicious but might not be touched on my next trip. Will want to save room for that Pork Chop.

Their salsa is a mild salsa with great flavor. For those looking for something a little more spicy ask for a habanero salsa dish to be brought out with the nachos. It was hot and had great fresh flavor. I couldn't tell if was from a can or not as my coworkers and I made that dish disappeared in less than five minutes but I'd guess freshly made.

The Staff was amazing and had a lot of personality as they interacted with my group of seven. One even went so far as to call me a Gringo for ordering flour tortillas. Was not expecting that and I played along making it an ongoing joke throughout the meal.

It's located in a beautiful area (super far from my house) in north town. I was surprised! The outside atmosphere looked like a really nice place to sit outside. It was really hot weather at the time so we went inside and got greeted right away from two beautiful ladies! We were seated immediately at a booth. It's really authentic looking decor. Lots of awesome designs and fun things to look at all around the room. Our booth was kinda small for the three of us, but we managed. The two waiters we had were super nice! They spoke in spanish (and my friend spoke spanish as well since he worked in Chile the past two years) so it was pretty awesome to watch! I love mexican food! They started us off with a bowl of chips with two different salsas and beans. They even refilled it if we ever wanted some more! Now time for the hard part. Choosing what to eat. The menu is filled with so many options!

I decided to go with the lunch specials. There were a bunch you could choose from, and I got the burrito lunch special enchilada style with verde sauce on top. It came with lettuce, tomato, beans, and mexican rice. Boy was it super yummy! The burrito was smothered in sauce and cheese. I had to use cholula sauce to add a bit of flavor.

The bar area does have gaming, and there is a separate restaurant side as well.

We sat down and were immediately brought water, chips, and 3 dip options: bean dip, a smoky mild salsa, and a very cilantro-y smooth guacamole. All were very good, and the chips were fresh. Our server Saul came to take our beverage order (2 Dos Equis), and then disappeared for at least ten minutes, if not 15. When he came back, he had no beer, ran to the bar, came back and said they were out of Dos Equis.... Not okay with that delay, or paying for the Pacifico that I didn't really want. Anyway, the service got a little better from here on out, except that when my mother ordered her chicken enchiladas, he tried to push a different style chicken on her, which was very awkward.

I consider myself quite the connoisseur of cheese enchiladas, so of course this is what I ordered. They were very good, not the best I've had, but very good.

Any Chef that will take the time to do the bussers work, and then wash up to do a special request and personally deliver it to the table to make sure I am satisfied, gets my vote. Try the house specialty, or the Huevos Ranchero",vQuBoD6ewkCPt1i_vKh1Kg,0,0,5,Odisf--bcB64efrBVDlTOw

It started out quite well with tasty salsa and bean dip but the goodness ended there.  My husband and I ordered the chicken fajitas.  Ugh!!! Worst fajitas ever!!  They arrived on the usual black grill plate only they weren't steaming....lukewarm at best in a soupy juice of zucchini and tiny little bits of ""cooked chicken"" not even grilled.  It reminded me of the chicken you get in chow mein.  There was absolutely no Mexican flavor.  We were so disappointed and will not be returning.",ow8I1Qxh3uI6I1zf2JQNjQ,0,0,1,LCDA2AVdXMe3khqTM7RyXA
