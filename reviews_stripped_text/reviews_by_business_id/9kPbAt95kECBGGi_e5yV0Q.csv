The food itself is terrific. I.have tried everything from steak, salmon, bison, chicken, ground meat and turkey and all are grade A.

So the last time I visited I looked up healthy meal delivery in Las Vegas and found Modern Proteins. They delivered directly to my hotel in individual microwaveable packages. They included really fresh, delicious sides like avocado and roasted salsa. The proteins were cooked perfectly and it ended up costing me a quarter of the price to eat their food during my stay. I'm very particular when it comes to organic food and I was impressed with the high quality. Thank you for amazing service and healthy meals delivered!

I can't wait for lunch, I think I'll try the tilapia, or maybe, the ground turkey.  All the entrees look awesome. What is even cooler is since the meals are gluten free, my teenager can eat them too. I can't wait to try the other meals. I was worried 21 meals wouldn't fit in my fridge (as so much is dedicated to others, but all the meals fit on a little more than one small shelf.

I used to cook professionally and am quite critical when eating out but I was pleasantly surprised when my first delivery arrived. Food is well prepared and flavorful. Meats are par cooked just right and after heating is not overcooked or dry whatsoever. Variety in the menus is good. 

Modern Proteins has a better choice of options than other services I have had experience with. Their desserts make a great addition to the meals, helping me to stay focused on my fitness goals and avoiding falling off course. 

I have eaten a few meals on the go when I had no means to heat and I suggest you cook the meals prior to leaving for the day so that it will be fully cooked, again only necessary if you have no method to heat for lunch.

Having had an opportunity to compare to other meal delivery services. The quality of Modern Proteins meals is above the rest. If you are looking for help in achieving your fitness/health goals don't hesitate to sign up for one of their meal plans.",NjfDwQbLJHShQem6GZJ7LQ,2,0,5,55pNxOXGBdOtUdgLLb8kLg

As a busy nurse, it's hard for me to find the time and motivation to prep meals and keep it clean.  Modern Proteins takes away all the guesswork.  Personally I get 2 meals out of 1 meal because I try to eat every few hours to keep my metabolism going.  The egg scramble, turkey, ground beef, and ground bison are my favorite.  They have the perfect combinations of protein, carbs, and fat.  They also have the perfect flavor and texture combos that keep me satisfied and full.  The nutella protein brownies are a perfect snack, or a great breakfast on the go that is super quick and easy and very filling.  The delivery drivers are always right on time.  The owner, Adam, gets back to you quickly with any questions.

1724901,2018-01-25,0,9kPbAt95kECBGGi_e5yV0Q,"I love everything about this! I am traveling for work and this saves time and money and prevents me from overindulging in restaurant food. I was so impressed with the variety of foods....and grateful too because I am pretty indecisive! I ordered the Modern Proteins Classic Weekly which comes with 14 meals and 7 appetizers/snacks. There's a 20% discount on all meal plans right now (code 20MPOFF) so it came to $206.97 which is $14.78 per meal--I used mine for lunch and dinner. There were 2 of each protein (5 oz lean oven baked): chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, bison, steak, salmon, and tilapia. Green veggies (3 oz) in each included perfectly flash-steamed asparagus, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, squash, etc., and whole carbohydrates (3 oz). I feel so great eating healthy balanced meals! They taste delicious (the one I got included gourmet toppings including things like cherries, cranberries, nuts, pesto). I have already reordered the 21-meal plan for the next 2 weeks of travel and will also be trying the red velvet protein cake, Nutella protein brownie, and banana nut protein bar. AND THEY DELIVER TO HOTELS!!! The entire order came packaged in a box with the individual FRESH meals in microwave and freezer safe plastic containers with labels on exactly what was in each one. It was beautiful and just made my heart happy to see such organization and standardization!! I am staying in a condo with a full kitchen so make sure you have access to a refrigerator (and freezer if you won't be eating within 5 days). So if you want a healthy option that is super convenient and saves time and money this is MUST TRY!!",23lK9BdzvH3p4td2Z-e-vA,1,1,5,jB1V_ZlUxce1S50eBinI3A

First things first, their gorgeous, easy navigation website. With tabs like ""What's Inside a Meal?"" and ""Delivery Process,"" I was able to gather all of the information I needed on what expectations to have regarding service as well as any concerns I had in mind about quality of food. And, I will say, I was pleasantly surprised with one piece of information in particular: during high season, I should expect to receive my delivery at least 30-60 early. Wow!!

Without further-a-do, I immediately began to place my order online. The selection was huge, and I was happy to see that the prices were fair. Here's a tip: You can find ALL of their options ranging from individual items to full-out diet plans by simply clicking the ""Click To Order"" tab.

Finally, the best part of all was the delivery. I was greeted on-time by the owner herself at my doorstep and welcomed to Modern Proteins. So sweet! I found Mina to be professional and friendly, and was invited to connect with her via email about further ways to tailor my diet according to my needs. The food was INCREDIBLE!! My body feels good and I feel like I have the right amount energy to carry out my day.

Not only that, but the meals are prepped in conjunction with my needs. I don't have the time to prepare my meals and for them to be able to make what I need and it actually taste good is amazing. I need specific portions of different types of lean proteins, non-starchy & starchy carbs, and fats so not just anybody can prepare my food.

3335489,2017-09-05,0,9kPbAt95kECBGGi_e5yV0Q,"With a schedule that was prohibitive of consistent meal-planning, I decided to give Modern Proteins a try. The only problem I had with my initial order, was that it was delivered half an hour after my requested delivery window. Not really a big deal, still there with plenty of time for me to get to work.

My most recent order, however, has been a complete nightmare. At 8:15 AM, there was no sign of my delivery, nor was there at 10:15, or at noon. I saw a couple of boxes on my neighbors porch, but I'm not through type and I don't go through other peoples mail. It turns out I should have. Mina finally got back to me, and said that the delivery driver told her that the packages have been delivered. I replied back, that there was nothing on my front porch and that had been home since 6 AM to see nothing delivered eight hours later. She then replied to me and said that her delivery driver returned and confirmed that the boxes were there, this time with a picture. By no coincidence, there was some shuffling outside of my door about five minutes prior but unfortunately I was in the bathroom and couldn't catch the delivery driver in the act. I attempted to call no less than two dozen times, but the number is automated and no one ever actually picks up. So I drove to the address listed on Google and on their website, only to find out that they haven't been there for sometime. Naturally, I have not received a reply by email since I informed Mina of the situation, and I am now left with a weeks worth of spoiled food that is ineligible for return.",lFXOrGCIXToVsz0A5N-Itg,0,0,1,hYFjjJtaUWcDURhTLEazAA
