Their mobile ordering kiosks are a great idea but they don't have them programmed with enough options to order things other than the basics- so if you have specific requests, you must order at the cashier- however, they have placed all 4 areas (2 kiosks, pick-ups and cashier ordering) within 120 sq ft space, with the drink machine lines also bleeding into these other spaces... bad circulation and space planning.

I am sure the employees of McDonalds are swimming in their largesse because of your extreme generosity in their enormous pay.
