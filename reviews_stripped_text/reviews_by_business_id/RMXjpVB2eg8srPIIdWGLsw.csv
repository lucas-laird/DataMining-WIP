Macaroni & Cheese is my favorite side dish...the one here is delicious! I'd make the drive for this when my mac & cheese craving kicks in. 

My husband is particular about his chicken wings and this place nails them! They're dipped in flour & fried just the way he likes them. 

My daughter eats pretty healthy so she wanted a salad. They have a couple on the menu but she asked if they had a Caesar and they made it for her with no problem. A Steak & Shrimp Caesar, she was in heaven! 

The food here matches the service. They're friendly and attentive. I recommend this cafe for anyone looking for some good soul food! Or good food period.",yBzF3oQa2nJsqoEJb5Q0ag,2,1,5,oF7V-LDVGVmUVaxKP6CUeQ

1309277,2017-05-15,0,RMXjpVB2eg8srPIIdWGLsw,The owner James is super pleasant and passionate about his cooking. This is my 3rd time eating at this restaurant and each time I have been amazed by his food and customer service. For this to be a new restaurant it's running quite smoothly just need to tweak a few things and iron out a few simple things. I would definitely recommend this place to others.,pDHlIXGxjxPnmQ-qXvRTrg,1,1,5,6Mz3i7PejDEzHfVi4W_blQ

Down home cooking, no frills. 

I had the meatloaf, which came with a side of mashed potatoes, collard greens, and saut√©ed vegetables. 

I'd have liked the slice of meatloaf to have been a bit larger, but it was very tasty and there were ample amount of sides, which were all fresh. 

I want to go go back and try the catfish next!",7lqsdymCX4ko09XyQ3_tcg,1,0,4,Hp9zC-XNFjRNRWv37fsJuQ

My wife & I reviewed the menu and ordered Shrimp & Grits + Catfish Dinner. The chefs took their time preparing our meals. The presentation of the food was done well. Our food came out nice and hot. It was seasoned to our liking and the portion sizes we're great. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Taste My Love restaurant! Can't wait to try some more of there dishes.",gUa--yI_AClUqIWlJ06ABw,0,0,5,h_th6oCGRxGkT5xIaQnOhA

There was a miscommunication and my son didn't get his food but the owner worked to correct the problem.  The shrimp and grits was flavorful and the hash browns were good too. The chicken tenders and fries was a good meal for my growing nephew, it was only sauce left on the plate. Overall a good experience with good food.",0E0LXEGSmTjqciyHQWcfxQ,1,0,4,6jqjDJWUwQAIWrpp_2pkaw

We also tried there twist on nachos, it had shrimp and chicken on it with house made fresh tortilla chips. And while I was there you know I had to try the grits and I was not disappointed! If you want great food and to try something new stop by and give them a try.",c0E2BGqNX1CNZNVj9t0RkQ,1,0,5,nXKp9eJL2BddfYVioWtbtw
