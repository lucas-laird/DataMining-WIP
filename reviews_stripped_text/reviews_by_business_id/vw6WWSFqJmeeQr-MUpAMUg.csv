My brother took me here once and I just kinda disregarded it bc I figured LV wouldnt compare to SD... how wrong I was... Had it one time, and literally, FEINED for it while I was back in SD (got some as soon as got back to LV!) 

I always get the adobada burrito and have them add french fries to it (the lengua burrito is really good too... thats beef tongue for all you people who dont know wassup) ... They have a great salsa bar with green and red salsa, lots of lime, green onions, and the pickled carrots/jalapenos... I like to mix 1:1 of the green and red salsa... so delish....

Not sure this place is worth the trip if youre staying on the strip, but if youre nearby and want a good burrito at a reasonable price, this place is worth it!",axVPY6SHM5eeaWHKeb5vhg,2,0,5,Bgfstux18wdJQ-qh21OITg

I asked for a refund and the lady got all defensive, she said you opened it, I said it doesn't matter you can't sell it to anyone else anyway. Then there were more customers in the place so she relented and gave me my money back. I just went to Lauritas it's so much better, hell even Roberto's is better than Don Tortaco and they are ridiculous with their lame ass no substitutions rule.

Virtually nothing at all. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out the owners of the two similar franchises were siblings just competing against each other.
They use practically the same ingredients and all the foods taste/look/seem the same, just claimed by a different franchise tag.

Blindfold me and bring carne asada fries from each place and I won't be able to tell you the difference. Just like Roberto's, Tortaco's meats are mediocre. Way too grilled and doesn't even take like authentic carne asada. I'm not Mexican but I lived on Mexican food so I know what my asada and pastor tastes like~

Grand opening special $3.99 for either their grilled steak or grilled chicken plate which comes with beans and rice, dirt cheap. Best part is that I don't have to wait for midnight, when Coronado Cafe at South Point offers their cheap steak and egg special, Don Tortaco is 24/7 and right around the corner from South Point.  I'm hoping this location keeps this $3.99 special up for a few months just like the other locations did, it's usually $6 and some change.

My order was ready quickly and I walked out the door. When I got home and opened the styrofoam box I noticed the tacos were on a hard shell. Grrrrrr!

The downside to this place is that it's really, really inconsistent in terms of pricing and the way the food is made.  If you want rice and beans in your burrito, some people charge you $0.55 each, and some people charge you $2.00 (the combo price).  And the amount of extras is always different.  Sometimes it's like a tablespoon, other times it's overflowing.  It's all just really inconsistent.  So if you like to order the same thing and expect to get that same thing every time, this is not a place for you.

Also--the service here is always crappy.  I wouldn't expect much from a place like this, but I feel like it needs to be said.  The cashiers are usually pretty unfriendly.",BgF9Iy2wKPLYAcU-1Kfq_w,3,1,2,Au9gmi8UDBwvXMjvP4859A

The service here is very good with the staff greeting customers as they enter the door. While I was ordering the cashier made eye contact with me and continued this throughout the order process. She repeated the order back too for accuracy. When I did finally receive the food it did take the cooks about ten minutes, but I was in no hurry. The pursuit of greatness cannot be rushed so, if one has the time I say let them put that extra love into your food.

I ordered one of there many combos; the number six which is a Beef Burrito and Cheese Enchilada. Also ordered four tacos al a carte that were beef and cheese. The beef and cheese tacos were very delicious and they had mass amounts of cheese. The beef was delicious with just the perfect flavors and seasonings. The cheese enchilada was my favorite with the sauce being so rich and yummy. Plus the abundance of sauce covering the enchilada is wonderful to dip the beef tacos in.

Quesadilla is one of the best I've had in Vegas.  Very cheesy and very buttery.  The tortilla could be more flakey though.

The carne asada was good, cut into small pieces for easy eating in a burrito or quesadilla.  I had a California burrito that was great and reminded me of my favorite place in San Diego. Portions were good sized also.

I think the salsa/hot sauce makes or breaks a small Mexican restaurant like this one and the salsa here was very good.  There was a salsa bar with veggies and multiple sauces.

This is your go-to place when there's little to no options at night giving you good food at a reasonable time with a reasonable price... For Mexican food. My four stars is strictly based on my usual order: rolled tacos, regular tacos, carne asada fries/nachos and quesadillas.

The meat quality in the tacos was very poor and bland, the cilantro/tomato and other veggies inside the taco tasted like they were left in room temperature. The lack of fresh veggies and grade F meat combined for a mediocre taco at best. 

The breakfast burrito which consisted of steak, cheese, and eggs also disappointed on the same level as the tacos. The taste was extremely bland and the steak had qualities more align with rubber than it did beef. One pro is the size of the burrito which was bigger than a burrito from chipotle. Although, it's a bit ironic because who wants to eat more of something they don't enjoy...

This would be a 1 star review but it is 2 because of the good service that was provided by the single man running the entire place. The order also came out surprisingly quick given that one man ran the register and prepared the food.

I don't know what happened to this place.

I got to 3 different Don Tortacos...So i know when something is off or bad. So far the other locations make GOOD food and have GOOD service. This one is laking in BOTH.

Todays event is was what made we write this. 
Went there around 2:30. Ordered some food. 
When I got home and took everything out of the bag, there was a CLOUDY GREEN puddle of liquid at the bottom..  The one burrito was saturated with so much of the liquid that the wrapping paper would not come off. It was MELTED on to it.
I was so pissed I had to drive all the way back, leaving my guest to wait for me to eat.

I figured the girl in the front counter would offer something different, but when I showed her the smothered wet burrito her reply was "" oh thats the cheese."" 
Really? 
Your cheese is green and wet and drips from the burritos? Fantastic!... Not really.

She didn't offer another substitute, she didn't even offer to help, or suggest to make something else. 

I just asked for my money back. I didn't want anything anyways. Not from this place ever again.... The DIY salsa bar had rotten radishes in it, so rotten they were curling. The limes were brown as well... They seem to not care about anything here.
Their guacamole was slimy and watered down. The worst Don Tortaco in Vegas.

My boyfriend came here before and had the same experience ,when one of his items was left out of his to go bag. She forgot to put it in his order, he has to sit and wait while everyone else got their food, till his one item was done that she forgot. He was the first customer there and last to leave.
