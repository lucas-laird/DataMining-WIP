Of course my mind went far left... Fast forward... We loved the Catfish and the Mac and Cheese dinner, the Collards were seasoned perfectly. We loved it. We went back the following weekend and tried some Hot Tamales and they were the best we've had since we left Mississippi.... ignore the side chic and enjoy your meal",I0jUnxr_hjdagw9KEh1buw,2,1,5,337RBaY5x6Y9pS0mJgr-bw

I got the catfish (which was amazing), the Mac and cheese and the greens. I almost cried after the first bite of greens because they tasted just like my Great aunt's that passed away last year. So good and felt like home! Will definitely be back.",6FWLtLbbjIRA-jzYukQMiA,2,1,5,SZW1y6hXaW6u1jNM9uLxfg

After a couple recommendations fell through I searched on Yelp for spots in the area.  How happy was I to find Side Chix.

Pros: Let's start at the most important: the food.  Maaaaaaaaan, look here.  Every single thing I ate/drank was jam good!  The catfish was hot and savory as were my sides.  To drink, red Kool Aid!  And let me tell you, it was that ""half a bag of sugar, spoon stands straight up in the pitcher"" Kool Aid!  Oooooooooh weeeeeeeeee!  Exactly what you want to wash down some tasty vittles!

Cons: I don't wanna talk bad about this spot, but it did take a while for the foos to come.  That said, there were 5 in my group.  Also, after a certain hour all orders are to go only.  Lastly, they didn't have the caramel cake!!!  (... I bet it was good too!!)

All in all, a place I will definitely patronize should my travels bring me back to Vegas.",FUATJ1-OxWwhjIDi3YdVvg,0,0,4,leobtZOirIwbp1mAcBMAuA

The cornbread went from being like your granny used to make to jiffy muffins per owner. Chicken wing dinner- one wing was bloody had to finish cooking it. BUT catfish, greens, mac/cheese, potato salad were good. Won't b ordering chicken again. Homemade lemonade was good.",zktBB8eXj2AkzHOo-B0XoA,2,0,2,aNngH-b5ik3n55V2eAX4Uw

The seasoning is wonderful and their seasoned fries are delightful. Be sure to try the catfish also. The Louisiana style seasoning is perfection. They even have cool-aid as a beverage option!

They have five or six lunch specials and the prices are awesome for the amount of food you get. The customer service is great too. Definitely coming back!",Ou5obbkoCSZcZIt8Jku4Bw,2,2,5,13Vp9_kQi2Mea60dAbB7DQ

Everything from fried chicken, catfish, ribs and the sides are to die for. You have to make the trip. It is not any kind of fancy. The staff is both courteous and friendly. It is worth the journey. I have stayed away from the deserts only because I am attempting to be moderate and the food here is not made for moderation. All my friends just love the caramel cake.

4886889,2017-06-21,0,sVr_5-H0emPH9BcCiwG8xA,"So we found this location here on Yelp as a quick last minute thing bc the original location we were going to go to ...their credit card machine was down.  SO i didn't even have a chance to read the reviews.  

There was 3 of us grabbing lunch on our 1/2 hr lunch break.  First when we got there, it wasn't busy at all.  So we figured this would be a fast pickup. ...but that wasn't the case.

We were helped by the cashier Ivan.  Nice young, polite gentlemen.  he is the reason i gave it 2 stars, because i would have gave it 1.   I was the last to order yet the first to get my food.  

I ordered the Meatball Special for $5.99. It comes with a side and BBQ dipping sauce.  I was expecting at least a mini fist sized meatball ( as that is what i am used to).  In any case, when i got my food, the meatball was really, really small. We didn't eat until we got back to the office.(45 minutes LATER!)  When i finally ate it however, it was dry and still red in the middle. (picture should be posted)then the Mac-n-cheese wasn't as flavorful as it should be nor was the collard greens.  when it comes to collard greens, i expect the bitter bite with the ham-hocks and the true down south flavors.  I am praying this wasn't from the can-but i don't know.  i couldn't see in the back where the kitchen was.  I completely lost my appetite and didn't even finish my plate.  

My co-workers ended up getting the chicken wings which too were small.  But they said that was good.  I tried one and i was over it.  i  am spoiled when it comes to food.  This was way below my expectations and i am sorry for rating it so low.  Other than that, like i said..Ivan was nice and polite.",Jl1zWNk5i3AwGVN1AacaUQ,6,0,2,mg9LUJmei-lcL2ObGvkB9Q

After an impromptu detour down Martin Luther King Blvd this evening I noticed Side Chix Cafe saucy sign from the street and decided to pull in for some southern eats.

I'm living a Pescatarian friendly lifestyle so I opted for the 10 Jumbo Shrimp (they are huge by the way) and some cake cake cake cake... I'm a dessert first kind of girl.

The Jumbo Shrimp were seasoned to perfection and a nice golden brown which I appreciated as I devoured six by my self before sharing. 
*** Highly Recommended Item ***

Regrettably, no photos of the Carmel cake because It didn't make it out of the parking lot LOL. The icing was the right amount of sweet. Definitely homemade and equally delicious. 

I couldn't help but ask the gentleman at the counter about the name concept and he shared a short story about the vision. I'll leave that to the inquiring minds bold enough to ask management. Lol! 

(10) Piece Jumbo Shrimp $15.99
(1) Carmel Cake Slice $3.00
(1) Lemon Cake Slice $3.00
Total: $23.80

Of course I'll be back (for some side-fish)",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,5,5,5,0hoNceO-4_5_GBasM-5sLg
5216790,2017-05-24,0,sVr_5-H0emPH9BcCiwG8xA,"Oh wow! This truly IS the best catfish in town!
I've eaten here in their spacious restaurant, as well as had take out many times. I have never EVER been disappointed!
The catfish is so buttery soft and tasty.. Wow! Not that it needs it, but their tartar sauce is nothing less than spectacular. I have to believe it's homemade, otherwise I'm running to the store to buy some!
The fried chicken has a thick, crunchy skin to it. I thought it was similar to eating a pork rind texture wrapped around chicken. It tasted good.
The sides... Red Beans and Rice (not like Popeye's, but still flavorful), candied yams (So SWEET it's sinful!), greens, brown gravy and rice.. All tasty. Heck! Even the french fries are exceptional! (thick steak fries). They have a great hot sauce, too.
Dessert: Besides the candied yams (YES! They are that sweet), they have Caramel Cake. Just enough sweetness to know you're eating dessert, and a moist cake texture, just the way you want it.
Drinks have a standard set of soda choices, water, etc. They come in plastic glasses. While you order at a register and sit down, food is brought to you, as well as the drinks. The server came by repeatedly asking if everything was okay, refills, etc. 
Prices are very reasonable. About $10 for a plate (entree and two sides).

The restaurant area is huge. About twenty round tables, it seems, with chairs all around. It's a very nice layout, without being crowded. Of course, I was there on a Thursday afternoon. Sundays, or Friday nights, I'm told gets busy! With this delicious food, I can see why!

As I said, I've had take out several times. Even going miles and miles away, the food stays warm, and is absolutely scrumptious!

I love to support local shops, but when it has food this good, and this reasonably priced, with excellent customer service, I'll be going back again and again.",viUJFHb9jIHJYpUv07MeVg,4,1,5,vg5wK4rObQvd2C1SDHQkjQ

5596731,2017-02-03,0,sVr_5-H0emPH9BcCiwG8xA,I loved this place tremendously!!!! The catfish was amazing and I enjoyed the fried chicken and how it was fresh and not terribly greasy.  The Carmel cake was great and the macaroni was awesome as well!  Our server was the kindest young man and the gentleman who was from South Carolina was amazing.   I was a little nervous by the name because I was with my boyfriend but I was more comfortable with him here with this amazing staff than pretty much any other recent restaurants we visited.  Highlight was definitely the catfish!!!!,crOnL6IXzIRxzOO5j8kRSQ,5,4,5,7kewDfkrDPIvcP26hhE9Dg
