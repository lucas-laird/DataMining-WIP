I hope they keep the Doritos Locos Taco forever, and I'm not kidding!  If you haven't tried it- go now.  A Dorito as your taco shell?  Nice!

Every time I go to this location they are either out of something, my order is accurate, my food is cold or I'm waiting 30 minutes plus to get some tacos. Last night was the final straw for me when I ordered my food and requested no beans and the lady proceeds to tell me beans don't come on what I order, but I order the same thing every time?? Pay for our food and get to the window and the younger girl taking orders has her cellphone plugged in the wall by the cash register and as she is taking orders she has her phone in her hand gabbing to the so called manager Ana. No wonder my order was wrong. Why are your employees allowed on their phones while working??? Why is it that the most germ ridden device in your hand while taking food orders and packaging them?? I go into the restaurant after I realized my order was incorrect as I knew it would be because it always happens at this location. The so called manager Ana then proceeds to cop an attitude with my boyfriend and I exclaiming that that was what we ordered. She reprints my receipt showing me that, that was in fact what I ordered. Yelling at me and telling me no this is what you ordered you didn't proofread what we rang up, because it's my job to check you on your job? Hello no. I told her I don't care what your receipt says that's not what I ordered you rang my entire order wrong because your cashier is on her phone not listening to anything any of the PAYING CUSTOMERS are saying. But these are the same whine babies that want $15 an hour to make some tacos?? This location has lost my business.

After he told me that wasn't an option, I read off the board the number next to the menu option.

I disagree, I came to Taco Bell on my lunch break. Sometimes my patients aren't always a very happy situation. So it's nice to break away from the office and see a smiling face for lunch. Fredrick was just that! His kind voice and smiling face makes me want to come back. I normally eat Taco Bell maybe 2-3 times per week. (It's bad that I can admit that, haha) Just due to my work schedule. Plus,Taco Bell is just delicious. lol! I usually frequent the location on lake mead here in summerlin. Their Freeze machine is always broken so I decided to drive to the location on charleston (which is a little further from my office). And I'm very happy that I did, I will drive a little further to have such a great experience. Great job Fredrick! You rock! My order was perfect, the sauce on the side was correct, i got my Baja Blast Freeze, perfect expience. I feel like often times great customer service isn't always appreciated, I hope that Fredrick gets all the recognition he deserves.
