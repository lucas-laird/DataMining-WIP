The selection of food wasn't as good as I remember. They didn't have as many shrimp dishes. Some of the food looked like it took a serious downgrade. I did love the egg foo yong. 

Service is decent enough. The food is alright for the low price. Though it isn't great it is a nice change from the regular fast food places.",GbdjVir2XDTX2fUCgmRHuA,3,0,3,KCqn5Ei8lF_WZRxLuw9Lfg

It's been considerably renovated and there's a greater number of items available.  The prices are a bit higher, but soft drinks are now included.  The people running it are the same and their approach to cookery is the same.  If you liked it before, you'll like it now; and if not, not.  I live right nearby, so I regard it as a useful neighborhood resource.",Bq8uaASvzs4KEjXWKw6Hpw,3,0,2,sjGEFpUDr4VDwDpT8_9ZHw

1303428,2010-08-05,2,ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w,"Over the years I have dined at many cheap low end Chinese buffets. This is easily the worst.  

Their sign says they have something like 150 (I don't remember exactly) items. I don't see the point of having so many items when stray dogs wouldn't even eat this food.",Dq_-1o9wt6bDCPmxGtVybg,0,0,1,59O388NceVWMNKrx5niMow
1998763,2009-12-27,0,ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w,"Inexpensive at $8.99 for dinner.  We went on Christmas night and the food was pretty bad overall but some of the items were good:  fried chicken wings, bok choy, shrimp, daikon/beef soup, and the soft ice cream machine.  I thought the waitresses were efficient at taking the plates, too.

What can you expect for $8.99 dinner?  It's just mass quantities of biomatter when you come down to it!",Mb9l9LRoNnBHvg6MdzX8DQ,0,0,2,LMvpqELb1NoS05nmR3YzCw

3029578,2010-10-25,2,ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w,"Well everyone I will have to agree with all of you. I have come here twice once because I was invited, second was today because my mother liked it. But to me I could taste the difference between everything... everything tasted the same! Cheap, but not so good. When I have been there both times it has been clean. The service was there, but when would I need them, except for refiel right? The only things I really did like was the sweets thats all. But everything else after your done eating you can't really taste a distinct taste.  But yea save your money, this is the last time i am going next time I am taking her to another buffet, like new Asia Buffet I hear thats good. Well, the thing That I really do not like from there is the entrance. That blasted creeking door annoys me!

That and today I found a bee in the window next to where I was eating, good thing I killed it before it stung anyone. Plus... In the bathroom there was a mans genitals drawn there LOL. Just please everyone just pass this place and save your money.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,1,0,1,2WueeoqxwNtBdCVqY3gdCA
3249851,2010-04-29,0,ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w,Cheap buffet. That's about the only positive. Nothing really tasted good. Everything tasted old and reheated multiple times.,knrT6SRK3Bbpu8qmMcw5Sw,0,0,1,Xt9ai5uBFFwabRHsuD3s2Q

It's horrible. Horrible. Seriously, this was terrible.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,2,1,1,OmNdorlNIYHvgPIKmN5OmQ
3311993,2011-01-09,0,ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w,"save your time and money. dont go here. the food is nasty. everything tastes the same as if they cook everything in the same oil or pot. alot of the food was cold too. anything that was hot was too hot and i burnt myself from the steam rising from the warmers under the food trays. 
the mens restroom was worse. urinals were overflowing and the toilet was backed up. o yea it smelled like sh** all the way out to the dining area. our server was good though. she came by every 10 minutes to make sure we were ok.",1noEnpLlagabkc7TXKXBBQ,0,0,1,DF3XMe9Wd0JaF_9AC8jd9Q

4089061,2012-12-07,0,ye62ltisuIosDq5F_6V25w,"Continuing our family tradition of Chinese buffets on holidays, we ventured out to find a decent buffet on Thanksgiving. I'm not big into buffets and the previous reviews on this place had me skeptical. We decided to take a 20 minute drive down and see what New China/Lee's Buffet had to offer. We pulled up and the parking lot was crowded. Heading inside I stopped a group of ladies and asked about the food. They all agreed the food and prices were good. 

Once inside, I headed straight for teriyaki chicken. I piled on an assortment of steamed rice, lo mien, pot stickers, teriyaki chicken and dim sum. It was all actually really good. My main complaint was that the food wasn't hot. It was all warm but was not have the hot fresh meal I was hoping for. I went back for seconds and loaded up my plate with the same items. My husband had sushi, desserts, shrimp....and basically a small sample of everything offered. He agreed that the food was good but wasn't sure if he would make the 25 minute drive again to this buffet.

Our server was great. A little slow getting our refills back to us but overall nice and keeping our table cleans. The restaurant was very clean. All of the staff was great. Great selection of food, almost too many shrimp selections. I try to stay far far away from public restrooms so I didn't even attempt those. My biggest issue was that the food was hot. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely stop again but we won't ever go out of our way to eat here.",4A83_zUaPBUn5Nc7eeOgtA,1,1,3,rwlCfhTMqyHe52B5VWMu1A

However, put that aside and what you have is a dirty meat factory. Almost all of the dishes were shrimp, and the blandest shrimp to say the least. I have never eaten so much food that had no flavor whatsoever. If there was a prize for taking food and making it taste like nothing this place would win, hands down. I believe that this is the only Chinese restaurant that I wish used MSG. They got two stars because they were friendly and the service was decent.",T-IFPvIAF6MN7RRNYlh75Q,1,0,2,V2wxFpGD6tGgXrNYv6E_ow
