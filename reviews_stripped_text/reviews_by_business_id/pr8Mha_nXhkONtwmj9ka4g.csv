205083,2016-03-27,1,pr8Mha_nXhkONtwmj9ka4g,"Went tonight with my husband. Chips and salsa were brought to the table quickly. The chips were good, not too thick and they came in a nice-sized bowl which is good because refills of the bowl cost $4. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where extra chips cost money. I happen to love chips and salsa but I'm not paying $4 for it. The salsa was chunky and spicy without being so much so that I couldn't eat it (I'm pretty wimpy when it comes to spice!). I should mention that we were thinking about ordering nachos to share as an appetizer but the cost came to almost $20 for a full order with add-ons of beans, jalapenos, and chicken or steak. I guess the $11 nachos by themselves is just chips with cheese? I get the upcharge for meat but who charges for beans and jalapenos? We decided against it. Both hubby and I ordered fajitas. He got the steak fajitas (the menu said marinated) which the waitress told us was tri-tip. I got the chicken. We ordered them well done. I like well-done meats and I especially love my vegetables well-done to blackness. The fajitas come with soup (noodle or albondigas soup which is a vegetable soup with meatballs) or salad, rice and beans, sour cream and guacamole for $16.29. My husband got the salad. The salad was very small. It came on a plate that at another restaurant would be the bread plate. He got blue cheese dressing and said it was good but nothing special. I LOVE albondigas soup so I got that. The soup came in a bowl which was much larger in comparison to the salad plate. Weird proportions. The soup looked great but had very little flavor. Another big disappointment. Finally, we got our fajitas. They were cooked perfectly! The vegetables were blackened and both the steak and chicken were well-done. I was very pleased by this because I order well-cooked vegetables at EVERY Mexican restaurant and they are seldom cooked the way I like. I couldn't wait to eat! Unfortunately, this was the next BIG disappointment and the one that means I won't be going back. The meats and vegetables, while cooked perfectly were not seasoned AT ALL! The whole point of fajitas is the fajita seasoning. Remember the menu said ""marinated?"" I know because we checked after tasting our food. If that steak was marinated, then I'd hate to taste the unmarinated meat! The steak tasted like dried out liver. Yeah, we asked for it well-done so dry is a risk we take but liver-flavor? No, it sure did not taste like tri-tip to me! It was so flavorless, we asked for A1 steak sauce to make it edible! The chicken was marginally better but again no seasoning. The sour cream and guacamole came in a small bowl but there seemed to be a good-sized portion of each and the guac was tasty even though I didn't see any chunks of tomato or onion. No cheese came with the fajitas which was surprising. The rice, and refried beans were standard. I don't happen to like either so I can't speak to how good, or not, they were. I almost gave the place two stars for the way they cooked the fajitas but I just couldn't do it because the flavor was so lacking. The service was fine. The waitress was prompt in taking our order but we didn't see her again until we got our check. However, we had at least three other staff members do our bidding- fill our water glasses, give us napkins, bring the steak sauce, etc. - so we didn't feel the loss. I'm sad that I can't find fajitas that are flavorful and cooked the way I like. My search continues. El Burrito is definitely crossed off the list of places to revisit!",wcNNu8b8czwHzaKvkswO5w,1,0,1,F6CVP_Pp0bHOPvepOuO9bA
300643,2013-02-16,4,pr8Mha_nXhkONtwmj9ka4g,"On my LAST and FINAL trip had bought a groupon and had decided to take my mother there. I had ordered 2 rolled tacos ( al a carte) my mom a chili relleno ( al a carte) both approx $6 each and a chimichanga (al a carte) to go approx $10. The manager /owner was very cold and couldn't  seemed to be bothered. My rolled tacos were average and when he dropped off the plate of a flat chili relleno had not warned my mother how SCOLDING HOT the plate was! When she tried to move her plate closer she actually burned her fingers. I almost didn't believe how hot it was when I touched it myself. What was crazy was the owner/ manager actually heard her say ""Ouch"" and just looked then just walked away! 
The relleno was flat and bland my (2) rolled tacos were like ""minis"" and for the price we were both very disapointed. The chimichanga was for my father to go and when we brought it home for him he actually took about 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore. Said it was pretty disappointing and bland as well. 
   HERE IS THE KICKER ... The owner/ manager actually had the guts to charge my mom and I a ""mandated"" gratuity of approx 18%! My husband and I have purchased a couple of groupons for this particular restaurant and had never been charged this before. ALSO looking at the fine print it had said alcohol and gratuity not included. No where did it say there would be an additional charge of over 18%! When I got the bill and it was almost 10$ higher.. I asked him to come back over and what the charge was ? He told me that this was mandatory and had always been charged for groupons. I told him I had never been charged this before and he actually told me I was wrong and should have been charged. As I had bought it on my phone I actually had the fine print right there and had read him where it said alcohol and gratuity not included. He started to argue and be very rude to me as I was asking to see where it said I had to pay this ? ( please don't get me wrong it's not tipping i believe in its over tipping ... Especially as I am in the tipping business myself) then he was very snide and said well ill take it off this time, and that he had to call groupon and make sure that they add it to the fine print when he couldn't ""find"" when he grabbed my phone and looked as well!  Really ? You're telling and treating a customer like this ? Basically trying to  make me feel like I was crap.. And was doing this right in front of my mother ( she had never been before) when he walked away to adjust the bill my mother was shocked and couldn't believe the audacity of how this owner / manager was treating us! I HAD BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR A WHILE NOW AND OVER LOOKED DECLINING SERVICE AND FOOD AS I LIKE TO PATRON "" MOM AND POP PLACES"" . FORGET IT ! WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD  MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. They also had seemed to have had similar experiences and had stopped going to El Burrito as well.  I will NOT BE BACK AND DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE !  THE OWNER / MANAGER IS AWEFUL AND THE FOOD SUCKS NOW! Especially for the prices. Not to mention it was 5 and we were the only two people in there ! DON'T GO!",NETXwi6TQivUUTpILnErRw,4,2,1,wYAOWxK7FxRQnaBw_yhcnw
338072,2008-12-28,4,pr8Mha_nXhkONtwmj9ka4g,"Surprised there are no reviews for this place!

I have to lay down my love for this little shop because it was the place where I lost my fried ice cream virginity to what is the most amazing dessert (that isn't melted damnit) on the planet. Fried Ice Cream is a ball of vanilla ice cream covered in crispy batter with Cinnamon and sugar, sat in a giant tostada and covered with chocolate sauce. It is amazing. It is sinful. It is NOT MELTED ICE CREAM. 

Chips and salsa is not unlimited though it used to be (sorry a lot of Las Vegas restaurants have been having trouble this year I think, a LOT of places closed due to the economy). Lunch is only 7.75 for a choice of like 15 different things. Nothing on the dinner menu is more than 15 except for a 12oz New York Steak. 

I really like to get Chimichangas here, they are super fried and awful for you but delicious. Full of meat, full of goodness. Great place to go if you are up in the Summerlin area, where real Mexican that hasn't been co-opted by giant Americanizing corporations is few and far in between. It's in a little plaza that can be hard to find, but worth it. It will look like you are going into Vegas's own giant old-people community -- because you are, but make a sharp turn right into the plaza before that happens -- otherwise beware the golf cart!",BMEmpeosi4LfwRlAMgtjbg,3,1,4,_I5aj_2PwhFtai7XmQp6tg
414563,2014-01-17,0,pr8Mha_nXhkONtwmj9ka4g,"Tonight we visited El Burrito with my husband and another couple. It looked really dark and empty from the outside, but inside was bright and the booths on the parameter were full. Decor is simple and restaurant is smallish. We got seated in a clean roomy booth by the kitchen.

The chips served are warm and thick and crunchy, and the salsa fresh and full of chopped tomatoes, and of a medium heat. Very tasty!

Ordered the soup- friends agree while very good, it was rather strange. It's beef based macaroni soup with cilantro and they add a whole pile of cheese on the bottom. Watching them eat it was like watching them eat pizza- cheese strings!

I ordered huevos rancheros, and they were pretty good, a bit watery somehow but the flavor was there with the beans so I'd get them again. Friends got the fajita salad and the beef chimichanga and the portions were  huge! The chimichanga beef was perfect, medium rare and tender. She asked for some pico de gallo and the waitress said they didn't have any but would be happy to make some. It came out fresh, spicy and full of cilantro. The salad was stuffed to the brim with veggies and the marinated chicken was tender. Husband asked for a pork tamale/taco combo not on the menu and they made it without hesitation. He says it was amazeballs... And the tamale was awesome and not dry. Getting a description from him is like puling teeth, so husband, one star.

Overall the service was a fast and friendly and the food was all enjoyable. It seems like a place you can frequent and they will get to know you. A quality locals joint for an easy and tasty weeknight meal out at a reasonable price.

Group consensus was 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because of the friendly local atmosphere. If you come here with the right expectations you will leave here with a full belly and a smile.",uE4mw9Vz5ez0A6F7HguVew,2,0,4,kQxyzPEqX1tT_U139CqvvA

We've given this place so many chances for our business, since 1997, as it's so close to our house, but the service sucks. The owner's son does not have his head and heart in the business, and he sure likes to BS with his favorite customers and neglects and is forgetful of his other customers. About a month ago, (our last and final visit), we sat and waited for  someone to take our order, 3 servers passed our table, including the owner's son, then he went to his friend's table and proceeded to hug them and BS with them while we waited. Based on our previous experiences, we knew we were going to have a bad service meal, and so, we just got up and left. We decided  to go to Pin Keow (Thai), and once seated, within 30 seconds, we were giving our order. What a difference !!!

The food is not bad but is WAY sub par for the price. We had 7 in our party, but 3 were children under 5 years. Mexican food should not be that costly. But if it is,...it should be great. This just wasn't. Taco shells are store bought, beans are store bought. For the prices it should all be authentic. We had a $25 gift card from restaurant.com, now mind you you have to spend $45 at least to use the coupon and add 20% for the the tip. We all had Iced Tea, and the kids drinks came with their meals. We were done eating and waited 15 minutes for the bill. (Drum Roll)............$80 bucks?@#? Even with the gift card?!@#$?. If we didn't have the gift card it would've been over $100 with no booze for 4 Adults and 3 little ones. Good thing we didn't order a cocktail. Well, that does include tip.

the food typically taste good. the biggest problem going on there is the service. I didn't understand what the problems were until recently. 

went there a few days ago and it was completely empty. sat down with wifey and kids, it took over 10 minutes, close to 15 to get order taken. drinks and refills, forget it. food came out, whatever, nothing special..was hot, but taste is just not there anymore.

refills on water wasn't possible. I didn't get it, makes no sense. the staff hides in the kitchen unless they need to bring you food.

the bus boys or runners, I don't know...just seem clueless. 

the problem is the servers. and recently I just found out they are related to the owner... perhaps that is the issue? family problems are affecting the business. if I was the owner, I would wake up and get rid of the family workers and get staff on there that actually care about the restaurant. or if your not interested in the business anymore, close up and move on.

sad to say i won't be going back, but that's just the way it is now. last few times service has been horrible, just not interested in it anymore.

Walking in, there was no hostess, she was in the back and emerged to bring another customer her order, when she did acknowledge us, she was very friendly and proceeded to seat us, handed us the menus, and took our drink orders. Their website states they offer happy hour from 8 p.m. to close on Sunday's, but I can't confirm since there was no mention of it to us.

I took a look at the menu because I was craving ceviche but they did not have any, which was a bit of a let down because all of the Mexican restaurants I've visited have it. We just ended up ordering the dessert we originally came for, fried ice cream and also ordered some sopapillos. After we placed our order, the dessert came out around 5 minutes later. We took a look at our fried ice cream and were a bit thrown off. It looked pre-made, it was cold on the outside, no whipped cream, no cherry on top, and the texture was weird, it looked glazed, and came in a cinnamon shell. It was like no fried ice cream we've ever had, it's normally fried before it's brought out, so it's warm on the outside, cold on the inside, not here. Now for the sopapillos, they were not thick or fluffy enough, they did have good flavor since they were coated with cinnamon and sugar but it's a dessert that is very hard to screw up. After we received our order, no one came to check up on us, it took a little while to receive our checks so basic customer service was definitely lacking and there were only two other tables when we walked in. 

I was really disappointed. Overall we decided on this place because it was smaller and we thought, why not give our business to a mom and pop restaurant instead of a corporate company, but it was a mistake.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,11,9,1,Ar8KCUWVS0kxaOevDBrq0w

Started with the soup and salad, pretty good soup. I've never really had super authentic Mexican food, so I didn't know what to expect.

We got nachos to share as an appetizer... you can get half or full size, but since there was 3 of us, we got the full size and added beef. It was HUGE! And delicious. Barely had room for the main course afterwards, but it's okay. I enjoyed it quite a bit.

For the main course we had the guac burrito. Also very big, couldn't finish it. But it was pretty good I guess? Don't have much to compare to. Flavor is definitely better than at the chain mexican places, more ""real"" taste, but very rich and filling.

For dessert, which we were too full to have but I needed to try it, was the fried ice cream. Never had fried ice cream before.. so I was excited to try. It was good, but I definitely prefer tempura ice cream from japanese restaurants.

Great little place though. Nice friendly service. Food comes out relatively quickly. I would give it 3.5 stars, but sinec i can't I round down since I didn't feel super impressed.",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,4,3,3,A-elZZJP22TOcPtirb9kTQ

My ex bf used to drive from Anthem to eat here, he's a Vegas native & guess at one time they had a second location on Decatur. Since it is located within Sun City, you will encounter lots of seniors (but can merely eat after 6pm to avoid that :) but it allows me to do one of my favorite things: drive golf cart to dinner/lunch. 

Though I'm not having Margaritas these days, the Cadillac packs a punch. The menu is standard Mexi-Merican and meals are accompanied by salad or soup & decent beans & rice. Salad is of the anemic iceberg variety which wouldn't bother me as much if the machacha chicken w guacamole salad wasn't my go to here. The house soup is comforting with beans and elbow noodles. 

I wish they offered more fish dishes here. One of my favorite light Mexican offerings is shrimp salsa w avocado cocktail. Most places will make it for me, even as an off menu item. No dice here, even when I was with aforementioned ex and this place was on our frequent rotation list. 

Aside from the limited menu options, service is very friendly and the owner is frequently working the room. Always feel welcome and well served here.

The complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal. I usually follow that up with the Noodle Soup. It's pretty salty, but it'll warm you up on a cool night and it tastes great.

1) Two Chicken Burritos w/ Red Sauce
2) Two Tamales
3) Carne Asada

So many things in life have changed and yet our favorite places remain. When I was pregnant with my, now, eleven year old son I craved El Burrito constantly, especially the meatball soup. This same child now loves this soup and craves it as well and has ever since he started eating real food. :)
The food here is traditional ""Amurrican"" Mexican fare, maybe not authentic but comforting. One thing worth mentioning is that the shredded beef filling for burritos, etc is almost all yummy juicy meat and not dry or full of fillers/onions and peppers or rice and beans. 
We always get the same few things and find the food quality to be very consistent. Service is spotty but friendly. I wish they gave some indication that recognize us when we go there since we always recognize them...and I tip 20%....for 12+ years.
Decor is aging but for some reason I don't care. Lol. It's just that kind of place.
Parking is easy for dinner since they are in a strip mall with businesses that are closed in the evening.

Like: 
*Cheese Nachos + jalapeno's. Sauces on the side.
*Mexican Pizza
*cheese enchilada
*Fajita's (nice and smokey coming to the table)
*Kids Meals

Best:
None of the savory sauces are sweet!
*Shredded Beef Burrito Green Chili style 
*Frozen Margarita...my Favorite in town...strong enough and not too acidic
*Mexican Meatball soup...only made on Fridays

Worst:
Sometimes the cheese on the Nachos is not melted all the way. I hate that!
The ""mild"" of the house salsa's is too watery and varies in heat level and cilantro flavor.
I wish the chips were warm and salted.
The awful, rubber place mats are often wet! Yuck!

We split a platter...one beef and one chicken enchilada with rice, beans, chips and salsa.  Really tasty!  Their chunky, pico de gallo salsa is delicious.  Wasn't a huge fan of their hotter salsa.  Reasonable prices and good service.  It hit the spot for our day ride.
If this was closer to us, I'd make it a point of going back there.  Not necessarily good enough to make a 45 minute trek though.",NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg,2,0,4,j_0gS90e1AynX1s6MKnKkA

It is kind of like a diner in a Midwest town that attracts the olds to have coffee and eat really bland Mexican food at ""that one thar Mex-ee-can"" place.

The tables have no hot sauce on them. HUH?

The menu does not feature burritos. HUH?

I had an a la carte chicken burrito that didn't come with ANYTHING. No salsa. No sour cream. No guac. HUH? 

I mean, I get that I ordered it a la carte, but not even a dollop of sour cream? Makes you go hmmm. The chicken was sub-standard and didn't have much of a sauce in it. As I sat there eating it I was envisioning a Chipotle burrito I could have gotten for a dollar less and it would have been a thousand times better.

Maybe I should have ordered something different, but for a place called ""El Burrito"" I was shocked there was not a plethora of burritos to choose from.

I say go to Chipotle over this place if you want EL BURRITO. 

PS - While I was there the US Foodservice truck pulled up and made a delivery. I knew this because he had an employee fill out a form and I watched him get in his truck and drive away. US FOODS you GUYZ. YIKESES.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,2,JBvzft2dwbm3Gjz0_AUJuA
4475350,2013-04-13,0,pr8Mha_nXhkONtwmj9ka4g,"I love this place and have been going here since I was born! This location hasn't been open that long, but it still has the same food.

It makes me sad to see all the negative reviews on this place, it's really not that bad. In the 25 years that I've been coming to this family restaurant, I've never had a problem with their customer service. This location on Del Webb is a little more quiet and they do have a lot of elderly customers, but everything has been nice and the food still comes out on plates hot from the oven. 

The noodle soup is to die for! Even when it's hot in the summer I still get it because it is so unique.. It's whole wheat macaroni noodles, vegetables, and cilantro in some special kind of broth that I can't figure out. My mom wants to work here just so she can find out the recipe.

Over the years, I've never really deviated from my usual, which is either a cheese enchilada or a guacamole burrito (chicken), usually the lunch special if I can make it here during lunch because it comes with soup or salad and a fountain beverage!!! My parents really enjoy the green chile burritos, but I don't like green chile in general so I can't comment on that. I've also never had their appetizers because I usually fill up on the chips and salsa and the soup.

If you're in the mood for an alcoholic beverage, try the Midori margarita! I'm not sure if it's on the menu, but it's really good... And in my opinion, the bartender that is usually there is very cute and nice. I didn't factor that into my rating!!!

El burrito isn't THE most authentic place (everyone has their own opinions on what's authentic), but I'm Mexican and I still like this place. The only con that I can think of is the hours (doesn't open until noon on Sunday so no breakfast, though they do serve breakfast items) and the chips aren't those greasy fresh hot from the fryer ones that some other restaurants serve. That's okay with me because they are still good. You have to ask for the hot salsa because I guess they are used to catering to people who don't like spicy...and sure the prices have gone up, but so has the cost of food to make the items. 

Believe me or don't believe me, but I will be going to this place until it closes or I die.",i1PDwTiMYA6zN1Picr__Yg,2,0,5,ks1ofK-BZj5M6Cp4zGNYAw

The dinner started with chips, salsa and we ordered a side of guacamole . The guacamole was good ....you can tell it was home made! The salsa was also delicious! Then they served me some soup with noodles it tasted like salt water to me. I was hoping my shrimp dish would be something savory but it was more salty then anything .My shrimp was served over a red sauce with some Spanish rice. I could only take a few bites and packed the rest to go. 

We ended the dinner with some fried ice cream topped with strawberries and chocolate sauce. It was tasty but I think it would have been better if the strawberries were fresh and not in the compote form (syrupy).

I though Las Vegas was diverse enough to have some good food by now. There is no cilantro anywhere on the burritos or the tacos.  Meat was flavorless and tough! Salsa is a joke here! Expect pico de gallo with some tomato juice for your salsa.  Enchiladas are the worst, I ate the worst imitation cheese that seems to be a shredded mix of store bought fake cheese! I ordered 2 and ate half of 1, I was to grossed out to eat anymore. The beans are canned, I can go on and on! Horrible, horrible horrible.
