Waitress comes back ""No Pepsi or Dr. Pepper"" ok Sprite please. Waitress comes back with the ""Sprite"" hubby takes a sip.... It's carbonated water. They forgot to switch on the syrup on their machine!! Comes back with actual Sprite. Time to put in the order.... Medium Ceviche, Shrimp Empanadas and pescado  sarandiado. Ok perfect we should be eating soon.... Waitress comes back: ""The cook said there isn't any empanadas right now""  Hubby: ""LETS GO!"" And we still paid for the 3 sips we took of the drinks. This establishment is HORRENDOUS, UNPROFESSIONAL and the reviews on here are a complete misguide. Makes me question ever using Yelp again don't trust these reviews.

My boyfriend and I stopped by on a Saturday night, the place was completely dead and there was only one other table occupied. When we first walked in we didn't get any hello's or acknowledgements, despite someone seeing us walk in, we didn't know if we had to seat ourselves or if we had to wait for someone to seat us since there were no signs posted, after a minute or two, a lady who I assume is the owner told us we could sit anywhere we wanted. 

I ended up ordering two ceviche tostadas and my boyfriend ordered one ceviche tostada and a few tacos. The tostadas were definitely lacking, they were packed with vegetables and almost no shrimp, it was such a disappointment. Service was almost non-existential here, we weren't really checked on so it's something they really need to work on. Michelada's were simple and served in oversized glasses, just beer, clamato, and tajin on the rim. They were little on the pricier side I'd say compared to other places who do a little more to spice them up. 

Now the reason behind my one star review and the reason why I won't be returning..Unfortunately my boyfriend and I got a bad case of food poisoning with me getting a more severe case of it with all the works. I think I ended up getting the more severe case because I stuck to seafood for my meal. If you've ever had food poisoning, you know what a miserable time you have, I ate nothing the next day and spent the day in bed because I couldn't keep anything down.

My husband and I would often hit San Diego to get our fix due to Las Vegas just not offering what we consider a good spot. This place is the best in town hands down. The food is great, the prices are good, and the service was amazing.  It's still not quite old town San Diego, but it's very close. We had a great time and plan on returning.",Yh2VlCRJM-tXeW2k2lRxTg,0,0,5,yFkKh6epNPcNFT3qL_gwTQ

I was the only person in the entire restaurant with the food server. I didn't care for the loud Banda music either. I had driven past this restaurant and was curious but now I'm sorry I tried it out. Eating options on the menu seemed overly priced.",1NbFusAiFMOLT1vOUyVr8Q,0,0,1,wqduXyHwSB8r7XRvnRqMvg
