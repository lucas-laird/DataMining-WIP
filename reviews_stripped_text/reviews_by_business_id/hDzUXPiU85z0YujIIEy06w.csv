Its like they washed the salad, but forgot to dry it.  I also ate the buffalo wings which was on the dry side.  I guess you come for the beer selection on tap and drink specials, not the food.",Rk6PsHdIfusm0CAglctdkQ,2,0,2,P6OfdzSOxkkft_Uuqd613A

We had been there once before with friends and my husband loved his treetini so we decided to go back. We sat on the outside patio, which was nice because it was great weather (for Vegas). Our server Nicole was great!! She gave us lots of suggestions off the menu, her service was fast, she checked up often and was super friendly. From the time we were there the hostess sat her two other tables that she had waited on before and she remembered them and their drink orders from before! My husband and I have both been servers before so we know what good service is and Nicole provided GREAT service. The food was very good also, especially for the price. We got an appetizer and two entrees and walked out paying about $30. We had the chicken nachos which are huge and so very yummy and my husband loved his grilled veggie wrap (that Nicole suggested) it's made with hummus and peppers and avocado, the hummus was great because it kept it from being dry. I had a Chicken Caesar, I could only eat about 1/2, it's pretty big and the chkn was very good, I usually don't like white meat chicken because it can be dry but this was perfect.  It also has a great atmosphere, great music and cool people, all just there to have fun. We also told the manager how great Nicole was and he was really nice too; he even gave us some coupons for a discount when we come back. We also noticed he was walking around throughout the night helping to serve tables and talk to people, not just sitting in the back. This place was great I'd highly recommend it to any one just looking to enjoy some good drinks, great food and a fun time.  
WE WILL DEFINATELY BE BACK :)",c8qhePXWoMAVMIzA5-g2ew,1,0,4,6qfvX0BB6lSuYSKnxKTopQ

We stopped in on a Thursday night. It was fairly busy, service was ok, our server never brought silverware or napkins with our appetizer, and we had to wait a bit for a second beer.

Started with Turkey Melt Sliders. Good bun, but salty turkey. We both had burgers, the Louie was better than the Angry Louie. 

Nothing about the place impressed us enough to want to return. Looks like Yard House will continue to get our business in the future.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,0,2,5Ds8DKG33rOTTyFbs3XMPA

The food was great and the service was awesome, especially MJ and Ryan!  We will definitely be going back there.  After awhile you get sick of going to the same places, like BM, Yardhouse and Grape.

They had an ok selection of drafts (I drank Bass) and it was a place I could actually hold a conversation with my friends without talking loudly like most bars we had been to all week.

The food was a little better than just ok. It was actually better than I was expecting from this bar. 

We got the Calamari which was good, California Chicken Club, yummy! The vesuvio melt was average and the Blue Moon Fish and Chips which were ok. Overall it wasn't to bad.

The server was a ditz but competent. 

I would go back prices were reasonable and it would try more of the food.",qnoXQsDOTOFwJEYXSCnHEQ,0,0,3,NGkRa4ViWr1SqOfpQaadcg
2255350,2010-01-31,0,hDzUXPiU85z0YujIIEy06w,"It's heartbreaking. I used to be a big Bar Louie fan in 2008 and early 2009. The food was always so good, especially the buffalo calamari. The service was always so friendly and patient, and a group of us used to meet there weekly for Beer and Blog. Then things changed. I'm not sure what happened, but suddenly the food was no where near as impressive as it used to be. Then the service went downhill. And, well, we stopped meeting there. 

I hated the idea of leaving Bar Louie forever, so my husband and I decided to give it another try on date night during the recent holidays. We sat at the bar. It was filthy. The chairs were covered with crumbs and the bar top itself was sticky and just plain gross. We left before anyone could take our order. 

It's heartbreaking that what was once a weekly favorite is now a place to which I'll never return. But I am hoping that someday it will get back to what it was originally, because deep down inside, I long to return.",2SoCvxdSZ0_USpUrVKlUNg,1,0,1,NZ1fVeMOHSvanFRNkcubHQ

There weren't too many people there, so thats kinda weird that the only other person to review Bar Louie was there at the same day/time!  

Anyway, the bartender was super friendly... and the happy hour prices were awesome.  We didn't get a Luigi -- but it looked tastey.  We only stayed for one drink, but will definately come back next time.  :)",ZMS5bGXARL0XLF09Kz9kSg,1,0,4,ZhK3N78Ii97v2fa8B0S6sQ

We had their dollar burgers and while they're worth a dollar, I didn't think they were particularly good.

They made a mistake on my order to top things off. I'm never, ever going back.

3517572,2009-08-28,0,hDzUXPiU85z0YujIIEy06w,"We went to Bar Louie for happy hour and had a great experience. The food is good but the service was even better. Our waitress Nicolle provided some of the best service we've had at any restaurant in quite some time. She was totally on top of her game -- greeting us as soon as we sat down, explaining the specials, taking our drink and food orders, bringing everything out quickly, checking back to see if we needed anything, stopping by and chatting for a bit. For happy hour beers on tap are $3, wine is $4, and appetizers are half off.

Here's what we got (all appetizers):
- Potstickers: pork dumplings w/ szechwan sauce. Cooked perfectly and tasted great.

- Baked Goat Cheese: goat cheese surrounded with marinara. Comes with garlic toast. Nicolle brought out more bread when she saw we were out. It was a good dish but nothing spectacular.

- Cheese Quesadilla: large enough for sharing with a few people. Tasted good.

- Crab cake sliders: decent bits of crab, with lemon aioli, not too much filler. They were a little dry but tasty. I still haven't had great crab cakes in this city. The fried onions were pretty sad -- tiny stringy pieces of onions that were over fried.

Some of the wines were decent. Beer was good. Food is about 3 stars, service was 5 stars. So, I'm averaging it out to 4 for this place.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,0,4,Spso-EYFk6WRMbys9WtqIA

Food - Our last visit we ordered three appetizers.....Cheeseburger Sliders, Hummus Dip, and Goat Cheese Dip.  They were all delicious.  However, the Sliders were a little overcooked and the goat cheese didn't have as sharp of a flavor as we would hope.

Service - Our server, Nicolle, was very helpful and personable.  She ensured that our glasses stayed full and that we were taken care of.

Atmosphere - This place is a bar/tavern.  There is a pool table & video games available.  There is also a nice sized patio, which i is where we ate tonight.....the weather was perfect.

3905401,2009-08-10,0,hDzUXPiU85z0YujIIEy06w,"Happy Hour at Bar Louie is just great!  $5 martinis (they've got over a dozen!) $3 drafts, $4 wine and all small plates are half-price!  Plus, Happy Hour is M-F until 7:00, later than the other bars across the way!

The food is really tasty - especially the sliders!  The crabcake ones with lemon aioli are my fave.  The Zucchini Chips are really tasty too.  Oh, and the Bavarian Pretzel sticks are really good - 4 huge soft pretzel sticks with dipping sauces.  The Hot Wings are tasty, and the quesadillas are HUGE!

My girlfriends and I have only ever sat outside.  The patio has a great view - and you get to see the underside of the planes arriving at McCarran up close!  Yes, it's a tad noisy sometimes, but it's worth it for the fresh air and lovely view.

A friend of mine told me that this place comes from the mid west or the east. Being Californian I was ignorant. But About 4 not 5 the happy hour started. I went with the Mangojito (mango Mojito) It was very sweet so ladies... try it. 
The rum lovers Mojito is no lie. It's 90% rum 10% leafs. 
I tried the Mario sandwhich which is great but for those on budget honestly sharing one sandwhich between two is a great idea. 

Bottom line, it's a little pricey but it's worth in. And a great Alt to Blue Marrtini.",JCBBmqUxWeEX8Y0tmYgD8g,0,0,4,8HfwJpq-g6wz9sN9ymh3wA
4264934,2010-05-05,0,hDzUXPiU85z0YujIIEy06w,"Long story short, I only like coming here to drink.

Short story long, well, when people talk, drink and sit there for at least 2 hours, they get hungry, so they want to eat. I've been to this location several times, mostly to drink and once on Tuesday $1 burger night. Like I said, I prefer to come here only to drink but when I do eat, their food is what gives this place the 3-Star rating, it's OK.

I've had other items that I've tried on the menu but they were so 'awesome' that my brain totally blocked it from my memory-- yes, sarcasm. $1 burger night, it's $1 for the bun, top and bottom and the patty. You're able to choose what you'd like on the burger, little did I know that they charge for all the rest of the stuff. I forgot how much they charge per item but I added onions, tomatoes & guacamole, it was beyond $1 at that point. Alright here it is, the burger was-- BLAH. I didn't care for it. The patty was dry, seemed like they cooked it and put it in the warmer for a LONG time. The bread fell apart, as if it were old, dry bread. I liked the fillers than I did the rest of the burger- the part that mattered!

At least I'll always have my beer, mmm, beer.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,1,0,3,TUaSp4ypCdLHWJCPWTZ46g
4473182,2009-08-10,0,hDzUXPiU85z0YujIIEy06w,"This place is more of a local hangout, not too many out of towners are going to find themselves having a beer at this cool little joint. I personally think that is a shame.

This place is awesome.
You can grab a beer after work or spend your whole evening here. 
They have happy hour and the food is yummy!

The waitress and bartenders are hot.

5231946,2009-02-27,3,hDzUXPiU85z0YujIIEy06w,"I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!

I love Town Square.. I really do. So many fun spots to have a drink or shop.. or catch a movie.. etc. I love Yardhouse and Blue Martini, but they get so freaking packed! When I go out I'm usually not looking for a ""scene"". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!

We escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free ""luigi"" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers. 

The downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding ""specialty cocktails"". The promo was something like 1/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and ""martinis"". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini. 

Food was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM! But I'm a pretzel freak and really easy to please), loaded cheese fries (again they are freaking cheese fries.. how do you screw that up!), and the Luigi sandwiches. They were solid Roast Beef Sandwiches, but honestly I prefer the processed garbage at Arby's (ok, at least I'm honest!!). The french buns they were on were superb, so I'd like to try other sandwiches there in the future!

All in all a great spot to try if Yardhouse and Blue Martini are packed to the gills and you want to just get away and actually get a table somewhere instead of being packed in like sardines. I loved the chill, yet upscale, atmosphere.

PS - Tuesday is $1 burger night.. maybe someone can make it out there and check out how good these $1 burgers are!!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,7,5,4,gBme0Ic8A1QE7c5hBIoziQ
