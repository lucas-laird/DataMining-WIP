1536767,2017-10-27,1,RrKfYuyKqBn3wKBZNBuFSw,Wack club. . Asian club owned by a rude white guy. Do not visit. No authenticity to the club. It always looks shut down.,3v24emMZG6OFzkzhbt557A,0,0,1,sfHrpjSARNgHQB1Tf_2Gdw
1635327,2018-03-03,0,RrKfYuyKqBn3wKBZNBuFSw,Never again called to reserve a room told them i wanted hourly for 12 got there they put us in a room with max capacity of 10 then tried to force a package on us that the food only include chicken wings fries and dumplings to stay in that room. Still decided to stay hourly so they said we couldn't be in that room and moved us to a room right next to it since we didn't want to buy a package room was the same size except the touch machine was bad and had a different system. After an hour of being there asked the waitress to cut us off at two hours when two hours neared we could not find the waitress i had to walk into the kitchen to ask for service after hitting the service button which we found out 20 minutes later did not work. Had to wait another 30 morning minutes for the waitress to come to the room and she tried to charge us for another hour even though she was no where to be found after 2 hours... I recommend Q karaoke which is in the same plaza have been there multiple times and have never had this problem... owner or managers told us we could not tell the waitress when we wanted to be cut off,HYc6ow1vPbdNYOhRNRef1Q,2,0,1,j6bMaw0zROcpC1kSUjRfEA

I wish i post what does it look like, the nacho supreme which i order.. There NONE guacamole, pico de gallo.. all i get strange looking sour cream come out from bottle.. the meat just overcook and the cheese just horrible. However the lady tried her best but the white guy manager rude to us. Rip off the price, it supposed to be happy hour and they told us it full price instead. NEVER again go back there, i am so disappointed this place. BEWARE....",ENXRunGgT54dXVxHzhbNJA,3,1,1,tnsjU_pAXmxuRHh4C7R4bQ

At first, we book through the call, that guy told me that 30 dollar per room, however, when we got there, the servant here told us 10 per person. Their words are like shit. Then we totally got five people here, and one of friends just come here to give me the wallet and then he left so quickly, and the servant said that he charge for six people for 60 dollar. WT??He even say: next time dont come. Worst experience ever.",SZv5EsiOFt9oXW9kWFjxXQ,5,0,1,KZerGqEh1La1LkRz4AxLAA

5387709,2017-12-25,0,RrKfYuyKqBn3wKBZNBuFSw,Came in for my birthday and we had a blast! We decided to order to the minimum of the room ($200 for medium) in stead of paying for it hourly. The staff was very friendly. They didn't have a menu for bottles but we got a bottle of 750 ml Ciroc for $120.. we later found out that they actually have 1 liter bottles..  which we would've gotten if we knew. Overall the experience was great and they have awesome songs!,8SECG12flyEqGvP_3qEjuw,0,1,4,JoQRIrM91OZIHX5clwD9Ww
