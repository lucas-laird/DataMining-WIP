1311513,2014-09-20,0,vfMV2La_c4rfq3NeT-lKFw,The one thing that stands out here is the customer service.  Very pleasant and nice.  I ordered the beef teriyaki and the beef was fatty and the whole dish was saturated in some sort of oil.  I had wanted to try this place for awhile and unfortunately I was underwhelmed.  Maybe I will try their sushi roll next time.,iQLsAUYtnXOQ5eYThY_5pA,0,0,2,uNa_zfenS-h9XOov_cqiGA

And she starts laughing when she realized she didn't put my order up, I Immediately asked for my money back, and they even didn't offer to comp the food or apologized .

2087621,2017-11-02,0,vfMV2La_c4rfq3NeT-lKFw,"My son and I usually come here because he really likes grilled shrimp. Well today we went there to order our usual teriyaki chicken and double shrimp. We've been there so many times that one of the cooks knows that order and knows who its for so well that he makes sure it freshly coked chicken and just the right amount of sauce. But tonight he wasn't there so we had to deal with the 3rd best cook. I gave this guy the benefit of the doubt only because i understand that you may have a lot of food expected to be cooked on a weekend. But not so much during the weekdays. Let me start out by saying he gave us damn near burnt chicken and the vegetables were damn near like soggy cereal. No crunch what so ever!!! SO no moving onto what really made me come to my sense and write this. The cook today gave me two to go plates. I ordered one, once again with double shrimp. I understand sometimes people make too much so they just go ahead and give you second helping.....sometimes. Well I had to make sure that this guy knew he was supposed to make on to go plate for me and my son. He acknowledged me question by nodding to me that both plates were for me. I hesitantly, very hesitantly asked him again and he this time said that they were both for me. I take them both with me to a table with my son, we sit down I and begin eating. he has his plate with just the shrimp and i have the other with chicken and barely any shrimp. The young lady with the glasses of hispanic descent that has an attitude more than half the time comes to our table. Sh 
.e begins to inform me with an attitude that we only ordered one plate. I replied that I did and I also asked your cook if he made the write order he acknowledged me twice that these were for me. As my son is eating the shrimp plate and enjoying it! I ask here, ""well then what am i supposed to do, my so is eating it as we speak and its not as if this food. She says ""i can give you a plate of just shrimp. the cook didnt understand the order."" So in my head im thinking how is this my fault or problem? I ask her if my plate is the actual chicken with double shrimp. Mind you my plate barely had any shrimp on it, but a bunch of chicken on it....burnt chicken at that! As i explain to her that this really isnt the usual amount of shrimp at all for a double shrimp, hell its not even close to a regular amount of shrimp in a plate. She had the nerve to look at my plate and say yes. Like I dont order that every time i come to the food court. So i said screw it here you can  have it cause im actually enjoying the time im spending with my son. i close the lid back and hand it to her. My son is now crying because he really loves eating shrimp and now i have to be the bad guy who closes his food up to give back. This lady says ""well you can have it sice he already ate out of it."" Like really lady you want to come at me with this crap when you walked up on his seeing that is going crazy on these shrimp! And not that i didnt ask twice about it, she needs to fault her cook and herself for the miscommunication. now she walks back scoffing like i did something wrong. Well i was being a good husband and told my wife as she came from the other end of the food court. she says that she doesnt want any bad juju and we need some blessings our way. She goes and pays for the food, comes back and says the same lady had an attitude with her for paying for the food.........am i really in the twilight zone here?!?!?! Did i miss something? We just paid for the food that your cook messed up and you still have an attitude like we ruined your day! The other, much nicer young lady never gives us an issue.Nor does their best cook! It just when these 3 stooges are together are the orders messed up. And ll the while this lady is giving my wife the stank eye and she was evenbeing polite and courteous. We are from the south so we have some hospitality living here in Vegas. And on cue, my wife gives her the RBF, for those that do not know, thats the Resting Bitch Face. So we didnt really enjoy our food, my son just ate the shrimp, i tried eating the triple chicken and barely any shrimp in my plate and decided that we were ot going to come to this food establishment and support this kind of buffoonery. To me now, you're better off going to McDonald's or Wendy's and getting better customer service than this place. Sucks cause that was the only reason we would come to the Meadows Mall, so that my son could sit down and have some grilled teriyaki shrimp. Its the little things that can have major effects. So i wouldnt recommend this place any more after that.",DY-yTg2mlsG7CGHqNVYkyw,0,0,1,fXtUxFH2dLi5SvUp3p1Qtw
2162292,2015-01-14,0,vfMV2La_c4rfq3NeT-lKFw,"This is your standard japanese grill in a mall place. You basically have a choice of teriyaki shrimp, chicken, or beef with rice or noodles. This mall isn't very busy so there isn't that long of a wait. The employees are nice enough so if you are at the mall and have a hankering for this kind of food, definitely visit.",Spgm6HFWgc4YXJlbhg11Pg,0,0,3,mY7b0gGEWkdmIDeg8CY6aA

They no longer have a bottle of soy sauce on the counter, so I requested 4 soy sauce packets. She gives me one. I ask for 3 more. She gives me two more. So I ask for one more. She tells me that there is a charge. I ask how much, and she says ""50 cents."" 50 cents? Wtf? That is expensive. Petty me just wanted to cancel the order and get a refund (which would probably take more time than it takes to pay this girl 50 cents in wages), but she advises me that it is only supposed to be 2 per customer so I let it go. But c'mon, pettiness like this shuts down businesses.",hvM3rCdc_5l0QzpmKMt6qA,0,0,2,tBwPzcFvfBTs4ZuFks1kDw

It's less than $6 bucks for teriyaki chicken, rice and veggies. We got 2 plates and a large soda for $14.08. I give the food 3.5 stars, and Diana gets 5 stars.

Diana was the cashier. She was SO NICE and FRIENDLY. The only reason I am giving 5 stars is because DIANA was so nice!

Every other restaurant in the food court was open but the moment I stepped foot at the counter, one guy turned the light off. The manager was at the register and didn't even bother to acknowledge me. Very rude and zero customer service. If you're hours say you're open until 9pm then stay open until 9pm. It's not like you have some grand menu that will take more than a couple mins to make.",2wxw0AEDsJFCjVmGT5OP3g,0,0,1,pJK-EOnd40Nhfp9c5HTAvA
5054215,2014-02-28,1,vfMV2La_c4rfq3NeT-lKFw,"I wouldn't call their food crazy excellent, but man, is it super filling and cheap! Sansei Japan sells Americanized Japanese fast food, it's pretty tasty for the price. First, someone is usually always standing outside and giving out samples of chicken for you to taste. That's usually what hooks me in.

 Also, they cook everything to order. They cook on a flat top which is open to customers so that they can see the worker prepare the food--pretty nifty! Everything that they serve comes in a ""to-go"" container, which is useful if you're planning to go home right away after hours of shopping at the mall. In each box, they usually pile on a ton of food, which is great when I am sulking from starvation at the mall! They try to get you your money's worth. There is a small variety of items: beef, chicken..even sushi! Also,  some sort of special is always going on for 4.99 or 5.99!

Again, their food's not the best, but we all know that Meadows has just an average food court--but I get so hungry, I never complain!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,3,2,3,39pCwNyDKLPf1zuHfLN-tQ
