128922,2013-06-22,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"I used to frequent this place all the time, it was a favorite for my wife and I. Sadly Dave and Jolene sold the place about a year ago and it was not the same upon our return a while back.
The first let down was the entire place had been somewhat remodeled. Granted it was always clean before, but it had a certain old school  dive type charm  to it. The mess of pictures and memorabilia all over the walls, etc. It wasn't classy but it was perfect in its own way. However the new owners painted it a bright white and the usual dim lighting which complimented the place was changed to bright lights. 

It took forever to get anyone to help us, at least 15 minutes, then longer than forever to get our food. We waited at least 25 minutes where as Dave used to have your sandwich in front of you in 5. The sandwich had hardly any meat on it and it as well as the French fries were doused in salt. We asked for extra cheese however couldn't even spot minimal cheese on there.
The cooks were three kids around 18. Not sure how you can sell an ""authentic Philly steak"" when it is made by a kid fresh out of high school. I used to have a friend who spent the better part of his life in Philly and told me more about cheesesteaks then I could ever imagine.

The guy who claimed he was the owner tried to make it right by not charging us but still nothing was the same. I wish the best to the new owners but it is no longer what I am looking for. Change is not always a good thing.",DlTo09jeWhfkhWcEYatihQ,0,0,2,CyUwwB4tfEHzbxGNLh9Hlg
528628,2011-03-14,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"The girls and I read reviews on yelp and decided to satisfy our cheesesteak craving at Geri's Olde Philadelphia. Thank you, yelpers, because we had a great lunch! 

First and foremost, big portions are all fine and well, but I HATE getting a sandwich I can't get my mouth around, and that is as big as my head. These were good sized sandwiches, but manageable. The daughters split a pizza steak sandwich, something I haven't seen since I lived in St. Louis eons ago. If they've been out here, I've missed them. They devoured and raved. I had the mushroom Philly, and it was spot on. We all really liked the rolls... not soft and squishy, but not so crisp that they rip up your mouth. Very good! The fries were good...perhaps on the skimpy side, portion wise. The beer batter onion rings were awesome, and huge on the portion size...go figure. They have a full selection of Dr. Brown's sodas, even the **shudder** Cel-Ray. (never actually tried it...s'pose I should give it a shot) They have a shelf loaded with Tasty Cakes for you East Coasters, AND.....wait for it.... We saw a couple of ladies come in and buy several sacks full of Drakes Cakes...Devil Dogs, Ring Dings and the works! I believe they ordered them in advance, but I know theres a few of you out there reaching for a pen right now! LOL.. 

Now.. my yelp peeve: Ambiance. For the love of Mike... it has the ambiance of a greasy old-timey Philly cheesesteak JOINT. That's right, it's a JOINT!!! C'mon, folks! I'm starting to think Americans are watching WAY too much food TV instead of going out and experiencing food. So inside you will see pix of Philly famous, maps, menus, asst. memorabilia and junk. Which is how it should be. Now if I go back to Picasso and it looks this way, we've got ourselves a problem! LOL.. Let's let our joints be joints, our dives be dives, and mom & pop hole in the walls be just what they are!",XUM2ddIWYN02TuMx_0pDxw,0,1,4,1mQmvnnKFf9n1BZymGxacA

It took me nearly half of my 14 years in Las Vegas to find something so close to actually being in Philly for an authentic cheesesteak.  The staff couldn't be more friendly and genuine to round out the total experience.

844969,2011-10-07,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"Firstly, I have to mention that the only reason why gave this place a chance, is because I received an e-mail from Living Social at 1 something AM, and when I tried to purchase the deal at 5 AM, they sold out of the special. That's 113 vouchers in 4 hrs and in the wee hours of the morning. This had to be good.
So, after my oil change, I swung by on my way home, and here's what I picked up:
Philly steak with the works and provolone (not a fan of that whizz stuff)
Pierogi
Tasty Kakes
Peanut Chews
I was informed that all the ingredients are shipped from PA. I'm not expert enough to confirm that nor am I one who has the ability to compare one with a sandwich from back home (being born but not raised in Philly) but out of all the Philly cheesesteak places in Las Vegas, this place has the goods. They aren't skimpy with the meat either. 
The people working there were great. They didn't rush me and answered all my questions to make sure they had my order right. While waiting for my food they even schooled me a little of my birthplace. 
I've observed food service since the 80's and managed 3 restaurants myself over a period of 15 yrs and while it isn't the best service I have witnessed here in the valley, it is one of the best nowadays. When it comes to customer service, you'll find me to be very picky; my 90% negative reviews will show that. I have met only one waitress in Vegas/Henderson that deserved a 5 star within my 11 years here. When the food is great, 4 stars is what they will get. If service lacks, then stars retracts- and for Geri's, the service maintains until the next time I come in when I dine in.",JvjWVp1PuZRUphl8HMrJig,0,0,4,Rui5MNjmtSy7AaYObEstgg

I had ""The Works""  which comes with provolone cheese, peppers, onions and mushrooms. $8.95 for a 9"" and $17+ if you want a 21"" sandwich. The meat was ok a  bit under  seasoned. Provolone cheese taste the best with this sandwich, Cheez Wiz overpowers the meat and veggies. The price is just a little bit more than the competition if you consider the size  to $$$$ ratio.

1549198,2011-09-17,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"Have driven by this tiny (sits few) little gem thousands (yes, thousands) of times over the years and never gave it a second look.  That was until on a whim some buddies and I decided to give it a shot.

I have been told that it has been at it's current location since 1977 and has only had two owners.

Geri's is the quintessential Mom & Pop shop.  The husband (cook) and wife (server) along with one other employee are the only ones that I have ever seen working.

Lot's of variations of Philly sandwiches to choose from and the cook will pretty much make what ever you want if they have it.

I have settled on a toasted ham and cheese as my staple when ever I eat here.

What ever you decide on eating you can't go wrong because it all comes on wonderfully soft and delicious bread.  I have been told it comes straight from Philly.

For a truly wonderful side of comfort food, I recommend the Tater Tots.  Want to take it to another level?  Add cheese to them.

One other treat that is sure to knock your socks off and make you fat are the shakes. Try the peanut butter and banana...AMAZING.

To fix any sweet tooth you might have they also have an assortment of Tasty Kakes to choose from.

If traveling over from another part of town, my one recommendation is to call ahead and see if they are open.  The owners go on vacation a couple of times a year and so the shop closes down until their return.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,0,4,we1PCFARyHQbaayXf3_ASw

Here's the scoop...
Food - A+
People (friendly) - A++
If you want to grab a good Philly and visit a place where they truly love what they're doing and the people they serve then this is your place.  If you want a quick chain where they could give two poops about you then this isn't your place.  
The food is fresh and reasonably priced.  These people are not getting rich of owning a Philly steak place.  They don't have golden arches or Dora toys for kids meals but you will walk away remembering this place.  Honestly, can you remember the experience you had at the last fast food joint you went to?  Probably not.
I spoke with the owners in great length and they are real people.  The owner apparently broke his back and had to go into a different work field (I sure hope they don't mind me posting this - I apologize and will remove if so).  Anyway, this is their life and you can tell they put their life into it.
Some other tidbits.  - restrooms were very clean and had plenty of hot water (which is a huge thing in restaurants).
What else?  Hmmm.. Not much - I'm not really a red meat guy and consume it sparingly but I had to chow this Philly down. Too good to stop.  Oh - ya - good portions too.
I hope this is helpful and feel free to hit me up if you have questions.
Oh - one thing I should note - you have to get in their by 6pm before they close and no Sundays.  I suggested they look at extending their hours a bit but then again they are family owned & run.  That's the worst thing I could say. :0",v43fVmipXyXhQaC5bptSCQ,1,0,5,8MAsZcV7BzDtCMpD_SwoFA

I tried to go a couple of weeks ago, but they were closed for the holidays and had a sign that they'd reopen on the 10th. So I ventured over last week.

I got the mushroom cheese steak and fried green beans. The cheese steak was good but a little greasy and dry at the same time. The fried green beans were pretty good.

Bread was fantastic and fresh.  The meat was tasty and cooked perfectly on the grill.  And the cheese ... you can get whiz if you prefer, but I'm a provolone girl with my cheesesteak.  I also chose to add the mushrooms, just because!  Around $8 for the large sandwich which was plenty ... wish I would've taken the last bites home.

The cheesesteaks are so good that we get one every week, and the shakes and malts are to die for, no kidding.  It's an old style diner, don't expect fancy, but it is very good, with lots of different sides and philly favorites. (Tastykakes, etc.) The only reason I don't give it five stars is that the service is slow and a lot of times outright unfriendly.  I suggest you grab one of the take out menus, call your meal in so it's ready for you when you get there, then take it home.  But definitely a regular choice for us.

I am editing this review on 3/3/13 to reflect the fact that the place seems to have changed hands, or at least have new managers and it's not quite as good as it was.  Maybe a 3-star instead of a four star rating now .... ;(",-mzS8ZrsN5vIhAM22gcS3Q,0,0,4,-LenN3xLW7KddDvA6J9q1Q

My boyfriend and I got 9in cheesesteaks, shared french fries, and had chocolate shakes.  The cheesesteak was not as good as my favorite in Hawaii, but very good nonetheless.  It was a different kind of cheesesteak I'm use to, very simple, not greasy or super cheesy.  It was a more healthful cheesesteak (not that - that's bad).  

I loved the fries and for the price it was perfect for the both of us.  I also LOVED the shakes.  They are so cheap and large (ha ha, that's what she said), but seriously, it's served in the blending cup which is always a favorite for me because it stays colder longer.  The consistancy was perfect for me and I love the LARGE straw.

Since I no longer work or live nearby, I haven't been here in a couple of years.  An old colleague of mine wanted to meet up for lunch and when he suggested Geri's I couldn't say no.

Since it has been a while, I wanted to make this visit count....so I ordered:

Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Cheese Whiz - $7.50
Pierogies - $3
Stuffed Jalapenos - $3.95
Sweet Potato Fries - $2.50

I know, it sounds like a lot of food, but besides the Sandwich the portions are small. (see pics)  Plus, I was sharing with my friend.

They deliver the food as it becomes ready here.  First up to bat was the Jalapeno Poppers.  Stuffed with Cream Cheese, the Poppers were awesome....cooked just right so they weren't dripping with grease and the Cheese wasn't going to burn the hell out of my taste buds.

Next up was the Sweet Potato Fries & Pierogies.  Again, cooked just right....not greasy at all.  I wonder how they do that?!  The Pierogies were very good....chewy, doughy shell with Potato filling....yum!  Sweet Potato Fries were great too....but I saved those to eat with the Steak Sandwich.

Last up was the Steak Sandwich....one bite and I was back in Cheesesteak bliss....dammit Geri's, I've missed you!  I instantly remember why I love this place.  My buddy who was having lunch with me is from South Philly and he brings his parents here every time they visit from Philly (5-6 x per year)....it's a family tradition now, that's how good it is!

First off, after going there 15-20 times and telling everyone how great they were even though I wasn't overly impressed with the service (I should also note that i've served, bartended, managed, and supplied restaurants and I come from a family of restaurant owners). They were flat out rude when I told them that they may have misunderstood my order (though I've placed it with them 15-20 times) when it was completely wrong. They agreed to fix it by bringing the items that belonged in the sandwiches on the side..in an attempt to brush me out as quickly as possible. Once I asked them nicely to redo it...i was treated as if I was asking of something ridiculous. I just thought it'd be nice to have what i ordered. Then after agreeing to redo the sandwiches they proceeded to make everyone else's order first while I waited another 15-20 minutes for my food...which I paid FULL PRICE FOR...WITH THE ATTITUDE FREE OF CHARGE! If you want great food and don't care a bit about the service GO HERE! It's really a shame!",NJMutnDx_imu9myH-q93GQ,0,0,1,6xzXklGqb1EAt5z0S1L2CQ

No freezer burn on the meat. It was yummy and fresh, including the bread. My wife is HOOKED and will definately go back. And so will I",ZtSzW0n2gSqWRAmQ_stkXQ,0,0,4,5L44Xl8Y0bcISFpCfpznwA

Dave was actually there dropping off some stuff so I was able to pump him and the new owners for info. Looks like the place will stay the same. They are using the same ingredients and are not going to mess with the perfect philly cheesesteaks. Thank god!
So for now this is still on the top of my list. Lets hope it stays that way.",khyig4aF00tZsTYw4F4GLg,2,1,5,ZiJeBb_onzO1iZP47ccP9Q

The owners waited on us and I spoke a little to the nice lady who took our order and rang it up. Having been born, raised and educated in Philly I can tell you this is the real deal. Right down to the rolls (Amaroso) which come from Philly to the Tastykakes, Wise Potato Chips and Goldberg's Peanut Chews. It is a little Philly oasis in the desert. Yo!

4884707,2010-10-05,1,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"My updated review of Geri's is the same as before.  Geri's is the epitome of good ol' hospitality.  Dave, the owner and cook, is behind the counter with a smile. His wife is usually there with him, serving the drinks, food, and shakes.  They always make you feel comfortable and wanted, which is a rarity these days in restaurants. 

The cheesesteaks are the best I've had outside of Philly.  Thinly sliced Ribeye oozing juices into the cheese wiz and onions creating a flavor combination even Escoffier would be jealous of.  Come to Geri's if you haven't, you'd be missing a special place in Las Vegas.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,2,1,5,lM8PpwYXJ4bGmuL4RZFx_A
4958305,2013-02-08,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"I'd been to Geri's several times before I got on yelp and it was one of my preferred places to get a sandwich in town.  I'm not near it as often as I used to be, so we haven't been in some time.  So, today while we were headed to Sprouts Market, we decided to hit up Geri's for lunch.  

The wife had chili.  I'd not had Geri's chili before, and it was good.  Very large bowl, we probably ate half with me helping.  It had good chili flavor, but I felt it needed more heat.  I understand I probably like things hotter than the general public, so I won't ding Geri's for that.  If we get it again, I'll probably ask for hot sauce or something.

My order on the other hand, did not go as well.  I ordered a cheesesteak and fries.  Fairly simple at a cheesesteak place.  Well, after 22 minutes, and my wife had her chili for at least 10 of those minutes, my steak was finally brought.  It was hot, as it was just made.  It was a little drier than I remember.  But, solid steak, and a lot of hot peppers and onions.  But, I did not get fries.  I then asked the cook (who brought my steak, not the server that took our order) where the fries were, and he proceeded to start making them.  I told him I didn't want them, I wanted to eat them with my meal.  

Our server apologized and came over with fries when I was more than halfway done with my sandwich.  I told the owner about our experience, and she was more than apologetic.  She basically comped the meal.  I know this is not typical, as I have been here several times before.  I only tell the story on yelp to mention how well it was handled and we immediately felt like it was taken care of.  What was a frustrating lunch ended well.  We will definitely return, this event will not factor into a decision to come back at all.  I will definitely go back, it's a more than solid steak sandwich, and the owner treats you right, even when they have an off day service-wise.  Give Geri's a shot.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,0,3,33Hcx951PLQvqU-RoIZnOg

They said they import their bread daily from Philadelphia but I don't know if I buy it. They have quite a selection and due offer cheeze whiz if you like to be authentic.

5778743,2011-08-30,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"Tried Geri's because Nelson Q. said they had the best cheesesteaks in town. Think I have to agree. I got one with the works for $9 - nice stack of meat with onions, peppers, fresh mushrooms and cheese on a 9"" roll. Seemed a little pricey but worth it since it was piled so high w meaty goodness. Bread was soggy with juices and from the 15 min ride home, but still intact. Can't wait to try it again fresh. 

We also got a decent serving of tater tots for $1.50 and a thick milkshake for $3 - real vanilla ice cream with lots of Heath bar chunks mixed in. I love that they had the foresight to use boba straws to suck it up that much easier. 

I loved every bit of my meal and promptly fell into a food coma, or maybe it was because secret life of the American teenager was on. Only issue was that they had already closed their doors early at 5:45. Luckily they saw my roomie and let him in, so we may have to call next time if its close to closing time. Definitely have to try those perogies",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,4,2,5,Zh3_3CXmYWxu8rm0QFvZ3A
5862732,2013-05-02,0,BGcrYtRjOc6eWtxOpD9cWQ,"Geri's used to be my favoriate place to eat in our way into town from Arizona.  We made our last visit there last week.  Unfortunately the owners have sold the business.  Even tho the new owners claim to have been trained by the prior owners the food was not the same.  I ordered a Chicken Cheese Steak with mushrooms and corn nuggets.  My girlfriend ordered the Italian Sandwich and fried mushrooms.  For whatever reason they didn't bring the food out together.  I got my corn nuggets a few mins later she got her mushrooms.  Then they brought my sandwich and it was beef so they had to remake it.  While they were making my sandwich again my girlfriend got hers.  When I finally got my sandwich it tasted like the chicken was dark meat.  Not my favorite.  Had little taste and was definatley not the Chicken Cheeseteak I had eaten in the past.

We were the only ones in there which should have told me something!  I had never been to Geris and be the only one there no matter what time we arrived into town.   The owner/waitress seemed gittery.  Not sure what was going on with her.  There was two other employees there who were doing something in the back with some TVs. 

 It's just not the same and we will not be going back.",v5pp27M4al3EPR0mXtk-8Q,2,0,1,rF9Frpfj0kVc8R_7kyk2qw

He assured me that he would not spit in my good. I asked which Philly was best and he said ""the works"", so I ordered it and let me tell you, it was great. I asked if he was the owner and has chuckled and said no. I would have given 5 stars if the young waiter had been as  good as the cook. He had to go out front for a smoke break instead of waiting to take the order from a party of four. The cook did it with a smile on his face.",I7Fi9mXjurvS1o8F8bN3eg,0,0,4,q_01hlZEEMd0XCcipL4psA
