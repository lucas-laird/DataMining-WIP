Being a Chicagoan and lover of Goose Island, I'm disappointed the service could continue to be that bad. Our original waitress didn't come back to take our food order, so the other waitress had to come take it...eventually. Once we were done eating, we continued to sit without anyone checking up on us for additional drinks, etc.  There was a private event going on and the two waitress were over there looking at some product versus helping the actual patrons.

I should of known that it would be a crappy experience since Budweiser bought them. We walk in and surprised it was so dull and boring looking inside. Being in the Hard Rock, we expected something sleek and modern. Nope, dull colors and boring. We stand waiting a few minutes since it said a hostess will seat us. The workers looking like chicken with their heads cut off. We finally get to sit, and then that's all. We sit and wait. Servers all huddled around one register to ring up. It was sad. We finally get napkins with utensils from a guy wearing a shirt with no name tag. That was unsettling or maybe a customer who feels the pain of horrible service. After 10 min and no one asking us for a drink order, we were done. Maybe we should go to the bar area. It's less packed. Before we go to the bar, we thought we were seeing things when a server comes in from the casino with a tray of food. Whaaaaaat Theeeee FUUUUUUCCK!!! Then another guy comes in with a cart and food orders. REALLY???? You mean to tell me, they build a brew pub with the kitchen not connected lol. That is very unsettling and who knows what kind of shit can go in your food as they are coming in from the casino. Sure, it has a lid, but a grubby ass person can ask for something and distract the server and someone else fucks with your food. Gross!!! If i'm gonna get my food violated, I'd rather it be in the same place im sitting at lol. So, we head to the bar and grab a spot so we can order a Goose Island IPA. We sit, and wait. One bartender looks at us, then proceeds to say that someone will help us. Really dude!!! You are just standing there and can't even take a drink order. A few minutes go by and no one helps us, so we leave. We were hoping to have a great time and check out this new brew pub and all we got was a sour taste in our mouth and not even sure if we would ever go back and give it a try. Horrible service like that is not cool. I can go get Goose Island draft at most places, so im not losing out.

1. When my husband and I first walked it it took a couple minutes for the girls standing around the bar to simply acknowledge our presence. Once they did, the first one to walk up said we could ""sit wherever we like."" There was an issue with this as the only two empty tables were stacked high with dirty dishes. She made no attempt to say ""oh we'll clean that for you."" 
2. The wait staff that took forever just to stay hello was standing around the bar doing nothing while one waitress ran around the entire seating area trying to clean and meet with guests. 
3. The beer selection is mediocre at best. Which I partially understand because they only serve Goose Island.

I enjoy their beer and have purchased Goose Island brand beer from my supermarket from time to time. I also very much enjoy the Hard Rock Casino and other restaurants inside of the casino such as Culinary Dropout and 35 Steaks + Martinis. So I was quite surprised by the poor service and trash food at Goose Island. 

If you must go, I suggest only ordering beer and sitting at the bar. It will probably be a less disappointing experience this way. 

The bartenders and waitstaff spend more time socializing with each other than making sure their customers are satisfied. I saw several customers get up from their tables to walk over to the staff who were gathered around the hostess podium to request service. My party waited for additional items that were ordered for so long, we followed suit and did the same. 

A member of my party was having a discussion with someone from the waitstaff when the bartender walked over and became hostile with my colleague without even inquiring about what the issue was. 

The staff here has a ""customer is always wrong and they can go fuck themselves"" mentality. And the food tastes of freezer burn. 

The staff is doing a disservice to the Goose Island brand. I would advise you to get a few comped beers from the casino instead, and if you're hungry, head to Culinary Dropout.",cpKmeEY7cljOWWpkU0q0wg,7,1,1,YrcduczH2fDU7njvrqhy9w

3756542,2016-07-11,0,ULAz5fw2r3vm0N-_FTMzGg,"Just opened 3 weeks ago. Serving 6 month old Goose Island IPAs. I'm not joking, I was given a ""fresh"" The Illinois"" bottle with over half a year of age on it in a 3 week old pub. The Green Line APA I was served from draft also tasted old. (For those that don't know, American style IPAs get their distinctive flavor from hops, and that flavor diminishes with age. For optimum flavor an IPA should be served with no more than 2-3 months of age on it... Old IPAs exhibit flavors of cardboard (oxidation) and unbalanced caramel and toffee from the malts. With American style IPAs, the  fresher the better.) 
Food is decent, but, a bit pricey for Las Vegas. Like most things at the Hard Rock, the space and the staff are attractive, and service is friendly. However, knowledge of their main product (beer) was sadly lacking. Any non-beer items require the waitstaff to leave the pub, as there is no kitchen in the pub itself.

Chicago style pizza dip
Bacon and beer nuts
Roast pork sandwich
Sweet Italian beef sandwich
Green chili pork
Poutine

Meeting at noon, the Goose Island Pub was empty save for two other patrons.  All sandwiches were shared between us.  I also ordered an iced tea which was refilled frequently.

Starting with the bacon and beer nuts and the Chicago style pizza dip, I found the beer nuts nice and spicy with small pieces of bacon mixed in.  The beer nuts were quite spicy.  The pizza dip is a different way of having pizza without getting a pie.  It's served with pieces of garlic crust and you spoon the dip onto the crust with some giardiniera (if you want) and it's quite good.

All three of the sandwiches had good flavors and the breads were soft and good.  The green chili pork sandwich was on a kaiser roll and had a fried egg.

Finally, I have to mention the poutine.  This is the only place in Las Vegas to get authentic poutine.  It was the first time I had tasted real poutine and it was quite good.  

Service was very good.  The place was very quiet.  I'm not sure if the Hard Rock's clientele were all interested in going to the pools but I sure saw a bunch of scantily clad ladies heading that way.

Located in the Hard Rock hotel casino, our group decided to eat together and Goose Island pushed tables together for our large group. Good beer selection, limited wine, but full bar. 

Servers had quite a time trying to keep up with the drinks. Our server seemed overwhelmed, but others stepped in to help. 

As for food, they make it somewhere else and carry it to the restaurant. 

Spicy Italian sandwich? Average and bread didn't taste fresh
Buffalo fries? Soggy and covered in sauce
Antipasto salad? Good and huge (I shared)

We had a great time time, but given the size of our party, food was subpar and servers seemed a bit grouchy.",VlyHGaMz3gbbQz5hytCeGA,5,3,3,gAQeKR_2cl1yXMOS3l106A

With drinks already in mind, the wife ordered a bloody mary and I opted for their seasonal which was a winter style ale. I prefer stouts but this ale was easy to drink and had good flavor. The bartender was very generous with the pour for the mary, which was nice. When you pay big hotel prices for drinks we are grateful of generous pours. Bar staff were friendly and checked on us often, so no issues there. But we did notice a few of the dining room wait staff obviously slacking off. We only stayed for 1 drink before lunch so we left shortly after our only round. No reason we wouldn't go back again for another round and maybe play some shuffleboard too. The only issue we ran into was access to the parking, its a bit confusing and difficult to get in and out of the property depending on which way you are coming and going from.",4qXTMirb3noPUosWj_Pfvw,0,1,4,u-bAu9nz-7FY50YHqXP9Jg
4425031,2018-06-02,0,ULAz5fw2r3vm0N-_FTMzGg,"Goose Island Pub is the ideal spot to watch the game, grab a brew and that's about it. You can chose for a long list of Goose Island beers but food option is very limited and somewhat unappealing. The options are the usual greasy finger food available at the bar. French fries, cheese curds, chicken tenders, etc. 

We end up ordering the chicken tenders with a side of BBQ sauce. Thank god for the BBQ sauce because the chicken tenders quality was equivalent to the quality of a Hungry Man TV dinner entree. The batter and the meat was tough. Usually anything that's deep fried is edible in my book. Boy, not this time. 

The upside of the pub is the abundance of televisions. You can honestly watch all sports at once. We were tuned in to a NBA game and 3 MLB games at the same time. There's no need to argue about what game to tune in to. You can watch them all. I'll recommend coming here for a cold one and to catch a sports game. Perhaps skip the food and try one of the restaurants close by.",1IDGT7RHqYF76jm7CRuXdQ,1,1,3,h29Pew5u9jABRstiDMadpw

This is beer lovers dream, if they like IPAs they're in for a treat. The place itself is pretty small lots of TVs so great to watch sports.

We came here after my job and sadly there was NO HH. Other than that we got jalapeño poppers which were a bit pricey and also loaded tater tots, the tots weren't so bad but the cheese was a bit too much. The jalapeño pallets weren't bad and you get a ton for the price.

The drinks were pretty good I was able to get the Stella cider that I liked.  My boyfriend totally enjoyed the Matilda and other IPAs. 

The service itself was not bad the server was very friend and pretty quick with our drinks and food.

At this point rivaling many of the industry's biggest names in terms of styles, awards and distribution, a total of over thirty Lagers, Stouts, Pilsners and Ales including their eponymous IPA and 312 Urban Wheat commonly found at Bars, Grocers and Liquor Stores across the globe, fans of Goose Island Beer Company are a devout group frequently encountered in the MidWest and although the company sold to Anheuser-Busch in 2011 most will say the quality has not diminished, the only real change being an improvement in the products' previous scarcity.

Founded by John Hall in 1988 and growing the brand out of a small Chicago brewery into an empire of Pubs spanning seven cities including Las Vegas as of June 2016, one could say that Goose Island was one of the first American Craft Beer manufacturers to really strike it big, the 3,500 square foot location inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino playing host to two for lunch during the first Saturday of College Football in 2017.

Formerly home to The Ainsworth, a shadowy Sports Lounge across from Vinyl that had never seemed particularly hospitable, Goose Island Pub picks up where the former tenant left off by retaining its dual ports of entry but by opening one up and redecorating with blonde woods, better lights and more televisions the space instantly feels more welcoming, a recent tweak by Hard Rock Executive Chef Bradley Manchester seeing the space ditch Pretzels, Pizzas and Tots in favor of a menu built around the Windy City and several classic American Sandwiches.

Not especially fond of Beer and dining with a total teetotaler, the obvious focus thus on Food and the scene with a particularly brisk Iced Tea refreshing palates between bites, it was after greetings from a well-inked Bartender soon joined by a blonde female server in short-shorts that the menu was perused, the eventual order including a half-dozen items including three Sandwiches with everything sent out at a leisurely pace across three courses.

Largely familiar with the company and its first BrewPub, a favorite of family during their time in Chicago though the food had never technically been tasted, it was with Oregon State playing across several Televisions while the Yankees occupied others that conversation carried on beneath Rock music, the first round featuring a metal bucket of Crispy Bacon and Peanuts with a Spicy Maple Glaze alongside thin slices of garlicky Pita and a skillet of stewed Tomatoes, Pepperoni, Basil and bubbling Mozzarella.

Not the sort of place to cut corners, the spicy Giardiniera, Sweet & Sour Peppers, Pico de Gallo and Buns all made in-house daily, it was with the last few bites of Relish finished off that two sandwiches arrived in white wrapping, the presentation doing no justice to the package's actual contents as both the juicy roast Beef and Pork were as good as what one will find in Chicago or Philadelphia, the former served with plenty of Peppers on a toasted Hoagie capable of standing up to its contents even after a dip in Jus while the later could make fans of Tommy DiNic's do a double take.

Equally presenting classics alongside novelties, platters of hand-cut Fries offered plain or with any number of toppings including Hot Sauce or Chili, it was a bit of a shock that the other man at the table stated he'd ""never had *real* Poutine"" when a platter slathered in melted Curds and rich Beef Gravy arrived, the bastardization of the dish largely due to the Québécoise themselves but Manchester's version true to the real thing while the Green  Chili Pork channeled the Southwest with tender roasted Butt spiced up by Cayenne and Black Peppers even before the smoky Green stuff was added along with Pepper Jack, Onions and Tomatoes plus a Sunny-Side Egg on a fluffy Kaiser Roll.

***1/2:  Thus far not really capturing the hearts of Las Vegans or Tourists, the fact that much of the Hard Rock's clientele comes from Los Angeles as opposed to Chicago at least partly at play, Goose Island is a very strong entry amongst the city's best places to catch a game, though in order to truly stand out the presentation of Sandwiches could stand to be a little more creative while game-sounds as opposed to music from the Casino floor would also be much appreciated.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,4,G-m4FmQh_KAA0epMNLeLIA

The bar back had us seat ourselves so we chose a corner table in the same area. After sitting there for about 10-15 minutes with no acknowledgement we decided to just wait in the bar line to order drinks since the waitress had a large group and was really busy. After waiting in line, with several people behind us, we placed our order. The bartender asked if we were with that group, when we said no, he VERY rudely said ""well why are you sitting in that area then"" followed by telling us that even though we were first in line, he was going to serve the 4 people behind us because the large group was his priority. We went back to our seat with nothing accomplished and 10 more minutes wasted. After we sat down, random people from said large group approached us offering to order for us because they couldn't believe how the bartender just handled the situation and treated us. Shortly after, the waitress came and apologized as well. After a quick discussion between my friends and I, we abruptly left without spending a dime and took our business elsewhere.
