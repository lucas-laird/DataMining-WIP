My wife and I went to Strip House for our 30th anniversary dinner. We left there feeling like it was one of the best meals we had ever experienced.

First, ask for John to be your waiter. As good as the meal was, John put it over the top. He took time to explain multiple dishes to us, and he went out of his way to make our night very special. My wife even hugged him after dinner, he was that good. Thanks John!

My wife had a basic meal of fillet and baked potato. Both were amazing. The steak was as soft as butter. I had the featured bone-in fillet that had cheese crusted on the top and a balsamic reduction below - amazing! I also took John's recommendation of the gnocchi as a side dish. It had a delicious creamy sauce and shaved truffles on top - awesome!

To top it off, John brought us a slice of 20? layer chocolate cake for dessert (complimentary). It was on a beautiful plate that had ""Happy 30th Anniversary"" painted in chocolate. It also had a scoop of vanilla gelato. We were stuffed, but we ate about 2/3 of it. It was a delicious end to our meal.

We arrived at Strip House right on time for our 6:30pm reservation. The hostess seemed somewhat confused, and not very friendly as we walked up. She said she couldn't find our reservation in her computer, so I showed her the email confirmation from my phone. After a few minutes she finally says, ""Oh the online reservation system must have put the wrong date. It does that sometimes.""  Yeah right?! We are convinced that the mistake was simply hers and she was looking on the wrong date. Anyway, we got seated quickly after that, hoping that things would get better for the rest of our time at Strip House. 

The dining room is very cool. Dark woods and red, very red, with black and white photos of old time dancers and entertainers. It was a full house the night we went, but it still felt very intimate, still being able to hear our own conversation without screaming at each other. 
 
The service at our table was excellent. Our server was very serious. He maybe cracked a half a smile the entire time we were there. But he was competent, attentive and good at his job. He knew we had tickets to an 8pm show so he made sure our service was prompt.  

The food definitely made up for the mess at the hostess desk. We ordered the bone-in rib eye and the bone-in NY. Both were delicious. One was cooked perfectly (medium well) and the other was slightly less medium well, but still really good.

247158,2016-07-12,1,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Thank you, John, for making the service as spectacular as the food!!

Our meal at Strip House was the highlight of last month's Vegas trip. I was in town with my friend Matt, celebrating his 30th birthday. The staff at Strip House greeted him with a warm happy birthday and made sure that our handicapped-accessible table was ready and waiting. John expertly explained the specials, and patiently answered all of our questions about the appetizers and entrees. He delivered our food in a timely manner and made the entire evening feel so rewarding. Not only did we get a meal - we got an experience!

We ordered the burrata appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. I considered ordering another, just for my entree. I'm glad that I didn't however, as the aged dry-crusted rib-eye was unbelievable. Much to my family's frustration, I've never been much of a steak person - but this definitely changed my attitude. TJohn sold me on it, based mainly on the process they use to prepare it, and on its salt and black pepper crust.  

The steak was delicious but also so large that I couldn't finish it - well worth the approx. $55. 

My neighbor ordered the lamb t-bones, and thankfully she offered me a bite - they were heavenly, and at $44, a steal. 

The sides are family style, so we ordered the following and shared them:

Potatoes Romanov (a meal in itself, crispy on the outside and deliciously warm and fluffy inside)
Creamed spinach with truffle oil (perfect balance of flavor)
A warm, buttery corn mixture (sorry, can't remember the name)
Macaroni and cheese (a little bland for my taste, but the birthday boy loved it!)

Finally, we ordered Matt a slice of the chocolate cake. I was surprised when John set a plate in front of all 5 of us - turns out, we all enjoyed ONE ENORMOUS slice of this incredibly moist, layered chocolate confection. I chose this restaurant for us based on previous reviews of this cake, and let me tell you - it delivered.

We were greeted warmly and at least three times on our way to the table. This was an indication of the quality of the service: warm, thoughtful, and attentive.

For drinks, I decided on a cocktail. From the specialty menu I ordered a whiskey fig concoction. It came with a thyme sprig. I found it alcoholicky and tart. I couldn't get much of the fig taste. I think I would give that a pass if I dined again there.

We ordered the wedge salad with Stilton cheese. Since we were splitting the appetizer, they helpfully cut it in the back for us. I found it nicely done and the cheese was flavorful. The only point for improvement was that I prefer a wedge a bit colder, but that really is a nitpick. 

For dinner, I had the bone-in cheese encrusted filet and my wife had the lobster rigatoni. My filet al forno was perfectly cooked and cheese was nicely crusted and carmelized. My wife didn't find the rigatoni to her taste, it was a bit too fishy, although properly cooked and just the right amount of sauce.

For a side dish we decided on the asparagus with béarnaise, and it was great! Nicely prepared and tasty. Usually I hate asparagus but this one was fantastic.

For dessert we split a banana tart and it was very good as well. We were looking for something a little different and it did not disappoint.

I wouldn't say great or outstanding, but good nevertheless. Our sides were potato puree, which was decent and creamed spinach, skip this. 
The GF ordered a bone-in ribeye. She likes her steak well-done and was disappointed to get her ribeye charred. She sent it back. A manager or supervisor did come over to check on us and inform her that it will be about 30mins. The GF didn't like her FYI tone and decide not to get the steak at all. Then the GM came over to smooth things over and comped us glasses of wine, birthday shots, and the 24 layer chocolate cake. Cake is huge and decent. Nice gesture by the GM.

Main course: We ordered a filet with a scallop and blue cheese topping with a side of mushrooms. We'll start with the good, the scallops were delicious, our medium rare steak was over cooked and dry with far less quality beef you would expect for the price. The mushrooms were so salty we each took one bite and spit them out.

However, we ordered goose fat fries which the waiter forgot or didn't hear my husband when he ordered it.  Nevertheless, we asked about it and it ended up coming during the last part of our meal. 

 Now let me get to the steak.  We ended up sharing a 28 day dry aged rib eye.  On the advice of the waiter, he said to order the steak ""medium"" with pink in the middle vs ""medium-rare"" which he said would mean that the steak would still be dark pink and cool in the middle.  BIG MISTAKE!  I don't exaggerate when I say that the steak was TOUGH as cardboard and it had to literally saw through the steak to get a piece off.  Also there is this extremely salty and peppery crust on the steak that added to the dryness to the steak.  Also, the goose fat potatoes were also very dry with a tough crust around it.  Interesting enough, that was also very salty.

The only saving grace is the truffle creamed spinach.  This dish is delicious!

448797,2017-02-15,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"My wife and I are in Vegas celebrating her 50th Birthday. I saw the very good Yelp reviews regarding this steakhouse so booked reservations several days ago using Open Table App leaving note regarding special birthday celebration. 

We arrived on time for our 6:30pm reservation they made references to my wife's birthday. (Unfortunately did not mean anything since the restaurant does not comp birthday desserts).  So far everything is going well and were seated then ordered our meal. 

We started with the Mixed Field Greens which we shared and had an adequate portion for the both of us. The Sherry vinaigrette was good. 

The Main Entree meal we ordered was the Porter House Steak for two. My wife and I agreed this was the best steak we've ever eaten. 

We ordered the Potato Romanoff as a side dish along with Garlic Sautéed Green Beans. These two sides were outstanding with twice baked gratin potatoes and the perfectly sautéed crisp green beans in olive oil and garlic. 

Also ordered the Lobster Thermador in which the lobster that was placed back into the shell then baked again was pretty tough. I did enjoy the claws on top which were fried in a tempura batter. Advised the waiter regarding the toughness of the lobster meat but he basically ignored me and evidently did not inform management since he did not remove from my bill or make any attempt to deal with the issue. I've been to many restaurants that will remove a bad portion of a meal off the bill or workout an equitable arrangement that resolved the issue. Didn't want to cause a scene on my wife's birthday. I would normally handle these issues more vigorously if not initially heard since I'm paying for a service and want the best in return. 

Dessert we ordered was the Carmelized Banana Tart which was very delicious. Of course they did not comp the dessert for her birthday but in light of the the lobster issue should have been done. 

Overall the food was very good except the lobster. Disappointed they did not reach out to resolve this issue in a fair and equitable way. Hope management reads this review and contacts me to resolve this issue. I still tipped the waiter appropriately even though he did not handle my concerns properly. Only gave 3 Stars should have been 5 Star but when a business doesn't not listen their customers concerns and ignores them leaves no choice.",3rctLJeiR9cf9DFEcpAJvw,1,0,3,colGH5Nm1C0IkXa_gL4mPg

Of course we had the 24-layer chocolate cake again and couldn't finish it between the both of us. I'm not really a sweets or cake lover, but I always enjoy that cake.

While the steaks remain fantastic, many of the little things that gave the restaurant its charm -- both in New York and Vegas -- have changed for the worse.

One obvious example is the Gorgonzola fondue. This was once the ultimate side item pleasure in the restaurant -- a cheap thrill, if you will, both on its own and as a decadent ""dip"" for your steak. (The servers and bartenders would ask if you wanted to keep it around, and recommend you do so.) You can still see the fondue mentioned prominently as a feature on the Yelp and TA reviews. Alas, it's a victim of corporate menu-engineering. Too cheap, even as it was a word of mouth item that gave Strip House its wry reputation.

Like the fondue, other minor things have changed that once gave Strip House its own unique charm. The lights? A little brighter. (You'll eat faster and order more.) The music? A little louder and BPMs a little higher. (You'll eat faster and order more.) The service? A little more... perfunctory, even while front-of-house staff remains on the whole talented, warm, and hard-working.

If these sound like nitpicks, they certainly are. But hunks of prime meat in a broiler are a commodity unless infused with some charm. And as Strip House is stripped of its own, it becomes just another very good steak house on par with many others -- that was once something great.",Bu928C1Xx-dedQ6BRWKWiQ,1,0,3,SaeEhNmGndWEb-fOfrmqgA

We have a 13 year old child who is severely allergic to milk, eggs and beef. He is very rarely allowed to eat anything from any restaurant, as every utensil must be thoroughly cleaned, hands cleaned prior to cooking his food, after touching other foods, and distance kept between items is also a must, or something horrible could happen.
We asked to speak to the chef, and he promptly came out to discuss our concerns. He was very thorough, asked what he was allergic to, and helped us choose the perfect dish for our son. He assured us that he takes food allergies very seriously, and even had a separate area to prepare his food. He was able to safely eat the squash, with a huge main dish of chicken.
We ordered the steak and lobster, asparagus, and potatoes....Let me tell you, the food was out of this world fantastic! The potatoes had the most amazing flavor,  the lobster was superb, and I have never had more fresh, wonderful tasting asparagus in my life! The steak was also fabulous! By far our favorite was the potatoes. 
The fact that our son could be included in enjoying a delicious meal with our family made everything perfect for all of us.

Unfortunately the service staff ruined the experience. 
The hostess refused to give us silverware for our dessert that we got to go. 
I asked if I could have a fork and she rudely told me to call room service... 
I had to ask for a manager and he came out in a huff and handed me a fork. I let him know I would make sure I would leave it in the room... He replied the hotel (planet Hollywood) would steal it..

I now have mixed feelings. I am a steak lover. I have pretty much checked out the most popular steak restaurants and thought the steak at NYC Strip House was by far, top 3. The steak in LV was a bit tough for me (I ordered medium rare). The mac and cheese was too cheesy and a bit bland. The cream spinach side was way too salty. My pinot noir was great. My gf loved her lobster pasta (it was pretty good). The overall ambiance is nice, but our waiter lacked personality. He was so serious!

For starters we had the crab cake and it was pretty big and very good!  It was a very good appetizer.

For entrees I had the veal shank and it was delicious.  It was cooked perfectly.  

My boyfriend had the salmon and he liked it.  I don't like salmon, but he said it was delicious.

For sides we had the truffled mac and cheese and it was SO GOOD!!!!! OMG!!!!! 

We also got steamed asparagus and a side of Bearnaise sauce to dip it in.  Super yum!

For dessert we got the creme brulee and it was just okay.

I would have given this place five stars but we ordered a bottle of wine with a 2008 vintage and they brought out a 2009 instead.  When we called them out on it, they said they just got the shipment in that day and didn't have time reprint the menus.  I don't believe them.

Other than that, everything was great and I know that some people yelped badly about the waitstaff taking a long time, but when you go to a super fancy place it is standard for service to be slow so you have time to drink your wine and enjoy your food.

One of my favorite places to eat when home is the Strip House downtown.  I love the decor and the illusion of stepping back in time with the velvet walls and vintage photos  I did not want to ruin that experience by experimenting with Strip House Las Vegas.  

We decided to gamble and give it try in the hopes that it would not be an over the top glitzy Vegas version of a place we love so much. On first approach, I could see flat screen TV and my heart sank.  I was pleased to see that they were just in the bar area and not viewable from the dining area.  Our hostess was very gracious, asked us where we were from, made pleasant small talk and sat us at a booth.  

We were greeted by our server John.  It was obvious that he has been in the service industry for many years because he was courtesy and knowledgeable not only of the menu but had committed the specials to memory.   He described each dish with his own personal experience and interpretation of what the chef was attempting to do.

John had suggested a bottle of wine which I would not usually lean towards...but the gamble was paying off already so we went with it and it was an excellent choice.  I usually don't order the specials because I am very particular about what I want and go to the places where I know it would be perfect.

In this case, John had beautifully described a bone in Filet Mignon with parmesan crust sitting atop a balsamic reduction.  The steak arrived and it was cooked to perfection and as complex and delicious as he had described.  

During the meal the manager came to the table and we explained that our dining experience to that point had been excellent because of the attention to detail and prompt service of the wait staff especially our server.  

John suggested and provided at the end of the meal a banana and caramel dessert which was not something I would order but proved to be outstanding.  

All in all our beloved NYC Strip House experience will be enhanced knowing that each time we travel to Vegas there is a home away from home with the same quality of service and five star dining.  Well done Vegas............NYC should be proud!",bY3fvsyTxmCONYd1PK_qKA,3,0,5,QDGgYcXtU8JJwgPZ8IBv8Q

The hubs took me here on Friday night. 

LOCATION: Mezzanine of Planet Hollywood, next to Koi.
DECOR: Very cool, vintage-inspired, lots of creepy/cool boudoir-type photos.
SEATING: Wtf - no booths? Seriously, all they have are those half-table, half-booth deals where one person gets shafted because they have to sit in a chair while you relax in a booth.
SERVICE: Pretty great. Water was refilled frequently, food came out in reasonable increments, etc. 

Now what you really want to know...
BREAD: Pretzel bread, sesame roll and regular roll type deal. Pretzel bread was the best. Whipped butter was good too. 
SHOTS: They gave us these shots of potato soup with an herbal garnish. Yum. I could've had 5 more of those. Would've ordered a bowl if it was on the  menu.
STEAKS: Two Filet Mignons. I ordered mine medium, but it looked more like medium well. Still it was soft and flavorful, so no real complaints. BUT! - if you don't love black pepper, tell them to go easy on it. I love it so it was fine, but the steak really had a bite to it.
SIDES: Mac and cheese and garlic fries. For $10-$12 each I was expecting bigger portions and fancier presentation. The fries were just OK, kind of reminded me of Nathan's for some reason. Mac n cheese was good, very thick and creamy. 
DESSERT: Skipped it. 
DRINKS: Had a Cosmopolitan which was OK but nothing to write home about.

THE VERDICT: Great place to take a date, and yummy food. Quite pricey at $40+ per steak and $10+ per side. For that price the food basically meets expectations but doesn't quite exceed them.",6whqC84h3uOvz9xtqjrrUQ,1,0,4,IOx52qfji8Oqks0MWNroPA

It had us concerned, but thankfully once the large group beside us was served it improved. Our waiter was attentive the rest of the meal.

We snacked on bread while we looked over the menu. After making our selections, we were brought an amuse bouche of potato soup. It was smooth as silk, but it had the starchy potato taste. It puzzled my palette... in a good way.

We had a crab cake to start. It was nicely presented, with lots of crab - it'd better at $17. It was pretty good, but I prefer them spicy. My husband had the rack of lamb and I had the filet, we shared a side of their Romanoff potatoes. The steak and lamb were both very good, juicy and tender with a nice crust. The chops were the second best we've had. Aureole remains at the top. Frank enjoyed the potatoes, but they were too sour for my liking.

The steak is amazing.  Other restaurants may be able to cook a steak perfectly like the Strip House, but they do not have the same seasoning.  It tasted like a salt/garlic blend of seasonings that enhanced the steak to a point that it was unlike any I have had.  I would be able to tell you more about the seasoning if I could have seen it in light...why is it so dark in here?

Decor and atmosphere reminded me of a place that is nice and dressy, but also a place where a major mob hit would have taken place.  That somehow appealed to me.

With the portions they give, I took leftovers home and had the best steak and eggs and potatoes I have ever had in my life.
So, I was surprised and excited, after doing a search on the net, to find a couple of youtube type videos on the Strip House chefs doing their famous Potatoes Romanoff recipe; one being on the Today show.
I listened and played the videos over and over until I got all the details to the letter and number.  I then proceeded to make these wonderful potatoes only to be incredibly disappointed at my results.  And, there were repeated attempts and all failures to capture the wonderful Strip House Potatoes Romanoff.
One video said 15 minuets in the oven, the other said 25.  I tried both and even longer and every time the shallots came out crunchy and undercooked.  After multiple attempts, I decided to sweat the shallots a little.  This was better but not good enough.  Baked the potatoes, let them cool and rest for a day, grated and
got good quality sour cream and white cheddar, and of course the russet potatoes, but none of my efforts seemed to pull it off.

Since we were staying in the Planet Hollywood, our CFO said let's eat here as he ate here the night before.  

Strip Steak is in the Mezzanie level next to Koi which is a restaurant/club.  Strip Steak definitely has the feel of a steak house, much like Morton's or Ruth Chris where it's dark inside with wooden chairs, booths and etc.

I had a taste of the tuna, avocado salad which was pretty good however my colleague said there was too much avocado.  I ordered a mac and cheese which was decent and a 28 day dry aged rib eye.  The steak was on the dryer side but it was delicious.  Not sure what seasoning they used but it definitely had a lot of flavor.  I usually don't enjoy steak out in a restaurant but this one changed my mind in the sense that I should get steak next time I eat out.  It could also be that I was super hungry because I didn't eat all day.  I think it was the former though.

I ordered a strawberry mojito which was fantastic with pieces of strawberry in it.  As for why this place gets four stars and not five?  The service.

I've been wanting to dine here since I moved to Vegas and sadly I have to report: don't expect service or food to be out of this world. If this is the closest steakhouse to you it'll do the job. Steaks were on the higher end of prices -$50 for an 8oz filet and the menu online isn't up to date so expect more choices on the menu when you arrive for the non-beef eaters. 

In regards to service it was terrible for the high price tag of this restaurant. You expect more with these fine dining restaurants. The server forgot to bring a soft drink and steak knives until we reminded him of the missing items. There were only 3 other tables in the restaurant so not sure what the excuse was. I was certain he went home for the night because we asked the server assistant for everything and even they took awhile to bring the items. 

The food was pretty average. Like i said it's part of a corporate chain. The filet mignon wasn't ground breaking and the side of potatoes au gratin was just mashed red potatoes with melted cheese on top. To make matters worse the mashed potatoes were dry and stiff. The chicken entree was pretty good and a good sized portion to be honest.

It has dark lighting with bold red walls (pay attention to the design in the wall paper, same pattern used on the napkins) with burlesque style, black and white photos all over the walls.  Same goes for the bathrooms.  Very cool looking.
However, great decor doesn't make up for an overpriced, mediocre steak.  For the price I paid, this steak just doesn't measure up.  Don't get me wrong, the steak was good, it's just that I've had much better steaks for less.
I ordered a 14 oz filet mignon and when I was done, my response was ""ehh.""  It lacked any real flavor and wasn't as tender as one would expect.  This was pretty much the response from my entire party (8 people).
All of the sides that we ordered (spinach, green beans, asparagus, & creamed corn) were excellent, specifically the creamed corn.  One member of my party commented that it was the best creamed corn he had ever had and we all agreed.
The service was good, but it was very slow.  It took a long time to bring out drinks and then the food after they were ordered, otherwise, they didn't miss a beat.  I think the entire wait staff has obsessive compulsive disorder to some extent.  Every time one of us would leave the table (restroom or smoke break), any server that was passing by would immediately pick up the missing persons napkin and re-fold it into a triangle and place it on the table.  This may not seem strange, but the frequency of it was almost comical.  I even left the table a couple of times, just to test them and each time, I came back to a folded napkin.

To sum it up, great decor, great sides, mediocre steak.  Will I be back?  Definitely NO.

They have old time models and pin-up style pictures on the walls, the restaurant is dimly lit, and the red accents pop! This is a very ""sexy"" and possibly romantic restaurant. 

The bread on the table is actually pretty good. I have a piece of the cheese topped bread and the pretzel bread. Both very good. For dinner I had the 8oz filet Oscar style and a side of twice baked potatoes. The steak was very good but it had a strong seasoned taste to it that isn't ""standard"" when you order a steak. I also felt like more Bearnaise sauce could have been given since I paid $18 to make my steak Oscar style. (I didn't say anything though) Finally, the twice baked potatoes were delicious and they give you enough to share.

Even though I was so full after dinner, I wanted to try dessert so I had a couple bites of the raspberry sorbet. Delicious and a very pretty presentation.

Overall, this is a nice steakhouse, just not my favorite in town. If you're seeing a show or at Planet Hollywood to gamble, this is a good choice.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,1,0,4,Y619NIvHKccvGxPJ314ipg

It's a little harder to find since it's inside a casino and then you need to rent a camel and a guide to find it from there. Bring water or your alcoholic beverage of choice to tide you over till you find it. Professor Livingston I presume?! No? You're just a dancer? Where is The Strip House?
I've received top notch service here every time. The wait staff has just the right amount of personable cheeriness and attentiveness without constantly interrupting. The Strip House can get super busy so plan a head.
The decor is awesome here! Low lights, red highlights and vintage photos of pin-ups/nude models. It has a real old school classy vibe... if you are seated in the back it almost feels like a speak easy.
The steaks here are magnificent. Both my father and my buddy both were wholly impressed by the steaks. The side dishes I've tried have a bit to be desired (I did... mac n' cheese and 2 nonstandard potato dishes) so next time I'll stick with the standard mashed potatoes. They make good strong drinks, have a decent selection of more expensive sipping alcohols and carry a good stock of vino. 
The desserts here are a bit underwhelming in size but they are very well made and quite tasty. No meal is complete with out dessert!
I feel like I would be more suited to smoking a cigar here and enjoying a the ambiance. It's quite comfy and welcoming here and this joint has become one of my faves in LV. I'll definitely stop here for some burnt cow sacrifices whenever I'm in town.

No one in our group was impressed by our experience. I ordered the Porterhouse for two to share. It was cooked beautifully but lacked flavor and was therefore overpriced. My friend and I eat fine dining, particularly upscale steakhouses, quite often so we have some idea what steak should taste like. The lobster bisque was good but nothing to write home about. Our mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were unfairly small portions for our table and the mac n cheese was overwhelming with the truffle flavor. We were all disturbed by the harsh flavor. The mashed potatoes were bland. Sarah's salmon was cooked appropriately but the pesto fluff drowned out any real flavor. Even the bread was subpar. I would expect better from a restaurant in this price range. It was by far the most disappointed steakhouse experience the four of us had ever experience both individually and cumulatively and then to pay $400 was the ultimate slap in the face. I have no idea how this restaurant was rated so highly by other diners or culinary spectators because I think it was the biggest bogus culinery hipe of my life! Overpriced and not impressive! I would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE! It actually put a damper on all of our moods the remainder of the night after having spent so much money and no dining satisfaction.

We had the shrimp cocktail and oysters on the half shell. Both were okay; the oysters didn't look too appealing but were indeed fresh. We shared the bone-in rib eye and their filet & lobster tail dish. The kitchen had split our orders without us asking which was nice of them.

We were able to get a reservation without any issues the day of the show.  We were seated promptly at a nice table in the back of the restaurant and greeted almost immediately by our waiter, Brent.  He took the time to explain the specialties for the evening and he took our drink order just as soon as we were ready, We had a couple of questions about the menu, and he covered everything expertly - we were thinking about the Chateaubriand for two, however after some discussion, that really wasn't going to to be the best option for us.  My mom wound up ordering the 8oz Filet and I ordered the filet as well, just in the larger 12oz size.   As is the tradition in a good steak house, all of the sides are served ala carte - we chose the whipped potatoes and the asparagus for our two sides; it turned out that both of these were excellent choices!  

As we waited for the steaks to be cooked, fresh bread and butter was provided.  I think that we ate all of the bread before the steaks were served - delicious.  The reason to dine at a good steak house is of course, the steaks.   Both of our filet's were cooked perfectly; tender, juicy and pretty much delicious.   I've had a steak with more flavor, however this one was pretty close to the top of the class for a filet, overall.  I'd have no hesitation to order a filet here again.  It's worth noting that the price difference between the 8oz and the 12oz filet was only $8 - it would be hard to pass up the larger steak for such a little difference in price!  We also ordered both the Béarnaise sauce and the Bordelaise sauce - I had never had Bordelaise sauce before, and I was really glad that I tried it!   I tasted the Béarnaise sauce as well, however I used the Bordelaise sauce almost exclusively.  
 
The service was what you would expect for this price point -  very professional, very knowledgeable about the menu and the food.  We never felt rushed, nor did we feel like we were missing something when we should have had it.  I did notice that some other Yelpers have mentioned the service as a weak point - this simply was not our experience.   If I had a suggestion for improvement, it's that the manager could have been more proactive about coming over to address the tables and ask how everything is going with the meal.  I actually called a manager over to compliment the food and the service - he almost seemed surprised that I had great things to say.  If the gentleman was regularly interacting with tables, maybe that wouldn't be the case.  

Overall, the Strip House was a very good experience for the quality of the food, the great service and even the price paid.  It's not inexpensive, make no mistake about that - however you get what you pay for sometimes - this was one of them.",yPlyuqt05rokczXb4_qxtg,0,0,4,Zd01VkD-ilVLV6HWKck6ig

Service was outstanding. Everyone was very attentive and as a team busted their butts to serve a very busy restaurant on a Friday evening. The decor is like stepping back in time to an old Hollywood era and as I've already mentioned I just loved it. 

The food wasn't great and we didn't finish anything other than the steak & potato purée. Let's begin with the bread service that was fresh out of the oven and we loved the room temperate butter which I always appreciate because so many restaurants miss that simple detail. Onto the Caesar salad, my least favorite item of the night. We asked for no anchovies which they did but that's all you could taste in the dressing and the fresh poached egg wasn't working with the salad for me. I LOVE poached eggs but not on a salad. As for the meat, decided to split a 20oz New York Strip and it was good. They're known for their method of salt & pepper char which wasn't my favorite. The quality of the meat itself was great but the salt & pepper were both overwhelming. We decided to add some balsamic glaze and parmesan cheese which helped. The whipped potatoes were great but the $29 side of lobster mac & cheese was incredibly fishy. I also found the cheese sauce to be far too dense. 

Ended on a sweet note with their baked Alaska and once again didn't hit the spot with me. The brûléed meringue left me with an unusual aftertaste just after two bites. 

So overall I didn't hate it but I also didn't love it. 5 stars in decor and service and a solid 2 - 3.5 on cuisine.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,30,33,3,L9EssV5M4W59Zxwf8XjQLw

I had the special (22 oz boneless ribeye) and the $16 chocolate cake... the steak was great, as I expected, but the cake was awful....  Allow me to elaborate: The cake tasted frost bitten and like it was cut with a rusted knife. And the night after was not good for me at all. I think that the lacking in food quality might have made me the way that I feel today.... 

Also the service was horrible! The first waiter was rude because I asked if I could have a separate check for the drinks and his reply was ""no""... that was it. Also our female waitress acted like she was going to cry, as if she had some personal problems. She was not having any of the small talk from our table. 

I know that our average age was 25 but we're there looking for a great meal, so overall we paid $260 for 5 meals when it might as well been 5 dogs from the weinershniztle.

Myself, my husband and 5 other friends of ours went to Strip House for my birthday dinner this past weekend while staying at Planet Hollywood.  The hotel was awesome, loved it!  Strip house on the other hand?  Absolute disappointment!  

Our reservation was made for 10pm for 7 people.  We arrived at 10 but had a few stragglers so had to wait to be seated until all members were present (which is already annoying especially since they took my credit card number to make the reservation).  We were seated probably around 10:15pm; ordered as soon as our completely incompetent server decided to oblige us with his presence and proceeded to wait another HOUR AND A HALF for our food while several tables who came in well after us enjoyed their meals.  After the hour and a half passed and our plans for the night were slowly but surely being single-handedly sabotaged by this restaurant  I got up and asked to speak with the restaurant manager.  I informed her that we were sat over an hour ago (closer to two at this point), that we still didn't have our food and that several tables who sat after us were already eating.  Her response was unimpressive, at best.  She offered no real apology instead just said she'd go check on our food.

After a few minutes our degenerate server came out with our food and this awesomely inconsiderate and rude comment; ""I'm sorry you FELT like it took so long"".  No, I'm sorry, but 2 hours is a long time in anyone's world to be waiting for food you're paying $400 for.  

As far as the food; I can't honestly say it was worth the money I spent on it or the amount of my life I wasted waiting for it.  I will absolutely never go back to Strip House.  I wouldn't go back if they paid me.  The service and the food were unacceptable for the price you're paying for it; I've had better experiences at Denny's.

2035909,2009-03-23,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Strip House serves very good food. I enjoyed the 22-oz. ribeye (cut me some slack, it's only 16 oz. without the bone), and my husband had the filet mignon. Both were excellent and didn't require any of the special sauces you can add (particularly the ribeye, which was appropriately marbled for flavor). Accompaniments like the truffled cream spinach and goose fat potatoes were as good as they sound. Bread served and replenished before the meal was hot and tasty, and the chef even threw in an amuse bouche (a pureed potato soup of some sort).

So why not 5 stars? First off, service was slow. Diners who sat after we did were served before - not sure why. In Vegas where time stands still, this is less of an issue than it typically would be, but nevertheless, it was strange. And with a 10pm reservation, it seems unnecessary. Second, service seemed slightly amateur. Everyone was friendly, but there were little snafus a restaurant like this should never exhibit, like the wine being opened without a dinner napkin, and the amuse bouche being delivered twice. Third, as much as I wanted to love the atmosphere, something just seemed a little off. Maybe it's the Planet Hollywood resort itself, but it bordered on almost tacky - almost. For some reason, in the private room next to us, Oprah was airing on their TV - very weird. And even the choice of flooring...I don't know...it felt like a linoleum diner floor. 

Those things aside, this is a good spot, as my 4 stars imply, and many will love it (as evidenced by these reviews).

We were immediately led to our table.  Our server Amanda was right there to tell us the specials.  I could have thought there were 17 of them but she recited them all without note cards or anything, keeping good eye contact while telling us about appetizer specials, entree specials, and dessert specials.  She even mentioned the per-pound cost of the market-cost lobster.

We're two guys on a conference trip so steaks were the thing.  We got a NY Strip steak and a surf & turf (6oz filet + lobster tail).  EVERYTHING was delicious, perfectly cooked, right temperature, great presentation, wonderful.  We started with oysters app and after 6 went and got 6 more...  

We ordered a zin, and Amanda delivered that perfectly, like a master somm, kept it off the table, opened it expertly, didn't suggest anyone sniff or do any other weirdness with the cork, and poured it for tasting and consumption.  It was great.  Her service of it was great.

At the end we were offered dessert.  Nagh.  Great service. Great food.  Kitchen did 100% and Amanda did 100%.  Kenny the manager came out when we asked for him so we could let him know we were impressed.

This is a cut above an an order of magnitude better than Elements....

The steak is as good as you'd expect at a place like this. The only sides that stood out to me were the green beans and sauteed mushrooms. That other fancy shit failed.

2178456,2013-02-19,1,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"The Skiiny: mid-level quality steakhouse (3) slow service at times which is not good for a place supposedly of this caliber (3) high prices for what it is, I'd skip this joint(2.5).

We decided to venture here for our anniversary dinner because we heard of the 24 layer chocolate cake. Seeing as how it would be a little bit odd to go to a steakhouse for chocolate cake (hee hee hee), we decided to eat dinner here too.

We ordered a Caesar salad ($14), a bone-in rib eye ($54), their roasted chicken ($29), truffled spinach $12 and their corn special $10. We then finished this off with their chocolate cake. 

I love Caesar salads. I especially love it when they use real anchovies and hit it with a good dose of lemon like they do at really good quality steakhouse. Striphouse is not one of those places. Completely generic Caesar dressing flavored this dish which makes me wonder how they can justify charging $14 for this. Oh right - it's the Strip. Whatever... I would not order this here. 

Their roasted chicken was definitely below par compared to other similarly priced steakhouses. The key thing is a nice crisp skin of the chicken. There was none of that happening here. As a matter of fact, I stripped off all of the skin because it just wasn't worth it. It was seasoned adequately however I expect a $29 chicken dish to be much better than this. It was just too ordinary to justify this expense.

Their bone-in rib eye was adequate but again, overrpriced for the quality. Perhaps I'm a stickler for what I like on a steak. I found they added too many spices to their steak. A good quality steak needs only very few  ingredients- salt/pepper and a nice oil to cook it in - otherwise you aren't going to taste the steak itself. On top of that, the crust wasn't quite up to par either with a slightly darker hue that what I would expect the perfect steak to be (gold brown). Plus the steak itself didn't have quite the marbling I would have expected for a $54 steak with lots of chunky pieces of fat around the meat. For me, a good quality steak is all about the integration.

To serve it with their house ""steak sauce"" - which was basically cocktail sauce (cocktail sauce = ketchup + horseradish) - kind of speaks to the level of what we are dealing with. People only add this crap to meat if it ain't that good...and it isn't.

Their corn special that day was roasted corn sauteed with bacon, red pepper baked with some parmesan breadcrumbs on top. I think the breadcrumbs was a little overkill and added an unpleasant grittiness to the dish. The corn itself was a little too tough for my liking and I wouldn't recommend this dish.

The truffled spinach was probably the highlight of our meal. Rich, umami-ish, it comes in a small pot which is brimming filled with this luxurious concoction. It doesn't look like much but once you've dug in, it's actually quite a large serving size because it is so heavy.

Finally, the long awaited chocolate cake. A rather large portion, it reminded me of the that scene from Ronald Dahl's Matilda - you know where that kid has to eat this massive chocolate cake all on his lonesome? Well, anyway, despite the size, the question is - is this the best chocolate cake ever? I would venture to say no. The cake itself was good - not too sweet with good quality cocoa flavor - but wasn't quite as moist as what I expected. The thin layers of chocolate cream in between helped a bit to counter this. Overall not a bad chocolate cake and for it's size, it isn't a bad bargain for $14. It just wasn't quite as awesome as what I'd imagined it would be. 

Overall given the price range, this place is definitely not worth the money. Although the food was palatable, for the price you pay, it should be way more than that. Really I think it is more a 2.5 kind joint but I will bump it up to a 3 for the spinach and cake. So even though it rates a 3 star,  I'd give this one a pass.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,3,mPLf9jOuMEp9YDZ271nEFg

We went here for Christmas dinner this past December. It's our new Xmas tradition to go out to a fancy dinner just the 2 of us on Christmas night. I was a little worried when we first arrived, as the hostesses seemed very LA-hostessish, and the decor was very red and very dark. Although the hostesses looked LA, they were very pleasant. When dining outside of Los Angeles, I find the service experience to be so much more tolerable and deeply rooted in customer service. The waiter and the bus boy for our table were both outstanding. Attentive, friendly, and on top of everything.

The food was some of our favorite food in Las Vegas so far. Everything was decadent and delicious. 

Everything we got was a highlight, hopefully there's enough room to write about everything! 

The drink I got was so different and tasty! I got a chocolate martini, but instead of vodka or gin, it was made with Patron XO tequila that has a bit of a coffee flavor, but is definitely tequila. There is Godiva chocolate liquor in it, and the rim is covered in chocolate covered bacon crumbles. OH. EM. GEE. AMAZING!
The bread basket that each table gets comes with some amazing breads, but the star of the basket to me were the pretzel bread rolls. It was like eating a big, plump, less greasy gourmet soft pretzel with butter. I could have eaten tons of them. 

For our appetizers my husband got the Oysters which were spilt into East Coast and West Coast Oysters. He loved them and couldn't believe he was able to get such fresh seafood in the middle of the Las Vegas and all of its lack of bodies of water! 
I got the Roasted Bacon, with arugala and russian dressing. Holy wow! I can't even put in to words how amazingly spectacularly delicious and rich that dish was. I just can't. All I can say is, if you even remotely like bacon...GET THIS APPETIZER!!

The steaks were cooked perfectly, and as tender as butter. We were very pleased. 
We got the potatoes romanoff and garlic green beans on the side, and both were amazing as well. 

We got a wonderful bananas foster tart for dessert. Although we were stuffed, we couldn't stop eating the dessert. Like everything else that night, it too, was amazing! 

I highly recommend this steak house. I know there are a lot to choose from just on that block of the strip alone, but I promise you will not be disappointed if you choose this one for your next amazing Las Vegas meal!",QHenXTkDXKrqW2UOokkwrg,0,0,5,oX3-gszdQBrH90QyCFYbqA

I came on a Saturday night with some friends that were in town visiting and they were staying at Planet Hollywood. There were not a lot of people inside dining, so I was skeptical, but after everything we had, our group enjoyed our meal.

We started with the large seafood tower (would definitely recommend this for large groups) that came with an assortment of shrimp cocktail, oysters, crab legs, lobster tail, and other ceviches. Other notable appetizers included the crab cake, tuna tartare, and lobster bisque. We got a bunch of sides to share with the steaks including the mashed potatoes, string beans, mushrooms, and broccoli. Now for the steaks - definitely surprised with the quality of the steaks, but I would suggest asking them to go light on the salt - it was a little heavy for me. I got the porterhouse for two (shared it with my friend) and it was cooked a very good medium rare. The steaks also came with a roasted garlic, one of my favorite accompaniments to a steak. Finally, dessert - a baked alaska was ordered for the table to share and enjoy.

When I'm paying prices like those of Strip House, I do expect a higher level of food and service, and this place just did not deliver. Our server did his job, but the execution was perfunctory and seemed really rushed. It was laughable when he referred to my friend and I by our first names after cashing us out. I will give kudos to our hostess, who was lovely. Of her own accord, she suggested that we be seated away from a rather noisy table. 

Regarding the food, my friend's steak was amazing. Mine was not. We both had the small filet, and while hers was gorgeous, mine was really done past medium and nothing special. I know perfectly well that any good Caesar salad dressing includes anchovies, but Strip House's version was WAY too heavy on the fish.

2290816,2012-09-25,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"We were here for the famous Thuy Nga Paris By Night 106th episode recording and show.  For those not in the know the show is the longest running Vietnamese American music variety show famous the world over...among the Vietnamese and Vietnamese diaspora. Enough of the cultural/history lesson.  

My girlfriend had an excellent idea of spending our time at the Planet Hollywood early so we would not have to fight with about 7,500 other people who were going to show up at the same time crowding up the casino parking lot and valet so we went there about 3 hours prior to the show, she played some slots, I walked around scouting the place making sure we knew where the entrance to the show was.  We initially wanted French but couldn't find it on our smart phone that there was one at the Planet.  So we settled for a steak joint which I was not too excited about since I have high cholesterol but do enjoy my steaks. But as Californians recently deprived of foie gras my girlfriend was aching for some but oh well.  We should have researched it better before we left the house.

We were probably one of the first 2 couples there, we came in before it opened so we had to wait outside a bit and took pictures. Decor was very nice and elegant.  A bit dimly lit. 

She ordered a black cherry martini recommended by the waiter (wasn't that good but made a great pix with the GF that is still a screen saver on my phone. Oh, check out my profile picture, that's the big ol martini being mentioned). The waiter recommended a good slightly sweet white wine (which I like since I don't like my wine dry) as I knew we were heading into a seafood meal.  

We selected the full platter appetizer. It came with a spread of cold seafood and included oysters on the half shell, clams on the half shell, a couple of small pieces of king crab or something like that, very flavorful poke tuna/tuna tartar, seafood ceviche (too darn tangy) and I am sure shrimp cocktails. We also decided, wise choice by the GF, to split an order of the Chilean sea bass (I know, endanger this and that...look, it's their fault!...if Chilean Sea Bass didn't taste so darn good they would not be in danger of extinction, just kidding of course, but this is the first time I ordered it in over 4 years since my grandmother's 85th birthday so I am not arching over with guilt). Oh, we also ordered the creamed spinach with black truffles as a side...which we could in no way finish but it was great.

We managed to go to a steak house and not having to order the usual steaks so I was really happy about the alternatives.  But I think cholesterol count-wise I lost the battle to the creamed spinach because who knows how many sticks of butter was in that decadence side. It was that rich (and delicious) but after a while you couldn't eat any more.

I am rating this a bit low because I didn't like the fact that the waiter made me feel like I under spent. He was constantly trying to up sell that it would not be enough food then visibly disappointed when we did not want desert. Hey dude, we were stuffed and we had a show to catch, cholesterol to maintain and my weight to watch. =) He did manage to recommend a good white wine and the creamed spinach.",xxHoLH314TKXQEXU62skDw,1,0,4,zjJHShlK15s9bnsqIqJveQ

Then there's the fillet, cooked precisely the way I ordered.  Oh AND the sauteed spinach with bacon and truffle oil!! To die for!!!! My only complaint was the Caesar salad.  It wasn't just plain, it was sad and neglected! Very disappointing, especially for $14 a plate.

I liked the overall feel and decor. The service throughout the night was very good. Not excellent but very good. High class, pricy but most steak houses are.
We had a table of 5 so after we chose all our cuts of meat, all steak of course, we all chose a side. We managed to eat them all or most on the plates so keep in mind, they are of a decent portion size.
Steamed Asparagus - waste of money. They had no seasoning and were super thick and woody. They should have been thinner with some flavor - not everyone likes the Bearnaise sauce that comes with it.
Onion rings - Massive and cool presentation. They must be good as Arnie (Terminator) and company were a few tables from us and it looked like he was eating them too! That man can eat! 
My friend felt though that the onion rings were fried in the same oil in the kitchen as the fish and was turned off by this.
Mushrooms - for some reason one of our party asked for them well done and they came out blackened and charred as in ash burnt. So burnt that it was almost a joke. We said nothing and I think our friend felt bad for not just letting the chef do his thing.
Twice baked mashed potatoes - divine. I would have been happy with just a bowl of those!
There was another side but it was forgettable as it escapes me now... 
Bread and butter does come in baskets before the meal.
3 of us had filets - 2 of us were a tad let down. They do come out blackened which is fine but they are not seasoned properly. Of course, no seasonings on the table... for sure not the best steak I have ever had in my life. It did not melt in my mouth and tasted just OK. The men were happy with their NY strip and rib eye. All cooked to our liking which is important. Our other friend with the filet who is normally quite picky was very happy - so I think the idea of an amazing steak is subjective for sure. She also had room for the baked Alaska and wow, they do a great job on that if you are a dessert person. The chocolate ice cream is rich and decadent.
Figure that with your meal and a side dish plus 1 alcoholic drink - it is about $100 per person. OK for a splurge but this is Vegas and you just have to be better than the next steak house down the block which it wasn't.
Still had a good time here and thankfully our male server was down to earth, cute as a button with the best hair and was quite witty.

I would not say it was my favorite salad, it was a bit bland and didn't have many toppings in it. Next everyone at the table had steaks.  Two had the NY strip and I split a 12 ounce filet with another person at the table. The steaks came out and were cooked well. The meat melted in your mouth. The black pepper rub gets very spicy, it is great but if you don't prefer that much spice, the server said they are happy to make it without it. We shared a bottle of wine and one person had a martini. I will say the fact that he had to pay $1 per blue cheese olive after paying $17 for a martini was disappointing. I understand that the martinis will be high priced as this is a higher dollar restaurant, but paying per olive is a little cheap in my opinion.

2493999,2017-01-25,6,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"I shall call this post, a ""hairy"" situation. 

I was in Vegas for the last week working at AVN. I felt pretty victorious and wanted to celebrate the occasion at Strip House since I had dined there the last time I was in town and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Was seated at 9pm (my reservation time) in a nice booth and things were going great in the beginning. Our server was attentive and friendly and I was excited for the food. I tried to hold on to this moment later in the evening when I was pissed, but sigh, more on that in a bit. 

The food comes and I'm excited, and also starving because I basically worked all damn day without a proper meal. I ordered the 8oz filet mignon and a side of the duck fat potatoes. I was about 1/4 into my meal when I cut into the potato stack (which is crispy on the outside, soft and mashed potato-y on the inside) and I was treated to a rather disgusting surprise. 

A hair. AND NOT MY HAIR. 

Now, I was at AVN all week. I am not easily scared off by hair. But this hair was long, curly, and COOKED INTO THE BATTER.  I tried not to alarm the person I was with because I didn't want to ruin her meal, but I couldn't hide my facial expression as I figured out what had happened. 

I flagged over our server and quietly told him, ""hey look, I don't want to draw extra attention to the situation (since there were parties around us), but I found a hair in my food. Cooked into my food."" 

He was...not as apologetic or surprised as I thought he'd be. He was, oddly, flat in his apology, which irked me since I was purposely trying to tell him quietly to avoid ruining other people's experiences. He asked if I wanted another one (uh no, also it's like 10pm now) and asked about my steak, to which I told him that I didn't think I could finish my meal. Mind you, while this is happening, the pube is staring at me from my plate in front of me. His demeanor wouldn't have bothered me if it wasn't a big contrast to his friendly and attentive demeanor in the beginning of the evening. At his point, I offered to pay for the food I ate before-said incident.  

He took the plate away and I waited for a good 15-20 minutes for I don't know what. Finally a manager came, he apologized (which also seemed a bit flat) and offered us a complimentary dessert. He said our server would bring us a menu.

Here I wait another 15-20 minutes, at which point I see our server walk past us, and I also see him give a dessert menu to a nearby table. Our server doesn't come and at this point, I'd rather eat fast food then stay any longer. I flag down the manager and let him know that no one came by and that I'd actually just like the check. 

When our server comes by finally, I explain that the manager said he was meant to bring by a dessert menu, but we were going to pass on the offer and just wanted to go and pay our bill. The server then tells us he didn't bring a menu yet because they had to clear the table. I'm not sure if that's actually the policy or he was trying to cover up for the fact that he had forgotten, but either way, he could have updated us on what was going on. And honestly, there's no reason for us to be waiting so damn long.

As you can read in my other reviews, I can forgive a lot when it comes to restaurant service. Wrong orders, being mischarged, etc. as long as you are polite. But if I'm polite enough to tell you I found a fucking hair COOKED into my food and you are apathetic (at best), uhhh. No. Not okay at all. There is no reason why I was waiting for nearly another 45 minutes to get this shit resolved. 

 Then the bill comes. At this point, I'm thinking the meal will be comped because this was ridiculous. NOPE. It's nearly $100 with tip. Most expensive fucking hair I ever had. And trust me, I was working at AVN ALL WEEK.

2533820,2015-02-05,1,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"My visit to Vegas always has a high end steak place to try.  I hit some good ones and yet to give a 5 star until now.  In order to get that you have to cook the perfect steak, have a high quality rib eye and  have great service.  Perfect on all counts.

My brother taught me that the rib eye, not the filet migon is the best cut.  Sure the filet is tender, but a great quality rib eye has more fat, more flavor and is quite tender especially if the quality is top notched.  My rib eye hit on all marks.  If you want a Lexus, face it, you cannot pay for a price of a Chevy.  That goes with steaks too.  People's complaints about the expense is not warranted. Then, it must be medium rare, a hot red juicy center.  This was the quintessential rib eye.  The sides were equally tremendous as well.

Each good casino has a high end steak joint and this one belonged to Planet Hollywood.  If you don't look up from the casino floor, you could miss it.  And if you think the Strip House is a gentlemen's club (an oxymoron), you may ignore it.  Don't.  Take the escalator to the second deck and be prepared to be served the perfect rib eye.  I hope future repeat trips give me equal performance.  If they do, I may not try another place in town.

Strip House, located near other fine dining inside Planet Hollywood, is an upscale, classy, yet modern and semi-sexual style restaurant. The lighting is dim, and after 8:00 PM the volume of the music increases. There are photographs from an earlier time frame of women in the nude, in a very presentable fashion. And the service is off the charts. There were literally people standing around, waiting for my plate to be empty so they could clear it, or my water to be anything less than full, so they could top it off. Impressive.  
Between my other half and I, we shared shrimp and crab cocktail, thick bacon, a ribeye, a filet, a side dish full of potatoes, cheese, bacon, and chilies, I was literally in food heaven. I am not sure how I walked out of there, or how my dress still fit me after this. Truly one of the more memorable steak dinners I have had in Las Vegas. 
The ribeye, and the potato side were my two favorite dishes. The ribeye has a seasoned rub on it that truly emphasizes the steaks already great flavors.

I had oysters, the bone in NY Strip, and the chocolate cake with a double shot of espresso. Others in my party had the filet mignon and the boneless NY strip steak.

We shared the goose fat potatoes, warm garlic bread with gorgonzola fondue, black truffle creamed spinach, garlic herb french fries, and mac & cheese.

I needed to grab a bite after a long day at work.  I was staying at Planet Hollywood and didn't want to roam around the casino floor with the chaos that is Vegas.  I decided to walk into the strip house and sit at the bar.  

The bar tender was great - attentive but not overbearing.  While sitting there eating and enjoying my meal, a man walked up to the bar and ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go. GENIUS!!!!

Stuffed from my meal and cocktail...I simply didn't have room for dessert - but took a slice to go as well. As it was my first time ordering the cake, I had no idea how friggin' humongous the slice would be.  It had to have weighed at least 3-5lbs.

2650468,2016-02-27,4,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"I had a wonderful experience at the Striphouse in Houston years ago and had received a gift card for the restaurant. I was excited to use it, but was unable to do so before the Striphouse in Houston closed down due to real estate negotiations that fell through (their lease was up, I believe). I looked them up online and saw they had locations in Manhattan and Vegas, so I figured I would be able to use the card at some point in the future. As it turns out, the Vegas and Manhattan locations had been bought out by BR Guest (from The Glazier Group).

Of course, as a patron, I was blissfully unaware of this when I went to use the gift card at the Striphouse in Las Vegas. My dining companion and I went to the Las Vegas location and had a pleasant time -- we had some great cocktails (the Seasonal Cosmo and the Manhattan), some delicious oysters on the half shell, a very nice baby iceberg salad (the stilton cheese vinaigrette was yummy), and then the entrees -- a great bone-in rib eye and a surf-and-turf. The meat was generally nicely done, although the outside of my filet seemed a bit overcooked (yes, they specialize in this -- but it seemed this wasn't their best effort). We also got the black truffle creamed spinach and a spicy potatoes romanoff. The potatoes were a little too heavy on the sour cream, but the spinach was delicious.

Our waitstaff was very responsive, although there was a misunderstanding at some point (may have been my fault -- I asked for horseradish for the oysters and I thought he hadn't heard the first time because he came back with spoons, so I asked again). He seemed like a seasoned server who had been doing this for a long time. It was, generally, a good experience -- although the food wasn't as delicious as I remember it (everything was a tad overcooked and the flavors weren't quite as distinct as my initial experience) and the weird misunderstanding (that again, may have been my bad). When we got our check, I slipped my gift card in excitedly. I had waited so long to come back to the Striphouse after the one in Houston had closed down and I was finally getting a wonderful meal!

Turns out, the gift card was not valid at the restaurant. We were told there was nothing they could do in the restaurant and that we needed to contact BR Guest, their parent company. I did, expecting a favorable, understanding response. After all, we had spent a good bit of money that night -- and were thinking we would be repeat customers since we are much more proximate to Vegas now. However, as it turns out, there was nothing BR Guest could do either. They were incredibly polite, but pointed out that BR Guest had not purchased the Houston location and therefore, there was nothing they could do for me. They suggested calling The Glazier Group (and even helped me out by trying to call for me), but as it turns out, they also said nothing could be done (The Glazier Group has yet to return my phone calls). I wish I could say I was still a huge fan of Striphouse and that I proselytized about their amazing steaks -- cooked so perfectly on the outside and still juicy on the inside -- but this experience with both the Striphouse Las Vegas and with BR Guest (and with The Glazier Group) has really disappointed me so very much.

Unfortunately, I would not recommend coming here, considering the other great dining options in Vegas -- and I would definitely advise against being a repeat customer, because I don't think that this restaurant (which is understandable, since there located in Vegas and it is mainly frequented by tourists) and their parent company are interested in retaining customers.",g42wi9bOD_WAZsro7VW6rA,0,0,1,V66LUqyUDQDTCy3PmKQUVg

We actually got the steak faster than what we anticipated. The steak itself had a beautiful char to it and it was cooked perfectly. My wife and I both enjoyed our steak.  Our waitress Tiffany did check up on us quite a few times and towards the end she finally started smiling which kind of made a difference with our visit. Overall this place has amazing steaks I was very impressed I just wish the service was just as good as the steaks that's what we are noticing in Las Vegas in many restaurants now they either lack something their quality of food or the quality of customer service we spent five days in Las Vegas.

2890986,2015-01-22,3,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Not an Epic Steak Experience
----------------------------------

MLK weekend.  One of the highlights of a Vegas trip is an epic steak meal.  I make it a point to go to a high end steakhouse as a personal treat.  I decided to try out the Strip House.  I did not have reservations, and my friend was still in bed.  So I decided to go solo exactly at 5:00 PM opening since I was starving.  Plus, I figure I beat the holiday rush.  

One of my major pet peeves is when a restaurant is open at said time, and the staff don't  have their  sh*t together. I was seated near the bar and it was apparently obvious I was not welcome at that time.  Then the question begs ""why the f*ck did you seat me then?""  The tattooed blonde at the bar was certainly not friendly as I seemed to have inconvenienced her at the opening hour.   But f*ck it.  I am here for steak

The decor was interesting.  It was quiet with lots of red/velvet furniture and old nude photos.  I imagine this is what a strip club in the early 20s would have been like.  

Lets focus on the food.  I ordered the New York strip 16 ounce.  Mind you, this is not dry aged.  It was disappointing there was no dry aged option for the New York strip.   The steak was pretty tasty and the special bbq sauce was quite exceptional.  However, it certainly did not exceed the  basic bench mark from your typical chain restaurants like Ruth Chris or Flemings. 

So did the Strip House satisfy my epic steak expectations?   The answer is NO.  It was good, but I will certainly not come back.  The steak did not exceed my expectations given the price point.  It was not below average nor above.  If I am paying $$$$,  you better believe the expectations will be that standard.   So in this regard it will get a 3 out of 5 stars.  And another bit of advice, don't come here at 5:00, one may get the stink eye.",BfWm-stpIQ2ztIrm66emBQ,4,2,3,w97klGNbyysbnMU1z8skwg

2901954,2011-10-11,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.

We go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.

Our first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.

Shortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the ""heavy"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!

Strip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,2,1,4,9eITsnrwGka2E5ozxDpztA

The waiter was awesome, but when we received our steak, it didn't taste the same. He asked for the steak to be split becasue it was a large cut. I am not a steak eater so I don't know when a cut is bad. His cut was great, but I kept chewing and chewing and eventually I gave him some of my cut to see. He noticed I was struggling, but assumed I was chewing slow. He spit his piece out and asked to speak to the Manager. He let the waiter know how he felt and was disappointed with my cut. They said it was from the same cut, but he disagreed. The Manager approaches and his response to our complaint was highly unprofessional. He comments were uncalled for when situation was explained. He said you ate it so nothing can be done about it even though he was told I wasn't a seasoned steak eater. He lied saying he came from new York location when my boyfriend mentioned names, he was clueless. He was very immature and childish and defensive. His hospitality skills were horrible, customer skills even worse and all he did was remove the side dishes ordered. We were not looking for a free meal, but something to be done to rectify serving a bad cut of steak which was a pretty penny. My boyfriend was outraged at the poor service the Manager gave portrays Strip House to be a place that doesn't care if a patron is satisfied or not.

I had the petite filet mignon and lobster tail.  As soon as I bit into it, I thought...wow...I have had better surf-n-turf at Outback!  I expect much better from a high dollar steakhouse.  

It also should have been a clear sign when the server brought out steak sauce.  I am a big fan of Mastro's, Morton's, StripSteak, Fleming's....now that being said, these other places NEVER bring out steak sauce unrequested.  They apparently stand behind the flavor and quality of their steaks without the need for ""doctoring"" it.  Strip House obviously knows their steaks need some ""help"".

I do want to point out that the service was excellent.  Unfortunately, I don't go to restaurants for their service alone.  A girl's gotta eat and this girl has champagne taste.

The decor was so very cool; very dim light, red wallpaper with raised velvety designs (with silhouettes of posing ladies), different sizes and shapes of nude and semi-nude  pin-ups from the 20's and such, back-lit frames, all just very cool. 
Our cocktails were all interesting and delicious  
 I can't say enough about how delicious our food was; we all shared steaks, spicy potatoes, asparagus, and creamed spinach. Everything was ""eyes-rolling-back-in-your-head"" good! 
The most impressive part was our server, I believe his name was John. To begin he smoothly explained all of the specials in intricate detail and made everything sound so appealing. Throughout the meal he checked on us consistently and was consistently easy to find. He seemed to have everything flawlessly under control. 
The only snafu ( a very tiny one) was that one of the food runners brought out my friend's steak very, VERY rare (they had ordered medium). John was there within maybe less than a minute (so on point) to check on our meals and once informed of the issue immediately took it away to have it fixed. He returned with it quickly along with a different side dish (as he had taken away the plate my friend had with her sides on it).  
At the end of our meal, we were treated to the most delicious and enormous piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen, along with vanilla ice cream and berries. We also enjoyed the caramelized banana tart. We were too full to finish them but OH MY GOD they were amazing.

Super sweet, super attentive.

The chef sent out an amuse bouche which I always love. It was a soup of some kind in a shot glass. We started off with a tuna tartare app and I ordered raw oysters. If I had one complaint, it was that the oysters were tiny. Personally, if I couldn't serve amazing oysters in terms of size and quality, I'd take them off the menu. The tartare was great.

We both ordered steak. My companion having the filet and I had the surf n turf. The lobster portion was small but oh so delicious. The steaks were cooked to perfection.

I presume my request of a good booth with my reservation helped. The decor of the restaurant was very fun while also being tasteful. The booth we sat in was very comfortable, and we also loved the wallpaper that happened to match their napkins.

Service was quick and very professional and helpful. The only thing I would remove points for was being told they had a certain special (a bone-in rib-eye for two) only to be told they had run out when I chose to order that item. 

Wine selection was excellent, although a bit on the pricey side in terms of bottles. We didn't order appetizers, however, the chef sent us each a shot glass of a smoked potato soup garnished with herb infused oil which was a great free treat and tasted amazing. 

The steaks were perfectly cooked and I only wish all steaks would be cooked with the same crust these are. We had the bone-in rib-eye and bone-in New York, both perfectly cooked to medium-rare. The New York was surprisingly thick which allowed more of the aging flavor to come out, whereas the rib-eye featured the marbling of the meat.

For sides, we also got the goose fried potatoes and black truffle spinach. I wouldn't get the potatoes again, they only tasted like a fancy tater-tot although the rosemary was a nice touch. The spinach, on the other hand, is far and away the best spinach I have ever tasted, and likely the best side I have ever had. 

We chose not to order dessert on account of having no room, but the chef was still nice enough to send us a plate of candied pecans with happy birthday written on the edge as an extra surprise for my wife.

This restaurant is tremendous. I've been twice and heartily recommend it. Why?  Because of the steaks. The New York Strip on the bone: there you go, twenty ounces of mouth watering juiciness, broiled to perfection and seasoned to within an inch of its former life, generously coated with coarse salt and potent black pepper. Oh, boy, this is going to be one of the best steaks you've ever had. Sides to go with the steak: the green beans in garlic sauce -- killer -- and the onion shoestrings, made from Spanish Onions and lightly breaded, the ideal companion for your steak. And for dessert? The 24 layer chocolate cake of course. Don't be scared, the layers are thin, and the great thing about it -- it's not that sweet, more of a semi-sweet chocolate... satisfying your desire for something a post meal treat, but allowing you to also remain in the glow of  a perfectly prepared steak.

I've been to four or five steak houses on the Las Vegas Strip and this one is my favorite so far. It isn't cheap, but the best things usually aren't..",RRCAZdY_VMPVWeUn5JqTbw,0,0,5,zQwNC9wdfQH4kakIQruXeQ

They were appreciative and waived the usual $35 corkage... completely unexpected and very appreciated.  Service was perfect.  Oysters perfect although I was surprised we had to ask for horseradish... something which regularly accompanies the cocktail sauce when one orders oysters.

As I put my dollar bills away and sat down for my meal, I knew I was in for a treat. I had spotted a waiter bringing some food to a nearby table and damn did it look delicious.

Seriously...anything better than a steakhouse? (For you vegans it is like a great salad bar with meat instead of lettuce.)

So for starters I tried their lobster bisque. This delectable mix of Maine lobster & red pepper ravioli was a match made in heaven. Wow! Absolutely perfect...or as close to perfect as you can get with this treat. I wanted a second bowl. Of course I am a glutton, so maybe that was just my chunky belly speaking.

Moving on, I then tried some lump crab cakes that had potato salad, corn salsa & remoulade stuffed inside. I am a sucker for crab cakes and these hit the spot. Not since my visit to Baltimore was I so pleased with the crab cakes I had been given to inhale.

Then the main event.

The 20 oz. bone in (of course) New York Strip medium well. I ordered some sides of black truffle creamed spinach & sauteed wild mushrooms to compliment the massive steak.

Holy cow...literally. This blessed piece of meat was made to perfection and I surely wiped that plate clean. The 2 aforementioned sides were also great. I went to loosen my belt, but had realized I had not worn one. So instead I just unbuckled my top button. Hey I need to make room for dessert.

I enjoyed a slice of their layered chocolate cake and a cappuccino. Like a good smoke after a romp between the sheets, this sweet treat really ended a perfect night of dining out.

Do I recommend this place? Well remember those dollar bills that I had tucked away earlier? They wound up in the front pants of the chef.",hGeXKYWkqJgFC1u_Sh6kCg,16,15,4,IzuNI9h2MoMUSKq556TyJQ

Everything was a little underwhelming. Nothing was terrible but nothing was amazing either. Bloody mary's were insipid, like tomato juice with a dash of tabasco. First appetizers were Lobster bisque with  Israeli couscous and the scallops. The Bisque was very good, rich full flavor but the couscous was at best a distraction. It didn't add anything good to the soup. One scallop was amazing. It had a deep heavy char and full rich flavor. The other scallop was ok but not nearly as charred or as good as the other. Had the one not been so good, the other would have probably been fine. You could not look at the plate and not notice the glaring difference in how the two were cooked, but it was still delivered to me mis matched. We split a caesar salad. It was good but way over dressed. The croutons were seasoned with paprika and distracted more than they complimented. Too  much cheese too.  Steaks have an odd crust. It's good and tasty but not what I expect on a quality dry aged steak. Felt like camouflage.  It just wasn't for me. Also, the steak was not evenly cooked. One end was a little more done than the other.  Au Poivre sauce was rich and tasty. The NY Strip Oscar was good but a little undercooked, the crab portion generous and well executed. Sides really bothered me. Truffled creamed spinach and Potatoes Romanoff were just so over the top  that the the main ingredients were totally lost. The spinach could easily have been any leafy vegetable or even news paper. It was just a thick rich gooey overload of cream and truffle overkill. Same problem with the potatoes. Just too much cheese. It was cheese on cheese on cheese covered with melted cheese.  The famous 20some layer chocolate cake looked amazing and the very top layer of chocolate was really good. Otherwise it was dry and heavy. It's a giant slice for 2 or more people to easily share but it's not good cake at all. It's a lot like one of the giant cake monstrosities at Cheesecake Factory or a similar chain. The wine was excellent. They have a ""bucket list"" of wines by the glass that I plan on returning for but I'll just have that at the bar. I don't think I'd eat there again.

I got to taste all of the elements of the crab cake and really savor it, it was so good! The mustardy potatoes they paired with the crab cake were a bit intense by themselves, but paired with the crab cake they were really good. 

For our main course we both ordered the Crispy Skin Organic Chicken Breast. I know, why come to a steak place for chicken?! Well my husband was all set on a steak but changed his mind last minute, and as I said I was not feeling so good so chicken seemed like my best option when I ordered. So glad we ordered that dish!

Not greasy like onion rings - very light and delicious. And they served the chicken with a chicken au jus which made it that much better.

ordered the chef's special filet mignon (6oz) and lobster plate. asked that the steak be cooked medium rare, but it was weirdly dry. the color when i cut the steak was purplish pink, and there was no blood. i like a bloody steak for the moisture and taste. they may have grilled it correctly but drained the blood. the steak was way overseasoned and caked with whatever they powdered it with. i found myself scraping the burnt seasoning off the steak. furthermore, the meat itself had a weird processed taste to it. needless to say, i was not impressed. 

the lobster was alright. it could've been served hotter though. they may have left the food sitting in the kitchen before serving it.

I've never eaten so late at a fancy steakhouse, although we are in the city that never sleeps, so I don't know why that should surprise me.  So note, if you want to eat at a nice establishment after a show gets out or something, and it's like 10PM, consider making reservations here.  I think this would be a great place for special occasions as well, romantic evening for two who enjoy steak, inquire within.

I will forewarn you, I'm not a big beef or steak eater, in fact, I think the last steak I ate was in 2005.  My critique is on their salmon dish.  It was cooked to perfection, that is, it wasn't dry, it was perfectly moist and fell off with each fork swipe as it should.  The flavor however, was not so memorable for me.  I thought it was bland, really, and with the creamed sauce whatever it was, I still couldn't really make out where they were going with this.  So pardon me, for ordering the fish entree at a steakhouse, but even so, I thought for the amount of $ I was going to fork over, my stomach should be happy.  We tried a variety of their sides because we had a large group and could do family style.  I thought the majority of the menu was all potatoed, creamed, or did I mention potatoed?  I suppose this is typical of steakhouse sides.. but I wasn't utterly blown away by the flavor either.  I think my favorite item was the creamed spinach, though my friend argued it was overly garlicky.  But that was the only thing that actually tickled my tastebuds. 

We were there for a special occasion, so our group ordered their famous 24-layer chocolate cake and I will just say they don't lie about the 24 layers.  This thing could stand in a room on its own.  I noticed on their website they say you can order this and have it shipped out to you for $100.   I wouldn't say it was THAT good that I would need to eat it again.. but it was interesting.  I think if you're some crazy chocolate-aficionado, probably more your thing and sharing is caring.

Note, I'm also not the regular 5-star michelin-type restaurant frequenter.. going to these places is once in a blue moon if any.. and perhaps I expected too much from all the hype this place was getting.",WNMUH0yaXFPiQ8aVE-Hq_w,0,1,3,n6CgMfYuS7pZNEy4_Efg3w

The cake is dense and it's nice to have the layers of cake with the rich ganache.  It's tough for cakes to be moist, but this one did a pretty good job of that.  It also wasn't too sugary-sweet like a lot of other cakes are.  The issue I had with this cake was that it wasn't chocolaty enough.  I could taste the cocoa, but I was expecting a bit more with the decadence or richness of the cake, especially with all the ganache that was there.  I saw this featured on the Food Network's ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" and I can't say this would go anywhere on my list of the best things I've ever eaten...it was good, but not great.  Many other reviewers mention the same thing and I should have listened because they were right.

The décor of this place is fantastic and also has great service.  We also tried a Caesar Salad, which was good and their Duck Fat Fried Potato, which was really good.  I would definitely come back here to try one of their steak options, but I don't think I'd come back for the cake since there are so many other options out there for incredible chocolate desserts.",tlY0QMQDyfjQAEwHnzvFnw,2,1,3,ByUo076HPGoPjCL8Wt9HZQ

The decor is kind of interesting....the whole restaurant is covered with black and white pics of strippers from the 50's. 
I was with a group of 6. We made reservations in advance and were sat immediately. Our waitress was very nice....but very s l o w. 
Our drinks took forever and she would randomly disappear so we didn't really see too much of her. 
I started with the Caesar Salad. It was your average caesar salad but it was topped with paprika croutons which gave it a little spice...I enjoyed that. I don't eat meat so I asked the waitress if they could make a vegetarian pasta for me which she said wasn't a problem. 
The pasta was surprisingly delicious! It was linguini tossed in a light lemon cream sauce topped with fresh asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes and peas. It was very flavorful yet light and creamy. I loved it. 
We ordered a variety of sides for the table to share:
Black Truffled Creamed Spinach- a little too creamy for me but still good
Garlic Herb French Fries- can't go wrong here
Sauteed Wild Mushrooms- great!
Sauteed Green Beans w/Garlic- excellent
Potatoes Romanoff- dry, crumbly, and didn't taste very good

The sides were good, but I felt for the price they could have tasted a lot better. Two of my co-wokers ordered steak which they said was decent, but came out lukewarm. For $50 a plate I think the steak should be served hot don't you??
Anyways, I was just really disappointed in the service. Our waitress didn't pay much attention to us and everything took forever. For the prices you pay here, everything should have been perfect.

We asked for a good steak place where you didn't have to dress up. When we got there, we found that we may have been underdressed. After a double look from the hostess, we were seated in the back.  It was about 7 PM on Friday night and the place was near empty (should have been a warning sign).

Drinks - The waiter was a bit slow to come over but when he did we ordered cocktails. Drinks were watered down.  When I asked for regular water it tasted like it came from the bottom of the ice machine. I had to buy bottled water. I later tasted local water and it was fine. Another instance where they played the customer. 

Staff - The waiter was not unpleasant, just not pleasant. Other waiters there seemed to have better personalities.

Food - I ordered my steak medium rare but it came out medium. I would have sent it back but everyone else at the table had their food and were eating. I find that unless it is uneditable it makes no sense to send back as everyone would be finished eating by the time you get your food again. One of the other guys in our party ordered the ""surf and turf"" and said it was perfect, another had rib eye and said it was average. Everything is al a carte, even the sauces. We had the creamed spinach with bacon and it was probably my favorite for the night.

I ordered the day special filet mignon medium rare and even just touching it with the knife could tell it was not. It was rare, almost blue in the middle. How this got by the chef is disappointing. 

I sent it back and a few minutes later the waitress said that it won't be long it's back in the oven. Now I'm very fussy when it comes to my steak and reheating a steak that's already rested, cooled down and cut in half is not acceptable for a $60 piece of steak. Absolutely changes the texture. 

I ended up cancelling the order. Surprisingly though not even an apology. 

Another surprise was that my wife was unable to order any fresh juice as all they had was from a bottle or tap! Finally, not very busy and yet the seats they gave us were very uncomfortable. There were plenty of seats which had cushioning/padding.

We had the porterhouse for two which was divine. It is rare that I eat steak but when I do, I look for top of the line. This cut was spectacular and was full of flavor. It comes with a house sauce and roast garlic but this steak did not need anything extra. 

Our servers, John and Alexis were fabulous. They were very knowledge about the menu. They were friendly and made us feel like we were the only people in the place. When they hear it was my birthday, they hand wrote out Happy Birthday with my name and gave us the largest piece of chocolate cake. It was very nice. We had to take some back to our hotel and I was further impressed that they provided us utensils.  Thank you for making our night even more special. 

The atmosphere was very nice. Classic old Vegas charm. Low light, red, romantic decor. Very classy Vegas. 

I read several reviews that said it was too pricey. The price is a little expensive, but you are receiving quality. Come on, it is Vegas and it is a fine dining establishment, the prices reflect the quality and ambience of the food/place. Over all, I think it was reasonable for Vegas prices for fine dinning, in fact it was a little more on the reasonable side for a steakhouse.

The service was absolutely awesome. They waited on us hand and food. Loved the complimentary bread basket. That bad boy is as endless as you want it to be.

Unfortunately, something we at here left us with a bad case of food poisoning. We know because this was the ONLY thing we ate all day. No bueno.

Sea bass - yes! Nicely cooked, not over-seasoned. 
Seared scallops - yes! Wish there were more of them!

VA VA VOOM...Sexy, Sultry and Sensual; Strip House Steak House are ALL of those things and more. If the food doesn't give you a FoodGASM, the ambiance will set the tone for something else later in the night. *wink wink*

On Saturday, 2/19/11, our party of 9 arrived 6:48 PM for our 6:30 PM reservations. We were promptly seated in our own private room. 

F O O D:

*COMPLIMENTARY BREAD BASKET: 
-Pretzel bread: warm, soft, chewy and salty

-Raisin bread crusted w/ sesame & poppy seeds: my fav; crusty on the outside and pillowy soft in the inside. A slather of the butter added a creamy rich decadence while the raisins a touch of sweetness and the seeds a savory nuttiness. 

-Sourdough bread: I didn't try it.

*COLORADO LAMB RACK w/ Dijon Breadcrumbs & White Bean Stew ($43): AMAZING!!!

The two thick lamb chops were crusted w/ a Dijon bread crumb mixture and perfectly seared, then finished off in the oven to cook to a medium rare. 

As I took the first bite, I got a nice crunch from the seared crust and then the soft tenderness from the lamb. The lamb was not overly seasoned and a small ring of fat was left which helped ""dress"" the lamb in its natural juices producing a piece of meat that was juicy and full of natural lamb flavor w/ a hint of gaminess. The Dijon brightened the lamb by giving it a punch of tang on the palette. 

The white bean stew was the perfect accompaniment b/c of its neutrality which let the lamb shine in this dish. The al-dente beans were stewed in a rich and savory gravy which had a slight smokiness from the bits of bacon. I mopped each bite of lamb w/ the gravy and it was like a FoodGASM in my mouth!

*BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED SPINACH w/ Bacon ($13):  OMFG! *Eyes Roll Back*

I was too consumed w/ scarfing down my lamb to even notice the sides until I started hearing a bunch of ""Ohhhhhs"" and ""MmMmms"". My friend said, ""OMG, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!"" and gave me a spoonful.  I took a bite and HOLY SH*T it was BOMB!!!

The creamed spinach was insanely rich and velvety. It was well-seasoned and savory w/ a subtle  woodiness from the black truffles that wasn't overpowering. And, the best part? THE BACON!!! The crisp bacon bits added yet another layer of richness w/ a hint of smokiness.  A DEFINITE MUST ORDER!!!

*MAC 'N CHEESE ($13): SINFULLY DELICIOUS!

The elbow noodles were smothered and intertwined w/ a thick and creamy oooeeegy gooeeey béchamel cheese sauce. As I scooped the mac 'n cheese from the bowl, the sauce was so thick and gooey that you can see the cheese stretch and pull from the bowl to the spoon.  *drools*

The noodles were perfectly cooked to an al-dente and béchamel cheese sauce was packed w/ bold flavors. You can taste the sharpness from the cheddar, nuttiness and creaminess from the gruyere, and you get a nice crisp texture contrast from the breadcrumbs. The ratio of butter, milk and cheese created one MOST mouth-watering Mac 'N Cheeses I've ever had! Every bite, I felt like I was committing a sin; well a Lo-Carb Dieter's Sin to be exact.

S E R V I C E:

IMPECCABLE and ACCOMODATING!

My friend informed SHSH that we were running late due to traffic on the Strip and also told them we were in a huge time crunch and would have to be done w/ dinner at 8 PM. They said, it would be very tight especially w/ such a big group but would try to get us out of SHSH by that time. 

Our waiter and the other staff were very professional, friendly and attentive. They knew we were in a rush, so our waiter promptly took our order and everyone's apps, entrees and sides were out w/in 25 minutes! Keep in mind some of us had red meat which takes some time to cook and rest, so kudos to the kitchen staff!

We threw SHSH's staff a curve ball and they definitely went above and beyond the call of duty! They got a party of 9 fed top-notch fare and out of there w/in an hour!!! At fine dining establishments, I normally spend 1.5-3 hours for a party of 2-4, so this is definitely unheard of for me.

A M B I A N C E / D É C O R:

SightGASM for the eyes, SHSH is one of the MOST sexiest, yet classiest restaurants that I've ever been to! 

Reminiscent of the SULTRY 1940s w/ dim lighting, scarlet red walls w/ gold decal, mahogany furnishings topped w/ crisp white linens, vintage black and white burlesque photos and LCDs w/ shadow box images of a woman's curves, SHSH will set the tone for one of the MOST sensual and romantic dinners you'll ever have!

FELLAS...*ahem ahem*.

If you're looking to tantalize every one of your senses, look no further, SHSH will satisfy ALL of them! The aroma and taste of the delectable food will please every taste bud and the ambiance will excite your eyes. As far as the other two senses: hearing and touch? Like I said, SHSH will set a tone for what will unfold the rest of the night, if not, I'm sure the alcohol will... ;)",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,6,3,5,kKR1dOcdFncIlA-UM-CSBQ

4057347,2013-04-17,8,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"So what's a nice gal like me doing in a Strip House like this? 

Eating anything but red meat lol

Strip House Steak House (it's like a children's rhyme! One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish...) is inside of Planet Hollywood casino--with parent location(s) in NY. All have the similar red walls, sharp, black contrasting decor, low lighting, and backlit picture frames of old-time celebrities/public figures from way back. If you squint your eyes, you can picture cigarette smoke hanging in the air and imagine Bogie coming around the corner with Lauren. There aren't any strongly-themed steakhouses around me (except maybe the chain El Gaucho in Seattle) and I enjoyed being transported to another time. It didn't feel hokey at all. 

Steakhouses are not my thing since I don't eat steak, and I never seem to get the quality of food that my beef-eating crew eat when we do go to one. I find something vegetarian/poultry/fish, pay an arm and a leg, and end up feeling dissatisfed. 

Strip House changed all that for me. We started off with bread: cranberry, pretzel, and sourdough. The butter was room temperature WOOT! and in a giant ramekin. I do love butter!

I then had the tuna tartare special app: Spiced raw tuna over avocado (FML) with a cucumber wrap, over cucumber (?)-scented water topped with two different kinds of caviar. HEAVENLY. And BIG! I'm a very expressive person, especially when eating, and it must have been weird to listen to me from another table. My only critique is that the spice was not evenly mixed through the tartare, but all is forgiven :D

For my main dish, I had the Scottish salmon over red quinoa with cream sauce and it may have been the best salmon I have ever eaten outside of me making it at home. I live in Seattle, with amazing seafood, and I eat a TON of fish. BOOM. Some of the top salmon in Vegas? I would never had guessed. It was a thick slab of salmon, and was the perfect doneness where the line between cooked and raw is as small as a splinter on a flea's foot. Flawless. Marvelous.

And though I could reflect on all the great salmon I've had in my life for a while, I know for a fact that the black truffle creamed spinach was the best creamed spinach I ever had. It was a shame that I couldn't take the leftovers back to the hotel with me. 

No room for dessert, my bill (alone) was $64, which was almost $10 less than my friend who had the steak and mac and cheese. I cannot believe I had all of that, with the quality it was, and excellent service on top of it. 

So on my next trip, I'll save some room in my tummy so I can eat MORE!

I've never seen a place charge a per person fee for splitting a meal.  (Though when the meal came out, it was portioned out for each person so I guess that was OK.  But still).  It's kind of like a Ruth's Chris, but more stuffier and less comfortable.  I kinda felt like our server was wondering wtf we were doing there since we didn't look like everyone else.  Geez.

Open up the menus and WOW.  Can you say sticker shock?  I was expecting pricey but cmon.  So with that being said, the food better match up to the cost of it.  

My BF and I split the ribeye and ordered 2 sides to go with it, the onion straw things and creamed spinach with truffle oil.  Good, but the truffle oil definitely over powered the dish and it was all I could taste.  The onion straws were done just right, and provided a good contrast for the creamed spinach.  But my steak was cooked completely wrong.  I asked for medium rare.  Not well done on the exterior and raw on the interior.  That's why this place is uber dark.  So you can't look at the color of your steak and send it back for them cooking it wrong and trying to trick you into thinking your tastebuds are wrong.

Ever since then I've been cooking my own ribeyes to make up for the horrible experience.  I'm going back to Ruth's Chris.",KmG5JwA9U5x_xsKZN16zBQ,2,1,2,_n5eAl8oRM0KudsD0UvFwg
4119933,2008-11-14,8,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Very nice ambience, and a nice bit of quiet in the sea of crap and noise at Planet Hollywood.  Very solid wine list with surprisingly not crazy markups (something Vegas is legendary for, sadly), we had a Ridge Geyserville and an Au Bon Climat Chardonnay, both very nice and not insanely expensive.

As a vegetarian, the real merits of these places are lost on me, but the sides were very solid and the portions were generous.  The asparagus was nice, not too loaded with butter, and the whipped potatoes were very light, if not slightly bland.

The real story here was that I tried steak for the first time in my entire life (a piece the size of a dime), really my first meat-eating experience in at least 20 years.  It was OK, I really don't know what all of the fuss is about haha I didn't run vomiting or anything.

4154267,2010-04-27,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"We went exclusively for dessert - specifically the 24 layer chocolate cake that they're known for here... 

Since we sat at a table in the bar (where we got quick and friendly service, by the bartender - as we were the only ones in the bar on a Tuesday night), can't speak to the restaurant or the rest of the food, although we've heard good things about both - but then again we heard the same thing about the chocolate cake, now about that cake... 

The cake looked great and was HUGE! Five stars for presentation - but after all four in our party dug in and actually tasted it, we all let out a collective sigh of disappointment. The icing was rich and fudgey, but the cake itself, (all 24 pencil thin layers) was dry and surprisingly bland, not very chocolatety. For a cake we've seen talked about as a must eat desert while in Vegas this desert was extremely disappointing - WAY below our expectations. 

The cake, a few coffees and a tea the bill came to a whopping 40 bucks plus (the cake slice itself is $14). WAY OVERPRICED and everyone in the party agreed (and we know good chocolate folks, we've been to Europe).

4202516,2009-07-23,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"With a culinary and hospitality background, I've been told on more than once occasion that I'm overly critical of restaurants.  But when you're paying upwards of $75/head for dinner (app, entree, dessert, and drinks), I believe you have a right to be critical.

My 2-star rating comes primarily because of the service.  In a recent conference at the NRA Show in Chicago, Steve Carley, CEO of El Pollo Loco, said about service, ""Bad service can make good food taste bad.""  Forgive me for stealing a quote, but that just about sums up my experience at Steak House.  It had come highly recommended, and given my background in steakhouses, and my LOVE for a good steak, I was REALLY looking forward to it.  We had a group of three on the 4th of July (and yes, I do understand that eating in a restaurant on a busy holiday isn't exactly the best time to dine, but the restaurant was not busy!), and our entrees were a filet mignon, bone-in veal, and ribeye.  I ordered my filet medium rare, and the same with the other two cuts.  The veal and ribeye come out perfect.  My filet?  Not even close.  Medium-well bordering well done.  But no biggie.  I hate sending food back, but in this case, the filet was so bone dry, I just could not eat it.  After waiting about 15 minutes for the server to come check on our table, I asked him if there was anything he could do.  I showed him the steak, and showed him it wasn't done the way I ordered it, and this is what got me: instead of simply offering to take it back and refire it, he pushed a steak sauce on me and insisted that the sauce would make it more to my liking.  Seriously?!  At this point, I just insisted that it be sent back and he woefully took my plate from me.  A couple minutes later, the dining room manager came to my table and asked me if I would consider a different cut of meat (which I expected).  I simply explained to her that it wasn't done to the temp I had asked, and that I still wanted the filet.  No argument, a simple apology, no harm, no foul.  She even brought out some more of the cheese fondue appetizer we had ordered to hold me over.  All was well for the time being.  

But then the meal went on.  My filet came back as the others in my party were finishing their entrees, and it was done perfect.  But then our server suddenly disappeared...again.  I had to ask a busser for our check, and when it came, I noticed I was charged twice for the filet.  10 minutes later, after being yet again ignored, the server came back expecting the card in the bill, and I explained to him what had happened, and sure enough, he blames his manager for not taking care of it.  Really?  I wasn't even trying to put blame on anyone, just trying to take off a double charge on the bill.  At this point, I was just over the meal, and when I finally settled my bill (everything fully charged, no comp, no discount), the manager came back to my table, and totally acknowledged what had happened and apologized for everything that had gone wrong during our dinner.  She handled the situation very well, considering, and I have no problem spending for a meal whose food matches its service, but in all honesty, I was expecting my filet to be comp'd.  Given her acknowledgment of the dinner, she admitted they screwed up, but you CAN make it right.  Problems are an everyday occurrence in restaurants, and especially fine dining, but most of them are EASILY manageable.  An overdone filet is no exception. If you call yourself a steakhouse and charge more than Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, and Morton's, your service standards should be at least comparable.  Not only are these chains better, but their service is head over heels Strip House.  At least I don't get talked down to by the servers and pushed steak sauces when I eat there.

That being said, their bone-in veal is TO DIE for.  It was cooked perfectly and is the only reason I would even consider going back there.  The veal alone is the only reason I gave Strip House 2 stars instead of 1.",kjMOmTUz0AByq13ahlca_Q,4,0,2,4gWIfoWd5G-zh95-4fw7xQ

4223071,2014-11-12,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Strip House Steak is nothing short of life reaffirming beef. I had a late dinner Friday night at the bar, and enjoyed every bite of my meal. 

Mark, the bartender, was extremely jovial, entertaining, and offered an exceptionally high level of service. I began my meal with the scallops. The order came with two large scallops over a buttery froth with some grains and soybeans. Every bite was perfect, the slimy texture of the scallops was complemented by the crunch of the beans, and the heartiness of the grains. 

Next I had their version of a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. It was delicious, a whole chunk of wedge covered with shaved red onions, chopped bacon, and a creamy Stilton cheese dressing. It was one of the best takes on a classic steakhouse wedge salad that I have ever had. 

Lastly, I had the 12 ounce filet mignon cooked rare plus. This was the crowning jewel of the meal. The steak was thick and heavily crusted with the perfect amount of salt, and black pepper before being seared at what I can only imagine was an extremely high temperature. The steak shredded with only a fork, and melted in my mouth with an exquisite texture. To accompany the steak there was a roasted garlic clove, which combined in sparing quantities with each bite of steak added an extra dimension of flavor. 

Overall, Strip House Steak is somewhat of a hidden gem for being right on the vegas strip. I found it to be a little bit more reasonably priced than some of the better known alternatives, and every bit as good.",pNtbEEw9HeBe_WIL2sl5pg,1,1,5,4Dpt43j-PZROWpmE4bzqqg

Food:

That being said, this place was amazing. We were staying in Planet Hollywood anyway and I wanted to eat somewhere fancy for dinner and then place did the job. We were late for our reservation but they were about to still fit us in and sat us quickly, which they definitely didn't have to do. rThe place is decorated with 1920's models thats range of clothed to quasi nude models in way that was kinda classy but didn't interfere with your dinner either. The low lights and red interior gave it an intimate feel too. 

Our waiter was a combination of charismatic and creepy, in a way that was very entertaining to me. I don't know if it was on purpose or not but either way he was very good at his job. One of my friends suggested I get the ribeye steak medium well so I went with that and I was not dissappointed! No one was in fact, not even the vegetarian! (She ordered a 2 sides instead of steak and still didn't finish everything). Probably the most surprising item was the grean beans cause they were freaking delicious. I was stuffed and could stop eating them. In fact, many of the sides that we ordered could be shared with at least one other person. They are kinda big and so flavorful, so they were also pretty filling. 

We decided to get the 25 layer chocolate cake for dessert. That's right. 25 LAYERS! Again, I couldn't stop eating it and I don't even like cake that much. I had mentioned to the waiter and supervisor that was working that my birthday was my favorite holiday, so when the cake come out, it had a candle in it and Happy Birthday was written on the cake. They waiter and sup even came by and said ""Have fun on your favorite holiday!""

That being said, here we go: 16 Oz NY Strip, medium:  very good, pink throughout with no trace of red, cooked to perfection.  Seasoning for me was fine, but I like things with a little zest, others may find it overly seasoned or salted.  Even so, it really only served as a crust and did not detract from the flavor of the meat itself.  Good cut, minimal marbling, but enough to provide some flavor.  The creamed spinach with bacon was simply amazing; flavored with garlic, truffle oil and large pieces of bacon throughout; I would highly recommend it.  Whipped potatoes and Potatoes Romanov were good, but paled in comparison to the spinach.  ides are served in very small portions, probably enough for two but no more.  Which, for the spinach was a crime.  No dessert tonight.

4429640,2017-11-28,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Prologue:
My fiancee and I had tickets for a show at Planet Hollywood and wanted to find a fantastic restaurant to have dinner before the show.


The Plot:
We began by sharing the Goat Cheese Prosciutto Rolls, followed with a 12oz Filet Mignon along with Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes and Sautéed Wild Mushrooms.
This sumptuous meal was concluded with their signature 24-Layer Chocolate Cake.


The Scene:
The portion sizes were very good and there was plenty of food for the both of us.

You know the meal you're about to enjoy is off to a great start when the basket that first arrives at your table is filled with a variety of hot rolls that are even better than anything you've purchased at an artisan bakery.

The Prosciutto Rolls were stuffed with Calabrian-Infused Goat Cheese, Wild Arugula, Frisée, and Shaved Parmesan and were served with a Twelve-Year Aged Balsamic Glaze.
To begin with, the exceptional quality of the prosciutto was immediately apparent.
The spice from the Calabrian Chile was well balanced with the chilled goat cheese and greens yet still delivered enough heat to excite our taste buds.
My fiancee commented that she would have been satisfied with just this dish alone for dinner.

The Filet Mignon was cooked to a perfect medium rare (see photographic evidence below) and had been allowed to rest appropriately prior to arriving at our table.
The steak also had a nice crust on it with classic seasoning.
My fiancee appreciated how it was moist, tender, and pink in the middle but not at all bloody.

The Potato Croquette had great texture; firm yet tender and perfectly seasoned on the inside with a lovely and very yummy crispy crust on the outside. This was a much nicer compliment to our steak than a baked potato would have been.

Personally I enjoyed the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms most of all. The portion size was very generous and the variety, texture, and flavor of the mushrooms was absolutely outstanding; perhaps the best I've ever had.

Twenty-four alternating layers of chocolate cake and chocolate mousse topped with ganache comprised their signature dessert.
One could not help appreciating the time and effort that went into creating this dessert.
The piece we were served was monstrous and was easily enough chocolate bliss for 3 or 4 people.


The Rest of the Story:
The serivice was excellent, of course.
We arrived early in the evening, were seated at one of the best tables in the house, and were cared for very well.

The ambiance and decor were classic steak house crossed with Sin City.

The tab for the meal was very reasonable for fine dining at this level in this location.


Epilogue:
We happily award 4 stars for our most satisfying and memorable dinner in Las Vegas to date.

The ambiance and decor are nice.

The service was good.  Our server was attentive and friendly.

We started with the Warm Garlic Bread.  It is long rectangular strips of fried bread.  It comes with a Gorgonzola Fondue for dipping.  The taste and texture of the bread is great.  The fondue is creamy and mild.  We all enjoyed it.

The house bread basket comes with three types of bread.  I only tried the pretzel bread, but it was excellent.  The others seemed happy with the other two options.

I chose the 8 oz. filet for my main course.  It was prepared as requested, medium rare.   The meat was tender and tasty.  The seasoned salt and pepper crust gave it added flavor and texture.

We ordered a couple sides.  The Potatoes Romanoff were tasty with nice contrasting textures.  The others tried the Steamed Asparagus and told me it was good.

They have diverse options for wine.  They also offer some unique mixed drinks.",3wB-JjsUjkvdNUDRnChsVg,1,0,4,Jt2AhpSXU4YhoodKgqQsPw

They don't have corkage.  If you bring a nice bottle for a special occasion, Per Jared, there is no way they will break policy.   The policy is that you have to BUY another bottle from the wine list which is more expensive than the entire dinner. 

No exceptions, with attitude.  Jarad should not be in a customer service position.  If we had not committed to this reservation and location near our show, we would have turned and walked away.  
Shameful as a part of Planet Hollywood, that this kind of rude behavior can impact a guest.  

Sad. Jarad looks to be about 22, and acts like he has no experience with a high end restaurant.  There are so, so many choices in Vegas.  I urge you to go somewhere else where I am sure they will appreciate your business.

Part two

The food was decent, somewhat average for a high end steak house.  Mastros, STK, and Ruth'sChris have better steaks.  The food was slow.  We waited 20 minutes after a salad for the entree.  
The waiters were ok, not great, not bad.  Just sort of off on timing. 

My overall thought.  While I had good experience here in the past, things have changed and they are not close to the previous high standard.  Also for the money at a minimum expect people to be nice.  No so much here.  

Try STK at Cosmo.  Much better.",w3wIAtDVvdg_xnQ7tgpbDg,4,0,1,Fq1JQm5NEhikrIVsq3DT_Q

We had heard about the Strip House before, as we stay at Planet Hollywood every time we are in Vegas, but have usually made it too late in time for dinner. 
We were sat right away, and our waiter who served us was extremely helpful. He told us all the specials, and came back quite frequently to check on us. The wait staff of the entire restaurant was so quick and helpful, I felt like I was in a Disney movie. If your water glass got less than half full, it was instantly filled, bread was replaced quickly (which it needed to be, because it was fresh baked and delicious!), and every item we ordered was brought out almost immediately. It was fantastic. And everyone was very polite. 
For our appetizer, we shared a jumbo ship cocktail which was extraordinary. I ordered a lobster linguine, and my boyfriend ordered a new York strip with onion strings. My lobster linguine was good, but it wasn't as amazing as I hoped. My boyfriends steak on the others hand.. Was absolutely MOUTHWATERING! As soon as I tried a bite, it melted in my mouth and I had to check if it was unicorn because it was so magical. 
I tried a few bites with onion strings and the pairing of the salty bite with the perfect savory steak was just amazing. 
For dessert we shared the house cheesecake, which had a hint of citrus and a sweet, almost white chocolate topping, also amazing and perfect. My boyfriend had a glass of Knob Creek and I had a small Baileys Irish Creme. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.
The decor of the restaurant was styled like an old fashion burlesque hall, with red printed wall paper and dim lighting, and lots of framed black and white photos of silent film stars and burlesque dancers. The beautiful restroom had rose wall paper on top and tiled red bejeweled brick on the bottom, the entire place is gorgeous.",0sWPk7oNp0lPJoJTmMTuoQ,0,0,5,cvG3IbQSYs_G1edcb1HiAg

Undeterred we decided to have prix fixe dinner in one of the private rooms.  Our event planner Gabe was awesome and we were able to have some tastefully Photoshop'd artwork affixed to the menus.  As for atmosphere, all I can think of is red.  TLC Red Light Special red, which I suppose goes well with medium rare steaks and red wine flowing.  It's more club chic than steakhouse really.  The private room itself was nice as it pretty much shut out all outside noise once the door was closed.  This proved vital as a fellow female patron was apparently 1 or 5 cocktails in, but who's counting.

If you're hungry you're going to love the prix fixe menu.  The 14oz Dry Aged Rib Eye is not bone-in.  So yes, that is 14oz of pure unadulterated bovine ready to make sweet love to your cheeks.  One of the salad selections was the Roasted Bacon salad.  The term ""salad"" being used very loosely.  Okay, it was essentially three big slabs of bacon with a small mound of greens because the chef thought ""why not, yolo.""  Simply brilliant.   I haven't even gotten to the desserts, which include a chocolate cake bigger than some household pets.  If you do a prix fixe menu here, there's is no way you will leave without a food baby gestating in your stomach.  So if you're planning to go to the club after, leave a couple hours buffer to drink some coffee and flush your system.  Otherwise that $1000 bottle minimum will be no bueno.  Trust.

The service itself is top notch.  Our waiter shared some war stories and everything came out fairly fast and on-point.  As for price, I'd say it's reasonable considering all the food, the private room, and the customized menus.

Once seated our waiter came by to express the restaurant concept and specials. Throughout the meal he was very nice and helpful. After hearing some of his recommendations we decided to start with the prosciutto appetizer special of the night. It was absolutely delicious. The meat was cut very thin and stuffed with cheese then topped with arugula and balsamic. Very unique and not too heavy of a first dish.

For my entree I choose the lamb chops while my boo stuck with steak. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and didn't even require any additional sauce or seasoning. For a side we shared the spicy potatoes which was the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of. The taste was somewhat bland to me and not enough spice. 

Can't forget the best for last, the dessert. We shared the brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. So good!!! Three exclamation points worthy for sure. If you're a chocolate fan, do not pass this up! 

Overall we both really enjoyed this place and would come back again soon. It's perfect for a romantic date night and they also have private rooms for group events too.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,1,1,4,NlzZfNXgPmNGfg7cR42qOQ

The Tuna was perfectly cooked and fresh. For our side dish we ordered the sautéed mushrooms. They had a good flavor, but they were very average. For our final entree we got the Chocolate Brownie. The portion of the dish was very good for sharing. However, I was not impressed with the flavors. The brownie was a bit cold and the flavors were just ok.

Ambience: nice setup and vibe. Can be flexible with different type of dinners (ie romantic, business, etc. ). Noticed some nice private rooms. Not your typical stuffy steakhouse. A tad on the noisier side. But all in all, nice vibe. 
Service: for the most part, it wad pretty good. We were seated right away when put party arrived. When another friend joined us late, a seat was quickly added. Our server came right away. However, service started slowing down as the restaurant got more business. We actually had to flag someone down for the dessert menu. Food came out at a decent pace. 
Food: was pretty good. Highlights for me included the seafood combo appitizer (2 jumbo shrimp and jumbo lump crab meat). Loved the crabmeat (2oz). I got the dry aged ribeye (medium rare) and it was a tad over cooked to a medium. Still very nice flavor. Friends really enjoyed the salmon (not sure i would ever order salmon at a steakhouse). Best sides were the mac n cheese and the bacon cream of spinach. That spinach was phenomenal.

Our server Ricky was very knowledgeable and friendly. He asked if we were going to a show and I said we had one at 9.

Lets start with the decor...I dig it. Dimly lit with red hues and classic black/white pin up model images. Breathes a classy yet seductive vibe (unfortunately some of the pin ups are nude so not the best place to bring little joey and elizabeth for dinner). We sat at the booth facing the bar but theres another seating area behind. Vibe was laid back and quiet which I cherished. Great setting to enjoy a lovely meal and unwind whether you just lost or won at the black jack table.

The food is great! Ordered the New York Strip with Mac and Cheese. Side orders can respectfully serve 2-3 so keep that in mind. The NY Strip medium well was fixed delightfully and tasted amazing. Mac N Cheese probably the best ive had at any steak house and I've knocked out the top 5 in Houston and Chicago. For drinks had the Apple martini (nicely done) and a strawberry mojito(little lack luster, could have done without). Dessert was a soft chocolate brownie w/ warm fudge draped across it and vanilla ice cream ontop. The sensation upon eating it made me feel not too guilty about the calories it packed and I slept guilt free ha!

I can only speak for what I had, since I ate there alone, but from the look of the other customers' faces, the entire menu is top notch. Starting with the bar, the drinks were expensive, as can be expected in Vegas, but well worth it and well made. I had a Sapphire and tonic and a glass of Bordeaux. Dinner itself was top notch. I was served an assortment of bread with butter to start. The mini- French loaf was great and the butter was soft enough to spread without any difficulty. As an appetizer, I had the lobster bisque. At first I found it a bit salty, but it somehow became more delicious with every spoonful. It had a nice thick consistency and had a good amount of lobster that seemed to almost melt on contact. For dinner, I had the 8oz filet done medium and asparagus. The steak was wonderful, slightly salty and crispy on the edges, soft, pink and full of flavor on the inside. It was served with a Bearnaise sauce, but there was a variety of other sauces available. The steak also came with a roasted tomato half and garlic off to the side. My only disappointment with the food came with the asparagus. For $8 I was expecting something a little more exciting. It was served with Hollandaise sauce on the side, but it was still just ok. It was carried by the steak rather than complimenting it. The waiter was a 10 out of 10. He balanced making sure I was ok with not annoying me perfectly and brought everything to the table quickly . My only other dislikes of this amazing place were the noise from the casino and a slightly wobbly table. I know, that is a minuscule thing, but that is what separates amazing from very good.

4950752,2008-09-15,3,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"I'm very conflicted in writing a two star review for the Strip House. On one hand, the service was maybe the best I have ever enjoyed. Jasel (sp?) and later Olivia were incredibly courteous and worked very hard at rectifying a bad situation. However, some things just can't be excused no matter how nicely the staff behaves.

We went to Strip House for a bachelor party dinner and they were nice enough to set us up in a private room. The restaurant has a very cool vibe where it isn't stuffy like most steakhouses but is still very elegant. We arrived a little late and they were nice enough to save our private room for us despite our not showing up on time which was very appreciated. 

Jasel (sp?) was our waitress and she explained the menu perfectly and was very professional and cordial to us. Orders were taken at the right time and the team of other staff members made sure we never had to ask for water refills or anything.

So... what was the problem? The food. I went to Strip House based on the recommendation of my Casino host who had been there 10 times and said it was incredible every time. My steak, a 10 once fillet was good but not great and instead of being cooked ""rare plus"" was cooked more ""medium rare plus"" but that kind of thing happens with so large of an order. What was NOT acceptable was a few people had steaks coming out well done or well done plus when they had ordered medium rare. The guy to my right had ordered medium rare and his steak had no red or pink whatsoever. It was cooked over well. Other issues included one steak which was completely dry when brought out and more completely improperly cooked steaks. All told, of the 11 steaks we ordered 6 were cooked correctly or at least close enough and 5 were nowhere close to right. 

We had reservations that night at LAX and were already running late so we didn't have an extra 45 minutes for them to cook new steaks and to eat them so we basically all shared everything we'd ordered and they brought out maybe one or two new steaks. It wasn't the ideal was to start the evening and it isn't cool to make your patrons pass pieces of steak all over the table so everyone is able to eat. 

Olivia, the bar manager, came to our table and apologized and was generous to bring us a complimentary bottle of Cristal which was VERY nice of her and highly appreciated. We knew that the mistakes took place somewhere in the kitchen and were not her fault nor our waitresses but both of them apologized and did their best to smooth over the situation. Now, none of the steaks were removed from the bill but the given the free bottle of Cristal I guess that isn't so large of an issue. 

Most likely, based on my last experience, I wouldn't return to Strip House but it is entirely possible that my experience was anomalous and your experience will be better.",VKN0MIX5mlGDdaPwkyD9DA,3,2,2,CUuBDhA8KqNXb9vWItaw1A

We were immediately approached by our server and ordered a bottle of wine.  Strip House has a decent selection, certainly not the best when compared to some steakhouses on the strip, but I've seen much worse.  The prices were what you would expect to pay on the strip.  We split the crab cake to start.  This was a solid dish, the cake was crispy and came with plenty of tangy remoulade.  I also liked the corn salsa.  It was also a good size, so each of us had several bites.  

To eat, I had one of the specials, the dry aged 14 ounce ribeye.  To begin, all steaks are served with a bulb of roasted garlic, which I love.  The steak was excellent.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, it had excellent crust on the exterior.  To be able to achieve such a crust without any burning is an impressive feat.  It added to the flavor without adding a charcoal quality.  The steak was juicy and the dry aging was noticeable.  I'm glad I ordered it as opposed to the bone in ribeye on the menu.  The dry aged steak may be smaller, but the flavor more than makes up for what you lose in ounces.

On the side, we had the mac and cheese and the potatoes romanoff, or twice baked potatoes au gratin.  The mac and cheese was solid, it was very cheesy and had the requisite string of cheese when you spooned it out of the dish.  Also, a serving contains more than enough for 2 people.  But, the real star was the potatoes.  The parmesan in this dish was fantastic.  It had a nice crusty top and was smooth throughout.  I wish I could create this dish at home.  It's a must order if you are a cheese and/or potato fan.

We had a great evening and were well taken care of by our server.  Strip House may not get the pub of some of the other more famous steakhouses on the strip, but it can more than hold its own.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,0,4,nSREL3GlTVpGTbej2uy4xw

We have been to Strip Steak by Michael Mina at Mandalay Bay and I think this is better.

We ordered a steak each and a two sides to share.  I ordered my usual FILET MIGNON med rare to med and in comparison to my boyfriend's bone-in NY strip it was just ok.  The filet had a good crust but I would have liked it to come a lil warmer or at least a warm plate but was still good.  The bone BONE-IN NY STRIP he had was EXCELLENT, great crust seasoned to perfection with a lil spicy (we always like anything with a some kick) but did not  overpower the flavor of the beef and not too fatty.  Now the sides were great additions to the meal, one of the better steakhouse we've been to with exceptional side dishes.  We ordered GOOSE FAT POTATOES (recommended by many reviewers of the NYC lcoation) which is a big ball of mashed potatoes fried with a super crispy crust.  It was good different potato side dish.  We also had their BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED SPINACH which was richly flavored.  If you like creamed spinach then you'll love this version.  FInally, we tried their CHOCOLATE CAKE.  Definitely THE BEST chocolate cakes I've had and it's HUGE.  It is 24 layers of moist chocolate cake and rich ganache; and that's it.  No nuts nor  fruit or any other extras, just chocolate.

I do love my steak, and I have to be honest, I've had better. Yes, the ambiance and decor are impressive as expected being in Vegas, but what matters most is the food. 

I ate with a large party (15+). I ordered the 10 oz. fillet (medium rare) as well as a recommended glass of their Riesling. The meat was prepared well and I did enjoy it, but for some reason I usually get an intense reaction whenever I have impeccable steaks during my first bite and I just didn't get that same reaction this time. 

What I can compliment is their service. The waiter consistently made sure that everyone in our party was being attended to. We even had a situation where a few people left the table to go outside and the busser assumed that they were finished with their plates. When my friends returned they told our server that they weren't finished, and what did they do? They cooked a full meal for each of them (whatever they ordered, of course) and boxed it up to-go! So, they basically got a whole new meal for free! I don't know of any other place that would do that.

5049217,2017-07-29,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Hey Tilman,

Question:   How do you go from having one of the BEST steaks - to having the WORST night in 30 minutes?

Answer:  Order the 20 OZ bone in Rib Eye, cooked to perfection, where the next bite is better then the last and you even pick up the bone to savor the flavor - and order the cream truffle spinach.

My wife and I are guests at Planet Hollywood this weekend and made reservations at Strip House, looking forward to a fabulous meal.  As our reservation time approached, we were gambling (and winning) but we stopped so we would not be too late. (Mistake #1)

We were seated and the ambiance, music, wait staff, etc could not have been better!
The bread plate consisted of a variety of breads, all which were excellent.

We ordered 2 of the $52 Bone in Rib Eyes and since everything is a-la-cart, we ordered the spinach. 

The Rib Eyes (I wont call them steaks as that would be insulting) arrived and were cooked to PERFECTION....the first bite AMAZING. As we worked on them, we also took bites of the spinach.  As we were finishing our meal, I started to feel a little queasy,so I excused myself to the bathroom. When I got back to the table, I asked my wife if she wouldn't mind taking care of the bill as I wanted to go up to the room.

When I got to the room, I barely made it to the toilet before (sorry for the graphic) barfed my guts out.  When you throw up, you can usually taste what the cause was and all I could taste was the truffle spinach.

My wife arrived a few minutes later and immediately did the same thing I did, afterwards telling me she had the same taste.

After we regained our composure, we debated what the cause of our puking (and ruining an otherwise good night) and both agreed it was the spinach.

I called the restaurant and spoke with a manager. I identified myself and told him what happened.
He apologized and indicated that he understands that the spinach can be a little rich at times and that he heard of a similar problem happening with the spinach in the past.  He then asked what did I want him to do about it?

I answered I did not know (wanting to see what he said) and he offered us to have us back. That was a nice jester, but at that moment the LAST place I wanted to go back to. (Maybe on another trip as we frequently stay at PH, but certainly not back to back)
I was a little surprised that the offer was not to remove it from our room charge, but I don't know if he had the authority to do that.

Rather then going out and having fun gambling, we spent the night in the room.  .

In hindsight, perhaps we should have stayed where we were winning earlier rather then leaving a hot streak for dinner here.

I guess you can say we did gamble....on the spinach.....and lost.

I enjoyed the bone in filet mignon which was full of flavor with potatoes twice baked; I think they call it Potato Ramonoff. My daughter had a Caesar salad which was so fresh with calamari which was great as well. The flavor of the food made me eat slowly and enjoy every moment. I was so satisfied but did not have room for dessert. Our bill was a little over $100 and well worth it.,UifQhWl8oFESDHgyyYRloQ,0,0,5,U4sv2tDOPQXiqhNMkiFljQ

**rewind back a few weeks**

We enter the steakhouse and was warmly greeted by the hostess.  No fru fru, snotty feel to this place.  Instead, it's warm, red, and with nice pictures of past glamour.

an aperitif came first that was sadly forgettable...then...the courses began.

First:  Warm garlic bread with gorgonzola fondue.
Good beginning, but if I could do it all again, I would order something lighter to prepare my stomach for the incoming assault (in a good way) of hearty red meat.  A very large appetizer that was shared by two but should have been shared by three or four.

Then came the meat we were waiting for.  We had the center cut chateaubriand that was carved tableside.  Amazing stuff!  The crust on the steak not only had a nice texture, but was full of flavor.  The inside melted in my mouth.  It was juicy and cooked just right at medium rare and the thought of it is making me salivate.  We ordered a side of truffled creamed spinach which was the best creamed spinach I've ever had.  Once the spinach touched my tongue, my eyes closed in joy.

Sadly we were too stuffed to order their 21 layer cake and I blame this on the delectable, but heavy appetizer we had ordered.  Next time layer cake, next time...you are mine!",V4-T6N07bsDQz0F0pAGJ7g,2,2,5,KaDInXcEdW5oBwfIUR49hA

It seems like the guy was almost waiting in the wings to refill the waters. Which was very impressive. The atmosphere was great. The bread basket was nice with a variety of different breads to try. I ordered the lobster bisque for my appetizer and was pleasantly surprised. The way that they brought it out and served to me was impressive and it was divine. my boyfriend ordered the Crisp Organic Chicken and it was really good and moist. The flavors were married together beautifully. I ordered the Colorado Lamb Rack and I was floored by how moist and tender they were. The dijon crust with the au jus was just completely amazing.

The service was excellent, glasses were always half full, and everyone had a smile.  The server didn't have the restaurant week menu up front though, so I thought we were going to start off on a bad foot, but the rest of the night went smoothly.

Starting off was the comp bread platter :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#M64Hy_zMuIusbCGE0v6_RA

There were some good ones there, including pretzel bread, onion bread, and something mixed with cranberries.  The bread came out lightening fast...within a minute or two of us sitting down.

Then came the salads...

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#e3ZQxqsw96YtGaayUjh76Q

Caesar was a nice rendition of the classic.... It had Hearts of Romaine, Paprika Croutons, and Shaved Parmesan.  You know it is good if you catch me eating lettuce...I hate lettuce!

But this is when I knew the night was going to be amazing....check out the Strip House Roasted Bacon Salad :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#aXUMZua2dF2xG6vz4uy5FA

More like pork belly salad! Look how thick those slices are....and great meat/fat ratio!!!  Came with Baby Arugula and Russian Dressing.  A MAN'S kind of salad...amazing!

On to the entrees!  Wife went with the Filet Mignon and added two Seared Scallops (+$12) :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#A9XfCIn3WoY9mNCL2xLzCQ

The steak was cooked perfectly and had a beautiful char on the outside, but a little heavy to taste with the salt/pepper/mix and the char.  Takes away a little from that yummy steak, but not enough to really complain about it.  The scallops were amazing though and cooked well with great taste!

I ordered the 28 day dry aged Ribeye :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#BCKElERFaMQBWuKn1oCtPg

It was also cooked perfectly cooked, but with that same char on the outside.  The fat was pretty tender, and I ate a good bit of it on purpose lol...but overall it was a 4/5 for me!

The sides, Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes and Black Truffle Creamed Spinach :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#19xyxl1DFKOEBxe_Zc5VDA

The potatoes were good, with the crust being almost hash brown like, but the Truffle spinach was out of this world!  Amazing mix of creamy goodness, with a bite of truffle flavor that was outstanding.  You HAVE to order these...blew my mind!  They also gave us a side of their steak sauce, but it was WAY to sweet for me...almost BBQ sauce like.  I wouldn't order a sauce for a good steak anyways!

Dessert...Warm Chocolate Brownie...

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#iRri0RfZjWsza3vDkf-S_Q

Décor - great décor, great theme, standard dark, red, plush steakhouse. The staff was aloof at the door and the waitress was as well. 

We were 20 minutes early for our dinner reservation so we were going to have a cocktail in the lounge which they didn't direct us to, and then the waitress forgot our drinks. 

A manager noticed and fixed the issue however, that was just plain sad. It wasn't bumping- our reservation was for 9pm. Let me say that the choice for this spot was ease of access only as we stayed at PH this last trip. 

We were sat a decent table, a round booth that was comfy and lent us a great vantage point for people watching. 

The waiter was fast, knew the menu and to the point. We were missing out on a return round of drinks. 

I ordered a Beefsteak tomato salad, we ordered shrimp cocktail and calamari to start. DH ordered a fettuccini - lobster fettuccini. 

All tasted AWFUL. Calamari was rubbery, cocktail shrimp were actually jumbo prawns that weren't deveined, tomato salad came as a scalped tomato with some cheese on top. Pasta tasted mushy and the lobster was chewy. 

Luckily we weren't too hungry because we didn't finish any of it - but we also didn't complain. 

Pricing was out of control - even for a steakhouse. Mortons/Hy's is far better quality & service for far less.

The bartender was super friendly, we talked for a while and since I was alone, the company was nice. It's always a good thing when the bartender talks to you because that means he cares about his job and his customers, which is why I left a fat tip at the end.

I ordered the steak and asparagus. It was amazing! The steak was cooked just the way I liked it.. medium rare, and the asparagus was fresh and tasted great. I was super satisfied when I was done with my meal, couldn't been happier.

It wasn't super busy, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  The steaks were REALLY good.

We also shared 4 sides - mac n cheese, potato romanoff, creamed corn, and fries.  They were all decent although not mind blowing.

5218624,2017-03-06,2,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"Extremely disappointed. I don't know whether I am more upset over the quality of the food or the fact that I felt ripped off by the cheap and stingy portions. 
A group of four of us ate here on Sat 3/4/17. The menu is such that you pay for a main course and the sides separately. We ordered one surf and turf, and one 12 ounce filet, plus three sides: strip potatoes, mushrooms and charred broccoli. I ordered a glass of cab.
I order wine every time I eat out and this was the stingiest pour I have ever seen. For $16/glass, I would expect closer to a 9 ounce pour. What I got felt like 4-5 ounces. I was done with my wine before my steak even came out but $16 for a pour that small there was no way I was ordering another.  I found myself eyeballing the couple next to us as they had a bottle on their table and I was longing for a little more. 
When our steak arrived I was shocked at how small it was. I knew we had ordered the 12 ounce which would be about six ounces each. I've been on meal plans where I've weighed and measured my protein portions, typically in four ounce portions, and this did NOT look like a 12 ounce steak/6 ounce portion on my plate. I glanced at the steak across the table because it was the smaller filet on the surf and turf and it looked to be the same size as ours. I should mention I wouldn't normally be this focused on the steak size except that we hadn't eaten for a long time and we were starving, plus for $56 for the steak and no sides, one wants to get what they've paid for. 
After tasting the steak I couldn't believe how dry it was, especially for filet. The internal temp looked proper for medium, but the steak itself was still dry. I literally found myself putting butter on it to add some fat which is something I would normally not do. The broccoli had the wrong texture to it, as though it had been cooked to al dente but perhaps had sat too long waiting to be served. The other sides- mushrooms and potatoes- were just ok, but really the overall feeling from the meal was that for a very expensive place, it was all just ""ok."" 
No one in our group said anything at the time because it was our first night in Vegas and we all just wanted to have a good time. No one wanted to be complaining about anything and besides, it's hard to have any self respect when you tell them they didn't pour enough wine in your glass or can they come weigh your steak, but the customer should never have to feel they have been gypped when you're at a restaurant as pricey as this one was. We ate and then had a concert to go to but later on we started to talk about it and realized we all felt the same way, and that both steaks were dry, the sides were nothing special, the wine pour was stingy, etc. $200 for dinner with shared entrees and one alcoholic beverage gone down the drain. The next few times we ate out we felt even more annoyed because we were receiving better food, in bigger portions, for better pricing. Examples, Aria Cafe, Aria Buffett, grand Lux Cafe, Gordon Ramsey's pub and grill. 
We decided to return the next evening and let the manager know how we felt but as it was after the fact, he did nothing to remedy the situation. Had he even offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house or some chips to gamble with I would have felt like their intent was in good faith, but as it is, I would say you take your business elsewhere.",QDJE1VPw4kaT2wsW0uctLQ,1,0,1,1X9pIE4woYNjBDk_uDZvoQ

That's where the compliments end.  Here's the rest of the story
:
First, I'm not an old codger, but I have to say that dining in a formal dining room with rap music blaring over the speakers ruins the whole experience, even in Las Vegas.  Service?  It was very good . . . nothing to complain about . . . but our wait staff had absolutely no personality.  In fact, there was no personal interaction whatsoever.   Courses arrived so quickly that we felt rushed and were made to wonder if everything was pre-cooked and just waiting for an order to come in.

Aside from the steak, the food was not good.  The chicken, while perfectly cooked, was coated in some kind of horrible-tasting crust.  Most of the sauces and sides ranged from mediocre, (Potatoes Romanoff), to downright disgusting, (oyster sauces with rotten fish smell, sickeningly sweet steak sauce).

In sum, the Strip House was ADAQUATE but nothing really special.  On top of that, it was horribly over-priced.  (We skipped ordering a bottle of wine, because the wine list was laughingly ridiculous).   If I'm going to spend $250 for 2, there are so many very exceptional venues in Las Vegas that I can't think of a single reason to dine here.",6fYj6gfRwIjbbgdq1wbxNg,1,0,2,HIN1yToOoPyjVMuZHfodMA

When we stopped by earlier in the afternoon to make dinner reservations, the earliest they can seat us was at 9:30 for a Saturday night.  No problem since we had to squeeze in an afternoon power nap from the day drinking and site seeing we did earlier in the day.

We got there and it still took a while for our table to be ready for our party of six.  When we sat down, service was a little on the slow side, but that was to accommodate our sixth person who was leaving her car with valet.

We started off with lobster bisque which my boyfriend and I shared, it was nice they split it up for us (versus being cheesy and sharing it in one bowl, lol).  I got the surf & turf dish that came with a petite filet mignon and lobster tail.  He got the rib eye which was enormous!  The side dishes we all shared were all good except the mac & cheese was a little too rich for me, but it was a hit with the others.

5529280,2016-08-17,70,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"For being a fairly large resort and touting some of the biggest headliners on the Strip, Planet Hollywood currently does not offer a real ""big night out"" dining option.  Even though the happy hour at Koi is solid, sitting among those terrible fake plants in the main dining room make me feel like being on a movie set for a straight to video romcom. Pampas is horrendous, and pretty much every other spot is shorts and flip-flops crowd.  

But if something along the lines of a legit dinner (budget allowing) at PH is what must happen, Strip House is the only call.  The ambient red and classic dark steakhouse wood make for a nice setting and an OK-ish meal with a few martinis or a bottle of wine.  

The chef really likes to season the living hell out of the meats.  The salt and pepper crust on my 14 oz medium rare rib-eye almost looked like sweaty pavement upon arrival.

https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZDFzw2lEiUYZW9EsV0YR2A&userid=8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg

And while the steak was satisfactorily tender, I found the crust to be overpowering and opted to not finish the entrée.  It might also have had to do with those delicious crispy goose fat potatoes giving me that ""devour the hell out of me"" look from across the table.  My wife didn't mind the seasoning on her rare filet, but that had more to do with it covering a lot less of the surface area of her steak than mine.  I'm not sure if light or no seasoning is an option, but I will attempt to request it if I ever find myself here again.  

I was impressed with our server as he was very cordial, informative and even talked me into a fruity cocktail :P  Maybe he's Marc Savard's understudy?  He couldn't hypnotize us into one of  those huge $15 slices of chocolate cake that kept passing by though.

So my thoughts were that on a night as crazy as NYE and in a hotel that is about a minute away from being another Harrah's property, we are probably not going to have the best meal ever. Man was i wrong... 

1st, the service was fantastic...happy wait staff who talked you up while they were working, were attentive at all times, and made accommodations on a very busy night. For example, I brought a really nice bottle of wine with me, and the waiter thought that maybe I would not be allowed to do that (I had called ahead, and they had a ""buy bottle/waive corkage"" policy). he confirmed with the manager, everything was cool, and he even shared a drink with us. 

2nd, the food!! This is truly a steakhouse...you ask for your meat cooked a certain way, it gets cooked that way. Perfectly seasoned, great portions, and the sides are fantastic. Signature creamed spinach, Potatoes Roskoff...you are not leaving that place hungry, and if you have not eaten something that made you say NOTHING but only smile to yourself....than you should give this place a chance. 

3rd, the drinks...we had to wait a couple minutes at the bar because we were early, so we grabbed a drink. This place had a couple of really sharp guys behind the bar; knowledgeable, friendly, no one waited for drinks and they realized that if you are paying $12 for a drink, you should be getting $12 worth of liquor. 

Finally, the atmosphere. I have only been to a couple of places where the decor and atmosphere is...in my opinion...perfect. Strip House is such a place. It is loud enough to make you feel like you picked the right place, but not so deafening you can't hear your companions. Dark velvet wallpaper covered with pictures of '30's burlesque strippers lit from behind. High-back booths you can sink into and watch people go by. 

If none of that is motivation to go, here are five final words that may do it: Twenty-One Layer Chocolate Cake.

The service left a lot to be desired for a restaurant with so many awards. The restaurant was practically empty. While the pace of the meal was fine, our server had an heir of arrogance that was unnerving. He was not friendly and rather inattentive. Very disappointing. 

After reading so many raving reviews, we started with the Gorgonzola fondue. I love love love garlic and have always thought you cannot put too much garlic on anything for my taste. However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible. I would have preferred to enjoy the Gorgonzola taste since it was Gorgonzola fondue. The garlic bread that is served with it was very tasty but drenched in butter. Again, who doesn't like butter on garlic bread? Certainly not I! But this was way too much...it made the bread soggy and greasy. 

The breads that we were served were very good. One was like a pretzel stick. 

For our entree, my husband and I had the filet. It was perfectly cooked, but not up to the quality that we expected based on the awards Strip House has received. We shared the creamed corn as a side dish. It was rather flavorless. Too much cream and not enough corn. They should rename it ""heavy creamy with bits of corn"". Again, a huge disappointment. 

A table nearby by ordered the daily assortment of homemade sorbets and ice cream for dessert. If I hadn't seen the table nearby order it, we would have skipped it. I am glad we didn't. It was the best part of the meal. We had raspberry sorbet and chocolate ice cream. It was served in a large toile cookie bowl that had tons of fresh blackberries, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries. They were very generous with the fruit. This made for a light, refreshing dessert.

When we first walked in, the guy who led us to our table was nice until we told him that we preferred the booth, he changed his attitude, walked us back out and let another guy take us in. Then our waiter wasn't really attentive until we ordered the $250 bone in rib eye wagyu. He changed completely and started chatting with us. My mom likes to have sauce to eat with her steak, they brought out some for her and charged us $3. I mean seriously we pay $400 on that bill and you gotta charge us $3 for the sauce? I mean $3 is nothing but this kind of service sucks for an expensive restaurant like this. We saw their truffle spinach on the food channel, the chef put tons of truffle in it because ""its Vegas baby"", but i didn't see any truffle in mine. The steak was alright, I have had better and it wasn't even wagyu. I gave 3 stars for their chocolate cake! It was heaven people! But would I come back here again, I dont think so.

We started with their special bacon appetizer, Rockefeller Oysters, and Salmon Cake. I was all about the bacon. Holy crap was it ridiculously good. 

For my entree, I had the special bone in filet with black truffle and parmesean and everyone else had a variety of other dishes including the NY Strip, bone in Ribeye and Lamb Chops. So... freakin... good. We shared our sides family style which was great advice from our server because we ordered six. Figured one per person... we were gluttonous. Mac and cheese, potatoes romanoff, asparagus, creamed spinach, goose fat potatoes and the GREEN BEANS. YESSSSS. (The sides are huge by the way, you don't need to order one per person) 

As if we didn't have enough ( we took dinner home), we ordered the 24 layer chocolate cake, banana tart, and creme brulee. Guess which dessert we had to box?

After being left alone for a lonnggg time without bread or drinks, the server told us the specials: surf and turf with any steak you want...sweet. So I ordered filet mignon with lobster. Oh wait, the waiter says, I forgot to tell you that we're out of surf and turf. Wtf? So why did you even include that on the specials? Anyway, he offered to switch lobster for lump crab meat. Meh, ok, I'll try it.  Crab was dry and tasteless, filet was sooo dry, such a shame, I love a good steak. In fact, everyone at my table said their steak was dry. BOO

The ""fondue"" appetizer wasn't really fondue but it was still tasty, tuna tartare was delicious, creamed truffle spinach was rich and delicious, and their famous chocolate cake was pretty bomb also.

5820079,2008-11-15,0,AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA,"I've been wanting to go to Strip House for years. I have no idea why it's taken me so long to finally make it happen. My experience last night (11/14) far exceeded my expectations. 

The décor right down to the sillouettes of naked ladies on the napkins more than satisfied my pin-up fetish. I expected the floors to be plush red carpet as well and was surprised to see small tiles. At first I was concerned about noise. (The Palm at Ceasars has a tiled floor and gets ridiculously loud when it's full.) However, the sound level was perfect. Not sure how they did it--perhaps the velvet in the wallpaper was sufficient to absorb the sound. 

I was also pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was. In fact, Planet Hollywood in general was totally jamming. Wonderful sight!!

The service was impeccable: never rushed, thoughtful, and thorough without being intrusive. And the food was outstanding. I mostly eat a raw vegan diet when I am on my own. And everyonce in a while, on special occasions, I go overboard. Last night was that night and I was lucky enough to have the best lamb chop I've ever tasted. Extraordinary. The beet salad was beautiful. And my chocolate ice cream filled, hot fudge drenched, pastry puff was scrumptious, simple, and somehow was not overly sweet. Again, perfect.  

My companions loved their steaks and all agreed on the excellent service. The winelist was consistent and well suited. Yay! for my favorite: Duckhorn Merlot. I can't wait to go big again.

Brown Bread with fruit inside it was excellent, and golden Calamari Fritti was great with a fine Remoulade Sauce.  And a Shrimp Cocktail with Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce featured 4 large and delectable shrimp.  But the Caesar Dressing on my Caesar Salad was far too weak--like a light oil that at best contained only a hint of traditional Caesar flavor.  

Lobster Bisque with couscous and cream was velvety and excellent.  A medium-rare 6 oz. Filet as part of a Surf & Turf pairing was very good, although so laden with peppercorns that I knocked 2/3 of them off.  But Goose Fat Potatoes were perfectly crisp, and Potatoes Romanof were creamy and great.  

There was one notable service error.  Our server initially brought 2 orders of mixed sauteed Wild Mushrooms to the table instead of 1 plus the Potatoes Romanof.  The error was fairly quickly resolved.  Both Bearnaise and Bordelaise Sauces were quite well prepared.

Overall, a fine 4-1/2 star meal!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,11,5,4,VFJO-TO4rHvlsQRaVGYjJg

My friend and I felt a little under dressed, but did notice other seated parties dressed similarly. The restaurant itself is quite cozy...dark and sexy B/W photos on the walls, with some larger ones back lit with red light. The food was decent, but a medium-well fillet should have some pink and not be charred quite that much. All sides are Ala carte and as stated in other reviews, quite potatoe-centric. The service was the sticking point with me though. Sullen waiter who just repeated out the specials and then zoomed off, appetizers delivered (or tossed) on the table and no real customer service given.

We dined here with a large party (25 guests) and had an amazing dinner.  One of the guests at our table got the half order of the seafood plateau.  It's an impressive looking dish and crammed with seafood and shellfish served on crushed ice.  I was totally loving the bread basket (lots of variety, all very tasty) since I'm not a huge creepy crawly seafood person.

I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass for my main.  Seriously, one of the best fish dinners I've ever had, and I live on Maui.  I eat and serve fish for a living.  The Sea Bass was served on a bed of Jalapeno Potato Puree with a red wine sauce.  It was so delicious that I only gave my boyfriend a single bite.  I usually am much more generous in giving him tastes from my plate, but not with this dish!  He ordered one of the many specials offered: the dry aged ribeye.  It was a tad overcooked, but still incredibly juicy with a killer rub.  

All steaks were served a la carte (minus the bulb of roasted garlic on the side of every steak--such a great idea and oh so delicious.  I had to school the table on how to remove the garlic cloves and spread them on each bite of steak, or eat them on their own if you're a garlic lover like me), so we ordered a few things for the table: the signature Strip House Potatoes (twice baked potato gratin), steamed asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce, and Mac & Cheese.  Do yourself a BIG, BIG favor and order those potatoes.  AH-MAY-ZING.  To die for.  Mouth watering. I wish I had some right now.",mkaGi9drcXLg-YZe7JYaWw,2,1,4,FaUeICBDIBQmy08J7ru_5g

The 10 oz. filet mignon was good, not outstanding, but it was fairly good. I certainly didn't need all 10 ounces. However, the mashed potatoes were outstanding.
