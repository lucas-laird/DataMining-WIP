My husband and I got sodas this morning and I cant even describe how awful they tasted! We promptly threw them out and went somewhere else. On top of that the panhandlers and drug addicts asking for money (both times) is ridiculous. Plus, we could barely understand the lady talking through the order box in the drive through.

Don't go here!",ySyXNs92s3_sItaZlt1f5w,2,0,1,5h6BV90ZoYunThmp8BqL9g

1704056,2017-06-24,0,i0EtEzlEkOho6YcLG29bvw,"Lately I've been avoiding all Mc Donald's like the plague because almost every time in the last few years we get terrible customer service, and despite my comments on this my husband insisted our midnight soda run for tonight be here cause it's cheap, by home, etc, and I think our experience just a little while ago tonight just convinced him to blacklist going to any Mc Donald's location as well!

After dodging someone that looked like they were going to throw them self into he front of our car (bad druggie neighborhood), we got to the menu and as we were right away reading the sign taped up that said something (it was dark, no lighting really), a lady quickly spoke up and said they're closed because their system is down.

We say OK and begin to drive away-she starts talking to us, asking my husband, ""Wait wait, are you the UBER driver"". What? We politely say no, and she asks this SEVERAL times, to the effect of ""I know but are you the UBER driver?!"" and getting snippier each time, no answered to each time, and she still asks yet again! I figured maybe their thing wasn't working right (often found at Mc Donald's speakers it seems), or she simply didn't hear my husband the first many times, so I spoke up just slightly louder than how he was talking (NOWHERE NEAR a yell at all!) and say the same thing so she'd stop asking and let us be on our way.

She quickly barks loudly ""DON'T FUCKING YELL. WE'RE CLOSED GO AWAY.""

WOW! JUST WOW! Someone needs to lose her job! She is clearly not suited for dealing with customers and upholding any employee standards! And if she doesn't get let go I hope this place goes out of business! It's keeping people like her that steer people away and give you guys a bad reputation!

Better yet I look online at recent to recent ish reviews and they all say how awful and nasty this crew is! No kidding!

Originally I was avoiding this place because of the frequent druggie and pandhandler problems on top of the fact that 80%+ of the time we get sodas here they taste nasty or we were given diet (some of us are badly allergic), but now I am even more openly giving people the word: DO NOT GO HERE.",w8N0kRTYwhmny3w2rO-pgA,0,0,1,b9a3CWPWz4R3r8bfW38Y4g

They only offer 1 free refill and keep the bathrooms locked so hope if you have kids they are not the ""wait til the last moment"" types. They tore tons of seats out to put large U booths and the only register they keep open is the one that they don't have a card reader on so cash only. I guess McDonalds as a whole is trying to go upscale fast food like Chipotle or something. Someone should tell them you can spend thousand on giving your establishment a facelift but bleh food and crappy policies are going to hurt you.",mUmrSJrP50Tb8EME6OYPcQ,1,0,1,4uSTn0ognzL8g_ez5Z6tlw

3887266,2015-09-07,1,i0EtEzlEkOho6YcLG29bvw,"Worst customer service! I've been here twice. I came in for breakfast- no one in front of me, but it took over 15 minutes because the 5 women at the front were too busy gossiping to take or fill my number 6 order. 
   Came in for lunch with a friend on our lunch break when we were at a professional development seminar. We stood in line for several minutes waiting for the woman standing at the register to stop looking at her co-workers and notice we were there.
  Finally one of her co-workers noticed us and came over to her register saying ""I'll take you over here."" So we left the register we were at and went to the other woman's register at which point she literally noticed someone she knew and left her register with 2 paying customers starting to place their orders. She went into the dining area and started talking to the guy and ignored our existence from that point on. (He was wearing a beige long-sleeved shirt and tie- I think he might have actually been a manager there and yet he didn't course-correct her behavior.)
   We tried to go back to the first register, but a couple had gotten in line there and somehow the woman had noticed them. The couple got into an argument and we had to wait for them to finish before we could finally order.
  We were finally able to place our orders (would've left if our lunch break wasn't running out) and sat down for my friend to finish her salad. After looking at a bunch of tables we gave up on trying to find a clean one and settled for one with ketchup smeared around it and sandwich and fries crumbs all over. With how unsanitary the tables are, makes me wonder how clean the cooking conditions are.
   They are clearly not interested in our service, so we see no reason to go back. I really wish we'd caught some of their names so they could get the fame they deserve",nr2QuEyY_ZKicxnF4eCmLQ,1,0,1,q2avRSOkEffnHYNCzD261g
4065742,2011-08-13,0,i0EtEzlEkOho6YcLG29bvw,"We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house.  This last year it has gone down hill.  They are out of things often, week after week.  

The service has become poor.  Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location.

The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them.  Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not. 

 After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months.  We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either.  Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.",jcg-1XFGjFUW8Jgqo91DWw,6,0,1,PREkt2rmv9Z4XXwsai67bA
4345422,2017-04-24,0,i0EtEzlEkOho6YcLG29bvw,"The manager is rude. We walked in and didn't even say welcome like every other McDonalds does. I was with a couple of friends and ask the manager asked us to wait a minute and we said it was fine. It was more than 5 minutes that we were waiting and still no one there to take our order. She walked past us and my friend asked her if anyone was going to help us. She looked us straight in the eyes about 3 times and said nothing.  I called the store and she answered.  I asked her if anyone is going to help us and once again told us to hold up a minute... The tables and booths were dirty.  There was an employee out of uniform. I worked in fast food restaurants before and you are suppose to use the scoop for the ice not the cup. That's how the manager was doing. She still had us waiting...  Do to her poor customer service and bad attitude we decided to leave.  She really needs training and counseling on her anger management because we are the customers not her friends to be giving us attitude. All we went for was an Ice cream cone. Just one for my friend.

I have never had a language barrier problem as another reviewer mentioned. Everyone I've contacted inside the restaurant and at the drive thru silk have spoken English.
