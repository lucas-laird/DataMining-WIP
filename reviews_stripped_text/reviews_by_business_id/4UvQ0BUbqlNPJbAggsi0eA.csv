She is professional, responsive, and her menu's have gotten better and better!  She is great and creative at her craft and exercises professionalism from small catering to big ones.  I love working with Kristina!  And her chocolate ball dessert is to die for!",LDnem1lIk7lwNC1YaIn4NA,0,0,5,uRGPlTjskjwzukeSmf-TMw

She's so precise and orderly- you can count on pleasing your clients or any guests with any event you have her cater.

A romantic two-person dinner party or 100+ guests - you'll love her style and personality!

She's friendly, affordable, great customer service and what she prepares is delicious. I highly recommend her for any event where you need a caterer or for a special evening with your special someone and you have better things to do than making the dinner!",0XL7EEk2_XoJ62R6VLg-PQ,0,0,5,tcjCDOeR8qZSq7teXGOMdg

3254503,2015-11-03,0,4UvQ0BUbqlNPJbAggsi0eA,Kristina Elmido at Delightful Chefs is amazing at what she does. I was so impressed to learn that she has been on television and has cooked for very well-known celebrities. When I tasted her food it was clear that her passion for creating amazing food drives her to do what she does because the meal she created was so unique and delicious. I'd highly recommend her to anyone.,NUCDTGVU06HBsdosHpFzpA,0,0,5,7IEfDUzRJk8H_tOvZTyRmQ
3380830,2015-01-14,0,4UvQ0BUbqlNPJbAggsi0eA,"I cannot say enough how fantastic my experience was with Chef Kristina! Her pop-up dinner was outstanding: I had never tried lumpia before and it was melt-in-your-mouth good! The chicken adobo was a big hit, and yam cheesecake? I was skeptical at first, but wow, it was awesome! The piano man was a nice touch - really added to the ambiance. She also made an effort to stop by each table to introduce herself and chat with guests, letting us get to know her a little and making the experience feel intimate and special. Not only is she a knock-out chef, but she is also a sweet and wonderful person. Definitely 5 stars!",buxPJ-tEgmraTkRIPjJ5Hg,0,0,5,BR0j0MX_LTs2WqFORhcM9Q

4623873,2016-11-07,0,4UvQ0BUbqlNPJbAggsi0eA,"I'm an executive assistant for a company that sent 5 team members to a conference in Las Vegas.  I was asked to find a personal chef that could come out to their rental house the first night to make a nice home-cooked meal for the group.

Kristina was so, so helpful in the planning process -- I had some allergy/food preference issues and she had great suggestions.  

We also asked Kristina to stock the rental home with food for the week, and gave her a big long shopping list, which she did for a completely reasonable fee.

Everything was timely -- the menus, invoices, phone calls, food prep itself.  It was so nice to have someone I could count on when I couldn't be there.

I would absolutely recommend Chef Kristina and her services to anyone.",gw5FHVNd-lOBZquCXwWUKg,0,0,5,61iTgikiFC44xmvkIhk_MQ
4843302,2016-09-13,1,4UvQ0BUbqlNPJbAggsi0eA,"Long gone are the days when I lug lunches to clients' offices ever since I discovered Delightful Chefs!  They make everything so easy - from ordering to paying to punctual delivery to set up. Best of all, their food is delicious! 

Not once have I heard any complaints from these offices that are used to catered lunches. In fact, people are always surprised with how tasty the food is even though the lunches are much more healthier than your usual catering suspects such as Olive Garden or Papa John's.  

Delightful Chefs will also tailor your menu to any dietary needs. I once had a client who is vegan and gluten free and Delightful Chefs were able to come up with a veggie wraps that even the client praised the quality of the wrap! 

I highly recommend the Delightful Chefs for your catering needs.",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,2,1,5,u3QitDcpZTvpOK2sBAh6OQ

Most of the guests complimented the food and the service. The chefs went above and beyond making sure everything was perfect including picking up extra supplies that we were in need of from the grocery store.

I attended one of her events called Tuesdays with Chef Kristina at Cafe De Cebu, and it was an awesome experience - great ambiance, wonderful time with friends and scrumptiously delicious food!!! Chef Kristina takes Filipino-American cuisine to another level of artistry, class and especially taste. I missed her last Tuesday event but I heard it was even better! I am definitely going to the next one!!",qqmjDTYaQv23mSEPBZC79A,1,2,5,ShCZcKx1bg9bspnuQU5HJg
5962913,2018-02-18,4,4UvQ0BUbqlNPJbAggsi0eA,"I am going to make this review short, sweet, and to the point!  Delightful Chefs is AMAZING!!

White Chocolate Halaya Cheesecake!!  Sorry, just had to mention this.  Chef Kristina is an amazing personal chef, and this is one of the desserts that she made for us!!!!  She saves you time and meal prep.  Need an event catered?  She can arrange that as well.

When you hire her just ask her to create some of her specialty dishes.  You wont regret it.  She specializes in many Filipino inspired dishes, but she can cook any genre of cuisine very well!!  

The Delightful chefs team is awesome!!  They can customize your meals or events just the way you want.  Highly Recommend!!",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,10,8,5,dk20r5MVICXY9nI7U0c2_Q
