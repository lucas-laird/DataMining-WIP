Building codes require them for a reason and your business is violating the law.

150634,2015-04-16,1,Ic3YMUPg_DCNpp4y3B-2bw,First time today eating McDonald's in a year or so. I use to go to a bad Mcdonald over there on lake mead . And I use to always always get old cold food every time no matter what time we went so I stopped eating and I went to 5 other bad locations after. But today I was happy with the service and fresh food for once. I live 5 minutes away and my food was still hot.,GVDbNHmsK-bWT-emlo9Ghg,0,0,4,aVy9p8i5dsl6voxgXrQu3w

The condemned can ask for any spread if it doesn't contain alcohol. According to an interesting statistic I recently came across, the most popular request in American prisons has always been food from Kentucky Fried Chicken. If I were about to meet my maker, via electric chair, lethal injection, or firing squad my last request might also be KFC. If it were truly my final meal I wouldn't have to worry about calories, cholesterol, or heart disease; I would want to make sure my last dinner was delicious and denounced by cardiologist worldwide.

Alas, my eating habits are determined by my metabolism. When I eat Kentucky Fried Chicken I must do so sparingly and deal with the consequences. While I don't get to KFC that often anymore, I savor the unhealthy food just like I imagine a death row inmate might.

I do miss Kentucky Fried Chicken's Little Bucket Parfaits. The discontinued Chocolate Cr√®me Parfait was just about the best dessert I've ever had. I must deduct one star from my overall rating because no meal at KFC is complete without a Parfait. Bring back the Little Buckets!",6jdudiohNa3_nkpebJuTzQ,2,2,4,tIWXj8gFhNHI4Bk75kp3Tw
2640274,2018-05-12,0,Ic3YMUPg_DCNpp4y3B-2bw,If I could give this place negative stars I would give them the negative 5. Their service is horrible. There was no greeting and every employee seemed so focused on drive through that my boyfriend stood in front of the register for over 2 minutes and even though the crew made eye contact with him and even passed by in front of him a few times no one acknowledged him. He finally asked if they were still open and the crew member passing by said no and kept walking toward the drive through. I couldn't believe the attitude and bad service. I love KFC and sometimes even stop by just for the busicutes and mac and cheese which was the case that night. My boyfriend walked out and I asked to speak to the manager. She too was working the drive through and had me wait at least 3 minutes before she came forward. I told her what happened which I'm sure she knew since she was in the room when it happened. I asked her why she allowed such poor service. I asked her why all her employees were in the back working drive through and the front was being ignored during open hours. All she said was she was sorry it happened. I want to mention her name and the rude boy in this review but I just honestly think she and the entire store crew needs to get retrained,YJhNVi7YHizC4jKZoml8RA,0,0,1,RuOg-WFs3NPRteAbdLKetA

I pull up to the drive thru and order with two people talking to me thru the drive thru box not taking my order serious at all.  Then I pay at the second window where the tell me to pull up and wait for 5 minutes so they can bring my food out. I wait for 10 mins & one of the employees walks out and asks what I'm doing there waiting . I told him that the employee I paid with told me to pull up here for my food. Then he asks what I order & tried saying I didn't order & accused me of not paying . He then brings out the employee that I paid with where he too didn't know what I was talking about. Literally the most stupidest fucks I've ever had to deal with . Never coming here again. All together I was here for about 35 mins.,xwRBHCD--9Mq9SiU9oyZ6Q,1,0,1,8SuN8g5te3HIO9jdkQ29_A

4672196,2016-05-18,0,Ic3YMUPg_DCNpp4y3B-2bw,I haven't been to this location in over a year because my order was always wrong. I gave it a chance last night. I waited in the drive through for 7 mins because the person in front of me order was wrong. Instead of having them pull in front because there was a line and bring there order out to them they sat at the window. when I finally made it to the window the guy didn't say sorry for your wait he just said your total is XXXX. I said usually you say sorry for the wait and your total is seeing ive been sitting here for 7 mins. He says ohhhh 7 mins. and takes my card. That was rude. He gave me my card back and said the guys order was wrong and we had to fix it. Not apologizing for the wait. Now I remember why I stopped going to KFC. Your order is never right and the service is horrible this is so disappointing.,uqPvZT5bdnPwmri8HS8z4g,1,0,1,s8VY4fh3wKouaCTzTp8sng
