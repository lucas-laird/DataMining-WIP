Upon arrival we were ""greeted"" by a pretty enough but sullen young woman who seemed put out that we were there.  She picked up a couple of menus and just started walking...no ""right this way"" or anything else.  It was just kind of an unwelcome feeling.
The room feels a little tight, so i would next time request a booth for a little more intimacy.

I had the scallops with wasabi sauce, it was fantastic! The Scallops were well cooked, and the mashed potatoes ensure that you have enough food and won't go home hungry. As an added bonus, the green beans are well seasoned and taste more like a treat than a boring vegetable.

We ordered the oysters for appetizers. The oysters themselves were good, but the shell still had salt water in it. Fresh is good. Salt water is not good. It was a little disappointing and damaged the taste of the oysters. But, again, you can taste the quality.

The service was great, they checked in with us regularly, kept our drinks full, and made sure there was always fresh bread and butter on the table.

We were seated across from the amazing floor-to-ceiling aquarium per request at the time I made reservations.  That was pleasant.

Jeanette seemed to have a firm grasp of the menu and specials.  I picked a wine but sent it back before it was opened. And this is a peeve of mine and it just doesn't happen here:  Order a modest-medium price bottle of wine, say 50-$70, and it comes with a metal screw-cap.  Could probably pick it up from Trader Joe's for about $7.  Was offered other suggestions, more than I wanted to spend.  Ordered a couple of glasses from a label I knew and trusted.

Our menu was personalized to recognize our anniversary.  

I had the Roasted Beet Salad which may be one of the best salads I ever had.  Arugula, roasted beets (tastier than I expected) pickled onions, candied pecans, blue cheese, all perfectly dressed in a vinaigrette.  My wife had the Ceasar.  She is a Ceasar connoisseur (she makes a damned good one, herself).  She didn't complain or compliment, only to say it was a decent sized salad.  They both were. 

Fresh sourdough rolls were served right out of the oven and we had to fight the urge not to ask for more.  The entrees came out a shade too early, but that sure beats coming out late.

I had the Seafood Specialty plate:  coconut shrimp, calamari, fish, and lobster tail -- all fried. The calamari was good, cooked right with a decent breading.  The shrimp was way overcooked.   The type of fish was unknown, but it was almost inedible because of the greasy batter.  The lobster (which I suspect was a prawn) should probably never be prepared in this fashion to begin with.  Texture ok, but no flavor.  I fault myself for ordering a fried dish.  Even still, it certainly could have been better.

My wife had the Shrimp and Scallop dish.  Served with spinach gnocchi and corn in a heavy sauce.  The seafood was cooked well.  The rest of the dish seemed overly heavy and rich with little to offer the palate.  

We had ordered the Gran Marnier souffle early on and it came out right on time looking gorgeous. Turned heads on its way to the table.  Served with little pitchers of raspberry and chocolate sauces.   It might have benefitted with a few more minutes in the oven, but it was very tasty.  No hint of Gran Marnier, however.  

We agree that we probably should have just stuck with the salads and maybe an appetizer (or another Roasted Beet Salad!!).  We've had much better seafood dishes which cost less.  We did not expect this from a restaurant associated with the largest seafood restaurant chain in the free world.",3vcAa4kBWe_0EfoQaMLqpg,2,1,3,d-Jj2T0L--omyoooU45Rjw
283318,2016-06-27,0,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"We dined at the Chart House on 6/16/16 and had a wonderful time. Our waiter, Harris, made our experience truly exceptional. His recommended menu items were all perfect from the  Ssamjang Shrimp appetizer through our entrees: Mac Nut Mahi for me and Cuban Spiced Scallops & Shrimp for Patrick. The Chart House Souffle we had for dessert was a first for us and was also excellent. 

The dining room atmosphere was a welcome grotto of calm in the craziness that is a LV Casino floor which went unseen and unheard just around the corner.

This was the second time we've eaten at the Chart House and I can't say enough about the amazing service Harris provided. He even went above and beyond in consulting with his coworkers to provide us with recommendations for the best night clubs to visit on our final evening in town.

The ambiance was great, loved the lighting coming from the aquarium. We have a Chart House in Honolulu, but the ambiance is nothing like this.

Our appetizers were good. I really loved our East Meets West, sliced seared ahi and ahi tartare with plantain chips with some sort of slaw. The bruschetta sliders were good, but not super memorable. However, the crab cake in my entree (the Mixed Seafood Platter, I believe...?) was one of the best. Like, actual chunks of crab and lighter on the bread crumbs. 

And when your server encourages you to order dessert at the same time as the rest of the meal, you do it. They say that the dessert takes a bit of time to make. Our molten cake (with Heath crumbles!) came out and we. Mopped. It. Up.

449116,2011-03-24,0,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"We made reservations to Chart House on my birthday since we were going to be downtown for the St. Patrick's day festivities and I had a pretty decent group with me. Having dinner in front of the fish tank was awesome but made me wonder if the fish I was eating was the lucky one to get plucked outta the tank. 

I was surprised that they had made a personalized menu for my table. Apparently they ask if anyone is celebrating a special occasion when you call to make reservations. I thought this was pretty cool. Plus they let me keep the personalized menus. A very nice gesture.

Ok on to the food, the sea bass with saffron risotto was tasty. I think I enjoyed that better than my dish. I had the stuffed flounder, which was good but the flounder had no flavor and a little dry until you mixed it with the crab. The sea bass though, mmm. I also heard that the jumbo stuffed shrimp, surf & turf, and fish & chips were very enjoyable. 

Overall the experience was awesome especially since it was in downtown. Our waiter Eddie was funny, very helpful and willing to split our checks. Towards the end of our dining experience, they brought out their Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Eddie initiated the Happy Birthday song. Kudos to this guy!

734872,2015-07-11,0,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"What I found ridiculous are as follows:
Cost: $70/person including tip and tax. We didn't order dessert. We had a salad, drinks for 3 and no alcohol. Only ordered one entree per person. 

Service: really pushy. They force you to have everything and make it rather embarrassing to reject it. 

Food: it's mediocre. My mother ordered shrimp entree. It was hard and not juicy. I don't know why/how they overcook shrimp so much. On the other hand, rice was undercooked. Caesar salad was really terrible. It was ultra salty. Lobster was ok, but rather mediocre for $72 entree. 

What I found kinda interesting was just fish tank. But you can see fish tank in the swimming pool too, so why bother?

If you want to waste your money because you won in casino, go ahead and eat here.  Otherwise, I recommend to check out Paradise buffet in downtown. It is only $16 per person w drink. There are tons of better deals in buffet in las vegas hotels. Bellagio is good and even Caesars palace buffet costs less than this. 

I believe if I pay extra money like more than $50 per person, I expect a better return and quality food, and unfortunately, this restaurant failed my expectation miserably. Never returning here. Thanks for reading.",eMeTSybkGMD0nz5XPid2RQ,0,0,1,6oVHLdsFdBird4CmV_wK6A

In a town of celebrity chefs, and literally thousands of dining options, the Chart House at the Golden Nugget holds its own.

This is not the first visit to the Chart House. I live in close proximity to the one in Marina Del Rey, and my wife and I dine at the Las Vegas location whenever we stay at the Nugget. I can honestly say I do not remember a bad experience at the Las Vegas location, and this weekend was no exception. Both the service and the food were top notch. This particular evening we were in the mood for steak, and did not want to pay Vic and Anthony's inflated prices.

We started with the crab, shrimp, and vegetable fritters, a diversion from our usual lobster bisque. These were great, and the kimchee sauce is a nice twist. Our entrees were the prime rib for myself (Callahan cut, of course) and the filet medallions for my wife. Both were cooked perfectly to our preference, and satisfied our carnivorous cravings. Service was great, and our waitress was friendly and very accommodating.

My only gripe is the beer selection. VERY limited. These days everyone is into these craft brews and etc, to only offer the usual junk seems like a misstep. I wanted some kind of amber, and best I could get was a Sam Adams. While annoying, I didn't deduct any stars for this. 

TIP: Sign up for the Landry's Select Club. You'll get a $25 reward once you spend $250 in a year. I believe you also get $25 just for signing up, but I can't remember if it has to be used on a future visit.

Those oysters are to date the best my husband and I have ever eaten and they were huge. The seafood tower tasted fresh-caught and included more oysters, shrimp, a split lobster tail and split king crab legs. For our entree, we got the grilled swordfish topped with crab, asparagus and bearnaise. He loved it, I was less crazy about it because it came on top of some kind of spicy sauce that was not on the menu. We could not stop dreaming of those oysters, so we actually went back the next evening for dinner and sadly, they were out of them. We ordered the seafood tower and the waitress told us they only had saved enough for the towers! Score! I probably could have eaten a bucket of those, they were so delicious .My husband got an order of kimchi calamari and I could not stop eating it. We also had the coconut shrimp which come butterflied in an edible rice paper ""clamshell"" and they were delicious too. The sauces were especially good. The hot chocolate lava cake comes with vanilla heathbar toffee ice cream and is too big for one person- split it!  It is a lovely room with the aquarium-quality fish tank dominating the decor.

He indulged her every complaint and criticism with a smile which saved the night. I was personally embarrassed for our snob's behavior but Ott rolled with the punches. He brought out several glasses of wine for her to taste. He also exchanged a perfectly good salad. The food was good, as expected. The setting is very cool because of a gigantic saltwater fish tank with more than 100 fish.

The Chart House lured us in with their gorgeous decor and particularly their giant aquarium in the middle.  What was going to just be a drink and apps turned into dinner. 

We started out with a yummy Hummus trio- I especially liked the Edamame flavor, which was refreshingly different.  For dinner, I had the seafood mixed grill: mahi, mediterrenean shrimp, and a crab cake.  It was all fantastic, especially the shrimp.  I could eat that shrimp every day for the rest of my life.  The fiance had a NY Strip- beautifully cooked and tender.  We also got a side of fried mac n' cheese and it was heavenly.

My husband had a $3 Miller Lite, and I had two $4 Beefeaters and soda. Healthy pours on that gin! For snacks, we chose the $6 lettuce wraps and $7 firecracker shrimp. Surprisingly, for a place known for its seafood, I much preferred the lettuce wraps, which had a nice combination of chicken and vegetables with a sweet soy glaze. The shrimp were touted as being ""tossed in a spicy kim chee sauce,"" which sounded great, but the sauce was more like the ""spicy"" (not spicy) mayo served on sushi rolls, and the shrimp themselves were flaccid and flavorless.

He likes to use the phrase ""flavor profile"" and it was his suggestion that the Filet would be the best I'd tasted that caused me to order it.

It wasn't. Not even close. Not only was the stake just ok, it was undercooked (I ordered medium rare, not bloody). In addition, I'd asked for a glass of the Pinot Noir that he suggested to be delivered just prior to my meal so I could enjoy the two together. After another waiter brought our entrees and I was 1/2 way through my mediocre steak, Harris showed up to ask how things were. ""Just ok. And where is my wine?"" That led to his over explaining about the pain of splitting a check at another table... blah blah blah. 

I was within 1-2 bites of finishing my steak when Harris appeared again with my wine. ""No thanks, Harris. It's just too late.""

My SO's chicken was dry and tasteless. If it weren't for the lovely, large aquarium nearby the meal would have been a total bust. Harris would be better served to promise less greatness. I wouldn't have been so disappointed if he hadn't been so certain in his glowing recommendations.

Although I am not sure if she meant on her plate, or to take home? We particularly had good service. Altogether the ambiance was fun, but I would not suggest for small children as it is a quieter restaurant in a rather big casino environment.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their appetizers on the table. My MIL had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which came stunningly on a vapor-like dry-ice display. Very cool. I turned to the Menage soups, which were size proportionate. In this moment I realized I am not fond of tomato based gazpacho, in general, as this a second attempt - but you may like it. However, the lobster bisque was extremely creamy,  and the clam chowder was the same with many small pieces of clam.

My main dish was the mixed seafood grill, which again was proportionate. I was definately rooting for the grilled citrus salmon on the plate- delicious!. The asperagus was perfect as a refesher when moving between the crab cakes, shrimp & Salmon. My husband had the  Spiced Yellowfin Ahi to Chef recommendation (Slightly seared & rare), which was also delish. In fact I would have been greedy and jealous had I not had a good plate myself.

The apple crisp was good, with a slight sweetness. Not what you would want for a sweettooth (i would go for the creme brulee if so), it was perfect to my taste- but once again, not super sweet.

I frequent a Chart House near my home and love it so I had high expectations for the Las Vegas location. Let's start off with the positive -- I heard that they recently renovated the restaurant and it shows.  There is a large fish tank that is the center of the restaurant -- so pretty.  The restaurant is rather small so you feel cramped in depending on where your table is located.  Janea was our server for the night -- we had some questions on the menu and she had to leave and ask someone else each time.  Doesn't really give you a vibe that she knows what she's doing.  She also didn't come around enough to check if we needed anything like drink refills etc.  One of the appetizers that Chart House is known for is their crab avocado mango stack.  It's an appetizer that I get every time I go to the location near my home because it's so good.  This appetizer in the Las Vegas Charthouse?  Not that great.  One of my friends had the prime rib and it was loaded with fat -- should you expect that for an entree that cost $32.00?  I don't think so.  I had the stuffed shrimp which was nothing to write home about and someone else had the shrimp pasta entree -- they didn't like theirs either.  How could this location be so different?

The huge fish tank is awesome, but it apparently dictated the set up of the entry, which is confusing. The entry isn't marked, and you have to guess that you are supposed to wait on the right side, if the hostess has stepped away. 

The food was not as good as I expected, for the price. I believe my crab stuffed flounder or sole filet was around $25-30. It was a bit bland. The most disappointing part was that I bit into three large bones, on my very first bite. I've filleted fish, and the chef or whoever stuffed the fish, should have felt those bones.

My boyfriend was happy with his coconut shrimp. I tasted it and thought it was good, but not wonderful.

this is my first time in vegas, and i had my heart set on eating dinner at jose andres meat bazaar.  however- after spending all afternoon hoofing it on the strip, i really wasn't in the mood to head out again from where i was staying (i was tired, and cab fare is NOT cheap...).  with six restaurants on site at the golden nugget, i thought i could certainly find a suitably ""vegas"" meal right here.  i did, with just a few items to note:

location:
i'm staying in the carson tower, and the restaurant is located in the rush tower.  it was a bit of a walk, but i did it just fine in heels, so it's not that far.  i was dining alone and, usually would do that at a bar.  however, after the day of crowds, noise, and bustle, i actually wanted a table to myself.  i was seated at a small table directly adjacent to the back side of the floor-to-ceiling aquarium.  i could not have asked for a better spot, truly.  the water, the activity of the fish- it was all beautifully calming.

the menu here is pretty traditional seafood/steakhouse fare.  i was in the mood for a steak, but knew that there were other possibilities for that later in my stay, so i chose to focus on seafood.  per my usual, i went with a few small plates, instead of a traditional entree.

i ordered the lobster bisque first.  while the flavor was excellent, this is by far the thinnest in texture ""bisque"" i've ever had before.  i'm unsure if that's intentional, or if this  was just a young bisque that didn't have enough time to reduce.  i would order it again, but it's just not what one might expect when you hear the word ""bisque.""

for my entree, i ordered three items: the crab cake appetizer, and sides of gorgonzola risotto and creamed spinach.  the crab cake was fairly small, for its $16 price tag, but the crab flavor was in the forefront, and the corn & avocado salsa was a nice compliment.  the creamed spinach was truly out of this world.  it was mostly spinach, with just a touch of creaminess.  i didn't even feel badly about eating it, that's how spinach-y it tasted.  the gorgonzola risotto, however, was a major disappointment.  if i was the type of diner who asked for items to be removed from my bill, this would be the meal where i would have pulled that card.  while the risotto was well-cooked, the only discernable flavor was garlic.  there was nothing gorgonzola or bleu cheese about it.

the food was largely good, service was excellent, and the atmosphere was a lovely departure from the usual.  i would definitely eat here again, but it might not be my first choice, with so many other options at my finger tips.",iY9JDeZb9s9L9wGGJrx36w,2,0,4,IDOdOV367WoyduoJ0El8ng

I frequented the Chart House on Oahu many times. I had fond memories of their happy hour, great view, and amazing food. I did learn that many of them are now Landry's, including the one here in Vegas. However, upon viewing the menu, I was happy to see it was similar to the Chart House menu I remember. 

I was very happy to have included a meal here during my Downtown staycation for Valentine's weekend this year. Here's what our table had to eat, devoured is more like it!

Kim Chee Calamari
Spanish Blues Mussels
Filet Mignon
Lobster Tail
Tour de Shrimp
Chocolate Lava Cake. Ordered. Got full. Vowed to attempt next visit!

The food was great. Kim Chee Calamari was recommended to us, it's very different than your typical calamari appetizer, but delicious! I would probably pass on the mussels, it was prepared well but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend enjoyed his perfectly cooked filet, but noted that the 4oz lobster tail add-on wasn't worth the price. My favorite shrimp preparation for my Tour de Shrimp entree was with the cedar plank chimichurri. As you can imagine, this was a classic case of ""Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs."" We had pre-ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake (takes about 30mins), however, we didn't come close to having room for it. Leaving with our doggy-bags, we promised to return for dessert another night!

I'd have to say that Chart House is more casual than I anticipated. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic night, I'm not sure if it's kid-friendly, but definitely a great choice for dinner with friends and family. 

Last but not least, we had the pleasure of having one of the best servers ever, Valerie. She was amazing! She made great menu recommendations, timely and efficient, great personality, and at the same time, let us have our evening without hovering the table. We didn't think our entrees took a long time to arrive, but she said it had been delayed in the kitchen. The manager came by to apologize for the wait, and Valerie still checked up on us. As we apologized for cancelling our dessert, she was quick to say it was no problem and effortlessly sold it to her other table. We will definitely request Valerie for our next dinner there!

The short ribs weren't as tender as they should be and were accompanied by dry & tasteless mashed potatoes. The lobster grilled cheese sandwich was ok but the lobster bisque it came with was too salty. Overall it was a disappointing meal and the $75 lunch tag didn't make it any better.

It was a huge portion of the ahi tuna. It was cooked to perfection just as I ordered, seared on the outside and nearly raw on the inside. It was absolutely scrumptious. It cut it with a fork and melted in the mouth. The two pieces of ahi came over a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes. These look great and a perfect complement to the meal.

The food was good, but at these prices it should be exceptional. The service however was exemplary.

We stuck to the fish dishes as that was their specialty. Overall pretty well done, but their Ahi Tuna plate could use some work. The fish was too warm, it should be seared on the outside and cold on the inside. The sauces served with it were very bland, even the Wasabi sauce had no zing. One of our party had the Prime Rib, it was stringy, under done. He could only eat about half of it, the rest was trim. Another had the deep fried seafood combo plate. Greasy and over cooked. Other two mains were okay, but not spectacular. The Creme Brule for dessert was their best dish by far.

At an average of $40 per entree, not cheap and I am convinced the quality of the food does not warrant the prices they charge.

1852589,2017-08-10,0,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"Some friends and I were in town for CosmoProf, the largest convention in the beauty industry. Let me start off by saying our service was wonderful. Our waiter was a nice man (I am completely blanking on his name right now but will update this review if any of my friends remember) who was very catering to myself, my husband, our little one and another couple (5 dinners in total). 
We loved the ambiance. The aquarium is quite impressive and left my 5 month old son something very interactive to stare at. The restaurant itself isn't too large but very open while still portraying a modern feel.
We started with a calamari appetizer, 3 mojitos and a glass of Malbec.
The Calamari was cooked to perfection and had a nice crunch to it. 
The mojitos were delish and the Malbec hit the spot.
We wanted to really enjoy our evening so next we ordered some soups and salads and another round of drinks.
The Clam Chowder was nice, it wasn't too salty and had a smooth texture.
The Brie and Berry Salad was divine. It had just the right balance of acidity along with very tasty candied pistachios.
The Roasted Beet Salad was also delish! The vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering letting all the ingredients in the salad still stand out.
We then ordered Swordfish, Shrimp Pasta, Filet Mignon and Prime Rib.
Now here comes the 2 star part, and it's not because the entrees were horrible but the whole ordeal in what it took to even getting our entrees. 
HERE GOES: About 20 minutes after we placed our entree orders our server came up to us and told us they were ""out of mashed potatoes"" We of coarse were shocked, like what do you mean you're out of mashed potatoes, half our party ordered them to go with their steaks. He then continued to offer us a rice instead....that's a no, I mean C'mon it's steak. Then he comes back and tells us ""wait!.... I can have the mashed potatoes ready in 45 minutes"". 
What is this??? POTATOEGATE?? First the potatoes are there, then they are out, then they can be ready in 45 minutes??? We agree to wait (over an hour at this point) and simply ask that we receive a free lava cake in compensation for our time. We are a reasonable bunch and understand that miscommunication happens. Well almost an hour goes by and finally our long awaited entrees arrive, they were all tasty except for one little thing. OUR MASHED POTATOES WERE COLD. Which was extremely surprising since we waited almost an hour for them. Clearly they were frozen and just thawed to the plate.
We then asked to speak to a manager, we told her the ordeal and let her know that our server was not at fault and that he had been extremely kind. She however was very RUDE. It was clear she has not had much experience in the industry and offered us no explanation as to why our food was cold and didn't even offer an apology. I have never seen such disregard for the customer.
When our lava cake arrived our server let us know that the manager did not approve for it to be comped. Which was an even more telling sign that she simply has no regard for customer experience. Our bill was almost $400 and she couldn't comp a $12 cake. Definitely not the level of service you expect when going to fine dining restaurant.

Coming here, despite being located in downtown Las Vegas, you end up paying prices seen on The Strip. That being said, they definitely price and shape their dishes and sides to encourage ""3 dollar sign"" or over food bills. I've had expensive filet minion elsewhere and was given good veggie and carb choices included in the meals whereas here you'll have to get your own veggies. My young hen dish, although on the cheaper side, came with meager veggie sides (burn and shriveled) and two sad little potatoes. Then hen was also basically four small, if at least flavorful, roasted leg pieces.

Ok ignoring the overpriced food, they do have a large menu selection and also seem to specialize in cooked seafood dishes. And I must say their service is exceptional as the staff works tirelessly to make sure you are taken care of.

Despite being disappointed with my food quantities, the flavors of the main dish was there and the potato mash and crab cake sides were good. That and the huge soufflé option made the meal interesting and deserving of 3 stars. Honestly I would go elsewhere and spend money to get the most out of it.

The oysters were good. 
The orange / avacado salad was killed with red onion (a seasonal special?) and no other flavor in the dressing. The ceasar salad very good.

brick chicken was a dry flat piece of jerky with no seasoning. Her marinated tomahawk lamb chops (again no salt or pepper) overcooked and flavorless.

Finally, decaf coffee absolutely the worst coffee in LV - they didn't offer to take it off the bill (again they had no idea of our comp)

They are now owned by ""the Billion Buyer"" who is a restaurant magnet. So, the wait staff did push the $25 Landry's Club card. We bought figuring the waitress got points for selling it - she was very pleasant.

We came here one night on my golden birthday celebration weekend in Las Vegas. This place is amazing.

Although it was pricey, it had won some cool awards and the atmosphere drew us in (who can resist a HUGE fish tank in the middle of the place??).

We got lucky and scored a table right next to the fish tank. Our waiter was super, super friendly and cordial.

The meal almost started good. We had to wait a while to order, but maybe there was an issue. 

After we were able to order, the server kept talking over me, but we were able to order our appetizer: oysters. 

Then the entrees: here's where service and managerial failures collide. I ordered the wok fried fish- I got baked fish (which was caught by another server who was great- seriously we may have had the one bad server in the room). We were going to a show, so we didn't have time for another entree, plus they ruined the last fish anyway. 

Then the manager came over and gave the obligatory apology. It would've been ok at Applebee's, but come on, it's a fine dining restaurant. 

Ordered dessert which was supposed to be ""lemon cucumber ice cream"". Unfortunately, the server forgot to mention the heavy amount of basil, so it was inedible. 

I tried to stay positive, but everything just added up. 

I went to talk to the manager, because $170 is a lot  to spend on some oysters and a crab cake. 

She didn't care. She gave another fake apology and said, "" I wasn't aware of the other issues."" I didn't realize there was a number of issues that had to happen before a manager did anything. I just figured that if I went out to dinner, I'd actually get to eat dinner. 

Now I can't go back, because of this.

For dessert we had the mud pie and the chocolate molten cake! Both were phenomenal. You have to order the molten cake when you Order your entree, since it takes them a while to make it. It was really really good!

2256902,2017-02-15,8,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"A quaint seafood restaurant located in the Golden Nugget. Upon approach the entry is bit confusing and uninviting. The hostess stand is more just the end peice of the bar, which would make sense because to your left is the lounge seating area and to the right is seating for the actual bar.

As for ambiance and decor, there is a large aquarium in the center of the restaurant which is filled with beautiful fish. Creates an illustrious allure.

At first we were a bit taken back we were brought to a table that was in the middle of the bar/lounge area. We asked to be reseated in the main dinning room. We were really sure why we would be seated in the noisy bar that was filled with groups of people just drinking vs the actual dining room since we were there for dinner. Nonetheless, that was a bit of a upsetting start.

After being sat at our table, someone offered us water but spilled it on the table and never wiped it up. We ended up wiping it up ourselves. We were greeted and welcomed by our server and offered cocktails. We tried the infused dill drink. Presentation was unique and new. The drink itself was good, not too strong and a great pre-dinner drink. 

We started with the oysters. First thought, they were huge. Unfortunately, not the tastiest. They weren't amongst the freshest and required extra lemons to be squeezed over them. Next we had the lobster bisque and chopped salad. The bisque was good only thing is it wasn't very warm upon being served, more like room temp so that was a bit disappointing. Chopped salad on the other hand was crazy good!

Side note: they had this brown bread (forgot the name) that was Delicious!! 

As we moved onto our entree we ordered a bottle of Paraduxx wine. One of my absolute favorite wines. I ordered the lamb chops with fingerling vegetables and a side of creamed spinach. The lamb chops were prepared medium rare. Probably one of the best lamb chops I have had. The sauce served over it was a little strong however it didn't take away from the meal itself.   I love creamed spinach and always get it when I see it on the menu so I had to have it. They serve it with crushed bread crumbs over it, different. 

Food overall was acceptable. It is a pretty average menu restaurant with no real special items or distinct flavors. For the price I feel there are other seafood restaurants  that are much more worth it. 

So why 4 stars, simple...our server Julie was amazing! Seriously if it wasn't for her I probably would have given 2 or 3 stars. Julie was all smiles from start to finish. She had quality suggestions, was extremely pleasant and best of all she connected with us throughout our dining experience. We had a couple small 30 second chats here and there which left us forgetting about our unsatisfactory moments. 

I love trying new places, living in Las Vegas there are tons of spots to try and I'm always up for new experiences. If we ever come back I'm definitely going to ask for Julie.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,12,11,4,KATshiGRskwgGhF7uZIkaA

The gorgeous decor and ambiance are matched only by the top notch service!

The location: located inside The Golden Nugget hotel right off of Fremont Street this elegant location is a welcome surprise tucked in the corner away from cigarettes and noise. Beautiful floral arrangements offset the AMAZING fish tank that has a serious *wow* factor. Candle light, nice flatware.

Drinks: I had the tastiest mango mojito in Las Vegas,  sweet and minty, light ice, refreshing. My husband said the IPA was *nutty* and bold.

I ordered the seafood platter. Outstanding,tempura tilapia, shrimp, lobster, grilled scallops with skinny fries and plantain chips, served three sauces, a sweet chili, cocktail and tartar.

My husband had the steak, perfectly prepared medium rare,  fully loaded potatoes w/bacon, cheese, butter, sour cream, scallions and a side of veggies.

The girls both had the shrimp tempura with fries they gobbled up happily before we could get a sample! Shirley Temples, extra cherries. 

The dessert was a DESSERT!!! It states on the menu that each chocolate molten lava cake is prepared individually and that you must allow 30 minutes for your order. Great decision to order before dinner, large cake served with hand churned peanut butter chocolate iced cream drizzled with fudge.

Oh yeah,  we will be back! Five star service, no holes to speak of.

The food is excellent.  We had the pan seared scallops ($29) and the seared chilean sea bass ($38) which were both very tasty.  Also the sizzling mushrooms as a side ($8), which were also very good.  I love mushrooms.

The best part was the shrimp cocktail ($15) which comes with dry ice!  Really cool effect. 

The service was very attentive but I got the constant ""upsell"" vibe from our server.  She kept pushing certain products and wanted us to join the frequent diner club.  I know this place is a chain but they need to let their server lay off and be themselves.

The fish tank is really cool and makes for good conversation.  If it seems to pricey for dinner, check it out for lunch where the prices are less and the portion sizes are about the same.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,3,2,4,gMTPe5gJP55jpvSbpGLEaw

We started our weekend Las Vegas trip with a fabulous dinner at Chart House, inside the Golden Nugget Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. We made reservations, so there was no wait and we were seated quickly. 

We were seated at a very comfortable table near a television, which was important as the LA Clippers were playing. The restaurant is simply gorgeous, with a massive aquarium in the center of the restaurant, and everyone gets a great view of the marine life. 

Our party of 5 ordered several different appetizers to share: Crispy Coconut Shrimp, Cold Shrimp and Lobster Egg Rolls, and Fish Tacos, all of which were excellent. The group went through quite a bit of wine and liquor, and although I don't typically drink, I certainly enjoyed the Fleur de Lis on the cocktail menu!

I had the Chilean Sea Bass, a first for me, and it was delectable. Tender, flaky and the port wine sauce was stellar. Everyone in the group was very pleased with the quality and taste of the food. 

If there was ONE negative thing to say about the Chart House, it was the Souffle. Very, very boring and unimpressive. Tasted like egg whites, and that's it. But aside from that, we had nothing else to complain about!

We had never been to the Chart House before, but I can assure you it will NOT be our last visit. Well worth every penny!",Cvz4v8jRj7Z1cgz8WJuqtw,1,0,5,fvRjXSNFD03m0E8UoD7JlQ

The wait was minimal and the reservation time was met spot-on.  

No alchohol involved, but the ice water and tea were served with smiles and efficiency.  Appetizers of calemari (and friends/thin sliced sweet potato fries and other tasty things) and bruschetta sliders got the talk started on the tasty tidbits.  For my entre', 

I selected the 8oz filet that came with a side of mashed potatos that I wish I could make at home.  The beet was perfectly seasoned, perfectly grilled to a nicely pink medium and was as tender as it needed to be.  My co-horts selected prime-ribs and a variety of the seafood plates, including the mixed seafood grill (which is on my ""next time"" list).  

To cap off a great main course, we wrapped things up with a totally awesome slice of mud-pie that was meant to feed at least the seven of us.  Portioned nicely by our server, everyone was able to leave the table totally satisfied with a slightly mocha aftertaste.

The service wasn't the best but its wasn't the worst. (I have to say though for a meal that ended up costing us $200 plus dollars I feel we should've had a little better service.)
I was pretty upset cause it ended our night on a bad note and I felt terrible for wasting money on a meal like this! Even the vegetables that came on the side were overcooked and mushy with no flavor. So bad that even my boyfriend said that the hot dogs at the (Viva Las Vegas) show were WAY better than his crab legs!

While all Chart House locations are usually built around some water-related view, I had read that this Las Vegas location was built with a view of the shark tank.  It wasn't.  It's true there was a view of a large salt water aquarium but not a view of the shark tank that makes up the middle of the Golden Nugget swimming pool, which was very disappointing.

I walked into the bar at the Chart House and with the help of the super nice bartender, put two two tables together and WA LA! Instant meeting space! 

During our three hour ""meeting"" our bartender made frequent trips to our table and made sure to keep us ""hydrated'. There were plenty of dirty Ketel One martini's, Hendricks gimlets and refreshing Caipirinhas being served that helped accomplish this. We were so impressed that we booked a 9:00 table for dinner. 

We arrived a little before 9PM and our table was ready. We were seated in full view of one of the most impressive aquariums I have ever seen, full of sharks, moray eels and a bunch of other dangerous looking critters. Our waiter took the time to explain some of his favorite dishes and how they were prepared. But of course we needed to have a few drinks poured first, just to make sure that they were still as good as they were earlier that afternoon. 

The menu is seafood heavy as one would expect, but me who only eats normal food was not left out in the cold. There are plenty of land animals included on the menu as well as a nice selection vegetarian options. When it came time to order I went with the prime rib which came with a side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes and a side of creamed spinach. Our waiter asked how I would like it prepared which I responded ""rare"". Since we were dining later in the evening, he was not sure if this would be possible and would check with the kitchen. When my dish arrived I can tell you, it was without question rare and bloody just like I wanted. It was also served with a a side of jus and horseradish. The cut of meat was very tasty and tender and about as good as I have had anywhere. The creamed spinach was a healthy portion and more than enough to share with the six people at our table. 

Another pleasant surprise was the wine list that actually included many selections that were moderately priced and several even under $40. Typically at nicer restaurants in LV I struggle to find decent wine for under $60. 

It's hard for me to say which I liked more, the restaurant or the bar. The bar here is staffed by some of the most efficient and friendly bartenders in LV who never dare to water down a drink or the restaurant where you are treated to some great food in a comfortable setting.",O8RYLkWNmZYr2HgKWsmwiQ,3,3,4,S5xhStAeATePi8UdhjHSgQ

We went to the Chart House envisioning a nice dinner of prime rib and seafood.  It started out good with drinks and we ordered appetizers of fried calamari.  We ordered dinner and the waiter took the order for half the table and then said, ""oh sorry we are all out of prime rib"". REALLY?!  this is what the restaurant says it is know for and yet you don't have any!  I think that they should have let us know that when we sat down.  Of the 13 people in the party, 9 people had ordered prime rib.  Then in a weird way, the waiter came out and said they found 3 pieces of prime rib.  Where was the prime rib?!  Hidden?!  I spoke to the manager on duty and he didn't seem to be concerned. He told me, ""sorry.""  I mentioned that it should have been shared with us prior to sitting down and he said, ""once I heard your table was ordering prime rib I went to the kitchen and found 3 pieces.  The waiter said that it wasn't a big deal, they had other cuts of meat.  It doesn't sit well when we came in for prime rib. We were provided 3 pieces of ice cream pie for our inconvenience.

This time we left the kid with a sitter and came with a couple of grown ups (technically).  We had just come from some LVMMA fights at the Hilton and were kind of tipsy... I mean, hungry.

The general consensus: We should have just ordered apps.... not entrees.

Once again we went with the calamari and fried mac and cheese as well as lobster spring rolls that were on their special 40th or 50th anniversary menu (like I said... we were too .... hungry.... to remember the details).  The spring rolls were more like massive egg rolls, but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the amazing beet salad again and was stuffed before entrees came out.

As for the entrees, we ordered 2 Chart House platters, free range chicken and the shrimp scampi. The platters were huge and greasy (lobster tail, coconut shrimp, more calamari, french fries.... all deep fried and chewy).  The chicken was small but I guess it was good enough for my lover (who's watching his weight haha) and the scampi ""tasted like Pasta Roni"".

We arrived at the Golden Nugget late Saturday night and were looking for a decent place to eat. We had no idea what the Chart House was all about when we sat down, but we quickly noticed how everything was top-notch. As I was unfolding my white napkin to place on my lap, the hostess stopped me and handed me a black napkin - so the napkin wouldn't leave white lint on my black dress. How attentive and thoughtful!

Drinks: ultimate margarita and strawberry daiquiri - Both were excellent.

Appetizer: hummus sampler - Regular, red pepper and edamame hummus served with bread pieces and plantain chips. I really loved the green taste of the edamame. This was probably enough for three people.

Entree: filet mignon - This comes with mashed potatoes, though they're not mentioned on the menu. I also ordered a loaded baked potato. Everything was excellent, especially the filet which was exactly medium well as requested.

Dessert: chocolate lava cake - This is out of this world. It takes 30 minutes to create after ordering, so order before you're done with your meal. The cake comes with ice cream, hot fudge and Heath bar pieces. Ah-mazing!

I came here to have dinner with my family (party of 8) after I got married and it was terrible. The service was horrible from the server AND the manager! A steak came out well done, rather than medium rare, so it was sent back. Around thirty minutes later, after everyone else was done eating, the steak finally came back out. Mind you, we had to ask the server and the manager twice for it.

When the server handed my mom the bill I checked to see if the steak was on there. It was! I asked the server for this to be removed since he sat there and watched us eat while his medium rare steak took 30 minutes to come back out. She went to ask the manager and he agreed, finally!

Since the tip was automatically factored in for a party of 8, we didn't leave her anything extra. She was rude, slow and unattentive.

What a cool restaurant!  It has a huge fish tank in the middle of it!  

Obviously, they specialize in seafood but also serve up some good land lovers food.  An assortment of breads were served immediately after we were seated (no reservations needed on the Thursday night we dined there).  Shortly, afterwards we were presented our bottle of wine.

Everything is al a carte at Chart House, so be careful not to over-order like us!  We start off our hunger excursion with two salads.  My fiance ordered a caesar* which was average tasting, and I devoured a spinach salad* (YUMMO)!  The salads were both quite large, so you may want to split some of your dishes up.  

And because my fiance's eyes are larger than his stomach, he ordered a bowl of clam chowder*.  This too was quite large.  He said it was one of the best clam chowders he's ever had!

(*Pictures of items)

As most of you Yelpers know, I am a steak lover!  More to the point, a filet mignon lover.  Chart House served a decent filet for a seafood place, though defintely NOT the best I've ever had.  It was large, plump, and cooked near perfectly.  For sides, we ordered the asparagus and fried mac and cheese.  I didn't try the asparagus but did try the fried mac.  It was good but way too big and heavy.  It could've been a meal in itself.

I guess we were hungrier than we thought that night because we had to take a doggy bag home...

2931269,2018-03-26,1,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"Chart house is an amazing dining experience.  In short, the staff communicates and works well together from the front of the house to the back of the house, increasing the odds of an excellent customer experience with well set expectations.

As you enter the business, the Chart House's huge aquarium greets its guests.  If you're lucky enough, you'll sit next to the aquarium and ponder when feeding time is for the fish, if the fish are upset about me eating seafood, and where their eel is hiding.

Harris, our server, was nothing short of exceptional.  He was conversational, an expert in the menu, and catered perfectly to our dietary needs. Beyond the food menu, they boast an fantastic cocktail menu and wine selection - and Harris was great at making drink recommendations based on our specific tastes.

When my wife and I eat seafood, the volume typically gets out of hand.  This visit is no exception.  We had the large tower: not so ""shrimpy"" shrimp, British Columbia oysters, lobster tail, king crab, and tuna.  It's all fresh and enough to feed 4, helping my wife and I exceed the menu's expectations only needing 2 people.  The tuna had a soy sauce accompaniment that the kitchen was kind enough to keep separate due to my gluten free dietary restriction.

For our entrees, my wife had the lobster tail and I had the surf and turf, also with a lobster tail.  They brought my steak and her lobster tail out first both cooked perfectly.  To prove how well they communicate, almost every member of their staff was sure to let me know that my lobster tail was on the way.  It's even nicer to know that the kitchen stopped the delivery of the first tail based on quality - a nice touch to know they're looking out for their customers.

For dessert, we had another cocktail.  There wasn't a chance that these two individuals bursting at the seems and lacking a sweet tooth of any kind would plow down dessert, but there's always room for more alcohol.

Beginning to end an amazing experience that I'd be sure to go out of my way to repeat any time in Las Vegas. It's possibly the best dining experience available off Fremont Street.",MZuvl0oUK3QSv7faGx9i5w,4,2,5,bqsxc8QMhn6gihBYHCVQvg

I brought my family here for a little Valentine's Day late afternoon lunch. When we showed up, the place was empty. Literally, we were the only people sitting in the restaurant which was a little awkward. We were sat promptly and we immediately were in awe of the enormous fish tank. This floor to ceiling is an aquarium lovers wet dream is amazing, ha! It's placed right in the middle of the restaurant and gives diners a great place to rest their eyes and thoughts during lulls in dinner conversation.

We ordered apps and drinks and so far so good. A bottle of wine for the table and I opted for Moscow Mule. It was ok, a little heavy on the ginger beer and light on the vodka. I prefer it the other way around. The apps were amazing; the Kim Chee Calamari was like crack, I would smoke it if allowed. The Kim Chee added that vinegar flavor that went great with lightly fried calamari. There fried veggies and a amazing sauce that accompanied this dish. I highly recommend ordering this dish, but be ready to share because this plate of food is huge! We also ordered the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and these were great. A little outshined after the Kim Chee dish, but still very good. The shrimp was still juicy and not over cooked and the coconut breading was light and just a tad sweet. Yummers. 

At this point in the meal we were all talking, plates were licked clean, and starting to stack up. Just as the restaurant was just starting to get busy our soup and salads were arriving, so you'd think the server would remove the plates that were stacked up, but nope, they stayed on the table. After salads and soups were finished (BTW - Lobster Bisque was quite delicious) this new set of plates and bowls were now added to already decent pile of tableware. There were five of us, so lets do that math... 5 plates for apps + 2 bowls of soup + 2 large salad plates + 2 bread baskets + 5 bread plates +1 bottle of wine + 3 wine glasses + 2 cocktail glasses, and a partridge in a pear tree. That's about 23 items on a table, half of which were dirty and no longer being used. Now, in a normal fine dining restaurant, these items would be cleared immediately and the table would be re-dressed with silverware and napkins. This did not happen. 

The main course showed up and the food runners realized there was absolutely no space for anything on the table. They placed our food off to the side and cleared the table, this took about three minutes. This just shows the amount of stuff that had piled up. Finally, the table is cleared and the food is delivered. 

I'll mainly focus on my meal, but I did try a little bit of everyone's and it all was very good. I ordered the Stuffed Flounder: Crab-stuffed with lemon shallot butter and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. This was delicious, the flounder was perfectly cooked. The tender fish was juicy and just flaked apart when cut into with my fork. The crab was a like an amazing edible surprise, that I had forgot about it until it poured out on to the plate. This plate was not only gorgeous, but a giant seafood flavor bomb. The carb lovers side dish was the beautiful golden mashed potatoes. Buttery, creamy goodness! 

To close out the meal we tried their dessert specials... Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Chart House Souffle. These were both meh, but I'm not a sweet person. So don't take my word for it. 

Wow. I feel like I just had a brain baby with this review. Even though the service was weak, The Chart House's food is stellar and definitely worth the price.

My parents and wife really like this place but I am just not that convinced. The seats in their lounge area are super small, and the tables they have (not at the booth) are even smaller. We ordered 3 happy hour dishes and couldn't fit them on the table. I had to put my drink on the ground and eat from a small dish over my lap. The booths that we sit in sometimes are very comfortable and can hold enough appetizers for the four of us. But the ""table"" by the bar are meant more to set a few drinks down on and look at the aquarium. 

As mentioned above I only really like those apps. I have had the firecracker shrimp and don't think it is spicy enough to warrant ""firecracker"" in the title, and doesn't give off enough kim chee flavor. The prime rib sliders are good, but I am not a fan of the horseradish sauce. Way too much horseradish for my liking. The Humus platter is tasty, but... who goes anywhere just for the humus. 

Maybe I should come in and try the regular menu, but the happy hour is worth the price of drinks and a view of the aquarium. I will say that the $7 cocktails are all well made, and the servers are excellent! See you soon Golden Nugget... and maybe Chart House.",-Fb4gB1z0OKuo42NOoX9pQ,0,0,2,Z3IOOSi5gStXJggwcFEJ1g

Came here on my last visit to Vegas while I was staying at the Golden Nugget. My friend wanted to try the Stone Crabs. I'm not a crab person so I can't really comment- we got 5 claws for $50. Presentation was nice, sauces for dipping were good- what went wrong? My salad. I ordered the beet and arugula salad- but I am allergic to peanuts and shrimp. So I made sure to tell the server about my allergy. (Chart House does not keep any peanuts in the restaurant). That is when the manager came over and informed me what i could order that was free from shrimp and what could be a potential reaction. I told him I was ordering the beet salad- he said that was safe.

The beet salad includes prosciutto crisps, blue cheese, mandarin oranges, red onions, caramelized pecans and the dressing. All I asked was for the cheese the onions on the side. I do not know why we were served a salad with only beets on top of spinach! No arugula. No prosciutto, no pecans, no mandarin oranges- idk what happens from my order being ""I would like the roasted beet salad but can the onions and cheese be on the
side?"" When she brought the salad out I wanted to ask ""so where is the rest of it?"" I ended up just eating it- which I regret I should have sent it back. Not worth regular prices for beets on spinach.

We started off with the charcuterie board to nosh on. I loved all of it except one of the salamis and one of the cheeses were very dry and difficult to chew. Everything else was delicious and I especially loved the smoked ghouda. 

I ordered the 7 oz filet topped with crab, lobster, and lemon shallot butter. The meat was perfectly tender and the lobster and crab meat on top was so tasty! I didn't get any sense of the lemon shallot butter though. 

We decided to order the Grand Marnier Souffle for dessert. It was so light, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The sauce on the side was a nice touch of extra sweetness for the eggy flavor of the souffle that was here and there throughout parts of the souffle.

I ordered blackened Halibut with the fruit/mango topping. It was absolutely amazing and the kick of the blackened seasoning with the mango was fabulous. Various vegetables and appetizers were pretty basic, but tasty. Yummy shrooms! A little fresh creativity would be wonderful in the appetizers and ""sides"" departments, but that's just my preference, not the quality overall.

The only negative was the hostesses. They moved us from a small table right by the fish tank, to a booth, when we requested it..... Instead of the two open booths with a perfect view of the tank, our new table was tucked in the corner by the makeshift ""water station"" for the waitstaff with a huge pillar blocking our view of the tank. As a bonus, someone was coming or going constantly, and it killed any privacy or relaxation we got in between. 

It appears that it was not the designed intent of that little area....Management needs to step it up and relocate the water pitcher area elsewhere and  amend the dress code so it prohibits the hostesses from wearing outfits off clearance rack at Hot Topic. Chart House may be inside the Golden Nugget in old Vegas, but it doesn't have look like the hostesses are the offspring of their cocktail waitresses.

Lets mention the good first. The fish tank was beautiful and position of the restaurant in the Casino is excellent , close to a side entrance.  The service was good but average for this grade of restaurant.  Now the bad,  the entire restaurant is tiny and looks like an add on to what was a nice aquarium bar. Because of that, the seating is terrible, everyone is right on top of one another.  Some of the seating is right at the check out in the way of the entrance and exit of customer creeping by. The entrance is hard to find, really looks like you are going to the bar. Now the food, is C-, it would be an A if you were at McDonalds, but not for the prices they charge. The lamb chops were small and underccooked and not well seasoned.  My Chilian Sea Bass was good but small and not seasoned well. Sides were separate.  Worse yet I have often bragged of the excellent Caesar salad, hand made with anchovies at the Chart House. Well not at this one!. No anchovies, no hand made, no signature dish.

This trip was our wedding/honeymoon trip and we couldn't let it go by without a visit to this fine establishment.  The ambience is casual but elegant.  The service is impeccable.

We began our meal with the lobster bisque.  This was strongly recommended to us by a staff member of another GN restaurant and I am SO glad we tried it!  It is heaven!  We followed with the spinach salad.  This salad was so beautiful upon presentation that it was almost a shame to have our server toss it and for us to eat it.  However, we did and were not disappointed!  For my entrée I enjoyed the mixed seafood grill; grilled citrus salmon, shrimp scampi and a lump crab cake.  Delicious!  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the seared Mahi topped with lobster and jumbo lump crab. I tried a taste of the Mahi and it was great!  We ended the meal with one of their signature desserts, Hot Lava Chocolate Cake (another highly recommended item) and it was spectacular!

My Halibut La Griglia with champagne grape sauce was topped with a generous portion of lump crabmeat and came with a side of saffron risotto, grilled asparagus and roasted tomato.

We actually got married in the Golden Nugget and preceded the ceremony with our wedding party at the restaurant. It was very important in our minds to have a nice dinner after with all our friends and family. To start we had a party of 35, so their event planner said we had to choose a set menu. They sent us a few sample menus and were helpful in allowing us to customize the meat and poultry options. 

They do not have a banquet room but were able to comfortably seat us.

Right off the bat I knew we had chosen the right restaurant. When we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation it was as if they were waiting for us, and other than our reserved seat the restaurant was filled. The event planner quickly sat us and a team of waiters and waitresses immediately started taking drink orders and bringing bread. Hors d'oeuvres came next: Bruschietta sliders, fried asparagus, and jumbo shrimp cocktail. I highly recommend all three. Soup and salad was next: the finely chopped salad was a pleaser for all but the pickiest, but i was pleased, and it seemed that the clam chowder worked well for the kids. Entrees we next: I enjoyed the 12oz. prime rib and it was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered the fillet mignon and it was also very delicious. Our other choices were sea bass and range chicken and everyone that ordered them were pleased. 

For dessert we had the hotel make a wedding cake and The Chart House graciously facilitated us, we were able to cut and feed our cake to eachother right in the restaurant.

3517582,2010-12-29,2,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"Christmas day and my wife and I didn't want to make dinner. Our requirements for eating out: 1) no buffets and 2) it had to have a kid menu. After calling around and finding out that many ""good"" restaurants weren't kid-friendly we ended up making reservations at the Chart House, located in the Golden Nugget.

Walking into the lobby of the  hotel it was easy to spot the restaurant. Just look for the large aquarium behind the registration desk. The entrance to the Chart House is a small set of steps to the right of registration. There really isn't a hostess stand so if there's no one to greet you chances are you'll wander around the lounge trying to figure out where to check in. My first impression of the restaurant was that I thought it was going to be bigger. Sure, the aquarium looks cool, but I pictured something bigger with a much larger dining room surrounding it. The reality is that the room feels cramped and poorly laid out.

As far as the food, many of the seafood dishes were the weakest ones we tried. Isn't seafood supposed to be their specialty? 

//Appetizers//
- East meets west tuna: a duo of tuna tartare with a wasabi sauce and plantain chips and seared tuna with sliced avocado and cole slaw. It wasn't bad, but the slightly mushy texture made me think it wasn't the freshest fish around.
- Menage Soup: three small cups of gazpacho, lobster bisque and clam chowder. All were good with the lobster bisque being the best of the three.

//Entrees//
- New wave surf and turf: short ribs with a cabernet demi-glaze and seared scallops in a ginger soy sauce. The short ribs were fork tender and delicious but the three tiny scallops were gritty.
- Alaskan king crabs: 1.5 lbs of steamed crab legs. My wife didn't like the taste at all. I didn't think they were that bad, but the quality definitely seemed to be comparable to crab legs at a buffet.
- grilled chicken breast and fries. This was my kid's order. He was hoping for chicken tenders but had to settle for this, which turned out to be over cooked and dry. But he enjoyed the fries.

Our server was good. He was a slightly older guy who was friendly, very attentive, and even made all of us feel welcome even though we were the only ones with a kid in the restaurant.

I thought the place was a-ok. My wife, on the other hand, was extremely disappointed and couldn't wait to get out. Although her opinion may have been influenced by the fact that she used to work at a Chart House back east. I always liked the chain. They're not the fanciest places and don't have Michelin quality food, but for a chain you could do a lot worse.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,4,3,2EzUh1eI7rex8XgfmDQoPg

I'm glad I did - it's easily one of my new favorites in Las Vegas.  My friend ordered the chopped spinach salad  for $10 w/  bacon, egg, radishes, mushrooms, warm bacon dressing.  It looked delicious and she really enjoyed it.  I ordered the Chopped Salad for $8 w/ cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, radishes, hearts of palm, pepperoncinis in balsamic vinaigrette and the Wicked Tuna for $17 which came as ahi tacos, tartare & pepper seared.  It was a huge serving and was displayed well.  I was happy with it. 

Service was fairly decent but we did wait a long time to place ordered, get drinks, and get the final check.  We sat late in the evening and it was about 1.5 hours and none of us ordered anything of any particular length of cooking time - like steak - so it was a lengthy meal. 

But for the cost, the ambiance with the fish in the glass aquariums all around, freemont street, and healthy menu options - it's a big win for me.  I can see us coming back next time we're in town.",ZXOxl4oyBa4JTN3hPbnYyw,2,1,4,mLODscXyK7RC9TnnVkxidQ

3971599,2014-04-15,5,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"Chart House was never on my radar.  I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.

I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.  

My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.

For a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.

For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.

For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.

The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.

The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,6,4,QFATfBdYIJtjTY1xPEh_tA

4014511,2015-01-08,2,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"Went to the Chart House with the wifey a bit back to celebrate our 3rd year Anniversary!  Anyone who can be married to me for that long deserves a nice hunk of beef (her 2nd...if I'm considered her 1st...heh heh heh)!

Located in the Golden Nugget near the hotel registration.  Looks pretty unassuming on the outside because the restaurant is rather open-spaced and housed with a LARGE salt water fish tank, no real sign, only way to tell for sure is the menu stand posted near the steps!  Walk up the steps to find the host/hostess, you will notice that the front of the restaurant is all bar and lounge type seating.  The real restaurant is around the fish tank to the back.  Chart House, there you are!

For our Anniversary we were given a more intimate table for two in the corner directly facing the fish tank.  What a view!  Our reservation also came with personalized menus for the two of us, celebrating our Anniversary on top!  Nice touch.  

Our server was excellent, super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable on the Chart House menu!  She even knew we were celebrating our Anniversary!  After ordering some drinks and perusing the menu, our server led us to some great recommendations for dinner.

For a light appetizer we ordered the Hummus Trio - classic combination of traditional, roasted red pepper, and edamame (yes, edamame!) hummus all served with grilled pita and plantain chips.  Delightful!  Thankfully the hummus seemed to be fresh made (hopefully in-house) and was ripe with Mediterranean flavor.  Good quality olive oil, fresh beans.  The surprise was the edamame hummus, it was delicious.  Fresh, refreshing, light, it went great with the plantain chips.  I could eat a huge bowl of the stuff by myself.  I highly recommend.

For dinner the wifey and I went with what else?  Meat!  Chart House Prime Rib 10 oz. cut to be exact.  I asked our server if I should go with a bigger cut because you know, I'm a bigger dude, but she suggested that with the smaller cut the meat would be slightly more tender.  She was correct!  The 10 oz. cut of prime rib was no slouch, it was really a good size portion.  But the flavor was WOW!  Succulent, tender, salty, peppery, overall yummy piece of meat.  The extra au jus on the side was a nice addition as well.  I always (yes always) ask to my better judgment if there is a house steak sauce.  Yes, in a good steakhouse, this is sacrilege!  Our server, being gracious said they don't have a house steak sauce, but A1 if it's necessary.  But she did say to please trust them when they say the prime rib doesn't need any sauce.  Thankfully she was right.  Prime rib was juicy, oozing with fatty flavor!   Cooked perfectly for my liking.  A touch of horseradish, a smatter of au jus, and I was set.  Yummville, population - ME!  Our prime rib also came with a serving of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.  Buttery goodness!  Creamy!  Did I mention the extensive use of butter?

For an additional side we got the Asian Green Beans.  They were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have created at home.  Fresh green beans, stir fried with soy sauce, sugar, possibly some rice wine or mirin, topped with sesame seeds. 

Can't go to a fancy place like the Chart House and not try a dessert!  OK, if you're a diabetic I guess you can.  Wifey and I topped off the evening with their signature Hot Chocolate Lava Cake - chocolate cake with a molten center consisting of Godiva liquer.  Then it's topped with chocolate sauce, Heath bar, and vanilla ice cream.  Whoa!  Talk about punch to your gut!  Luckily I saved some room by getting the smaller prime rib cut.  This dessert was rich, rich, rich!  Chocolate everywhere.  Cake was warm, and the molten center was divine.  Heath bar added some great texture, and the the vanilla ice cream helped to cut through everything.  Piggy us, we finished it up!

Lovely evening celebrating our Anniversary, after dinner we lounged in our booth and took in the fish tank sights.  Just relaxed and relished the rest of our night.  We must have been there an extra 30 minutes, and our server was more than polite and told us not to rush at all.  Rather enjoyed that.

Chart House, overall no complaints.  Wait...bring in a house steak sauce!  Nah, just kidding.  Keep up the food and service, and I'll be back.  Save me some prime rib.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,1,4,KyA1NAoS2ECe92YLnswXRg

held up thier end of the bargin. I showed up with my 3 year old daughter early for our 6:30 reservation. They offered to seat us at our table or a nice lounge booth. We chose the booth quickly served us a Corona and Shirley Temple with Extra cherrys. My daughter thought the Corona was perfectly chilled:) We were seated in a timely manner when the rest of the party arrived. They had no issue with a partial order so we got app's in. Ordered the 2007 Willamette Valley Vinyards Pinot Noir. Waiter came back with 08 he didn't notice the difference. Once I brought it to his attention he offered a Cali Pinot that was slightly more expensive. I stuck with the 08 it was still  good pretty light but the second half of the bottle opened up and had a little better finish. Apps were great Spring Rolls, Avacado crab mango stack, and Prosciutto-Fontina- rocket -balsamic- sliders. They were all great but those Sliders were the Belle of the Ball.....Damn tasty!  Entrees were two Blue cheese filets, one Fish-n-Chips(I just had a craving), and one kids menu Co Co Shrimp. Steaks were cooked right with plenty of bleu and carmelized onions. Fish-n-Chips were a little disappointing not entirely crisp and the chips was a melange of fries, plantains, and other random stuff. The CoCo Shrimps were a big hit with The Bean.

Service: 4.5/5 Our waitress was fantastic from beginning to end.  She kept checking on us as the food kept coming for our party and handle our party of 10 easily.  She explained how we can surf and turf our dinner even though it wasn't listed on the menu as an option.  We were celebrating a birthday that evening and they personalized our menus with a Birthday greeting for the celebrant.  Great personal touch we loved

Food: 2/5 The brown bread in the bread basket is excellent, very tasty with butter.  The Iced Seafood Tower was very good.  All the items were fresh and I loved the Tuna Poke. That was my first time seeing poke in a seafood tower, good stuff. 
The lobster bisque was disappointing.  Very thin and not very tasty but the pieces of lobster in the bisque was plentiful but couldn't save the bisque overall.
My friends were clowning me for ordering a filet at restaurant known for their seafood but I had seafood the other day and figured it'd be fine. I ordered the 9 oz Filet Mignon (medium rare) topped with the Mushroom Truffle Butter and I was unfortunately disappointed.  The filet was bland and the truffle topping was too buttery.  
I split the Fried Mac & Cheese and while visually pleasing, the cheese utilized tasted something similar you could buy at a grocery store off the shelf.  My friend who shared this side with me agreed.
The key lime pie was a very big slice and was very good.  Highly recommended. 
I ended the night with a Baileys Coffee drink that wasn't tasty due to the quality of the coffee.  On a positive note, my friends who ordered the fish dishes were pleased.  I had another friend who ordered the prime rib medium rare and he mentioned it was tasty and cooked perfectly.  

Value: 2/5  Overall for me, it seemed like the ingredients used for the dishes were not of the quality I would expect from the prices charged for the dishes.  However, the presentation of the plates was visually pleasing in design and presentation.

Ambiance: 4.5/5 There's an amazing aquarium at the entrance with so many different types of cool fish to see.  The tables, seats and silverware were high quality and the table and booths were spaced perfectly.  

Summary: As a Vegas local, there are so many great food options in the city and from my first experience here they seem to be behind the curve in terms of what is offered for price and the quality of food received.  If I happen to visit again I'll most likely check out one of their seafood entrees or the awesome prime rib my friend had.

I've been to a lot of Chart House restaurants before, so when I saw this one at the Golden Nugget, I thought, heck, why not...And oooo let's sit at the bar cuz the fish tank is so freaking cool!

We ordered:
Calamari, app: fantastic. Crisp, delicious and this sweet chili dipping sauce was absolutely amazing. Little fried pieces of jalapeño and bell peppers complimented it perfectly.

Fried asparagus, app: delicious. It had this hollandaise with it that was awesome with it....whole fried but still tender spears of asparagus. Yummy!

Ménage soups: sampler of three soups. OMB (b for Buddha...I'm buddhist!)! definitely the highlight of the meal! Trio of lobster bisque, clam chowder and gazpacho. Bisque was rich and savory yet light....like a soufflé almost. The clam chowder had huge fresh chunks of clam and potatoes. And the gazpacho....wow. Fresh fresh fresh, delicious! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!

Spinach salad: beautiful presentation. But bland. Nothing special.

Seared scallops: overcooked, bland and unimpressive.

Filet mignon with blue cheese: delicious tender meat, topped with melted blue cheese and an oniony demiglaze ....absolutely delicious. But we ordered medium and got medium well. 

Bartender, Caroline, was very attentive even though she was super busy.   She even made a drink we wanted and was on it step by step! Some bartenders won't even make this drink...super chavelas!

The wait staff that aided her were lax, lazy, slow and had an air of rudeness to the bartender. I didn't appreciate that at all. Spoke to the manager, Michael, to that regard and he was an even bigger douche than the servers!

Great apps, soups and steaks....awesome bartender, breathtaking view of a huge fish tank...everything else was mediocre at best.

First off I want to say the staff is accommodating, knowledgeable, and professional.  Their know of both wine and food was on par with an establishment that is world class.  

Secondly I would like all to know is the food, especially the sea food, is what it is supposed to be.  Simple, the items spoke for themselves and were not masked with too much spices or marinades. 

The aquarium is impressive.  It is clean,  healthy looking fish and very active.  One thing that isa bit confusing is that there is a tv playing sports constantly hung on one of its walls.  

Lastly I will say the wine list was phenomenal and the staff knew the protocol on how to pitch, serve, and refill.  Staff was well educated and trained,  a rarity in this time and age.  

This is being critical but one must know a few things that don't make this a Five Star experience.

I will say the noise level is a bit too high for my liking.  Also,  there are no rest rooms located in the restaurant so one has to circumnavigate the casino floor for refreshing and relief.",Inbwd9sY-ZL26z8y9DPQ-Q,0,0,4,FsXbK0R4GDVL3mCkMlocvA

4338560,2016-05-14,5,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"The Chart House - Las Vegas

The 5 of us hadn't been together since the Costa Rica trip in 13.  Moonshine had a hankering for golf, cigars, gambling and hookers and he wanted his friends with him. With Moonshine, myself, Montana (he's Cuban...you'll figure it out eventually), Jericho and Sissy (named as such because of the larger then normal sissy bars he puts on all his motorcycles) in tow we all loaded up in Nova's van and headed west. Now I know what your thinking, Preach, why not fly?  Flights to Vegas are dirt cheap.  I hear ya but every since the NDE Montana experienced in the prop plane when flying into Key West he refuses to fly, thus the road trip.  Pussy.
 
Moonshine set us up at the Golden Nugget because according to him the ""payouts"" in downtown Vegas hotels were far more generous then those on the strip, as are the ladies. Personally I'd prefer the El Cortez but this was Moonshines trip. 

We arrived after 10pm, already behind schedule and pissed off because of the frequent stops as a result of way to alcohol consumed and Sissy's abnormally small bladder. Now before you launch into the evils of drinking and driving, all of the driving was done by Jericho and myself as we both drew the short straws. No laws of any consequence were broken during this road trip. At least while the vehicle was in motion. Fine, I lied. I may have had a Stroh's or two. 

After a stop at the Commonwealth and thanks to Jericho, time in the ""secret"" bar it was back to the Nugget and a visit to the Chart House.  

I never knew this place existed, probably because my normal diet when in Vegas consists mainly of  wings and Bloody Mary's from the Parlour, plus prices to eat at a place like the Chart House leaves me with a lot less for roulette and professional women. Chill, Nova's fine with sharing. As a professional woman herself she gets it. 

Dinner consist of coconut shrimp (this ain't Margaritaville for piss sake), lobster & shrimp spring rolls, stone crab claws and calamari for appetizers. The calamari was useless, tasteless and basically nothing more then breading and paled in comparison to the other appetizers. The stone crab was meaty and damn delicious. My dinner consisted of Lobster Bisque which could best be described as creamy liquid sin and Bronzed Swordfish. My fish was perfectly cooked and it came with a side of fried rice which I'm sure came from the closest Chinese buffet...yeah it was that exciting.  The actual highlight of my meal, and loved by all of us was the side of creamed spinach I ordered. God damn delicious. Throw in drinks and I lost count of the number of bottles of wine we killed and our bill exceeded 1K. Shine didn't bat an eye when presented with the bill...rich bastard. 

The Chart House is not my kind of place. Although the food was good and in some cases very good, in my mind it's the kind of place you take someone when you are trying to impress someone which I could give a shit about.  However, just because it's not for me doesn't mean shit and I've got to give it high marks  based upon the servers who were outstanding and very attentive, the food which was superb based upon the oohs and aahs of those with me, the atmosphere which is cool as fuck and the fact that it personally cost me nothing. Thanks Shine.

The HH menu is pretty good for a group of people to order off of, although not everything is really shareable. My group just asked the server which would be best to share and she obliged.

Hummus was great - three different styles (traditional, red pepper, and edamame), but I wish there had been more grilled pita. The addition of plantain chips for dipping was very nice!

Spinach & Artichoke Dip - Meh. Not very good, and a small portion (the dish is very shallow!). Plus there were just a lot of fillers on top of the dish, making it hard to get to what you actually want - the spinach and artichoke dip, of course! 

Lettuce Wraps - Comes with seared chicken, cucumbers, carrots and a soy sauce glaze. These were OK - but the lettuce was a bit wilted when it came out making these a bit less appetizing than they should have been. 

Chart House Sampler - This one is a weird one, and you'd think it would come with more than just a few items considering it is called a ""sampler"", but the portions were kind of meager and the lobster/shrimp spring roll (1) is not good for sharing. 

My group also imbibed on numerous drinks (I did not), but they looked delicious and were decently priced.

Bonus - make sure to sit in view of the fish tank and watch the colorful fish swim in the glass tube of emotion. (Ron Burgundy...)",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,1,3,LW1BNc8JaWn5g9X4dlLiHA

I chose this place because of its proximity to our show and because the girlfriend used to eat at the Portland location all the time. I guess it's tough to top a view of the Willamette, but the gargantuan aquarium that anchors the Vegas spot is a sweet feature. We were at the end of the tank and with the way the glass curved, watching the fish sometimes felt like a 3D movie.

We started our evening with a couple of cocktails. I had their version of a Bold Manhattan. The girlfriend had the Downtowner. The Manhattan was enjoyable but very sweet. I preferred the Downtowner (and indeed ordered my own).

As for food, we thought everything we ate was great. We shared the Roasted Beet Salad to begin our meal. The fact that they split it up onto two plates was a nice touch. Not quite as spectacular as we've had before, but excellent nonetheless. For the main course, I ordered the Bronzed Swordfish while the girlfriend chose the Tour de Shrimp. We accompanied that with their Asian Green Beans and Gorgonzola Risotto. Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned. No complaints whatsoever. And the plentiful leftovers were just as delicious the next day.

Ever since I saw Superman II as a kid, I always wanted to eat a soufflé but just never got around to it I guess. So it was a must that we tried their Chart House Soufflé. It was much too sweet for me, though the server did warn us about that. Luckily, the Grand Marnier Crème Anglaise complemented it perfectly. You're supposed to choose a sauce, but the server allowed us to have all three on the side. The raspberry had a nice tartness to it that also helped break up the sweetness of the soufflé.

A note on parking: It seems like you now need to stay at the hotel or dine at one of their restaurants in order to get validated.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,4,3,4,e-ThogvoKzsSv11kglcW-A

I was taken  here for the seafood and the amazing fish tank.  The fishes were lovely.. ranged from Nemo, unicorn looking, zebra looking, and cute looking fish.  My companion was lovely company.  Service was impeccable and waitress was lovely.  She even gave us a free dessert.

This is what we tried:
- Cold platter:  Amazing.. we asked if we could get it for one person and we were able to get one lobster tail, one crab leg, two oysters, and two jumbo shrimp.  Fresh and delicious.
- Lobster bisque:  probably the best I have had in a while.. very good and lobster meat inside!
- Swordfish.. delicious and flaky
- Fried platter.. probably not as good but my fault.  Best part was the lobster tail.  Fish wasn't that great.. 
- Calamari wasn't that great with the kimchi sauce.. wish they had marinara.
- Drinks.. I liked the pomegranate martini but I wasn't that wowed by it.  Went back to the Manhattan.

Would definitely visit again.. very romantic and great date place.",z_9oeZ5aN8g8AzPNENht8w,4,1,4,4sFsND7D0ea0dE_8UOJXkg

My husband and I visited the Chart House last year for our anniversary and had a delicious meal.  We were talking about it all year.  We naturally made a reservation for this year.  My husband made a note in the reservation that it was our anniversary.  We were treated by the hostess and promptly seated at a table for two right next to the fish tank.  Amazing view.  Edward was our waiter and incredible helpful and personable.  We had the poke as an appetizer and it was so beautifully played, I had to take a picture.  This was my first experience with poke and I will certainly have it again!  It filled all the flavor and textures I could want.  For dinner my hubby ordered the Tour de Shrimp and it consisted of coconut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, and shrimp with a chimichurri sauce.  He ate every bite!  I had the sea bass.  It was so perfectly cooked!  Fresh and flavorful.  During our meal the executive chef came by to see if everything was to our liking and it certainly was!  Then the manager came by with an anniversary card signed by our entire waitstaff!!!!  I couldn't believe it!  THEN, Edward presented us with menus that were made just for us and it said Happy 5th anniversary!!!!  I was blown away.  The topper to the whole night was when Edward came back and gave us a complimentary dessert of a peanut butter pie with a cookie crust.

She was awkward. Dinner was awkward. Aside from the weird vibe the food was truly not good. The seasonal salad contained figs that were not ripe and hardly a blue cheese chunk to be found. The salad was heavy on the prosciutto but so heavy it felt greasy. Sadly the salad was still the best part of the dinner. The oysters were pricey ($17 for 6) and definitely not my favorite. I did not finish them (thankfully but I will get to that later). I had my suspicions so I opted for something that seemed difficult to mess up for my entree. Wrong. I had the Mac nut crusted mahi. It was so over cooked it chewed like chicken. The vegetables were tough and the asparagus looked old. Let's just say after spending over $200 on dinner we weren't happy. Icing on the cake was two hours later I began vomiting from food poisoning. Still in bed as I write this review.!,DJ-PUdZlRL706r7lPVAwdA,0,0,1,N5cK0l6kx8Yslz4pHsqBrg

The Chart House in Las Vegas, at the Golden Nugget is one of my favorites!  The 75,000 gallon aquarium is the center piece of this restaurant and there is not a bad seat in the house for viewing it!  You can even ask the server for a fish identification chart if you are so inclined to learn what types of fish are swimming around in it.    It is absolutely amazing!

The food too is great.  The shrimp cocktail is firm and fresh, served with a great cocktail sauce.  The ""Calamari and Friends"" was delicious!  I highly recommend.  It was lightly fried and very fresh. The ""friends"" included lightly fried veggies -- carrots, peppers, and sweet potatoes.  

The Chopped Spinach Salad with warm bacon dressing, chopped egg, bacon, radishes & mushrooms wash beautifully presented and then chopped by our server.  The dressing was just enough and not overwhelming like can often be with this type of salad.

Since I am not a seafood lover, I got the 12 oz. prime rib and it was melt in your mouth!  The baked potato that I ordered as a side was also perfectly done.

My partner had the Stuffed Flounder filled with jumbo lump crab drizzled with lemon butter and served with Yukon golden mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The stuffing was good but the fish lacked some flavor and was rather bland.  

The prices are right in line with this type of high end restaurant with main dishes costing between $25 and $40.  Dress is business casual to casual (it is Vegas after all).",8_v8Y9Wdh6BH7I79TVQgSg,6,1,5,-sGKhZdj9fsg3-D8u_tEeA

I guess some people like that but i felt rushed. They did print my name on the menu which was nice and I appreciated and they wrapped it up at the end and provided to me.

We ended up having to leave and I spent the rest of the night in bed so freaking sick. I emailed Chart House on their website to let them know that I had been sick and was 100% positive it was from the food as I had felt great before I ate and had nothing after I ate. No response from the site. Overall, I was highly disappointed that they would not even respond. Who knows if other people got sick as well as Im sure the restaraunt was not even notified by the website and I was too sick to call them.

The last of the reviews for this week in Vegas . . . the Chart House . . . Seafood or Meat . . . No choice to be made here  . . . This is a MEAT week.

Ribeye for me, but more on that later.  I sat at the bar waiting for my business associate to arrive.  Contemplated having my choices in cocktails, which for me centers on bourbon or cachaça . . . Leblon or Bookers.  No choice . . . cachaça distilled by a Frenchman aged in American oak by a company that had no sales presence in Brasil prior to the Cabana cachaça beating . . . ask if you want the detail . . . or Bookers uncut Kentucky Straight Bourbon.  I am an American in the larger sense . . . I try to drink spirits from here . . . tonight is bourbon time.  

Side note . . . Some one please import good aged cachaça to the USA.  Sagatiba has their velha but it is not in the same league as Armazem Veiera Onyx for example.  

Two sips and off to the table.  I order my typical steakhouse meal - beefsteak tomato salad, ribeye steak (love the fat of the cut) and sauteed mushrooms.  The slices of the beefsteaks were too thin, but the chef gives the salad a twist . . . instead of raw onion he supplements it with an onion ring on each, sadly thin, beefsteak slice.  HE SHOTS, HE SCORES.  Nice twist.  The steak is really good, but not up to the same level as the other ribeye of the week.  Shared bottle of merlot with my associate . . . I prefer wines with more balls . . . a Malbec or a Zinfindel perhaps.  But I did not order the wine . . . so who am I to complain . . . wait I just did . . . What a jerk.  Finish the meal with a cup of coffee, yeah those of you that know me are not surprised.  

On the walk back to my room, there is that fish tank by the pool . . . Those redfish look like groupers . . . forget the restaurant tank I want to fish this tank from above from the bar. 

In the end, would I return?  HELL YES . . . Chart House is a chain but there is innovation and dependable meat and seafood . . . high quality and excellent relaxed service . . . if only they had some cachaça velha.",EjcQTxZ2TI6Ky7lOGlw8ig,4,2,4,_E-3Mxrps-t016c4aGZpCw

Reality: Snobbish employees, sloooow service and poor customer relations!  Party of five, drinks were ordered and came in a reasonable time.  Ordered appetizers and waited and waited and waited, four clam chowders and one lobster bisque took over 30 minutes to serve.  During this time, no one checked on us or let us know what the delay could possibly be.  More waiting for charcuterie & cheese plate and spring rolls, finally the server comes back and says your plates will be out in just a few minutes. We tell her never mind and speak to the manager, she comps the four clam chowders but the damage is done. Not once during this marathon did the server or anyone check to see if we wanted more drinks or to let us know they realized we were still there.

There are very limited selections for entrées and they were all pretty boring, with the best one being the fish of the day. Therefore, my friend and I decided to order two appetizers: the lobster and shrimp spring rolls and we also ordered the hummus platter, which comes with three types of hummus: avocado, mildly spicy red pepper, and olive, along with plantain chips and some pita. Just ok...
I then ordered the farmers market salad which was good. My friend ordered the new England clam chowder which was also good. We had water. Overall, the food was OK but nothing to write home about or want to try again.

I've been here for lunch a couple times and also late night munchies, service is always quick and on point. The food and drinks are consistently good as well. We always leave here full and satisfied. And sometimes sorta kinda drunk. Thanks Vegas. 

SHORTS RIBS ($19):
http://bit.ly/2i0RwX7
This is by far the best braised short ribs I've had to date. 
This massive piece of boneless short rib was so juicy and fork tender. The rich velverty cabernet demi-glace was also quite delicious. The garlicky yukon gold mashed potatoes was velvety and smooth that I finished the whole thing (and I'm not a mashed potato fan at all, so that says a lot). Tis dish is a must-order. 

SEAFOOD SALAD TRIO ($20):
This was my half-ass lazy attempt at trying to be healthy while pigging out in Vegas....it had the word ""salad"" in it, so it counts. Yep...that's a fried tortilla on the side, lol! 
http://bit.ly/2hEyOUc
- The ""shrimp napoleon"" was basically 2 cocktail-styled jumbo shrimps butterflied and laid criss-cross over each other. Perfectly cooked shrimp, nothing fancy. 
- 2 slices of pepper seared tuna
- A spoonful of jumbo lump crab meat
The rest of the plate consisted of a couple pieces each of tomatoes, hearts of palm, prosciutto crisps and a scoop of avocado-kimchee slaw with ranch dressing. 

The bf and I split this deconstructed salad as an appetizer. 
It didn't look or sound like a lot of seafood, but it was definitely filling and something I wouldn't mind ordering again. 

FISH TACOS (2 tacos for $12.50): Fish of the day was mahi mahi. 
The bf fully enjoyed his plate of tacos. The cajun-spiced mahi was juicy and tender. The jack cheese, fresh cabbage, pico de gallo and ranch dressing was the perfect accompaniment to this filling plate of food. 

Our server that day was a hella fun guy name Randy. He was so bubbly and friendly, love him! He was so engaging and even offered suggestions of which museums to check out because it was my bf's first time in Vegas.Hopefully we get to see him again the time we visit because we'll definitely be back!",lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg,35,31,4,nylsPUz-QVpdM4k0qPXWeA

First, we arrived fairly early for dinner so it was nowhere near packed inside, but we were seated at the worst table in the house. A corner seat next to the kitchen with way too much in/out traffic to ensure a relaxing meal. We moved to a much nicer inside table closer to the fish tank. 

Our server was a nice guy with a  sense of humor who seemed happy to be serving us but would've been happier if we'd ordered cocktails.

But then the food arrived...

Pop had Seared Scallops with green beans, delicious and perfect in every way.

Mom had a combo plate with Salmon and shrimp scampi served with a side of mashed potatoes and a crab cake (loaded with crab and hardly, if any, bread crumbs). The sides were cold to the touch and sent back.

Wife had the CH Special with calamari, tempura lobster and fish&chips. She didn't want fries so she ordered the green beans instead. The only items served hot were the lobster and the fish. Unfortunately, the fish were two tiny ""fish sticks"" like you'd get from a Gorton's box. If you choose this combo you'll see ""fries and more"" listed. The ""more"" is a delcious melange of fried jalapeno and bell peppers and carrots. We had the green beans and calamari served again but fresh out of the fryer the 2nd time.

I had the clam chowder, which was fan-freaking-tastic with tons of clams and very little potato. Would've liked it even more if it had been served piping hot. Also had the shrimp with garlic pasta, which should have been better than it was. I ate the shrimp and left the tasteless carb pile of pasta.

This dinner for four was $160.00 with no drinks or cocktails. At these prices we should NOT have had to return anything to the kitchen and nothing was comp'd.",9Vxz43AbSkFnn_NZ_lqloA,0,0,3,DkEGts5R5NXp66nt0oiYcw

From our comfortable, contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled about before our eyes in a large and tall tube-type aquarium while we dined.  The place was sleek and modern, beginning with two 6-foot hostesses in black miniskirts, appearing much like human bookends, who confirmed our reservation and gave us a friendly greeting when we arrived.  The aqua floor upon entry looked like water, which added to the sea mystique.

Our first dish was dramatic, with a nice presentation of true meaty jumbo shrimp that were shooting off steam from dry ice.  A complimentary bread basket was small, but it was ample for 2 diners, and contained good brown and white bread, as well as tasty rolls.  New England Clam Chowder was good but unusually crunchy from celery, while Diane dealt with a Lobster Bisque that was rather heavy on the brandy.  Sauteed Mushrooms were juicy, and this side was very large and lasted all the way to dessert, but the sauce on the sizzling skillet was not that tasty.  However, a lovely chopped Spinach Salad with egg, mushrooms, and red onion was.  What I particularly liked about this dish is that the various parts were presented in side by side fields of color: a column of yellow egg placed next to a column of green lettuce, and so forth.  Then it was left up to the diner to toss all ingredients and the fine dressing together as desired, which I found to be fun rather than an annoyance.

I then enjoyed a good pan-fried pink Salmon enhanced by a blanket of crisp prosciutto, while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder.  I know, because I tried it too!  But, the Flounder that was originally brought to the table had to be sent back, because the first batch was too spicy for my spouse's delicate palate.  I appreciated that the request for a less spicy breaded Flounder was cheerfully accommodated, and although it took awhile for a new entree to be cooked, the manager personally brought out the replacement, and it was made just as requested.  We also shared a side of great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and I had fine Green Beans presented on my plate.

Our dessert of a Chocolate Souffle that had properly risen was good but not what we expected to receive.  It was real airy--more like a tasty meringue than a sumptuous souffle.

Service was impeccable!  It was attentive, and there was not one service error by our very competent female server.  In fact, the worst thing that occurred happened days after the meal when all photos of the food but one were lost in a failed effort to store them in a backup drive.  Hence, the single photo that appears with this review.  But at least that photo was taken just after a slew of dishes had been placed on the table.  This was the first and only time my photos for a Yelp review were totally lost before they were loaded on the restaurant's site.  May it be the last!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,6,4,r-2WXUq4nFddvT5PsPKxQw

We even went with a large group and they didn't appreciate the business, believe me!! The manager didn't even care how you felt.  He made up an excuse for not having a white tablecloth because it was a nice wood table. Bullshit! The table looked like a leftover from the Bingo hall!  We didn't even get to enjoy any bread, water or dessert!!  Poor poor service!! Not worth the time or place to eat!! Check out Vic n Anthony's - now that is 10 ***** well worth the time and money!  Some say Charthouse is discriminatory so beware...!!! Wouldn't send my worst enemy there!!",MnKem6zgtJy0gQnssJXrkQ,0,0,1,7rgpoO-sYsPUSEDdqlG6lg

We got there a little late, about half hour before they closed. We were very hungry and wanted a nice meal. The hostess said it was fine and sat us across from the beautiful fish tank.

Harris came up introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. He also made polite conversation with us as he gave us the specials. Excellent suggestions, we had a couple appetizers and two entrees. BTW try the mango mojito!!! 

Long story short, Food was great! Service was excellent! Atmosphere was wonderful!",f0aNEvgw86uYj0YF6ZQNiA,0,0,5,nnUr70nf90zpl0p0uB4OuA

I started with the soup sampler and while the clam chowder was good, the gazpacho and lobster bisque were underwhelming. After waiting around 40 minutes for the pan seared scallops entree, I questioned the bartender and he admitted he forgot to tell the kitchen. It appeared 10 minutes later and seemed fresh, but the scallops were slightly undercooked and not browned enough for me. 

Overall, a decent dish for the price paid, but not memorable. Possibly the fresh fish options are better than some dishes from the standard menu

I'll come back to try again soon, and also to enjoy the fantastic view of that fish tank",uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,0,0,3,P5IeQwhBuamHM1YqxFsWGw

Located inside the Golden Nugget but has a gorgeous fish tank right in the center...Food is nice!  I got the fish and chips and Gwen got the coconut shrimp...Really good with shoe string fries...You can also get a soup or side salad but I passed on that...I would definitely return to eat at this place next time I'm in town...,43JU_n9LO7sr8N-8hNcs3A,0,0,3,nHJRqrC89Kzvt3pu4f1Lsg

This made our night just that much more special. All our food and cocktails and dessert came out in a timely manner and Paul was very personal with us. I would recommend the calamari which is tossed in a kimchee sauce it's why we decided to go out I had been craving it for months now. We also ordered the prime rib and my wife got her seafood dish. We ended the night with the chocolate lava cake which was good, we  also tried their house made peanut butter ice cream which by its self was good too rich for the lava cake though. We will defiantly be back and I would definitely recommend this place for all celebrating occasions.",ElEr37Nl6NLuo0My3F33Eg,1,0,5,5AHfxmQsJzNmO382qjVavA

5958301,2014-07-18,1,WCFz9KVJTtIXSVvD5NMYoQ,"Eating fish, while watching fish swim by? Sure, why not!

We started with the crab, mango & avocado stack. It was ridic. Very good. Just watch out for those hidden jalapeños! I had the seared chilean sea bass that was stuffed with crab & lobster, because duh. The orzo that came with it was delicious, and the fish was so good. It definitely had 30 pounds of butter on it, but hey, I'm on vacation! My date/cousin had the macadamia crusted mahi, and damn it was good too. 

There were so many things on the menu I wanted to eat, but neither my stomach nor my pocketbook are big enough to fit them all in. 

The prices are definitely a little steep, but we were wanting to treat ourselves, so when in Rome (or, well, the Golden Nugget)!

Watch out for that giant green eel. He was eyeing my dish.",PlXQJMhZzXwAoNnp99YDUg,2,1,4,fq0HKAmkGplczjuLmdjReg
