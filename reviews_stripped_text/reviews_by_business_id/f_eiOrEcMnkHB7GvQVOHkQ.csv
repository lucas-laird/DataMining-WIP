The name Terrance Pointe Cafe had me thinking I would be dining at a casual ""blah"" cafe, Nope this is 5 star quality food & service. They are very generous with the food portions & price is very reasonable. The food was excellent but our server was the best. Sytuan (Sy) is the best server around. He made our dining experience so much fun. Our busboy named Francisco (Pancho) was on top of it all. We never had to ask for refills. They were both so attentive. We had the bottomless mimosas & they kept them coming. It was so good we came back the next day for brunch again.

This was the only disappointment!  What a shame because it has so much potential and there is no excuse for such a mediocre execution at such an establishment.  I had the alfredo with shrimp and it resembled and tasted like a tv dinner!  I could have had better at The Olive Garden!  It was smothered with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and was just bad-period.  My bf had the Philly cheesesteak and that too was a disaster.  How can you mess up a hot sandwich?

The raspberry french toast was the perfect ending/beginning to the morning. A very generous helping of stacked french toast, and the raspberry was complementary rather than overwhelming. A perfect balance between sweet and sour.

Nice flavor, moist chicken, good shredded greens and carrots and overall a very delicious salad. My friends chicken quesadilla was amazing. It wasn't your regular flat boring quesadilla.

I got the mushroom/swiss burger with shoestring fries. The burger was bigger than my head. And it was topped with an cherry tomato and olive! But most importantly, it was juicy and tasty. Medium rare. Our table also ordered a burger but medium, and it turned out a bit too dry. So stick with medium rare. Two of my friends could not resist ordering the lobster benedict.

But I HAVE come here several times for lunch and dinner... and the food is GREAT. I've been hooked on one dish and one dish alone almost since I've started eating here. That dish is the Chinese Chicken Salad... the most AMAZING salad I have ever had. The sauce is fantastic and the ingredients to the salad are a perfect mix... water chestnuts, mandarian oranges, lettuce, sprouts... mmmmm.... and the sauce. OMG, I consider myself to be a proud meat eater... but DAMN this place has SUCH an amazing salad that the chicken is almost secondary. Altho it's certainly not bad. It's a big dish too so you can fill yourself up and hope that some of that alcohol swirling around gets absorbed before y'all binge again!

Vegan Happy Meal: Cheezeburger, fries, and a chocolate shake.

Vegan Chicken & Waffles- Sweet, salty, and filling.

Vegan French Toast- Thick bread, comes with strawberries. Very filling.

In all, we had the French toast, huevos rancheros, some kind of omelette with avocados and salsa (the name escapes me). The French toast is amazing. Get it covered in granola. It is sweet, fluffy, and textured all at the same time. We couldn't get enough of it, and normally I'm done with French toast after a pitiful half-slice. The huevos rancheros were very savory and had many different flavors and textures.

My bf and I had lunch here near a window, and although it was a chilly January day, we had the chance to look out onto the beautiful patio and pool.

The seats at the table had crumbs and hair (bleh!) all over them so we couldn't sit down and had to wait for the hostess to clean it up. 

After we sat down, absolutely no one came to our table until 12:15 when we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered water for the table and one club soda. She then tells us that our waiter will be right with us to take our order. 12:30 rolls around and still no waiter, but we finally received our drinks! Amazing! BUT no club soda. Had to wait another 10 minutes for it. 12:35 and low and behold we have a waiter!! I've worked in the restaurant business before and you are supposed to greet your customers no longer than a minute after being seated. I think we were very patient (though we thought about getting up to leave) despite the fact that we had to get out of there by 1:30 to catch a flight. We finally placed our order and didn't receive our food till 1:00! How ridiculous! The place wasn't even crowded and I do not know what our waiter was doing. I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but I don't think waiting tables should be on his resume. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE! 

I spoke to the manager after we finished eating (in a rush) and she agreed that you should be greeted within 1 minute of sitting down and apologized. She then proceeded to tell me that there was a delay because of the food allergy at our table and they wanted to be extra cautious. I again told her that that wasn't the issue because we couldn't even get someone to take our order for the longest time! Plus the 3 other tables around us had to wait 20-30 minutes for their food after ordering too and I know they didn't have food allergies at their table. Excuses...

She took off one of our entrees and the drinks (the one club soda) from our bill. I don't think it was worth the time or the money. For the price and time spent, we could have and should have just went across the hall to The Buffet. I expected way more from Wynn.

Even though it was noon, we were attended to and seated quickly. The view is hard to beat...you can see the pool from just about every seat. The Wynn does have some of the best visual stimulation around...the waterfalls, the pool, the decor, and the environment is just great.

The burger and sandwich quality was excellent. The burgers are HUGE and flavorful. I had a southwest Angus burger with avocado and my friend had their BLT. You'll have to be hungry to eat the whole burger or sandwich...honestly. The hamburger buns are fresh made in house...they tell you but you can also tell with your first bite.

Their fries...eh...ok...disapointing to be totally honest. The basic fries are just that. and their steak fries, which I had, were over-seasoned beyond what I could handle. Hopefully just a mistake but it's just fries...they were pretty bad.

The milkshakes are what make the Terrace Point worth a trip. They serve triple thick shakes and they are worth every penny at $7 each. With 6+ flavors to choose from, I had their Vanilla and it was anything but your run-of-the-mill shake. Whip cream was fresh made, cherries were some of the best ever, and the shake size was ideal. I usually feel weighed down by shakes but not here.

Here's what we got...

Vanilla Milkshakes - $7 ea
BLT - $12
Fries - $4
Southwest Burger - $17
Steak Fries - $4

Spend-o-meter: 55 for lunch...way up there IMHO for a cafe...worse considering the disappointing fries...
Service: very good
Value: eh...better places within a quick walk...Ceasars, the Venitian, and the Palazzo have much better cafe's and taqueria's for the same $$$.
Will I go back? If I do, it will be for the shakes.

Sat outside next to the busing tray. The birds knew just what to wait for. My husband asked if they could clear it away since the birds were buzzing his head to get to the leftover food, he was told sure. After another 10 minutes and watching the birds fly over and land on fresh water and the pitcher to refill glasses with so called fresh water I got up and went inside and spoke to the hostess. She said she would find someone (heard that before) and pointed me in the direction of the manager....which happened to be the person my husband spoke to. The manager covered up the food with napkins and more food proceeded to be put on top. FINALLY someone removed it and the whole dance started again. Wynn is suppose to be first class, not this restaurant, reminds me of seagulls attacking you at McDonalds on the boardwalk for fries. Someone needs to put a covered busing holder out there or get the staff to bus to the inside. I'm sure they can design a bird proof dirty dish cart or closet but looks like Wynn doesn't care. I've even been to outdoor dives that have better trash cans that deter birds. For a $100 breakfast for 3 I think they should be able to do better.

But, we decided to try it anyway and sit outside next to the pool (close to the pool) since it was a nice day out. First off, the line was ridiculous, I'd say over 15 minutes, when clearly there were empty tables all around the restaurant. Grand Lux- 0-1 minute wait. We sat outside and the patio was a nice setting. However, the umbrellas which provided the shade had a lot of bird poop and although we wouldn't have minded the cute small birds, there were these hideous pigeons that were also flying around. But the main thing was the smoking. Apparently there was this couple sitting at an adjacent table smoking next to us. We had three small children. We asked if we could move. The hostess informed us that the entire outdoor patio allowed for smoking and if we didn't want to be around smokers that they could find us a table indoors. I was disappointed to know that they didn't even have a smoking section and a non-smoking section for the outdoor patio, which apparently they need because some people in the world have no regard, respect, or consideration, even for kids. If you want to kill yourself, don't kill other people while doing it. Smoking is a sick disease and smokers are addicts and are just compelled to behave in such a destructive way, its pathetic. Why would someone want to smoke a cig for breakfast is beyond me. You'd figure people at a high class place like the Wynn would be different. Guess not. This one is on Wynn for making the rules. Apparently rules are made for those who just don't know better. Since there are no rules here, we won't be returning. The service was good and the food was ok. Its not that hard to mess up scrambled eggs and toast or even chicken and waffles. Not gonna jeopardize my health or my kids because of some idiots and especially because a top hotel doesn't have rules to control their patron's behavior.

A lot of the options are similar across restaurants, and I ended up going to Terrace Pointe Cafe because it had the option I wanted and had a cute, casual atmosphere.

The food option I wanted: The Wynn ""Burger"" with Cheese. It's described as a gardein burger patty, American cheese (vegan, of course), ketcup, mustard, pickles, onion, thin cut fries, and a chocolate shake. Yes, it comes with the shake! That's honestly the main reason I wanted it...I'd been craving sweet things and there aren't many sweet things for vegans in Vegas. 

Anyway, I got my burger w/o ketchup, mustard, pickles, or onions because I'm lame like that; I asked for lettuce instead and they accommodated.

The food tasted good! I liked everything a lot except the bun was a bit lackluster - I think they could improve the bun a lot. The fries were amazing, though, so I think that makes up for it. The chocolate shake was good - it was made with almond milk in place of regular milk, I believe.

The menu says ""Vegetarian Menu"", but the waitress assured me that everything there is vegan.

Part of the reason I chose the food option I did was because of the price: $11 for a burger, fries, and a shake! I could see $11 w/o a shake being normal, and was impressed that the shake was included.

We got seated around 11:30 and they didn't have any brunch or breakfast menus available anymore. Some places serve breakfast until 3pm. It's either we missed their cut or they just didn't gave us the breakfast/brunch menu.

We ordered the Hawaiian Ahi Poke for appetizer and Chipotle Mahi Sandwich for two people to share.

*Hawaiian Ahi Poke - It was fresh and pretty good and I liked how they used rice crackers (kinda same texture as prawn crackers) instead of chips. It was mildly spicy, which I like because it had a nice kick to it. I also enjoyed the seaweed salad on top of it and they were pretty generous with the avocado.

* Chipotle Mahi Sandwich - The sandwich was meh, ok. It was actually more on the dry side and it was feat finishing my half of the sandwich. We opted for a side of fruits with our sandwich instead of fries or a side salad. That was a good idea since it was nice palette cleanser and it kinda served as a dessert.

Whether you're there during the summer or the winter, Terrance Pointe's got somethin' for you. It's a special little tucked away treat that you can only get in Vegas. 

First off, the ambiance here is amazing. It's tucked in a less-traveled corner of the Wynn, so it's not your typical eatery. The couches... the couches. So good after you've been in heels for 4+ hours and slept about the same. You can kick off your flip-flops and just relax.

The service is also beyond expected. The staff knows their stuff, they engage with you and make you feel welcome. They also make amazing recommendations. 

The food and drinks are why we keep coming back, though. Americano fan? GET ON IT. Plain ol' drip coffee connoisseur? Also an excellent choice. In the summer, opt for something lighter like the granola-yogurt-fruit plate. They won't serve you melon; they've got berries and mango for you. The French toast plate -- while not the leanest option -- is well worth it, with ham, cheese, hash browns and eggs to boot. We ordered the eggs over medium and they were served exactly over medium. In the winter, you absolutely must do the tomato soup with grilled cheese. MUST. It'll warm your soul and you'll learn the true meaning of that phrase.

It was a warm day in Vegas, but that wasn't a problem. The umbrellas have misters built in, so on those especially hot days, you can stay cool (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tANhxxLlzOrvzdXnO1c4cw&userid=7lsk7VJ4OvaTxtdcNeSjZg)

We loved watching them drink from the mist sprayers and hop around snootily choosing which gourmet crumbs they like and which aren't to their liking.  
I guess the one downside of sitting on the terrace was being in the quiet company of so many buttoned-up types.

The waiter took our order and delivered the coffee and juice quickly. 

We enjoyed watching the people in the pool (people are so weird) while waiting for our food which came out piping hot and beautifully displayed. My veggie omelet was delightful, the 'square' of hash browns crispy / tender and the rye toast was very fresh and delicious. The chicken and waffles were a big hit. Bacon bits in the waffle with white meat chicken tenders topped with a fried egg. My niece ordered the spicy syrup and it was the perfect hot / sweet combination. The waffles were airy and crisp, the crust on the chicken was fried to golden perfection. I never thought I would like this combination but was I proven wrong. Hot damn, all of the flavors combine together for a sinfully wonderful treat.

I got the corn beef hash with my eggs scrambled and my beef hash was a little on the salty side. I had to eat my hash with the eggs so it wouldn't taste as salty. I also got the caramel latte which was pretty good and they gave us this little sugar stick for me to mix it with in my latte.

Now, the service.... Horrible horrible horrible! Keep in mind, the restaurant was not even a full house, not a lot of people were in the restaurant when we were there eating but our food took FOREVER to come out. We had 8 people at our table but still, any other restaurant can bring our foods out faster especially when our food can easily be made. My latte was the only one that came out super late while everyone else got their coffee. Usually I like to drink my latte before I eat that way I can just chill, talk to my girlfriends, and drink my latte. Instead, my friend had to flag down the waitress and tell her I waited 25 minutes for my latte and she gave me a bullshit excuse saying there must be a line cause there's only one machine. Right.... No body is here girl. Also, the waiters got most of our orders mixed up and not the way we wanted our food to be cooked. For example, my friends wanted scrambled eggs instead they got over easy.

We came here for breakfast, although I was told that this restaurant serves breakfast upon request all day. 

Our server was extremely nice and we had everything we needed throughout our dining experience. We had a lovely view of the pool and enjoyed a breezy, sunny breakfast outside on the terrace. 

We each got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. For a small juice glass, it is $7 each which I find absurd but when in Vegas...

I got huevos rancheros. The sauces served with the dish were both extremely flavorful and I really enjoyed them...especially the avocado cream sauce. They were much needed because the actual dish needed a bit more seasoning even if only salt and pepper. I am a person that rarely even cooks with salt and pepper and I NEVER add it at a restaurant so for me to add salt, it's saying a lot! My Mom got the Belgian waffle served with berries and she thoroughly enjoyed that dish as well. 

They have an extensive vegetarian menu which is nice to see because most places have so few choices for vegetarians. Upon ordering, they also ask if you have any food allergies. 

I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast. The lunch menu looks delicious as well but we didn't have a chance to return for lunch during our stay.

The prices for alcohol aren't cheap either. $12 for a michelada and $21 for a bottomless mimosa. Last I checked, this was just a cafe! I guess you're paying for the presentation and for the atmosphere, but dangg. For what I paid, I might as well have just gone to the buffet!

Bottom line, go for the lovely outside seating and the relaxing environment. It's perfect after a night out and the food isn't bad.

With entrees in the $10-25 range, it's a welcome alternative to higher priced dining options but still manages to keep some of the upscale charm that you'd expect from the Wynn brand.

You'll be given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating upon arrival. The outdoor seating overlooks the beautifully laid out Wynn pools. There's a lengthier wait time for outdoor seating, but you'll enjoy the laid back vibe of the pool scene. You'll take advantage of the shade of the patio umbrellas -- so as to not toast yourself under the bright Vegas sun -- while sipping on a mid-day pitcher of sangria.

The, usually immediate, indoor seating isn't a total wash, you'll still be able to most likely enjoy the pool scene through the floor to ceiling windows; that is, if you're able to successfully fight off the rest of your party to grab the pool-facing seats.

As you'd expect, the service is top-notch. When a nearby diner asked their server if they knew if there was going to be a UFC fight that particular weekend, she quickly excused herself and informed the hostess of the inquiry. The hostess walked over to their table two minutes later and was able to confirm the details of the match up that weekend, which she gathered from a quick call to the concierge desk.

The lettuce wraps were fairly standard, and tasted similarly to the ones at PF Changs. 

My friend got the steak and eggs, and the steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. 

The service was only so so, which isn't normal for somewhere in the Wynn. It took a really long time to get out food, and just as long to get a check when we were done.

I was fortunate enough to stay at the Wynn for a conference, but didn't want to blow my $50-a-day per diem on some ridiculously chichi celebrity chef restaurant. Luckily, I found the Terrace Pointe my first night there.

It was late and I didn't want a whole meal so I ordered the potato chips. Yes, potato chips. But these are Wynn-style chips. Meaning, home made, covered with truffle oil and blue cheese. So wrong, and yet so right!

Some friends joined me the next night and I found myself craving those damn chips and talking them into going there for dinner (truly, if you're staying at the Wynn, why go anywhere outside of it?!). We split the chips and everyone else found them just as heavenly. I and two others in our party went for the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Yes, grilled cheese and tomato soup.

My friends and I had the LEO, brioche French toast, and eggs benedict. They were all very tasty, especially the French toast. Yes, while it was a but spendy ($20 per entree) I think we certainly got what we paid for. The service was excellent too. They even have a vegan menu!

Boom.

That's all you need to know. 

If you're a vegan, you obviously know that Steve Wynn's Empire is very vegan-friendly, which each of his restaurants featuring an entire plant-based menu. If you're looking for a gourmet breakfast or brunch, Terrace Pointe Cafe is the place to be.

Walk past the ridiculously long Buffett line (also worth checking out), and put your name down here for a table on the patio.
If you do, you'll get to be seated next to the grand canal that is their resort pool, with the beautiful sun twinkling off the soft ripples of the water. It is a gorgeous view and I'm low...high-key jealous of those who are swimming in it. 
As mentioned before, there is an entirely separate vegetarian/vegan menu that is pretty expansive and doesn't cut any corners. Gourmet salads, soups, and appetizers are just the beginning. They've recently added Impossible Sliders to the menu! I must come back to try their version as I love the Impossible Burger.

But I had my eyes on 1 thing, and 1 thing only-The Vegan Chicken & Waffles.

And the Unlimited Mimosas.

Ok ok, so 2 things. But in my mind, it is the perfect Brunch.

Our server set us down with 2 fresh glasses of bubbly & juice and we soaked in the warmth. Our server kept them coming all meal long, having two full glasses ready for us not long after we've sipped the last. She knew what we wanted and she delivered!

When our meal arrived, my eyes hungrily gazed at the monster that appeared before me. A full-sized waffle topped with a large extra crispy sized veg chicken cutlet on top. A whopping serving of vegan butter and TWO syrups for my delight (regular & spicy!).

I poured the syrup & butter over my dish and savored each and every one of those crispy, warm, sweet, spicy, salty bites. I'm not a huge chicken & waffles gal. In fact, I think the concept is pretty weird; But I came to Vegas to indulge, and indulge I did.

3/4 of a waffle, 1 tablespoon of vegan butter & syrup, and 5 glasses of mimosas later, the world started feeling light. I felt perfectly stuffed, with a slight feeling of gluttony. The mimosas & 90-degree weather made me want to pull a pillow our right then and there and take a [fat] cat nap.

But our server wasn't done with us yet. She did not take no for an answer. Instead, she ordered us up 1 more round of mimosas and put it into a takeaway cup and sent us on our way.

I drank it on the walk back to our resort, and immediately & happily passed out for a few hours before resuming the rest of our day. It is definitely the best way to start our vacation.",x9DRvDktxccwvZemaOMgZA,8,6,5,oX7UrkISUVyKLxg3SyME7g

Decor: 4, being a restaurant in Wynn, it's expected the standard to be high and it's very flower-y inside but things really go downhill from that point.

Food: 1, I ordered a BBQ bacon burger and the food came in under-flavored and was way too greasy. Ordered the burger at medium well but turned out to be well done. 

Value: 1, for the food that we ordered, it was totally over-priced. I really expected much greater things for a burger that's $17. (no sides)

This affordable and casual elegant location is prime for al fresco dining and beautiful people watching, especially since it's on a small terrace facing the main pool. For those afraid of the Las Vegas sun, there are plenty of umbrellas to keep you from getting sun damaged. We all know that it can be challenging at times to find a restaurant in a casino that has a lot of natural lighting in Las Vegas, so this is an excellent option to take for a short break from all of the noisy slot machines and second hand smoke that you encounter while being stuck indoors. 

The main dining room is not pretentious, but very inviting. The terrace is where al fresco fans will be most satisfied.

The portions are large like your standard Cheesecake Factory dishes and fulfilling. On top of that, the service was mediocre.

We both indulged in a chicken and waffles feed, and I enjoyed mixing both the sweet and spicy sauces (finger-licking good mmm) while the waffles were nice and fluffy. We also opted for the bottomless mimosas (I blame the mister) even though we didn't actually have that long to linger, on the very logical basis that the refillable option was the same price as ordering two, so we swiftly got to our third glass each and felt like we were totally winning at life ;)
What sealed the 5-star deal though was the service - we started with a guy who had us laughing out loud enough to upsell us the mimosa refills (not that we took any convincing in our newlywed bliss) and finished with a different server - but both on-the-ball and total sweethearts.

I got the Benedict trio and a side of skillet potatoes.  First off the skillet potatoes are basically thick...not quite crispy, not quite tender potato chips.  Not at all what I wanted or expected.  The pork belly Benedict was horrible.  I literally checked if there was blood in my mouth because it tasted so metallic and just like blood.  So gross.  The traditional Benedict was better but I can make it better myself at home.  The crab was the best one and it wasn't even that great.  The crabcake was soggy.  The hollandaise had no flavor.  The egg wasn't even poached correctly.  Just not great at all.  

My husband got the LEO which is lox, eggs scrambled and a bagel with dill cream cheese.  Think he was expecting the traditional locks with a bagel and capers and onions as it stated on the menu but this came like a sandwich with the egg and everything on the bagel.

We made it in time for brunch and were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and made sure that our every need was taken care of. I gotta say that the service here is a cut above the other hotel restaurants we've been to. And that has been the case for The Wynn as a whole. The food was albeit a little pricy for brunch (re: roughy $18-20 for a main dish) but the portions are hefty and you can tell that they use high quality ingredients so IMO, it was worth it.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Bagel with veggies and it was delicious. They don't skimp on the Smoked salmon which is rare to find.

What we got:
Benedict Trio ($24): it was your choice of either pulled pork, lobster, and traditional. You could pick one of each or pick whatever of the 3 you wanted. I ended up getting one of each just so I could try them all. Eggs were cooked perfectly for each of them, once you cut into them, the yolk started flowing out. For the pulled pork...pork was kind of hard and chewy which made it hard to cut. Lobster was pretty good, but left a bad aftertaste. The traditional was bland and didn't have much flavor to it. The hollandaise sauce on it tasted bland too and didn't do the dish any justice.

Fried Chicken and Waffle ($20): I would have rather gotten this dish than any of the Benedicts. It came with a spicy maple syrup so it gave the waffle a nice kick to it with it being sweet and spicy. The chicken was perfectly fried and crunchy. I would totally get this dish again if I ever came back.

Ten minutes after that request, still nothing had arrived. My girlfriend got up and asked for the manager. When we complained, about 2 minutes later the bread arrived and about a minute or two later the food arrived but completely cold. We figured that the food had been sitting back there for some time before delivery and only our complaint had motivated them to actually look for our food and bring to our table.

Pro: A nice terrace where you can sit outside and eat with a view of one of the pools.
Con: Outdoor seating was closed today at lunch, even though there was perfect weather and a gentle breeze.

Pro: The setting is nice and even though the place is huge, it feels intimate.
Con: The service was laughable.  Total rookie camp, which is not the norm at Wynn.  I think our waiter was either on drugs or had a stomach ailment.  He was acting weird and kept disappearing for long stretches of time.

Pro: Lovely looking shrimp cocktail.
Con: I couldn't eat it after witnessing the woman who carried it to our table holding the plate in such a way that the shrimp was actually touching her shirt (right between her armpit and right breast).

Pro: Reasonably priced food for being inside a Strip resort.
Con: My turkey club which is pretty hard to mess up didn't taste good.

Pro: Wynn picked up the tab for our table as a comp.
Con: We could have better spent that money at any other dining establishment on property.

When we first arrived in Vegas I was so starving I was tempted to gnaw at my arm. We found Terrace Pointe Cafe and I ordered a turkey burger which if it weren't for my hunger, I probably wouldn't have eaten much of; it was so dry!! The service was horrible. I had to ask for water at least 3 times, they served us warm beer and were inattentive for most of our stay. 

The second experience was much MUCH better. We sat outside next to the pool, which, if you're going to eat here, it's a must to sit outside. The weather was beautiful while we were there so it was a real treat to enjoy a lovely meal in the sun. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and it was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. It was fresh, full of yummy stuff like avocado, corn relish and black beans. It was topped with BBQ chicken and a chipotle ranch dressing. Man, I wish they had that exact same salad here in SF. 

Bottom line is, if you're staying at the Wynn, come here and order the BBQ Chicken Salad. If you're not staying at the Wynn, I'd probably leave this one be.

Still a bit expensive, like everything at the Wynn, but we enjoyed everything we ate, the portions were large, and it's open 24 hours. 

Food (4 stars):

I was a bit leery of the Teriyaki chicken sandwich--I mean don't all those ""teriyaki"" sandwiches taste pretty much the same? But this one was good! The chicken was tender, the sauce wasn't sickly sweet or overpowering, and the bun was hearty. It was a good sandwich. I usually only eat half a sandwich when they are big, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. And it came with onion rings. Yea!

Other things we tried: 

Spaghetti bolognese with garlic bread was really heavy on the meat but tasty. Salad (mixed greens or something simple like that) came with a flavorful vinaigrette. Grilled veggie pita with couscous was really good. Manhattan clam chowder was pretty good but a little salty. A cup was just enough. And the coffee was good.

Service (1 star):

I just have to say that the service we experienced in Las Vegas was pretty much across the board bad (or on the bad side of the spectrum). I thought Las Vegas was supposed to be a service-oriented town, but it's the worst service I've ever experienced. And I'm a pretty patient and undemanding person when it comes to service. 

The times we went to the Terrace Pointe Cafe, service was slooow (even when not busy; slooooower when it was), the waiters would disappear after serving your food and you couldn't even spy one across the room to wave them down for a bit of ketchup or your bill. Personality-wise the waiters we got were courteous but either overworked/indifferent or somewhat snooty.

My advice: 1) Be prepared in advance for anything you might possibly need for your meal and ask for it all at once. 2) Keep an eye out for your waiter and when you are close to 3/4 done with your meal, flag him down for your check and any take-home boxes you might need even if you plan to stay a bit longer over dessert and coffee.

Bleu cheese truffle chips: Pretty good, but not as good as BOA.  The bleu cheese wasn't as pungent and salty as the kinds that go in my salads, so that was a good thing.  Some of the chips were also soft. . .bad.

Upon seating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our beverages, my water was never topped off.  Numerous employees walked by my empty water several times.  At one point I got up out of my seat and walked over to the bar to get my water refilled myself, the bartender proceeded to key punch something in the computer and didn't even look up at me or greet me even though I was hovering and in obvious need of assistance.  When I finally interjected, he didn't even let me say what I needed and told me that he'll ""be right back"" with an annoyed tone.  The food was just mediocre, nothing special.  The steak I had with my eggs was extremely fatty for a strip and was very thin, the biscuits and gravy are an outright abomination. Given the fact that this eatery is located on the Wynn property, I figured it would be paired with a ""Wynn"" level of service, I was wrong.  It's a shame that this experience is going to lead to me having to find a new favorite casino/hotel when I venture to Vegas in the future, get it together!",GbaktcjnpzYjvkDAo7t2LQ,0,0,1,MmPFgqwYmsb3mLTQ5nxDyw

My family knew to order right away because it takes forever to get your food so we did so and like we expected, took awhile to get our food.

I wanted to update my experience, as I visited again in April 2018. We came back to Vegas for a friend's wedding and were only in town for two days. Rather than take a chance and trying brunch somewhere else, we decided to journey back to our favorite, the Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn. Coming here is such a treat. The Wynn is absolutely stunning and it's a lot of fun just walking through and seeing all of the shops and restaurants, as well as the hard to miss gambling sections. The Terrace Pointe Cafe sits right along the pool, so you can choose to dine inside or outside. Given that it was nearly 100 degrees, we chose the inside option. Service here was excellent, as it was when we had visited previously. I tried the Sunrise Juice to start, which was carrots, orange and strawberry juice. It was super tasty and really refreshing. Brendan and I ordered the same exact meals we did the last time we visited- he went with the Eggs Benedict (with hash browns this time) and I went with the Vegan Chicken and Waffles. Ordering vegetarian/ vegan here is extremely easy here, as they have a complete menu dedicated to these options. The cost of the vegan version of chicken & waffles is the exact same as the regular chicken & waffles, which I love. Again, the food was extraordinary.

Its a great place to go over the pictures on the camera, delete whats needs to be deleted, organize memories, and alibi's if need be and just have a good last couple of laughs over whatever vegas style adventures we've had on that particular visit. 

We usually sit at the bar, have a couple of their excellent bloody mary's (they actually usually the spicy vodka, the only kind that belongs in bloody marys in my opinion) an order of the lobster benedict, and whatever else tickles our fancy on the menu. The lobster benedict is as rich and decadent as it sounds. Its not served on a soggy english muffin, instead its on a perfectly spiced crispy potato croquette, they are not at all stingy with the fresh lobster, and the asparagus is always crispy and perfect. The hollandaise is not to rich or eggy, or to heavily poured on, just enough to bind all the other tastes together. I usually order mine sans bacon (I just like to taste the lobster without all that smoky baconess) and fried eggs over easy instead of poached, because of personal preference. We've also ordered the salad with goat cheese beignets. The beignets are indulgent, crispy crunchy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside, the salad goes well with them as it cuts the richness. They also have a lobster and crab salad that I love; I always ask for rolls when we get it  because its not a green salad, but a mixed salad that is just begging to be eaten on roll drizzled with hot sauce. We've also tried a steak salad, that didnt dissapoint either. I've had the crab cakes here as well, but was not really impressed with them, it was the first time in my life I thought to myself I wish there was less crab in these cakes, they just lacked other flavor, I kept thinking ""I want to take these back to kitchen myself and season them up right"". One miss in a series of hits is not enough to make me say I dont love place, truly I do! 

The service at the bar is always attentive, occasionally we are forced to take a table because of the size of our group or because the bar is full, dont be deterred by the line outside, they are quite efficient at getting people seated and fed, however you will never feel rushed to leave.

2742544,2009-02-19,3,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"We were in between breakfast and lunch so we ordered French onion soup, lobster benedict, and waffles with fresn strawberries.

Atmosphere was lovely.
Service was good.
Food was so so.

The French onion soup had way too much bread which basically soaked up the soup and left us with an entire crock pot of mush.  The cheese was melted perfectly on top and was deliciously savory but did not make up for the pile of mush beneath it.

The eggs benedict was pretty good, but it certainly wasn't the best we had tasted.  They were trying to be creative by serving a mini waffle under the poached egg insted of an English muffin, but the mini waffle did not have a good bite to it like an English muffin would have thus there wasn't a great contrast of texture with the egg.  

The lobster was cut into small pieces and sprinkled around the plate.  There was also bacon cut into small pieces too and sprinkled around the plate.  The saltiness of the bacon and the lobster surprisingly went well together and did not clash.  I wonder if it would have been better without the bacon, as the lobster flavor would really sand out.  Perhaps, adding some sliced avocado in place of bacon might be a good flavor pairing although typical.  

The waffles were crispy and yum. We asked if we could have both the whip cream and butter on the side, but they brought it with the whip cream on top and the butter on the side...it's like...HELLO...what part of BOTH do you not get?

Anyway, our waitress was attentive and the hostesses were very nice.  Although I might have preferred going to the buffet for breakfast for around the same price as my eggs benedict!!!

Me and sis had a burger each and our mom had the waffle with strawberries.
Everything was okay...I remember being super hungry so the burger went down and I don't even remember how it tasted.

I see how everyone is liking the Vegetarian Chicken and waffles...
If I ever go again...I might try this.
Lobster Benedict...I believe was $$$$. I love Egg Benedict but I'm not much of a lobster person. So spending $$$$ wouldn't make much sense to me.

My mom did love her coffee...I believe they give you a whole jug of it...
And ofcourse my mom finished it. lol

Spending $50 + tax and tip  for 3 is decent.

What color socks did I have on? I take 20 minutes of my day for this guy so he can HELP. He gets off the phone telling me he will check into it and get things taken care of and made right.

I was eating breaking the other morning on the patio at the Terrace Point, outside with a nice view of the pool. We got out there at 9:15, as soon as they opened the outdoor seating (which seems a little late for a breakfast place). 
Anyway, the meal and the staff was fine, and this place was a solid four stars right until as we were finishing up and all the tables we filling, everyone outside was set upon by more and more BIRDS. First pigeons, then grackles, then all sorts of birds. This must be their breakfast buffet, because they were arriving in waves! They got so bold as to land on the table of people eating, and peck at their food! A couple of tables stood up and left.
So we paid up and left, seeing as we actually had finished our meal, As a parting gift, the birds pooped on our table twice, and hit a lady sitting across from us on her arm. Very unappetizing.

While it may seem like a nice idea to actually have breakfast on the outdoor terrace in the nice weather and overlooking the Wynn pool, I would strongly recommend against it on account of a serious problem the outdoor portion of the restaurant has with birds, specifically the fairly aggressive--and hungry--great-tailed grackles.  The grackles will perch themselves on top of the umbrellas and then come down any opportunity they get to pick at leftovers or stacks of cleared plates.  It is pretty unappetizing to watch as five of these birds fly down to the table next to you and pick at whatever they can get.  After I requested to be moved inside, they turned on the mist machines, which seemed to help temporarily but, sure enough, the birds returned undeterred.  And if you must dine outside, by no means leave your table temporarily unattended.  Get one of the waitstaff to watch over your food if you have to, or else you may return to find your food having been picked at by these rats with wings.

I wanted a Benedict but the only two on the menu were a lobster version and one with pulled pork, so I passed. I ended up ordering a bagel and cream cheese and a Greek yogurt with berries and granola. 

First there was some confusion among the bartenders about the bagel, which I wouldn't have known if they hadn't each asked me if the other was getting my bagel. Then when it came it was burned. It would have been crappy even if it weren't blackened - is this bagel seriously the best available in Las Vegas?  It has to be, right, because if there were a better bagel I would think Mr. Wynn would have found it, right?  The saving grace was the cream cheese, which was definitely not from a tub. 

The yogurt with berries and granola was better but it was way too big, probably to justify the $14 price. Seriously, y'all?  For yogurt and a couple dozen berries?  It had blueberries, blackberries and strawberries over some bland yogurt - I asked for vanilla but I think I got plain.

ATMOSPHERE- Definitely a classy feeling here, the outside balcony by the pool is very relaxing with a nice view, overall a very nice place.

If you're a fan of eggs benedict, you'll love this place.  They offer crab cake, pork belly, and classic eggs benedict, or a trio of all three with *no sides*, so it's all benedict, all the time.  My friends got the biscuits, which were similarly drowning in gravy (though she loved it), and my friend got the steak frites, which were pretty passable, though it cooked medium despite asking for medium rare (understandable on such a thin cut, though).  

The main issue, I think, was just how *heavy* everything was.  Their hollandaise, while still tasty, is a crazy heavy, especially when paired with thick, salty bacon and/or fried crab cake.  Their bloody mary, at $16, was garnished with just a lemon and an olive, and even after I squeezed the entire damn lemon in, was still pulpy with tomato and salt.  A dash more lemon juice in both food and drink would have gone a long way :P  

The service, and perhaps the unwillingness to wait in The Buffet line, are the main draws of this place.  Our servers were warm, attentive, and quickly brought us the check (as we were in a rush.)  Overall, I think there are better dining options, unless you want to be fawned over for an hour or two.  Then, I'd probably give this place another shot.

So, so good, with uber fresh ingredients, like celery, fresh peas, lettuce, bright and flavorful!!! There was chicken, and some fresh herbs, and at least 4 other ingredients. loved the light dressing as well. Fresh taco-like shell that has the texture of Chinese shrimp chips, with sesame seeds embedded in it. Salad was about $16

Disappointing was a $4 cup of nasty, non crispy, flabby fries that accompanied a French size grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich in chipotle sauce. Good, but def not worth $17.

3514814,2014-05-25,3,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"Terrace Pointe is an underrated breakfast/brunch spot that probably receives low marks due to a somewhat high price point (compared to off-strip breakfast spots) and location in the Wynn which does nothing but raise expectations. But my visit with a friend a while back showed was filled with some good and great eats. The best of what I sampled was a brioche French toast retaining much of its batter to give it a cake-like texture and coated with Cap'n Crunch cereal to provide a crispy exterior. Topped off with a banana that was perfectly caramelized and bits of toffee and buttered pecans to counterbalance the soft bread, it all combined to make an excellent rendition of this breakfast staple.

The red velvet pancakes were another hit. Between each layer of the short stack of rich, cakey, and dense pancakes were layers of a vanilla cream glaze that make this the ultimate treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. If you want something more savory, try the Maine lobster benedict. I appreciated the light application of hollandaise -- just enough, with the perfect egg to butter ratio making it creamy and velvety. Bits of bacon dotted the interior of the light, crispy waffle and was topped with small chunks of lobster firm in texture. Another waffle dish -- the crispy fried chicken and waffles -- had similar crispy edged waffles and chicken with a crispy and crunchy exterior, if somewhat bland. It may not have been the best dish of the morning, but was good enough to satisfy.

You may be paying a premium because of the location, but the quality far exceeded my expectations. Wait times can be long during peak hours so its best to come before or after the rush. They also have patio seating overlooking their pool.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,6,4,y93LgSWnC0pq2nk5p3PUhQ

I like the experience to be fresh in my head in order to properly rate it. With the Vegan brunch at Terrace Pointe, one only needs to try it once to know it's the most fabulous brunch you'll find in Vegas.

We wanted to splurge for a final meal in Vegas, and why wouldn't it be at Uncle Steve's Vegan-friendly paradise of The Wynn?

Sure $20 for Chicken and Waffles ain't no joke. Especially considering we have the best version of this back home in The East Bay Area at Hella Vegan Eats and Timeless Coffee, for much less. Thankfully they're not serving up tiny foo foo portions here. No, this is definite hangover food in size and taste. So much so that this was the only place in town that we needed a to go bag. The waffle was fantastic and I wish I knew how they got the coating so perfectly on the huge slab of Gardein. 

The Strawberry French Toast was a bit cheaper, yet still pricey. This was my honey's order, yet I ended up eating more of it than she did. I'm usually more of a savory vs sweet breakfast eater, but if you are going the sweet route, you can't go wrong with this dish. The french toast was perfectly made in the ""I can't believe it's Vegan"" way. So light 'n fluffy, you would never know unless someone told you.

The reason my honey didn't have room for all of her French Toast was the Blackberry Tart. We ordered that since we knew we wouldn't be eating anywhere else that day. Not bad, as these Wynn folks know their pastries pretty well. 

The homefries we got on the side were so so. They could've used more crisp to 'em. What I would not order is the side of Gardein sausage. Nothing special about it. In fact the two entrees were such good portions that this was overkill. Sure there are a few healthy Vegan entrees on the menu but you're not here for that. Just get the French Toast, Chicken, And Waffles, It's all you need to begin your day. 

The carafe of coffee that the friendly waitress left at the table was a nice old school diner touch that I was not expecting from such a $$$ place. Their uniforms were also very old school and ill fitting. I'm not expecting cocktail waitress apparel, but c'mon Uncle Steve, help these ladies out here!

Sure, I could knock them on price. But you know what, it's Vegas. You don't come here because you're looking to save a few pennies. I would come here all over again, as it was probably my favorite meal in town. Especially ever since the closing of Pura Vida. Brunch is the most important meal of the day other than maybe beer. Then again, you need some food to soak up that booze and I can't think of anywhere else I would rather start my day, other than Terrace Pointe Cafe.

3642716,2013-07-14,2,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"""What does Steve get?""

While dining at Red 8 (another Wynn establishment), a server told us that if you ask this question at any restaurant at the Wynn, they will tell you what Mr. Wynn's favorite menu selections are. Or, at least what the vegan options are (he happens to be vegan).

Our server didn't know.

No matter. All of the restaurants at the Wynn have separate vegetarian menus, and that's what we ordered from. I couldn't resist the chicken and waffles and my wife had to go for the famous $9 burger, fries, and shake deal.

While we waited, we took in the atmosphere. It was way too hot to eat on the patio, but that seems to be the main attraction.

Even if you're an omnivore like me, I recommend checking out the vegetarian menu. I had never seen vegan ""chick'n"" and waffles before, and other diners near us were fascinated when our orders were brought out. Also, the chicken and waffles were damned good. This is an example of mock meat that could possibly fool someone. The scallion waffles came with regular as well as spicy syrup, and vegan ""butter"" (Earth Balance?) My wife's cheeseburger was a Gardein burger with Daiya cheese, ketchup, mustard, and pickles designed to replicate similar fare from the Golden Arches, and it came pretty close. The only flaw, strangely, was the bun, which didn't quite have the proper look and taste. I still liked it. The fries were probably made without all of the 17 ingredients that go into Mickey D's fries:

http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnutrition/ingredientslist.pdf

The non-dairy chocolate shake was quite tasty too. All told, not a bad deal for $9. It's worth a try, but I don't know the value offset that of my $20 meal.

The Wynn probably has better options whether or not you eat meat, but we definitely enjoyed our meals, and we are really glad that they can accommodate special diets, including gluten-free.

Two of our friends have very strictly held beliefs against eating meat, specifically pork. They ordered huevos rancheros from the vegan menu and we were horrified to discover they had given her the wrong dish, and she ended up eating pork for the first time in 28 years. The staff didn't realize how important this was for her, they tried to make up for it by comping her meal but unfortunately nothing can take back her experience of eating pork and breaking a lifetime of commitment to her religious beliefs. She was mortified, and was unable to continue with brunch. She was visibly distraught and tearful. They offered to call security to make some type of incident report but after an hour no one showed up. I'm just so shocked because what if his was a life threatening food allergy? This place needs to be more conscious and aware of dietary restrictions of their guests. It's safe to say I will not be coming back. Nothing and no comps can make up for what was taken from her.

3652445,2009-03-25,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"Having seen that the line for the Wynn Buffet was at least a good hour and a half long, my friends and I headed a little further down the hall to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.  

Once she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.  

My entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.

My dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a true New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.

The service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.

The one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.

It surpasses the rather old-tasteless bling bling Bellagio cafe with a darker and more sinister tone. But we like! It's a café where couples have done sinful things and taking a break for a quick bite. It's a café where I can imagine Trent Reznor or Marilyn Manson would dine.  It's a café where if you have kids running and screaming, the servers might cage them and cook them into  sinister yet delicious soups.

I get that it was busy but we were seated and within 10 seconds I was expected to order a drink before I even picked up the drink menu. I asked that he come back, he never did. I put my order in with the waiter and he passed it on to the drink guy. The waiter came by 2 times way too quickly to take the order and the second time was very pushy about us ordering. 

Serving is finding a balance between being prompt and being slow. This place does not have this down. From the other reviews they sound slow, my experience was they were too pushy. They should just go in between the extremes.",HU7mGkNrI0jJ0Ha6rqZY1g,1,1,3,qke6ldWFtw3lNC_ujiryVQ
3690662,2015-05-11,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"We had a very bad experience at Terrace Pointe Café during breakfast. Grackle birds were constantly dive bombing customers and the food! The staff seemed to just be used to working around them and ignoring them. Two girls sitting near us asked to be moved inside after one flew down, sat on the back of my chair, and began chirping loudly. Another guy took several pics on his phone of four birds picking at the dishes of a vacated table next to him. My husband was salting his newly arrived omelet when a grackle swooped in and took a bite off his plate! DISGUSTING. The staff didn't seem to notice. At first, my husband decided to just let it go - he cut away the half of the omelet that the bird had attacked and put it on my coffee saucer, then continued his meal. The bird later returned for food and knocked the saucer off the table, shattering it. It was then that we got up to complain. 

We received a half-hearted apology from the manager and my husband's plate was taken off our bill. The manager seemed indifferent to the situation, saying that grackles are a protected species in Nevada and the hotel is working on an environmental solution, whatever that means. I would suggest that the Wynn hire a full-time bird minder in the meantime. 

I do not understand how this is not a health code violation. Other reviews list this as an ongoing issue dating as far back as 2010. It was disgusting and completely unacceptable to see dozens of birds hopping around on serving trays, digging under napkins into abandoned bread baskets, and generally just being nuisances to all of us tryjng to enjoy our $21 breakfast plates and get out as soon as possible.",BzkSh6rluCFWB6wMUstRRg,3,0,1,sDngTc54eZpJsleuIncQHQ
3691985,2013-08-18,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"Review of dining experience:
My party of 4 and I were seated promptly upon arrival. We ordered drinks  for starters and my friend had a long piece of hair in his water! Gross! We asked a worker to change the water and it took about 20 minutes before his new water came out. The other drinks were served within a reasonable time but it took forever just to get water! We probably asked a different waitress/hostess/busboy/supervisor a few times because we didn't know which one was our waitress. It was just water and not in the food so we forgot about it but I just realized that we weren't even offered a discount for an unenjoyable experience. Yes, no biggie for water but it would have been nice for a higher end cafe to offer something more than an embarrassed apology. Unprofessional for the setting but ohh well. 

Review of the vegan chickn with scallion waffles:
It's pretty good! I ordered this just to try it. The chicken is like a big crispy chicken nugget... Maybe tofurkey? I'm a carnivore though so it wasn't the taste I was looking for that day. 

The scallion waffles (scallions are actually added in the batter!) are served with maple syrup and vegan butter. You don't really taste the scallions and its a good combination. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're vegetarian or vegan, but if ya love your chicken, the cost is the same for real chicken and waffles PLUS eggs! I kinda wished I got the breakfast non-vegan option with eggs instead. 

If you're a carnivore but want to taste a more affordable vegan dish, the veggie burger comes with fries and a chocolate shake for $9! I kinda wish I tried that instead.

Review of the coffee:

I'm guessing a lot of people have the ""monday flu"" after a busy weekend!  None the less the food was really terrific.  First and foremost they had a healthy fresh green juice that I love and enjoy so that was a treat.  I ordered trio of eggs benediict and except for a couple of minor things, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfect sauce.  Pefectly poached eggs.  One had lobster and it was simply overcooked.  That came with corn and green been hash that was fresh, fresh, fresh and perfectly al dente.  One of the trios was with pork belly on a bisquit.  It may have been pork belly but i think most people would know it as thick cut bacon.  Tasty but not the slow cooked, soft and uber fatty pork belly I've had elsewhere.

He says he's had the best chicken and waffles here so he built up my expectations pretty high. Something to note is that they have a dress code (for girls: no sheer tops/bare midriffs, guys need sleeves), but they allow you to sit outside if you're not dressed to their standards. 
We went with a rather large group and shared a bunch of items so that we would be able to try more things. The service was pretty slow, it took a while for our waitress to show up, and it took an excessively long amount of time for our food to show up. 
Salmon Benedict: special of the day and it was okay. Nothing too special.
Short Stack Pancakes: very fluffy!
Chicken and Waffles: it's pretty amazing. You gotta cut into all the layers because only the bottom waffle has bacon in the waffle! YUM! It also comes with a spicy syrup, but you can get it on the side if you're not a big fan of spicy.
Corned Beef Hash: In general I'm not a big fan of corned beef hash, but the boys all loved it. The eggs came out wrong on our order, so we had them recook eggs for us. 
Avocado Bacon Omelet: also nothing special
I think my favorite thing about this meal had to have been the potatoes. They are freakin' delicious and I just couldn't get enough. They were like chips except crunchy on the outside and still chewy on the inside. I could probably get a side order of those potatoes for myself and just eat that as my meal! I may be a bit bias though because I have a bit of a potato obsession.

3757873,2013-07-09,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"7/4, 7/6/13  Breakfast

I made a point to not dine at the bland and pretentious Society Cafe at Encore again since my last visit to Vegas. Terrace Pointe is Wynn's counterpart (table service, higher end) minus all that Iron Chef hype. What I like most is the outdoor dining patio overlooking the Wynn pool. The dining room is very spacious with high ceiling and a full bar. They do have a strict dress code IN THE DINING ROOM: no tank top for men (which I brazenly perpetrated on an 115F day) and no sheer cover-up for ladies. I care less because I come for the patio.

We made two visits this 4th of July weekend for breakfast; both service and food were distinctive. Like I mentioned in my review of Peppermill Lounge, prices are steep in Vegas unlike you do the food court plastic tray thing. Terrace Pointe is actually very reasonable consider you can very good service in a fine decor.

*Oatmeal ($14): with sliced banana, raspberries, blackberries, walnuts, raisins all in separate mini cups. The perfect healthy option to begin the day. My companions also had mini morning buns.

*Brioche French Toast ($16): I surrendered to my long craving. This is some of the best French toast I've had. Dipped in egg and cinnamon batter, with candied walnuts, caramerlized banana and toffee brittle. The toffee is too sweet and is not my thing. I peeled off the caramel off my banana. French toast itself is excellent. 

*Huevos Rancheros on Skillet ($17): fluffy scrambled egg on a bed of refried beans. I don't remember this item from last time. My companion said it was tasty.

*Pancakes and Eggs ($17): their pancakes are too thick to my preference, but crispy and not chewy. Bacons crispy and scrambled eggs are far better than Peppermill and other breakfast joints around the strip. 

*Classic Breakfast ($17): three eggs any style, in my case scrambled, with bacon or sausage. Apple chicken sausage is better than Peppermill and Society Cafe. Potato are thinly sliced and roasted, almost like warm potato chips!

I notice this time that they no longer offer the Double Down Breakfast which allows you to choose any two breakfast items for $18. Inflation?

Overall verdict: The perfect breakfast spot if you want a relaxing, quiet, and beautiful environment with great service. That it's in the Wynn suggests the clientele is more polished. Sometimes I come in here and just read over coffee, which is served in a thermal, before I order food. They just leave me alone. It's my staple breakfast joint in Vegas.

French Toast Brioche with Cap'n Crunch crust - freaking loved this dish, and not as sweet as it sounds, which made it even better. You choose between Cap'n, Frosted Flakes, or Granola for the crust, but it's really lightly battered on. The brioche is so soft and there's a little fruit on top to mix-in. 

Garden Frittata - the healthy nature of this egg white + lots of veggies omelet stood in stark contrast to the decadent French Toast. I think it could have used more flavor, required Tabasco sauce, so I'd probably opt for a different omelet next time.

The portions are manageable, but we ordered and split these two dishes, which was a good way to achieve a sweet and savory breakfast meal.",J8_KEdgc9_k9PCLia16DlA,0,0,4,dBabmvA040UvMKv58-3nwQ

The service was good, a nice change since service at Wynn had been uncharacteristically poor that weekend. Our coffee was very extra hot which we loved and was well brewed. 

The price was what I expected, not cheap, and was completely worth the price. I highly recommend this over any other breakfast establishment in the hotel.",7RdAfzLeyBKo5oWYDd2v8Q,1,0,4,Z4iU3ZtPMgSD4ZhA8_OWzw

The weird thing is that we did not get the food until 11:00 am, which was more like lunch by now, but the worst part of it, is it screwed all our plan for the day, as we had lots of things to see with my family, we ended up cancelling going to the Circus Circus for my son because of that.
When exclaiming about our foos, the answer was always ""it will be here soon"".
At the end, the waiter appologizzed and said the kitchen is over whelmed...

Traditional breakfast -- Two eggs (anyway you like it), your choice of meat, and hash browns. If I were to get this at Denny's, I would normally feel all groggy and heavy after. Terrace Point definitely reminded me that I was eating at the Wynn. Light, close to no greasy oil, and simple.

We wanted to get brunch, but we didn't want to enter a food coma, so we decided to try out Terrace Pointe Cafe.  (We would have gone off the Strip if we had access to a car, but we didn't that weekend.)

THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL.  I had low expectations based on other reviews I've read here, but it didn't even meet that low bar.  Our waitress Heather was terrible, and the guy who took our drink order was nice at first but then totally ignored us.  Not only did we have to ask multiple times for bread, but we didn't get drink refills, and it took a LONG time to place our order and get our food.  The food took so long to come out that everything was lukewarm.  We would have sent it back, but we were starving by the time it finally showed up.

The bf was steaming mad by the time we got our check, and we only ended up tipping $1, on a check that was over $30 (speaking of which, the entrees are really expensive for what they are -- my turkey burger was $15!).

As for the food, the bf had the breakfast plate which came with pancakes and eggs and sausage links.  It also had toast, I think?  He said it was OK.  The turkey burger was decent but not that great.

If I could have had my way with Terrace Point's menu, I would have. But I was trying not to cheat on my low-carb diet TOO much, so I opted for the dungeness crab benedict. It tasted better than it sounds. Amaze! Their homemade English muffin was topped with finely shredded potato, giant chunks of crab and topped with swiss cheese and hollandaise. I was in heaven.

I even cheated a little and got an apple walnut muffin, which was so gigantic I took it home on the plane with me.  My husband was so excited that they had fried chicken and waffles. They even have a spicy maple syrup for it, if you're feeling adventurous :) 

And our server was kind enough to speed up service so that we could catch our flight, although I was so sad to leave.

I have always really liked the Terrace Pointe Cafe. I have been dining here during the Summer months for years, and sometimes during the not so warm months if I am at Wynn for an event or a show. The Cafe sits overlooking the Wynn pool and is a nice view when the weather is warm ;)

 Here is the thing..it's a cafe. Simple, but elegant in it's styling. Used to be 24 hours, but now only into late night I believe. I have always been a fan. You can get everything from a burger and fries to a Vegetarian menu option of a burger and fries. I have had their 'veggie burger' and fries served with a cashew milk-chocolate shake and really enjoyed it. 

it's comfortable, and clean, and the food is made well and tastes good. Sure it's not your most typically priced 24 hour, but you are on a 5 star property and the food is comparable to the price point. That being said, it's usually about $40 each when I have dined at Terrace Point, but we have a few drinks, appetizers, dinner.. it's all good and not too much more than I would spend at any other cafe around Vegas.

We ordered the Cobb salad with the Greek dressing, truffle fries, BLT and a Caesar Salad. The Cobb looked delish and was confirmed as so by the beau and the Caesar needed more dressing. My BLT and truffle fries were super yummy! I just wish they gave me a side of mayo....  :). (Traditionalist here!)

Overall a 3 and easily could have been a 4 but the lack of service and our time crunch and us havering to hail 3 wait staff then actually get up and find our waitress....dropped it down to a 3....",plzQ-mwWaxfUH2OfAyvSUw,0,0,3,ukzXguGwb9lqL5evzO7-Sg

Had the opportunity to try their Vegetarian 'Chicken' & Waffles & their Croissant French toast.. both were AMAZING!!!

I am a huge lover of meat & their Vegetarian Chicken & waffles taste exactly like the real thing, down to the texture of how fried chicken would be. They have IMO perfected this dish!

The Croissant French toast was HUGE! Definitely can be ordered as a side & shared between 2-3 ppl.. Taste was absolutely mouth watering, the chef's ability to combine the crispiness and flakiness of the croissant paired with the sweetness of fruits and syrup was a home run.

Highly recommend these two dishes if you're pondering what to order.

He highly recommended the lobster benedict saying it had blown his mind the first time. I don't take his recommendations lightly either, he has a refined taste pallet hah.

We literally had half our party order lobster benedict expecting the world because it sure as hell sounded great. Upon receiving my dish I was starved and surely thought anything that tasted semi decent would satisfy me. Boy was I wrong. The egg was COOKED through and the yoke did not break and ooze out as a proper benedict should. The piece of bacon served on top and I quote from a friend tasted like ""ASS"". This is bacon we are talking about, how hard is it to mess up bacon!? Instead of a typical english muffin or some sort of bread the benedict was served on hash browns and the textures did not blend well at all. I could go on and on about how the dish conceptually and flavor wise went wrong. Bottom line it was a big FAIL. 

We asked if the chef changed recently and the waiter confirmed that there was a change in the chef. Bring back the talent please.

We stayed at the Wynn for the first time, and on both Saturday and Sunday, we visited this place to have a solid meal, the ability to watch the Olympics on TV, in air conditioning, and without having to wait in the extensive line for a table.  The terrace part of the restaurant looked nice, but to be honest, at 11am on a Vegas sunny day, this really didn't appeal to me.  We were given the bar option, since a table would mean we'd have to wait for about 20 minutes.  After sitting down, we both ordered the sangrias from Peggy the bartender, and put in orders for strawberry pancakes (Greg) and Bacon Avocado Omelette (me).  The drinks came up pretty quick, and when the food arrived it looked heavenly.  Bacon, avocado, and eggs are my favorite combo in an omelette, and when I cut into it, the whole thing was spilling out bacon bits (held off on the cheese that comes with it).  The whole thing was completely delicious and I had just enough room to sample some of Greg's pancakes.  As someone who typically avoids heavy breakfast, I would consider ordering this next time.  Those pancakes were outstanding and even baked in the strawberries rather than using it as a garnish.  The second day we came here, we had lunch since breakfast was over.  Greg had the BBQ Bacon Burger and I had the lunch combo with the Asian Chicken Salad, BLT, and a side of potato chips.  Out all of the items, I thought the salad was the best.  The BLT was the perfect combo size, and I really didn't need the chips but it was nice to have the option.  I opted for a mimosa and Greg had a mojito.  Again, another solid meal at Terrace Pointe.

Price: Above average prices, but that's kind of what you expect when you eat at a top tier hotel/ at the strip. However, I always think I need to stay true to the fact that price matters especially onto upscale places such as these since I want to see something unique from other places, which it has here!

Service/Atmosphere: Our waitresses were both super nice and had an awesome attitude. Willingness and patience with my parents who still aren't the best of English speakers. I also enjoyed how this place was next to the hall where people were leaving/coming in and next to the pool. You can see a whole bunch of people and faces while sitting inside a nice/cool open space. Some seats also have some nice, comfortable couches to let you REALLY lounge and leisure while resting/waiting for food.

Food: Another place that seems really average compared to other places around this price point. All dishes were pretty much the same to other places. They definitely aren't memorable and is definitely bland. You can for sure find cheaper places with better food quality/taste.

Then, as I'm walking around trying to find it, one of the dealers tells me it's not open yet. Huh? So as I'm contemplating leaving Wynn and where to go for light breakfast fare/coffee, I ask another gentleman who was walking by the tables, and he said, ""It SHOULD be open"" and proceeds to walk me over there... and indeed, it was open.

I ordered 2 bagels toasted with butter on the side, 1 coffee, and 1 tomato juice with lime and it comes to $22.17 - yikes! With a small tip, it was about $24.

Factors of annoyance: certainly the birds can catch you off guard a little; what can you say, they're jus .. Birds .. That's what they do.. Am not sure if the management could or should do anything about this, I don't have an opinion on this at this point, but left to me, I'd prefer not to have those birds super close to the food.

Now the good parts- the wait time was pretty accurate, they brought the food out in time, and as my rating reflects, the food was just delicious! We had the crab Benedict and French toast, both very well made and presented. 

Gabriel was our waiter and he was terrific! Informative and good humored; simple enough you'd think, but those are two qualities that have become quite hard to find  of late at restaurants (yeah am talking about a bunch of other Vegas joints including Gordon Ramsay's burgr)

Food selection and quality is great. Breakfast, lunch, vegan, and most importantly for my family, gluten free. If you have a food allergy in your party, the chef comes to your table to ask about the allergy and walk you through the ingredients. It is absolutely wonderful and gives you great peace of mind. We really pretty much loved everything we ate here during our 5-day stay at the Wynn.

The ONLY reason I gave this 4-stars out of the 5 is because of service. 

While the chef coming to your table is wonderful, we found the servers and hostesses to be borderline rude. Our first trip here, both the host and the waiter were so cold I couldn't believe it. In terms of the hostesses, maybe it's the awful, horribly-fitted pink uniforms they have to wear (I would be miserable if I had to wear that thing too!). On our last visit to the restaurant, we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to even come to our table to take our order. Ironically, the waitress that came profusely apologized (she hadn't seen us sitting in our kind of hidden section of the restaurant) and she was very very friendly the rest of our visit. She could have taught something to the 2 other put-out waiters we had the previous visits!

Overall, go here for the food because it is GREAT, just know that the service is a work in progress. Unfortunately, the prices make that a painful pill to swallow.",XBtnvZJcPpeY1zbOxrUx6w,2,1,4,GACVHd7NOpzmzIgkgPns_A

Don't tempt me!!!  Oh, he knows my weakness for hearty vegan brunches.  Terrace Pointe Cafe pulls out all the stops, and I had to resist ordering more than one entree.  I had the french toast that is, to date, the best french toast I've ever had.  I was a little wary that the batter had banana in it (such a hippie thing to do) but it worked!  After a few bites, I didn't even really taste the fruit, and was left with a perfect interpretation of eggy french toast, without the sadness.  Well done, Terrace Pointe!

I had originally made reservations for Tableau, but when the rest of our party dropped out at the last minute, and there were no reservations available for two people, we rolled the dice with Terrace Pointe and were so delighted.  We were seated within 10 minutes, without a reservation, and had a lovely seat by the window.

Terrace Pointe Cafe, just a few steps beyond the Buffet offers a good variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees and sits quite comfortably in that lonely, yet elusive space between Wynn's numerous high-end fine dining choices and their buffet.

I thoroughly enjoyed my spaghetti bolognase at 11:00am on a Sunday morning, so I give them props for that.

The place wasn't terribly busy, but it took forever to get menus, forever to place our order, forever to get our food, and then forever to get the check (we actually never did get the check - we ended up just leaving enough money on the table).    

The waitress was rude, and acted like our requests for bread were unreasonable.  I realize its not her fault that it took close to an hour for the food to come out, but its also not crazy of us for wanting multiple bread baskets while we wait.   We were by far the youngest people in the place (we're in our early 20s...actually I guess I should say ""mid-20s""...yikes!), were dressed fairly casually, and ordered relatively cheap things, and she gave us the distinct impression that we were too poor for her classy, classy establishment.    We stiffed her - one of the few times in my life I've ever done that, but the service was beyond terrible.

The food was not terrible, but not particularly good either.  I had a Belgian waffle and my boyfriend had some kind of burger.  They were both edible but completely unmemorable.   Also, thanks to the atrocious service they were cold by the time they reached us.

It's pretty much on par with Zooza Crackers but because I went to Zooza prior to being a Yelper, I'll talk about Terrace Pointe Cafe.

Came in here for brunch and what I like about the restaurant is that it is spacious and has a great view of the Wynn pool and the sun shines through the glass doors that provide easy access to the pool itself. It really is a nice way to get your day started and a nice option if you aren't feeling like gorging yourself at a buffet.

I had the Wynn Burger and it was good partially due to the fact I was craving a burger. Nothing too fancy but it also didn't disappoint. 

A quick tip in case you're coming wanting breakfast options but instead happen to stroll in well into brunch time is that you can ask your waiter to provide a breakfast menu and they're pretty good about making what you want. It was nice because I went in thinking ""pancakes"" but my stomach and the inner-dude in me said ""get the burger."" Though I must say the pancakes did look tasty from watching the people sitting next to us enjoying various breakfast items.

In the end, this place gets the job done and is a good affordable (most items are in the $10-20 range)choice as a breakfast or lunch option where you can sit on the terrace overlooking the pool. As for later in the day, I'd opt for Zooza Crackers just because it's situated in the center of all the hustle and bustle and it's fun to people watch from their open booths.

For those of us unable to afford the luxurious accommodations that the Wynn provides, eating at their restaurants comes as the next best option.

As queen, I banish server Nicole & her TCP burger from this kingdom. Off with their heads! (kidding)

But not really. Nicole was a terrible server.. which surprised me given that the Wynn has a very extensive application/interview process & typically does a great job at weeding out the men from the boys. 

My mom & I came here on a Saturday morning and decided to split an entree.. the TCP burger with a side of sweet potatoe fries, along with a Pepsi & a vanilla latte. Besides the 15 minute wait time on our drinks, we were more then happy to sit & catch up on the terrace while we enjoyed our refreshments. Well 15 minutes turned to 30, & the 30 minute mark brought a neighboring 6 top table who continually had to keep grandma from putting salt and pepper in her juice. And then 30 minutes turned to 45 and 45 turned to an hour & grandma and the rest of the family got their food & here my mother and I, who together ordered ONE entree, are still empty handed & Nicole has not been seen or heard from. 

Nicole, it is OKAY that you forgot to put in my order & it's OKAY that the order was messed up. Any mistake that happened is OKAY. What is not okay, is that you neglected to come over & inform us of the situation & let us know that our food would be out shortly & apologize for any inconvenience. 

The burger itself was an overcooked, even burnt, hunk-a hunk-a burnin beef. Yuck! Thank sweet Buddah it's hard to mess up fries.

Not only is the first meal of the day, the meal that sets the tone for the whole day, but it includes everything delicious. Cheese, potatoes, eggs, bacon -- need I say more? I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day out. Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn is nice inside, but the outside was too perfect to pass up. The open air was laden with trees, and had a great view of their pool. Eating breakfast here was just pleasant. The service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxing.

I ordered the the Omelet Trio. It consisted of 2 mini pancakes, hash browns, and an omelet. The interesting part was that the hash brown was the tastiest of the three -- it was the star of the dish. Maybe that's why they placed it in the middle. The omelet was normal, as were the pancakes. These hash browns were special. It was a triangle block, not the traditional diner style ones. I am a big fan of crispy, crunchy hash browns fried in butter. These though were kind of mushy and thick, almost cake like. That didn't matter. They were delicious!

The french toast ham sandwich was a first for me. Never have I had french toast as the bread of a sandwich. Open faced, all of the ingredients sat on top of the french toast. The sweet and salty aspect of the dish had be wanting more. I am not a fan of the crust on french toast, so I liked that they cut that part off. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham with melted Swiss on top was great together. And of course, this dish came with a side of hash browns too. Score!

Nothing beats breakfast outside in Vegas adjacent to the pool at the Wynn. The Wynn in Vegas is beautiful -- Props to Steve Wynn. It might be one of my favorites properties.

i think my bf put it best when he called it an over-priced denny's. it's ridiculous when you consider the overpriced thai beef salad was $17. the next day we dined at mon ami gabi in paris and the salmon salad there was also $17. they were like night and day in comparison of taste and quality.

It was too undercooked in the middle.  The pancakes were tasty but a little too heavy.  Our friend ordered a blueberry muffin with his breakfast and he said it was not as good as Marie Callendar's muffins.

We had also eaten at the Wynn buffet on this trip and for $5 more than Terrace Pointe you can eat at the buffet which is the same high quality food but obviously all you want of a big selection.",4XjLQWDGPAUelvz0A7_PzA,0,0,3,bb81V7Q6kzyyNV0jRSumnA

Staff and patrons were all dressed almost too clean for this Seattleite, but it was easy to shrug off because we were at the Wynn, after all. The friendly hostess was quick to greet us on a Tuesday around noon, promising to find us seats, but we were led outside after we spotted our friends.

We had a view of the pool and people were swimming, etc. while we were having brunch. I'll admit, it was a tad bit awkward. But who knows, we're probably the awkward ones brunching at their pool. Since we were outside, there were quite a few birds - mid-meal, one actually flew through the space between our table and the umbrella. I particularly appreciated the mist spraying out of the umbrellas, but the misting seemed to stop as our meal progressed and the heat intensified.

Onto food & drink! We ordered the Terrace Pointe Sunrise (sourish) & the Key Lime Pie Smoothie (sweetish). Both were on point and I'm very interested to try other drink items.

I was ecstatic that there was a Benedict trio on the menu - I didn't have to make a commitment to just one Benedict! On the side, we ordered both the skillet potatoes (very thick-cut potato chips) and hash browns (cube of shredded potato that was fried on top & bottom), which came out before the rest of our meal. Though the portions were sizable, neither potato sides were very crispy. I also can't say the classic or turkey-avo Benedicts were very memorable either. However, I would come back for the crab Benedict - I thought the crab cake was made perfectly and the combination of poached egg & spinach worked really well with it.",sruCbBdbumTjoVRcs8scQA,0,0,3,q2xCMka4a8cIdapVAQo7Mw
4836687,2018-02-15,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"Eating brunch by the pool at the Terrace Poine Cafe is one of my favorite things to do when in Vegas.

I have gone here a few times and each time the food has stayed consistently good. Of course there are a few dishes that are better than others but the main dishes are all pretty good.

In the few times I have been here, I have ordered the Benedict Trio, Crispy Fried Chicken & Waffles, Mimosas and Key Lime Smoothie.

Lets start with the drinks. The Key Lime Smoothie with Avacado in it is super creamy and smooth. This is probably one of my favorites from their menu. iirc it is one the server recommended to us. I have ordered this multiple visits and it is always consistent. If you do not like key lime, do not order it, that is another strong flavor you get when sipping. 

Unlimited Sparkling Cocktails is a little bit on the expensive side, but then again, we are in vegas so nothing to be surprised about. They do not skimp you on the alcohol on these and they can definitely get you feeling tipsy. Each has a good flavor but if you would rather save some money than splurge, probably go for one of the Juice Bar menu items. Plus, you may need energy for those pool parties :)

Crispy Fried Chicken & Waffles, I am not much of a waffle fan besides taking instagram photos of them but I do get temped to order them when chicken is in the mix. The Crispy Fried Chicken is my favorite part of this dish. It is seasoned well and it is not dry. I hate eating dry chicken, especially if it is served at a restaurant. You will not be disappointed eating this if you like Chicken and Waffles on the regular. The only downside is the price.

Benedict Trio, this was a little disappointing because I was expecting much more from it. The flavor is okay but I would recommend other things on the menu over this one. If you are a sucker for Benedicts like me, then you probably will eventually end up ordering this. Maybe share it with a friend so you can try other things? It is only okay in my opinion, and ""only okay"" isn't really worth the price in my opinion.

For sides, we tried the Applewood Smoked Bacon, Hash Browns and Skillet Potatoes. Nothing I would recommend here, stick to the main dishes.",ayS7bmka-G8nmf0yaS3bBg,0,0,5,QJo0NmRF3eaNFJWbdMqlNA

Wow.  I was just super impressed by the super crunchy crispy fried Gardein ""chicken"" and by the just-the-right-amount of crispness and puffiness of the scallion waffle.  And the two together? Heaven.  At $20 it probably should be, amirite? but totes worth it. 

The BF got vegan French toast, which was good; but meh- I've never really gone gaga for French toast.  The Gardein sausage was also super good (serving = two large patties, $4).  The homefries ($4) were tasty but a little cold and hard.

Rivaling my astounding entree was the VEGAN brownie brulee banana split.  W. T. F. ?? Imagine caramelized bananas with housemade chocolate vegan ice cream, caramel sauce and crispy rice crunchy bits all over a decadent brownie.  Now tell me you don't have a tummy boner for that?!  This is the kind of dessert that  could end relationships if someone takes more than their share; but fortunately, the BF knows his place.

After ordering her food are bottomless Mimosas were now empty and sat that way for another 20 minutes making the whole point of bottomless mimosas pointless.

Originally my sister and I were going to go to the Wynn for the breakfast buffet but we found out it was the Saturday brunch and not a regular buffet, so I remembered about Terrace Pointe and we headed there. Actually a lot of people ended up venturing over to Terrace Pointe because of the non-buffet. 

From the time we walked into the restaurant to the time we sat at our table was about 10 min. which was great. The ambiance is nice, quaint and very ""Wynn"". The menu was short and sweet - pancakes, waffles, fruit, pastries, etc. I ordered the strawberry belgian waffle, my sister got pancakes. My waffle was great! So delicious - crispy, flavorful, the strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream was yummy. My sister's pancakes were huge, she couldn't even finish them. 

The only minus is it took a good while for our food to come.  Luckily we weren't starving, because if we were I would have been a lil ticked off at having to wait so long.

Three out of four in our group had eggs, all prepared over-easy or sunny-side-up.  One egg came out with a broken, cooked egg yolk so we asked if they could provide another egg over-easy.  You'd think they'd catch this before bringing the food out.  They brought out two new eggs but the egg whites were way under-cooked - completely disgusting.  

I had the Eggs Benedict.  They just weren't good at all.  Pretty tasteless.

We had eaten here once before and had a great meal, but I don't think we'll be returning.  Breakfast, in my opinion, is one of the easiest meals to not screw up, especially with a simple egg order.

That being said, at $25 per person or so for an entree and some coffee I'd like it to taste at least as good as OPH or IHOP!

I started with a large mocha. It was weak, had hardly any mocha flavor, and definitely not worth the $6 or $7 they charge. 

My husband and I shared a waffle and the french toast sandwich. The waffle was very blah. I really like the waffles at Waffle House, Roscoe's, and Bouchon to name a few. I think making a yummy waffle is possible - they don't all have to taste mediocre. These were just above eggos.

The french toast sandwich was a sloppy mess of awful. it was just eggs, meat and french toast thrown on a plate and no attempt to make a sandwich was visible. Each component was bad individually and when eaten in conjunction with one another. I was wishing for a McGriddle as I was downing this thing. Yup, that bad.

With a choice to sit inside or outside with a view of the pool, the wait for our group was not that long, especially since the guys in our group didn't feel like wearing shirts with sleeves. The indoor dining room requires that guys have sleeves, if you don't, they will just sit you outside under one of the giant umbrellas on the patio. 

There were 5 of us and we ordered various delicious breakfast/ brunch things like the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Omelet with truffle, pancakes and the favorite, Steak and Eggs. My portion of (original) Eggs Benedict was so large, I was able to take some back to my room to enjoy later. Our waitress was really friendly and made great suggestions if we were in between choices. Overall, our brunch was pretty quiet because we were so busy chomping on our delicious meal. Needless to say, we all left feeling pretty satisfied!

We decided to splurge a little...retract a lot!! We headed to Terrace Pointe Café inside the Wynn or is it Encore. Heck I always get the two confused.

I think the first thing I noticed that needs to be changed is the hostess and waitresses outfits. C'mon Mr. Wynn what were you thinking when you put these beautiful ladies in ""1960 Airplane Stewardess"" outfits that are twice their size. It's like going into grandma's closet. No good!!

But on the good side, the décor of this place is quite soothing with a view of their outside pool and if you prefer to eat outside you can.

Now let's get to the food. If I can RECOMMEND anything, I would suggest the VEGAN CHICK'N and WAFFLES|$20. The added spiced maple syrup and scallions inside the waffle batter...sets them apart from any old chicken and waffle.

We also order the following...

VEGAN PAIN DE MIE FRENCH TOAST|$15...Holy heck why can't all restaurants serve this. They dip the toast in a banana soy milk, top with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar. It's like breakfast dessert, yuumm!!! I want it now. If you prefer sweet or savory breakfast order this!!

Side Order-Breakfast Potatoes|$4 and Gardein Breakfast Sausage|$4...I would suggest you pass on these sides. The potatoes were soggy rather than crispy. The sausage was good, nothing spectacular

Dessert-Organic Vegan Blackberry Tart|$8...was not a huge fan of this dessert, I'm not a huge fan of eating desserts that have seeds.

This was definitely the way to end our last morning in Vegas. I hope my honey had a great birthday getaway!!

But when the hostess handed me the special vegan/vegetarian menu, I was like a kid in the candy store and couldn't make a decision.

The Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip is heaven! Pure savory, creamy, delicious heaven! The cashew cream gives it its creamy texture and awesomeness. Perfect for dipping pita chips. It's dishes like this that make me wonder why the ""normal"" version of this dip needs to contain dairy at all because this dip kicks ass! http://bit.ly/YP3BkI

For my entrée I decided to get the Vegan Chick'n and Waffles. Yeah, you heard me right...VEGAN Chick'n and Waffles. They used two pieces of Gardein chick'n breast which was fried crispy. The scallion waffle was savory. You get one large circular waffle cut into quarter pieces. Fluffy on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside. It came with a side of vegan butter.

On the suggestion of a fellow yelper, I tried the vegetarian chick'n and waffles. WOW! So yummy! The scallion waffles went so well with the savory chick'n deep fried in a really nice crispy crust. It also came with spicy maple syrup. The whole dish was great, but it was missing some vegetarian gravy, that would have brought it over the edge. 

Boyfriend had an omelet, it was good.

They have the best Steak and Eggs, always cooked to perfection. With that said, I was really looking forward to brunch at this cafe, I thought it would be as good if not better.  I was to be proved wrong.

My friends dish was bad too, though I can't remember what she got.  We were virtually ignored after we got our food.  The only saving grace was the french onion soup my friend shared with me.

5395204,2014-01-25,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"This place is full of shit. A group of 5 including myself came around 11am to grab some lunch since our arrival in vegas. The venue itself is quite pretty but it was ridiculously crowded and there was a line where we waited about 30 minutes first, and then another 20 to be seated outdoors. When we were given a choice to be seated immediately indoors we decided to wait and have a couple mimosas at the bar. 

Peggy at the bar around Jan 18th Saturday noonish was a horribly unprofessional and sullen bartender. She first off messed up an order and brought over an extra mimosa which I didn't argue with and just paid for despite her just apparently ordering drinks for customers. When I gave her my credit card to charge, It went through and I signed, and then about 5 minutes later she comes back to me and asks for my card back so she can swipe it again. I asked why since I've already got the receipt, gave her her tip and signed for the previous transaction. She gave me this bullshit murmur of an excuse and said it didn't go through blabhlah and aggressively took it from me and swiped again, I asked for the receipt again since I didn't keep the first one and checked with her I wouldn't be charged again. It's been over a week since she's run my card twice on one drink and both charges are up on my credit card. Also, the mimosa was seriously less than mediocre, gave me a headache with whatever cheap champagne and concentrate orange juice they've used, and it was $10 each. It's fine though, worth it to pay $20 for a shitty mimosa so I can learn my lesson to never ever come back here again and discourage others from having a shit experience. 

Aside from this issue, this place ridiculously overpriced their low quality food items. I ordered a $16 truffle omelette, and it was a sloppy, greasy mess, an omelette from Denny's or IHOP would have been better and half the price. My bf ordered the truffle burger which was $18 and that was also a mediocre burger, not even worth mentioning or recommending to others. Our friends also ordered other items and the one who ordered the vegetarian burger that was really cheap and came with fries and a chocolate milk shake really got crappy food. Like, the burger was lower in quality than one from Mcdonalds or Burger King. I shit you not, they used like worse bread than they use at a horrible fast food chain which is just unbelievable.

The service was also just meh, as our server was extremely busy and pretty inattentive. It took FOREVER to pay for our meal because she wouldn't come back to return the credit cards. 

The terrace was right by the pool and that was ok, they have some really loud imported birds and they are forward as fuck. Watch for them swooping in your face to grab food off your fork. They were also extremely loud and high pitched to the point of being distracting and annoying. They cafe also failed with the shading issue, my bf and I had a sunburn from eating lunch, because they took forever with every step of the process and secondly due to insufficient umbrellas up near the tables.

She never came back to update us or apologize but 5 minutes later our soups and appetizer come out. As I begin eating my soup a guy comes to refill our waters and knocks my soup over. He did not apologize, wiped the table and took the spilled soup bowl and rushes away, never returning to offer another bowl or apologize?

We had dessert, and when the bill came, it was over $100.00.  For lunch!!  But I guess it was expected because nothing at the Wynn is cheap.  None the less, It was a nice lunch with a girlfriend.",dRaLq9sF45RYHhKfUd8NMg,0,0,3,xnTehCntJ5u3SEgd6UjddQ

5606790,2008-09-10,1,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"Terrace Point Cafe inside the Wynn Hotel

First of all what a fabulicious luxurious hotel!  Steve Wynn got the classy swank pimping down- even the air smells better at the Wynn!

Ok back to the review for Terrace Point Cafe...I gave it a 3 star but it's not really that bad it's like a 3.75 star worthy.   I just had reasons that I couldn't give it a 4 or 5...here's why:

The decor inside the cafe is like opulence on opium....like a dreamy tea party with bright colors and beautiful shapes.  The booths are like sitting on clouds and the view of the outdoor is soothing.

The waitress Nancy was ""super"" nice.  I quote ""super"" because she was extremely overly glare-in-your-face friendly which bit us in the ass (explain later).

Ordered:  

French Onion Soup (cheesy and yummy you can't go wrong with cheese, bread and onions).

Chicken Quesadillas with sour cream, salsa and guacamole...it was tasty and fulfilling (you get 5 large slices).  I asked for hot sauce and they brought me Tabasco when I really wanted Tapatio but of course the Wynn wouldn't carry such brand *BoOooo*

They have KILLER FRENCH FRIES here!  Crispy thin seasoned fries that is crunchy good!  Interesting that it was the FRIES that impressed me out of everything.

Stay Away From:  Prime Rib Cheesesteak Sandwich with mushrooms and onions...NASTY DRY BLAND disappointment!  The meat tasted like they washed away all the seasoning with water.  It was sad.  I was a sad sad girl.  How do you mess up such an easy dish!  

That's not the worst part.  Our waitress came to our table afterwards and asked if we wanted a to-go box which we politely declined.  She then asked innocently, ""Are you sure?  You have a 1/2 a sandwich left!  Didn't you enjoy your meal?""  We told her that the sandwich was dry and bland and asked if they usually serve it with au ju sauce...Do you know what she said?!?!

""Oh yea...out of all the dishes we have that is like the worst dish to get.  I had it before and it was dry and not good.  I wouldn't recommend it.""

First reaction:  What the hell!?  Why didn't she tell us that when we ordered it!?!?  I think being nice is cool but be honest with your customer!  She basically rubbed it in our faces and at a classy place such as the Wynn Cafe it would've been great to have the sandwich either re-made or taken off the bill...that would've bought my review to a 4 star (lol).

Second reaction:  WOw...so this wasn't just a bad day for the Philly sandwich but it's ALWAYS this bland!  Even the staff recognized it as a BAD SANDWICH!  I expected more from the Wynn.  The chef should be alerted immediately and he/she should either pull it off the menu or season that bitch!

*sigh*

I'm sorry but I hate it when good restaurants serve bad food...

If you want a burger or appetizers go here for a leisurely meal but the total bill comes out to almost the same price for the Wynn Buffet so if you want to experience a good meal at the Wynn hit up the buffet instead!

The first morning I was in Vegas, my sister and I had a delicious breakfast at Terrace Pointe Cafe. I had a vegan french toast with a side of vegan butter, maple syrup and strawberries. I also had an amazing soy latte. My sister ordered the regular french toast which was rolled in cereal and topped with candied pecans and a grilled banana. She said it tasted amazing! The waitress even asked if I had any food allergies. I explained that my vegan lifestyle was based on compassion vs allergies but was still so thrilled that she asked. My sister did not give the question much thought but when her food came with an unexpected slice of strawberry on the top (to which she is VERY allergic) they took the plate away immediately and made her a fresh batch strawberry free. We were just blown away by how helpful and accommodating they were to both of us. We also got to watch birds out by their pool/garden. It was peaceful and beautiful. We both asked for to-go containers and she brought me more vegan butter and syrup to take with me. Awesome! The next time I visit with my husband I plan to try more of their restaurants! I am sure I will be very pleased. All you vegans visiting Las Vegas, please be sure you support these restaurants and review them! We have full vegan menus at the south end and the north end of the Strip so we need to fill the gap!!",yZ4dinTJrI3XdtTv_vBYLw,1,1,5,xZmobgLbqhYHF3V94N9PNg

Not here.  This place was horrid.  

Lets begin with the 2 airheaded hostesses who stood there for 5 minutes and talked to each other while we waited to be seated.  Ok, I understand that they've got a whole complicated system going of how to seat people, but they at least could have told us how long it was going to be rather than ignoring us.

The real trouble began when we finally sat at our table.  10 minutes after we had decided what we were ordering and closed our menus to give the signal, I had to flag down one of the bussers to notify whoever our server was so we could order.   Well, he must have forgotton because it took another 5 for our waitress to come.  The restaurant was not busy at this time (3:30pm), mind you.  Yes, we hadn't even been greeted yet.  We didn't even have water.  Again people: a FIVE star hotel we're talking about here.

After ordering, we had to ask for bread 3 times...we had to send one soup back because it was the wrong one...just to send the correct soup back because it tasted so poor...they forgot my friends mojito...and I had to get up and walk to another table to steal some extra silverware because I couldn't flag down anyone who worked there.  Our busser, John, was the only one who seemed to have it together, but he was really busy holding the place down since everyone else wasn't helping.

In the end, we actually asked John if he could send a manager over so we could complain because our experience was so bad, and she ended up comping the entire meal after hearing about all of the inconsistencies and disappointments.  I would feel guilty about this at an independent restaurant, but c'mon.  This is the WYNN we're talking about!  They should have every aspect of the way they run their ANYTHING down to an art by now.  No excuse.  And, this was a TREND at the Wynn.  Very disappointed with the Wynn's service...not just here but also at Okada and Red as well.  Even the convenience store's service was whack!

There should've been some nice greens in the salad, I would've paid more $$ for that. The higher quality, dark leafy greens -- all 4 sprigs of 'em -- were sitting as optional toppings on the edge of our Kobe burger plate.

We were seated outside...because the gentleman was wearing shorts.  I mean, Vegas, in August...shorts are pretty much standard.  But they will only let you sit outside unless you're wearing a tuxedo.  Or maybe just long pants.  Anyways, it was fine, view of the pool, and all the creepy-ass-birds, like from Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"" staring you down.  Or literally drinking water out of the water pitcher that the busboys fill up the guests water glasses with.  We saw.  We gave the heads up that the birds had been drinking from it.  I hope they changed the water.

I had a RAD meal.  First we got the Truffle Fries, which were doused in this amazing, creamy, decadent savory truffle sauce.  Not like most places where they just sprinkle some truffle oil on the fries and toss some parmesan on top.  This was amazing.  Like gain 5lbs by looking at it, amazing.

I got the Shrimp Crab and Lobster Club sandwich.  Again, off the charts.  I was stuffed, I could only eat one of the 4 pieces.  But thankfully we left Vegas at like 12:30, the worst time ever to leave, and got back to Oceanside 9 hours later.  Epic timing on our part.  So I had the rest of it in the car later.  It was still amazing then.  I got the green salad with the vinaigrette.  Good, not earth shattering but good.

The fool that wore SHORTS to brunch in August, in Vegas...he got the TPC Burger.  It will light a fire inside your soul.  

I got the endless champagne package, with Bellinis.  Our server was super attentive and made sure I had enough booze.  She checked if we had any food allergies, and was very all-around great.  

I took away a star for the damn birds.  They're super irritating, there's bird shit here and there, they eat scraps, they drink the water from the pitcher your water might be from, they are fucking LOUD too.

Outside of a bit of a  wait while they setup a table for our group of 7, we all came out thinking that this was one of our most pleasurable dining experiences.

Everyone in our group was very satisfied with our food(though we all selected heavier non-cafe fare).  Each dish had excellent attention to detail, especially with garnish(for example the fish and chips came in fake newspaper with silly articles on them).  I personally had the salmon and the french onion soup, both of which were fantastic.

Our waitress(Jamie) deserves special mention.  She was very personable, quoted movies with us, and would add witty commentary at opportune moments(plus she put up with our occasionally rambunctious behavior).  She catered to our every need, from those that we requested(asking for faster pacing due to time constraints) and those that we didn't request(bringing out extra sticks of rock candy when one member of our party obsessing over them after seeing someone else get one with the coffee).",Hn_xBMS8ODbX7RHRtvkeOA,0,0,5,wEDcJtNgFKWauUkEZnwy8g

The Wynn has proven to be among one of the best places in Vegas for vegans to enjoy both fine and casual dining at one of its many restaurants, Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn did not disappoint.  My first recommendation is to request outdoor seating on the patio, how relaxing!  Once seated, request the vegan menu if you're vegan, there are several options for you.  I began my meal with the most amazing appetizer I've had veganized in my life, the spinach artichoke dip - oh how I've missed this dip!  I would say that the dip alone is worth 5 stars and had I known how amazing it was I would have ordered two (and...um...possibly three...it's OK to be a little piggy on vacation, right???) in lieu of an entree.  Then came my much anticipated vegan burger, fries, and milkshake.  I think I mostly enjoyed the novelty of it more than anything, I mean it's pretty rare to get a vegan burger, fries, AND a milkshake anywhere - it even came in a box reminiscent of a fast-food meal.  But overall, I felt the burger was a little boring, it wouldn't hurt if they updated it as I'm sure one of their fancy-pants chefs could come up with something unique/interesting.  The milkshake was made with coconut milk and would have been better off having been made with soy or almond milk as the coconut flavor was overpowering.  So as far as the burger and fries, I don't regret ordering the entree as I enjoyed the novelty of it, however I wouldn't order it again unless they update the burger.  Overall we had a great time, great atmosphere, and pretty fantastic spinach and artichoke dip!",4iOc4Fo-h6gZ-2zAJEM78g,5,4,4,xgxcwAxb4-g72Vbc0YrZCQ
5931395,2010-06-11,0,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"Apparently, this place is as casual as it gets at the Wynn.  Saying that, I had a good experience.  My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Friday, and we were seated outdoors.   The ambience was very relaxing, and we got to enjoy the beautiful decor and scenery by the pool.  The food was very fresh and flavorful, and the portion was large.  I nearly died trying to finish my linguine with clams, and I'm a buffet kind of girl.   If you're eating dinner right before going out dancing, I suggest sharing with one other person.  The only downside our dinner was our waiter - he was a cheesy comedian wanna-be that dissappeared half the night.   Overall, this place had great food at great price and great ambience.  I'd totally come back.",kW3TmZZ0zTln1vVIRPvY7g,0,0,4,LnFWTquSsL1X-ILjg3Vxfg

The prices were reasonable for what I received, service was organized and courteous and timely.  I enjoyed waffles and espressos, my wife had a chicken & waffle entree, and everything was excellent.  I would surely re-visit this restaurant for breakfast, perhaps lunch- but there are many options in the area of course- so its hard to choose.  Anyways- give it a shot for breakfast if you are every staying at the Wynn.",fES_Ws1CDBUw7vcTJzr8CA,0,0,4,NDpUDpPdAVPRRXMuDkeQ3w

Because it was just okay. Sitting outside was a mistake. The pool view is beautiful, but the glare isn't. I had a grilled vegetable pita thing. It wasn't super good, and eating in the heat isn't enjoyable if the food isn't hella good. Oh wells.",JEZteM6zMpOUYyaeTZloXg,0,0,2,Z9tL4ckKJodz9SCweJxKVQ

We love drinking coffee (we've had our fair share of tasting different types) and the coffee was spot on. We ordered the crab Benedict and it was deliciously scrumptious. The potatoes that came with it was just the right crunchy and soft. My husband almost didn't want to share. I had the corned beef hash and it was done just right. Just be careful of the skillet it comes out with because it's hot! We enjoyed our brunch and would likely to come back again.",WBR6c7NhtCMtmpBBEHE7kg,0,0,5,eYKVaMMJI8tv1absO1QAUA

5959474,2015-03-20,4,f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,"I had visited Terrace Point Cafe a few years ago, but hadn't been back since. We arrived on a Sunday for a late breakfast. We were seated quickly and we asked for both a breakfast and a lunch menu to peruse. 

My fella and I decided to share two entrees, the porchetta panini and the egg benedict trio, which include a pork belly, crab cake and traditional. 

Service was pleasant and attentive and portions were surprisingly generous. We had quite a lot left over to take home with us, despite stuffing our faces to capacity. 

Everything was very good and despite the high price point for what is essentially cafe food, the quality and portions make it a decent deal for the strip, especially at a property like Wynn.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,10,4,PgKcmdPfj-ewlBzqc1emZQ

The Ranchero Tofu Scramble is my other go to breakfast.  It's delicious and seriously seems like an egg skillet dish!  

It is a little pricy for breakfast, but it is Vegas and at Wynn.  Totally worth it though, you won't be disappointed.

TIP: Go early for breakfast.  They get busy quick and don't take reservations.",5jZCm98_09LCqJL7WULqgg,2,2,5,iOO7isXjeR9Z5b8S1SeybQ

Francisco makes our dining experience amazing every time, we actually ask to be seated at his side. My uncle was raving about him and now I see why, he is so nice and helpful! He even brought my pancake later to keep it warm when my waitress said they couldn't. He needs a promotion like yesterday! He is a great asset to the restaurant. 
The food is amazing as well, anything we ordered came out amazing, and the potatoes are to die for! Good thing Vegas is only a 4 hr drive for us.",T1n2f62Ktzqcfk3Wy0IlpQ,0,0,5,Krb_ASyFyekFuXkXQPw9vA
