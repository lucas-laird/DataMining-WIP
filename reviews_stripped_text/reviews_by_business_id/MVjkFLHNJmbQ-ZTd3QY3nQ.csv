The pabellon arepa is huge lots of flavor and worth the price. The cachapa is a corn pancake with cheese. Very interesting flavor tangy and sweet. The passion fruit juice hit the spot.

First of all: these guys are not hard to find.
Why not? Because if you look at their FB page it tells you exactly where they are going to be that day. Not hard.

Seriously that first time I tried them I tracked them Downtown and the arepa was sooo fresh and yummy that the bread had just been baked. Yes I was there at 10:30am waiting :)
It was sooo good that Tuesday morning that I took hubby to the Farmers Market at Town Center that night around 5pm and yep I got another one also. Still full from that morning and due to the size, I could only eat half, what a sin! 

Super sweet customer service. They asked me how I knew about them and after I told them they said Amanda M. is an amazingly nice customer. 

So far I have tried their passion fruit juice and their mango juice. Both are of course good but SUPER DUPER sweet, too sweet for me. I'm not a fan but you should try it yourself. They are def yummy. 

I get only the #4 and never get tired of it. Warning this item is big, if you are not starving you might as well bring a friend to share it or cut it in half and try to save it for later? It's such a good deal at $6 wow.

The cucumber yummy sauce is super good (the sando does not need the sauce) I dip chips in it sometimes. The red sauce is not my fav. I'm not a fan of chipotle or anything ""smoky"" tasting. Try it yourself you might like it.

There is not much else to say other than:
If you have not tried this place out...seriously you are missing out. I think it helped make my life a little more complete!
Thanks Amanda!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,6,5,BrUVsHJi2nSRuyf_5M-o1Q

For my first visit to this new location, I tried the chicken and sausage combo of the La Surena and it didn't disappoint: a hot packed pocket with creamy avocado slices, spicy sausage, and shredded chicken, which I smothered in their cilantro and spicy sauces. But because I'm a total glutton, I had to add on a beef empanada, which was also damn delicious.

I chose to order the #1 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado, Peas and mayo.  That one is served cold like a chicken salad.  I followed that with a Passion Fruit juice.

2235926,2013-06-01,2,MVjkFLHNJmbQ-ZTd3QY3nQ,"Rica, deliciosa, sabrosa... just a few fitting words to describe the arepas at Rika Arepa Express! I tracked down this Venezuelan food truck at the Downtown 3rd Farmers Market on Friday and I was instantly impressed by the prompt, friendly service and flavors of the food that I tried. Thank you to my good friend Christie O. for spotting this truck at another local farmers market and mentioning it in a quick tip!

The picture menu featuring 9 filled arepas is easy to navigate. Each one costs $4.00 or $4.50. I ordered the Domino for myself and Reina Pepiada (creamy chicken and avocado salad) to bring home to my husband, and a passion fruit juice to drink. The addition of perfect, creamy avocado slices for $1 made the Domino even better, named after the contrast of the white mozzarella cheese and savory black beans. I could eat a whole bowl of the black beans; they are seasoned just the way I like them, with lots of cumin, and not overwhelmed by any other flavor. After my first bite, I remembered the red and green sauce included with my order and poured them over my following bites. I especially enjoyed the creamy cilantro sauce with its fresh herb flavor. The parchita (passion fruit juice) was great, though my cup contained more ice than I would have liked. I really enjoyed my meal on the patio outside the former bus terminal that now houses the DT3 Farmers Market.

I can't comment on the meats here, as you couldn't even pay me to eat a steak cooked by Gordon Ramsay himself. However, my husband approved of his Reina Pepiada. Look for Rika Arepa Express at First Friday and StrEATs this month-- I think it will be love at first bite when you taste their ¡sazón!

This place is delicious. I ordered the shredded beef arepa and the chicken/sausage arepa. Both were delicious. Served hot and with a side of fried plantains. The chicken/sausage was my favorite. The arepa itself is slightly crispy on the outside which makes it a perfect little pocket for all those delicious fillings they put in there. 
I have not been to the ""other"" arepa spot in town, but I've had Rika three times and can honestly say I frequently look at their calendar in hopes that they will be near me.

Staff was really nice and took care of me rather quickly. There was only one person there when I arrived. I ended up ordering the vegan option arepa which consisted of black beans, avocado, & sweet plantains and my kids ordered a grilled chicken & cheese arepa. My order literally took forever. I must have waited 30 minutes to receive my order. The lady even forgot to give me my drinks, I had to go back up to the counter to get them. 

When I finally received my order my food was good but nothing special. I was expecting a lot more flavor especially in the beans. Even the green sauce was a bit bland. My kids had the chicken arepa. We asked them for only chicken & cheese because my kids are picky. When we received it, there were greens inside and I had to pick them out. Also it was super greasy. There was hot grease leaking from the bottom. My kids couldn't finish it. I had no idea grilled chicken contained so much grease. 

Im not sure if it was just a bad day for them or this is how it normally is, but I think people should give this place a try and see if they have a different experience.

I wasn't really sure what an arepa was, but food trucks more often than not hit the spot. However, now that I know what an arepa is, and how well Rika Arepa Express makes them, they can go ahead and park on my driveway. For Free. Seriously.

I think they've changed the menu items up, or at least the order of them, based on other pictures and reviews here, because I could have sworn I had a #1, but it was shredded beef with plantains, black beans, and cheese. And I did NOT regret my choice. So good. I think what makes these arepas are the plantains, so I highly suggest to pick one with that in it.

The lady taking orders felt bad because of how long the food was taking so she gave us a free order of the breadsticks with the cheese in the middle. They were good but still, the service was slow.

Grilled chicken, mozzarella cheese, fresh greens and a chimi churri sauce. It was a good 20 minute wait and I was getting inpatient. The long wait was due to the fact that the couple in front of us ordered about 8 to go. The other reason is they grill the chicken to order.

4052866,2014-01-30,3,MVjkFLHNJmbQ-ZTd3QY3nQ,"Where have I've been?  Why did it take me so long to have arepas?  These are just a few questions that I had to ask myself after I had my first bite of their Pabellon.  A few weeks ago was my first time to try Rika Arepa Express and also my first time to have arepas.  Because I have no comparison, Rika Arepa Express is as good as it gets. 

So what's the big deal?  Lets start with the size of their Arepas. Their Pabellon (shredded beef, black beans, cheese, and plantains) is ginormous. The Pabellon is packed with about 3 oz of perfectly seasoned and shredded beef. There is no way you will be disappointed with this one if you're a carnivore like me.  Stuff black beans, the cheese, and plantains and it's a match made in heaven.  Although all of this is good on its own, it's Rika's arepas that makes this meal a big deal.  The arepas is a flat bread made of corn and served warm with a little crunch to it.  My goodness...I couldn't wait to come back.  I didn't wait too long for round 2 and came back a few weeks later.  This time I had their Pollo Asado (chicken, mozzarella, and their Rika Chimi-churri sauce).  The Pollo Asado was pretty good, but I thought it needed more meat.  My opinion, the Pabellon was better.  Lesson learned...I will stick with what I like.

Tip To Self:  I love how their arepas are warm and crispy. I may even ask if they can keep it grilled a little longer for some extra crunch.

Yep, Rika Arepa Express has now settled into a stationary home. They're in a very nondescript plaza on Flamingo near Sandhill. This is great! Not only have I always longed for more Venezuelan food options ever since trying out the original Rika Arepa Express truck, but this side of town (especially this section of Flamingo) has been sorely lacking for non-chain food in general ever since I've been here.

Prices are a bit higher than I recall, but the Pabellón ($8.50) is still as enjoyable as it was when I last tried their tent (in other words, still not the same as the old truck). It came out quickly and was piping hot. The arepa dough is almost sturdy enough to hold all the fillings to the end, and the combo of shredded beef, black beans, plantains, and mozzarella is a classic. The cilantro sauce and mild chipotle sauce aren't show-stealing but should be used generously to maximize satisfaction.

I would've been satiated with the arepa alone, but I had to add on a couple of sides for scientific purposes. The Tequeño ($1 each) is a dough-wrapped stick of non-stringy, semi-crumbly-yet-soft cheese, and it's the superior choice. The Empanada ($3.50) comes with beef, chicken (my choice), or cheese filling, but none of that is too relevant because the dough is too thick, too gummy inside, and not flavorful on its own or even with the aforementioned sauces. It's far worse than my favorite local Venezuelan empanada, which comes from a food truck that's still in operation.

I'm glad that Rika Arepa Express is now regularly available in this particular neighborhood, even if it's not quite as good as the original. The arepa is a fast, hearty meal, and this place is the only option that comes to mind if I don't feel like visiting one of my favorite Thai restaurants. I'll either try the La Sureña arepa (chicken, smoked sausage) or perhaps a plate next time.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,8,4,55R2E2HWzxxV5-8m7kLGww

Their stand was nicely set up with two clear menu boards on each side of the front table. All of the arepa options were listed with all of the included ingredients to help make your choice. Most of the arepas are $8.50. There is also an option to turn it into a combo that would include sweet plantains and passion fruit juice for about $12. Pricing seems reasonable for the quality and portions.

The #1 arepa was calling my name. The arepa itself was tender and delicious. The inside was stuffed with black beans, plantains, shredded beef, and mozzarella. The rika sauce was also delicious and the icing on the cake. Each individual ingredient was very tasty and the flavors were great together as well. I tried the passion fruit juice and that was very refreshing. It had the perfect amount of sweetness.

I ordered twice, once for myself to enjoy on the spot and later to take one home to my husband. Both times the wait was just over five minutes. The woman taking orders advised me of this before I paid so it wasn't a big deal.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,3,4,M2oOdOhDGF2sgFM2u3a1Zw

4571190,2013-09-21,1,MVjkFLHNJmbQ-ZTd3QY3nQ,"Thanks to Amanda M. for leading me to this delicious truck.  I ordered 2 arepas to try: the vegan and the pabellano.

The cashier actually let me try a sample since I was a first-timer.  I got to try a sizeable hunk of a chicken arepa.  The vegan has black beans, sweet plantains and avocado.  The pabellano has shredded beef, sweet plantains, black beans and cheese.  I love avocado and plantains, so I had to get these 2.

My basket of arepas came with a spicy red salsa and a creamy cilantro sauce.  I liked both, but the red one was perfect with both arepas.  I liked both sauces on the pabellano.  The pabellano was so warm, with tangy meat mixing with sweet plantain - the beans and cheese rounded out the dish.  This one I will probably get every time, should Rika Arepa Express not always be on the opposite side of town.

The vegan was creamy with the avocado and had a ton of beans.  Once again, plantains made it!  This probably was the first time I had avocado and plantain flavors mixing together, but it worked.  The prices were very reasonable ($5 for vegan and $6 for pabellano).  Some of the arepas are $4ish, but I of course picked the specials (see my pic of specials on menu).  Overall, yummy and filling.

4673517,2017-09-21,1,MVjkFLHNJmbQ-ZTd3QY3nQ,"I have been looking for a good Venezuelan restaurant in Vegas for a while now so I was delighted when I heard Rika Arepa Express was opening up a location. The first thing I noticed and really liked about the restaurant was the bright colors and pictures of different places in Venezuela. Upon walking in, I was eagerly greeted by the friendly cashier. She was very helpful in explaining things on the menu and letting me try items I was unfamiliar with. I had a hard time choosing because everything looked so appetizing. I finally decided on getting the number 1 (the Pabellon). I do not exaggerate when I say that I was transported to a different dimension. The flavor was so incredibly rich and I could taste the quality of every single ingredient. To top it off, both of the sauces were so delicious I could literally drink them. The actual arepa was incredibly soft and warm, and the combination of shredded beef and sweet plantains is to die for. I have since tried everything on the menu and every arepa is equally as mouthwatering. The tequenos and empanadas are fried to perfection and are especially good with the heavenly sauces. 

Overall I had a wonderful experience! They have great service and even better food!! It's by far the best in town and a must have when coming to Vegas!",D2v0XAXc4W-iB0MLeEf63w,1,0,5,23YTuXHqQ_Xd1YePScluRw
4702251,2014-01-20,2,MVjkFLHNJmbQ-ZTd3QY3nQ,"Dining with Rika was my first official arepa experience. When I heard they were set up at First Friday while I was there, I knew that was going to be my food destination for the evening and fortunately, it was close. My friend and I were reading the menu as we approached the truck and were offered a sample of their popular Reina Pepiada Arepa while deciding. Well, we didn't have to look much further because it was delicious and it reeled both of us in. I was initially weary of the cold filling, but that was quickly pushed aside by its wonderful flavors. It had the standard shredded chicken breast, avocado, green peas, mayonnaise, and parsley. There was also a bottle of creamy green sauce to accompany your arepas and it was really great, however, there was no way to take it with you (it would have been nice to have it throughout the arepa and not just in the beginning). We really enjoyed the arepas and it was deceivingly filling! So, if you see their truck at an event, make sure you stop by.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,2,2,4,Nn9CuLnEdt_9nG0J-fpKog
4848198,2013-04-05,4,MVjkFLHNJmbQ-ZTd3QY3nQ,"This is the first time I've seen the Rika Arepa Express food truck near my work place and I couldn't find any reviews on yelp, so i'm assuming they are new. Anyway, I googled the name and found their website, where you can find pictures of their products. I was looking toward to munch on some empanadas for lunch but they didn't have any. They told me that they only have empanadas on special occasions. If that is the case, they should have noted on their website about it and when is the heck they consider ""special occasion"" !!! Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that they charged tax separately on the products (other food trucks I dealt with usually included tax in their price already), so I ended up with so much coins in my pockets and the time they sort out coins make wait time longer.

Now that I got the anger out of my system, let's talk about the food. Since I couldn't order the empanadas because it's not ""special occasion"", I ended up ordered a #3 (stewed pork) and #4 (stew shredded beef) arepas. I didn't have high expecation and was just hoping that it's close to the arepas I tried at Viva Las Arepas on Las Vegas Blvd. I was floored when I took the first few bites. Damn, the arepas were good and actually much better than the one at Viva Las Arepas. The bun itself was fresh and not over-oily like the one over at Viva Las Arepas. The pork and beef meats were flavorful, juicy, and not salty like the other place. 

Overall, I love it and will definitely come back here for arepas. The price is not bad either. The pork arepa is $3.50 + tax, and the beef arepa is $4 + tax. Here is the memo to R.A.E owners, have tax included in the price and round it up to like $4 for pork arepa and $4.50 for beef. Also try to include empanadas in your menu if you have it listed on your website. Ohh, another thing, if you don't take credit card, don't have it listed on your website either. A co-worker of mine had to run to the nearby ATM and pay ATM fee just to get some cash to pay for it when he was told they don't take credit card even though their website said they do take it.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,7,7,4,Zaq39R8jfyIYAqanpw4Qqg

Shredded beef stew. Super tender and juicy beef. Cilantro sauce works great. 5/5 

Pabellano:
Beans, fried plantains, cheese and shredded beef. It's like the Carne Guisada arepa but packs a meaner punch and has more good stuff. I love fried plantains so I had to get this. You get that sweet, slightly caramelized banana...oh my. The best arepa!!! 5/5
