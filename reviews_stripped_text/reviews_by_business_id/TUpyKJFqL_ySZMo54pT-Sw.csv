610113,2015-09-24,0,TUpyKJFqL_ySZMo54pT-Sw,"HIS: The chamango and elote en vaso are what we come here for. (Thats Mango with chamoy sorbet & corn in a cup for us white people haha). The chamango is made to order and every time they chop the mango right in front of us which we love. The elotes is pre-cooked and scooped into a cup for you but that doesn't take away from the taste! I think it's even better than the corn on a stick. Don't go here for a nice sit down or amazing service. This is a stop and go kinda place but worth the stop every time.

HERS: So, I think something my baby forgot to mention was how much I blew his mind and taste buds away when I brought him here. I'm Mexican and I grew up eating this food. This place sells the most authentic and delicious treats I used to enjoy growing up. All the desserts are amazing. From the ice cream to the corn. Like mentioned, we come here for the corn and chamango. If you want something fresh and more ""healthy"" I'd get the chamango which is freshly cut chunks of sweet mango with a chamoy sorbet and drizzled with more chamoy. For those of you who may not know what chamoy is, it's a sweet and spicy red sauce that elevates the taste of fruit to a whole other level. Your life will transform  when you try this, it's not over powering spicy. It's just the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. The corn in the cup is corn that has been cooked with some peppers and water then is put inside a cup and topped with mayo, cheese, and spicy powdered chile. All of the topping are optional but the way they make it is amazing. You can also ask them to put a little of each if its something you're not too sure you'd like. But I promise you won't me disappointed. I have not tried their food options, honestly, because it is a dessert place I don't know how comfortable I feel about having their food. This is a place you have to try if you want to taste a little bit of Mexican heaven.",e8oeYxi0oy2hFVccVcy-KA,1,0,5,CsTA3rlIYBxeHhZuz1kQYQ

This place is the real deal. All their ice cream flavors are rich, complex, and utterly realistic. 
Most of the ice cream names are in Spanish.
They let you try before you buy.
My favorite flavors are Chongos (idk what kind of tasty magic they put in it, but I'm under its spell), and the orange one. Don't remember what it's called but it's the orange one that doesn't taste fruity. I'm sure if you ask for that description they'll know what you mean.
They also have rose flavored ice cream, with little bits of petals in it. Tastes just like they smell...rosey.

I love sampling the unique flavors. The ice cream is the perfect style of creamy texture and flavor. The staff are friendly but not all speak fluent English so getting translation of ingredients can be little tricky sometimes. There is frequently a line but generally it goes quickly. The food is ok but I would recommend going next door to Mama Marias if you want dinner and eating here for dessert! I would give the ice cream five stars, I took off due to cleanliness and food. The floors are frequently dirty and they generally can't keep up with cleaning the tables on busy nights. Both are due to heavy traffic.

Of the two items we got, the Titanic Hot Dog was the better one with bacon, onions, avocado, and sour cream. I'd probably get this again.The Tlayuda had good taste, but the tortilla had a stale texture instead of a nice crunch I was expecting.

We usually get some pop-sickles to go and bring them home for another day. There Mexican pastry pop-sickle is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough.

My friends had the Tostilocos and loved it, but I'm not a fan of pickled pork.  I tried another friend's Cemita sandwich filled with carne asada, avocado, and melty cheese in a toasted sesame bun.  Their son had the $2 nachos and a Mexican Coke and was happy.

There were easily 50 people who came through while I sat in the corner with my laptop for a couple hours - mostly Mexican families getting ice cream and shaved ice.  It's out of the way for me, but I'll swing by any time I'm in the Northeast.",Hj2bC9FUrj2NbCn2noproQ,7,6,5,_M45zjl74tsZHK2gpZ74SQ

5123822,2013-04-22,0,TUpyKJFqL_ySZMo54pT-Sw,One of the most amazing places I've ever been to. Home made/artisinal style ice cream made with fresh ingredients. Their fresh aguas are made daily. A true hidden gem.,AQ0NRRasg_FA403S5gKEDA,1,0,5,U_hulhXcty0BZsiUf-b78g

Either they run out of mangos,corn,chips it's always something & while one person is helping costumers the rest of the girls are just standing around. Worst place to come too!",8Bke_AqP-0J4GJN5dIwAXQ,1,0,1,Mz1GZ_OV1Ugv8kPcbRSbEg

Had 2 scoops of the strawberry cheesecake ice cream and it was probably better than thrifty's, actually. Superbly surprised with the quality and taste of the ice cream here. Well worth the 3-4$ I spent.",zdB9A1QHk_f-ikkdvIQnXA,0,0,5,4NsYQeSRwaNPNnb_CtayzA

My daughetr loves the chamango and I love their pupusas and drinks especially the alfalfa and strawberry and cream one.  They have icecreams such as Rose flavored, gansito, tamarindo and many others.  Anyting here is good.",PMeX0tMMrL55EmZBB7nXPQ,0,0,5,TMMWRYKrOov8r9ou7qPfwA

Tonight I got two scoops of ice cream, Rose petal and eggnog! The rose petal smelled like roses, was pink and had small bits of rose petals! Small bites was really good but big bites, was slightly soapy tasting. 

The egg nog was very good! Small raisins and had a rich creamy taste, would get this one again. 

Very easy menu order by site or if you read spanish, but if not staff very good at helping you understand whats what!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,0z-Xe5xL-XgkqePG0iwCxg

Although, it can get really busy most times I'm here and they seem to be under staffed.

I've been there when the line gets so long, people just give up and leave.

It doesn't help that their ice cream & aqua frescas are NOT labeled.

I really think this place is great for locals. Maybe just poor management?",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,1,2,3,yG6zVPyvo4zMCWv_6KmTzA

Huge mango chunks, ice cream, chile and a hungry fiend like myself, make a good mix. This place has a lot of seating space so you can enjoy your treats and jam to Hispanic music at the same time. Prices aren't bad by any means and I leave this place satisfied.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,9,9,4,BB9-PHigSqkm3VKPEriilQ
