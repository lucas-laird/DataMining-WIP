31155,2015-05-13,0,T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ,Worst customer service ever.  Went in a paid for dinner Thomas the rude behaved employee working the register said upon walking to table that I need to come back to the register because of confusion?  I had no idea what the he'll he was talking about.  It was about 45 minutes till closing.  I followed him back to register he pointed at another customer an asked if I was with him?  I said no I came in alone gave you a $20 got change an was being seated or so I thought.  He starts telling the other guy that he owes more money then proceeds to shake me down.  I have never heard of such a thing in this country.  I demand my money back an ask to speak to the owner or manager cause this assclown Thomas is trying to extort money from me.  Thomas the assclown says owner not here an no manager.  I have gone to this buffet several time before an never been extorted this is clearly something Thomas has started to make some extra cash.  I will never return and I intend to share my bad experience with everyone.  Horrible horrible way to treat customers.  If the owner ever reads this please get in touch with me your employee Thomas is stealing from your customers.,i1zH7hGJs_accdfjEzrwUQ,2,0,1,usCJxV61Z3YxaPt6gh3-jQ

This is a major disappointment! First we were shocked by the high price: price of lunch is equal to dinner! Except for sweet & sour chicken & apple pie, everything is at best luke warm! Most of the desserts are not fresh, chocolate cakes are really dry! Compare to the other Chinese buffets here in town like Jumbo Buffet, China Star, & Buffet Asia, this has fewer selection & worse service!",BZEO4bFp_yG34pxrruaFlA,0,0,1,rM3JxO-LwUNs-eaEMAy2ow

Anyway, the peel and eat shrimp wasn't bad, the sushi fish wasn't terrible either, but I thought it was weird that they just had straight up cut fish as opposed to sashimi. The tom yum wasn't bad, but I've had better. It tasted like this one was made with chicken stock which is... Odd. The orange chicken was okay, but again I've had better. The crab legs cracked open easily, but most pieces didn't have any flavor as if they'd been frozen too long. The muscles were fishy. The clams were PACKED with sand. The oysters were the nastiest I've ever had. None of the flavors in them were positive. I didn't get to try the hibachi station so I can't speak for that. But hey, I didn't get food poisoning! And you get what you pay for.

This review got two stars because the service was pretty awful. I didn't really see the waitress after she set down our drinks and we had to hunt her done for a refill. But hey, if you can hunt the waiters down the beers are only $2!

1025348,2015-02-20,0,T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ,"My wife & I tried this place after seeing an advertisement with a coupon for 20% off.  It's quite a distance from where we live, but we made the drive for their lunch buffet.  When you walk in the door you go up to the counter and pay.  When we presented the coupon the lady said ""This isn't ours"".  We told her, ""It says Hibachi Grill on the coupon"".  Another employee looked at it and said it was right, so we received the discount. After getting another coupon from a publication we took two relatives to their dinner buffet.  This time we presented the complete advertisement that included the coupon to hopefully prevent the same situation from happening again. This time the lady said, ""This coupon is expired!""  We said it's not.  She looked at it again and said, ""Oh OK it's the last day"" and grudgingly gave us the discount.  Unbelievable!!  Why send out coupons or advertise if you're going to argue with customers when they try to use them?  After both of these discussions we were sick to our stomachs before we got to the buffet line. We made a trip to the Men & Women bathrooms to wash our hands before eating. That was another adventure.  Both bathrooms were dirty with toilet paper & paper towels scattered everywhere. Granted a lot of it is from the customers being messy, but they need to do a better job of cleaning them. The only reasons this place is pulling out a 3 Star review is the food variety & taste, price (which included drinks), prompt/polite waiter, and the décor/atmosphere. They need to do a better job of cleaning up spills on the buffet line & changing the serving spoons/tongs.  This is especially true in the dessert area where the tongs looked pretty gross.  You could see pieces of the different desserts on the ends of the tongs from people grabbing different items. We felt like we were getting three or four desserts in one.

I crave sushi and crab legs often they are my favorite so we thought this place was cool for budget friendly seafood. for both of us to eat here cost about as much as one of us at our regular ayce sushi place or strip buffet with crab legs. that's why we came back today. I got off work at 3 and we went for an early dinner. we left hungry and I honestly wish I could have my money back. I feel like I threw it away. I never want my money back for anything, but I am not satisfied at all. the sushi wax ok, they have a pretty good selection. they had a fried roll, but it was really hard from sitting under the heat lamps. it's ok  sushi I guess. think grocery store California roll. I've seen fancier rolls at albertsons though for sure. the drab legs were out for most of our time there, and they disapeared in seconds after being put out. they did have oysters, I don't eat oysters but they have them. and fried soft she'll crab, I think and craw fish and lots of Chinese food. I finally did get crab legs but I swear some of them were empty. I dunno how that happens or what that's about, but there was very very little meat in them. it's all this work and mess with the cracking and everything for just the tiniest bit of meat. maybe I'm being too harsh with the one star I have for them right now....... maybe ill make it 2 stars. I'm just so unsatisfied and it bums me out. I don't understand how at 8:30ish  almost closing time was better then 4pm and they have people, like prime time. their bathrooms are awesome, like they look cool. I took so e pics I'll post later. . I'll give them 2 stars cuz the first time made me come back. this time made me never come back lol. I mean, they have food, it didn't kill me ( although I don't feel very great, a lil quesy) they have all sorts of seafood things. there's just too much competition. my bookmark list is a mile long so I can't see coming back to a place that I don't love. I wanna be excited about a restaurant, I don't wanna eat at just any old place that's cheap. like I love the buffet at bellagio. LOVE IT!!!  yes, it's  more expensive and we don't get to go there often, but I crave  it and when I am there I enjoy myself and I can't wait to come back. this place does not do that to me.",cVHtZVFWksqKy2nAgAwm_w,1,0,2,c_iAdwzRSr9GOwEhHulPug

So I wonder if that has something to do with consistency. They served SASHIMI on the line. I do not think I have ever seen that at a buffet before. Also they had a spicy shrimp soup that hubby LOVED. There was so much to try, I ate mostly sushi. I didn't have any desserts, try the grill, or the salad bar. Hubby ate 6 plates of food. And the owner came over to ask if we wanted anything else before they started cleaning.

I am telling everyone I know! Glad we got the opening coupon in the mail. Well worth $30 for 3 people for dinner. Hubby wants to try lunch tomorrow, so we shall see if it's the same quality.",A56LwaBHeC61nwZQEP6dnA,1,0,4,JPHgpGKRhV66QYxSiyqrYA

A lot of the food didn't have much flavor, some of it was cold, and the sushi was all almost the same just made differently. The deserts were ok, same as all Chinese food buffets.

Upon arriving, it seemed like a pretty clean place unlike a lot of buffets near our home. There's even a soothing little man made pond/fountain to the right once you walk in. The decor was pleasant on the eyes. 

It's pretty cheap price. We came on a Sunday for dinner which was roughly about 14$. It seemed pretty busy but got seated right away. I was surprised by how much food they had. They even had crab legs and crawfish that night! For the price of 14$ you can get AYCE crabs? I think that's quite a steal. 

I rated this place 2 stars because unfortunately the crabs was all that was appealing to me. The other foods all seemed bland and no flavor. The food looked like it was sitting there for a bit. The sushi I tried was all rice no fish in it.. And I'm not exaggerating, there literally was NO fish in it! One sushi I tried tasted like the fish they used was canned tuna.. YES, canned tuna! There was a place where you can pick veggies you wanted and the chef would satay it for you which I thought was pretty cool. 

My water didn't get refilled not once while I was there. The empty plates did get picked up right away. We only saw our server once and that was to bring out our waters. It's a buffet so I never expect to see the server a lot BUT at least check on our waters or see how we're doing.

Probably won't be returning. I think my mom liked the place. Unfortunately I wish I can say the same for my myself, but I can't.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,5,1,2,T3kUlGzhfyh_GidyTaAGwA

We were told at the cashier's desk that there is more food at dinner time. We arrived at about 3:30 PM and lunch ends at 3:45 PM, so we were just in time for lunch. Thank goodness, since I can't eat that much anyway, so it would be a moot point for me to have even more food in the buffet lines (there are 6 food lines jam packed with delights). 

Lunch is $9.24 and dinner is $13.85 -- and I would say that it is well worth the price considering the amounts and variety of foods provided. They even have a self-serve yogurt area and a special section for desserts. There's a special area for sushi and hibachi selections but I really was much too stuffed to try anything from that area. It doesn't take much to fill me up, so buffets always make money on me.

Everything I tried was so very delicious and if I had more room, I would have eaten more (not! don't want to gain too much!)

SCORE! I didn't walk in expecting huge, great quality crab, which is why it's easier to give this place the higher rating. 

Even though I no longer live on the east side of Vegas, when a new food place pops up in my ol' hood, it sparks my interest. Somewhat hidden on the corner of Nellis and Stewart is The Hibachi Grill, and in an area of horrible Asian buffets, this place actually makes the cut! 

Now first off, this is more of a buffet, with a grill station. With that being said, DO NOT SKIP THE GRILL STATION!! As a matter of fact, remember to bring a few extra singles so you can tip your grill master. It reminded me of a Mongolian stir fry. Add your raw ingredients, hand to chef, wait for chef to cook, and eat! This was personally my favorite area of the buffet. I had a nice skillet with more veggies than meat, just how I like it. 

The buffet looked like a minimum of 50 items. This included sushi, shrimp in multiple forms, HOT crab legs, rice, noodles, a few Asian specialties, and even some chicken nuggets and fries for those picky kids. Overall, there wasn't anything that stood out amazing, and the salmon is very much skip-able. But, on that note, I could get full, on decent food, some fresh some canned, and be satisfied with my meal, as well as the price I paid for it. I am pretty sure every buffet has some of those items you pass on, and here I may pass on more than others. However there was enough good to make a return trip. 

If you are seeking gourmet, go elsewhere. If you are seeking a decent price plate of shrimp or crab that you can bring the whole fam to, this is your place. A little something of everything.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,9,8,4,11CEnn6f1LX3jy76nB-Biw

Easy to feed the kid, too - I just walk with him around and put on his plate all what he like - tomatoes, tuna salad, shrimps, pizza, meatballs on the stick, brownies, chocolate mousse, tangerine pieces and pineapple tidbits, and, of course, frozen yoghurt... (:

First the good:  There is a Mongolian grill that will cook what you pick out to eat without extra charge, they do have a tip jar.  They have a Sushi section with a large selection of good freshly made Sushi to choose from.  They have a large selection of soup, Asian dishes, Kung Pao, Jalapeno Chicken, Broccoli Chicken, Gen. Tao's Chicken  are some of my favorite.  They also have Fish,  baked and fried, Peel and eat  Shrimp,  and other dishes containing shrimp, Crawfish, Chicken wings, Pizza, Asian Vegetables, French fries and many other dishes too numerous to list.  They have a large fruit section with Watermelon, Honeydew melon, oranges, pears among other selections.  They also have deserts  with cake cookies,  chocolate fountain with strawberries, ice cream, and yogurt.  Hibachi has many more selections to choose to eat which I haven't listed, you just have to see for yourself.  I have never had a problem with being seated immediately, as it is a large place.  The servers do their best removing dirty dishes and I have never had a problem with my drink being refilled.  There is a dollar discount for seniors, and regular price is a little over $10,  and a discount for kids.  The negative things that I've found at Hibachi are, some of the food like the Chicken wings seem to be reheated from the day before and are not fresh.  Some serving trays are overheated and the food is dry.  Sometimes the trays are not hot enough.  At times they are slow to bring out fresh food, but I think this could be blamed on customer flow and what they take and do not take to eat.  In the past, I would find plates and silverware with food stuck to them, but there has been a noticeable improvement in that area.  The place could use a cleaning, I see smudges on the glass partition separating tables.  As you can see I have listed some pros and cons of Hibachi Grill and I want to be fair as I think with a few improvements, this could be a really good place that's affordable.  I recommend giving them a try and leave any constructive criticism to make it a better place.  One other thing, it's located on the Northwest corner of Nellis and Stewart, North of CiCi's Pizza in the Nellis Plaza.

The selection is vast, the only downfall is that they don't keep their items refilled, so people will stand and wait until the crab, or the oysters on the 1/2 shell are put out, then take what was brought. I find it rude, but when you don't keep the bins stocked, that is what happens. 

The wait staff usually comes by a few times to refresh the drinks, but don't go expecting better service than you get a the other place. I always remind my family that is a cheap buffet.",ofFEjZRYcEWDsaff4qrJVg,0,0,3,apZohf6sJYuvdW--xYd-fw
4393786,2017-07-09,3,T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ,"Calling for boycott. 

I would give NO Stars if that was an option. 

I would encourage everyone to boycott this restaurant! 

Here is the reason for my personal boycott:

The Hibachi Grill Supreme Buffet claims to give you a FREE buffet for every 9th visit to their restaurant. 

Don't believe them they are using the following trick to avoid giving the repeat customers their promised free meal. 

Here is what they do:

They hand out a separate card with one stamp, per visit. If, you do not bring the same card on every visit they will tell you, the 8 stamps, proving your visits, are invalid and you will be denied your promised FREE buffet. 

I asked for the manager and got no satisfaction, then I asked for their boss and was told he is not here.... 

Then, I ask for the bosses phone number and she said she doesn't know it. 

Finally I ask for the owners phone number, she claimed she doesn't know who owns the restaurant. 

Does this sound like they care about your feedback? 

So it boils down to this.... 

This company would rather lose a regular customer than to honor their word and bond to their customers. 

For this reason, I would like to ask you to boycott the restaurant, until the management begins to appreciate their customers. 

Honesty is the best policy. 

I will not return to this restaurant again. 

I hope you find this review helpful.",BkidByf5jyDAy1oN2U4qyA,3,0,1,qjl5KkU0TkfopNqixNw0Xg

My favorite things to get include the hot crabs, oysters, sashimi, baked mussels, and grilled items. They also have a Mongolian Grill where you stack your plate with items you want (vegetables, meat, noodles, egg, etc), give it to the cook, and presto-freshly cooked noodles! It's especially good when you add garlic & chili paste at the end! 

The staff is also very attentive, they're always quick to take empty plates from the table, refill drinks, and lately I've noticed they do their best to quickly refill the crab legs and oysters (since people have been taking 'em by the platefuls). 

Also sashimi quality has gotten a lot better!  They offer mackerel, salmon, tuna, and one other fish (I don't know the name of, but it's delicious!) I've tried them all during multiple visits and so far haven't had problems with my tums, so the fish is good by my book! 

They also offer two aisles of desserts, 4 different soups, salt & pepper crab, seafood delight, chicken, pizza, and a whole bunch of other typical Chinese buffet dishes. 

If you're looking for a cheap Chinese buffet that offers crab legs, oysters, and a Mongolian grill, this is the place to go!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,15,14,4,NwWQ-X4EjQnbZiEDJ09HOw

Boy were we DISAPPOINTED!!  The Hibachi grill a good assortment of meat and veggies but SERIOUSLY lacking in seasoning options.  The cook used water to Stem the food and threw some soy sauce on it but it was very bland!!! Tried the different soups, lack of seasoning.  The coconut shrimp and cream cheese wont tons were sickening sweet.  The teriyaki chicken was very bland.  Numerous dishes lack any seasoning and taste!

The rest of the food on the buffet is really bland and doesn't really have flavor. The sushi bar is also okay, but I wish they had a bigger selection of sushi, most of the sushi is the same roll, but with different sauce on it. Also the sushi tastes frozen and pretty bland also. The Thai tea is good, but it is also way sweeter than most Thai teas I've had. So you can't drink a lot of it. I am giving this place 2 stars only because the hibachi grill is really good, you can choose what type of meats,vegetables, and sauces that you want, and they cook it fresh. The chocolate fountain is a good idea, but I would definitely not use chocolate from there due to the fact that I saw a whole bunch of little kids sticking their fingers and hands in there. They also only have strawberries, marshmallows, and pineapple to dip in the chocolate fountain. There should be a bigger selection of fruit for the chocolate fountain.

Only a couple things that might be some issues.
Your sushi bar area is not bad however it becomes warm in can be a problem. 
Sashimi was warm as well.  Which is not a good thing and ruined it.
The yogurt ice cream isn't very good, super sweet and runny.

The seafood they offer needs work the snow crab legs were very cheap looking and not that fresh because how you can tell its fresh is once you start opening them they still snap on the shells these crab legs were very soft and spongy and very little meat. the fried crab was better but it was cold. One thing i did enjoy was the space here as compared to other buffets it doesnt feel cramped and i appreciate that. 
When you have a buffet make sure the food is hot because people like fresh food not something that has been sitting for about 10-15 min before you bring it out. Some cool things that they did have were dim sum and sushi which were ok and the dessert here was a big selection of it from fruiot to yogurt to cookies and cake.
For about $13 its a solid cheap buffet so you get your moneys worth but dont expect me to come back to this for i rather go to buffet @ Asia for the quality and for $2 more.",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,3,1,2,_6ItUMQGo3D0ygLzshw_UQ

5661258,2014-04-12,3,T_vPBF3WRyHoNXrr86ZhkQ,"The Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet was awesome! My family and I came here for dinner on a Friday night during Lent looking for seafood options. Boy, did they deliver! For about $14 per person, you are offered a great variety of seafood and meat options. They offer a military discount too, which is great! The place is huge. There are sushi, hibachi, regular entree, and dessert sections - lots and LOTS of food. 

I started out by trying the sushi. There were about 10-15 different options of nigiri, rolls, and sashimi. It was all good, but obviously not fresh. The rice was too dried out in my opinion.

I then tried their clam chowder. Delicious! There were lots of good pieces of clam and potato in the soup, it didn't taste canned at all, like I would have expected. Definitely try this if you like clam chowder.

Their salted pepper shrimp was okay. It could have used more salt. The  baked salmon was alright as well, I think even though it was sitting in some milky liquid, it still was rather dry.

I'm not a big fan of fresh oysters, but I tried theirs and I was actually impressed. My mom, who is a big fan, loved them and said they tasted nice and fresh.

The star of the buffet for me were the snow crab legs. They are offered warm and steamed. The legs have lots of meat and the meat is good and sweet! I ate two plates, haha. I was definitely satisfied with those!

Of the desserts, I tried the banana, tapioca, and chocolate puddings. All tasty. I also tried the cake roll and mocha cake. The cake roll was dry and the mocha cake had a lot of frosting, so I ate them together, which was a perfect combo, lol. They offered a few fruit options, I only tried the watermelon - good. Their sesame balls were good! Fresh and chewy, but no red bean paste inside, just straight mochi. My brother tried the frozen yogurt and said it was nice and creamy.

I am really impressed with this place. The area doesn't have a lot of other great dining options, so this place is a breath of fresh area for this side of town. I definitely recommend this place over Buffet at Asia and The Golden Corral.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,8,5,4,_u6GnDZXfMVyhrO-ZHG9dA

When asked for refills, the lady had an attitude like she was gonna DO something nasty to your drink. Another good side note for this place I guess is the oranges. They were fresh. I would suggest coming during the first opening hours of this place, by dinner time most of the food looks like a pack of hungry people ravaged the place and left you with what ever was left. The bathrooms are something else. It's not healthy for people to eat then use the restroom to find it all torn up and not maintained. That was disgusting!
