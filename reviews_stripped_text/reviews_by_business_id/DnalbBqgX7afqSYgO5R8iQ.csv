For me, personally, service is the most important thing you can offer...and this lady was NOT offering good service. Also, when I tell my hometown CPK to ""make my food spicy"", they actually take the effort to do so. These guys just put whole red peppers in it....I mean...even a baby could've done that.

Today I sat at the bar on my hour lunch break from work and Emmy waiter was aj at the bar
You would think that placing your order right when you sit down would cut some time, but I guess that did the opposite, 20 minutes had passed and I still hadn't received any bread like I asked for which was ""being baked in the oven"" but because I was seated at the bar I could see that there was nothing but pizzas being made in the oven,
20 more minutes had passed and my food and the food of the guest that I was with was still nowhere to be found
So I ask aj to make the order to go because at this point I have to start making my way back to work so I'm not late, 
I was than told that cheese was accidentally put on my order which I asked for without so they would take only a few more minutes to make,
I could see the cook in the back proceed to remove the asparagus and spinach and tomato with cheese off of the top of my pasta and put fresh vegetables on top of it, and was than handed to me. I told them I can't eat this because cheese had already touched my order and I picked up my things and got out of there as fast as I could, because why would ANYONE give business to a company that doesn't respect food sensitivity or dietary needs!

The kitchen sent out  2 orders of Chicken Tequila Lime Fettuccini with pasta so poorly cooked that it was hard, clumpy, and a little crunchy. We sent it back because an $18.75 plate of pasta should be cooked correctly. We waited an extra 20 minutes for a new plate. We spoke to the manager who brought out the new plates to us, however not once did he check in with us to see how everything was. The second plate wasn't much better than the first. The service was sub-par, and management wasn't concerned.

As always, CPK is good and I havent had a bad pizza yet. On this visit, I had the Jerk Pizza without onions and peppers, and it was great. Price was a little high, but again it was in the Mirage. Everyone else was satisfied with the food.

The server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done. There was no half off or other comp for the mistake. The other issue was is that I paid for everyones pizza with my CC, and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it.

The hostess was super rude, she was almost shouting ""HOW MANY"" when we entered, no hello no smile. I surely don't expect much but being polite is part of her job. The place filled up pretty quick and since we had the table by the entrance we had people so close to our table waiting that it was truly uncomfortable to eat while starring at other people's butts. They have to change this system for sure. There were probably only 3 waiters for this whole place and they worked hard and tried to be as fast as possible to serve all their tables. Meanwhile the manager was literally walking in circles (the restaurant is shaped like one) so he was making his rounds whthout helping his struggling staff, stopping by the hostesses table to check his phone a few times and keep on walking. I'm not sure if he doesnt know what his actual job is as a manager but it drove me crazy because I work in hospitality and only a good manager keeps a restaurant great, I just felt really sorry for all the servers...

My pizza was pretty self explanatory with various amounts of ingredients and was well made. My boyfriend's Jambalaya was pretty delicious as well, has the perfect amount of shrimp and chicken included and very well flavored.

I can't remember what time it was exactly, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table so it wasn't too bad. It was busy when we went, and it seemed like they were pretty much always busy, regardless of the time.

We actually had CPK twice. Once, we dined in and the other my boyfriend ordered and brought back to our room for a late night dinner when I didn't feel like getting out of my PJ's. Both times, we got the Garlic Cheese Focaccia as an appetizer and it was pretty dang good. The first time, we got the Tostada Pizza with chicken added and it was actually really good. Really crispy crust and the salsa they put on the side is legit.

The second time, we got the Meat Cravers which was just alright. I usually like to have some kind of vegetables on my pizza, and my boyfriend says no way. So I usually have to side with him, as I did in this case. It wasn't terrible, just not my cup of tea.

I think this is definitely a legit option if you're staying at the Mirage or someplace close by. The prices aren't terrible, but you have to remember that any restaurant in a hotel is going to be more pricey than those outside the hotels. This place isn't too bad considering the amount of food that you get. The service also stays on par with most other restaurants, and the food is pretty good.

Two of my buddies ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and I had ordered a Pepporoni Pizza and my other buddy ordered a Pepporoni Supremo. When our orders had come out, the portions didn't look too big for the amount they cost. But once we all took a bite of out of our pizzas, we thought it was worth every penny. The BBQ chicken pizza didn't sound like a good idea to me, but once I took a slice, it bursted with flavor. My pepporoni pizza was just perfect and the pepporoni supremo was even better. It had a few additional seasonings. The crusts were thin and they weren't overly greasy. The service was perfect and we loved every moment of our visit!

We arrived after 3:00 and got seated immediately.  We ordered a few pints of beer and got 3 pizzas total.  The three of us planned to split two pizzas but got a third because it was still ""happy hour"".  We got a chicken and garlic pizza and a california chicken type pizza with avocado.

We both ordered cocktails and both thought they were extremely strong. Some people may like being served extra alcohol in their drinks but I could barely taste the mixers. It was like drinking straight vodka.

They told me that our server wasn't the one who brought the waters to the table and were just told by the hostess that she would be with us in a few minutes. In fact, another server named Alberto was kind enough to keep refilling our waters throughout our meal. A for Alberto or A for awesome? ""A few minutes"" turned into almost 20 and our server finally came back to our table. She didn't even introduce herself or seem very friendly. To top it off, I felt rushed when she was taking our order. She was just overall not very personable. Our order came to the table in a decent amount of time, but we also had to ask for our complimentary bread that I'm assuming was supposed to be served upon arrival to the table. Hmmm... Maybe not? After our order arrived, we had only seen our server once throughout our meal. The last time we saw her was when she dropped the check off at the table!

1) I never go when there is a wait so it's always a breeze to get in and get out.

2) I often get hungry when I am in the sports book and, if you sit at the back bar of CPK, they have TVs so you can watch sports and eat at the same time.

3) The people are nice at the back bar and they will chat with you as you dine, but not in an annoying way.

4) If I just want a salad and maybe a cup of soup, this is a great option because CPK does overall have pretty consistently good salads (I love the Cobb).

5) It's easy and it's a lower-priced option than other places around.  Not that it's cheap but sometimes I just don't feel like getting up for a big fancy meal so I just go here.

Other members of our traveling group had never experienced CPK, so we ended up giving this one a shot. Sorry for the pun, but it was worth the gamble.

While waiting in line for seating, I changed my mood and looked forward to the meal, wanting to order my favorite CPK meal, Chicken Milanese. Sadly, when I finally got a chance to open my menu, there was no Chicken Milanese listed! The California Pizza Kitchen website lists the dish as one of its specialties, so this came as a surprise.

I went for my second favorite option (again, not pizza), the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, dressing on the side. I split it with my neighbor, who ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pizza was fine but the chicken in the salad, moist as it was, lacked enough BBQ sauce and thus zing that usually accompanies the crisp, fresh combination of ingredients in this salad. 

My table asked for the sourdough bread to eat while waiting for the food. We got a pathetic hole/airy looking loaf along with some cold butter. We ate it and asked for more - no carb concern here, especially on vacay - and the second serving was better. 

The wait staff took care of our requests with smiles and also refilled our waters and drinks regularly. Nonetheless, the food failed to match up to the standards that other CPK's have accustomed me to.

3063450,2011-02-21,0,DnalbBqgX7afqSYgO5R8iQ,"Me being an avid fan of pizza, I would probably would put this under an OK review.  The place was in the middle of Mirage, some where and of course it was packed.  We were hoping to beat the long lines, but unfortunately the lines were long, no matter how early we went before lunch.  We were there to buy show tickets and wanted to check it out.  I never been to the California Pizza Kitchen before.  So why not.  

The place itself, seem smaller then I expected to be for a Pizza Parlor.  So you got people standing in line, waiting on tables, cause the place was jammed packed.  Not sure how long we waited but a good 30 minutes that went by and didn't really see the front of the line.  But they had staff going around, asking if there was a party of two, which was the wife and I.  Kind of felt bad that we had to pass up those before us.  But we were told that it would be right in front of the bar.  So its not an actual table, its the bar.  The place you actually sit at, to see people pour you a beer right in front of you.  So, not only was it awkward to go before others, but kind of awkward to be sitting next to a beer fountain and eat pizza, especially if your not drinking beer.  Overall, the place is easily crowded and not as roomy, but it probably be nicer, if it was less crowded.  

We had California Pizza Frozen Pizza before, in which I probably would prefer the frozen pizza over the pizza parlor.  The pizza was okay, but seem a bit flatter then the frozen pizza.  Getting a personalize size pizza, is kind of cool, but I wasn't really digging it as much.  It look like, they did take their time cooking it, but it did look like they just threw it all together and toss it in the oven.  Not knowing if the peperoni is sticking together or stacked.  But it was edible, and it did feel me up.

If you do ever get a chance, probably go when its not busy.  Probably get a table that hasn't have some one pouring a glass of beer in front of you every 5 minutes.  Otherwise, your probably better off with the frozen version.   But if I came here in better circumstances, then maybe, I'll like it more.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,0,3,hjEeP0tru4G6h9NISQ9Y0Q

The server may be double-seated, but it was not busy there, in fact, there were only a few tables there that were even seated and they all had their food, so I think it was manageable.  We waited there for about 10 minutes until someone came to greet us.  And then another 10 to get waters.  When she took our order, I didn't feel like she was extremely friendly.

Mr. and I went to lunch here - it was very busy, but we did go at 1:45 p.m. on the first Sunday of the NFL. It's right beside the game/sports room in the Mirage, so it's a fab place to watch the game.

There were no tables available, so the hostess offered us seats at the bar, which offers the full menu too. No prob! We were trying to get fed and get out to the pool as quickly as possible!

We ordered two pizzas, a glass of champagne, and a diet coke. Service was quick and friendly. Space was a'plenty to eat at the bar. Not cramped at all. 

It was cool getting to see the kitchen in action (they do the pizzas out front, where the bar is, and the rest is cooked in the back - read hidden - kitchen) from our seats. We also had full view of the restaurant for people watching, at least six TVs playing 3-4 different sporting events, as well as the wall of the sports book next door (http://www.mirage.com/casino/race-and-sports-book.aspx).

PIZZA RATING SYSTEM GO!

Crust Texture: Thin, but not so thin that it's all crunch - still a good chewy/crisp combo.

Crust Flavor: Starchy-sweet. Not salty or tangy. Good, mild flavour.

Sauce Flavor: Nothing of note. It was there - not particularly tomatoey, not particularly herbal, not particularly sweet or salty.

Sauce Amount: On the minimal side.

Cheese Flavour: YUM! Salty and cheesy - tastes like real cheese as opposed to a lot of cheap pizza places.

Cheese Amount: Generous - very American-style heavy-handed. Next time I would ask for less, but it's not like it made it inedible - I love cheese... just a little on the overkill side of things.

Topping Quality: AWESOME! Fresh, interesting, top quality. Nice!

Topping Amount: Wonderful! Verging on perfect - heavy on the mushrooms, and they were very fresh, with a wide range of types. Well done, CPK!

Presentation: Nothing special - great big plates covered with your pizza! It looks very yummy though - nice and brown on top, bubbly cheese on the perimeter, no pooling oil or grease!

Overall Taste: Better than delivery, not as good as most authentic Italian pizzerias. Better than the other casual joints in The Mirage.",xaCU92mNCFAJ9BdtfoP7dA,1,1,5,pBd2etmdm-uZb0StcueppQ

Makes me sad because I've worked for a CPK for over 9 years now and I'll always come back because of its unique and innovative dishes. Forreals though, the food tastes exactly the same as my own restaurant and gives me the comfort of familiarity while I'm away partying, which is why I even came to eat at a CPK in VEGAS. Service definitely could've been better. The hosts sat my friends and I at a table where it took about five-ish minutes before our server came by to greet us. She informed us that waters were already on its way to us (which was brought to us by a different staff member), didn't make any suggestions from the menu-which is fine, I already knew it like the back of my hand. Server said they'd give us some time and she would return shortly. She took about another 10 minutes to return and we ordered. We didn't get the complimentary bread-I didn't want any but my friends did. Tables that sat around us after got much faster service from our same server with their drinks and bread. Our appetizer Spinach Dip arrived at a timely manner as well as our Waldorf Salad and Spicy Chipotle Pizza. These items were dropped off by another wait staff and they did not ask if we needed anything such as black pepper (for the salad) or parmesan cheese or red chili flakes; we didn't see our server until we were more than half way done with our meal. We finished everything and did not want dessert. We asked for our bill and it took some time for her to bring it to us. 

I'll just say that if you're coming for the food and you're already familiar with it, then come! Just don't expect much from the servers, they aren't very engaging and you might not be properly set up to enjoy your meal.",Se9TrKv9HpKzxRDn_Y15zw,2,2,3,6ydWmsU_pvXyEO0JGuz4Qw

We went here on a Friday night, so it was packed.  We waited for probably 10 minutes for a table.  Good thing is this CPK in the Mirage is located right next to the sports book so we could at least catch the scores.  We finally got a seat and proceeded to order drinks.  Our waiter was friendly and courteous.  We got our complimentary plate of bread (what happened to a basket?  Geez.) of like 3 slices for the 2 of us with some butter.  The bread was already cold, almost as cold as the butter.  I had to schuck it aside.  Boo.

They had a few new pizzas on the menu (the Buffalo Chicken pizza stands out), but I usually stick to my fav, Original BBQ Chicken pizza on Honey Wheat dough.  But I felt different today, I wanted a change.  I couldn't decide between the Thai Chicken Pizza or the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza.  Our waiter suggested the Thai Chicken because it's on of his favorites.  I added Honey Wheat dough to it for my crust.  My fellow diner got the Tostada pizza.  This was his first time here, so the Mexican side of him (he's HAOLE (caucasian guy to you mainlanders)....HA HA) wanted to try this.  

In between waiting for our pizzas we were entertained by lots of people.  Some big, some little, some kids...all of them happy by being out it seems.  Nice to see even in our rough economy families have time to spend with each other.  There was even this ONE guy that came in to dine with 7 chicks!  No joke!  One of the girls was getting hitched I think.  He was the spectacle of the evening.

Our food finally came.  My Thai Chicken pizza looked excellent!  Fresh and bubbly from the Mozzarella cheese.  It tasted just as good too.  The marinated chicken breast went well with the peanut-ginger and sesame sauce on the pizza.  The green onions and cilantro just carried the Asian flavors.  Carrots, bean sprouts and  roasted peanuts gave the pizza some great texture and crunch.  My waiter had made a most excellent suggestion and I was pleased.  The crust was great as well, not too thick, crunchy on the crust, not doughy in the middle, and with a clean, slightly sweet taste from the honey.

My friend said his Tostada pizza was excellent as well.  He liked the grilled lime chicken and the black beans and how it complimented the sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses.  The fresh lettuce and  crispy tortilla strips on the pizza were a welcome and refreshing crunch.  The pizza was supposed to come with herb ranch dressing, but it wasn't apparent on the pizza or on the side.  It was ok, my friend said it didn't need it anyway.  Overall, he was pleased on his first visit to CPK.

This place is not so bad for a quick, little bit cheaper dinner (but not by much) if you have to eat at a sit down joint on the Strip.  Average pizza price is around $12-$13 for one individual pizza.  Come on, pizza...it shouldn't be TOO expensive, even if it's gourmet! 

This place would have gotten 4 stars if my bread came HOT and in a BASKET (I know, strange) and if the prices were a little less stiff.  It might have gotten a 5 star if those 7 chicks came to sit with us instead!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,3,UEAuCLTA5h4uhMEZ7goKog

I had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, since it's always a safe bet. The alfredo sauce was bland and the chicken tasted like it was frozen - dry, chewy, and tasteless. Granted, I'm the kind of woman that prefers chicken breast meat over dark meat, but the chicken was beyond dry! I didn't have much before my stomach started acting up.

If you even have a remotely weak stomach like me, as greasy foods make my stomach churn, you know that the first jab of pain signals a LONG bathroom visit. Halfway through the meal I told my partner that I had to leave and scrammed to the nearest bathroom, which, by the way, was quite far since casino bathrooms are often at opposite ends.

My boyfriend & I had just left our friends at Hakkasan & were trying to find somewhere to eat. There wasn't a lot open late-ish on a Monday night (after EDC) in Vegas but we found this CPK! I tried calling to place our order ahead since it was about an hour from closing- I didn't want the kitchen to close before we got there. When I called someone rudely told me that I had be staying at the Mirage to order for pick-up & then hung up on me. When I got there I discovered our hotel was also covered under their to-go orders... oh well, we were already there. The hostess was extremely nice & told us we could order at the bar. It only got worse from there... the bartender completely ignored us. I tried to ask if I could order & he acted as if he didn't hear and then walked away. I had to get one of the chefs to take the order. The man working behind the bar was rude, unpleasant & by far the most negative attitude I encountered during my week in Vegas. We were sober so it's not like we were being loud, causing a commotion or asking for anything extraordinary. I can understand getting annoyed with someone causing a scene but we were just trying to find a late dinner. So, one star for good food & one star for the super awesome hostess.

Unlike a lot of places at the Mirage, CPK charges the same here as their standalone locations.

They have gluten free salads, appetizers and they can make any pizza gluten free by using a cauliflower crust for a $2.50 add charge. 

The pizzas are great for sharing and pair nicely with a salad or appetizer. We had the bbq pizza $20 since we had cauliflower crust and a large Cobb salad $17. Everything was delicious and filling without feeling gross after.

We were not seated for almost 15 mins at 7:45pm which should be the busiest time, however with so many tables that we could see were clean and available and no reservations taken, this was just weird. 
Finally thanks to a server, we could get a table, as he kept pushing the fellow at the concierge to get us in as many tables were available. Once seated, we decided our menu right away as we were suppose to watch the show on Treasure Island and it was already 8:10 pm now. We were looking at every available server who was running around but not one came for taking our order. Finally after asking the concierge to send someone, we had a server, who took all our order at once and thankfully also asked the cook to accommodate our request of serving faster. We did get the food in 20 mins and since we didn't have much time, had to gulp our food faster.
The penne cream with shrimp was tasty but the Thai crunch salad with chicken was missing something. Couldn't figure out what, as it wasn't tasting the same as it does normally. Nevertheless thanks to the servers who saw our agony and helped us get out of there in an hour.

First off, my friends and his buddies were in town so not my choice of place to eat. So Vegas locals, don't burn me at the stake for eating here. Yes I committed a sin, forgive me.

Like most restaurants at a casino, you feel like you're eating at the casino. If you get the outside booths, you literally will be within 1 feet of customers waiting in line, with no real dividers. Investing in glass dividers to allow for some privacy would help. Luckily, we got one of the inside booths. 

The bread wasn't very good, questionably stale. I usually like the bread at CPK too. If sushi bars can get fresh fish to the desert, CPK should be able to get some non crappy fresh bread.

The four cheese ravioli with sautéed mushroom was just okay. Usually sautéed mushrooms have more flavor, but it was just lacking in the dish. After finishing the dish, I felt that disgusted can't believe I ate that feeling. Just something about the sauce made me feel this way.

My friend's spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce just didn't look very appetizing. He took a couple of bites and stopped.

Food came out fairly quickly, but don't expect to really get the great service of a traditional restaurant. You will have to flag the waiters if you want anything. 

My meal came out to around $16, which for a casino restaurant isn't bad. But had I gone to local spots, I would get better food and value. Not a bad place, but pales in comparison to the real CPK back in California.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,2,3,2,rI1A1GzxB0B9M5Gh91kHkw

Sadly, between the spotty/downright slow service and the fact that both items I ordered were just okay, I doubt I'll be eating at CPK anytime soon (I mean, it's a chain, so one must assume all of their food is generally the same). The biggest problem with both the egg rolls and my pizza was that they were downright bland.

Price-wise, everything was average for Vegas (the egg rolls were something like $13.50 and the pizza was $17.50) but honestly there *are* places on and around the Strip where you can get better food for the same prices or cheaper.

He asked if we were hotel guests and we said 'No'.  He said he hoped we'd consider staying at the Mirage in the future and gave us a food voucher for $60.  Now, that was a surprise since we were not big players and had only played for 15 minutes or so.  Casino comps guests all the time but usually to big players and only if you have played for awhile.  Nevertheless, we gladly accepted the hospitality.  

We decided to give CPK a try.  The wait was horrendous!  We were in line for at least 45 minutes.  Once seated, the service was sooooo slow.  It took forever to get our drinks and for the waitress to take our orders.  Then it took another life time for the food to arrive!  We ordered Spring Rolls (Vietnamese style), Kung Pao Spaghetti with Shrimp & Chicken, and Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine.  I can't remember what we ordered for dessert or if did at all!

We are not big fans of Vietnamese style Spring Rolls.  We actually ordered them by mistake thinking they were Egg Rolls (deep fried).  Duh!  So we only took a bite to taste and didn't care for them.  

I fell IN LOVE with my Kung Pao Spaghetti at first bite.  It was flavorful and spicy.  Who would have thought to cook Kung Pao with Spaghetti noodles?  The peanuts gave the noodle extra kick. My fiance loved his Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine, too.  He even used the bread to pick up any sauce left over on the plate.  Yes I know, it's not proper etiquette, but this is no 5-star restaurant.  

We only ordered iced tea since neither one of us is a drinker.  And I honestly couldn't remember if we ordered any dessert and if we did, what it was!  All I could remember was that we were stuffed and didn't even use up all $60!!!  

We have been back to CPK at different locations since (most often at Brea where it's the closest to home), and we order the same thing every time because that's how much we like them!  I have even learned to make Kung Pao Spaghetti at home and it's a hit with everyone.  Well, I am Chinese, so I'd better know my Kung Pao!

As my daughter paid and picked up the pizza, she asked our server, Jim, for some plates. Jim looked at her quizzically and asked why.  She replied that we wanted to eat in our room.  He returned with 4 plastic lids from take out containers and asked her if she was ""from the bum jungle, you know, outside?""  She was taken aback and restated that we are guests in the hotel simply wanting to eat upstairs.  He shrugged and walked away. Very upset by this exchange, my daughter spoke to the manager who was very unhelpful, simply saying that ""he is usually very nice"".  

Well, understandably that ruined our evening, especially when we found we could have ordered a room service pizza for less, and received all the accompaniments we needed.  I will definitely be forwarding my pictures of the take-out lids/plates given to us for our dining pleasure, but feel you need to be aware of the shoddy customer service provided by your casino restaurant wait staff.  In hindsight, I wish I would have returned the pizza and gone immediately to the Mirage management.

Upon our return home I reported it to the CPK offices, who - unlike the CPK #10 floor manager - acted very quickly to try to rectify this experience.

It has been over a year since we've visited CPK located inside the Mirage. I'm not a huge fan of this particular location because it's hectic most of the time and that almost guarantees a not so spectacular dining experience but we were in the area and pizza was on our minds.

I was pleasantly surprised when we got there at a little after 6 pm, the wait was only about 10 minutes even though the place was abuzz due to the NBA finals. We were seated right in the middle of all the action so excitement was in the air, I didn't even notice that it took them about 15 minutes to take our drink orders. My husband, not a huge basketball fan, decided to entertain himself by timing how long it would take the servers to refill our drinks or take the used appetizer plates although I wished he had done that after we placed our food order because that took at least 45 minutes and I would've wanted to know how long it took exactly. The servers noticed as he was doing it but it didn't really make a difference service wise lol.

For appetizer we ordered their Spinach artichoke dip ($13.50) the dip itself was very tasty but it was hard to bypass the chips which were soaked and glistening with oil. 

We got 3 kinds of pizza shared amongst 4 adults and 2 kids: 
-Thai chicken pizza with grilled chicken, peanut sauce and topped with bean sprouts on thin crust ($19+)
-White pizza with 4 kinds of cheeses, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic on hand tossed crust ($17+)
-Sicilian pizza with Italian sausage, Capicola ham, Salami also on thin crust ($18+)

I was looking forward to eating the butter cake with ice cream for dessert but by the time we finished we were stuffed.

The shashito peppers were the best I've ever had. And yes, it's not really rocket science, as long as you blister the skin. It was the quality of the peppers. These were so much meatier than an others I've ever had, which are all skin with little flesh. For my entrée, I enjoyed the chimichurri chicken.

i ordered the jambalaya fettuccine and it was just a burst of flavors. the pasta had blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage and tasso ham in spicy cajun sauce! i love the spiciness of the sauce it brought the ingredients together! ( i am drooling while typing right now haha) the pasta was cooked perfect and the seafood was so good! it was nice that the meat to pasta ratio was fair. the crawfish and sausage was my favorite! i like the dip my bread with the extra sauce on the plate! i cant wait to order this again!

my boyfriend ordered the italian chopped salad and he finish the whole plate! we both thought the flavors worked well together. the salad had roasted turkey breast, julienned salami, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, mozzarella and basil tossed in mustard parmesan vinaigrette. the dressing was a bit sour but it had a nice taste to it with the turkey and salami. the salad was fresh and the ingredients went well with the awesome vinaigrette!

5 stars because service was wonderful! i wish i remembered his name but he constantly kept coming back refilling our waters as well as our bread! he never rushed us once even though they were about to close. in the end he boxed my left over jambalaya and ate it the next day before heading out to the pool parties the next day!",vhDXdBeje8e7xYIIFmbYpw,1,0,5,vhnipUKhML4tEnuf4PEpeQ

But, it is just me or are the prices at this location remarkably higher than other locations??? A half salad that would normally be 10 bucks at other CPKs will run you at least $13 here. Their pizzas, normally around $13, are almost $20 here. WTF.  I know it's on the strip, but what a racket.

1.Wait times are busy its a oddly shaped restaurant so expect a wait
2. Price is a bit pricey for a pizza but I guess that's because it's inside a hotel.
3.Customer Service is the driving factor of this field and sometimes its a little lacking well 2 times I went.

We tried, but then we were chastised for ordering drinks from the ""wrong"" person. ""Why would you order form her! She was not your waitress."" Are you kidding?

Compared to the other entrees, the lettuce wraps were pretty good. However, as a standalone plate, it was nothing special. Anything will taste pretty bomb compared to the pizzas and pastas that I mentioned below.

Pastas:
I tried about 3 different pastas from our group and they were ALL sooo dang bland! You can make better pasta by heating up some Prego and boiling some noodles at home. Definitely NOT worth even considering them.
