The manager can't count. I said double meat on one sandwich and triple on the other. She asked me multiple times. Double meat. Two times the meat. I said yes. She ended up putting FOUR TIMES the meat on one and 6 X meat on the other. I asked what the hell happened because the sandwhiches were giant, and the price was freaking craziness. 

She explained ""i asked you if you wanted two times the meat"" i said yes. 2 x 1 is 2, not four. Double means 2. I have no idea why she didn't understand it. It was so ridiculous. 

Also, theyre always out of stuff. No chipotle mayo and no lettuce for the lettuce wrap one day. Their response was ""well its the end of the week."" Ummm so? You are open everyday.

1079035,2016-09-12,2,Lt_ytMJKMQ3lpBDYaANreA,"I would give a negative rating, if allowed. This location used to be just as good as others, but it has fallen apart in the last few months about the time the employees stopped wearing name tags (which I always find is a bad sign). Several months ago I went in on a Sunday. I ordered a medium #5 with no cheese which has both turkey and ham on it. Between the 2 meats, the server only put 5 slices of meat on the sandwich. When I complained I was told that the sandwich was made to corporate standards and if I wanted more meat I would have to pay for it. A medium is an 8"" sandwich, so he basically had putt he slices flat end to end to cover the bread. There was another employee there, so I complained again and was told the same thing. Then I was told there was nothing I could do about it. So I said yes there is, and I walked out. 
I didn't go back for a long time. Then I stopped in during lunch on a weekday and had no problems at all. So when I wanted a sandwich yesterday it didn't cross my mind that there would be a problem again. Boy was I wrong.
On Sat, 9/10 at about 1pm, I entered this store which looked deserted. There was music blaring from the back room which had no business being playing in a family establishment. I can't imagine walking in there with small children to that kind of music. Someone poked their head out to say they would be right there and ran into the back again. So I waited and the music finally stopped. Then another guy comes out of the back and asks me what I want, while putting on gloves without washing his hands. So I said ""I would like a med #1 on white and a med #5 on wheat with no cheese"". He responds by saying ""Ok that's 2 sandwiches on white"". I said, ""That's not what I said at all. One is white and one is wheat."" He says, ""Well first I need to know what size they are before I can help you."" So I said ""I already told you the sizes of the sandwiches. I was very detailed when I placed my order."" At that point I was told that he can refuse service to anyone he wants, whenever he wants, and he doesn't like my attitude so he won't be serving me. My mouth hit the floor!!! You are the one not doing your job properly, but you are going to refuse to serve me? I decided not to say what I was really thinking, but I walked to the door and told him that this was the second time I had been treated poorly at this location. His response was to tell me that I was 86""d!!! And to tell me he doesn't have to take this abuse from me. ??? The reality is that the order would probably have been a disaster if this ridiculous altercation hadn't happened. 
I went down the street to Jersey Mikes, where I was treated like a valued customer, not an intrusion to their private party. Also something to note, this store was deserted during lunch hour on a beautiful Saturday, but the Mike's location had several tables full and lots of people in line. 
So I am now infamous for being 86'd by a teenager from a Port of Subs because he couldn't figure out my order. He probably just did me a huge favor. Trust me - stay away from this location.",68wjznRnXzSSD2sQj2kN-w,0,0,1,wW7T4eFSQbn99SF95ZJNXw

Recently I have noticed the poor customer service. I have been asking for cucumbers which are never cut up, they hurry me along the line, and sloppily put together the sandwich. I am talking ""the contents are falling out and there is mayonaise on the ouside of the bun sloppy."" 

One time they had recently cleaned with bleach because you could smell it walking in. THat is gross enough, but later I touched my eye and my eyes started burning and the smell made me sick. I figured out that they must have touched the pens used to sign receipts with their bleach gloves and when I signed the receipt it got on my hands, later transfering to my eyes and nose.

The person at the other store took the gift card #s but then couldn't explain how to check me out with my gift cards. Either that or they misunderstood the question.

3240391,2015-01-25,0,Lt_ytMJKMQ3lpBDYaANreA,"I have been going to Port of Subs in Las Vegas every now and then for at least 23 years. Never a complaint about the food or service, felt a very positive vibe from Port of Subs and treated with respect. This changed when I was in Port  of Subs yesterday after noon and waited on a woman who later said she was the manager named, Desiree. I walked in a good mood and there was one man getting his sandwiches made. I was not impatient, or any trouble, just watching the sandwich making and waiting. When it was my turn she looked at me strait face with out a greeting and stated with a tone of annoyance; ""What can I get for you, Ma'am?"" Since I was there to get the largest one for my child and I said, ""What does the 13 inch look like."" She said in the same tone that carried on; ""We don't have a 13 inch."" She said nothing further and as I scanned the board, I said; ""Oh, I was looking at the 13 dollars that was by the 2 foot, I guess the 12 inch one is the next smaller one?"" She said with out pointing or gesturing; ""its right there in front."" I said I would take that one and said wheat bread, as she picked up to cut it, I said, ""oh..no pickles."" and then she said ""Tell me later, when I get to it."" During this time another customer walked in that was a regular as the way she spoke to her, as Desiree started to cut the meat and cheese, she was chatting and smiling and making eye contact with full attention on the regular customer. She even apologized to the regular customer that was in the process of making ""hers""(mine)! As if I was in the way, and that is exactly what she projected. I noticed the turkey and cheese was almost shaved, and when she proceeded to put the toppings on I told her ""no jalapenos"" and then she reached for them so I said it again and she took her hand back out and didn't move and rolled her eyes as if to say, ""well then what DO you want."" The rest of the toppings, the lettuce etc. was scanty. The sandwich looked flat. She continued with this disrespect until I paid. I waited on the side because I don't like to make a scene and I wanted to ask her who her manager was. So as I watched her make this next customers food, the regular, she asked for double everything. The sandwich was huge, she was putting on handfulls of meat cheese etc... If mine was doubled it would not have even been half that size! Then another man can  and ordered and his sandwiches, were made much fuller than mine as well and so was the customer before me. I finally left and called the store and I she said she was the manager and I told her that I would have talked to her in person but since I would not say it in front of others, I called and then I told her that she was very rude and there was nothing I did to merit that. She did not act surprised or say something like..""I did not realize it or I would never do that on purpose ..."" She said in a very monotone voice; ""I'm sorry I won't do it again."" Then I asked why she did it and she repeated the statement. This was telling that she knew she was and the called ended. I was buying the sandwich for my child who I was meeting with and only had an hour to talk to her, my child is not eating and not well and I wanted  to get Port of Subs for the protein and other good veg. There was nothing on that sandwich almost just bread. I could not use the time well to speak to my child because I was shaken by the very bad experience which felt borderline abusive, she was bullying me.  I could not get my thoughts together or on the topic. I continued to have anxiety later that night because I would not be seeing my child again and if anyone needed the food, they did. I feel she cheated my child and she really did. I never experienced this negative energy and treatment ever at any Port of Subs. This is how Desiree presented the one time welcoming environment of Port of Subs to one that was telling me I was not welcomed. Desiree  might be a manager but manage to do this. If I received a sandwich made like that 20 years ago or anytime, I would have never went back to Port of Subs. I would have remembered not to go back, and that you don't get what you pay for. Desiree was playing favorites with the customer and using the product as she wished or did not wish,  giving her whopping amounts of food, even to excess; handfuls of meat, cheese, and mine, she did not even put the minimum required and shaved it. Unlike Desiree, this is not my former experience with anyone else at any Port of Subs. All workers have consistently dealt with me in a professional manner, which is to put attention to you and to make sure you're feeling good about the establishment and the food they're serving. I always walked out of Port of Subs feeling happy that I walked in.",s0lFADslFd5Mb2qMgKoTuQ,1,0,1,6kWZ1AAFklhH3Dq9LTA5yA

The owners @ this location; not prepared to run a business for sure! 

I requested an order (2 variety sandwich trays) a week in advance for my daughters birthday.

The day of the pick up the owners (not the employees) figured they didn't stock up on necessary products (meats) and the girls/employees didn't have enough ingredients to finish the order (they had 1 week advance notification) and now we were left missing the whole orders of roast beef and pastrami sandwiches.

The young lady was so apologetic about the situation and poor girl was constantly trying to get ahold of the owner to make sure he was on the way with the meats but guess what he was way too busy with his personal errands (not caring about the business).

He told his employee to let us know it'll be an additional 30min wait besides the 45 min we had already waited because he needed to finish up his errands. ( OH NO! Mad at this point)
The young lady asked if it was ok to make the rest of the order with different ingredients...we had no choice but to keep it basic due to the time crunch plus our cake was gonna go down the drain if we didn't refrigerate it on time.

I've never been impressed with this location, but last time I went there, they cut the meat so thin, it was falling apart!  The capicola actually had holes in it!

Other Port of Subs in town much better.

Yea, dirty place, dirty employees, horrible restaurant.",4tBboKZrkVWp4IZES_wqug,1,0,1,1BAxDIWLOjSomycm8haI3g

I went in 10 min till closing and those 2 girls were so sweet letting me take my time, recommending sandwiches. They even turned the grill back on for me so I could toast my sub. My #5 was so delicious I'll be back again tomorrow night",7-qEK_xOmB8V8XFg7-2SLA,0,0,5,wg_z1hSEmYeSZZuJJrAddg
5654697,2016-07-19,0,Lt_ytMJKMQ3lpBDYaANreA,"I love Port of Subs and their sandwiches. However, I do not like nor will I recommend *this* particular location. Here is my experience.

I decided to give this place another try after my previous customer service experience here a few weeks ago was not good. The first time around, I ordered by number, like I do at a couple other Port of Subs locations here in town. I asked for a #16. The guy behind the counter then started cutting meat of a different sandwich. When I told him I asked for a #16, he became argumentative and replied, ""No, you asked for #18."" I'm pretty sure I asked for a #16 but did not want to argue with him. He then said he could switch to the #16 but his body language and demeanor indicated he would not be happy. I apologized for the miscommunication and told him to finish making the #18. He replied with an obligatory tone, ""Are you sure?"" I replied, ""You're good. Just finish making the sandwich. Now, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and dismissed it as it was about 10 minutes to closing time. He probably wasn't having the best day, and I just wanted my sandwich and go. 

This evening, I was running a little late for work and decided to give this place another try. As I pulled up, I looked through the store window and noticed it was the same person I dealt with the last time I was here, who was behind the counter. I double checked to make sure their place was still open. I had 15 minutes before they closed at 9:00pm. I mumbled to myself as I got out of my car, ""Please, no issues."" As soon as I walked in the door, the guy looks at me with the same look one would have when being caught between a rock and a hard place and said, ""Uh, . . . we just cleaned up everything . . ."" I immediately did a 180 turn and walked out without saying a word.

I work in customer service and have also been a customer service manager. Therefore, my expectations for people working in customer service are a little higher than some. I also used to work in food service so I know what it's like when customers (especially groups of 3 or more) come in during the last few minutes just before closing time, so I can empathize with the workers, and normally try to avoid being *that* customer. However, in this particular situation, I was a party of one and it was 15 minutes before they closed.

Unacceptable and poor customer service. I will avoid this particular location.",7ITKX-WWuOXTXFVdJVxgSA,2,0,1,wSUOYZELzCVFvVVvr4v_hA

I have never had someone to reach out to me before to correct an issue. They apologized and issued me two $5 gift checks. They also advised that they would deal with their employees. Thank you Port of Subs for reaching out by going above and beyond. It shows that you care about your reputation as a company. I will definitely visit again.,_Lh-pOke6f8p_lCu_hU-0Q,0,0,5,Z93c7wqnIBceDjShPCFKew
