Zachary is always working when we go and he is so great, such a nice guy and works so hard. I'm surprised there are bad reviews for this location as I've never had a bad experience!",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,4,2,5,x9wQ3ZIeQGTDGLpbQd9pRw
1634333,2014-03-13,5,hEpCJXGI_zRhKXgW67VbFA,I stopped here for dessert after eating Panda Express in the food court. The employees were very friendly and gave a a BOGO coupon for a future visit. The pretzels were just okay. The first jalapeno pretzel I had was dry and hard so I went back and they agreed and made me a fresh one. The fresh one was very good. I also shared some of my wife's cinnamon pretzel sticks and they were good. I paid for some melted cheese sauce and ended up getting rock hard cheese in a peel top plastic cup. I turned the cup upside down and nothing moved. After having to go back and have my pretzel remade I didn't want to then go back up about the cheese. This place is good with a coupon but paying full price isn't worth it since you don't know if it's going to be super bomb are dry and hard. I did get a sample of some lemonade that wasn't bad.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,7,7,3,hev6i6sSYXWPRit9MstN0A
1773216,2017-08-29,2,hEpCJXGI_zRhKXgW67VbFA,"Who doesn't love the smell of cinnamon and pretzels, am I right? 

Located inside Red Rock Casino, it's the perfect place for a quick snack before or after the movies or bowling since it's near the theater and right around the corner from Red Rock Lanes. No place to sit, so you might want to head to the food court if you have time. The Pretzel Dog is really tasty, but the Cinnamon Sugar Nuggets are my favorite. Lemonade is pretty good (very sweet) and I especially like the frozen (strawberry) lemonade mixers. They usually give out samples, which are almost impossible to resist.",SAWkTZbP79ildfrDsiqUrQ,4,3,4,U9tliVnJu41YKFDjoQ2Ohw
3134624,2015-01-20,0,hEpCJXGI_zRhKXgW67VbFA,"This isn't my first trip here.  I actually prefer this location over the others.. One reason is because it's inside a casino's food court so you can sit & enjoy it!  Perfect date spot, go bowling, movies, grab a treat here..

Now for the reason for the horrible score. Came here today 1/19/15 to redeem my printable coupon I received 2 weeks ago. I signed up for their emails & enrolled in the perks.  I had one completely free birthday pretzel (on the app),  but I wanted to use that coupon I attached in my review. The odd part this particular one was sent to me 1/2/15 it was a random.  I like random who doesn't?  Thought it was lovely, ""print & present coupon"" says it right there! 

Zachary was nice at first.  He mildly annoyed me because he asked for my app. That's fine,  you can look but when you load my app I don't have that same EXACT reward.  The others I have are completely free. I didn't feel like pulling out my app it says in fine print to present it. It's the principal that matters to me. I didn't take time out my day to screw him all up. 

Last time I used a printable coupon it was at the South LV Outlets. Lady had no problem to honor it.


There was no manager here to help Zachary. He was clueless. Bit of an inconvenience to me too Zachary. 8 PM at night,  the only one in line & you sir have no manners! Not a please come again or you have a nice night too! I told him have a good night no response.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,0,0,1,EZo_L5Pql1ne_vMlCqhy5g

I've come here multiple times and only ha an issue once - a pretzel with a burnt bottom. Aside from that, everything has been fine. I recommend the Original Pretzel and Lemonade with added cherry flavor. Always a delicious combination.

Staff is courteous and routinely offers free samples.",_jpt07tQlw3KOkTM0fus2g,2,1,4,40uxfRrz-9LI3Kve0LHPQQ
3519774,2013-09-10,17,hEpCJXGI_zRhKXgW67VbFA,"This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a ""Sour Cream and Onion"" and ""Jalapeno"" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,21,3,Vpy8Hb_Q4eYJ6TY76KthmA
3563442,2013-05-14,0,hEpCJXGI_zRhKXgW67VbFA,"They're brand spankin' new!

I first tried purchasing from them the Saturday before they were open (not knowing) and was informed by the manager to come back the next day because they were not open for business yet, but they would be giving out free samples. Bummed! I love pretzels, lol. But I knew I'd be back in a few days.

Conveniently located next to the Red Rock Regal Cinema and across the hallway from Kids Quest! The pretzels were delicious as usual and they were having a buy 3, and get the 4th one free special. I know that they are new so the staff is still a little awkward because they are trying to get into the swing of things but everyone was nice and as attentive as they could be. 

I bet they did not foresee that on their grand opening, they'd have to cater to a big line of hungry patrons there for the prescreening of a movie, lol! Thanks again for the prescreening Edwin P.!",E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw,3,3,4,tD_M9xQuwQ1aFZOWLKqp0w

I was here last week and was available......just have to wait 7-10 minutes for it. Completely disappointed! Is it off the menu or not?

But....Auntie Anne's stood back in the other side of the crowd with its new blue menu so pretzels it was.

They ran out of pretzel dogs which would have been a 20 minute wait so I opted for the 3 pretzels get one free: garlic, cinnamon, whole wheat and almond. Cinnamon was a little too sweet..but all others were perfect for the fireworks show.",AnSIhCirCP4RIP2JDTQe2Q,1,1,4,H-KOy_IBfysoIwsmRMhn9A

Sara tells me she didn't know what I was talking about, had no clue what a groupon was, got flustered and asked me ""what- what do you want me to do??"" UHHHH whhhhhat?????? I work in the service industry and if I ever treated people like this I'd end up looking for another job. They had no manager there.. It's so sad because I LOVE this place..

5526845,2013-05-19,0,hEpCJXGI_zRhKXgW67VbFA,"Do you prefer your pretzel tied in a bow or as perfect bite size perfection a.k.a. bites?? Auntie Anne's has something for everyone! Tip: if you're vegan, just order your pretzel with no butter - voila! 

I love soft pretzels and AA's recipe is one of my favorites! It used to be I couldn't get one unless I was at an airport or mall, but with this new location that just opened in Red Rock I can get one whenever I get a hunkering for video poker or go to a movie!

The girls working here are friendly and the pretzels are made fresh. Cinnamon bites were out for sampling... yes please, can I have more than one? Yesterday they were out of cheese sauce which the bf wanted, (surprising because they've only been open a few days) but they had salsa cheese dip that was pretty good too.

My favorite dipping sauce is the sweet mustard and I always go for the salt free. I've yet to try something here I didn't like - the sour cream and onion and the sweet almond are fun if you like to mix it up a bit. 

Also note that you can go to their website www.auntieannes.com and sign up for their pretzel perks to receive coupons and a free pretzel for your birthday. I say pretzel on Auntie Anne's, pretzel on!",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,3,1,4,06zq2yHfIOp4M0gfjE87_A
