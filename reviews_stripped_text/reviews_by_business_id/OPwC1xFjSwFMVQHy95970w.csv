Pretty good lunch specials from 11am/3pm that range $5-$10 which is convenient if you're in a quick little lunch break. I am a fan favorite of their philly cheese steak, because it's far from dry unflavored meat and it's a pretty good portion size. As long as they keep their great customer service and amazing food I keep oncoming back.",UAVb6aDhLvu0PRN18k4TpQ,1,2,5,emdp0nwyr8nPr0U9tI6Wvw

Ryan (the owner) actually delivered our food and we talked for a few minutes. What a great inspired young guy. Amanda answered the phones and we found out that she is Ryan's partner, we tipped her because she called us to let us know our delivery was going to be late due to the hockey game.

Well, my husband found the other half and ate it on me!  He asked me after, where I got the sub because it was one of the best he has ever had too!  Thank you to the new owners for the changes!

I decided to go ahead and get the lunch special.    I thought I would be able to eat at least 1 while I was there, the guy (who was so polite) said it would be a few minutes before the order was ready.  So next thing I know everything is done.  So I just decide to eat and drive (don't do like I do, some of ya'll can't talk on the phone and drive) lol  But the crust was different! It was so good, you know how when you pick up a slice of pizza it goes limp?  Ya'll not this pizza, you can hold it and it doesn't go limp!  And it's crunchy, but not hard!  (I love crunchy stuff) and the pizza was good too!  I love it when pizza places sell pizza by the slice or just 2 slices.    I will be back!

4035382,2018-06-01,4,OPwC1xFjSwFMVQHy95970w,"Seeking a place to eat lunch yesterday I decided to try this pizza joint. Pizza of all kinds is always worth a try. I was so glad that I did stop and try. The pizza here was so delicious. When a guest walks through the door since this is such a smaller pizza parlor it has that homey type feel. The cook that made the pizza was also the cashier and he was very pleasant. 

They have advertised lunch specials and I took advantage of this special deal they were offering. The lunch special that I took advantage of was 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4.99. What a great deal too? Although the pizza by the slice was not ready and we had to wait ten minutes for it; this was just fine for me. When I came up to the counter he was in process of kneed the dough. 

The pizza was worth the wait and maybe a little more money but I always love saving money. The two slices I had were cheese and hot and fresh straight from the oven. The store also provided Parmesan cheese for customers. This is even a must on the the best of pizzas. Extra cheese makes everything better. As a drink there fountain machine was down so he offered can drinks in place of it or bottled water. The selections of the canned soda were better than what was being offered in the fountain. So I paired the order of cheese pizza with cherry 7up. This was such a great little place for lunch with unbeatable prices, exceptional food, and excellent service.

I've tried a lot of places here in town and there is just no comparison.  Everything is made fresh, they take a lot of pride and always go for the highest quality not to mention which I've said before, they support military and first responders.

So, a place that appreciates its customers, its community, the military, first responders and have amazing food, you have got to try this place.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,11,12,5,Y4mkVPTNmLW-O4VGiAG9sg
4580681,2018-06-24,0,OPwC1xFjSwFMVQHy95970w,"I just happened upon this business by accident.  It was a great accident indeed!  The pizza was amazing, the toppings were delicious and there was a perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings.  

I had a weekend day off, so that meant a trip to the massage school for a cheap massage.  Upon reaching my destination, they had signs up saying they're booked, and are no longer open Sunday afternoons.  It was a sad day indeed.  Until I turned the corner of the sidewalk and walked into IDK.  

They had reasonable prices, I was greeted by the owner and he explained that they'll make whatever you want.  They also have some of their more popular pizzas in case you're lazy like me, and don't want to have to assemble your own creation.  I ordered a modified version of one of their specials, and watched him craft this masterpiece.  

After a few minutes in the oven, the pizza was presented to me, it looked and smelled amazing!  After bringing it home, the first bite proved this place would see my business again soon.  The deliciousness of the crust, with the right amount of cheese, sauce, and toppings was a surprise.  I had never tried this establishment, but definitely will be back.  There wasn't too much crust, the toppings weren't overwhelming the pizza, and the cheese though gooey and delicious wasn't overly greasy.  Plus the sauce was good as well.

Come to IDK to create your own masterpiece.  The employees are great, the prices are reasonable and the pizza is among the best in the Vegas valley.",iN5505977Li8XYZ3FnzWJQ,0,0,5,lzb205bvAW1nr0hKh5Qc1w

Too late. A friend and I ordered our usual for lunch delivery. Quoted 45 minutes. Ok, that's normal. An hour and 15 minutes later no pizza. When it finally came, an hour and half, the pizza was c c cold and soggy. The mushrooms tasted ""dirty"", like no one washed them before they cooked them.

This is a HUGE disappointment as now I/we have to find a new place for pizza delivery.

Our son said the pizza was better than Marcos. The sauce on the pizza was excellent. It seems like the pizza chains go ""thin"" on the sauce, but not with IDK as it seemed like just the right amount. The bacon was great, and I really liked the crust. 

For $10, it fed a family of 5, and we had a piece and a half left over, which made great breakfast the following day :)

The garlic knots are something I would walk a few miles for. Absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, I only got one, because the kids fought for the others. Order these, you will not be disappointed!",HynP4yf37EbULWT9opd1LA,2,2,5,hwbYbxxFgCuzFRUzxwfx-A

5756750,2018-06-04,2,OPwC1xFjSwFMVQHy95970w,"IDK Pizza. Well... let's start with the name. Funny, but not funny when you're asking yourself ""idk where the fuck my pizza is at?"" I don't understand how my mom ordered pizza around 3pm and our pizza didn't show up till about 6pm. The guy delivering had called and said he was on his way multiple times. This place is maybe 2 miles away from my parents house. 
My mom called the manager to ask why it's taking so long and the manager said "" well did you try and help him find your house? Did you give him your cross streets?"" No apologies, or help. Just a smart ass question. 
Obviously she is going to try and help guide someone who is lost. But my parents house isn't hard to find at all and again it's maybe 2 miles away. So it at least took two hours for our pizza to get here, and the boxes were kinda flimsy and soggy and pizza was cold and crust was pretty hard. Not even worth the two hour wait and the managers rude attitude. 
Perhaps they should work on better customer service skills, if they are going to provide mediocre pizza. 
And possibly change their name to "" IDK where the fuck my pizza's at"" if they're going to provide two hours of waiting.
Perhaps they just scheduled the weaker staff members or where having a bad day... but overall not great service, or pizza.",F8N_R2jgMyERIZMqtZb0fQ,2,0,2,8KFnkiTVp1L0b2zwxtGW_A
