Oriental House has absolutely THE BEST food I have found in Las Vegas in the 21 years I've resided here.
The food is always fresh and delicious.The family that owns and operates it are very efficient and give friendly service. 
If you haven't  dined here, you are really missing out on a wonderful dining experience.                                                You won't be disappointed!",6PBtGV7ePLZ8jQniRZ2LRw,0,0,5,DhLh56bQHvCNlqZm1ci0Ug

First thing we noticed was the outstanding customer service. It's family owned/run and it shows in all aspects of the service we received. The Food was equally exceptional as well. I ordered the dumplings and the duck noodle soup and both turned out really great. Everything is handmade (and hence the higher price than usual), and it shows in the quality of their food.

Being teenagers, the main thing we looked for besides the food, was the service, since at other restaurants, we were treated differently being at a somewhat young age. However, the owner's wife, our server as well, was very kind to us, and was even so generous enough to give us free Thai iced teas. Now food wise, I give it an 11/10, it was that good. We all got something from the noodles section and it was delicious, along with a few appetizers. Their service is great and their prices are a bit on the $$, but it's okay for the amount of food they give, which is something to come back for.

Compared to some places the portions could be bigger BUT the food is very high quality and they will happily alter any dish the way you prefer.

I started with the curry puffs. Delicious! The dipping sauce was good and the cucumber pieces had designs carved into the skin. Nice touch.

This was followed by a ginger dressed salad which tasted as if they'd made it themselves. I make my own ginger dressing and theirs was very good.

For my entree I had the Ginger Perfect [chicken] but also wanted the spicy basil. We settled on spicing up the ginger perfect and it was, in a word, perfect! I like spicy & delicious.

Washed it all down with a thai tea [no boba] and plenty water as it was hot and caffeine can dehydrate.

It was a perfect meal. They are very attentive and treat people as if they never meet a stranger. Genuinely warm folks serving good food. I can't wait to return, I'm making myself hungry just typing this!",2XcnFCkVWY7LVpx-np2NyQ,2,0,5,Gu1qm2A9in1dmysnqyhb2g

We ordered papaya salad that was to dye for...summer rolls were crisp and fresh...fish with curry sauce and the chefs special chicken.  Three side salads with house dressing came along.  With only two entrees, feed three of us and we were all licking our lips.  The ladies finished with fresh mango with sticky rice for desert.  

Two major points.  1) This is truly a Mom and Pop's place which we really prefer...mainly for the cooking but also for rewarding hard working people.  2)  Thai food made without MSG and made perfectly to taste is HUGE.  Too often it is either full of additives or Americanized to the point of lost flavor.

I ordered the Spicy crispy duck with minimal spice and it was so good and fresh. The portions were just right and the prices were affordable.
My daughter ordered the wont ton soup, twice. I tried the simple broth and the flavor wasn't overpowering or bland, but just right. My husband ordered the ginger seafood medley, it was cooked to be savory and delicious. Even the thai Iced tea was very good and not too sweet.

Between the two times I have come here I have had thai beef salad, pho, atlantic noodles, eggplant tofu, ragoons, thai tea, and mango sticky rice. It was all decent, but nothing that blew me away. The ragoons could use more filling. My favorite was probably the atlantic noodles (if you like seafood) and I do love the mango sticky rice. 

It would have a decent atmosphere except every time I go it is a ghost town, as in completely empty except for me and my boyfriend. It is a little awkward to eat in an empty restaurant, but hey at least it is quite. 

I will probably be back again. The owner is pretty accommodating, he really wants to make his customers happy.

4237431,2014-06-17,3,hIqq6npOS-mSl58H7uyCkg,"This will be a two part and two rating review.

First, aside from the food, I have to say that the service was very friendly. The server  attended us well, and made several suggestions, and as Audrey S. said, the owner makes you feel welcome. That was very positive.

Now a review of what we go out for, the food.

We decided to start out with a Spring Roll appetizer. The server recommended the Fresh Asian Roll instead. It was a good idea. It is nothing like the quality Spring Rolls you get at Pho So 1, or Pho Saigon 8, but it was light and refreshing. 

I am on a diet, so I ordered a Chicken Salad. The menu said it was fried chicken. I asked the server if I could have it grilled. She accomodated me. It was very fresh, and light for a summer meal, but it really wasn't very Asian. It was simply a Thin cut chicken breast, on top of a bed of Ice Berg Lettuce, with cucumbers and tomatoes on the side. Not much presentation. Fresh and good for a diet, but not what I expected from a Thai Chinese place. I did give it 3 stars.

My wife ordered the Wanton and Noodle Soup. The bowl was small, and only a few Wanton. There was a ton of noodles, but she said they were over cooked, and she didn't even finish half of the portion. Rating 1 star.

Two stars means ""I've experienced better"", and this holds true for this place. If you are on a diet, go here for a clean salad. It's pricey for a small portion, but you'll feel better doing this, than pigging out at Sweet Tomatoes. 

However, if you're looking for good Thai or Chinese food, do your sense of eating adventure a favor, and go somewhere else.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,3,2,2,kTn_BAF7pvXCe9wN1mifoQ

4632571,2014-05-23,1,hIqq6npOS-mSl58H7uyCkg,"I decided to give the Oriental House a try because it's close to my house and am i glad i did. WHAT NICE FRIENDLY PEOPLE!! upon entering we were immediately greeted by one of the owners Barbara. She runs it with her husband Max and ""Momma Jean"" is the main chef. Oriental House just opened a few weeks ago however, these owners are NOT new to the restaurant world. They owned many famous eateries over 30 years including ""Pata"" on Wilshire in Beverly Hills and ""Chitra"".    

When you walk in, the ambiance is very spacious and modern. i like the decor all around the room. the restaurant is very clean and the customer service is A-1.

Now lets talk about the menu. Easily over ONE HUNDRED items to choose from!!  
Everything from Lemon Grass Chicken to Chaba noodle soup, Shanghai clay pot, Indian curry soup, Hawaiian fried rice, Japanese creamy curry, LOTS of Vegetarian choices and deserts included Fried bananas or Mango with sticky rice. I can't wait to try them all!

Side note: They do not sell alcohol (yet). But will introduce beer and wine on the menu soon!

Do yourself a favor and visit The Oriental House.",eGL0SQGrvLrodXRl-QH4Qg,5,2,5,MFNNNS5weKsT09kz546jfg

Our server was Peter, turns out to be owner. We had great conversations from where his restaurant first started and owns at other places. 


Food - omg.. food presentation is gourmet and the food is very delish! You can taste the authentic spices and ingredients. Also, very fresh!!!!

Peter also gave me the courtesy to try the curry bowl w rice and complimentary house Salad for my husband and I. Also, made our little one try ice cream.

I recommend this place with a 5 star!! Definitely will be coming back.

The Asian noodle as the call it, is pad Thai and so delicious. The spice level and amount of sauce is right where it should be. I have been twice in a week which is a testimony to the delicious noodles they have. They have a very large menu and the restaurant is always quiet. I am sad that this restaurant is empty when I come because it deserves recognition! The owners are here and the wait staff is very friendly! She gave me two 10% off cards to use on my next visits. Come here if you want a large selection of all delicious Asian food.",Vv23fZ8tC5XTdQq8EFJBIQ,1,0,5,owc8iIHql8kJ_l0Wss1agg
