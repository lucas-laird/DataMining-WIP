Got the family meal, some of the chicken was bloody, the churros  were soggy with grease, the salad was wilted. I paid extra for 4 breasts and they gave me me 3 and a wing and it cost me 28.00",ZroVE8H-zeysfLkG6RvQBA,0,0,1,RSbVnQYnDJeo-uBODZAlMw

1166498,2017-03-24,0,lsGIcUOadXjaRtKFNtrq8Q,"Wow. Just pretty bad . I was running errands and I stopped in since I was in that area, just because I had a coupon for a nice new salad. Well I pull in heading towards the driveway and there were cones blocking the entrance. Ok. I'll get out and go in to order my avocado salad with the coupon . The girl screams "" we can't take credit cards or coupons our system is down "" Ok . Mientras todos los empleados estan hablando en Espa√±ol tan ruidoso de frente de los clientes que no son hispanohablantes. This can be perceived by non speaking clients as rude, I speak and understand Spanish. This isn't a legit Mexican place , Not a local place that caters to a Latino clientele . I know that being in the service industry myself, corporate at that, it is a No-No. English should be spoken up in the front and Spanish in the back. So anyways, the girl tells me no credit. I nodded. Then I pull out the coupon to show her the new salad I wanted, and before I can finish , she says "" No coupons "" I said ""I heard you the first time"", I am just showing you the salad I wanted. I never received a receipt. Even though she should have hand written one . There was no apology, or offer of a soda or something for their inconvenience. I really like their food, even though it is fast food, but I will never go to this location again. Whoever is the manager should have been on the line where all these issues were happening. I did see a note on the way out on the door that wasn't up when I arrived, ""Cash Only "" in pen writing, but again NO APOLOGY. I understand things go wrong, because I'm in hospitality , but seriously ??? Corporate please take note !!!!! It was not right what happened today. Issues happen , but with no apologies or making up for a mistake as such as this is where you dropped the ball.",voNl6rXo9c-NuYIBIj5AQg,2,0,1,VKEnLGa_ukeLCOxMkv4mcQ

The pinto beans were just beans in juice.  No other seasonings that I could see (or taste.)

I came here the last time around 8pm ordered my usual and when I got home I noticed that they made a mistake on the order.  I normally order 3 piece, 2 breast and a wing for 2 people.  When we got home that night, they gave us 1 breast and a wing.  I called and they were like that's what they took as an order but asked me to come back.  I told the lady, it's been a long day and I am hungry and do not have the energy to drive just for a piece of chicken.  Lady apologized and said come back.  Today I came back and talked to a cashier name Jonathan and told him that I spoke to a lady and he's like I need that receipt.  I told him the lady took my name and that I don't have the receipt.  He's like I see you come all the time but still need a receipt.  Who the heck keeps a receipt after a week?  As much as I like this place, KFC has grilled chicken so from now on I am going over there.",kTOvGs5pn1gcQOsh0KP5_A,0,0,2,UGfbXmYXDjHv-s1gVNkltg

2015980,2016-05-09,0,lsGIcUOadXjaRtKFNtrq8Q,"I ate here last week and had the Shrimp and Chicken Tostada, and thought it was pretty decent.  I went back yesterday and asked for the same item and was told they no longer carry it.  Even though it is on the menu board.  Even though it is listed on the set of coupons I RECEIVED IN THE MAIL THREE DAYS AGO.  They said the only one they (all) make is the California Tostada, which ""is close"".  I told them no, and they said they had an 'ultimate shrimp' tostada, which they could add chicken to, for 'an upcharge.'  I thought, sure, if it tastes similar.  NOT!!!!!  The shrimp was chewy (a clear indication of being overdone) and they threw on shredded, heavily seasoned chicken, (it looked like leftover pieces from chicken they had cut up into pieces) NOT the chunk chicken that was on the other salad.  It also had pinto beans instead of black beans.  They also charged me twice as much as what I had paid the week before.

By the way, I went to a different El Pollo Loco today to see if the Shrimp and Chicken Tostada was 'off the menu'.  Guess what?  It's not!  (I even saw one being delivered to someone while I was there).  The other ones have it, so this store is either inept or just didn't feel like making it.  Lazy staff?  Inept?  Or just not noticing what's on their menu board?",z937wcwxVPEcpo9TmLtwYQ,1,0,1,L4NYsScZPYvOnJoMGWt_0A

4034880,2016-05-25,0,lsGIcUOadXjaRtKFNtrq8Q,"Just went through the drive thru and the lady Maria was so rude. I had two people taking turns trying to take my order. Neither could get the order correct and would keep on saying can you repeat that over and over. Not coming back her again. I said no drink multiple times that when we got the the door she said oh what drink would you like, we said no drink again.......if you want bad service and people rolling their eyes at you then this is the place for you. Don't forget to ask for Maria.

After reviewing an email from corporate I decided to give this place another chance. The lady taking my order, Candice, was exceptional. Great attitude, fast, and efficient. Our food was given to us quickly. Overall the chicken was juicy and tender. I still wouldn't give this place a five starts because of my first experience. I think I'll be coming back soon.",CtZuWMG8HAfHpqaMRIb0iQ,2,0,4,gnRoLz1Qx8_3OlVrJHhDnA

4371072,2017-05-09,0,lsGIcUOadXjaRtKFNtrq8Q,How the mighty have fallen. I  gave this location four Stars the week after opening. The last couple times they have forgotten something and I've let it go. This time was utterly ridiculous. First of all the girl forgot part of my order. Then I asked her for dressing if she tells me it's in the bag which it wasn't. Then I get home and I order a pretty big meal and salads to arrive with no utensils. Does gravy was watered down for the first time ever and also the macaroni and cheese was watery than normal. When I called to ask the manager what they can do they told me I can get 10% off on next order. I advised I had to go back now because I don't have anything to eat with since there are no Forks in my bag. Stay away from this location corporate will be getting a call from me soon. I got the well we are training excuse. 5:30 p.m. is not a time to train. Management needs to have additional training first,SkUjCvDBA2VNnJWj8DNcdg,0,0,1,A0rVyeExppOWG3PgJJIDyw

No butter for the tortillas. I spent $18.00 dollars. I could have gone to KFC an d got a lit more and better quality. Mgmt better get with the program.

5890512,2016-06-02,0,lsGIcUOadXjaRtKFNtrq8Q,"I was excited they were opening a closer one to me. Normally I go to the one on Charleston. I went and brought the 3 course meal . Spend $35 dollars,  was asked what kind of tortillas I said corn please. They forgot the corn tortillas. I asked for extra avocado on the salad which I got charged for they said they would put it separate, they didn't!!! They also put maybe like five tiny pieces of chicken in the salad looks nothing like the picture. The actual salad looked like it was half empty. And the avocado was brown with a bunch of seasoning on top of it to cover it up. I would honestly take a picture of it but its kind looks disgusting. The chicken was fine. What's funny is that since I had asked for extra things I actually tipped the guy that was the server in the window. But it's fine I will be driving the extra mile to the Charleston location .You would think that a new chain restaurant that just opened up would want to make sure that they are serving the freshest best looking products to make sure that they can build a customer base. Hopefully they get their act together because I was actually looking at the other reviews and they have similar things like the fact that they put moldy tomatoes in the salad. That is disgusting",1RM4Sk3GrPSbrjXDYGQdzQ,0,0,1,LWdbSOBQ46EqciPZzd7YPA
