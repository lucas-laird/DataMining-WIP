Of course then there's the whole burrito thing ..instead of a tortilla u can have it with a seaweed wrap or rice paper wrap ..so kinda healthier maybe? At least u will feel like u doing healthy Ha! 

I had the Triple S ...wow! Soft shell crab, spicy Tuna, Jalape√±o Masago, tempura crunch and bunch of other stuff ..so u have a choice of seaweed wrap or rice thing wrap or even tortilla I guess ..but this is best with seaweed according to the master ;)

And if u like Taro or know what it is ? Get the Taro chips ! Kinda like tortilla chips concept served in a brown Baggie and cheese (I no like the cheese part",n_TY6rd1wXZBczBaOaK6Rw,2,1,5,weFbDub_SsKnxTE299Y5-g

As soon as my wife and i walked in we were greeted with smiling faces welcoming us.  The setup reminds of subway,which is cool because you can see them ass they make it. It wasnt a long wait but oh yeah there were plenty of people deciding what to get and watching in awe how they expertly roll these beautiful sushi burritos. The place was very clean..small square tables make up the dinning area. When you get to the window,you can create your own or just choose any of the items off the menu. They have sushi bowls or burrito. I decided to try. 2 twin dragons full and 3 amigos..with seawood and reg white sushi rice(other options are available). My order was quite expensive but not unreasonable considering its sushi(fish, seafood). My order came up to $35.00. When you are paying for you meal,they print up options to as to what to tip according to your order,not mandatory but you kind of feel like you have too. Not that the employees dont deserve it. I was excited so i decided to eat a half in store. They have a salad bar which consist of. All sushi fixings;ginger,wasabi,soy sauce etc. The full size burritos are not huge but its enough for an adult. They pre cut in half for you. Took my first bite i was in heaven. It taste just like sushi in burrito with all the flavors complimenting eachother. Some of my filling did come out but thats to be expected but the seaweed wrap held up. I do find that if you go homw and put in the freezer for a bit ,it holds better when eaten. Great experience,great food,happy atmosphere but a bit pricey.

When I first heard of the concept of Japanese sushi rolls combined with Mexican food, I was thrilled. However upon closer inspection and digestion, I found that the Mexican part of the equation was lacking, severely. This is a burrito joint without flour tortillas! That would be like a burger place without any buns! Meats like Al Pastor, Adobada, and Carnitas were not offered. Mariscos were not included either. They didn't even give you the option of adding Tapatio or Valentina to your burrito, much less things like salsa verde, and roja. This is at best a Chipotle + Sushi combination. 

The food is good, it's made well and the service is prompt, but I think the fusion especially the burrito part is a giant misnomer.",QOky_87ZRmfEG3F5Id5PAg,0,0,3,-k2-PNjbIVxMKGatAlMXaw

I love sushi and the Salmon choice I ordered hit my palette and taste buds just right. Yum couldn't have gotten anything tastier. Very fresh they make it right in front of you. You are able to order half sizes if you prefer. The portion is enough to share in my opinion and leave you satisfied. I ordered a whole one but ate half and was satisfied.

It looked a bit suspect as the store front was under construction, but when you entered the store, it was nice and clean, packed with people enjoying the food.  I made my way to the counter where they greeted me and told me how to order.  Very similar to all the build your own sandwich/burrito places, but with sushi ingredients!!  I made my own burrito with Nori, Tempura Shrimp, Crab Salad, Seaweed Salad, Cabbage, Cucumbers, Unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and tempura crunches, not to forget the Sushi Rice.  They wrap up the burrito nicely, pretty much like a giant sushi roll.  

It was great! Very tasty, and the sauce recommendation was on point.  Just keep in mind, nori is a lil tough to bite on, so it may get a little messy, but I enjoyed nonetheless.  I may try a soy paper version next time.

My husband and I came by here last Saturday around 1:15 pm for lunch. After browsing the menu board, we ended up getting:

Build Your Own Poke Bowl With Ahi Tuna, $7.95 prior to tax- The way the build your own bowls work is that you pay for the bowl based on the price of whatever protein you choose. If you want to get a 2nd protein, you pay for the most expensive and then an additional $1.50 for the 2nd protein. I opted for my bowl to be made with half brown rice, half salad. I got all of the free add ins that are not spicy (I don't do spicy). I thought my bowl was hearty and filling. I liked the creamy sesame dressing (I requested for a light amount in my bowl). The ahi tuna was fresh tasting.

North Shore Poke Bowl, $7.50 prior to tax- My husband opted for one of the premade bowls. I should have asked the employee behind the counter to add salad to his bowl to be a bit more filling and round it out with some more fiber. I got this bowl for my husband to be made with brow rice (you have the option to have this made with white rice or salad or do a mix like my made your own bowl). My husband liked the fresh flavors of the fish in his bowl. 

Taro Milk Tea, $3 prior to tax- This restaurant now offers milk tea, with an option to add boba for an additional $0.50. Unfortunately because these drinks are premade, sweetness level is not able to be adjusted. Only added ice can be added to help dilute the sweetness. My husband got this drink but it was a little on the sweet side. 

Lychee Green Tea, $3 prior to tax- I opted for this tea drink. I also thought it was on the sweet side and so I just added water to my drink to lower the sweetness level. I felt this drink was refreshing and a great price. 
-----------------------
(Total= $23.22 after tax)

Service was friendly. WiFi was available and was fast for those surfing the net. The restroom in the back was clean and adequately stocked with the essentials.

We ordered the 3amigos and angry tuna burrito and you can choose seaweed or soy paper.  The paper is lined with rice then filled with sushi grade fish and awesomely complimented with Mexican flare !

I was impressed by how fresh all the ingredients were! Plus they have an awesome machine that compresses your roll at the end to make sure it doesn't fall apart. I tried the spicy tuna which was delicious and don't forget to add a sauce! (Loved the screaming o, chipotle mayo and wasabi aoli). The best part is the very fair and reasonable prices!

The entrance/mall is under renovation but look for the SOHO sign in the middle of the building. 

I came here for lunch when i had some extra time before my appointments on Sunday around 1230. Pretty busy, quite the few people in line. Set up reminds me of chipotle where you order and go down the line (if its not one of their pre-designed combinations). They have 11 ""predesigned"" combinations. If you don't like any of their pre-designed combinations, you can order by the process below

----------------------------------

1- What do u like?? - Bowl, Nacho, Burrito (Seaweed Paper, Soy Paper, Flour Tortilla, Wheat Tortilla) 

2 - How do u like it ?? - Burrito & Bowl (Sushi rice, Brown rice, White Rice, Mixed Greens - Bowl only), Nacho (Corn chips, House Made Taro Chips +$1.00) 

3 - Add Proteins - Additional protein extra $1.50 Each

$5.50 - Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Sweet Omelet, Tofu
$6.50 - Salmon, Grilled Chicken, Shrimp Tempura
$7.50 - Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Grilled Steak, Grilled Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Gardein Asada

4 - Splash Some Sauce

House Blend - Chedder Cheese Sauce, Creamy Cilantro, Honey Habenero, Mango Soy, Poke Sauce, Screaming ""O"", Sweet Chili, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Shiso Tormatillo, Unagi Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, Yuzu Ponzu

Special Blend - GF/VG Chipotle Mayo, GF/VG Ponzu, GF/VG Sweet Chili, GF/VG Wasabi Aioli, VG Mango Soy, VG Unagi Sauce

GF = Gluten Free
VG = Vegan 

5 - Pick It... It's on Us !!! - Baby Spinach, Bell Pepper, Cabbage, Cilantro, Cucumber, Green Onion, Jalapeno, Lettuce, Mixed Greens, Pico de Gallo, Red Onion, Roasted Corn, Tomato, Crispy Wonton Strips, Tempura Crunch

Sorry... on you - Avocado, Cream Cheese, Guacamole, Masago, Seaweed Salad 

---------------------------------------

Since this was my first time, decided to try one of their pre-designed ones. I had ordered the 
3 Amigos which included Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, masago, crispy wonton strips, and wasabi aioli. 

I also opted to get the house made taro chips as well as im a super fan of taro and oooh chips :D Lol 

After adding a drink, i was a little short of $16. To be honest, when i paid, i was like oh man that was kinda pricey for a meal that doesn't look like will get me full... 

3 Amigos is $10.95, Taro Chips is $1.99, and drink is $1.55. So no benefit on ""combo'ing"" if you dont want chips and/or drink. 

The taro chips were flavored with some seasoning... If anything, it reminded me of like a sort of msg like seasoning you find on some chinese crackers and what not. Taro chips itself is great. Eating with the included ""nacho cheese"" is a bit weird of a combination

The 3 Amigos was pretty decent. I got pretty full (SURPRISINGLY). Cucumber gives it a nice freshness and crisp to the ""heavy"" tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. Masago is a nice touch with the ""popping"" but the most surprising thing was the crispy wonton strips. I didnt think id like the wonton strips but it surprisingly works well. Couldn't tell much of the wasabi aioli though. Overall, just tasted creamy? LOL xD

I came back today and I LOVE the changes made to the menu names. I love how all the vegetarian options are listed together and there is even one called ""Vegan Lover"" now! I give this place a 4.5 star now! I always know what I want but people who are not familiar can simply choose a veggie choice now! +.5 stars :) 

I'm going to post what I had written a few weeks ago because the product nor my item choice has changed:::::
I'm a huge fan of Sushiritto in SF.
Well now I'm spoiled because I have SOHO less than ten minutes from my house!

Super vegan or veggie friendly. I get the Gardein steak, spicy vegan mayo, nori paper, sushi rice, and alllllllllll the veggies! 

Veggie menu choices are easy to select from.

I love all the flavors combined. At first I was like ""grilled corn and steak flavor in my sushiritto, hell no."" But I tried it and it's sooooo yummy! I am a huge seaweed salad lover so I usually unwrap and add some seaweed salad. And of course while I'm unwrapped I add ginger and wasabi! I like it spicy!

I have also tried a bite of a vegan Mex style, the Gardein steak, grilled corn, lettuce, pico, spicy vegan mayo, avocado, tomatoes, soy paper wrap, brown rice. It was also good! My husband usually gets something like that because he is NOT a fan of anything sushi smelling, no nori or wasabi for him! 

I have gotten my combo bowl style also but there is just something yummy and comfort food with that burrito style. Maybe because all the extra tortilla calories?!?! Oh well, just eat it.

The line can get super long at lunchtime so I usually go around 1-2pm weekdays. Never been on a weekend. Since its new I'm sure it's a total madhouse.

If you're thinking about calling ahead to order, don't even sweat! They don't answer the phones because they're too busy fulfilling orders and everyone is super fast, trying to get to the next one.

I ordered the 3Amigos on Seaweed, but I sub the white rice to a brown one. Despite the addition of Jalape√±os and replacing the Wasabi Aioli with Chipotle Mayo, it's still not spicy enough for me. I'll probably try a different variation next time I go.

If you call making a giant sushi roll while calling it a burrito ""fusion,"" that is!  Either way, it's pure genius and extremely YUMMY.

I went with the recommendation of the employee working the creation station ordered a couple of the more popular burritos.  And I learned why they are popular.

First, the Twin Dragon - Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Lettuce, Cucumber, Guacamole, Crispy Wonton Strips, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Unagi Sauce.  It was a great size and the flavor was also amazing.  

Second, the 3 Amigos - Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cucumber, Red Onion, Cilantro, Masago, Crispy Wonton Strips, Wasabi Aioli.  If I could do this again I would skip or get less wasabi.  Otherwise, 100% pure awesome.

I give this place 3 stars. It might even be 2 stars. 

I got the Twin Dragon, and though it might have been good, I couldn't get over the fact that it was super salty. I couldn't figure out if it was because of the seaweed salad I added, or the sauce, or maybe it was the spicy tuna or crab mix. Either way, it was just too salty. I couldn't enjoy my food. 

Meanwhile, my friends really enjoyed their 3 Amigos. I regretted not getting it, but I also didn't want the wasabi aioli that was in it. In hind sight, I guess I could've gotten a different sauce with it.

My other friend went to the other location on Jones, and had the Twin Dragon and enjoyed it. I think I just had a bad batch. I will give it one more try before I completely dismiss this place. It doesn't seem like a bad place to eat. The food was fresh, service was quick, and workers were pretty friendly.

Mind you AIRA, you have a job because of the customers, not because of your employer. So you better start treating customers right or just get out of the food service business. 

I've been coming to Soho for quite some time now because I like the rice bowls. I wouldn't recommend the burrito bec it is overstuffed and it falls apart easily. My favorite was Sunny Salmon with sweet chipotle mayo, ponzu sauce, extra cucumbers, cilantro and corn. Their taro chips with furikake is the bomb!

Losts of proteins and veges available.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING TEMPURA CRUNCH FLAKES ADDED. This added an incredibly crunchy texture that you may not normally experience on a sushi roll.

1781285,2016-01-06,10,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"Apparently while I was out of town for the holidays, this spot underwent a name change- same staff, same product and menu, same quality, just a name change to show they'd ""merged with the owner's first restaurant."" Which was already common knowledge.

The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, some with Mexican influences. Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.

Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.

The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.
The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.
The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.
TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. 

Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,18,4,kElgkEVF2NFRHYwomYJVGA

My favorite thing to get here is building my own bowl. I would get a blend of yellowtail / salmon / unagi. The food is fresh and the consistency is always the same. Very very few occasions, the brown rice would be slightly undercooked, but it's very close to perfect each time.

my dinner mate says the burrito was actually pretty good so maybe i should have gone that route.  oh well.  i guess i'll never know.",g2X7KYVwTcsrqM51AZhdiA,1,1,2,8_tV5yv3u5bM5OJQC7WJwg

But I digress. If you've read other reviewers this place serves sushi burritos-and they are tasty! Think sushi meets burritos meets chipotle. You can create your own burrito or bowl or salad with ingredients such as spicy tuna, yellowtail, steak, chicken, shrimp tempura, guacamole, lettuce, cucumbers, jalape√±os, tempura crunch, wonton crisps, and more. If you aren't feeling creative, you can select a burrito from one of their options. Again, it is chipotle style, so you have compete control over what does/does not go into your meal. 

We ordered the twin dragon and the three S's burritos. The three S's had a bit too much sauce, but it was tasty. If ordered again, I would tell them to easy on the sauce. I preferred the twin dragon, which was a little lighter on the sauce and delicious. 

We were there on a Saturday night around 6pm and there was a steady stream of patrons. There's not a lot of seating area in the restaurant, but that didn't seem to be an issue. Many people were taking their order to go. Service was quick and efficient considering the number of people. 

Overall, if you like sushi this place is definitely worth the trip. If there's people in line, don't let that discourage you, it shouldn't take too long. :-)",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,0,5,S1DrQGNYxyXwDyW-5YluLA

Last week my co-workers and I came here for lunch and I was hugely disappointed. First, my co-worker asked one of the staff which base is the best with one of the bowls she wanted to try, the guy waved his arms around and said ""it varies...I don't know.."" Not the best way to advertise your food and help your customers. 

My complaint has nothing to do with the quality of the food; veggies were fresh, fish were cold and fresh, great flavors. I just don't think its worth the price. If you have ever been to Too See Roll, I think you will agree that TSR is much better. 

I don't like that this place has limited fish options, the most expensive bowl gives you 2 fishes and anything else is extra. Their toppings are also very limited and don't really fit well with the concept of the bowls: guacamole, sour cream, red onions, pico...seems like toppings at Chipotle more than toppings for sushi bowls. Common toppings such as seaweed salad is also extra. TSR has so many more toppings that are all included and they also allow more variety of fish at around the same price. 

Don't think I will come back here, not that food isn't good, I just like more variety and options with my bowl which this place just does not offer. But if you live far from TSR then this place will just have to do.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,1,2,zcKGQixkWu0M8NN6QVEk0w

2081028,2016-02-09,4,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"Sushirritos are apparently not a new idea, but I have never heard of it before. Sushi and a burrito all in one? I was intrigued. SoHo occupies a small space across from Palace Station, next to David's Bridal. The dining room is small and there are only a few tables. The first time I came here was around dinner time and the dining room was packed. There was nowhere to sit so my friend and I walked to the Mickey Dees and ate there. The last time I came in, around 7pm, there were a few open tables so my friends and I were able to eat there. I wish they had a bigger space so they could have more seating, but they are still new and Rome wasn't built in a day. 

So how it works is you make your own bowl/burrito/salad/nachos, or you can choose one of their signature selections. I have tried a few signature items but I prefer to make my own. I almost always get a burrito on a seaweed wrap with fresh salmon, surimi crab, tempura shrimp, spicy mayo, unagi sauce and masago. This costs about $11 or so. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. You can get your items ala carte or upgrade to a combo that includes a drink and a side of your choice for a few bux more. Side options include edamame, miso soup and taro or tortilla chips with nacho cheese. The taro chips were surprisingly sweet, and went really well with the canned nacho cheese. I love sweet/savory combinations and this one was pretty good. Make sure to grab salsa/soy sauce/ginger/wasabi from the salsa bar.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,10,7,4,YJd4zqalinyazC3mKqG2Qw

The first two times that I went, I created my own. The spicy tuna is ACTUALLY SPICY! Not burn you mouth off kind, but a little bit more than a buffalo sauce gives off. Definitely a good mix with the shrimp tempura or fresh salmon :) 

The next two times I went I got the taro chips with cheese sauce and the umami burrito! They were finally offering eel and it quickly became my favorite thing! I will say the price is a bit steep on that roll ($11 something for the roll ) but it by far had some of the best and most kick butt flavors I've ever had.

My concerns going into this place was the same I get with every burrito, it's going to get too big and soggy and just be a ball of mush at the end. I did not run into that problem here. They have a machine that tightens the rolls for them and it certainly helped! It's not overpowering or mushy. just great flavors and fun ambiance. 

When you think about it, you're gonna spend about $15-$20 on 2-3 8pc rolls, without a drink. This place will run you about $8-10 without a drink and fills you up more.

You can make them more typical burrito like or more sushi like. I leaned towards sushi like because I love sushi. Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna were my proteins of choice. They were not stingy with the protein which is a major plus for me. I got it wrapped in the seaweed with white rice- also typical sushi style. I had some buffalo sauce and lettuce in there which took away from the sushi feel so ill probably lean away from that next time. 

Mine and my wife's together came to about $15. Really can't beat that. I left satisfied and I have a pretty serious appetite. The wife was full until about lunch the day after. I call this a win.

2228477,2016-10-08,4,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"The portions were better than I expected. Let's be honest here, I'm a cheapskate, so I wasn't clammoring to try this place when I first heard it opened bc of the pricing. Yes, it's basically an uncut maki roll, but it's much bigger in diameter. If you were to cut these, you wouldn't be able to fit one piece in your mouth. I don't even know how they roll it with all the stuff they put in it. These guys are pros.

And they have this cool machine that puts the rice on your nori or soy paper on in seconds! 

Your order goes down the line Chipotle-style and the guys assemble your burrito. Like I said, it's a generous amount of fish. We went on their anniversary day to take advantage of the BOGO special and I was also surprised they didn't skimp on the portions on sale day. Even at full price, while still pricey for lunch, is a much better deal (and better tasting) than supermarket sushi. And let's get real here, the sushi at Whole Foods market isn't that great and it's freaking expensive! Dollar for dollar, this place is more worth it. And more filling than I thought!

Authentic Japanese sushi this is not, but those purists with a stick up their ass can go eat somewhere else. This is America and this is American style sushi, and yes it's good. If you want ""real sushi"" made by a ""real Japanese chef"" and pay $50+ for a tiny meal then be my guest.

First off I was confused by the name some since on yelp and other patrons told me it was called something else, but after I cleared up the confusion I finally found it. The place was a little hard to find because of all the construction, but I'm sure it's only temporary. 

The place is like chipotle. You pick burrito, bowl, nachos, etc....then on top you're choice of protein. New thing for me was a vurrito wrapped in seaweed. They do have a wide selection of sushi and sauces that was fun. You get to add your choice of sauce, vegetables and salsas at the end. Interesting to say the least. 

I tried the yellowtail and spicy tuna with the ponzu sauce. The burrito is a tad on the slim side but overall not bad. I am a bit interested in the other sushis they have, so I'll be back. 

Service was par, we did arrive at a busy time so maybe that was a played a factor in it. Nonetheless, really cool concept! Check it out",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,10,10,4,eG7wxdGL0g9c6LXDI55uTA
2235931,2016-01-22,2,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"I'm not a sushi snob, so this place is perfect to satisfy my occasional cravings. AYCE menus don't interest me and Soho's casual concept allows me to be a picky sushi eater without aggravating a professional sushi chef.

I love how vegan-friendly the menu is here. On my first visit, I selected the Gardein asada as my protein. It was good, but the texture is chewy like meat and I'm not into that. I was very happy to find tofu available on my next trip. I don't like seaweed, so the soy paper wrapper is perfect in place of nori. I also request brown rice and there's no extra charge. See why I'm not welcome at generic sushi bars? They have many sauces available to flavor to your sushi burrito. So far, my favorites are unagi to add sweetness and chipotle mayo, just like I saw at street-side sushi stands in Mexico.

The only thing I miss is my favorite vegetable tempura roll. I would love to see that offered as a special one day. I will mention that my combination of soy paper, brown rice, lots of veggies, and sauces does not create a sturdy burrito. It's very messy with all the ingredients escaping with eat bite. A side of chips comes in handy to scoop up the fallen filler. I tried the taro chips at the recommendation of all social media ever and it worked out well. I'm not a furikake fan, but the sweetness wasn't bad. 

Having cheese sauce available is a nice touch because true Mexican sushi rolls are heavy on the cheese: tres quesos o mas. Also, the prices are very fair, making a Soho SushiBurrito a cheap and fast meal. Sure, you will pay more for seafood, but I appreciate that I'm charged accordingly.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,12,6,4,Sl1iTr_G7-CU0jtT7P7c0w

2321509,2015-12-29,2,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"SOHO SUSHI BURRITO is finally here!!!! 

I was very excited to see that SOHO has opened up their own sushi burrito place. This is the only place like this in Vegas and it is a must try! 

Located on sahara right off the I-15 freeway. Perfect location for anyone staying or working on the strip. It is very easy to find and it is right across the street from the Palace station. When I was there for lunch it did start to get a little busy so if there is a wait, it's worth it trust me! 

When you first walk in, there is a wall with a collection of different articles of Chef John Lee, it was really cool to see his back ground and his journey. He clearly has a passion for food and spoiler you can taste it in the food!! 

The staff is super efficient and fast, so the line will go by fast. I overheard them helping customers with questions as it is a new concept and not everyone understands how to order. When I was ordering they were always generous asking me if it was enough sauce and if I wanted more toppings. 

So if you're new to the concept of sushi burrito, they are like big hand rolls or burritos that you can add sushi ingredients to. To start you can wrap your burrito with either traditional seaweed, soy paper, wheat or flour tortilla. If you don't want a burrito (which is crazy), you can get a rice bowl, salad bowl, or nachos. Also parents I saw they had a kids menu too, and I thought wow how thoughtful. Everything was priced pretty reasonably and it definitely won't break the bank. 

You can opt to create your own as they have tons of selections from proteins, sauces, and to veggies. They also have a menu for house created burritos. The one I chose was the Twin Dragon, which is also a really good roll at the Soho Japanese restaurant. The Twin Dragon burrito includes spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and crab. Have I sold you yet ? Ok the sauce was chipotle mayo and unagi sauce with guacamole, cucumber, lettuce. At first bite I was in heaven.  The burrito wasn't too big or too small as I was able to finish one and feeling satisfied. The sauces tasted so good and house made. Like the spicy tuna was fresh and you can really taste it in the burrito. I also chose soy paper for my burrito and I think I made the right choice, as for me seaweed might have a slight chewy texture for burritos. I honestly want to try every burrito that they have concocted on their menu, they all looked good. I saw they had one with steak and tamago, looks delicious. My friend got a salad bowl with spicy tuna and crab. She said her salad was excellent and she couldn't stop eating it. The bowl size was perfect for her and she didn't leave hungry. I actually was pretty jealous of how great her bowl looked that I will definitely try that next time.

We saw that they had taro chips on the menu and at first we were going to add that with a combo but we decided we were gonna split an order of soho nachos, because why not they are taro chips. They informed us that  they house make their taro chips so I was all over that. We added spicy tuna, onions, pico de gallo, jalape√±os and topped with their super spicy sauce. They were LOVE AT FIRST BITE! Taro chips are better than potato chips way better! And Soho Sushiburrito does them perfectly they seasoned them with furikake, I'm sorry I did not think those would go together but they are life! They do have have the chips as a combo size and they have cheese too yum!! I am very glad we chose to get the bigger portion of nachos because we devoured them. They are the show stopper they were so good I cannot recommend them enough. 

We did however get mochi as a side with drinks. It makes more sense to opt for a combo since they tell you, you save a little money doing that so why not? But mochi seriously?! is there anything they didn't think of. Also they were delicious. 

Thank you Chef John Lee and Soho for bringing this to Vegas, as we definitely need  sushi burritos in our lives.",Uav1HjC3_sZBt3-vN3s6ZA,4,2,5,dILbPDDMfp2x2-Yi8Tbg9Q

You have the option to tell them to leave out certain items and add certain items. It works similar to Chipotle, but with raw fish and Japanese/Mexican additions. Very new idea that has become extremely popular amongst the students at UNLV because it is fun and mainly because of its proximity to the school. It is kind of difficult to find as it blends in with all the local shops amidst the construction in the lot. Just look for the sign that reads SoHo. I would say give it a try if you've never tried it before. While you're at it, grab a side of taro chips. They are quite tasty :9",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,9,5,3,Lpw0cjgOe0bddNg-2kQMPg

My friend and I ordered the 
1) Double dragon
2) 3 Amigos
We took the recommendation and didn't customize. 
Also the taro chips- I know they were recommended but all they really are taro chips with furikake (Japenese topping for rice- nori,salt, sugar, sesame seeds). 

The only thing that makes this place even closely Spanish/Mexican is the fact that they make their rolls looks like burritos (soy vs nori) and they serve nacho cheese with the taro chips (totally unnecessary) 

One of the best parts is the unlimited side bar filled with soy sauce, pickled ginger, jalapenos, wasabi.

I always get the Firecraker (aka previous name: Rosarito) and my boyfriend gets the Triple S (aka previous name: Rockport). I know that is one of their more popular burritos. We also got the taro chips with nacho cheese. The cheese is whatevers. Like what Stefany V said, it's nothing but 7-eleven/stadium nacho cheese. It used to come in a bigger container. Now it's given to us in a small measly condiment cup. The taro chips are pretty good....very good seasoning...heard it's Furikake seasoning? The burritos CAN be a little bit expensive with an average price of $10 per order. BUT....that usually how much an a la carte sushi order is sooooo..... *shrugs* to each their own I guess.

I really wish they can do something about the seating. It can be difficult to snag a table especially if you come during prime time lunch/dinner hours.

It's a tiny place that right now may be a little hard to find because of the construction going on in the plaza, but it's definitely worth it. It's next to the shoe place if that makes it easier. 

The best way I can describe Soho SushiBurrito is a mix of Cafe Rio and Chipotle... except with Japanese ingredients. Doesn't make sense? Well basically all the ingredients are laid out for you to choose (or you can choose an item from the menu) and it's rolled into a burrito. So think sushi rolled into a big burrito a la Chipotle style. 

The most pleasant surprise for me was the Taro chips. You can choose from traditional or furikake flavored and it even comes with yellow nacho cheese sauce. I tried the Furikake with the cheese (like nachos) and it was an interesting mix of flavors. Not bad, just interesting. 

I like the place and highly recommend it because I'm a sushi lover... And this place makes eating sushi convenient and neat.

There are options on the menu for ""pre-made"" burritos, bowls etc. if you prefer not to make your own custom creation.

They have a friendly attentive staff who quickly make the sushi burritos to order.  I prefer the soy paper to nori as my wrapper of choice, and the team there always has what I want on hand.  The decor is modest but warm, and it feels organic and natural.  The dining area is small, but they do make orders to go if you are in a hurry or need to get back to work or home.  The interior is bright and clean with lots of sunshine (well, it will be once the outdoor construction ends).  But the real reason I go here is the food.

The sushi burritos are outstanding, and cover a wide range of flavors and textures.  The hand rolls to try are the Triple S, Twin Dragon, and 3Amigos.  The Triple Dragon features spicy tuna, crab, and shrimp tempura, which are three flavors that work well together.  The soft tuna plays well against the crunchy shrimp, and all of the ingredients play well together (lettuce, guac, cucumber, crispy wonton, spicy mayo, unagi sauce),  Most rolls are at or under $10 and are quite large, so you are getting very good value for your dollar.   You can order the food as a burrito, or as a bowl or even nachos (which I will try next time).  You can choose one of their rolls, or make your own, and the also have selections for vegetarians and even for kids.

The also have the ""veggie"" option. I love this place for even catering to the vegan weirdos, like me, of the world. They were out of the vegan chipotle sauce...

Both of us really like some crunch... And the taro chips are pretty freaking good. They are made in house... And I would totally consider having some of them crumbled into my next burrito.

The components were fresh and the service was quick considering all the customizing going on. I always opt to build my own and it's usually using shrimp tempura as my protein (it's basic but I love it whatever) and I loved that they heat up the shrimp before assembling the burrito. The crab salad is good and so is the soy paper. There plenty of sauces to choose from and the Yuzu soy is really good. They even have a machine to tighten up the burrito so it doesn't explode while eating like it would at chipotle. Price is great and good value to get a ""sushi"" fix in a hurry. 

My last visit wasn't so great. Also a shrimp tempura option and I felt rushed this time so I didn't notice till it was too late that it was cold tempura and when the girl who seemed visually annoyed from the start asked 4 times what my sauces were after I said one second let me read them. I chose two sauces and she DOUSED my burrito with sauces so the whole thing was soggy and I couldn't taste any of the other extras I had paid for. I realize they're not cooks or anything but just some common sense when you put them together. Would you wanna eat a burrito soaking in Yuzu soy? Probably not.

My experience with Soho was the complete opposite! I had a simple build-your-own style sushirito. Each component was extremely fresh and I was perfectly full after my last bite. I personally don't have a huge appetite so unless you really stuff your burrito, I can see how it might feel small to others.

To have paid about $10-12 per roll isn't too bad considering what sushi costs on its own.

The angry salmon was great. Fish was fresh and the flavors were good. Could have used a little eel sauce or spicy mayo to push it over the edge to incredible. The twin dragon on the other hand was overly sweet presumably due to too much eel sauce. The minced tuna that was in there wasn't very fresh tasting either so we had to kind of squeeze that out of the roll to make it edible. Soda fountain and four different kinds of peak iced tea. Dining area is basic but clean. Will probably come back to try out the other rolls.

After walking inside you'll see the station where you order your food, and where they make it.  Up above is a full menu of pre-made burritos and also your option to build your own.  After going through reviews on Yelp, I decided to go with the Twin Dragon burrito, with everything.  It literally took like 3 minutes for them to make the burrito!  

Twin Dragon - The flavor is definitely there, it's so tasty.  The added won ton chips (I think) add texture to the burrito, and the seaweed wrap and sushi rice make it even more enjoyable.  A bit on the messy side close to the ends of the burrito but nothing a good ol' fork can't take care of.

This place is a Japanese Chipotle-style joint. They have set items that you can choose from, whether it's a bowl or a burrito, but you can also customize your own. They have so many sauces/condiments that you can choose from as well; it was a bit overwhelming, and the workers were not helpful in explaining each of the sauces or which one paired well with what. 

Got the Twin Dragon burrito which included shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab which is imitation crab, lettuce, cucumber, guacamole, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo, and unagi sauce wrapped in seaweed. I also told them to add salmon sashimi in my burrito. It was pretty good. The vegetables were fresh, and the shrimp tempura and the wonton strips gave a nice crunch to the burrito.

I had the Lion King, which had salmon and tempura, two of my tried and trues. If you're not into an overwhelming taste of seaweed, I recommend going with the soy wrap. I ordered the seaweed, which is normally fine on a sushi roll but it was a little much on a burrito. That did not detract from my overall experience though. We also tried the taro chips with queso, which were always very good. Mimi loved her burrito bowl as did Sis and her sushi burrito.

That was a negative for me but they told me that they can get me out of there in a timely manner.   Upon arriving there was a line.  I want to say I had about ten people in front of me.  They were moving customers in an adequate amount of time.  

I ended up ordering the 3 amigos on soy paper with cream cheese.  This usually comes with a wasabi aioli sauce which isn't a bad mix to this burrito.  I think that it would work well with its spicy mayo as well.  That will be for next time.  I also ordered their taro chips.  If you don't get anything, at least try the taro chips.  They are awesome.  It's sprinkled with a Furikake Seasoning.  

My burrito was pretty good.  The blend of the different ingredient was like having a party in my mouth.  Just a whole lot of flavor and texture happening.

Will I come back again?  Of course!

With that being said, Happy Eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,1,4,3-ipcOyzPlYThaCi-J5JLw

I went at 2PM on a Saturday, and there was still a long line for their delicious food (though the line moves quickly).. You are allowed a choice between soy paper or seaweed paper topped with a layer of sticky rice.  You can then pick individual ingredients (Chipotle style), or you can ask for a premade combination.  Picking individual ingredients can get complicated if you are unfamiliar, so I just opted to go with premade.  I tried the high maintenance and the 3 amigos, both of which were tasty.  I think the high maintenance had more flavor, but the 3 amigos had more quantity of fresh fish.  The masago was also yummy.  The portion is perfect and the food is healthy.

Someone else had accidentally picked up my friend's burrito at the end of the line, so that my friend ended up with the wrong burrito.  When my friend brought it up to the cashier, they apologized and made him the right one immediately (while letting him keep the wrong order). I thought that this was professional and nice.

1. So many options to choose from. Knowing what you'd like to eat prior to the arrival would help a lot. Especially if you have very limited time. 

2. Food tastes great. 

3. Size per portion is just enough. Some might need more than 1 order. 

Con:
1. Cleanliness needs some more attention. Especially on dining table. I had to ask a bottle of cleaning chemical to the cashier since the table was so dirty & I had a 2 YO daughter with us. She gave us a cleaning rag instead. 

2. Lacking of basic knowledge of cleanliness/sanitation. 
What concerned me the most, is that when she gave me the cleaning rag, it was passed over our food. That's a huge No No in food industry. 

3. Man's restroom was not lockable. I accidentally opened the door when a kid was using it. I suggested the kid to lock the door when he uses the restroom. Yet, when I tried to lock the door, it wasn't successful. 

What if there was a pedophile taking advantage on that kid since you fail to maintain the basic safety toward your patrons. God forbids on that. Restroom need to be check hourly & documented for the cleanliness, functions, & its safety.

I got:  
* Sushi Rice Wrap

* Meat - Ahi Tuna ($7.50), Fresh Salmon (additional meat = $1.5)

* Sides/Toppings (free & no limit) - Cilantro, Corn, Red Onion, Tempura Crunch, Crispy Wonton Strips, Cucumber, Furikake 

* Sauce - Wasabi Aioli

* Extra - Cream Cheese (50 cents)

Total = $10.29

[PROS]
* I was satisfied w/ my order. It was yummy & filling 
* The cream cheese was totally worth it & made it even better
* The fish was fresh & they serve a generous amount
* They're open on Sundays now. I was bummed that they were closed on Sundays, but now that they're open, I definitely plan on eating here  after church or something

[CONS]
* Their menu is a little overwhelming just looking at it (especially as a newbie). But, once you get their concept, it's pretty cool & unique
* It's a bit messy/dirty inside. Although we went there near closing time, I was a little bothered at how messy it was
* It's quite loud inside. Not sure if it's the music or just the acoustics in their restaurant, but I had to speak louder than normal to have a conversation w/ my party
* Although I enjoyed my roll, it tasted no different than a regular sushi hand roll.. But just wrapped & the size of a burrito

For the price, the portion is absolutely huge. Think about it- a sushi roll at an average sushi restaurant is at least $10... For that price, you could have a JUMBO roll in sushi burrito form! They aren't skimpy when they're making your burrito either. They want you to be happy!

The service here is so friendly and polite. They do write which burrito is which once it is wrapped so no need to worry if you're ordering multiples. I haven't made my own burrito yet because I like the ""premade"" ones so much. The new spam musubi burrito is amazing as well. Don't forget to order some taro chips at the register! 

I have nothing negative to say about their food and service. They have something for everyone (if you don't like fish, they have meat or a tofu/veggie option; if you don't like seaweed, they have a soy wrap option, etc etc). This place is amazing and if you like sushi and you haven't hit this place up yet, you are missing out- plain and simple.",mXXOE3bYMw-GAV4-cgGwTA,2,0,5,zP-FVvXVjMU4fVU1YF1GNw

You can also build your own burrito or bowl ( concept is similar to chipotle) and choose your protein, veg, white/brown rice, etc. comes out to about 10-15per burrito depending on how extravagant you want to get. 

Also, the person who docked stars from this restaurant because they didn't serve corn or flour tortillas should really reconsider their review.

You'll notice the Maneki-Neko (Japanese Cats Figurines) which is seen throughout the establishment with Sombreros hanged on the walls.

Got a bag of Taro Chip-Cheddar Cheese Flavor with Cheddar Cheese dipping sauce. (Highly recommend the Taro Chip-simply delicious!). Our bowls was very consistent and filling and the fish was very fresh. Especially the Ahi Tuna and Salmon.

The size is pretty good and the fish to rice ratio was just right. They don't rip you off by filling up the burrito with more rice than fish.

I really do like this place. The fish quality is pretty good; I've not had anything that tastes fishy, just fresh. What really is amazing is the amount of food you get for the dollar. A $10 Twin Dragon and I am almost uncomfortably full. 

My favorites are the Angry Tuna and Twin Dragon. Also, pro tip, get the soy paper as it makes the burrito easier to eat. You can make a big thick cut sushi roll with nori, but it's too chewy/stretchy for me.

The way it works is Subway style, you walk up and order what you want through an assembly line.  My third visit here, but first under Soho, I went with the same and my personal favorite customized order which consists of the seaweed wrapper, sushi rice, and I chose tuna and salmon with cucumber, green onions, seaweed salad, and poke sauce.  When I order a custom roll this is what I get also but seaweed salad on the side.  They have specialized burritos you can choose from as well if you don't know what you want.  I do think it's cool how the rice dispencer works though, spreads it out evenly on the sushi wrap.

Also added surimi crab for only an extra $1.50!  Not a bad deal for under $7!  Added a side of shiso tomatillo sauce for FREE!  Really though if you ask, they will let you have a side of just about any of their sauces, gratis.

Tasty!  Even after the travel it had to take from the restaurant back to my work office!  So surprising, sushi...in a burrito!  I thought it would have been too big to enjoy like regular sushi, but you can bite into this bugger easily like it's a huge hand roll!  Ingredients were fresh too.  The nori wrapper wasn't soggy, rice was cooked well, and the spicy tuna and surimi crab were well seasoned.  The fresh cucumber, cabbage, and crispy wonton strips added much needed texture.  The sweet but tangy honey habanero sauce added some nice kick!  Their shiso tomatillo sauce was an easy add too, I recommend it.  Like a tomatillo salsa with an added umami element.

The burrito was big enough I only managed to eat half.  Took the other half for the wifey to try!  She thought the concept was strange at first too, but after her first bite of leftovers she was sold.  She liked it very much!

I think a visit is in order to Soho SushiBurrito again in the near future for some Asian inspired eats!

4025214,2016-11-19,1,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"Firstly, this place is my favorite sushi burrito place in town. BUT TODAY, today was just horrible. Consistency is key. I did the B.Y.O sushi burrito and I got seaweed wrap, soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, unagi sauce, and sweet chipotle sauce. Usually when I order this everything is distributed evenly. The sauce was dripping out and couldn't even tell what I had inside of the burrito. It was not appetizing. I really hope they stay consistent with their orders. I would still come back. Maybe today was just a bad day and maybe they just had new employees. :( Other days it would be 4-5 stars but today is a 1 but giving them an extra star because they're amazing all the other times I've visited. I just couldn't eat my other half of my burrito. Smh. Very disappointed.

They have quality ingredients though and the staff is very nice. 

We ordered online and it took 15-20 minutes until it was ready for pick up, which is average for fast food, though they weren't very busy inside.

We placed our order online for pickup and I really like that they give you the option to build your own with everything you want in it, especially because I am kind of a picky sushi eater... 

At first I was kind of taken back by the pricing, ($11.50 for my custom burrito) but then I realized that when I go to all you can eat sushi is around $24.50 so I was really saving money, right??

Any who. The burrito was amazing and super super filling!

4053204,2017-01-31,8,B_WggEKFq-ZFNui8CHPYvA,"When I think of poke, I don't think sushi burrito. 

When I think sushi, I don't think sushi burrito. 

When I think ESPN's Sportscenter, I think of Soho SushiBurrito.

I know, it sounds odd. The SH for Soho looks very similar to SC for Sportscenter. Now that I got that off my chest, let's discuss what Soho SushiBurrito is known for and that's, you guessed it, a sushi burrito. I've been here a couple of times and recently brought some friends here. They totally loved Soho. They loved the assembly line ordering process, the different sushi burrito options, the price, and of course, the taste of their meals. It was my friend's recommendation to come here.  And prior to ordering, they wanted to know exactly what a sushi burrito is.  My response...just a bigger sushi hand roll. That's really all a sushi burrito is, right? The difference is that you get a lot more in sushi burrito than you do a sushi hand roll.  I really can't hate on this place or any of the other sushi burrito spots in town because people love this stuff.  We sure have a lot of them coming up and they all tend to taste the same to me. Just don't come here expecting super high quality poke or sushi.  The quality comes with the price and in my opinion, the price is pretty good.  The other good news is that the sushi is fresh and the toppings are almost endless. I will get mine with just salmon or spicy tuna with imitation crab meat and chipotle mayo.  I'll eliminate the rice and go straight seaweed when I want to keep my starches down.  My sushi burrito is pretty good and cost about $10. My only issue is that the food here is not filling.  Take my advice and don't come here hungry.  

The service is great.  Soho is very popular and there's almost always a line.  The employees are always efficient and extremely patient with peeps that get to the line undecided. Be on the lookout for a table because they fill up quick.  

NOVICE TIP:  If you're not into fish or sushi, then check out their taro nachos, chicken burritos, and steak burritos

Service: 5/5 I was thoroughly impressed with the efficiency of the assembly line crew that put together my sunny salmon sushi burrito.  They were friendly even though they were extremely busy.
Food: 4/5 The Sunny Salmon Sushiburrito was tasty and not messy to eat for a sushi burrito.  The burrito was packed tight to keep the eating easy.  Ingredients were fresh. The seaweed salad I had with my combo could have been fresher, but definitely not an issue.
Value: 5/5 The combo of my Sunny Salmon Sushiburrito, seaweed salad, and UCC grean tea drink was $11.94 before tax and tip for a savings .50 vs a la carte.
Summary:  Service and food has been consistently good from my previous visits.  The seating is limited so I usually take my food to go versus sitting down.  I noticed on this visit that Uber eats delivers for them and it might be something I'll consider when the schedule is tight.  A great place for SushiBurritos to go",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,2,0,4,UK8FRjtN_c9VrpItccaJsQ

So it was my first time here and right off the bat I was super confused with the entrance. The exterior of the store is under construction so don't be fooled, they are open! Besides that, once you walk in, the place is super welcoming filled with positive vibes. 

As for the food, the Three Amigos is pretty fail proof. It is packed with a plethora of fish with a kick of wasabi aoli. Its super refreshing. However, I love a little more spice and crunch in my palette, so the Triple ""S"" is my favorite! The Twin Dragon would be my choice for something in between the two :)

The process was fairly easy, but I could definitely see how there could be a wait if it was during a rush. My bowl was ok. The rice was hard and was almost like it was last nights rice. The salmon was ok too and they charged me extra for sliced avocado since I didn't want the guacamole.

I appreciate Chef John's idea to change the name to make better sense for the die hard fans from Soho. I like seeing the familiar faces as some of the workers are here during the day and at Soho at night. Along with changing the name, the decor matches the original restaurant and the prices of the burritos are a little cheaper as well. 

What's been blowing my mind is getting a double decker version of any burrito.

Today, finally, yes, hubby (didn't seem interested, when I mentioned it to him, but said I ""didn't tell him it was like Chipotle"") got me takeout, the Fire Cracker burrito @ $5.25 (spicy tuna, cucumber, lettuce, cabbage, crispy wonton strips, honey habanero sauce, sweet chipotle mayo) on seaweed paper. I am savoring this yummy meal. I admit it, sometimes, I eat fast. Not now, it's too good, so I'm trying to make it last. I succeeded. It was amazing. 

I love the concept of fusion food (Braddah's---sad face, we'll miss that place, the food truck Truknyaki is the bomb, but a bit elusive) but few live up to the hype and excitement (Komex was good, but...). Not the case with this joint. I love sushi but I this was the first time I ever had a sushi burrito and it was a yummy experience (if I get a burrito at traditional mexican restaurants, I don't usually finish it, 'cause it's too big of a meal for me). I feel satisfied but my belly doesn't feel like it's full of bricks. (No likey.)

I am Pinay so I do love my food medium spicy, especially nowadays, because of my restricted diet (low sodium) monday through friday. My lips were tingling but that is exactly the way I like it. Spicy tuna is also one of my favorites, which was tasty. All the ingredients seem to compliment each other very well. It was all exactly in the right proportion too. Listen, there was nothing I disliked about this sushi burrito. It was perfection. I would get it again.

I would like to try some of the other items on the menu or maybe even create my own combo (build your own). Hubby wants to try it too. Like Chipotle, you choose between the burrito, bowl or nachos and select the proteins, sauce, fixings, etc. Also serves Vegetarian, Kids menu and sides (taro chips, edamame, miso soup, seaweed salad, & mochi ice cream).",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,5,5UYLzpgXlxP-jhbR9tpCvw

Here is the thing: to me, sushi burritos are kind of just very large handrolls. I can see the novelty and it is cool that you can customize it. But I am really not the hugest fan. I love sushi and I love burritos and maybe I choose too ""safe"" of a sushi burrito but I did not see what the big woop is about. My spicy tuna was not as fresh as I normally like it to be.

I figured it would taste like a giant roll or something like that. And maybe let me just chill out on my sushi craving for a while. 

The two items I ordered (view pictures) were good, but it was no substitute for a roll or sushi for me. Silly me...kinda kicked myself in the butt for my skewed expectations after-the-fact. I think had I had no expectations of that sort, I would've had a different experience. But, my dining patron agreed, so I'm not too crazy after all. 

I liked the taro chips very much...still don't understand how that got paired with melted nacho cheese sauce, and I for sure skipped it. I say, give it a shot.

The rolls are more expensive, smaller and definitely not as good. 
The place was packed, the line was about 10 minutes long when I went in on Saturday night. The kids working behind the counter were working hard so I have no complaints there. However, the smell of raw fish was way too strong for me to comfortably sit and eat there. I had to take it to go- also it was unbearably hot inside. Hot temps and the smell of raw fish?

Nonetheless the burritos are the same but some of the signature items are a dollar or two cheaper 

If you like their facebook or instagram page you get a free salmon nigiri pen !

Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. 

Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.

Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). Loads of options to add to your burritos so take advantage of it. 

Service: Friendly and willing to explain how their menu works. Previously half of my burrito fell on the floor but they did not hesitate to bring me a new whole burrito :)

Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.

Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Soho burrito has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,6,2,4,z7kUaOlLudlYfGtsvXzh-g

In addition to finding this place close by, I was able to view the menu online AND I was able to order online.  I paid online too.  I ordered exactly what I wanted, how I wanted it.  It was great.  I ordered a sushi'rito bowl.  I practically ordered whatever fish they had on the menu, like salmon, tuna, yellowtail, unagi and crab. You can choose whatever protein you want and whatever rice you want.  You get so many options.  I think my eyes got really big when I kept clicking on the items. I ordered all kinds of toppings also.  My bowl was huge.  I was extremely full after eating my meal.  It doesn't sound filling but it definitely is.  After all, this was my lunch and I was still full as dinner passed by.  My only gripe is that of course, after your eyes are big and your stomach is hungry and you went click happy on all the options, everything has a steep price.  I didn't end up spending a lot because I was out of town and I wanted to try everything in one sweep.  Yes, this did cost me quite a bit more had I just gone with a traditional option. Just be aware of that if you choose the build your own option. Be mindful of your wallet not only your craving.

The service was friendly and they treated you more than just a customer.  If you didn't know what to order they were more than willing to help you out and give you suggestions based on whatever you were craving at the time.

If you haven't been there before, it's like Chipotle for sushi burritos.  You can make your own, where they have an extensive menu where you can have ""whatever you liiiike"" (in the voice of T.I.).  They offer brown rice!  They offer various protein options for the non-raw sushi eaters!  And you can't go wrong with picking any of their specially made sauces like wasabi aioli and chipotle mayo?!  With the ENDLESS possibilities, I was hooked. 

Although I like the idea of creating the most amazing sushi burrito, I find myself ordering off their tried and true masterpieces.  If you ate there before the name change, you might notice the menu is different.  Don't be alarmed, the sushi burritos got a bit of a name change too.  The staff informed me that the Redondo is now the 3 Amigos and the Rockport is now Triple S.  So if you're looking for any of the old stuff, they can still make it for you!  One of the staff, Princess, recommended the Lion King, which was also very good, and comes with grilled salmon for those who don't like sushi.  

They also offer free condiments near the register.  Their house made soy sauce is thicker than normal, but it definitely helped kick the food up a notch.  They also offer salsa and wasabi.

Wait time isn't too bad, despite the long lines.  I think the max I had to wait was 15 minutes, but it goes by quick.  I also like how they have a machine that evenly distributes the rice onto the seaweed/soy paper.  I also came in to order 5 sushi burritos, and the staff was fast, friendly, and efficient.  The average sushi burrito is about $10, which I think is justifiable.  It's big enough to be considered a meal and offers quality that you can taste. 

My only gripe is that there isn't enough seating since it's always packed!  I've taken it to-go every time that I've gone.  But other than that, Soho Sushi Burritos is great!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,11,8,4,53e7rTolmZqMBizOgGDBFQ

After seeing my friends in SD, LA, and SF post their sushi-burritos, I am happy to have experienced a similar indulgence here in Las Vegas.

Came on Saturday around 1:40pm and the line was close to the door. It was about 2:15 when I reached the front. The concept is similar to Chipotle except you can either pick a menu combo or create your own (price is a la carte). I had the 3Amigos on seaweed with sushi rice which was delicious. If you're not a fan of wasabi, like me, the aioli surprisingly adds a nice underlying and vague taste which enhanced the burrito. Best part are the little crunchies! It was definitely filling without making you feel full.

It's like the Chipotle of sushi & burritos. Custom make your own or get one of their signature burritos.
A tip for custom orders: type out your selections in a list on your phone so you can rattle off the items without forgetting & holding up the line :)
There are so many times I'd love to get sushi for lunch but don't have time to sit at a proper sushi bar so this is the answer to my lunchtime prayers.
Include an order of taro chips with your meal.

Now I just need more locations to open up. Hey Soho, I think your Yelpers will come out in droves to support any/all new locations!

One friendly piece of advice to the management: have a staff advisor available for consultation before the ordering station to help with figuring out suitable options (there are so many!). Information on the board is helpful, but the board does not answer questions. And by the time a server behind the stall attempts to answer any question (and trust me, you will have quite a few), there is already a huge pressure to choose something quickly because the line of hungry folks behind is too long.

I have heard of sushi burritos in California, I guess it is a very popular food truck. I was skeptical but all my friends say it's so good and to find out there is one Vegas I had to try it. 

I had the high maintenance burrito, which had yellowtail and spicy tuna. I absolutely love yellowtail and this one caught my eye. The only thing is I had to ask for no masago, I just can't get past the texture.  

Ok so I definitely understand the craze about these things. They are delicious!! The fish is very fresh and I was surprised and I thought to myself should I get more sauce? But it actually was very good. The creamy cilantro sauce was really good but I do want to try something spicier next time. I also got a side of their taro chips with cheese. The cheese was good but honestly these chips don't need them. They have this salty sweet seasoning to them that make them so addicting like I needed a bigger bag! I killed them! 

So I went with their preselected menu for the burrito but I will for sure create my own next time. I saw they had bowls too but the burrito is pretty filling.  

The seating is limited but it's a small place , I don't think they could fit anymore tables or chairs. The staff was fast and they were informative.

I'm glad to report it is because they are ridiculously good. As in, I drive from the other side of town just to get one of these babies.

I'd absolutely do the same again. 

Hubby can't even remember what he got. He simply asked for what was most popular. What it was, I actually loved it. Raw fish and all. I'm pretty sure it was something with crab and tuna.

I'm told, originators of the sushi burrito concept...and damn happy they are.  I've been coming here for a few years now. yes, even through the upgrades at mall... I think for the most part they consistently keep the same staple menu items/favorites like the firecracker, twin dragon, triple s ,etc...if not.. you can make your own from scratch.

I do like that they have a flour/wheat tortilla option available for us fatty's =)  YESSS... a must...makes me feel i'm getting my $'s worth for my belly. 

Staff is always helpful and let you take your time so that they can get it right...the ingredients are always in stock...unlike other place.  I'm not sure why SOHO is always just a bit better than the competitors..it's like they are always on point with ingredients...

The combination of my ingredients was essentially a salmon, avocado, cuc roll with some wasabi aioli (? I think that's what it was), with krab and lettuce. I would get it again! 

I was told the high maintenance was good but very filling. 

The menu is a little overwhelming and there's little room to stall once you're up to order, so make sure you know what you want before jumping into line. 

One point of contention for me was the salmon. It looked very pale. I wish I would have asked more to learned about where its from and how it's raised. If the owners see this I'd love to hear about it.

Choose from seaweed,  soy paper or tortilla wrapper. Then get it filled with delicious fresh sushi goodness such as spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, tobiko, grilled salmon, cucumber, avocado or other non-traditional sushi toppings such as pico de gallo, chipotle mayo, tomatillo sauce and guacamole.

They really cram these sushi burritos full of stuff, no skimping going on here.

There are small portion and appropriately priced sides like seaweed salad, edamame and bags of seasoned taro chips.

Flavors are bold and ingredients are fresh. Nothing on the menu has disappointed. The Twin Dragon is particularly good, but if you don't fancy one of the menu options you can get creative and build your own.

Just about the perfect fast-casual lunch spot. Once you try this you may have a hard time going back to Chipotle. Addictive, but thankfully light on the wallet.

This place is amazing, from the chill atmosphere, to the welcoming staff wrapping the protein packed deliciousness of their burritos.  Both burritos that I had tonight (Sunny Salmon with Seaweed wrap and Lion King with soy wrap) were loaded up with tons of fresh ingredients.  

Sunny Salmon consists of Salmon, Surimi Crab, cream cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, crispy wonton strips and Shiso tomatillo sauce for me it tasted a little dry and too healthy(lol) like a huge wrapped salad think it needed more sauce or dressing.

The Lion King however was perfect (for me) and the star of the evening loaded with Grilled Salmon, lettuce, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango soy, furkake and sweet chipotle mayo. 

 I will be back to try the other burritos and for that sweet chipotle mayo thinking I might substitute that out in the Sunny Salmon next time. 

Definitely recommend checking this place out,  oh yeah they also have beer available for those that might like something more than a fountain drink. :)",u6wAG4h60a0vOikJ1wtjcg,3,2,5,pUruzvcw5KK7rUmZ-XGTSg

I had the 3 Amigos which contained three different fishes (ahi tuna, yellowtail, and salmon). I thought the portion of fishes was good and I didn't feel like the portion of rice was significantly greater. It wasn't overly salty or saucy which I prefer because I like the taste of the raw fish. My boyfriend got the Twin Dragon which was decent. It was a little too creamy for my taste.

I chose to get the burrito since that seemed to be the most popular. I went with the high maintenance without red onions. I added grilled corn and spinach ( trying to be healthy you know) and added the wasabi aioli as well. Instead of Guac... Which I thought it was kind of weird, they were able to substitute it with avocado instead.   The burrito had yellowtail and spicy tuna. It was so good!  I thought the fish was really fresh and loved all taste of the combo together.

The sushi burrito.

Basically an uncut makisushi roll stuffed full with west coast poke bowl ingredients. 

Straight up, everyday ingredients.  No organic this or line caught that.  Fish is previously frozen, gassed and color added. Crab is Krab.   Everyday rice.  Sushi rice is sticker than most, brown rice, the inexpensive kind that makes noobs cringe with its nutty flavor.

Loads of poke bowl ingredients, some cooked, some raw, some different (grilled steak or deep fried soft shell crab, roasted corn, pico de gallo) and loads of them.  Fillings make up 90% of the roll.  Don't worry, a machine compacts the roll and seals everything in.

First timers opt for premade rolls, good flavor with the right choice of fillings.  Adventurous, opt for do it yourself.  Choose a wrapper (nori, soy paper, or tortilla), rice (sushi, brown, unseasoned white), protein, sauce, and veg.

Be creative and go crazy.  It's part of the fun.  Let's just say a soft shell crab and unagi with creamy cilantro sauce, jalepeno peppers, avocado, and seaweed salad killed it!  Bravo me!

Very fast, friendly, off Strip service.  Good prices.  All options sub $10.

Today at lunch, I've seen nothing but struggle and bad customer service. I love this place - don't get me wrong. The firecracker is so spicy and delicious, I crave it in my sleep. I never come here during the lunch rush since I don't like to drive hungry/hangry. My co-workers and bosses wanted some sushi burrito so we decided that i'd snack beforehand and venture. SO this review not based on HANGRY-me's interlude. The place was hoppin'. The line was long, but they were moving along. Diligent worker bees they are. The problems are listed below:

1. The person who does the rice part seemed to care more about making nice with her co-workers than she cared to be polite with the customers. 
  - This isn't some street food join, have some respect.

2. There were two people dealing with the insides of the burrito as well as the forming and wrapping of it. They seemed really hasty and one guy pretty much didn't care how it rolled. Needless to say, some of our burritos fell apart...

3. The guy writing the orders on the wrappers - he was screwing up big time leaving the cashier guy really really pissed. The order before us seemed to be wrong and the cashier had to open one of their burritos and couldn't figure it out so he had to make another one on the fly..making the wait longer. 

4. The cashier guy had a face that easily left a bad taste in my co-workers mouth. She also didn't appreciate the fact that he was opening up all these burritos with his cash-handled hands, wrapping it back up, and serving it to us. I get that it's really annoying that the guy before you is screwing up on writing the orders properly, but I feel like if you're handling money, you shouldn't handle the food.

All of our burritos fell apart, but we enjoyed the taste. Just wish that they knew how to handle the lunch rush without any issues.

The guy writing on the wrappers though..he needs to learn to code the burritos correctly so people get charged correctly and ALSO so that the cashier doesn't have to open it up.

Tastes good, but service needs a bit of work.

This place is really popular though, maybe an expansion is in order for the weekdays! - Just kidding, what do I know about business.",QQTUBWVFJSsWvv_JCr2z2Q,0,0,2,7eHZE1jaayJCb2dh9eTpqw

In addition to being a creature of habit, I'm also kinda particular. I've never been disappointed here. They don't care that I don't want sauce and ask them to douse my bowl with straight sriracha. They happily add avocado, gently reminding me that it's an additional .50. Of course, guys and gals. I don't mind paying you extra for avo. They recently added diced mango to the list of toppings. Quinoa, too, but it's extra even if you don't get rice. I'd like to take this moment to suggest putting quinoa as an alternative to rice with no upcharge. I'm going grain free, guys. It's only another extra .50, but it's a small scoop and I gotta get my carbs somehow. 

The ahi and salmon are always fresh and plentiful, as are the veggies. I've never had an issue with the fish. I've never had an issue with anything here. Burritos never seem to fall apart, even when stuffed full. There isn't much room to sit and typical times for the rushes are busy. The staff handles it.

Well just so happened that my family and I needed to grab lunch before an appointment to go wedding dress shopping and just so happen that this place was right across the street from the boutique. I figured why not give it a shot since this place has such great reviews. I was pleasantly surprised! There were four of us and each of us got a different sushirito; all were wonderful. Portions sizes left you satisfied, and not overly stuffed. Great balance of flavors in their signature rolls.

Brown rice, white rice, sushi rice, salad, tofu + your choice of protein (salmon, surimi, tuna, chicken, steak, veggie asada, tempura, soft shell crab...you get the idea) + veggies and texture enhancers (crunch, wontons) + sauce.

They're pretty chill with substitutions as long as it's of similar category - like green onions instead of red onions. Don't expect them to swap your red onions with spicy tuna - life doesn't work that way!

My item was the firecracker bowl and I customized it to add baby spinach, mixed greens, pico, tempura crunch and guacamole ($.50). So I picked up my order and was excited to eat my bowl and I saw the ticket order taped to it. But once I opened the bowl up none of my added items were in the bowl!!!! No guacamole that I paid extra for. No greens, spinach, pico, or tempura crunch. I was kinda disappointed because I placed an online order clearly stating what I wanted in my bowl and none of that made it in there. It was still good nonetheless but I still wanted my items added in there.

I come here pretty often and have for the last year or so - twice a month at the least but usually more. I've got quite the appetite as I usually don't get the chance to eat during the day, so I like to get 3 or 4 servings of fish. 

The problem? Apparently knowing how to count isn't exactly common sense anymore. One serving is three scoops, so if I order quadruple, I should end up with twelve, yeah? Nope, not here. I have to mention it literally every single time. You get charged extra for extra fish, which is completely fine - just give me what you're charging me for. Not a huge deal, but over the last year and easily 30+ visits, they've probably only done it right the first time once or twice.

There's also some premade items on the menu for you to choose from as well. We got the twin dragon, which comes with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, crispy wonton strips, unagi sauce and sweet chipotle mayo. I opted for the DIY so I got salmon, yellowtail, chipotle mayo, baby spinach, cilantro, cucumbers, roasted corn and cream cheese.

This place is incredible - think fresh sushi served at a fast food assembly line pace. 

It's like you want a quick and healthy sushi meal but without the hassle of sitting down and waiting on service. Before Soho, the idea of fast food sushi never sounded appealing because of the freshness factor. Here, what they do is have the fresh ingredients in front of you as you put together a custom meal or choose from one of their premade selections.

On this visit, instead of a custom, tried two signature Sushi Burritos: Twin Dragon (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, crab, guac, chipotle mayo) & 3 Amigos (ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon).  Of the two, I can't say one was better than the other - both so delicious.  

Twin Dragons ($10.50) got a nice kick from the mayo and spicy tuna, as well as more of a crunch texture from the tempura.  Meanwhile, I loved the 3 Amigos ($10.95) for having the variety of proteins and still being able to have a clean and light flavor - it didn't at all feel heavy after finishing the whole thing. 

I'll be coming back and to try more burritos and have again, the all-day Sapporo happy hour ($3 draft from the Katana sword handle)

 You can order one of their specialties or build your own custom sushi burrito.   They have a lot of different options and toppings which is much appreciated.   I really liked their side bar with soy sauce, wasabi, etc.   They also gave a large variety of sides to choose from.  We got the furikake taro chips.   Good but a little hard to eat as the chips are very think.   The cheese sauce they come with is pretty good if not a little boring. 

My problem was that the sushi burrito seemed pretty flavorless.  We tried the 3 amigos, angry tuna, a California, and a salmon bowl.   Of the 3 three salmon bowl had the most flavor (but we also still had to add quite a bit of soy sauce.)

I also love their other restaurant Soho Sushi. In my mind Soho SushiBurrito had all the potential in the world but they fell short, way short. It may be that I have already decided exactly how the perfect Sushi Burrito should taste, and the options were too far from what I'm used to. Maybe it was that I felt the quality of the ingredients were not the same quality as their other store. Maybe it was a combination of the two but I feel the taste and quality were lacking.

I will admit, I may be a one off because even during construction going on at the strip mall they were packed with people who all seemed to be enjoying themselves.

I'm not entirely sure if the staff is as into the greeting as they seem but that's a good thing! I love their shouting enthusiasm. I'm not always greeted as warm when they are building my bowl or sushi burrito but I will take what I can get. 90% of the time the guys and gals behind the glass genuinely ask how my day is going and that's a real nice thing to do.

They have quite a large amount of offerings from steak and tempura shrimp to chipotle mayo and queso. That's right. They have queso. I watched the guy ahead of me build his own bowl with steak, queso, and all the fixings. He was a genius. This time around I ordered myself the FIRECRACKER: Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Lettuce, Cabbage, Crispy Wonton Strips, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Honey. It's packed with flavor and wild with texture. I opted for the soy paper this time and it was quite nice. This was my favorite roll so far. I had the 3 Amigos last time and it wasn't my favorite.

The Taro Chips are a must. I love how crunchy they are and the three flavor options are nom-nom. My favorite is the furikake flavor and a major bonus is that is comes with a small side of queso for dipping. That's right, I said it again. Queso.

The food itself, yeah it's good!
The service on the other hand, not so much.
The line where the food was being prepared was just a little messy and all over the place.
They've only been open for a few months so they may get better in time. 

Another concern that I had was that it was difficult to choose from their vast amount of toppings. It would've been easier to pick if their were labels directly on the glass (similar to Subway) 
Easy to see. Easy to choose. Simple!

My husband made his own sushi burrito and I decided to make my own nachos - which I was pretty disappointed with the chicken. It was flavorless and tasted like it came out of a frozen package... It would've been much better if it were a katsu chicken or a marinaded and grilled chicken (similar to Mochiko's grilled chicken).

In this case, it's true to not go to a sushi burrito place and order chicken nachos!

All in all, not too bad and good prices.

As we scanned Yelp for nearby ideas, Soho came up as a suggestion and would fulfill our desire for fresh sushi and another fab food craze item, a sushiritto!

It was fun to watch the sushirittos be made. There's a full-on machine that presses the sushi race into a square seaweed wrapper! At the end, there's another machine that tightly wraps the sushiritto, which is a good thing since the people putting together our sushirittos were generous with the toppings. I wasn't sure how it was all going to fit!

I opted for the High Maintenance, and it was awesome. Mmm, I can still taste the fresh yellowtail, spicy tuna, and guacamole. What a brilliant combination! The cabbage and wonton crackers added a great crunch, as well. I really couldn't have picked a better option.
