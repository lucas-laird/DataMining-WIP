1278712,2016-11-01,0,ZkJRO4nYlINnXpNlR-jN6A,Sam and Wendy are two amazing women. they cater to Paleo Diet and sugar-free needs and not only is there food tasty and delicious but it is reasonably priced and the presentation is beautiful. I always stop in to the green regime when I am going to the pharmacy to pick up a protein packed Shake or a green drink and the best paleo ranch dressing you will ever have in your life and will not be able to stop craving once you try it.  I also enjoy enjoy visiting with Sam and our wonderful fun conversations every time I'm in there picking up my green drink and ranch dressing.  see you again next time ladies!,JuXEB1qomolNgJejbnetBQ,0,0,5,o3Qg8iVssVjgfaBtlocBXw

I take great comfort in knowing that I am putting something healthy and nourishing in my body rather than eating crap. Must try the Bulletproof coffee!!! It has all of the ingredients you need to get your day started right.,frd5z0uK0bdMPdBsrk_9qg,0,1,5,IkmfUGYVD8cgNiI-MUFmeg

When you enter, you are greeted. Signage displays daily specials and new items. Sandwiches, salads, and protein boxes are in a refrigerator to grab and go. You can also call in your order ahead of time. Juices and protein shakes are made to order, sandwiches can be heated upon request, and there's a small dine-in area.

The buffalo chicken and chipotle chicken wraps and salads are among my go-to items, and the house-made dressings are flavorful. I usually don't do the beverages here, but the Vanilla Powerhouse protein shake is freaking delicious with a 4:1 protein to carb ratio.

2404762,2016-04-21,1,ZkJRO4nYlINnXpNlR-jN6A,"My massage therapist recommended that I stop by the Green Regime and get a Green Drink to assist my body in the healing process. So I walked in and met Samantha, owner/operator. Samantha was so helpful and explained what and how each ingredient helped our body. I decided on the Green Drink as it assisted with anti-inflamatory issues as well as energy. I would strongly recommend stopping by regularly and doing something good for yourself. it's good and good for you! Thanks, Samantha!",ECVBOexIpZKMea5FsOO_2g,0,0,5,92h4hJ_3E1obMMJ4omsNsw

The drinks are made fresh with whole food ingredients, the lunch boxes are made fresh. A stop well worth making. 
Bonus- I had a sample of her Chocolate Peanut Butter Thunder drink - taste like a dessert but ssshhh, it's healthy.  She also makes her own almond butter!",_tYpOB2ABjc7IR5i2tyy7w,0,0,5,1wvx24ReIxkeyE8lWf_Awg
