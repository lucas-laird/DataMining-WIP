The seating area is shared with other restaurants but I haven't had a hard time finding a seat.  Breakfast is served until 11.,VDEOXbKP3h_bJobCJBhm0Q,0,0,4,Dcc_RfelyrBMr-VrKz1ZdQ

So if you want McDonalds and you want to eat at the Plaza, head to the one at the D hotel, order out and bring it back. You'll save yourself about 20 minutes of aimlessly loitering in the Plaza lobby. It's happened to me twice now. Never again.",paeGRFYEOEaB48Dz6u4XmA,0,0,1,8bZC_1CEeM6lz10Uwye9IA

I wanted to especially Thank Vanessa she went out of her way and gave my son a ""Lego"" reusable cup, the following morning she was very welcoming with a smile on her face. I was very impressed on how during a rush she handled customers, and kept things running smoothly. Upon arriving, there was a long line but moved along very Fast.",1kkpu0tHOvJyHdQ93viVeA,0,0,4,oVn3Y9ygMN6IuNuEHnOuKw
1799008,2016-08-15,1,O_YSJEMk2GzcmnwXWBj74g,"Based on tonight solely, I would have chosen not to elect any stars at all if I could. Multiple red flags were observed regarding staff AND management's customer service, as well as lack of professionalism amongst each other. 

Furthermore, there were issues with the credit card scanners, in which staff member yelled: ""Cash only, dude!"" to me while I was in line. Twenty minutes went by before I could even order & pay for my selections with a credit card.

I was also disgusted with the way staff managed a situation where part of their foundation collapsed (ceiling). It is understandable that ""things happen"" but staff could have at least attempted to maintain a positive attitude, rather than grunt in disgust directly in front of the customers. When management and someone from maintenance did have the opportunity to observe & fix the problem, both individuals began cussing, arguing, & pointing fingers at the female staff members directly in front of the customers, once again.

Yesterday morning, I would have given it THREE 1/2 STARS because management was very professional & allowed options for me to make accommodations to my order, which I received a BOGO for taking the online survey. Only issue I had them was that the orders seemed slower than they usually take, but AM crew did well overall. Unfortunately, my recent experience prompts me to avoid this particular McDonald's location. This is especially frustrating for me because I still have two more days on my stay here in the Plaza Hotel located on the Strip in Las Vegas, NV.",8udRRWEWeSwsxpbjeXylyw,0,0,2,JabBBO9z97JrW3QhW9cbqw

I guess you can't really complaint though, it is Vegas after all and it's right at the entrance of a god damn casino.

But I think me and my Dad ordered some type of burgers and then came back when we got a coupon for a free new smoothie thing they had that came with our large soda.

The smoothie was excellent and I would definitely order another one some time.

But the only reason for this Mickey D's getting 1 star off, is simply because of the crowd/rowdiness.",oxROq8BWttf1kZ52LTzhRQ,0,0,4,9PyBvczvWpbaaEoTBwB-OA

She should be working! A lot of people including myself were waiting for our food and there was no one apart from them 2. We were waiting for around 15 minutes just for a burger and fries!! All because she was talking away to some people which looked to be someone she knew but left Brian to do all the work and he was such a lovely guy it's a shame and he doesn't deserve to be treated like that!!

The fry cook touched the cookies with his bare hands and looked at me like ""oops! You caught me!"" 
The ladies always chitchat with each other and let customers wait in line before even acknowledging them. 
I come here 3-5 times a week and only one team member actually recognizes me and talks to me like a regular. 
Every time I get subpar service at a fast food place I can't help but think ""and you lazy people want $15 an hour?"" Do they even know what it really takes for an employer to want to pay employees that? You would have to be at work everyday 10 minutes early, greet every customer within a second or 2 of seeing their lovely face and take their order promptly. Then stay busy and WASH your hands before touching any food!!  Seriously it is not hard!!",0OuJGtdPZ8B4kjkrwqtMHw,0,0,1,9DRHV05s1LbHtG5tYJ2ohA

I got to the register to place my order and the cashier was rude off top. When I was finished with my order I pulled up my rewards app and displayed my coupon. She looked baffled as she wasn't sure what to do with the app. After you're arguing with me that I couldn't use the coupon she brought over the assistant manager who took care of the situation. I then paid for my order, said thank you and the cashier glared at me and said nothing. Once I got my order and got back to my room we realized that the order was all wrong. I then had to go back to have my order replaced. The manager was very kind and helpful, but the cashier stood there and stared at me the whole time I waited for my new food. I don't normally advocate for people to not have a job, but this particular cashier does not need to work with the public.",h0Nhnq4ubn51BcbkliKE8g,0,0,1,6ReipfTV65zfD3-j1ZQyXQ
3888108,2016-04-23,0,O_YSJEMk2GzcmnwXWBj74g,"This is the worst McDonald's I have been in a very long time. I had met my family who had already ordered and were in the sitting area. They were complaining about the mistakes on their orders but I knew dinner plans were about 2.1/2 hours away so I decided to order something small. 

I walk up to ""Christy"" who is leaning against the back counter and say hello to which she responds ""....."". Yeah, no response. I order my Filet-O-Fish and sit back to wait. I am the only one there and I start to notice that ""Christy"" had returned to leaning on the counter, there is another girl on her cell phone and one girl picking up trash on the floor. I think this one was the manager. Christy turns her back to me while the one girl working is sweeping the floor. Another customer walks up and Christy feels his presence and turns her head but not her body. I start to think that he must have already ordered because this girl is not addressing him BUT after a few minutes she finally turns around and asks him what he wants to order. Holy C@:-) p, this girl let him stand there for 3-4 minutes for no reason but when he said hello, she doesn't address him either. This girl is the worst! I won't try to describe the look she has but let me tell you, it's not friendly or inviting.

Why are you there if you don't want to work with people but where is management to allow this to happen.",5lhisOo609Mymwf9-4MOlA,1,0,2,OOJ06LzIQAQ8KUGaD2iVSA

How do you make McDonalds worse than it already is?  Shove it inside a low budget casino and employ nothing but hood rats.  

the one star is for it being cheap and quick when hammered inside the Plaza.  At that point diarrhea really isn't a beg deal.",bjaRDRmJs0cg545YHMb60g,1,0,1,WZ6-LmK4CvGOveiBguMQDg

One other thing that really has nothing to do with the Plaza but wanted to mention. One day I was in line at McDonald's to get an iced tea. There was a man in front of me and then a man in a wheelchair being waited on. He looked to be pretty down and out (something you see whether downtown or on the strip) and was ordering some breakfast. I  heard the cashier say $4 something and I saw him put a dollar on the counter...I thought, uh-oh, she'll have to tell him not enough and wonder how he'll react,....well, he had put up a bunch of change and then I though the cashier would get ticked about having to count it all. I was so very wrong...she was so kind and so patient...counted it out and then told him he needed a few cents more so he gave her a dime and then she said, now I owe you a penny...with a big smile on her face. I am sad to say that her behavior just shocked me....I am so used to everyone being rushed and treated rudely...it has become so commonplace...as though we have to pay to be treated like decent human beings...and here this man paid for his coffee and food with change and was treated with extreme patience and kindness. It just really made me so happy and was one of the highlights of my stay in Vegas. I went to that McDonald's several times during my stay and the service was excellent every single time.",tZXFo0wtbCDP-Gt09Ar9_w,0,2,5,AR27PqNpo91Qm_YL5sMz8w

I am disappointed to see that those days some people are obviously neglecting their duties. As the customer, I was treated with neglection. First, no one paid attention to me for about 2 - 3 minutes. meanwhile, the employees were wondering around. Then comes the real disappointment.
My burger was prepared really slow. Come-oooon.......this is just a simple burger. Why you made me wait, gourmet-like time? Once I opened the box...what a surprise. I even took a snap on the surprise.
