So good.

Albino, the chef, is an artist when it comes to flavor! He makes his own version of the Tapenade where he combines chimichurri & tapenade & calls is tapenod. They even have vegetarian options! Their Mozzarella Frida is made fresh & their marinara sauce is incredible! They are very attentive & friendly. It's a little place, but don't let that deter you! I'm so happy to say I finally found an Italian restaurant where I feel comfortable ordering the lasagna & not worrying if it's Stouffers with extra sauce put on top. Everything is made to order. I got the baked ziti & every bite left trails of stringy cheese to the plate! Hands down the best! & in addition, their pricing is EXTREMELY affordable! My boyfriend got the Linguine Vongole which is Linguini with clams & your choice of red or white wine sauce, he got white. He literally didn't speak after his plate arrived because he was too busy shoveling food in his mouth! Look at the photo attached, for $14 the amount of clams you get is unheard of! I don't even like seafood & I tried & enjoyed it! My friend got the Riggatoni Bolognese which was absolutely delicious! It was the perfect amount of ground sausage with grounds beef.

2150805,2018-02-14,0,AN0bWhisCf6LN9eHZ7DQ3w,"I am so excited to have an affordable neighborhood Italian eatery near home!  Been driving past it for a bit, but Yelp is what made me decide to finally stop in and give it a try. It is a small little shop, but what it lacks in ""fancy"", it more than makes up for in flavor.

We started with the Calamari Frita, delicately coated and fried, served with a lemon wedge and some marinara. It was beautifully cooked and so yummy. They also served a basket of warm baked bread with an olive tapenade.

We shared a spinach salad, with walnuts, tossed in a balsamic dressing (we opted out of the golden raisins), getting our veggies in for the day.

Our main course was the Cioppino (mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, calamari, and fish) in a spicy tomato broth and Meat Lasagna.

The Cioppino was a large bowl filled with plenty of seafood. I ordered it spicy, and it was plenty flavorful and not too spicy. It was especially tasty with a fresh basket of bread to dunk in the wonderful broth.

The Meat Lasagna was the best I have ever had. The noodles were thin and tender...it just had to be homemade to be that fresh and good. The layers of pasta, ricotta, and mozzarella were perfectly balanced with their meat sauce, layered so you got a perfect scrumptious bite each time...and there was plenty of it, too.

By the time we reached end of our meal, we were too full for dessert. However, if we had had room to spare, we could have had Tiramisu, Lemon Cake, or Chocolate Cake to round out our meal.

Service was excellent, and the chef even came and asked us how our meal was. I am so excited to have such a gem nearby. I look forward to trying the lamb chops next time, and I'll even leave room for dessert, too...well hopefully I will.",OcpxS8U7evLWyfw1K2pwng,2,1,5,w917HcM1JV_AbcCGepSvZA

This was my second time ordering the amazing fried mozzarella -- how can something so simple be so good?  We had a delicious antipasti platter as well.  The complimentary toasty hot breadsticks & tapenade was the bonus appetizer.  
My husband ordered the veal piccata which came with a side of colorful sautéed veggies & creamy delicious mashed potatoes.  I had a mountain of spaghetti topped with two tasty meatballs.
This is just a little place in a strip mall, nothing fancy.  There is seating for about 30.  I was happy to see they have a sign above the business now.  My son & his gf drove around the parking lot a few times not seeing the restaurant when we invited them to join us a few weeks ago.
I'm really happy to have a nice alternative to chain restaurants on the east side.  We will be back again, soon!
We came in for our fourth visit tonight...I can't decide what my favorite thing on the menu it -- every time I try something new it b comes my new favorite.  The chicken Marsala was amazing!  The veggies & potatoes on the side were beautiful -- fresh & delicious!  
I seriously don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  After looking at all the pics, I think the baked ziti will be the next thing I try.  Yum!",3OV5CX5Cv7ZcKq3VHKASIQ,0,0,5,Rujgir2nqlau_CkAiI4RBg

Only open a month,  this is a hidden gem that will keep growing through word of mouth. 
It was absolutely worth the drive from Summerlin, that's for sure.  The owners are so genuinely thankful that you come in,  they are such great people.
Another table began chatting with us and they said it was their second night in a row and they brought a friend to let him know about it. 
They we're hooked.  Well, so are we. 
First, the Caesar Salad.  Incredible! Light dressing,  fresh shaved big cheese slices. Huge salad for $5.
The pasta in garlic and oil was the best ever. Seriously.  My husband was so happy with that dish. Chicken and capers was very tasty, and the eggplant dish was great. Eggplant was cut too thick for our taste, but was flavored so well. 
Oh, and we got the fried mozzarella which was superb. 
We spent $45 and had so much food. Last week we ate at another Italian place and spent $100 for yummy, bland food.
Come here! I agree with all the reviews. Show this couple some love,  and your tummy some happiness, too.

We'll be back !",R0gBD96leBWzg8jMIX7WBw,0,0,5,tC3Aqtp_2quSGShbiAhYtA

They serve warm bread with such a good calamata olive pesto sauce.  I started with the tomato basil soup which was very good and my mom had the los Olivia salad, so yummy.  Then I ordered the 10"" Margherita pizza and I added mushrooms as my topping.  My mom had the veal Parmesan which was very good. We'll be back for sure.  Great food...great chef.",pcEg3YSS3z60Cq98GyUdrQ,0,0,5,jynsbTki34EvGpVJZL_-vw
5234648,2018-06-11,0,AN0bWhisCf6LN9eHZ7DQ3w,"We were in town for a trade show convention and looking for a hometown place to grab a good meal away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  After deciding Italian was the meal of choice we found Los Olivos on Yelp and decided to give it a try.
We were hesitant after pulling up to a half empty strip mall but sometimes these are the best places.  
The restaurant was empty but smelled fantastic upon entry.  After the warm greetings and quick browse through the menu it was food time.
My buddy and I were just blown away.  The antipasta plate along with the mozzarella frita were fantastic.  That along with the toasted breadsticks with garlic dipping sauce should have been the end since we had eaten so much.  Next came the main course of traditional spaghetti with meatballs and linguine with clams in wine sauce.  My work colleague was commenting on how his wife was Italian and he's sampled some authentic Italian grub over the years.  This chef was definitely classically trained and made some quality food.  Both of our dishes were amazing.  I ate as much of the spaghetti as possible before I couldn't move anymore.  After a wonderful dinner we finished off the meal with some tiramisu and coffee.  
Chef/Owner Albino Alcala came over to thank us for the business and was so grateful.  He mentioned working under some high profile chefs for over 18 years in Chicago before moving to Vegas where he bounced around until the opportunity came to open his own place.  If I lived in Vegas and was local I would be supporting this place often.  I highly suggest you give this place a chance and support a local establishment.  Our trade show rotates and will be back in two years.  I will for sure be coming back to enjoy this food again and highly suggest anyone traveling to the area give this place a shot.  Thank You again Chef Albino along with your family that was there to support.  Best of luck and hope to see you again soon.",zAdH_SLTJTA_DmmqsEaEiQ,0,0,5,ExQnfnDjNylAaHf07lo3Bg
5441019,2017-11-26,1,AN0bWhisCf6LN9eHZ7DQ3w,"This is what a neighborhood Italian restaurant ""is""! Small (6 four top tables and 10 counter seats), store front, kitchen in full view and welcoming.  The very first person I spoke with was the Owner / Chef ... Very welcoming and friendly.  Menu: selection is good covering veal, chicken, seafood, pasta, salads and pizza.

I started with Antipasti for $9.  I expected something small ... nope ... could have made a meal out of it by itself.  Moved on to the Soup of the Day, $4.50, BIG bowl of beautiful white calm chowder that was fabulous ... and again no small item.  Main course: Eggplant Parmesan $12.  As a meatless dish this is challenging to balance flavors and texture.  Chef Alcala demonstrates an increditable skill balancing the acidity of sauce, creaminess of cheese, without destroying the simple  underlining sweetness of the eggplant nor it's texture.  Excellent dish ... and again, BIG portion and came with a side dish of pasta to boot.  

Chef Alcala brings to our local neighborhood an excellent addition and I sincerely hope he and his family will make this their long 
-time home.",DiYvn7x5C_z27IcpEf3HAw,2,2,5,hwQZzPTk_ZYGIfd27pezeg
5445336,2018-04-03,1,AN0bWhisCf6LN9eHZ7DQ3w,"Ok...so being that this the land of the Italian mafia you would think there would be some amazing Italian restaurants. We have been to several and have been severly disappointed by many. We saw this place on yelp and they had great reviews, although just 29 reviews they had 5 Stars. We thought what they heck...it's close to home...so let's give it a try!!! We drove up to an almost deserted strip mall and had our doubts....to be honest we almost drove away. But we were there and I said...you know we have had pretty good luck at a lot of hole in the wall places...we are here...let's give it a try. OMG....thank god we did!!!!!
We were greeted by the chef and I am assuming his wife. We were the only 2 in the building...very pleasant couple!! 
We started with the fried mozzarella...2 big triangles, breaded and deep fried! Served on a bed of their marinara sauce. Holy moly....it was AMAZING!!!
Then we could not decide what to try because it all sounded so good so you would think by looking at our table we had 10 people coming to join us...but no...just the 2 of us...
Made to order lasagna
Baked ziti 
Small all meats pizza
My man had the lasagna...with meat sauce...it was 5 layers of home made noodle, cheese, meat and the flavor was intense, the meat sauce was so packed full of flavor, tender chunks of meat melted in your mouth.
The baked ziti was piping hot cheese baked to perfection on the top...the sauce was a cream marinara...cheese throughout and the noodles were cooked al dente. 
The pizza...pepperoni, sliced sausage and bacon. The crust was doughy but crispy and held all of the sauce and juices perfectly. The sausage was amazing...I wanted to eat it off of the top just by itself. The flavor of the sauce is hard to perfectly describe...it was the marinara but had a twist...it was delicious.
All of that for $41 and we have so much food left it's crazy!!!
We will be back...we have found our local Italian restaurant and you should go and support this amazing place and enjoy their meals!!! Whatever side of town you are on...it will be worth the drive!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,3,0,5,O323R4tpSvDxfcpVIKEI0A

5828012,2017-10-19,0,AN0bWhisCf6LN9eHZ7DQ3w,"This place couldn't get any better! Although new, Los Olivos is really making a name for themselves. I found it through Yelp and had to see this place in action. The owner, chef, and staff are very attentive and super sweet, which made the dining experience that much better. 

What we had... 
Veggie lasagna: the noodles were cooked just right
Chicken parm: saucy and tender. The penne pasta was cooked at a perfect al dente. 
Lamb chops: best we've ever had! Cooked beautifully!
Baked Ziti: BEYOND PERFECTION!

We couldn't get enough of the bread and the Los Olivos salads were a meal in itself. 

The portions are huge! Arrive hungry! We'll be back!",B6VzcTEyS3henXbV4-vhrA,1,0,5,Y7H5iDOGHGXVWUk6yXIs_Q
