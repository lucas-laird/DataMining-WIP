I bought a GroupOn and texted Aya for an appointment. She said she had 3:30pm available the next day. I gave her my full name and asked if she needed any other information. She responded No. I arrive at Baroque Beauty Center at 3:20pm and the receptionist said have a seat. At 4pm, I asked if she was working and told her client before me was running late, he thought. At 4:15pm I asked if he knew how late and he said no.  When I said please let her know I was here and I would like a refund. He and the Stylist said ok and they'd leave to after waiting an hour. They inferred this is a common practice with Aya. I texted her at 4pm asking her status and at 4:20pm before I left asking for a refund. At 5:40pm she texted me, it is my fault for not confirming my appointment in the morning. She has to many GroupOn no shows and doesn't come in if it's not confirmed. I replied you never said I needed to confirm. I forwarded a copy of our interaction the day before and said there is nothing saying I need to confirm in the morning?!?! Who does this?  She never apologized and told me to contact GroupOn for a credit. Then proceeded to say she was trying to help me and she'd pray for me because God could help me more then she could? Seriously, not sure how she was helping. I made an appointment and she flakes out. Very poor business.",VA_RLd8Vg2kjwh4-gWYodg,0,0,1,e8q6o3YfQlGq4VRYHoMmqA

She listens to where my pain is then addresses it with her knowledge of what body part to work on and her solid execution of deep tissue massage, including stretching.

1298678,2018-05-05,0,IhYo9Szx_gPDfNOcz5-8DQ,"I saw many good reviews for this massage so I decided to try. Please note that I have had many shiatsu massages, I  am very fit, athletic, do not drink and health-conscious to a degree most people can't comprehend because  of what I had to do to beat terminal cancer, myeloma, 38 years ago.

If you want a therapist who does not stop talking for the entire session and lectures you on all her theories of what's wrong with you this is the perfect place. According to her I have osteoporosis, arthritis, something wrong with my calf muscles, and I need Cortizone shots somewhere in my back though she doesn't quite know where.

Finally after telling her I will not do Cortizone shots as they are not healthy and can cause blindness we ended up in a lively one sided discussion with her lecturing me on and on about how she heals people and finally I could not take it anymore and got up and said I'm leaving as I came to relax and not get verbally abused. When you want to get a relaxing massage getting lectured by an opinionated, want a be doctors/healer is  not what I expected to pay for.

As for the massage this does not resemble any of  the probably 50 shiatsu massage I have had in my life. Even a bad massage occasionally feels good in some spots but she was not able  to provide even one moment of a good feeling. Which is hard to believe unfortunately .

Generally I hate writing negative reviews because I don't want to affect someone's livelihood. But this massage crossed the line that I feel others should know about the experience.
Thanks 
John

 Update. Since I posted this review I have received nine texts from Aya. The texts bragged about her skill and offered negative comments about me. I did not respond to any of them but they just kept coming.

One text said that she would never work on someone like me with negative energy. This is interesting since at the beginning of the massage she specifically stated that I had very good positive energy.

Another text stated that I had emotional problems. Looking through the reviews I see that she also told someone else something similar who dared to post  a negative review. This must be her go to comment.

Hopefully the text are done. I'm not sure how she has so much time to keep sending me texts when she bragged in one of them that she has 300 regular clients.

This woman is amazing.  I REALLY needed a massage and she delivered exactly what I needed, and included hot stones!

1. She is an amazing massage therapist. She didn't just apply lotion to my back. I wanted pressure and I got pressure, but not too much.  She is truly talented and a hard worker. 

2.  She is very kind and friendly. Her personality is legit!  I came in to relax, and the massage was not awkward by any means. She made me feel at home. 

3. She is incredibly knowledgable. She educated me on the importance of hydration. 

4.  She is a massage therapist NOT a salesperson. No pressure (minus the pressure on my back).

5. Incredibly fair prices. 

Oh, and she even offered me a stick of gum at the end. PERFECT!

If it were possible to bring her with me to LA I would. If you are in Las Vegas/Clark County and need a massage, check her out.  I promise you won't be disappointed.",Up-yXaK8a3VbjaBjUPMXvA,6,4,5,XQuexOrgHq8-F92wlz2SOQ

1) I did end up getting a credit from Groupon. Used the credit to buy a massage from a different provider, but I probably won't use Groupon again unless it's for known stores I already frequent.

2) The therapist called, left a voice message, then sent a bunch of text messages a few days after my original review. I presume she did this after she saw my 1-star Yelp review. She was trying to get me to change my review. I now understand what Anne T. meant by harassment. She kept calling my review ""malicious"" and ""evil"", then trying to get me to reschedule a free massage. Umm... no thanks. I'm getting all sorts of crazy vibes, and I don't believe in getting services like this for free. She kept blaming the owner of the salon repeatedly because they were waxing the spa floor (apparently without giving any notice to any of the therapists at the salon).
