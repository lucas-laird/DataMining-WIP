I didn't have to wait long to get a drink or for them to take my food order so they get points for that.  The food on the other hand was not good.  I ordered chicken wings and they where bland over cooked.  The fries that came with it where undercooked and just not tasty at all.  I only had a bit from each and just left.  The food was only tone star but the service bumps it up to two stars.

Best HH in Vegas. and they don't judge you for ordering a tall Coors Light with a side of ice at 8 am on a Sunday so you can get a nice little Tebowner before work.

I love you Erin, you horse riding fool. And Patrick, I'm giving you a fistbump right now. Don't leave me hanging man! It's ok, we'll connect later. No worries.

But seriously you guys, this is a great joint. Usually all the pool tables (regulation baby!) are functioning, and there's never a terrible wait to get your game on. HH is great, 3-7 and midnight-4am everyday, 1/2 off all drinks and zas.

They have one security guard check ID before enter the bar area; then you will see a full bar in front of you with 2-3 TVs on each side. If you want avoid smoke or group of ppl, maybe you should turn left, they have couple sofa down there; or turn right if you want quiet and eat something here (because they provide 1/2 off on pizza after midnight and 1/2 on all the drinks, very very value).

I love their nachos, especially steak!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!

A lot of my coworkers and seemingly other workers make their way here from the strip.  So it definitely is more of a locals joint than touristy spot.  This place has made for a lot of fun times.  The bartenders are cool and Brett is definitely the coolest.  Dude has heck of a memory and will share stories and will usually make for awesome time with friends.
    Like any PT's being at the bar right up is your best bet for a drink.  If you're in the outskirts, say the pool tables or sofas the drinks will take a lil while.  4 of 5 because they've provided for some awesome nightcaps during all the times I've been here.",FaeY4ILFh6r1WpJDWc19Tw,0,0,4,FAuXQmqrPOCl3L0Jly-o2g

Plus, what is great about this location is that if you're jonesing for some pad Thai or pho, there are plenty of locations around here open late for your convenience.

The only knock I would give this place is that sometimes the bar would get really crowded and you would only see 1 bartender and barback. The wait times can get really long, even though they are trying their best to get the orders out.

First of all this is a bar not a freaking club so there no reason to have a bouncer outside asking people for id and shit that dumb is the only pts that does it.  Second the bartender was rude I order two drinks and he wanted me to pay right away and of course expected a tip im like really dude how about I pay you when im done drinking and eating and if your service is good you will get a tip a hole.  And finally the drinks were bad you can tell he was a rookie bartender that didnt know what he was doing the service was awful I even paid and left the drink on top of the bar and left.

They have happy hour after midnight and drinks were dirt cheap although we just stuck with beers. A large mug of beer during happy hour though is only like $3.75 and they also have 50% off pizzas which are pretty large. I had the popcorn chicken pizza and didn't realize it was a buffalo popcorn chicken until it arrived on our table and damn was it spicy! We ended up not being able to finish it because it spice level was killing us. There are a few pool tables and some table seating near a wall of TVs in case you don't feel like chillin at the bar. It was kind of smoky inside but I enjoyed it nonetheless and would come back especially for the after midnight happy hour!,zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,1,3,u4hG72xn6YzO6V44HpbfMw

Daaaaaaaaaamn GINA! She is the best bartender. Very attentive, easy on the eyes (I can't believe how good she looks for her age!) and she keeps the drinks going. Knowing exactly what we want even before we order.

Must have ID to enter, which i really like. This is the largest PT's I've been to. This Pt's is always happening. It's always going down on a tuesday or any day of the week matter of fact. You know your a regular when Gina knows you and your group by name. If coming on a friday or saturday get here early because otherwise seating is limited. 

Lots of pool tables. 6 i think? darts. lots of tv's with lounge couches, tables and bar seating. Want to pick your music? Sure, they've got a jukebox.

Love happy hour. 5-7pm or 12-2am. Get my rum and cokes for only 2.75. Nacho's are huge and the perfect item to eat when drinking. Please share with a friend. Pizza is good but sometimes a little too greasy. Love the gilroy! (garlic, mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage and tomatoes) Warning, it has so much garlic that i brushed my teeth twice and the boyfriend said i STILL smelled of garlic. It def impressed those taste buds of mine. Then again i was 5 rum and cokes in. Service is slow sometimes during happy hour but that's because there are only 3 bartenders and a bazillion customers.

I cannot stand the smell of cigarettes and it lingers on my clothes, skin and hair even after I leave. Not a fan but I deal with it. 

Other than the horrible smell, this pts doesn't make my list of favorites because it's always packed. I'm always able to find a place to sit but when I came here with my friend last night, he had to sit on a wobbly stool because we couldn't find another empty one.

During the Happy Hour times, the place gets packed and there seems to always be at least a few seats at the bar.  The jukebox here has a ton of selections and there are pool tables that are usually half occupied at the hours when I visit.

The food here is decent and while the pizza may seem to be made on a large round cracker, it's edible and pretty tasty with a beer after a hard night's work.  The burgers here are actually above the normal ""bar average"" but they are a little pricey compared to other neighborhood bars.

If you're looking for a good spot to watch a sporting event, there are enough flat screen TVs here to satisfy the sports enthusiast in your family while having enough room to actually sit and enjoy your time there.

This time around it wasn't impressive at all, but I'm willing to give it another go. I came here to have some beers with family that were visiting from out of town and only wished my hub had picked a better spot for the occasion.

We started with ordering from only 2 beers they had that evening blue moon and shock top and then ordered a spinach cheese dip that us girls split. The boys had between them a burger with fries and cheese ham omelet. 

I already knew from looking at the overpriced menu the food was going to sucketh greatly and I was right. The burger my hub ate was living in the freezer AKA frozen patty meat. Gross! My uncle had an omelet that had an avalanche of cheese on it, which he scraped off. At that point I think anyone consuming that amount of cheese would have diarrhea... Am I going TMI on you? Yes, because I want to spare my fellow foodies this food tragedy.

I will say that I personally enjoyed the safest choice which was the spinach dip and beer, but that's about it food wise. While chatting with the peeps I did hear some awesome tunes playing in the background that I was definitely diggin' and think I would have enjoyed them more if I was playing pool.

So in a nutshell I will be coming back to PT's to play some pool and throw back some beers with my pals but will seriously be declining on the food.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,0,0,3,WLmx_d-3BKcfg3csBOmJMQ

We came here on a Friday night a bit late at 12:30am. I loved the layout of this place. The place wasn't lonesome like other PT's. There were a lot of people hanging out and they seemed to be a bit more social as well. Pool tables are a nice touch. 

Food:
Pizza- 1 star. The crust is like cardboard with no flavor. I'd skip this entirely. 
Chicken strips- 4 stars. ""Spicy"" gets you the buffalo sauce. Yummy flavor and great crunch. Definitely the winner. 
Nachos- 3 stars. 

Service was not bad. It does get busy however due to the HH from 12-2am.

I like their Happy Hour deals they have late at night. The place tends to get busier then, but it's still a very casual and locals' spot. It's a lot more relaxed than the pretentiousness of the strip places. 

They have great deals during their Happy Hour, so it's best to go at that time and enjoy your favorite drink with some bar food. As bar food goes, it's actually pretty good. Their pizza, wings, and sliders are all tasty, and they're even tastier when you've had a few cold beers to go with them!

The bartenders here, as is the case at other PT's, are really cool people. They're pretty good about suggesting things when you wanna try new drinks, which I think is pretty cool. Plus, they seem to know a lot of their regulars, which is extra cool. 

All in all, this is the place you want to go to when it's late at night and you want to have a drink or a casual bite. It's cool, the place is relaxed, there's a jukebox, and prices are fair. Win!",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,2,1,5,4xfiJFgfzqCEP1vNtiPh0Q

Although I don't drink much, I can still tell a good deal when I see it. $12 for THREE drinks. Man. I paid $17 for ONE the next night. Oh, Vegas. My friend had recommended the Garlic Parmesan Fries, so next time I'm at a PT's I'll definitely have to give it a try.

I decided to try the BBQ Chicken Pizza and some beer.  The pizza is a massive 16"" and comes loaded with ingredients with the crispest crust.  Delicious!  All drinks being half off means you can party until your hearts delight.  Gina was unbelievably receptive to my demands, and spot on with the refills.  She actually remembers me from over 2 months ago and even pointed to the seat that I was sitting in.  Who does that!?

Please stop by this Pt's during happy hour for a guaranteed great time.  Every person that came to sit next to me said hello and greeting me with a smile.  I can't say enough about Gina and her infectious smile and charming personality.

Stopped in after work to grab 1/2 priced drinks and food after a long day of work. Sat at the bar and was served right away in it's normal fashion. Then once we all ordered our drinks and were looking at the menu the female bartender was like ""oh are you looking for happy hour specials? I think you might be, well we have changed our 1st happy hour from 4-7 to the new time of 3-6."" The time now was 7:25. I was so pissed that no one told me sooner. She ""claimed"" that it started 2 weeks ago and she wasn't sure which ones. I told her they need to get on that because their radio commercials, and banners still had the old time. I then checked yelp and happy houred and neither were updated.

How do you serve people that always come to your bar and not tell them what has changed? Such bullshit. We stayed since we had already ordered drinks but she continued to make our time spent their miserable. She talked on her cell phone, ignored the people at the bar, and was unsure how to make common pt drinks. And it wasn't even busy AT ALL.  Then when one person asked to leave she put all our drinks on one receipt. And was really confused when we asked to split it. 

I will continue to go here but now only for the late happy hour and never when that Bartender is there.",1bKViE447MdvO_r0AiDEJQ,1,1,2,R49IK5Uy08XrYXmV21bx2w

I took a seat at the bar while waiting for my YELP best friend (Mimi) and the bartender served me an IPA, nothing out of the normal yet. 

Once my friend arrived thou service took a turn for the worse, the bartender who served me earlier was socializing and didn't come over until 10 minutes after Mimi sat down.  She ordered her beer of choice Stella and I had another IPA we talked and chatted roughly an hour then went to pay our tab.  ""Our"" bartender was oblivious to us working the other side of the bar and the other bartender on our side was on her phone.  I tried calling them over and waved my hands,  to get their attention.  Finally Mimi approached and asked the  bartender who was on her phone if we could get our tab and the lady responded that she wasn't the one who served us... really??...   She then brought the tab over and we paid and went on our way.

The waitress seemed a little wet behind the ears, but she was friendly and helpful.  Wish the drinks were a little heavier handed, but again, that usually comes with experience.

Food was pretty meh, but it's expected.  A bunch of fried foods that weren't very memorable, but the prices were ok, and it fits the bill for convenience sake.

They have pool tables and games to keep you entertained, and the pub is overall clean and inviting.  Check it out sometime if you haven't already :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,0,3,q9mYjYOAdrCi8cAp06MaWw

We waited till happy hour (12am) on a Sunday to order garlic Parmesan fries, at 12:25am we still didn't receive our order, we decided to check up with the bar tender that put in our order, we finally received our fries at 12:37am. 37 freakin' minutes to get our fries, upon first bite we could tell the fries were old and sat under the heater for at least 15 mins before they got out to us. They were horrible and the garlic Parmesan they used was incredibly overwhelming and slopped on-top of the fries with no desire to make it tasteful. It couldn't get any worse right? 

After getting our second basket of make up fries, we all dove right in, after picking at the fries I was fortunate enough to pick one up and dip it into my ranch discovering a long black string dangling from my fries, I realized, it was a disgusting long piece of black hair!! We all wanted to puke. Probably one of the most disgusting feelings ever. Sent the fries back a second time and obviously didn't order another batch and made sure the bar tender took it off our tab
