I swerved into a parking space and the rest is history! The combination of soul food, Asian and BBQ was just the added diversity I needed for lunch. I had the Kalbi Rib bowl; white rice, collard greens, carrot slaw and Kimchi . . .  I kept eating trying to find something wrong and before I knew it, I was scraping the bottom of the bowl. The blending of various cultural foods was a success. Each item could stand alone; but the combination was a pleasant surprise. I also tried the Smokey Hennessey BBQ sauce; undeniable goodness. Next time; I'm going for the Baby Back Ribs or chicken wings. . .that sauce would be a delicious addition; not just another condiment! Thumbs up experience, great customer service, and very friendly staff/owners!",wFz2W_fkNBIoA0nEJEqCrg,0,0,4,XS5Oj8ZHdmkNPiKxRC3zyQ

I'm addicted and haven't been able to stop thinking about how good it was. Met the owner Maurice and he's an awesome guy! Found out that he's a legit trained chef with a lot of skill, and he just really cares about the food which is important to me. 100% I'll be back but with more people, I've already told so many people that they have to try it!

To get food like this I usually have to go downtown or dive really far.  The only thing I would change would be an options to make it more Spicy. But my family loves spicy.

2952947,2018-06-19,0,7zMwR4FkvTbSGY0vRT5Ljg,"I love supporting small mom-and-pop type shops, and if you're a fan of fusion restaurants, go forth and give Angry Blasian's Soul and Seoul- type cooking a try! :D  It's almost like how Komex offers their versions of Korean-Mexican dishes, but Angry Blasian's menu consists of just as delicious Southern/Korean-style comfort foods. The customer service here isn't angry at all; it's amazingly friendly and accommodating! There's plenty of space and comfortable tables to dine inside this casual and clean establishment, or you can do take out, or request delivery. They're located in an older side of town, but there's plenty of easy parking and the area doesn't feel unsafe. 

Any of the combo meals can be ordered a la carte, and the wait time isn't overly long considering that there seems to be only one person doing the cooking and one person at the register. The fried catfish was fluffy on the inside (no fishy smell either), crispy on the outside, and well-seasoned. The superb kalbi meat quality and flavor is on par with the best Korean restaurants, and I was even impressed with the thick-cut fries for staying crunchy-soft after my 15 minute drive home.  Oh, and the bbq ribs had this nicely crispy and tender texture too that tremendously pleased my palate and which means I'll probably order a whole rack for next time! I don't know if they make fried chicken, but I saw chicken wings on the menu. I definitely want to try the japchae, bulgogi beef plate, and pretty much everything else now. I hope Angry Blasian succeeds and that more people will discover and come over to experience this unique and up-and-coming eatery for themselves! :)",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,0,1,5,eg41vGlBKaOmt3nbcfeodQ
2957947,2018-06-09,1,7zMwR4FkvTbSGY0vRT5Ljg,"This popped up on my feed as recommended and it's fairly close to my residence. I was able to find the restaurant fairly easy. Walking in I was greeted and the interior was clean. I ended up ordering the catfish combo and a side of mandu. I love the plates the food came on. It was simple yet elegant! The fried fish was very good! It was fresh and not greasy! I ordered a side of Blasian Mac salad which was super good!! The mandu was fresh as well. However it started to get VERY busy and since there was only one cook the delay in getting your food slowed down a bit. Since it's fairly new I feel it's to be expected. However I must mention that I did get a stomach ache after. I don't believe it was the food and I'm hoping it's just my intolerance for fried food, but I'm going to go back and try other dishes for the verdict!",m2hoX1s_gfhmWm82ipNW3w,1,1,4,ATwTkYJVHefMTDNUJLPlIA

This interesting combination of Korean and Southern food drove me to this place in which I did not regret. I ordered the Beef Bulgogi Bowl and it was not only filling but delicious. From the exemplary pickled cucumbers and collard greens, to the main portion of Beef Bulgogi, it was an amazing lunch. Love this new place and hope it continues to gain traction.

4039895,2018-06-10,1,7zMwR4FkvTbSGY0vRT5Ljg,"Angry Blasian is a Korean soul food fusion restaurant on the east side of Las Vegas. They have a few unique items like bulgogi fries and dirty rice with Kim chi. They also have classics like fried catfish and rice bowls.

I like how they have a menu that isn't too big but big enough that you have variety. The fried catfish is a good deal and comes with a side for about $10. Make sure to get hot sauce and tartar sauce! It even came with a drink which is a solid meal. They also have bulgogi fries that are just awesome. The fries are extra crispy and can handle a take out delivery. I'd add a fried egg on top for a wow factor though. 

This is just the establishment the east side needs: unique food that is IG worthy! This specific space has been plagued with businesses that don't last but I wish them well. Their food is solid and Good quality.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,3,5,rxtU4U9BN4_Fr5-d21D-Kg

Flat screen TV menus and wifi add a modern touch. I ordered the catfish and the mac salad. The catfish was perfect. Crispy on the outside tender on the inside. Presentation was spot on. Apparently the owner served in the Navy. BTW thank you for serving. After the military he graduated from CIA or Culinary Institute of America out in New York which is one of the best in America.

5135099,2018-04-30,0,7zMwR4FkvTbSGY0vRT5Ljg,"Discovered this gem while having our tires changed at Discount Tires. Being Korean and having eaten a lot of soul food, we had to check this place out. The menu is simple but appealing. We had a hard time deciding so we ordered about 10 different menu items to eat family style. When the appetizers came, we almost forgot about the entrees-they were that tasty! We had the bulgogi fries, mandoo, deviled eggs, and okra. The okra is indescribable: light, crispy, and not oily. The mandoo, I suppose, is delicious as my daughter ate them all and had no intention of sharing. The deviled eggs were good but not a defined taste. The bulgogi fries were full of big, bold flavor. It tasted like it fries were meant to be eaten with the traditional Korean marinated meat. As for the entrees, the gojujang chicken was cooked well; moist with a hint of smoky bbq flavor. The ethnic flavor was subtle, the chicken itself was the highlight of the dish. My 4 yr old gobbled it down. The kimchee burger did not disappoint, definitely a flavorful fusion dish. My son was also reluctant to share the fried catfish but I got a couple bites. It was wonderfully prepared. Again, not oily but well breaded and cooked, meat was still firm. The owner, upon hearing our inquiries about gluten, offered to batter it solely with cornmeal, leaving out the flour. My son was in heaven as he can't eat most fried foods. Another reason we love southern style cornmeal fried foods. We doubled the collard greens order and we were all still eyeing our portions. They were flavorful; a very subtle smoke flavor, not overly salty or oily. Last item to mention is the kimchee dirty fried rice. Overall the flavor was vibrant; the soy sauce flavor was very subtle and not too salty. ""It was just...tasty!"" Great experience with food and service. Staff was friendly but low key. We purposely bought a variety of food so we could take leftovers to heat at home after the long drive home....wrong",bp-c9JsAS8xYRP3TqC29nA,4,0,5,4TQsdtwC4VQeTbnJT6U1UA
