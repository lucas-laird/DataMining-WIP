Pizza and zuchinni arrived 2.25 hours later, pizza was stil warm and zuchinni coins were good. Delivery guy seemed honest that he recived bad directions, wouldn't order from again. Too many complications.",HT6SDww3H2MEbAh2vXZVCg,2,0,1,sojURCXjboprE3N0uesT1g
2053226,2013-08-11,1,GtrKMt4SFqh7eBl2CKeOIQ,this is the worst place you can get your pizza. I ordered three pizzas for delivery and they told me I was going to be in one hour. at first I said ok thats too long but o well. then the hour came and no pizza. I called back and they told me youre pizza is coning out in 15 min I got upset with them and told them that it was ok. I googked their location and they were 20 min from me and 15 min for the pizza to be ready so I would be getting my pizza in 35min. all this happened yesturday and still havent gotten my pizza. dont get youre pizza from theese fucken stupid people.,laLuemtVVyzsDWh0NEZ11Q,1,0,1,dHhAla6XL9lI-vhlDQCHlw

Not only is this pizza delivery place a rip off, the food is terrible. My adopted mother and I decided to order their fried chicken and fries for lunch. It comes with macaroni or baked beans and a dinner roll for 15 dollars for two plates. For three pieces of chicken, I thought it was pricey, but I wanted to try it. On the side, I ordered 1/2 slab or ribs which was 14 dollars! I thought it would be bigger, but I'll get to that in a minute.

Delivery time is an hour, even if they tell you 30-45 minutes. When the food arrived, I was hoping to see golden chicken, but I found a wet battered fried chicken on wax paper with soggy fries. The fries tasted like they fried it in the morning and let it sit under a hot lamp. The same thing with the chicken. Also, their chicken had sugar or something in the batter that was very unappealing. They also had too much salt in their batter or seasoning. It was the worst fried chicken I've had, and I've eaten burnt chicken before. As for the ribs, it was six SMALL ribs for 13 dollars with very little meat. I'll never order it again because the sauce was--and I know my sauces--KC Masterpiece from the grocery store. A rip off. The dinner roll was a french bread loaf cut in half. That's it. The macaroni and baked beans were in what I consider a ketchup container--small, about 2 tablespoons--because we literally measured what the serving was that came--and tasteless.

If you are looking for a pizza place, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. They take grocery bought products, throw it together, and expect us to believe it's homemade fresh food.

I give this my first 1/5 personal stars.

I'd give it a zero, but I'm trying to be nice.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,8,0,1,KGkx4OIDhUG1nF4KPXbh3g

5046916,2012-11-30,0,GtrKMt4SFqh7eBl2CKeOIQ,I've ordered here twice and both times the food was horrible.  Last night it was spagetti with meatballs and a fried chicken dinner.  the meatballs were horrific as they seemed under cooked and the fried chicken seemed like they were old oil.  the only ok thing was the garlic bread out of the whole meal!  my girlfriend and i ended up ordering a pizza from papa johns because we threw most of what we ordered out.  will never order from this place again!,nyqGp5_D6LffRBqzHw2kbg,1,0,1,K7v9nDF6YyUQ-F8S73o-AA
