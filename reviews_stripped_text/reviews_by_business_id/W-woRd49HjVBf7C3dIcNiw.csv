Ask for extra cheese when they heat up your food, it makes all of the difference.",eC_NTqKh3kAxp9q2rBom_g,0,0,4,7095soARXp1yKd6qaZPlFg

I already gave them my $8.00... and they still wanted $.75 more.  A refill costs them literally a couple pennies.   Basically, this is your typical re-heated thin slice of pizza.  But if they offered free refills, they wouldn't be on blast right now.  A little customer service goes a long ways you guys.  Pay rent but don't short change your paying customers.  Charge more on the soda up front, but give free refills.  Make the customer feel ""royal."" 

I recommend trying the other restaurants at food court.  Sorry to do this to these guys... but come on.  Charge me your price but don't gouge me once I'm already your customer.  If you had free refills, then you don't get this post from me.  Less than average place.",TdPMzrMkZq_-7kU0wF50dQ,0,0,1,FHd-xcAZk_xhsYrwMApdSA
878040,2017-02-10,0,W-woRd49HjVBf7C3dIcNiw,"We were hungry and wanted a quick bite to eat for lunch before doing our shopping. My boyfriend was happy to see Italian food so we decided to give it a try. I saw a Stromboli meal that came with the Stromboli, a side, and a medium drink. I felt that it was a fair deal so I decided to go for it. After putting my Stromboli in the oven to heat it up, the worker asked me what I wanted for a side. Because she was standing in front of the wings, I assumed it was a side and asked for that. When we got to the register to pay, the worker asked us if we wanted a drink. I was confused and said that I had ordered the meal, and she sassily responded that ""that's not a meal, you have wings and that's not a side. Now do you want a drink?"" I was very upset and a nice male worker could tell, so he offered to give us a drink. However the terrible cashier still rang us up and made us pay $3 for a small cup of soda. I was so upset by the whole experience that I lost my appetite and basically ended up throwing away my food. Safe to say I won't eat here again.",AWfDkFnkcledYTT25OtQMQ,0,0,1,T-Bg6qlQmxVn08_0C4pyXQ

Veggie pizza was impressively stuff with veggies, and a nice amount of cheese. Hawaiian pizza had a good amount of ham and pineapple. Really appreciate the shakers of chili peppers and Parmesan at check out. If you need a quick bite, and you need a slice, you will be happy here.",5CzWdjlUeoygnDZdI9vxhw,0,0,5,PK5eBTIDhCne0cR1Nyr2yg
1673258,2014-11-24,4,W-woRd49HjVBf7C3dIcNiw,"This is the token pizza option at the food court- choice of thin crust or pan crust, along with other options like salads, calzones, pastas, and... fried chicken? There's a sign advertising their special chicken, the only catch is it's $6/piece. Pretty absurd.

Pan crust pizza comes in large slices for a normal price, ~$5.
Also options to get a whole pie with two drinks or sides for $24, if you have a group.
Nothing noteworthy about service except that this is one of the quicker lines here.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,2,3,qBe75PRXvww7Pp4FviDu2Q

We all ordered the #5 (Chicken entree) which came with a side (garlic bread) and medium soda.

Meh.  I really have experienced better.

The Stromboli (spinach and cheese roll) rates 3 stars. ($5.50)
The Lasagna, although big enough to share, rates 2 stars.  ($8.00)

Won't be dropping by this place if I am in the area again.",9d45b2HFZUTffGP3MwzNyQ,0,0,2,patOsyfKMrnxqjJ_6IwIow

3860805,2017-10-31,0,W-woRd49HjVBf7C3dIcNiw,If overpriced food thats been sitting for awhile is your thing then this is the place for you. But not for me. My stuffed vegetable pizza pie was soggy and unappatizing.  The pepperoni pizza was stale. The salad? That was okay. In 10 seconds of interacting the service wasnt bad as they rushed me along but no smiles. I know its a get in get out assembly but still you should serve people with a smile when theyre polite to you. The food was very overpriced for what you get. Nearly $3.50 for just a medium soda and $1 to refill. This isnt an amusement park and your for isnt that good.,qRU7nYMJIV05lpKQq4jVjw,1,0,2,rtRVym9-7OkjZzHXj31owg

This food court had a ton of options but I was really craving pasta so I came here. This place is exactly like a Sabarro. I ended up ordering the spaghetti combo. It came with two large meatballs, a garlic bread knotts and pasta salad. I'm writing this review about two weeks late so I can't exactly remember the price but I do remember it was about $10. For the price I paid it came with a ton. I could not finish my food at all. Remembering that it is food court food, I really enjoyed it. The garlic bread knot was sooo good. It was cheesy too and heavenly. The spaghetti and meatballs were good for the most part, but I will say that the meatballs tasted super frozen and processed. But really I couldn't complain considering the circumstances. It was still good though. I couldn't even get to my pasta salad because I was too full.

Overall, pretty good food and it's definitely worth the price.",s9tDFM3F6ZYe8jf6Yk21-Q,0,0,4,DbvtgsGjHXj3_HsYO2tIJA
