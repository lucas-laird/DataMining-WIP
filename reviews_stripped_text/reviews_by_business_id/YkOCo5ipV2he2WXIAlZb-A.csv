42462,2017-03-28,0,YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A,"I really enjoyed the sushi/burrito fusion they offer here. This was my first trip, and the menu is well laid out. I think you could spend an eternity trying to build your own combination of ingredients, so the pre-designed models are a blessing.  I tried the Redondo (seaweed wrapped, sans cilantro, add ginger), and it was very flavorful.

The staff was attentive and helpful with recommendations. Portions were the right size (not too much, not too little). 

My only recommendation is a little more variety on the pre-designed rolls/burritos for quick ordering. I liked the layout of the menu that highlighted the protein in each design first, so keep it up!",GXHjso9fjPpRgiFWq5UzLw,1,0,4,Pj4sF6sjyXgBUmD0D7b5Kw

I pretty much did a 'make your own,' eliminating un-sushi type ingredients from one of their regular items...big mistake I think. Had tuna, yellowtail, masago, cucs and wasabi sauce. The wasabi sauce wasn't spicy enough and just the cucs didn't give enough texture to my burrito. It was still good, just not as good as it might have been if I'd gone with theirs on the menu.

How does it taste?AAmazing!
How do you eat it?Anyway you can, trust me you'll find the way ""
How is it wraped? Sea wead, or sesame seed wraps.
Is it sushi? Yes!""thats what makes it so good , best of both worlds in one paper wrapping. Soft rice on the outside the crunch in the inside.
Is it mexican food? I would say it's about a 50/50. Salsa bar has both salsa and wasabi.""!!! Woa!!

However, this place is about 2 weeks old and the employees are still new at this. This is the reason why I'm reviewing this as a 3 stars for now. 
The new staff are not doing a great job at making this, but I will let this slide. 

Except for some few glaring holes: 
One of the guy piled up all of the brown rice in the middle of my seaweed wrap instead of evenly covering up the whole square area, like you see with the white rice. Doing this will cause my burrito to fall apart easily.  They don't put much in your wrap, one lady was counting the pico de gallos on my burrito, I'm not even kidding. I told her to put more on there and she still counting the tiny scoops instead of normal scoops! She been doing 3 tiny scoops of everything instead of 4 like what the last location normally do. Also they put waaaay too much condiments on it, cause it to get really soggy and drowning out the flavours.

Every time I go there the place is clean and the employees are friendly and helpful. I had this ridiculous mishap with Uber eats delivery service today, and even though it wasn't Jaburritos' fault at all, they went out of their way to contact me directly and apologize for not getting my delivery and to see if there was anything they could do to make it right.

Most companies wash their hands of responsibility when there's another independent party involved like that, and that has always frustrated me as a consumer. You usually hear things like, ""well it's out of our hands"" or ""there's nothing we can do"" which isn't true and definitely not a good way to show your customers you care about their business. I received two different phone calls from Jaburritos to follow up on my order, and they even got Uber eats to send a second driver out to my place for a completely free order, which is super impressive cause I complained like a crazy person and they were only willing to give me a $5.00 coupon for next time. It's just really refreshing to be treated with so much consideration by the staff. It's sadly rare in the service industry these days.

The line people recommended three burritos based on my tastes. I went with the Baja (yellowtail, spicy tuna, guac, tortilla strips, and some other ingredients I don't recall)  the roll was out quickly and it was so good. The fish was pretty much on par with sushi restaraunts  (none of that grocery store BS)!

First off, a vegan/vegetarian menu at a sushi place.. whaaaaattt?!!! Even if it tasted awful, kudos for at least offering something for us non-meat/fish eaters! 

I did the build-your-own vegan gardein steak burrito. Sooo many veggie options..
He got the Acapulco burrito.. Seriously, there are so many options even for the wrap.. Seaweed (what I got), wheat, soy.. we also ordered edemame and chips and queso. Did I mention it has a bit of Mexican infusion?! 

As for the food.. absolutely delicious! For everything!! I asked him if he liked his burrito and with a mouthful of food, scarfing it down I got ""mmm hmmm"".. safe to say he liked it. I feel bad for the guy who delivered it, seeing as how it's raining, but I tipped, so hopefully this makes up for it a little bit. 

They may want to change/update their delivery service app.. I placed the order at 3:03pm, and the email said it would be delivered around 3:13pm..? Even if there was no one in the place and they immediately started the order, it takes around 9 minutes just to drive to my house from there.. we got it in about 23 minutes which in and of itself, is super fast, not to mention, is raining!!

Previously i had ordered a burrito that my friend picked up for me which was a decent size. This time, by recommendation for ""more filling meal"", i had ordered a bowl instead. 

I had realized the only one i've been ordering all this time is Redondo. The Redondo consists of ahi tuna, salmon, yellowtail, red onion, jalapeno, topped with masago, tortilla strips, cilantro, and wasabi mayo. 

They take each order separately and will ask you how many orders you are doing. When i saw how much rice they put into the bowl, i was happy. XD I thought i'd have to ask for more (like i usually do for Chipotle) but it is quite the amount. They use a really small scoop, like a melon baller scoop for the fish but its still a decent amount to saturate the bowl pretty decently while eating. Red onions give a nice sweet and crispness while jalapeno and wasabi mayo gives it a nice punch ! According to some friends, there seem to be more tortilla strips than normal but i didnt mind. Was a nice snack while eating the bowl. Lol 

Speed in ordering wasn't too bad. Fairly decent for what it is. Could be a faster but can't complain. I've been to the other location Soho Sushiburrito on Sahara and it was much smaller than this location and much slower service. Different names on menu but identical ingredients. This is a much more spacious and easier to access location. 

They have a side bar of various salsas, wasabi, and a place for you to get soy sauce as well.

Decent location right off Rainbow and 215, northbound on rainbow, next to Rosallie's. 

Bowl is an amazing deal and will definitely fill you up pretty well. Burrito for the not so big eaters as its still a decent size. Highly recommended place for a quick bite of some fresh seafood.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,5,4,AYnFq-3A_g9rvt9HTWXr4Q

       Went today for the first time and, although the freshness was spot on, they are lacking in a few areas.  
1. No taro chips.   Get them.  People love them
2. No finishing roller machine thingy.  Yes.  That's my name for it because what else is that thing called?   Our burritos fell apart very easily because this was different.
3. WAY smaller burritos.   I think this has to do with their limited ""rolling"" abilities as well.  
4. Slow staff.   This is to be expected with a new place.    I agree with another reviewer in that it seems like they count how many pico tomato cubes they put on.  Lol

     So basically, very tasty but needs work compared to Soho sushi burrito.

******Went back on 5/25/16******

1. Taro chips!    thicker and more oily than Soho's.   Furikake dusting not as tasty.
2. This hand roller still lacks.  Only a few employees seem to know how to roll them tighter. 
3. Better job with size. 
4. Staff speed has increased.   No longer counting every ingredient they put on.  

      With some work, they should get better.",Pub1A9LA1NSg7jNJjbUPJA,0,0,3,g7_QH1StIMdVf_zacuFj1w

They even offer tortilla and guacamole and other things that other sushi burrito places don't usually offer. I didn't get any of that though, I stuck with a more sushi type of burrito. 

I liked that they cut the fish smaller than most places. I didn't like the way they cut the cucumbers. I personally like my cucumbers without skin for sushi burritos.

Their price point is less than a lot of other sushi burrito places, but you also get smaller portion sizes. I ordered the same toppings that I get at other places, but my burrito was smaller and didn't fill me up as much. 

The staff was okay, but they weren't very friendly or welcoming. The interior of the place was also kind of weird. It had an an institutional type of feeling. I'm not an expert on interior design or anything like that, but it just didn't feel comfortable in there. 

So overall the food was pretty good, but nothing special unless you really want Mexican style sushi burritos. I'm going to stick with sweet poke down the road",C1ZaCb7v6vxw4D0_2tXDfQ,1,1,3,rLO8ork5dVPD7c2ISbz3Rw

I have now been to this location, and I went to their last location Soho. I'm not sure what people are saying about a different menu. It looks identical! The pictures are the same and all. I liked being able to customize my burrito but everything tastes pretty bland and the portion size is tiny! My husband customized his burrito and it ended up being $28 for 2 burritos and 1 soda. I think that's steep for the size of it. My husband customized his order and I think $1.50 for each protein is a lot when you ask for tamago and you get two 1/2 inch piece. The woman ringing us up had to talk to several people in order to figure out how to ring us up. She couldn't figure it out and needed various opinions. The owner was not in the assembly line of people but he did come out after and ended up coming over and was nice enough to fix it all and apologized. 

My burrito was made with rice paper and brown rice. At the last location it all stayed together. This burrito was soggy and it soaked through the rice paper and it ripped apart making it impossible to pick up. Switching to seaweed was helpful with holding the burrito together. 

I did not see the salsa bar like the last location  which was a turn off with the store bought Pace Picante type salsa and I'm sorry raw fish and salsa just don't go well together. I get it is ""burrito"" and ""sushi"" but for me I think sushi burritos would be better with ponzu or something that pairs well with raw fish. 

I still don't get the nacho cheese with taro chips. Also why does their nachos have tortilla chips? Would be so much better with wonton chips. 

As far as the people working there, you have a poor woman who is really trying but she is so slow and forgets things. She also uses gloves then touches doors and other things (pet peeve of mine- why are you touching my food with your bare hands then touching walls and doors?grrr) you also have someone having a hard time ringing people up. Also when I ask for light on the sauce, I really would like light on the sauce. Just like Subway I ask for light mustard and I get 3 tablespoons. The same thing happened here. Light means soaked in sauce.  Maybe I will be back if they fix some of the issues I mentioned.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,6,3,3,GX9baLL76e6OLEuVX_Nz9Q

The BAJA ($9) is my preference, with a fresh salsa that really makes it shine as a fusion dish rather than just a large sushi roll. The MALIBU ($8) was a little basic, and the LONG BEACH was a step up- as expected, since it contains more fish and a higher price tag to match ($11).

Note the salsa bar around the corner by the register- actual salsas are available, as well as more traditional sushi accouterments like soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger.

What I love about Jaburritos is the menu. This is very much a Chipotle setup. You can choose a burrito, bowl, or nachos. You have a chef's creation menu on one side and then a build your own on the other. You can customize all the way up to what you want your burrito wrapped in. Classic seaweed? Soy paper? Tortilla? They have plenty of sauce choices like wasabi mayo, Yuzu Avocado Cilantro, Mango Teriyaki. It's your choice how adventurous you want to be. 

Seeing as it was my first time, and how unfamiliar I am with the sushi burrito concept, I didn't decide to build my own for fear of greatly ruining my own experience with bad decisions. I ordered a chef's creation, The Redondo. I added avocado, cause why the hell not? And just like chipotle, it costs extra. That never gets old. 

They have a bar of self serve wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, cilantro, etc. This took it over the top for me. I love A LOT of ginger. So it was nice to be able to help myself.

Not only was every member of the team here a friendly, engaging personality, but they truly went above and beyond! So, if none of you have ever gone with me for food, let me start by saying that I am one of the most waffling people when it comes to a good menu full of delicious food! Business owners: if I can't decide what I want from your menu, that's a good sign that I love what I'm seeing and your menu is probably great. Anyways, back to Jaburrito's. The gal at the counter was so helpful and friendly, that not only did she propose a solution to one part of my indecisiveness (getting 2 smaller, but equally scrumptious hand rolls of different flavors rather than one large sushi burrito), but she also then surprised my friend and I by bringing a small sample bowl of their newest flavor to our table! Almost no one shows that level of commitment to the happiness of their customers, especially not the needier ones who can sometimes (I'm sure) be obnoxious with their indecisiveness. I would give a 6th star if I could, will tell anyone who will listen about this outstanding experience, and can't wait to be back for another great lunch at Jaburrito's.",qMm0KPZwkv74kscog7wcUA,0,0,5,1yF-Dzofsv_vlYVCKM0zxQ

2223205,2016-08-22,0,YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A,"Tried Jaburrito on Sahara (Now called SOHO Sushi Burrito, which is probably under different management) and we fell in love. Service was great, the workers were fast to put everything together and of course the burrito was amazing! I was so excited to see a Jaburrito opening up on rainbow which is closer to my home.

However we had a complete opposite experience when we came to Jaburrito on rainbow. 

Major disappointments
1. Before we began to build our burrito, I had asked the guy if they had Salmon. Immediately we were lied to as the guy told us ""No, we,re all out."" And because My friend and I looked at each other and thought to ourselves if we should just go b/c we both had the cravings for salmon.. The guy than says, ""Oh... Oh wait we can cut it for you in the back if you could just give us about 10 minutes"" ......Um we're thinking I thought there was NONE left ?? o.O 
2. After waiting the 10 minutes and they were ready to build our burrito, it was time to choose our rice. I chose brown rice while my friend chose white rice. My friends white rice came ready out of the machine, while the girl handling my burrito had to spread the brown rice on the wrap instead. Which btw took at least five minutes.... I felt bad b/c if was holding up the line and it looked like she was doing this for the first time. All the workers looked a bit confused, kind of just standing around and they were not working as fast as the other location on Sahara.
3. Aside from being lied to, the main reason we will Not be coming back to the rainbow location is because Both my rice and my friends rice taste horrible. My brown rice and my friends White rice were both extremely Mushy, sour and unpleasantly hard to swallow. We came home and were excited to eat our burrito but unfortunately we were so disappointed we opened up the burritos and only ate the insides while leaving the rice. 
4. In addition, they had NO taro chips.

I felt like I wasted my money at this location. We were still hungry and went back out to get food else where.",Ei5MD6BRRZjyhW5FaVAQPQ,1,0,2,Xu8_TF7kDjlNHNQ9OPr3Eg

I love the options.  I ordered the mission and substituted Ebi for shrimp tempura.  Was almost regretting a flour tortilla.  The tortilla is very thin and doesn't take away from the roll.  I don't love seaweed, since these are much larger than sushi... Might've been overpowering for me.  The yuzu avocado sauce was great, could have had more.

Being a huge fan of the Soho restaurant and seeing how a lot of people have raved about the original location I was definitely excited. And apparently I wasn't the only one since the line almost made it out the door. Sushi burritos who'd figure!?

If you've never been it's kind of like Chipotle/Subway for sushi rolls. You can customize your roll by first choosing your protein which includes spicy tuna, cajun albacore, salmon, steak, chicken, and more. Then how do you want it, as a salad/rice bowl, wrapped it a tortilla like a burrito, rolled as sushi, or with chips like nachos. Then your sauces and toppings. If you're not great at customizing get one off the menu they all sound good and prices ranged from about $5 to about $11 and of course the customized on could be whatever price.

I went with the Baja which included yellowtail, spicy tuna, cilantro, red onion, cabbage, tortilla strips, guac, lettuce, jalapeños, and a zuzu avocado cilantro sauce. It wasn't that bad. Honestly I was kind of disappointed at the size. I've heard a lot of it being huge. Even saw many pics where rolls dwafted peoples hands. In about 3 of my normal bites it would've been gone. People really do have tiny hands foreal! Drink plenty of water or soda, nibble, or dish out more get another roll.

I was told by an employee that they're not serving everything the original location has.

Inside I counted 14 tables with 2 chairs each so there's enough room for 28 . It's not elbow to elbow seating so they could probably but a few more tables and chairs. 

As of now it's 3.5 stars from me. I like em but not enough to give em the 4th star.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,11,10,3,kyimU4g3OCZN0Tegd6BTQQ

 :( Instead I got the stern, less enthusiastic lady that was clearly impatient. If I didn't order quick enough the lady just kept asking me the same question to put the pressure on. Smh. Service really is a game changer when you're looking for your Poke burrito/bowl go to spot. The food is nearly the same everywhere.

The bowl didn't have as much flavor as my usual burrito. Yes, I got the Redondo again! It seemed like it just needed a double order of sauce or maybe just a drizzle on top. Also the chopped jalapeños all ended up on one side of the bowl, maybe there should be a method to mix it in with the fish because that was a very unpleasant (yet funny) surprise. We had our lunch date here because they actually have something cooked for kids that I saw on the online menu and even though it was bland being just chicken and rice it's nice that they even have an option. Most of these types of places do not. 

I'll be back eventually but I'll be hoping for the nice, patient guy with green eyes or someone who actually wants to earn a big fat tip by being friendly and kind.

Pros:
--All of the workers greeted me when I walked in, and I mean ALL OF THEM yelled ""Welcome to Jaburritos"" at the same time!
--Place was clean with lots of tables to eat at.
--Their ingredients were fully stocked.
--Nice location, easy to find.

Cons:
--I was the only person ordering and the whole process went soooooooo slow! Even the person at the register talked so slow to the point where I felt myself crunch my eyebrows.
--One person took all my order and passed the list to another person who made it. I felt like that was more time consuming in my situation although I'm sure thats a very good idea when it's packed in there. 

Just a side note:
--It really bothered me how the guy put my bowl in the bag sideways and then turned it upwards and handed it to me. The other guy took his time placing everything in the bowl so nicely just to have it all mixed in and ugly when I opened it.",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,2,3,3,MfW6gB0EwBmsws6elUDn1A

It's a restaurant, so the rating boils down to two things: food & service. If you've looked at my other reviews you know I don't give out 5 stars frequently, but I just feel like this place consistently exceeds my expectations and has earned it. 

Food: it's sushi so you assume it's super fresh, but that's not always the case. Swing into JaBurritos though and your going to get super fresh and tasty fish. The portions are plentiful and there's no way you'll leave hungry. The flavors are on point and there's a variety of fillings, sauces, and extras that makes your meal ""yours."" There are plenty of options, but I'm a seaweed wrap guy. Maybe I'll try a bowl, tortilla, or something next time. 

Service: I thought the first time here that I got lucky to have someone who must be an owner or manager helping me, because the service was way to friendly for the type of restaurant (picture Chipotle or Subway, but with sushi / Mexican / Asian inspired fresh & healthy options).  Well - three or four times, visits to both the Rainbow and Linq locations, and everyone has the same great attitude. 

Also important in a restaurant is cleanliness. If the place wasn't clean I wouldn't have stuck around long enough to taste the food or write a review.  So I guess that a review really boils down to 3 things?

Last thing about this place - it's wallet friendly. Usually I can get out of here for under $10 (I'm trying to consume more water) but even adding a couple of bucks for a combo and you'd be pressed to spend more than $12 or $13.

Hope you take the time to stop by and try it. I'd live for them to do well enough to open another shop someplace a little more convenient to me when I'm working. It's a great lunch!",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,0,0,5,p78uerLXlM9-dRhZaxfdIw

The idea of Jaburritos isn't a new one, but they are delicious alternative to most for the lunch spots in the area. Like a lot of the newer faster paced eateries hitting Vegas, Jaburritos does both the ""you create it"" or ""premade"" style or ordering. If it's your first time here go with the premade Jaburrito, it will be a way less stressful especially if a line is forming behind you. Oye, that's too much pressure. 

For the timid sushi eater I suggest going with the Rockport, Malibu, or the Redondo. They are all pretty basic sushi rolls filled with all the inauthentic Japanese goodness that we've come to love in Americanized sushi; imitation crab, shrimp, avocado, cucumber and some type of spicy creamy sauce. The three rolls I mentioned earlier in the review have those basic ingredients give or take some Masago. My personal favorite and repeat order has been the Rockport, its a beats stuffed with Soft Shell crab, Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab (Crab Paste) Jalapeno, Masago, cucmuber, a tempura crunch and eel sauce.

We got down with working out and were starved so it was time for a Sushi Burrito.
   We drove the quick 2 miles to their location and were happy to know they are next to several of our favorite places - Pie Me Over and Rosallie.  What a perfect spot as we can get treats from all of them during our next visit!  The inside was simple and has the feel of not being fully finished.  It was very clean and since it is fast casual not a big thing.  
   We were happy to see they went have the original Jaburritos menu.  Since we had been to Soho Sushi Burritos several times it was confusing to decide which was our favorite.  We had been to the former Jaburritos a couple of times before the name change.  We got the Redondo, Baja, Huntington, Long Beach, and Mission.

The ingredients were all fresh and so tasty.  The fish was very fresh and made the meal perfect.  We all had a moment of Zen as we devoured our sushi burritos.  
   We also ordered the chips and cheese which also came with a surprise.  The cheese was spicy unlike the other location.  Again not a bad thing but something to be aware of if you are not a fan of spicy food.  They only had standard chips but did say Taro chips will be added to the menu soon.
   If you love sushi then Jaburritos is a place you need to visit.  The best thing is you don't have to wait the normal agonizing time to get your delicious food.  You can eat in and quickly be on your way home with your tasty meal.  And if you have a sweet tooth they are in the same building as Rosallie which if you haven't been too will be a perfect dessert to add to your meal.",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,16,14,5,OF7WHeX4JmuhuXbNvqdRog

3700705,2017-09-22,0,YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A,"Hmm.... I honestly cannot figure out how Jaburrito have 4.5 stars. Here is my reasoning:

The food is mediocre. They have some interesting names for their menu items, but that's about it. The ingredients are not as fresh as they should be. The sauces are the simple one that anyone can make at home. There are not that many ingredients to choose from. I think they lack the crucial characteristics that all sushi burritos should have. 

The services is below-average too. The employees were lost half the time. They did mixed up the items among customers. They constantly had to ask each other about what's going on. At least they were nice and friendly.

The interior was simply bad... The entire restaurant seemed unfinished. The interior was just as confusing as the employees.

My overall exeprience was unsatisfying. There are so many sushi burrito/poke places around the area. There is no reason for me to go back to Jaburitto.",vsZy481c3AVrl1ht-qwMuA,0,0,2,x4iC_MyetAE5uVvAyn9RDg

They essentially offer the same items as the Sahara location where you can build your own burrito/bowl or nacho's or order off of their list of yummy creations. I chose the latter both times I visited. First day was the Redondo on soy paper and second day was the Rockport! Holy cow!!! They were both amazing!! The staff is super friendly and make sure you get what you want and offer any extra sauces on the side you might be craving.

The toppings section is really great too with a variety of fresh veggies and homemade sauces.

I don't think it's fair to compare this place to Soho, but if you must, I think Jaburritos stands up to its sister.  The fish is fresh, the ingredients are delicious and the staff is friendly.  If Soho Burrito were closer, I would go there.  Not because it is any better than this place, but because John from Soho is the nicest person on the planet.

I've been to Ja Burrito quite a few times since they opened this location. I was excited to see it opening when I went over to Rosallie. 

I've always ordered the bowl with salmon, tempura shrimp, sumiri crab and cucumbers! There's an extra charge for actual avocados so I just put on the avocados at home. I am also in love with the Jachos. I saw another fellow Yelpers picture of Jachos and I knew I needed to get it. My husband always orders the burrito with spicy tuna (too spicy for this girl) and whatever else is in it. 

There are a lot of people working behind the counter so the ordering process goes by pretty quickly. There's a rewards club which I would highly suggest you join if you plan on coming back a lot like myself! Get the house soy sauce too!",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,3,1,5,b6Yl0-T18pYW6H2g8mi_Ag

I see it as a Chipotle version of poke. 
Choose your fish. Or not, they have imitation crab and omelettes for those who don't eat fish. Unless you choose one from the $5.95 protein options of spicy tuna, sweet omelette, krab, or sweet shrimp, you'll probably end up paying more for your burrito or bowl then one of their thought-out burritos on the menu. 
Then choose your wrapping. Seaweed and soy paper are more popular. I have yet to see anyone eat theirs in a tortilla. Then top it off with veggies and crispy toppings. Their salsa bar is a little underwhelming, though, as I'm not sure watery salsas go well with these burritos, which are more Japanese than Mexican. I just go with the ginger
Yes, the sizes are a tad smaller than that of SoHo, but I think it's a perfect size: It's just enough to get me full, but not make me uncomfortably so.

This location is soooo much more convenient than the other one. They are cleaner here, where the other one is filthy...as in don't look at that messy pile on the floor.

Cons:
The rice is too mushy and doesn't bind the burrito well. The protein fillings are bland. They don't have a screaming orgasm sauce (EVERY SUSHI place NEEDS screaming O sauce). The taro chips (now offered) are too thick with some being greasy and undercooked.

I'm not sure why they need 7 people working a short line and a seemingly oblivious guy working the cash register.

My go to order is a Long Beach burrito. It's the perfect blend of spicy and crunchy! It's spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla chips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, & sweet anguilla sauce.  

My only flaw in Jaburritos is their online ordering option, I used uber eats to order a Long Beach. I didn't know how the system worked to order, I assumed once I selected the Long Beach that all the options that are in the burrito were already selected. Turns out that you have to select the options you want in the burrito and any addition options as well. I thought that was a minor flaw. When I got my order I found that the only items that were in my burrito were the ones I selected, I thought the options I selected would be added to the included ingredients. Also the sweet Anguilla sauce wasn't an option to select so you have to side note it.

The manager of JaBurritos earned the 2 extra stars.  We ended up eating on the patio near Rosalie Cafe.  The cashier must have relayed our feedback right away because within 5 mins, the manager came out to apologize for the smell and acknowledged it is the shortcoming of the building during winter time where the ventilation is poor.  He gave us 4 individually wrapped ice cream mochi's and was sincerely trying to salvage our experience.  Fast forward 5-7mins later, manager came out again to offer to comp our next meal after he got a notification on my Yelp review (which was posted immediately after we ordered and before we received our food.)  To be clear, when he came out the first time, he didn't know about my posted Yelp review.  We are impressed with how much attention he gives to ensure customer satisfaction.  Again, the food is good here but my experience and appetitie was largely affected by a building issue, and not the taste/price/or service.

Original post (2 Stars):
Smells so fishy in here .. like the seafood department of an Asian grocery store.  The original JaBurrito near Charleston UMC, now caled SOHO Burrito doesn't have the bad smell and it's the same menu / price.  Just 5 mins in there and my hair / clothes picked up the odor.  The cashier said it's probably from when they fry the unagi (eel) because it smells bad like that every time the kitchen cooks it.  

We ordered it to go to sit in our car to eat it since we can't stand the nauseating greasy and fishy smell.  I would check out Poke Puku down a few more blocks or SOHO Sushi Burritos off Jones & 215 instead of this location since ventilation isn't something that would get fixed by an owner unless required by law.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,3,1,4,XUdg-lRoB4r_BVMDtOTBCA

4934595,2016-05-29,1,YkOCo5ipV2he2WXIAlZb-A,"Ja,  this is a great place for a fusion of Japanese with a sort of not Mexican but more of a California Twist

1. The food - These are burrito or bowl type choices in the genre of Chipotle.  You get to pick all the wraps and the protein, sauces and toppings.

2.  The choices - They have here about 12 burritos that are set in a menu preselected with ingredients.  For the uninitiated where choosing everything can be a bit much, these 12 choices are very good. I won't go into the details as you can go to their website and see all the choices and flavors.  The good news is that they are all pretty good.  I find that it is a bit difficult to really differentiate the taste of each one as when you meld everything together and with the sauces, the flavors are a bit fused.

3.  Do it yourself - You can certainly look at all the individual proteins, wraps, sauces and toppings and create your own burrito or bowl. You can order double protein and or mix/match the protein.

4.  The wraps - Flour, wheat, seaweed, soy paper are the different kind of wraps that you can use for your burrito.  You can use brown rice or white rice too!

5.  The combo - When you order your burrito or bowl, you can also order it as a combo with a drink and either Miso, Edamame, Corn Chips, Taro Chips.  The Taro chips are sprinkled with Furikake and both chips come with a queso sauce that is pretty good.

6.  Vegan - If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you can order gardien tofu and set up your burrito or bowl to be completely vegan.  

GK says, check it out.  Pretty fun, different and new to try.  I cannot say that the flavor is out of this world, as it is truly hard when there is so much sauce, however, it is FUN to try and tastes good overall",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,3,4,XgQ-FH45lurSUCHcexhUSw

Going there with the expectations to be served a dish like the one I saw on Instagram was my mistake. Now...don't get me wrong. The food did taste pretty good! It was just not as appealing as what I had seen in pictures. 

The sushi burrito per se is big enough for one person. I ordered the nachos too but was a bit disappointed to see that the chips come from a bag. They are not made there in store...at least they did not taste like they were. 

Another thing that caught me by surprised is that I thought this would be more of a restaurant type. The place is more set up as a fast food joint. Overall the food was good but not a place I would drive out of my way to come visit.",e1z9K45idYRUBn7Sps6T1w,0,0,3,1ox4JxW0ga3A-nXzLS5g2Q

I was pretty stoked to try this place because like many I'm a sushi junky. I walked in blind and there were plenty indecisive people like myself trying to figure out what to order. After a short debate I went with the ""ROCKPORT"" and it was an excellent choice! Just the right amount of spicy, fresh and delish!!!!

I would definitely return in the near future. My only gripe was the staff. I assume this restaurant is new which is awesome and the concept it great but the staff should be a lot more confident. I asked for my burrito wrapped with seaweed and the two employees seemed very confused and kept conversing amongst each other before preparing my order. I ordered one mochie and a young man at the register rang me up for two and asked me literally four times which dessert I ordered. Practice definitely makes perfect and I suspect the staff will get better over time.

They were definitely training. Everyone was really nice.  The menu board is simple and I chose the rodondo burrito with seaweed paper.  It was $10.75 I think.  and I got a side of seaweed sald for $1.50 I think.  The restaurant was actually a little busy. The inside was really nice looking and clean as well.  Before leaving I made sure to get some of their soy sauce (which was in a pump). I got home and opened up my order, it looked really good and tasted very good as well.  Their soy sauce was not soy sauce though, it was a little thicker and more like a terriyaki glaze. But it was still very good.  As far as food quality, I'd definitely go back. I think everything I had was very very good.  I just felt the portion size was a bit small.  Either lower the price just a little bit or make the burritos a little bigger. It was definitely filling if you want a light-med lunch, but for dinner by itself was not nearly enough and buying 2 which would've been approx $20 is not worth it.  So yea, I'd definitely go for lunch but just not for dinner.

Once you walk in, you are greeted by the whole staff. They did an amazing job explaining how it works. I ordered the Redondo and was amazed of the quality of the sushi. Great color and texture while the condiments of cucumber,chips,wasabi mayo,red onion, and masago. I love how the burrito was made and wrapped. One side was ahi tuna, the other side was yellow tail, and the middle was salmon. I believe this spot pulls ahead of their competition because they don't drench the sushi with excessive sauce like other places; because they want you to taste the quality of the fish and not mask it.

Also, quality control was AMAZING. As I was ordering, an associate was checking each insert to make sure it was in the correct temperature. On top of that, each and every associate was doing something on their down time. Restocking,cleaning,building burritos, etc. All with a smile.

Kind of like those other burrito places where you order the burrito and they build it in front of you, but with sushi style ingredients and some fusion ingredients.  I ordered the Kodak, a salmon based Jaburrito, with the wheat wrap, Options of wraps being seaweed, rice, tortilla, or wheat.  The salmon wrap was excellent!!  And I ordered the combo with seaweed salad as my side.  A great lunch overall. 
Jaburrito also emphasizes their use of eco friendly products and building systems, maybe shooting for a LEED rating, which is admirable, in my opinion and another reason to support this business.  The food alone has my business.  Highly recommend.",miuLlOYWfT6hIJuoe1PkQg,1,1,5,NbK0tFOr37kcOnlcnd12cQ

I ordered: a custom sushi burrito: 
Protein-spicy tuna and shrimp tempura
Wrapping-soy paper
Rice-white
Sauce-cilantro avocado yuzu and sweet eel
Addings-seaweed salad and tempura flakes

I would order the same exact burrito again. Imagine a poke bowl in a burrito. I've had Sushirito in San Francisco and I give them 4/5 stars just because their ingredients seem tastier and because they are the OG's when it comes to this sushi burrito craze.

The food is delicious. I usually get the Rockport rolled inside a sushi wrapper. It contains all fresh ingredients including soft shell crab, surimii crab, tuna, jalapenos, cucumbers, tempura crunch and chipotle mayo. I usually hold the red onions! If you want to try sushi burritos, this is a GREAT non-intimidating PLACE to start. The pricing is on point too, about 7 to 11 dollars for this big sushi burrito.

Felt like sushi and referred to my Yelp bookmarks and realized Jaburritos was on my list. So glad it was. 

Everyone was super friendly and helpful given it was my first time and I needed a moment. Had salmon and tuna in a seaweed wrapper burrito. Great suggestions with the sauces of ponzu and a new spicy mayo. You can add whatever other additions you would like as well like seaweed salad, jalapeños, green onion... The burrito was so satisfying and all for the small price of 7.99 including the 2 fish and avocado. You can't get a roll that big and delicious for 7.99 at a sushi restaurant.

I've only gotten these 3 on the numerous times I've visited. 

Redondo - hands down winner. only get this now. 
Huntington - only ordered this once, nothing special 
Baja - only ordered this once, nothing special 

Let me tell you, get the bowl! More food. And opt for salad instead of rice if you want to eat healthier/conscious of diet. 

I come here super often, especially since I work down the street, but it's only 4 stars because the staff is slow so when there's a long line, beware. They may not be used to it or they just naturally can't keep up but every time I'm here I know it's not going to be a quick ""get my food get out"" thing. 

I hear they also just incorporated online (their website)?and app (chownow) ordering so that may be a good solution for people (like me) that always order to-go.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,1,4,N7uhrFaaFQDm2yzp-6N2tA

For what they are putting down, making. The food is great. Yummy. Fresh and you are able to substitute when needed. Extras may cost some $. But never much. It is much better than getting those pre-made sushi sold in stores to get your sushi fix for less money than going to get sushi at your favorite place. Quick. Easy. Good.  

I like it and whenever I can I will go. Push throw time traffic and get a sushi burrito. Yum. Sometimes it's hard just to get one or for you not to eat it all before getting home.  It's that good to me. Like the variety of items that go into their specialty rolls 

Of course it's not that high quality sushi. Affordable. And not Hawaiian grade poki or anything but close enough for Vegas. 

PS. The customer service I receive is always on point. I can and am very social and just like in Hawaii, love to chat it up. All the employees who have helped me are nice friendly and quick to make your order. 

They also have a rewards program of some sort (can't quite remember all of it) but they will explain and help you out with it if you ask them. Also get email discount and with yelp you can also get cash back when registering your card.",Ornv3WTcUpGIgMnNLdDE2g,0,0,5,WwCOeajhfOnbgDjSKsWEqA

We ordered a Rockport ($10.95 - Soft shell crab, spicy tuna, imitation crab, jalapeño, masago, cucumbers, red onions, tempura crunch, with chipotle mayo and eel sauce on soy paper) and a Mission ($8.95 - Salmon, ebi shrimp, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, with yuzu avocado cilantro on soy paper) to share. Both were made as combos, one with seaweed salad and one with taro chips that also comes with a side of queso cheese. It could be because we had just got off the plane but everything we had was quite tasty. I ended up swapping half my Mission for half a Rockport and by the time I finished my half of the Mission, I was too full to eat the Rockport. After a few bites of the Rockport, I gave it back and later regretted it because it was damn good. I like how both burritos had a crunchy element for texture. Yum! Those taro chips are also amazing and sweet. They didn't even need the queso.

Service here is great, the place was clean, and parking was plentiful. I want to go back like right now!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,44,43,4,lRm52xDfGMsbbui2B2vRAA

As soon as you walk in, they greet you right away and are ready to help, especially if you've never been there before.

It can be too much (which is definitely NOT a bad thing) I ended up saving half for a little bit later.
