so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email.

By  the time I got to the register it was 3 minutes until close and the associates were just giving the most hateful glares. This was my first and last time in that smiths.

There were some super deals this weekend and I'm so pleased that I didn't miss out. Smith's has really expanded healthy and organic options and they reduced the prices across the board on all of their produces. I use their app, so I get digital coupons and free stuff every Friday.

Fry's Food Stores are the equivalent in AZ so they have exactly the same deals and quality products and that is why Smith's would be my grocery store of choice here in Vegas. One huge issue with grocery stores is that the don't always have or never seem to have those few particular items you really want. A couple of those examples are Sweet Chili Doritos (yes they are the only VEGAN Doritos that exist) and Grape Crush (because who doesn't like Grape Crush). Well we found both at this Smith's location and we were extremely excited. Now don't get me wrong we don't eat this kind of Junk Food often....even though it is VEGAN....but we would like to purchase these items from time to time but NO ONE ever has them.

And she was incredibly rude didn't care that I had just had to deal with all of this crap because they don't know how to put in proper self checkout systems! Don't even get me started on the fact that the store was stocking everywhere at 9:30 pm so you couldn't even get to things! This location and the location on Tropicana and jones have really let me down with customer service. I went there once and had a big event so had a lot of groceries $275 worth. They wouldn't open a checkout lane so I had to do self checkout. Had nowhere to put the groceries and I couldn't put the already bagged ones in the cart so they piled up.

Quite frequently they have out produce for sale that should've already been thrown away. I've caught pricing discrepancies (always ringing up more than marked) on multiple visits. Requiring a second trip to the store for a refund.  The final straw for me with this location was an incident Friday night.

 I was in the express lane. The woman in front of me had about triple the 15 item limit but whatever. She paid and was digging in her purse while the cashier started scanning my items. Then the customer picks a scab on her face(her face and arms are covered)&  it starts bleeding. The girl bagging asked the cashier if she had any napkins. She suggested the woman go to the restroom. She instead heads towards the parking lot. When I pay I get my few bags and notice one of my items is missing. It was the second thing rung up. I asked the bagger where it was. She told me I didn't buy the item. I showed her my receipt and told her she put it in the other woman's bag. She argued that the other woman bought it ( if that were true-where did mine go). She was rude and defensive. She went to go get it back from the woman. The cashier told me to go get another one. I did. When I got back the bagging clerk still never apologized and asked me why she had to go get the item from the woman if I got one from the shelf. I explained bc I paid for it & the other customer did not. . Also I don't want one that I know was touched by someone bleeding. I don't know if this is a scam she's running or what. I couldn't believe that she was never once apologetic. It wasn't a big deal until she was rude and had an attitude like I had given away something she spent money on.

They had one experienced guy that used to work here but he probably moved on to bigger and better.

I agree with the other review unfortunately a lot of homeless but not as bad as the Albertsons down the street they sleep right in front of the entrance, but back to my issue. 

Please be aware when you get your groceries. Almost every time I have gone in I come home and something wasn't bagged or was not put in my cart and left behind. Bottle of wine , shredded chicken , bread , just to name a few things that are missing. And this is not cheap stuff. I bought recently shredded chicken 10 bucks worth ...never got it sure as heck was on my receipt though . I have had to go back and get wine they forgot to put in my cart a couple months ago. I mean I can't go through every grocery bag before I put it in my car .


But like I said store is clean and staff is always super nice - can you please just get all my groceries I paid for in my cart ???? If it was just one time I wouldn't be so harsh but I am almost to the point I will drive a little farther to another Smith's to make sure I get everything.",yPr31e8JjIp0P2Qbt9yfcA,0,0,1,ox8UEqxjHwr4eoj5vflgDw

(We've been to this one before, except, I was in the car with our toddler son, at the time.) I am loving our new side of town, I must say!

It was night time, so their door was limited to just one for the entrance and exit. One side, upon entering, the right side, was lined with a long line of carts, so as to create a block. Did not see a security guard.  

I was able to get the last bag of ""Healthy Weight"" for our dogs. I also grabbed something for my lunch salad (some sections were empty, must be a night time thing). And a couple other things from an inside aisle I won't mention for my husband's upcoming birthday. Hint, it's sweet. Heehee.

Self- checkout was packed. I moved. I was able to get into the 15 items or less line. Fast checkout. The clerk was nice. The store, from what I saw, was clean. No crazies. No screaming babies. Steady flow of customers, told my hubby, the majority was asian, though it was all types represented. The parking lot looked more full (it is at a strip mall) than I saw customers inside (maybe they were all over?).   

Has a US Bank inside (atm as well). Also noticed that the gift cards were situated near the front door, which I thought was a bit odd.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,2,4,2nRK3UlH89MiafJwZr6WcA

The pricing is reasonable, no complaints here.  The service was exceptional.  The meat guy was kind enough to go look in the back for more beef tenderloin cuts that were on sale and was very nice about it.  

Also, they have a build your own 6-pack of craft beers for $8.99 so worth it if you know the right kinds to include.  They had the red IPA from Stone, so you for sure get your money's worth!

It is just as good as any other Smith's I've shopped at which is a good thing.  Friendly and fast customer service in the meat department and the marinated carne asada (when cooked at home) was good. Not as tender as I had hoped, but seasoned nicely.  The Smith's phone app has always worked for me and the stores have always had enough of the Friday Freebies.  The layout is clean and I can typically find what I'm looking for.  If you synchronize (choose a store location within the app)  the phone app with the Smith's you are actually shopping in, it will help you locate items by using the search protocol!

One particular attendant was veey unprofessional the way she acted when a customer needed help. 
Her description is a light skinned black girl that wears a neon vest. When (I) the customer needed help she just stood there by the screen rolling her eyes making attitude faces like she don't want to be bothered. Very lazy employee need to be fired. 
A pregnant lady was walking to the atm and she didn't move to the other side to give space for the pregnant lady to get to the atm. 
Evening staffs at this Smith store are not well-trained to deal with error transactions especially when dealing with cash back. One would say cashback available to $100, then later on same employee will say no cashback we can't do it. I can't help you. 

I am not going back to this store. Very disappointing and was stressful  too. Since i accidentally left merchandise necause of the cashback commotion and even with receipt they can't help me reimbursed what i purchased or replaced it. 
There were 4 employees and no one ask the customers if they got everything with them.

An employee named Sara, who claimed that she was the manager, told my husband that he couldn't have a shopping cart. Then she followed us through the store (until we reached the back of the store) and taunted him with a cart. As soon as his back was turned, she said loudly, ""he doesn't have the balls to face me."" Then she walked away. I followed her and said very politely, ""excuse me, excuse me, ma'am."" She completely ignored me and walked away, like literally through the entire store. Another cashier told her, ""there's a customer you're ignoring."" Sara said, ""I'm not talking to that bitch.""

I told her that I didn't appreciate the way she spoke to my husband and that her behavior was unprofessional. She told me to speak with the manager. I said, ""I'd love to."" And then she smiled a big broad smile and said, ""I'M THE MANAGER."" 

When we went to check out, she continued to harass my husband. When I told her I video'd her bad behavior, she offered to let us use her employee discount. Um, no thanks, crazy.

Example: Zevia canned soda. It was on sale for $3.99 so went to pick up a few six packs and of course the cola was out.  I went to customer service and stood in line to get a Raincheck for when it's in stock again.  I was told the truck would deliver more that night.  The next morning I went back...no Zevia cola.  I have been been back to that store numerous times over the past few weeks and no Zevia cola.  I guess I either give up or try a different Smiths store.  Why issue a raincheck if you never have the product in stock? Grrrrrrr,ow8I1Qxh3uI6I1zf2JQNjQ,0,0,3,L4iOV50s0c2S3KLlyre5SA
