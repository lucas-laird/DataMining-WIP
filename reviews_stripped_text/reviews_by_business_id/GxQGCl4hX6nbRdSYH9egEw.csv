I came with 6 friends last night only to be greeted with a sign that they were closed for the night for a private party and please go to their other location on Decatur. After finally gathering everyone together, we drove to the other location to find that one also closed. WTF?! Now you've wasted all of our time for no reason. Totally disrespectful and unprofessional.",noZoIj8rHPHsNzMsn1HojA,0,0,1,HOhZrYiRz3tF93mJKy4fLA

Maybe next time I will try a burger because the Portobello burger looks awesome next to me.! Not bad for a hole in the wall..!,c-hfLhNWxgMlww002apw5g,0,0,5,WfVXEGEEnOxreYH7qy_MTA
