Everything was super bland and weird tasting. And we watched them drop silverware on the floor and proceed to give it to a table without switching it with a clean one. Try somewhere else.

I thought to myself, they're in a nice hotel and we always pass this restaurant when we're in Palazzo. It's always packed, but now I ask myself, why do people frequent this restaurant?! 

I only rated this place 2 stars for the location and ambience. 

Service 1/5: I mean how sad is it that waiters don't even ask you if you need a refill for your beverage?! One of the guests in our party went around our party and refilled our water. We had to call for them when others needed soda refills. To me, that's just bad service already. 

Food 1/5: The Bruschette Miste, is really nothing special. You can get better bread at CPK. Seriously. 

Pane Veneto 1/5: I'm not sure what was with that particular appetizer, but seems like something you could seriously whip up at home. No joke. 

Cannelloni Di Pollo 1/5: I looked at the description of the foods before ordering this and I thought to myself, how can you go wrong with this?! It sounds safe, this is what I'm picking. I was better off eating some frozen pasta out of a box. To me, it lacked a lot of flavor and it just wasn't special. Presentation as well, I think I was expecting more. Especially when the location of this restaurant is always so busy when we pass by. I no longer have to wonder what the food tastes like. 

I believe in first impressions and just from this visit alone, I won't be returning. Save your money and go elsewhere.",KXJfqISSxyYgpOdD3Ecq2Q,1,0,2,NIYI3yeu9ky8MmsaRjv8XA

1020361,2016-06-28,0,36ckWelVitpgX16g7lecqA,"If there was a closer experience to a beautiful dinner in Venice, I would need my passport.  Between the seemingly real sky overhead with a permanent perfect light and clouds (you will notice as you walk, in your peripheral it appears the clouds move) to the ambiance of sitting on the patio and people watching while sipping liquid amazement in the form of a smooth chianti, you could almost think you were really far far away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  

The waiters are ninja like in bringing and taking away plates without being obtrusive. It's very easy to close out the people walking by if you want and just enjoy the chef's work.  I had a beautiful chicken dish, spicy and delicious with salted steamed spinach, not usually a fan but it was a perfect palate cleanser.  My.husband had a pasta dish and we both enjoyed desserts as well.  Their gelato is nearly the best I've ever had. Yummy. 

We never felt rushed or crowded, our waiter vanished into air when not needed and left us to enjoy our evening. Only wish we had ordered another bottle of wine and stayed awhile.

Only conplaint and it's no fault of the restaurant, it's Vegas and while you eat and people watch, you become a tourist attraction too. Easily avoided by sitting inside amidst the dark wood and low lighting . Romantic no?",6OZ2N6T7XSQ9oRnImMNz7A,1,1,5,WSX_jtcaFaXLtQRQxlzc0Q

We order spicy Bloody Marys and the calamaretti fritti (calamari) to start.

The ambiance is great, has an outdoor theme and is surrounded by entertainment, other restaurants and shoppes. For lunch, my friends ordered gnocchi pomodoro (marinara sauce and fresh basil) and petto di pollo el peperoncino (chicken marinated with sage, rosemary, red peppers, etc) served with organic spinach. They both raved about their dishes . . . 

Drum roll please . . . I ordered the zuppa di pesce alla chioggiotta (seafood stew with shrimp, prawn, scallops clams, mussels, fish with grilled garlic ciabatta). Omg . . .

There's inside and outside seating underneath the faux sky ceiling. It's always a good day. The service was great our waiter was Gustavo and he was friendly and professional. Asking about our day and being personable about himself. Now here's the big question... ""How was the food"" I'm doing this with my fingers about 6"" away from my mouth shaking like an Italian when they're explaining something good. The food was GREAT! We started with bread and appetizers. We had a seafood dish, and an Alfredo dish that was special, we had the bread pudding dessert and the pistachio gelato. These all had Italian names and unfortunately I'm not fluent enough to repeat them but I've added pictures. This is a great place to go if you just want to have lunch or if you want to have a romantic dinner all the way up to a large  banquet or private party.

American-Italian food is not my favorite, but realize that this is authentic Italian and not at all the same as you're used to in the U.S. The prices are very reasonable considering it's location in the Grand Canal Shoppes of the Venetian.

I ordered a calzone because at $20 it was one of the least expensive items on the menu. It was the size of my head, but I didn't taste any of the ham that was supposed to be in it. The mozzarella and ricotta were delicious. It took between 75-90 minutes from being seated to order, eat, and tab out, which I learned was pretty standard for Vegas.

Loved the preparation - real spicy with al dente penne pasta. Had a nice 2012 Napa Valley Merlot to accompany, which turned out to be a bit bolder for the spicy pasta. In retrospect, Riesling or Chardonnay would have been better. 
After the spicy pasta, had to make room for dessert.  Shared Tortino Al Limone Verde (lime custard on a cookie crust topped with mascarpone). Small serving but delicious (tip: too small and yummy for two to share - get your own!).

My friend had the Sant' Erasmo Ridotto with shrimp, crab and baby artichoke and very good if you like no red sauce.
Very tasty Insalata  di Pere- arugula, radicchio, frisee, Belgian endive, grilled pears, grapes, toasted pecans, pomegranate dressing, blue cheese on the side.
Of course had to have a Super Tuscan wine 2011.",xfSiMtuhrlZNszvU2q_bCQ,2,1,4,0qT1uQNf3oS8lTOsdn94YQ

But when you get to try some that will make it worth reviewing in Yelp, Canaletto Ristorante Veneto is one of those that I can't have enough. Been here twice and still with the same warm professional service and tasty quality Italian food. Give it a try when you find yourself, deciding which one when you are in Vegas.

4766198,2016-02-10,1,36ckWelVitpgX16g7lecqA,"The service was nice and the space is great, but there are so many other better restaurants in the area. I feel like this is a bit of a tourist trap because it's so large and centralized. I've been to a few of the smaller restaurants in the canal shoppes and I loved them more.

The food was fine, service was good, they were accommodating to an extend with our requests. However, the price is a bit high on some of these items.

I was a little disappointed that the trio pasta plate (which 2 out of 3 of the items are vegetarian) couldn't be made completely vegetarian by replace the bolegnese sauce with a marinara. How easy would that be?!

I will say it's definietly a great place to peopel watch if you can get a seat 'outside' but I think I will stick with the other, smaller places instead.",ryf4jg4g3xweyIjkGOY3vg,2,1,3,W8aYOEF12lypw6YtbW3lbg
4860736,2016-02-15,1,36ckWelVitpgX16g7lecqA,"Skip this place. Overrated. Came here in February 2016 with 6 friends. We dined ""outside"" to enjoy the view of San Marco Square very near hostess area. Yet Service was HORRIBLE. We were seated before several tables yet the other tables were served first for some reason. We felt exhausted of having to ask for everything!! Yes EVERYTHING even for the basics! Asked for more water 4x. Had to ask for more sparkling bottled water. Asked for more bread 2x. Had to ask for more butter. Even Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper. Exhausting!! Everyone meal was delayed over one plate, which took so long I felt another waiter took the order or the waiter goofed it up. We had to ask for Parmesan cheese but apparently the wait staff felt it was only available to the person who asked for it. It was not automatically asked for the table. We had to even call them back again because the wait staff forgot two people! There was also the very loud jaw dropping dish cart. They wheeled this cart quickly by our table several times to clear dishes and it went ""BANG Bang BANG"" very very loud on the cobblestone to disrupt our dinner. The food was just OK. After this exhausting dinner, we all left disappointed, frustrated and felt very ripped off. We were sitting right in front of the wait staff and never felt like we were waited on.

But this may just be my experience as there are more attentive servers helping other tables and bar. First sat at bar since it's just me, but was overlooked several times until  someone helped me. Then received minimal help in drinks and food. Seems like the regular menu was only available in restaurant so I finished my drink n then went into restaurant. My server was a sweet old man probably around 80 and spoke mostly Italian. No offer of regular drink or wine. No offer of cheese on my minestrone soup. Probably won't come back for mediocre food and service.",8bJTf8prsuFv-USYpsTnNQ,0,1,3,LNpm8sR5Nj5eNymKd9C1sw
5229693,2016-07-02,0,36ckWelVitpgX16g7lecqA,"This restaurant is located in the central plaza of the Venetian, with ""outdoor"" and indoor seating, with nice views of the plaza and canal, and you get a ""free"" performance that happen frequently at the plaza.

Me and daughter decided that the menu looked interesting, and since the place was not full we got seated immediately. They put us in a small table for two on the right side, arguably one of the worst locations, although there were three empty tables facing the plaza. At first I didn't mind, but couples that arrived minutes after us got the plaza seats. Why do restaurants do that? Get in first (early) and be rewarded the worst tables in the house?

I ordered the Insalata Canaletto with grilled chicken ($18) and my daughter the Tagliatelli ($22). Both were good, but to spend that amount of money for two simple lunch dishes is a bit over the top, unless those dishes had some out-of-this-world tastes, condiments, spices, etc.

Service was good, but again, for the amount of money the service should have been royal. And we should have gotten some respect from the hostess, giving us a better table, since plenty were available.

I travel to Vegas 5 or 6 times a year, and have dinned at dozens of restaurants, from ultra upscale to the simplest downtown, thus I believe Canaletto can do a better job with food and service (and prices).

Anyway, the location is great, thus it is recommended.

The set lunch menu is great, offers an appetizer(soup or salad), a few entree choices (I chose a grilled Chicken) and a choice of Tiramisu or gelato as dessert. Servers were very caring and gentle. Definitely coming back next time!",Z4sKdn2Xeqqgo_KYsWOPpQ,0,0,5,aNjWdN8me2dZ9EOEx3042w

Dishes in the mid $20s, and yes it's a little pricey, but I'm tired of searching for great Italian food.  They claim to have fresh pasta here and their taglilatelle did not disappoint.  Cooked al dente, this pasta meal was satisfying and full of flavor.  I was not happy with their house salad, because it was overly douched in dressing.  It was sad, because the greens were pretty good.  

We came here to celebrate a birthday and ended on a nice note with some awesome tiramisu.  The dessert was so smooth and the alcohol was present and pleasantly made the dish stand out.  I'm usually not a fan of tiramisu, but this one was worth the calories.

Check out their website for their happy hours at the bar.  If you want the ambiance along with food, without paying full price, it's worth it to check out.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,4,2,4,NK5wDbm34RB_csQMpJAR4g
