Though it's nice to have a Korean place so close by, Jun's House food isn't what real Korean food should taste like.  First, shitake mushrooms should be reserved for just a few dishes since they're so pungent.  However, Jun's seems to place it in many dishes (including the yuk-hae-jang, or beef and veggie soup) which is a big big BIG mistake.  Instead of a spicy, savory soup, all you taste is shitake mushrooms.  The banchan (side dishes) are subpar as well, esp. the kimchi (bland and sad).  And don't get me started on the kimchi soup.  Using ""raw"" kimchi in kimchi soup is unheard of...I had no idea why it was so strangely sweet until I called my mother to ask.  And lettuce in the bibimbap?  Just weird.  But the BBQ is decent so if that's what you're looking for, Jun's shouldn't disappoint.  Jun's food made me grumpy and now I'm grumpier because I'm posting my first negative review.  Thanks a lot, Jun's house.",X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,2,0,3,-iE8cOG4lok0sUY5Z3hEgg
109600,2009-04-01,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"This is a fine mom and pop Korean restaurant.  The food is average with some dishes better than others.  I really enjoy the dduk mandoo gook, which is a dumpling and rice-cake soup...it tastes similar to mom's but obviously no one does it better than she does :)  The bibimbap is pretty good as well and they give you plenty of red chile ""sauce"" to mix into it.  I'm not a big fan of their bbq items which I've found to be rather fatty/greasy.

The prices are significantly higher than I'm used to pay for Korean food, but I understand how difficult it must be to get all the necessary ingredients out here in the desert so I don't complain about it too much.

Overall, it's a nice place to visit when you're craving Korean food, but it's nothing overly special.  (I do agree, however, that the owners/servers are all very friendly and are happy to help non-Koreans navigate the menu).",yB7V5yP1tmz2Q3AWlUdyeA,0,0,3,mffic12GL3BC8yxgdNhZ1A

125335,2014-01-03,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"Husbie and I went to visit our family in Las Vegas over the winter holiday, and being that we've been craving Hawaii-style Korean take-out for a while now, I took to Yelp to find something.  Luckily, I was able to find this Jun's place!!!

FOOD - We ordered meat jun, soon doo boo ji gae (soft tofu soup), kalbi, fried man doo, and jap chae (long rice).  Kind of a lot of food for 3 people, but we're porkers!  Meat jun was spot-on, and came with the soy/vinegar sauce.  I did miss the spicy/sweet meat jun sauce like from Yummy's in Hawaii, but you can't get that everywhere!  Kalbi was well-marinated and cooked - enough char to give you that burned carmelization taste that's so good about kalbi, but not overcooked.  The surprise was the soup!  It was REALLY GOOD!!!  The broth was appropriately seasoned and had depth.  Fried mandoo was whatever, probably frozen, but still good.  Side dishes were good, but nothing memorable.  Jap chae was okay, but a bit greasy.  This is not authentic, traditional, from-mother-country Korean food.  It's a niche all of its own, and it's essentially a knock-off of Yummy's, Tasty's, etc those kinds of Korean take-out places in Hawaii!  If you haven't had the pleasure of eating this kind of food in HAWAII, you might miss the virtue of it when in Las Vegas.  It's kind of way to scratch the itch for us mainland transplanted Hawaii kids, but I can understand it probably doesn't do it for those of you who have never tried it before.  It's a decent substitute for the food back home :)

AMBIANCE - very hole-in-the-wall diner feel.  Nothing special.  But clean and bright.

SERVICE - we dined in and the service was pretty good for a Korean restaurant (I'm Korean, I can say this!).  The server/owner was attentive enough, and brought us all the things we asked for: extra napkins, beverages, containers, sauces, extra sides, etc.

VALUE - I haven't actually eaten Hawaii style Korean food in a long time, but the prices here were definitely cheaper than what I remember Yummy's being when I left Honolulu in 2006.

Very much liked the value and the moderate spicyness of the seafood soup.  Sides were solid (I tried the radish and the spicy cucumber).  Probably best to call ahead or eat in the restaurant.  I spent 10.70 for my soup which came with two sides and a mound of sticky rice - a ton of food.  Check it out - Eastern just north of the 215, tons of parking.

165162,2015-08-06,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"Jun's Special - all of the meat was really tasty as well as the sides but I personally don't think it is worth the $14-$15

Bibimbap  - ordered the bibimbap without the hot plate, not sure what the difference is but it was $2 more. As for the dish itself, there was no flavor and it just felt greasy. With Bibimbap being a main dish, I expect it to be good, or at least have some flavor. Personally I like the vegetables pickled and they weren't, the plus is that the veggies were fresh. 

All in all, the meat was good but not as tasty as a whole

I think the total came to around $25 which isn't bad. This satisfied my KBBQ craving but definitely not worth it IMO. Don't see myself going here again",1HeGzuKCjUirsjN1O-O4tw,1,0,2,ox3p_Z8_fYI8xMkINKsApg

The banchans we received were shoyu potato, cucumber and cabbage kimchee, and bean sprouts. The wonbok kimchee was very delicious and fresh.

I've eaten their meat jun and bbq chicken in the past when they had a booth at an event. Ah, those are mediocre. Nothing spectacular.

There is an older lady (I think it's the owner) who is always so angry and mean and rude.  She gives you the meanest look and if you ask for a refill on banchan you will see what I mean.  She is definitely in the wrong business.  My friend ABSOLUTELY REFUSES to eat there because of her.  He liked the food but because of how he was treated he will never eat there again.  He says, ""I don't want to give them any business.""  So adamant and til this day has never returned.  They need to rename this place to The Angry Korean Lady. 

So on to the food.... It's decent.  I like the Meat Chun, it's soft.  The banchan is good.  Recommend the sweet potato.  Their portions are far too little for what they charge.  Very stingy.

My spicy seafood tofu soup was tasteless. It was no where near spicy. The seafood in it was bland and chewy. There were like 4 pieces of seafood in it. We wanted mochi but we waited so long for the check that we didn't even order dessert. I went to a fast food restaurant to order something sweet.

Service depends on how busy it is. If you're one of the few ones there, it's easy to flag the waitress down. But during busy times, it can be more difficult as there is usually only one waitress and she becomes busy trying to serve the whole room.

Since then I have seen them, large cheap lots that need some cheering up, possibly lack of customers or really they're much bigger than they need to be (hey you gotta have goals), I've seen many restaurants pop up in various places in southern California like these that sadly come and go.

But this one is nice and bright, a small take-out type place with a few tables if you want waiter service. For Las Vegas tourists who know nothing of Korean food and locals who know nothing of Korean food as well, the menu is simple yet retains authentic flavor and uses of ingredients. 

For Las Vegas it was surprisingly good, and it is doing well for being in a relatively newly developed area.

My husband and I are from the South Bay in SF Bay Area where there is a large Korean population, and he was stationed in Korea for a year or so, so we've had great Korean food.

We moved here a month ago and haven't had Korean since, so we thought we'd try this place based on the Yelp reviews.  I almost wish we hadn't.

I had ""Jun's Special"" which included Bulgogi, Kal-bi, Chicken, and Meat Jun (?), along with the 4 included sides; seasoned bean sprouts (which normally I love!), some sort of potato, rice, and kimchi.

The bulgogi was ok, nothing spectacular, but the chicken and meat jun weren't good.  The bean sprouts weren't very fresh either.

Anyway, Jun's Korean Restaurant came up and we were immediately on our way. This place has Meat Jun! (I don't know why, but they called it Meat Chun... In Hawaii we all say Meat Jun lol) 

They have their own private parking lot shared with the surrounding restaurants and shops. It is also located next to the Regal Cinemas. I came for the Meat Jun but ended up getting Bi Bim Bap (about $11 including tax), which was also very delicious! 

Bi Bim Bap is a signature Korean dish with veggies, eggs, sauce, and beef on top of rice. And you mix it all together. In this restaurant you could have it either on a plate or in the stone bowl. Of course I got it in the stone bowl because why not?! The taste was a 4/5, I've had better in Hawaii but it was still a successful lunch choice (Best Bi Bim Bap I've had in Vegas thus far)! The distance is quite far from where I live, so I would come here only if I was in the area craving Meat Jun or some good Bi Bim Bap. The proportions were good for it's price, my friend and I both couldn't finish our plates.

The customer service was okay, but not too much communication took place. However, may I say that the interior gives off a mellow/relaxed feeling. The pictures on the wall were big and pretty, just like their menu behind the front counter. It was easy to read. There were about 10 or more size-varying tables/chairs in the dining area and no outdoor seating.

It seems as though the more time goes on, the less quality the food is. Maybe I am just too picky of a Korean, but I don't really want to spend my money somewhere that still leaves me craving a satisfying Korean meal. 

I can't really put my finger on a specific thing, but... it just seems.... cheap. Especially since it's not as cheap in the wallet as it is in quality. 

There are just better places to go for better quality for the same/similar price - and honestly, I'm OK with paying a little bit more if the quality is much of a difference. 

I highly doubt we'll be patrons in the future, which is unfortunate as I did have some good expectations for them in the past.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,2,0,2,Q8l8v11Dk2AtZ-4sDrqHWg

Thankfully Island Flavor Express was closed the day meet up with friends for early dinner. Now I KNOW. Love all things Korean food especially my meat jun besides other favorites like kalbi. The meat jun here is just as solid as my normal spot at Island Style. Really no way can go wrong with either spot when comes to not only authentic Korean food but local 808 style. The banchan will always vary from each restaurant. At Jun's you get nice selection of banchan. 

I went with the combo meal. I was torn between my two favorite kalbi and meat jun. Figure why not get both? It was awesome. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and brought back found memories of family dinner going out for korean food. The house salad with the dressing something that needs a shout out. It was really really good. Never been much of salad person but that one could have whole bowl. 

The service was five stars. They were on top of everything from drinks, food, and one of my friends forgot leftovers going take home. One of the workers came right out told us forgot something and made sure got it. I think that deserve extra star for service. 

The only thing that not really negative cause between the food and service nothing but five stars. The location it tucked in the back of the shopping mall not directly off eastern. So if not see it just make sure turn into the shopping center keep driving in the back by the movie theaters and ur going to find little hidden gem for ono local 808 korean action.

The food is the most important. I got the bibimbop which was amazing. So incredibly flavorful. It was rice and beef with sesame oil and veggies, with a Sunnyside egg on top. My friends got the kimchi friend rice, which was also phenomenal, and the meat chun. The sauce that comes with this is kind of like a Korean version of ponzu, if you're familiar with that. Another one of my friends said the meat was kind of rubbery, but I didn't experience that on ours.

The sides were also tasty. Kimchi, red pepper paste cucumbers, seaweed salad, seasoned soybeans, and fish cakes were quite good.

The second time was just the other day. I was happy to finally try this place. I have read rave reviews and I was excited to get my grub on.

The banchans were good, but they were out of so many of the favorites like the pancake and the sweet potato. My soup was good, I would order it again.

They'll also serve a variety of sides from kimchee cabbage, kimchee cucumber, some kind of potatoes, sprouts, etc.  Whenever I'm here with a large group it seem's like the sides are unlimited because they also refill the bowls, don't know how it is dining solo or with 2 or 3 people.

I ordered the Jun's special (rice, salad & sampler of their various meats). It was good and lots of serving that I was able to share it with my preschooler.
The husband had the macarel with rice. It was also good.
My older child had the teriyaki chicken bowl and i got a feedback that it was also good. Proof was the empty bowl at the end of the meal :)

3 meals plus 1 fountain drink our total bill was only about $40, tax and tip included. That's pretty good!

My mom and I walked into the restaurant and we immediately turned to each other in awe of how clean the establishment is. I'm talking ridiculously clean! I appreciate restaurants with cleanliness like Jun's. Everyone needs to get on their level!

There are plenty of dishes to choose from, but I couldn't stray away from my craving. We both ended up ordering the Yukgaejang or in layman's terms, spicy beef and vegetable soup. Each bowl of soup included two banchan. Banchan is one of my favorite things about Korean food! We went with the cucumbers, daikon, kimchi, and tofu. All of which were very flavorful and fresh! The banchan dishes were not small like other Korean joints I have been to, but a good portion.

The Yukgaejang arrived to our table in a big bowl, piping hot, just how I like it! The broth had the right amount of spiciness to it and the chunks of beef brisket were tender. Vegetables in the soup included bean sprouts, black mushrooms, carrots, green onions, and onions. The vegetables were simmered to the point where they were just soft enough, but not mushy. Overall, a very filling and satisfying meal. Especially when served with a small bowl of rice!

Service at Jun's is fast and friendly. I'm not complaining. My Korean food craving was satisfied and I can't wait to come back and try other dishes. The BBQ and Bibimbap looks amazing!",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,5,6,4,ewkluoPD5MZDnrCAUQqNEw

It's a pretty small place located in the same shopping center as Lemongrass Café and the Colonade movie theater on Eastern Road.

When we walked in the lady behind the counter asked if we wanted to order dine in or to go. We decided to eat there and check the place out. It is modest, but clean. I ordered the #17 Chicken (7.95) while my friend got the #22 Meat Combo ($9.95). We were only waiting 5-10 minutes max, when she brought our food out to us! Nice!

Omg. That chicken was so scrumptious! So, so ridiculously juicy and full of flavor! The white rice and salad with vinegar oild were nice compliments, but that chicken was so frickin tasty! There was a good portion amount too! (Check out the pics)

My friends Meat combo included bulgogi with kalbi. Wow! I already know what  I'll be trying next!

The service was attentive without being intrusive. Our drinks never reached the bottom before being offered a refill.

All this came to barely $21! (Not including tip). I cannot wait to come back very soon and for multiple visits to try more menu items and definitely get some more of that chicken!

I've been coming to Jun's for many many years, but this is my first review of it.  I enjoy the bonchons that this place offers.  I think E-Jo has the best Kim Chee, so if you want that, go there.  Hobak is the best for BBQ, but if you want fast, casual Korean food, this is an excellent place.  I generally just order the chicken, but have also ordered the Kalbi from time to time (disclosure - not the best, but it is good.  E-Jo's is better.).

I've been here about 5 times now, and it's always the same two people I see working it, so I guess they're the owners.  Two main things to get here are the Meat Jun and the Korean Pancake.  They're just to die for!

The Meat Jun is thinly sliced beef covered with egg that was marinated in some sauce that was very flavorful.  I really like it, get it every time.  The other thing is the Korean pancake, which is this thick, savory, egg-like combination of several different kinds of seafood.  It's wonderful, and is definitely good for two people, which is good because it costs $9.95!  

Their banchan is also pretty good, if not amazingly spectacular.  Their kimchee is good, as it should be for a Korean cornerstone, but the spicy tofu is great, and by far the best of the bunch(an) is the fish cakes!  They're thin slices of fried fish cake with sliced peppers and jalapenos.  I never leave without buying a box of them to go.  If they don't give you the fish cakes automatically, just ask, they'll be more than happy to give you a few.

They have sushi here, too, but I can't really say much good about it, except the Korean roll.  The others are basic rolls that you can actually find better elsewhere.

My Mom is Korean and is VERY picky about her soup. Ok, who am I kidding, she is very picky about everything, but especially picky about her soup. She requires a specific ""Juice"" (meaning broth) to ""Goodies"" (meaning meat and veggie) ratio. It also needs to be scalding hot in temperature with the right amount of spicy heat. If the criteria is not met, she sticks out her hand and gives a big thumbs down. Right in the restaurant, in front of everyone. Businesses need to be glad that she is not a Yelper. 
I will let you know that Jun's kimchee soup has gotten a thumbs up. AND a smile. She proclaimed it one of the best that she has had in a long time. I have taken her for this soup 4 times in the past 3 weeks, and she might want to go for it again before the week is over.
I always get the soybean soup and it is always delicious, hot and spicy. My husband enjoyed his bulgogi the other day and the banchan selections are fresh and tasty. I prefer my kimchee to be a little extra old, but it comes out fresh and crunchy at this restaurant. Oh well, something I am fine with.

There is complimentary hot barley tea which pairs nicely with the hot and spicy foods.

Welcomed by friendly staff all rushing about preparing and serving fragrant dishes of food.

Still, servers try to encourage you to try their favorites in broken English.  The food arrives and thanks to ""monkey see, monkey do"", you know how to serve and share each dish.  The owner / cook comes by and even if you don't understand Korean, you know she is asking how the food is.  An enthusiastic ""delicious"", brings a huge smile, numerous bows, and she's back off.

A great dining experience offering a different taste of Korean food.  This is healthy Korean comfort food.  veggies abound.  The only protein centric dish, meat jun.  Hot and cold noodles, Korean dried ramen, and jook dominate the menu.

Tip:  Portions are very large.  Share everything.  They are quick to provide soup ladles, bowls, and plates.

The mandoo deserves all the raves.  Chicken based, not over stuffed.  Excellent as ""dumplings"" in soups.  Even better pan fried as a side dish.  A little oily but the oil adds and textural contrast hard to beat.

I think they know how to make someone super full, I'm always stuffed after eating half the food I ordered! 

I have tried the spicy chicken and spicy pork with white rice (you can also get brown rice as an alternative). With every dish, you also get to choose 4 korean side dishes, which range from kim chi, tofu, bean sprouts, spicy cucumbers, etc. I love the spicy chicken, and the spicy pork definitely makes me drink lots of water! 

This is a great take out place for lunch or dinner, and the wait time is about 10 minutes or less depending on how busy they are - but if you are on a time schedule, just call ahead for your order!",XQlK4Cnr-matKoM2rROocw,3,0,4,9XyDhR6SGCVt19gy0W5YjQ

Living in Henderson there really aren't too many great Korean choices but I'm glad to have stumbled into Jun's one day after a movie two years ago and I have been coming here ever since.  

They offer all the classic Korean bbq choices such as marinated chicken, spicy pork and marinated sliced beef known as bulgogi.  Always go for the three item meat combo and try all of the different meats to find your favorites, none of them are bad so its just a matter of your preferences.  For those wanting more authentic Korean food they offer a wide range of soups and rice dishes.  My favorite is the stone pot bim bim bap.  Its basically rice served in a heated stone pot that sizzles the rice and its topped with bulgogi and various vegetables making this a healthy and delicious dish.

All meals come with a variety of side dishes such as kimchi and sprouts and they are very fresh and have a good flavor.  I recommend Jun's to everyone because you can find something for even the pickiest eater.  I have a friend that hates Asian food but loves Jun's because of the bbq meats and another friend loves to get a California roll and pot stickers so bring everyone down and judge for yourself and I bet you won't be disappointed!",jpZ50BRORVOrTUHKAaZ7Hg,3,1,5,hq4yO5w614bMDLkBU5AKOA

Now for the food.  This was probably the one of the worst Korean foods I've eaten in Las Vegas.  I didn't try the Hawaiian food or the Sushi so I can't comment on that.  I very rarely give out a really bad rating.  However, the food didn't taste authentic at all.  The banchan didn't taste right, all of them.  Kimchi is different since people have a different preference on how sour or fresh they like it.  However, the other side dishes just did not satisfy me.   The Soon Tofu was bland with a lot of spices.  The Mandoo Guk (Dumpling soup) didn't have any seasoning.   I'm pretty lenient on Korean food in Las Vegas, but this isn't one I could be lenient on.

The fried mandoo had a lot of stuffing inside. You can also order pre-cooked frozen mandoo, so you can enjoy it at home. 30 piece for $20. Speaking of mandoo, their mandoo soup had a lot of nonfried mandoo and noodles. Their broth was flavorful and it also had pieces of egg.  The beef and vegetable soup was yummy, but it was majority vegetables. The 3 meats we got was chicken Katsu, meat jun and bulgogi. The plate was huge and the meat was all flavorful.

The hot stone pot gives the very bottom layer of rice a crispy texture. The size of the bowl is bigger than some of the other Korean restaurants I've been to and cheaper as well.

The inside of the restaurant isn't that big and since it looked more like a bistro type of place with a big menu on the wall above the register, we walked up to the register to place our orders. When it was our time, finally, she told us if we wanted to dine in, we can go and sit down, so we did. The problem was though, that they only had one person for everything: answering the phone, taking the to-go orders and serving. So it took another 10 minutes until she came up to us, because she took a ton of other to-go orders, until she finally came to take ours. I think it would be easier if they would let you order your food at the register, pay for it, and then go sit down, or at least have a separate server.  

Anyway, we ordered the Hawaiian style tuna poke and the combination plate with 3 choices of meat. We got the spicy chicken, chicken katsu, and the bulgogi. They all came with a good portion of rice and some small portions of assorted vegetables and salads. 

The ahi tuna was very fresh, but the portion was almost bite size for $7. The 3 choices of meats we had, were all very fresh and good spiced. I really enjoyed all of them.

I ordered Jun's Special which came with rice, a salad, bulgogi, kalbi, BBQ chicken, meat chun, mandoo and three small sides. This is the ultimate way to try just about everything. 

Going into this lunch I was familiar with most everything I ordered though I had only ever tried bulgogi as far as the meats go. I was pleased with everything starting with the salad. I know its just a salad but it was good. Lettuce, cabbage, shredded carrot and maybe a rice vinegar dressing. Its simple but quite refreshing. Next I tried each of my sides (bean sprouts, cabbage kimche and cucumber kimche). The bean sprouts were pretty plain but, like the salad, refreshing. The kimches were not as potent as what I have had before. They were mildly spicy and had that little hint of briny fermentation. Very nice.

When I made my way to the meats I was over the moon. The chicken was simple bit perfectly cooked. I love the char. And it was so tender I could just about cut it with my chop sticks. The mandoo (fried dumpling with pork) was next. It was super crispy and had a flavor I am not familiar with. Not to worry though. I loved all two bites of it. Had I known it would be so good I would have ordered a side of them. Dumplings rock around the world. The kalbi had great flavor but beong from the short rib is more fatty than I like my meat to be. That did not stop me from eating it. Again, I love the char. The bulgogi was as good as I've ever had. Tender. Sweet. Amazing meaty goodness. I would order that again in a heart beat. The one I was most skeptical about was the meat chun. It is a thin piece of beef dipped in egg and fried. I had never heard of such a dish. And I am not always a fan of eggs. But with an open mind and an empty stomach, I tried it and, much to my surprise, I kind of liked it. It wasn't my favorite part of lunch but it was alright. 

Jun's has got it going on. Friendly service. Fast arrival of food. Good flavors. Decent prices. I may just have to come back some time and try some more Korean food. I'd get more of those mandoo dumplings for sure. And maybe try the stone bowl bibimbop. I may even entertain the idea of a bowl of soup.

A little about me...I am half Korean, and my mom is an amazing Korean cook. I have sort of sworn off Korean restaurants because most of the time I am so disappointed. Usually I will just wait until my next opportunity to have lunch or dinner at my moms. 
I was happy eating here though. I ordered the juns special so I could get an idea on what they are all about. 
The food is decent. It is better than I expected, the meat was good. The bulgogi was not really made the way that it is supposed to be made. It had the sort of steamed result that occurs when you put too much meat in a frying pan that isn't hot enough and think you will get a sear on it. It's not going to happen. The flavor was good though. Kalbi was decent. Nice char marks. Good quality meat. The chicken was good the meat Jun was alright. The sides were fine.

We ordered the spicy seafood tofu soup and the nun special bbq. Also ordered the Thai ice tea. 

The tofu soup is thin and not much flavor. It was as if they tried to mask this watered down soup with Tabasco sauce. Needless to say, we ate a quarter of this and didn't finish it. 

Kim chi definitely needs work. The only ban chan that was decent was the potato. 

Here's my thoughts on the jun special: Bbq ribs was charred. The bulgogi meat quality is poor. Chicken was dry. It honestly tasted like food court food. 

Thai ice tea taste like all sugar. No taste of tea at all.

4347280,2018-06-07,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"Owned by Hawaii peeps, this is as close as I can get to ""local"" Korean BBQ that is similar to Hawaii cuisine.  Our ""go to"" dish is the Kim Chee soup paired with BBQ chicken plate.  Sometimes if we're not feeling spicy, we opt out of the Kim Chee soup and order the Kalbi soup.  It has a very flavorful soup base with chunks of kalbi meat also known as beef short ribs.  

They also serve meat jun here.  A Hawaii favorite when dining at a Korean BBQ spot.  I have come to realize that this is a Hawaii specialty as most Korean establishments do not even know what this is.  Basically it is meat dipped in egg batter then fried.  

When you order a plate, it comes with two choices of side dishes and white rice.  There is an assortment of sides to choose from.  If you are not familiar with these side dishes, I would play it safe and stick to something like tofu and corn.  But if you're feeling adventurous, the pickled veggies are always great choices.  I typically will get the Kim Chee cucumber and seaweed.

Bottom line:  This is more of a fast food restaurant.  You can dine in or take out.  They also offer Hawaiian canned juices.  Parking is in front and free.",FT6XkKGVkyIcLcsYGHED6g,0,0,5,R9ZR8GX_Nii95PxFeu6TCQ

I don't know why I've never experienced Korean food and I'm not saying one visit to this fast food Korean joint qualifies me as any kind of authority on it, but I do know what tastes good and what I like.
I liked the Bulgogi at Juns. Despite a gentle snub from an actual Korean about Jun's being ""fast food"", we decided to give it a try anyways. I attribute that to Mel C's review (thanks, Mel!)
The Bulgogi plate was generous with rice, a fresh salad with a light asian love-you-long-time type of dressing, and thinly sliced, tender, flavorful, marinated beef stir fried with onions. I ate all the meat and enjoyed it. My only wish was that it could have had more of a carmelized sear to it. That would have made it perfect.
The other dish ordered was the Bi Bim Bop...fun to say, but another dish that was new to us. Rice topped with veges, like shredded napa cabbage tossed in sesame oil, stir fried meat with mushrooms, and topped with a sunny side egg, the yolk begging to be broken. We enjoyed that as well.
I know this may seem like going to Panda Express for Chinese food, but when it's good, it's good. 
My new quest will now be to find the best Bulgogi. Thank you Jun's for opening my Asian eyes (lol) to Korean food, and thank you for the wonderful service. The whitey I was with...aka my wife, is a bit high maintenance and knew even less about Korean food than I did. Our very nice server took the time to explain everything to her.

I had the Yukaejang (spicy beef soup) and Japchae (clear glass noodle). The Yukaejang was disgusting. It was basically spicy luke warm water. I was so confused with the ingredients they used too. It's almost as if they ran out of what normally goes into Yukaejang so they had to improvise and put in any vegetable they could find. It had chopped carrots, shitake mushrooms, and mung bean sprouts (soybean sprouts, kkong-namul, is added in Yukaejang... Not the mung bean sprouts you add in Pho). Yukaejang should not have any of these ingredients. I think there were even chunks of boiled cabbage. Worst ""Yukaejang"" I've ever had.

Japchae was oily and tasteless. The banchan was a little salty but wasn't bad... I don't recall the service being bad either, so this review is solely based on the food taste and quality.

The flavor and food quality has been consistent no matter what time of day or week I visit. The egg battered beef, I believe is called meat jun mandoo, melts in your mouth. The meat jun mandoo meat is cut thin and I was worried it would be tough, but it's so tender and the egg batter adds a nice touch instead of being  floured and fried. I personally never seen anything like that before. I get the Jun's Special all the time now because you get 4 types of meat and your pick of 2 sides ( Banchan ), so you get to try a little bit of everything. The portion for this special more than enough for seconds and I had some left for lunch the next day even! I highly recommend the seaweed salad because it's light, a little sweet, a little sour, and it compliments the Bbq chicken, Kalbi rib, and the famous bulgogi. The family that runs the restaurant are so nice and sweet and very helpful in answering questions about the food. It's located in the Regal Movie Theater plaza so there is plenty of parking.

Today, I came to Jun's to pick up some grub on the way home.  Here's what I got today and what I usually get when I visit:

BBQ Chicken and Kalbi combo, with a drink for $12.65- The chicken is boneless thigh meat, my fav, prefectly marinated and grilled.  The Kalbi is also perfectly marinated.  I  got about three healthy pieces of chicken and one piece of Kalbi.  Although they have many sides to choose from, I usually get the shoyu potatoes which are super flavorful and has a pleasant sweetness to it, as well as the bean sprouts, primarily because it offers a wonderful texture which I enjoy.  Great for takeout or dine in.

Stone Pot Bi Bim Bop (Dol Sot-please don't kill me if I misspelled it) for $9.95- Now this dish can only be enjoyed through dine in because of the stone pot it comes in.  There's a ton of shredded veggies, beef, egg and rice.  When it comes to the table, I wait for five minutes as the sizzling pot crisps up the rice, then I got to town!  I start by mixing everything together, crack the yolk and let the egg cook more on the pot.  I finish the mixed bowl with sriracha and soy sauce.  I can't get enough of this and will keep coming back just because of this dish alone!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

The place is super small.  I find myself playing a guessing game whether or not we'll have a table open for us when we visit.  I think because of the location, it's super convenient for me and the wait time isn't very long.  

Being from Hawaii, I feel this place really attracts a lot Hawaiian transplants.  They sell Hawaiian Sun drinks and above all, there's a lot of the Aloha spirit.  Trust me when I say, it's definitely worth going back!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,4,1b-mGdOm6ydQuuUmZdzHMw

Listen too the past reviews peeps!!! I kind of dis. But wanted to try it. 

Kalbi is really thin 3 pieces for $13.95

Jun's special $13.95 a plate. 1 piece of each. Kalbi, chicken, meat Chun (jhun). And bulgogi aka Teri beef oh and 1 mandoo. 

Everything tasted good but really REALLY SMALL PORTIONS. I spent $40 and I still hungry.....

My suggestion, go to island style or tofu hut. You get more bang for your buck. And taste just as good if not better!!!!",XI0qGYn0COB3RgvZnMJU-w,2,1,3,LAScIYs5_mWWRBYQlm1qnQ

Since we moved a year ago we haven't really been to this side of town all that often and it's been ages since I last been to Jun's. I needed to reacquaint my taste buds of how good their food was and had me wondering why we don't come more often, because not only do you get a bang for your buck here, but they serve you quality food foremost. It's amazing that quality and prices have remained top notch despite their 10 years of success and continued growth. It's family owned hole in the wall places such as this I like supporting as they are the ones with the most heart.

They offer a lot of Korean specialties and Hawaiian fusion as well. I must admit, I'm not all too familiar with most of the Korean soups and find them intimidating hahaha probably due to the long and hard to pronounce names, but I do want to try them one of these days as they look good and appetizing. I'm up for suggestions on which I should try first, nothing too spicy, I'm a sissy when it comes to that ;)

Last night we got two 2 item combo plates ($11.95 each) First with Bulgogi and Spicy pork with fish cake and bean sprouts as sides. Hubby chose Meat chun and BBQ chicken with kimchi and fish cake. Everything tasted so good though the pork was too spicy for my taste. The Bulgogi was well marinated and mouth watering, chicken was perfect with a little char yet remained moist & juicy and the Meat chun was oh so tender and flavorful especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce. Portions are big enough that I still have some for my lunch today. I have been to several places that charge $3 more yet left me wanting and unsatisfied with the meal.

It's Korean ""fast food"" island style, I always get their meat jun and kalbi combo. My sides are kimchee and bean sprouts.

Ever since discovering the spicy, tofu delight of this Korean stew, I've lost interest in pho. Maybe it's the banchan. Sorry pho, but if you want to compete, you're gonna have to bring something else to the table (literally). 

So, when we pulled into the shopping center on Eastern and had a choice of Lemongrass Café or Jun's, there was no competition even though Lemongrass is the clear Yelp star winner. I am really surprised Jun's has only three stars. Perhaps I was just starving that day or perhaps I was overjoyed to find kimchi and sundubu in an unexpected spot, but I really enjoyed my meal. 

My hub and I both had vegetarian sundubu. Mine came out a bit more flavorful and spicier, so perhaps there is some inconsistency in their dishes. Even so, I ate my entire bowl and thought it definitely held its own. The banchan were uniformly delicious. The kimchi was addictively spicy; the seaweed had a wonderful sweetness, and the bean sprouts had a white pepper kick. They even had cucumber kimchi, which I adore. We got refills on every single one, and that rarely happens. You can get the sides to go, and I regret not purchasing some for my fridge. 

The shop is a simple, quick-service establishment, and the service is efficient, but not necessarily enthusiastic. They neither earn or lose stars in either of these categories.

Given that Jun's is not in my neighborhood, I probably wouldn't drive back just for a visit, but if I happen to be in the area, I will definitely be excited to feed my belly with some yummy Korean staples. Next time, I will definitely snag some banchan to carry home.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,9,4,eIBTZUaxQEaMVtY6D1huIQ

The lady at the cashier greeted us and asked us if it was for here or to go. We asked for it to go and she gave us time to sit down and look at the menu for a bit. My fiancè got a 3 meat combo plate with Meat Jun, BBQ Chicken, and Short Ribs. I ordered a 2 meat combo with Meat Jun and BBQ Chicken. After paying we had to pick our 2 sides, I got bean sprout and cucumber kimchee, and my fiancè got sweet potatoes and pancake. We ordered a side of Japche. 

Wait time was short, we waited 10-15 minutes and as we left the cashier thanked us for coming in. So customer service was awesome, loved how she was very patient with us and really nice. However, taste wise was not up to par as I expected. The meats were delicious! Their rice was wet and soggy, ruined the main dish. As for their sides, the sprouts and cucumber kimchee had no taste except the kimchee was spicy. That's it. The Japche was kind of the same, you could taste it but it lacked flavor. Korean food from my experience has always been savory and filled with amazing texture. Sadly, our dishes weren't like that. 

Our food was about $37 including tax:
$11.95 for the 2 meat combo plate
$12.95 for the 3 meat combo plate 
$8.95 for the Japche

In my opinion the price was okay - marching it portion wise but taste wise it was not. If their rice was not soggy and wet it wouldn't have ruined the main dish.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,2,2,3,rvAgBnV4pdY32rCFau__lw

3. Hot stone bibimbap 9.95

- For previous SoCal residents, this restaurant can be summed up as every Korean restaurant inside H-Mart. One prime example would be Dae Jang Gum H-Mart in Garden Grove. 
- Quick service. Fast food. A few dollars more that Dae Jan Gum but not in a food court. 
- The food that we ate was pretty average, just like food court quality in SoCal, but for Las Vegas, I think this is great especially for their location. 
- The seafood pancake needed to be a bit more crispy and ratio of seafood to green onion was way more to the side of green onion.
- The bulgogi did not come on a hot stone plate. It tasted similar to H-Mart bulgogi. 
- I was a bit surprised that they served it with salad and not sliced cabbage with dressing. The salad was better. 
- The rice needed to be burnt a bit more in the hot stone bowl. 
- Only 4 types of banchan was served to us. Kim Chi needs to be fermented a bit more. 
- Although sounding picky, it is what is expected in this quality kind of restaurant. OC residents probably also agree. I'd definitely come back bc of convenience and value, and it reminds me of H-Mart. but don't come out of your way here if you're from CA.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,5,4,nU5xNwQAOThLQDIScB7FAw

It was dry and could have been cooked with more water. The meat jun and kalbi were my favorite. The mandoo was very crisp and the filling was predominately meat. It was not just a bunch of veggies and noodles like other places. The spices inside was spot on. I might just order a plate of this the next time I go.

My husband and I ordered yukgaejang (spicy beef and veggie soup), bindaeduk (korean pancake) and of course their famous meat jun. It all came out to $30 and they give you really good banchan with everything. I read on a previous review that the portions were small. Maybe when you eat there it might be, idk, but ordering for take out the portions were definitely no where near small. We didn't even finish everything besides the meat jun (which my husband devoured). They give you a lot of rice with your orders. Also, I'm pretty sure they gave us about 3 large slices of the pancake but I can't be certain because we ate them so quickly and had about one slice left. The yukgaejang was perfectly spicy and still really hot by the time I got home. Their banchans (side dishes) were spot on as well.

I was craving Korean food but didn't want to haul my butt all the way to Las Vegas since I live in Henderson.  (Next time, I will!)  I recall eating at Jun's Korean Restaurant a year ago and the bulgogi and spicy squid were decent.  Since my mom wanted to eat some spicy squid too but didn't want to dine out, I decided to order ""Take Out"" -- which was a HUGE mistake!  So, I ordered bulgogi for my son, spicy squid for mom and spicy soft tofu soup with beef for moi.  

When I ordered over the phone, the lady never took my name.  I thought that was odd so I said, ""Don't you need my name?""  She said, ""That's ok. We have your phone number"" -- Caller ID, I suppose that's what she meant.  When I got there, there was only 1 customer in the store.   I went up to the counter and said I have a ""to go order.""  I literally repeated my whole order to her since she had a blank look on her face.  Suddenly, the light bulb went off and she reached out to two bags and gave me the total amount to pay...$30+.  Since the place was pretty dead and there were only one other togo bag, I made the mistake of NOT DOUBLE CHECKING my order, tipped her a couple of bucks and left.  

When I got to Mom's, you can only imagine how baffled I was to find ""Spicy pork saute with kimchee and tofu"".  Huh?!  Where's the squid?!  I was pissed 'cause I was so looking forward to that for Mom so I made a phone call to Jun's.  The same lady answered the phone and she basically argued with me that I ordered the kimchee pork and she knows nothing about the squid. Wow!  She didn't even apologize or try to make amends -- and I knew I was wasting my time so I just hung up.  Mom was disappointed but we gave the ""new"" dish a try since we were hungry.  If you like pork and kimchee, I guess you'll like the dish.  We just prefer our kimchee as a ""side"" dish -- not an entree, thank you very much.  

Sad to say, the soup was horrible!  It was bland... it tasted like kim chee water ... not kidding!  The tofu was the only thing that was edible.  The menu said ""soft tofu with beef and vegetable"" ... um,... ""Where's the Beef?!""  The better description would be: ""soft tofu with a strand of beef and kim chee and we just pour water over the kim chee and call it soup"".  To make the night worse, after my 3rd bite, I looked closer and WTF?!!  Am I seeing a strand of hair?!  (YEP!  It sure is!  GROSS!!!!!!)  I was no longer hungry and decided that I'll boycott this place!    

Needless to say, Mom and I were sadly disappointed by Jun's.  The One Star given is because my son ate the bulgogi.  I asked him if he enjoyed the dish and he said, ""There's no hair in mine.  It's definitely better than yours and grandma's!""  Haha!  He's a funny kid!

I guess there'll be NO ""next time"" here.  If I have a craving for Korean food in the future, I'll make the drive to Spring Mountain.  This experience totally ruined it for me!  Sorry Jun!",lwDRTzOx8_qnR8xt05_Law,2,0,1,tykGMTYNCFZi85jQ8NBD0g

Wish it was an AYCE joint but it'll do for me. Cute Resturant and the staff are really nice people... Good food but they've raised their prices through the years and much smaller portions now...

I wanted to try a taste of their daikon and the lady said no we don't give samples I had to buy a small serving to taste it that's like 3 bucks and it didn't even taste like i wanted it to i like daikon but not the sweet ones and this one was sweet.

5575670,2008-02-05,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"Jun's was a surprise to me. I had not known of any decent Korean places that would serve bbq for a good price. It was a breath of fresh air to know that there is one nearby my place (although, they are going to open one off of Eastern called Tiger Grill very soon near Richmar/Eastern). Jun's is more of a fast food Korean place. My friend and I knew that it should be good, since there were local Koreans (elder ones especially!) eating there. I ordered June's Special which included Kal-bi (BBQ Beef Rib), BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef (Bulgogi), Meat Jun (Battered Beef), and the Man doo (fried dumpling). Generous portions! It was a lot for $10.95. You can even request the meal with brown rice for no extra charge, and it even comes with a salad to balance all that meat! In addition to the meal, if you eat in, you can get a few sides like kimchi, spicy cucumbers, bean sprouts, and even that cold potato stuff. I have yet to try their Spicy Tofu soup, the Bi Bim Bob, and the Jap Che! They even make sushi there, but I don't know if I would recommend it...

If you're craving for fast Korean bbq, you have to try Jun's! You will not be disappointed! (Btw, June's special is the highest price thing on the menu (next to Jun's Special Roll)! You can get combo plates with 2 meats like BBQ beef or Kal-bi for $8.95 or 3 meats for $9.95).",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,4,1,4,EhxkT7FHe1a5UUbir1xtsQ

We simply typed ""rice"" on the search bar of yelp and this place popped up first. I was surprised this place came up because I didn't know they had more than one location (always went to the one on Craig).

We went during lunch time and it wasn't as busy. We were seated right away. The worker was quick with getting us waters. I'm a huge fan of Korean food and I just wanted to order everything! However, I ended up ordering the ""Jun's Special."" It consisted of BBQ chicken, Meat Chun, Kalbi and Bulgogi. It was delicious especially eating it with the sides like Kim Chee. My friend ordered the Bibimpab in the stone pot. That consisted of a hot stone bowl filled with rice, vegetables, egg, and bulgogi. It was alright. I've had better at other places.

The ambience of the place was very chill and relax. It's decorated with pics of their food lol.
Considering that Korean restaurants are mostly located in china town, it was nice to find a place in Henderson. Food was alright and service was quick. I'll definitely be coming back if I need a quick Korean food fix.",wdQpDnfhZaDuZVM4pvF2xg,1,1,4,9LC8nmj2g4Im8GkXyYlSag

5752729,2014-05-27,2,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"After the horrid experience at lunch and running around in 100 degree weather all day, we were ready for some good Korean food.  Looking on Yelp, this was the only place around where we were, and thankfully it had 4-stars so we decided to partake.  We pull up and... it's open, but the sign is half busted.  Upon walking in, we notice it is spartan, there is a buffet-style banchan station next to the counter, a couple of tables occupied, and we're thinking ""uh oh"".  A pseudo-cafeteria looking place with cheap furniture strewn around, it did not look impressive.  It's the only Korean around, so we thought we'd give it a try.  There must be a reason a place so devoid of charm has 4-stars, I thought.

We sit and the single lady running the show all by herself comes over and takes our drink order.  She's nice, initially speaks English, then upon noticing we speak Korean switches to the native tongue.  There are 2 cooks in the kitchen, so it's a 3-person operation.  This becomes key because during our meal the place gets full, 8 of the 10 tables filled with around 30 people by the time we leave, and she is still serving all by herself, with nary a confusion about who to serve first and what to prioritize.  What a HUGE difference from lunch!

We order a beef jun (pancakes) and dolsot bibimbap, plus a $1 for barley tea.  Everything is under $10, so it is a good deal based on what you get.  The meal comes in about 10 minutes and we get started not expecting too much.  She brings the side dishes, consisting of kimchi, radish kimchi, squash jun, sprouts, and potoatoes.  Radish kimchi and sprouts were awesome, squash and potatoes were good, and kimchi was very good.  A bite into the jun and... wow, this stuff is great!  The meat looked to be typical brisket meat, but man, the coating was delicious!  I taste the bibimbap and again, it is spot on.  Good but way too much salad and an ample side of rice make the meal complete.

You pay for it at the counter, and again the same lady who serves you cashes you out.  Model of efficiency although you can't expect the service to be quick based on the demands.  They could use another server.  But all-in-all a very satisfying meal very close to those great home cooking you always reminisce about.  It's a big thumbs up!

Table-for-1 Factor:  Given the fast food like atmosphere, you couldn't ask for a better meal for 1.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,3,2,4,HrYeRZdJcdaV4XsnYNzZ1g

I've also tried their hot tofu soup which is also amazing. For banchan, I usually get kimchi, the fish cake, cucumber and the other pancake (forgot the name).

But the amount of meat and other things in the broth was very minimal. It was more broth than it was anything else so I was very disappointed :( 

Other than that, their rice plates are a good hearty portion. Which is why I expected their kalbi soup to be. Employees are friendly and I'll still be coming here to enjoy their rice dishes.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,2,1,3,81TbXV9hDfFM6bH8hp83wA
5778684,2011-09-06,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"Jun's is my go to place for Korean food cravings. Big portions of good food at low prices. They have the best homemade fried mandoo with filling that's mostly meat, not all bean sprouts and cabbage. 

Since they're from Hawaii, its also one of the few places you can find meat jun - thinly sliced and marinated beef, egg battered and pan fried. I guess meat jun is a Hawaii born ""Korean"" dish, so its hard to find on the mainland. 

I usually get the 3 meat combo plate for $10 - choice of kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork, meat jun, BBQ chicken or spicy chicken. If you eat there you get all of the banchan sides, with take out you get a choice of 3. Their kimchee is slightly sweet and pretty spicy. My fav sides are the fried tofu, shoyu potatoes, cucumber kimchee, bean sprouts and fried zucchini. 

They're open everyday and I've always had friendly service. Everything is cooked to order with just 1 cook, so it can be a little slow if they're busy. But nothing crazy.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,3,0,5,h25XzMSAeW0peh7iotcuVw

I stumbled upon this as I saw a Cuban restaurant that seemed like it looked pretty good, I instead saw this big huge Korean symbol and looked at it and went here instead of the Cuban restaurant. It was like any typical fast food teriyaki joint. The tables are sparse and the decor is lame. I didn't expect too much. I sat down and ordered their combination platter which included kalbi, chicken, fried pork, bulgogi, dumplings and rice. The side dishes were, of course, complimentary with the meal like any traditional Korean restaurant. The kimchee was good but I had better. Their food was decent and not amazing by any means but for a quick Korean meal and for a good price I would recommend trying it because it is decent for the price. I didn't have to travel to Chinatown to get it either.

I've never eaten bland Kalbi tang at a restaurant before. I added salt and then more and more. I think they plain forgot to add salt. Yuck! Problem #2: The short rib bones and meat must come out a midget cow because they were the smallest rib bones I've ever seen and the meat pieces were a joke. Regret eating here.

5878440,2015-07-03,0,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"The meat jun is a solid four stars. The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.  

Service can be better, but the lady has all tables to herself.  I guess someone called in sick today?  It's a fairly cheap meal for Korean food.  

Long story short, come for the meat jun and that's it.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,2,2,3,lbYUP6Xl4aBJuCxgWadTJA

5923695,2010-08-27,2,SAfuIUZMXrOnb3LWyvYjDA,"Overview:  I frequent this little food spot often and I don't know why I never wrote about it till now.  It is Korean food, but I get the feeling that it has been adjusted towards the American palette.  I'm no Korean expert, so I can't judge on authenticity, but I am very familiar with my tongue.  So I can at least tell you how the food tastes.

Location:  Jun's is located in a strip mall that shares a parking lot with Regal Cinemas north on the 215 on Eastern if I am not mistaken.  This area seems to have taken a turn towards the Asian as of late.  And I am not disappointed about it.  The Market just north along the strip mall has all kinds of Asian goodies and some pretty decent Filipino food.  Then there's the ever popular Lemongrass Café.  I'm loving it.

Exterior:  Nothing special.  It is just a sign, glass store front, and a door.  Look for the red, white, and blue sign.  You can't miss it.

Interior:  Again, nothing special here.  There are a couple of standard tables and chairs.  No booths.  The wall has some pictures of writing and what not.  You can place your order at the counter for takeout or have a seat and get service.  

Service:  Two options on this one.  Order at the counter or at your table.  Eat in or take out.  There are two servers that I always see there.  One is the younger, friendlier, but not so talkative women.  Then there is the older, not so friendly, less talkative, women.  I don't go there for the service anyway.  They get my drinks, my order, and my food.  I could ask for nothing more.

Food:  You'll always receive a bunch of side dishes that go with your meal at most if not all Korean places.  I love the Kimchi, Kimchi cucumber (I think it's cucumber), and everything else except the potatoes or whatever.  I am just not a fan of potatoes.  I'm sure they taste good to someone, just not me.

My normal meal is the Jun's special.  I love everything that comes on this plate.  The dipping sauce is tasty for the man du.  The meats are flavorful.  I even like the taste of the salad.  My girl friend gets the Kimchi soup or something.  She seems to love it.  We will often make special trips here just so she can get a bowl of it.  I say special because it is not exactly a short trip for us to get here.

One thing that I did not enjoy from Jun's was the seafood pan cake.  I just didn't like it.  It wasn't my thing.  Now I'm not going to pass judgment on it since I think it's just a personal taste thing and I don't know what good Korean pancake is supposed to taste like.  I'm just throwing it out there.

Summary:  So over all, this has always been a good meal at a good price for me and my girlfriend.  It takes me back to Hawaii and Yummy Korean BBQ in the Prince Kuhio Plaza.  I think that is why we always come back to this spot.  It's like a taste of home.  It may not be the most traditional or accurate representation of Korean food, but I don't care.  I like it and it makes me happy.",aj2pS6AFVlzKDDUrisIRaA,3,3,4,L0RHF_J33cQmnnKQUawraQ
