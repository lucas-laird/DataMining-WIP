20806,2010-09-27,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"Being a Chicago pizza fan Amore was the first pizzeria I checked for Chicago pizza.

For me true Chicago Pizza is Giodrano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East. It is difficult to find true Chicago pizza outside of Chicago. Amore does a good job with their pizza though, especially if you can't travel all the way to Chicago!

The stuffed pizza is huge and heavy. The outer crust is about 2.5 inches thick (or should I say tall), nice and crispy, the bottom crust is relatively thin and chewy but manages to hold all the ingredients. There's plenty of cheese and all the other toppings tasted fresh. Their sausage is particularly good, having a nice sweet taste of fennel. The sauce has a nice chunky texture and balances sweetness and tanginess pretty well. The pizza is greasy, at least if it has sausage (due to the huge size and amount of toppings) but also very satisfying, believe me if you are hungry and think you can easily eat a normal 14"" pizza, you'll probably only be able to eat half of the 14"" Amore pie.

Note if you order a stuffed pizza to eat in or take out, the pie takes 45 mins to cook.

The indoors sitting area is decorated with all sorts of pictures and memorabilia from Chicago, overall pretty clean and good service.

If you want Chicago pizza in Las Vegas, Amore is probably the only real choice (along with Rosati's maybe, and I'd say Pietown but it's closed for now). Their pizza is big, has plenty of toppings and is very satisfying. It's the next best thing if you can't travel all the way to Chicago.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,15,4,5,5VSibZv-3Q8V3AMZBz8pfg
26267,2010-04-23,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"Amore Taste of Chicago is a far cry from authentic Chicago pizza, however it will hit the spot in the absence of a better choice.  The restaurant doesnt have much atmosphere, i'd recommend getting your pie to go (especially if you dont want to wait the 45 mins it takes to bake).  They have a large menu with pasta choices, apps, and some salads.  House salad was decent, the creamy garlic dressing was super good.  Their pizza crust is mediocre and a bit too crispy.  The sauce is slightly sweet and not flavorful enough.  The spinach on my pizza was the frozen kind and extremely watery, which threw off the entire thing.  I would recommend getting a cheese pizza here when you are craving deep dish, since there arent many options in this area.

136809,2013-01-04,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"This review is for their stuffed pizza.We came here since South Chicago has apparently closed since my last visit, and we were looking for a Chicago-style pizza fix. My friend and I visited in mid-afternoon on a weekday. My friend was disappointed they don't serve alcohol; he likes a glass of wine with his pizza; it's something I never think to ask about. We both ordered a medium stuffed pizza, intending to take most of it home for meals over the next few days.  About 45 minutes later, our pies arrived. Both were the overstuffed delights like we had previously experienced, and we both have 3 days worth of meals packed in our refrigerators. I have some minor quibbles, so I'll address them here. First of all, they were out of mushrooms. How do you run out of mushrooms? So, no mushrooms on my pizza. The sauce was fine; we both agreed we liked it all right, but there was something about it that made us think it was not quite as good as what we'd had before. I ordered pepperoni and ""homemade sausage"" on my pie, and the sausage flavor was completely overpowered by the pepperoni. Next time I'll skip the pepperoni if I want to taste the sausage. Finally, part of the reason we visited the restaurant is that they did not deliver to our locations; we would have needed to use a 3rd party delivery service. In conclusion, I'll likely get pizza here again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Please don't close!",Y_ZrYeUZnROvahSrkU9k_g,1,1,4,vYJoIlIlJhWjXm9LlqnS-A

Ok. So I tried to change up the lyrics. So what. However, every time I walk into that place. It's true. I am in love. Amore Taste of Chicago is by far the closest thing I have to Chicago style food in Las Vegas. 

I must admit the first time I went I may have gone a little overboard with my friends (who are Chicago natives)  . We first decided just to get a deep dish pizza and a salad. You know to keep it fresh and light. Then we happened to see they have thin crust pizza. So we got that to.  Oh and maybe a few Chicago style hot dogs. 

Get off my back man. We were excited! 

Needless to say everything was delicious. You really can't go wrong. However, some people at the table preferred thin crust to deep dish. Things were civil... until a pepperoni was thrown.

As for me, I loved them both. Deep dish, thin crust. I don't care. Amore puts a whole lotta love into all their dishes.             

The family atmosphere I believe makes the experience even more wonderful. The place was packed with families wearing their Chicago sports team apparel . Not to mention the staff which makes you feel like you have been going there for years!

Amore Taste of Chicago is by far one of my  favorite places to dig in & I suggest you do  the same! 

My Tips:
 1) When ordering a deep dish, know that they can take up to 45 min to               make. Trust me its worth the waits. 
2) DO NOT walk into Amore's wearing an other sports apparel besides Chicago teams. It's just polite.

Okay, I've now been here twice. Unless a place blows me away the first time, I like to take an average of two experiences to get a feeling for what a famished future me could expect. Usually the experiences are pretty similar; but at this place, not at all. My friend has been coming here for years, and warned me of their inconsistency. I really wanted him to be wrong, but alas, he was not.

LAST MONDAY:
We ordered the fried ravioli as the appetizer, a medium deep dish pizza, and the order of two Vienna hot dogs with fries. 

Really enjoyed the fresh bruschetta that they brought complimentary while we looked over the menu for our first time. It added nicely to the experience, and it was delicious.

Pizza was my favorite. Such a great taste, with buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and of course, a melty mess of mozzarella. The ravioli was pretty standard, with the gooey cheese inside and a warm marinara on the side. And the hot dogs were (surprisingly) delicious. A good snap, with crisp, fresh veggies, perfectly steamed bun; and the crunchy fries along side. Couldn't really ask for anything more. 

The service last week was OKAY. The young girls up front are nice, but kind of unhelpful. They seemed preoccupied with absolutely everything except the customers. Also, pretty sure hair needs to be pulled back and not falling forward if you're serving food according to the health district. Just kind of seems unprofessional and unappetizing. Out of four or five girls, only one had their hair up.


THIS MONDAY:
Came in around the same time as last week, around 7pm. This time, ordered the fried mozzarella to start, followed by two orders of the double Chicago dogs, and one order of the Italian Beef Sandwich.

Let me start off by saying that EVERYTHING was completely inconsistent with the quality we experienced last week. This time, the food all tasted very bad, like the chef temporarily lost the use of his taste buds, or didn't even try the food being sent out.

As sad as this makes me, I wouldn't eat the beef sandwich again if you paid me. It was honestly inedible and disgusting. The meat tasted old and flavorless, the au jus was barely lukewarm and overspiced (read: overcompensated with spices), and the bread was borderline stale.

And don't even get me started on the hot dogs; aka the biggest disappointment of my life. 

Where did that warm, soft, steamed bun from last week go? Gone; replaced with a bun that probably was from the same batch LAST WEEK. This bun was dry, stale, and unappetizing. The hot dog had a little too much ""snap"" this week, which made it seem like it was cooked or kept warm for a very long time and wasn't fresh. It had the taste of an old hot dog, like one that had fallen through the grill and been forgotten about. Except ALL FOUR hotdogs tasted like that. Disgusting. Left them on the plate barely eaten.

Even the bruschetta at the beginning of the meal was weird. None of us liked it. At all. It seemed mushy, and old, and wayyyyy too salty.

The ONLY GOOD THING about our second experience was the fantastic service. We had Bianca as our server. She was extremely attentive, very helpful in answering our questions, and accommodating with our requests. When we brought up the concerns with the food, she apologized and offered us a complimentary dessert for the shortcomings. Two of us declined, but my fiancé opted for the chocolate chip cheesecake to fill the void of the subpar hot dogs she ordered. This was a nice touch. We really felt heard, and Bianca assured us that the owner takes this feedback to heart and will make sure that our next experience will meet the high expectations we formed from our amazing first visit.


First experience: Four Stars. Five for food, minus one for service.

Second experience: Three stars. Literally zero for food, but plus three for Bianca's professionalism.

3.5 stars. Let's call it 3 flat, for inconsistency.

I am so hesitant to come back, but I will probably have to have a tie-breaker, and will update when that happens.",xAGAy6XHcRjkDz_dQKkguA,3,0,3,qAtkGoNFRe8gnqNbrn4DAw

The staff here is awesome, they really cater to their clients and are sincere in the service they provide, that doesn't happen all the time in Vegas!  We ordered the deep dish and were in for a 30 minute wait, totally didn't mind since it was just the two of us and I knew it would be fresh!  

We tried the fried mozzarella and wow was it packed with flavor, I could only do one piece but my hubby cleaned the plate!  Next was the bruschetta and THIS WAS PERFECTO, with honestly the best favored oil/balsamic I have ever had!!

Since this is a place with a Chicago flare, I tried the sausage, pepper, combo pie. Keep in mind that good things take time, wait is about 35-45 mins. While the wait is long, use this time to check out the big pizza oven in the back, the oven is as big as a small room!

As I mentioned, I ordered special pie, everything about it was nicely done! The crust was not doughy, but rather almost crisp and had a nice buttery flavor. The sauce was not too sweet, but had just enough acid to it. The cheese was standard, but what set everything apart was the homemade sausages that topped the pie! Right amount of spices, fat, and seasonings! Very nice! 

Next time I'm going to have to try some of the pasta dishes they have. Looked pretty good coming out from the kitchen!

291904,2013-06-08,1,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"I was VERY close to giving a 4, but I couldn't do it. 

My friend just moved to town in December from Chicago and he has been dying to try this place since he moved. We finally made a date of it, and went!

When we arrived, it was a pretty cool family-style table setting. Lots of cool decor on the walls, and fun atmosphere. I had made a reservation since it was Mother's Day, but they were not at all busy. Some large families in there celebrating mothas. 

Now to keep this semi-short, let me just tell you... My friend ordered the Italian Beef Sandwhich, plus we ordered a small deep dish pizza with sausage & pepperoni, and I had the Chicken Parm (original, I know). 

My chic parm was above average. However, the server messed up my order though and brought me the wrong pasta even after we had a very clear conversation on which one I wanted, but she took care of it, within a NON-timely manner. Oh wait for it. 

My friend ordered the Italian Beef said it was bland and left much to be desired. 

The deep dish pizza on the other hand was amazing. Very good. It deserves a 5. 
My parm deserves the 4. 

Here is where the 3 plays in. 

Service. Should be a 1. This waitress who was a s blonde to the core, with all the stererotypes to back it up.... had 3 tables, a two top, us (another two top) and a 4 top who was already served. She took 20 min to finally come take our order. She would constantly disappear and as I said earlier, brought out the wrong order of pasta. And don't even THINK about refills of their pepsi products (gross) Then at the end, we were looking forward to trying a Cannoli. I have never had it before, and this ditz of a waitress shows up, drops off our check and walks away. 

RUDE!

So we then had to flag another waitress down and ask for the dessert. Talk about a waste of a good evening! What could have easily been a 5 star night, turned into 3 because the lack of care and attention the staff paid.  At least the food was decent. Sadly, due to lack of service, in a Service-driven town, I am in no rush to return.  

The Cannoli was good. I have since tried it at 2 other places (one being the M Buffet) , which in turn made me think the one I had here was average.  

My advise, try it for yourself, keep your expectations low, and maybe you will enjoy it more than we did. Focus on the food, the deep dish, yum.

After a recent trip to Chicago I have had deep dish pizza on the brain.  Based off of another yelp review saying Amore has the best deep dish in Vegas I decided to give it a try.  

14"" deep dish sausage
The crust was was what I was expecting, crispy up the sides with that slight fry on the bottom - delicious!  The sausage has a nice taste, not to heavily spiced but enough so you know it is there.  The cheese was good, the sauce was a little too ""fresh"" for me, I like a heavier darker red sauce.  If you know what i mean.  Pizza was huge, a lot of food and we took half of it home.  Tomorrow's breakfast.

We ordered fried ravioli and fried mozzarella (huge portion).  They brought us a sample of bruschetta which was packed with flavor.

My wife ordered the Shirmp Diablo, requested it to be mildly spiced and was happy with her meal.

The service was great!  Our drink order was taken as we sat down and promptly refilled as needed.  We dropped a knife.  One of the servers heard it hit the floor and was on the way with a set of silverware before we even had a chance to ask.  Food came out as it was ready, the wait staff worked as a team delivering food to tables that were not their own.  Our server was very enthusiastic about the food.  I had the impression that she was a big fan of the food she was serving and not just there waiting on tables.

Deep dish takes a while to cook and our server told us it would take 45 minutes.  She gave us a menu and told us to phone ahead next time, they will get the pizza going and save a table for us.

I am looking forward to trying the Italian beef and sausage combo!",47FCWN_mGDi-hE8R6u8adQ,0,0,4,Ii2dRA9mX-hWTwAcA_iP5w

I didn't even know until the bill arrived that there was an up charge for that request. It should also be on the menu, under the item.

After stumbling upon one of their ads in the local paper, I immediately drove out and had to try this pizza which looked so delicious. My roommate and I ordered the deep dish pepperoni, and the mozzarella ""sticks."" 

The fried mozzarella was something I've never had before, and was blown away by it. Not your average run of the mill fried mozzarella. It is fried to perfection, and the sweet marinara compliments the rich taste perfectly.

Now the pizza, since that first time, I've been to Amore a half dozen times more. It's that good! I thought it was on the expensive side, but I quickly realize it is well worth it. The sauce is sweet just how I like it, you can just taste the freshness of the crushed tomatoes. The amount of cheese is perfect, not overbearing. But the main attraction for me is the crust. It is soft, buttery, flaky goodness. When you bite into it, the flavors just explodes in your mouth. The food is so good I'm catatonic after every meal at Amores!

I will give the French fries the benefit of the doubt since they were delivered but they were soggy and tasteless. 

The absolute worst part of this order was the fried dough. Described as, what else given the name, fried dough with powder sugar and honey. I was expecting something like Greek loukamedes. HA! It was barely cooked spare pizza dough that appeared to have been fried in the same as oil as the French fries.

We dined there on a recent Friday evening in celebration of Lauren's birthday.  Amore serves up authentic Chicago-style pizza, which is what draws Lauren to this place on a regular basis.  She's also a fan of the staff, who were friendly and accommodating the night that Mike and I were there for the party.

Mike and I shared an order of cheesy garlic bread, which came with a side of marinara. The bread was toasty, the cheese gently melted: a nice appetizer. 

For my entree, I chose Shrimp Diablo with crushed tomatoes and hot peppers on a bed of linguine. It's typically a pretty spicy dish, so I asked if they could tone it down for me. They agreed, and they delivered. It was still hot after a few bites built the spices up, but not nearly as much as it would have been. I adapted by repeatedly adding grated parm until the red sauce turned slightly orange. Strategic gulps of iced tea helped, too.  The sauce tasted fresh, and the linguine was al dente.

The only bothersome detail was the tails left on the shrimp. I know it looks better, but I hate it when restaurants do that, especially for hot dishes.  There's just no good way to remove the tails without burning yourself and/or making a big, saucy mess. 

Mike, of course, decided on pepperoni pizza for his meal. This was no surprise. The man could live on pizza seven days a week; he loves it that much. He selected thin crust because we've been trying to cut down on carbs... or that's what we tell ourselves.  It was good.

The thick-crust pies were a sight to behold. They were huge and seemed to be packed full of meaty, cheesy, tomato-y goodness.  Here's a mushroom and sausage pie that Steve ordered.  Steve let me sample the crust, and it was delicious.  


There are not a lot of options for dessert, but that's okay.  You're probably too full from the main course to eat it anyway, or you should be.  Still, Mike couldn't resist ordering some cannoli.  He made it contingent on me sharing with him, and I agreed.  I didn't want to let him down.  Aren't I a good wife?


Having eaten two pieces of garlic bread and half the shrimp, I was no longer hungry, but I managed to have a couple of tastes of the cannoli.  It was yummy.  Sometimes, if they've pre-filled them and left them sitting, the shells can get soft.  This one was crisp, breaking off with a satisfying crunch beneath our forks.  The cream was rich but not overly so, and the sweetness was just right with the chocolate chips.",_VhWwXj4E1qks3b-7Zmkpw,1,0,4,gGs8XCTIWROEzdt6jKTTNA

I called ahead to make a reservation for six people, and two medium pizzas. Two of which cancelled and I called back 6 to 8 minutes later after I had placed the order to try and change the order to just one pizza. The girl that took the call didn't tell me her name, didn't ask what I had ordered, what name the order was for, nothing. She just said,"" The pizzas where already in the oven, sorry."" And she went to hang up the phone, but so content was she in her blatant lie, that she missed placed the phone and left me still on the other end.

Now normally I'd have just hung up the phone but since she so obviously lied I decided to listen in, as I could still hear her talking. She started to speak to her co-worker and I quote said, "" I can't believe how um like fucking stupid people are, calling a few minutes later to change there order."" ""Haha, I know right."" ""I just told him the pizzas were already in the oven.""

This is what I heard on the line, before I hung up.

After I drove to the place(mind you I live 20-25 minutes away) I confronted the receptionist about what had transpired, with the manager standing next to me, I explained calmly what I had happened. She denied it and said another receptionist had taken the call. Which her co worker than took credit for and said she was the one that took the order. But also denied it. The manager looked at me and said, ""Was this the same tone I heard over the phone?"" referring to the employee standing before.

No apology from the manager, no offer, nothing. I just couldn't believe it. The girl then said, sorry that you had an unpleasant experience, or something along those lines. I was to angry to give a shit anymore.

I sat down to tell my friends what happened. As we told the server we wont be eating here after the way I was treated, she said and I quote, ""Well what was said wasn't directed at him but you're free to leave."" And here I was feeling sorry for leaving the server with one less table. Wow.

1. New Yorkers & Chicagoans love pizza.
2. New Yorkers & Chicagoans love to talk about how terrible pizza is outside of New York & Chicago. 

When my sister was visiting from out of town and mentioned she wanted to give Chicago-style deep dish pizza a shot, I decided I'd rather forgo a long lecture of how the sacrament of pizza-making is lost in this city and just find a place with relatively decent reviews. I was feeling pretty YOLO-y that day, so Amore it was. 

The joint is located in the same strip mall as Naked Fish, and the signage is old enough in Vegas years to be called vintage. Don't write it off yet just because the exterior is not at all spectacular. Walking in, it felt like a neighborhood, Cheers-esque kind of a pizza parlor where I imagine people would converge after football games if we could just do something about our damn Rebels. The fam bam and I ordered two medium stuffed pizzas - one with pineapple/bacon, and the other with sausage/mushroom. 

""Deep dish"" and ""stuffed pizza"" were apparently two different options, but to be completely honest, I'm not sure still what the difference was because as far as I'm concerned, it's just A LOT OF CHEESE, whichever way you go. It was a ""deep dish of cheese."" Or, ""stuffed with cheese."" All I know is that if you are lactose intolerant, you are SOL here. The service was fast and friendly, though be forewarned - either of these pizzas generally take around 45min to bake. The crust was a little thinner than I expected, considering the motherlode of queso it was holding up, but other than that, this is the place for those that are looking to truly relish in the ultimate cheat day.

I'm a New York thin crust type - so I've eaten at Amore's twice (once for lunch and once for dinner) and still think it's one of the best at delivering traditional Italian staples.

Between my friends and I we've had: Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Francese, Homemade Lasagna, Chicken Alfredo and everyone of us would rather eat here than in any other local Italian restaurant. The only disappointment was with an appetizer - the Caprese Salad, which tasted great, but was quite skimpy on the buffalo mozzarella - and who needs cucumbers in a Caprese Salad?

Dinners run $14 - $18. Pizzas start at $9.25 for a small cheese, and go up to $24 for 16"" ""everything"" and specialty combo pizzas/

There are still many dishes I'm looking forward to: surprisingly, Baby Back Ribs are a specialty, and also at a special price on Wednesdays. Chicken Piccata, Marsala, Cacciatore are all favorites of mine too. Portions are large, but the pasta with the meals is a smaller portion now than my first visit.

After working in Chicago for a lengthy amount of time and trying every pizza joint under the sun, Amore is OK, but not a worthy rave. The crust is buttery and overly sweet, kind of reminiscent of Gino's East. If you looking for a Giordano's/Lou Malnati's flavor, check out Rosati's or Maciano's...their sauces are a little more on the spicy side (read: more flavorful) and their crusts are not sweet so it doesn't seem like you're eating a pastry covered with sauce and cheese.

A pizza is round so why force squares into it? I wish they would ask your preference. The pizza itself  was really good and flavorful. You could really taste the fresh crushed garlic and aromatic basil. The only down-side was that it was a bit salty. That's saying a lot since I like salty food but even for me it was too much. I combatted it by dipping my slices into some balsamic vinegar. It was like bomb garlic bread. 

The deep dish was quite disappointing. No real redeeming qualities about it. I couldn't get over the salty sauce. This place would have gotten four stars had the food not been so salty and if the deep dish worth going back for. All in all, I would not come back for the deep dish but maybe for the margarita pizza, although there are so many pizza places to try in vegas that coming around back to this place might take a few months.

we try some bread, salads, rigatoni with sauce, sausage w/peppers and onions  pizza - both thick and thin.  the highlights - the sausage pepper and onions and the thin crust meatlovers.  i thought the thick was kinda thin ( and yes, i've eaten at 3 different  places in chi-town, including uno ) - my one pet peeve , i thought their sauce was too sweet.

overall, it ain't a bad place and i can see myself dropping by to get some sausage, peppers and onions to go.

I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  

Now I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!

My husband remember seeing this place multiple time so we decided to call in a carry-out and hoped to be able to pick it up on our way home.  I was surprised to be told that it was going to take 45 minutes for a small 10"" pizza.  Regardless, I was craving so my husband and I went home and waited until time to go pick it up.  When we got there, (after waiting for 50 minutes), it wasn't ready.  We had to wait another 5 minutes...

Now it was heavy (for a small pizza), so I was excited to get home and sink my teeth into a deep gooey cheese, pepperoni and green pepper pizza.  Visual everything looked great and the first piece of pizza was great but as the pizza started to lose it's warmth, the pizza beard got harder.  So I am not sure if it was because we got it to go or if that's how Chicago style deep dish pizza are...I doubt it but I will continue my search my Chicago style pizza.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but it wasn't what I was expecting...perhaps next time, I will hopefully have a better review.",FAjCZoxiGw9HJKueB8YWTg,3,1,3,hiCZCWEeCxZQRzC3vmJACQ

Having bookmarked ATC for six months prior to my trip,Amore Taste of Chicago 
is a place that I made a point to stop at!.

Being deprived in Hawaii (Note: Chi-Town Deep Dish Pizza Co in Hawaii isn't even close to this)and not plan on visiting Chicago in the near future. We set out our journey to find ATC. The drive was not bad from downtown and willing to do anything or drive anywhere I didn't care...Arriving to ATC I was very very excited!  Finally my wait is over!..Walking in...

I just LOVED the interior of this place,with all the pictures of Chicago Sports Greats and Celebrities that filled the walls.It just puts you in the mood for whats to come next.. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#L6-nCU2crqXwISzmLaB0WQ

*Chicago Style Deep Dish 14"" with Sausage and Pepperoni pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#TuP3Fgf3fxeEFut83VA3xw
I was just in awe to seeing our server Rosemary scoop the first slice out of that thick beautiful pie. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#5hE8XUhSbkfC52cWsjVHvQ  The thickness of the slice,fresh tomato sauce and melting cheese oozing out was just an awesome site to see.
Funny how digging into a pizza with a fork and knife never felt so right. The first thing that hits you is the great the flavor of the fresh tomatoes bursting when it hits your palate,spiciness of the sausage and pepperoni,Oh My God How Buttery The Crust Is...OMG! I just had a Foodgasm!

Our friend who had just returned from Chicago the previously week also was enjoying the pizza with us remarked it was like being in Chicago again!

Our server Rosemary was so friendly and helpful with all my questions I asked.

Rosemary: Where are you all from?
Me: Hawaii !
Rosemary: From Hawaii? *With a surprised look* How did you find us?
Me: Yelp!  ATC has some great reviews and I had to try great deep dish pizza! 
(Thank You all my LV Yelp friends!)

Just some helpful information:

*The normal wait for a Deep Dish is 45minutes
*You can call ahead for seating and pre-order your pie. It will cut down the waiting time. http://www.amoretasteofchicago.com/
*Located in Parkview Plaza.

No beer either... I wanted the specialty pizza, but half margarita and half pepperoni. Other places do it like Grimaldi's. But not here. So ok, I order a margarita pizza and just add some pepperoni on it. It came out with red sauce. I asked the server if I had the right pizza and was assured I did. I ate a couple of pieces. Then asked another server if a margarita pizza should have red sauce instead of white. Of course it's white. So she states maybe they were just out of white sauce. She comes back from the kitchen and said they made a mistake so I had pepperoni with spinach on it. I had eaten about 25% of it to this point. I stated, it was just ok pizza and I didn't feel like I should have to be forced into eating something I did not order  and advised I didn't want to pay for it. She rudely said, if you eat it you will pay for it. I said, then take it now. Really, no better option. Was I supposed to wait another 40 minutes after others where done... Grrr...So I did not eat. We contacted the owner through the Chicago Facebook page, he said he'd look into it. Nine days later he finally replied "" why don't we just come back there and have a free pizza on him"".

I split a small caesar salad. Plenty for two. My celiac husband requested no croutons and extra care taken with his food prep. The salad was light with a nice classic dressing. They passed the first major hurdle it was not overly dressed. 

Several people had the ribs, others deep dish pizza. All were happy. My chicken piccata was perfect with three large slices of chicken breast and a side of penne.

The ordering and pick up went pretty smoothly. I do want to note, if you select CC or Cash, be sure to stick with your payment option. I guess I had selected cash so they would not accept my CC as a form of payment. I had to run over to the store to get cash back in order to pay ATC for my pizza. Kind of a hassle, but they explained that the order did not go through them and that they were unable to change the payment method. In hindsight, I'm now thinking that's pretty strange though. 

So! To the pizza! The pizza was pretty good! Not the best pizza, but I will return to ATC. The thin crust still had a little softness to it (which I like). Some pizza joints can really crisp up their crust, so glad that I found a place that doesn't. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but not unbearably so. The amount of cheese they used was perfect... but having ordered double pepperoni, I noticed that it appeared like a ""regular"" amount of pepperoni. Not sure if that was a fluke or that is the norm. 

We had also ordered a cheesy garlic bread starter. The garlic bread was pretty good, nothing extravagant. I do wish that they hadn't wrapped them on top of each other, the cheese kind of stuck everything together. It was more so like a cheesy garlic sandwich by the time we got home.

Not only did I get the best customer service I've ever had from a pizza pace, I got an incredible pizza as well.

Service: service was great, the waitresses were attentive to our needs since we have 2 young kids this was a definite plus.

Food: been wanting to try deep dish pizza for quite sometime. We do have Giordano's now in vegas but wanted to get a local Chicago recommendation we ended up in amore. We ordered the deep dish pizza and some side orders. Salads, fries and cannelloni. The deep dish pizza was ok remember I don't have a point of reference for the deep dish but this review is based on my own subjective taste. The deep dish was piping hot, and we added pepperoni, bell pappers and mushrooms the cheese was gooey and the dough was thick. We did not enjoy the pizza as much and we might have expected I think we just preferred the thin crust pizza. We might want to try Lou Malnati's in Chicago to convert our preference. The thick dough was chewy and isnt crunchy. It's good pizza but isn't as good as I expected it to be.

Overall : it's good for huge parties , and for hanging out with friends, please don't expect too much from the pizza, the side dishes were good.",pcynTq-0cvM1fEW0oBVyww,0,0,3,9wiQxDT3OC0j8hlPf3Dh8A

2 Orders that made me an Instant Fan:

1. Chicken Vesuvio: A Pair of Chicken Skinless Chicken Fillet drenched in a pool of olive oil with herbs, spices and Garlic! I Mean Infused with Garlic! And 4 Large Slices of Potato Wedges. Presented on a Large Rectangle Plate.. Just Beautiful! Nicely Portioned and Taste So Gooood!

2. Deep Dish Pepperoni & Sausage Pie: Takes them approximately 45 minutes to prepare! Now this was more of a Pizza Pie! Thick, Saucey, Not too Cheesy and Toppings (especially the sausage) were a Hit! The Crust kind of crumbled like a Apple Pie crust. I haven't had too many Deep Dish Pies but this one is much better than Rosati's by a few miles!!

* Other Orders Not quite as good but decent: Chicken Marsala, Spaghetti with Meatballs (meatballs enormous like Buca Di Beppo), Minestrone Soup, House Salad with creamy garlic dressing (dressing kinda sweet). 

When I feel Deep Dish Pizza Pie, I come here. If I'm not feeling CPK's ""Chicken Milanese"" (btw one of their healthiest entrees and its damn good!) but still want chicken thats more unique, I come here for the Vesuvio. Service average but our Last Visit here the Service was Better. More Prompt and Comforting because of our server: ""Erica"". Thanks!

Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked.

The girl who answered the phone (who sounded like she has a 12 year old vocabulary and who has the personality of a stiff tree) told me that because the pizza takes 30 minutes to make, she wouldn't be able to make me what i want or any other kind of pizza for that matter. Now i understand that the restaurant closes at 10pm and the employees wanna go home, but seriously! Come on now! Would it have really killed them to stay a measly 10 minutes passed closing to make a simple pizza if it means gaining a potential, long term customer??? Geez!!! It's not like I rolled up in there at 9:59pm asking for a pizza!!! That would be inconsiderate.  I usually eat pizza for lunch or for early dinner.....never really passed 7 or so so it's not like i would have made it a habit to go later. Also, I'm one who also works in customer service and i too have kids to go home to, but to stay a couple minutes longer once in a blue moon to make someone happy has never once bothered me or my family! Small businesses have way too much competition with other small business owners and definitely with bigger chain businesses like Little Caesars and Pizza Hut  (despite the fact that Amore is ""chicago style"" pizza) to be so damn petty about making a pizza a few minutes passed closing time! To be honest, it doesn't even taste like chicago style! It's somewhat close and it's not bad tasting, but it's still las vegas' version of chicago style!

Amore means LOVE, and being from Chicago, my family and I do love us some deep dish pizza. Grandma took my boyfriend and I here for dinner. It was fairly quiet on a Saturday night with only a handful of tables occupied. All the ladies that were working were friendly. They greeted us with smiles and warm pleasantries. 

We ordered the large deep dish, sausage on the whole thing and half with pepperoni. We also ordered a couple beef sandwiches, one with hot peppers and one with sweet peppers and cheese, and added fries (they do not come with the sandwich and are an additional charge). Luckily for us, the beef sandwiches came out quick, which was good because I was starving! The sandwiches were good, I enjoyed the hot gardinera on mine as well as the au jus that came on the side for dipping. The fries are nothing special, I would skip getting those next time. Finally our pizza came out, and it was good, and very filling. This is the type pizza that you eat with knife and fork, and I could only eat one piece and was stuffed. Even my boyfriend who has a hearty appetite could only eat 2 pieces. They did not skimp on the meats or cheese, but the crust was lacking flavor. It could use some type of sprucing up, maybe some seasoning or some melted butter. It just tasted bland. Also I wish the pizza had more sauce, I love that sweet sauce with the chunky tomatoes. Still, the price is fair and we had plenty leftover to eat for lunch the next day. Grandma said that she hadn't been here in about 2 years and probably wouldn't come back for another 2. I guess she didn't like it. Oh well, I would come back if I was in the area and craving deep dish pizza and friendly service.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,5,3,nPgOQ78YJ_hnjvyY5gUWiA

I go to Amore maybe once every four/five months, but the last time I went I got an Italian beef. I lived in Chicago for a while so I know what a good Chicago beef is like. The Amore Italian beef isn't the same but it's enough to remind you of a Chicago beef and sometimes that's good enough when you really miss Chicago.

What I like about Amore is the Chicago atmosphere and it seems to hold on to the staff of (Mostly) friendly girls. I like seeing a familiar face when walking into an establishment.  The one server tells me that Amore treats her very well, which is another reason I like it. I won't go to a restaurant if I know the staff is treated like shit.

Amore has a pretty good deep dish and I like their pasta sauce, so anything with a red sauce is pretty good. 

I give this three stars because it's a fun place that reminds me of how good Chicago food is, but doesn't quite get me there to say ""holy shit this is just like the Chicago beefs (or deep dish) we used to get when we lived in Chicago!""

Caprese salad is a must.

Main dishes. 
They have a sandwich that rivals the breaded steak from Ricobenes. I was so happy to see this as Ricobenes is one of my all time favorites. Cooked with Turano bread from Chicago, good stuff.

It wasn't bad per se it just wasn't good either.

Ive eaten awesome Chicago Deep Dish and an awesome Chicago style thin crust square cut version many times and this over priced mediocrity isn't in the same ball park and both those pizzas btw were in 2 different restaurants in a very small Minnesota town of Winona, MN not even the Windy City itself.

The Deep Dish was too doughy, undercooked not enough cheese, sausage, mushrooms.
The Thin crust was just meh...it should of been bursting with flavor! a rich sauce, flavorful spicy pepperoni and sweet succulent pineapple...it had barely any of that flavor profile.

Was it bad?  Truthfully No....the sausage and mushrooms were fine what little there was...nothing horribly wrong with the sauce...I'll just say I won't be spending another 40$ dollars here any time soon, not unless they change their recipe.

There was no offer to refund, have us pick up a new pizza that my kid can eat or anything. I just paid for a slab of gluten free bread because the toppings can't even be eaten.
Hey guys- guess what- I could have made her toast with tomato sauce and saved $13+ delivery. And next time I will.
You've lost our business and I can tell you don't care. But you know what, it's really rude that YOU GUYS messed up and can't even make it right.

I was in more of pasta mood. I do intend come back try the deep dish.

Talk about from the minute walk in the place screams Chicago. I have had the pleasure visiting Chicago years ago for friends wedding. Some of the famous landmarks or touristy spots in the city been there done that in life. All around the restaurant every wall is collage of those iconic landmarks more so sports as main focus. Wrigley Field. The Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Cubs. I can appreciate any business more less restaurant that gives shout out too NHL or ice hockey. If your Cubs or Blackhawks this IS the spot check out games. Just happens the Cubs in the post season. I came for dinner one night they were playing and couple tables full on Cubs fan in jerseys. All full engaged in the game. They have three wide screens decent size around the restaurant so NO way not going miss Cubs or Blackhawk game. One more note about shout out for hockey. They have team picture of the Blackhawks with Lord Stanley Cup on the wall. 

I started with house salad. Talk about decent size salad. It was on big oval plate not small bowl or tiny plate. I went with the house italian dressing. Everything together was refreshing and great starter dish. Pasta keep it simple Penne with meat sauce. The Penne was cooked perfect nice al dente. The sauce was ok. It was nice hearty lots of ground meat in it. The tomato sauce tasted fresh with nice body to it. Overall nothing that blew me away taste. Definitely dish would order again. The portion size they give you is huge. Price is very reasonable across the menu. I need try the deep dish pizza next visit.

Service was above average. It wasn't super busy when we went in the second time (been here twice) so they were pretty attentive. The first time we came in it was super busy and we did have a hard time finding our server. So quality of service may just depend on how busy they are.

It was 9:42pm and she said no i'm sorry, I closed down the register. Whats the point of having hours if you turn away good customers before your closing time when they assured us we would be fine.

By places like this I mean small, seemingly family owned, authentic, hole-in-the-wall places that give you a ""you came for the food not the atmosphere"" vibe. There is no fluff to this restaurant - the tables and chairs are reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. They don't need to impress you with fancy chairs and decor - though - because they know the food is what will keep you coming back. They started us off with a free bruschetta, and as surprised as I was I was in love with it. If I hadn't wanted to try more for the review I would have ordered an appetizer of them! As it is, I did want more variety and we had the calamari and split a caprese salad. The salad was disappointing but I think it's mostly the presentation. You get several fat slices of mozzarella so I wouldn't say it was small, but it felt small. They should move it to a smaller plate because I think my mind was playing tricks on me - I thought they certainly couldn't be charging eight dollars for that.

However, the calamari was a saving grace. Delicious and deep fried - the only part that confused me was that it came with a sweet chili sauce. The kind I would normally dip lumpia into. It came with regular pizza sauce too, however, and that satisfied me. It was watery and chunky - I prefer others but it wasn't by any means bad. Then the killer - the pizza you waited 45 minutes for!! We got a double pepperoni and I was stuffed after one slice. I wish the crust on the bottom was softer for a deep dish but it was still worth the wait. Reheating this pizza the next day was AMAZING though. It's one of those foods that is better as a leftover.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,5,4,4,p9Cf_7Rpt03L5-Kfuk_S2g

I've tried both their deep dish and their thin crust. Be prepared to wait if you want to order a deep dish. The wait time for a deep dish is at least 45 minutes. I've always preferred deep dish but after having Amore's thin crust I've converted over to thin crust. 

Their thin crust pizza stays crispy and is the best I've had. After trying their pizza, other pizzas just doesn't come close. Whenever my boyfriend and I have pizza at other places we always take a bite and say "" It's no Amore..."" 

The service has always been really great here. One time our pizza came with a missing slice. My boyfriend and I just looked puzzled because we were missing a piece. The waitress informed us that they accidentally dropped a slice on the floor and will give us a little discount for the missing piece. When the check came they actually waived off the ENTIRE pizza. How sweet is that?

I've only had their deep dish twice and both times we had about half pizza left because its just so filling we could never finish it all. Still tasted good hours later when it was cold.

Parking is never a problem here. It's actually in a pretty dead plaza or at least every time I'm here there's almost no cars. 

Tried their spaghetti once and regretted it. It just seemed really plain. Their fried mozzarella are really good though.

I recently came to Amore while visiting family in Las Vegas and naturally I asked where the best beef sandwich was in town and Amore was the answer I got. So we stopped in around 1pm mid-week and it wasn't very crowded, but the place was clean and pleasant. The server was good, she refilled drinks several times and didn't leave us hanging for too long and she was friendly.  

I ordered a beef sandwich with sweet peppers and a side of fries. Not that I'm an expert or anything, but I would say this was a good place to eat overall. The sandwich was good, the beef was clearly cooked right as well, however the fries left a bit to be desired. So I can't go as far as to call it the best I've ever had, because it isn't, but it is better than a lot of Chicago-style food places I've been to and they have good service and reasonable prices as well.

With an over abundance of bread, the filling flavor was lost. Additionally, the pizza crust was crispier than one remembers a Chicago pizza having.  

As for the shrimp scampi appetizer, 4 shrimp and bread in sauce is what I got. Knowing this was my first time in and with minimal appetizer description, I'd have liked the waitress to clarify this was what I was getting, unfortunately she wasn't the most astute and I wasn't on it either.  I tried ordering a side of pasta to go with my 4 shrimp and sauce but was told I couldn't order but a large plate of pasta to go with my appetizer. Hmmm... Overall, the flavor was okay.

I was disappointed again. I feel like they are skimping on the sauce, seasonings, and grated cheese on the deep dish. I ate it anyway but called there the next day to voice my opinion only to be told that they have NOT changed anything. I asked to speak to the manager/owner who would not get on the phone with me. Instead I had the ""pleasure"" of two ladies on the phone telling me that if I would have brought the pizza back the previous night they ""might"" replace it but since I called the next day they can't do anything about it.  I didn't call for that reason - to get a replacement. I wanted to know if this was the way the pizzas are made now.

The Italian beef sandwich was tasty too, it was flavorful, full of meat and I appreciated a generous portion of really hot (temp) juice for dipping...I did think the gardinar peppers could have been chopped a bit more...not as chunky.  We spent less than $20.

As we were leaving I assume he was the owner Mike introduced himself to us and was telling us about other menu items...it was a good feeling to know we were valued as customers (this is becoming rare).

 We shared the mozzarella appetizer among four of us and we all enjoyed it.   The toppings on the pizza were spot on.  The homemade sausage, the sauce, etc. were all very good but we found the crust to be a bit bready.  The crust was lighter than most but noticed it was thicker in some areas of the pie.

I ate their only once before and it was very good - excellent pizza, good service, etc, 

This was a multiple rib order. We ALWAYS order ribs and any bar-b-que with the sauce on the side, regardless of the establishment, and not only was each order slathered and drowning in sauce, but it was a terrible thin sauce like something watered down out of a bottle. They were soggy because of so much sauce, ""soggy"" being the keyword to this terrible dinner. The delivery was quick, less than thirty minutes, I live less then three miles away, but the French fries were a soggy pile like they had been in the container for hours. We also had the large order of mozzarella sticks that should have been eight for almost twelve dollars, but we got the small order of four, still being charged for the large. They too were soggy like they had been microwaved. The soggy cornbread came wrapped in plastic which will immediately compromise the quality of anything - you don't put hot food in plastic and expect something edible, but I have to go back this sauce thing. This was an eighty dollar order and it looked like a child had put it together, there was absolutely no regard to what we ordered. The ribs themselves weren't bad but this place needs to re-train their cooks as to how to add sauce to bar-b-que, and how to prepare food that won't be served right away. And their six dollar delivery fee is uncalled for, especially considering the overall price of this order.

I had been eagerly waiting to try their deep dish pizza since I previously lived really close by and wanted to establish my ""go to"" Vegas pizza spot. I called ahead for pick-up and was told my deep dish pizza would take 45 minutes - no problem, good things take time. I came to pick up my pizza and headed home. Granted, this is my fault for not looking at the pizza first, but once I got home, I realized they had given me a regular pizza, not the deep dish. I called back to let them know of their error, and the girl that answered was super apologetic and placed me on hold so she could get someone to remedy this situation. Instead of being helpful, the guy who picked up the phone basically told me I was in the wrong and there was no way they could have made a mistake and that I did not order the deep dish. I fired back with... if I didn't order deep dish, why did you tell me it would be a 45-minute wait for my food? That kind of quieted him down and he tried to back peddle and say although it wasn't their fault, they could make me another pizza. I didn't want to wait or have to be subject to in-person ridicule after driving back, so I said I would pass, but I wanted to make them aware of the issue. He rudely hung up. Granted, the pizza we did have was good and my husband really enjoyed the oily-ness of it all. For me, I can't support a place that accuses customers of wrongdoing so quickly and doesn't try to remedy the situation in a polite manner, so I won't be back.

Expect mediocre service and waitresses who care more about eating their ice cream than taking your order..... Let alone the right order.

We were the only people in the restaurant and we had to ask to be served. Doesn't make much sense to me. 

This time around I gave them a second shot. Their spaghetti and meatball lunch special was yummy like the first time around but the thin crust pizza was good but not that good. We ordered pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage and ended up with pepperoni, mushrooms, and a massive amount of onions. The onions made the rest of the pizza taste like Dominos ( the boyfriend said this ). He really wanted to try their home made sausage on the pizza so we are still waiting. Other than that, the service was still lacking even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. I would be disappointed but fool me once shame on you......fool me twice shame on me. 

As far as recommending this place.... I would say make sure you come when a good waiter/waitress is here. I wouldn't know if they have one.

Calamari was lightly breaded and came out by itself with sauce(gravy). This was amazing and they way all the restaurants should serve it IMHO. 

Pizza (here we go) 
Deep dish sausage: good flavor, extra sauce (gravy) with a little extra crispy crust made this a decent pie.

Our pizza had pepperoni and sausage on it. The sausage was homemade, and it tasted delicious. The pepperoni had a little spicy taste to it just how I liked it. The crust was amazing. It was really chewy without being overly doughy... if you can even comprehend that. The large was huge! There were three of us, and 4 slices were consumed of it. Over half the pizza was left over, and it tasted good heated up the next day.

We also ordered mozerella sticks... except they weren't sticks. They were triangles! They were triangles of gooey, crispy, mozerella goodness. I have never had better mozerella sticks ever. We should have ordered 8 instead of 4. 

The atmosphere was nice. There was some Italian music playing in the background, a bunch of baseball/football/chicago in general memorabilia throughout the restaurant.

The place was dead though. Only one other person came in while we were dining, which is a shame for a place with good pizza. I will definitely be back.",-zWAApe_-ZLX5HfyAsaLQg,1,1,4,mVP2L2amWUnvBCLwbSgklw

Yes it's a bit filling, but it's deep dish.. and yes it's about a 45 minute wait time, but it's worth the wait. We haven't had any other pizza like it. The tomato sauce and tomatoes are so zesty and fresh. We usually get it when we have family in town or friends over because there's so much and it's a no-fail pizza for guests. It makes great leftovers if it's oven-warmed. He prefers carry-out, though we've dined in before.

I mean coming from a family that glorifies Chicago eats- we had to check this place out! It's becoming a family favorite for their large portions and open seating which is perfect for groups, as well as for my big, loud and lovable family! They have wall to wall Chicago themed decor and Flat Screen TV's for all the Sports Enthusiasts too!  

We enjoyed their wide selections of pizzas and even waited the grand 45 mins for the signature deep dish! Wish I could say how delicious it was but I was too full from the scrumptious Chicago Hot Dog (with all of the fixings) by the time our pizza came-so to go it was!! 

Worthy Mention! The Chicago Hot Dog. 
Order it how it comes-no exceptions (you can do without the sport peppers #HEAT) . I think it's the Best ""Chicago"" Hot Dog I've tasted in town yet!

3015232,2011-11-10,1,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"I want to publicly apologize for the years I adamantly preached that thin crust pizza is best.  Amore changed my pizza loving ways forever. So--dear eaters--I sincerely apologize for not listening to you Chicago deep dish lovers.  I was so wrong.

Amore is one of those pizza joints that you pass by while driving home, but never take the time to stop in.  Since I'm a bit adventurous at the moment, I decided to cancel my mail order deep dish from Chicago (from Lou Malnati's) and take my mother here for some Italian.  There are two reasons I chose this place out of all places in Vegas - 1) the reviews are oustanding, and 2) the chicago deep dish pizza.  

When you first walk in, you see a casual eatery; the usual metal chairs and chicago-dressed 4 top tables fill the seating area.  There's sports memorabilia on counters, and posters on walls. But forget the decor--the scent of cheese and pasta should get you excited when you walk in the door.

The staff is friendly and will tell you what is best when you ask.  I trust the staffers, since they eat the food for lunch daily.  The consensus? - Ribs, deep dish, and lasagna.  The girls say that the ingredients are from home (Chicago), so it tastes just as good, if not better.  It takes 45 minutes for a deep dish'er, but trust me--it is worth the wait.

The appetizer list is short and sweet.  We went for the usual fare--some breaded mushrooms with ranch dressing.  Their breading is well seasoned, crispy and isn't oily at all.  There were no grease stains on the plate even after sitting for a few minutes.  The lasagna is creamy, layered with sliced sausage and ricotta and dressed with a fresh tomato sauce that is so darn good.  I like the sliced sausage or meatballs in the lasagna and LOVE the cheesiness.  The sauce, with it's tangy kick balances the sausage and  cheese out well.  The ribs are melt-in-your-mouth tender and they aren't slathered in sauce, which I appreciate.  It's sweet and smoky with a bit of spice and tang.  Served with lots of fries and some beans, it's a big boy dinner.

The star of the night was the deep dish pie we ordered.  The first time I laid my eyes on it I was excited to see the crust uneven.  The sauce is fresh and the cheese, decadent.  The first slice came up with the spatula followed by a strings of cheese, almost endless as I placed the first slice on my plate.  This is not your pick up and eat pizza; this requires a fork and knife.  The crust is flaky and buttery, well seasoned and so much fun to eat.  The cheese is creamy and unending, the sauce tangy but sweet, and the pepperoni crispy and gives just the right amount of saltiness to the dish.  The best part--the spicy kick in their sauce.  It's subtle, but there.  I ate half the pie, savored every bit of the crust, and wiped my plate with it to catch all the leftover cheese and gobs of sauce.  I did it all in complete silence and focus, mind you, finally coming up to breathe once I had my fill.  

This joint is a great stop on anyone's Yelp to-try list. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled at first to try a deep dish pizza, but once I saw it was love at first sight, and marriage by the first bite.  You cannot beat great pizza, let alone great deep dish, and this place takes the pie.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,4,HvrmDtlasAVJ1pD7EoyBZQ
3023978,2016-05-31,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"From the outside it looked like a hole in the wall... but the inside was nice! Tons of comfortable seats, lots of posters/pictures on the walls and some TVs. Service was great and it wasn't very crowded when we went around 2 PM on a Sunday. 

We ordered the garlic cheesy bread which came with a side of marinara. I wish the garlic cheesy bread was more garlicky but everyone has their own preferences. My sister and her bf thought it was fine. Good thing we ordered the bread because the pizza did take about 30-40 minutes. 

We ordered a medium deep dish pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and pineapple. When the pizza came out, we didn't see any pineapple and asked about it.... we didn't realize that for deep dish, they put some toppings (like our pineapple) underneath the cheese. Oops. The pizza was good, but the crust was very very hard. I've never had a deep dish pizza before, but I was expecting a soft crust. Also, the crust was a bit on the sweet side. I'm not sure if its because the pineapple was sweet and it seeped into the crust or what but I wasn't a big fan of the crust. There was a ton of cheese, and the pineapple was a very good addition to the pizza. 

Our total for 3 people came out to be around $26 before tip which wasn't bad at all considering we had about half the pizza left. I think an appetizer, a salad and a medium pizza would be more than enough for 3 people.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,2,1,3,PL2PWVqXN2SKCWuhULvUww

Who knew that Vegas actually had a place that would cater to such need? Not I!  Thanks to Yelp, we made the trek here from the Vegas strip to grab italian beef sandwiches. The quality of meat was actually better than the average sandwich you normally get outside of Chicago. With the giardinera, it actually tasted rather authentic. The fries were hot and fresh - just how I like em! The service here was pretty good as well even though we were only three of about six patrons at the restaurant.

It's pricey for a pizza but it's worth it. The pizza takes awhile to make but it's worth the wait and having pretty girls to look at isn't bad either. It is just overall great pizza. It's like cheese, bread, pepperoni and tomato sauce all had an orgy and some how they all got pregnant, fused and made one big baby, then I come along and I eat their delicious pizza baby and bite into it and have all their delicious orgasmic flavors in my mouth, but it doesn't make me gay because the pizza was a girl, that's how damn good it is.",wOGLvH0914zZu7_bhpVUyw,0,0,5,hGCGvl4Vv8Os3YaHDWi1MA

3096538,2014-08-10,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"IMHO, best Chi town style pizza in Vegas, pan & thin.  That said, the crust is not perfect (needs more cornmeal on the bottom of the thin), but the sauce & other ingredients are spot on.  Service was efficient and friendly. Restaurant atmosphere is so so. Too bright, & over the top. Not ""warm"" & inviting. Kinda like cafeteria style, with a lot of Chicago memorabilia crap strewn on the walls. Sadly, they didnt even have a Sox game on this night that was scheduled on the many TVs, because they dont pay for the blackout service! Come on! You're a Chicago place! Pop for all the full sports packages to get all the  Chicago games! They said they won't get all the Bears games this fall either.....booooooo.....clearly not a "" true"" Chicago place! Anyway, I digress. Prices are rather high; thin crust pizza runs 23.00, ( largest thin crust with one ingredient),  same pizza in Chicago is probably, 14.00 (at Vito & Nicks anyway).   Furthermore, they miss on the Italian beef sandwich.  I don't think it's authentic Gonella bread, or the same kind of Chicago beef, & the gravy (dipped au jus), was very bland. The giardinare was terrible. I will go back for the pizza for sure, but order ahead to avoid the long wait for the pan pie.

3129307,2014-10-08,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"Have seen the advertising on TV and switched our dinner plans on a whim as we drove by.
My wife had the Chicken Angelo,my son had the BBQ Chicken sandwich and I tried the lasagna.  First, the Chicken Angelo--the sauce was bland and unseasoned.  It is supposed to be a white wine and chicken base reduction with lemon.  It was almost tasteless.   2 stars.  The BBQ Chicken sandwich was fine, but there was a mystery side salad (about a cup and a half of chopped lettuce, chopped red onions and 3 tomato slices served without any dressing or dressing choice offered.  French fries portion was generous, crispy and hot..  3 stars.  My lasagna was puzzling.  The waitress indicated there was ""lots of cheese"", but I thought they skimped..  The top layer of cheese was mozzarella, and all the interior cheese was ricotta.  They advertise a meat sauce on the layers, but I had ricotta only, which made the lasagna fairly dry--not moist and gooey, like I am used to.  The lasagna was accompanied by two rather skimpy (I am guessing 2 ounce) meatballs on the side.   I have had, and I also make a whole lot better.  2 stars.  I would recommend doubling the meatballs--the cost would be only about 80-90 cents.

All 3 dishes arrived at the same time, however the consequence of this was that my wife's and son's dishes were piping hot, while my lasagna was just past warm only.  

One minor gripe.  When we got the bill after trying to catch the waitress's eye for about 3 or 4 minutes, the plastic folder stated ""We proudly accept American Express Cards"", which my wife put in for payment.  Our waitress took one look and informed us they no longer accept AMEX--handed the bill back and promptly scooted to another part of the restaurant.  Four minutes and 10 seconds later (finally---my chronograph watch does something useful !!l!), she returned to collect the check and credit card.  Another 3 and a half minutes and she returned with the bill for my wife to sign.  She managed to finish the night by hitting one of my pet peeves..  She started clearing the table while my wife was signing and while we were still seated.  After almost 9 min to check out, she couldn't have waited 30 more seconds for us to get up and leave???

Jennifer greeted us with a big smile and a warm welcome.    We ordered or drinks and looked over the menu.   I asked what is considered a ""favorite"" dish.    She suggested the meatball or chicken Parm sandwhich, then she suggested so many other items my head was spinning and I really like meatball sandwhiches.    We call them Grinders or a ""grindah"" in Rhode Island.

My boyfriend wanted to start with cheddar cheese fries ($4.45), he wanted to try theirs Gyro ($6.95) and I went with a meatball sandwhich with cheese ($8.45).    If you add fries it's $10.90.   After dinner was fantastic I really wanted to try their homemade Tiramisu ($4.95), the lady fingers (the cookie in the middle) was soaked in rum, it was to die for.   Even tried a tiny bite of the cheesecake here and it too was great.  Only wished it was a slightly thicker slice for $4.95.

3167901,2015-09-02,2,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"My first time at Amore was far from a positive one. As suggested by several reviews, I called ahead to have a deep dish put in for us to dine in later. They told us it would take about 45 minutes to get done, which we expected, so we showed up about 30 minutes in to make sure we didn't get cold food. Well, we ended up getting a cold pizza anyway, and even worse, there was hair in it. When we told our waitress, she acted like there was no way it could have happened and made excuses. To be fair, they offered to make a new pizza, but I sure didn't want to wait there another 45 minutes, and I honestly don't know who would.

Before I found the hair, I still can't say I agree that the deep dish is the best out there. I definitely wouldn't recommend sitting in the place for 45 minutes to wait for it to come out either. Maybe it's because mine was cold and I didn't get the full effect, but I just wasn't a huge fan. There was very little flavor to it, the cheese not being hot and melty wasn't ideal, and the dough felt undercooked. As a whole, it just wasn't right and was really disappointing after hearing how great it's supposed to be.

About the only thing I enjoyed on my first visit were the appetizers we ordered. Both the Fried Ravioli and Bruschetta were simple but delicious, and I'd recommend trying either.

Against my better judgement, we came back here for a second time...more because it's one of the wifeys favorite spots. This time around, almost everything was much better. Our waitress was extremely nice, had our drinks refilled quickly, and it was overall just a much better experience. I couldn't bring myself to order another deep dish, so this time around I tried something new with the Sausage and Peppers Platter...

I'm actually really surprised to see this isn't talked about more in reviews. It's literally served on a platter with a pretty healthy portion of sausage, peppers, potatoes and onions. The sausage is a nice coarse ground Italian sausage that is cooked perfect, and has just the right amount of spice. Both the peppers and onions were nicely done with still a little bit of crispness and not soggy at all. But what really makes this dish even better is the white wine sauce it's made with. It's absolutely delicious, and everything really soaks in all the flavors from it. Even after I was stuffed from eating it all, I couldn't help but grabbing some of their basket bread and dipping it in the sauce...it really is that good!

Had I reviewed Amore the first time around, it definitely would have been a 1 star review. There really isn't much that I hate more than finding stuff in my food, and usually I wouldn't even go back after I do, especially if it's hair. But I gotta give credit where credits due. The Sausage and Peppers Platter alone is worth coming here for. And if we were to come back with someone who wanted a deep dish, I'd probably give it another shot. I just wouldn't order it again on my own, and with it being one of their signature items, that says a lot.

Overall though, Amore is ""A-OK""!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,6,6,3,1HQgVhTuODL_21P2IQ99yQ

If you really want something delicious though, you gotta get the deep dish pizza. It is delicoussssss!!!! The only down fall for me was I'm not a huge fan of pizza sauce being chunky and it is chunky and kinda sweet. That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. If you do order the deep dish pizza though call in advance because it takes about an hour to make. 

I have had the three sandwich lunch special mentioned previously. 

The italian sausage was good. Not my favorite out of the three. You can add hot peppers to it for fifty cents I believe and same with the beef sandwich. The beef sandwich gives you a good amount of roast beef on it which more the better in my opinion. 

The meat ball sub was good for an extra buck you can add cheese which is worth it because they give you a good amount. Plus it has, I believe, homemade meatballs on it. Pretty good stuff and the price is hard to beat. It's better than eating at a fast food place for the same price.

My biggest criticisms were the pizza was served to us warm, and the crust was hard. I hate to say it, but the crust ruined the pizza.

The pizza, which was supposed to come out in half an hour but took an hour, was just okay. It was mostly sauce. 

Towards the end our waitress became very snippy and nonexistent. Everyone has a bad day but she could have tried a bit harder. We didn't say anything and still tipped well. 

And to top it all off this meal cost $70. It definitely was not worth $70. 

Overall the place was mediocre. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there and we won't be trying it again. If you want a good Chicago style pizza try BJs. The price is fair and the pizza is awesome.",N0qbTzYbCmM8TC-PCqmEOg,0,0,2,_17lDOTt6RlQuLUX9zGzKQ

We are from Chicago as well.  The sauce on the pizza was so bland and had no flavor. The deep dish we had wasn't even edible, it was dry hardly any sauce and no flavor.  You will never find as good as  Lou Malnati's here but this place isn't even close.  Sorry Amore's but you lost our business after 10 years.  Ever since the head chef Enzo left and all the the staff changes including our favorite waitress Rosemarie not there anymore, the food went down hill too.  We went to Rosati's on Hulapai by Town Center and Wow it tasted just like Giordiano's.  Once you have their pizza you will never go back to Amore's.

Since this is a Chicago style pizza place that's what I ordered. The pizza was nasty- no evidence of actual marinara sauce, just big chunks or canned tomatoes.  The crust was so wet on the bottom I had to eat it with a fork. I ate one piece and my guy ate 2....the rest went to the dumpster as there was no way I'd eat it ever again. 
To make matters worse, or perhaps on par with the pizza experience, the delivery guy hands me a banged up can of soda we ordered and says ""I hope you weren't planning on drinking this anytime soon"" because he dropped it. wtf? Never again.",0-FIw5bOsuAGovo3KmMBCA,2,1,1,C5ZWCjlFnFnpCK8dkNcJTQ

Staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant. I thought the service was excellent. 

Pizza was true, Chicago style. Legit deep dish. We ordered homemade sausage and pepperoni and mushroom. The ingredients were all fresh. Loved that. Loaded with lots of fresh tomatoes on top too. My only complaint was the crust was a little undercooked in some places and I hate raw dough. I did think it lacked some salt in the sauce and maybe the toppings could have been a little more seasoned.

Ordered the Mediterranean salad and it was the worst part of the meal. Mostly containing the white hard parts of iceberg lettuce. You know, the stuff in the center you throw away!  The dressing was semi-sweet and bland. The whole thing tasted rubbery. Which led me to believe it was premade, dressed and stored in the fridge overnight.

The sandwich was huge. It had 3 large meatballs, a large serving of fries, and an extra side of the sauce. The bread had a great crunch to it in the typical french baguette style. The fries were cooked and salted well. The meatballs seemed under cooked
They weren't raw by any means but they could have benefited from cooking another few minutes. They seemed limp. I also wasn't crazy about the sauce. It seemed very watery.

It's not 9 and still nothing. In the mean time there have been three calls to grub hub and one directly to the restaurant. Each call promised a delivery time which wasn't met. They tried blaming a little drizzle for their driver not getting here the first time, then they were slammed, then some other nonsense .

Anyone can have a bad visit and should not form an opinion on one visit. I will qualify by saying I am from Chicago-land and grew up in our family pizzeria. As with all foods there are differences in flavor and how it is prepared. This however is not even close to me. The owner is from Bolingbrook Ill, a suburb of Chicago. I was told this from a waitress. it may be that it is a local flavor. The wait staff were not attentive at all and it was slow at the time. Maybe 3 other tables. The staff just kept hanging around the front counter talking and laughing with each other.

Now for the food, The first time I visited we had d deep dish that the dough was almost raw in the middle. Defiantly not cooked. The grease from the young, not aged cheese pooled on top. Not a good meal. Next couple times we tried the thin crust. Thin crust has always been my favorite and was what Chicago pizza was known for before the deep dish craze, A thin wafer crisp crust cut in squares. Missed on this too. The crust was limp and thick, The sauce both times tasted like it was just puree out of a can, no spices added. Just plain pastie. The crust tasted very heavy with yeast. So much so that it over powered the taste. I ordered The ribs to find the were a bit dry and tasted old. The BBQ sauce was bland and heavy with smoke flavor.

The crust was thicker than a typical NY style thin crust and was a little tough. Not chewy or crispy. I should have known better than to order a thin crust from a Chicago joint. I'm sure the deep dish would have been the better option. The pizzas weren't bad, there are just plenty of better spots for that style of pie.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,2,3,n3PsGTGYveYGRSD_bJkuCQ

Walking in we were greeted and taken to a table. The place was half full and had a good vibe. The walls are lined with memories of Chicago, celebrity pictures and yes, I even heard a songs by Chicago while eating LOL! There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.

After ordering a ""1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza"" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered ""Cheesy Garlic Bread"" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting! 

Now let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said. 

Out front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,28,23,3,n5WMFfEQGNzcP5zTNf12BA

The best thing about this place are the tomatoes and tomato sauce they use on the pizza and the bruschetta. It's PERFECT!

After reading mixed reviews by a few of my friends on Yelp and watching the ATC video with Rosemary and the rest of the staff, we decided to give ATC a shot and decide for ourselves. As we enter, Rosemary and another Bulgarian gentleman (didn't get his name) is there to greet us.

We mentioned that it was our first time there, and as she mentions in the video, they are known for their deep dish pizza, so our lunch was already decided. She also said that the 50-year old oven they use and the Pizza Maker came from Chicago. How Much more authentic can you get? We entrusted Rosemary who has been there over 5 years and is a local from Chicago as well, and went with her suggestions- no more than 5 toppings, and we went with what she suggested:
Suasage, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Garlic, and the MUST HAVE Hot Giardinera Peppers. Already knowing about the 45 minute wait, Rosemary Suggested the Fried Ravioli which was a great starter.Crisp outside, creamy Ricotta inside and a chiffonade of basil sprinkled on top, went very well with the warm marinara.

Our pizza arrives, and Rosemary serves up our first slices. First bite, flavor explosions in my mouth! The SWEET hand crushed tomatoes, creamy ricotta, meaty sausage, whole roasted garlic cloves, crispy pepperoni, and the mild heat of the giardinera all worked together in harmony with the crisp, buttery crust...this is the only way I'll have my stuffed pizza...Rosie's way!

The menu is extensive and appetizing......I couldn't make up my mind.  Good thing our server, Rosemary, helped us out.  She pointed out that they had a $4.95 lunch menu and that I should try one of those items.  I looked at the lunch menu and decided for that price I'd order 2 items!

I ordered the 1 Topping Thin Crust Personal Pizza w/Sausage ($4.95) and an Italian Beef Sandwich w/Fries ($4.95) with a side of Hot Giardiniera ($.50).

The food came out after a short wait.  I went for the Beef Sandwich first.....dipped it in a little Au Jus and added some Giardiniera.....after one bite, I WAS HOOKED!  This is some seriously good Chicago style Beef!  I'm sooo glad I ordered it!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA?select=AxzEEvoOb0DEaYNr8YaiVg
The Fries were pretty good....they're Crinkle Cut Fries and had the perfect amount of Salt added to it.

Next up was the Sausage Pizza.  I ordered it 'well done' because I prefer my Pizza that way.  They obliged and it came out perfectly!  The Crust was nice and crispy and the Sausage was AMAZING!  Another score!  It reminded me of Fox's Pizza in the Southside of Chicago when my friend took me there.  The size of the Pizza is pretty good too for $4.95!  I'd guess it's around a 10"" Pizza.  I was expecting something smaller....it exceeded my expectations.

Overall, it was an awesome lunch.....good food and good times!  Rosemary, our server, was amazing and friendly.  I love going to places like this where people actually care about their customers.

I can't wait to go back and try their Stuffed Pizza, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Hot Dog, and many many more things I saw on the menu!

While watching the UFC 196 fight night we decided to order a pizza and not just any pizza, forget about Domino`s, Pizza hut, etc. So we ordered from Poppa Joe (Amore Taste Chicago). It was a simple order a medium pie 1/2 cheese & 1/2 Canadian bacon, and garlic, simple right? I go to pick up the pie get home and open the box and see what appears to be a plain cheese pie.

I called back and told the young girl that I believe the wrong pie was given to me. She asked me to bring it back and she would make me another pie, ok I have to go back again and the main event of the fight is just starting, so I rush back to the restaurant to exchange the botched order. There in front of me is this young girl who takes the pie opens the box and say`s what`s the problem with the pizza, I simply asked where`s the Canadian bacon, she then grabbed a tooth pick and started to lift the cheese and literally found about 6-8 pieces of Canadian bacon and no garlic.

She then said that this is the right pie and stated to me that if I wanted to exchange it she would have to charge me. Needless to say I was at a loss for words and could not believe what I was hearing. I will not order another thing from this place after the experience that I had. I don`t know if Poppa Joe reads thes reviews or doesn't care but I have been going there sometime`s for lunch or ordering for pick up since 2008. This is sad because coming from Chicago I support my hometown people. It looks like Rosatti`s will get all of my future orders.

We got a deep dish pizza for dinner that was outstanding,  they cut the pepperoni double thick...which no one else does and the crust was delicious too. 

All the servers were really friendly and attentive. The place was packed but we got great service.

I took the suggestions from other yelpers and called in my order a head of time. The pizza wasn't ready after being seated so I ordered an appetizer of shrimp scampi - served with garlic bread. The shrimps were deveined, whole and yummy. When the pizza arrived I was taken back of the thickness and contained homemade sausage, mushrooms and the chunks of tomatoes that were sweet and delicious. The pizza was packed with quality ingredients and the dough was thick but not overly cooked. I ended picking off of three slices all the ingredients and passed on the ends of the crust. 

Overall a positive experience here with friendly waitresses who were service oriented! As for the pizza I'm torn between being fan of regular or deep dish. I guess if both were in front of me I would indulge in either or!",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,10,10,5,vL8upnzRnk6TILUJgKY7JA

Amores thin crust is excellent. 9/10 times we are very happy. Every once in a while the main cook must be sick because we end up with a pizza with a shitty, soggy flavorless crust. That does not happen often but when it does I want to cry. On Amore nights lunch is skipped in preparation and anticipation of that excellent pizza.

4154403,2013-11-20,1,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"I've eaten Amore Taste of Chicago pizza twice in the last month, due to a friend's recommendation. I would have to say that I was not disappointed based on the price and quality of food.

Upon walking in the ambiance is similar to a deli style experience you'd expect. Very basic tables with a ton of celebrity decor on the walls (some relating to Chicago, some relating to Las Vegas and some I have no idea about concering the relation). 

Nevertheless, the service was very prompt even for a lunchtime. We ordered the Fried Ravioli and a large deep dish Chicago Style pizza with pepperoni (which was about $20). However, please note that if you're very hungry order an appetizer as the deep dish pizza has a wait time of approximately 45 minutes. This fact is stated on the menu clearly which I appreciated. The fried ravioli was decent, not the best I've had - but not bad. It's also served with a small bowl of marinara sauce.

When the pizza came out, I understood why it took 45 minutes to cook. It was probably about 6 pounds of dough, cheese and meat. The crust was buttery and flaky, the cheese was very gooey and liberally dispensed, the sauce was definitely made from actual stewed tomatoes and had a good taste and the pepperoni was nice and crispy. This was a lot of food. I was only able to eat one piece of this pizza and was definitely full. I also shared this pizza with two human garbage disposals that I've witnessed eat an inordinate amount of food in one sitting and they could only consume two pieces of this beast before they threw in the towel. We left with a box containing 3 large pieces of pizza.

I would definitely recommend Amore Taste of Chicago for anyone looking for Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas. I'm sure Chicagoans would disagree with me for this (as would New Yorkers about a restaurant touting New York Style pizza in Las Vegas). But on the sliding scale of pizza places in Las Vegas, this one definitely comes out high in my opinion.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,3,2,4,oNeJPWsyP9ne3LXJtXxgNw
4155134,2017-01-17,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"Will not be ordering from here again which is kind of a shame because I was a regular at this place. Ordered Fried Ravioli, Bruschetta, and wings. The wings basically had no sauce on them and it was not apparent that the wings already came with ranch so I paid an extra dollar for 2 things of it I will not use. 

Did NOT like the girls whom were working today everything someone said they had some snarky remark to make back and the one girl was complaining she was going to be there till 10 at night.. at least you have a job I know it can be frustrating at times but get over yourself. I waited 20 mins at home and an additional 10 at the restaurant for my food to be ready there was literally 3 people in there. 

The cherry on top was I came home to realize I had not gotten the Bruschetta which is my favorite thing they offered. I called which I shouldn't have had to they had my name and phone # when I placed the order through Yelp so you'd think they'd call to be like hey we forgot to give you your Bruschetta but nope guess whining takes precedence over doing ones job. 

She told me I could come back and get it but they couldn't offer a refund because I made the order through a 3rd party service. Okay well I can't leave my job a second time to come back so maybe you should offer to deliver it or perhaps you make the call to refund me my money since it was due to your incompetence.

Anyway, we got there right when it opened, she had to unlock the door for us. She offered us to sit anywhere we like and I chose the window side with the Planet Hollywood table. (Each table has a different photo of the Las Vegas strip... It's thuper cute!) I love the decor inside, different sports memories plastered on the walls. 

She got our drinks quickly, took our order and the food came out shortly after that. It's important when you only have an hour for lunch. My coworkers each had a sandwich and I chose the stuffed shells.(sadly I was so hungry I didn't get a picture :) There were 4 decent sized shells covered in sauce and LOTS of melted cheese. It also came with a side of bread which was slightly crunchy on the outside and thuper soft on the inside. ---very important! I woofed down 3 shells and most of my bread in a matter of minutes. That means it was delicious and no, nobody was trying to take my food away.

4185157,2013-06-19,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"I had high expectations . . . and maybe that steered me wrong, but this place didn't knock me off my feet.  It was fine, the most impressive part being the walls filled with Chicago greats and not having to wait for a table at 2:30 PM on a Sunday.  OH and there are several good sized, good quality TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  Which was nice since the US Open was on.  

We started with the house salad -- it's not an antipasto or a great house salad at that -- it's ICEBERG lettuce, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes.  Their house Italian is more of a balsamic which I really didn't mind, but the salad was less than impressive.  I am not an iceberg lettuce fan, but luckily my husband is and he finished it off.  

Their tomato sauce is a little on the tangy side, which is fine.  My daughter wasn't crazy about it, but I do realize tomato sauce is a personal preference kind of thing.  She ordered the spaghetti and meatball (one big meatball) and was satisfied.  She also ordered garlic bread which was waaaay garlickly - I know, I know, it's supposed to be, but my husband and I could still taste the garlic in our teeth two hours later!!  

The pizza . . . . they told us it'd be 45 minutes, but it was actually 25.  Bonus!  Maybe it's because we ordred the homemade sausage, pepperoni and green pepper and didn't stuff it full?  It was good - it wasn't great, not quite like thick, oozing goodness of Lou Malnati's or Pizzeria Due in Downtown Chicago, but it was still delicious.  The crust wasn't too thick or too doughy which in my book, is a good thing.  If I ever crave deep dish, I would probably, maybe return, but I wouldn't make a special trip to do so.  A note on size, the small is 8 pieces and was more than enough for 2 adults.

The other bummer was . . . . no beer?  No wine?  Beer and pizza make a great meal  in my book!  I was disappointed, truly.",evS0cCehNU_EiDiD3286Jw,1,0,2,fMX9yb37bAi0FMvxh3iDzA

The sausage was alright. The amount of fries they give you for $2.00 is not worth it.

I don't know if they were understaffed but the service was adequate. Took awhile just to get our drink order taken. And over 20 min to get 4 sandwiches served to our table. And I did not hear the waitress ask us how our food was.

First, their sauce is overly sweet, it has been obviously and emphatically juiced with sugar.... Second, the crust is under-developed, and too crispy (like having a 1/2"" cracker on bottom)... Lastly, the butter or butter-like grease they use for the release agent on the pan is overpowering and left me feeling like I just ate a tub of movie popcorn.

There were 8 people in our party and we ordered a deep dish with meatball & ricotta and a thin crust with sausage & pepperoni. Everything was fantastic. I felt like all of the ingredients were really fresh, perfectly proportioned, and both crusts were outstanding.

Our server, Autumn, was running around the dining room & our table still never felt neglected. She was awesome!

Salads and cannoli were great, too!

I am not a sports fan, but there are huge TVs around so you can catch the game no matter where you are sitting.

4623702,2013-12-19,2,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"I fell in love with Chicago style deep dish pizza when I was visiting the windy city this past summer. Since then, I have been on a quest to find something comparable here in Vegas. I figure you can find just about any type of cuisine here in Vegas, but a Chicago style pizza seemed pretty hard to come by.

I'm happy my fellow yelpers mentioned Amore! There's a reason this place was packed just a  day after thanksgiving when most people are still trying to figure out creative ways to use turkey in casseroles, salads, volatil cocktails... ANYTHING just so that they can get rid of all that extra bird.

Instead, Amore was just the kind of ""love"" i needed after being slaving over a  hot  Thanksgiving  stove. The moment you walk in to this restaurant, it  feels like family, and everyone is so friendly and welcoming.  

Situated in an unassuming strip mall next to a PT's pub, the scent of quality Italian cooking wafts throughout the quaint,  casual.restaurant.

The Chicago style deep dish i ordered did not disappoint. The sauce was thick and hearty with chunks of tomato and a flavor like no other. I had it customized for me with no complaints from the server.

I'm giving this place 5 stars only because the owner promised that he'd be bringing back beer and wine to this establishment. That would make this place absolutely ideal because nothing goes better with pizza than a good beer to wash  it down.

It might be time for them to expand even further. Vegas can do without a PTs if it means there will be more room for me to  eat awesome Chicago style pizza and authentic Italian food at a great price.

 definitely check this place out!  It's worth the trip.",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,4,4,5,3ypCGsKJqMNwYBYOOw_Vqw
4633081,2015-10-17,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"Excellent Chicago style deep dish, this far into the Southwest.

We were visiting Las Vegas as a birthday trip for my husband, who spent a lot of his formative years in Chicago, eating at the original Due's.  The only thing close we can get in our little corner of Arizona is the pizza we make at home.  And I haven't perfected the crust yet.

The pictures in Yelp looked right (sauce on top, depth of crust, etc) so we decided to give it a try despite some mixed reviews on service.

We ordered via GrubHub, because that's actually what the Amore website recommended.  Staying at the MGM grand, pretty far from the restaurant, they delivered for a reasonable fee and got the order perfectly right.  

We included our floor and room number, and the delivery guy arrived promptly (well, the deep dish takes 45 mins to make so he arrived when expected, with delivery time after that).  He brought the pizza directly to our room without any delays calling or trying to find us.

Our only small complaint is that they did not bring any forks or plates and it was a little hard to eat without them.  Grubhub actually has a spot to select NOT bringing those things, so we didn't think to request them.

All in all, the pepperoni and in-house sausage was excellent.  The sausage definitely tasted premium, and you could believe it was homemade.   The crust was buttery and well-cooked, but was a little harder at the edges than we'd like by the time we sat down to eat.  I'm sure it would have been better eating in the restaurant, but I think that's always true of delivery.

 I got the cannoli because, as an Italian American, I miss them.  We don't get them in the southwest made the ""right way"" very often.  And this was definitely excellent homemade cannoli.  The only ones I've gotten recently have been previously frozen, and the pastry is not as crisp and delicate as the ones Amore makes.  This was the perfect pastry, the filling was not too sweet, and the dusting of powdered sugar perfectly tied the two together.

I'm impressed.  I didn't have nearly the trouble with service as some other reviewers, in fact I actually called the restaurant to ask what the most efficient way to get the pizza from the delivery guy would be (if he wanted me to come down to the lobby, i would have) and the nice girl who answered assured me with the room number I provided, he'd find me.  I was skeptical, I mean after all the lukewarm reviews, was he really going to find my room?  He did.  he didn't need to call, he was quick and courteous... and we were able to dig in.",LJplPzQ5CKyMJpBOVyThZg,0,1,5,x7HhMQDxCV3mb90vMxd29g

We have been customers since you opened and this review is for the OWNERS INFORMATION.A Co-worker gave my husband a $25 GIft Certificate and last night after a very busy day, we decided to use it. I called and ordered our usual to be delivered. The order taker did not identify herself and right away,I knew she was a newbie as she did not follow the standard protocol that you use for ordering. She asked card or cash and I said GC and cash. She said okay and gave me the total. Thirty minutes later it was at our door and I paid GC and cash as I HAVE DONE MANY TIMES BEFORE. We were just opening the order when the driver knocked on our door and said we don't take GC for delivery. Since when? Not his fault, so luckily, I had $25 in cash and gave it to the driver. What if I didn't have $25 in cash? Does the driver have a CC machine in his car? 
Since this has never happened, I called and asked to speak to the manager. Someone got on the phone, also not identifying herself and went into this long story about the order taker being new and not knowing about GC and that when the manager heard her say GC, she immediately told her to call us back and tell us they couldn't take the GC. I replied we never received that call. The manager says, she must have called the wrong number! Hmmmmmm, if that is the case, why send out the order right away? She told me that it has always been the policy to only take GC dine in. No where on the GC or Menu is that stated. She kept saying she was sorry, not very convincingly, but offered no solution or anything to make a long time customer smile.
She just wanted me off the phone. She said she would inform the owner, as I doubt that, that is the reason for the review. I have 35 years of experience in Customer Service in Retail and Food service. The manager needs extensive training on how to handle a complaint. I was easy, as I have been in her place, I never raised my voice or used inappropriate language. She did not listen to me or offer a solution.

Tonight we had my boyfriend's children in town-- 3 teens (feel sorry for me please). Anyhow, we decide to give this place another shot because everybody wanted Italian and this seemed like a simple order.

we ordered:

1 Eggplant dinner
1 House Salad
1 Deep Dish Pizza with half cheese/ half meatball and sausage
1 Caprese Salad
1 Lasagna

Total was just over $70... plus $8 for delivery and taxes.

We placed the order... then got a confirmation from the restaurant they'd received the order and were preparing it. Not so much... at 8:20pm when the order still hadn't arrived, we reached out to Grubhub which told us the restaurant had a power outage... never received the order and they weren't making or delivering it....   Even though they CONFIRMED the order!!!

If there was a power outage, then how did they confirm the order?! I have no idea what the deal is, but I was willing to give this mediocre pizza joint another chance-- and totally got burned on a $70 order, with an $8 delivery fee, plus tip. My boyfriend and I will be eating turkey sandwiches tonight and the kids will be having cereal and White Castle microwaveable sliders.... as a late dinner. NOT how we intended our take-out night dinner to say the least.

We will NOT be ordering from here again. The fact they confirmed the order, and couldn't bother themselves to call us or grubhub to let us know it wasn't on the way, or even being cooked is EVERYTHING we need to know about this restaurant.",mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,2,1,1,QZEvTnoWYCMoPWLVnUOyUg

Okay not better than Lou Malnati's, but considering we're almost 2000 miles away from Chicago and Lou's and I'm comparing it to Lou Malnatis and it has more stars than 0....There you go. 

There's butter in the crust, which is just the perfect thickness; crisp but not crunchy, soft inside but not soggy...tangy tomato sauce, cheese on the bottom, loaded with toppings. How do you know it's Chicago Style? You can pull a slice out with a pie slicer, and the crust is firm, and the inside stays all in one piece, with little dangly mozzer-elactites. Like a blueberry pie...made of meat. 

These are not just people claiming ""yeah it's a heavy crust so we call it 'Chicago Style'  and hope no one notices."" This is not a wet gooey mess of sauce and toppings on bread. This is actually Chicago style deep dish, at it's best. Better than Giordannos in Chicago proper, if you ask me.

In Chicago, I'd give it 4 stars, since it's not Lou Malnatti's. Here? Oh heck yeah it gets 5 stars here.

Pros:
- Name of Restaurant Not a Dirty Filthy Lie. This is what Actual Chicago Style Pizza tastes like.
- Good food, good prices
- They deliver, and it's fast for chicago style. (allow 45 minutes for cook time)

Cons;
- Allow 45 minutes for cook time.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,6,2,5,gQJEDawK3t-on72S3SfL-A

We were gravitating towards a white pizza, but the lady helping us sold us on how good the deep dish is that we decided we can wait the 45 minutes for one (if you know that's what you want- call it in and drive on over there so you're not sitting there forever) , talk and nosh on a app.

 She told us about different specials not on the menu so we took up the special large deepdish with 2 toppings at $15 and some change instead of it's normal price (I believe about $22). We got ours with spinach and beef....think of it like a pizza lasagna!  If your server doesn't tell you ask specials- ask because she named off a few. 

The BF was feeling the fried zucchini ($6.95) for our app and I like that it was thin slices so you get a lot of crumb crust. I normally dip in ranch, but that marinara was off the hook so fo'getta abou' ranch! Our server brought us hot bread and though I love me some balsamic and oil, I sopped the rest of the marinara up. 

Once it came, I was so hungry, yet I only ate 1 and 1/4 a slice. It hits like a brick! The crust is consistently crunchy throughout and the fillings are all quality. 

We heard our lady chatting with the table behind me and they were talking about Chicago and where they grew up to see if they were neighbors or something so you know that they're definitely legit people here too. She was very sweet, checked on us often and we never had to ask for a drink refill.

I'm not much for a pizza person, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely I think if I have a hankering for pizza again, I'll keep this place on the short list!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,5,4,Vp18CfhJ38UpmHsZkOLTzg

Customer service is personable. A huge plus in my book. 

I LOVE the decor here. It definitely gives it that authentic Chicago feel.

TIP: If you're getting a deep dish, get it loaded with toppings. 1-2 toppings doesn't do it justice.

We had to make it before Lou Malnati's closed. So, yes, I have lusted for deep dish. More recently, I have started to doubt the nutritional smarts of consuming an inch of cheese sitting on top of a buttery crust, but I know it can still be a delicious treat. And, Amore's is indeed just that. 

I can't say it is as perfect as Lou's - the sauce borders on too sweet, and the crust doesn't have the perfect buttery crisp chewiness; it is more doughy. However, the overall effect is still a delight to consume. We ordered garlic and sausage, and when mixed with the cheese and fresh, sweet tomato sauce, it was a nice little (or rather deep) symphony of flavors. It also reheats very well. (We made the mistake we always make of ordered a medium, when truly a small will do for 2.)

It definitely takes 45-minutes for them to prepare, so don't come for a quick bite. While waiting we noshed on the fried zucchini, and it too was a nice indulgence. Service was efficient despite their being some sort of restaurant drama unfolding. I loved the fact that Rosie told us straight up, ""Don't get tomatoes,"" when we first suggested that was one of the toppings we wanted. I appreciate honesty in service. It makes for a better meal.

On Friday I used my birthday week (yes I said week, LOL) as a caloric excuse and finally made it out to try the best stuffed pizza in our fair city ! 

Having read Yelp and with a certain degree of familiarity with Chicago style pizzas, I knew to call ahead to make sure I could squeeze Amore into my lunch break and still get in and out of there in under an hour. The lunch specials for $5 looked good, but I had to try the stuffed pie to see if this place lived up to my favorite spots in Chicago. Their large with 2 toppings for $15.99 was well priced (on special?), and was ready within the promised 45 minutes. 

I'll start with the service - it was fabulous. Our waitress couldn't have been more nice or helpful. The pie was beautiful and looked like the pies I remember in Chicago. Ok, I'll be blunt. This pie was by far the best I've had in Vegas (as far as Chicago stuffed styles go), but definitely isn't ""just like Chicago"". It's like Steve said - it's a nicotine patch equivalent for Chicago pizza addicts. 

For me, the sauce was way too sweet but I realize that's personal preference. The crust while ""bland"" was very true to the style and for me extremely reminiscent of Giordano's . The cheese was extremely gooey and perfect and they didn't skimp on the quantity at all! The toppings were a bit skimpy for my taste (I'd like to see a bit more of them!), but otherwise it was a great pizza.  

While this wouldn't be a 5 star joint in Chicago, we are in Vegas after all!  This is the closest most authentic Chicago stuffed style here in town and i look forward to adding this my lunch rotation every once in awhile.

Thin Crust - Half Cheese, Half Pepperoni
Deep Dish - Sausage and Mushroom
Cannoli

Said by some to be the best Chicago Style Pizzeria in Sin City, or perhaps just the one most decked-out in Windy City swag, it was for lunch on Saturday that a party of three stopped in to Amore Taste of Chicago and inhabiting a table in front of a mural of the 2013 Blackhawks a 'taste' of two pizzas plus a pair of Cannolis was fine, if not memorable - certainly not a spot worth going out of the way for unless one is completely inexperienced or overly curious to verify whether the rumors are true.

More sizable than one would gather from the exterior and brighter than many places of its ilk as a result of large windows exposed to the strip-mall parking lot out front, it was to an empty dining room that we arrived as doors clicked open and remaining that way throughout the duration of our 60 minute stay the service was expectedly attentive, pies requested to be delivered as completed with thin crust presented after a mere ten minute wait.

Admittedly benefited by a Midwestern upbringing, not to mention a sister who lives minutes from Wicker Park, suffice it to say that the circle cut into rectangles was far less novel to me than it may be to others while tomato sauce seemingly straight from a can did little to improve rather flavorless crust, the mozzarella not particularly impressive either while Pepperoni was the typical oily store-bought stuff.

Not really expecting much from the deep-dish considering the overall quality of the traditional pie it was with a medium-thick version removed from the pan and served atop cardboard that the meal progressed, the same ingredient quality generally marring crust that would have been better off with more butter left to caramelize though the sausage and mushrooms were a touch more successful than pepperoni  as toppings, each cannoli perfectly serviceable with a shattering shell filled to order, though  far from the best available in town.

**Generally not the sort to assume that Las Vegas should meet or exceed the quality of signature dishes from cities a thousand or so miles away, Amore Taste of Chicago simply is not as good as any of the classics offered within the confines of The Second City, a more substantial search necessary to see if it is even the best in the (702.)",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,4,2,IEg0A9spuFgzxTu5tccqCQ

5322955,2014-06-15,7,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"My family loves Italian food, loves it SO much that I rarely eat out at Italian spots because I've had a lifetime's fill of it (and the hips to prove it). So, when the family decided it was time to go out to eat, the majority voted for Italian and I let out a ""BOO!"" accompied with a pouty-face. 

When Olive Garden was suggested, I quickly re-routed the decision and we landed at ATC. It was a busy parking lot and my grandmother is O2 dependent and uses a walker. Since the place has huge windows, the manager saw this and opened a side door for us. This set the tone for the wonderful service we would receive throughout the night.

We were seated right away, a waitress came over, took our drink order and handed us menus. The menu is extensive. Tons of pasta dishes, soups, salads, sandwiches, meats, pizzas, and house specialities. Pizzas take about 40 minutes to make so we passed. There is also a separate pizza counter for people placing to-go orders or who opted for pick up.

Drinks came out with the quickness as well as the perfect crusty homemade italian bread. Freshly baked, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. We each ordered a cup of the soup (minestrone) and needed a bit longer to peruse the menu. 

Minestrone was great. A lot veggies, homemade, and it had a little, tiny kick to it. Bravo! Never tasted a soup like this before.

I've recently broken up with gluten. So I was stoked to see gluten free pasta available. I ordered gluten-free pasta and asked for a spicy arrabiata. It was awesome garlicky, flavorful, and packed heat.

Other dishes were sausage and peppers, with smacks of gardeny fresh peppers, mild Italian sausage and excellently balanced sauce. The baked rigatoni was also excellent and came with a massive amount mozzarella cheese. So heavenly sinful! (Did I just make an oxymoron, uh...) 

Our servers worked in a team effort, drinks were full, we never left wanting or waiting. The owner stopped by our table to see how everything was and told us about his establishment. I'm always way impressed when I see a hands on approach.

I love that there is a quality, decently priced, casual Italian place in my next of the woods. When I am feeling some sort of self-hate, I'm going to get all up in that deep dish. I think we'll be instant besties (damn you, gluten).

It took an extreme exercise in control for us not to head in even when our intention was to get some deep dish pizza.

With that being said, we went in, grabbed a seat, and ordered drinks, fried zucchini as an appetizer, and awaited our food. Decor was a splattering of Chicago sports teams and celebrities. Tables were spaced nicely so different parties didn't intrude upon one another's conversation. The fried zucchini was yummy. We saw other people being served before us who had arrived after, and after about 40 minutes, finally inquired with our waitress why that was. She explained deep dish took longer (we should have known, but it was our first time and would have been nice for her to ask and advise so we weren't getting frustrated). 

In another couple of minutes, our pizza was out, and my, was it worth the wait. (Although, we'll probably call ahead to avoid the wait). We ordered it with pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno.

5390575,2017-11-17,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"I am reviewing from my experience from a couple months ago. We were turned off from the get go. There were a few young girls in the front working. 2 girls were bickering at each other in the front. One girl was being so rude to the other employees. We placed a to-go order. We ordered a pepperoni deep dish pizza & wings. While waiting for our wings, one of the girl employees asked another girl (same rude one), ""Are our wings here even good? I haven't tried them..."" The other girl looked at her & nodded her head gesturing no....or even hell no. Just an expression of disgust on her face. It was loud, so I spoke up & mentioned how that sucks they're that nasty cause we just ordered like 20 of them. She rudely said, ""Well I don't like them..."" The other girl tried to cover up for her & said her dad loves them. The wings ended up being ""ok"". The pizza was soaked in tomato sauce to the point the crust tasted like thick raw dough. 

Honestly, I just could not get over how bad that girl's attitude was. If you guys are going to hire young girls, you should make sure they are compatible & that none have a nasty attitude. Definitely make sure she does not bash on your food loudly in front of customers! Either she hates her job or was having a very bad day. Regardless, she shouldn't have been acting out like that & making it obvious. I usually don't care & shrug off bad customer service...but this one actually pissed me off. She had an attitude with employees & us. Even if the other girls were nice, I just felt SO annoyed by the experience. I'm sure it played a role in our opinion of the food...I'm surprised I didn't review earlier.

I'll never understand someone's reasoning for taking a circular pizza and cutting it into squares... square pizza, square slices I get. I know they do it in Chicago, been there done that, and it didn't make sense then either.
The pizza was good and I did like the sauce which is a little on the sweet side. The ricotta was quite good, no up charge!, and the mushrooms hit the spot but there just wasn't enough of them.
All in all we thought it was a pretty good pizza but when their website says a large is for 3-4 people they must not be talking about anybody who's hungry, we devoured it in no time. Not a bad spot for pizza but Ciao Ciao is less than a block away and for us it's more in line with what we like.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,2,2,3,2CuSNZ-OM4e7rF3h7SsUEw

I ordered the eggplant parmesan, which comes with a side of spaghetti, and ordered garlic bread as well.

I've always said that if I were on death row, my mom's eggplant parmesan is the last meal I'd want, and this dish reminded me why.  Nicely seasoned, not mushy or undercooked, and very good sauce.  You know that if the sauce is bad, everything is bad! They did a great job.  The pasta was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but again, yummy sauce!  The garlic bread was buttery and nicely seasoned with garlic.  

I would definitely order from here again. I'd like to try their pizza.

It is not fancy, simple tables with comfortable red chairs for seating. It is kinda like cafeteria style seating but the food servers do take your order from the table. By the time we left, the whole place was almost full. 

They specialize in deep dish Chicago style pizza of course but we were in the mood for an entree. I ordered the Gnocchi and my friend had the Chicken Marsala with a side of pasta. We shared a salad with creamy garlic dressing and some garlic cheese bread. One of the standouts for me was the complimentary bruschetta. It is homemade and made fresh everyday. It was so delicious, most likely the best I have ever had. We had a little side on our salad. My friends Chicken Marsala was so tasty. I only had a small bite but the sauce was made just right, not too sweet and the chicken was tender. I enjoyed the Gnocchi but have had better. The creamy garlic dressing on the salad was delectable! We had no alcoholic beverages but they do offer a small menu of both beer and wine.

Ultimately, it's 3.5 on the food, but I think the prices are a bit much considering the product. So, on that basis, I am dropping them down to 3. It's certainly far from the worst pizza place around, and you can have a satisfactory meal there.

EDIT: Having had an allergic reaction, I believe it is likely that their pizza crust and/or their ravioli have thiamine mononitrate, which is a sign that they are not using fresh or high-quality ingredients.

We ordered from this place on a Saturday night. 1. The white pizza{we added sausage}
was good a little greasy but it was decent.
Ordered the 2.Gyro no grilled onions and no tomatoes but I ordered raw onions. 
3. Sampler appetizer {will never order that again} 4. Chicken parmesan 
{The noodle and sauce was in separate container}. The pizza and Gyro we knew we was going to order it again and we did on Tuesday. The Pizza the same but this time I took a napkin and dabble some of the oil off it. We ordered the caprese salad will not order that again.The Gyro I ordered it the same as the 1st time. I did Not get any raw onions. So I called and the Manager said she can give me a credit of a $1..
WTF!!! OR I could bring the Gyro up there and they can fix it. I told her we just paid a delivery charge and tipped the driver what part of I CAN NOT DRIVE and WE DO DELIVERY ALL THE TIME did she not hear.
She said that is the only option I had.
I reminded her that I waited tables for 30 yrs on the east coast{My Career} I know customer service and common courtesy. Common sense we ordered on Saturday and we are ordering again on Tuesday{REPEAT CUSTOMERS} The Mgr was arguing with me over the phone how lame is that? I even said to her that they can come get it because I can not eat it without the raw onions. I even paid extra for the taziki and on the pizza add sausage. You are arguing to not give me a credit of $6.95 because YOU screwed up.
The Chicken parmesan, Sampler appetizer 
and the Caprese salad NASTY but that did not stop us from ordering the Pizza, Gyro.

Fried Calamari with Orange Chili Sauce had a noticeable expected kick to it, served with very good Marinara Sauce.  Also very good were crumbly slices of complimentary bread.  

At last it was time for the piece de resistance: a medium Chicago Deep Dish Pizza with tangy Pepperoni, small Mushrooms, and Sausage.  This was a true Pizza Pie: cheesy, saucy, and doughy in the Chicago style.

At dinner's end I was overcharged 50 cents too much on a cup of soup with any pizza order.  When I raised the issue, our waitress blithely told me that the price had been raised from $1.00 to $1.50, and I must have been given an old menu.  She pointed out that the menu I received reads, ""Price is subject to change without notice.""  A nice convenient out!  But I chose not to quibble over 50 cents.

The sausage itself was very good as was the au jus but the ""sweet"" peppers weren't really that great or sweet. I'm pretty amazed that this place doesn't have a Chicago dog or any hot dogs for that matter. Can't really call yourself a Chicago eatery without having Chicago dogs. Minus one star for that.

Once inside you're greeting by a bright, glossy, red vinyl expanse with numerous, large pictures of Chicago icons on the walls.  Frankly, I thought it was a little tacky, but it was kitschy.

Now the important stuff: The food.

Ho-Lee-Crap!  That was the best Italian Beef Sandwich that I've had outside of Chicago.  The pickled peppers/veggies were the real deal.  

OMG, OMG.....I don't care that the place is in a weird strip, mall, I don't care that there is a ridonkulous amount of red vinyl.  I would fly to Vegas just to eat here again. 

P.S.

5894580,2011-04-19,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"Let a real Chicagoan review this deep dish pizza! This is all I have had so far was a deep dish cheese pizza for $18 excluding delivery fee. It was an hour and a half wait but they told me that right from the get-go so that is okay. They took my credit card info without even telling me how much my total was first, which I found odd. This deep dish is no more than extra thick crust! The only thing deep about it was the crust. Had the same amount of cheese as a regular thin crust. I hope you like really sweet sauce because this is how it is.The crust was also overly dense and on the hard side. I called and wanted to 'exchange' one of the deep dishes for a regular thin crust. No-one wanted to eat it, not even my 3 & 4 year old.  I am not one to send food back but I just couldn't justify spending $42 (with tip)  on a pizzas that I felt sucked. The woman on the phone was not too overly friendly and as a matter of fact said ""That is just how our pizza is, I seen it come out of the oven."" To me that is just bad customer service. In the end after a 10 min hold time I was informed that the manager was sending out a thin crust in exchange for the uneaten deep dish.  The one star rating is more for the pizza itself. I guess I would rate the customer service at more like a 2 since they did exchange my pizza with little hassle, although it was another 1.5 hour wait! The thin crust was much better but I wont order again since the sauce is way to sweet for me.",We6eIrvMpUBsBFBoNk08HA,2,0,1,sVWp33KzL0hjC08A9NgLdg

I came in here after hanging with some friends and I immediately fell in love with everything. The stuffed pizza is layers and layers of deliciousness. The slices are so big you might need you might need a partner to help you lift them. 

What I will say that makes this place stand apart is that it's more than just a pizzeria. They have a whole menu of entrees. I got to try the stuffed shells and the chicken. I heard the calamari was pretty good but I was entirely too stuffed. The food was just too good and I can't say no when bruschetta is put in front of me. 
Another thing I will say I liked was the vibe. All the girls I interacted with were super nice. The service was on point, no too overbearing but made sure I was taken care of. One thing I super appreciated was that one of the servers, Kiana, remembered me and treated me like a regular who comes here daily even though I haven't been here many times. Things like that make a difference

5928994,2011-03-26,0,8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA,"One day I found a menu for this place stuck in our front door. Ever since then, we have ordered delivery a few times. Delivery is usually pretty quick. They always tell me that the wait time will be 45 minutes, but it ends up being about 25-30 minutes. The one thing that annoys me about the employees who take the phone orders is that they never tell me what my total is before asking for my payment. Seriously! I give them my order. Then they ask, ""How will you be paying? Cash or Credit Card?"" I ALWAYS have to ask them, ""Uh, what is my total?"" I mean that is common sense, right? They should always tell their customers what their total is BEFORE asking for payment!!

I haven't tried too many items on their menu, but this is what I like so far:

-BBQ Baby Back Ribs: I have definitely had better, but these ribs were still pretty good. I usually get this if I am really hungry since it also comes with beans, fries and cornbread. 

-Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza: full of flavor and very filling for a thin crust pizza.

-Deep Dish Pizza (with Pepperoni, Sausage and Olives): Our party ordered this earlier this week and it was the first time I had actually dined in the restaurant. I rarely eat Deep Dish Pizza, but this was pretty good and made me full very fast! They cut the slices so big that I was full after eating just one slice!

What I didn't like:

-Homemade Fried Mozzarella: not sure how to explain this one. I guess I was expecting it to taste like the Mozzarella Sticks you would normally order from other restaurants, but it tasted funny.

-All the Pasta dishes I have tried: maybe it was because I ordered it for delivery or on bad days. Their cream sauce for the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was too thick and lacked taste. I also felt that their marinara sauce was a bit too sweet.
