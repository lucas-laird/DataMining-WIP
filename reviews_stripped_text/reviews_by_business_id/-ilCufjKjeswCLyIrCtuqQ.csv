Tacos were decent, although after a few $2 tequila shots and pints which are also 2 bucks, they're pretty bomb. I asked the bartender what kind of tequila it was, they had no clue! However, service was fast and efficient but not very friendly.

Overall, I'd give this place 3-stars for people on a budget and 2-stars who aren't",75aWJEnty5DLkDT61wsRdA,0,0,3,wrzhiMIPTFVua_EAbgaZUA

It seems like in most casinos, there is one all night cafe with diner type food and bars with munchies. The nice restaurants are always closed in the middle of the night. Well, that night, we didn't feel like diner grub and didn't want to go to another hotel, so we settled on munchies at Tequila Bar and Grill. 

Average, syrupy frozen margaritas. Lousy food that tasted like frozen Costco appetizers thrown in a fryer. The only bad meal I've ever had on the Las Vegas Strip.",GKQgCULAuiVur--lP_0tkQ,0,0,2,waB7nboN9vh0ngVRMgxK-g

Awesome $2 Tacos... Cheap prices drinks/shots... Awesome bartenders... Try to go when H.L. Is working... He makes the experience all the better, best bartender we experienced our while trip, and that's saying a lot. 

The food is flavorful, drinks are cold, an the bathroom is not far away! :-) 
Our chips were warm and fresh, Tacos flavorful.. (I got beef and chicken) 

If you go and plan on drinking (I hope you do!) please try the infusion tequila... It may seem A bit pricey at $7...but what you don't know is that it comes with a plate of cut up fruit that has been soaking in tequila... The shot itself has absorbed all of the fruit juices... So it honestly tastes like candy... With no tequila burn... The fruit... The fruit... Is where it gets fun... It has absorbed all if the tequila burn and flavor, so each piece is like it's own shot... And you will feel it after a few minutes... Super fun experience! 

We went two times and each time spent hours eating and drinking... And both times are bill was less than 40 bucks... And that's with the $7 shots... What I'm saying is... U can have a GREAT time for under 20 bucks! 

To end the review... Please so not walk by Bally's and not go here... And please seek out the great and wise H.L.... He will take care if you!!! (make sure and tell him his new Minnesota friends actually put a review on Yelp!!)",9WCqKnxVM_dFMSC29Rq8HQ,5,3,5,uJIWHFbkAii2CV9ujAxiHg

Second time I came was around 5AM and ordered a chicken quesadilla and onion rings to-go. The order took about 35 minutes to make.

NOTE:  My review only covers the all day $2.00 specials for the Tacos, Margaritas, Modelo Drafts and Tequila Shots

This place can be full and very busy depending on time of day, etc.  I always have a few of the $2.00 tacos, which come either in Chicken or Beef with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and cheese.

The $2 margaritas can be sweet, and the $2 Modelo's can go down pretty fast.  

The service can be up or down depending on if it is busy or not, I've tended to visit here mid afternoon.

For us twentysomethings trying to save money during our trip to Vegas (Clearly. We were staying in Bally's after all. No offense to anyone who loves the place, but there are more luxurious options on the Strip), we became fans of Tequilla Bar and Grill. Really, anyone who wants more gambling money can save on the food expense by going here. 

The dollar tacos lured us in. Four was a good amount. The waitress told us she preferred the beef over chicken - you get a choice - because of better seasoning. I tried both and agree. Tacos are topped with lettuce and cheese, with sour cream and guac. Not bad for $1. Small margaritas are also $1. What brought us back in the second  time was the menu item that I called giant nachos. See picture to understand. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The third time, we indulged in the fishbowl drink. Not pictured, but you can imagine. Comes with straws for as many amigos as you brought, says the menu.  

Overall Tequilla Bar and Grill doesn't seem completely organized in how it operates (seat yourself, slow service), but the waitstaff was charming enough.

We started with drinks, which were made just fine...nothing to write home about, but no solid complaints either.  Actually, one thing that bugged me was that the margaritas were served in plastic cups rather than margarita glasses or even regular cocktail glasses.  For an establishment located on The Strip, I kind of expect more.

For food, two of us took part in the two dollar taco special while myself and another of our group split the Queso Fundido and an order of the chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders were very good.  Not too meaty and not too breaded, served with either barbecue sauce or ranch dressing.  The Queso Fundido, however, wasn't that good.  The flavor was all there, but the consistency was gritty, almost like the cheese either went bad or hadn't been melted properly.  We didn't finish that dish because of that very reason.

I think the only other reason why this restaurant isn't getting more than three stars is the service.  It was lacking.  Our waitress barely came to check on us, so we'd ask a passing server for something and she'd make a big announcement about how she had to find our server first.

Sure, you're going to pay full price, but they make it worth it.  Especially delectable is the carne asada plate.  Marinated just right, slathered with chimichuri and cheese, it is among the best out there.  The carne asada sits atop a savory plate of black beans, lime seasoned rice and sweet plantains.

First, it's in Bally's. Poor, old, Bally's. It smells like baby powder and smoke and is a nightmare to walk through. This place is hidden just off the casino floor and across from the first (?) gay dance club on the strip (kudos to you Bally's!). 

It looks like an airport restaurant. 

Staff is surly but charming. They have a little flag on each table, so when you want something, you hoist the flag and they come over to serve you. 

I had delicious red snapper tacos - seriously tasty. We had chips and queso (HUGE portion, too much for us) and my mom had taco truck style tacos. She was pleased. Cheap beer prices for Vegas and you can get your Mexican beer favorites.

You can choose from shredded beef or shredded chicken and they come with cheese, lettuce, salsa, tomatoes and sour cream. The margaritas are pretty big, probably the size of a solo cup, definitely worth the $2. They also have a queso fundido dip that is EXCELLENT!!

PROS: The $2 deal is the best! There is a 2nd deal for $14 that is 3 tacos and an order of nachos. The nachos are insane!! The plate is overflowing and is probably enough for 4 people to eat off of! Great deal!

CONS: This is not a glamorous place by any means, its a simple little restaurant no bright lights or anything like that. If your looking for a place to be seen and get dressed up this is not your joint. 

TIPS: If you are in Vegas without a Total Rewards card your crazy! Everywhere you go (that is a Total Rewards owned property) you can earn comps with it and most places give you a discount as well.

- nachos!!! for $14 you get enough nachos to feed 4 drunk girls and get them FULL. we asked for it to go and the server said, well, its kind of big, it fills lot of to go boxes. we were like, whatevs, give us nachos! ... the plate - or, i should say PLATTER of nachos and filled 3 large to go boxes to the brim!!!

- self seating... for some reason i dont understand the logic of restaurants who use this method. its chaotic! since parties are self seating and theyre not spread out evenly amongst the wait staff, often times the wait staff fall behind and are ALWAYS busy. took me forever just to flag our server time every time we needed something. if i flagged someone down who wasnt our server, theyd say, sorry, ask your server. they didnt seem to care cause they werent working for your tip.",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,0,0,4,BQze9GO8aPLQzb4rpKle2A

We decided to order some food for ourselves as well.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Open Range Cheesburger ($11) w/Onion Rings ($2) & Loco Bueno Hot Wings ($10).  My Son ordered the 1 lb Big Daddy BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger ($16).  There were 11 people in our party, so I expected the service to be a little slow.

Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.....the Burger was OK, not great.  The Hot Wings tasted pretty good, but the sauce was not hot enough for me.  I asked for the hottest sauce they had and it was called the Texas Double Pepper.....it had a small kick to it, but it really didn't do much for me.  My Son enjoyed his Big Daddy BBQ Burger....it was huge at 1 lb, but it was nothing compared to the 3 lb Challenge!

Anthony ordered his Burger at the same time we all ordered our food, but he didn't get his 3 lb Challenge Burger until we were all finished with our meals.  Keep that in mind if you want to do this challenge.....it will take 15-20 min longer for it to be ready vs other entrees.

When they delivered the challenge Burger, they rang bells, whooped & hollered and made a big deal.  The staff announces it to the restaurant and they count down to start the 30 minute time limit.  Everyone in the restaurant watches as you try to eat this monster.  They advertise it as 3 lbs, which is within range for a normal person.....but it weighs it at over 5 lbs once you add it the 12 pieces of Bacon, Whole Onion, Whole Tomato, 6 slices of Cheese, Bun, and Lettuce!  Crazy!  I give Anthony props for giving it a shot.....he finished 1/2 of the Burger, which is respectful.  The manager told us 150 people have tried it, but only 5 have completed the challenge.  While we were dining there was another challenger at the bar.....we heard he only finished 1/2 the Burger too.  It's a $36 Burger in case you want to give it a try.....

Overall, it was a pretty fun time hanging out with other Yelpers.  The food was just eh....OK.

Me and my boyfriend came here to meet up with my uncle who was staying at Ballys. The place is pretty small with a few tables and stools and a couple of stools at the bar  The both of us sat at the bar and ordered entrees before my uncle arrived:

1) I ordered the HALF RACK BABY BACK RIBS w/ a choice of 2 sides; I got the baked beans and cole slaw. I don't remember what kind of rub or sauce but whatever our server suggested was really good. The meat was cooked well as were the baked beans. As for the cole slaw, it was swimming in a pool of the dressing, yuck. 
2) The boyfriend ordered the CARNE ASADA including spanish rice, refried beans, and choice between corn or flour tortillas. The carne asada was a nice sized portion and the accompanying onions and peppers added more flavor. The beans were good, but the spanish rice was a bit salty. 

We had just finished dinner when my uncle came to meet us.  From then on it was a nonstop drink-a-thon. Beers are relatively cheap, with $5 or $7 pitchers, depending on the beer, and so between the free flowing cheap beer and the endless choices of tequila, we stayed at the bar for a good majority of the night.

If you're in Vegas, plan to make a trip here if you like really cheap drinks, friendly and appreciative bartenders and a really casual, almost homey atmosphere.

Here is what you need to know. $2 shots of tequila, margaritas, draft beers and tacos. They also have a $15 margarita pitcher and a $25 128oz. bowl of alcohol poisoning. All the time. 24/7. 

You wont see club chicks in skimpy black dresses here or douche bags in Ed Hardy shirts. You may see an inebriated man in a hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts slurring his words at noon. If you do, stop and say hi to me!

Me and my girlfriend chose the margarita pitcher at the suggestion of our super friendly bartender. He said we might be happier with that than ordering separate $2 ones. He liberally poured booze into the pitcher right in front of us and seemed to keep pouring when he noticed my pleasure at the amount of booze he was providing. We tipped him well.

About halfway through our pitcher a couple of complimentary tacos showed up. He said they were extra and he thought I might want them! Thanks bartender! They are pretty good too for $2 tacos. Nice and fresh, decent size and the chicken was well seasoned and tasted pretty good. 

I miss the Tequila Bar and I want to go back. My only complaint is that they couldn't sell me the plain black shirt that said ""Tequila Bar, Bally's Las Vegas in a very standard font that the bartender was wearing and I wanted so badly as a souvenir.",bg41jhOxbknzzxgIbWFW1g,8,3,5,hGm_xuka1I6_Jp_VZCOixg

The food is great and service is decent. Their nachos are huge and tasty, but my favorite item is their tacos.  They aren't even on the menu, but if you ask for them, you will get them.  The tacos usually run $1-$2 each, depending on the day and time I suppose. They aren't skimpy either, they are similar in size to a taco bell taco, but they taste WAY better. The little things that keep this from being a 5-star rating for me is the fact that it is right next to the Casino bar which always has some crappy band playing so loud that having a conversation while you eat is near impossible. You can hardly hear the waiter when placing your order. Also, during busy times there may not be any seats available because the dining area is VERY small.  However, the food is so enjoyable that usually - when I am staying at Bally's or Paris hotel, I just get my food to go and enjoy it in the quiet of my room.  If they had more seats and had a wall or something to buffer the obnoxious band noise, this would definitely have a perfect rating.

To this end, The Tequila Bar inside Bally's has proven a vital post for wagon-circling during long stretches of losses, as well as a cheap celebratory meal following a fortuitous full-court heave. 

In downtown Vegas and off-Strip, drink and meal deals for the gambler and non-gambler alike are fairly common. But mid-Strip (Bally's is at the heart of things at the corner of Flamingo and the Strip) value is almost a four-letter word. 

Tequila Bar counters this trend with thoroughly decent $1 tacos (hard or soft, chicken or steak) 24/7, small $1 margaritas, as well as a larger forget-your-troubles-gringo margarita featuring not uno, not tres, but cinco Cuervo shots in a souvenir glass.  

But if you're looking for dinner and a show, I recommend ordering the burger known as The Texas Challenge. Three pounds of Angus beef, a dozen strips of bacon, a half dozen slices of cheese, a whole tomato, a whole red onion, an iceberg lettuce wedge, a 1/3 pound of cole slaw, and an epic, custom-made bun about the size of a manhole cover. 

I ordered the $40 masterpiece, and the bartenders and managers made a huge fuss, telling the rest of the Friday night crowd at the restaurant that something big was in store. How big is the patty? Imagine a large pie crust filled solidly to the top with ground beef. Uncalled-for big. 

If I was able to finish the entire meal (which when plated took two hands and a hernia belt to lift) it would be on-the-house and I would receive my name on the wall as the first to ever polish it off. 

When it finally arrived so many diners' camera phones were going off they had to have a bartender act as a cowcatcher to part the crowd so they could deliver the burger to my seat at the bar. 

It was incredible. Just the biggest, most beautifully symmetrical thing I'd ever seen. It was like I was looking at a regular burger through a powerful telescope, except that it was right in front of me. 

I was able to successfully finish two-thirds of the mighty meal, and the manager said I had come as close as any of the brave souls who preceded me. He then shook my hand and bought me a beer. He was a hell of a guy. And it was a surprisingly delicious burger, all things considered. 

I would recommend Tequila Bar highly as a friendly, inexpensive place to eat and drink your cares away mid-Strip, meet a lot of single ladies late-night, or make a huge spectacle of yourself by eating a Sputnik-sized burger.

Earl of Sandwich, the (gross) 24-hour cafe at Paris, and Tequila Bar at Bally's...that's all we could come up with around our hotel after a long night of gambling and drinking.  Sad.

Since we just wanted to grab something quick before rejoining our friends upstairs, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla appetizer.  I figured it would be small and simple, but it was really simple.  After popping open the lid, I was greeted with four triangles of quesadilla with scoops of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side.  Really not that impressive, even though it was about what I had expected.  

While they put in a decent amount of chicken, the taste was underwhelming - just not enough spice.  Had there been more cheese, it would have helped the flavor...but it would have made it even oilier.  It was already bad enough seeing the grease/oil it left behind in the container, it was even worse seeing it again in the morning (""Oh man...what the hell were we thinking..."").  For whatever reason, it reminded me of what you get from the food stands at sporting events.
 
Although the food is pretty mediocre, I can't say Tequila Bar was terrible since my friend thought his burger was decent.

The margaritas are okay, super sour and barely drinkable, but for $1 you really can't complain. The tacos are decent, a slight notch above taco bell. We ate here for a quick bite before The Price Is Right Live show and there was a Cuervo promotion going on so we got free T-shirts and free shots. It's a good deal. Took our drinks with us to the theater so we didn't have to pay their higher prices. Have never seen such huge platters of Nachos in my life!",9g2JfgOkfCE8GVvufIjVMA,0,0,4,weY6PmWUg173BVwSHpV3pg

$2 magaritas... I don't know about other people, but this got me sick.. Pretty sure it's okay for everyone else. But it gave me a hearburn feeling in which I had to throw up... and I only had a couple sips. AND I know i'm not that weak with alcohol.

The experience was so bad, I didn't want to come back for a snack a second night even though it was right down stairs... well I almost did for the nachos because it looked good on yelp. But I walked out again after I saw the size of it lol. It was too much for a late night snack.",ZHPXTyTzNdKCv6JrRvOmbQ,0,0,2,RDZ_6Uxt_cU5B7jPh24bCQ

We split the 1/2 beef nachos and had over half left.  I think it was around $13 for the nachos, which came with 3 big street tacos.  A pitcher of beer was $9.  A great deal, especially if you're on the strip and don't want to shell out a bunch of money on something quick to eat.
Chips were crispy, they used real cheese, guac was fresh (not brown), salsa was tasty.

The service here was VERY slow. After getting seated, our waitress came and got our orders about 15-20 minutes after. There weren't that many people there, so there was no reason for slow service. After ordering, we had to wait another 20-30 minutes to get food. We decided to order a round of drinks while we waited. This also took quite a while, and she also forgot one of our drinks. 

The food here is not that great. Their tacos are extremely plain and shitty tacos that look like leftovers. However, the nachos looked amazing, so there are some things that are good (you just have to do some research). 

Overall, a terrible experience. The wait is long, the food is bad, and the food price is ridiculous for what you get. The only upside is that it's open somewhat late, and the drinks are pretty cheap.",J5Djv7H9xtYe2UZNflmpNQ,2,0,1,EeWmKmXny8RxjF4ogJgn7g

They can be brought up to your room via room service too (Still $2 but you need to order at least 4). The party I was with did what everyone else was doing and that was getting the nachos. They were big and packed with toppings. If you had a hard time figuring out what to order and you see that plate of nachos come out of the kitchen you will be instantly sold!! We also ordered their ""Electric Fishbowl"" which was over 100 oz. of tasty drunkenness!! They broke it down into two tubs to make it easier on us for sharing. With our $40 tab (including a very small tip) all 4 of us caught a buzz and our bellies were pretty damn full. They have a burger challenge I'm sure I'll have to come back and try out. If you are staying at Bally's I don't see why you shouldn't eat here at least once.

5893622,2011-01-07,3,-ilCufjKjeswCLyIrCtuqQ,"I was here at least once every day that I was in Vegas. I still dream about their chicken tacos (with extra pico de gallo) and dollar margaritas. Trust me, they are that good! Word of advice: stay away from the beef tacos; they are less than stellar. I'd go for the strawberry margarita as it masks the tequila. The lime one is pretty good too, but the strawberry is amazing. My friend who had been here before told me that they offered dollar tacos and dollar margaritas from midnight to 6am, but to my recollection, tacos and margaritas were $1 all day long. 

They have this fishbowl drink here that is adorable. It's blue like water and may or may not have candy fish in it. Not sure since I didn't get the chance to try it, but I wish I did! The portions for the nachos are huge as well. One couple that was sitting by us on one particular occasion thought they could finish it on their own, but they barely made a dent in it. What a waste!

The service was terrible the first time that we were there, but the more we went, the more it improved. Maybe they started to recognize us? The bartenders were always nice though! They had no problem talking to drunk girls at 4am. We were rejected at the entrance two nights in a row because the kitchen couldn't handle any more orders. Imagine our disappointment when the manager behind the velvet rope informed us that the kitchen was too busy. 

So, remember: chicken tacos (I recommend at least 2 per person) and strawberry margaritas!",CZqB9PPVV0oUjapqODsisg,3,1,4,BHJpnflQWzCOPjGCO7nlgg
5918802,2011-01-25,0,-ilCufjKjeswCLyIrCtuqQ,"Have to admit that Tequila Bar and Grill is one of those hidden gems in Las Vegas.  And without fellow Yelper organizing a 3# Burger Eating Challenge here, I would have totally not know about this little restaurant, which is located in Bally's.

The food I ordered while I was here to cheer on Anthony M (took on the 3# burger and did a respectable job of finishing 1/2 of it within the alloted 30 miniutes) was their full slab of ribs, which was flavored with a choice of their selection of BBQ sauces (I went with the Texas Double Pepper, which was supposed to be hot, but it was mild at best).  It tasted okay, not the best nor worst ribs I have tried in Las Vegas.

From the comments about the food others in our party had ordered, I think the food overall is just okay too. Price-wise I think it is about average for something you order inside a restaurant within a casino.

However, Tequila Bar and Grill does have some very attractive items on their menu that would definitely qualify as super value deals.  The $1 margaritas, the $1 tacos, $2 draft beers, $2 tequila shoots, $16 ""mountainous plate"" of nachos, $36 3lb burger (if you order it and split it 3 or 4-ways).

Service for large parties is not good.  I am thinking why would they work harder for their tips, when the 18% is already automatically added to your bill.  Our waitress never came back to check on us after we ordered, except to bring us our food.  Checking up on refills of beverages or additional orders only occurred after we frantically waved down the waitstaff.  The only time the waitress followed up was to hound me to pay my bill before I was even done with my ribs (definitely didn't like that).

About the 3# burger challenge.  Expect to wait an hour for the burger to finally be served.  I am guessing that they will have to bake the giant hamberger buns from scratch and make the giant patty too.  So if you are serious about trying to win the challenge and go hit the gem for 2 hours before tackling the burger, it might be strategic to have someone go and order it for you, so you can get there without waiting so long that you are no longer hungry before tackling the 5 pounds of food that comes with the 3# burger challenge burger.  Also order the burger rare, because if the 2 inches of beef patty is cooked any more, it will mostly be well-done.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,1,3,c2EL5nH5adU4Qz0jF5ArqQ
