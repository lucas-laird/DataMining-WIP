Everything was so good! Their menu has a great variety and they made the sushi quickly right in front of us. What I don't like is how they make you pay for what you can't eat!

Americanized sushi is a crime against humanity.  Out of the 35 or so specialty rolls offered, almost all of them were deep fried, soaked in sugary sauce, or drenched in mayo.  Ick.  Don't you people want to taste your fish?  Apparently not.

Fish quality was poor.  My squid nigiri was GRILLED for some unknown reason, and swimming in lemon juice.  Scallop nigiri was given the same treatment.  

I forget what hand roll I ended up ordering, but it came with so much chili oil on it that grease ran down my chin when i took a bite.  

I will not be back.

Oh yeah, it's also pretty pricey.  For what I spent on my dinner there, I could have gone to my favourite all you can eat place (Sushi Kaya) TWICE.

Do not bother with this one.",Of9UCq61gd2ehoN337taKQ,2,0,1,FokVq4Q2oTDwcAGiRbqOEA

Of course we sat at the bar since we decided to do the all you can eat since we don't really do the specialty rolls we just do the plan sushi. If you love the specialty rolls they do have a wide selection.

Order up:
4 orders of Octopus
1 order of Uni (so I finally decided to try it and it's totally not for me; It really taste like the ocean.)
4 orders of Baked Green Mussels (good size)
5 orders of Surf Clam (my bf really loves surf clam)
1 Order of fresh water Eel
1 Order of the Hard Rock Roll (not too bad) 
1 Order of Oysters (delicious)
1 order of screaming orgasm (I've had better)
1 order of crab salad 
1 cheesecake 

So yes you can say we got our money worth. AYCE $26.95 Dinner $20.95 Lunch and just add $5 for all you can drink (domestic beers). They also really do time you because the chiefs tell you that your time is up and you can't order anymore (happened to the people sitting next to us). I know the rules for AYCE but every place I have gone to has never said that to anyone. 

Overall the service was good, no wait time, clean, and the food was good. So yes I would recommend this place but if you have a big crowd I wouldn't be so sure because if you do decide to do AYCE you might not get your money worth since they do really time you.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,5,5,4,-IqChAFr866oTRzkOU3CWw

The sushi was good, not the best I've had, but very good. I really liked the Orange Blossom roll with some kind of Japanese sweet mustard (that may not be exactly right).  

Short review, but bottom line is I'll be back again soon!

On edit:  I guess the $20 AYCE pricing is for lunch only.  Dinner is $25, which is a fairly typical price for sushi.",NjYwlzI5liKbe6RZWyo96A,0,0,4,5mjQg8x3vOglejTO0ZjpLg

119565,2011-11-13,0,dZB5VuI4mCVRz8qQUwUgCg,"As a first time visitor, I was uncertain - but felt that the positive reviews out -weighed the negative ones.  We sat and Yun and her sidekick server were attentive to and discussed the rules of all you can eat.  There were signs posted about time limits, items not eaten etc.  Yun assured us that the 45 minute time allotment for lunch would not be observed, and we could take our time...relief settled in that we weren't going to be rushed shoving sushi rolls into our mouths quicker than we could order them.  She did make it VERY clear that uneaten food would be charged...so eat up!  

It did get a little confusing that somethings were lunch menu AYCE only and other things were only offered at dinner.  None the less the options were plenty and we chose from the menu accordingly.  

We asked for suggestions, and went with a few of hers, other reviewers and a few of our own.  Everything was tasty and full of flavor.  Yun was attentive and checked back often.  

They do not offer half rolls as other places do except on your last order.  Yun was clear that once a half roll was ordered, that was it - no turning back - you were done eating.  This would be great if they could offer half rolls as an option so when dining with only 2 people you could sample more of the menu. 

Food was fresh and flavorful (rolls could be a little tighter IMO) and service was great.  No complaints about the staff here!

All of the fish, from the sashimi to the rolls, tastes super fresh; the temperature of the fish that comes with the nigiri and sashimi is just perfect. If you're ever in Las Vegas and in the mood to try some great sushi, I'd recommend coming here. If you're into spice, try the thug roll out! It's honestly my favorite roll. It has that punch from the jalapeño on top and the tang from the fish inside (the siracha also adds a bit too the flavor also). And also, if you like salmon, try out the salmon belly. It might be a bit more pricy but I can tell you that it's definitely worth the investment.

261840,2014-11-11,0,dZB5VuI4mCVRz8qQUwUgCg,"For those of you not interested in reading the details of my novel review, the best advice for this company if they really wanted to thrive with their consumers (based on the reviews I've read and then my own experience) is for the chefs to simply smile more and that would clear up the ""unfriendly vibe"" patrons are experiencing.  Because we actually didn't feel rushed or mistreated at all. And the server was a sweetheart! My chief suggestion to this business should be just to make sure not to cut corners with the freshness of their fish or authenticity of their sauces, because there are specific menu items we noticed the cut corners just a bit. (Eel sauce to be specific, tuna was odd color bit tasted fine, mackerel was salty salty and fishy...but not sure if mackerel is supposed to be to be honest)   I'm sure these couple things above are the root of the issue for most people.

NOW FOR MORE IN DEPTH READERS WITHOUT THE ATTENTION SPAN MAX OF 23 SECONDS :) :) 

Upon reading the other reviews before we went here, we were a bit hesitant. Seeing as how this was the closest all you can eat sushi in our area, we decided to give it a whirl.

To comment first on the posts from other customers, my boyfriend and I did not find that the service, from either the chefs or the servers, was trying to rush us out. The server (a young lady) was extremely friendly, and voluntarily took the liberty to suggest menu items we might enjoy based on what items we had already ordered. In addition, these items ended up being the winners of our ""most ordered"" for the meal.  And yes they DO charge if you leave any sushi but I don't know ANY sushi place in town that DOESN'T do this for all you can eat, so I'm not sure why people complain about this. But the server is sweet and informs you up front of this policy. Its simple...Dont order for a small country when you sit, and you should be fine! :) the chefs are not the type to chat and interact. They could definitely afford to take a greeting/smile course to at least forge a friendly demeanor indicating they are happy to have the business. I did not feel as though they dreaded our company either. The chefs just could simply smile more as they walk to and from you to take your order. I think this would change the experience for many that have posted about the lack of service. They were nice men though. I do not think they realize it comes off unfriendly.  


The sushi! This was the most important part to us of course. And the reason I and my boyfriend rated it a 3 out of 5 is only because there are small ways in which we noticed a few corners being cut. The sauces seemed a bit different; where eel sauce usually has that dark & silky texture and has its own unique taste....their eel sauce ever-so-slightly has a silky but somewhat applesauce looking texture to it. It also didnt quite taste like eel sauce and it was cold. Just threw us off a bit. The fish overall didnt taste the freshest that we've experienced at some of our favorite sushi dives. But it wasn't Un - edible either. we are fond of rolls with eel sauce so this affected us more only due to our passion for salmon skin rolls. But here we only ordered one. Many of their rolls on the menu are deep fried and/or have cream cheese. The white tuna sushi was amazing! And they have Inari! Which many sushi places don't. The other sushi we ordered the fish wasn't vibrant and fresh looking to be honest, however most of it was pretty good.",-eR4duGaRXE5Ckcg4hKS1A,7,0,3,YCBSMtmB1w0kFaAZv5NVHw

The restaurant itself was very quiet (a few people at the bar, one small family at a table), which I find appealing.  My server was very friendly and polite, and checked back regularly to make sure I was doing fine.

The sushi is pretty much on par with what you will find at any AYCE sushi place - I found it to be similar to the AYCE places I had gone to in NJ.  They serve you one roll at a time, so you really can't mix up your taste experience though.

When my waitress found out I was there alone on my birthday, she brought out a small ice cream with a candle in it and had the chef staff sing Happy Birthday to me.  I thought this was beyond what she was ""expected"" to do as a waitress, and I was truly touched.  I will definitely be returning.",fWob2og3NyAueYAV732afg,4,4,4,2lvit_SsXoOHP79oIjXkSw

Lastly , this is a local place for me so I will probably go back,  but only in an emergency.

Roll 1 was drenched in sauce/mayo and could not be tasted. Roll 2 was just ok. Poke Bowl had tuna and seaweed that were not fresh.  We asked for fresh ginger and fresh wasabi - but the ginger was pickled and the wasabi was an upcharge.

We came here at 8pm on a Wednesday.  I ordered the  sashimi platter and the mackerel sashimi with a side of steamed rice.  My wife ordered the japanese lasagna with a spicy tuna hand roll and a side of edamame.

First off, the cocaine platter was good.  It had some radish grated to make something similar to pasta that was interesting.  The edamame was pretty much the same as everywhere else, hard to mess that one up.

The good ends there.  They only put out the low sodium soy sauce on the tables (Maybe they were out of the regular stuff?).  The rice was all dry and crunchy across the board, especially on the japanese lasagna which is baked.  I love japanese lasagna normally (Give Sushi-Ko a try, theirs is excellent and it's right down the street) but this one was way too sweet and the sauce just wasn't on par with the offerings from other places.

Despite ordering the mackerel sashimi, they brought the sushi one.  The fish itself was good but the dry crunchy rice ruined that one just like everything else.  The spicy tuna hand roll was a bit bland and not very spicy compared to what I've had elsewhere.

A few moments after we finished eating my wife started not feeling well and threw everything up when we got home.  It was probably the japanese lasagna that caused it because she ate most of it and I only had a bite.

But this last time we went my husband and I both felt like a lot had changed in regards to the food quality and quantity (quantity not being a big deal if you get the all you can eat, just order more). The fried gyoza seemed a bit off from what we were used to, way more crispy, like they were either fried in a deep fryer and not by pan, or they had switched vendors and bought a different type of gyoza, so we weren't a fan of them. Also it seemed the spicy tuna rolls were made with much less tuna this time and more rice. The screaming honey roll seemed to have a different sauce as well, it had more of a vinegar-y taste to it than usual. My beef bugolgi was mostly burnt, and lacking the ""bulgogi taste"" it normally has. Lastly, it seems that they cut down on portion size on some of the rolls, but as I previously stated, not a big deal if you get the all you can eat.

Well, we finally did and I was content with the choice.

The biggest draw to this place is it's neon signage, it is Vegas, so you'd come to expect that neon is just part of the facade.  Secondly, for a month or so they have been offering AYCE sushi which is great in my opinion, I could try all of the sushi I want and not worry about the hefty price tag at the end of the meal.  

The rolls themselves are pretty standard for a Vegas sushi joint.  Fairly extensive menu but nothing that you haven't tried already if you're a sushi connosieur.  Aside from the Screaming Orgasm, TNT Roll and Pink Lady (frickin delicious), nothing else really struck my fancy.  

Some things to note would be unlike other sushi spots, half-rolls can't be ordered until the final order and keep your ears wide open as ""engrish"" runs rampant here.  All in all, a good spot to eat, but Sushi-Mon still tops it in my eyes.",acIm1t76GjS63KxT0c2G2g,3,3,4,38R1Y3faCH5KXwnEHFVTnw

A few reminders to those that call themselves a sushi restaurant:

`Cook your rice-crunchy white rice is not acceptable!
`Use fish that actually resembles fish. Not same defrosted pinkish looking, tough to chew piece of protien on top of a bed of under-cooked rice.     
`No wasabi under this piece of protien.
`Deep frying in 4 week old oil.

There is a reason why wthis place has so many 1 sta r reviews-the food sucks-period! More like Krazy Sick in the head for trying it. High overhead plus fewer people eating out equals lower food quality.

The only thing that totally made me mad was the fact that they charge $2.50 per cup for tea. So If you order a pot of tea, they don't charge for the pot. They charge you by how many tea cups are given to the members of your party. The all you can eat is a great deal.

First of all, our server was less than polite and was pushy to get us to order quickly. 

Then, my husband and I decided to do the ""all you can eat"" which is about $26 per person, and ordered 5 rolls between us. The menu says the ""all you can eat"" rolls are smaller than the regular rolls - but they are not. The rolls were huge (and honestly, not that great tasting). This would be a good thing, except they say on the menu that if you don't finish what you ordered, you have to pay for any uneaten rolls. If the rolls had actually been smaller as the menu said they would be, we would have finished them. But we were totally stuffed, and had 4 pieces left, all from different rolls. So, the server picked the most expensive roll we ordered ($14.99) and charged us the full price for that roll, ON TOP of us paying $26 each. 

So all in all, we spent $80 for 5 mediocre sushi rolls. If we had paid al la cart, it would have been around $55. So basically, we threw $25 down the drain. I feel like we got ripped off on purpose. Definitely not worth it.",2M_Jhg12u6yoS2gsMjTbuQ,10,0,1,t5Jioe3CqB0Fg0p8YthIMg

On my first visit when they first opened, I didn't really enjoy the food, and despite me not giving up on it, each visit after that never really improved.  I think I only kept going back because they had the lunch specials and had a couple nice servers, but no more of that.  It's only AYCE and a la carte and where's the good service?  I finally came to the realization after my meal today that they just will never attain the level of deliciousness that Sushi Loca has established. 

Fails:
1.  The miso soup sucks every time.  It's watered down.  How do you mess up miso soup?!
2.  Their california rolls sucks.  Gross sticks of imitation crab meat.  How do you mess up california rolls?
3.  The spider rolls is gross.  How do you mess up deep fried goodness?

We ordered some rolls and chicken yakisoba, and started off with miso soup. It came out cold. Also, the server forgot to give us chopsticks or spoons......though she was very gracious once we flagged her down.

The yakisoba was really greasy, and the vegetables were soggy. The sauce had a mysterious sweet flavor (anise?) that really didn't work. And, the rolls were terrible as well. We had a Rainbow Roll....I can't remember the others, but the rice was overcooked, and the fish didn't taste fresh at all.

For me it's 3 stars because the atmosphere during lunch wasn't very exciting. A little quite for my taste and because the amount of rice each roll has. Each roll tasted great but for someone like me who usually does sashimi and tries to cut carb intake, I wasn't thrilled.

Y'all can stop crying about the restrooms and just go home and poop. Food is A+ as my food baby would say so.

Been to this joint twice. The first visit, ordered all rolls. Second visit, ordered rolls and nigiris. The food comes fresh as raindrops on eucalyptus leaves in the Rocky Mountains (I don't know if that's a real thing). But yes, fish is fresh and it doesn't taste fishy nor like a dead fish. The service is pretty good and the food came out fast.

I would recommend ordering the following:
Screaming Orgasm - salmon with radish and house made sauce
Tuna peppered nigiri - seared tuna in pepper
Hamachi kama - yellowtail collarbone. 
Sake kama - salmon collarbone
Pink lady - spicy tuna inside, with tuna sashimi on top
Rabbit Pearl - garlic white fish on top with avocado and shrimp tempura
Dragon Roll - California roll with eel on top.

That's all you need for your AYCE dinner.

I would've given this place 5 star but the down side is the lack of variety of the appetizers and the shrimp tempura made with panko crumbs (it's usually just batter). 

Again, to all you crying about the bathroom, there's a Starbucks next door. Go poop there. I recommend this joint if you're ever in the NW hood craving for susshaaayyyy.",oS2O8YQ31HTSTQgPQKc7Cg,5,3,4,Y8J9oOOvAMnZLmGGkrO26Q

Of course at the end when we got our bill they charged us for the shrimp tempura that my daughter was looking at earlier. I will never come back here and to imagine all the competition in Vegas you would think you would treat your customers with a little bit more respect and not make them feel uncomfortable when they're eating especially when they have their children.

Why didn't they mop the floors before opening so the diners wouldn't have to smell lemon chemicals as their eating? Next, we were a party of 4 and they only had a napkin with chopsticks for two @ the table and the server NEVER thought to bring us two more napkins and chopsticks. (ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS?) We asked twice for extra forks and chopsticks, 20 minutes after being sat we finally got them. The food came out one by one instead of all of the food coming out at the same time. If it takes 25 minutes for al carte teriyaki dishes to leave the kitchen, then wait on putting in the sushi order!!!! We had half of our party FINISH their dinner before the other half got their food. So we just sat there hungry watching our friends eat. Lastly, I ordered the chicken teriyaki and it was all DARK meat.... No clarification on it being white or dark on the menu, I just assumed it was white because this isn't some 6 dollar hawaiian barbecue restaurant.

okay, lets start with the good:
-the food: the food was good, creatively named, and well displayed
the bad:
-it took considerably longer than average to recieve our order and it did not come out altogether, but rather piece by piece. 
-I felt as though I had to flag down the waiter if I wanted to order more food (we did all you can eat) which made me feel like they were being stingy with what they wanted you to order-helped by the fact that they post ""all you can eat rules"" which state everything must be ordered in the first hour, which wouldnt be bad except we had a hard time getting a waiter to take an order.

We were sat promptly... and then we were forgotten about.. one sushi chef on staff and one server but that wasn't the issue because all of the other patrons didn't seem to have any issue getting their orders taken and fulfilled; yes, even customers who had come in after us were in and out while we were still waiting. 

I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and I never use the 'race' card, but being the only latino patrons there makes me wonder if that was the issue? It shouldn't have been  considering the sushi chef himself was Mexican as was the cook in the back.

So thinking that since we're Regulars maybe I should bring it to their attention so they can do something about it for us and for their other customers but instead of trying to please the guest, the New Sushi chef that they have thought that since we're asking for small amount of rice on the nigiris it will be funny to reduce the size of the fish as well! So to make it short we got Half of the size of a regular order of sushi! Total Mockery! Not Cool. So to all the friends and acquaintances that We Recomended this place to, Think twice before going back here! I won't be!

Similar to other reviews, the OWNER needs a reality check and she needs to take a class on how to treat customers properly. I have never felt so humiliated,  angered and disappointed than I did when I dined there. I was a frequent visitor to this sushi place because I stayed right down the street. They have my favorite roll, the ""Mt. Charleston"" and they offered salmon belly, which sadly enough, I can't seem to get anywhere else. However, my friend and I ordered AYCE  and I ate my meal and he didn't. It was his first time and he should've just ordered one roll  (our fault) but he had a half roll left over. When it was time to pay, they were slow getting us the check because the OWNER decided to tell us to finish his roll before she could give us a check. Needless to say, things escalated and she was very disrespectful and went as far as to put her hands on me!  She was SO rude and I vowed to NEVER go there again. It's unfortunate for the staff at that place and I just hope she values her employees.  I tipped the staff and I left so upset. I will make it my duty to never direct people to this place again.

Before even finishing the roll in front of our faces, we were asked what we wanted to order next. There were 3 sushi chefs working and they were very quick to finish orders after they were placed. The restaurant was mildly busy for lunchtime on a Saturday. Just to give an example of how quick the service was... We ate at least 5 rolls in about 25 minutes. 

It is not a large restaurant. The dining area was clean. No odd smells as previous reviews stated.

Me and my husband went in around 6 on a Saturday and we were greeting and seated quickly. Fast and friendly service, so far so good. 
Looked over the menus, I did AYCE he did the chicken teriyaki.
My food came out in a weird order two rolls then the Screaming Orgasm which I love. (One of my appetizers was completely forgotten and never arrived). When the waitress set down the SO I was shocked, the tuna was grey. Seriously dark grey with a white-ish rim from being seared. I am not usually one to return food but having gotten sick from bad tuna elsewhere, I had to. 
They were polite and returned another much better looking version. Which was okay in taste, way too much mayo for me.

Now to the real review:

The restaurant looks nice and the staff are fast and friendly. but they seem to forget little things. My husband got some sushi, and with it, came the usual pickled ginger, but no wasabi. Hmm... No big deal. Our drinks weren't refilled either without us asking. The food however was quite tasty and beautifully plated and also didn't take too long to come out of the kitchen.

My dad loves loves Japanese food and he knows I love sushi, so one day he mentioned how we've always passed by this place, but never tried it.

The pops can't eat as much as me anymore, but whenever he goes he likes to get their chicken teriyaki entree meals. It comes with chicken, rice, miso-soup and I believe one other thing which I can't remember. But he loves that and usually orders a tuna roll and tamago nigiri as well. 

For me I looove all you can eat sushi and usually go  with friends so I don't have the burden to finish what I couldn't handle, but here I've been able to manage by myself. My favorite nigiri to order is their Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna. Some places give either too little/too much when it comes to the rice to fish ratio, but the 4 times I've gone, they gave just the right amount of both. 

My favorite rolls to get for them include the Lobster Popcorn (4 pieces), My Favorite Roll, Crunchy California, Rainbow Roll, and Dancing Eel. For the most part I stick to those when I go there because they have what I like inside them and are usually not spicy (I'm bad with spicy). But I'm sure all their other rolls are great too. Everything tastes fresh and the texture of the fish/rolls are on point for my liking.

Like many other sushi places, if you're on a date of two or have like a small group of 3, try to sit at the bar because you get your sushi so much faster and can order directly with the chefs.

The rolls my wife an i ate were full of flavor and were not overly done with sauce ( usually a bad sign ) .   She said her mouth was on fire from the spicy tuna , which is a plus as most places are a little light on the heat with spicy tuna.  She enjoyed it. 

The Miso Soup was tasty and the tempura shrimp was o.k. Had a little too much batter , but each his own.

She basically told us that the boss checked the trash each nite to calculate how much money he was losing.    We ate most of everything served, the only items we left were those dishes which were too ethnic or too fishy.

I have tried dinning in both the bar top and the tables and were satisfied with both. I like that any server in the restaurant can assist you and you don't have to wait for 1 specific server to come back. I enjoy the promptness in removing my empty plates to make room for more food. Even at the bar the same type of service is provided. I liked watching the sushi chef make the sushi creations. And even though they were busy slammed at times, they were very efficient in making sure your order was still taking care of.

After some searching and looking at reviews from my fellow Yelpers, we decided to go to this one. We first went in July 20th, 2016 and then again tonight. The first time was great so we decided to go again. 

Our experience this time was ok. We had a few rolls, some that were good and others that I wasn't too thrilled about. 

All this being said, it really is worth it. The service is great, and overall the sushi is good. The best part for me is that they have oysters on the half shell. Only disappointment to this is there is a limit of 2 person however, unlike the screaming orgasm and some other items, it does not say this on the menu but the sushi chef told me this.

Their eel sauce was not the right flavor or consistency at all and their fish was not fresh. I was still hungry and annoyed that we definitely hadn't gotten our money's worth for AYCE, so I found a roll that I thought I might like. I asked if they could add shrimp tempera to it and she cut me off in the middle of my sentence to say that they only do ""customization"" on the a la carte menu.

This place has done a complete 180 in a mere 2 months. I'm not sure what I was more upset about - the bug on the wall next to me, the terrible food experience or the bad service. 

The waitress who greeted us and then took our check was not the same woman taking our orders and bringing food. The latter forgot most of what we ordered, including 2 rolls, 3 orders of nigiri and a bottle of sake. It felt like she was wanting us to leave, so we did. 

The bug on the wall - I understand, it happens - but nobody seemed to care, which was sad and disturbing. He just crawled right up there, and watched us eat or disappointing meal. Clearly I afraid of humans or interaction - which tells me they've been around for a while. Gross. 

The meal (after all, that's what brought us here.) The nigiri was sad, there texture wasn't that of freshness, and while some of the rice was a solid brick in your mouth, others fell apart when you selected your nigiri. The fish felt dry - like it had been left out and refrigerated. The shrimp lover roll is when I realized that this wasn't good. The shrimp tempura was like a squishy garden hose. Clearly not freshly fried, but done so either earlier that day or the day before. Guitar was hot and cold at the same time - which takes talent!...but not the good kind. We tried the shrimp shumai and immediately regretted it, as the lard-like texture flopped around in our mouths. Most scary of all was the chicken teriyaki - it was a solid chunk of ligament cartilaged and holding strong. Gross. 

The tea was good, and plentiful. The coconut Michu delightful as usual. One star for those two items.

3951598,2017-03-09,2,dZB5VuI4mCVRz8qQUwUgCg,"As an all you can eat sushi addict, Krazy Sushi is one of my least favorite in Vegas. We came here for dinner on a Thursday night. When we first walked in, we weren't greeted for almost 5 mins even though the server and sushi chef saw us. There was only 2 other tables so it was not busy at all. However, they did seem understaffed with just one server and two sushi chefs. 

When we were finally seated, we placed our order with the server. We typically order 10 orders of nigiri, an appetizer and two rolls. My husband and I know what we like so we prefer to order it all at once. I understand this order may seem a lot, but this isn't our first rodeo. While ordering, she kept informing us that if we don't finish our food it'll be charged. After the third time she said it, I finally told her we got it and to stop telling us. Geeze lady, there's signs everywhere and after telling someone two times you'd imagine they'd back off. 

FOOD: The fish quality was low and there was an intense fishy after taste. The only nigiri that was good is the super white tuna. Other than that, I wouldn't come back for any raw fish. The fish tasted dry and old. The rice to fish ratio on the nigiri wasn't great, there definitely was a lot more rice than fish. 

We ordered the tiger roll. There was a lot of sauce and too much rice. If you're into a sushi experience where you love rice heavy and overly drenched saucy rolls, then this is your place. 

However, for me I didn't enjoy my experience at Krazy sushi.

4043785,2017-10-29,0,dZB5VuI4mCVRz8qQUwUgCg,"Unfortunately, the fish to rice ratio on their nigiri has gone completely out of whack with my recent visit. Fish cuts were narrow and thin, and the rice was much larger. 

I had to cut the rice in half in order to get the ratio to something more managable where fish was more present in my mouth instead of mostly just tasting and feeling rice.

The waiter reminded me of the ""have to eat the rice rule"" when taking the plates away with half chunks of rice. I made sure to inform him that I wasn't trying to cheat, but the way the sushi was made it very difficult to enjoy. No dings against him as he was very polite about it, and we all know that's a standard rule, but its clear that the servings put customers at a disadvantage in enjoying their sushi like its supposed to be.

Prior to this, their fish cuts were always generous and on the money. Not sure what's changed, but if the goal is to cheap put on fish, customers will be lost.

Shrimp+veg tempura was okay, but the dipping sauce had a surprising amount of alcohol--I could feel it in the back of my throat every time I used it. One plus worth mentioning--the fry oil tasted fresh. Too many places don't change the oil often enough.

Scallop skewer appetizer--mini-marshmallow size scallops. Cooked properly, but expensive for what they give you.

The average: While the sashimi IS fresh, the cuts were average.  The ginger is pink, the wasabi is an unsettling shade of green and both were kind of bland.  The chopsticks are very splintery.  Edamame was okay.
The bad: Had a Philly Roll as a side to my Cocaine Sashimi plate, and the taste was just ... off.  But I usually prefer sashimi anyway so this didn't bother me much.

Bottom line: We will come here again for sushi because it's a mile from our house.  But we will definitely drive further if we want a high-quality sushi dinner.",pXKbbNUbzNp41o0DHq5DWA,3,1,3,llfZXPq44izUpuz483qCUg

Back to krazy sushi. I'm writing another review as of Jan 16 at 3:20 everything is amazing here and sushi is always fresh I do not know why this place doesn't have 4-5 stars... Don't pass this up give this plAce a try.



The sushi chefs here are very nice and social and make great sushi with great customer service!!!!!



writing an updated review went in on April 28 or 29 can't remember but ushualy there's this awesome girl there really cheerful and happy going the best service ever she always remembers my name and is on top of all of the tables she has to serve... Idk who the hell hired the Asian kid with the punk rock bangs but it was literally the worst dining experience I've ever had there. So bad that I probably will not be back until they get rid of that kid... All the sushi chefs are dope there and funny and make bomb sushi. But that day it was super shitty and I even ordered edemame upon arrival never even got it my gf has to ask the waiter that finally came around to our table a second time pretty much got it right before we received our check... Didn't tip the waiter but tipped the sushi chefs because it's not their fault this kid can't appreciate his job....


If you want good sushi and a way better experience I recommend going to sasa sushi off of Cheyenne and 95 same all you can eat prices and better service..

4500061,2013-10-10,2,dZB5VuI4mCVRz8qQUwUgCg,"A popular type of dining experience in Las Vegas is all you can eat sushi. Similar to gas stations, these styles of restaurants are found in most plazas. I find that in this day and age, people are looking for the quantity of food as well as the quality. Kindly enough, the Japanese introduced this lovely eating innovation. Krazy Sushi is a restaurant that I am extremely fond of and a food that I constantly crave. In order for a sushi bar and restaurant to generate business, one must possess certain qualities. The qualities of this specific restaurant are the reasons why I continue to choose this tasteful art as my occasional dinner.
       When walking into any restaurant, I have certain expectations of comfort that I wish to feel. The characteristics that I look for while eating out lie in the smallest of details, which really create an overall tone for any restaurant.  I take in the color of the walls, the décor, the style of seating, how the lighting is, as well as the first impression I acquire. My father is an interior designer, so I am familiar with this insight and have adopted a creative perception that can be analytical in judging any atmosphere. The general sense I have when I arrive in this restaurant is comfort and relaxation. Each secluded booth is designed with bamboo. Within each individual booth there are modern single hanging lights directly over your table that illuminates the table entirely, creating a feeling of intimacy.  This is a very inviting setting because I have an overall sense of connection to the atmosphere as well as the people that I am sharing the meal with. 
      At any type of restaurant or business costumer service is key. Costumer service is really what ties any outing together; it allows human connection to create comfort and overall form a fun experience. Although each server is different,  in any restaurant I always appreciate a smiling face and a patient individual who is guiding me on my eating extravaganza. Granted, not everyone is always having the best day possible; but it does reflect on what the meal is going to present itself as. The employees at Krazy Sushi are warm and extremely welcoming; with the occasional dry personalities here and there. One of my favorite aspects of this restaurant is when entering the front door; each employee greets the approaching guest shouting, ""Irasshaimase"", meaning welcome in Japanese. In my eyes, this acknowledgement creates a sense of kinship.  I automatically feel as welcome as they are demanding I feel. The servers are generally happy and enjoy their job, which radiates into their kindness. 
      It is a little peculiar to think about how Las Vegas is able to constantly maintain a large supply of fresh fish. We live in a desert for crying out loud. With that being said, there are so many restaurants of its kind; which means, finding fresh fish is not always the easiest. Growing up, my parents conditioned me to eating sushi on a regular basis. Throughout my life, I have had experiences a lot of places where their fish is dried out, dully colored and smells a little funny. Needless to say, those are not the places that I chose to eat at any longer. However, the fish at Krazy Sushi is perfect. The pieces of fish are thickly sliced and the chefs are not shy in distribution. Each bite I indulge in forces me to close my eyes in complete satisfaction until its exotic flavors are swallowed. My taste buds are always grateful to be spoiled with such decadent fish, not to mention the elegant presentation that is delivered with each plate through art. 
       Overall, Krazy Sushi is a lovely dining experience. It remains my sushi of preference and I continue to encourage anyone who is open to eating bizarre types of food to live this experience for themselves. The Atmosphere is authentic, the costumer service is welcoming and the food is well worth the money spent. For an all you can eat restaurant, you might be grateful you chose this particular establishment to completely satisfy your cravings and leave your stomach full to its capacity.",QADwYe4LYZdVmWw2VRMrSg,4,4,5,KlT1WtuA5hMO6hCBsXhgYA

It was quiet for lunch time and we were able to choose our seat and chose one of the hidden booths in the back. Maybe they were prepping but there was a really rotten smell that filled the restaurant and you could just tell, everything was dirty. That's an instant red flag to me. Our table and booth were completely sticky and the small circular dishes the provide on the table still had some rice residue on them. 

AYCE pricing is not bad, $20 a person if I remember correctly. But I was so turned off by the smell and overall appearance of the place, I wasn't looking forward to eating any raw fish from here.

I ordered a few california rolls and they weren't bad at all. My husband ordered a variety of rolls and enjoyed them all. 

You can't really mess up a cali roll and though my husband enjoyed the food, we won't be back. There's just something to me about eating in a clean environment.

The AYCE allows you to order half rolls and that's definitely a plus. You can try multiple rolls without getting a food coma (I mean, you'll still get it anyway but at least from 4-5 different rolls haha). I though the fish was good when I was there.

It was good rice ratio the first time I went years ago, then a bit more rice but still acceptable level and it stayed at that for a long while. 

Now the corners are just cutting it too much. It was ridiculous that we only ordered one round of nigiri. Thin fish slices and way krazy rice - look at the photo. It was a 20/80 ratio, when it used to be fair. We ended up eating rolls and appetizers instead since those were a bit more fair. 

Also everytime the lady came to check on us and we had nothing in front of us, she asks if we're done or if we want dessert. It made me feel like we were trying to be rushed off being asked ""are you done?"" frequently. We had a few pockets of long wait since one of the times our order fell and then he did everyone elses order and then forgot about redoing ours.

My hubby and I have been here for AYCE dinner twice. It's $26.95 which I feel is pretty comparable to other sushi restaurants around town. We ordered baked mussels, volcano roll, lasagna roll, a variety of nigiris, salmon skin handroll, chicken skewers and topped it with honey toast. 

The baked mussels had just the perfect amount of cream cheese, and a delicious sauce that almost tasted like a soy sauce vinegar. Cooked to perfection. 

I also highly recommend the honey toast. It is normally a la carte, but is free with AYCE dinner. It's a toasted Hawaiian sweet roll, drizzled with honey, and topped with a small scoop of ice cream. Perfect.

Was told by some friends who are locals about this place and swore up n down that this place is as good or better then Sushi-Ko. Hard to believe. 

Figured, what the crap. why not? Lets try it! Stopped in around 1ish. Had costumers in, and decided to sit at the sushi bar. Greeted by our awesome waitress who took our alcohol order. (I don't believe in soda at sushi bars). Looked through the menu and was surprised at what it consisted of. Ordered numerous sashimi plates and numerous rolls. And not to forget the sake as well. The first bottle I ordered was my typical sake, cant remember the name, but its the same I always order. Took the chefs recommendation on sake and was please.

Oh, and the food? Amazing. Fish was super good, super fresh, super fast. The owner, who was our chef at the time was super friendly, chatted with us the entire time, told us how he was hung over. It was great. 

And to be honest, this is 2nd best sushi Ive ever had. No complaints what so ever. Possibly the fact that maybe they don't have a happy hour? But then again I live 290 miles from this place and it really doesn't matter. 

I hope nothing but the best for this business. and Esp for the owner who was amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better sushi experience

Since the beginning of the year though we notice a significant change in the vibe of our favorite sushi restaurant.  The food started to be more good and never great.  The servers who made our nights fun were gone; replaced by a brigade of food schlepers.  Worst of all, the decor went from a quaint experience to a video wall extravaganza that was better suited for East Freemont than Centennial.  

Even with that, we wouldn't give this a 1 star or write a review about never going back.  Not until our LAST visit.  They changed the menu without changing the names of the rolls.  They continued to send item after item to our table that we didn't order, but didn't get items we actually ordered.  And to put a creamy dreamy topper on our craptastic experience last night: we both got food poisoning.   We didn't make it half a mile from the restaurant before having to yank the wheel, dart out of the car, and spend 5 minutes giving back to the world.

Thank you Krazy Sushi.  You lost two loyal customers.  You ruined our date night.  Hopefully we will be able to enjoy sushi again from a place that knows the difference between fresh product and spoiled product.

Food- I got 3 different rolls, one baked and other 2 just normal rolls. As normal I was not disappointed as the quality and taste were on point. There selection was large, but could be difficult to understand their rules (more on that later. 

Restaurant - I think it has great seating options, it was busy when I was there but didn't seem like that was a problem as the staff at Krazy Sushi are all over it. They even have 3 places to sit in a semi private table, kinda like a enclave. 

Staff - As I mentioned never have had a problem, always been nice to me and I have never really waited. I usually sit at a table but today wanted to try the bar to compare, and will say felt like I was not ignored.

Why not 5 stars then, well again even thou I have been there before, I was having issues gettin back in that saddle with their all you can eat rules vs. ala carte, but once you read over it, should not be a problem. Also, I mentioned good service, was not ignored, but felt like at times, I was bing slightly rushed by one of the guys behind the counter.

The decor is of course modern Asian. It doesn't seem super big but it's never an issue when we go. There's a la carte, and all you can eat. I hardly ever go to places for a la carte since I found out how I love sushi. I usually go all you can eat. Prices for a la carte are of course higher then all you can eat. So if you're hungry do all you can eat and save yourself a high bill. 

The quality of the sushi is decent. The rolls are made good. The only time you will have breakage is on some special rolls and it's because of the delicious sauces they put on them. I am a sucker for cajun albacore. Really cajun anything I usually like haha. Their unique roll that has me captured is Snow White Roll. It's on their new items menu and I would at least try it if you go.

Service was good. We sat at the bar and the guys doing the sushi were friendly.

Do we wait for the waitress who has her back facing the door because she is facing her register? Why are the two chefs huddled talking to each other, looking towards me and not even saying anything? No irasshaimase or hello? I already had a whole yelp review typed out within the longest minute and a half. When the waitress finally noticed...the chefs finally said hi. Uhhh. My butt was already clenching. Why do I always get such luck.

Turns out...the waitress is super super sweet and nice as is the other wait staff that came to check on us. The service was quick. My husband chose to do the AYCE for about 21 bucks. I would've done the AYCE, however, they do not allow you to share food with a 2 year old! My 2 year old eats, but not really. Anyone with such a kid can understand. 

Instead, I ordered their beef bulgogi lunch special. Miso soup, salad, veggie tempura, cali rolls, rice and the beef. I shared with my 2 year old and it was enough for he and I to share. He doesn't eat a whole lot in one sitting so the meat and rice was perfect serving for him as there was enough meat left for me to pick off.on top of all the other items I finished off.

They have open tables and private booths which I really loved because I'm such a recluse private type of person especially while.dining.

My husband thought their sushi wasn't bad at all, and since he works nearby...it'd be a good spot to fulfill his lunchbreak sushi crave. Neither of us thought it'd be a place we'd go out our way for, though, especially since we have a decent AYCE nearby that allows us to share with toddlers. Realistically, we probably won't be returning because there was nothing worth returning for. However, once we finally got seated, service was pretty prompt.

I called in an order tonight of their Miso Ramen Soup and a California Roll (nothing too complicated) and was told it would take over 25 minutes, which I thought was alot for soup, pre-made noodles and a sushi roll.  Again, still giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Came down to the restaurant, no close parks as Starbucks completely owns that parking lot apparently.  Got into the restaurant, appeared to be less than full, and was greated and asked for my to-go order.  So here's my issue, she gives me the bill, I put in $15 (it was $14 and some change) and she gives me a strange look and asks me if I want my change?  I ask her, ""why do I have to give you a tip for simply ringing up my to-go order?""  She just stood there, starring at me, so I gave her another dollar and asked, yet again, can I have my food now?   She went to ring up the ticket across the resteraunt, noticing another woman nearby asking servers to take her bill for payment but no one noticed her until she started yelling across the resteraunt.  Then I turn back, and see the waitress who took my money, take the change, and put it into their ""tip jar"" on the sushi bar and walk away, starting to take orders at other tables.  Now, I'm pissed....not only did I give this idiot a tip, now she's racist because I called her out on her greedy-ass and she visually removed me from her mind as I started shouting at a server, give me my f*cking food now....he asked who was helping me, I point to the woman and he brings her over and she greets me like its the first time she's met me.  I had to demand for my food, and give a tip just to be ignored by the wait staff here entirely.  The food was mediocre at best, and this place needs to stay out of  business as the owners should not be working in the service industry if this is the quality of the staff they hire and allow to manage their day to day.  I never really noticed if this was a racist thing (myself being white and funny enough the other paitron who had to yell to pay their bill, was also white), as the other tables this woman began to assist were ALL of Asian descent, and she was able to forgot about me and my order, all in the span of less than 2 minutes.  Stay away from this place if your white, as your service will be sh*t.  If your not white, it appears they welcome you in with open arms.",gvC9vVIQbTSPOpXvtiUbUg,0,0,1,1lcUTpNt01zxqY5mbVk0zg

They told us we couldn't order everything we wanted right away because of quality issues.  Then they didn't come back to take our order until we were almost out of time.  The staff was somewhat friendly but clearly on a slow day like the day we were there you would think that getting a waiter or waitress to help you wouldn't be an issue.,kryv0a1WTHG_lDMBWh_Gug,0,0,2,y2zjDwivNWf79c0b4n1fNw

5777147,2016-10-22,0,dZB5VuI4mCVRz8qQUwUgCg,"love krazy sushi. get the all you can eat and you will be so full you'll burst.  i've never had a bad plate.  experiment with the sauces they will bring you all of them to try if you ask.  when you get all you can eat you can also get half sushi rolls instead of a full. that way you can eat many different types of sushi before you explode. 

a very full restaurant there are always a  good amount of people there so dont be surprised if you have to wait. but its still faster than most sit down restaurants.  place is pretty clean considering how many people come through. its also got a pretty popular bar.

there are a few ugly trolls who came here and ate but got turned off for some bit of nonsense and had to put one stars.  dont mind them and their fat fingered whiny gibberish.  just because they can manage to smash enough keys with their wompa wompa big berzerker hands doesn't mean they are intelligent enough to give a fair review of a restaurant.  

minus zero stars for the pervy chefs who always check out your girlfriend because thanks for the compliment bro. they give you free stuff sometimes.  minus zero stars for the hipsters who come in with their lumbjack ironic hats because its not krazy sushi's fault that some of their clients are douchy.

Very fast service and the rolls were well made. The sauces were primarily sweet but I really enjoyed them. 

The server even offered to split the rolls in half during happy hour for some of the more exotic choices. 

My favorite was the volcano roll. Sweet, and it came out piping hot. Scallops on top were the best.

Did that explain what you were looking for? If you like Toro and Engawa, don't come to an AYCE place....

Anyway, 5-stars for being one of the better ""Ichiro Mashita"" style sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Don't leave a negative review because it wasn't Traditional Edomaezushi. AYCE themed restaurants and Traditional Edomae style are two completely different styles of cuisine. Yet, I always see countless self proclaimed sushi experts give a AYCE place a negative review because they thought they could get Toro, Halibut, Sea Eel, and Bonito. At a traditional Edomaezushi restaurant they will give you a hot towel when you come in because you are going to have to eat with your hands. You get no chopsticks, soy sauce, or wasabi. You also usually have to take your shoes off. Then you get a piece of unrefrigerated fish that was killed minutes earlier. AYCE themed restaurants were a result of Ichiro Mashita combining aspects of Edomaezushi with other types of Japanese cuisine such as Tempura, Teriyaki, Yakiniku.  It's a completely different variation of Sushi. 

The food here at KRAZY SUSHI is practically identical to all the other AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas. It's on the better side though.  Practically every AYCE sushi place in LV has an identical menu, and identically themed rolls. They always have rolls named after casinos and something called ""orgasm sauce"". 

I like the nigri here. You get about 70 percent fish and 30 percent rice. It's a perfect combination. They also have all the types of of fish you would expect to find at an AYCE sushi place. They got everything from Albacore, Unagi, Saba, Salmon-Sake, Sweet Shrimp, Majuro, Yellow Tail and more.  

You know, I like AYCE sushi places better than Traditional. I always come to an AYCE place at the end of  a long difficult week of working out. I spend at least 3-4 hours a day working out and my body fat is usually only around 4-6%. Therefore, I feel very lethargic and tired  on some days. These AYCE sush places have a perfect balance of carbs and proteins to help replace my glycogen and repair my damaged muscles. If your an athlete, I recommend AYCE sushi.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,13,7,5,cAVdGkignmg3gFc4cgm2oA

They have K-Pop playing on the tv which my kid enjoys watching while she eats. They do offer trainers for those attempting to learn traditional art of sushi eating. Our server greeted us immediately and got our drink orders, a minute later another server came to ask for our drinks so I informed him someone else got it. When she came back with our drinks I gave her my daughters order tuna handroll so she can start eating. After a few minutes she came to take my order and as soon as she left my daughters sushi was dropped. I was amazed at how quick it was. And even more astonished at the freshness of the tuna. It was like butter in my mouth. I color was a hearty glistening deep maroon. I only ate the fish out of a couple and she took care of the rice and nori. My orders came out in record time too and so fulfilling that I couldn't even finish them. I order the rainbow roll and shrimp lover and both were more than I bargained for.

As for service - I love how all the staff walked around ensuring you're having a delightful experience. There was a constant table check which I appreciate. 

Price was not that bad and in comparison with other places it was average. They do offer AYCE so if you're in the Centennial area by Centennial Hospital you should definitely stop by here.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,16,14,5,ufRXtRt_bxZiajSg5uyBmw
