While the price was a bit steep, we found each food item very tasty and memorable. I asked for a spicy prawn dish which they did not have on the menu. The server graciously said the kitchen would make one for me and it was wonderful. Others ordered mostly seafood and the food was excellent. The service staff was always there to assist us and make suggestions to help us have a good time.

116612,2013-02-06,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Jasmine's saving grace is its fortunate view of the Bellagio fountains, but aside from that it's just a typical, overpriced Strip restaurant.  My party got an assortment of dishes, including the Dim Sum trio, crispy walnut prawns, general chicken, and kung pao chicken, which will be dissected below.

The General Chicken was named pretty accurately, it was very ""General"" in nature.  Not a lot of flavor and could have been whipped up by an amateur chef with simple ingredients.  The crispy walnut shrimp was simply not up to par - I've had better quality and flavor from Panda Express.  Kung Pao chicken was OK, but still nothing to write home about.

Dim Sum trio was a straight up ripoff... I'm sorry, but if we knew THREE (yes, 3) dumplings would have costed us $18.88, we probably wouldn't have ordered them.  Said dumplings were also very run of the mill in quality and flavor.

Onto the food, we ordered the lobster dumpling - succulent and perfectly pan fried, for main we got the Mongolian beef and eggplant both were outstanding dishes. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the eggplant was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The delicate flavors of all 3 dishes was very obvious.

It was then a dizzying descent into one of the worst Chinese food meals I can remember (and that includes college lunch lines and sidewalk carts).  I had the General's chicken - he was probably dishonorably discharged. The sauce was 99% ketchup.  If the chicken was the general's then the seafood fried rice was Uncle Ben's - flavorless.

The first thing I noticed was that they definitely do NOT enforce the dress code. One of the diners at a table near ours was wearing trainers and a hoodie, and I noticed another table being seated that included a girl in a short skirt and midriff shirt.

As for the atmosphere, while I can appreciate the classy decor, I'm not a fan of the ""dining hall"" idea. It's just one big long room with bright lights and no interesting layout. Boring.

The biggest disappointment was the food. Halfway through dinner service on the first night of Restaurant Week, and they had run out of the Beef Tenderloin, and had to substitute Mongolian Beef. I am by no means a food snob, but the quality of this dish was no better than something you'd find at Panda Express. I felt gypped. 

For appetizers we ordered the duck rolls and lobster dumplings. Not bad, but not fantastic either. 

I will say though, that the staff was outstanding. Very helpful and polite. 

Overall, for about $50/person, I'd expect a classier establishment with higher quality food, and I'd expect to have nicer things to say about it.",g3a-Ve7NU5pb0kdTcSP1fg,1,0,2,FgF5GdO23ChSwFj80K6RCw

The view of the fountains and tourists enjoying them was so fun to watch. We loved all the little touches like red roses, beautiful dishes and utensils which even had their own stands. We ordered:
dim sum- literally 3 dumplings(lobster, pork, and shrimp), small amount but each so delicious and perfectly seasoned
hot and sour soup- decent, I've had better but it was still really good
white wine- my hubby liked it so much he had 3 glasses, we should have just ordered the bottle
2 pound lobster- it is $120 but perfectly seasoned and came out hot
Chilean sea bass- baked, pretty good just a little too sweet for us
greens with minced garlic- delicious
hot tea- ok
chocolate cake with ice cream- light and delicious with ice cream

Clearly this place trades on the view, and their Sunday brunch.  The food is insanely overpriced, not traditional Cantonese, and mediocre at best.  Our dinner tab was over 800 dollars, and in Seattle, NY, SF, or almost any other major city, 100-150 dollars would have bought better quality, more authentic Chinese food.

We ordered 2 dim sum platters- mediocre and overpriced for 3 dumplings that were clearly re-heated.
Hot and Sour soup for the table- not very good at all.  Lacked tofu and bamboo shoots and other traditional ingredients, very thin and brothy, lacking sour element.
Chicken lettuce cups at the suggestion of the waiter- terrible, little or no chicken- all diced water chestnut.  God knows what they cost and they were much worse than PF Chang's- who by no means am I holding up as a golden standard for high quality, authentic Chinese.
Ginger fried rice- not bad
Broccoli beef- not bad
Singapore style noodles (at suggestion of the waiter)- not good at all- no curry powder or turmeric at all.
Eggplant- meh
Stir fried Udon noodles- meh, no flavor or character
General chicken- meh- not the best, but not great
Walnut shrimp- there were 7 shrimp, and this dish was was probably 40 dollars.  Enough said

Two days after the food poisoning at the buffet, my other half finally wants food, and bad service history aside, we tried again...

Lest than a foot from, another couple....  With a virtually empty restaurant.  During our appetizer, a young Asian boy hovered over us like a Secret Service guard, watching us eat.  Eerie...

And his looked the same, only his meal and plate were scalding hot, like microwaved...   Then to boot, they hovered and rushed, and came to clear out plates before we were even done.  And they took them!!  WTF!!  O was so hungry I would have eaten leather.  Which may have been better...

We came here at the recommendation of a Bellagio employee (We also stayed at the Bellagio). So maybe our expectations were too high (???) 

Had a dinner reservation for 4, Saturday 8 pm. Got there a few minutes before 8, waited an additional 15-20 minutes to be seated. No big deal. 

The only reason I gave this place 1 star is because I have to & because the fountains are nice to look at. The rest of the atmosphere was quite boring with outdated decor. 

Our waiter was no where to be found for most of the evening. Very slow in taking our order & kept disappearing mid-sentence. It also took a very long time to get our food. We weren't being rude or demanding so can't figure out why he provided such horrible service, maybe he had a bad day. 

The food was just ok, I've had much better Chinese food in the Bay Area, maybe even at Panda Express. We didn't order drinks (except Pellegrino) & didn't order dessert (couldn't wait to get out of there). Our bill was $160 per couple, gratuity included. For mediocre food & horrible service, really?! 

I could've ordered the same amount of food but much better quality, back at home for well under $80!

While we had hoped for a fine, fun, pleasant dining experience on a Saturday night in Vegas, this was definitely NOT it. I am also wondering if we dined at the same restaurant as other Yelp users. Yikes!

590704,2014-08-12,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"This is a review about their Sunday brunch.

$58 for brunch?  Yeah.  It's expensive.  I felt guilty spending that kind of money on brunch especially since I'm not wealthy, but let me tell you... it's worth it.

Ok, let me justify it.  For a decent brunch in Vegas, I normally spend about $30.  In Vegas, I'm not looking to eat at Denny's and try to get away with brunch for $10.  $30 is about right for a nice, fun place with decent food for brunch.  Couple that with the fact that I ate so much I barely ate a snack for dinner.  So I saved the cost of dinner, which I would have spent another $30-$40.  Now, add in the elegant and luxurious ambience at Jasmine, sitting next to the Bellagio fountains, and the price isn't so bad!

Now that we've got the sticker shock out of the way, I have to say this is one of the top things you must try in Vegas before you die.  Or maybe I should say, this is one of the top things you must try in Vegas before they get wise to it and raise the price.

So what makes this place so damn good?  Let's start with the Peking Duck.  I am from Hong Kong and I know a good Peking Duck, and this was totally legit.  Crispy skin, they sliced it thin so you only got the skin, not the fat, and not the meat.  The bun that goes with it?  Superb.  Soft, light, and fluffy.  Even Peking Duck at some of the nicer restaurants in Monterey Park can't compete.  I can sit there and eat just that all day.

Poached shrimp cocktail... Gigantic, meaty and delicious.

They had poke style tuna in a little waffle cone made with squid ink.  That was fabulous.  Similarly, they had a beef tatare in a spinach waffle cone.  That wasn't as good, but still pretty tasty.

Smoked salmon was excellent.

They had dim sum (har-gow and shu-mai).  Not the best dim sum I've had, but pretty good.  I would say better than the dim sum found at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's.

So many of the items there were delicious, i can't go through them item by item.  Let's just say I was very impressed by most of the things there.

With that said, there are some things to avoid:

1. The asian noodle soup station.  I love noodles.  I will never turn down noodles.  But at the noodle station you have a choice of maifun (rice noodles) or egg noodles served with chicken stock.  You can add fish balls, fish cakes, and vegetables in it.  The soup was bland.  The noodles were bland.  Just did not hit the spot.

2. Lobster Eggs Benedict.  What's not to love?  Eggs Benedict with Lobster.  Well, it's a poached egg (which was prepared beautifully), sitting on top of a potato cake with tiny bits of lobster in it.  And that potato cake was not good at all.  Mushy, bland, and overall yucky.  The egg on top was delicious though.

3. Mochi ice cream.  This was absolutely disgusting.  The mochi was hard and waxy.  Even frozen supermarket packaged mochi is superior.  Ever had one of those single-serve mozzarella cheese snacks that come in a little waxy package that you peel away to reveal the cheese inside?  Yeah, that's what this felt like.  Break open the mochi shell and just scrape out the ice cream.

There were so many things to try, and even though there were some misses, most of them were hits.  58 bucks is a lot of money to spend (by the way, drinks are not included in the price, so be prepared to spend more than that).  So this is definitely a luxury and a splurge, but completely worth it.",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,4,1,5,TtstI39iFQ3RXr6PAhYp5g

Our server was apologetic but since we already had our entrees in front of us we declined to have our appetizer come out after our main course.  My wife had a short rib noodle dish with mushrooms that was cooked well but lacked any seasoning at all - shockingly bland.  I had the generals chicken. It was good but not great and should have come with some type of vegetable but it was just white meat chicken in a big bowl.  I've had better at a third of the price at regular family Chinese restaurants. We had a side of eggplant which was awesome - definitely order it if you go there.  Because our food was so bland we asked for some hot sauce and theirs tasted homemade and really helped to liven up our dishes.  I had a watermelon mojito which was tasty but barely had any alcohol.  I almost sent it back because I couldn't taste the rum but decided to just not order anymore drinks from them.

This was a special birthday celebration for my husband with tickets to see Cirque du Soleil ""O"". Online the choices were shrimp salad, citrus chicken, or clam soup for starters and roasted duck eggplant, prime beef tenderloin, spicy prawns, or steamed lobster ($9.88 supplemental) for dinner, with dessert of the day. Sounded great. When we arrived we were given the regular menu which looked nice. Our waiter was friendly and wished my husband a happy birthday. We informed our waiter of our dinner/show package and he brought us the special menu. Instead of what we saw previously, the offerings were as follows: fried eggplant, hot and sour soup, or vegetable spring roll for starters, Kung Pao chicken, braised tofu, or steamed sea bass for dinner, and tapioca or mango pudding for dessert. What???? Bait and swicth!! 

We had the fried eggplant, hot and sour soup, braised tofu, sea bass, and the two puddings. We were refused a substitution of ice cream mochi for dessert. (Funny that Japanese dessert was even on the menu...) With the exception of the sea bass, everything else was marginal at best and I could have gotten them at my local Chinese takeout in Massachusetts. I'm Asian and I know great Asian cuisine... This was not it. For a $50 dinner voucher per person my husband and I felt cheated and tricked. 

I also felt that after or waiter learned of our dinner package status the service and attitude changed. This was after we already ordered $50 worth of cocktails and bottled water!  We did a similar dinner show package for the Beatles Love and Heritage Steakhouse at the Mirage two days earlier which was out of this world and the Prix Fixe menu was exactly as advertised.

If you're looking for a review for Jasmine's regular cuisine, this is not it. However, if you're looking for a review of their weekly Sunday Brunch, you're in the right place. 

From Eggs Benedict (traditional or with lobster), to sushi and the meat carving stations, this place is five star all the way!  Tantalize your tastebuds with their omelets, prime rib, lamb, meet and cheese selections, or (my personal favorite) the duck!  From the friendly and outstanding customer service to the delectable food, there isn't a bad thing to say about Jasmine's Sunday Bruch. Oh, and did I mention you get a prime view of the Bellagio Fountains that entertain you every 15 minutes?  Priceless!

Ok, compared to the pathetic and crappy Chinese food outside of the hotels, I would say this is much better. But as someone who is familiar with what quality & authentic Chinese food should be, I think food here is just mediocre. Do not come here because you want and are expecting fine Chinese food. Come here because you want a nice comfy setting with excellent service and edible Chinese food and because you don't mind spending some big bucks.

Maybe this restaurant needed to dumb down the food to accommodate the wide variety of guests in Las Vegas.    Maybe we just ordered dishes that were too simple (other reviewers seemed to like the Peking Duck but we didn't order it).

While they couldn't guarantee this, I showed up that day with the perfect table with a perfect fountain view, right next to the window.
2) The food at the buffet was spectacular.  Even my super-picky friend couldn't stop raving about the bbq beef short ribs, which were soooo tender and tasty.  Then there was the Peking duck, carved table-side.  Talk about wow factor for your guests! 
3) I have the biggest sweet tooth out there and the dessert ROOM at the buffet was alone worth the price tag.

Pretty sad for a bill of $150 with tip. To top the night off, I see they charged us for soda refills, $20 for diet soda for two.

The beginning of the buffet starts with a cold station of seafood. I stuck mostly to their salads and sushi and was quite happy. I also liked the soup station. I haven't been eating meat but my friends seemed to love the hand carved bacon the most. Sometime during the meal they brought out Pecking duck on steam buns. There is also a dessert room that had beautiful desserts, that not only looked pretty but were also good.

The dining room is surrounded on 3 sides by windows that view the Bellagio Fountain perfectly!  We dined on NYE so the water shows were going off, what seemed like, every 15 minutes!  That in and of itself made for an amazing experience.

Since we came for New Year's Eve, there was a preset 4-course meal (see picture).  I usually don't like to eat at places this fancy - 1)not enough food 2)I have a bland palate and don't like froo froo things to eat.  But this meal?  A-MAZING!

We had reservations for 8:30pm, but were seated a bit later than that.  No biggie.  The host took us back behind the check-in desk and that's when I saw it...THE VIEW.

The wait staff was impeccable, very attentive to our needs, new silverware needed, refill water, etc.  I guess if there's one thing great about expensive, fancy restaurants, you really do pay for what you get!

The meal was amazing, you can view the pictures for a ""taste"" but I wish you all could have tasted it.  I think my favorite dish, though, was the soup that was brought out in a fresh young coconut.  Best part for me?  I scraped the coconut meat out of it and ate it...mmmmm mmmm goodness!

Downside:  There was a photographer going around to each table taking optional photos for everyone, which were to be ready for viewing before the end of our dining experience.  We actually waited and waited after the check was already paid for her to return with our photos (that she had just told us 15 minutes prior that she was going to do).  But instead, we observed her still taking photos at other tables so as not to miss the NYE festivities on the strip, we said ""forget it"" and left.  I really wish I could've seen those pictures, though...

This was a special occasion so I don't know if this review might be a bit biased.  I'll have to try it again on a ""normal"" dining day for the real experience!  Well...if I have enough money, that is ;)  Pretty pricey, this one!",YSPwb5_9D96yNaB68psHYg,3,4,4,cdyZromeeHsGQmohAT5lvw

First of all, super rude staff. Then it took them about an hour literally to come out with the food. My girlfriend and I were so angry and hungry. We told the staff several times. Eventually the manager finally comes and apologizes.

When the food came out it was really bland and the meat was overly chewy like they used the cheapest possible cut of meat possible and decided to make it even worse by doing whatever the opposite of tenderizing is.

Oh but it gets worse. This restaurant was nowhere near full. I'm going to try and be an optimist and say it was half full... but literally it takes us at least 10-15 minutes to get a waitress' attention. Once we ask for the check though it takes literally another 20-25 minutes for them to get the stupid piece of paper to us. Did they take a nap in between?

So the manager gives us a chocolate cake as a complimentary dessert given how ridiculously slow they are. It is the blandest nastiest cake I have ever had and who the hell serves chocolate cake at a Chinese restaurant. Do not go here unless you want to waste your precious vacation time sitting in the worse Chinese restaurant in the world... 

Also the seats with the good view of the water in front of the Bellagio were empty the whole time but when we asked if we could be seated there they said no. Really? Once again the restaurant was half full and they literally decided to give the customers the worst tables possible too?

He asked another older gentleman there who very loudly said he would not ruin other peoples view (we were one of only 4 groups there none of which were sitting by this side of the room and there was no view but the blindlingly bright golden hotel across the street). He flat out refused. Was kind of comical. Server came back embarrassed and said he would see what he could do with someone higher up and inferred there was some sort of drama going on there. Told him it was cool and we would just scoot over for now. Had we not been drinking and in a really good mood this could have turned into worse experience. Food was ok.

We were curious to try out their famous Sunday brunch. I recommend reservations if you want prime window seating that overlooks the Bellagio fountain show. This restaurant is situated dead center of the fountains and runs every 15 minutes. So, A+++ on location and ambiance.

Their food is totally fresh and is constantly being replenished. Dim sum selection was small but, still provided enough of a good selection. Hey, If you truly wanted a full Dim Sum menu, you would've gone to Chinatown. Right? Remember, you're at the Bellagio. All of the items were delicious, as you would expect from the Bellagio. For you bacon lovers, they provide sliced bacon on request. Oh yeah, you heard me. You'll find it by the craving station along with prime rib, turkey and ham.

Their dessert room is off to the side. All of their desserts are made daily. Don't forget to select the variety of fruits and other dessert items to dip into their chocolate fountain. Also, ask their Pastry chef for what kinds of fresh ice cream and mochi ice cream they have available that day.

Service is top notch. You would think you're at a full service sit down restaurant. Waiters will constantly check to see that your drinks are filled and empty plates are taken away.

I was a little concerned after reading the other reviews, but this was far from our experience.

We went there for the second night in Vegas, as the mother-in-law's birthday dinner.  

First, the view is amazing.  Its right in the middle of the hotel on the fountain side.  Throughout dinner, you get the show of the fountains as well.  We got the middle table against the windows which just added to the ambiance.

For the food, we went for the family style (except the wife and I got our own soups).

The soups were absolutely delicious!  I got the Hot and Sour soup, which was just perfect.  The wife got the chicken corn chowder, which she has been talking about since we left!  The family got the spring rolls, dumpling trio and one more I can't remember.  

For the meals, we got 5 entrees for the group.  

The peking duck which was amazing.  They serve it to you in two courses - a pancake, which was incredible, and a lettuce roll which was not as great, but also amazing.

Next up, the General Chicken.  Just a great dish.  Great flavor.
Then the walnut prawns which were delicious!  The sauce was just so nice and flavorful.  
Next, the Kobe Beef short ribs, which were my highlight.  The flavor was incredible, the sauce perfect, and the beef just melted in my mouth.
Finally, we got the seafood fried rice.  It was good, nothing special, but its hard to stand out with the other dishes when you are just a fried rice.

For dessert, they gave us a special plate.  There were four corn muffins surrounding an orange cake.  The low point of the evening.  It tasted good, but nothing special.

Service was impeccable.  They were attentive and friendly.  Someone did come around and offer to take your picture.  We agreed, but then they sell the picture to you for 40$ a picture.  It was a special occasion, so we got one... but it was a little odd for such an upscale place.

We were seated quickly and given menus. After a few minutes Paul came to introduce himself and take our drink orders. Since we have been living it up all day we just wanted some H2O. Paul offered sparkling or still. We opted for still. Before we knew it open bottles of Fiji water were placed on the table. Still water to me is good 'ole tap water but not here. After the 2 bottles were finished we requested tap. 

For entrees I ordered the BBQ Szechwan chicken ($28.) and a side of jasmine rice ($5.) Hubs ordered the pork udon ($20.) he asked for a side of rice and Paul told him ""no, you don't need it with udon"". All of us were taken back and surprised he was told no. Maybe Paul is the rice natzi (like the soup natzi in Seinfeld). 

The food took about 25-30 minutes. My entree was pretty good and spicy. The boneless chicken (you chose bone or boneless) but had a lot of chicken skin. The side of rice was served in a tiny cup. For the price it could have been a larger portion it is an inexpensive ingredient after all. The udon was good but hardly any pork given. 

Prices are crazy expensive but keep in mind it is located in the Bellagio. The 2 small bottles of water were $8. each! That was $16. bucks for water. But what really got us irritated was that we over heard Paul asking the table next to us if they wanted sparkling, still or tap water. He never asked if we wanted tap. At the end we felt taken advantage of, along with Hubs being denied a side of rice just put a damper on our experience.

I wish that I'd been able to try a few more items, but what I did try was good. Not amazing, but good.  I enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, the prime rib, the Peking duck and buns, I LOVED the nutella and banana French Toast (no syrup necessary), and the shrimp, oysters, and mussels were very fresh and tasty.  I wasn't as crazy about the crab legs, and the lobster pot pie was not what I expected.  The lobster benedict was good, not great.  I didn't have an opportunity to try many of the Asian offerings or the omelette station.

The dessert room (yes, an entire room devoted to sweets), also didn't quite blow me away.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. Located facing Lake Bellagio, window seats offer beautiful views of the fountain show. Given the higher price point than most buffets in town ($55 per person + tip. Does not included any beverage. Juices are $6 and cocktails are $12+), you get a lot of less traffic/nose and a lot of peace in return.  The staff at Jasmine is very polite and attentive, which always helps the overall dining experience.

Upon seating, a tableside bakery trio consisted of miniature pastries, muffins, and fruits will be brought to your table (included in the cost, no extra charge). Later on Roasted Peking duck buns will also be brought to your table from their specialist.  Very thoughtful gestures in my opinion.

Jasmine Sunday brunch offers an exceptional traditional American breakfast selection as well as international items. Complete with an omelet station, a cold/raw bar, a carving station and an amazing desert station with an array of treats that will make your teeth rot, in the best way of course.

2470356,2009-12-09,17,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Chinese food for the affluent located at none other than the world famous Bellagio Resort and Casino.  Normally I wouldn't give a place like this a second thought with its suggested dress code and prices five times the norm, but when Lady Luck intervened I suddenly felt an urge to splurge.

The place is downright formal in its mannerisms.  When I entered the restaurant and inquired about getting a table the hostess greeted me and asked for my last name.  I was asked to take a seat at a small reception area opposite the bar while my table was being prepared.  I found the experience quite interesting because from the moment the hostess wrote down my last name every staff person addressed me as Mr. Y.

The server, the waitress, a floor supervisor ... everybody addressed me as Mr. Y as if they had written my last name somewhere near my table for all to see.

Once inside the fancy dining room with its gigantic crystal chandeliers hanging down I was seated at a small table with a clear view looking out the huge glass windows where three times during my meal the fabulous fountains of the Bellagio performed their artistic magic.  There I was enjoying this amazing spectacle from a most unique vantage point behind the fountains.

At Jasmine they pull your chair out when you go to sit down, they help to push your chair in once you are seated, they unfold your thick fabric napkin for you and they gently place it on your lap.  I was often taught those steps to be used for a special lady, but I never imagined having a lady do those things for me.

Jasmine certainly has its service perfected, but how is their food?

I didn't select any extravagant selection here.  In fact, my selections were downright homey.  I'm pretty certain this type of restaurant can handle the fancy dishes well, but I was curious how well they could punctuate the more traditional dishes I might have at home.

Three Soup Tasting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=CZ10iE9MQfGLqpLkyda3LQ) is a sampler of three popular soups, braised shark fin, chicken corn chowder and won ton soup.  Since I had run a long race that morning I wanted something soothing, and for me that usually means hot soup.

The shark fin soup had lots of strands of crunchy, chewy shark fin in a slightly thickened soup.  The soup lacked meat though.  Most restaurants will serve this either with shards of chicken breast or pieces of Virginia ham.  Jasmine didn't.  Keeping in mind that this was only a sampler there was exactly one wonton in a perfectly seasoned broth.  The wonton was plump with lean pork and a large chunk of shrimp.  I would have liked more.  Egg whites, corn kernels, corn starch and chicken breast bits made up the very standard chicken corn chowder.

Pineapple Fried Rice was served in a boat-like glass dish lined with a single lotus leaf.  The first bowl was served to me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=D2-2SonYOPnRw0FUCJ32EA), and I must have refilled my bowl three times in finishing the dish which combined white rice, egg yolks, shrimp, scallops and fresh grilled pineapple.

Ma Po Tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=ulN8otZyPI6LQQgH69REeQ) was made with the silky tofu instead of the medium firm tofu I'm used to with this dish.  I had no problem with that though as the dish was very good.  It was mildly spicy just like the waitress suggested.

You can choose from five or six different green leafy vegetables for your Daily Greens side dish.  You can even suggest how you would like it to be prepared.  I chose the Choy Sum (young tender greens) and asked that it be sautéed.  The vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=asVdBSNxFrPL8VSwyZ7j5g) were cooked perfectly with a nice shade of green.  I enjoyed this simple dish very much.

The food is a good 3.5 stars and the service is definitely a 5.  This meal left me nice and full, and the restaurant is a convenient two minute walk along the casino floor to the Cirque du Soleil's ""O"" Theatre.",8Aq_UdlsrjhBwGWb_U-xRA,26,22,4,Bd8Sg_mZYUEm0mACBL31QA

2947421,2012-06-23,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Buffets are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas and there are many to chose from all boasting about how good they are. Well, this one is for the Sunday Fountain Brunch. Firstly, being located in the Bellagio, you would expect excellent quality and a fine setting. 

Jasmine emphasizes both and the service is excellent. I was initially disappointed in the beginning when I was told they needed a reservation for a time which I didn't know about. However, the hostess said we can be seated at the bar instead and since my companion and I weren't picky, we agreed. The setting is beautiful with the windows showing a view of the fountains going off quite frequently. The selection was quite large and the quality of the food was faultless. Nothing was dried out or over cooked in any way. The buffet here is layed out with thought in mind. Portions are small so as not to overwhelm a diner into thinking you can't come back for it again and if you didn't like what you had, it doesn't go to waste. Save room for dessert because there is a small room dedicated to nothing but the sweet side of dining. Again, small portions with a large selection so I suggest pacing yourself. I tried my best, but I didn't even get to the 4 different kinds of ice cream or the 1/2 of the kinds of small tortes they offered. 

Final opinion: For the price of admission, I don't think this place was worth it. Yes, the quality of the food was good and presentation was beautiful ( I had my first taste of raw kobe beef and I liked it), but I'll settle for a less formal setting the next time. The selection was good, but I kept thinking something was lacking here and I have yet to figure out what that is. 

Tips: Make reservations for a time and come with an appetite. Casual dress is fine for brunch, but I would ask first regarding dinner. I'm assuming the waiter will bring your drinks as requested, but I was sitting at the bar for my meal and the bartender took care of us very nicely. This one is good, but I think the one in Paris Hotel is better.",3JIfGet5Unjgg6JztF8vXA,0,0,3,H43q3Rf_z9k2dcpRET9a7Q

For only $58/person, Jasmine serves some of the freshest seafood found in Vegas...the shrimp cocktail is amazing, the oysters are sweet and delicious, and the smoked salmon with creme fraiche and trimmings is memorable enough for me to crave! The condiments for the seafood is classic yet unique. The highlight is definitely the Peking duck, sliced perfectly with just enough sauce and green onion wrapped in a freshly steamed bun. 

When we arrived, the beauty of the restaurant takes your breath away. The front desk service was excellent. We had a great table right in front of the expansive windows with a perfect view of the fountains. Our table server was not great...reminds me of servers at Cantonese restaurants in Monterey Park. He barely noticed our table...definitely not the kind of service I expect at a restaurant of this caliber. But the busboy (young Mexican guy) was excellent and on top of things...his outstanding service makes up for the Cantonese waiter!

One thing I found disappointing was that soft drinks, tea, and coffee are all extra...this is brunch...make those inclusive!

The cold dishes were unique as well...foie gras profiteroles were a nice touch, the tuna cone was fantastic, and the cheese and meat platter was delicious (although it looks limited in selection, each cheese and meat was excellent...anymore selections would have taken away from the quality).

The assortment of seafood is endless, raw oysters, shrimp, crab legs, mussels, etc.  The table was also filled with sushi, and several other bite sized items.  
The hot dishes were not plentiful but excellent in flavor.  The breakfast bar itself has a selection of anything you could possible want them to whip up including eggs benedict the regular way or eggs over lobster.  Soups are made to order in front of you and the dessert assortment requires a separate room. The carver cut Peking Duck for each person at every table, my first taste of Peking Duck and we loved it!!

First, the Service was by far the most excellent we have experienced of them all.  From the hostesses at the front, and to our 2 waiters, they were all so friendly and helpful.   We had drinks at the bar before being seated, because we wanted to wait for a table in the very front near the windows of the fountains.  

The Tenderloin was perfect.  You could easily cut it with a fork.  The appetizer of sea scallops were the best sea scallops we had all week (better than Prime and Olives).   We also had the BBQ Duet which was excellent!  

Also, the best cocktail on the menu was the Lychee Caipirinha.  I'm a huge caipirinha fan, and this was a great version, much less bitter than a plain one.   I had to get two.    

Lastly, the view here is amazing.  You are so close to the fountains, you are practically looking down into them.  If you have time, wait for a table next to the windows.  Just have drinks at the bar until table is ready.  

The only slight negative, I think the bar should be larger and more inviting, like the bar at Yellowtail and Lago.  Open that area up so you can see the fountains while drinking cocktails.

Literally ""white glove"" service. The menu had an excellent range of options. You could get duck for $70 or less fancy entrees for $19. We liked having a range of prices to choose from. My husband got an eggplant dish that was the best he'd ever had, and I got the General chicken--not very adventurous I know--but delicious with huge pieces of all white meat chicken. We each got an appetizer (under $10ea.) and a fancy cocktail from their signature menu ($14ea.). We split a dessert. Total was $120 not including tip. Expensive, but reasonable considering what we got. Portions were average--meaning not small--but we were just almost able to finish all our bites. Presentation was nice. Seats were plush and comfy with plenty of space between your neighbor, so you weren't sitting on top of each others' conversations. I thought we'd just be paying for the location and the view (famous fountain show)...but the food really was great. If they relocated to a windowless corner of the hotel, we'd still go back.

So our story...visiting Las Vegas from Boston for the first time during the week, we were surprised how many places closed early since we weren't on weekend prime-time. We were caught off-guard more than once realizing at 9 or 10pm we needed dinner and found many places closed or switching to the late bar menus. We also didn't plan well with reservations because with literally hundreds of places to choose from we figured it wouldn't be an issue. So we wander around the Bellagio, tired, getting really hungry, post-show, and realize it's 9:50pm and we're desperate to find a nice place to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary before we leave Vegas. We view a bunch of menus, but not really in the mood to shell out $50 min. for entrees when weren't craving anything particular. Our last stop before giving up and hitting the fast food noodle place was Jasmine. The friendly hostess says they're open for another 10 minutes and would be happy to seat us. I figure we'll get a crappy seat by the kitchen and they'll be rushed to get us out. We had the opposite experience. We got a great seat with a view of the fountain, romantic elegant atmosphere, no rushing, and by the end, we had the place to ourselves.

Vegetarian spring rolls: these are the same from their Noodles restaurant. 

Hot and sour soup: nothing special

Main Entree:
Black Pepper Steak: it's slices of filet mignon in a black pepper seasoning. Thin layer of sauce

Sweet and Sour pork: went the safe route and ordered this Americanized dish. It's served in a pineapple. It's pork covered in a thick batter, then fried and tossed in the sweet and sour sauce with bell peppers and pineapple.

We asked if they had any specials and were offers a crab dish that wasn't even that great.  The would say the best thing we had all night was the Grilled Atlantic Salmon with Hawthorn berry sauce.  It was tangy (kind of like sweet and sour).  In addition the mediocre food, the service was not acceptable for a fine dining restaurant like Jasmine.  The waiter was impatient and pushy.  He continued to rush us throughout the ordering process and even got into a minor debate regarding the menu items with us.  Also, we had to ask multiple times to get refills on drinks.

3376239,2013-09-10,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"My new favorite brunch.  Owner is from Singapore and the staff all seem to speak either Cantonese or Mandarin.  Food is decadent but nicely proportioned.  You can get a taste of many things without feeling bad that a ton of food is going to waste.  Omlette bar is a waste of space in my opinion, but the dim sum, the congee, the noodles, the sushi, the raw bar, the sliced brunch offerings....I can go on and on.  There is a separate room just for dessert.  The dessert room has your standard chocolate fountain but the strawberries were as big as my fist.  There is an attendant just to scoop ice cream and sorbets.  There are mountains of truffles and fruit pates also.
Not to be missed:  chicken congee, braised shortribs, thick cut maple bacon, truffle carpaccio cones, sushi, oysters.  
It is pricey.  Two buffets, two cocktails and a pot of tea came out to about $160.00
This is not a place you can get into easily without a reservation.  The views of the fountains are amazing and you don't feel hurried or rushed out.  Overall, I'd go back again soon.  It's taken the place of my old standbys of Wynn or French Market bistro.   I hear the dinner service will be delicious and may try that.  I had a wonderful time and found the service to be kind and attentive without overly intrusive  (not that I'd ever be upset at anyone doing a tableside peking duck carving for me).  Even the China food is served on is elegant.  Make some money at the tables and come here.",S5dGv1vID1hoBZm2A9fK5g,1,0,5,H4N4DKwl4eWTEJ4icCI8pQ

We go to Vegas every year for Christmas. During Christmas and Chinese New Year's, Jasmine has their wonderful Dim Sum Buffet. There is a large selection of dim sum, steamed and fried, and a seafood bar with raw oysters, mussells, de-shelled cocktail shrimp (yea! i am lazy!!) and nigiri sushi. The carving station has one or two selections (beef, lamb, or ham) and there is a soup/congee station and a noodle station!! Love the noodle station. The broth is really good and you get to pick what you want inside your noodles which is served to you in a big beautiful glass cup. FANCY!!

Over the years, the dim sum buffet has gotten a little boring and not as good... BUT...

FOUNTAINS SUNDAY BRUNCH!! yum yum yum! Similar to the Holiday Dim Sum buffet but only with a little dim sum. But there's lobster cake benedict, omlette station, gourmet salads, raw bar, sushi, crab leggies, and lots of other fancy, delicate, delicious treats. The noodle bar is still there too, as well as an entire side room dedicated to desserts -- omggg chocolate fountain AND ice cream!!!! During the Fountains Brunch, each table also gets muffins, cookies, and jams.. and Peking duck comes around on a cart served table to table. 

The restaurant itself during the day is very pretty. Yellow and white  with white floral and butterfly accents. The windows look out to the Bellagio Fountains, and you get a free closeup show every 30 minutes or so. One time they even opened the doors and we stood right next to the water!

The service is excellent. Everyone is so nice and helpful. The waiter even put the coffee in to-go cups for us one time because we liked it so much!

Sure its a little expensive... $55-$60 per person for a brunch buffet.. But this is Vegas and its TOTALLY WORTH IT. You sit there with your fancy mango lobster shooter and champagne, looking at the fountains next to the strip and think.. now THIS is life!!

The only thing fancy was the 3 tier fruit and dessert plate they bring. By plate I mean 9 grape size cutouts of melons, 3 mini muffins and 3 jams and some butter. There is no bread to even spread the butter on.
I wish I could ask for a refund and charge them additional for my feedback on how you can make this awesome scenic spot the best brunch place in town with an awesome menu. It's super expensive and you expect nice service right? The waiter wasn't very attentive for the price and tip we were paying.
Don't feel important when you see the fancy designer plate setting coz as soon as you sit they take it away!!! What rubbish. Don't put it there in th first place and don't charge for an expensive brunch for this below mediocre brunch selection.
Almost forgot, desserts were equally bad. How about making fresh crepes you guys!?

3697068,2014-12-31,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Knowing my BF despises buffet style dining yet he's still a big fan of Jasmine, we decided to come here for Jasmine's famous Christmas brunch. I thought I was lucky when I found out Jasmine was offering dim sum buffet brunch from 12/25/14-1/4/15. As it turned out it was nothing short of mediocrity.

Since they did not want to take my reservation, I was a bit worried that I needed to wait in line, but they weren't all that busy to begin with on a Friday noon (12/26/14,) looking back that probably should've been a sign. I have no problem with paying $58 per person as long as they make it worth my while. And as far as the reviews about their lobster served during brunch, I've seen none... They did serve fresh, big, and peeled shrimps as well as crab legs (though not as fresh as the shrimps.) And the oysters were just plain gross. It did not look fresh at all, they looked rather staled.

As for the dim sum? They were just okay, nothing I haven't tasted before (unlike the ones from China Poblano at Cosmopolitan, those were great!!!) Poor dessert selection, only a few items available. I did enjoy the tiramisu cup. And my bf and I were pleasantly surprised on how delicious their crepes turned out, considering Jasmine being a Chinese restaurant.

Other than those points, I have no any recollection whatsoever about my ""special holiday dim sum buffet"" at Jasmine. The servers were very prompt to fill up our cups or clean the plates, but somehow it did not feel personal enough. My BF and I both were trying to talk to the hostess, servers, or even the manger, no one had cracked a smile once... Perhaps the fact I was there with a white guy sitting next to me was too much for them to handle? I guess I'll never find out...

Yes, I'm very well aware Jasmine is situated inside of Bellagio and considered themselves as ""fine dining,"" but that ""we don't take reservation unless it's for party of 8 or more"" is just plain preposterous. Are they not aware not everybody travels in packs? what about couples like us? More importantly, their men's room though designed nicely, but the toilet wasn't even scrubbed down nor clean... there were ""residues"" all around it (Someone definitely had some digestive problems before I got there, gross)...  

Overall, if you must have Bellagio fountain view with your dim sum and ""buffet style dessert,"" I'd say give this place a whirl. Just be sure you come with a large party, otherwise they wouldn't even seat you anywhere close to the terrace where you'd truly get to see the fountains...",8p9OUrGi0Jf_DNdA1GKxPA,3,1,3,B507sosgSvLhzwNs5lc86g

This three course meal was very good.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed and the service is absolutely top notch.  Everything is done well!

First off was an amuse-bouche of ahi tuna with crispy wonton.  Delightful.

Course 1:  Salt and pepper shrimp.  Three large prawns, wok fried, with garlic and sauce and served in three lettuce cups.  Very tasty.

Course 2:  I opted for the wok fried prime filet of beef with pepper sauce.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Served with the main course was some baby bok choy and a little oval of sweet potato and a small bowl of steamed rice.

Course 3:  Honeydew melon tapioca.  This is coconut tapioca infused with honeydew and served with an oval of mango sorbet.  This was a very refreshing dessert.  It was very light and very tasty and an exceptional way to end the meal.

Kathy, my server, was top notch.  I watched as she rolled the pancakes for a whole Peking Duck and she was a master.

Overall, Jasmine has an amazing view of the fountains, but the food was hit or miss.

The Crab legs, Sushi, Tuna, and Oysters were fresh and excellent! The omelet station was as expected. The french toast with nutella was ok, and the dessert room was disappointing. 

The Peking Duck was pretty good, but not carved tableside as advertised. The waiter simply brought out our ""allocation"" of one sample per person.

The pastries brought to our table were stale and not warm as advertised. Overall, I was very disappointed with any bakery, bread and dessert dishes at Jasmine, so if you enjoy bakery items I suggest you avoid this place because it was almost like they re-used pastries from one of their other bakery locations for the Sunday Brunch!! Very disappointing! I had the same day old bread experience when I grabbed a piece of cake from the dessert room. They do have vanilla, chocolate and mango gelato which was pretty good, and there are 4-5 toppings too choose from. (Heath Bar, nuts, Caramel, etc)

The meats were hit and miss as well. The Wu Xu style ribs were very good, and by far the best meat selection. The porchetta and other cuts of meat were average at best. I found most of the meats overall to be a bit overcooked. 

Another surprise coffee and juices are not included. I understand the exclusion of champagne, bloody mary's and other alcoholic drinks, but come on people ""include coffee and orange juice in your hefty price tag of $58!""

Exceptional and authentic Chinese food with service on par with the finest steakhouses - our waitress always appeared instantly when needed, and then promptly vanished. We enjoyed a view of the Bellagio fountains performing every few minutes while we dined.

We began our meal with the Lobster Two Ways ($28.88) and the Dim Sum Basket Trio ($18.88). The flavors were perfect and delicately balanced.

For the soup course we had a special summer melon soup - to American tastes it was more like a squash - and the broth was flavored with a few large chunks of pulled pork. It was mouthwateringly good, and it's sort of unfortunate that our waitress was surprised both that we ordered it and that we liked it so much - apparently most Americans are unwilling to try it. We really didn't know what to expect when we ordered it, but it's always fun to try new things and in this case it was simply a home run dish.

Entrees included the Chilean Sea Bass ($38.88), Kobe Short Ribs ($48.88), and Wok-Fried Tenderloin ($28.88), all excellent as well. 

I'm a bit perplexed that the overall rating is so low - it's certainly not an inexpensive place to dine, but flawless service and flawless food with an ambiance like this simply don't come cheap - especially in Vegas.",hV8oePSdVY6uhroaUGIqVA,3,1,5,lMpAajPo3yzJX7Q3oUPuXQ

Both were among the best I've ever had, artistically presented, and not at all heavy (none of the food was greasy or heavy, which Americanized Chinese cuisine generally is).  Some other highlights were the Mongolian beef (spicy and tender), and the Crème Brulee, which was presented in one of the most creative ways I've ever seen.

My daughter and I were in Vegas for her birthday on 6/18 and after much debate she chose Jasmine out of the many excellent restaurants on the strip. We made reservations for 8:00 asking for a view of the fountain. When we got there they didn't have our table ready but it was a short wait. We ordered dim sum as a starter. While we were waiting a spider ran onto our table! Really? The busboy came over and just looked at us like what do you mean - we showed him the spider ON THE TABLE and he just kind of laughed. My daughter brushed it onto the floor ... and we continued with dinner with no reaction from the staff at all. So - the dim sum ...it was pretty good but nothing special. 

We then ordered the braised spare ribs and braised efu noodles for the main course.   The short ribs were tender but the seasoning / sauce tasted overpoweringly of 5-spice powder and nothing else. The noodles were  glutinous and had very little taste. It was no better than fast food just served in an upscale environment with the very high prices to match. If possible the service was even worse. We sat for over 20 minutes without anyone asking us if we'd like another drink or any water. We sat for at least that long again waiting for someone to clear our plates and bring a check. The busboy looked like he'd rather be anywhere but at work and our server was very nice but clearly overworked. Even the hostess was very stressed when we got there. 

The restaurant is beautiful and the view of the fountain was amazing. Too bad the food and service were the worse I have experienced in a long time. Since I only get to see my daughter a couple of times a year it was doubly disappointing. 

The one high note of the evening were the cocktails. I had the watermelon mojito and my daughter had the special drink - don't remember what it was called but it had great blueberry flavor.

Oh...I complained about the wait but even terrible service and the spider didn't get us anything comped - not even the offer of a free drink.

Or there's those rare occasions when every restaurant near by has a line around the corner and is extremely overpriced due to a national holiday like Easter evening. Yesterday @ Bellagio resort, we were starving and was willing to go with the restaurant that had the least wait time to get a table.
To my dismay the staff at Sensi was booked for another hour and Eiffel tower was too. The staff at Sensi suggested Jasmine to meet our craving for fresh seafood. 

Although there was a wait it was nothing in comparison to the others. I didn't think to Yelp until we were seated, in the corner on the far left damn near hiding behind a curtain.  We say 5 feet from severe the waiters enter your order. I'm not sure if an unreserved table for two had to sit on the side away from all the center open tables we saw available, but that should have been que. Starving, we decided to stay seated.

Refills - Charge 
I've never experienced a fine dining that's simply an overpriced Chinese restaurant. Refills for small glass of lemonade (didn't seem fresh squeezed) was $6.00. I didn't know this until the waiter refilled my daughter's glass but put 2 straws this time. Why wouldn't they mention extra charge for another glass? 

Entrees- Al a Carte (Per the waiter)
- Lemon Chicken - $30 Dry, we attempted to drown it in the sauce provided to assist with chewing.
- Seafood Rice - $30! Just ok, nothing to write home about nor take a picture. The rice seemed a bit old, my daughter said we could have had better at our Chinese buffet near home for $10 less.

- Sides, oh there were none unless we count the leaf and 2 pieces of bok choy for garnish. I was offered the option to purchase steamed rice. 

Our bill ~$80
Here's the kicker...As a new M Life member, I was excited to show my card and get my points. I show the waiter, he tells me it's linked to my room. I ask how can that be when I joined after I checked in. He says I'll check, turns back around (remember were directly in front of the register), he lies and says yes it's showing on your room. Now I know Vegas offers a lot of wow, but knowing my hotel when I didn't inform anybody I was at Vdara blew me away. Then I get to my hotel, front desk says no I they're not linked.

They would make it one by one as my mouth watered, which seemed like an eternity before they finish making the 10 servings and placing them on the platter.  Onto the lazy susan it goes and one by one they disappear as your tablemates take one.  As it reaches your turn, you allowed to take one......ONE!

This will never happen at Jasmine's Sunday brunch.  I know i wrote a note so good review of their imperial peking duck, but this is totally different.  The brunch is about $60 and IMHO the best buffet in vegas.  Unfortunately my focus was on the peking duck, tsui mai and seafood.  I easily ate my $60 worth of about 10 peking duck buns, 15 oysters, a dozen shrimp and probably about a 1lb of king crab.  The meats are forgettable, as they were dry and too thickly cut.

The duck...oh the duck.  Its freshly made on the buffet line, by a guy in a suit who expertly slices the crispy duck skins off a whole peking duck and prepares it just like you remember....but you get to take as many as you like......YES!

There is also a noodle station where i think they served pho, but thats not my thing, so i cannot confirm.

I can confirm they dessert room off to the side, where they had a whole room full of dessert samples, a chocolate fountain to dip marshmallows, fruit and rice crispy treats.  There is also an action station that served crepes, i believe.

The service is impeccable and the lakeside view of the Bellagio fountains is beautiful.  Im glad i gave Jasmine another chance as this is now my favorite vegas buffet.",mX84lBw8jwS2uQqdgKu_aA,9,4,5,ElaJ9lRk2TAX2q4NAYAQgw
4641811,2013-10-24,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"I have a lot of traditions for trips to Vegas. As soon as I arrive, I like to eat at X restaurant, see Y show, place Z bet... not really for luck, but just because I like traditions.

For the first time in a while, I have added a new tradition: Fountains Brunch at Jasmine. 

I don't understand why anyone would eat at a Vegas buffet, including the Bellagio's, when this exists. Maybe it's because I already have a penchant for dim sum and other authentic Chinese dishes, but the selection was so much better than... well any other buffet, ever.

The ambiance for me was not that awesome, honestly - much like other parts of the B, it needs some TLC. To be fair, we had a table in a super weird spot, but I think that happened because we used VIP services to sneak in an extreme last-minute reservation (which is actually amazing that they could make that happen, so good on them).

I tripped over the table skirts once and saw other people do it multiple times. I wonder how often people go flying with plates of food in their hands. 

But I digress- the food was pretty good. I can't argue with all-you-can-eat siu mai and charsiew bao, ever, and the Bellagio actually makes pretty good siu mai. 

The western breakfast selections were not as good as they sounded (red velvet waffle? ehhh), but that's not what I was there for, so whatever. The important thing is that the experience was so good that we decided it ranked high enough to be a new tradition. There were so many things, like the make-your-own soup station, that I didn't even get to try.

Food was meh - fine. Nothing memorable, nothing offensive. Let's just get that off the table -- it was perfectly fine. I will say that every dish we ordered was brought to the table just warmer than lukewarm, but, it was fine.

The restaurant would get more stars for atmosphere. We ONLY chose this place because we -- well, *I* -- was fried from Vegas. Too much noise. Too many lights. Walked by this place and a) tables were available now, and not with a one hour wait, and b) it was relatively quiet. Such a relief on the ears! Now, the quiet is relative to the cacophony of the casino, right? I did suffer a bit of PTS from the constant expectation that the fountain show would start up again and we would have to hear ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."" Again. For like the twentieth time over dinner. (Would hate to be a server here for that reason alone.)

So, why the two stars? The service. Our actual server for the meal was just fine -- unobtrusive and efficient. But unfortunately, the only service I can remember is the sommelier. The man who, when my dinner guest asked ""What do you recommend here?"" responded with, ""I don't know. I never eat here."" And then, after a meaningful pause, added ""ever."" He was just kind of an overall dipshit to us throughout, but it was that one line that portended doom for our dining experience, and, is the one thing I will remember about my eating experience at Jasmine.",VEe1XTxBnjZUY31EjQNbrg,2,1,2,6JfxEZAWeP1jzaoAR58MnQ

4958340,2015-05-07,1,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Had a solid dinner on a Saturday at Jasmine.  We were eating early, as we were watching the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight (May 2, 2015) that evening.  We arrived at 6 and were taken immediately to our table.  Jasmine has a good sized dining room, but it's not cavernous.  There are some great views of the Bellagio fountains, and some not so great.  We had a not so great view.  But, the people I was dining with were either Vegas residents or had stayed at Bellagio multiple times.  So, not seeing the fountains wasn't a big deal to us.

We spoke with the sommelier first.  As we were getting many dishes with varying ingredients, textures, and flavors, she advised us to just order what we like regarding wine.  No problem there.  She was readily available for refills or additional orders throughout our evening.

To start, we went with the dim sum basket trio, duck trilogy, lobster two ways and scallops.  Our server informed us that each appetizer is meant to serve one person.  For example, the dim sum basket trio has 3 dumplings, so that's not really shareable.  So, to solve this issue, we ordered two of everything.  We had to cut a lot of it in half, but it worked.  The duck trilogy was probably the favorite.  It has roasted duck, a cold duck meat salad and decadent pan fried foie gras.  All of this was fantastic, if you had served me 5 orders of this for my meal that would have been just fine with me.  The scallops were good, but they were your basic seared scallop.  I was a little disappointed in the lobster two ways, the lobster was a little tough.  We liked all of the dumplings in the dim sum basket, my personal preference was for the chicken and mushroom.  But, they were all tender and the fillings on all were flavorful.

In between the appetizers and main course, I had the lobster dumpling soup.  This is served with mushrooms, carrots, and asparagus.  This fell flat to me, easily the worst thing I ate all evening.  Probably the worst thing I ate all weekend.  The broth was very watery, the lobster was so light it was hard to detect.  It just didn't work for me.  Another at our table ordered the wonton soup, and he didn't care for it either.

To eat, we shared:  fried lobster, braised kobe short ribs, general chicken, Jasmine fried rice, and wok fried udon noodles.  The lobster was very difficult to eat.  At first I thought I was just an idiot, but everyone at my table had difficulties.  Maybe we're all idiots, I don't know.  That's probably it.  Anyway, it was difficult to get to all of the meat, but what I did try I enjoyed.

My two favorites of the entrees were the short ribs and general chicken.  The braised short ribs were prepared perfectly.  They achieved that tenderness short ribs get when braised correctly where you feel like if you gave them a stern look it would cut them.  No knife needed, and really no fork needed either.  The sauce was thick and flavorful.  Absolute re-order.  The chicken was large and fried very well.  It was juicy and coated with just the right amount of sauce.  These two seemed to be the run away winners of the table.

The noodles were stronger for me than the rice.  The rice lacked seasoning.

Service was excellent, despite all of our dishes and wine, we were out in enough time to make the fight watch party.  There was always someone filling water or wine glasses, at one point, I asked a buddy to pass me the wine.  As he was passing it, a hand came from behind my left shoulder, took the bottle, and filled my glass.  I had no idea the guy was even behind me.  Excellent service.

I am not too experienced with good quality Chinese food, but Jasmine's the best Chinese cuisine I've had.  I'd absolutely return, and if it's your first time, reserve a table near the window.  Makes for a great evening.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,1,2,4,-IVtTs0S8vpp3wRuFsEfAA

4982561,2012-06-30,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"For the most part Jasmine is about what I expected - a nice ambience, romantic type dining establishment with very good service but too high a price tag for the food you get.  My review is for dinner a la carte, not the Fountains buffet.  Let's go through the good, the bad and the indifferent.  

The good - the service, presentation and ambience are all good.  It's nice to sit with a view of the fountains and to eat on fine china with non-disposable chopsticks.  The lychee caipirhina (sp?) was very good, tasting more like lychee and less like paipirhina, with a little kick but not too strong for me.  

The general's chicken is advertised as spicy but isn't really, it's like sweet & sour with kick.  It tasted pretty good and the portion was about the right size for one person.

The walnut prawns had some good and some indifferent - the prawns themselves were very good - eight very large, perfectly cooked prawns.  The sauce though was disappointing.  I've had this dish before and it is usually a bit sweet, with a vanilla cream type sauce.  This one was mayo.  I'm not sure it was anything else besides mayo.  It could have been worse - it could have come with fruit cocktail.  The sauce wasn't 'bad' but it wasn't 'good' either.  

More indifferent - My honey was planning on ordering a raspberry beignet type dessert but the waiter told him he should get one of three other desserts instead because 'those were the best'.  (They were all the same price).  So, he picked the white chocolate lychee cake which I had mentioned sounds pretty good.  It was ok, but not all that exciting.  The presentation was lovely though, I will give you that.  Honestly I am not unconvinced that the waiter wasn't just trying to sound like he was looking out for us by suggesting a different dessert, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  

The bad - the appetizer prices are just plain ridiculous, even by high-priced establishment standards.  The trio of dumplings is $18 for three dumplings, sized very small, small and average.  It's not easy to share the two smaller dumplings because there just isn't that much to cut in half.  They all tasted good though.

The scallop appetizer though was even more insane, two quite small scallops with a sandy textured scraping of sauce on top that didn't really taste that great, served with a smattering of small mushrooms - for $17.  It should have been advertised as a mushroom appetizer with a couple small scallops on the side.  At least my honey likes mushrooms - I do not.  So we each got one small scallop and he got some mushrooms.  A huge disappointment on this one.  Our local sushi place makes a volcano roll for $13 that is covered with over a dozen scallops bigger than the two on this plate.  Yeah, I know our local sushi place isn't in the Bellagio but still... not good.

Overall - I don't mind an expensive meal now and then, especially not in Vegas.  (We spent $200 and $150 on two nights in a row at Mesa Grill the two nights before we came to Jasmine).  But, I don't really feel that our money was as well spent at Jasmine, at least not as far as the food itself goes.  It's not bad per se but if you're going for a very pricey meal you want it to be good enough that you're not even thinking about how much you're spending on it and Jasmine doesn't really measure up there.",51Dg7npqsTegnd1ZDxVb3w,0,0,3,Z4ekc9p2fhpV8xXZbzWGBA

Sunday brunch is a very important meal in Vegas, it's one of the last memories that you'll have when your there so you might as well go out on a lovely high note. 

We got a table facing the fountain of Bellagio and the weather was beautiful. The pictures from the website look a little formal but I really think that going to brunch has the best dining atmosphere..it's really great during the day. 

There's so many things to choose from including -- prime rib / seafood / sushi / dim sum / noodle station / omelet station / and most importantly..peking duck!! I had three pieces and she told me I looked really happy..and I was!! 

Super awesome brunch and a great ending to an amazing weekend :)",1rlB-SWvDU5TnDnym2qeDw,0,0,5,3Xqx0z_gCJGqbXr1u60hEA

Rating off those 3 factors alone,  I'd give it 5 stars. However, when I'm about to drop $150+ on dinner for two, I'm looking for the food to be equally high in quality and presentation. We ordered the ""lobster 2 ways"" appetizer, general chicken, and seafood fried rice (with alcoholic drinks). I'm disappointed to report that the food itself simply lacked flavor and quality. My husband and I agreed that we've both had better tasting Chinese food from strip malls. I must stress that the food wasn't BAD, it just didn't ""wow"" us- and in Vegas, there's no reason why you shouldn't be walking away from a meal of that price feeling ""wowed"".

5279357,2018-02-22,3,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Lunar New Year Dim Sum Brunch review:

While opting to end the Fountains Bunch at Jasmine in favor of Lago's mediocrity remains a questionable decision it is with good fortune that both the Worldwide and Lunar New Year see Bellagio's gorgeous Cantonese Restaurant open during daylight hours, February's celebration of Chinese culture carried over from the Conservatory to a Dim Sum Brunch offering nearly ninety items ranging from traditional to modern and simple to those featuring luxury ingredients.

Beginning on February 15th and ending on the 25th, a cost of $68.88 at first seeming pretty steep for Dim Sum but in reality a potential bargain depending on appetite for fresh Oysters,  King Crab and items topped in Truffles or filled with Abalone, it was just prior to the Restaurant's 11am opening that a largely Asian crowd was found in line waiting, those first entering seated immediately but only parties with reservations allowed for a short time after as the room quickly filled with patrons wandering station to station.

Replacing seats along the center and upper edges of the room with silver steam trays in addition to live stations for roast Meats, Soup and Crepes, the back half of the room overlooking Bellagio's fountains filled with tables covered in thick linen beneath lanterns now hanging from the ceiling decorated with butterflies, it was shortly after seating that Juices, Tea, Coffee and Champagne were offered in addition to Fiji Water, after which guests were off to explore, eat and enjoy.

Clearly crafted to the exacting standards of high rollers who continue to select The Bellagio for its nearly twenty-year commitment to quality, the presence of Kenzo shirts, Louis Vuitton bags or Hermes loafers seen on nearly every guest from children to elders, it was after a quick trip around the room that one of Jasmine's patterned plates was selected and stacked with piping hot baked bites, the Egg Tart topped in Grated Bird's Nest immediately outpacing others offered in the 702 while both a Bun filled with Cream Cheese and one featuring Purple Yam were soft and yielding of light sweetness.

Next taking a look at Soups, Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque left for others to enjoy and the focus instead on fragrant Congee infused with Scallops plus medicinal Mushrooms plus creamy Coconut Broth studded with tender Tubers, it would be difficult to suggest either of these as 'better' as both were worth every bit of stomach space, as too was a more personalized build-your-own Rice Noodle Soup station flanked by traditional condiments.

Getting back to the Dim Sum as Beverages were topped off, several trays already being replenished with fresh items from a busy kitchen, additional highlights from the next two plates included a nicely baked Scallop beneath Cheese and preserved Black Truffles plus jumbo Walnut Prawns, bursting Quail Egg Shiu Mai and Rolls featuring snappy Sea Cucumber or Sticky Rice wrapped around a generous amount of fresh Abalone.

A bit disappointed by Roast Duck, the Peking Duck Bun station from Fountains Brunch apparently too good a thing to last, additional carved Meats were highlighted by two types of Pork while the cold Seafood Station fared well despite a limited sample, residual capacity instead saved for funky yet delicious Steamed Oysters in Sea Moss plus slippery housemade Noodles dressed in Pork and Cabbage.

Rounding out the two and a half hour visit with Coffee and Dessert it was as fountains danced to new tunes played overhead that a fried Crepe made to each guest's specifications was enjoyed alongside a couple more Dim Sum before moving on to final bites, the Dessert room of old now a well-culled station highlighted by the same Macarons offered at Forbes 5-Star Le Cirque plus Fruit and Chocolate selections from which a rich Brownie Parfait and lightly toasted Guava Tart were standouts.

*****Obviously not as cheap as Cathay House or anywhere else on Spring Mountain Road it would be foolish to suggest that Jasmine's Dim Sum Brunch even belongs in the same conversation as such places in terms of Food or Service, the once (or twice) yearly event in every way a celebration that is well justified for those who can afford it and, in reality, a fairly good way to experience Jasmine for those not willing or unable to break the bank during Dinner service.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,9,5,JIyYQmOop6x-PrymaPvrcw

The food was absolutely delicious and there was definitely plenty to go around, which is sometimes not the case in upmarket restaurants.

When we walked in, it was a little too empty making us believe it wasn't as great (never judge a book by its cover).... The bartender was preparing for a mixologist competition they hold annually in Vegas and made us some of his cocktails he has created himself for the competition.  It was fantastic!!! I had Kiss the Dragon which had some chili pepper and even though it had high alcohol content you couldn't taste it.  Talk about getting drunk fast without realizing it, right?

Well, I had the Lobster dumpings which were phenomenal, I wish I got the Shanghai dumplings but I was there with my father who is fasting for Easter and cannot have any meat.  I also had a cup of wonton soup, which by the far, if you've never tasted a REAL cup of wonton soup, no comparisson to what you get on a chinese delivery from home.  Wow!!! So refreshing, didn't have the greasy, oily taste you normally get from your local chinese restaurant.  Handmade wontons were incredible and plentiful!!!

For dinner I ordered the Mongolion Beef.  I have never eaten such tender meat in a Chinese restaurant.  Wow!!!!

The view of the Fountain show going on every 15 minutes was a delight, especially since we were able to hear the music that went with each show, which gave us even more entertainment.  I think it would be even cooler if they had outdoor seating, but there isn't... I guess because the water show is so close to the restaurant, it probably gets mist on its windows.",iOxu57kzbyqgTkxTX2vpgg,0,0,5,x3Nownz96GRCVeQsVL2Ing

5463892,2017-12-16,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Where to start! My entire Jasmine experience was very unpleasant. We chose this restaurant as were looking for Cantonese food and this popped up on many of our search results. So we went ahead and made a reservation. Even though we had a reservation, when we actually showed up, we were made to wait for a good few minutes before we got to our table. One look at the menu and we realized this place is way expensive than the other restaurants in the resort with much lesser variety. We went ahead and placed an order for Dim Sum Basket and Wok Fried Udon Noodles. The Basket cost us $28 but came with only 3 dumplings of 3 kinds - Like how does one have 3 dumplings between 2 people. LOL! We anyway had half of each dumpling and moved on with our shock. A Dim Sum Platter from Lemongrass which is around the same price comes with a handsome 15-16 dim sums and tasted much better. Anyway, the Udon Noodles was quite good and the quantity was good too. In between, a lady with a camera came over and offered to click us a picture. Thinking this probably s complimentary for all guests, we agreed, Little did we know what we were getting into. So she makes us do a couple of standard poses and then we realize that this probably is not complimentary. So we let our hostess know that we are not interested in the pictures but her response is that we have to let her know ourselves - Weird!! You have allowed her to entertain your guests and you cannot even inform her. We did not see her for the rest of our dinner, so we assumed she had been informed. We then tried to put the bill on our room number at the MGM and they were unable to do so. They did not even try to resolve the issue and we had to pay at the restaurant thereby losing all those precious points. We left the restaurant quite annoyed at the lack of good customer service and started playing the slots nearby and this lady who took our photograph finds us in all this crowd to show us our pictures, We found this very creepy and strange that the staff did not inform her even after we left. And how the heck did she find us!

My only complaint and it is a big deal to us - the tables were so close together.  Not even a foot apart.  We were lucky enough to be seated next to a couple who were arguing about the wife returning to Vegas for a bachellorette party and the husband wanted to come too.  It was a lengthy conversation and we heard all the tidbits from him wanting to stay in the same room - NO - to staying in the same hotel - NO - to him getting mad and saying he was taking a guy trip on his own.  We didn't need to hear all that and neither did you but I want to express how long this went on and how close we were.

I will say there food is very typical Chinese food.  Nothing special for such an expensive restaurant.  Portions were small for the price.  But I guess it is the Bellagio.  My local Chinese restaurant has just as tasty food for a lot less. But it was nice for Christmas dinner.

We started with the Cantonese Wonton Soup with Pork and Shrimp Dumplings. This was very tasty.  Lots of mushrooms and other veggies.  They did also bring some shrimp chips that we ate of a few of but they food came fast so we did not have more of them.

We really wished we could enjoy the ""Jasmine Experience,"" a complete meal listed on the menu from appetizer to dessert, but we're concerned about being overly full, so we passed and chose our own meal plan.  We started with the hot & sour soup & spring rolls. Simply divine!!!  Main course:  sweet & sour pork for my husband (served in a fresh pineapple!) and the General's chicken for me along with sticky rice. OMG!!!  I tried both and can not say enough to do them justice!!!  The meat had the most wonderful crisp texture while at the same time being tender!!!  Fresh pineapple in the pork dish simply melted on your tongue!!!  We also enjoyed two types of cucumber based cocktails that we also enjoyed greatly!

Now, the food and service were enough to justify the 5 star rating, but we haven't mentioned the atmosphere. I'm not a fan of oriental decor, but this place is simply beautiful, and the great view of the Bellagio dancing fountains just brought the whole experience to life. This was among the best meals of my life!!!",DZcIZ0zEj5AB9j4TG8LywQ,0,0,5,so58Ijx-Mfd4ej96SsfBoQ

Floor to ceiling windows makes the center lakefront-view more breathtaking.  Allowing us to have front row seating to the magnificent fountains, which was truly a sight to see.   

Being greeted and seated immediately, already started the evening off right.  Once seated, Paul our waiter for the evening, came over just as the napkins were drawn.  The whole night he was professional, informative, accommodating, attentive, with a nice touch of humor.  Thanks Paul.

On to the food. 

*Appetizers:
- Lobster Two Ways (the Oriental Salad was excellent, Wok-Fried with Egg Whites was just ok, lobster was almost non-existent.)
- Crispy Eggplant with seaweed pork floss (giggity).  Couldn't stop at one.  Had to dust the bowl. 

*Main course:
- Braised Kobe Ribs(good but not great. Meat was a little on the dry side. Loved the WU XI sauce though) 
- Chilean Sea Bass (perfect) 

*Dessert:
- Red Bean and Green Tea Ice Cream Mochi along w/ tea cakes.  Can't go wrong with this dish. Especially if you're craving Mochi. 
- Lastly, recommended by Paul, Mango Bamboo. Check out the pic.  It is as good as it looks.

For the main course, the chef made me shrimp with asparagus in black bean sauce. I really enjoyed it and it was just the right amount of spice. 

We had two servers. At first a very nice man was taking care of us and then it switched to a lady without explanation. I wish it had remained with the guy. The lady was very nice but a bit slow and we had to ask for the check or we would have been late to our show.

Jasmine is a sumptuously delicious restaurant fronting Lake Bellagio, thus showcasing the continuous fountain shows out front. To be honest, a place to eat and watch them was a pre-requisite for this dining experience. And our pick of Jasmine was bomb!!! (I'm old. Did I use that expression correctly?) The food and service were both spectacular!

I find it humorous how stu.... um, how people complain about the cost of places like this. And comment on how small the portions are. Dude. You're in Vegas. You're at Bellagio. This isn't Panda Express. Just how stu... just stick to Panda Express. And just a tip: the Chinese don't actually drown every dish in soy sauce. 

Chinese is probably my favorite cuisine after Japanese (mainly sushi) and Italian. The reason I'm not giving five stars is the taste wasn't quite as explosively yummy a flavor fest for my taste buds as I had anticipated. Was good, very good. But, there's another echelon it could have reached. Next time I plan on trying the Peking Duck. That'll be the true test. Can't wait!!",ft_9ozzYH6c_wnHisZiOWg,11,14,4,2qwz_9aRbVuijb5AS8nXuA

Prices can rack the bill pretty quick specially if you decide to explore the non menu items.However, you will be getting awesome quality ..fellas this is the real deal, the hatori hanzo katana of Chinese food, not your 10 dollars replica at the mall kiosk (as long as you dont order the regular stuff)

The food is amazing . Its freshness and taste was top knotch. Very unique and original plates are served in generous portions. This is definetly a sharing style kinda place.The dumplings are as fresh as you will get them and the wonton soup packs lots of flavor, however for me it was all in the entrees. We literally ordered every plate on the menu (big group) and can tell you that all of them were outstanding. I was getting karate chopped with flavor from every bite of every dish. I recommend the duck,Crab , Neptune pillow ,Seabass and soya prawns and compliment it with some Chinese broccoli and fried rice..BEWARE, if you are a panda express,  type of guy , you wont find most of those plates here.However, the menu has some items that wont freak you out and are catered towards the non Chinese guest. If you are into real Chinese food ask the server and the chef will make it for you 

Service is impeccable since we walked in . The restaurant carries a Fresh smell
and a nice waiting room with Chinese candies. They have a sommelier that will approach the table plenty of times . Your plates will be constantly changed and my drink never saw anywhere lower than  1/2 full.

This plus the decoration made the whole ambiance perfect . Nothing like watching the Bellagio fountains while having dinner!. I really  enjoyed this meal and it was a great experience. If you want to indulge yourself on a fancy Chinese dinner  this place will definetly rock your world while making a dent in your pocket. A very
well worthy dent though!",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,1,1,4,FQvp4JBDYxnB70mWgwUOEw

5768204,2012-05-12,1,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"I have to say, I am amazed at the good reviews this place gets.  But, then again, I know that the average Las Vegas visitor is all about the glitz and, well - taste isn't exactly the strongest of traits . . .usually.  I'll have to keep telling myself this because it is the only way to explain some of these reviews.

We popped in on Tuesday evening, May 8th, 2012 . . . the menu looked interesting, and since my Vietnamese partner had not really enjoyed the food offerings of Las Vegas to this point, we decided to give this supposedly fine Chinese restaurant a go . . .  I guess it should have been a hint when there was no wait and no need for reservations.  And, that's even with it having an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains right outside its windows.

(I went to their website to find the exact dishes on their menu, but they only seem to have the brunch menu and a special mother's day one - so, sorry).

We started with some appetizers - the spring rolls (which were bland, nothing special and weren't a far reach from frozen ones) and, we ordered a side-order of the Chinese broccoli - which was cooked fine, but again, nothing special - just plain, steamed with no seasonings at all.  Meh.

My partner ordered the tofu dish - (which is in one of the photos posted on Yelp.com) . . . . small square cubes of tofu in a sauce which was supposed to be spicy . . . it was not.  When my partner pushes a dish away and is quiet, I know it is below par (it doesn't happen often).  I am not a tofu fan, but I tasted the sauce, or at least attempted to taste it - because, frankly, it had almost zero flavor.  I've never tasted a more bland sauce.

Another member of our party and I ordered a whole fish dish that was fried (sorry I can't remember the name of the dish, but I believe it was the only fried fish dish on the menu).  The fish was fried nicely, a rather pedestrian batter, but nicely done - a tad overcooked, but at least fresh.  But, the sauce.  The ""fresh"" tomato sauce.  Seriously, it tasted like dollar-store ketchup with a little white vinegar and maybe a splash of Hoisin sauce.  It was definitely not made fresh - and was so ketchupy that it was really horrible.  

I want to say, I cannot remember in my years of eating in all sorts of restaurants and cafes all over - I cannot remember EVER complaining about a meal.  And, again this time, I sucked it up and ate my fish, trying to avoid the sauce - but, I really couldn't stand seeing my partner not eating anything after only a couple of bites.  The waiter was obviously not pleased, but he did allow him to reorder - pushing hard for the chow mien, which he ordered.  This dish was so salty that it was inedible.  (I had to later take him to an all night diner just so he didn't have to go to bed hungry).

The waiter was not happy at the prospects of THIS dish also not being acceptable.  He said he would talk to his manager - and came back and said that his manager said that everyone could have dessert (pre-selected, not our choice) - on the house.  We didn't want dessert and politely asked that my partner's meal be taken off the check.  Instead of responding - he kept trying to place the dessert in front of my partner.  When we said no, he finally came back and said the manager had taken it off the check.

Now, about the manager - I don't know if it was Mr. Roberto Liendo as listed on their website or if it was someone else.  What I do know is that he is a total coward.  Have the courtesy to come to the table and talk to us about the meal - especially since everything was so sub-par (we did tell the waiter about the fish, but did not ask for it to be removed from the check).  Considering the prices of this food - anyone would expect that the food be extraordinary - or at least above par.  This wasn't even as good as most take-out Chinese restaurants.  

Oh, the place is beautiful - but, that's the only value to this place based on our visit.  A horrible experience and I would highly suggest that if you are reading this review while trying to decide where to eat - pass this one up - you can go outside to see the fountains.",ywYOA9ffPoc1gglUIFy5Ag,2,0,1,_UhTfxE26xe0LMQrMalZPA
5778764,2012-01-23,3,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Dont do their Chinese NY dim sum brunch - poor quality especially for the price. We went to Wing Lei but their CNY brunch doesn't start till tomorrow, decided to try Jasmine instead because they were open, and we regretted it. 

Same price as Wing Lei $58.88 (8 is a lucky number) but less choice of dim sum and taste was really mediocre. Also didn't like that they didn't have carts - it really was just a straight buffet. They had large quantities of everything in steamers, so obviously it was all sitting for a while. Even at noon on a Sunday it was only 3/4 full, and an empty buffet always means old food. 

I'm not going to bother going into detail of what they had because none of it was memorable. Best thing they had was this mango coconut pudding dessert. 

Service wasn't friendly and we had to track them down when we needed something. Unlike Wing Lei the tea wasn't included - extra $8 charge. 

This would be a 1 star review if it wasn't for the amazing view of the fountain. That really was it's only saving grace. Oh and I liked the high quality linens. 

So if you're craving a high quality/class dim sum experience, try Wing Lei - exact same price but so much better in every way. Jasmine was a huge waste of time and money.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,2,lecETkqWvKOPh8KbGeGL6g

5837903,2011-09-11,1,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Jasmine is an elegant, beautifully decorated restaurant with most seats having a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. Our dining table was centered and just one table away from the windows looking out to the fountains. Furnishings were sumptuous, with expensive fabric covering dining chairs. And, when Diane and I were seated, fresh red roses in a vase, along with colorful, Asian-themed serving plates, adorned our table. All food was served on fine china, and the silverware provided was of high quality. Restaurant Week menu selections were chosen for dinner, but augmented with soup. Overall, the food and service pretty much matched the ambiance and decor of the place. 

An appetizer of Peking Duck Hand Rolls with julienned cucumbers and scallions inside rice pancakes was a fine start. Although the two hand rolls were small (about one-third less than most mu-shu I have previously consumed), the tasty meaty strands of warm duck inside and the best Hoisin Sauce I have encountered contributed to a great beginning course. The Hoisin Sauce was very smooth, redolent of the taste of plum, and just slightly spicy. I could have easily downed another two hand rolls! Nearby I saw two uniformed staffers deftly cut up a whole duck tableside to feed a party of eight with Peking Duck Hand Rolls. Only the preparer who handled pieces of the duck wore a white glove--and just on the hand that placed duck morsels on rice pancakes before they were rolled. The oily, defenseless duck didn't stand a chance! 

A bowl of Lobster Dumpling Soup with potsticker-shaped Lobster Dumplings and spinach leaves and a few tiny mushrooms was presented with a delicate lobster broth that was extraordinary. Unfortunately, the Lobster Dumplings were somewhat hard, and contained little lobster. The small, round won tons in a cup of Cantonese Won Ton Soup that featured a good chicken broth with pork and beef were better tasting but not nearly the best in Vegas. I have enjoyed far better at China Mama, the Coronado Cafe at South Point, Dragon House, and the Victorian Cafe at Bill's. But, watching the fountains' water show from our second row seats while we ate enhanced our enjoyment of both types of soup. 

Our entrees were of good size. Eight very large and tender Jumbo Gulf Prawns were served with tiny crushed pieces of Honey Glazed Walnuts over an orange-colored base of egg yolk. Much larger intact walnut pieces would have been preferable, but this main course was still very tasty. 

Wok-fried Prime Beef Tenderloin with Black Pepper Sauce was served with a couple of shoots of bok choy and a large chunk of sweet potato that was suitably sweet. The ample lengths of well-trimmed tenderloin were very tender and cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The pepper in the brown sauce ladled on the meat was subtle but definitely present, because my lips burned slightly from it for a short period of time. Steamed White Rice was a little disappointing because the rice was of the short-grained variety. The addition of a few drops of first-rate soy sauce helped pull the beef and rice together. 

A nice surprise was the Honeydew Melon Tapioca dessert that was infused with Honeydew Melon and included as part of Jasmine's Restaurant Week dinner special. It included Coconut Cream and Mango Sorbet, and tasted like melon-flavored cold farina. This tapioca was subtle and very refreshing. Complimentary Rice Balls and Fruitcake Muffins wrapped to go were brought to the table at the end of our meal. 

Service was topnotch and almost deferential. Servers and managers stood by our table when we paid the bill and rose to leave, to bid us goodbye. This was a very fine 4-1/2-star Cantonese dining experience!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,4,UBNdMSwbNKzBTXX1j6K6_w
5841258,2014-07-17,0,ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg,"Jasmine is an elegant Chinese restaurant situated at the best possible location inside the Bellagio with a good view of hotel's massive fountain.  The décor is more French than Chinese.  The overall atmosphere suited my aristocratic taste.  This is perhaps one of the most posh looking Chinese restaurants in the world.  I, Dick Darlington dinned here twice for dinner.  Both times I enjoyed myself.  They even have ""monkey picked"" tea on their menu.  These tea leafs were picked by trained monkeys and they are expensive and always only found at the most expensive Chinese restaurants and tea shops.  Of course I ordered some.  Their Peking duck is the highlight of their menu.  It is hard to believe that right in the middle of Las Vegas you can enjoy good quality Peking duck. 
 
Some might argue that their food is overpriced.  However, it is not just the food here that you are going for but also the sophisticated atmosphere and elegant services.  For that I think that it is worth the price.
