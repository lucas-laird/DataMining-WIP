The quality of the chicken is excellent.  If you haven't been here before, you also need to know you can ask for extra toast instead of fries or coleslaw and you must get the canes sauce.  

I would give the service and cleanliness five stars too.  We have been to the drive through as well as inside to sit down.  The staff could not be more attentive or polite.  It would be rare to find another fast casual style restaurant that is as clean with as great a staff as this particular Canes.  

Not sure how they find their employees, but somehow they all seem to be intelligent and respectful.  On a busy afternoon, we received the wrong order once, they were sincerely apologetic, they corrected the problem quickly, and they were eager to make sure we had everything else we needed the rest of the time.  You can't ask for more than that in any restaurant.",dg1td1Iw6i2iYxBguSZdCw,0,0,5,tV3R_Gsrc9mg3frp87T-vQ

I was like okay until she elbowed me while passing me like that's definitely not acceptable. I didn't catch her name but she had dark hair I believe Mexican and a little big.

I had a problem with my order at this Cane's previously.  We went back and the fixed it, no problem a month or so ago.  Today my husband went in and ordered some food to go.  The manager personally delivered it to his table and asked that he check my food right away.  Not thinking twice, he advised him that it wasn't needed and he was sure the food was fine.  He kept insisting, and he was asked to leave the table.  Suspicious, my husband checked the order and found spit on his fries.

When he brings this to the attention of the staff, the manager REFUSED to refund his money and threatened to call the cops on him.

I had not eaten anything since breakfast so I thought I was starving and ordered the Caniac combo and got extra fries instead of coleslaw.  Boy was I wrong I barely could eat half of it because I guess I wasn't as hungry as I thought.  But none the less I had leftovers for the next day. 

There was a bit of a line and I could tell this particular canes probably gets really crowded because they had cones set up directing you to the drive thru.  There were a few cars ahead of me but the line went fairly quickly so the wait wasn't too bad.  The service was pretty damn awesome, friendly, and very attentive. 

Now down to the food.  OMG the food was absolutely perfect!  My chicken was fresh hot, my fries were fresh and hot, and my bread was cooked so perfectly.  I am not much of a bread person but the toast was out of this world.  The chicken strips were HUGE and meaty and you can tell it was all white meat.  Since I am a french fry head the fries were good but I just wish they had the thicker crinkle cut fries instead of the thin crinkle cut fries.  But they were still good. 

I do recommend this place as they have excellent service, delicious food, and very well organized.  Now need to fill my survey out to see if I can win Cane's for a year.  :-)",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,4,u00VLSFoVE9Ot2ia3kVAow

I've noticed this before on the finger and box combo and the difference between the menu posted and the receipt is even more than thirty cents. It's a shame I'm having to give it 3 stars because their food deserves 5 stars. The drive thru here is also really slow and all the other times I have come the line has been wrapped all around the building taking 20 mins even before you place your order. The line wasn't as bad this time as it has been all the other times I've gone but still it's not ""fast"" food by any means. They should fix the prices they have listed on the menu. The prices are still affordable I just don't like being lied to about them. the sign says the sandwich combo is $5.99 and then the receipt says it's $6.29 before tax and then after tax it's $6.80. I mentioned the price discrepancy with the guy who charged me at the first window on a previous visit and he told me that it's good quality chicken and kind of gave me a look like I can't believe you are complaining about this you cheap mf.

First time eating at Raising Canes. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in. We were greeted by friendly faces and the decor was cute. It didn't feel like a fast food restaurant. 

I told the guy at the register we needed a second to browse the menu because it was our first time here. 
The manager? William over heard me and took time out to sell Raising Canes freshly cooked food and fresh squeezed lemonade. What a nice guy. 

Everything he told us is correct. You can tell everything was made fresh not frozen. We ordered the 3 piece tender combo. It came with crinkled cut fries and Texas toast.

Lettuce on my husband's sandwich - he said it looked like it must be expired because it was brown and limp

Here's why I like Raising Cane's:  the chicken takes like lightly-breaded and seasoned chicken, rather than lots of heavy breading and seasoning masking the chicken.  If I want bread and seasoning, I'll buy croutons.  When I want well-prepared chicken strips, I'll buy Cane's.  The sauce:  nothing to rave about but it's very tasty and still mild enough that it doesn't bury the fresh and hot flavor of the chicken.  The slaw is also delicious, and they give you just enough that it satisfies (and might leave you wanting just a little more.

What's also nice is the ample fries (more than I could, or should eat).  They're not the best fries you can find, but they're as hot and fresh as the chicken.  A nice side that doesn't steal your attention from the chicken strips.  And the Texas Toast.  It's good, but doesn't do much for me.  I don't care though because I'm not there for the toast.  (See the earlier crouton comment.)  It's a nice complement to the meal though.

Not sure what else to tell you other than if you're a fan of chicken strips and haven't tried Raising Cane's, give it a shot.  This is my new favorite place to go for chicken strips.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,3,5,RKpiPF6eoL4bwE8206inRg

- Large drinks

The food here is good and always hot! Their Sweet Tea here are to die for! If you want less sugar for your cold tea, pour half sweet tea and unsweetened tea. It taste very good and not too sweet which is perfect for me. They also have the large hard plastic Limited Edition Raiders cups here.

The place here is always clean and the staff here are friendly to serve their customers. If you ever want to try or eat Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, try this location! It's not as crowded since it's near Summerlin.",fTt_rcnc-nNpjWaDrbvEow,2,0,4,PfCCAJIUsgZUKbPPhucfoA

I ordered a Caniac Combo which was really big it came with 6 pieces of chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw and a toasted bread. The chicken fingers were big portions I only ended up eating three.

It was ok and their signature sauce was good. For a fast food meal I thought it was good. If I wanted some chicken tenders I would probably go here instead of other fast food chains just because for the price I get better and bigger piece of chicken. 

I was disappointed though I was not offered for a Caniac Club card and that's just me I like joining rewards club and now I have to wait and ask for it the next time I visit.",KpzBuLOzRq6cOWc7z7Qw8g,0,0,3,OvxwqAFQdC60U3XUsXI1_w

Nothing noteworthy but it's bread toasted with butter. That's not what I came there for anyway. Then I tried the chicken. The coating wasn't even, appeared light in color, and looked wet. At first I thought it was grease but it was actually just moisture from inside the styrofoam container. The chicken was flavorless. This is the first time I've ever had chicken that tasted like nothing, not even chicken. I dipped it in the Cane's sauce. That made it tolerable. I tried the fries next. They were limp, pale, and also appeared wet. They were devoid of any potato flavor and were unsalted. The moisture on them was also ""sweat"" from the inside of the container. I put the food down and ran some errands. When I got home I threw it away. The best way to describe this food is a combination of hospital cafeteria and old buffet food.

I went inside and ordered the Box combo which is four chicken strips, some fries, cole slaw, a piece of Texas toast and a regular size drink.  

After ordering, I was given a paper cup for my drink and there was some ice put in the cup before giving it to me.  I took a seat and I watched as almost every person dumped their ice into the grate on the Coke machine.  At one point, an employee brought a pitcher of hot water and melted the ice that had been dumped there.  The ice machine was working so I don't understand the need to give you a cup with some ice in it already.

In a brief time, my name was called out and I indicated where I was and the basket was brought to me.  The chicken tenders were cooked well and the chicken was very moist.  The fries are standard--nothing special.  The cole slaw is OK.  For me, they could leave off the Texas toast.

This location is better than any other locations in Vegas. It's clean and the servers are all nice. I was carrying 3 boxes and 3 drinks and one server offered to help. Such a nice girl. 

This location just opened up, so there are so many people on drive thru line. So if the drive thru line is backed up all the way down to the gas station, just walk in and get your orders to go. It's faster than staying in the line for drive thru!",u_GLk2qMn7fK7eYkFEiMHw,0,1,5,FPn15eV7MiGoSyXU83nqKA

Tonight was my first time going through drive thru and I ordered my usually Caniac combo with no coleslaw & 2 extra sauces. I didn't think to check the box cause they always provide but when I got home- there's only a handful of fries in my box, and I have no sauces! I'm not going to drive back right now for my two sauces but when I come back tomorrow I will let them know and show them my receipt that I paid for it. Also my coke was an inch below the top- small things but I'm disappointed compared to how satisfied I usually am",mbGW1YJ6G2wa5A4smBbr0Q,0,0,3,CIrUXIPIc-z-C6LQD9wzyg
5122994,2016-04-01,4,GmGvbDABaGvcKe_jIDvq6w,"This location just opened today close to home and I hit their grand opening for a free box combo and also happened to be a lucky recipient of a much larger coveted prize (goodbye waistline, hello chicken from now til next spring-that's right, free cane's for a year). 

The festivity itself was a hit as they really pulled out all the stops for this grand opening...the who's who within the organization showed up along with a professional and friendly cane's crew (the warm faces in fast food commercials that you think don't exist in real life secretly work for Cane's) as well as the Mayor, Mrs. Goodman, and a radio station for promotion. It was cool learning how much this place gives back to the community in a speech given prior to the ribbon cutting ceremony. They do a lot for local children in need with their make a wish foundation and seem to treat their employees like family. It's no wonder they have a reputation that reaches beyond their outstanding food.

As for the food...I've long been a fan of the Cane's franchise...you simply can't beat the quality of the chicken they use, the oil they fry it in, and of course, their insanely addicting sauce. The combo box of tenders consists of a light golden tan breading that allows the chicken be the star of the show, some fresh crinkle cut fries always cooked in fresh oil (which tastes like it's changed daily) and nothing too heavy handed with the salt, quite my style. Add to it a generous sized piece of ""Texas toast"" and a side of coleslaw and you've got one of the better meals in town to be handed across a drive thru window.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,6,6,5,88A63etPYtFvHWB3f_vFMw

Recently I have been getting some rubbery/tough pieces of chicken, kinda strange. Not sure if it is the meat before cooking or something that happens during the prep/cooking process. 
I really like the way the fries and chicken strips go with their sauce, good combo.
The drive through can get REALLY backed up, it is not uncommon to see the drive through very busy at evening dinner hours.
Service is usually very fast if I go inside. The workers there are nice and courteous (most of them anyways).",Oa8EDDj5-_PVM5l5E-IYuA,0,1,4,yJ4udSuPIYgy4IcGTX9f3Q

No deciding here- chicken is one way at Raising Cane's & it's the right way!  Delicious combo options.  I'm not a chicken person, nope not even chicken fingers, however I crave Raising Cane's.  It's the Only time I do have chicken if any kind or combo.  The coleslaw is my absolute favorite! I will be honest and admit, I go here once a week order the large size of coleslaw and leave. It's addicting.  Yes, that dipping sauce they have is as well.  That sauce it probably why this is the only time I have chicken. No, no Texas toast for me- extra coleslaw it is!  I even dip the fries into that sauce.  Again, more coleslaw.  Then a chicken finger or two, dipped into the sauce.  No double dipping!  Extra dipping sauce as well- please;).",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,1,0,5,FCI6jtA9A61Sb0UyDFrzrw

Then we came to call it the dog-chicken place because there's a logo on the wall somewhere with both.

Anyway, I hadn't expected the chicken strips to be so huge. I would definitely come back just based on the amount of food. Yes, people are saying it's bland but I actually kinda like it that way. Thing is, they were soft and juicy and not dry which is the beat thing about them, plus it's not regurgitated chicken-paste, it's actual white meat strips.

The large toast things caught me by surprise too. Why is all the food so large? Those tasted good but seemed far too oily and bad for me lol.

Either way, staff was friendly and I think my family got a great value for the money. Would definitely come back.",6nXgmi-9TBBEVEyTKEeIsQ,2,3,4,4W2lV2axFyUGF0rkDaOWrw

I then said Caniac and it jogged his memory. Still couldnt retreive it via phone #. The person was not friendly and did not say thank you.  2nd window. I asked if extra fries were in bag, she asked for receipt, it was not added in order but instead charged for 2 extra sauce . She did not try to accommodate or at least apologize with empathy. She just said that will be $1.94.   No time to dispute as I was picking up lunch for my husband.

While I was driving to Trader Joe's in downtown Summerlin, I just so happen to pass a In-n-Out burger joint, so I told my pops that I wanted to stop by for a burger.
When I actually got to that In-n-Out joint, I realized that the In-n-Out was a brand new restaurant, and that the restaurant had not opened yet (they were closed for a team meeting), as they were still putting the final touches to the restaurant.

From there, I noticed a Raising Cane's restaurant next door...........being that I'm from da 808, we don't have any Raising Cane's out here, so I figured we'd drop on in to see what they had to offer.

Upon walking into the joint, I was stund, as I realized this place was pretty popular..........I mean the joint was PACKED!!!!!

While waiting in line, I looked over the wall menu, and I guess Raising Cane's is similar like a Chick-Fil-A, as they only serve chicken here..........frrrrrried chicken that is! (Which is perfect for me!).

Although the line was long, the clerk was very efficient & moved the line quickly. Upon getting to the ordering counter, I ordered the following items -

1. The Sandwich Combo ($6.28) - which consisted of a 3 Chicken Fingers,  Cane's special sauce, Lettuce, Kaiser Roll, Crinkle Cut Fries, & a Drink from the open soda fountain. 

2. The 3 Finger Combo ($6.47) - which consisted of 3 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Fries, Cane's special sauce, Texas Toast, & a Drink from the open soda fountain.

What can I say about the grub?

You gotta new fan here from da 808! The fried chicken fingers was OUTSTANDING!!! 
The chicken pieces were plump, juicy, crunchy, & did not taste oily at all! I really enjoyed how they did the chicken! To top it off, that Cane's special sauce was awesome too! Not sure what's in that special sauce, but if you told me it was crack, I'd probably believe you! Lol!

What an unexpected pleasant experience dining here! Should I ever visit the downtown Summerlin area again, I'll be sure to stop by Raising Cane's again!

To my friends from da 808, chance 'em gang! No can go wrong!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,22,22,5,89z12Grq9CfalBAUm0oXAA
