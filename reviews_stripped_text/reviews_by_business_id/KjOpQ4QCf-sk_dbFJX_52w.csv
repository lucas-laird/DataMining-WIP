First met Marlyn at a Farmers Market awhile back and the passion she has for her business just oozes out of her, which is why we keep coming back! Knowledgeable and genuine owners!

1720115,2017-11-20,0,KjOpQ4QCf-sk_dbFJX_52w,My dogs LOVE everything from Fidos. It's how I bribe them :) they won't ever turn down a liver treat. All the food is made fresh with good ingredients. It's a family run business and the store is beautiful and clean. It is affordable and worth every penny. If you love your pets then you must try Fidos.,aiLktcB9pmGTSpGdfQrLQw,1,0,5,pPWaJmDHEyFms6vKQXV7vw

I bought a few packages of the beef food for my picky puppy thats 9 months old.. I've been mixing it with her current food and she just loves it! As soon as I feed her now she come running to eat it. Before she wouldn't care and just walk by and eat her food whenever she got hungry. Now she's loving it!,83dge8B00WK0BXvb4tSdnQ,0,0,5,WXO2rRu3eevxx2V9ZJW_LA
2465973,2018-04-19,0,KjOpQ4QCf-sk_dbFJX_52w,Fido's Kitchen is Awesome!  We just rescued a French Mastiff with skin issues and the foster mom fed her only raw food. We have never done raw before and were clueless.  We found Fido's Kitchen online and they have made our lives sooo much easier.  We have had our new pup Kleo for a week now and she is loving the food and treats so much.  Thank you for talking the time to explain everything to us.  The best part is they deliver.  The store is spotless super clean and you can tell the people who run this are really great humans who love dogs and are passionate about their company.,EHJKZ9IF8yK_63I6PO5oMA,0,0,5,GuCwwrmP4At11mbph5_l-Q

2957605,2017-12-19,0,KjOpQ4QCf-sk_dbFJX_52w,"We found Fidos Kitchen about a year ago at the Downtown Summerlins Farmers Market. Our puppy Yankeebeaster was almost a year old. He was a very picky eater at first, and just picked at it. 
We started feeding him store bought food & treats, until he began getting sick and throwing up. 
We started looking up pet food recalls and treat recalls. We found out that most of the food and treats that we had been feeding our Morkie had all been recalled that month, or in the past. We were so upset!! 
We started scrolling on Netflix, and came across a video called PET FOOLED. It's all about the big Pet food companies, and the secrets they don't want us pet owners to know. We couldn't believe our eyes, and decided we would never buy commercial pet food again!! (You have to watch this film if you love your pet!) 
(You'll also find out watching this video that most sicknesses and diseases in our pets, come from all of the  COMMERCIAL pet food and treats. Another thing commercial pet food companies don't want us consumers to know...) 
We went back to Fidos Kitchen to try it again, knowing he was getting sick because of the quality of the store bought pet food. We picked out a bunch to try, as well as some homemade chicken jerky. They also have seasonal ones, that change for the seasons. He absolutely LOVES it now!! 
We are so excited to have Fidos Kitchen to go to now. The owner is just great, and very knowledgeable about everything she makes and sells. As well as her staff, that always helps us when she's not there. We can't say enough about what this homemade food means to us. Our dog just loves all of them now, and is so much happier and healthier! The prices are very reasonable, and having peace of mind that our pets are eating quality meals is the best feeling ever.
 Thank you Fidos Kitchen for making such amazingly healthy food for our dog! We truly appreciate your local small business, that we know we can love and trust!!

Note: They're also thinking about possibly making a homemade cat food. We're crossing our fingers, because we also have a cat names Boots that we love. He's currently on Tiki Cat brand. A quality brand, but it's not homemade.",g8apynx5oO_Lfde_dCdsXQ,2,0,5,TVx1XOdLP5k3iBF2U1QZcw

I'm so glad I found Fidos Kitchen the owners are wonderful and are passionate about what they do to offer healthier alternatives for pet food.. They also go to Farmer's  Markets throughout  the city so I'd call them and see where/days if their store location is far from you,  it's worth it :)",c5m1kD5SY0OvMRSZA1pgGw,0,0,5,2XMmm_cO1xCP8vOpuU9qfA

They were using actual chicken to make the chicken jerky!! I know that sounds stupid but I always worry what is actually in store bought treats!

They just recently opened so, they only had a few items in their fridge/freezer. It's a good sign that they don't mass-produce their product. Their dog food are freshly made in house. They were in the process of making some when we came in.

The ingredients they use are all natural. Salmon, rice, sweet potatoes, etc. I remember when I was little and that's what we would feed our fur babies and none of the pre-packed pellets and wet chunks of unidentifiable gunk in a can.

Ralf enjoyed the salmon jerky and the punkin balls. They have meal plans for your pups. The guys here are very helpful. They have some cute puppy paintings hanging on the walls. Check this place out and get some treats for your pooch!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,5,7,4,wyHa3r7fMaMgUTK6DxKjQw
