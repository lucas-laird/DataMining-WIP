I have noticed that Hispanics served ahead of me are very, very well compensated. When I order the same plate and same entree items, my container is decidedly, noticeably less full.  The first time, it was odd.  The second time, it was bothersome.  Friday, the third time, I was mad.  So, I would recommend this location as clean with food that is usually fresh.  For equality of service and equity, though, I recommend only for Hispanics!",KJiC5jGMVZWEKfFRYMXbuw,0,0,1,6ctTPLXMSnelAKelXgIkKQ

I come here on my lunch break but by the time it is almost done my lunch is over! Its really upseting, this is my favorite store. The lines are also so long! I hope this store speeds up with more poeple, 2-3 arent sufficient enough. If nothing changes, panda express will be losing customers, like me.",Ca-hjHF5ZDDbaVJbmKy6mw,0,0,3,oFZI801DxiiU2iWwWi3_kg

1571093,2016-09-10,0,tSbs8i_9Hlaommupjgn63Q,Food is good but they might as well call their orange chicken spicy orange chicken because this place piles on the chili flakes... Kind of disappointing when you take a bite expecting their usual sweet and tasty chicken and then bam! The spice hits you and that's all you can taste and no amount of soy sauce can help.. Sad to say I'll never be back.,btPDZBV-Q6pvBRbLIfG-VQ,1,0,1,rdNwmbhVndXZgwYKE2C9WQ
1985044,2017-04-01,0,tSbs8i_9Hlaommupjgn63Q,"I usually like Panda Express. The veggies, rice, noodles are always good. However, the chicken, more often than not, is tough. The coatings are stale-tasting and smothers the tiny bites of chicken. Otherwise, it's decent fast food.",w9z4RxpTpGg4pOlr1h2k_A,1,0,3,Mb-HXG2hm6r3S1wsxb_suA

4244385,2016-08-20,1,tSbs8i_9Hlaommupjgn63Q,"I walk into the establishment around 10:20 am. And I was just thinking of getting some teriyaki chicken, I check the display and there's so chicken. So I ask the lady how long it'll take and she says ""about 10 minutes"" in my head I think that's fine, there's 4 people ahead of me anyway. 

The lady in front of had ordered an order the day before and was here for pick up, she had payed online and everything. The worker says ""oh I see the order in office but no one told us"" wow lack of communication for sure. And she tells the it'll be 15 minutes, and the lady is fine with it. To me, if I placed an order a day before to have it ready at a certain time and I arrive at that time and it's not ready I would think that's rather inconvenient. 

Anyway, about 8 minutes later it's my time to order, and I want some chow mein but they don't have any, which is fine. I get an order of white rice and I ask about the teriyaki chicken again, and the work again (the same one) tells me that it'll be about 10 minutes. But wait, didn't you just tell me it'll be about 10 minutes, about 10 minutes ago? She just tells me ""well they're still cooking it"" so I settle for some other options that I hadn't even set my mind to. This whole time she acted like she had an attitude, I understand you might be a little stressed ( even though there was only 5 customers in the whole establishment) but there's no reason to have an attitude and be slightly rude. 

All in all, they're lack of communication and poor customer service here really was a turn down for me.",B99p1hnRMogBVRFNdSxf8g,2,1,1,t2_xM1_1wQh8OjTQ5c4ZbA
