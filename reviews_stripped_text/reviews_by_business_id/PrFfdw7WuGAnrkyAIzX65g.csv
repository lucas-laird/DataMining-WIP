207285,2012-06-18,3,PrFfdw7WuGAnrkyAIzX65g,"I love Subway so don't think this is a knock against Subway sandwiches, this is a knock against THIS Subway.  I used to eat at Subway 3 times a week and since I moved to Southern Highlands and this is really the only Subway near me, I don't bother very often.  

I have never, not once, gone into this store and gotten what I wanted.  Every single time they are out of the cheese, or my favorite drink, or the bread I like, or green peppers, or whatever I want.   I have asked why they always run out of things, and half the time I am sure it is because this store is run by teenagers who don't care.  Twice out of the past 3 times I have had to wait for someone to go find tops for the drinks.  I can't drive home without one.  Is it such a surprise that you have to fill up supplies?  Why should I have to stand there for 10 minutes while you search the store to see if you have any?  

One night they told me there was no cheese...not because the store didn't have any, but because ""the other shift didn't fill the trays with cheese and it's not our job.""  I suspect that is the case with all the products.  I walked out that night.  I had 6 people to fulfill orders for and guess what?  They all wanted cheese.   Who runs out of diet coke?  Raspberry drink?  Minute maid lemonade?   And all at once?  Heavens folks!  All you do is sell drinks and sandwiches, make sure you have these things to sell!  

Well, it's not my job to do their job.  I sure hope the owner of this place sees this review.  This store is the poorest run Subway I have ever seen.  You cannot leave a business in the hands of ""it's not my job"" teenagers.  

If this had happened once...ok...twice...not so great...but 6 out of 6 times in the past 6 months.  I have never walked out of that store happy.  Luckily, the supermarket is next door and guess what?  They carry food too!

Update:  6/23/12   They are batting 1000.  Once again, they were unable to make a sandwich because they didn't have the ingredients.  The excuse....we were busy and it will take a while to make more.  Worse, I was told the aforementioned with a whiny complaint as if to say....what do you want?  Food?  Why should we have food?  If we are busy you should accommodate US and change your order to whatever we do happen to have on hand.  

Again...no adult in sight.  Just children running the store on their time not giving a whit about customers.   Perhaps this store is owned by a 15 year old?",8gmveJHFyVBCfEniOpdscA,4,1,1,nhkTSY8JrLwajU41Adm_VQ

Lately since I've tried subways new wrap I've been coming here a lot more than usual.

S. highlands location is usually not my go to subway I usually go to other locations even if this one is right down the street from my house because the service here is not so great. 

Anyways, I decided to have a wrap this morning and I get the same thing every single time,which is the savory chicken with extra lettuce and spinach (not even a lot, just a little bit more than they give) provolone cheese, olives, tomatoes, and the Caesar dressing. Today I had the worse service at subway. I was helped by an older man kind of bald with glasses. 

When I asked for extra lettuce and tomatoes he just shook his head and said it can't be done I have to follow the rules and I said just a little extra, so then he gets frustrated and just throws lettuce and spinach on the wrap while shaking his head the whole time. I didn't even ask for a lot he actually added more than I wanted. But out of his frustration he didn't even try to wrap it nicely!

I thought it was very rude and unprofessional. While continuing to make my wrap he continued to shake his head the whole time. I said I have never had this issue before I get the same wrap all the time, requesting the same toppings and just replied, "" well their doing it wrong!"" If good customer service and smiling back at your customers is wrong, then I guess I won't be returning to this location. I'd rather drive farther than come back to this one.

I understand about rules, it's just the way he handled the situation.  I almost didn't even want the sandwich anymore because he was rude, but I didn't want to be rude and walk away which I should I have.",U0K3TqRf5m8r6zsDDZsXDw,0,0,2,JqGwn5bz05F4nMmXsWTkZA

I'm only concerned on how organized they are on the line, the second person was moving sandwiches around and confused everyone back there. Besides being unorganized the line was getting backed up the client behind me had a bit of a language barrier and the employees seemed to be bothered to help him I thought he was answering correctly and you could clearly understand him. ( I know because he spoke Spanish  but his broken English was fine) But Tommy made it a point to make several jokes knowing he wouldn't understand. Making all other customer laugh at this customer. 

My 13 year old son was offended and said that guy is so mean. Not the experience I was looking for. He didn't even want to eat there. Said ""I don't want to keep hearing that guy mom.""

I'm offended for that customer. 

Suggestion: maybe have a bit more of customer service training. Not assume all clients know how to order at subway. Be more human. 

When I asked the cashier who was the manager he said I'm the Assistant Manager I asked for his name CJ and he didn't bother to ask why I asked to resolve my concern. He obviously heard the remarks made and didn't take action.
