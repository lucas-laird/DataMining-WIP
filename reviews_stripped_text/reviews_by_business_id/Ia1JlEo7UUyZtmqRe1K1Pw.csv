When we first walked in  at 1:15 the waitress had mumbled something. We couldn't hear her so I politely asked what she had said, and she very rudely and loudly shrieked,"" HOW ARE YOU DOING?!?!"" Then she continued to seat other guests that came in after us, even though there were plenty of seats available. Then we ordered two drinks, one empanada, and fries- a very simple order. The drinks were fantastic as always and came out very quickly. After a half an hour, we noticed that people that came in after us had gotten their food and we hadn't. We told our favorite waitress and she said she would check on it. By then, we had gotten hangry because it was 2:30 and we were hungry. Another waitress asked us if we wanted the check, however we had yet to get our food!! Finally after an hour, our original waitress went to check on our food. They hadn't even started to make it. Fifteen minutes later, we got our food. The empanada was plated very messily with thrown on lettuce?? The fries- which we always get- were greasy, all the seasoning was on the plate and not the actual fries,  and the kale sitting in a pile on the middle of the fries. It was very obviously rushed. We would've sent it back if we hadn't been so hungry. When we told our waitress, she said she would get the manager. Because we were filled with caffeine and rage, we would've had some words to say to him/her if he would've came to our table. He never came and our waitress explained that we could have 10% off or a free refill. We chose the 10% off because we did not want to be in there any longer. The 10% barely cover tax and we were a little irked. This is our favorite place to eat and we were so disappointed. We will definitely think about coming there again",hZJT-7MCeyGVVjfIBbvk8Q,0,0,1,AryXZmXK_jlZgOTHH7wF_g

ORDERED:
4/5 - Honey Vanilla Latte (coconut milk since I'm Vegan AF): Delicious beverage but unfortunately it came out barely warm, and a warm latte well... that's just no fun. 

3/5 - Vegan Empanada Sampler: Yay for vegan bites, mehh for the taste of these little guys. Lacked flavor and again these weren't nice and toasty like I expected. 

4/5 - Warm Coconut Vegan Soup: Flavorful, semi-thick creamy soup which would have received a 5/5 but I had to send it back because it was cold just like everything else. 

1/5 - Vegetarian Burger (minus cheese): I highly advise everyone NOT to order this frozen, Morning Star burger. When I asked the waiter about it he even said, ""Well honestly nobody has ever ordered that"" and now I know why. I appreciate them trying to add a vegan/vegetarian burger option on the menu but this tasted exactly like the frozen, off-brand plant-based burger from the grocery store, which is not ok when you're spending good money for a restaurant quality dish. 

PROS:
+ Cute location in downtown Summerlin
+ Even though our server wasn't great, the owners did act very professionally when trying to assist us which was much appreciated
+ Unique, tasty lattes (try the lavender latte w/ coconut milk)

CONS:
- Packed for Sunday brunch. Expect to wait for a table
- Server seemed to be having a bad day or was irritated with us maybe? Either way, it was clear and it didn't make us want to return. 
- All of our food/drinks came out either luke warm or cold

I really wanted to love this place and I'm disappointed that our Sunday Funday didn't include a fantastic dining experience. One day I'd like to return and have a completely different experience. Come on, I'm rooting for ya M&F!",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,5,3,3,-nMm39ANdz2bgmO5-66MlQ

But being that it was not convenient for me to go to.  I was happy to find out that there is now a second location in downtown Summerlin closer to me.  This time I had the iced lavender infused latte just as good as I remember it.  My daughter got a matcha tea and loved it.  My two younger kids got lemonade and they liked it because it was not too sweet and not too sour.    Another thing I  appreciated was how quick they got the drinks ready.  We were in and out in about 5 minutes.  They do sell food too but I just went in for drinks to go.,JNBCCsPLEwiyR13xbIviIQ,0,0,4,3oC5xLHLnDYguXYC7lXBkg

The latte was tasty, but not at the temperature requested.

It was exceptionally cold inside with two ceiling fans oscillating which just made it worse. This was pointed out to our server, however nothing was done about it even though he said he would advise the manager.

Cool place for those who like to IG and blog - beautiful, modern decor.
I used to go to their downtown location and I was quite excited when I heard they were opening up a new one here in DTS.

I really love their coffee beverages. Really unique combination of flavors. 

They really need to improve on their *quality* of food. I was feeling basic and ordered an avocado toast. Their bread wasn't even toasted and it was just 4.5 slivers of avocado and they used a third-rate salsa to top it off. Extremely disappointing.

I'll definitely come back for their beverages and for some more Instagram photos.",cGok9ycGn_HvZaht9xkyPw,18,14,3,6AUSDlURlCCfuLbxCWRXJw

Let's not mention the plantain chips that were stale and could offend any Latino country that loves to eat plantains. My advice is to stay away.

11:30am on a Saturday. My partner and I wanted a nice weekend brunch.

She: Chilaquiles and an iced coffee drink. Moi: Chicken Tinga omelette, hold the onions. [note: onions are not listed on the menu as an ingredient, but my Spidey senses told me to specify just in case].

She: menu said sour cream on top... none present. These were NOT Chilaquiles, they were nachos... a bed of tortillas with items on top and popped in the salamander to melt the cheese.

Moi: ONIONS in the omelette! Nuff said. No coffee refills. I had to go up to the counter to get my java filled.

I asked for Paul the manager to come by. He pulled up a chair and pretended to care (sarcasm emoticon). He said he saw sour cream being placed on her dish (effectively calling her a liar). He said their Tinga's are made with onions (as if any child knows this to be true). He nodded and acted and asked what we wanted. I said ""just to be heard"".

Some of my favorite drinks and dishes here include the lavender latte with house-made syrup and the turmeric-coconut latte for something different. The breakfast empanadas are tasty and the arepa benedict is a good go-to for a first visit, but I'll need to return for the avocado relleno and sofrito burger. I hear good things about the coconut tres leches waffle if you're into sweeter options. 

But this really is more of a cafe than a coffee shop, set up more for dine-in service rather than grab and go. I've tried to pop in here to grab a drink on my way to work and there really isn't a good place to queue up and service has been consistently slow and somewhat disorganized.

Yesterday I took my wife for lunch to the Summerlin location of Makers and Finders Coffee and had the most horrible experience I have ever had at a local restaurant! We arrived at 1:30 p.m. and was told that the wait would be about 20 minutes but we were not seated until after 2:30 p.m. The really strange part was people coming in after us were being seated right away and they were mostly parties of 2 also! I wanted to leave but my wife really wanted to try the Cuban food here so we waited. After being seated we waited at least 20 minutes before someone would take our order and after that we waited for almost 30 minutes before the waiter came back with only my food but not my wife's. He then tells us that they cannot make the dish my wife ordered because they ran out of mangoes! In almost every restaurant I have ever eaten in the waiter tells you right away if they cannot make a dish that either my wife or I order so that it gives us a chance to order something else and then bring both our orders at the same time. I have never had the experience of being served my dish and then being told that they cannot make the dish ordered by my wife! So we ended up sharing my dish because we did not want to wait for another hour for her dish.

They have a GREAT Chai Tea Latte, by the way.

After finally visiting today for lunch, I left disappointed.  While they do have limited inside seating when it's cold out, I felt as if I were rushed to get out of their restaurant so they could turn their table.  I really wanted another cup of coffee after lunch and maybe a snack but since the check was already dropped off and I was cruised by the waitress several times hoping I was done, I decided to leave.  I had a small salad with chicken and a chai tea latte for $17.  You can decide if that's expensive or not.

As soon as we get there, no one directs us, greets us, or anything. As we order our food, they say it'll be done it 10 minutes. Not too long right? All we got were a croissant and a bagel TO-GO. As we're waiting, 30 minutes easily passes by. By then, my brother goes up to the register and there was a young lady with red hair just staring at him. As he was standing there for a good five minutes- NO ONE asked him if he needed anything. He had to keep saying excuse before anyone would notice, which is ironic because there were multiple workers just staring and not doing anything. They tell us our food will be right out! As they're saying that, I can see our food just laying there and another 5 minutes pass by. By then, my brother and I are ready to leave the place without our food. Out of nowhere, a host asks us if everything is okay and if we got our food. I kindly said no but thank you, and shortly after someone right behind arrived with our food. 


After that whole experience we didn't even get to eat our food because waited for 40 minutes! That took up our whole lunch. Sadly enough, our bagel and croissant were cold. It made me so upset. Later that day I called, asked for a manager and told him my experience. I was really kind over the phone but he just kept shutting me down. I stated how I work in a place where customer service is valued and I just wanted you to be aware of your work environment. You know what he said? He said ""What do you want me to do? I know my staff try to do their best everyday and I can assure you they are a good team"" this made me so upset because he didn't even acknowledge our experience as a whole but rather just defended his ""team"". There's other better coffee shops in Vegas. You can most definitely miss this one, you'd probably regret just going here- like I did.",kOT_C9B-dGITaK_vpBeYNg,3,1,1,5b6e5pK1VAaUFG3LeUHnpg

I ordered the empanada platter (carne and chicken), which also comes with black beans, rice and a small side salad. Omg. Whatever is in the sauces atop each of these empanadas is HEAVEN!!!! 

I am also a huge coffee person. Like give me a drip line of that stuff and I'll be one happy lady! My lavender latte was amazing. My friend and I joked about how my design looked like a sad pumpkin while she had a super cute heart on hers. But, pumpkin or not... every last sip was full of flavor and worth the $6! I especially loved that there was real lavender sprinkled over the latte.

I was also lucky enough to be able to try some of my friends chilaquiles (I may have puppy eyed her to snag some)... and now I don't know what I will order next time I visit! Everything was just THAT good.

But what you do find is that these makers don't just whip up a tasty fresh cup of Joe. They come through when its crunch time. After breakfast and before lunchtime. Yes that would be Brunch time. All you guys with girlfriends or wives who love brunch and a hot French press in Downtown Summerlin vs. your regular pancake and omelette house vibe, here you go ! 
if you are  by yourself there's a place at the bar with power outlets or if you brought the pup with you they have a dog friendly patio too. 

The Coffee & Tea & Espresso Bar 
Cafe con Leche , Cold Brew

They even have a Slow Bar which focuses on quality for all the coffee nerds out there Siphon , Aeropress the works! 

They Serve Japanese Matcha Too ! 

We tried the Mexican spice Latte & The Honey Vanilla Latte while reading the menu. 

Now on to the food. 

I wasn't sure what to order and know I love me some chilaquiles, i asked the server if I was heading in the right direction and he assured me with confidence I was heading down a great path. The texture of the chips and consistency of crunchiness along with the rest of the flavor of the black beans avocado over easy egg you get the idea! I've had this dish hundreds of time all over the country and throughout Mexico  and these were great. 

We also ordered the nova lox Benny and it was delicioso! Heaven in every bite I'm getting hungry all over again just thinking about it!

The plantain chip triple dip comes in a sharable cast iron pan with maybe 6 chips with it. The dips weren't exciting so we didn't bother to ask for more chips, which would have had to have been way more than 6 more. Warm coconut soup was well spiced...you need to love coconut.

But I gotta say I was a bit disappointed, mainly because of the service. The quality of food is the same as the original location. But the service here needs some work. 

My boo and I came here on a Saturday around 3. It was pretty busy but there were several open tables. We were told the wait would be about 5 minutes while they prepared the tables. After a while, the hostess proceeded to take us near the back where there was a large communal table to seat us there. Why did she just assume we were okay with sitting there rather than asking us first? I don't want to sit with other people when there's plenty of other tables. We told her we wanted a table in which she responded by saying it would be a few more moments. 

I observed her slowly putting utensils at the tables and stopping to greet some other guests. I'm pretty cranky when I'm hungry so I was a bit annoyed that she couldn't just seat us. When she finally did seat us, she didn't even have utensils there. It was just the fact that she lacked a sense of urgency when it was apparent that it was busy that was irritating. I don't think the world revolves around me but I also have had better service elsewhere (i.e. M&F downtown location). 

Anyways, after being seated, our server was nice but was no where to be seen at the end of our meal when we wanted to pay to leave. We just wanted to get out of there but had multiple different people help us with the payment process. It was unnecessarily prolonged due to inattentiveness from the staff in general. I am definitely going to stick to the other location.",3mfYOXGi98d_heab6KZLtA,4,4,3,Jx71lJ79k1E_zpkMWJ_-cg

It's not worth the hype and i prefer other places instead of this one. It's hard for me to write semi negative reviews but the food was just horrible and over priced over-priced. 

The interior was modern & very hipster. They had cactus and simple decorations throughout. There was people with laptops studying and doing work and it wasn't noisy at all. They offer a patio with dogs allowed and sofas inside as well. It was a relaxing and calming atmosphere so it was a chill hangout spot as well to just socialize. They give you a big jar of complimentary water as well.

They have an ok ranged menu with latin food with coffee/teas. And the service was good, our waiter checked on us frequently and asked if we had any questions. So the concept is that we get seated then get up to order apparently which is a bit odd. 

I just want to try the other location as well and maybe update my review later on but it's really a bad experience but maybe downtown summerlin will be better!

They also have new hours!!; 
Mon-Thur (7am-8pm) 
Fri-Sat (7am-9pm) 
Sun (9am-3pm) 

What we ordered: 

Hibiscus Iced Tea: Super water down and little flavor 2/5

Berry Parfait: Wasn't fresh berries and it tasted straight up LIKE MEAT. Maybe the knife wasn't clean and they cut fruits afterwards but it was nasty.

I'm quite pleased that M&F, a downtown LV gem decided to open a location in the west side of Las Vegas at Downtown Summerlin. The open patio and charming lobby makes this place an excellent place for photo opt for IG and Yelpers. The main draw is their delicious coffee drinks with the Lavender Latte being among the most talked about drink. I personally like their Vanilla Honey Latte. A perfect combination of a smooth coffee taste and sweetness. The honey compliments the vanilla flavor giving you a balanced latte that is relaxing and satisfying.

I haven't had much of their food items, however they make a delicious Empanada platter and Caesar salad from my previous experience at their original location a few years ago. I would come back to enjoy more items from their Latin influenced menu.

We saw a few empty tables but didn't complain and just waited until we got seated. Two couples came in after us & got seated right away- totally irritating. After about 15 minutes of waiting and getting annoyed we got seated. It was pretty busy but not busy enough for them to take forever.

There's got to be a good coffee house in Downtown Summerlin, right?! 

Did this just open? Possible. They were bustling. This was noonish on a Friday, and I'm a little hangry from water shoe shopping. The sign outside said COFFEE LATIN BRUNCH. Bingo. 

I got a coconut turmeric latte, since that seems to be all the rage in anti-inflammation supplements. Coconut syrup (less cloyingly sweet, doesn't coat your tongue like cane sugar, and not fake sweet), coconut milk, a shot of espresso, and cinnamon, also reported to help swelling decrease. I can't say that's why I got it, but it was with some trepidation I took the first sip. Yes. That works. My man got a salted caramel latte with an extra shot. I took turned sipping between the two because who doesn't like dessert first. 

Breakfast was the aprepa (sorry for the spelling) benny. Pulled beef, hollandaise, and spinach on a corn fritter. God-D@#*. And the kale Parmesan omelet with chorizo. And two breakfast empanadas from the a la carte menu. So, the chef can do eggs. This isn't a difficult task, it's a time-management task. Packed restaurant? Chances are the eggs are going to be over-poached. The poached on the benny were absolutely perfect. Same goes with the omelet, the fluffy pillow of goodness. The empanadas, I could eat five of those. The special spicy lime sauce, I believe their ""red"" was worth drinking. Whatever fat they use to fry, it ain't old, discount canola or the like. Flaky, crunchy, golden, this is how frying should be. 

My only complaint is that the omelet didn't fair well with powerhouse flavors. Between the benny, empanadas, and two sweet coffees, it didn't stand a chance. The Parmesan and what little kale was sprinkled on top got lost.",39_8yhWlg9KiHXCpetJUBQ,4,1,5,D3EDLQ0xuuPpw9G_Ee3p9g

Service: 2 out of 5
It wasn't busy at all when I came in, with only one table of customers outside and a table of customers inside, so tell me why it took three workers fifteen minutes to seat me, a single person, at the bar? The redhead at the cash register asked if I was gonna order to go or for dining in, and I said dining in for one. After waiting for about ten minutes, a party of three had come in, and they were seated almost immediately by a male host, but it took another few minutes for a female host with short brown hair to finally notice me. I wish I had gotten her name, aside from the coffee, she was the only delightful thing about my experience. 

Food: 2.5 out of 5
I ordered the ""ripened mango arepa"" which came with rice, fried plantain chips, and balsamic reduction. The mango was so unripe, I thought it was pineapple at first. Pale yellow in color, crunchy, somehow both sour and bland at the same time, it was not pleasant at all. The balsamic didn't add anything to the already sour mangoes, and the mozzarella cheese faded to the background. The arepa itself was tough and dense. Would not recommend. The plantains were the only redeeming thing on the plate, and they weren't even the main event.

Coffee: 3.5 out of 5
I had the iced lavender latte with almond milk instead of regular. They make their syrups in house which is nice. I liked the little bits of lavender at the top, and it wasn't overly sweet. However, the coffee wasn't mind blowing, and at $6, I left feeling like I could get this drink elsewhere for the same price, if not cheaper, and definitely with much better service.

I rounded up to a 3 because the one server was nice, and the coffee is decent if you're in the area and just want to stop in for a to-go order, but with ignorant wait staff and underwhelming food, I'd rather go somewhere else for my aesthetic brunch fantasies. I still tipped 20% because I also work in the service industry so I understand how it is. I had high hopes for the Latin-inspired menu, but left feeling uninspired.

I really love the modern decor and their outside seating but that was unavailable. I was seated at their bar top since I was a party of one and it was a little cramped when they sat people next to me.  

I've had their coffee before and it is pretty good but overpriced $4.50-6 per drink item. 

I really want to love this place but when it comes down to it- I could make this food at home and the portions are small for the price. I ordered the Avocado salad $9 and added chicken $3 which sounded like avocado and corn would be the highlight of the salad, but really, it was a ton of barely dressed greens and some corn hidden in there. If I hadn't added chicken, I would've been sorely disappointed. Even with the chicken, I left somewhat hungry and disappointed I made the effort to go out to lunch.",j0rZxHHAp8mImZ1x7Clm5Q,0,0,3,2M1Y4O9u6cEwwwgh8EY8fw

The food is extremely consistent and I am a HUGE fan of their empanadas and aioli fries! I always get a chicken tinga empanada and another one! It's always so good and delicious. This time - I did get a full combo plate and to be honest, I should've saved the $3 because I could live without the beans and rice. Always have to get the fries and my boyfriend was in love with their overnight chia pudding! Even the table next to us was complimenting how beautiful the presentation was! We also did get coffees and I'm a big fan of the lavender iced latte with almond milk! So good. 

They still are working out the kinks but they have so many options that I can't wait to try here for my weekend brunches. Btw - great place to brunch! Definitely will be back to enjoy some cocktails!

I'm so glad they moved to DT Summerlin! Definitely will be back in the future! And do yourself a favor - at least get one empanada! They are so good and worth it!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,2,2,4,RoQ2yXh1-yzV2y-sKsKTLQ

They have a great reputation with their main street location and I know this one can catch up. They're still new but after a month of being open, I was hoping the operation would be better.

The negatives: bath-water warm coffee, cold food and slow slow service.

The Pros: great ambiance, nice mgrs, great location, super cute coffee bar, great flavor food, vegan/vegetarian & gluten free options, great potential

4 of us came in for Sunday brunch and they had a small 20 min wait. The wait took longer then 20 mins but we weren't in a hurry. After sitting down we were immediately greeted by our server with water and said he said he would be right back.  Took about 10-15 minutes for his return and he took our drink orders and answered a few food questions for us. When our 4 coffees finally arrived, we immediately dove in and were disappointed as our coffees were not hot. Only 1 latte came out somewhat hot, the other 3 were bath-water warm. We were so disappointed bc these aren't cheap lattes but the service was already lacking at this point and there was still a crowd so we decided to just drink it but every sip just wasn't as enjoyable has a fresh hot latte. 

Regarding food, the food had great flavor but came out look warm, never hot. Our hot ordered items included 2 soups, empanadas, veggie burger, and salmon Benedict. The soups were sent back and the mgrs were nice about it and when the soups returned, they were so good! So much flavor! Everything else had lots of delicious flavor but please note the veggie burger is the Garden Burger black bean burger you can purchase at the store. I buy these all the time for my house so I was extremely disappointed when I recognized it after my 1st bite b/c I expected something different and original. 

This restaraunt includes a walk up coffee bar window to order your drinks to go, a puppy friendly patio and they just recently started serving beer and wine. The wine is served in small mason jars and super cute.

I hate leaving a negative review, esp for a location I have been patiently waiting to open but after spending $130 for our bill plus tip, we left very disappointed. I'm hoping after another month of being open this location will be much better.",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,1,1,2,x3UGce1Bztlg30QHqGTQmQ

So when the Downtown Summerlin M&F opened we were over the moon to have a location closer to us. The first couple of times we went we were very pleased with the food,coffee and service. These last 3 times we have come unfortunately have been majorly disappointing. We order the same 2 drinks every time and they have tasted different every.single.time. On top of the fact that the taste of the drinks are inconsistent (which is odd to me, shouldn't the baristas be taught a standard way to make each drink?) the waiter has either forgotten to add a shot of espresso in our chai tea latte, forgotten to make it a large (but charged us for a large on the bill) or just given us a wrong drink all together. And I could go on about a couple of other inconsistencies with the food as well but I'm quite honestly tired of typing. We have come at least 4 times in the last 2 weeks alone but this will no longer be our go to breakfast spot. My advice to the owners if you read this is to better train your staff and cooks. With all that being said,I do believe you have a great spot with quality food and a special concept!

It was amazing!! Like Christmas in a cup and better. My friend had the hibiscus tea and really liked it. We shared the Plantain Chips & Dip, which was pretty good although I don't think I'll order it again, as I'm not big on black beans. 
Overall this was a great dining experience and I'll definitely be back for the Chai Tea Latte!",FTsRfaVbDUB6Sc6pL-J80w,0,0,5,zsVsJaI3ow0s4l8qH7rhew

My mom and I went here yesterday, I got the Nutella latte and my mom a non fat latte. They both were amazing! I could eat their food everyday too, the empanadas are my all time favorite meal. I will definitely be back. The service is great, the restaurant itself is so clean and well designed!",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,0,1,5,kkSphTh7WDmEcoaoeP5lJQ

The food had a beautiful presentation, and was fresh. I enjoyed it for the most part. I will have to come back and try some of the coffee and other food items. The decor was beautiful, and I loved sitting on the patio. Service was only ok. They left us hanging for a while for our box and check. Seemed like they were busier then usual. Otherwise a decent experience.",ocC1kDdcWg6hVaTDJssM-Q,0,0,4,Tos_FC4UkyvS49R6RvqVeQ

This space is beautiful. It's a Yelper and Instagrammers dream location! So many incredible photo ops.

Swooped in on a busy Sunday morning to grab some java to go. Ordered the Honey Vanilla Latte with almond milk from the lovely gentleman behind the coffee bar. Pro-tip, you can pass by the host stand and walk right up to the counter behind it. There you can place your order and wait on the comfy couch for them to call your name. 

Although the man behind the coffee beans was quick, I did think that it would be more efficient if they ran that coffee bar with three people. One taking orders, one prepping the cups, one person on the bar. I noticed the host was missing quite often too. This place is popping and it may run more efficiently up front if they had a host taking names and another host to escort guests to their table. That way, the host stand is never left unattended. Just my two cents.

My coffee was delicious. Nice and hot. Creamy and sweet. A nice little Sunday treat.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,30,19,4,BAnzcOXW1W4YkmTZZTXDjg

I wasn't surprised how many people were inside and enjoying their lunch, coffee or tea. I love their interior design. It is modern and trendy. Perfect for Instagram style pictures. Outdoor seating patio is provided too. I heard that their Lavender latte is the best coffee they offer and got it approved from a friend who came here with me. She said it had a great Lavender taste with the perfect balance of sweetness and espresso. I had a Hibiscus tea which tasted good, exactly like it should. Great refreshments to enjoy while being out with friends and chatting together. The only thing what bothered me was the loud music. You barely can hear the other person you are talking to. I had a feeling like I was in a club and not a coffee shop. That's the only thing that made me feel uncomfortable. In total staff was kind and friendly. Store is clean.",NbhMH4XcHylnROs4oUlfSw,4,3,4,T1WIUGDPg4NAz6n4PVdMMw
