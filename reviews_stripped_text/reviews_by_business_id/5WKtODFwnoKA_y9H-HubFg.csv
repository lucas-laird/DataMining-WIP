2859830,2015-01-27,1,5WKtODFwnoKA_y9H-HubFg,"The food was decent, typical food court style, so the following review has more to do with the staff. However, the sandwich was lukewarm and the drink was a bit icier than the normal consistency. 

The WORST customer service. The staff member at the counter was rude, unprofessional, and incredibly unorganized. I waited 10 minutes to actually place my order. There was a lady who came after me to pick up an order which she had ordered  earlier, the man had her go in front of me to ring her up first, even though I had been waiting 10 minutes to simply place my order. 

After FINALLY placing my order, I went back to my seat not far from the vendor. When my name was called, the man in the front rudely informed me that he had called me 5 times. I apologized letting him know that I had not heard him. As someone who has worked in retail, the CUSTOMER NEVER SHOULD APOLOGIZE. I am also not sure that this is the correct smothie that I ordered, as I was trying a new one and it is a lot sweeter than I would think their veggie would be, however I am not certain. I wish I had this person's name, however whoever this person is SHOULD NEVER BE THE FACE OF A COMPANY. 

For the managerial staff, whoever was working the counter at 12pm on Tuesday, January 2015 should be reconsidered as a staff person, if not completely let go. Definitely will not be a returning customer.",bigvoCOnbt9BGMLGs4dxQA,0,1,1,WxtYvvf6Def7Riyg3ME1cA

First it started off badly when I was the only one at the counter and there were three young women behind the counter and I politely waited for 5 minutes until I asked if someone would take my order, then a middle age male comes from behind the back to take my order and what I assume is his 5 year old son comes up and stands next to him, I'm ok with bring your kid to work day if that's what it was; but someone who saw me waiting could of gotten him, if they are not allowed to take orders. I ordered the chicken Cesar wrap and I have to admit that it was pretty gross. The chicken was mushy, almost like the chicken was made for a chicken salad or for someone without teeth. I though the wrap would have strips of chicken breast in it, but it did not. With other food court option in the area, I will not be coming back here",M6uDHCxhZybBdngFuBmrHg,1,0,2,_3U8KGcXjYIBKY2fFFiC6g

In A Sentence
(A) Tropical Smoothie Café® that sucks really badly, due to indifference. 

Quick Review
+   Location. Only positive is where it is.

-   Service is never good. ¡Nunca!

-   No breakfast until 8 A.M. (other than smoothies and other cold shit). I suspect is because they don't want to actually prepare the food they are paid to actually fucking prepare. 

------------------------------------------

I have tried a couple of smoothies, sandwiches, and wraps here. (Check the check-ins!) 

Service is fine ... never.

Now, what is major proverbial beef here?

I think they tell you they won't make breakfast sandwiches/wraps before 8 A.M. because they don't feel like making them. Automatic minus three stars for that.

Pro Tip: 
Don't come hungry in the morning. There is a Tropical Smoothie Café® a couple of miles east on Charleston where the employees will actually do their job. 

Pro Tip: 
Don't bring a survey promotion here. They won't honour it. Take it a couple of miles east on Charleston.

Possibly the worst run Tropical Smoothie Café® on Planet Earth* ....

Pro Tip: 
Just don't come here at all and go a couple of miles east on Charleston if at all possible.  

Pro Tip: 
Ask for the manager to be fired.

4054708,2013-01-17,2,5WKtODFwnoKA_y9H-HubFg,"First of all, this review is not for the smoothies.  The review is for the food. 

I'm at Red Rock at least once a week during the NFL season.  There are plenty times when I'm starving and want something quick that isn't their buffet, cafe, or restaurants.  So, where do I go?  The food court of course and this time Tropical Smoothie.

My first visit at Tropical Smoothie was a couple of months ago.  Reviewed the menu and saw that at least the pictures looked good. I settled for the $3.99 Chicken Pesto in flatbread. Since their smoothies are a bit pricey, I assumed that the Chicken Pesto was small. So, I ordered 2.  The Chicken Pesto was really good.  Melted cheese, just the right amount of pesto, and thick pieces of chicken. All in a heated thick piece of flatbread. To my surprise, each Chicken Pesto was pretty big too.  I was almost full after devouring one.  Still had one more to go and my mom didn't raise a quitter, so I ate the other.  Since my first visit, I've been here about 5 more times and when it comes to service, they have it right. Scary that they even know me by name and have my order started before I make it to check out.  

Move over Rubio's and Fatburger, I think I found my new go to food court item while I'm at Red Rock. I can't wait to try the other sandwiches.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,2,4,4,c8pzkgQj6gFI_PIpJuoBOw

There's plenty of other places to get something to drink. Try those places before you try this place.",79YDRNahy5g0FLE6C8cnRA,0,0,1,gMZLkzyN9MTTDkHFTEyY-g

4484725,2014-12-14,1,5WKtODFwnoKA_y9H-HubFg,"I feed my big-time gambling addition ($20 max per night, oh maybe a rare $40) once a week at Red Rock.  And most of those nights I have to feed me, too.  Where else is quick and reasonably priced but the food court?  Sometimes it's Rubio's, sometimes Capriotti's, and once in a while, it's Tropical Smoothie.  

I've never ordered a smoothie in my life.  Okay, call me un-American, I can take it.  But I have ordered food on more than one occasion, though have never written a review until now.  Each time I eat there, I'm always afraid the food isn't going to be fresh, because I almost never see anyone ordering ANYTHING there.  I'm happy to report that it is, and that it's also very good.

This time I tried their new Chipotle Cranberry Turkey Club.  I had them hold the bacon, because I'm that weirdo who actually looks at the nutritional info they have available, and figured I'd save a few calories.  But I got everything else - the turkey, cheddar and spinach, which was deliciously raw.  The cheese was toasted onto the bread.  A chipotle cranberry sauce added a little bit of zip to the turkey, which hallelujah! was not overly salty.  But it was the bread that made me a believer.  This is multi-grain bread that they say is thinly sliced, but it was thick enough for me.  It was lightly toasted - too lightly - but it was filled with all kinds of crunchy seeds that added a whole different dimension to the sandwich.  I despise whole wheat bread, mainly because it's always too sweet - if I want cake, I'll eat cake.  But this was not whole wheat.  I LOVED IT!  And guess what?  I'm gonna have another one during this week's charitable donation staycation at Red Rock.  Tropical Smoothie rocks!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,1,4,qyfQTYpRAZwL3oUB98JL_A

The smoothies are huge... 20 or 24 oz cup. I got the chia banana cacoa one. It was seriously delicious. $7 but it is enough for a meal.

5893248,2015-01-23,1,5WKtODFwnoKA_y9H-HubFg,"I used a text promo for the Mediterranean flatbreads for $2.99. The steak flatbread was very tasty!
The toasted flatbread had steak, lettuce, tomatoes, red onion & best of all, plenty of Mediterranean sauce/dressing! For me, it's all about that sauce. It was a creamy dressing that went great with the flatbread. There are also salads, more flatbread varieties and many smoothie flavors to choose from. 
You can add a smoothie to any meal for $4. This is a good place to fuel up before hitting those blackjack tables!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,1,4,h6x1guV8NMKHqaGWTrmYow
