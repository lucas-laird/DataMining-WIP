64174,2010-06-05,0,QiuTcA0bKQMCyOFBFJZ58w,"Late nights and good eats for me at this Mexican spot.  I work at a club on the strip and after work I hit up Tacos Mexico before I head home. It's a must!! I will tell you though the only thing I eat here is the tacos. I usually get five and most of the time it's the carne asada. You can usually judge a Mexican spot by how good the carne asada tacos are and how they are prepared and this spot is THE spot to get some good, authentic tacos during the nighttime hours. Corn tortilla, meat of choice, onions, cilantro and salsa, what else you need? NADA. I will say that the patsor is only okay and the chicken is not that great, haven't tried anything else there. Stick to the carne asada and you'll be good. They also got a drive thru which is a plus and there usually is a line of cars bout 3 deep at 4 in the mornin.

Oh and the other thing is the location... Its on Tropicana near the strip. In other words - the ""track"" - so if these tacos is not satisying enough you can get you some nasty tacos from the random girls walking down the street at any time of the night!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,0,0,4,wVW_KMg18EqBTngsRS8BuQ

So we went here 4 days ago just as we arrived in Vegas. 

I ordered the 3 tacos plate (comes with rice and beans and a soda for under $5!!). My gf ordered the sopes, and our friend got the taquitos. 
Everyone was pretty satisfied with what they got, the food was super filling. I'd recommend the carne asada tacos over the chicken. 

They also have a good salsa station where you can grab some pickled carrots, jalapenos, radishes, fresh cut lemons, along with 4 different salsas. We also ordered a side of their guacamole, which wasn't anything special, but I'd still order it again. 

I have to say though, the reason I'm not giving them 4 stars is that we all felt kinda crappy after eating here, very sluggish. I know it's mexican food, and I know it was probably greaser than you can taste which was probably the culprit, but nonetheless the feeling was mutual between us 3.

Came inside and you can tell the place is really old. Not really kept up together like others.. Which kinda made me skeptical about the food.

It is a very bright cafeteria style restaurant with a menu posted on a huge board that will take you a few minutes to figure what you want.  They have  a wide variety of meats and different ways to serve the tacos or burritos.  

I had a huge carne asada burritos that was very tasty.  I think it cost something like $4!  What a bargain for sure!  I also had a large horchata drink.  Well, it was the size of a barrel!  All in all, a very filling meal that i could not finish no matter how hard I tried!  I was full until late the next day!

Be warned, they do serve in large portions so come hungry.  If you decide to take the rest home or back to your hotel, be warned that the food may leak out of your bag and get all over the place.  

So, on my future trip to Las Vegas, I will have to catch a cab to this great Mexican restaurant.  I can't wait...of course, there are plenty of places I am looking forward to going to, but like last time, I managed to get here at 3 in the morning after an almost all night party!",qQS7enTn8OZb_5IK96-gkw,0,0,4,mJ0ZSNjpHP7HPIUHQkZs1Q

Outside the signs don't fully light up and inside is fairly messy.  There are some arcade machines in a corner, some working, some not, and the lighting is overly bright.  There is a drive-thru, but it's the type where you drive up to the window and order -- there is no microphone or anything.  

Despite appearances, the food is good when it's made correctly.  I've gotten tacos, of which you can get a lot of different types and flavors of beef and chicken, and quesadillas which offer the same choices.  With the quesadillas they come with nacho chips, beans, and lettuce.  Every time I've gone there and asked for it without lettuce they always put the lettuce in anyway.  I've resorted to telling them I'm allergic to lettuce, even though I'm not, but it seems to make no difference.  I'm sorry but I don't like lettuce and I don't want my quesadilla covered in it and soggy.  One time I gave it back to them and told them I didn't want lettuce and watched the cook open the box, take some of the lettuce out, close it up and give it back to me.  Yuck.

So, I try to keep it simple and just get tacos now.  Prices are good and it's both cheaper and a lot better and much more authentic than places like Taco Bell.  As a plus they are open 24 hours.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,3,WkhJlX-K8WmpG7tmAMx9FA

3811439,2016-11-13,0,QiuTcA0bKQMCyOFBFJZ58w,"Grew up in San Diego, and I remembered going to a local taco food spot as a kid. Late 70s - 80's, before the majors ""...bertos"" , it eventually became places like Alberto's, Robertos, Adalbertos, Rombertos, etc... haha, you get the point. But as of late I used to think, Carne Asada Burritos weren't the same because, after countless times eaten over the decades, you just get desensitized and that's like with a lot of things from childhood. At least that's the excuse I had in my head. But the first time I ate here, the flavor of burrito struck a chord of memories, and deliciousness. Made me realize, that some of these so called big Mexican food chains, are getting over on us. Here's my observation after 4 times eating here. I watched the cook cook the meat. First, he did it the way I remembered as a kid, laid it on the grill, unchopped, then after cooked, then chopped (holds on to flavor better). If you notice, most of these ""..berto"" style joints or ""Don yadayada"" , prechop meat and cook it, let it sit in warm tub, and cook it again to order, (tough and grissel). That's the meat comparison. Now, out of the 4 times that I am basing my review, the one time I saw that meat already chopped in a tub used, it was not to great, but surprisingly, still better than the competition. Maybe because it's because it's cooked in that particular better sequence. The rest of other ingredients seem fresher as well. Sour cream and guacamole is thicker. Pico de gallo, seems very fresh as well. And price is a big plus!!

BTW-Only negative(does not effect star rating cuz you just need to be aware), make sure you don't get beans and rice in burrito - it's a San Diego thing ;), taste much better.

Do I come here for the best tasting tacos and burritos in town?

I'D SAY NAY!

This place is super average. I came here recently and the carnitas tacos I infrequently get were, yet again, dry. They desperately needed the awesome green sauce this establishment makes to add much needed moisture and flavor. One of the few places in town that has spicy and flavorful green sauce.

The carne asada burrito I got was fully loaded and quite filling. But as usual,  the meat inside was dry and had the taste of hanging out in a heat warming bin for too long.

So why have I kept coming back for over a decade? Because they uphold a trinity of being consistent, cheap, and always being open 24/7. I can spend less than $15 and be full for the whole day, the tacos and burritos have always stayed average, and they have always been open when I was a broke high school student, a broke college student, and now as a broke working professional paying back his student loans.

I like this place and I'll keep coming back here. It serves cheap and and decent tasting Mexican food, 24/7. It's as simple as that.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,2,0,3,Jg0Gjjaaw5uM9mtIlqoDBg

Would I go back?...No.",_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ,2,0,1,tK7YrJfj5dYq2jjl5Wx3Sw

I HAD to yelp this particular Tacos Mexicos because it stands head and shoulders above the other locations in town...the food is cooked to order and always fresh compared to some of the mess you can find at the seedier locations throughout Vegas...

To boot, Miercoles is 60 cent taco night! Reminiscent of my days back in high school!!!",TflEE0XyySOPXbSvyznuaA,2,1,3,pfRQzD1YhcPTi6pw-DCd7A

More recently I went back during lunch and the expeirence was not so stellar. The carne asada i got on my tacos had huge chucks of fat on them, I get trying to cut corners but if tacos jsut come with meat and tortilla make sure the meat is good. It was a bad experience, I guess I should go back to see if it was a fluke but don't really wanna watse a lunch when there are so many other good options out there. 

Only good point it that it is cheap but you get what you pay for here, fat tacos not carne asada.",C7xugvjzMhmPkADOEGkQdw,2,0,2,Il0H4a3qr6RQ8q5QtHy4Bw

I ordered my food right now and since their machine was down and I never carry cash on me I had to cut my order in half since I didn't have enough cash on me.  I asked to write a check and they said no.  So it's their fault I can't use a credit card or debit card and I'm the one that pays for it,KSLUuA3jHQ-zpMmV_Lkf9w,0,0,1,gEiYoAsmOGfsHtZv_-owgg
5284176,2010-01-23,6,QiuTcA0bKQMCyOFBFJZ58w,"I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. ""I know, that is why we have Yelp!""

This place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 ""so called"" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. 

First of all, I love all my ""super burritos"" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.

I'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, ""I got ripped off."" The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  

I ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.

About an hour after I ate, I had a terrible stomach ache and spent about 10 minutes on the toilet.

I ordered a couple carne asada tacos and a couple el pastor tacos with everything on them (cilantro, onions, etc). Delicious! We went through the drive thru and the cashier was nice but they only had one cashier so she'd forget little things and assist the people in the store instead of making sure we had everything. It was a busy day so I cant be too hard on her. I will say that Id definitely come back for more tacos here especially the Pastor :) Thank you!",eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,0,1,4,nIvuuIz1IKdO4GJWNBGySQ

Earlier this week I woke up a little homesick and a craving for ""comida authentica"" that any of the hotel restaurants or other chains would not be able to satiate.  I stopped by here and picked up at large cup of menudo.  It was awesome it came backed with bits of buche instead of tripe  which I found delightful.  I will definetely add that to my next recipe when I make it again.
Is it the best taqueria I have ever gone too, maybe not, but its open 24hours and offers so damn good food.",1Qca4FtV1tUp-WZz9APgzA,0,0,4,xlGklYg7Yigi2FbFqdOUwQ
