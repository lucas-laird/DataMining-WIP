I call and talk to employee, he was very nice and transferred me to manager... Then it all went down hill... I asked what's going on, because the guy told me if I placed an order right now it would take 75 minutes... So when I talked to manager I said I ordered an hour ago, it says I have another 2 hours... I'm not understanding why I'm waiting so long.. She told me they didn't have a lot of drivers earlier, but now they do so the order times are shorter... I said shouldn't I be in line? Why does it matter you have more drivers now and not before.. She says ""that's how our system works, I don't know you can figure a ride her and get your food if you want... So I say, well can you cancel my order and redo it so I can have my food 50 minutes earlier... She says I can't do that, I have to reorder online and go through it again. Absolutely the most uneducated manager I have ever talked to in my life.I downloaded Yelp for the first time ever just to let people know these reviews are no joke, that was beyond the worst experience with ordering I have ever had.while writing this review, I had my girlfriend order food.

Me and my bob were craving some late night snack, so we decided to do pizza hut. My bob was wanting there buffalo wings, they looked so good on ther website. So we ordered some. Only$ 6.99 for 8 piece which is not bad,(plus the delivery fee is$ 3.50) so we just got those. 
I called them up and they guy picked up the phone, his name was jo, he sounded he wasn't even on earth when I was talking to him, I had to keep on repeating my order. Finally about the 3rd time I told him my order he said it will be here about 35 to 40 min. I thought it was kinda long for wings but I said ok. 
55 min later, I still haven't heard anything so I called Jo up again and I asked, what is keeping our order, he said wait just a little bit longer, it should be there, wait another 15 min, if he is not there, call us back. So I said ok, waited for actually 20 min, still nothing, so I called him back, I kept my cool and I asked what is going on, he said what is the address again I told him again, than he handed the phone to his manager, I talked to her and she told us that they called us couple times to let us know that we were at the house couple of times for our wings, I stood right by our door the whole time I didn't get any knock or anything. She got a  little bit pissy at me and said well, we will make a new batch, except us in 5 min, I said ok, I walked outside with my computer and waited, they were here in less that 4 min when I got off the phone.
The delivery guy told us he was sorry about all the trouble. Than he started asking us all kinds of questions about our living situation which was not perfectionall at all. 
I didn't really answer him, he was nice though. 
As I walked in the house and looked at the order, it was the wrong order, he they gave us boneless buffalo wings. I went threw all that for them to give me the wrong order, I will NOT be ordering from this pizza hut again, they are others around our area that I will try. I wish you luck at this pizza hut. 

But at the end I just learned to put on a happy face and just the enjoy the wrong order we got, the buffalo boneless was not bad, (there sauce was watery but good). was the same price.",Z9HpopgqT5M3zYgmJxDmRg,5,1,1,CXY6wem3tPc5rezopjwiEw

Terrible mistake in choosing Pizza Hut for delivery. Called and asked if they had any deals with pasta (one of my girls waned chicken alfredo), and they offered the $20 Big Box deal, which included 2 medium pizzas, breadsticks and the pasta. Delivery was estimated at 45 mins. Everything sounded great! 

Or so we thought. 1 hour 45 mins, still no pizza. We called to complain - the manager offered us a sorry $10 off our next purchase coupon as compensation. When the delivery guy finally arrives, he has no pepers, no parmesan and NO UTENSILS/NAPKINS, even though we had a pasta!! Unbelievable. The pepperoni pizza and mushroom pizza were not what I envisioned - we had no idea it would be this weird square pizza, and for some reason the crust was unusually greasy. The breadsticks tasted off - hard, stale and flavorless (and came with no marinara, of course).

In short, this was a horrible idea and I advise you never to make the same mistake I did. Stick to Dominoes for delivery!",hUU1WXCwY4P0kkwh1Xh3Zw,5,0,1,YpQkAQ46k3118h06HGjogA

The pizza was hot, fresh, and simply delicious.  

The best part, I got an email the next day.  Pizza Hut sent an apology email for arriving too soon!(what??) And they gave me a coupon for a free large pizza on my next order.  So, yes. I will order my next pizza here.",Yy0CAv2eIy-X1BDbtzXykQ,1,0,4,PW38_1brYx22Whwuibjnqg

When I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager Phil he said there were some really much he could do about it other than get it to me in the next 45 minutes, he wouldn't redo my order he was pretty much a total ass.

I will never ever order from Pizza Hut again. I seriously encourage everyone who leads this review to go with either dominoes or Papa John's, shoot even little Caesars is better!",u7M75WalVkaGzrU3rOHNHA,0,0,1,39mo9g9kSdZU-B0xdmY6UQ
